[54:20] word and just for a few few
[54:23] moments what think you of Christ number
[54:27] five and uh with a subtitle ye are
[54:33] Gods that's that's a hard that's quite a
[54:37] statement uh because um you know
[54:41] sometimes people think that you're
[54:42] putting more on
[54:46] ourselves but this is what the scripture
[54:49] says
[54:50] amen so so let's just see let's just see
[54:53] if we don't find we don't know who we
[54:55] are and what we
[54:58] are we we we're just playing
[55:01] church is that right that's all we're
[55:03] doing we come to church and we're we got
[55:05] a little bit of religion and and we're
[55:08] happy with
[55:09] that uh I'm not happy with that I want
[55:13] to know who we are what we are and where
[55:17] we're
[55:19] going you all
[55:21] remember I want this to be ingrained in
[55:24] you
[55:26] threefold purpose of of
[55:29] God you're going to know that the rest
[55:31] of your
[55:33] life remember what what what was
[55:37] said you understand Christ the
[55:41] mystery you're just about
[55:44] home so number
[55:48] one to reveal himself in
[55:52] Christ number two
[55:56] to have preeminence in his
[55:59] bride number
[56:02] three to restore the
[56:05] kingdom God in
[56:07] Christ Christ in his
[56:10] bride a restored
[56:12] Eden amen Matthew 22 is the ver is the
[56:15] scripture that we've been
[56:18] reading verse 41 when you have it you
[56:21] can say
[56:23] Amen
[56:27] amen and we're just going to take it
[56:29] slow
[56:31] today so I pray you can bear with
[56:36] us while the Pharisees were gathered
[56:38] together Jesus asked
[56:43] them saying what think ye of
[56:48] Christ when you don't know your position
[56:50] in
[56:52] Christ you haven't answered the
[56:56] question what think ye of
[56:59] Christ now one more
[57:01] scripture and that's Ephesians chapter
[57:07] 1 and verse
[57:11] one and it reads like this Paul an
[57:15] apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of
[57:18] God to the Saints which are at Ephesus
[57:22] and to the faithful in Christ
[57:32] Jesus may God add His blessings to the
[57:34] reading his word hold that hold that
[57:36] scripture you may be
[57:37] seated hold that scripture because we're
[57:39] going to read we're going to read uh
[57:41] we're going to continue reading on
[57:44] that but it says once
[57:47] again to the Saints which are at
[57:51] Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ
[57:56] Jesus it doesn't say to the faithful in
[57:59] Jesus
[58:01] Christ there's a reason why Things are
[58:04] Written the way that they are
[58:07] written because faithful in Christ
[58:11] Jesus simply means that you are faithful
[58:14] in the anointed
[58:18] man very important to understand
[58:22] that there's a reason why it doesn't say
[58:25] faithful and and say
[58:29] Lord but they were not faithful it
[58:32] doesn't say to the
[58:35] Lord for that was a different
[58:40] dispensation they were faithful to the
[58:42] anointed
[58:45] man everybody understand that so far
[58:49] again they were faithful to to Christ
[58:53] Jesus verse verse two if you can keep
[58:56] let's keep going in in your
[58:58] scriptures Grace be to
[59:00] you and peace from God our Father and
[59:04] from the Lord Jesus
[59:08] Christ we find all three there right
[59:11] Lord Jesus
[59:13] Christ now here you find these three but
[59:16] to the
[59:18] faithful they are to the anointed
[59:22] man verse three says Blessed Be the God
[59:25] and father of our Lord Jesus
[59:30] Christ who ha blessed us with some
[59:33] spiritual
[59:35] blessings
[59:36] no we're going to got to make sure we we
[59:39] we either believe this or we
[59:43] don't who has blessed us with all a l
[59:47] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[59:51] in
[59:53] Christ
[59:56] he will bless us when we are in our
[1:00:01] position now we we we know this by the
[1:00:05] scriptures that God will never bless
[1:00:07] Israel outside their
[1:00:11] Homeland and neither will he bless the
[1:00:14] believer outside of their
[1:00:17] position the word or the office Christ
[1:00:20] pertains to the spiritual
[1:00:23] man
[1:00:25] we have to we have to make sure we
[1:00:27] understand
[1:00:28] that so spiritual blessings is not for a
[1:00:31] carnal
[1:00:33] person spiritual blessings are for
[1:00:36] Spiritual
[1:00:38] people I ask how many spiritual people
[1:00:41] do we have
[1:00:43] here spiritual blessings all spiritual
[1:00:48] blessings are for a spiritual
[1:00:52] people amen so then Christ is our
[1:00:58] position and You' be surprised how many
[1:01:00] people are blinded to
[1:01:03] this Christ is a
[1:01:06] position I want I want you to say this
[1:01:09] with me Al together Christ is a position
[1:01:13] Christ is a position I want you to say
[1:01:14] Christ is my position Christ is my
[1:01:17] position right it's not just a
[1:01:20] position it is my
[1:01:23] position tell your neighbor neighbor
[1:01:25] Christ is my
[1:01:29] position so he has blessed us the
[1:01:34] believer in Christ and we're grateful to
[1:01:37] God for
[1:01:39] that we have to watch how we speak and
[1:01:42] what we
[1:01:43] speak we've got to be very careful
[1:01:47] amen you know sometimes even the
[1:01:49] preacher has to be preached
[1:01:53] to amen now now you know you you hear
[1:01:56] people
[1:01:57] talking and and you see how they say
[1:02:00] things you realize but at times uh you
[1:02:03] know we we we talk the same
[1:02:06] way so yes the day before
[1:02:09] yesterday my wife had Twisted her
[1:02:13] foot and uh and she was she couldn't
[1:02:16] walk on it and she got up on
[1:02:19] Saturday and she says uh this is hurting
[1:02:23] me so bad
[1:02:25] and I said but we have a high priest of
[1:02:28] our
[1:02:31] confession and so I said we got to
[1:02:33] change the way we
[1:02:35] talk and so so she says yes I my foot is
[1:02:41] fine and I I kid you
[1:02:44] not it wasn't even not even a few
[1:02:46] minutes
[1:02:47] later she's walking around like
[1:02:50] nothing I said we have a high priest of
[1:02:53] our confession
[1:02:57] why don't we talk like
[1:02:59] that so later on in the
[1:03:02] day I was I don't know if I was
[1:03:04] dehydrated I was
[1:03:07] down and I just said man I don't feel
[1:03:12] good and sister Hannah says hey hey
[1:03:19] hey and I said I feel
[1:03:23] great you you understand but that's what
[1:03:25] we need to do with one
[1:03:28] another mind each other that that that
[1:03:31] we we have a high
[1:03:34] priest that can be touched by the
[1:03:36] feeling of our
[1:03:39] infirmity we have a high priest of our
[1:03:44] confession and so if we're always
[1:03:46] talking
[1:03:47] negative if we're always talking
[1:03:50] NE we ever going to G to going to get
[1:03:53] anywhere
[1:03:54] when we when we see these
[1:03:57] things we know that we have our position
[1:04:00] in
[1:04:02] Christ today is not the dispensation of
[1:04:05] the
[1:04:07] fatherhood great as that dispensation
[1:04:13] was neither is it the the dispensation
[1:04:15] of the
[1:04:18] sunship even though that was a great
[1:04:21] great
[1:04:23] dispensation
[1:04:25] but this today is the dispensation of
[1:04:28] the Holy
[1:04:30] Ghost in order to manifest the sons of
[1:04:34] God or I can say in order to manifest
[1:04:38] and you have to say
[1:04:42] me I came and we were manifested is that
[1:04:45] right okay now now now notice this now
[1:04:49] as as it
[1:04:51] unfolds the sons of God could only be
[1:04:55] manifested in the dispensation of the
[1:04:58] Holy
[1:04:59] Ghost now you might say well
[1:05:02] brother brother brandham said we're not
[1:05:05] living in the dispensation of the
[1:05:06] baptism of the Holy
[1:05:10] Ghost that's right not in the
[1:05:13] dispensation of the baptism of the Holy
[1:05:16] Ghost but we are living in the
[1:05:20] dispensation of the person of the Holy
[1:05:23] Ghost
[1:05:25] is the time or dispensation of
[1:05:30] adoption this is for sons of God not for
[1:05:34] Angels I'm GNA say it again this is for
[1:05:37] this is for sons of God
[1:05:39] here John chap 10 verse 33 and 3 to
[1:05:45] 35 you have it you can say
[1:05:53] Amen
[1:05:55] the Jews answered him saying for a good
[1:05:57] work we Stone thee
[1:06:03] not but for
[1:06:11] blasphemy and because thou being a
[1:06:15] man maketh thyself
[1:06:20] God now now now remember what my my my
[1:06:24] subtitle is ye are
[1:06:32] Gods we are Gods is that right okay so
[1:06:36] so so when we see
[1:06:38] this I'm not talking that we are Big G
[1:06:44] Gods there is only one big G only one
[1:06:49] God so when God was manifested in flesh
[1:06:54] they weren't going to Stone him because
[1:06:56] of his good
[1:06:59] works but because they could not figure
[1:07:01] out how a
[1:07:05] man he was making himself
[1:07:08] God and there they could not in their
[1:07:12] religion by their religion could not
[1:07:16] understand how they could or how he
[1:07:18] could be
[1:07:21] God and Jesus answered them
[1:07:25] is it not written in your
[1:07:29] law I said we we've we've said that
[1:07:33] before is it not written in your
[1:07:37] law he's pointing the law to their
[1:07:42] law but then he's telling them that he's
[1:07:44] the one that wrote
[1:07:48] it yes or yes amen get that now notice
[1:07:51] that he call he says it is not written
[1:07:55] is it not written in your
[1:07:58] law I
[1:08:01] said ye are
[1:08:04] Gods my
[1:08:06] goodness and if he called them
[1:08:10] Gods unto whom the word of God
[1:08:15] came and the scripture cannot be
[1:08:20] broken I'm I'm grateful to God for that
[1:08:24] because this doesn't just apply to back
[1:08:27] then the scripture goes all the way
[1:08:32] through it cannot be
[1:08:36] broken see the
[1:08:38] expression he called them
[1:08:42] Gods whom the word of
[1:08:45] God came to now I'm going to turn it a
[1:08:48] little bit so you understand
[1:08:50] me he called them God
[1:08:54] whom the
[1:08:56] logos or the
[1:08:58] Christ came
[1:09:00] to amen amen that's what we have to
[1:09:03] understand Christ is the
[1:09:05] word and so if the word or the
[1:09:09] logos the Christ comes to you ye are
[1:09:16] Gods how your neighbor if the word of
[1:09:19] God comes to
[1:09:20] you ye are
[1:09:22] God if the logos comes to
[1:09:26] you ye are God hallelujah and that logos
[1:09:30] has a
[1:09:32] bride Glory Glory Glory what think ye of
[1:09:37] Christ if he called them sons of
[1:09:41] God or Gods then the scripture cannot be
[1:09:47] broken never be
[1:09:49] broken say ye of him this is verse
[1:09:52] 36 say ye of him whom the father hath
[1:09:55] Sanctified and sent into the world thou
[1:10:13] blasphemist because I said I am the Son
[1:10:18] of
[1:10:19] God Son of God is
[1:10:22] spirit that right right amen that's part
[1:10:25] that's one of his
[1:10:26] offices because I said I am the Son of
[1:10:30] God when he was here as a
[1:10:34] man was he Son of
[1:10:38] God he was here as son of
[1:10:41] man prophet he was in flesh son of man
[1:10:46] but through the church
[1:10:48] ages he was Son of God because he was
[1:10:52] back in spirit form
[1:10:55] everybody understand that I'm trying to
[1:10:58] be as easy as possible that I can this
[1:11:02] morning so what was God
[1:11:08] restoring we we we we we follow a
[1:11:11] message and it's a message of
[1:11:15] restoration because every one of us was
[1:11:18] born in
[1:11:19] sin escaped in
[1:11:21] iniquity we came to the world World
[1:11:23] speaking
[1:11:25] lies and somehow we come to church and
[1:11:28] think that we're better than everyone
[1:11:32] else yes or
[1:11:35] yes I've been going to church all my
[1:11:38] life well good you're responsible for a
[1:11:43] lot that don't make you any better than
[1:11:46] anyone I want you to I want to know what
[1:11:48] was going to be
[1:11:51] restored a message came
[1:11:54] sent a
[1:11:55] prophet that message was a message of
[1:11:59] restoration not of
[1:12:02] reformation that was during the church
[1:12:05] ages but at the end there was going to
[1:12:07] be a re a restoring a
[1:12:11] restoration what was going to be
[1:12:15] restored what was God
[1:12:19] restoring man's
[1:12:22] position
[1:12:27] godship
[1:12:29] okay some people will say that's
[1:12:34] blasphemy say
[1:12:37] godship that doesn't pertain to us we're
[1:12:39] human
[1:12:42] beings I didn't say that the Bible says
[1:12:47] that the scripture can't be
[1:12:51] broken not yday yesterday not today not
[1:12:57] tomorrow that's why I say we either got
[1:12:59] to know what we're doing in
[1:13:03] church that to make us feel good that we
[1:13:06] came to
[1:13:08] church no the word
[1:13:12] [Music]
[1:13:14] godship it means the
[1:13:18] rank the
[1:13:20] character or the personality
[1:13:23] of a
[1:13:25] god
[1:13:27] deity
[1:13:29] Divinity now in the message adoption
[1:13:32] number
[1:13:33] four he goes on to say this so I guess
[1:13:38] they're still having the same
[1:13:42] problem same problem that they were
[1:13:44] having back
[1:13:46] then they were having the same problem
[1:13:48] in the times of of of this
[1:13:52] prophet and the same problem
[1:13:56] today he says this this may choke you to
[1:14:07] death this is May maybe GNA choke
[1:14:10] you choke you to
[1:14:13] death but did you
[1:14:15] know that
[1:14:19] men
[1:14:20] men that are sons of God
[1:14:24] are amateure
[1:14:31] Gods is that is that anybody
[1:14:34] here or is that just the people in the
[1:14:38] Bible you know the people in the Bible
[1:14:40] were just as much human as you
[1:14:43] are and they didn't live in this
[1:14:46] time which is the time of the
[1:14:49] manifestation of the sons of
[1:14:52] God so it's a greater time
[1:14:56] now did you know that men that are sons
[1:14:58] of God are amature
[1:15:04] Gods he goes on and says in the message
[1:15:06] why a man was made to be a
[1:15:11] God know
[1:15:15] that why does why does those things
[1:15:18] always seem like it's something
[1:15:20] something like far-fetched
[1:15:25] he's in the image of
[1:15:28] God he's a Son of
[1:15:31] God he's like
[1:15:34] him he was given a domain in Genesis
[1:15:39] 126 dominion over the whole
[1:15:42] earth that's right he Ruled the Earth he
[1:15:46] ruled the animal
[1:15:47] King and all the other
[1:15:50] kingdoms all but the king kingdom of God
[1:15:55] above he was God he was an amateure
[1:15:59] God so here's
[1:16:01] Satan and he's trying to keep us away
[1:16:05] from our
[1:16:08] position is that right amen that's what
[1:16:10] he was trying to
[1:16:12] do he he envied Adam so
[1:16:16] much because Adam as a Son of
[1:16:20] God as the God of this Earth
[1:16:23] could do things that he
[1:16:29] couldn't here's The
[1:16:31] Serpent and the serpent Here Comes Satan
[1:16:35] into that
[1:16:37] serpent he's jealous of
[1:16:40] Adam because he can do things that he
[1:16:43] can't doam
[1:16:46] do now these are all basic we we we have
[1:16:48] heard this time and time
[1:16:50] again but I'm getting to something
[1:16:53] something this
[1:16:54] morning he was an amateur
[1:16:57] God and Satan through the serpent
[1:17:01] man is trying to get ahead of God's
[1:17:05] plan and he's trying to take away or
[1:17:09] remove man from that position of
[1:17:13] godship okay Genesis
[1:17:16] 35 watch his
[1:17:19] thinking watch what he's trying to do
[1:17:22] here
[1:17:24] for God he's talking to the woman
[1:17:26] now for God does
[1:17:29] know that in the day ye eat
[1:17:33] thereof then your eyes shall be
[1:17:38] open and ye shall be as God's knowing
[1:17:42] good and
[1:17:45] evil wait wait a minute you'll be as
[1:17:49] Gods knowing Good and Evil
[1:17:53] who was that tree of knowledge of Good
[1:17:55] and
[1:17:57] Evil come on who who was that tree that
[1:18:01] tree was
[1:18:02] Satan yes or yes so then he's telling
[1:18:06] them you shall be as
[1:18:10] Gods knowing or you'll be a part or a
[1:18:13] branch off of my
[1:18:17] tree right watch what he's offering them
[1:18:21] or her at the time
[1:18:24] yet they were already
[1:18:29] Gods oh my goodness I'm going to say it
[1:18:31] again they were already
[1:18:34] Gods he had dominion over the Earth he
[1:18:38] had dominion over the
[1:18:40] animals he was already a
[1:18:43] God he was the god of the
[1:18:47] Earth but he's trying to tell them that
[1:18:50] they have that that they don't have it
[1:18:52] or they did not have
[1:18:55] possession and so it is
[1:18:58] today that Satan is is okay with telling
[1:19:02] us that we will be sons of
[1:19:08] God we all know that that's one of his
[1:19:11] tricks putting something out in the
[1:19:14] future that is right
[1:19:16] now but
[1:19:18] remember men that are sons of
[1:19:21] God
[1:19:23] who came from that tree of
[1:19:27] life they are amateur
[1:19:30] gods they can't be anything
[1:19:36] less come on now there is only one
[1:19:39] source of
[1:19:41] life and that is the tree of life
[1:19:44] there's no other
[1:19:46] source okay stop for a minute think
[1:19:49] about this here's Moses
[1:19:53] and and and Moses he goes up the
[1:19:57] mountain for 40 days and there in the
[1:20:02] mountain he goes into this into a
[1:20:07] vision and he starts to see how things
[1:20:10] are in
[1:20:13] heaven he starts to see how where the
[1:20:16] throne is
[1:20:19] at now God is showing him this because
[1:20:23] God is wanting the same
[1:20:26] pattern that is in
[1:20:28] heaven to come down and be on
[1:20:33] earth here he sees this great
[1:20:37] picture he seen Heaven the throne the
[1:20:42] guards of the
[1:20:43] throne the stream of Life coming
[1:20:47] through he's seen the Tree of
[1:20:50] Life he's looking at all all this
[1:20:54] Perfection and God says now now now
[1:20:57] learn it you got you got to know
[1:20:59] this because you got to make the same
[1:21:02] thing here on
[1:21:04] Earth okay so imagine Moses when he
[1:21:08] starts to pen the Book of
[1:21:12] [Applause]
[1:21:14] Genesis whom the word of God comes to be
[1:21:17] our
[1:21:19] God and he starts to see this this whole
[1:21:24] picture the whole picture of Genesis
[1:21:27] right and he's he he he's writing these
[1:21:29] things
[1:21:30] down how many know Moses Moses wrote the
[1:21:33] Book of
[1:21:34] Genesis but he's seeing all these things
[1:21:37] and and and he's saying okay I I've got
[1:21:39] to do the same thing down
[1:21:41] here so he knows that right in the
[1:21:44] center is the tree of
[1:21:47] life or is the throne where life comes
[1:21:52] from
[1:21:54] he's he's seing this this
[1:21:56] Panorama now now now when he sees it
[1:21:59] here he starts to build the Tabernacle
[1:22:02] down
[1:22:03] here and this Tabernacle was it's as
[1:22:07] close as he could make
[1:22:09] it but the main things were
[1:22:12] there the outer Court the holy place the
[1:22:16] holy of Hol that's where the where that
[1:22:20] Mercy Seat was
[1:22:21] at and round about that
[1:22:24] Throne we see 144,000
[1:22:30] right
[1:22:33] well we see that at the
[1:22:36] end but right here see 12
[1:22:39] tribes 12 tribes made up of many
[1:22:44] people but they're encamped about
[1:22:49] round this is
[1:22:51] important because as he's doing
[1:22:55] that it is a type of what's coming
[1:22:59] afterwards because as tremendous as the
[1:23:02] Tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:23:06] is the throne is is moving all the
[1:23:10] time that's why I say as tremendous it
[1:23:13] was that God was tabernacled in Jesus
[1:23:19] Christ that was the groom tree
[1:23:23] but that groom tree also has a bride
[1:23:26] tree and when he would come at the
[1:23:30] end notice that groom
[1:23:33] tree he also had guards around
[1:23:37] him we know who the guards of that of
[1:23:40] him was that of of that Throne
[1:23:43] right the guards of that
[1:23:46] Throne that's right the gospels Matthew
[1:23:48] Mark Luke and
[1:23:51] John but when when we come then through
[1:23:53] the church
[1:23:55] ages we also see
[1:23:57] guards and those
[1:23:59] guards is
[1:24:01] what is the four living creatures
[1:24:05] right ox or the lion the O the man and
[1:24:10] the L Eagle now what's so significant
[1:24:14] about
[1:24:15] this is because many people even
[1:24:20] today this is what brother Braham says
[1:24:22] that they're living the glare of another
[1:24:25] [Music]
[1:24:27] age they're living under the anointing
[1:24:29] of The Lion and the ox and the
[1:24:33] man but they're missing the anointing of
[1:24:36] the Flying
[1:24:39] Eagle this is where I believe that the
[1:24:42] foolish virgins miss
[1:24:44] it they don't have the complete
[1:24:48] anointing there's something that is
[1:24:51] missing
[1:24:52] and that is the anointing of the Flying
[1:24:56] Eagle because under the anointing of
[1:24:58] that flying
[1:25:00] eagle the revelation of the of your
[1:25:04] day of the message of your
[1:25:07] day it's be that you have recognized
[1:25:10] your day and its
[1:25:13] message now now think about this for a
[1:25:16] moment because this is why it's so
[1:25:19] important that at the last moment
[1:25:23] will the bride have a
[1:25:27] Ministry okay see what are the guards to
[1:25:31] the throne in this last
[1:25:37] moment this is important
[1:25:39] church because as the throne
[1:25:43] moves there are guards there now all
[1:25:47] those four living creatures yes they're
[1:25:49] still around
[1:25:51] it but now he's given or placed more
[1:25:56] guard to the
[1:25:59] body or where he is at
[1:26:03] today he's got guards
[1:26:06] Church come on now and what are his
[1:26:09] guards
[1:26:13] today the fivefold
[1:26:15] ministry right Apostles and Prophets and
[1:26:18] teachers evangelists and
[1:26:20] pastors around the
[1:26:23] throne that's why it gets more severe
[1:26:26] and more
[1:26:28] severe now I say all that but but but
[1:26:31] let me get back to where I was
[1:26:35] at that's the trouble he
[1:26:39] says of it
[1:26:42] today another Christian
[1:26:46] person that's sitting here
[1:26:50] sick if they only knew that they were
[1:26:53] Sons and Daughters of
[1:26:57] God how many sick people do we
[1:27:03] have nobody
[1:27:06] sick got two three four five
[1:27:11] six
[1:27:12] seven and we got many some of that are
[1:27:15] in the hospital right
[1:27:17] now now he's saying if they only knew
[1:27:23] that they were Sons and Daughters of
[1:27:26] God
[1:27:28] now living with
[1:27:34] Christ is that you or who is
[1:27:38] that I I don't like it when it's pushed
[1:27:41] off on somebody
[1:27:43] else who who is this talking now living
[1:27:47] with
[1:27:48] Christ that's me that's you
[1:27:52] but you've got to recognize
[1:27:55] that watch what he says now now now
[1:27:59] you've got the Pentecostal
[1:28:02] blessing the day of Pentecost fully come
[1:28:06] and then he go 1900 years
[1:28:10] ago he goes
[1:28:12] never till
[1:28:16] Jesus that's when the day of Pentecost
[1:28:18] will fully have
[1:28:21] arrived
[1:28:23] oh watch what he says here now this is
[1:28:25] the message thou knowest all
[1:28:28] things now is the
[1:28:32] hour
[1:28:34] tomorrow now is the
[1:28:36] hour now is the
[1:28:40] time now is the accepted
[1:28:43] hour this is the acceptable year of the
[1:28:48] Lord now is when healing is supposed to
[1:28:51] be
[1:28:55] anybody sick
[1:28:57] here he is the high priest of your
[1:29:00] confession by his stri we are
[1:29:03] healed now is when Miracles take
[1:29:10] place not
[1:29:11] tomorrow you know it seems like we don't
[1:29:14] see very many miracles no more
[1:29:16] huh but it depends on what kind of
[1:29:19] Miracles we're looking
[1:29:20] for
[1:29:23] now is when Christ is revealing
[1:29:28] himself here we are now not in the
[1:29:33] future the devil keeps pushing it
[1:29:36] off that's
[1:29:39] Catholicism now is the day this is the
[1:29:43] hour this is the time this is the place
[1:29:48] right now this is the
[1:29:50] day
[1:29:53] oh Church come
[1:29:55] on and so then when Adam had
[1:29:59] sinned that godship came out of
[1:30:03] Adam and went back to where it came
[1:30:09] from oh what a thing huh what a thing
[1:30:13] that happened in the
[1:30:15] garden and Moses is
[1:30:20] writing Tree of Life the tree of
[1:30:23] knowledge of Good and
[1:30:25] Evil I saw
[1:30:28] that
[1:30:33] saw these rivers that flow through
[1:30:40] Eden he's writing these things and he's
[1:30:43] he's seeing
[1:30:47] them so he is an amateur
[1:30:54] but the reason that we don't recognize
[1:30:58] it because sin has blinded every fiber
[1:31:02] of our
[1:31:05] bodies sin has blinded our
[1:31:09] minds sin has blinded our
[1:31:13] hearts and therefore we can't see who we
[1:31:15] really
[1:31:17] are that's why we need a new
[1:31:20] birth notice in this in the message
[1:31:22] thirsting for
[1:31:25] Life read this go along just read it
[1:31:28] with me if you
[1:31:30] could the logos that went out of
[1:31:34] God no disregards to the Catholic people
[1:31:38] [Music]
[1:31:39] now but they use the word of Eternal
[1:31:44] sunship of
[1:31:50] God Asal
[1:31:55] ship
[1:31:58] anybody you act like you don't know what
[1:32:00] I'm talking
[1:32:02] about if you read you would know what
[1:32:04] I'm talking
[1:32:07] about they use the word Eternal sunship
[1:32:10] of
[1:32:13] God the word doesn't even make sense to
[1:32:18] me the word Eternal means eternity
[1:32:24] which had no beginning or has no
[1:32:28] end and Son means that it had a
[1:32:33] beginning so how could it it could be
[1:32:38] then he goes so how could it and then he
[1:32:42] stops it could be a eternal
[1:32:50] godship right not Eternal sunship those
[1:32:53] words don't go
[1:32:55] together a son had a
[1:32:57] beginning an eternal beginning doesn't
[1:33:00] make
[1:33:02] sense but it could be a Eternal
[1:33:06] godship what he's saying he's telling us
[1:33:09] he's telling us who we
[1:33:11] are it could be an eternal
[1:33:16] godship but never an eternal
[1:33:20] sunship a son is one that's begotten of
[1:33:23] so it had a
[1:33:25] beginning and the logos which was the
[1:33:28] son of
[1:33:29] God went out created by these great
[1:33:33] Fountains of
[1:33:36] Purity now this is
[1:33:38] important because in the early
[1:33:40] years he talks about the logos being the
[1:33:44] Son of
[1:33:45] God but by the end of the
[1:33:48] message in the later years he never uses
[1:33:53] logos with son
[1:33:56] anymore why I want to know why he
[1:33:59] doesn't use sunship anymore with
[1:34:05] logos okay stop for a moment because
[1:34:07] this is this is good
[1:34:13] stuff better smile at
[1:34:15] me you have this look at me for
[1:34:19] reals all right TR I get some
[1:34:23] smesh think I was wasn't telling you
[1:34:25] giving you eternal life this
[1:34:28] morning excited about that I'm excited
[1:34:31] when I I
[1:34:34] read why does he
[1:34:38] use son with
[1:34:44] logos at the beginning of his
[1:34:48] message but in the later years he
[1:34:50] doesn't use that no more
[1:34:53] think about that for a it's tremendous
[1:34:57] why because he uses it as
[1:35:01] son because when he first came on the
[1:35:04] scene with his
[1:35:07] message we had not come in to this world
[1:35:12] yet and so there was still Sons inside
[1:35:16] of
[1:35:17] him that still had to come out and be
[1:35:20] manifested
[1:35:23] and as long as we were still in
[1:35:25] him there was still
[1:35:30] sunship but when once we come
[1:35:33] forth and are
[1:35:36] manifested there's nothing left to
[1:35:39] manifest there's nothing left
[1:35:42] to so when the last son has come
[1:35:47] forth that logos ain't son no
[1:35:50] more it is
[1:35:52] eternal but what is he he now he's known
[1:35:56] as the logos the Eternal
[1:36:01] Father
[1:36:03] Hallelujah did you get
[1:36:06] that sure everybody got that that's
[1:36:08] that's I think that's pretty
[1:36:11] easy watch now that's why when the last
[1:36:14] one comes
[1:36:16] in last one is
[1:36:18] manifested go back and brother Ram says
[1:36:20] there will be no need for the
[1:36:24] sun no need
[1:36:26] anymore for the lamb is the
[1:36:29] light he'll be at the top in that great
[1:36:34] City and right above him will be the
[1:36:37] Eternal
[1:36:40] Father Hallelujah so as long as he's got
[1:36:44] Sons to come
[1:36:49] forth notice this now every you got
[1:36:51] about that now let's let's go
[1:36:54] on it could be now he goes then he goes
[1:36:57] the logos which was the son of
[1:36:59] God and then he talks about those
[1:37:02] Spirits went out and created and it
[1:37:04] created the
[1:37:07] logos it was a body it was in the form
[1:37:11] of what we are
[1:37:12] now which in the clergy way of speaking
[1:37:15] is a
[1:37:18] theophany a body that doesn't have a
[1:37:21] spirit
[1:37:23] in it's a body that's waiting for you
[1:37:29] Christians the word theop
[1:37:33] mean
[1:37:35] the
[1:37:37] God is a body so it's a body like
[1:37:46] God know ye not that you have a
[1:37:50] theophany
[1:37:53] a body from
[1:37:56] God anybody here have that come on
[1:38:00] Church you we we have a
[1:38:02] body if this Earthly Tabernacle be
[1:38:07] dissolved we have a more excellent
[1:38:10] one we have another body that's
[1:38:14] waiting when we step out of this
[1:38:17] body into that body know ye not that ye
[1:38:21] are
[1:38:24] Gods let's continue to read this now
[1:38:28] when God was in
[1:38:30] theophany which was Christ in the
[1:38:35] making then that
[1:38:38] theop become flesh and dwelled amongst
[1:38:42] us then that was to
[1:38:46] redeem he came from there down through
[1:38:49] this to redeem this creature
[1:38:54] give it life and take it back up into
[1:38:58] the Eternal
[1:39:02] one I don't know about you but I that is
[1:39:06] so satisfying to
[1:39:11] myself adoption number
[1:39:13] four and when God said in Genesis
[1:39:17] 2 they were
[1:39:20] gods because they
[1:39:23] were had full domain or dominion over
[1:39:26] the
[1:39:28] world and he lost his
[1:39:33] godship he lost his
[1:39:39] sunship he lost his
[1:39:41] domain and Satan took it
[1:39:44] over but brother we are waiting for the
[1:39:48] manifestation of the sons of God
[1:39:52] who will come back and take it over
[1:39:56] again come on church that's what it's
[1:40:00] about to take back what belongs to
[1:40:04] you tell your neighbor neighbor let's
[1:40:07] take back what belongs to
[1:40:11] us oh my Lord Jesus this is so good to
[1:40:14] me waiting for the fullness of
[1:40:18] time when the pyramid gets up to the
[1:40:22] top when the full sons of God will be
[1:40:27] manifested when the power of God will
[1:40:30] walk
[1:40:33] out wait a minute I didn't know that
[1:40:36] power could
[1:40:41] walk can power
[1:40:44] walk yeah of course it is when it Finds
[1:40:47] Its
[1:40:49] vessel when the power of God will walk
[1:40:53] out and will take every Power Of
[1:40:59] Satan got away from
[1:41:02] him let's stop there for a moment come
[1:41:05] on you got to get into the spirit with
[1:41:07] me this
[1:41:08] morning when the power of God will walk
[1:41:12] out and will take hold this and will
[1:41:16] take every bit of
[1:41:19] power that Satan's
[1:41:22] got take it away from
[1:41:27] him we give Satan too much
[1:41:32] power that's what I'm talking
[1:41:34] about I don't feel
[1:41:38] good even the preacher has to be
[1:41:42] preached but as soon as I said I feel
[1:41:47] better things
[1:41:49] change don't give him
[1:41:52] power he should be powerless against the
[1:41:56] Church of the Living
[1:41:59] God come on I'm going to say it again he
[1:42:01] should be
[1:42:03] powerless but we we live in
[1:42:06] fear what's going to happen and what if
[1:42:09] this happen and what if that happen why
[1:42:12] are you
[1:42:13] worried because you haven't answered the
[1:42:16] question what think ye of
[1:42:19] Christ
[1:42:21] notice what he says
[1:42:26] here he made man a
[1:42:30] god a God in his
[1:42:33] domain and he it goes from C to
[1:42:37] se Shore to
[1:42:39] Shore and he has control of it what is
[1:42:47] Jehovah somebody help
[1:42:49] me somebody not a
[1:42:52] minister what does Jehovah
[1:42:58] mean somebody help
[1:43:05] me one with his
[1:43:09] family what else does it
[1:43:13] mean that's true that's the main that's
[1:43:15] the main one but there's something
[1:43:17] else it's so important to understand
[1:43:20] this when you say ye are
[1:43:26] Gods that's right cor Jehovah means that
[1:43:31] he gave man to be an amateur
[1:43:35] god listen to the way brother brandham
[1:43:37] explains this adoption number
[1:43:40] one I am the all exist
[1:43:44] one who has created something off of
[1:43:49] myself
[1:43:51] you have not understood who Jehovah
[1:43:55] is you know I was what he made off of
[1:44:04] himself one who has created something
[1:44:07] off of
[1:44:08] myself to be a son of
[1:44:11] mine or an amateure a little one of
[1:44:15] mind he gave man he made man an amateur
[1:44:20] God
[1:44:21] and that man was God over the
[1:44:25] Earth we're getting that
[1:44:28] back I don't know about you but we're
[1:44:30] getting that
[1:44:32] back I'm challenging you this morning
[1:44:35] I'm going to get it
[1:44:37] back I will restore sayth the
[1:44:41] Lord watch this now that's why in
[1:44:44] Philippians 2:6 I didn't put that on
[1:44:46] there but if you can if you can pull
[1:44:47] that up real
[1:44:49] quick
[1:44:51] as we spoke of last
[1:44:53] Sunday Satan is a
[1:44:57] robber what does he do he steals
[1:45:03] bodies we talked about 200,000,000 or
[1:45:07] 200 million demons last
[1:45:12] year You' be
[1:45:15] surprised I go to this the Bible study
[1:45:19] brother Tim
[1:45:21] he's preaching exactly what we're
[1:45:23] preaching we're not
[1:45:26] talking sister Hannah is that true she
[1:45:29] can be she's a
[1:45:30] witness it's
[1:45:33] impossible that two men that we don't

[1:45:41] same
[1:45:42] thing 200 million

[1:45:53] okay how many of you confront these
[1:45:55] Spirits every
[1:45:59] day they entice you don't
[1:46:03] they enticing means that they pull you
[1:46:05] to
[1:46:07] themselves right so so so look at any
[1:46:11] example okay you're at school somebody
[1:46:14] cusses you
[1:46:17] out what's the first thing if you don't
[1:46:20] recognize that they have an anointing on
[1:46:24] them and that anointing wants to get on
[1:46:28] you then before you know it you're
[1:46:30] cussing right back at
[1:46:32] them what happened you were
[1:46:36] enticed and the spirits got a hold of
[1:46:43] you here comes the
[1:46:45] spirit gets a hold of the
[1:46:47] wife she gets
[1:46:49] mouthy
[1:46:52] and if someone doesn't have the Holy
[1:46:55] Ghost what do we do oh you want to fight
[1:46:59] I'll fight with you
[1:47:00] too what's going on enticing
[1:47:06] Spirits somebody cuts you off when
[1:47:08] you're driving what
[1:47:13] happen you just got
[1:47:18] enticed come on Church you know it true
[1:47:20] this
[1:47:21] is and everywhere you
[1:47:24] turn 200 million
[1:47:27] demons coming after the
[1:47:32] bride you know we we lose it like
[1:47:36] that anger
[1:47:39] issues get the Holy
[1:47:41] Ghost I'm not saying you'll never get
[1:47:44] angry but it'll help you control
[1:47:48] that we're human
[1:47:52] beings you know sometimes when I'm when
[1:47:54] I counsel with
[1:47:57] people notice I'm not getting too close
[1:47:59] back
[1:48:02] here might fall
[1:48:07] off and I
[1:48:11] count you tell them
[1:48:16] exactly have such a hard time
[1:48:19] to don't do it and I go to the Lord say
[1:48:23] Lord the answer was right
[1:48:25] there what's the problem Lord do I have
[1:48:29] to make it easier do I I mean what do I
[1:48:31] do Lord to
[1:48:35] help you're trying to get
[1:48:40] someone that don't have the Holy
[1:48:42] Ghost I'm not saying that everybody I
[1:48:44] talk to don't have the Holy
[1:48:47] Ghost many that I talk to
[1:48:50] I'm trying to get them to see what I'm
[1:48:53] talking
[1:48:55] about but the Holy Ghost isn't
[1:49:02] present and so instead of rolling out
[1:49:05] this big long
[1:49:10] plan get the Holy
[1:49:12] Ghost that will fix the majority of your
[1:49:15] marital
[1:49:16] problem the majority of whatever
[1:49:18] problems you got going on
[1:49:21] that's the problem we don't have the
[1:49:22] Holy
[1:49:23] Ghost many don't have it we have
[1:49:26] religion but not the Holy
[1:49:31] Ghost come on check yourself with the
[1:49:36] word as we continue to see
[1:49:39] this Philippians 2:6 says who being in
[1:49:42] the form of
[1:49:44] God thought it not robbery to be
[1:49:49] equal
[1:49:52] put on that
[1:49:53] mind the mind that was in Christ put
[1:49:57] that mind on because then you won't
[1:49:59] think it
[1:50:01] robbery then you won't think it is
[1:50:05] blasphemy when the scripture says ye are
[1:50:11] God
[1:50:12] now when I Ponder these
[1:50:17] things
[1:50:19] and we we look this I'm going to I I'm
[1:50:21] going to have to start skipping a few
[1:50:23] things
[1:50:26] here but this is very very
[1:50:30] important of understanding our position
[1:50:33] in
[1:50:35] Christ I don't know if it's me but I am
[1:50:37] it is hot up there you guys hot down
[1:50:41] there somebody this Fan's
[1:50:44] working they don't
[1:50:47] work the
[1:50:49] AC
[1:50:51] I have to drink some you want some water
[1:50:54] anybody want some water you want some
[1:50:56] water we got some here you can come up
[1:50:58] and get
[1:50:59] one really I mean
[1:51:07] people it's okay it's okay I let I let
[1:51:11] youbody
[1:51:15] wants want you feeling fresh
[1:51:18] with
[1:51:20] notice this
[1:51:22] now our position is in
[1:51:26] Christ the only way to understand
[1:51:29] this we have to understand the trees
[1:51:31] that were in the
[1:51:33] garden
[1:51:36] tree you must bring it up through the
[1:51:38] garden all the way
[1:51:41] through up through the Bible everywhere
[1:51:44] from the you find the same two
[1:51:47] trees up in heaven
[1:51:50] yeah the tree of life was in heaven
[1:51:53] right you find those same two
[1:51:56] trees Heaven Down to Earth all the way
[1:51:59] through the
[1:52:01] scriptures
[1:52:03] trees every tree as you bring it through
[1:52:06] the
[1:52:07] scriptures you can search every one of
[1:52:10] you can search them all the way back to
[1:52:14] Genesis it's
[1:52:16] tremendous now that's why when you the
[1:52:20] same way that God has a
[1:52:24] brid Satan also has a
[1:52:27] brid and a tree shows the
[1:52:32] relationship between two or more
[1:52:35] people such as a family tree
[1:52:38] right that's why in Adam's genealogy you
[1:52:41] don't find
[1:52:43] Cain he was not part of that of that
[1:52:46] tree all right we find this the tree of
[1:52:49] life and the tree of knowledge of Good
[1:52:50] and
[1:52:52] Evil two Vines two trees growing side by
[1:52:56] side producing
[1:52:59] children all right now remember Satan
[1:53:03] had injected himself into the human
[1:53:07] race and hence all the mixtures and the
[1:53:10] high breeding and everything came from
[1:53:13] there and that's why it was Cain's
[1:53:17] children no notice how brother Braham
[1:53:19] says this
[1:53:21] they were the daughters of
[1:53:24] men Cain's
[1:53:26] daughters the daughters of
[1:53:30] men and the sons of God which were
[1:53:33] Adam's lineage
[1:53:36] death saw the daughters of men and what
[1:53:39] did they do they began to
[1:53:42] intertwine and to mix it
[1:53:46] again you understand why he says under
[1:53:50] no
[1:53:53] circumstances believer marry an
[1:53:56] [Music]
[1:53:58] unbeliever
[1:54:01] of they're mixing all the
[1:54:05] time he had injected himself into the
[1:54:08] human
[1:54:09] race and that's exactly the same way
[1:54:12] that Satan got through the serpent got
[1:54:14] to
[1:54:18] Eve and got to Eve by seducing her is
[1:54:24] the same
[1:54:26] way that the daughters of
[1:54:29] men the sons of God found them really
[1:54:35] attractive she began or they began to
[1:54:38] seduce
[1:54:39] them the same because they came from the
[1:54:41] same
[1:54:42] tree no now watch why I say
[1:54:45] this what was Satan
[1:54:48] after the god
[1:54:52] he wants to be worshiped he wanted to be
[1:54:55] the one that was
[1:54:57] worshiped and he has accomplished
[1:55:02] it the majority of the church World
[1:55:06] worship
[1:55:08] Satan and they don't even know
[1:55:14] it he is the god of his
[1:55:17] Eden the god of this evil
[1:55:21] age Satan
[1:55:23] himself 2 Thessalonians 2:3 and 4 we
[1:55:26] know this very
[1:55:28] well it talks about the man of sin to be
[1:55:33] revealed but then let's go on to the
[1:55:36] exposition we start with the fact that
[1:55:39] there were two trees in the midst of the
[1:55:42] garden the tree of life was
[1:55:46] Jesus it was Christ the the other tree
[1:55:50] is definitely
[1:55:52] Satan but he got that because of what
[1:55:56] came forth of the fruit of that
[1:55:59] tree we know that both of those trees
[1:56:02] had Rel a relationship to
[1:56:05] man or they would never have been placed
[1:56:09] there they must have had a part in The
[1:56:12] Sovereign
[1:56:14] plan and purpose of God in their
[1:56:18] relationship
[1:56:21] to in the relationship to
[1:56:23] Mankind and to
[1:56:25] himself or we would never impute
[1:56:28] omniscience unto
[1:56:33] God no it was the degradation of
[1:56:36] humanity by intermingling the
[1:56:46] seed okay now watch how tremendous this
[1:56:49] is
[1:56:51] this will prove that Satan was that
[1:56:52] other
[1:56:54] tree and and I'm just going to go real
[1:56:57] quick on this okay we were we were
[1:56:59] hitting this last when we had talked
[1:57:01] there had the ministerial conference in
[1:57:06] Africa Ezekiel
[1:57:08] 28 word of the Lord came unto me saying
[1:57:11] then we're going to go to verse two son
[1:57:12] of man say unto the prince of Tyrus thus
[1:57:15] sayith the Lord
[1:57:18] God
[1:57:21] thus sayith the Lord
[1:57:23] God because thine heart is lifted up and
[1:57:25] thou has said I am a
[1:57:31] God I sit in the seat of
[1:57:34] God in the midst of the Seas which is
[1:57:37] people yet thou art a
[1:57:40] man and not God though thou set thine
[1:57:44] heart as the heart of
[1:57:48] God
[1:57:50] who is the heart of
[1:57:53] God Jesus amen very Heart Of
[1:57:58] God Tyrus was a
[1:58:02] king he also wanted to be a
[1:58:06] God why because he was anointed by that
[1:58:12] tree it was the spirit or the tree that
[1:58:15] he was a branch off
[1:58:18] of
[1:58:20] verse 12 son of man take up a
[1:58:24] lamentation upon the king of
[1:58:27] Tyrus and say unto him thus sayith the
[1:58:30] Lord
[1:58:31] God thou seest up the sum full of wisdom
[1:58:34] and perfect in
[1:58:39] Beauty watch verse 13 thou H has been in
[1:58:43] Eden the Garden of
[1:58:47] God wait wait wait a minute he's talking
[1:58:49] to a
[1:58:51] King that thinks he's the king of the
[1:58:55] jungle King Kong he thinks he is the a
[1:59:02] God but in all
[1:59:05] reality how could that man king
[1:59:09] Tyrus I don't know how old he
[1:59:12] was whether he was 50 60 years old 70 I
[1:59:15] don't
[1:59:16] know but how could he have been in Eden
[1:59:22] you think about that know you have how
[1:59:25] could he have been in
[1:59:28] Eden he's saying son of man tell him
[1:59:31] thou has been in
[1:59:34] Eden because he wasn't talking to King
[1:59:39] Tyrus he was talking to the spirit that
[1:59:42] had come into
[1:59:46] King the same tree that was in Eden the
[1:59:51] same one he's talking
[1:59:53] to in
[1:59:55] Eden
[1:59:57] beautiful every precious stone was thy
[2:00:02] covering he goes on and says there was
[2:00:04] prepared when thou was
[2:00:07] created and thou art the anointed cherub
[2:00:10] that
[2:00:12] cover wasn't talking to that
[2:00:14] man was the spirit behind him that was
[2:00:18] the tree
[2:00:20] watch this thou was perfect in thy
[2:00:23] ways from the day that thou was
[2:00:27] created till iniquity was found in
[2:00:31] thee Ezekiel 31 now watch this watch how
[2:00:35] how all these
[2:00:37] things trees are
[2:00:41] spirits yes or
[2:00:44] Yes trees are
[2:00:47] persons trees are men
[2:00:53] if you don't get this you're not you'll
[2:00:55] never understand the Book of
[2:01:00] Genesis of every tree of the garden you
[2:01:03] may freely
[2:01:05] eat and then it's got a
[2:01:08] semicolon but of the tree that's in the
[2:01:11] midst don't need of that tree ah there
[2:01:15] were fruit trees that they could eat off
[2:01:18] of but that was one thing to the
[2:01:22] Natural because trees are
[2:01:25] natural but trees are also
[2:01:29] spiritual and when he's talking to King
[2:01:32] Tyrus he's talking to the
[2:01:35] spirit the tree he's talking
[2:01:38] about that's why he says the Tree of
[2:01:41] Life Is
[2:01:43] Christ oh put it we got to put all this
[2:01:47] together watch verse three
[2:01:50] behold the Assyrian was a cedar in
[2:01:54] Lebanon with Fair
[2:01:56] branches with a shadowing
[2:01:59] shroud High stature pop was among the

[2:02:15] high with her Rivers Running round about
[2:02:19] his
[2:02:20] plants and sent out her little Rivers
[2:02:23] unto all the trees of the
[2:02:27] field watch verse eight the cedars in
[2:02:30] the garden of
[2:02:33] God could not hide
[2:02:35] him the fur trees were not like his
[2:02:38] boughs or
[2:02:41] branches and the chestnut trees were not
[2:02:43] like his
[2:02:45] branches nor any tree in the garden of
[2:02:48] God
[2:02:50] God was like unto him in
[2:02:58] his verse N I have made him fair by the
[2:03:02] multitude of his
[2:03:06] branches so that all the trees plural of
[2:03:12] Eden that were in the garden of
[2:03:15] God envied
[2:03:17] him so there were lots of
[2:03:20] trees once again and those trees were
[2:03:24] spirits and why did they envy
[2:03:27] him because he incarnate in the
[2:03:34] serpent cuz they all want a body to get
[2:03:39] into and they envied him who is this one

[2:04:37] Trees of

[2:04:44] the Trees of Eden unto the nether parts
[2:04:46] of the
[2:04:47] Earth

[2:05:21] okay it was a lust for
[2:05:25] power life is a
[2:05:27] power but the tree of knowledge of Good
[2:05:30] and Evil is also a
[2:05:33] power but it's a perverted
[2:05:36] power and Satan has lusted for power
[2:05:40] from the
[2:05:43] beginning and he anoints people with the
[2:05:46] same lust for power
[2:05:50] we live in a world where everyone lust
[2:05:53] for
[2:05:54] power everyone lusts to be in
[2:05:58] control everyone wants power over
[2:06:01] someone
[2:06:05] else the husband wants to have power
[2:06:07] over the
[2:06:09] wife the wife wants to have power over
[2:06:12] the
[2:06:13] husband the children want to have
[2:06:17] power the nation are lusting for
[2:06:21] power the church lusts for
[2:06:27] power I didn't say the bride I said the
[2:06:30] church because they all want to be
[2:06:39] God's who was the first one to sin let
[2:06:41] me
[2:06:45] see first one to sin
[2:06:47] ever
[2:06:49] Lucifer right Lucifer sin started in
[2:06:54] heaven was it money fame or
[2:07:04] women he wanted Fame right he wanted to
[2:07:08] be like God he wanted everyone to know
[2:07:10] him as
[2:07:13] that that's it's no different
[2:07:15] today
[2:07:17] spirit
[2:07:19] ministers trying to be somebody somebody
[2:07:22] big somebody notice
[2:07:26] me a lust for
[2:07:30] power if we ever use this
[2:07:33] Pulpit personal
[2:07:36] gain or to pound on
[2:07:38] somebody or put out our Personal
[2:07:44] Agenda L for
[2:07:47] power oh yeah he's got a strong
[2:07:50] arm that's not the way the Holy Ghost
[2:07:53] was going to lead the
[2:07:55] church a man that's leading the
[2:07:59] church the Holy Ghost it is the tree of
[2:08:03] life that is leading his
[2:08:06] church but the regular
[2:08:09] church is the tree of knowledge of Good
[2:08:11] and
[2:08:12] Evil he's controlling the
[2:08:15] church church you got to see these
[2:08:17] things
[2:08:19] notice this now it's a lust for power
[2:08:22] because they all want to be want to have
[2:08:26] power when he's talking about this it's
[2:08:29] so tremendous because when you really
[2:08:32] look at
[2:08:33] it even never was deceived by
[2:08:39] sex it wasn't sex that got her to to
[2:08:46] fall of course he knew nothing about
[2:08:49] that but what was it it was the lust for
[2:08:55] power that's what got
[2:09:00] herur oh it wasn't just the serpent that
[2:09:04] said oh how could Adam do that and I
[2:09:11] can't but when he started messing with
[2:09:14] her don't you think she began to think
[2:09:20] what about
[2:09:22] me notice what the Bible
[2:09:27] says Genesis 3:4 and the serpent said
[2:09:31] unto the woman ye shall not surely
[2:09:39] die Genesis
[2:09:42] 3:4 for God does know that in the day ye
[2:09:45] eat
[2:09:47] thereof then your eyes shall be
[2:09:50] open and ye shall be as God's knowing
[2:09:54] good and
[2:09:55] evil he's trying to graft her into his
[2:10:00] tree notice this
[2:10:03] now he was showing her of a
[2:10:07] power that she could obtain
[2:10:11] easily through pleasure and Lust For of
[2:10:14] the
[2:10:16] flesh she never lusted for the sex
[2:10:22] part even though that was part of
[2:10:24] Satan's
[2:10:27] scheme but she lusted for
[2:10:32] knowledge you shall be as God's
[2:10:38] knowing knowledge is
[2:10:43] power but what kind of
[2:10:45] power there's a quote from Brother
[2:10:47] brandham
[2:10:49] I have heard many times I have repeated
[2:10:52] it I've heard many repeated and that was
[2:10:56] that Satan designed the
[2:10:59] woman and I always had the question on
[2:11:03] that how did he design
[2:11:07] her was he designing her when made the
[2:11:11] flesh I heard Minister say that was
[2:11:15] designing her so that she looked very
[2:11:17] sexy
[2:11:18] sexy but that that don't sit right
[2:11:23] with I believe what the prophet of God
[2:11:26] said but how did he design
[2:11:30] her was he there when God pulled the rib
[2:11:33] out and he had some say in
[2:11:37] it that's nonsense Genesis chapter 2
[2:11:41] let's see what what the Bible
[2:11:44] says verse 21 and the Lord God caused a
[2:11:46] deep sleep to fall upon
[2:11:50] Adam and he slept and he took one of his
[2:11:53] ribs and closed up the flesh
[2:11:57] thereof and the rib which the Lord God
[2:11:59] had taken from
[2:12:02] man made he a woman and brought her unto
[2:12:09] the man I don't see where Satan was
[2:12:12] there and had anything to do
[2:12:15] with and Adam said
[2:12:18] this is now bone of my
[2:12:21] bone and Flesh of My Flesh if he
[2:12:24] designed
[2:12:28] her then how could she continue be to be
[2:12:31] bone of his bone and flesh of his
[2:12:34] fles she shall be called woman because
[2:12:36] she was taken out of
[2:12:38] man I don't don't see Satan here
[2:12:40] designing her in that
[2:12:43] way the designing of the
[2:12:47] woman is the
[2:12:50] deformation of her
[2:12:56] character you say how why do you say
[2:12:59] that because they had a
[2:13:02] veil they were both naked they
[2:13:06] hadil so she there was no reason for her
[2:13:08] to try to act
[2:13:11] sexy sexy there was no reason to try to
[2:13:14] to to to get ad him in that
[2:13:16] way they had
[2:13:20] innocence when he began to talk to
[2:13:23] her through the ear came
[2:13:26] forth and he began to deform
[2:13:29] her and he began to tell her about how
[2:13:32] life can
[2:13:34] come he began to deform her
[2:13:37] character the very things that God had
[2:13:40] placed inside of
[2:13:42] her sacred
[2:13:45] virtue sacred motherhood
[2:13:49] sacred
[2:13:51] Womanhood he was deforming those
[2:13:55] things how he began to design
[2:13:59] her in a way that she could be
[2:14:03] attractive that she could make man
[2:14:07] fall what was it the lust for
[2:14:13] power the lust to have
[2:14:16] control the lust
[2:14:19] to no longer have a man
[2:14:22] over come on now and when he talks about
[2:14:25] the designing of the
[2:14:27] woman he's not just talking about
[2:14:30] Eve he's talking about the
[2:14:32] church he has designed the
[2:14:35] church in a way to where she being
[2:14:40] controlled by that
[2:14:42] tree are worshiping
[2:14:44] him they don't even know it
[2:14:49] uhoh uhoh now we can stay on that for a
[2:14:53] while but remember the sacred
[2:14:56] virt she can say yes or
[2:15:00] no the sacred
[2:15:05] Womanhood is her
[2:15:07] conduct her character around
[2:15:12] men how she treats her
[2:15:15] husband and is being honorable to him
[2:15:19] sacred
[2:15:21] motherhood how she raises her
[2:15:24] children now remember when we see
[2:15:28] this we see how the design
[2:15:32] happened heed
[2:15:34] her and he
[2:15:38] continues he continues to deform
[2:15:41] her through a lust for
[2:15:44] power now listen closely Church Daniel
[2:15:48] 12:4 we know this by heart brother
[2:15:50] brother brother Abraham he hits this has
[2:15:53] hit this so many times
[2:15:55] andiel at the end knowledge shall
[2:15:58] increase we know those
[2:16:00] things knowledge shall
[2:16:04] increase but man wants his own
[2:16:07] know his own wisdom rather than
[2:16:11] God's and Satan wanted fair and square
[2:16:14] in the Garden of
[2:16:15] Eden yeah
[2:16:19] he wanted
[2:16:20] s Amen in the message saying
[2:16:23] zeden the lust of e for
[2:16:27] sin and he goes then if Eve lusted for
[2:16:33] knowledge it was
[2:16:36] sin and when we lust for
[2:16:40] knowledge PhD lld
[2:16:43] D sin to do so that's a strong statement
[2:16:47] but it's it's the truth no matter how
[2:16:50] strong it
[2:16:51] is still the truth the lust for
[2:16:54] knowledge for
[2:16:57] understanding the thing of it is today
[2:17:00] he says we don't try to establish the
[2:17:03] word of God in the people's
[2:17:07] hearts we're trying to establish
[2:17:11] ourselves chur are trying to establish
[2:17:14] the doctrine of the
[2:17:16] church
[2:17:21] in a person's
[2:17:23] heart we're commanded to establish the
[2:17:27] word to establish the word Paul says I
[2:17:31] didn't come to you with enticing
[2:17:37] words that your faith might rest upon in
[2:17:39] the knowledge of
[2:17:44] man but I come to you in power
[2:17:50] manifestations of the Holy Ghost that
[2:17:53] your faith might rest in
[2:17:57] God I like that we must not establish
[2:18:04] ourselves you hear somebody trying to
[2:18:10] establish because they seek for
[2:18:12] knowledge they seek for power and the
[2:18:16] power of the Holy Ghost is from their
[2:18:20] lives that's the
[2:18:23] problem many so-called
[2:18:26] Christians problem with so many
[2:18:28] so-called message
[2:18:32] Believers come to a place where they
[2:18:34] have so much
[2:18:37] knowledge and yet their lives are
[2:18:43] powerless we got power because we got
[2:18:46] knowledge
[2:18:50] perverted that's why oh there are errors
[2:18:53] in the Bible there are
[2:18:56] errors you have such a powerless
[2:18:59] life because you think you know
[2:19:02] something
[2:19:08] wow they live like the world they'll
[2:19:10] learn like the
[2:19:12] world but wait till
[2:19:16] something come on now we may think we
[2:19:19] have it all together wait till something
[2:19:22] happens wait till the doctor says you
[2:19:25] have six months to
[2:19:27] live then all your knowledge for
[2:19:31] what you better have something more than
[2:19:33] just
[2:19:35] knowledge you better be connected to the
[2:19:37] Tree of
[2:19:39] Life Christ because if not you're
[2:19:42] connected to the other
[2:19:44] tree oh my Lord Lord help us this
[2:19:47] morning
[2:19:48] we want to make sure we're right with
[2:19:50] the
[2:19:51] Lord Death comes knocking at the
[2:19:54] door they come running looking for
[2:19:57] help I thought you had
[2:20:04] power anybody knows who's who Anton L
[2:20:09] is anybody knew that that was he was the
[2:20:12] founder of the Church of
[2:20:15] Satan he wrote the
[2:20:19] Bible but when he was on his death
[2:20:22] bed his last words were
[2:20:25] this oh my oh
[2:20:29] my what have I
[2:20:31] done there's something very wrong
[2:20:35] there's something very wrong there's
[2:20:37] something very wrong passes
[2:20:41] on all the knowledge and the ideas and
[2:20:45] that thought he was he was doing
[2:20:49] realiz he was attached to the tree of
[2:20:55] knowledge thought he had done something
[2:20:58] good he realized it
[2:21:01] was you see this in how many more people
[2:21:05] today are in such a
[2:21:08] condition because they thought following
[2:21:10] the message was to learn all the
[2:21:13] quotes it's okay learn as many learn
[2:21:17] scriptures you can but that doesn't get
[2:21:20] that's not
[2:21:23] it though we understand all Mysteries
[2:21:26] the Bible
[2:21:28] says have not
[2:21:30] charity get the sounding brass and a
[2:21:33] tinkling
[2:21:34] symbol will sit in church for year after
[2:21:37] year after
[2:21:39] year and we deceived in church thinking
[2:21:43] we've got it that we got the Holy
[2:21:46] Ghost million miles from the Holy
[2:21:50] Ghost oh Lord help us this
[2:21:53] morning I'm not mad at anyone I'm mad at
[2:21:56] the
[2:21:57] Devil he deceived because of a lust for
[2:22:03] power but as many has received this is
[2:22:05] what Christ says as many has received
[2:22:08] him to them gave he
[2:22:12] power what is the greatest power that
[2:22:14] you can
[2:22:16] receive
[2:22:18] to pray for the sick and they
[2:22:20] recover come on Church the greatest
[2:22:22] power is it you pray for somebody that's
[2:22:24] dead and they raise
[2:22:26] up yeah we think that I want to see
[2:22:30] Miracles I don't want to see it's okay
[2:22:33] but that's not the greatest
[2:22:35] power the greatest
[2:22:37] power to them gave he
[2:22:41] power to become sons of
[2:22:45] God that's the greatest power
[2:22:48] because when you have become a Son of
[2:22:51] God you know the next
[2:22:54] step
[2:22:58] godship this this morning come on that's
[2:23:01] what we're after that's where we're
[2:23:03] going ye are
[2:23:07] Gods this is no joke this is not some
[2:23:11] fairy
[2:23:13] tale this is not some church doctrine
[2:23:18] though it's part of the
[2:23:20] doctrine this is
[2:23:25] life we become sons of
[2:23:28] God then comes the restoration of the
[2:23:32] godship for this tree of life which is
[2:23:35] the groom
[2:23:36] tree has a bride and he works through
[2:23:39] her
[2:23:41] today that is his body today I'm
[2:23:43] finishing now that is his body today
[2:23:47] Proverbs
[2:23:49] 3:18 she is the Tree of
[2:23:54] Life the woman was a tree of
[2:23:57] death because every man born of a woman
[2:24:00] is a few days and full of
[2:24:04] troubles but this is not talking about a
[2:24:09] church about his
[2:24:11] bride she is a tree of
[2:24:15] life then
[2:24:18] that lay hold upon
[2:24:21] her and happy is everyone that retaineth
[2:24:29] her she's the only one that has this
[2:24:33] power she don't lust for
[2:24:36] power she has the power because she
[2:24:42] is I'm going to say it again she is him
[2:24:46] is
[2:24:48] you want to receive that power be humble
[2:24:51] open your heart up him don't make it
[2:24:54] harder than it
[2:24:56] is but when you come to church come for
[2:24:58] a
[2:24:59] reason and then when you go
[2:25:02] home go home for a
[2:25:05] reason open your heart your mind your
[2:25:08] being
[2:25:09] to those two trees were
[2:25:14] intertwined yes but that tree
[2:25:18] that was to be restored at the
[2:25:21] end that tree is that bright tree we can
[2:25:25] go through the three stages of Grace and
[2:25:27] how the tree res how it came up
[2:25:33] again notice this now watch watch what
[2:25:35] brother Bram
[2:25:37] says sure those Pentecostal
[2:25:40] women they can be saved Sanctified and
[2:25:42] filled with the Holy
[2:25:45] Ghost
[2:25:47] and then
[2:25:50] fail I've been Sanctified brother
[2:25:53] Justified
[2:25:55] Sanctified and you still
[2:25:58] fail because you failed to
[2:26:01] listen he was telling what was
[2:26:06] up she was lusting for
[2:26:08] power when you see people oh Lord give
[2:26:11] me
[2:26:13] gifts what are you L me what are you
[2:26:16] trying to do
[2:26:20] get the Holy Ghost and then his life in
[2:26:23] you move what he has already placed in
[2:26:26] you and then it'll be him that is using
[2:26:30] the gift instead of
[2:26:33] you that's the problem we're all all
[2:26:35] trying to find out I want to do this and
[2:26:38] I want to do that you're L for someone
[2:26:41] else's
[2:26:43] position lust for power
[2:26:47] brother will come to the come to the to
[2:26:50] the piano or I'm not ever going to
[2:26:51] finish but I have to finish with
[2:26:55] this it's so
[2:26:58] important to understand where we are who
[2:27:02] we are what we are where we're
[2:27:06] going you're not going to make it on
[2:27:08] your own
[2:27:11] Works our own works
[2:27:15] are but we're striving for something
[2:27:19] greater not for more
[2:27:22] knowledge so we can say we know more
[2:27:24] than anyone
[2:27:26] else
[2:27:29] noing be more like
[2:27:33] him we must come God's
[2:27:37] way and his way says this unless we
[2:27:44] suffer
[2:27:45] cannot
[2:27:50] come
[2:27:55] on we suffer with
[2:27:58] him we cannot reign with
[2:28:02] him you have to suffer to
[2:28:05] reain and the reason for this is that
[2:28:09] character simply is never made without
[2:28:13] suffering watch what Satan what what
[2:28:16] Satan Des designed her he
[2:28:18] deformed her
[2:28:21] character character is a victory not a
[2:28:25] gift and a man without character cannot
[2:28:30] Reign because power apart from
[2:28:35] character is
[2:28:37] satanic watch the trees inter
[2:28:41] intermingling power with
[2:28:44] character is fit to rule
[2:28:49] stand to your feet if you will don't you
[2:28:51] know that ye are
[2:28:55] God
[2:28:58] he he whom the word of God
[2:29:07] came he are
[2:29:09] God he whom the
[2:29:13] logos the Christ has come to
[2:29:17] he are
[2:29:19] God and he's come here for
[2:29:22] our
[2:29:26] benefit and a person that is fully
[2:29:29] surrendered to
[2:29:32] God is
[2:29:36] omnipotent omnipotent means all
[2:29:40] powerful not on her own not
[2:29:42] because because of him because of the
[2:29:45] Tree of Life
[2:29:48] and he's got guards at this
[2:29:51] tree and he guards the way to the tree
[2:29:54] of
[2:29:55] life now you young people maybe can
[2:29:59] say well my mama and my
[2:30:02] dad and I'm this way because my
[2:30:08] grandpa you used to be able to say those
[2:30:12] things not no
[2:30:14] more because the same two
[2:30:17] trees that were in the
[2:30:19] garden are the same two

[2:30:36] anymore take responsibility for your you

[2:30:47] because we have him it's not to show
[2:30:50] off it's not for that it's to it's to
