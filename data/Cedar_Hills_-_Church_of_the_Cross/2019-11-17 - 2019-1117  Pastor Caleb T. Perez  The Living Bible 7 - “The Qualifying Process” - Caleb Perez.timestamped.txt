[19:31] Christ is the cure and the only cure in
[19:37] this he cares for us He loves us and he
[19:44] wants us to come to him God made us that
[19:47] way that holy thing innocent wants to be
[19:51] comforted God gave man a wife to comfort
[19:55] him the touchy any man knows it's got a
[20:01] good life
[20:02] there's something about a good wife that
[20:06] can a man be upset in his business or
[20:09] areas of walks of life and can come home
[20:12] no matter there's no one no doctor it is
[20:16] that way with me when I come from
[20:19] overseas or somewhere and I'm so nervous
[20:22] and upset and lost of sleeping and
[20:25] you're the crime scene the little hungry
[20:27] children on the street and they're all
[20:29] crying and going on it just kills me
[20:33] that I want to come home if wife will
[20:35] sit down on the arm of the chair put her
[20:37] arm around me and say Oh bill I
[20:40] understand that you know just a few
[20:42] little pets from the wife mean so much
[20:45] same thing your husband too alive that's
[20:48] the way God wanted to be haven't we shut
[20:52] the toots something father you'll get
[20:57] some other woman to try to take that
[20:58] place or some other way you see what you
[21:02] do
[21:03] now why you give us friends he loves we
[21:08] we should be friends we should be
[21:09] brothers and how that it's good to go to
[21:12] a good friend in time of trouble and say
[21:15] oh friend of mine certain certain things
[21:19] has happened and a good trusted friend
[21:22] to sit down and talk with you that's
[21:25] wonderful that's of God just like your
[21:27] wife is of God your husband when your
[21:30] true but it's got so in even man
[21:33] destroys fallen nature he did great that
[21:37] that God give him first thing he took
[21:42] the bottle are the world that gave him
[21:45] comfort instead of the Holy Spirit God
[21:48] give him a wife that these nice
[21:50] companion and he's not satisfied with
[21:53] Lonnie has to get another and another
[21:56] vice versa T the woman to the man young
[21:59] people and so forth even all those
[22:01] comforters that the Lord has given us
[22:03] when it comes down to the end of the
[22:06] journey and we are pressing a pillow
[22:10] against our fevered brow and dying our
[22:14] wife can only spend the tears run down
[22:17] her face with her eyes up towards God
[22:20] our friend can Pat us on the shoulder
[22:23] shake our hands and stand wringing his
[22:26] hands because he can go no farther but
[22:30] then when the comforter as David said
[22:34] yea though I walk through the valley of
[22:37] the shadow of death I'll fear no evil
[22:39] dark with me thy rod and thy staff they
[22:43] comfort me
[22:45] even some valley of the shadows of death
[22:49] I is it men thirst and hunger because
[22:53] when he was made he was made and created
[22:57] with a little place in him the God dwell
[23:00] to comfort him
[23:01] I want to shucks yourself away from God
[23:04] by sin then that place is vacant and
[23:08] that's why hunger and far-reaching part
[23:11] in the trouble today with us Christians
[23:14] I'm afraid for not doing all we can do
[23:16] to show our fallen brother that that's
[23:19] what's the matter with him that's what's
[23:21] the matter with juvenile delinquency is
[23:24] because there's been a delinquency in
[23:26] the church and a delinquency in the home
[23:28] that's made the juvenile delinquency
[23:31] that's the reasons to beat next and so
[23:34] forth all the streets are jumping up and
[23:36] down and going all these things that
[23:38] because they're trying to find something
[23:42] dissatisfied let me say this tonight is
[23:46] the name of the Lord Jesus there's
[23:48] nothing no status I like the coming of
[23:51] the power of the Holy Ghost that will
[23:52] change your life
[23:53] and your attitudes and give you comfort
[23:56] and eternal there is a fountain filled
[24:00] with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins
[24:03] when sinners plunged beneath that flood
[24:05] lose all their guilty stains a wife
[24:08] might comfort and pet a friend might
[24:11] stead how to give good advice but
[24:14] there's only one thing that can take
[24:16] away say that that's of God Lord Jesus
[24:19] what can take away my sins nothing but
[24:22] the blood of Jesus what can make me
[24:24] whole again nothing but the blood of
[24:27] Jesus as the writer said all precious is
[24:30] that float that makes me why there's no
[24:33] no other fount I know nothing but the
[24:36] blood of Jesus that's it that cleanses
[24:39] and purifies and brings in a fellowship

[36:14] that they believed that the experience
[36:17] that they had had in Azusa Street was
[36:19] real crazy Eric Ellis / NC akhirin in

[1:28:41] authenticity of those three Gospels
[1:28:44] love to see Dan they assist area Sara
[1:28:46] Helios this is not somebody later on
[1:28:48] that was a smart why scribe or something

[1:28:56] those other Gospels he couldn't ask you

[1:29:35] anti-federal howl alopecia other three
[1:29:37] what was today talked about after that
[1:29:39] time means your hundred John the Baptist
[1:29:41] had gone now
[1:29:42] means you know this was they they want
[1:29:45] to see me today
[1:29:46] one Matthew and Luke provide is the
[1:29:49] genealogy of Jesus you know like you
[1:29:51] know here Matthew starts with Abraham
[1:29:53] might come in second while Luke goes
[1:29:55] back to Adam he look us regress a stir
[1:29:57] done John understood one in the deal
[1:30:01] that he had to show in his writings if
[1:30:03] they make a most honest with us not just
[1:30:05] a natural genealogy no no here solo not
[1:30:08] to that but that Jesus was God who's
[1:30:11] there are the earth that's why John
[1:30:13] starts his book on commune says to leave
[1:30:16] it all and he goes to the genealogy of
[1:30:18] the world in the beginning el principio
[1:30:22] was the word the Word was God and the
[1:30:27] Word was God and the word became flesh
[1:30:31] he was proving doctor what balls three
[1:30:34] were true he put the other part atop
[1:30:39] wouldn't allow that but Jesus had come
[1:30:40] battle of the logos yes indeed opponent
[1:30:43] logos went back to the beginning you
[1:30:45] like the soul principio but a most Randy
[1:30:48] abstract title deed to another but it
[1:30:54] started in the mind of documents
[1:30:56] ornamental is yours

[1:31:02] this is Sunday school hello many kind
[1:31:05] this this excites me mister
[1:31:08] know where I'm at anymore no standing on
[1:31:09] the end oh yeah praise God
[1:31:11] watch this now you can see this leads to
[1:31:14] the farther conclusion four Gospels were
[1:31:18] included que las cuatro a Makino's for
[1:31:20] daily those boy and we owe their
[1:31:22] authority the van was loaded on place
[1:31:25] yeah lugar within the Canon of
[1:31:26] scriptures Alaska Torah we owe it to st.
[1:31:30] John to someone if you read history is
[1:31:33] leyla history doesn't tell you the story
[1:31:36] alive I still constantine constant steam
[1:31:38] and then 325 AD gather but they add the
[1:31:42] Bible's video is the truth in history
[1:31:46] I don't know about that because what
[1:31:49] people don't get for Kayla Kayla Hinton
[1:31:51] oh is that the reason they chose those
[1:31:53] who hear the Holy Spirit had already
[1:31:56] chosen them to yellow Sevilla how did
[1:31:59] they know ecommerce at the end because
[1:32:00] they had heard Irene yes in the century
[1:32:03] before no idea on it and I realize had
[1:32:06] heard it all from the century before
[1:32:08] Dylan tell you're wrong that's what they
[1:32:11] followed it looked as they'll be able to
[1:32:12] put into the Canon of Scripture dude as
[1:32:17] four Gospels ever Helios
[1:32:20] it is not left the writer says is Leonor
[1:32:24] puesto it was not left up to Constantine
[1:32:26] no father had or any other
[1:32:28] post-apostolic figure enough you could
[1:32:31] have post only to decide which gospel
[1:32:33] should be included or excluded only when
[1:32:34] I see the cameras no one that had the
[1:32:37] authority to do such Daniela to the
[1:32:41] oppressor that was the Holy Spirit LSP
[1:32:43] to son through an eyewitness at resident
[1:32:45] st go which was sanctioned by the holy
[1:32:47] spirit we press the point is Peters
[1:32:49] through a man as you know was the last
[1:32:52] surviving apostle Guerra el
[1:32:53] sobreviviente will team and companion of
[1:32:56] Jesus Christ himself he a companion tell
[1:32:58] us miss man as the books were selected
[1:33:01] for inclusion in selection critical
[1:33:04] Christian critical questions were asked
[1:33:06] they're going to skip because we're on a
[1:33:08] chest was a book written by an apostle
[1:33:09] see phrase Crito por una postal or an
[1:33:12] associate of an apostle of Jesus own
[1:33:14] associa postal the hizzouse was written
[1:33:16] near the time that Christ lived and died
[1:33:19] joseph ways quito los tiempos cercano
[1:33:21] snake on
[1:33:22] and the reasons for rejecting these
[1:33:26] other Gospels confirm - but it's just
[1:33:28] not
[1:33:29] estos autosave Arcadia's compelling is
[1:33:31] that the main criticism and liquidity
[1:33:36] come of while other Gospels were
[1:33:38] excluded but killers are healers one is
[1:33:40] Chloe dose was simply this was
[1:33:43] implemented per se because the Jesus
[1:33:45] that they depict is not recognizable no
[1:33:51] record no speedo as the Jesus in the for
[1:33:53] Gus come on has used a las cuatro Helios
[1:33:56] o water requirement hey Ricky Seto I'm
[1:34:01] gonna say that again I don't know
[1:34:03] there's got that or not because these
[1:34:05] other Gospels that were written in this
[1:34:08] because then it's later portrayed Jesus
[1:34:10] in a certain light so I'm impervious to
[1:34:12] Sinatra loose but it did not match to
[1:34:14] the same Jesus I don't know in con el
[1:34:17] mismo is Matthew Mark Luke and John
[1:34:20] isn't that the same way today the whole
[1:34:24] religious world and the pole mundo
[1:34:26] really hill climbing that they have
[1:34:28] Jesus Jesus Jesus noticed even neither
[1:34:34] you know why I am porque because they
[1:34:36] could not produce for cannot produce the
[1:34:38] same Jesus you Mark Luke and John
[1:34:41] they're not their new test one but here
[1:34:43] comes a prophet in our days doc you know
