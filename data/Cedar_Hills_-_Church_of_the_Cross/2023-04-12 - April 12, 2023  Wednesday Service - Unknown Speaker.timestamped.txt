[28:53] [Music]
[29:06] thank you
[29:37] hello everyone brother Mike Carroll from
[29:39] Phoenix Arizona
[29:44] Phoenix Arizona testimonial
[29:49] 20 with my experience and
[29:54] Uganda experience
[30:00] first off everything that I had heard
[30:02] prior to making the trip
[30:11] as far as how life-changing the trip
[30:14] could be for someone
[30:22] uh uh with that I I built up an
[30:25] expectation
[30:30] but when I arrived in country
[30:34] it was everything I'd expected
[30:44] times ten it's very hard
[30:50] to put into words
[30:52] but I'll try uh the people
[30:56] that we came in
[31:08] contact with the pastors the ministry
[31:11] our team in Uganda Los pastures in
[31:19] Uganda
[31:20] we're the most humble and gracious
[31:22] people I've ever met in my life
[31:32] what they deal with on a day-to-day
[31:34] basis
[31:39] didn't hear any crying or murmuring
[31:53] you heard was joy and expectation
[32:03] conferences that we were able to hold
[32:06] while we were there with the pastors
[32:08] pastores
[32:13] ministers although they were they're
[32:16] quiet people
[32:18] on a day-to-day basis when it came to
[32:22] serving and worshiping the Lord
[32:27] they were the loudest people I'd ever
[32:28] heard in my life
[32:29] is
[32:45] and it had no problem with expressing
[32:48] how they felt about our Lord and Savior
[32:51] Jesus Christ is
[33:07] you know when we it came time for us to
[33:09] leave
[33:11] they continue to say thank you and thank
[33:14] you and thank you
[33:16] gracias
[33:25] and I and I had to express to them that
[33:28] I owed them to thank you
[33:37] because it was a
[33:39] probably more of a learning experience
[33:41] for me
[33:45] experience
[33:48] than it was for them
[33:51] it gave me a totally different
[33:53] perspective
[33:54] mediona perspective
[33:56] differente
[33:59] on what the bride is and who she is
[34:09] Jesus Christ
[34:11] and
[34:13] I will grow from that
[34:15] is
[34:19] I will continue to learn from that and I
[34:21] look forward
[34:23] to the next opportunity that I have to
[34:26] Siempre
[34:27] Co
[34:31] bus
[34:34] to actually make that Journey yes
[34:46] [Applause]
[34:56] foreign
[34:57] I greet you in the name of the Lord
[34:59] Jesus Christ
[35:04] if we could please turn to our
[35:06] scriptures
[35:11] in Mark chapter 16 verse 15.
[35:26] and he said unto them
[35:28] go ye into all the world and preach the
[35:31] gospel to every creature
[35:36] [Music]
[35:41] I'd like to let you know that I was
[35:42] privileged and it was an honor
[35:45] to be able to go with Pastor Caleb
[35:48] and quiero this is
[35:56] the other ministers that went along with
[36:00] him
[36:05] truly was a blessing
[36:12] and from the bottom of my heart to
[36:15] travel with
[36:17] as brother will said
[36:18] the other day
[36:21] that there was 14 of us
[36:31] but we went as one
[36:34] Uno
[36:38] and in the scripture in Acts 2 chapter
[36:46] 2 verse
[36:48] and when the day
[36:56] of Pentecost was fully come
[37:00] they were all with one Accord
[37:03] in one place
[37:13] I was reading the message of brother
[37:15] Branham
[37:16] of questions and answers
[37:24] on the Holy Ghost
[37:26] Santo
[37:30] and this to me
[37:34] is exactly what happened there in Uganda
[37:37] yes
[37:44] Uganda
[37:45] when the day of Pentecost was fully come
[37:48] on
[37:53] they were all in one mind
[37:59] I like that better than one Accord
[38:10] one Accord upon most any subject
[38:13] stemmas
[38:19] but their minds but here their minds was
[38:23] the same
[38:27] one mind
[38:29] and in the same place
[38:34] and to see the interaction with the
[38:38] different brothers that went
[38:40] in companies
[38:49] it was beautiful to see that each and
[38:52] every one of them
[38:54] it didn't matter who we are or where we
[38:57] came from
[39:04] we never went anywhere
[39:07] unless we made sure that we were all
[39:09] accounted for
[39:10] eign
[39:25] we all went together
[39:29] following the leading of the Holy
[39:32] ghosts
[39:35] everything that we did
[39:37] and it was so beautiful to see that is
[39:45] one of the things that impacted me the
[39:48] most
[39:52] that I will always remember yes
[39:57] I remember on Sunday morning we were
[40:00] going to go to
[40:01] Brothers Rogers church
[40:08] it was raining that morning
[40:15] and as we were getting ready to go turn
[40:19] on the road to go up to his church
[40:29] oh the bus
[40:31] couldn't make it up the hill Escalade
[40:39] because of the rain
[40:41] forecast
[41:25] okay
[41:35] thank you
[42:20] amen God bless you all
[42:22] it's a pleasure to be back in the
[42:25] house of the Lord
[42:28] there's nothing like home but um
[42:32] just a pleasure to be behind this Pulpit
[42:34] today yes
[42:38] um there's so much to say with such
[42:40] little time to give
[42:45] it was just amazing to see the love of
[42:48] each one of those Brothers
[42:52] I mean I love that like can't explain
[42:55] like the way they hug you and yes
[43:02] they're such grateful people you see
[43:04] them with nothing but yet they have
[43:06] everything they need
[43:12] and the commitment you see in each every
[43:15] one of these pastors and ministers
[43:19] pastors
[43:21] you would see him packing up in a big
[43:25] cargo truck
[43:30] at least 50 in there and yeah
[43:34] and walking in the rain or and we would
[43:38] drive on our bus and we would just see
[43:39] him
[43:40] the church
[43:43] and it's amazing what our ministry has
[43:46] done over there yes
[43:50] you see these you see these pillars
[43:53] being
[43:54] builtes
[43:57] brother James brother Rogers
[44:02] it's amazing to see how how much they're
[44:06] enthused with the word of God is
[44:13] and and there was a let me just hit the
[44:16] scripture real quick it's John 16 24.
[44:32] here too happy asked nothing in my name
[44:35] asked and ye shall receive that your joy
[44:38] may be full
[44:47] and and the crazy thing is me and
[44:50] brother Tommy were talking about this
[44:54] we will see this these big cows or goats
[44:59] and they were just tied on with just a
[45:00] little old little rope
[45:07] and I said isn't that crazy they have
[45:09] the strength to break through that rope
[45:12] but they just won't do it
[45:17] and he said
[45:19] they're not roped by that rope they're
[45:21] roped in their mind they said
[45:26] and I began to say that's me that was me
[45:29] before I came
[45:32] I was rope by just a little rope
[45:39] I asked myself why am I going look at
[45:42] all this sin you've done
[45:47] you're not worthy no it is
[45:50] a little rope
[45:54] but then God says me
[46:00] and the Rope just went through yes
[46:06] maybe there's some of you with just a
[46:08] little sin again
[46:11] you're not worthy of the word of God
[46:16] you can't do that
[46:18] special
[46:20] who do you think you could change
[46:24] each and one of you know
[46:27] it's just a little old little rope
[46:31] as the devil tells you know
[46:36] voice anymore
[46:42] he's probably the same old lies
[46:46] amen and
[46:49] same old life mentiras
[46:52] and here's a quote with brother Branham
[46:59] it's
[47:00] it takes to overcome all unbelief
[47:06] there's it's chapter 60. now there's a
[47:10] time that a man come to a place
[47:17] where he can have a purpose
[47:21] it's something that will change him
[47:25] and that is when a man meets God yes
[47:30] a man could never be the same if he
[47:32] meets God face to face
[47:40] a day when you got to change
[47:44] it's not easy no especil you got this
[47:48] starts
[47:50] every day saying
[47:53] the word of God
[47:57] I'm just telling you is
[48:00] do anything
[48:03] just ask it in his name
[48:06] amen God bless you ameniga
[48:31] can you hear me yep now you can
[48:34] that's my brother Joe mermano Joe
[48:43] I'm happy to be here and and see you all
[48:45] again
[48:48] I thank the pastor for the confidence
[48:52] I want to start off by reading a
[48:54] scripture if I could
[48:57] it's found in Luke 10 2. we can all
[49:01] please stand
[49:02] and Lucas yes those
[49:05] it says therefore said he unto them
[49:09] to the Harvest truly is great but the
[49:12] labors are few
[49:19] pray ye therefore the lord of the
[49:21] Harvest that he would send forth the
[49:24] labors into his Harvest
[49:29] a man you may be seated
[49:33] I think the I thank the Lord for for
[49:35] allowing me to go to back to Uganda
[49:37] again
[49:40] with the pastor and all the men that
[49:43] that went foreign
[49:56] I
[50:08] got to see the ministers
[50:13] they don't just read the Bible there
[50:17] so brother I think it was brother Jimmy
[50:20] he was teaching a subject
[50:24] and they switch subjects in
[50:28] and as he switched subjects brother
[50:31] Tommy he he uh he yells out the
[50:33] scripture without looking to without
[50:35] looking to his notes or the Bible
[50:41] and brother Jimmy says oh I know
[50:47] and it's just amazing to see that the
[50:50] word isn't just in in Bible form it's in
[50:52] them
[50:57] so my duties up there I was the I was
[51:00] given the great honor yeah
[51:04] of reading scriptures for for my brother
[51:06] Tommy
[51:09] and whole in holding his backpack and
[51:11] carrying his bag around
[51:14] to me it's an honor to do these things
[51:17] some would say it's a small and
[51:20] significant part which is
[51:22] me I remember my life two years ago
[51:35] he made me part of his plan
[51:40] you know I'm a willing servant now yes
[51:44] this time it's to the king
[51:48] you know it it was inspiring seeing Joe
[51:51] and
[51:53] Joe in in brother will up here who's
[51:55] getting ready to come down
[51:59] it was their first missionary trip a
[52:01] supreme uh
[52:05] and seeing the way that I'm sure that
[52:07] they were a little nervous
[52:10] but how obedient to God at such a young
[52:13] age
[52:17] it's just amazing how they listen to
[52:20] that still Small Voice
[52:23] and over in Uganda there's there
[52:26] you would think that it's all desert
[52:30] the greenest place I've ever seen
[52:34] their ground is thick and clean it's
[52:37] like red color es is
[52:42] the ground there is the natural
[52:44] definition of good ground
[52:49] definition
[52:54] over there you saw the brothers when it
[52:56] was as they accepted the message just a
[52:58] few years ago
[53:02] the way they've heard it and they've
[53:04] accepted it and they've shared it is
[53:08] not just the natural definition but
[53:11] they're the spiritual definition of Good
[53:12] Grounds
[53:15] and it's for the seed and that seed is
[53:22] it's been a seed that's been planted
[53:25] over there and it's in those men and
[53:26] it's sprouted
[53:31] and I thank the Lord for allowing me to
[53:33] see his Harvest
[53:38] if he permits me it sure won't be the
[53:40] laughs
[53:42] amen God bless you amen
[53:44] [Applause]
[54:16] amen God bless and every one of you yes
[54:20] [Music]
[54:28] found in Matthew 14 27 and 30.
[54:36] just but straightway Jesus spake unto
[54:38] them
[54:40] Jesus
[54:42] saying be of good cheers
[54:45] it is
[54:49] but when he saw the wind boisterous
[54:54] he was afraid
[54:56] and beginning to think he cried
[55:00] Lord save me
[55:04] amen he may be serious
[55:07] and so I just have a bit of a testimony
[55:09] I'd like to share with each and every
[55:11] one of you
[55:13] first of all I wanna
[55:16] um
[55:17] how my pasture do you see that is you
[55:22] gracias for being there for me foreign
[56:26] and I I can definitely say I'm someone
[56:29] that would love to have that same uh
[56:32] love for the word of God
[56:36] I had such a great time out there in
[56:39] Uganda
[56:41] as you guys saw we made a video
[56:45] I had that privilege to
[56:49] um
[56:50] to capture those memories
[56:55] memories that are so Unforgettable
[56:59] and they're memories that uh we want to
[57:02] hold on to yes
[57:07] just to get right into the testimony
[57:10] testimonial by the grace of God
[57:12] like many of us here
[57:15] I've had the privilege to grow up in
[57:18] this church and in this message
[57:22] I was someone who had a lot of Joy
[57:26] at all our passion for the things of the
[57:29] Lord
[57:31] I love to playing a music for the Lord
[57:39] I love to pray
[57:41] and most of all I love to read my Bible
[57:45] yeah it was a place of healing
[57:49] it was a place of healing
[57:57] as time went on
[58:00] trials and tribulations started to come
[58:05] I soon developed some condition with
[58:08] doctors call this Association
[58:15] meaning disconnected or disconnection is
[58:18] a significant disconnected or this this
[58:21] connection and uh I myself began to feel
[58:24] very disconnected from my surroundings
[58:28] my eyes with dilate
[58:32] making everything feel so unreal
[58:36] like I was living in a constant
[58:39] dreams
[58:41] I began to lose awareness
[58:46] of everything that was going on around
[58:48] me
[58:51] um
[58:51] I began to lose awareness of my own body
[58:55] I lost um
[58:58] I lost sync with my own body
[59:00] synchronization
[59:07] emotionally emotional and spiritually
[59:12] and the boy with a place that used to be
[59:16] well that's not a that's not a great
[59:18] place to be yeah
[59:20] just like I became very disconnected in
[59:23] the natural is
[59:26] I also became very disconnected in the
[59:29] spiritual meaning
[59:31] led me to a very heavy state of
[59:34] depression
[59:37] um
[59:39] uh anxiety took over my life
[59:43] beer overtook me
[59:48] to a state of Brokenness
[59:52] yeah where I felt very shattered
[59:56] where I felt like there was no hope is
[1:00:00] I became very imprisoned into my own
[1:00:03] mind
[1:00:12] the more time I
[1:00:16] I felt this way
[1:00:18] [Music]
[1:00:19] I became very distracted
[1:00:23] distracted with the things of this world
[1:00:28] I found myself not wanting to be at
[1:00:30] church
[1:00:32] not wanting to play or sing for the Lord
[1:00:37] not wanting to read my Bible
[1:00:41] not wanting to pray
[1:00:44] I was called
[1:00:46] and I came to a point of weakness
[1:00:51] but our Prophet tells us
[1:00:54] isn't it strain that God likened us to
[1:00:57] sheep noise
[1:01:00] a sheep is the most helpless thing there
[1:01:03] is
[1:01:06] nothing so insufficient of Defense than
[1:01:09] the Sheep
[1:01:11] a rabbit can run
[1:01:14] a squirrel can defensive
[1:01:33] but that's the way God wants us yes
[1:01:36] realize that we are totally insufficient
[1:01:39] okay
[1:01:43] and he turns us into and he begins to
[1:01:47] mold us he knows MPS
[1:01:48] the person that he wants us to be Allah
[1:01:54] what we can't do okay Nosotros
[1:01:59] it makes us live he makes our lips speak
[1:02:02] what God's lips would speak is
[1:02:11] I'm here to say that I'm nothing is
[1:02:23] for whatever the Lord may need me
[1:02:26] foreign
[1:02:28] [Applause]
[1:02:46] or God so loved the world
[1:02:49] that he gave his only begotten son
[1:02:53] that whosoever believeth in him shall
[1:02:56] not perish
[1:02:58] but have everlasting life
[1:03:01] and I thank the Lord
[1:03:04] that day of redemption foreign
[1:03:46] God pouring out his love
[1:03:50] in our times of Shame and sorrow
[1:03:54] God took my place
[1:03:57] and it should have been myself
[1:04:00] pain the consequences of my own sins
[1:04:04] that's my place
[1:04:09] and by his grace
[1:04:12] with that we're in bondage
[1:04:17] we were set free
[1:04:19] and Redeemed by the blood
[1:04:33] he brought me back from so much weakness
[1:04:37] and that's because he is my strength he
[1:04:40] is
[1:04:50] I have a
[1:04:52] foreign
[1:04:59] it goes like this a dcrc now he cannot
[1:05:02] heal you
[1:05:04] or cannot save you
[1:05:07] or do anything for you
[1:05:09] until first you accept it
[1:05:12] and believe it
[1:05:17] that's right you've got to confess it is
[1:05:20] correct
[1:05:21] it's not that you've got to feel it
[1:05:24] got to confess it is
[1:05:27] not the high priest of your feelings
[1:05:31] he's the high priest of yours
[1:05:38] it's what you confess
[1:05:41] if you believe in healing
[1:05:44] and believe that God has healed
[1:05:49] and God will make your body obey your
[1:05:52] confession
[1:06:06] with his own blood to make intercession
[1:06:09] for any confession upon anything that he
[1:06:11] died
[1:06:19] amen and Isaiah
[1:06:21] 53.
[1:06:26] he was wounded for a transgression
[1:06:34] of our peace was upon Him
[1:06:38] of our peace
[1:06:56] [Applause]
[1:06:59] um
[1:07:04] it's a matter of accepting
[1:07:07] to accept what Christ did for you and I
[1:07:10] accepted
[1:07:12] except the price he paid
[1:07:15] to accept our healing
[1:07:19] to accept Christ in our hearts
[1:07:23] accept him as our savior
[1:07:26] Salvador and it's at that very moment
[1:07:28] yes
[1:07:32] that all sickness and sin is gone
[1:07:37] from and it's from that day yes
[1:07:40] forward
[1:07:42] that we are free
[1:07:45] thank the Lord uh
[1:07:51] the price was paid
[1:08:09] I do want to mention that uh
