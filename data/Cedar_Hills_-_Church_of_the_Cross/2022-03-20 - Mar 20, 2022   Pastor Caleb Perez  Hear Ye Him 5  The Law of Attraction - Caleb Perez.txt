camera amen we are grateful that he is here with us and uh god bless you pops to see you amen we had uh we had not mentioned it but but we did want to um give our condolences to sister debbie uh and and the rango family of the passing of her grandma ended up burying her thursday i believe and so lord bless you bless the family and during this time amen we want to get right into the word each and every one of you in the precious name of our lord and savior jesus christ i greet you neighbor good amen neighbor amen and this would be subtitled the law of attraction now it seems kind of uh with all that's going on in the world and the greatest thing that could happen is that we would be prepared for the coming of the lord let's get into the word matthew the 17th chapter verse five and it reads like this while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and you hold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hear ye is you must be in the same frequency must be in the same vibration you'll understand that in a moment one more scripture first corinthians 14. what is in verse 10. you can say man and it reads there are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them is without signification once again so many kinds of voices amen may god add his blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated no truer words were ever spoken that is what our founding pastor would always say all truer words were ever spoken there are so many kinds of voices in the world and there's more today than there ever has been in the history of the world we talk about knowledge increasing then there's the ugly there's lots of things going on and as the scripture says every voice has some kind of significance a man by the name of dr peterson peterson who was once an atheist now turned christian he made this statement uh when discussing the topic of the bible being true which he says which makes it i want to repeat that because i want you to get this it isn't that the bible is true no is the bible true it's not that it say oh this book is is a true book what he's saying is that the bible is the precondition for the it's something more than just oh that's true somebody takes the statement oh that's true more than just true it is the very basis for every where everything else is jesus but that is the very embodiment of truth amen or amen i'm going to say it again jesus christ it's not just all what he said was true that's the very embodiment [Music] embodiment of christ the word so many as i said so many kinds of voices in the world and that's why everything that we hear must be passed through a filter the filter is god's word we must be very careful what we open our hearts too while has a specific language right speaks different than any other preacher out there because he is tuned in perfectly the same frequency comes forth from the throne the problem isn't that that people hear the message it's that they try to hybrid it with something else you go to school that you learn different things and and it's good that somebody has wisdom in certain subjects but our soul is not hanging on their words i can learn a lot of things from a lot of people and i give sometimes you hear somebody express things that maybe you were thinking but you didn't know how to express it yourself really i mean when he when he gets into into his teachings motivational try to change your way of living and so forth very interesting very very very smart man and i was given a video or showing a video he was uh explaining the law of attraction i i i heard him for a little bit and i and and i heard what he had to say and in certain parts i said this man listens to brother branham but you also see that he's after a certain thing to help people in certain ways and i want to go over some of these comments that he made i'm not promoting bob proctor this morning i still understand that but not promoting him but there are things that really activate or get you to think about certain things there are people here that are very wise and and smart in these things but i think we all know right we're all we're all we are all a molecular structure and it vibrates at a very high speed so even the person that's sluggish or slow you are he said if you could look at your body under a microscope your cells they're they're vibrating they're moving all the time he said that how you use your mind dictates the vibration that you're in dictates the vibrations that's going on inside of you he said our mind is made up of uh of two parts it is made up of the conscience and the subconscious and when we see this and all that that he sees and he starts to learn everything sticks to him we all notice that as we get older we don't we have to we just nothing seems to stick to the person here i heard people say soy como teflon teflon nothing sticks to it is true i'm getting a little older i'm like telling the truth the whole time we see this it it it shows that as children we are constantly being bombarded and there's a saying that says that we and whatever environment is around that's how you learn your habits you learn how to do deal things and how you handle things and on and on we can go it says but but then you stop for a moment because we are not just the product of our environment we are also the product of a dna strand from our we are not just the products of the environment but what we are when we come to this world we were born the wrong way and when we see that we realize so many characteristics that we have characteristics would be from our parents or grandparents or great-grandparents and even if we didn't even know them yeah all of a sudden you say that's the way my grandmother used to act we are the product of the dna but we are also the product of the environment shaped in iniquities and when we when we realize that we realize we don't have much hope do we say that the human being doesn't have much hope look at the way that that i am and when you when you look back and see what brother branham has to say he begins to tell us he says he says and the people today are teenagers out in high school little girls living in adultery boys little boys and wow the what kind of generation is coming up after if that's what makes the little girls act like they do that their mommy their mammy was a flapper your grandmother was a chorus girl that's the reason she's a striptease today because he said that he would visit the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and the children's children to the third and the fourth generation already encoded in your dna and when the whole things began to leak out the righteous seed begins setting on the side that seed gets thinner and thinner and thinner and the wicked just keep on getting very religious he loves malik don't last but they keep getting wickeder and wickeder there's nothing to do he says but destroy the whole thing like he did in the antediluvian district every that's the reason we're in the condition we're in today [Music] to i want to stop and make emphasis on this you've got to be careful how you pray today we spoke on last sunday jurisdiction these demons are also given jurisdiction but when prophecy comes from for judgment they'll come after you and then because you're praying the wrong prayers to remove something that is part of the prophecy yes yeah everybody understand me in that sentence now we do pray that god that there is a protection upon god's people but as we see this unfold i i want to get this get something across so so good this morning he says that when we look at our minds he says it's it's we have to understand the law of attraction and and in understanding this we we we see that that he says what is uh it comes to the word paradigm is the word he was using paradigm you've heard the word paradigm right a paradigm is is a multitude of habits it is not in your mind he says it's in your subconscious mind not in your conscience in your subconscious mind he defines it as a multitude of habits it's a collection of all your beliefs they're held closely by a group of people and it's not now when we when we see this and he's what he's saying is is that in the subconscious that paradigm is what's controlling you whatever the habits and the beliefs and all that you have that you hold dear that in our subconscious all your thoughts that come forth so far it depends on the nature of the soul depending on whatever the nature is soul controls your spirit that spirit controls your body control abc's yes like they said brother caleb you can't drink because you're a pastor i would say i can do just as easy as you well and then is that on the inside there is nothing that is asking for this that's why many times when we struggle with things in our lives he says if the paradigm isn't shifted or changed the moment that's why the change doesn't start from the outside that begins to change jesus never said well so what i did peter i asked him to leave you alone there's no growth in that recipient no overcoming in that by not giving you sometimes we want to do that all the time whether it's with our children or whoever else i pray that your faith wouldn't fail you yeah that's what we're praying today no matter what each one of you is going through we pray that your faith will not fail your children will be judged for what you do haven't you no respect or decency he says girls wearing your little shorts and things around and you know that's reflected that will [Music] he said that your paradigm is where is where your energy flows you get different religions and they go into all the energies and they want to and that's that's their thing i'm not just talking about blowing energy i'm talking about life those cannot produce life they can produce church members they can produce followers but they cannot produce life there are no points that's what we're after here this man says this energy then flows who is now watch this now think it so now as he explains it the type of thoughts you get depends on the energy that's coming forth from you depend depending on your question you are living in a certain state of vibration oh my goodness now if you have a certain type of energy flowing through you see this is because you're trying to get a different vibration or frequency start to do something different than what you've done for years your paradigm kicks it out and says that makes me uncomfortable but watch this now the paradigm kicks it out it's the same thing then when we look at it attracts other frequencies of light manner this morning come on now we we want to this this is all just a a a foundation for where we're going fundamentally whatever vibration we're in will only attract the same vibration still do but but when we were young i thought we had to have no tv all we had was a radio radio and the cowboys were playing it so here we go trying to find the right frequency right right and then sometimes we pick up those cowboys then we turn it a little bit more then then you hear okay we have a fourth quarter and you're like next thing you know your anybody ever get foil and put stuff it's the way we are many times today is it almost sometimes we just can't get the right i mean we hear the message but there's so much static around i don't know we're not in church and our mind is going somewhere else our vibration is right we're in the right channel comes forward and what is it doing there's a connection there you're not going to expect it becomes the law of attraction shift away from each other we are not in the same in the same channel anymore we're not in the same vibration you don't like what's going on [Music] are you with me come on now i want to know you know that brother sit there and listen to garbage why my paradigm or my nature oh i don't want that i don't need that you attract people that are in harmony with you yeah and he gives an example which i i i i looked at then i said wow that's that's the way another way to look at it they lack or they they attract attract lack and limitations and limitations oh i can't do that talk the [Music] something's not right when i see this oh i see that that as a christian cristiano there is something in me that controls me then i always control it is what we what we look at and we say we all need a new birth you ain't going to get away from it shift away from your vibration unless you're born again want i want you to follow me in here okay now now notice this now think you say the law of vibration and the law of attraction he says are intimately connected the law of vibration is the primary law and the law of attraction is the secondary law because vibration is what causes the attraction we see this and we say my goodness we don't have to think about a lot of things if you feel grateful you raise your vibration more things to be grateful if you feel and once watch what he says here and this is where we began to differ from this smart man this wise man i want you to get this because this is our because we're getting into our message now now you have a man that lives in this other world and no better person to tell you what it is one that has been there mascara and i love this and then he goes on to say he says the subconscious in the subconscious is a soul watch here it's not the mind that controls your nerves controls oh think different and then you won't be as nervous it's not your mind that controls your nerves the soul that's controlling your nerves and if there's doubt it's sending a vibration and that vibration is a vibration of unbelief and it's telling you no no no it's not possible there's no no no no no that's not for me no experience what's because that is the frequency you're living under but i said it's your soul that controls the nerves and then he says put on a lie detector and it doesn't matter how much you get your mind thinking come on and i'm going to think it this way and i'm going to i'm going to try to be deceptive and then you have this eye detector on you and it is how upset you get or whatever your soul will not lie it'll tell you exactly what's going on you see there is a vibration that unbelief sends through look to what leaving it why you change the the state at which you're living right change the vibration how many want to leave this building happy and free and it's telling now my question is can you believe your own words anybody ready for that this morning such a vibration would go to the podium already it was all done at calvary but let's take it and bring it to our day and say it's for me now it my wife was telling me that the other day she was she was uh at a store with with i forget who who [Music] how did you know that is sent forth by faith watch this he says you're a christian it's the vibration of your spirit is [Music] what would happen que pasawa and we know that because he would say it over and over again one of the times that he's praying for somebody with your hand and he says oh brother i know you've been wanting to see if this really works you know and then brother what was the name of that watch brother brother henry that you're dead long that's right and so he would say you know these longini watches when that when that vibration comes through my hand that was the vibration man you with me this morning i feel you pulling good so keep on pulling watch what he says here now goes on and he says you see the swelling and so forth [Music] and there was a vibration pouring from that ruptured appendix all right he says now if there's a germ problem there so then he would he would say okay this is what's going on inside your body and he would pray for them so many times it would stop instantly that vibration [Music] begins to pick up different things when the life of christ began to move in our bodies things began to happen how you say brother that's the spiritual realm in the physical realm in their own physical now notice this because this is so important to get is with eternal life why do you do people like to hear certain kinds of music is [Music] oh what kind of music is out there today from the old time heavy metal there's the heavy metal other antis rap christian look wrapped in i'm sorry rock and roll at the rock and roll what is that show it's okay [Music] you're happy because your little baby's dancing to that is that content was born that's the vibration and we're happy about that vibration it doesn't matter how much you say you're a christian vibration is what is calling or attracting it but watch as we get into that right vibration the right frequency and that's not for the question oh great holy spirit of god oh god as life begins this mortal life began to gray the hairs within our mortal beings mortality [Music] most [Music] i'm going to say it again we're always looking for the answers that we can be happy and have a wonderful life and then we're always looking outside oh my goodness what can i where can i find an answer to this you find that most people don't like to be by themselves no babe come on come with me oh stay with me baby no okay maybe even even adults sometimes they don't want they're afraid of the dark that will help you get rich and help you do a lot of things they have keystone instead one of these days [Music] but unless we start studying ourselves but because we lack understanding of who we are we are locked into a physical world that's why everything outside of us controls the unseen or the spiritual 95 of the people never learn how to live their life they are not living at all they react to everything around them come on [Music] well i was baptized with the holy ghost years ago baptized put faith from california baptism of faith baptism of virtue of knowledge of patience it only quickens the eternal seed gene holy hacker you know mackerel never mind i was going to tell you about the macro that's not even important first corinthians 14 10. one more time there are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them without significance everyone has a meaning and when you enter into this place the message hear his voice when you enter into the place where the doubts have passed away then you're free and you can hear the voice of god speaking a child of mine i am your savior the mind i am your healer you don't have to do these things that you might be free but as long as you're down here in this vibration you're down here in this vibration mixed up with all kinds of voices is when we see this when we we see this though we hear voices singing we hear voices everywhere we go all kinds of vibrations each voice is a vibration every sound is a vibration and in order for a sound to be heard listen closely number three you have to have a medium something for the sound to travel through i don't know liquids gasses did you know that sound cannot travel through a vacuum [Music] no wonder the soul where is it at in the heart and in that compartment i understand there's nothing right there's nothing to vibrate oh it says and you need a receiver it is we're sitting there at the table and subject if a tree falls in the forest there's nobody there to hear it has it's something you right away you're going to get on one side or the other hand no it doesn't make a sound no no doesn't matter if somebody's there not of course it makes noise it makes a sound no yes no something to think about this is important for the message because we have our ideas of turn things i gave we resumed it later especially i ain't about to let it go you know cinemas i said now i'm not taking this i'm just i want you to see something else after her that it doesn't make a sound [Music] to understand that that watch you're looking at it from here but look at it from this point after you break it down okay there has to be a source a medium and a receiver now watch it it goes down kind of three and it hits there has to be an apparatus there's a nerve that's dead are you nervous and i said now watch the lord jesus hear the lord that will pick up the literal body of the lord or the literal voice of the lord jesus christ there's an apparatus picking up those waves that continue to go around the same thing with us when we speak a word or a good word sound waves go around against now now notice this now it's what i wanted her to understand it's five ten minutes max and then i'll let you go i promise yes see majority majority rule so i gotta stop here [Music] they're he says now here's on the baptismal the prophet the prophecy or the prophet the prophet the attraction goes from the prophet to the prophecy what is the prophecy now it's going to be fulfilled because the voice was spoken now watch their vibration changes now they begin to recognize who they are there's a lot of prophecies that were spoken about the bride of christ how many is he talking about that vibration has to change your vibration the real law of attraction where the prophet speaks it's the voice of god the vibrations that go forth around the world but it will not rain come on now a man can't speak that just to speak it uh of [Music] here we are but let me explain this for a moment i hear the sound of the abundance of rain by hearing by the word of god and when that state drops to the heart now when it did you know our frequencies are created in us at that this very moment using here on earth we love you pastor pastor believe you watch it we just say your thoughts are louder than it is god bless you brother it's all about the vibrations the mind of the and both of those could be imitated but for the bride because it dealt with our soul notice this now it is now changing the whole atmosphere the vibration pull that you've and i'm going to say this as the as the musicians come hello everybody i want to say it again we've come to a place oh you can have a lot of discussions about the third pool something but it's time to stop waiting for things here it's time to stop looking at prophecy it's time to stop looking at prophecy and start looking at the fulfillment that's where we are at church start looking at it not for it anymore i'm gonna ask you i'm gonna challenge you this morning but the message came for them produced the bride however much they want to fight against it we are looking at it already well they're arguing about looking for something we are looking at something we have come into a frequency frequency and as we are getting ourselves in that frequency it i just want to let that one sink in for a moment those that have gone on pasado what are they waiting for questions when the seven still was open can you imagine this morning brother abraham can you imagine this morning yes she is waiting oh yes why is she waiting for a voice just say what you got to say it's time to go back home come on it's time to go see our loved ones imagine at that moment the voice vibrates and all the elements made that will bring on the resurrection play something brother wheel i'm going to ask each one now now i'm going to challenge your face as you close your eyes you know we've often said of a gentile the perfect faith perfect is to speak the word and then we say yes we'll still lay hands on people but everybody's waiting for somebody to say something when that great faith of that centurion [Music] jesus said i have not seen so great of faith so i'm gonna ask if there's somebody here and you're able to believe your own word the vibration is here if you can connect to that right channel i don't care what you're struggling with but if you want in this moment total liberation i'm going to ask for right now just three people you'll ask for more later but right now it's three people i don't care what you're struggling with habits they [Music] i'm not looking for it i'm looking at it now you be in prayer and you believe your own word i want you to say speak it out and say this is my problem but from this day forward i am what your problem is and now speak to it can you do that [Music] you [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] um [Music] oh [Music] that's not the correct vibration he's here right now [Music] oh yes [Music] all in you now you gotta believe it with your own heart now and you gotta speak [Music] family [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] get serious with it we've relied on everybody else we've relied on somebody to put hands that's okay there's no time for that now it's come to this place [Music] oh there's more people i could blow i can feel the holy spirit pulling you but i don't know if i can believe i can [Music] that's the wrong vibration [Music] come and see her later he's been all over you from the moment you were sitting there whatever it is you speak it right now and you believe your words oh yes come on now church we're breaking through this morning we've played church long enough he has given us jurisdiction [Music] [Music]

confession [Music] oh we are we are free believe it is [Music] christ understands it oh yes [Music] who else [Music] come on [Music] you don't have to come up here but i challenge you in the name of

of rain but today now we feel the sound of the abundance of rain [Music] i'm going to say it again today we feel oh that's the sound the abundance of rain prophet already spoken [Music] don't let the vibration of unbelief ever come again [Music] where it's at i don't know jesus power in that name [Music] i feel [Music] i hear the call me he speaks to me that's the vibration of his voice and i i
