oh believe oh only believe all things are posible only believe oh believe oh believe all things things are possible ho [Music] believe and we read Luke 1 verse 37 and 38 for with God nothing shall be in impossible and Mary said behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her God bless you you may Maria incred mecia Maria and she made her way down along the path I believe or I might say this as a little drama that she was thinking about what happened the day before and after they had come from church while it was customary that her engaged husband Joseph was to uh uh come home with her that day for dinner and as the dinner was made ready while they had had their dinner as usual they set out on the porch looking across the Little Valley over on the other side of the Hill Joseph was a cartender and knowing that he was fixing to Mary this beautiful young Jewish Maiden uh being a carpenter he was building their future home over on the other Hill so it you know I'd imagine it had to have that little Special Touch to it because is go to bring his Pretty Young Bride into this home it the doors had to fit just right and he was taking his time about doing it because he didn't want to hurry up job on this one he must be the windows must fit just right and the doors just right I'd imagine when he went in the gate might have been a big heart shape so that when he went in make the gate in the shape of a heart roses all around the house and they'd plan this for some time since their engagement they would go out there on say a Sunday afternoon and sat down on the porch and look just across where their future home would be and as a custom they'd speak about the Lord because they were both great Believers in God and this Sunday was a special one as they hurried dinner and got the dishes washed and Joseph was already sitting on the porch when Mary arrived and and it must have been a conversation something like this as they usually talked about the way the house was shaped and his how it would look and the rabbis would come home with them for dinner but instead they fell on the subject of the morning's message that he had heard from the rabbi the notable honorable one and uh perhaps it was Mary that said Joseph wasn't that a striking message this morning that the rabbi preached our beloved Pastor oh Joseph must have said that was an outstanding message I loved it so much when he spoke of that great Jehovah God who led our people out of Egypt did it not thrill you when he read the Scrolls of Exodus when they were brought out how that Jehovah LED them by a pillar of fire and they just had no Compass to go but they went by the leading of the spirit oh Mary wouldn't it be wonderful that if we could live all our lives watching that Pillar of Fire and be led like they were and how that when they needed food he reigned the Mana Out of Heaven they had bread and then when they needed flesh he blowed in quailes from the coast fill the ground and when they needed water he had a smitten Rock when they were sick he had a brass serpent for an atonement for their sickness and oh how great it was but he said sweetheart I believe he spared the whole thing when he said but alas Jehovah doesn't do that anymore somehow or another I've always believed that that Jehovah always Remains the Same Hallelujah he he just can't fail and I believe that the reason that we have uh living in the days that we are is because that our people has lost faith in Jehovah I believe that he is Immortal and he doesn't get old and fade away he just simply is the same Jehovah and he expects us I don't think that I would disregard or disrespect The Honorable Rabbi but when he said this morning in his message that Jehovah performed no more miracles that the only thing that he wanted us to do was to come to church and pay our TI live a good life as we could and he'd take us up home in glory I I can't hardly believe that Mary uh I believe that Jehovah wants us to walk with him like they did in that dayen and then it must have been that Mary said oh uh dear do you know we should read the scriptures first well if you've ever been in a Palestinian home and see some of the old ancient landmarks the books of the Bible was kept in a like a it's called a scroll rolled up on like a stick and they kept them in a container like a waste basket just stick them down in this container and like the scroll of Isaiah The Scroll of Jeremiah and all those prophets were in there and so it didn't make any difference which one they read because they know it was all ordained of God because it was their Prophet so Joseph said well I dear would would you go in and get one of the Scrolls she just a chance reached in to get the scroll and brought it out she said well dear today it seems like we read from the book of Isaiah so he pulled open the scroll and Joseph began to read and his m his eyes fell up on this potion a virgin shall conceive and shall bring forth a son they shall call his name counselor Mighty God Prince of Peace Everlasting father and when he got down to the end the little virgin lady sitting to the side said just a moment Joseph dear what does a prophet mean by a Virg conceiving well Joseph might have said this dear that's just a little too deep for me I do not understand it but I believe it it's just what the Bible said I don't know how it will ever happen but we know this dear if we know that Isaiah was Jehovah's Prophet therefore being Anointed with the holy spirit of God upon him he could not prophesy wrong because he was born to prophet and we know that his words are true and when he said a virgin shall conceive that was not Isaiah that was our Jehovah and Jehovah is able to do anything that he says that he'll do and as they spoke about it on down how his name would be called counselor Prince of Peace Mighty God Everlasting father and the government shall be up on his shoulders and there' be no end to his kingdom and so forth she said it must be the same one that the prophet Moses promised to us the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like unto me therefore it must be the Messiah Joseph said I believe the scribes interpreted that way that this would be the Messiah that was to come and um as the evening passed on the night service Drew near while they went on back to church again and it was the next morning that she was going along for the water and she could hear the hammer across the way where the saw where Joseph was building on their house and as she got up and had her breakfast and stuck the little picture under her arm and started down to the city public well now if we had time I'd like to dwell on that well for a while but we don't have the time so as she was going along with her head down thinking she couldn't get it off her mind and she said that remark that Joseph made to me when I stopped him on that scripture of Isaiah 9:6 and how that he he said to me dear you know I think you always thought you was the most beautiful woman I ever seen but somehow in the last few minutes you've been more beautiful than ever you're big brown eyes sparkle and just when we mention this scripture did it thrill you or what's taking place well she wondered what was that when he said a child is born a son is given wonder what made me feel the way I did and just then as the little Maiden was walking she noticed something Flicker and she looked around and it must have been the sun she said that shined against a rock up on the desert Hill there somewhere and as she went on about her way thinking about what was taking place and what they'd been talking about she turned a corner that goes up to the city well where the ladies meet out there early the morning and let their uh buckets down they they Crocs more like a croc or a jug they got a long neck two handles they had a hook they hooked under in a Windle they let the jug down it being made out of clay while it sank they'd Windle the water back up and then set it up on top their heads and walked right on back home with maybe holding five or six gallons of water enough for the day unless they were washing and then usually they went to the places to wash now as she turned the corner she seen that light flicker again and as she looked when she had to pass to a little narrow place where just one person could pass down stood Gabriel the archangel Hallelujah it wasn't the son the s n she seen reflecting he was following her and he met her to where he got in a place where she'd have to look to him and she looked and he was all of a glow of light around him frightened the little virgin I had no doubt she grabbed her water pop and those big eyes stared out and looked at the Archangel he said Hail Mary or stop you're highly favored before God oh I like that Hallelujah that little woman in the meanest City there was in the world at that time no one meest city anyhow in Palestine and in there she had lived such a life until God chose her for a certain work that he was going to do there she looked into his face and it startled her you know it's usually as we are thinking on those things the Bible said if there be any praise if there be any virtue think on these things I think the reason we don't see no more of it and we do we got our minds on too many other things I think the Angels would still appear to us if we only kept our minds up on them yes amen but we're thinking about something else that where we're going a certain program we got to look at or or a certain shopping we got to do but our scripture tells us seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things will be added unto you and there then when we see that that he said th highly favored before God and we notice again I want don't want to leave this scripture but it was theopus and his friend on the road to emus as they were going along there brokenhearted speaking about Jesus being crucified and dead and the stories that they had heard about him being raised from the dead and they didn't believe it on the road going over going back to maybe go to work on Monday morning on the road back it was while they were thinking of him that he appeared to them stepped out of the bushes and begin to talk to him just like an ordinary man he said oh why are you so weary what's wrong with you they said are you just a stranger here do you believe now this this is kind of sticky but people who had walked with him and talked with him and walked all day with him after his resurrection the same Jesus and didn't know him he he will reveal himself to whosoever he will reveal oh I pray tonight that he'll take the shades from every one of our eyes and will come into this building and reveal himself in the power power of his resurrection that every person might see him the sinner as her savior the sick as her healer and we notice that he walked with them all day and then he made out like he was going somewhere else or going all by and they constrained him to come in Oh I like that constraining him to come in oh Jesus you you you're here in the church tonight you must go home with me Hallelujah I want to take you to my home I never want to lose this stealing of your presence let me take you home come in and abide with me never want to lose that feeling wouldn't that be wonderful Hallelujah you know I want to stop here in my message just a moment and say the most glorious things that I have ever seen happen is when something anointed me I wish I could stay in that place all the time you reading the book that night when the maniac ran out on the platform up there to kill me at at um where Portland you was there brother Jack or was brother Brown was there when that Maniac Run out to kill me and threatened to do it great big huge fellow and instead of hating the man I loved him he wouldn't have done that he was probably a man with a family same as I had and he wouldn't have done that it was the devil on him that was doing that and when I loved him I wasn't afraid of him then love castes out fear it's when you can love you heard the story about the old mother possum coming up to the house love it takes love to conquer the time that bull was going to kill me out there in the field run right up on and it wasn't that I hated him uh was a game warden I reached to get a gun I left it in my car and I was glad I did afterwards he run up and I thought well if I have to die I might as well die facing him I can't run from him there's nothing to get out of the way and just then I thought well if I have to go I want to go looking at him and when it did he ran right to me because he catched me anyhow and he had a chain hanging from his nose just killed a colored man few weeks before that I forgot about him being in that field I was going to pray for a sick man and he threw his knee down like this and hit the dirt and roared and here he comes and I don't know why but something happened always when a healing takes place or anything there's something happen a love comes in that it just takes everything else out of the way oh I tell you brother you can have all the theology you want you but give me love every time ever since by faith I saw that stream thy flowing wounds applied redeeming love has been my theme and shall be till I die love oh if I could only live in that atmosphere all the time and as that struck me I said creature of God I am the servant of God I'm on my way over to pray for one of his sick children now I'm in your territory I'm in your field here I didn't mean to disturb you but in the name of Jesus Christ go back and lay down I'll not bother you and he looked like he was coming on here he come just as hard as he could I just stood still no more afraid than I am right now and when he got about three foot from me he stopped you looked at me he looked so depleted one way and then the other turned around walked over and laid down I passed by with the two feet walk out on by love conquers something [Music] happens something takes place the other I I was telling you about down in Mexico when brother Jack was there there's an old uh Mexican man come up on the platform he was total blind and a poor old fell is their economics are so poorly balanced and they don't have nothing to eat this old fell didn't have on any shoes and an old hat in his hands sewed up with cards and an old ragged looking coat on and trousers almost to his knees and dust all over him he come walking across the platform with a little Rosary in his hand little bunch of beads and he got up to me saying something somebody was leading him I stood looked at him I tell you brother until you can feel another man's condition you can never help him that's right that's that's the reason God so loved the world hallelujah hallelujah you had a feeling for it and I looked at him I thought there he is probably a bunch of little children somewhere working for a few peses a day and now after all this maybe another never had a good meal in his life and you're in that condition now Nature has been so bad to him or his Fate has blinded him and he was I C my foot upside him I thought here I stand with a good suit on and a pair of shoes a good pair of shoes I don't know whether he ever had a pair of shoes on his life I hope that's not right I've got a pair at home I got another suit at home that man's got just as much right to him as I have I put my foot up the side of his S I give him my shoes before he said anything why his foot was much bigger and his his shoulders much wider couldn't give him a coat oh God what can I do for him and my old dad would have lived he'd had been about his age what was it entering in all at once something happened I begin to feel that presence of Love Sympathy for the old man he jerked out little beads and getting all her Hail Mary Mother of God bless I said that's not necessary just put it away and he said to brother espinos where is the Healer I want to get a hold of him and I said just tell him to Bow his head I put my arms around the old fell I start I said Lord Jesus this poor old man I can't get him a shoes he can't wear them I can't give him a coat but Lord God you're the only one can help him now you can give him something that'll fit him that's eyesight that's what he's craving for no more than I said that I heard some glor adios and there he was she as good as I could running across the platform just as hard as he could go and the next night there was a rick of clothes old scares and aprons and old coats and rags and hats piled up on there two or three times as long as this year and about that how how I ever how they ever got the right one I don't know but what they seen something oh when something happens something takes place that's the way it was with Mary that morning something must have took place when she was thinking about him and there he appeared into her presence it was the same thing with Moses like it was with Mary he said you're going to conceive in your womb and bear a child now she know the Angel's message was scriptural yes I don't care what kind of an Angel it was that appeared if that Angel's message is not scriptural and a promise of God let it alone there's been all kinds of angels appearing everything things and they bring all kinds of messages if the angel of the Lord whose servant I am would come if that angel would come don't matter how much it looked like to pillar ify how much it looked like to like if his message didn't bear record with this word I'd let him alone and let him be a curse it has to be in this Joseph Smith you know saw an angel he said but it didn't bear a record with the word and Mary knew that she just read the day before Isaiah 9:6 that something was about to happen GL to Jesus amen and she know it was on its way then Moses likewise when he'd give up all of the hopes with this Theology and was on the backside of the desert herden Jethro sheep and one day he saw a a ball of fire sitting in a bush back there and he come up and Tuck off his shoes as he was bid and he listened to see what it was but when he saw that angel was scriptural said I've heard the cry of my people and I remembered my Covenant he know that God made the promise and it was that was the angel that would go with him I remember my promise and my Covenant I've seen the sufferings of my people and I've come down to deliver him Moses know it wasn't his anymore because of that I have come down to deliver him oh that's a good part I come down you just be a mouthpiece barming so he seen it was absolutely scriptural and Mary saw it was absolutely scriptural for the day before she'd been reading it perhaps in the scroll as our little drama goes I tell you it pays to read God's word Daily Now Jesus said search ye the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify me otherwise he said if I do not the works of my father that was supposed to be done when he come then believe me not but if I do the works though you don't believe me believe the works because they're the ones that sent of God we are looking for a Heavenly visitor in this day it's a promise of God put on your deep spiritual thinking quick church and remember we are now looking for a visitor and there's many claiming it but the only way that we'll know this heavenly visitor because he'll bear record of the work she knew that that angel was from God when she seen his action looked at him it must be an angel he said I'm Gabriel standing at the right hand of God now when God gets ready to do something he sends a messenger always always has he always will Gabriel announc the first coming of Christ Gabriel will announce the second coming of Christ that's right something major sixing to happen and we notice this Angel when he said Hail Mary and told her what was going to take place she didn't doubt him because she know he was perfectly scriptural that it was supposed to be that way now we're looking for a messenger in this last days because Jesus said it would be because all the prophets said it would be Malachi said it would be all the prophets has testified Jesus in the very shadow of the Cross spoke more of his second coming than he did of his going away and when we see these things begin to come to pass we better go to search in the scripture because he said there' be false Christ arise and false prophets and would show signs and wonders in so much that it would deceive the very elected if it was possible Billy Grim said in a message here a few weeks ago it's already deceived the very elected I differ with the Evangelist it cannot deceive the very elected because they are elected of God Jesus spoke that in the days just before the coming of the son of man it would be as it was in Sodom and if we Tu it before last this in this week that there was an angel came to Sodom three of them for three classes of people one of them was the sodomites the other was the lukewarm Church the other was the elected and called out Church Abraham and his group in his group and Sodom in their group all two of them went out the evangelists went down to preach to Sodom and to bring out that group of people of Believers down there you just got a few of them out but we notice that the one that stayed behind to the elected church he showed a sign and it was God yeah doing that it was not a myth it was not a theophany a theophany don't eat he eat the Flesh of a calf and eat some whole cake corn bread and some butter on it and drink the milk from the cow a theophany doesn't eat and drink it was God that's right made manifest in flesh it sure was and what was he speaking Jesus said as in that day so will it be God will come again come into the Flesh of his people that he has bought and Sanctified and will show to his elected Church the same sign that he showed to his elected church back there there was no come out of it there was no this that he was already out of it Abraham was but the other Angels was calling out calling out down there but Abraham was already out and the church the very Word Church means called out God's church is already called out it's called out and he gave him a sign that he was the one and when he did with his back turned he told Sarah was in the tent behind him laughing by power the same thing that Jesus manifested in his coming manifested to both Samaritan and to the Jew and it's predicted that in this last days that he would send his messenger again and that messenger tonight is that a man no sir it's the Holy Ghost that's his messenger god in his church moving showing the signs and wonders just before his appearing now remember this Angel has to be a scriptural Angel yes besides that we are warned of God about false prophets the Bible said if there be a man among you who thinks himself to be a prophet or so forth and what he says doesn't come to pass then don't fear him I'm not with him but what he says comes to pass then I'm with that Prophet hearing that's true so we find out today that that message is a true bible message it's back to the baptism of the Holy Ghost back to the power of God back to Pentecost again restoring the hearts of the fathers back to the children or the children back to the father's rather in this last days we're looking for a Heavenly messenger and I believe he's here tonight yes amen I believe that he's here what does he do he Bears record now listen friends don't take a substitute don't just shake a man's hand and put your name on the book that that's that that's as far as it goes that's all right I may might help you uh get out of the saloon and get in a a decent place and try to live right that won't do it all except the man be born again he cannot even see the kingdom of God am now C needs to understand there's a lot of people that say they're born again and can't understand the message of God can't see the angel of the Lord their eyes are blinded brother except the man be born of the Holy Ghost the same holy ghost that wrote the word will confirm the word and the same confirmation of the Holy Ghost in [Applause] you you see what I mean it will bear record of itself and our Spirit Bears record with his spirit because his Spirit Bears record of his word the word of God is sharper more powerful Hebrews 4 than any two- a sword even piercon to the thunder in the M of the bone and a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart that's thus sayith the Lord the Lord's word just exactly Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever appearing in his elected Church oh we got great Revival sweeping the lands everywhere calling out of Sodom and so forth but in the elected church we have that person God the same God that was back on her there's only one of them and that one was in his church manifesting himself to be the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever scriptural if he wasn't with the scripture didn't bear record of the scripture didn't confirm his word then I would not believe him but being that he does that I know he's from God just like Mary did hallelujah amen oh like Moses did or any the rest of them if it wasn't scriptural now back in the Old Testament they had more than one way to find out if a man dreamed a dream or a prophet prophesied you know what they did with that they took him down before the Yum Thunder that hung on the PO H the UR Thunder is believed to have been those 12 burst stones and Aaron's birth uh his breastplate carrying the birthstone of each one then he hung it on the post if the prophet stood up and prophesied and no matter how really it sound if the supernatural didn't answer back a conglomeration of rainbow lights around in these glittering like that no matter what the prophet said he was wrong no matter what the dreamer dreamed it was wrong but God always answers back in a supernatural way now and that priesthood ended and the yundum was taken down but God's got another yundum this is it God's word is a urath thund that's God's word let every man's word be a lie and mine be true said God heavens and earth will pass away said Jesus but my word shall never pass away now then if one speaks and it's not scriptural don't believe it if he speaks and it is scriptural wait a minute try it with the UR mundam then if the supernatural answers back that it is the truth then believe it that's the way to believe a true message if the bible promises anything and the Bible says it's so that's God's year with thund if the preacher preach is preaching like the Bible said that's God's messenger God's witness that if it is the then the supernatural of that word will be made manifest and prove itself to be God God keeps his promise we're looking for a messenger that messenger is the Holy Spirit the Bible said a little while the world won't see me no more Jesus did yet ye shall see me for I'll be with you to the end of the world the works that I do shall you do also More Than This shall you do for I go unto my father now the word there more in the right translation I've used it there and more because it said the King James greater who could do any greater he raised the dead stopped nature done everything but then he was in one person all of God was bottled up into one man Jesus Christ but in this time he's Across the Universe in his church more of it the same work same works that I do shall they do also More Than This shall I do because I returned back to the pillar of fire that I was before I Was Made question the Myself by the same work and the same manifestations I did that is exactly right Jesus said when he was here on Earth I come from God and I return to God is that right that's right all right if he was God he would would spoke to there one day and they talked him about about being 50 years old yet and saw Abraham he said before Abraham was I am I am was that Pillar of Fire that was in the bush with Moses that was a scriptural Pillar of Fire that same is the I am not I was or will be I am always just [Music] forever we see when I am was made presence Among Us in a body of his own son that he created own body cross his cast from God to become a human in order to bring us back to Salvation and back to the Garden of Eden again crossed itself spread his tents Among Us and eat like us and slept like us and walk like us and look like us he become us that we through him might become him going into the kingdom then when we find that Pillar of Fire when it was with him it performs signs and wonders and he confessed it's not me that doeth the works it's my father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works for barely verely I say unto you the son can do nothing in himself until he sees the father do it also and the son does what the father shows and he worketh and I worketh hether to amen rightall he died rose again on the third day and a few days after that there was a little critical hook noosed Jew with a bunch of stuff in his pocket going down to persecute the church all them that was in this way yeah went out to on his road to Damascus and he was stricken down and when he looked up he saw a great Pillar of Fire hanging there saying Saul Saul why persecutest thou me he said who are you Lord who is this Pillar of Fire I come from God I go to God he said I'm Jesus that's hard [Music] you the prophet said there' be a for Marine in a lattering then the lattering would be both former and lattering together a great church Universal have sweep from one side of the world to the other side of the world a great message great signs and wonders would have be accomplished by this church Daniel said the people that know their God in that day shall do exploits exactly where we're living at in this day now the mechanical eye of the camera shows over us that that Pillar of Fire is the same Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel now it's got to do the same things that did when it was in him art is not the same Pillar of Fire amen but if it does the same thing how can you doubt it in scripture Hail Mary blessed art thou amongst women thou found favor with god oh Church hail blessed art you among the people because you found favor with God you believe for eternal life and God's give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost right this Messenger will be true Messenger of God the Holy Spirit which is God's message notice Mary as soon as she seen it was scriptural she didn't say I'll go over and see whether Dr Jones says it's right or not she didn't go by to see if Rabbi kabiny thought it was right or not she never had nothing to do with it you know what she said she said behold the hands made of the Lord be unto me according to your word or she know that word was God's word that messenger was God's messenger was God's angel because he stayed with God's word behold the hands made of the Lord hallelujah said how will it be he said the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you and this holy thing that'll be born to you shall be called The Son of God she said here I am I don't know how it's going to happen it don't make any difference you said so it's scriptural I believe it I accept it she started right out praising God before she felt life before she felt any sign of anything she didn't want no more signs she had his word and that was always necessary I like that Moses as soon as he got a hold of God and seen it was scripture here he went to Egypt he did as soon as Mary got a hold of an Angel got a hold of her brother and she seen him and know it was God because it was scriptural she took his word and went around testifying of something that didn't even show one evidence of ever being another thing she testified of something that never had happened before Oh Praise be the Lord she testified of something that never happened never had a virgin conceived but she had the Angel's word and the angel was scriptural yes so she know it was promised and the angel had the word of the Lord and promised it and because she thought herself humbly and lowly yet God had chose her so she's just happy about it and she went forth with her message telling everybody she's going to have a baby before she even had the first sign of a baby she didn't wait and say now wait let me feel and see if I feel any better or not no no oh God give us more marries B on and the rest of the world needs marries like that that can take God at his word and start rejoicing before anything happens what about you women in wheelchairs and you brothers and sisters here with heart trouble and sickness and everything when the the presence of the Lord is so close my my you know it's the word of the Lord the Lord promised it you say brother R if you'll come down lay hands on me that's not it you're already healed because he was wounded for your trans he was for your iniquity the chastisement your rep up on him and with his stri you were healed it's already a p him just receive it and start rejoicing thank you Lord I now see it let ask God I'm Healed I don't care what anybody else says or how I feel I'm Healed anyhow that's it the Angel's message it's always been that way that's the way God wants what did he do that change by taking God at his word change the whole natural course of life for her it'll do the same thing for you it certainly will it'll take you Center and wash you as white as snow it'll take you critic and make you one of us sure will that's right it'll take you that's sick and make you well it'll take you that's on your road to hell and change you around start you up to heaven just take him at his word and believe in and start rejoicing the messenger of the Lord is here the holy ghost moving around over the people anointing them if you're a stranger and you want Know What's mar at them people that's what it is Joy promised it on the day of Pentecost Peter said this is that I want to add something to that if this isn't that I want to keep this to that comes because I'm having awful good time with this now I believe this is that the same that that was that to that day oh Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Mary didn't wait she didn't care about critics she didn't care what anybody said she met an angel she seen his voice or seen his presence and she snowed he told her the truth because it was scriptural promis of a blessing to her just s and believe it and she know it was going to happen that's right oh she you something about when you hit something like that you can't keep still about it the angel told her that her cousin Elizabeth was uh up in the hilly country of Judea was old about 70 years old and she had conceived and was going to have a son it was already 6 months with her as a mother course a little baby little John hadn't had no life yet they kind he worried about so we find out that Elizabeth Zachariah was her husband which was a a priest yeah he was at the temple long about 6 months before this happened you know God gets getting things together amongst the humble people look at Zacharias now the angel Gabriel came to him he was in the temple ministering and when he did it burning incense was his lot standing at the altar and he happened to look at the right hand side the right hand side of the altar I guess you always wonder why I bring the people this way where he stands so at the right hand side of the Altar and there stood an angel and told him that at the days of his ministration there he was going home and be with his wife and she'd conceive and bear a son a child and that preacher doubted that word why he had many times if he was going to be the father of the child look at Sarah he had some examples in the Bible look at Hannah at the temple many examples like that and still he doubted how much difference it was from that callous uh teacher of philosophy how much difference there was in that Seminary Minister than there was in that little virgin she never questioned she said behold the hands of me of the Lord that's all she took him at his word and that's settled it amen but this man couldn't believe it he said I'm Gabriel that stands in the presence of God my word shall be fulfilled you know what he was talking about he said because you've doubted me you'll be dumb until the day the baby's born went home his wife conceived and hid herself 6 months Mary thought oh isn't that wonderful now I'm going to have a baby and there Elizabeth my cousin Jesus and John were second cousins there I tell you it's going to be wonderful because that she's going to have a baby and I'm going to have a baby I just can't hold it any longer I'm going right up to tell her right up to the mountain she went hard as she go I you see her pretty little face shining she's just about 18 years old imagine her black hair blowing back like that and she's on her Road this little robe wrapped around her and you know Elizabeth had hid herself I kind of like that I think it looks so disgraceful to see women out like there these shs on and things when they're to be mothers it looks pitiful what a difference that's horrible I know what you ought ought maybe not ought to say if I offend you you forgive me but You' listen to your doctor I'm your brother see so there the woman in that condition but she hid herself I can imagine her sitting back there you know kind of snubbing a little with the knitting some little what little booties you know getting them all ready like that and knitting a little blanket but she was feared because she said now I'm old and notice the angel of the Lord they were righteous Bible said her in Zechariah they were righteous keeping all the Commandments of God that's Where Angels appear always appears in a righteous family somewhere where God can use something something to work with and then she's making these little booties and I imagine it's a little window like it is in Palestine some sometimes not no window to light in it but just a little shade hanging down and she heard something she raised up and she looked coming up and she said you know I believe that looks like my cousin Mary look at her little face shine while she's grown up I hear she's going to get married so it must have been that uh well she's a young woman but that's married so she slipped her little robe on you know and runs out the meter and women in them days are not like they are now you know they I they run and throw their arms around one and hug one another you know I like friendliness don't you I I just hate to see this little old silly stuff in this 1960 version of friendliness oh my there's not enough of it now you Southerners down here don't notice the bad but up there oh my I went to my uncle here not long ago in New York he'd been living in one house 20 years and his neighbor Coes that Texas flag there to him I said who lives there I said I don't know I said you've fallen from Grace I said well said I said how long's you live there I said he's there when I come here you don't know your neighbor's dead till you read it the paper that's right no friendliness here not long ago brother Moore and I and brother Brown went down to see a little boy named David a few years ago down here in Cal or Florida they had us out there and and brother huster I believe it was told me said uh The Duchess wants to see you and I said the who said The Duchess I said what's that and said it's the woman owns all this property said she's wealthy well I said I can't serious too many sick people said but she's The Duchess I said that don't make her IND different from anybody else so he said well she had her there when I went out and when I went out I'm not God forgive me to if I you think I'm making fun of the woman or not but she had enough jewels on her hands to s a missionary around the world 10 times with the gospel standing out there and she had on a pair of specks she didn't have them on but she had them on a stick hold it out like this great big old fat lady and she come out I walked out the tent and I said well I ain't got time to see her if I got any time left let me see them sick people out there see and said but she let you have the ground I said well that's all right if you let David have the ground and we appreciate that but she's all right nothing wrong with her let me see these people down here well they want me to see her so when I went out she said are you Dr brandom I said no ma' I thought I'm brother brand she said now you know nobody can look through a pair of specks that far away from you and she looked her like me she said uh well Dr brandom she says I'm Charmed I reached up looked at that hand held out her hand to shake hands so I thought of be gentleman I got a hold of her big hand and pulled it down I said get it down here so I know you next time I see you like that oh I I like something feeling uh Paul Raider the man that wrote this song I sang your only belief said one morning him and his wife was have little Family Affair little fussing one another said first thing you know is reading the paper and she said something Paul will you give me some money said I ain't got no money and went on like that a little bit and said after a while he never noticed and hurt her feelings she kind of sat there and said well that's how easy your feelings hurt let her sit there you know how we do brotherr sometimes I guess and so then he said he she'd always stand at the door and kiss him when he went out then he go to the gate then we turn around he'd wave goodbye and she'd wave goodbye said he got up got his hat and said just let her pout it out said he went to the door and said stuck out her lips kissed her went out to end the gate turned around looked back said she just stand that door said he waved and she waved said he started on down the street said something begin to deal with you you done wrong Paul poor old Paul's in glory tonight but said you done wrong Paul why if something happened to her today said he got to think about oh my watch something happened you'll never see her again on earth oh my said he got worse worse said he said Lord forgive me I'll go back and make it
