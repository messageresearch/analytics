[45:43] and came to pass in those days that
[45:46] there were went out a decree from Caesar
[45:49] Augustus that all the world should be
[45:52] taxed yes
[46:01] let us approach the author
[46:04] and ask him to give us our daily potions
[46:08] Lord Jesus we're grateful to be in your
[46:11] house today
[46:14] and happy to see each and every one of
[46:17] of the your people that you have
[46:19] purchased with your own blood
[46:24] we asked father that when this is all
[46:27] over

[46:36] and happy to be here in your house
[46:39] we ask that you bless us in Jesus name
[46:43] amen
[46:46] amen amen and verse 2 verse and this
[46:51] taxing was first made when cyrenius was
[46:54] governor of Syria Syria
[47:02] and all went to be taxed everyone into
[47:05] his own City even though
[47:10] and Joseph also went up From Galilee out
[47:13] of the city of Nazareth unto Judea unto
[47:16] a city the the city of David which is
[47:19] called Bethlehem because he was of the
[47:22] house and lineage of Davido
[47:32] to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife
[47:35] being great with child
[47:43] and it was that uh it was that while
[47:48] they were there the days were
[47:49] accomplished that she should be
[47:51] delivered
[47:58] and she brought forth her firstborn son
[48:02] wrapped him in swaddling clothes
[48:06] and laid him in a Manger because there
[48:08] was no room in the Inn
[48:24] and this shall be a sign unto you you
[48:27] shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling
[48:30] clothes lying in a Manger
[48:34] is
[48:38] and this scripture is the majority of
[48:41] time we use it for Christmas time
[48:46] I want to entitle it again the
[48:50] folders
[48:53] this is again what a fold is
[48:57] it's a piece of cloth
[49:00] and when you do this number
[49:03] this is the fold and so is I want to
[49:07] find out this morning
[49:09] what is it exactly inside of the fold
[49:12] the question
[49:15] we we have folded it
[49:18] it's nice and pressed
[49:21] we put it in our pocket
[49:24] to be used
[49:32] now where you you'll find out and I I
[49:35] appreciate the word of God that's been
[49:37] coming from this sacred deaths
[49:43] last Sunday's message was my goodness
[49:46] gracious out of this world
[49:50] we will give the Lord Jesus Jesus
[49:57] now once again
[50:00] this is the fold what is in the folds
[50:07] when we understand this
[50:11] immediately it takes this to Saint John
[50:13] the 20th chapter
[50:17] and we appreciate the word of God
[50:21] Saint John when see a chapter
[50:25] you might not find a a a relationship
[50:28] with Luke Chapter 2.
[50:40] but some of the uh of the of the studied
[50:43] people
[50:46] and if you find the translation in
[50:49] Spanish
[50:52] you find out that the the the swaddling
[50:56] clothes
[51:06] that's used in chapter two of the book
[51:09] of uh of of Saint Luke
[51:13] is the same word that is used in Saint
[51:16] John the 20th chapter
[51:19] in San Juan capital of one is the birth
[51:24] one is for the burials
[51:27] now this is called the fold
[51:32] and the first day of the week chapter 20
[51:35] of the book of Saint John
[51:38] day of the week
[51:40] cometh Mary Magdalene early when it was
[51:43] yet dark unto the Sepulcher and seeth
[51:46] the stone taken away from the Sepulcher
[51:51] man
[51:57] then she then she runeth and cometh to
[52:01] Simon Peter and to the other the
[52:03] disciple
[52:06] unto them they have taken away the Lord
[52:08] out of the Sepulcher and we know not
[52:11] where they have laid him
[52:13] foreign
[52:24] Peter therefore went forth and that
[52:27] other disciple and came to the Sepulcher
[52:29] is
[52:32] and so they rambled together and the
[52:35] other disciple did outrun Peter and came
[52:37] forth to the sepulch down
[52:46] and he's stooping down verse 5.
[52:49] and solve the linen clothes lying yet
[52:52] when he not
[52:56] intro and then cometh Simon Peter
[52:59] following him and went into the
[53:01] Sepulcher and seeth the linen closed lie
[53:11] and the napkin that was about his head
[53:15] not lying with the linen clothes but
[53:19] wrath together in a place by itself
[53:31] when Joseph cuando Jose and and they he
[53:36] he asked for the body of Jesus
[53:39] and he desired that body
[53:44] and he put him in his own tomb
[53:48] and when they laid him there
[53:51] they put the Bible says
[53:54] a napkin over his face
[54:03] there is the napkin
[54:05] but I want you to notice
[54:08] that the napkin
[54:12] was not with the other burial clothes
[54:19] there there is a place
[54:22] where where the the scholar says
[54:27] it was folded neatly in a place by
[54:31] itself
[54:36] this takes it from Israeli or Hebrew
[54:39] traditions
[54:43] this is the way the master knew or or
[54:46] the servant knew that the master was
[54:48] done
[54:52] when the master was eating his food
[54:56] and he would get his napkin
[55:00] and he would put it like that
[55:04] it meant that he was done eating
[55:09] but when he was not done yet
[55:13] and he folded up his napkin
[55:17] and he put it right by his food
[55:21] it meant this is not done yet
[55:26] back very soon pronto
[55:30] so Jesus Jesus he understanding this
[55:37] that in the office of the son
[55:41] could only be limited to a certain
[55:44] degree
[55:47] the prophet of God says
[55:50] while he was here in the office of the
[55:53] sun
[55:56] about the Sevenfold glory of God
[56:00] he knew nothing about what was in the
[56:04] Fallen
[56:06] but when he end but when he goes up
[56:10] and he says all power is given to me in
[56:14] heaven and in Earth
[56:18] before he goes up
[56:20] he folds the napkin
[56:24] that was over his face
[56:27] to signify this
[56:30] I will be back very soon
[56:34] that's why he says in his words
[56:37] get a little while foreign
[57:06] take Claire
[57:08] why would he take care of
[57:13] Revelation the Revelation that was to be
[57:17] unfolded in the Book of Revelation
[57:20] of the apocalypses now the Revel
[57:23] revelation of Jesus Christ
[57:26] not so much brother Branham says
[57:30] show the deity of his personality
[57:39] what he would be doing
[57:41] in his work in his body in
[57:45] other words is this
[57:48] he knew nothing about what was in the
[57:54] folded it
[57:55] went up into heaven
[57:58] received all powers
[58:01] the fold has got to be unfolded all
[58:04] right
[58:06] that's what Revelation means
[58:09] isolation means this is
[58:17] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[58:28] things that are in the fall because
[58:40] people don't believe in a five-fold much
[58:47] this is what brother Branham says
[58:51] when he asked Jack Moore this question
[58:55] he says Revelation chapter one who is
[58:58] this
[59:00] he says it is Jesus Christ in glorified
[59:04] conditions
[59:07] and he says it does not gel it is
[59:11] it's not in the
[59:14] foldable bless
[59:17] because it is Jesus Christ in glorified
[59:20] conditions
[59:25] to find out and you've got to unveil and
[59:29] you've got to unfold
[59:31] what is this now
[59:36] Ezekiel
[59:38] Tu is
[59:40] the Book of Ezekiel
[59:43] chapter 2. capital of us tells us this
[59:48] this is I believe a tremendous scripture
[59:53] why is it that people don't want the
[59:56] five-fold ministry ministerio
[1:00:01] Jesus did Jesus
[1:00:04] he found it important to
[1:00:06] fold the napkin is
[1:00:12] in in Ezekiel
[1:00:16] and verse 9 it simply says
[1:00:20] this is a great this is a great a Great
[1:00:23] Book
[1:00:27] and when I looked
[1:00:29] behold in hand was sent unto me
[1:00:33] and lo a roll of a book was therein
[1:00:42] um
[1:00:43] to me I find out that there are five
[1:00:47] it's a five-fold it's five offices
[1:00:54] why is it that the messenger or the
[1:00:57] message of the hours
[1:00:59] and those that claim the message of the
[1:01:02] hours
[1:01:04] will tell us that there are three
[1:01:06] offices of one God
[1:01:11] the other five offices of the five-fold
[1:01:19] as Jesus thought it was important Jesus
[1:01:24] that he had to fold it
[1:01:29] meaning I'll be back very soon
[1:01:35] now now when you see a star a rock
[1:01:39] understood
[1:01:40] you know we about 10 years ago we were
[1:01:43] able to go to to Alaska
[1:01:46] I took my wife on a cruise
[1:01:50] what a great time we have to be Muslim
[1:01:53] Grand Temple but I remember what the the
[1:01:56] the man was telling us
[1:01:59] he says you see the glacier is
[1:02:05] you you see the glacier Los glacieres
[1:02:08] that is snow that fell 150 years ago
[1:02:15] so when you see a star is
[1:02:19] looking at a star out there is
[1:02:39] now this is what I believe people have
[1:02:43] have thought about the message of the
[1:02:45] hours
[1:02:48] people say is history
[1:02:51] is
[1:02:53] and I say this you're the worst it all
[1:02:56] depends which point of the trajectory
[1:02:59] you are towards that started
[1:03:05] when you see that light of that storm
[1:03:11] it seems like that is already history to
[1:03:15] you
[1:03:16] and the word of God can remain history
[1:03:20] to you
[1:03:23] unless you're able I'm asking to ride
[1:03:27] the light
[1:03:30] to ride the light
[1:03:33] back to the origin
[1:03:36] when the light was sent off
[1:03:41] that's why people will just say I press
[1:03:44] play
[1:03:47] and I press play too Bliss
[1:04:23] man
[1:04:24] now order look at the stars
[1:04:28] you know you climb the pyramid
[1:04:33] and when you climb the pyramid
[1:04:36] you're gonna see the star
[1:04:40] this is what happens to the majority of
[1:04:42] people
[1:04:44] they come to the message
[1:04:47] they say who God
[1:04:50] sentios and there was no mightier
[1:04:53] Prophet than our prophets
[1:04:58] that was Elijah the prophet Elias is
[1:05:06] what a man that we have received in our
[1:05:10] time
[1:05:11] but we can say that is history
[1:05:15] or we can ride the light
[1:05:18] those were the origins of the light has
[1:05:23] come to us
[1:05:25] now it all depends so depending on where
[1:05:29] you live
[1:05:31] that's the reason
[1:05:34] he folded his napkin
[1:05:39] back very soon
[1:05:43] here I will be okay yesterday it won't
[1:05:47] be just one Jesus
[1:05:50] in the day of Pentecost
[1:05:53] there's the devil was so confused
[1:05:59] he looked at one man
[1:06:04] called Jesus Jesus and he said I got him
[1:06:07] finished
[1:06:12] the fall started to unfold
[1:06:18] started to unfold
[1:06:23] pronto
[1:06:42] what was he going to do
[1:06:45] it brings me back again
[1:06:50] it got real sick
[1:06:53] and I say this in time and time again
[1:06:57] until we really get it for ourselves
[1:07:04] they asked our pastor
[1:07:07] Pastor what will you do now that your
[1:07:10] papa uh he he's got really sick
[1:07:17] and his answer I'll never forget this
[1:07:21] it says what was the Holy Ghost given
[1:07:24] foreign
[1:07:40] you can go to Pentecostal church
[1:07:44] and you can feel good
[1:07:47] the music can come
[1:07:50] we can all dance but that's only in the
[1:07:54] flesh
[1:07:55] that has nothing to do within the folds
[1:07:59] That's Just In the Flesh because right
[1:08:03] now
[1:08:04] we don't live in the dispensation of the
[1:08:07] outpouring of the Holy Spirit
[1:08:23] of last
[1:08:27] and when I looked entrances
[1:08:54] where what are you gonna do now

[1:10:20] before I come here I listen to Brothers
[1:10:31] I press play
[1:10:34] the message that is written in between
[1:10:37] the lines
[1:10:40] [Music]
[1:10:42] that's the drama this is the drama
[1:10:44] that's where Christ is revealed in his
[1:10:48] own words
[1:10:50] Christ the Mysteries please tell me God
[1:10:54] reveals
[1:10:56] now what am I what what do I say
[1:10:59] you got you got you got to do something
[1:11:01] about it you started contest
[1:11:05] we young ministers and I'm going to say

[1:11:12] we got to do something
[1:11:14] I see brother Favio back there
[1:11:18] I saw my Papa this morning
[1:11:21] these are men to be wondered
[1:11:25] they're they're they're they're they're
[1:11:27] an endangered species
[1:11:30] there are men that have given their
[1:11:33] whole lives
[1:11:35] these are men
[1:11:37] not men just of just any type of
[1:11:41] these are men that have come out of the
[1:11:44] folds
[1:11:46] I'll be back very soon
[1:11:51] if you don't find what God Said in the
[1:11:54] word
[1:11:56] the fading in your life foreign
[1:12:33] aura
[1:12:36] in the book of haggai
[1:12:40] chapter one
[1:12:42] he said thus speak at verse 2 the Lord
[1:12:45] of hosts
[1:12:48] saying this people say is
[1:12:52] the time is not come
[1:12:59] and we can sit up stand up here
[1:13:04] and tell you it is seedless that the
[1:13:07] Holy Ghost is yours
[1:13:10] and every promise is yours
[1:13:13] but then you're here
[1:13:16] the Lord of hosts saying
[1:13:19] he doesn't say my people
[1:13:23] he said this people is
[1:13:27] the time has not come
[1:13:33] and we sit down in our Pew
[1:13:36] what are you waiting foreign
[1:14:27] you know
[1:14:29] you know and up until the day that my
[1:14:31] papa got sick
[1:14:34] he was doing something for the Lord
[1:14:40] and you know being where he's at
[1:14:43] somebody's sick
[1:14:45] he walks by them
[1:14:48] he says the Lord's going to heal you
[1:14:51] and that person gets healed it is
[1:14:55] [Music]
[1:14:57] I'm in Africa and we're having a prayer
[1:15:01] line
[1:15:02] we're not putting our hands on the
[1:15:04] people
[1:15:06] and as we're putting as we are in the
[1:15:09] prayer line
[1:15:10] I feel my dad's hand right on my
[1:15:13] shoulders
[1:15:14] because even when he's sick
[1:15:17] the fold isn't it
[1:15:23] [Applause]
[1:15:26] the old has the power
[1:15:30] to create worlds foreign
[1:15:41] [Music]
[1:16:16] now
[1:16:18] the time has not come
[1:16:21] we have an actor because the time is
[1:16:23] income
[1:16:25] I will tell you when the time has come
[1:16:27] yeah
[1:16:28] and it's not right now
[1:16:30] I'm just gonna stay home
[1:16:33] and I'll wait for the time to come
[1:16:36] and when the time comes
[1:16:40] because Gabriel will blow a trumpet
[1:16:50] and then I'll know
[1:16:54] the time has not come
[1:16:59] verse three that's what this then came
[1:17:02] the word of of hagai the Prophet saying
[1:17:08] I'm going to repeat it
[1:17:10] I'm going to say it right
[1:17:13] then came the word of the Lord by haggai
[1:17:16] the prophet saying
[1:17:20] is it time for you
[1:17:28] I really don't care what they say about
[1:17:30] us
[1:17:32] I don't care what denomination has to
[1:17:35] say
[1:17:36] I really don't care what people say if
[1:17:39] they say there's no five-fold or nothing
[1:17:41] I will say this is
[1:17:54] because who was he going to empty into
[1:18:00] yes
[1:18:04] again after this if there's no fivefold
[1:18:08] you know I came to play there's no seven
[1:18:11] pole Glory glorious
[1:18:15] then came the word
[1:18:17] the word of the Lord by hagai the
[1:18:19] prophets
[1:18:22] is it time for you
[1:18:26] we've come to the house of the Lord my
[1:18:28] name is
[1:18:33] we're professional Christians
[1:18:36] professionals not inside of our hearts
[1:18:39] we're looking for something
[1:18:43] and brother Brandon says
[1:18:45] if you want something to happen
[1:18:54] right glory is it time for you
[1:19:04] [Applause]
[1:19:07] every generation has got to to answer
[1:19:10] that is
[1:19:13] what would make my papa and brother
[1:19:15] Fabio and brother Caleb travel the way
[1:19:18] they do yes
[1:19:22] what would make my uncle Abraham study
[1:19:25] the way he did yes
[1:19:28] just so he could be a scholar
[1:19:33] so he could be a learned man
[1:19:40] it is
[1:19:41] [Applause]
[1:19:46] I guess I I I'll go to church and raise
[1:19:48] up my hands
[1:19:51] don't do me no favors
[1:19:53] don't do that to nobody do that for
[1:19:57] yourself
[1:19:58] when you come to the house of the Lord
[1:20:01] raise up your hands
[1:20:04] because it's my time because
[1:20:08] who do you think you are
[1:20:11] nobody but I am a sinner
[1:20:16] but in the foreign
[1:20:36] and why people say there is no life in
[1:20:39] the message
[1:20:41] let me tell you
[1:20:45] Uganda differs differs with that opinion
[1:20:49] get first with that opinion
[1:20:52] America is different differs from that
[1:20:55] opinion
[1:21:01] amen they differ from that opinion
[1:21:03] because they know
[1:21:11] time for you
[1:21:20] now if you were the Price Is Right
[1:21:26] I know how people get with
[1:21:29] I think it was Bob Barker
[1:21:32] Barker and he would say now you're going
[1:21:36] to have to put the time and the money
[1:21:38] what it is
[1:21:40] and whoever comes closest
[1:21:43] got a shot at a lot of money
[1:21:47] and they would announce the name
[1:21:54] come on down
[1:21:58] hahaha
[1:22:01] and it was just a great show
[1:22:04] and people would ride
[1:22:06] and they would love it
[1:22:09] Hallelujah
[1:22:11] acting crazier than crazy
[1:22:13] because they had a chance
[1:22:17] in this role and they said Royal you
[1:22:20] don't have a question
[1:22:22] you are blessed beyond all measures
[1:22:31] you've been Justified
[1:22:37] you were elected of God before the
[1:22:40] family
[1:22:44] amen
[1:22:48] so if the word would tell you this is
[1:22:58] now the seal does not say the name it is
[1:23:11] but you by faith
[1:23:14] when you somebody says is it time for
[1:23:18] you
[1:23:19] talking about me
[1:23:23] come on down
[1:23:27] [Applause]
[1:23:32] we've been so privileged by God in this
[1:23:34] church
[1:23:40] I would never say that we are the best
[1:23:42] in the world
[1:23:44] but I'll tell you one thing we have been
[1:23:48] so blessed by God
[1:23:50] to have a founding Pastor
[1:23:54] you have a pastor the way we do
[1:23:57] friends the way we did
[1:23:59] a Ministry
[1:24:05] and my question to you this is
[1:24:16] [Music]
[1:24:18] what's it time for you to do what is
[1:24:22] wander around
[1:24:25] nobody loves me
[1:24:27] and you know what if God really loved me
[1:24:31] give me a steak um
[1:24:43] now I've got so much business
[1:24:49] well you asked him for it
[1:24:52] and you asked him Lord I love you
[1:24:56] and he's giving you power
[1:24:59] to become a son of God
[1:25:04] foreign
[1:25:10] and when the world gives you a little
[1:25:13] [Music]
[1:25:13] um
[1:25:22] over there where I live and you get all
[1:25:25] happy yeah
[1:25:30] but you see you hear the song leader
[1:25:33] says Oh How I Love Jesus Jesus raise up
[1:25:38] your hands
[1:25:42] until you find out
[1:25:45] you open up one of the sales
[1:25:48] that's what Elijah brother Branham says
[1:25:52] he was all by himself
[1:25:56] he opened up one of them
[1:25:59] they found his name
[1:26:10] that's why we don't ask for no
[1:26:12] forgiveness
[1:26:15] you can't preacher
[1:26:18] man didn't give me my gift
[1:26:22] man Jesus Jesus
[1:26:25] folded his napkins
[1:26:28] I'll be back real soon
[1:26:33] don't blame me
[1:26:35] you if you have somebody to blame
[1:26:39] he was just looking ahead in time
[1:26:56] that belongs to each and everywhere
[1:27:05] play play the tape play the tape can you
[1:27:07] play it
[1:27:12] this is something I like you to see
[1:27:15] our pastor sent me this yesterday
[1:27:20] now therefore thus saith the Lord of
[1:27:22] hosts
[1:27:24] all right here he goes
[1:27:26] I have all my faith
[1:27:45] the young man can do nothing without the
[1:27:47] old
[1:27:50] but he has to be proven
[1:27:53] it has to be cut from the same cloth
[1:27:58] that's why God sent the prophet I love
[1:28:01] you to the Widow
[1:28:04] material he was a prophet who was of the
[1:28:07] same materials
[1:28:15] we can't be different
[1:28:19] somebody told me here since 1970. it's
[1:28:22] not possible
[1:28:29] Don't Tell Me
[1:28:31] Jesus is
[1:28:33] my brother
[1:28:38] [Music]
[1:28:40] he's my brother
[1:28:47] you'll find out he has to be your
[1:28:49] brother
[1:28:51] and surrender all
[1:29:01] we love you
[1:29:12] the prophet of God says this is
[1:29:15] it's like firing a rocket there is
[1:29:23] when you fired and he fired William
[1:29:26] Branham into the air
[1:29:31] did he stay by himself
[1:29:36] Believers
[1:29:38] you heard our Pastor said no sir
[1:29:41] did he stay by himself
[1:29:47] this is the way the rocket went
[1:29:50] and when it ran up
[1:29:52] it exploded
[1:29:55] that one that went up
[1:29:58] the prophet of God says
[1:30:00] from that one yeah
[1:30:04] five more came out salieron
[1:30:10] ahead
[1:30:11] I didn't say that you know it's what was
[1:30:15] in the phone

[1:30:21] rocket exploded
[1:30:26] five more stars came out of them

[1:30:35] apostle foreign
