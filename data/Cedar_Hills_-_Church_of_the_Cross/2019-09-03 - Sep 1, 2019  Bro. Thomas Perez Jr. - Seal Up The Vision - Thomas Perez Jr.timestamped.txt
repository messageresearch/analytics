[44:32] Como's don't dissemble we have missed
[44:35] the Word of God the most ironic
[44:37] the Word of God is the progressive
[44:39] revelation or couple of releases una
[44:41] palabra broken in other words you always
[44:43] gotta keep on going forward
[44:45] you know just Belarus this year pretty
[44:47] nickel continue our series oil on top
[44:49] you said pattern you sin whose they pick
[44:52] up if you stopped you spit butter you
[44:56] miss the mark
[44:57] crystal ero Lamar if you stopped you
[44:59] stayed pirate that's not your goal Lewis

[45:07] right now
[45:07] the only goal Onika miss to be able to
[45:10] go to where God wants you to oval then
[45:13] either the youth Kirika state but yeah
[45:15] now I believe in dreams yo creo in
[45:17] swingers I do believe in dreams secrets
[45:20] with you I believe that dreams are given
[45:22] to us by God creo que los sueños and
[45:24] those ordeals in order to be able to
[45:27] help us but up with a regular nose but I
[45:30] do believe this through your career that
[45:32] a dream does not just stay a dream kills
[45:36] when you know secure simplemente OS when
[45:38] you I believe that a dream interpreted
[45:41] joke real kills when you interpreter
[45:43] becomes a vision Jake as the rebus you
[45:46] so then as long as your dream remains a
[45:50] dream interest is loose when you / -
[45:52] concern you never produced the product
[45:55] Google are pros here because a dream is
[45:57] in the heavens for cues for yourself but
[46:00] a vision una be serious the tangible
[46:02] part of guys - you realize but if the
[46:10] proposition to either
[46:11] that's why people don't advance for this
[46:13] is killer hit they know unless they
[46:14] become what are you gonna stay out now I
[46:17] want you to notice in the context
[46:19] because they become dreamers what are
[46:22] you gonna say Lou yellow days tomorrow
[46:24] I'm gonna be better and you know what
[46:26] you serve me well at least I'm not as
[46:27] bad as I used to be that's a dream it
[46:34] has not become the interpretation matter
[46:38] feel um tangible you wanna go certain
[46:41] chiefly in su vida that's why when when
[46:44] the inauguration is given to us
[46:46] what is quandary never seen a sign me up
[46:49] so our Peter put in a postal proposal
[46:53] bezel he tells us that your young men
[46:55] shall see visions physical hone a bit on
[46:57] beef you and your old men shall dream
[46:59] dreams you know sandals on your and
[47:02] swinging I believe with all my heart
[47:04] took it open pull I have a hat dream yes
[47:07] in your Phineas I know what God wants me
[47:10] to do just say look at your skin look at
[47:12] your when I dream pero cuando yo suing
[47:14] you the vision is what happens next
[47:17] Lavie soon in Lucas who say it is the
[47:19] tangible part of God in my life apart
[47:22] attentively did you see me neither if I
[47:24] don't let the Word of God become a
[47:27] reality you know for me to get up a
[47:29] leverage again already
[47:30] I always be a dream pretty much loose
[47:33] when you

[47:51] vision they require at least when
[47:53] projected the visions of predict or
[47:57] he'll produce the person he grace
[48:00] produced elaborate lies was done away
[48:05] ways for a producer come because now you
[48:07] had heaven dispute of the dream dance
[48:12] when you that's why there's a man great
[48:15] a great a man of the civil rights
[48:18] movement

[50:03] Lord answered me yes in your room I
[50:05] could bestow and said it is right the
[50:07] vision it's creamier vision and make it
[50:09] plain upon table she also didn't listen
