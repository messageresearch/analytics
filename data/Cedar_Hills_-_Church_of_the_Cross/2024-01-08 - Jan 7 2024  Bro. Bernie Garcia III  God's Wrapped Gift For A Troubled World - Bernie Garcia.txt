from somebody that that's already gone to Glory I can't give it back to that person but I'll give it wherever I can hey Hallelujah I I'll let you sit down in a minute not yet plot twist H if we would open up our scriptures praise the lord it's a it's service I understand for Young People In the Flesh and the Youth of heart and those youth in spirit as well I see a bunch of 20y old something here so so brother Caleb said I can wear this shirt I got my my app eight shirt here can we get a round of applause for that beautiful if you don't know what app8 is educate yourself you go to this church I'm not going to tell you but that Christmas album was beautiful brother all the other videos of the You Youth up their playing I am very blessed and humbl to be associated with you God bless bless you today we're going to be turning to Luke 2 verse 12 the thought that I have this morning uh this evening is God's wrapped gift for a troubled World Luke 2 when you have it you can say Amen verse 12 am and this shall be a sign unto you ye shall find the Babe WRA and swaddling cloths lying in a Manger if you would turn to Proverbs 1816 and while you while you're finding your scripture Proverbs 1816 I just want to take a moment and uh greet my friends on the internet can can we wave at the cameras there you go brother Tim I I had them wave at the cameras okay I have a cousin Tim he's in Phoenix Phoenix Tim Garcia Jr Tim Garcia Jr he he was here not too long ago I believe man his if you would have known him before the Lord got him then you'd appreciate what he preached a lot more we are surrounded by living testimonies and he knew me before the Lord got me and I'm just grateful he's still my friend but Proverbs 1816 God bless you everybody on the internet a gift opens the way and ushers The Giver into the presence of the great you may be seated God bless you the the uh um I just want to read something SC uh the Lord just put this on my heart right now it wasn't a part of the rest of my message but I'm praying that when we follow the Holy Spirit he'll tie everything in um second chronicles 25 so 2 Chronicles 25 verse 2 and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord but not with a perfect heart we can do the right thing and still not have a perfect heart I'll let that sink in for a little bit today's going to be a little bit different brother I know it's youth service and I I know you have tremendous preachers here and I don't want to preach your ear off but I just wanted to open my heart to you you know brother Caleb you preached a a trend tremendous message in your series of I believe is Israel and the church and one thing that you said that really impacted me that the blood of Jesus Christ the bride is the doormat to Divine Fellowship it's the entrance mat and in order to enter into a Divine Fellowship we got to get past this veil of Flesh see God go he pulled back the curtain of time and he entered into a veil of Flesh so that we can have fellowship with him and his provided way for us to have Divine Fellowship to have a deeper relationship was to get past this Veil and enter into the blood so today I just want to help get past my flesh I'm gonna cut open my chest and pull out my heart and I'm going to just show [Music] you a little bit of what's in my heart and I hope that uh in the process we could get to know each other a little bit better and that the Holy Spirit could come and reveal to you what it is that he has and that is his wrapped gift for this troubled world Amen I'm going to ask my buddy can you just come up one more time uh will can you get on the piano I want to sing some songs and the other musicians who want to get on the drums today's going to be a singspiration testimony preaching I want to sing a few songs and I want to testify what inspiration brought forth that song you know it's good to have a book but it's even cooler if you know the author of that book it's great to know the Bible come on somebody you know where I'm going it's great to quote the scriptures but it's kind of cool and it's absolutely necessary to know the author of the script so I'm just want to sing a couple of songs

hallelujah do you know who your lord is my Lord walks on the [Music] water my Lord's voice coms the stor my Lord leads me through the fire my Lord is Lord of lords my Lord died but on the third day W let me tell you death couldn't hold him anymore I know he lives because he holds me my Lord is a lord Lords um how many know the Lord in the power of his resurrection what a gift to a troubled world and it all depends on our attitude towards that gift you know the angel came to Mary and he gave her a message you're going to give birth to a child that the holy spirit will put inside your stomach scripture says she was troubled so it's not about avoiding the trouble it's about how we respond when we're troubled now King Herod got a message from the Magi from the three wise men where is this that should be born King of the Jews we saw the sign in the heavens we follow the star and we have come to worship and here Herod was troubled and all of Israel with him but how did he respond to that trouble it was the same message that the savior of the world has come Mary troubled had one attitude Herod troubled had another attitude and if you don't make the right choice when you're troubled when you're standing in the valley of decision in the Valley of the shadow of death oh how many are afraid of the Valley of the shadow of death let me give you a secret about a shadow a shadow never hurt nobody you would never been slapped by my shadow a shadow never stab a shadow of a sword never stabbed anybody a shadow of a gun never shot anybody either the shadow of Co never got anybody sick that's why the psalmist said yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death come at me bro what I shall fear no EV for thou art with me th rod and th staff they comfort me when you're standing in the valley of decision and you're troubled what is our attitude in that trouble the Virgin Mary said o how can this be it's okay to have questions how can this be what am I going to do how can you go tell Daddy like what's going on here like no she said be it unto me according to your word be it unto me say me according to your word she didn't even ask for a letter of recommendation she didn't ask for for him to to to show his credentials how long have you been um mentoring young ladies like should I take your advice she heard the word though it troubled her be it unto me according to your word and King Herod in his trouble he had such a a panic spell he entered into such a state of anxiety oh my goodness that he caused all the young children two years and younger to be slaughtered so depending on how you react to your trouble you can bring life just like Mary brought life or you can produce death and it depends on your attitude now brother brandham taught us he said the right mental at to the Divine Promises of God that gives you the right to the Token to have the right mental attitude can can you imagine being in Egypt and then Mom and Daddy are there talking with the adults and then all of a sudden do they see blood be spread on the door mantel imagine having the attitude like I'm not going to put that on my door I just painted my house you know how hard it was to build this house but then there's one little kid he's like Dad Dad I heard that the death Angel's going to pass are you sure you got all the all the mantle because I don't want to have to remind you but I'm your first born are you sure daddy you got all the blood on there see a lot of us we want to dance in Jubilee on the other side of the Red Sea but we haven't even left Egypt and we haven't even applied the blood on the but we want to have a jubilee with the tambourines on the other side of the Red Sea how was your attitude when we said put the blood on the door poost oh Hallelujah if youu how many have been transformed by that blood Hallelujah yeah I would love to invite my sons can you sing the song with me boys Lizzy can you come up with them we're going to sing together we're going to sing he's the same yesterday today and forever this is the story of Moses he's at the Red Sea with the children of Israel Israelites complaining why did you bring us here Moses what a horrible attitude but we serve a god rich in Mercy that he brought us a long way brother William would you play in the in G goon we did it yesterday do you [Music] remember so I hope we painted a good picture for you are you [Music] there are you bored young people no okay well well help me out okay we're going to dramatize this a little bit see the Lord said that he God gave gifts some to preach some to sing some gifts of healing he said he gave some gifts to dramatize if you would help me dramatize this a little bit we are going to be the children of Israel you're going to be the children of Israel so look at each other and complain a little bit you what are we doing here come on P push somebody say what are we doing here oh now look over to me say Moses why' you bring us here oh I hope we don't have that attitude when brother Caleb tells us to do [Music] something we want to listen to our pastor so there was Moses there at the Red Sea you [Music] ready they were standing between the ocean and Pharaoh's Army when Moses told them be still and wash the hand of God he will see us through then came fire then came fire with Heaven's forces and block those Chariot horses he is still the fire standing God he will see us through cuz he's the same cuz he's the same yesterday and today and forever with all things are possible he Master The Impossible is the and the W they obey when he tells them [Music] Fe my God will see us through then mes gri his rock as voice in the CR as him where's your God but despite the doubt he I still believe je God he will see us through then the Breath of God split open then the the Breath of God split open the Deep Red Sea and they the he's one with Drive he's still the belly of breaking God he will he is the same yesterday and today and forever God all things are possible Master be impossible in the way and the way oy he tell my God will see us [Music] through He is wonderful and Victorious Mighty conquerer faithful to deliver us what he did that day my God will do again because he still yesterday and today and forever we God all things are possible The Impossible if the wind and the Wy be still my God will see us [Music] through my God will see us through can you say that with us say my God will see us through my God will see us through one more time my God God will see us my God will see us through he give the Lord a hand of [Music] Praise oh praise the lord we serve a living God he will see us through how many have already been seen through that we can testify that he is is the same yesterday today and forever you know there was a young man is a story that I love that he received a gift from his father that's the the message today God's wrapped gift so as I'm speaking you're going to have to unrap it as I'm singing you're going to have to unwrap it that's how the gift Works how many appreciated the son of man revealed this morning you know this this certain son he had this great accomplishment and they were going to throw a celebration party cuz he had graduated and he had mentioned a need for a car so he built up this expectation he was going to get a car as a gift from his father his father was a wealthy man and so he expected a a generous gift and when it came time for the celebration he got handed a gift and it was about the size of my Bible wrapped up and anybody who held that gift knew that it was a Bible it obviously wasn't a car and that son in his [Music] disappointment and in his trouble he just so offended I I know my dad makes this much money he gave my other brother such and such a gift he sent my sister on vacation to such and such a place he knows I already have a Bible he gives me a Bible he was so upset that he broke the relationship with his father years went by he didn't speak to his father Christmas Thanksgiving birthdays he never went back to visit his father until his father got sick and and eventually passed away and while Mom was doing the cleanup of Dad's things after the [Music] funeral she handed a box to the son which in the contents it included that gift that he never opened and in his Despair and his regret he opened up that gift and started flipping through the pages of the Bible that his father had got gave gifted to him and it opened up to a page and it was highlighted if you being a wicked father knows how to give good gifts to your children how much more our heavenly father gives to those who ask you you you know that scripture more or less and on that page where that scripture was highlighted was a check for the exact amount of money that that boy needed for his car it was in here all along but he never bothered to open the gift now every single Divine promise front row every single thing you desire that you need God has already wrapped it and gifted it to you and all we have to do is open it every single trial every single question does it pass the word test it's right here for us young people the good thing about this gift is it's the gift that keeps on giving and once you've received this gift I'm I'm holding the Bible as a visual this is the word but we know that John tells us that in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word became fles and dwelt among us and then everything that God was he poured it into Jesus Christ and everything that Jesus was he poured it into his church so he was that wrapped gift and he poured himself in you then you are God's wrapped gift in human flesh for a troubled world that is the message of the Gospel it's Messiah present tent it's Messiah the Messianic Empire King Jesus doing the same work that he did in the book of Acts today with you with you through you using your hands using your feet using your mouth to heal this world am for those that would believe and accept it that's the gospel you know one time I was in barber school and I lost track of time brother Caleb just flagged me down I don't know how much time I have left but I I'll I'll wrap it up I was in barber school I'm a a barber instructor and there was a young guy in there getting a haircut and he got so upset at the student bro you messed up my Edge up oh you messed up my hairline man he started going and going and going and going on about it some of you can relate you're like oh yeah man don't mess with my Edge up bro but this guy Omar this guy got so upset that he pulled out a gun 20 year old 20 years old pulls out a gun and starts waving it around to show off that he's a big guy and and everybody was just terrified and petrified this guy got a gun crazy and the spirit of the Lord came down upon me and the reason I know it was the spirit of the Lord is because I didn't feel it because sometimes when I feel it it's not the Lord when I think I'm inspired I'm not that's just my imagination I got a good imagination I've messed up a lot of things thinking that it was the spirit of the Lord but I didn't realize what was going on and only looking back can I see wow that was God's grace what happened was you see what happened was I just he had a gun and I said sir why are you waving your why are you flexing that you have a gun you know I got a gun too and you don't see me waving it around everywhere he go oh yeah you got a gun what kind of gun do you got I said I got a 316 KJV what do you know about that the Lord is my witness that's what I said I'm not faking it I said I got a 316 KJV what do you know about that he's like 316 KJV I said yes John 3:16 from the King James version of the Bible for God so Lov the world that he gave his only begotten son thato believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life I said young man that gun might do something for you here in this world but one day you're going to stand before almighty God in judgment and that gun won't do anything for you there he goes hey homie go put this in the car and I said thank you now sit down and I'll fix your haircut and for the next 30 minutes I talked to him about the gospel and about how his choices had led him down the wrong path but that God is so rich in Mercy that if he would give his life to the Lord Jesus Christ he would change his life got up shook my hand gave me a hug and said thank you for those words of wisdom sir now he left only God knows what happened to him but the lives of those Barber students were never the same and a couple weeks afterwards I baptized one of them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ tattoos all the way up to his chin he was a a drug Smuggler he had a order that he was going to pick up that day to make money when he gave his life to the Lord right there in the barber in barber school he made a phone call he said hey bro I'm not going to pick up that order because I'm going to change my life today and his life was transformed that's same day he called me up and he said you know what Bernie I was on my way to the strip club after school and I said re what about your wife he said that's the thing for the first time I thought about her and I said I wouldn't want her to go even though she doesn't complain about it I want to consider her so I turned around and I went home and spent time with my wife and I told her that I was going to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and she looked at me like I was crazy but she said okay okay brought her to church baptized him his dad came to church we had lunch at my dad's house because God when he started start something he finishes it and you might look at your life and think that you're a wreck you might look at your life and you might think there's so many imperfections but one day there was a master sculptor and he was sculpting a masterpiece and this beautiful statue of Moses was there and the the the the the the sculpture got so inspired brother brandham says he took his hammer and he struck it speak but then he chipped it but that imperfection and the inspiration behind it is what made it a masterpiece so don't look at your weaknesses when the Devil comes and tells you you're weak Christian yes but it is written in my weakness he is made strong oh Hallelujah when he said you can't overcome yes but it is written he made us more than conquerors cuz it was written that's the only defense we have that's the gift today is God's word written on the tablets of your heart living out the gospel for everybody to see so that they can have the hope to receive and know Jesus Christ and the glory of his resurrection praise the Lord would you please stand David if
