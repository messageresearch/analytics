the he the angels are ready and I believe the bride is also ready if you allow me for some few minutes give you some tools so that you are prepared and so that you're ready that's why we come to prayer [Music] service if we open our Bibles to John 11 and verse 40 right many of us know this scripture by memory those seeing us via internet may God bless you thank you for connecting the scripture says and if you could please stand scripture says verse 39 Jesus said take you away the stone Martha the sister of him that was dead said unto him Lord by this time he stinketh for Heath been dead four days and Jesus said unto her said I not unto thee that if thou would wouldest believe thou shouldest see the glory of God then they took away the Stone from the place where the dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I thank thee that thou Hast heard me let's pray Lord we thank you for your word Lord Inspire us today then Lord prepare us as Prayer Warriors for the honor and Glory of your name that is our prayer Lord if you may please take your seat give me your undivided attention for minutes let me catch your attention we've heard of great preachers of famous men they have been used by the Holy Spirit tremendously but still I have not seen yet the first that has done the same as what happened here a dead man four four days he he was rotting corrupt this is something impossible let me put it better of the impossible this is the most impossible that humanly could could occur but hear the word brother Paul have I not told you if you believe you would see the glory of God and I ask this this even what is your impossible what is your difficulty what is that which cannot be resolved is there something more difficult than to raise a dead man that's been dead for four days Jesus said for God there is nothing I want you to repeat that word and and pronounce his name say you put your name there brother Noah for God nothing is impossible and and and that puts us a little bit better and let me give you something even better I I tell my children if I want to be someone and I say it truthfully I want to be just anyone I want to be just anyone don't lift me up or do any of those things I say it from my heart because I want to be just anybody because Jesus said anyone that tells this mountain anyone not the great one not not the Lord or the Theologian no no no no no anyone anyone anyone look son anyone that tells this mountain be removed and and does not doubt it shall be done that's for me I'm anyone who is anyone amen you have to believe it because God ask of that to please him it is necessary that he that draws near to him believe that he is and he is a rewarder of those that seek him there's Angels ready prepared to to execute in favor of the redeemed what is your problem do not fear your problem these words of Jesus they are the most special when he says father I thank you because you hear me he said it publicly he wanted the people to be assured that their prayers were heard there's people oh the prayers once again oh you know how it goes don't let that attitude enter if I see that God hears someone's prayer I want to get close to that someone because I want to learn if God hears him I want to learn so that he can also hear me let us pray let let us run uh towards hell and all those spirits that Satan sends to torment us that's the best that God can give us I said that the right way it's the best that God can can give us because that is where God will bring out the best there that is where you can prove to the devil that you are a son of God that is where you can tell God that you trust in him that's where the scripture says the best we can do as Christians is to wait on God because the Bible says that God is good with those that wait don't be impatient but wait for he is good with those that we let us pray brother let us pray let us believe if you feel in your heart come to the altar do it praise God lift up your hand and say Lord thank you God sent a perfect sacrifice to make you a son and daughter of God and the best thing he sent a prophet with a message to tell us that we are his beloved we are his chosen one and that heaven is supporting us backing us up so let us believe if you want to stand you may do so if you want to be under your knees do you may do so let us let us pray Lord we thank you for this moment father We Worship You Lord you are perfect Lord our King how much we love you Lord you are our life Lord we want to be like you we want to live like you Lord teach us to Humble ourselves to put ourselves aside so that you can grow in our lives father forgive our sins forgive my unbelief Lord I Want to Believe that you have made me a Son of God and throughout all these difficulties Lord I will see your glory Lord what most beautiful words have I not told you if you believe you will see the glory of God lord We believe We Believe Lord we believe your word we believe your prophet we want to see your glory Lord Holy Spirit begin to move Holy Spirit begin to move more father bring peace to our heart father confirm your word in our hearts prepare Angels Mighty in
