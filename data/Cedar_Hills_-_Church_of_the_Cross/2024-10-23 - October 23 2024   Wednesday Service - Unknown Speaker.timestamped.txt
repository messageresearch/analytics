[32:30] wherefor seeing we also are compassed
[32:33] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[32:36] let us lay aside every weight and the
[32:38] sin which does so easily beset us and
[32:40] let us run with patience the race that
[32:43] is set before us
[33:01] looking unto Jesus the author and
[33:03] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[33:06] that was set before him endured the
[33:08] cross despising the shame and is sat
[33:11] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[33:26] God amen you may you all may be
[33:30] seated just going to be giving a a
[33:33] little report on our trip to
[33:39] Colombia we bring greetings from Brother
[33:42] Fabio and sister
[33:44] nudy from Brother Moses and sister
[33:48] chaoses CH from from all the youth that
[33:52] were that attended the
[33:55] camp they all send their greetings to
[33:57] each and every one of
[34:01] you the theme of the camp was looking
[34:04] unto
[34:08] Jesus and it was a great just a great
[34:11] blessing for
[34:13] me if you would put up the first picture
[34:16] of the youth
[34:20] group this there was around 45 youth
[34:24] that attended the camp
[34:28] and something that was really
[34:31] tremendous they had planned on uh doing
[34:34] a a bigger
[34:37] camp and things kind of fell
[34:41] through so they did it at the FAA of our
[34:44] brother
[34:47] Fabio and in
[34:49] that uh lot of the uh some of the youth
[34:52] decided that that they didn't want to go
[34:58] because it was a smaller
[35:01] Camp as you can see in the picture
[35:03] there's some
[35:06] tents they had to ttin it
[35:10] out but but the
[35:14] conditions for the ones that
[35:16] went it didn't matter what it
[35:20] was but they went to see
[35:23] Jesus they didn't complain about staying
[35:26] in tent
[35:29] they didn't complain about
[35:31] anything but they were there to see
[35:34] Jesus brother Moses was telling
[35:37] us about all the great testimonies that
[35:40] have come out of
[35:43] Thea about how many of the many of the
[35:46] brothers and sisters of
[35:50] Colombia had their first experience with
[35:53] the Lord
[35:55] there and for the youth that
[35:59] went that's what they
[36:01] wanted they wanted their experience with
[36:04] the
[36:05] Lord so that really impacted me because
[36:09] many
[36:10] times we want to we want to be a part of
[36:13] the big
[36:15] things I shouldn't say we but
[36:18] me we want to be a part of the big
[36:23] things but it's it's the small
[36:25] things there was maybe in total 60
[36:28] people at the
[36:31] camp but we were all blessed beyond
[36:36] measure if you would uh put up the
[36:40] second
[36:42] picture it's of me and two of the
[36:44] brothers
[36:47] there the brother there on the
[36:50] left his name was uh brother
[36:54] Santiago he was a really awesome song
[37:00] me and him got along really
[37:03] well brother on the
[37:05] right that was brother M the Primo to
[37:09] brother
[37:12] Sammy and uh he was a very awesome
[37:14] guitar
[37:15] [Music]
[37:17] player uh probably one of the one of the
[37:19] best I've I've ever heard in my life
[37:23] honestly and uh so we got along very
[37:26] well
[37:28] all of course through
[37:31] music but just being able to share the
[37:33] word with
[37:36] them just being able to be with all
[37:38] these brothers and all the sisters there
[37:40] was just a really great
[37:44] blessing one of the one of the biggest
[37:48] impacts was on Sunday
[37:51] morning my my dad
[37:54] preached he preached on worship
[37:58] and on
[38:00] obedience and just to see the impact it
[38:03] had on the
[38:06] youth to it had an impact on
[38:10] me but after after he was done
[38:14] preaching he asked whoever needed
[38:16] something to come
[38:21] forth and it wasn't it's it was it was
[38:26] something so tremendous
[38:29] because it didn't it didn't uh the
[38:31] spirit of the Lord
[38:33] fell and it really didn't cause much
[38:38] emotion but what it did cause was a
[38:41] complete
[38:43] peace it was just a beautiful piece that
[38:46] went through the whole through the whole
[38:51] building that everybody felt
[38:54] it and it was just a peace
[38:58] and all we could
[38:59] do was just lift our
[39:02] hands praise the Lord some cried but it
[39:07] was just a complete
[39:09] peace I believe lives were
[39:13] changed and that's what we that's what
[39:15] the Lord what I believe the Lord had
[39:17] sent us to
[39:20] do of course it's nothing that we can do
[39:22] as human
[39:24] beings but it's the god that lives in
[39:26] each and every one
[39:28] us and he's the one that does the work
[39:31] amen we just have to let him use
[39:35] us let us be the
[39:39] vessel and I believe that lives were
[39:42] changed I know I can't come back the
[39:46] same it was it was truly a great
[39:50] blessing and if you would put up the
[39:53] last picture brothers and brother Fabio
[39:59] it was just a a pleasure to be able to
[40:01] talk with
[40:05] him to be with him to spend some time
[40:09] with
[40:10] him and I hope that this little report
[40:13] blesses
[40:14] you may God richly bless you
[40:29] amen God bless you this
[40:32] evening good to see all of you once
[40:36] again if we can open up our our Bibles
[40:39] to First Corinthians chapter
[40:44] 12 and verse
[40:46] 12 and once you have it if you can say
[40:50] amen amen amen it reads for as a body is
[40:54] one and ha many members and all the
[40:57] members of that one body being many are
[41:00] one body so also is
[41:11] Christ amen may the Lord add the
[41:14] blessing to the reading of his
[41:17] word I first I'd like to thank our
[41:19] pastor brother Caleb for the opportunity
[41:21] to to go on this trip
[41:27] may the Lord bless him there wherever
[41:29] he's
[41:31] at before leaving brother brother Caleb
[41:34] he he told me something that that really
[41:36] stuck with
[41:41] me he said there's no place will you
[41:44] where you will learn as much as in the
[41:46] missionary
[41:47] [Music]
[41:51] field and and that stuck with me
[41:54] throughout this
[41:55] trip and let me tell you that that's
[41:57] nothing but the
[42:02] truth there there's a few things I like
[42:04] to think uh speak
[42:07] about just about three things that that
[42:11] really stood out to me during this
[42:14] trip and the first thing is uh the the
[42:19] ministry of of our brother
[42:23] Fabio if they can put up that that first
[42:25] picture of that of the article
[42:29] it's it's a little bit
[42:32] small but a cousin of mine sent this to
[42:34] me while we were over there in in in
[42:40] Colombia and it's a it's it's an article
[42:44] of voice of
[42:47] restoration and this is uh I showed this
[42:51] to brother Fabio while I was over
[42:54] there and he told me it was it was one
[42:57] of the first times they went to
[43:01] Peru and then on this side you see
[43:04] brother brother Tommy senior as
[43:08] well so I thought that was so tremendous
[43:10] and and very fitting that you know while
[43:13] we were in Colombia they they found this
[43:14] article they were cleaning uh the her
[43:18] father-in-law's garage
[43:27] and um I just thought it was so fitting
[43:29] to to be in the land of of a man of
[43:31] brother
[43:35] Fabio to see the the beginnings of of of
[43:39] the ministry of a man of that
[43:43] [Music]
[43:44] kind while we were over there he he
[43:46] spoke to the young
[43:49] people and he he spoke to of us of of
[43:52] the first time the Lord spoke to him
[43:58] and it was it was there at at the at
[44:01] Thea at the
[44:03] farm and he was about five or six years
[44:06] old and you guys can start showing the
[44:08] pictures of the of the
[44:12] fina if you can just go through them
[44:14] while while I'm
[44:16] speaking and and he he was five or six
[44:19] years old he he was walking there uh
[44:21] around the
[44:24] FAA and brother faia told us he was
[44:27] meditating on on the death of his
[44:32] grandma and and he hears a voice that
[44:34] tells him what are you thinking what are
[44:36] you
[44:39] doing and he said he was so terrified to
[44:42] hear a voice just so
[44:47] powerful and so he he from then on he
[44:50] would go around the whole instead of
[44:52] that place where he wasid
[44:59] and so to see the beginnings of what God
[45:02] was going to do through a
[45:06] man to be a servant to the South
[45:09] American
[45:12] people to me that was it was something
[45:14] so
[45:16] special and he told us of the great
[45:18] blessings that that brother Ethan also
[45:21] mentioned it the blessings that people
[45:23] received there uh at that same FAA
[45:30] right throughout the years uh there was
[45:32] many that had their first first
[45:33] encounter with the Lord
[45:38] there uh ministers that they had their
[45:41] first initiation
[45:46] there marriages that came out of
[45:50] there I remember him telling the
[45:54] youth he said if you don't find a
[45:56] girlfriend here you'll never find a
[46:01] girlfriend so it's now or
[46:04] never keep your eyes
[46:07] open so that that was it was something
[46:10] just so special to me just to see the
[46:13] the life of of brother Fabio to see the
[46:15] beginnings of of where he was raised in
[46:17] that in that city of
[46:22] sesa it's not a city it's more of a
[46:24] little a little town
[46:27] and the second thing was was the
[46:31] youth and they can start putting the
[46:33] pictures of of the young people
[46:37] there but let me tell you they are they
[46:39] are something to
[46:41] admire they dedication to this Camp it
[46:44] it was
[46:47] impressive they were planning their own
[46:52] activities and lots of effort that they
[46:55] put into the camp
[46:59] something that caught my eye that you
[47:00] know it may be a small detail but I I
[47:02] thought it was it was really
[47:06] cool that when they were finished eating
[47:09] they would go and they would wash their
[47:10] own
[47:14] plate it's the small things just the the
[47:17] the lessons that you learn and that you
[47:20] that they teach the young
[47:23] people and they all went with
[47:25] expectation
[47:28] right those that wanted to be there they
[47:30] they received the
[47:34] blessing and you could tell the
[47:37] expectation that they went
[47:44] with not because they would tell you
[47:46] about
[47:48] it but in their
[47:51] actions right they went to receive and I
[47:53] believe that each and every one of them
[47:55] received something from the Lord
[48:00] and if you can put that next picture
[48:01] with with brother brother
[48:09] moel brother moo he's a he's a very good
[48:12] friend of
[48:14] mine when he uh when he greeted me for
[48:17] the first time the first time I had ever
[48:18] met
[48:23] him he said I feel like I've met I've
[48:26] known you my whole life and I told
[48:29] them and I told them I feel the same and
[48:32] let me tell you it's
[48:34] true right just having met another part
[48:37] of of the Bride of Jesus
[48:41] Christ and to know that they're part of
[48:43] the same body the same body that you are
[48:45] a part
[48:48] of and all we were doing was just
[48:50] meeting each other for the first time in
[48:52] the
[48:54] flesh right so I think God for allowing
[48:57] me to to make new friends and not only
[48:59] new friends but people that you'll spend
[49:02] eternity
[49:06] with yeah it was so nice just uh to
[49:09] speak to to moo and he he told me a
[49:12] little bit of his life story
[49:16] and and it's it's something so beautiful
[49:18] just to speak to people and to to see
[49:21] another side uh another part of the
[49:24] world that they're going through things
[49:26] that you may may be going
[49:32] through and the third thing the last
[49:34] thing that I that really caught my
[49:36] attention while while we were over
[49:40] there is that as as brother Caleb so put
[49:44] it so
[49:46] well he said you know we're we're not a
[49:49] team but we're one
[49:52] body and if you could put that last
[49:54] picture there with brother fa is the
[49:55] same picture that brother
[49:59] used but while we were while we were
[50:01] over there I I just saw how God was
[50:04] using the body in in in distinct
[50:11] ways whenever one was
[50:14] [Music]
[50:16] needed then they would step
[50:18] in and a lot of the times it wasn't the
[50:20] way that I
[50:23] expected but it was just how God wanted
[50:25] to use each one of us in at that
[50:30] time and it was just so wonderful to see
[50:32] God operate through through each gift
[50:34] and each one of the men that
[50:39] went and not only that but to see this
[50:43] part of the body
[50:48] here and go and Unite with the part of
[50:50] the body that's over there in
[50:54] Colombia working alongside with with
[50:57] brother Moses over
[50:59] there and and the youth leader there
[51:02] brother Diego I
[51:05] believe the the deacons that were
[51:09] present it was it was simply God working
[51:13] through his body here on
[51:17] Earth so it was it was something so
[51:19] tremendous to to see that and I just
[51:22] learned so much on this trip
[51:25] [Music]
[51:27] it was it was an experience of a
[51:28] lifetime I could
[51:31] say and in closing I I just like to
[51:33] thank all the people of
[51:37] Colombia that they were all so kind to
[51:39] us most especially brother Fabio and
[51:41] sister
[51:45] nudy brother Moses sister
[51:48] Chelsea they were so mindful of us the
[51:50] whole time I think I gained maybe 10
[51:52] pounds while I was over there
[51:59] and I think I lost it because I got sick
[52:00] on the way
[52:04] back but nevertheless we thank God for
[52:07] allowing us to make it back
[52:11] Sav it's all worth it whether you know
[52:14] rain or it's uh sun or rain if you're
[52:17] sick or in health
[52:23] no whatever it is I think it's our
[52:25] purpose to serve the Lord
[52:30] we are one body and and we were made to
[52:34] serve so I hope this was of a blessing
[52:37] to you God bless you
[52:39] [Applause]
[52:58] amen may God richly bless
[53:00] you it's surely a privilege to be back
[53:03] here
[53:06] tonight I missed you
[53:09] all very
[53:11] much uh let us open up the
[53:16] scripture uh you all heard uh the
[53:18] scripture and the theme looking un
[53:23] Jesus but there was something that um my
[53:26] uncle will hit a little touched
[53:32] on and it's found in
[53:35] Acts chapter 2 verse
[53:39] 38 the Bible
[53:42] says then Peter said unto
[53:45] them repent and be baptized every one of
[53:48] you in the name of Jesus
[53:50] Christ for the remissions of sins and he
[53:53] shall give you the gift of the Holy
[53:54] Ghost
[54:03] for the promise is unto
[54:07] you and to your
[54:10] children and to all that are far
[54:13] off even as many as the Lord Our God
[54:16] shall
[54:19] call I started thinking about uh when I
[54:23] going on this trip
[54:27] you know it's kind of funny uh last time
[54:28] I spoke on a
[54:31] report and I did say you know whenever
[54:33] the Lord needs me I I'll be there you
[54:37] know and sure enough brother Caleb was I
[54:40] think he paid attention to
[54:43] that and he was like hey did I ever talk
[54:45] to you about going to
[54:48] colia he's like well he's how many days
[54:50] you got left you
[54:51] know you know and I'm like oh okay I
[54:54] think I have one day and uh
[54:57] you know let's let's do it let's do it
[54:58] you know you know let's work it out you
[55:01] know and in my heart I I just want to be
[55:06] obedient something that uh brother will
[55:09] touched on so
[55:13] heavily in the worship that you give to
[55:15] the Lord you
[55:17] know no excuses on my
[55:20] part the time I want to give to the
[55:23] Lord and uh I started thinking about
[55:27] this for the promis is unto
[55:31] you I as I talking to my boss
[55:37] and trying to explain to them why we're
[55:40] going to
[55:42] Colombia I start realizing
[55:45] like how long
[55:48] ago the friendship was was
[55:52] made and you can take it even further
[55:54] back than that
[55:58] that before the foundation of the
[56:01] world there was a special
[56:04] connection between our brother
[56:07] faio and our and our founding
[56:10] pastor and it starts making me think you
[56:14] know what drives these men to do what
[56:17] they
[56:19] do what moves
[56:21] them and the word I come down to
[56:24] is is is love am it was so beautiful to
[56:32] see and experience such great
[56:36] love I I surely did feel my grandfather
[56:39] down
[56:41] there and as we talked to brother
[56:45] fabiio we laughed a lot and he shared so
[56:49] many
[56:51] things and just reminds me of my grandpa
[56:56] and the love doesn't stop it continues
[56:58] you
[57:00] know um the love that he and sister nudy
[57:03] has shown
[57:06] us man they you know they want you to
[57:11] eat to all the
[57:13] Colombians you have very wonderful
[57:16] food especially the
[57:19] avocados maybe brother or sister Erica I
[57:23] uh I gave you the pictures in the wrong
[57:25] order but maybe you can the
[57:29] avocado wonderful right it's just out of
[57:33] this
[57:34] world and then they took us and fed us
[57:38] more and it's the love they show for you
[57:42] right and for me I'm like no let me like
[57:44] I I want to pay for that or let me do
[57:47] this you
[57:48] know and the great friend that I have in
[57:51] brother and brother
[57:54] Moses they're like no no no no you're
[57:57] our
[57:58] guest let me help you do something no
[58:00] just you've done
[58:04] enough and I and I remember what our
[58:06] pastor has told
[58:08] me
[58:10] say all you have to do all you have to
[58:13] worry
[58:14] about is have a good
[58:17] time because many times I'm worried
[58:20] about things not getting
[58:23] planned so I did have a very one
[58:26] wonderful
[58:27] time let's go to the first picture I
[58:30] wanted to show you the men
[58:33] there and that was one of the those are
[58:36] our special Brothers there I shared
[58:39] enjoyed very all of
[58:42] them my broken English they looked far
[58:45] past
[58:48] that oh I'm sorry there thank you
[58:50] brother Jim my my span yeah my Spanish
[58:53] too you know both both of them
[58:56] and uh so this was uh looking unto Jesus
[58:59] Mir looking onto Jesus and you see a
[59:02] young man
[59:03] there a young
[59:05] lady and they're there at the
[59:08] cross and I thought that was very
[59:12] fitting you know hopefully I didn't hurt
[59:15] the men there too
[59:17] much that I didn't kind of confuse the
[59:19] men too
[59:21] much because the first thing I talked
[59:24] about was that we need to look to
[59:28] Jesus and not look to Mary yet you
[59:30] know but many had a limited time you
[59:33] know so they had to do you
[59:39] know but you can tell that how much they
[59:42] love the
[59:44] Lord and how much they love to be around
[59:46] each
[59:48] other something that you don't have to
[59:50] force you
[59:51] know put them there in the camp
[59:54] and and naturally
[59:57] happens and I I I told them that I
[1:00:02] believe my purpose in
[1:00:04] life for the young people of
[1:00:07] God not so much just the young people
[1:00:10] that are
[1:00:12] here anyone that I can come encounter
[1:00:17] with if you go to the next few
[1:00:21] pictures um I did admire
[1:00:24] this it's a box of cell
[1:00:27] phones and uh well they uh they took all
[1:00:31] the cell phones from the
[1:00:34] youth they put them in this box so they
[1:00:37] had no choice but to
[1:00:41] fellowship if you go to the next
[1:00:45] photos here's where they were uh they
[1:00:47] were passing around um little
[1:00:51] object and wherever it would stop
[1:00:56] go and introduce
[1:00:59] themselves and so just little things
[1:01:01] like that like I I just love to be a
[1:01:03] part about part of
[1:01:06] it maybe kind of hard to see but the the
[1:01:09] person on my
[1:01:12] right it's like man that looks like
[1:01:15] Mark you know anyways I guess I just
[1:01:18] miss Mark a
[1:01:19] lot we kind of saw a little bit of
[1:01:21] everybody over there you know it's kind
[1:01:24] of thought we were in Columbia I guess
[1:01:26] we brought Les crues
[1:01:28] here but of course I come back and like
[1:01:31] I thought I left Colombia but I see a
[1:01:33] lot of Colombians
[1:01:37] here if you go to the next few
[1:01:41] pictures that was one of my I guess our
[1:01:45] team so uh I guess apparently uh some of
[1:01:49] the young people over there maybe not
[1:01:52] married they're around my age
[1:01:56] so when I was introducing myself to the
[1:02:00] team her sister Chelsea was interpreting
[1:02:04] me which is kind of funny
[1:02:07] right anyway so I was like well I'm
[1:02:09] telling I'm I'm 33 and they're
[1:02:12] like you're a youth right and I'm
[1:02:15] like I got kids you
[1:02:17] know wife you know and they're like
[1:02:20] oh but I I pray that it was a that I
[1:02:23] could have been a blessing to them
[1:02:27] just being in their
[1:02:28] midst uh they were such a blessing to
[1:02:32] me again just great love that I
[1:02:36] felt the the things that they were
[1:02:39] looking
[1:02:40] for I believe they received
[1:02:43] them and we wanted to give them every
[1:02:46] opportunity that they could have their
[1:02:47] own experience with the
[1:02:51] Lord and in turn I had my own experience
[1:02:54] with the Lord
[1:02:56] it was very wonderful wonderful that
[1:02:59] service on
[1:03:01] Sunday it just felt felt such a peace
[1:03:04] with the
[1:03:06] Lord you can go to the next few photos
[1:03:09] sure we're all done but there's there's
[1:03:11] just it Colombia is
[1:03:14] beautiful what a beautiful
[1:03:16] place thing that makes Colombia
[1:03:20] beautiful is the people that live there
[1:03:23] it's the children of God
[1:03:26] that God created the Earth
[1:03:29] for see brother Ethan and brother
[1:03:32] Noah and I just very proud of proud of
[1:03:36] the young people I went
[1:03:39] with you too Uncle
[1:03:42] will it's just a pleasure when you go
[1:03:44] with these
[1:03:47] men and even though I'm related to
[1:03:50] them I see brother Noah all the
[1:03:53] time you get to really have some good
[1:03:56] talks with
[1:03:58] them and I learned so much about brother
[1:04:02] Noah I think he's probably interpret for
[1:04:05] most of the
[1:04:06] message most of the people in the
[1:04:09] message but I'll leave you with this all
[1:04:12] right um because I think brother Noah
[1:04:14] kind of found this a little
[1:04:16] funny and a little
[1:04:19] shocked I actually knew some Spanish
[1:04:22] right
[1:04:25] he was kind of giggling a lot
[1:04:29] so but I just want to
[1:04:34] say give peace from the
[1:04:37] Lord oh give a give
[1:04:41] [Applause]
[1:04:43] an give a hand to the
[1:04:47] Lord God bless you
[1:05:08] God bless you
[1:05:10] all What a Wonder wonderful
[1:05:14] reports that uh God is still
[1:05:18] working no matter where you're at in the
[1:05:21] world there's no place that God cannot
[1:05:24] reach
[1:05:26] uh and his uh his uh his love is uh is
[1:05:30] so
[1:05:31] tremendous and thank brother Caleb for
[1:05:34] uh for the opportunity to
[1:05:38] go and uh just be a part of uh this
[1:05:44] camp that was uh that was in the
[1:05:48] beginning was supposed to be this really
[1:05:52] big a lot of people there and
[1:05:58] different things
[1:06:01] transpired but it was exactly how God
[1:06:05] wanted it to
[1:06:07] be you know we we don't look for for
[1:06:12] numbers you know it was uh to be in a in
[1:06:16] in a camp where there was I think there
[1:06:18] was like 46
[1:06:21] youth but every one of those youth that
[1:06:24] were there
[1:06:26] they wanted to be
[1:06:29] there they strived to be
[1:06:33] there and for that it was uh it was it
[1:06:36] was
[1:06:38] wonderful I I was really really
[1:06:42] proud of brother Seth brother Noah
[1:06:48] eth you know as I get older it's it it's
[1:06:51] it's really
[1:06:54] weird it's really weird being the old
[1:07:00] guy it's weird because all through since
[1:07:05] I've been on the missionary
[1:07:08] field I've been uh one of the youngest
[1:07:11] if not the youngest everywhere we
[1:07:16] go so it's it it's it's it's it was a
[1:07:21] strange feeling for
[1:07:23] me but it was uh it it it's wonderful to
[1:07:27] be around such wonderful uh young
[1:07:31] men um it bring it makes you feel a
[1:07:36] little bit
[1:07:38] young you know but um we were uh we were
[1:07:43] speaking with brother
[1:07:45] Fabio as he was as you had heard he he
[1:07:48] was just sharing stories after
[1:07:52] stories of him and my dad
[1:07:56] um when they
[1:07:58] met and it was so important because I've
[1:08:01] I've known those
[1:08:05] stories my whole life to hear but to but
[1:08:08] to but for those stories for for my son
[1:08:12] for Ethan for Seth and uh and uh and
[1:08:16] Noah to to hear those stories as
[1:08:23] well it's it's V and it's important to
[1:08:27] to understand where we come
[1:08:31] from you know we see uh everyone wants
[1:08:34] to uh you know the young people it seems
[1:08:38] like sometimes they don't they they just
[1:08:40] want to uh they just want to focus on
[1:08:42] what's going on
[1:08:46] now but it's important to realize where
[1:08:50] we have come
[1:08:52] from I was speaking to the young people
[1:08:55] on Friday night I was just uh we were
[1:08:57] just talking by the uh talking
[1:09:03] there and as I was I was I was
[1:09:06] explaining to
[1:09:07] them I said we don't have to we don't
[1:09:11] have to uh reinvent the
[1:09:15] wheel so many so many times we we want
[1:09:18] to get new new doctrines or new new
[1:09:22] things and
[1:09:27] and I told him it's like U it's like a
[1:09:29] man going through a
[1:09:33] jungle and he has a he has a machete in
[1:09:36] his
[1:09:37] hand and he's he's there clearing the
[1:09:40] the
[1:09:41] branches he he's just clearing all the
[1:09:45] grass whatever whatever is in front of
[1:09:48] him he's
[1:09:51] clearing and I said that's what brother
[1:09:53] fabiio has done
[1:09:56] since he started he is he he has cleared
[1:09:58] the
[1:10:01] path our founding p uh Pastor has
[1:10:04] cleared the
[1:10:07] path that's not our
[1:10:10] job our job is not to have the machete
[1:10:12] in her hand and trying to to to make
[1:10:14] another
[1:10:17] path that is not what we have to
[1:10:20] do all that we have to
[1:10:23] do is take what the these
[1:10:26] men have
[1:10:29] sacrificed had had such a burden
[1:10:32] for for so many
[1:10:35] years and take it and
[1:10:37] run run with this
[1:10:40] message go down the path that they've
[1:10:44] created and that's all that we have to
[1:10:48] do we don't have to create another
[1:10:52] path we'd be outside of the will of God
[1:10:57] but it takes me to it takes me to
[1:11:00] this the Lord has been he he he uh he's
[1:11:04] been dealing with me uh on on this
[1:11:09] here you know we have brother Moses what
[1:11:11] are what what do the young people what
[1:11:13] do they what do they uh what do they
[1:11:16] need or what are what are they
[1:11:17] struggling
[1:11:22] with he said they're struggling to to
[1:11:24] find their
[1:11:28] purpose they're struggling to answer
[1:11:30] their
[1:11:33] why why am I here why am I a part of
[1:11:37] this why why
[1:11:39] why but if we took uh if we uh go in the
[1:11:44] Bible in the book of Isaiah
[1:11:51] 43:7 it simply
[1:11:53] reads like this
[1:11:59] even everyone that is called by my name
[1:12:03] for I have created him for my
[1:12:06] glory I have formed him yay I have made
[1:12:16] him Ephesians 1 5 and 6
[1:12:27] having predestinated us unto the
[1:12:29] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:12:32] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:12:34] of his
[1:12:41] will to the praise of the of the glory
[1:12:44] of his grace wherein he ha made us
[1:12:46] accepted and the
[1:12:50] Beloved you know young people are are
[1:12:53] searching for for their
[1:12:57] why for their purpose in this
[1:13:01] life and it and it brings me to
[1:13:04] this I've never
[1:13:08] been good at
[1:13:11] math
[1:13:13] whatsoever I'm not like brother sayth
[1:13:15] brother sayth you you give him something
[1:13:16] and
[1:13:19] Bumm I I am definitely not even remotely
[1:13:24] in the h hemisphere where he's
[1:13:27] at Galaxy where he's
[1:13:32] at but but I want you to to to uh to
[1:13:38] focus on this just for a few
[1:13:41] minutes in order us for in order in
[1:13:45] order for us to be
[1:13:47] born we needed a few things
[1:13:50] right we needed two
[1:13:53] parents okay see everyone everyone in
[1:13:58] agreement we needed four
[1:14:02] grandparents we needed eight great
[1:14:07] grandparents we needed 16 second great
[1:14:11] grandparents we needed 64 fourth great
[1:14:16] grandparents we needed 128 fifth great
[1:14:22] grandparents we did 256 sixth great
[1:14:29] grandparents we needed 512 seventh great
[1:14:36] grandparents we needed 1,24 eth great
[1:14:41] [Music]
[1:14:43] grandparents we needed 248 nth great
[1:14:51] grandparents if you go back 12
[1:14:53] Generations
[1:14:56] in order for
[1:14:58] you to be here
[1:15:01] today it took 4,094 of your ancestors
[1:15:06] for you to be here sitting in the
[1:15:14] today think about
[1:15:17] it think about the battles they went
[1:15:21] through think about the struggles
[1:15:25] that they all went
[1:15:27] through for you to have the
[1:15:31] opportunity in
[1:15:35] 2024 to be able to hear what God is
[1:15:39] doing in your in your
[1:15:41] time to be able to accept a message that
[1:15:46] is true that is right that is
[1:15:50] correct in this day 494
[1:16:00] people and we wonder
[1:16:02] why what's our
[1:16:07] purpose why why am I
[1:16:11] here this does away with all your
[1:16:16] wise because God has a
[1:16:19] purpose he has a
[1:16:21] plan his plan is perfect
[1:16:30] imagine what they all went
[1:16:35] through I I hear stories of just my
[1:16:41] grandfather how they found him on the
[1:16:43] border my my my my grandpa
[1:16:47] Pedro they found him in the Border
[1:16:49] almost almost
[1:16:52] dead how he got Shipwrecked
[1:16:55] on off the coast of
[1:17:00] Norway that's just one of the
[1:17:04] stories for me to be here
[1:17:10] today we can't take things like that for
[1:17:14] granted we can't let a moment pass by
[1:17:16] and say well that that's that that's
[1:17:19] just
[1:17:22] life and and we don't care about care
[1:17:26] about things
[1:17:28] anymore but it's it's so
[1:17:32] important if we can look
[1:17:34] back a lot of people say well we don't
[1:17:37] you know I don't look at the
[1:17:40] past no I think we do need to look at
[1:17:42] the
[1:17:43] past because if we don't realize the
[1:17:46] mistakes that we've done in the
[1:17:49] past we are going to we are going to
[1:17:52] repeat them in the future
[1:17:55] if we don't look at the
[1:17:57] past and see where we've come
[1:17:59] from we never know where we're
[1:18:02] going we'll never know we'll never know
[1:18:06] what what what the previous generations
[1:18:08] did for
[1:18:11] us you know when we were out in
[1:18:14] colia you know there's
[1:18:19] there's there's something special for
[1:18:23] me whenever I go out in the missionary
[1:18:26] field I feel my dad like I like
[1:18:31] like it it's so
[1:18:36] strong I feel him just just saying go
[1:18:39] just keep on
[1:18:42] going keep on going that's what I told
[1:18:45] the young people on Sunday
[1:18:47] morning I said what the message that
[1:18:52] brother Favio
[1:18:55] everything that he's done for the for
[1:18:57] the country of
[1:18:59] colia everything that he's done for
[1:19:01] South
[1:19:02] America all he's done around the
[1:19:05] world it cannot stop with
[1:19:09] him it doesn't stop with
[1:19:12] him now you have now you have the Next
[1:19:17] Generation cannot stop with
[1:19:20] them and now it's the
[1:19:23] youth what are we going to do
[1:19:26] do are we just going to look at
[1:19:29] at or or or hear the
[1:19:33] stories of brother fabiio of brother
[1:19:37] Tommy said those were nice oh those are
[1:19:41] oh great
[1:19:43] stories and that's all as Generations go
[1:19:47] on that's all that they've
[1:19:50] become is just
[1:19:52] oh that was that was nice
[1:19:57] that was great it's all just become
[1:20:01] stories it's all become maybe mythical
[1:20:06] now oh there
[1:20:08] there's you can't do that
[1:20:11] anymore that can't be done oh those were
[1:20:15] in in those
[1:20:17] times we live in different
[1:20:21] times there's there there's the saying
[1:20:25] wow that's just the way that the times
[1:20:26] are
[1:20:28] now no it's not just the way the times
[1:20:31] are
[1:20:33] now you know times times don't
[1:20:38] change right the times don't
[1:20:41] change people
[1:20:44] change times don't
[1:20:46] change people
[1:20:50] change and what this with this trip
[1:20:54] has has made me realize even
[1:20:58] more is that the
[1:21:01] need to
[1:21:03] continue is even
[1:21:08] greater I look at my my
[1:21:11] sons I should say I look at
[1:21:15] myself and I said
[1:21:17] Lord can't stop with
[1:21:21] me can't stop with me
[1:21:24] I look at my I look at my
[1:21:27] sons I said I said
[1:21:30] guys can't stop with
[1:21:34] you
[1:21:37] can't the work that the work that
[1:21:39] brother faio my dad
[1:21:44] did it
[1:21:46] work that'll never be in
[1:21:51] vain it'll never be in vain
[1:21:55] why because there's a
[1:21:57] body there's a body here there's a body
[1:22:01] there in
[1:22:02] colia that is striving each and every
[1:22:05] day as hard as life
[1:22:09] gets as much as as as Satan wants to
[1:22:13] take
[1:22:15] down each
[1:22:17] person oh but there's a
[1:22:19] body you
[1:22:21] know you know when I was there
[1:22:26] there brother fabiio
[1:22:29] says he's thank you for giving us
[1:22:34] strength thank you for giving our young
[1:22:36] people
[1:22:39] strength I told Brother fa I said thank
[1:22:41] you for giving me
[1:22:44] strength because when I see a
[1:22:47] man that's that's that's that's 80 years
[1:22:52] old still going in front of his
[1:22:56] youth is just talking about how how
[1:22:59] great God
[1:23:01] is I said man I I've I've still got a
[1:23:04] lot to
[1:23:06] learn I've still got a lot to
[1:23:08] do by the grace of God we still have a
[1:23:11] lot to
[1:23:13] do we don't have a lot of
[1:23:16] time we don't have years and years and
[1:23:19] years to
[1:23:21] go what what what uh what has been
[1:23:26] preached are things that we need to get
[1:23:30] fast things that we need to understand
[1:23:35] quickly we don't have all the time in
[1:23:38] the
[1:23:40] world you know brother brother fa's he's
[1:23:43] one of the funniest people I've ever
[1:23:45] been
[1:23:48] around you know I I I always remember
[1:23:52] him and my dad you want to hear two guys
[1:23:55] just just crack up with each other it
[1:23:59] was
[1:24:04] them to me brother Fabi he's like the
[1:24:06] king of the onliners he's he has on
[1:24:08] liners
[1:24:12] everything you know he told us said you
[1:24:15] know the climate
[1:24:17] here Ina and says it's like
[1:24:22] Le what
[1:24:27] it's neither hot nor
[1:24:32] cold so man he just I mean it's one
[1:24:36] after another with with brother Fabio
[1:24:39] but you know it's things that we that we
[1:24:43] appreciate so
[1:24:44] much is the love of the Colombian
[1:24:49] people you know that the youth asked
[1:24:52] me what's it like in
[1:24:55] crues said well it's colia
[1:25:01] north and and the reason why it's that
[1:25:06] way
[1:25:08] because over 40 years
[1:25:11] ago there was two
[1:25:14] men that took God out his
[1:25:17] word and didn't care about what any what
[1:25:19] anyone else said about
[1:25:23] them they just just loved
[1:25:26] God they loved each
[1:25:28] other and that's why we can go down
[1:25:32] there total
[1:25:35] confidence knowing that that that's our
[1:25:39] that's our
[1:25:41] family that's that's whom we
[1:25:44] love because we because of two
[1:25:47] men that that really that paved the way
[1:25:50] for
[1:25:52] us amen so
