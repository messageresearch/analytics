we're we're bringing you the good news tonight we're gonna tell you how great God is good is now are you ready tonight because God is doing wonders around this world and all we're doing is fulfilling the commission that he's called us for do you believe it Church let's turn to the scriptures and this I chose this scripture because this has this whole trip wrapped in this scripture this how great he is Ephesians 3:20 wait for guys up top up now unto him that might be able now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask according to the power that worketh in US you may be seated so we read half of the scripture you guys missed a piece okay because when we come to God we don't we we expect sometimes just a little bit but he has the greatest to offer us he has AB exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask for you know so we go to this trip you know and and with with the calling that God has given our pastor you know he one thing we've learned that he won't move unless God is calling him to move because it's a continuation of our founding Pastor so we go to Poland you know this is our second trip to Poland you know these people they really got my attention you know these our people you've seen similar to like brother Morton Real reserved so we go on the first trip we preach the gospel and they begin to open up a little bit at a time and as we were leaving the first trip you know they began to explain to us on how the gospel had come to Poland and how that they wanted us to come back but at this point they were still reserved you know they still had that straight face with with it's it they don't have a whole lot of emotion in their face and so we go on the second trip you know and there's nothing that we could have done ourselves but just remember the power of God is beginning to work here so we start the convention and it's and it's like a camp meeting and the brothers began to start preaching but halfway through these brothers were expecting the power of God so much that they said you know what Friday night and Saturday night we're g to have an Evangelistic service and we're going to invite everybody in the town to come and see so we we we are here Friday night you know still the thing hadn't really broken out openly but as the power of God began to come down I want you to remember it the easiest way to to explain it's a a people that they don't jump and Shout I there are people that is so sincere that when they sing when they pray you can feel the presence of God but there're still are reserved [Music] people but come Friday night the presence of God began to open up and brothers were running to the front their expressions began to open up they began to cry you know and all this happened let me explain this here's brother Danny Friday night he is preaching the gospel but then he opens up an atomic bomb and he says Satan he says you when you talk about the devil he says all he has is a title he said that's all he had but then he began to speak on how when he stripped of that and then the thing began to open up and the people's Expressions began to change so we had pastors running to the front to get prayed for you know it was something powerful that happened you know and then they began to say some of the things that they said they said where have you guys been we've never heard of you guys are we raising ourselves up no we're raising almighty God because we I always wonder you know when when is this uniting time going to really take place but when you begin to see it unfold Church we're in the midst of it you talk about a Revival unleashing that's what's happening in po you know this thing that happened in Africa you don't realize 97,000 we're not talking about people that were in the message their whole lives we're talking about people that are coming to the message from denomination you know and now this is beginning to roll over the country the very same God El that we have here it's beginning to explode the gospel is being made alive why because someone showed us how to call God on the scene someone showed us that when we rely on him the word is going to do what it promises it's going to that's the only gospel that we know it's not a story but it's a gospel that's been made alive because Church show me has anyone else done this has anyone else died on the cross died on the cross has anyone else resurrected has anyone else made the word produced show me where it's happening and our founding Pastor he preached that many times show me where the gospel is being preached and be made alive so there's only one that does it there's only one that died on the there's only one that resurrected there's only one that makes his word come to pass it's not me it's not the team but it's God in this last dayself known but Church what what condition should that make us in that's why this scripture now let's read it right and unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask according to the power that worketh in us that work in us but you still missed it brother J let's read it again this is what God is doing in this day are you ready two more minutes I just need your undivided attention for two more minutes we came not for another Wednesday service but because I came tonight because I knew God had a purpose in this now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all we ask according to the power that worketh in us this it again did anyone catch it hear you see that now we got it it's not just what we ask he said I'm going to do much further than that he say I'm going to do abundantly exceedingly abundantly above all you ask and think all you got to do is think about it that's the god that we know because the desires of your heart that's why he produces not just what we ask for but if you think it he will answer not just what you ask but exceedingly abundantly above all that and that's what happened our we went to take the gospel but it was made alive because this ministry does more there was this young man and and he kind of stuck to us like glue he said I see so many missionaries come through he says but you guys are different so I says how are we different he says you actually want to spend time with [Applause] me may the Lord richly bless you this evening I'd like to turn over to 1 Corinthians 1 1013 you would 13 GNA Go in English because I'm trying to losen up a little bit of my English says I I urge you I I urge you my brothers and sisters for the sake of the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to agree to live in unity with one another amen I just want to say that it's a privilege to be part of this team was really a privilege to be able to go on this trip um to be part of the what the Lord is doing through to this through through this ministry and the most important thing to see that I see is how God is uniting in the bride how is it that God is uniting all all all the pastors and bringing them together to come and look into One Direction as he talk about in uh in Poland we we're always looking for the last one to come right but there is something that I that c my attention and and I'd like to read it to you brother B bam I believe this that in the great Realms of the church the only thing that is holding off the only thing that is holding off the coming of the of our Lord Jesus for his church and setting up of uh his kingdom is the difference between the Full Gospel people that's right as long one as long as one say I belong to this I belong to that I receive this I did that and don't recognize the brother as your brother I think that's one of the hindrances that we have now one of the hindrances of not receiving or Jesus or Jesus Christ coming that makes me think uh am I holding in any way he's coming you can put your name there I say is is julan holding up his coming BR the Mage as the eagle Spirit up her nest my Ministry is a Ministry trying to unite the body of Christ together no unite denominations to a to another denomination unite brothers and sisters as one group of people one in purpose one in heart one in unity to see the coming of the Lord Jesus to me that's very clear aren we doing this are we part of this ministry I think that's what we're living today that what brother BR speaking about here my Ministry is trying to unite the body of Christ and that's what I'm seeing on these missionary I believe the Lord has already started the work uniting the bride and God is using this ministry to break down difference between Breen wonderful to see the pastors coming together and starting to have Fellowship one one another you see not only in Poland but Africa and everywhere that we've gone Pastor that didn't talk to each other maybe for a long time coming together on agreement and I believe that God that God is is preparing his bride now brother and uh let's turn real quick to Matthew 2236 say master which is the great commandment of the law in the law Jesus say unto him th shall love the Lord that heart thy God with all thy heart with th with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first of the great of this is the first and great commandment and the second is like to like un to it thou shallal love thy neighbor as thyself brother the Church of God and all of them very fine men all the groups I just stood I just stood between them and say we're brothers don't argue one another now if Satan if Satan can't keep us can't keep us fighting at one another he don't have to fight but we train our guns unto him and away from one another go to loving one another fellowship fellowshipping one another then the Millennium will start the Lord I think we as a church we should set a sample everyone has to got everyone has to has got something to do now everyone uh of you get right in your church and work as hard as you can for your local church but don't ever criticize if you know something bad about the other side don't say and don't don't say don't say nothing about it see keep it keep that to yourself the enemy just leaves just listening to hear that see don't let don't let him know nothing don't speak nothing out then he won't know nothing about it see keep it to yourself and pray think my time is gone [Applause] Blan well there's other veterans don't don't misunderstood I don't want to talk about my age because I feel young but this trip meant a lot to me I I uh hadn't really planned on going I I thought the team that was going was going to just somebody else so two days before the trip I'm in there in the office with brother Caleb and he goes audible you know what audible means in the game of football we're going to change the play he says audible do you want to go to to Poland I go you know the answer to that question go well sure God got to be ready at any time to go do our part and I would like to read a scripture in Hebrews 11 and I have a little thought and I'm trying to keep my time here I've already used one minute I just but this thought is they without us Hebrews 11: 38 to 40 amen of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the Earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise and I want you to really catch this next verse we've used it so many times and and we're always going to say well this is the the goal of this is to talk about the Saints of the Old Testament it just talked about how they were in the mountains and dens and how they were persecuted and so forth and they even obtained a a a good report through faith or revelation God having provided some better thing for for us would you all read that with me real slow God having provided something better for us so who is it for us okay I want to leave that right there just for a second you know the thing that really caught my attention in these meetings was an elderly brother and he uh he got up there and testified him and his wife sng and can you go ahead and give me that first clip please and as they he does that there it is there's the brother and his wife singing did you have that little audio clip Josh see if it's we can hear it it is concerning the Bible and the second song is about prayer the Bible has hundreds of years it gave me power and I believe it gave me power also to you yes so he's talking about how he's had this Bible and and he believes this Bible has survived hundreds of years and this brother his ministry was to take Bibles notice we we read about the Old Testament Saints they had all the books of the Old Testament as they were written by the prophets and the word became a written word and this brother his whole thing was to take Bibles boxes of Bibles and cross him to the border of Russia to me that is tremendous he res his own life that Bible is talking about he he he was taking it literally taking the Bible hundreds of Bibles and one time he gets there to the entrance to go into Russia and the soldier there that that's guarding the gate the entrance into Russia ask him well what do you have there he goes I have Russian Bibles the Russian soldiers said well you know you know I don't have to let you in with this right yeah they don't they're a Godless Nation overall right oh oh God God's there now but overall they are a Godless nation and the soldier says well give me a Bible so he goes to look at the Bibles he opens up the boxes and the Bibles were in the lane a Bulgarian am I saying that Bulgarian language these are Bulgarian Bibles but the Lord moved on his heart and at the end of of it all this Soldier says you know I know some little towns where there's a lot of Bulgarian people take these Bible to those little towns gives them Bibles in their own language that's how much this man wanted to get out the written word can you show me that second picture there and then this last picture and and the picture is courtesy courtesy of my buddy Tommy after he had given his testimony the previous service when I went around the back I saw him and I and I went like this to him and he started crying so when this happened is the the pastors up there giving the dismissal the meetings are basically over and he mentions now our brother was so impressed and so happy and glad because the brother Jimmy showing him this respect so he gets up out of his chair comes all the way around where I'm on the end and he gives me this big hug I see a man with a written word that now has the spirit in his heart he's talking about a Bible that survived hundreds of years and gone to many places but I represent not a written word anymore oh yeah it's written all right but not on paper it's not in a computer a taet it's a living word amen amen so let's go back to that scripture again amen my time is going I'm yeah no I've only been going nine minutes so far but brother Mark so let's go back to that scripture verse 4 God having provided a better thing for us amen what is this better thing that God provided for us amen the message of what of the Resurrection the message of a better sacrifice because speaking of the Old Testament Saints was previously in Hebrews 11 that's who it's talking about they had the the sacrifices of bulls and goats and Bulls but the blood of an animal the life that would come out of that animal when the blood left it could not come back upon the believer it covered their sin but it couldn't divorce their sin it couldn't kill the desire of sin so God provided us a perfect Sacrifice from a perfect blood that God himself became human and the spirit of God that was in Jesus when that blood cell broke it released the Holy Spirit and that Spirit now can come back upon us that is the something better that's been provided for us now let's read the rest of the verse because I never used to understand this verse but I saw that older brother he he's done his job he taken the written word he takes it to a place and then from there God gets it to where it's supposed to go what about us with this message have we taken this message to where it needs to go and then from there God will get it to the people that he has predestinated amen amen God having provided something better for us that they without us should not be made perfect doesn't that make you feel responsible they're waiting on us let's flip the coin now what are they to us if we don't have them huh do you ever think think about it like that what are we to them we're their completeness we're their perfection we're the ones that can bring them forth that through this better way better sacrifice this living message no longer just written on paper but living in the hearts of the believer can also change them you know going to finish with this one quote my time is oh gosh I only have two minutes amen amen out of the token full obedience to the full word of God entitles me did I read it right entitles us to the Token full obedience to the full word how can you have the full word without the full body are you a word you used to be a thought God spoke he created you you're a thought expressed by God so how are you going to have the fullness of the word without the fullness of the body praise the Lord Jesus just about done here that's how important in the fellowship is how is it that under the fellowship through Redemption by the blood the spirit of God can flow through the body and sanctify us through Fellowship is he going to do it outside of your brother is he going to do it outside of your sister so I look at those brothers and that that Old Timer he just he he got he got my he got to my heart and and I said they they or him that's what he represented they without us cannot be made perfect but us without them we're not complete and we're not going home yet I better stop right there God bless you man God bless you it's all right you guys can relax stand up go ahead stand up go ahead stand up all turn around tell each other God bless you each other you guys thought I was going to come up here and just do all the work huh nope the Lord wanted me to show you guys what Poland was all about and it and it's not just Poland but it's happening everywhere like the brother said all right so go to somebody that don't ever go to tell them how much you love them tell them something great that you see in them that God placed in them tough H go ahead no for real Go Go Caleb that's proud of you awesome amazing bro sister Alba quit acting like brother Mark go ahead and move go ahead and move Justin go show that love you guys are all amazing all right so my man come here brother come here I have never seen a man praise God like this guy I have never seen a heart like this guy has I don't just see him here at church proud of you bro you're an example and you're a missionary and you spread the word and you testify like all of us should right how do you know go ahead and look around and and just brother Jimmy could took like 10 more minutes just joking um but look around we really are the best of the best what cameras what camera can we look into I can't see you guys but that camera tell them you are the best of the best that God has to offer we we TR truly have the best you can you can be seated sorry we really do have the best though I mean from our youth to our elders um our founding [Music] Pastor our pastor he's got a hard job sometimes I see him exhausted but he don't care the only thing he cares about is this person needs something from God it's the only thing he cares about and I see our youth impressive impr impressive very impressive real real I I see them when they don't think I'm looking no sometimes I'll hang out with them and I I'm just really impressed that the the maturity and and the the amount of love that they have inside of them for a young age but they wouldn't have gotten that without all you older people don't worry I'm super old too but you know I think we I think it's really easy to tell each other all these things in here right it's really easy to testify to each other but how many of us go out there and do it to people that aren't in church that's that's a that's a whole another ball game go try going and speaking to somebody that doesn't believe in God or maybe they're bounded by you know a denomination or religion that's no I don't want to say nothing because they won't believe me they're gonna get mad at me they're GNA fire me who cares who cares God will still take care of you don't worry that's not for us to worry about right and we shouldn't we shouldn't stop ourselves from doing anything just because we think they might not receive it you never know you just never know I it was a team effort to get me in here they they worked as a team my my my wife my grandfather grandmother and you know they put the bait on the hood and then I hear brother Jerry brother Danny brother Anthony first time well they sunk the hook in and then the Ley and brother Tommy just Reed me in but we're too scared the funny thing is though that sometimes we can act like we can go out there and act just as dumb as everybody else just be real we do sometimes well there was women over there in Poland that when we went to go eat not just women there was it was like a boy to was a boy out there on the street hey you're looking for some drinks you want to go to the strip club we'll give you discounts and after the first one brother Tommy's like man man look at how Brave they are imagine if we could be that way and I was like you're righto to myself so every time one came up to us again after that I just told him God bless you Jesus Christ loves you and that was always the end of the conversation but why can't we do that I mean sister sister Jen Jen sister Jennifer's got a awesome testimony jennif there's so many others that have my wife you know there's so many there's everybody has something to say and to do you know and and and brother I I haven't seen you here before but bro God bless you welcome it might sound a little crazy but this is God's love this is God's love amen go out go out and start telling each other and don't forget how blessed we are you guys we're the best the best we have the best of the best don't let it get old to you amen God bless [Applause] you it's brother William's birthday too man God bless you you know what's the funny thing about brother Mark when we first met brother Mark tried to hug him and he'd run so fast from you was and as as uh the years have gone by exactly we wore him down buddy now now he can't stop hugging us now when brother Mark comes I'm like you know what that's I'm just he's he's exactly right it's the love of God and that you know um brother julan julan I I got him into a little bit of trouble little bit but it's good you know I I said brother julan I said you're you're gonna be preaching so I said you know I told Brother Kay I said you know brother you know brother julan is going to be preaching you know one of the services so as a matter of fact that Thursday night the very first service he was he was upset at me he says I got to preach tonight now but what was amazing about that he preached s such a simple message that that evening he preached about love exactly what we've been preaching tonight and little did he know that message that he preached set up the the entire weekend wasn't [Music] flashy but it was it was spoken with such conviction that I remember um the following morning we met people from from all over Belgium Romania ROM um Ukraine UK some from Spain different other places and I I got to talking to a to a brother from Ukraine he had been he had been in there in uh in Poland for for a couple years now but he but he he said to me that morning he goes I don't know how many people captured what I captured last night he said I captured that you all came for me I like wow wow I mean you you got that through a couple of a couple of sermons last night he says the love that that was that was demonstrated last night as of right now he says I can never be the same again I'm like wow wow if that happens on a Thursday night I mean what's going to happen on a Friday morning what's going to happen on a Friday night what's going to happen on a Saturday morning what's going to happen on a Saturday night what's going to happen on a Sunday morning every single service it was it was something that led to something else and the way that the way that the way that God has constructed every every single time we go out God has constructed a team we don't we don't know what we're what really what we're going to preach there's no specific uh theme but it always it always just comes together and as I I just want to read a just a quick scripture here in The Second Epistle of John um there's only one chapter to it so it's John 15 and it reads like this and now I beseech thee lady not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee but that which we had from the beginning that we love one another and this is love that we walk after his Commandments this is the Commandment that as ye have heard from the beginning ye should walk in it you know and that was that was kind of the the theme throughout this this entire uh this entire uh conference you know it took me back uh to December of 20 17 we were uh we were about ready to leave to to our second trip to to Uganda I was uh I was telling my telling my dad about what we're about what we were going to do and and where we where we were going to go and as we as we finished our convers ation he put his hand on my on my shoulder and he said finish my vision you know words like that they don't you don't take them lightly you can say well did your dad have a vision of of Poland because he always talked talked of Africa you better believe he did you better believe that he had this vision of Poland he had this vision of Norway he had this vision of Europe and why because he walked in it he walked in love he walked in righteousness and he told us and demonstrated to us the exact way to walk and his way he said you never walk alone say don't never walk alone don't never go by go out by yourself and I remember him telling telling uh brother cayb brother Tommy and I Cale Tommy his big his his big thing to us was he said stay together that wasn't just for us his sons but it was for us his sons amen amen when we have when when there is Success on the missionary field it's not just the ones that are there that have the success but it's all of us together why because as a church and as individuals we love the missionary field I love to hear when on that Sunday as we were leaving the one of the pastors there I got to know him really really well the first time we went to Poland got along great with his son but he says he told us he goes you have captured our heart you know when you hear stuff like that it makes makes you just feel so so humble makes you feel so so so small that somebody would say you have captured our hearts and to let everybody know they in New Mexico how much we love them you know every person that was there you know as you've as you've heard heard uh different stories I want to thank sister Abby for doing such a wonderful job on that video on Sunday everyone everyone that has that has given reports have done a fabulous a fabulous job you know and when you when you when you see people there you know as some of the ministers have already said they're not an emotional [Music] Bunch but I tell you that

help and I hope I don't get any of this story wrong and there was something inside of him like a burning to go talk to that man and he didn't have any extra money with him so he just goes up to this man and he starts hugging him and he he started telling him how much God loves him and he asked this if he would like to pray with him well this video he didn't post or he didn't put up there this was posted by some unknown Las crus social media and what's amazing about it is his his mom and his sister they they haven't uh they haven't really opened up a Bible before they've they've been going to
