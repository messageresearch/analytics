[1:27:37] before I share the stage buddy and I'm
[1:27:39] going to show them better Julie well how
[1:27:41] creation is done I feel come on lucky
[1:27:43] you're in my laboratory and milliwatt at
[1:27:45] audio
[1:27:46] science can create the kingdom up when
[1:27:49] engaging a mess of the present without
[1:27:51] fail you still remember by the Creator
[1:27:53] now unclear or invisible this is an
[1:27:56] outcome to to us and lived inside of our
[1:28:00] many vanastra proxy Annette is no

[1:29:32] is literally that's indisputable God and
[1:29:35] just be very invisible because you and I
[1:29:38] live in the laboratory

[1:34:54] former creation wow that's
[1:34:56] for city honest this is more of a Wow it
[1:34:59] is well much that what he has never been
[1:35:01] created yet looking obviously Tokyo
[1:35:03] haunted but who are they that will come
[1:35:07] into my laboratory but okay no sonic
[1:35:09] tails can tell I mean I wanna Tori oh
[1:35:11] what a challenge it is for us right now
[1:35:14] here ripped open Anna so I tell you what
[1:35:16] when he told me that I took that as a
[1:35:17] challenge your Tomatoes moon reto who
[1:35:20] wants to go into the laboratory and get
[1:35:22] inside I wanna Tonio I want to go yo can
[1:35:24] I make sure I'm in there can all see
[1:35:26] what I don't make it so you're gonna
[1:35:27] struggle under China your face is going
[1:35:32] to be tried to Fairweather provider who
[1:35:34] appoint un punto that will have to pray
[1:35:38] Lord don't take away that that that
[1:35:42] tribulation that trial that they're

[1:36:13] produce works for kill pork opposed it
[1:36:15] oh that's the only way you'll be able to
[1:36:18] show the invisible what give the link
[1:36:20] amount up where most rather whose deadly
[1:36:22] missive Lee some months back I spoke on
[1:36:26] the god particle how many didn't
[1:36:27] remember that Uno's meses as I've read
[1:36:29] in a particular videos and and and we
[1:36:31] understood how man is trying to
[1:36:33] comprehend it all decomposed Columbus
[1:36:35] resident and there's a problem how God
[1:36:37] created everything come on keV you're
[1:36:39] searching for the building blocks who's
[1:36:42] kind of places look at all the water
[1:36:43] together become a frying to break down
[1:36:46] every molecule and atoms that I'm gonna
[1:36:48] contact our molecular ion and protons
[1:36:51] and neutrons molecular Z proton they
[1:36:54] down determine where they can see how it
[1:36:55] all came together on the planet ver como
[1:36:57] skate also frequent alone but they leave
[1:36:59] out what puts it all together
[1:37:01] pero lo que reckon a few days como como
[1:37:03] o que los troncos we understand better
[1:37:06] percent and demos that is the Word of
[1:37:08] God I put it all together
[1:37:10] chalo Kunta todo we understood them
[1:37:12] through this teaching a travesty sensing
[1:37:14] in sentence what had come out of this
[1:37:16] locus as they collide these particles
[1:37:18] together common cases particulars chakra
[1:37:21] man we found out that it was what what
[1:37:23] is produced is antimatter that you know
[1:37:25] depression and Iran team material and
[1:37:27] anti is anything that is opposed to that
[1:37:29] anti a solo design contra and we can
[1:37:32] touch it it's matter toll okay to come
[1:37:34] with material but then there's
[1:37:35] antimatter right antimatter hearing
[1:37:37] about it is that if those things ever
[1:37:39] come together here's a see you're gonna
[1:37:41] hold on they try they'll try to
[1:37:43] annihilate each other but not Italian
[1:37:45] Nicky Larson tells now this is something
[1:37:47] because you know they're looking for
[1:37:50] these in these experimentations and it
[1:37:53] was experimental scale something they're
[1:37:54] looking for something
[1:37:55] it was boost come and go but what got me
[1:37:57] was that the other day
[1:37:59] look at me captain me is when I was at
[1:38:02] left on the our trip and knock a sumo
[1:38:05] senator be a they they said they
[1:38:06] discovered something that was that they
[1:38:08] had loaded them for for over 80 years
[1:38:11] I'll go back I said yeah IV estar fuera
[1:38:13] de gente and they called it the angel
[1:38:16] particle they I'm on a particular
[1:38:18] language my God if I could get into that
[1:38:20] right now
[1:38:21] well you're going to try the name come
[1:38:22] but I'm gonna hold that one off there
[1:38:24] are aware that they never get so I'm
[1:38:25] going to connect that later on but it is
[1:38:27] point where connect that is with these
[1:38:29] angels that become man when it's just
[1:38:31] uncle is tiene más el hombre
[1:38:33] but we'll get that into another one I
[1:38:34] don't even get me started on that but
[1:38:37] there's a angel particle is the
[1:38:39] particular indicator that it has its own
[1:38:41] anti particle in it to propia ante
[1:38:44] particular has the same mass there is a
[1:38:47] proprietary I so as a regular particle
[1:38:50] homo quad care particular n is an
[1:38:52] opposite electric or magnetic property
[1:38:55] kinases propeller is magnetic and that
[1:38:58] if they would ever come at each other
[1:39:00] Casey Anthony and ikusabe don't try to
[1:39:02] annihilate each other so I'm not a
[1:39:04] funicular there are same things in the
[1:39:05] natural realm tambien patola in the zone
[1:39:08] whatever believers pero como we
[1:39:10] undreamed and and hemos what is going on
[1:39:12] in the spirit okay stay I want Osaka on
[1:39:14] in Los Feliz Wow I don't see it as there
[1:39:17] that is during Joe particle si la parte
[1:39:20] la particular I believe in angel
[1:39:22] particles are your Crayola part people I
[1:39:24] want you to get this now watch this now
[1:39:26] here okay captain ISM and in this en
[1:39:28] esto what they're trying to understand
[1:39:31] look at the content and there is the
[1:39:33] both sides of it
[1:39:34] it's uncle's mother Branham says from
[1:39:36] dilemma run and these days two sides
[1:39:37] this episode another Jenny does the
[1:39:40] three skip well parallel Vampirella know
[1:39:42] the original and region and the anti in

[1:40:01] better one for a little she has a name
[1:40:04] Tina called death didn't embrace yeah my
[1:40:07] buddy goes on to say that of I thinking
[1:40:09] would you say that about the time that
[1:40:11] came came on earth
[1:40:12] Paragon dope ngoi Sierra able came on

[1:40:36] so focused on making this anniversary
[1:40:38] never worked side by side monolith ah
[1:40:41] matter/antimatter materia seem a
[1:40:43] particle/anti-particle what's equally
[1:40:45] I've ever seen is what brother man says
[1:40:47] if Einstein could have ever taken what
[1:40:49] he knew an emergency I said we're at the
