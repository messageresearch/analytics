three amen okay i like it better together let's turn in our bibles if we would this is to be like jesus number fourteen and messiah and this one would be subtitled the doctrine of jesus oh my tell your neighbor neighbor the doctrine of jesus somebody want to hear that this morning the doctrine of jesus christ hebrews 13 8 says jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever and i get a witness all right yeah all right now we're we're doing good this morning let's turn now to the book of saint mark the first chapter and we are going to read from the 21st to the 27th verse once again the doctrine of jesus jesus you have it you can say man there's some pages still going we'll give you a little bit of a little bit of time amen all right it reads like this verse 21 and they went into capernaum and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught entrant and they were astonished at his doctrine where he taught them as one that had authority but not as the scribes that's tremendous huh the scribe would teach us they would write they would teach we can teach a lot of things but the question is is there authority behind you're amen that's the way many times the scribes were asiran they taught but didn't have no authority behind it and finally here comes a man that stands up and teaches he insane and has authority behind his teachings and there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit that's tremendous we hear the preaching and we go out the same way shouldn't there be a deliverance going on there was a man with an unclean spirit and he cried out voices saying let us alone what have we to do with thee thou jesus of nazareth jesus come to destroy us what a message it must have been huh authority behind his words our thou come watch this and jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace and come out of him and when the unclean spirit had torn him and cried with a loud voice he came out of him and they were all they were all amazed in so much that they questioned may god add his blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated what a thing it is he commandeth the unclean spirits they obey him sometimes in a congregation we have a lot of unclean spirits sometimes we come to church and we're full of unclean spirits maybe in the week we've been seeing things that we shouldn't be seeing if you're watching something or seeing something you shouldn't be watching if you're reading something you shouldn't be reading it was so tremendous in in that in in the word of god how many remember last week jesus of nazareth and he got my attention where did where did mary live where did the angel go to to talk to mary maria from nazareth is that right i like that because the bible says it's possible to maintain yourself as a virgin especially wicked age because mary did it in the most wicked town we sure we want to hear the doctrine of jesus let's see why what what what he wants to tell us this morning don't just take it in the natural take it in the spirit watch this as they were all amazed at his doctrines where those unclean spirits obeyed him i'm going to tell you i don't care what you come to church with no important questions maybe drugs or maybe alcohol or pornography or whatever it may be pornography or simply you don't want to listen to your parents implementing or you don't want to listen to god's word [Music] why you should leave this place a church without doctrine brother branham says this is like a jellyfish it has no backbone espinazo we got a and they think that that that's life many people know the doctrine of their church and they think that that's life and all those things are fine we must read our bible we [Applause] and upon the first church is poured out the holy ghost what did they do they healed the sick they raised the dead it was not their own doctrine it was the doctrine of jesus jesus that is the new testament church is like listen in action yes sir yes come on church see you see that is the new testament church in action of jesus notice now doctrine without this authority is not the doctrine of jesus if we don't have the authority to cast out devils we don't have the more authority to heal the sick if we [Applause] mark 17-18 and these signs shall follow them that belief we can claim that we are believers the end the commission never dies i want you to tell your neighbor this is important that you get this important tell your neighbor the commission never dies [Applause] and the results are always the same i'm going to say that again i want you to tell your neighbor again the commission never dies the doctrine never changes but the results are always the same different god's will was that nobody would perish through his long suffering he's given us chance after chance and what do we do we ignore i've often said people bring up certain doctrinal points and i often say that if that certain doctrine will cause you to hate your brother or sister i don't want that doctor because it's not producing what the doctrine of jesus was to produce people come to the altar every kind of unclean spirit every foul spirit on them and they live with those same spirits that's not the doctrine of jesus i remember even hearing brother branham one time he left the service says they're driving off he sees a woman in a wheelchair coming out of the service delegation and brother brown says stop why is she coming out of church still in a wheelchair he couldn't put his mind around there's no reason for anyone to be sick amongst them there's no reason how many here want to know the doctrine of jesus jesus the doctrine of jesus you know what it is though your sins be as scarlet they shall be quiet they shall be as wolves when i see this i say man i i i can see why they were amazed my goodness is he the same yesterday today and foreign now you might say he's the same but is he the same in your life that's the question bring it home to yourself old are being saved in their sins too many people are being saved in their sins rather than being saved from their sins after 20 years i still like to smoke brother i still like to why i can't put my head around that you know how is that possible you ever come in contact with jesus this moment it's not possible if you say bro brother i tried it it didn't work then you you just try the church no it's not a church that saves your life change your life if we're still doing these little things after 30 years my goodness i like to take a social drink every now and then really [Applause] it's time that we get safe from our sins they were amazed at his doctrine we should be living a victorious life that again did you get that yo we should be living a victorious life above sin but instead we're trying to live a christian life while in a because christ gave us that promise it's the doctrine of christ come unto me all you that labor and are heavy ladies i'll give you rest my goodness how many are want to go on with the doctrine of christ that's why the first doctrine that that jesus preached jesus what's the first doctrine that jesus preached lilly tell them this you can phone a friend if you like where's your friend what's the first doctrine you have you have other friends she's trying to get your attention and her breakfast you can turn around if you like ask the sisters behind you anybody know nobody the first doctrine that jesus preached okay you can ask another guy if you i can just close church right now and just stop it right here and we'll just we'll go home but not till after somebody answers it right okay paul tell them the first doctrine that jesus preached hey you got a couple of ministers behind you the other side he must be born again don't you ever forget from this day forward when somebody asked you what is the first doctrine jesus preached come on now i want all you young men to be able to say i've been born again i want your sister to say because i've been born again because it was his first doctrine that he preached that's where it all starts that's where it all starts is the new birth and yet there are so many versions of the new birth nowadays if you just bow your heads and say a prayer born again blind leaders of the blind santiagos leaders is that right come on now so many different versions of the new birth oh you have a tingle down your spine oh tina's honest and you got really emotional in church and wrong with any of those things but here comes our prophet of jesus [Applause] in other words there is a i don't have one here but there is a veil there and he simply does this it's me that's it he shows you who he is you can because then jesus called his disciples unto him said i have compassion on the multitude because they continue with [Applause] they continue jesus noticed jesus that this multitude had continued with him for three days what are the three days the three stages of grace justification young people it's okay to do those things when you come and then you expect a quick fix no he could do it all at once but do you continue when you leave church can you continue listening to the word come on church i want you to understand this now they continue that's where many people fail to the lord son justification about this house and now i praise god oh i love you justified me who's difficult they don't go on but and therefore they don't get any further with god tell you young people that i continue continue continuing continue continuing something with god now let's continue young people we gotta make it gotta be or cut in line somewhere don't work like that the question is that can you continue most people don't continue am i talking to anybody okay fine i'm going to read a little bit [Music] okay how many young people are get sidetracked let me see that's what you're saying i see okay how many older people get sidetracked oh my ouch can i continue on the doctrine of jesus oh yes the doctrine of jesus is to continue in the word continue can you put it up there young man to persist in activity or the process is it's to remain in existence or operation it's to remain in a specified position where's our position don't understand this this is the age that we live in agenda foreign and yet they didn't abandon the faith the millennials nowadays los millennials have no idea nothing is what it is to make a sacrifice for something they have no idea of what has been sacrificed so that we could have what we have a nation that is bound to a constitution no more that's yeah we have a bunch of politicians politicos that know zero or nothing about god and don't even know the sacrifice that our forefathers made abandoning [Applause] oh the doctrine of jesus has has has never been or never will change that was what the apostles preached acts chapter [Music] is there a day here today come oh come on you want the doctrine of jesus they continued in what continued and fellowship well i believe what the pastor said but but i don't want to have fellowship you can't pick and choose the parts of the doctrine you want no points don't just eat what you want no sorrow this is not a buffet why because it'll make you change i'm afraid that he's going to send me to hell if i don't change fear came upon every soul that a believer has it's a godly but i do have that fear and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles and unto the doctrine continue in them this is important this morning got to continue in there it's not good enough just to have a good service i was talking the other day me and my wife were outside here goes our neighbor she stops there and and she starts talking about the holy ghost but the more you hear somebody everybody has a name so i named the holy ghost you don't name my holy ghost my i've named him sam sam sam why'd you name him because i don't know if it's a if the holy spirit is male or female oh at that moment you could see the spirit just picky pick out his head what a shame that you wouldn't even think that yeah that you try to put god in some non-gender or gender or whatever box you built somebody that don't know would say wow well maybe that's there's some truth i don't follow things that have some truth in it come on young people i want you to hear this i don't think that oh that sounds i don't follow the word of god because it sounds good i follow it because i personally have i said well one of these days if you really want to sit down let's let's down and talk john 8 31. then jesus said to those jews which believed on him what did they believe on is john 59 and as the father hath loved me so have i loved you continue ye in my love and we love you as long longest people are doing this to us but i challenge you and somebody goes like this one time i challenge you at that moment to continue in love okay some of these if you continue in my words oh but i teach them the word open listen it doesn't have an effect in our children many times young people don't use that as an excuse because the tree of life is before every one of you you're going to choose and you're choosing right now god be god let's serve him with that simply all right continue is the key continuous and if you go into the scripture you'll find paul telling the people to continue john sums it up well in second john 1 9. whosoever transgressive and abideth not in the doctrine of christ hath not young man you guys didn't even say nothing i'm going to go keep going [Applause] all right let's go on because if i get into this i ain't getting out for a while so you got a little room comfortable this morning watch this now that's why when we look at this why so many people follow jesus jesus so many people followed brother branham followed the different messengers that god sent different messages they followed them when they were healing the sick when they were raising the dead doing oh we love the lord when he's healing or healing our my baby or my my loved one and he heals them we love the lord we love the ministry but when the word comes forth it begins to tell us where we're wrong as long as you're going and having a good time [Music] yeah let's go out let's have fun they love you all praise god we go to church okay that's right watch this they loved all those things but when the next stage of their ministry began continuing same 70 people 70 disciples the same 70 that jesus sent out they came back rejoicing and they said the bible is what the bible said that they said this is a hard statement and they walked no more with him hard statements young you can only continue if if there is that faith the revelation to do so because the word of god is so contrary to us as human beings are thinking his thoughts his ways are so far above ours so let's go on are you still they married likewise also as it was in the days of lot they but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed and the word revealed once again when will the kingdom of god come you don't have to look on the internet to find the kingdom of god the kingdom of god is within you know he turns to his disciples and he begins to speak about the days of three distinct persons the days of because in there you find three groups of people shall it be in the day of the son of man the son of man [Applause] we don't fit in the day of noah of man so shall it be when the son of man is revealed where is he being revealed is jesus christ he revealed himself in a prophet by staying and continuing in the world revealing himself over the body of believers that's you and i this the days is the son of man is revealed what day is that your day is my day me the day of the son of man revealing himself i can go through all these three things brother brown talks about three pools talks about noah and his three pools and if i had time i would go through noah's and his three three pools so you can you can study that out if you like go to the message souls that are in prison now all that would believe into the ark we see first we see second and then we will see the third preacher that sign was the end times the first thing you know the door was closed and there was only one person that know or that knew that that sign what that sign was the bible said the sins of sodom vexed his righteous soul daily and told him what was going on behind him he's the one that abraham was crying i'm gonna destroy sodom he said if you can find 50 would you not destroy them wow we could get into a lot of things and and that but we'll we're gonna we need to because of time i think my time is almost up yeah let's go forward but as he went on you see the picture developed and all that's left like i said each one of those is a study in itself but i want to get to something here jesus ministries three polls brother branham says you said that mother branham what was what is and what will come watch the parallels of his ministry two thousand years ago and his ministry through a prophet in these last days his first poll brother braham says jesus first pool he become very now it's not the first poll that shows what's on the inside of the person it's the second pool because the second pole comes the discernment he was the prophet that moses spoke and when he went to tell them how they were living and the things they were doing he become very unpopular we know that that's the attitude we take many times that was the second poll brother says i wonder if it has typed right back again remember he was judas iscariot very religious but he couldn't go all the way now the holy spirit is working in your soul right now that's right [Music] he would he could take part of the message but the rest of it he couldn't stomach like many people even today they can take part of the message the only way you'll ever get help here's are you getting it is he turned around and said you you can't kill the ministry it lives on you can put the messenger to sleep but you can't put the message to sleep [Applause] but nobody his ministry was rejected by the people he then preached to those souls that were unsavable he preached to the lost that couldn't be saved anymore souls in hell that did not accept mercy deliver a vosotros ah and as watch this now and as the father sent him to preach to the living parallel to those who had hope and then present because the spirit of christ living in us does not change the nature of him or doesn't change god's system he must be the same in every generation the in his [Music] does anybody believe that okay the same ministry reincarnated in his church right now and if [Applause] three pools of his ministry you know what they are right yes first pull somebody help me get this own friend phone the audience do whatever you got to do personally praying for the sick exactly and and what did he have the gift that he gave his his hand would turn colored right right right he would know he would have vibrations and so forth the second pole it number one it was the opening of the words it was the power of the spoken word now in action let's not do something for god and pray and believe god for these things [Music] in the message of the new ministry he's in god wants us then to saw the multitude that they had continued hello and they hurt his doctrine and were amazed he had such authority that's where god's trying to get the church to have the same authority as sons of god whole creation is groaning we pray for them now but then pool because he cannot impersonate him he can impersonate the first poor person but he can impersonate the third place because you [Music] that you better have authority to its perfect condition once again bringing us to our original condition with god and it will not be used in a great way until this council begins to tighten up you're not used to sitting so long but but but pinch yourself i wanted to see jesus christ this is brother branham's desire i wanted to see jesus christ manifested manifesto without one flaw i look in the mirror i see so many flaws brother brown's desire i want to see him manifested in other words that we can get ourselves out of the way there will be no flaws once again i wanted to see jesus christ manifested without of one flaw but being known to the church here that's during his time to the church [Applause] where nobody can say one word against that's the problem is we don't go far enough we love first polls we love healing services we love the movement of the spirit so then when when does a ministry then come to its perfection closing with this ministry when it's been preached when does a ministry come to its perfection the ministry comes to its perfectionistic that's why people get this when people say oh brother brown preached the message the lamb broke the seals through his ministry that was the ministry of the son of man the ministry of the his body acting out his mind and it's not given just for you to say oh i know that it's given so that it changes your life changes who you are that's why the new birth is a revelation of jesus christ personally to you you can't stay the same person the mystery should be finished you and i and me is death how many love the lord when those armenians did you stand to your feet it's revelation church it's revelation and we know we don't need a veil anymore it's time to take the veil off we are changed i want to just read this last quote every true servant of god has got a book full of divine promises that he can offer to the bride i come this morning with a book full of promises he won't hold any of them back i the presence of the lord so strong right now he'll give every one of them freely a true servant a model servant that god can put his trust in us he won't try to hide or hold back one thing from her el notro terrades because a true servant knows that she is the oncoming queen she is the oncoming queen you are the oncoming queen that's why we can't hold nothing back that has been poor in us for your benefits for you this morning and i'm telling you i don't care what it is that you need no important divine promises at your fingertips i'm here to tell you this if you can let one which is christ i offer it to you the ministry here offers it to you for what we have been given and when you receive it freely you have received leave it a message it's on your lap with every head bowed with
