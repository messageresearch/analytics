[Music] [Music] it's once again a release from your gifts by the power of California something has released you there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit he dipped his finger in his own blood and he writes pardoned on you so that's what repentance really is it's to be walking one way and then turning around and you start walking together now you know you have really good yeah when a man or a woman is released there's no more desire soccer [Music] [Music] therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God [Music] through our Lord Jesus Christ you know the word of God [Music] there are people that receive the words they received the word Upon A Stony Place Ginger but since they don't have any Roots the enemy comes and puts that word of Salvation and why is it because they have not put on the helmet because let me read your scripture in Ephesians chapter two verse and the scripture says and you we're dead in trespasses the message is called accept God's gifts every sinner here inside out Monday wherever you are now already your sins any devio as far as God is concerned is forgiving you now he calls together his friends and neighbors saying unto them Rejoice with me before I found my sheep which was lost the Lord says I say unto you that likewise Joy shall be found in heaven over one sinner that repenteth [Music] brothers and sisters Our God moans us and if he doesn't like it he brings us and Moses again he makes us so that he can make us and I thank the Lord for that um and I believe he can show you that as well and just as he has redeemed me that not only have preached the message but have lived it with their lives and that is something nowadays that you cannot find that's what you call rare you know I was thinking today the first time we came to Uganda Uganda it was placed on our pastor's heart and we came with uh with with a group of five men we had no idea who anybody was

of you know who your father is [Music] and after a while [Music] oh this is very very important that way you come then to sanctification that's a very important state is Young because when you hit sanctification [Music] [Applause] [Music] in the first place [Music] Holy Spirit [Music] um [Music] be gone this happened [Music] that's destruction and those are the attributes [Music] sometimes [Music] [Music] [Music] let's take a picture over here with them you take a picture [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] he always took something more [Music] he no

for the word we AK a lot of things but how do you know when you really have the Holy Ghost is it how much you jump is it how much you sing all those things are good [Music] when you can punctuate every word with an amen do you understand me that's how you know you have the Holy Ghost to punctuate every word with an amenamina [Music] guide for you is that all he did for you yet he raised from
