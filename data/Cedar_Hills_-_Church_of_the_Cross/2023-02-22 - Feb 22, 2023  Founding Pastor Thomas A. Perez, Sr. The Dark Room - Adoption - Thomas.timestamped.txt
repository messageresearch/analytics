[40:04] [Music]
[40:25] can you give one to the Lord this
[40:27] evening
[40:29] [Applause]
[40:35] let's turn into our Bibles the opening
[40:37] scriptures
[40:41] the book of Ephesians
[40:43] chapter one
[40:47] if it if episode
[41:00] and it reads like this
[41:02] Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
[41:05] will of God to the Saints which which
[41:07] art Ephesus and to the faithful in
[41:10] Christ Jesus
[41:11] Pablo Apostle De Jesus
[41:17] Christan an episode
[41:19] Grace be unto you and peace from God our
[41:23] Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ
[41:25] Gracia is
[41:30] blessed be the God and father of our
[41:33] Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us
[41:35] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[41:37] places in Christ
[41:47] celestiales
[41:48] according as he had chosen Us in him
[41:52] before the foundation of the world that
[41:54] we should be holy and Without Blame
[41:56] before him in love
[42:03] Santos is
[42:06] having predestinated us unto the
[42:09] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[42:12] himself according to the good pleasure
[42:15] of his will and amore
[42:29] and again that title was the dark room
[42:31] the adoption is
[42:48] there are messages I mean sakis
[42:52] that we are get very enthused when we
[42:55] hear them
[42:59] we get very excited
[43:02] then there are other messages amen
[43:13] now
[43:14] to the word adoption la palabra adoption
[43:18] it means to
[43:21] maintainer to support a support to draw
[43:25] close relation
[43:30] a word of position
[43:34] it's tremendous when I when I read this
[43:37] instrument
[43:39] I'm gonna read it again
[43:42] adoption adoption let me ask the
[43:45] question first
[43:47] how many of you want to be adopted
[43:52] no one in his right mind no organ
[43:57] foreign
[44:03] would not would be crazy really not to
[44:06] be one not to be
[44:09] or want the adoption
[44:13] so we all want to be adopted
[44:17] but how many know in here that there is
[44:21] a law of adoption
[44:25] so right away it has to clear from your
[44:29] mind that
[44:36] if you're predestinated
[44:40] you're gonna be adopted
[44:43] and a lot of people just think it in
[44:46] under those terms
[44:51] now that's that's nice
[44:54] I would like to think like that you
[44:57] start up in sarasi but it has more than
[45:00] that
[45:02] a lot of people say
[45:04] God is good
[45:06] how many believe God is good
[45:09] he is good yes
[45:12] but he's also a consuming fire
[45:17] amen so then
[45:20] our faith that we have
[45:23] is based on the Virgin birth of the Lord
[45:29] Jesus Christ
[45:33] is that right our faith is based on that
[45:38] is
[45:42] on the Virgin birth of the Lord Jesus
[45:45] Christ
[45:48] amen now we understand
[45:52] that Jesus Christ Jesus Christ when he
[45:56] was born
[45:59] the Virgin
[46:01] had no relations with the
[46:04] menaciones
[46:08] amen you understand that
[46:11] all right now I want to hear an amen to
[46:13] see if you're awake
[46:15] I don't want to hear a lot of amends
[46:18] because I want you to learn
[46:21] but our our faith and I know you you've
[46:25] heard this maybe since you were a child
[46:30] I've heard many things since I was a
[46:32] child
[46:37] but not really understood them
[46:41] and I'm barely understanding a little
[46:44] bit about the Virgin birth
[46:51] amen so then
[46:54] we understand that the birth of Jesus
[46:57] Christ
[46:59] it came straight from the mind of God
[47:05] amen amen now to get your attention
[47:11] so I can base myself
[47:16] it comes from the mind of
[47:21] God's mind
[47:24] God's Minds thought it
[47:28] and that's how it came yes but it didn't
[47:33] it did not just come by him thinking
[47:38] he had to express it
[47:41] and for him to express it alone he had
[47:45] to have a vessel to express it through
[47:50] but it was virgin birth foreign
[48:42] is that right this was correct did Jesus
[48:45] cause a massacre
[48:49] yes he caused the massacre
[48:52] song because there came men to inquire
[48:56] about it
[49:00] and when they did
[49:03] they killed all the children from two
[49:06] years under mataron
[49:10] he caught the great Massacre
[49:14] and was rejected
[49:18] back in the Book of Genesis of the
[49:21] Genesis we find
[49:23] a person by the name of Abel in
[49:25] contramos
[49:28] and we know that his brother killed him
[49:32] I want you to notice his brother killed
[49:36] him
[49:40] now watch we're dealing with adoption
[49:45] his brother killed him
[49:50] but God substituted something there is
[49:59] something there and gave
[50:03] them Seth is
[50:06] it said amen now Jesus Jesus was our
[50:13] substitute in Calvary
[50:28] I want to get your attention to
[50:30] something
[50:31] Jesus was our substitute Jesus nuestro
[50:36] substituto in Calvary in calvario
[50:40] you know when he went to Calvary
[50:44] he couldn't hardly wait to get to
[50:47] Calvary
[50:50] is that true
[50:52] that's false is
[50:56] and that's where we're going to hit on
[50:57] adoption
[51:00] the life of Jesus
[51:04] has to be our life
[51:08] same life Miss mavida not another
[51:12] spiritu the same life la misma vida when
[51:17] Jesus Cameo Jesus Vino
[51:20] I hope you get this first
[51:23] partes so that you can understand where
[51:25] I'm going
[51:27] when Jesus Cameo Jesus did he know
[51:32] everything
[51:35] no he did not no no the Bible says
[51:39] that he grew in wisdom and stature
[51:44] is amen
[51:50] now
[51:51] when he grew in this stature
[51:56] amen
[51:58] he he had to come to a
[52:02] Crossroad in his ministry
[52:10] and when he came to this crossroadsero
[52:17] he was met by a
[52:22] propheta is that right now I want you to
[52:25] know I want you to make sure you know
[52:28] because a lot of people think they know
[52:29] it and they don't really know it
[52:32] and that's why we have some so much
[52:34] problem in the church
[52:43] so much confusion there should be no
[52:46] confusion
[52:48] but was he met by a
[52:52] propheta he sure did and what was the
[52:56] name of that Prophet
[52:58] his name was John is that right
[53:03] I'm just going to talk
[53:05] as long as I can
[53:09] now what did the prophet do to Jesus
[53:16] he washed him
[53:19] is that right it says correcto did he
[53:22] wash him
[53:23] did he baptize him in the river
[53:26] was according to the law wasn't the
[53:30] sacrifice
[53:34] had to be washed
[53:36] and you know when when John saw him
[53:41] the Bible says he forbade him which

[1:01:54] message
[1:01:59] they think that that's it this is
[1:02:02] born again
[1:02:06] try your hair so much confusion and
[1:02:10] Chaos in the message churches
[1:02:17] one says one thing the other one says
[1:02:19] another thing and my goodness it is is
[1:02:23] just a big mess is
[1:02:33] amen
[1:02:34] now he was trying for a provado why was
[1:02:39] he tried
[1:02:42] the devil said this
[1:02:45] if you are the son of God
[1:02:51] let these Stones turn to bread
[1:02:56] how many times has that gone through
[1:02:59] your mind
[1:03:02] are you a Son of God
[1:03:05] are you a daughter of God
[1:03:08] maybe I'm not possibly no soy
[1:03:12] every one of you that that this thought
[1:03:15] has crossed you one time or the other
[1:03:17] how do you know these days
[1:03:19] well I believe that brother's the Son of
[1:03:21] God but I don't believe I am one
[1:03:25] so then when when the trial comes
[1:03:29] what must you do okay
[1:03:33] you won't know what to do sir
[1:03:37] unless you yourselves
[1:03:40] follow the Bible
[1:03:43] and follow what Jesus what happened to
[1:03:46] Jesus
[1:03:50] then you can start patterning your life
[1:03:57] if thou be the Son of God
[1:04:01] you you at this point
[1:04:04] when you accept the Lord
[1:04:07] you and you're born again
[1:04:10] you must find your identity
[1:04:17] you know you hear people saying that
[1:04:19] brother thinks he's that I'll kill him
[1:04:21] but I don't believe he's there
[1:04:24] if that brother would take more time to
[1:04:28] find out who he is he won't have to
[1:04:30] worry about the other brothers
[1:04:35] but we worry too much about who is who
[1:04:39] and who is not uh
[1:04:41] OS
[1:04:48] is that right yes it's correct and
[1:04:51] that's not adoption
[1:04:55] I preached the word
[1:04:57] I'm not safe because I'm a preacher you
[1:05:00] know
[1:05:01] I preach because I love the Lord
[1:05:06] and and that's that's why I do it
[1:05:09] I have to work my salvation
[1:05:16] amen through fear and trembling foreign
[1:05:38] all right
[1:05:42] slowly
[1:05:43] let's pass you three years passed
[1:05:48] then came Mount
[1:05:51] Transfiguration
[1:05:54] three years after his baptism
[1:06:00] when he was transfigured
[1:06:03] or or went up the mountains
[1:06:08] he took with him three Witnesses
[1:06:12] is that right is correct watch closely I
[1:06:17] preached at least 100 messages on
[1:06:19] adoption but this is the first one
[1:06:23] this will really open it up
[1:06:26] if you follow it
[1:06:29] three Witnesses
[1:06:34] and when they were there with him
[1:06:37] the Bible says that he was transfigured
[1:06:40] he said
[1:06:41] transfigurado and two beans
[1:06:46] came out of another Dimensions
[1:06:51] they weren't here
[1:06:53] but they appeared
[1:06:55] From Another Dimension
[1:06:59] it was Moses and Elijah Moises now the
[1:07:05] three Witnesses
[1:07:06] they knew the story about Moses and
[1:07:10] Elijah
[1:07:13] they had read the Scrolls containing the
[1:07:17] law that Moses had brought
[1:07:21] amen so they knew about them
[1:07:24] can you imagine they're feeling when
[1:07:28] they saw these two beings
[1:07:35] can you imagine think for a while
[1:07:39] and then appears another great personage
[1:07:43] and then another great personage appear
[1:07:45] right by him
[1:07:50] but not just any person is
[1:07:55] two great persons
[1:07:57] personas from another Dimensions
[1:08:00] comes into this dimensions
[1:08:05] And when they see them
[1:08:09] this is the way
[1:08:10] Peter James and John they were like this
[1:08:14] I can imagine they were like this
[1:08:19] and Peter Pedro being bold
[1:08:24] um
[1:08:25] yeah
[1:08:33] karpas
[1:08:42] thanks
[1:08:54] let's make three tents
[1:08:58] one for Moses
[1:09:00] one for Elijah no palias one for Jesus
[1:09:06] and before
[1:09:08] yantes where they could say anything
[1:09:11] else
[1:09:14] came from Heaven is
[1:09:16] that right is this correct and we know
[1:09:19] the story
[1:09:21] and the voice said this is
[1:09:24] this is my beloved Son
[1:09:29] in whom I am pleased to dwell in and
[1:09:32] came in
[1:09:36] here
[1:09:40] is that right so it's correcto

[1:09:58] adoption again
[1:10:01] to
[1:10:02] maintainer maintenance
[1:10:05] to support

[1:10:15] a word of position
[1:10:21] I don't know I don't know if you
[1:10:22] understand this
[1:10:23] I don't know if you're understanding
[1:10:25] this is but if you have read adoptions
[1:10:29] you're going to understand what I'm
[1:10:31] saying

[1:10:37] that means he was supported
[1:10:42] he was became a close relationship
[1:10:50] and he received the word opposition
[1:10:56] now now remember

[1:16:54] because the sixth step of the stature is
[1:17:01] to be like
[1:17:04] godliness is to be like God
[1:17:07] is
[1:17:15] we sing it locantamos but you know what

[1:20:51] Silver City
[1:20:53] never recognizes me as a minister in
[1:20:57] this town

[1:21:04] as long as I have the order of
[1:21:07] Melchizedek
[1:21:22] foreign
[1:21:54] that's the order we should look foreign

[1:25:14] saying when people say that spirit is

[1:25:22] this is the way some Churches sing down
[1:25:25] at the cross
[1:25:27] they want to make it boogie boogie you
[1:25:29] know down at the cross where my savior
[1:25:32] died he didn't go that way

[1:33:20] he was appointed for support he was a
[1:33:25] relation
[1:33:27] he had the mechanics inside of him
