hearts de corazon amen so we ask we pray that it is a blessing to you this morning we ask that you continue to pray also for brother brother julius continues and his wife i tell you the devil don't like what we're doing and the attack is real the attack is on and he's going to do all that he can to try to disrupt what god has going on but to no avail what god is doing ain't nothing going to stop it we just have to understand and that's why we come to this message today we want to make sure that that we are not fools and slow of heart necessity scripture we've been reading hebrews the the 13th chapter in the eighth verse can we read that together always nice to see your lovely faces and amen all together jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever amen amen we can go to the next scripture it is found in luke 24 i'm going to read just the the you may be seated as well get into the message and and we start to read this verse every moment wave at each other again same brothers amen so good to really it is good to see each other really so good to see all of you amen god bless you luke 24 25 lucas it reads like this now this is uh of course i'm going to start with verse 17. we know that this scripture is the two two that are on the road to emmaus jesus draws near jesus i may like when jesus draws in here and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as you walk and are sad orchestras i look around and i see you already i see a lot of people sad tired and sick let me tell you but shouldn't we be renewing our strength every day the scripture says let's continue reading and one of them whose name was cleopas answering said unto him thou only a stranger in jerusalem and has not known the things which are come to pass there in these days because they're within their own speech they are acknowledging they're acknowledging that prophecy has come to pass and they talk like that but they don't really realize that it has come to pass and he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty indeed and word before god and all the people and if he is the same yesterday and today and how the chief priest and this is verse 20 and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done we're trusting or we are we we have or we trust no questions once again living in the past but today is this they said is the third day once again i'm going to say it again but today is the third day this is them talking maybe today will be our third day maybe it is today that jesus will step out and and walk with you yeah praise god the third day is a good day you're sick or whatever it's a perfect day you when we talk about the third day there are so many scriptures in the bible you don't have to turn to it but exodus 19 17 says yes yes amen it's the third day hosea six one through three says jose says for one and two says come and let us return unto the lord well vamos al senor for he has torn he will heal us [Music] and we shall live in his sight i say this morning praise god that those three days are three stages of grace three stages of grace bring you through to a new birth let's continue reading and and see how this story we have heard so many messages on this on this subject but watch where we're going this morning verse 22 now of course 24. yay and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the sepulchers last and when they found not his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulcher and found it even so as the woman had said but him they saw nothing then he said unto them o fools slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself got to explain something first matthew 5 222. this isn't dude he's just talking of course before is this jesus and he's saying this this is everybody got it we got it you got to get this part because then then this this will clear up some things here it says but i say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of judgment anybody here angry with their brother without a cause no no okay let's keep on reading then and whosoever shall say to his brother raqqa which means empty one. shall be in danger of the council and whosoever shall say thou full shall be in danger of hellfire three things here if you're angry with that with your brother without a cause you're in danger of the judgments if i disagree now listen closely if i disagree with someone you're doing this someone disagrees with me and i feel like i don't like that person maybe this is the prophet of god he says it's the prophet of you disagree with someone or they disagree with you do you send this accordingly and there's a woman and you feel like i don't like that person he says the spirit of christ has departed from you el espirito de christo wrong with us he goes on to say if you say to your brother raka which means empty in other words if you tell your brother you're an empty one and you don't do nothing to help fill him you'll if you say thou fool bro you'll be in danger of hell fire now how could jesus say then jesus put this dude don't call your brother a fool then he turns around [Music] it almost seems like something's not right there what is that it's not that something's not right no skin washed stupid oh gosh that's a bad word i better not my significa i'm glad that the adli my my my granddaughter's asleep because i'm not supposed to be saying though the other day brother branham was hitting it hard and he said he used the word stupid it says the that's not the way that jesus was using the word full over when jesus said in luke to his disciples this word falls in the greek significa significa which simply means sensual significance carnal or flesh he's not calling them stupid or blackheads watch this now it is derived from noise which means to exercise the mind when he says all full now now how many understand that to this point is just two different words that he's using now now let's go here now to matthew 28. when he says now we must then exercise our minds to observe important it's important because to us many times observe is to cross our teaching them to observe all things is teaching them to observe all things you gotta guard all things hey that's what satan wants he wants to take everything from us he wants to take every promise that god has given us every blessing that god's given us to get it take it from you jesus is telling us to observe all things simply once again it's implemented to watch or guard all things so that there's no loss or injury keep your eye upon it take note of prophecy this is what jesus is saying once again there's okay history of his mind to observe all now that we understand this we can get into our message now and slow of heart because we're carnal many times and we don't exercise our minds you know we don't exercise our minds in the word why our heart is slow how many ever feel like you're slow sometimes what does this [Music] there's days huh yes in first [Music] i understand those days there's not much activity going on when your heart is slow when you sit around and you're just not doing nothing your heart is at rest it's a at resting [Music] what the scripture had concerning him for his days this is fools and slow of heart insensation to understand the scriptures that were promised for this agenda [Music] this is could he say it again of heart insensators believe all the scriptures say about this day you believe that this lair is cnh put him outside of the church he says fools and slaw of hearts didn't say that they didn't believe he said that they were slow to believe they believed but but very slowly how many have ever found yourself you you kind of don't seem to get it right then no capital location i might not get a lot of things real right away bother us bother us because why are we slow to believe this don't let because there was no exercise going on let's see what what jesus has told us they weren't thinking like that all they were doing the bible says is they were talking and being sad many times when we're sad it's because of that which is almost three times because we're not in the world it comes up time that we gotta get into the world it's the time to get in like we never have before well that we know what the scripture says we know what the prophet said is the prophet we know what they're found in pastor we understand where we're at now now notice this order he checked on him it's not pumping enough blood through your whole body and so there are um you get dizzy yeah um you get fatigued it's a fatigue okay shortness of breath the corto respirator okay chest pains the lord is the petu i think we all this is pretty much everybody how many of you feel maybe at times like that spiritually it's sometimes faint it's tired sometimes we forget things when we get like that we forget things we forget all the promises when we're in the middle of a battle we forget all the great things that god has almost almost like if you couldn't do this now now why do we get in this condition because there's no exercise going on there's nothing to get our cardio or our our hearts pumping timothy 4 17. you don't have force heaven you don't have to turn to it exercise yourself unto godliness i don't know why but but when i when i speak to people many different people they automatically think that that that that god just works by hocus pocus we know because we all we all all of us say oh lord please do this for me for me lord get this done you know we we we go through that but we don't do what the scripture says how can we expect god to come on the scene we haven't done what the scripture has done says you got to exercise yourself oh no lord just give me godliness in your dummy and then you wonder why you don't see the lord moving in because we're slow to believe all that the prophets have said to believe the scriptures that have been spoken the children and the young people i'm amazed i'm amazed that they can tell you a movie repeat the whole movie [Music] in other words that's what we do the children stay so much in front of the television but after a while that's all the children do especially everything that's going to happen they can tell you everything that's that is being said but ask they'll find the shortest version why because they don't exercise themselves but who's supposed to be helping them training them to exercise we're getting into our message now who's supposed to be training them who's supposed to no no what they don't want us they don't sit still we'll make them sit still who's the parents around you you have the authority to to sit him down i want you to do me a favor this week i want you to tally up how much time they spend on the tablet and television i really want you guys to do this hello everybody how much time they spend listening to a message how much time they spend reading the bible i want you to and at the end of the week do it for yourself this week you know the tv's off make this tally look good at the end of the week way more time we'll see but then it'll go next week it'll go right back to the waist but do it for yourself because numbers don't lie it tells you what it was what it is now now i tell you that too to test your faith i tell you that to challenge you uh i want you to really see what's going on in your life i don't want to just live my life and just and just say well you know i i hope this happens most people have hope and they think it's faith a world of difference there's nothing even they're not even close i want you to get this tremendous really why is it then that we exercise our minds over a lot of things when we should be exercising ourselves onto godliness it wasn't even very long ago jesus had told them what was going to happen i mean this was not five years ago this was not oh uh uh uh 30 years ago jesus begins to talk to them and he had just told them this what was gonna happen he laid it out for them this wasn't the whole plan he lays it out he went for jesus and he showed his disciples and he's telling them how he must go to jerusalem many things of the elders suffrage and the scribes and be killed but be raised again the third day this is plain english it's just i think we often understand that peter then peter took him this is pedro and peter began he's rebuking him think about it put yourself in in peter's shoe i'm not going to see it i don't want to i don't want to accept that no jesus you're not that's not going to happen he's saying that he says be as far from the lord this shall not be unto thee how many times does the lord tell us things that's the best in those decency and we don't want it to be that you know what do we do we push it out of our minds mm-hmm how many of you could really take it call me satan nobody got myself i ain't gonna follow him no more i don't know what you're saying i'm going to church i was just going to make them get behind me saying that that's an offense to me it is in other words in other words you you think that you're going to stop the plan of god enough to me there is an offensive get behind me for thou savor is not the things with that god oh but those that be of men those are the things that we save many times muchos versus we don't see things novemos courses because that's not what we had in mind yes that's right yes sir yes you'll see it's nothing but the truth we've only been with with the master for three and a half years are you with me this morning we've only been with the master three and a half years we can we we should have more time with him we need some growing we need to mature he can't i was you saw the king john passed away i think for a moment that i was i know we'll see brother john again but i wasn't looking at that i was shocked in of course we're in the middle of a revival oh coming my dad do you mean okay i i don't get it no no no i don't question the lord i've learned you know i've learned years ago not to question them but i have some questions and i asked questions this doesn't make sense to me i'm thinking all these things right it doesn't make sense and as i i remember talking with brother brother diego and later on and i had i had mentioned it to him and i i i as we we talked about it about a week later i got together again with brother diego diego and we're talking about this and he looks at me and he says make sure i'm saying it right i was thinking you would just stop in sunday how can this be even possible he said until the lord reminded him of oh my and when brother diego is telling me this i remember too and i could hear jesus there's a lady with the royal garments in royal garments and that's what prompted me you just look at me as i began to think about me and i said oh lord fools and then you know all that i am i don't look at nobody else i look in the mirror of god's word how as i looked at that and i said lord forgive me you see in our minds we think it's going to be a certain way but i also know by the scripture god will never take a man because it's about how much scripture that we're unbelievers almost incredible we're just slow twitter my lord i look at brother branham bill de montebrano 56 years old when he passed away i remember brother or that man brother buford dallas brother branham brennan this was the same year brother branham dies with me as your front man we can you can have the greatest you've ever had and he said no he said no no buford no beaufort my season is over my goodness in our minds we think that the longer we live the more we can do why do we want more time we are creatures of time but it don't matter how old we always want more time oh lord let me try to make right all my wrongs oh my i'm on my deathbed oh let me make things right every day he gives us the opportunity every day every moment he gives us the momentum that we are doing our part pastor my mother got sick the first time he said i never would have come to this with without this happening to my wife because it got me to to dig just what he thought but uh just to dig anywhere dig into the scriptures to dig into what god was trying to show him what happened he began to exercise more and more i don't know about you but i'm hot it's hot up are you hot brother all right together if two cannot if two can agree oh yeah that feels a little bit better all right let's continue here how many are with me this morning watch how luke writes it jesus is telling them what's going to happen luke 18. lucas di verse 31 and he took unto them the 12. said we go up to jerusalem and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the son of man shall be accomplished every detail for he shall be delivered unto the gentiles that was the romans right he shall be mocked spitefully untreated and spit it on incarnate and they shall scourge him scorch him and they understood none of these things and this thing was hid from them neither knew they the things which were spoken but i want to tell you this morning that every time that jesus shows up it's for a reason i don't know about you but i'm going to say every time he shows up there's a purpose behind it and the purpose is a day of reckoning it is a day of reckoning judges your finale but a day of reckoning is the time and every opportunity that god gives opportunity can you make those things right now watch where we're going this now that's why we're here today what is this this is a day of reckoning judgment begins at the house of god we are here and god has given us by his grace day of stand there that we gather uh and how can we catch from here when we should be over there we're here account for the darcuintas it's to consider the considered paul in romans 8 18 pablo and romano's says for i reckon that the sufferings of this present are not time to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in other words paul is telling us after taking inventory doing the accounting come to the conclusion you can't even compare them with the glory that shall be revealed in us praise god there's no comparison right [Applause] that's why that's what fellowship is for foreign to remind one another encourage one another my goodness i'm going to tell you what a day of reckoning when it comes what it's for well a day of reckoning is a day to account it's a day to see what we have neglected [Music] what do we neglect every day of our lives jesus the word comes on the scene what are we neglecting whenever we give time to something we're neglecting something else let's see where we're going now with this now to neglect means to be careless negligent to pay little or no attention to something scripture speaks about we know that we're living at the end time with con watch what brother braham says hebrews chapter two we're living at the end time with vivi we're not by ourselves we are with the same jesus [Music] the same what we did with the son of god [Music] it's so easy for christians is cristianos to become dilatory slow to act that's the easiest thing just neglecting to pray oh my god we neglect so great of salvation we neglected to pray we neglect to testify neglecting to do what's right in i said look we didn't do that we're neglecting that in other words we're we're careless about the word we're careless about our experiences with god did you know that there are two things that keep satan or that keeps satan from being cast out of our lives that's right i just can't seem to get over it would you get my get this brother i've asked the lord check yourself are there unconventions high picadosa something that you have neglected wow two things or neglecting what you're supposed to be doing what causes more separations in families than anything else neglect of love negligence that's right i guess you don't that's really good it's okay still got to preach on i can play color bananas you gotta love everybody that's right what causes separations in the church because iglesia neglect of love that's right a great servant of the lord el senor once made this statement there are three things that can keep me out of the rapture that said this that i neglect number two that i neglected my family and number three that i neglected myself that's right amen oh my god this is getting real now huh this is not skim milk no more this is once again elect the church definitely my family familiar and neglected myself that's right that's right those are hard things how shall we escape if we neglect that brother brown stops we neglect you're going to rest if you need leg to milk the cow she's going to go dry he said if you neglect your teeth [Applause] we'll pay for our negligence if our teeth fall out that don't mean we're going to miss the rapture because we need to collect them no we're just going to have to deal with it but why did it happen in the first place oh my goodness that's right oh i don't know if you're going to like this last part he says all branham tabernacle and you visitors let me tell you something if you neglect to testify of the glory of god you neglect to give god the praise of the glory find yourself cold backslidden one of these days [Laughter] [Applause] we have neglected ourselves we have neglected our bodies our spirit our soul that time and that's why we come to the lord lord heal me send your son to me lord heal me then your son give me the faith to be to be to get the healing when we find ourselves backslidden that's what the day of reckoning is foreign a day of reckoning where we have been negligent why am i in this condition don't notice this now when when we see this still with me we want to finish this this morning when the day arrives that's the day of reckoning for neglecting your teeth we're like oh just stay strong okay stay strong keep you strong the day of reckoning is when the teeth fall out and then he's like too late now you don't get a neck n another set of teeth no no you're little but not when you're big the day arrives and then we act surprised oh pinch yourself this morning part of the message this morning when the day arrives we act surprised i didn't know yeah you remember you remember the pastor the minister you remember the message you remember what the scripture says you neglected it but now you're in this condition and you're crying out help me pray that there's still mercy you'll give mercy i'm not taking it one side or the other watch the neglect it's not oh lord why am i going through this noise that god lets you go through sometimes and all that and then we finally come back it's the path you choose yes it was your choice you remember the day that you had that you were able to choose it's not god putting us through many of those things but the day of reckoning shows what we have neglected but i pray that that we get our our judgment now what we have elected now because we think it's all spiritual the bible says you are the temple of the holy ghost yes or yes you'll see am i talking to anybody how many here are the temple of the holy ghost if we are the temple of the holy ghost then you gotta present your my blood pressure was starting to go up we started getting those blood pressures headaches i started having just i just feeling bad no strength nothing no energy for nothing here i say oh lord it's easy to say oh lord why am i in this condition and then we answer ourselves because you neglect yourself because everywhere you go you want to sit down with everybody what point do you do you say okay i i gotta put the brakes on a little bit we don't want to hurt nobody's feelings then neglect yourself oh my wow god didn't come and say oh for you okay come here come here me huh i'm going to pray for you yeah i'll heal you and then be honest why didn't you just come to church and have the ministry pray for you minister why so i can go back home and eat all the chocolate cake i still want but so uh i can go and just eat eat all the fried foods that i want but it is a good comment do i want god to heal me he never put me in this condition i neglected myself [Music] the is you age faster yeah there's you got to deal with a lot of things but many times we bring on ourselves why would i ask for prayer and then go do the same thing so that in one or two years i come back again i got high blood pressure again what did i do to change that case come on church i'm speaking to all of you what did i do to change it okay i finally got fed up with it i got fed i've been running [Music] i chose [Music] but our body can't [Applause] that god heals me because you'll pray for me brother that god will take away these habits that's right that's right hello everybody hold up oh to pray that the lord just takes this at this this demon have it away from me you know what i'm going to pray for obedience i'm going to pray for obedience for myself to be obedient to the word we can be obedient to the world those things will not stay permanent amen am i heading home today i think i better stop today oh my brother henry was telling of a message telling me of a message that our founding pastor had preached if i get to something wrong you tell me brother henry he said many times we say i'm not claiming this sickness but once it's if you don't if you don't look him straight in the eyes every day is a day of reckoning did you know that you might be able to fight certain devils this is why we can fight something okay you find out how to fight that company but there as you go as we go up the bride begins to go up principalities become harder less now you're not dealing with just these little things in church it's the greater things is that right yes that's right but the higher we go up better [Applause] is simply god revealing himself the more he reveals himself i hope that you get this morning i'm going to say it again the more that he reveals himself to you through you the greater your worship becomes granted greater worship is not the more you jump and shout out he is in uganda from what i understand to this point and had not accepted the message but we're working on him he sent me some videos and there man they're going in church and they're just jumping up and down going crazy and then it's what do you think and i just write back i said let's start here let's start in baptism in bautista how do you baptize how were you baptized come about this and how do you baptize the people come on father's unholy ghost okay let me tell you how to correctly baptize people i began to write to him he says brother that's the truth proved it by the scripture i said okay there's more to it just the beginning okay like i said nothing wrong with doing those things but remember god is in his word the more we exercise ourselves in the words the more we know him muslim and the more we know him the greater the worship that's why many people's worship doesn't grow understanding of him that's why church becomes monotonous to people if every day you could grow a little bit more find out a little bit more a little bit more your worship is never the same i think i better quit no no oh my i don't know how long i've been going but my goodness keep on going i think that clock is lying to us it is i like that that's right once again i'm i'm going to start to close but but let me just let me just get some these last few points we are negligent people dad goes off to work mom goes off to work the children stay home who suffers why foreign because mom and dad wanted to provide nice things financially give them the best of everything and when it all comes down to it i'm telling you the truth is one of the greatest things that i've ever seen in my life raising us yes we were never neglected growing up giving you my testimony it's my heart we were never neglected now maybe you say woman all i was brother your brother is grace he brought you yo we see the consequences a neglected child [Music] knowing that he was neglected we have we gave him everything i don't know why they're complaining there's a roof oh my goodness the children are grown up okay let me stop working one day closely one day i made cuentas because i i was pastoring the church i had four or five different businesses and i neglected my own family oh and i would throw those businesses in a heartbeat again if i had to do it again to give time that's the thing we neglected a husband most next to the wife and wonders why the wife is mad at him it doesn't give time no no no nothing my wife neglects the husband that's supposed to be he never has food for him never does the duties of a wife no wonder he's upset [Applause] oh i'm going to take you for for i'm going to take here your kid i'm going to take you out for let's go me and you let's go for a ride okay this is all we do here put this lollipop in your mouth and then be quiet heart he lent to the corazon believe all that the prophets have spoken it's all laid out in the message i'm a single mom god knows that god knows those things that's what his grace and mercy does it brings us through those things so grateful this morning church i'm telling you guys that he gives us a day this is a day of reckoning today doing what we're doing neglecting the ones that are around us neglect one another the love that each one needs and yet we look at our children we say well i was with them they seemed to give them time and our mind is somewhere else when we're with them watching movies absolutely nothing wrong with we do all those things someone say games and have fun with it funny with each other but the things of god are we teaching them to observe all things and the question is this when the time of reckoning comes when your children leave your home go to college they go out somewhere else a a video of a church service here a couple of years ago and as it was panned in the audience this young person is no longer here no longer here this one is no longer here this person doesn't come this person that we could have done i wish i could have given you a another message today that made you real happy how do we neglect some greater salvation we neglect the plan of salvation we neglect our bodies our spirits our souls speak to yes let us not neglect this so greatest salvation is first timothy 4 14 says neglect not
