but we can if we can just just to go as long as the holy spirit leads us and then um we won't have an evening service give you some time to to go for those that you want to go out or wherever you may go but we know that there's there's a lot of people that are out this morning god bless them wherever they may be on the stage those that are on hookup wherever you may be god bless you all wonderful to have you with us to be like jesus number 16 and i'd like to put a subtitle to it the nazarite amen hebrews 13 8 you can turn to it pray that it is a blessing to you and that the lord helps us to grasp this amen we know it by heart we can all say it can you can you read it together with me jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen amen god bless you you may be seated amen the nazirite my i i thought i understood it a little bit but um lord knows we have what we need we have need of it how many here have ever made a vow or a promise let me see your hands make sure that that everybody you guys never make made a vow or promise you make a vow or a promise and uh my question is how many have ever made a vow or a promise and not kept it juantos guardado now that's that's pretty much everybody how many here have not at one point or another in their life have not kept devourer that's better okay i raised my hand too i think that we are all guilty my question is how many of you have made a vow and have kept it okay yeah i i think that i pray we all have also we live in a day where where not too many people keep their promises anymore everybody know that true somebody can tell you something today and tomorrow they forget what they told you oh they'll say i i didn't say that i didn't mean that there's always an excuse or a reason they people justify themselves and the majority of the time they cannot keep the promises either when we get into a bind now let's bring it a little closer whenever we get into a bind or something goes wrong in our life that's usually the time that we make the most promises yes or yes coc lord senor now i i know i'm not the only one jose there's a video that somebody had sent me a video and it shows a a a young a young man taking a lamb out of a a of a ditch we make so many promises to the lord because as human beings we're always looking to see what is don't misunderstand an unconditional covenant because even an unconditional covenant has conditions jesus said you continue in my when god made an unconditional covenant with abraham you can turn into matthew the fifth chapter the 33rd verse it simply tells us here it's implemented again ye have heard that it has been said by them of all time thou shalt not forswear thyself but shalt perform unto the lord thine oaths the anybody here know what perjury is one or two people who know those personas nobody three four few few people okay make sure you exercise your arms today get some answers here perjury is simply to make a a false statement under and the bible tells us here it is thou shalt not make it says thou shalt not forswear thyself this is not us the scripture is trying to tell us don't make false statements and not tell the lord you're going to do something don't even tell your brother you're going to do something mm-hmm the scripture is saying don't make false statements but perform unto the lord thy oath verse 34 says but i say unto you swear not at all neither by heaven for it is god's throne or by the earth for it is its footstool neither by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king. neither shalt swear by thy head because thou canst not make one hair white or black this morning i want you to get all these points can i have your uh your undivided attention all right follow me very closely i believe it'll be a help to you the first thing that we must establish in a nazarite vow what it is and the purpose for which it is made it's not just to say i'm going to make a vow no no there's a purpose behind it and this purpose is sacred yesterday something that many people don't know about today very hard to find people that that that that reverence the things of the lord let's find out in number six what was required for one to keep the vowel look amen and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when either a man or woman shall separate themselves i want you to notice this here there's something that we got to do and the first thing we do is we got to separate ourselves i want you to tell your neighbors a neighbor he shall separate himself from wine and strong drinks i shall drink no vinegar of wine or vinegar neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes nor eat moist grapes or dried grapes raisins right okay he separateth himself unto the lord he shall be holy and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow all the days that he separateth himself unto the lord he shall come at no dead body right here an israelite who has taken us the needle we we we saw three things you abstain from eating or drinking anything from the vines no razor upon their head those were the three things of a nazarite vow these were the conditions of this particular vowel our our spiritual caps this morning was to separate themselves from all the world was to separate themselves from all the world but it was not just to separate from the world and this is what really brings another dimension to the nazareth god yeah you get that and what do you understand had people they stopped doing this or that they separate from this they separate from this group and they separate from that but but when it's all said and done the question is what have they keep that in mind because we're going to need that you didn't take a nazarite vow just so that you could separate or that could die out so that we could be quick into something else now watch this now one cannot unite with something or someone but unless first they are separated from something or someone else and it's not just to separate from something you know but it's to separate to something i'm going to get so that you can just dress differently or you can look different or just for the sake of being different why do your young girls wear long long dresses and have their hair long serviced is it just to be different from everybody if that's the case yes you'll miss something somewhere else well i do because my mom and dad tell me you are called to join yourself to the word but you can't unless you've separated from the world is one that is consecrated to a specific age is oh unto the lord what a nice thing that would be i tell you it's not only possible no solo is possible but it's necessary necessarily who's the first what's the first character that comes into your mind when you hear azeroth just just let the young people okay i know some of you want to say it young people openness anyone at any time you can go ahead and say it he's probably even though many many people did the nazarite but samson is probably the one that was that we think of right away amen amen now now when we see this we all know the story very well you all know the story of samson very much you all very well okay want to make sure if not we'll go over the story again brother branham said in the message of wedding supper he said samson was a type of the holy ghost church keep that in mind now though the church is a woman it is also typified as a son typically we're getting this foundation done now and the lords of the philistines came up unto her this is delilah this is dalilah and said unto her entice him that sounds like the serpent and eva he doesn't change his way but entice him and see wherein his great strength lieth information and by what means may we prevail against him that we may bind him to afflict him and we will give the every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver [Music] i and that secret is what we heard brother fabio preach the other day secretary it really makes a lot of sense after a while he's after secrets valuable information information it's stored in safe and he wants to get to your information now there's a lot coming in there's a lot coming up he knows or he wants to know he don't care where you go to church you don't care how long you've been going to church the power of a vow no longer because i didn't like the face but i don't go talk to him then the next time i say brother henry i'm going to do this there's no trust there's no power there there's no connection there when i say something is knows the power [Music] make you see so many things going on i was talking with brother jerry jerry gonzalez he's helping me out here he's a specialist in his field especially and he knows about computers about attacks and those of you that that read the so that the so many different companies and it says it's a type of a malicious software yes designed to block access to a computer system and they keep it blocked and they'll say you want your files pay us ten million dollars for the companies that's right come on take it to the spiritual network there are things that the enemy is doing now what it does is it encrypts the victim's files [Music] it's the same as when i'm trying to make it in a way that you all understand he takes your files and he holds them hostage he's waiting for us unless a ransom is paid of your identity out of it until you pay it yes like you say they won't release it oh this ransomware is just a little bit i'm just going to tell you a little bit so let me tell you what's going on in my life the next thing you know it you don't talk to that person no more that person knows everything about you yes and now they start to blackmail you and now they start to tell others about you and then we're in the middle of this drama we don't know what to do we forget our promises we forget everything but then when he has you know then once the email is open a file is downloaded so hacked and how to get out of that condition it's hard deficiency because a lot of times you lose data it's called for us amnesia is think about everything that you do young people in the digital world what oh my now watch this this is this is this is where we live and everywhere we go in the digital and cyber worlds back to you because everywhere you search everywhere you go online come on church come on young people are you with me can i get a there you go that's right this is correct think about this everything that you desire or your interests can be found just by going and seeing what you've been searching i came to church and i repented come on church we got to close up all these entrances he knows how to get into it what good is it if your computer files once in a while and throw out the trash so true huh you ever talked to somebody oh i knew them when they were young they've already grown up never hurt somebody i knew them 30 years ago i don't know what kind of people they are you give them a chance maybe the lord touched him in 30 years i remember we argued about this trash out this morning let's get let's go on continue i want to stay there what the enemy wants is one thing he wants to see where your strength lies say it again to them gave he power to become sons of god watch what brother branham says in the message of preparation but there's a mystery he said once again the holy ghost church and there's a mystery and if he types the church then there is a mystery about you are you mistaken tell your neighbor neighbor casino there's a mystery there's a mystery about you are you mysterious and satan don't want you to find out that's why there's such got to find out what the mystery is in your life without a new birth you see that you'll never understand that now now watch us now there's a mystery about samson you mistake yourself you want to know the estimation my estimation about him brother graham says something was a little bitty curly headed shrimp samson mystery huh give me steady you say he picked up these doors no that wasn't samson brother branham says he was he was maybe he said possible you look about five feet huh there taking off the source of his power and we're just church members it looks like it's almost memorable we go to church and all that's wonderful you gotta do those things the most powerful that would be that would be such a sight to see huh what are these days or when brother branham meets up with samson but the manufacturing yes wow now watch this now it's a mystery and he was that until the spirit of the lord got a hold of him you say brother are you not afraid of things there are things we're all human beings but when the holy spirit comes upon the person and takes control of my memories come on church i'm going to say it again first thing that he would do hey reach back is god seeing my luck okay they're still there okay come on now think about this for a moment as he as the spirit [Applause] and a lock is not keeps a mystery his parents and make sure the locks were still there can you imagine the power that went through samson's identified man that's born of the holy spirit to fill the power of god and know that it's the covenant to slay the enemy before you watch when he says oh [Music] how could he be so sure but that but watch this now three and i don't want to go because then it'll take me too much time the the three things that he told her and then it brought him to the fourth which was to shave the locks this is what samson said in verse 20. they said the philistines be upon you samson and he awoke out of his sleep and said i will go out at the other times before we go and live any kind of life he's a good god he's a gracious god i'll go to church i'll go to the office raise my hands up and then i'll shake myself and it'll be like every other time that i did when i went to church no big deal the presence of the lord because the presence of [Applause] sometimes worse i the lord had departed from him as long as god can see those seven locks he sees his promise oh yes he's obligated to his words the world has shaved off your peculiarness until you have become one of them that you can't tell the difference between a so-called christian and a worldly personality what the world has done but the world shaved yours now you're just as starchy as the rest of it nothing moves you nothing starchy and when the church begins to keep company with the world company then it's no more than the world it gets out of fellowship with the holy spirit oh when did the church start flirting when he began to try to pattern itself after the world park you see the successes that the world can offer we've never been ordained of god to try to keep in step with the world after the day of pentecost the church fell at night when they were wooed by the enemy but one day he was blind church they were blind the dark ages preaches the message but just one more time [Applause] and i'm gonna tell you every one of you understand when the message came to us let the enemy shave your hair it's it's just antiques yeah that old fashion is what's going to take us home [Applause] i didn't expect a great response about that but i ain't stopping they don't know what yeah that's why the [Applause] church he gave us seven eyes which are the seven messengers i'm going to get to that in a moment those seven eyes are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth he doesn't mess with you when the power of [Music] and take what jesus christ the healer tuberculosis crippled whatever it is you just take the promise of god the word and say i believe it hallelujah by hearing and hearing god looks down and sees the promise it was time i can see john weeping it looks like the church of the living god with its head to power again we're turning this corner he knows his dirty hands can't handle it it's the title deep book of redemption hacking your files to you from that of god in your life watch this now are you still with me okay we're getting to the meat of it now watch now no man in heaven or earth or beneath the earth [Music] [Music] ah getting the right note again watch this now when we see this remember it was those seven locks that held the secret of his strength and behind those seven seals was the secret of the church hallelujah six seals was the plan of redemption in its fullness thought he had it [Music] what happened somebody shaved your locks lose [Applause] and this nazirite was not just in the old testament paul was also pablo brother matt branham says you say amanda branham god's it wasn't paul's group it was paul grupo accepted or received his message separated but when it me god has always sent forth his prophet and through the ministry of the son of man jesus christ being the son of man revealing through us son of man the prophet came on the separated from everything else to obey the you drink or smoke or defile your body in any way i have no work to do for you to do i didn't want to hurt them they were drinking they went on i wasn't supposed to all right and when the son of man was revealed again seven angels foreign edge shaving it down what happened to brother branham he was in the barbershop what did he get called that they spilled on him he says every one of those remember his products he's looking for a man established he's looking for someone so it's going to the people have pre-eminence finds a man from kentucky and when he does you put the lawyers on now they say that's why john you what is this one he began to shout the lamb took the book what was he doing he was taking the vessel the earth was a secret and i'm going to start to close now because i've been here a long time it's okay from the appearance of his loins even downward fire fuego and from his loins upward as the appearance of brightness as the color of amber aspect [Music] and brought than any because we are included i'm stopping with this and i got like three or four more things to say but then i'll say but i gotta i gotta get this please now watch this now this is so tremendous to me [Music] he says i will tell you by god's grace filling the seven locks this is the prophet of god saying this is the prophet but you're suffering from high blood pressure depression you have diabetes you have a nervous condition something's wrong with your head you've got a tumor you know it's death that's how it is god touches you let me lay hands on you the hammer he was separated from the world to the word he was vow to us because i will come into here [Applause] in the i gotta find this last part because it's so good he separates us that's okay i can't find it but i'll i'll just read read right here he separates separa what is he doing showing who's his and that kingdom of god is is the word made into power so many people i have the i have the word but is it is it made into place or is it just a letter now i i stopped with this okay because i there's too much and i i i ask your forgiveness for keeping you long i don't ask but i want to do this last thing this last drama and give me your attention this is good stuff and i believe it'll help you come here my brother don't come up here he calls his word calls for a total separation this is our brother estes nuestro but there's a mystery inside of him that is dying to come out yes give me a chance today just give me a chance to give you one opportunity now how many have you ever seen the picture of brother branham and i would show it to you but it's too washed out it it won't come out very much but if you have it go home and see this picture it's a picture of brother jackson from south africa it looks like you know what that is that's my old name it's tremendous to me it's just tremendous he says you see then when the day that the holy spirit came it burns out the old nature and then many times brother says and that old nature dies it burns out the old thinks he still has dominion he has no dominion over you but he's acting like he does remember what you used to do remember those promises you made oh that's a news flash this is nature can do nothing nothing against me that is born of god still if you're not committed no way for the seed dwells inside of us if i could go into the message and tell you go into what those locks more i'm asking you the speedo and he's asking you one more time say lord just once i have failed lord in some ways i've not kept promises that i've i promise you i've not kept promises with my children but i promise if you say brother would you pray with
