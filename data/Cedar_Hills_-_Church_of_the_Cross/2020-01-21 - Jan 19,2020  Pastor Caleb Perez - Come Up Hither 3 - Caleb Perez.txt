Ellison pequeno video I all are maiden you can't play the rules of the game of life wrong and expect to win you've got to play according to God's Word amen and the purpose that you were brought here for now there is so many people that doesn't seem to have any kind of a purpose in life especially in this day that we now live people just seem to think that all they have to do is to keep up with somebody else with the fashions of the world and with the enticements that the world has given to things just like this if you go to school and some of the new girls wear a certain loose strocker dress or whatever you would call it all the ambition the rest of school has is the pattern after that girl some of the women see on the television some certain lady come out dressed in a certain fashion well that's their ambition is to dress and act like that [Music] and that seems to be just about the limit of the American ambition is to get a new job or to get a raise in your salary and to get a television or a new car let me say this those things may be all right but there's higher ambitions in the human life than those things and Christian should set their affection on higher ambition I think it would pay us all to sit down and wonder why we are here in the first place and who was kind enough to bring us here we are two considered and asked him what he would have us to do the purpose of us coming to fulfill what he has purpose for us but we seem to be just wanting to keep up with the world now the Bible said that we can overcome the world and how do we do it Papa keeping up with the fashions of the world but the Bible said that faith is the victory that overcomes the world [Music] amen faith is our victory a man faced and as we read God's Word this morning supporting
