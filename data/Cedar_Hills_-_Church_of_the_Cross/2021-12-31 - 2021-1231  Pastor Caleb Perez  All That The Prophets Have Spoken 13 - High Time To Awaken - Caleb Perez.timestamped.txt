[25:41] [Music]
[26:00] may god bless you this evening
[26:05] just real quick we're going to turn to
[26:07] the to the book of genesis
[26:12] chapter one and verse one capital uno
[26:16] uno
[26:17] we're just going to read that first part
[26:18] and it says in the beginning
[26:29] [Music]
[26:53] and sometimes we feel like we're like
[26:55] maybe we we could do better this coming
[26:57] year
[27:01] and a lot of times people come up and
[27:03] they and they have this this thing of
[27:05] i'm going to lose weight this year
[27:10] i have a new year's resolution i'm going
[27:12] to do this or that
[27:16] but this morning i got up and i read
[27:18] this
[27:46] and usually by january 7th all of a
[27:48] sudden we have this one
[27:52] why why we can't do it
[27:55] because we don't have time
[27:58] because we don't have this or that
[28:00] but i
[28:13] it starts by us relying on the almighty
[28:16] god
[28:21] knowing that he who has started working
[28:25] on the same god
[29:04] all of a sudden forgot to do what would
[29:06] create something of one of the of those
[29:08] six days
[29:38] in the book of psalms
[29:52] nor standeth in the way of sinners
[30:02] but his life
[30:05] now is your delight on the things of god
[30:13] of the lord
[30:19] day and night
[30:33] and he shall be like the trees
[30:37] planted by the rivers of water
[30:41] that bringeth forth his fruit in his
[30:44] season
[30:47] his leaf gets
[31:01] that if we could put away all the
[31:03] worldly things
[31:07] all of our worldly ideas
[31:10] put god first in our life
[31:15] at the beginning of everything we do
[31:20] i believe we'll see god
[31:24] create a new earth
[31:27] create something brand new
[31:31] that we wouldn't be complaining about
[31:33] what happened yet last year
[31:38] the bible tells us
[31:43] the blessings followed us
[31:47] it's not us too up to us to dwell on
[31:49] what happened
[31:54] to us
[31:57] god is moving us
[32:55] right now
[32:57] the new beginning
[33:00] i'm a new person
[33:08] but
[33:35] that he could finish the
[33:50] day
[33:53] if paul had the mindset see pablo
[33:57] he wanted to preach the gospel in rome
[34:03] but if paul perot
[34:17] we wouldn't have had the gospel
[34:19] according to
[34:20] the apostle paul
[34:26] but paul had the right attitude
[34:32] he found himself in prison saying
[34:34] control
[34:35] in rome in roma and i don't know if you
[34:38] know this you know
[34:40] but every single day
[34:43] for 12-hour shifts
[34:46] one
[35:42] to restore
[36:37] it's so much bigger it's better than
[37:07] [Music]
[37:19] if you would come and give us some words
[37:23] god
[37:25] [Applause]
[38:03] the 15th chapter of the book of luke
[38:08] prepare
[38:10] verse 11.
[38:23] and we're going to read it in the name
[38:24] of the lord jesus christ
[38:29] and he said
[38:44] and the younger of them said unto his
[38:46] father
[38:47] father give me the portion of goods that
[38:50] followed to me
[38:51] and he divided unto them his living
[38:56] no muchos diaz di so
[39:04] and not many days after the younger son
[39:06] gathered all together and took his
[39:07] journey into a far country and there
[39:10] wasted his substance with
[39:12] righteous living
[39:17] and when he had spent all there arose a
[39:19] mighty famine
[39:37] [Music]
[39:45] and he went and joined himself to a
[39:47] citizen of that country and he sent him
[39:49] into the his fields to feed swine
[39:58] and he would
[40:00] feign had
[40:01] and he would feign have filled his belly
[40:03] with
[40:04] the husks and that the swine did eat and
[40:07] no man gave unto him
[40:19] and when he came to himself he said
[40:22] how many higher servants of my fathers
[40:25] have bread enough to spare and i perish
[40:28] with hunger
[40:33] epic
[40:36] i will arise and go to my father and
[40:38] will say unto him father i have sinned
[40:41] against heaven and before thee.
[40:49] and i'm no more worthy to be called thy
[40:51] son
[40:52] make me as one of thy hired servants
[41:05] and he arose and came to his father but
[41:08] when he was yet great way of his father
[41:11] saw him and had compassion and ran and
[41:14] fell on his neck and kissed him amen
[41:17] amen you may be seated um
[41:27] we just we're going to talk about the
[41:28] story and many maybe know it oh
[41:34] but
[41:35] maybe many don't know what it is to work
[41:37] with swine
[41:40] come on
[41:46] and when i was younger about 18 years
[41:48] old i had the opportunity to work with
[41:50] about three thousand swine
[41:52] no it's fosse
[41:54] it's not easy
[42:02] and you know a few days ago i was
[42:04] thinking about this
[42:08] and i thought why is wine
[42:10] okay
[42:14] when
[42:18] i believe that god lets
[42:19] people go to certain things work in
[42:21] certain things so that you know when
[42:24] they so that when they go through these
[42:25] things they can know what the scripture
[42:26] is talking about
[42:28] um
[42:41] the reason why he wanted to leave he
[42:44] says
[42:48] just because he began to hang around
[42:50] with people that he shouldn't have
[42:52] proven
[42:55] the prophet says that he was a young man
[43:01] that he was instructed in the word of
[43:03] god or on the council of god
[43:06] but he began to hear a personas
[43:10] people
[43:11] that he should not have been listening
[43:15] so therefore uh youth
[43:19] it's not a scolding
[43:21] but it is a as a council
[43:23] establishment
[43:38] in this condition
[43:42] the prophet says
[43:46] that the father of this young man
[43:51] the prophet says i can be i begin i can
[43:53] begin to see him
[43:57] the how the god will put a
[44:00] signs
[44:02] uh for sale signs
[44:05] and the oh la casa he sold the house
[44:09] he sold his his barn
[44:13] and he got all of the money
[44:16] and he
[44:17] divided it
[44:20] and it says
[44:29] and he uh wrongfully has spent all the
[44:31] money that the father have given them
[44:34] but one
[44:50] and he was wanting to eat the food of
[44:52] the swine no poliah he couldn't do it
[44:57] but when you see the scriptures
[45:03] but the scripture says when he came to
[45:05] himself
[45:11] the prophet says that the reason why he
[45:12] came to himself
[45:18] was because he had a father and a mother
[45:20] that was praying for him
[45:28] what a responsibility
[45:43] causing the same problem
[45:58] there are still fathers that pray for
[46:00] their children
[46:06] us
[46:12] you're not going to go and eat a uh
[46:14] swine feed
[46:16] fedor
[46:17] you wouldn't do it
[46:22] but this man was so lost
[46:26] he had lost his
[46:43] the prophet says that his parents would
[46:45] wake up every morning to pray for their
[46:47] son
[47:03] this elderly
[47:04] father was was looking sitting on his
[47:06] porch and he was looking
[47:08] looking into the hills
[47:11] when all of a sudden
[47:15] he saw a shadow that was coming
[47:22] and he arose
[47:24] he goes
[47:26] and he said oh my son
[47:35] god hears our prayers
[47:45] that father here rose
[47:48] and he went running
[48:04] she was a mother was praying for him
[48:10] what is our attitude
[48:14] maybe those that have gone on that have
[48:16] left
[48:18] us

[49:00] is
[49:15] lord i have friends i have left

[49:44] on the road
[49:46] he was lost that was in his parents he
[49:48] was without hope
[49:53] lord but there was people that were
[49:55] praying for him
[50:10] you lord maybe they have departed thy
[50:12] ways
[50:14] why is he in estonia

[1:15:18] two weeks later i don't feel like
[1:15:20] getting up
[1:15:29] that's the way to say it throwing in the
[1:15:31] towel

[1:15:43] going to i'm going to really get to
[1:15:45] reading my bible
[1:15:50] and then life kicks us in the teeth
[1:15:55] and because many times we're not
[1:15:56] disciplined enough
[1:15:59] what do we do
[1:16:00] we fall back
[1:16:04] how many been out there four-wheel

[1:16:08] yeah
[1:16:09] and you're going down the road and
[1:16:10] there's these tracks right
[1:16:13] and then it gets pretty rough and then
[1:16:14] you kind of try it well i'm going to go
[1:16:15] off a little bit
[1:17:00] that is
[1:17:14] but we think we

[1:20:46] sidelines watching the fight
[1:20:51] no as long as i got a good job
[1:20:54] then i went through all the money
[1:20:56] i don't have to deal with nothing else
[1:20:58] don't
[1:21:26] start
[1:21:40] coaster
[1:21:41] after a while you're just like what's

[1:21:51] okay okay i want to make sure
[1:21:54] we get so tired of the roller coaster
[1:21:55] ride
[1:21:59] but what are we really tired
[1:22:04] paul says i have fought a good fight
[1:22:07] but i stopped to think about it because
[1:22:09] i see everybody is affected by it
[1:22:14] what is it what is it that tires us so
[1:22:16] much
[1:22:19] and then comes the answer
[1:22:21] dealing with the same situation over and
[1:22:24] over and over and over and over and over
[1:22:26] and over again
[1:22:30] hires us more than anything else
[1:22:33] that's so much the fighting
[1:22:36] if we
[1:22:54] [Music]
[1:23:17] why didn't it die out with last year
[1:23:21] am i talking to anybody
[1:23:24] i got to look in the mirror and ask
[1:23:25] myself these questions
[1:23:28] why am i still carrying this from last
[1:23:30] year
[1:23:32] you died
[1:23:35] i told somebody the other day i said
[1:23:37] that that's what what tire's a pastor
[1:23:41] when you tell the people to do a certain
[1:23:43] thing
[1:23:45] and instead they trust in the man
[1:23:51] but yet there are those
[1:23:54] that recognize the god that's in the man
[1:23:59] that's there
[1:24:10] and i said lord
[1:24:12] day after day
[1:24:14] i see the people
[1:25:10] check your socials
[1:25:13] [Music]
[1:25:23] did you all just leave
[1:25:26] what are you all still here oh yes
[1:25:29] that's like the most touchy subject of
[1:25:31] anybody
[1:25:34] the christian's walk is based on rest
[1:25:38] how many of you
[1:25:52] high
[1:26:05] there's no other place to rest but in
[1:26:07] christ
[1:26:10] so i asked the question
[1:26:14] then why are we so tired
[1:26:18] what gets us
[1:26:20] more tired as the days go by
[1:26:26] this is the word that he gave me
[1:26:34] with the
[1:26:56] are you are you with me
[1:26:58] come on there's two different things
[1:27:00] when you're dealing with something
[1:27:16] keep dealing with
[1:27:31] trying to change this and change that
[1:27:34] that's many people most people nowadays
[1:27:39] it's frustrating
[1:27:42] to cope
[1:27:44] with people nowadays
[1:27:49] anybody have have businesses
[1:27:53] it's frustrating
[1:27:56] [Music]

[1:28:00] it's frustrating to cope with people
[1:28:03] not dealing with them because
[1:28:05] they have their own mind
[1:28:11] it's frustrating to cope with situations
[1:28:14] it's
[1:28:16] it's frustrating
[1:28:18] to cope with situations
[1:28:21] with conditions
[1:28:23] that seem like they're never going to
[1:28:25] change
[1:28:52] if someone has ought against you go to
[1:28:54] them
[1:29:07] all the time

[1:29:21] it is
[1:29:35] [Applause]
[1:29:50] aside all these things

[1:29:55] after year after year
[1:29:59] let it go
[1:30:02] ask for forgiveness if you've wronged
[1:30:04] somebody
[1:30:35] to cope with the same thing all the time
[1:30:40] what does frustration show okay look at
[1:30:42] moisture does anybody here get
[1:30:43] frustrated

[1:31:40] many many are entering the new year
[1:31:42] tired and frustrated

[1:34:00] that's the greatest frustration that we
[1:34:02] have
[1:34:16] ourselves
[1:34:38] so we tell them
[1:34:40] apply the word to your problem
[1:34:42] applicable
[1:34:47] watch watch this though
[1:34:49] this is the holy spirit dealing with me

[1:35:35] can i apply the word
[1:35:39] to a problem
[1:35:41] if i don't apply the word to myself
[1:35:45] it's not the problem that needs the
[1:35:47] application of the word
[1:35:49] application
[1:35:52] of a word
[1:36:05] some magic tool or something like wow
[1:36:47] you don't have the confidence to apply
[1:36:49] the word to anything nothing else
[1:37:06] think about this
[1:37:09] who was it brother jerry i think it was
[1:37:10] that that preached to us about wolf

[1:48:55] again it is
[1:48:56] how many people are born again
[1:49:29] and that life is christ

[1:50:32] scripture on sunday

[1:50:40] moreover the word of the lord came unto
[1:50:42] me saying jeremiah
[1:50:45] is
[1:51:18] what do you understand
[1:51:20] he's asking jeremiah this what do you
[1:51:23] see what do you understand
[1:51:26] about what you see they look at this
[1:51:29] and he said
[1:51:31] i see a rod of an old alban
[1:51:38] oh
[1:51:41] i'm going to preach on sunday when the
[1:51:43] almond tree flourishes
[1:51:51] but i got to give you this to get you
[1:51:53] ready for it
[1:51:56] i see a rod
[1:51:57] of an almond tree
[1:52:00] you all know that the rod of aaron
[1:52:03] what kind of rod was it
[1:52:06] it was the rod of an almond
[1:52:09] branch right
[1:52:10] now it was from an almond tree
[1:52:12] watch this now what do you see for this
[1:52:14] year
[1:52:16] rod of an almond tree unavara del mendro
[1:52:19] is it dried up
[1:52:21] or has it blossomed and produced almonds
[1:52:23] oh yeah flores
[1:52:26] uh-oh
[1:52:27] what c is though
[1:52:29] watch what he said i see the rod of an
[1:52:30] almond tree
[1:52:32] the lord said unto me
[1:52:38] for i will hasten my word
[1:52:41] to perform it
[1:52:54] that the word and watch the way that the
[1:52:56] lord is putting this
[1:52:59] the word for almond tree la palabra
[1:53:01] almendro is chakel
[1:53:05] the word for hastening his word la
[1:53:07] palabra por presidente is
[1:53:37] if you could just get
[1:53:52] blossom or bloom
[1:53:55] flower that comes out
[1:53:58] the almond tree is the first tree that
[1:54:01] blossoms after winter
[1:54:20] it's
[1:54:30] i'm about to get into my message and
[1:54:32] then i really won't
[1:54:33] i really won't stop till about three in
[1:54:35] the morning
[1:54:37] watch this now it's awakening or
[1:54:40] arousing us out of
[1:54:43] sleep
[1:54:46] or out of dormancy
[1:54:51] he uses the same word us
[1:54:54] because it's the same cycle that you and
[1:54:56] i go through every year
[1:54:59] don't tell me you don't
[1:55:01] know as the pastor i know all your
[1:55:03] cycles
[1:55:06] are producing good
[1:55:09] i don't even hear from that person
[1:55:14] and then man
[1:55:20] [Music]
[1:55:26] but thank goodness that i understand
[1:55:29] cycles
[1:55:39] i better not go into the cycles
[1:55:42] watch this
[1:55:46] as ministers
[1:55:48] were good at motivating people
[1:55:51] don't get me wrong there's a good
[1:55:52] motivation
[1:55:56] but watch the difference now
[1:56:11] whatever i could do for any of you i
[1:56:12] would do whatever you put
[1:56:15] out to the ends of the world for any for
[1:56:17] all of you
[1:56:20] but if you came back from the ends of
[1:56:22] the world in the same condition what
[1:56:24] have i accomplished
[1:56:39] the only thing that i could do
[1:56:42] sister is pray for you
[1:56:47] then he goes
[1:56:48] or do something
[1:56:52] to arouse your faith
[1:57:36] isn't that
[1:57:51] the church
[1:57:54] we must be ready
[1:57:57] for today
[1:58:00] when i look at this
[1:58:02] oh
[1:58:03] i said lord help us
[1:58:15] but you know sometimes we have even that
[1:58:17] backwards
[1:58:21] is
[1:58:22] tremendous
[1:58:25] but it's sometimes misunderstood
[1:58:28] because we think sometimes that revival
[1:58:31] means to add more members to the church
[1:58:36] oh there's a revival going on in uganda
[1:58:39] in uganda
[1:58:41] they think that revival means to add new
[1:58:43] members
[1:58:47] no no
[1:58:50] adding you re adding new members
[1:58:54] is the results of the revival
[1:59:00] i like this one
[1:59:03] i'm going to say it again revival isn't
[1:59:06] added the members
[1:59:08] the adding of the members is the results
[1:59:10] that there was a revival
[1:59:14] but a revival is to revive what's
[1:59:16] already in the church
[1:59:20] come on church
[1:59:21] this revival in uganda
[1:59:25] was not to add more members in the
[1:59:27] church
[2:00:09] you and i must be the revival
[2:00:12] there is no revival without you and i
[2:00:14] know
[2:00:20] when we go through tribulations and
[2:00:22] trials
[2:00:50] we're trying to deal with things
[2:01:05] when the spring comes
[2:01:19] is
[2:01:34] it's the great
[2:01:36] awakening
[2:01:39] oh there have been great awakenings
[2:01:42] and that's why you have to rightly
[2:01:43] divide the world
[2:01:47] because you might sitting
[2:01:48] next
[2:02:03] yeah you're not awake
[2:02:07] okay
[2:02:09] i'm finishing now determined barely nine
[2:02:13] three hours
[2:02:30] has appeared to us
[2:02:33] the holy ghost
[2:02:35] and he's bringing us a message
[2:02:39] talking about the great awakening
[2:02:43] of righteousness is the message
[2:03:12] to speak forth
[2:03:14] great mysterious signs and wonders
[2:03:21] there is a great thing going to happen
[2:03:23] the people saying
[2:03:25] we've heard this many times pray pray
[2:03:29] pray pray
[2:03:34] he's not saying don't pray
[2:03:37] not what he's saying but why are they
[2:03:38] doing that
[2:03:40] because they want a
[2:04:08] you're talking
[2:04:22] candlesticks
[2:04:29] [Music]
[2:04:35] when the almond tree flourished

[2:04:47] of the bride
[2:04:49] by being christians they fill the pool
[2:04:52] of the hour
[2:04:55] but they haven't recognized
