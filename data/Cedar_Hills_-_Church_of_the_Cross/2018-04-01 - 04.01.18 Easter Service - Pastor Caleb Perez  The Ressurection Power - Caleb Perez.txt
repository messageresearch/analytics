to say uh before we get started what a glorious morning yesterday it's an honor and privilege to be here identify with our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to be identified with each one of you but he has done for us recently for me and my wife and our family is nothing short of miraculous he's uh sorry he's uh our cups were overflowing with joy I'm overwhelmed by his goodness his mercy His grace and we love him so much just as we love each and every one of you god bless you [Music] the moon and stars they wept the Morning Sun was dead the savior of the world was far his body on the his blood

King you have overcome the brain you have overcome [Music] we see hallelujah [Music] the [Music] we sing hallelujah waste [Music] hallelujah [Music] if there are words for him then I don't have them you see my brain has not used to point for the form of thought that could allocate describe the greatness of my God and my lungs have not yet developed the ability to release a breath with enough agility to read out the greatness of his love and my voice you see my voice is so inhibited restrained by human limits that it's hard to even send the praise up you see if there are words for him then I don't have them my god His grace is remarkable His mercies are innumerable strength is impenetrable he is honorable accountable favorable he is unsearchable yet knowable indefinable yet approachable indescribable yet personal he is behind comprehension further than imagination constant through generations king of every nation but if there are words for him then I don't have them you see my words are view and are trying to capture the one true God using my vocabulary would never do but I use words as an expression an expression of worship to a savior a savior who is birth worthy and deserving of his praise so I use words my heart extolled the Lord blesses his name forever he has won my heart captured my mind and has bound them both together he has defeated me in my rebellion conquered me in my sin he has welcomed me into his presence completely invited me in he has made the self the object of my sight flooded me with mercies in the morning drowning me with grace in the night but if there are words for him I don't have them but what I do have is good news for my god knew that Matt made words would never do that words are just tools that we use the point to the truth so he sent his son Jesus Christ as the word living proof here's the image of the invisible God the firstborn of all creation for by him all things were created giving nothingness formation and by his word he sustains and the power of his name for he is before all things and all things created holy is his name so praise him for his life the way he preserved in strife the humble son of God becoming the perfect sacrifice praise him for his death that he willingly stood in our place that he lovingly endured the grave that he battled our enemy and on the third day rose and victory he is everything that was promised praised as the risen King lift your voice in seeing for one day he'll return for us and we'll finally be United with him for eternity eternity so it's not just words that I proclaim for my words point to the word and the word has the name hope has a name joy has an peace has the name love has a name if that name is Jesus Christ praise His name forever [Music] it's glorified [Music] did [Music] for he is real [Music] forever he is glorified forever high forever He is risen he is alive [Music] Amen at this time we have in our sister Ruth he'll come forth to give her special to the
