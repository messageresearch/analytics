[12:39] house of Lord of the Lord again
[12:43] amen you get started you may be
[12:52] seated want to tell you a little bit
[12:54] about this song that I I happen to love
[12:59] and in short we could title it our
[13:02] prophet's favorite
[13:06] hymn the song down from his glory was W
[13:09] was written by William BL uh Booth
[13:12] cliborne who was born on August 3rd of
[13:16] 1893 and passed away of August 27th
[13:19] 1969 now in 1908 at the ripe age of 15
[13:23] years old his father took him to a
[13:26] growing group of Pentecostals holding
[13:27] meetings in London England
[13:29] the family had roots in the UK so he was
[13:32] able to persuade his son William to join
[13:35] him on the trip to the
[13:37] Revival arriving at the meetings both
[13:40] the father and the son were immediately
[13:43] attracted to what they were both seeing
[13:45] and
[13:46] hearing now it was there that they heard
[13:49] people speaking in
[13:50] [Music]
[13:56] tongues arriving at the meetings
[14:01] both Arthur the father and William the
[14:04] [Music]
[14:06] son were immediately attracted to what
[14:08] they were hearing and
[14:12] seeing for it was there that they first
[14:15] heard people speaking in
[14:20] tongues Arthur spoke eight languages
[14:25] Arthur and William already spoke five at
[14:28] the age of 15
[14:29] [Music]
[14:32] Willi but none of the languages that
[14:34] were being spoken that
[14:38] day were recognizable by either of
[14:43] them and on one of those
[14:46] nights in the continuous
[14:49] meetings William went to the Altar and
[14:52] there something
[14:55] happened and in his own words
[14:59] he said I found myself singing in a
[15:02] beautiful
[15:06] language entirely
[15:08] [Music]
[15:09] foreign its charm and surprising sounds
[15:12] saturated me with an Indescribable
[15:20] [Music]
[15:21] easy every sweet sentence fully and
[15:25] adequate adequately expressed the pent
[15:27] up feelings of my inflamed
[15:36] heart direct from the altar of my heart
[15:40] rising and surging burning Billows the
[15:43] most pleasing pleasing incense was
[15:45] reaching the
[15:55] throne a few years later in 1921
[16:01] William was 28 years
[16:04] old and had held a successful Tent
[16:07] Revival meeting south of Sacramento in a
[16:10] town called Loi
[16:19] California enthused by the results he
[16:22] decided he'd have more tent meetings a
[16:24] little more south in a place called
[16:26] Holtville
[16:30] [Music]
[16:33] in Holtville unfortunately heavy rains
[16:36] and low attendant literally quenched his
[16:45] Services being unable to pay for the
[16:48] cost of the field
[16:52] meetings William and his helpers found
[16:54] themselves working in a cornfield
[17:00] harvesting it to help settle their
[17:02] unpaid
[17:05] debts and it was there that he hit rock
[17:11] bottom but it was in the middle of those
[17:13] corn fields overtaken with
[17:19] self-pity the Lord began to deal with
[17:24] him and little did he know that the
[17:26] spirit of God would give him the words
[17:28] to one of the greatest hymns ever
[17:36] written a
[17:38] prophet our prophet in the message what
[17:41] think he of
[17:45] Christ preached in
[17:49] 1954 he says as you stand to your
[17:53] feet if you only knew the backgrounds
[17:56] for that song
[18:01] my friend composed that
[18:05] song boo cbor boo cbor in a cornfield
[18:09] one night with his elbows and on his
[18:12] knees out there in
[18:19] prayer God gave him this
[18:24] song I think it's one of the it's
[18:27] matchless for this day when the deity of
[18:30] Jesus Christ is denied by so many formal
[18:41] Believers that he was no more a
[18:46] man no more
[18:49] than just a
[18:52] prophet he
[18:54] was Emmanuel Emmanuel As we sing this
[18:57] song
[19:02] down
[19:03] from his
[19:09] glory ever

[44:16] gonna just give a little backstory to
[44:18] this
[44:22] song Amen uh this song I chose to sing
[44:30] it uh holds a very special place in my
[44:35] heart and it was uh one of my Grandma's
[44:39] favorite
[44:43] songs Victory in Jesus vict J amen it
[44:48] was written by Eugene M
[44:52] Bartlet Eugene M Bartlet amen it's and
[44:57] as I began to read on the
[45:01] author he began his career as a
[45:06] publisher and later formed the Hartford
[45:09] Music Company in
[45:13] 1918 he wrote songs such as everybody
[45:17] will be happy over
[45:23] there and just a little
[45:25] while he felt his calling to write
[45:31] hymns and to teach site
[45:37] reading he he would hold singing
[45:42] schools and uh singing
[45:46] conventions at the age of
[45:50] 53 he suffered a massive
[45:54] stroke that left him unable to speak
[45:59] and unable to
[46:01] walk many throughout many thought his
[46:06] ministry was
[46:08] over but in those
[46:12] times in those dark
[46:15] times that the Lord took him
[46:19] through he took him back to a
[46:23] time when he was born again and rich in
[46:26] life
[46:33] he begins to write this
[46:38] hymn realizing that the love of
[46:40] [Music]
[46:42] God had brought him to where he was at
[46:45] that
[46:48] moment as he wrote the last
[46:53] verse he says he could see the story of
[46:56] redeeming power
[47:01] from start to
[47:03] finish he would go on to complete it
[47:06] with the melody of happiness and
[47:13] enthusiasm I never had the opportunity
[47:15] to ask my grandmother why this song was
[47:17] so special to
[47:22] her but as I begin to to read this story
[47:29] the life of this
[47:31] author and began to see the life of my
[47:34] my
[47:37] grandma I
[47:40] understood that uh no matter what we're
[47:43] going through in
[47:46] life there's Victory in
[47:49] Jesus let's all stand and let's let's
[47:52] sing that song
