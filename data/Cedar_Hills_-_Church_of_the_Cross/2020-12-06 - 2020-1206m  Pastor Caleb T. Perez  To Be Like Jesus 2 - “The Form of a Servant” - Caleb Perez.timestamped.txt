[39:30] that i want to send to our brilliant
[39:33] who many times have stood with us in the
[39:36] gospel field
[39:37] my memory date back dates back
[39:42] right from 2017 when we for the first
[39:46] time

[39:57] neo mexico united states of america that
[40:00] was in may

[40:07] the church from cedar hills and i don't
[40:11] forget my brother
[40:12] tito from voice of truth
[40:16] tabernacle from then
[40:19] to this day we still have a lot more to
[40:24] keep pondering over what god has always
[40:26] been doing in this kind of unity that we
[40:28] developed
[40:30] many things have happened since then
[40:35] what we clearly know the translation
[40:38] work started
[40:40] the radio program started
[40:44] and
[40:48] much later when this incident of
[40:51] coronavirus also came
[40:54] you gave a lot of hands in terms of
[40:57] helping us
[41:02] this particular video clip is to
[41:05] make you realize one last thing that we
[41:08] have yet
[41:10] done which was yesterday
[41:14] we held a short meeting
[41:18] kind of a seminar
[41:21] in which they attracted over 200 people
[41:24] and all that came as a result of our
[41:27] announcement that we have always been
[41:29] running on the radio to have
[41:33] at least a day that we would meet
[41:36] it has been a very good meeting that we
[41:39] held yesterday
[41:43] in which we again baptized
[41:46] 13 more souls into the kingdom in the
[41:49] name of our lord jesus christ

[44:51] happy birthday
[45:13] amen amen god bless you would you stand
[45:16] to your feet and
[45:17] this opponent we're thankful for those
[45:19] those last three
[45:20] three uh young men that that uh
[45:23] that you saw
[45:27] they are the ones that are that are
[45:28] always printing
[45:30] every
[45:39] amen let's get right into the word if
[45:40] you would like your bibles
[45:44] be like jesus
[45:49] and as we continue this message
[45:52] remember the question that was asked
[45:54] last sunday
[45:57] are you jesus it is jesus amen
[46:00] let's continue with that thought and
[46:02] let's let's see where the lord has
[46:03] and has for us and where he's taking us
[46:06] hebrews 13
[46:07] 8 president
[46:19] when you have you can say amen
[46:23] here good to see each one of you bueno
[46:26] is
[46:28] those that we can't see and those that
[46:29] we can't the lord sees us all
[46:32] and it reads like this jesus christ
[46:36] the same yesterday and today
[46:39] and forever
[46:54] are you glad once again that he is the
[46:56] same esta contentos
[46:58] where would we be if we had a
[47:00] ever-changing god
[47:04] lord help us may he add his blessings to
[47:06] the reading of his word and you may be
[47:08] seated
[47:11] once again as we had said last sunday
[47:15] we may quote many things that we were
[47:17] that we spoke about
[47:19] but we want to try to bring this in the
[47:21] simplest terms so that you can
[47:23] understand it
[47:27] they said find out
[47:31] what he was back then
[47:35] then the scripture says he's the same
[47:39] hey man so i'm going to say that again
[47:42] we know exactly who he was back then
[47:47] we'll know exactly who he is today
[47:59] remember jesus christ is the principal
[48:02] theme
[48:03] of the bible
[48:06] and we understand that the bible is the
[48:08] revelation
[48:09] of jesus christ
[48:13] and therefore every character that is
[48:15] mentioned in the bible
[48:21] amen everyone i'm going to say it again
[48:24] every character in the bible
[48:28] was typing christ and was pointing that
[48:32] christ was coming
[48:35] as we said some time ago
[48:38] the old testament that he's coming
[48:43] the new testament says he's here
[48:47] and we are certainly grateful to god
[48:51] now are we going to fully understand the
[48:54] mystery of his will
[48:59] what the mystery of god's will is in
[49:01] each one of our lives
[49:05] how will we ever understand that
[49:08] if we don't search the scriptures
[49:15] how many believe that the scriptures
[49:16] chose and it's got the answers to who
[49:18] you are
[49:21] how many really believe let me see your
[49:22] hands if you really believe this
[49:24] want to make sure that we're talking to
[49:26] believers this this morning
[49:29] amen now once again we want to know the
[49:32] mystery
[49:33] it's a mystery his will is in every one
[49:36] of our lives
[49:39] and every character in the bible
[49:57] and that's why it was he is known as the
[49:59] identified christ
[50:04] of all the ages once again
[50:07] i'm going to say it again he is the
[50:09] identified christ
[50:12] identification of all the ages
[50:15] i'm sure tonight brother branham says on
[50:16] the message identification
[50:19] identification that we ought to find
[50:21] ourselves
[50:23] somewhere
[50:30] amen amen he says so that
[50:34] we would know the k the outcome of that
[50:38] character
[50:43] that's why when you read the bible you
[50:44] you've got to it's got to be personal to
[50:47] you
[50:50] you got to find yourselves in some
[50:53] character
[50:54] of the bible
[50:57] he says and that way we know what the
[51:00] outcome was of that character
[51:04] and then he says he look what he's
[51:06] saying
[51:20] see what their outcome was
[51:23] i'll show you your outcome
[51:26] how god is so good and this is the
[51:28] revelation of jesus christ
[51:32] and once again he is the same yesterday
[51:35] today and forever hallelujah
[51:39] and all these characters these
[51:41] characteristics that they displayed
[51:46] we're finally bottled up into one person
[51:52] and that is our lord jesus christ
[51:56] for all that god was he poured it into
[52:02] christ
[52:09] and so we know then the next part of it
[52:11] is all that christ was
[52:13] he poured into the church
[52:16] once again in the message how the angel
[52:18] came to me
[52:21] brother branham saw jesus jesus he said
[52:25] there's not an artist in the world that
[52:26] could paint his picture
[52:28] he says
[52:44] much love and kindness
[52:49] my my i don't know about you but i i
[52:52] just
[52:52] i just can't get over how much i uh how
[52:55] much i fall in love with him more every
[52:56] day
[52:58] and the more i search the scriptures the
[53:00] more in love i
[53:01] am with him and after a while just let
[53:06] lord for me
[53:09] you gotta say lord for me is in your
[53:12] body
[53:14] and what a great plan that he has placed
[53:19] imagine then that the king of glory
[53:23] de la gloria would come down and put on
[53:25] flesh and blood
[53:26] veneers
[53:41] he said god compressing himself into his
[53:45] body
[53:48] letting man touch and feel the warmth of
[53:52] god himself
[54:03] who before had only we had only hurt him
[54:22] now
[54:32] [Music]
[54:35] prefers the unseen distant god
[54:41] we have difficulty with the god who is
[54:44] living in flesh
[54:45] difficulties how many know that's true
[54:49] today
[55:05] whenever they need him but one more time
[55:08] he is now
[55:09] approachable
[55:12] when he was not approachable
[55:16] no one could enter into the holy of
[55:18] holies
[55:44] we know the story of the little boy that
[55:46] that
[55:52] his parents says that you you know god
[55:54] god is with you don't be afraid
[55:57] to remember that story though and
[56:01] and he says yeah but but but i want a
[56:03] god that i can touch
[56:06] well i read one the other day that was
[56:08] similar
[56:10] it was a little girl and the moms went
[56:13] in there
[56:19] and the mom goes in and says jesus is
[56:21] here don't be afraid
[56:26] he said well then you stay here and stay
[56:28] with jesus and i'm going to jump in bed
[56:29] with dad
[56:33] why because it is the desire of a human
[56:36] being
[56:38] as much as as as when we look around to
[56:41] one another
[56:56] you can actually feel a hug right there
[57:00] are times that people that
[57:01] that people hug one another and they
[57:04] might do it out of courtesy you know
[57:07] how are you doing oh nice to see you
[57:09] there's nothing there
[57:11] but when you get somebody from the heart
[57:14] i can't say my brother i've missed you
[57:17] oh they just hug you and you can feel
[57:19] the warmth of the holy ghost
[57:23] that's what god wanted to do
[57:37] which was from the beginning
[57:41] which we have heard lokemos visto from
[57:43] the beginning
[57:46] we had heard him right
[57:49] which we have seen with our our eyes
[58:03] oh my just want to give you a hug right
[58:07] now
[58:09] gotta control got to control and our
[58:13] hands have
[58:14] handled of the word of life
[58:20] this is what
[58:41] [Music]
[59:03] i'm going to ask you a question have you
[59:04] verified that this morning
[59:09] well they were able to brother because
[59:11] they were with him 2000 years ago

[59:30] members of his
[59:56] once again he is the same yesterday hey
[59:58] listen to me
[1:00:09] it seems so different
[1:00:12] than what the
[1:00:24] they have a hierarchy of ministers
[1:00:52] the more distant he becomes to the
[1:00:54] people
[1:00:57] that's why god never set up his church
[1:00:59] that way
[1:01:02] come on church man sets up the church
[1:01:04] that way
[1:01:06] oh they want a great pastor walks
[1:01:18] why do you think he's better than us or
[1:01:20] what
[1:01:22] no no that's not the way gods that's not
[1:01:25] the way he set up his church
[1:01:28] he set up his church to make sure that
[1:01:31] he was available
[1:01:35] hello everybody that's why we're
[1:01:37] available 24 hours a day
[1:01:41] i don't care if we have to go with kings
[1:01:44] we have been with kings i don't care if
[1:01:46] we have to go to the person on the
[1:01:48] street
[1:01:50] we'll go down
[1:02:18] is
[1:02:32] is
[1:02:44] and he touched the people allah
[1:02:51] i'm going to say it again the people
[1:02:53] touched him
[1:02:56] and he touched the people
[1:03:00] talking of the leper in matthew 83 you
[1:03:02] don't have to turn to it i'm just going
[1:03:03] to go down the list havelando de la
[1:03:04] proson matteo
[1:03:06] talking of these lepers jesus put forth
[1:03:09] his hand the bible says
[1:03:18] peter's mother-in-law las vegas pedro
[1:03:21] the bible says
[1:03:22] he touched her hand
[1:03:26] and the fever left her fievel
[1:03:34] i don't know but this is good stuff to
[1:03:35] me
[1:03:37] if this ever gets old to you you need to
[1:03:39] come back to the altar
[1:03:42] siesta
[1:04:07] and the same way that the woman with the
[1:04:09] issue of the blood touched him
[1:04:25] whole fuel perfectamente now if we are
[1:04:28] the body of christ
[1:04:34] that same nature be in us
[1:04:37] not the same characteristics
[1:04:50] these signs shall follow them
[1:05:11] do you think even when he's when he went
[1:05:13] down and he and he got that that muddy
[1:05:15] spit on that dirt
[1:05:20] and he created that eyeball
[1:05:23] what do you think the earth did when he
[1:05:25] pulled some of it
[1:05:29] oh i could just feel that the earth just
[1:05:31] shake and say oh
[1:05:33] he touched me
[1:05:56] in church we we we see the people
[1:05:59] and you see somebody maybe that becomes
[1:06:01] good friends with the pastor amigos
[1:06:04] all of a sudden they think that they're
[1:06:06] just somehow higher than somebody else
[1:06:10] i'm friends with the pastor amigo that's
[1:06:13] fine
[1:06:14] wonderful but do you have the same
[1:06:17] characteristics
[1:06:19] characteristics that don't make you
[1:06:22] better than anybody else
[1:06:26] hello we look at things backwards
[1:06:31] here's the god of glory oh my lord let's
[1:06:33] get into this
[1:06:36] watch this now
[1:06:39] touched
[1:06:42] humans humans
[1:06:46] by washing their feet
[1:06:56] my goodness yo smile you know
[1:06:59] in a church and only less the bigger a
[1:07:02] church gets the more
[1:07:05] schisms there are in the church
[1:07:11] i remember when we were just a few oh
[1:07:13] man
[1:07:14] we'd have such a good time
[1:07:20] starts becoming groupie
[1:07:25] and then all of a sudden there's more
[1:07:26] fights
[1:07:31] the church should be the place of where
[1:07:34] we can
[1:07:34] let down our hair like
[1:07:38] okay how many of you have ever gone to
[1:07:40] church
[1:07:42] and you come to the greeter
[1:07:46] la puerta but you and your husband or

[1:08:51] god don't want you like that if you're
[1:08:53] mad
[1:08:54] god wants you mad
[1:08:57] somehow we think that because we're
[1:08:59] christians we shouldn't ever get mad we
[1:09:01] shouldn't get upset
[1:09:04] we think that we should
[1:09:18] and

[1:10:59] we've told people things and they've
[1:11:01] gone and gone to tell everybody else
[1:11:04] for doing that and that's why this is a
[1:11:07] sick body

[1:13:19] she was pregnant not knowing no man
[1:13:28] kind of hard to believe her es duro

[1:13:33] doesn't seem like the grand entrance the
[1:13:35] messiah was supposed to have
[1:13:37] no pares
[1:13:44] and then he calls a bunch of disciples
[1:13:49] some who don't even know how to sign
[1:13:52] their name
[1:13:56] surrounded himself with men like that
[1:14:05] made himself of no reputation
[1:14:10] but he took upon him the form of a
[1:14:13] servant
[1:14:16] here's where we get into the message he
[1:14:18] took on himself
[1:14:19] upon him the form of a servant
[1:14:25] and was made in the likeness of men
[1:14:30] oh we're going to get to something good
[1:14:32] in after a while on this one

[1:14:38] likeness
[1:14:39] of men in the song

[1:14:45] pieces in the puzzle together

[1:15:17] of sinful flesh amen

[1:15:31] god
[1:15:33] and the word became flesh and dwelt
[1:15:35] amongst
[1:15:36] and wait a minute wait a minute but the
[1:15:40] flesh when the word became flesh
[1:15:44] it was in the likeness of sinful flesh
[1:15:49] oh my oh
[1:15:53] the word became flesh
[1:15:56] in the likeness of sinful flesh he came
[1:16:00] in the likeness of men

[1:17:19] verse but was in all points

[1:18:20] watch him now this gets gooder and
[1:18:23] gooder as we go on yes
[1:19:21] he threw it off everyone else
[1:19:24] but even to a point that john the
[1:19:27] baptist
[1:19:28] had seen the dove come down
[1:19:31] and already said this is the lamb of god
[1:20:00] how do you make that declaration
[1:20:13] i know lord you're with me jose senor
[1:20:15] questions on me but as soon as times get

[1:20:28] seekers
[1:20:30] that's okay
[1:20:43] because it's no more just the sign so
[1:20:45] much
[1:20:46] it's the voice behind the side
[1:20:50] the sign can only point you in a
[1:20:51] direction
[1:20:53] but when he that is in you speaks
[1:20:56] what does it do it shows you yeah
[1:21:06] i pray this is this is helping you how
[1:21:08] many how many is it helping you

[1:21:33] somebody else
[1:21:37] who do you follow i can't see us too um
[1:21:41] follow a servant
[1:21:46] not me i follow the king of kings
[1:21:50] that's where a lot of people are today i

[1:22:29] the other one

[1:22:45] not in this time no neces tiempo
[1:22:49] most people wouldn't take that la
[1:22:52] people wouldn't want that and most
[1:22:55] people are too embarrassed to say that
[1:22:59] yes his ways are past finding out
[1:23:03] his ways are so much higher than ours
[1:23:07] there was no other way to redeem man
[1:23:10] than to become one of them
[1:23:15] but let me tell you about this great
[1:23:18] servant
[1:23:43] he was born without normal conceptions
[1:23:56] in physics in physical he disprove the
[1:23:59] law of gravity
[1:24:03] ascended into heaven in economics
[1:24:08] he disproves the law of diminishing
[1:24:10] returns
[1:24:14] by feeding 5 000 men
[1:24:18] with two fishes and five loaves of bread
[1:24:22] in medicine in the medicinal he cured
[1:24:24] the sick
[1:24:26] and the blind without administering a
[1:24:29] single dose of drugs
[1:24:32] in history and historia here's the
[1:24:34] beginning
[1:24:37] in government he said he shall be called
[1:24:42] wonderful
[1:24:49] he said no one comes to the father
[1:24:52] except through me
[1:24:55] he came in the form of a servant
[1:24:59] yet his followers called him masters
[1:25:04] he had no degree yet they called him a
[1:25:08] teacher
[1:25:09] he had no medicines yes they called him
[1:25:12] a healer
[1:25:14] he had no armies yeah rulers
[1:25:18] feared him he won no military battles
[1:25:23] yet he conquered the whole world
[1:25:27] he committed no crime
[1:25:30] yet they crucified him he was buried in
[1:25:34] a tomb
[1:25:36] yet he lives today he demolished every
[1:25:40] status quo
[1:25:43] and i am honored to have and serve is
[1:25:46] such a leader leader
[1:25:50] this is where the church needs to get
[1:25:52] back to
[1:26:30] but jesus called unto him to them called
[1:26:33] them to him and said unto them ye know
[1:26:36] that they which are
[1:26:37] accounted to rule over the gentiles they
[1:26:40] exercise lordship over them
[1:26:43] and their great ones exercise authority
[1:26:46] upon them
[1:27:00] that's us the gentiles mentality
[1:27:08] who's the greatest amongst us
[1:27:11] same conversation that the disciples had
[1:27:14] conversations who's the greatest in the
[1:27:16] kingdom
[1:27:27] he took me up mount transfiguration oh
[1:27:29] no i
[1:27:30] turned on and
[1:27:34] my goodness but so shall it
[1:27:37] not be among you
[1:27:41] but whosoever will be great among you
[1:27:44] antes
[1:27:52] the minister was going to be the great
[1:27:54] one amongst us
[1:27:56] no no that's not what it's saying no
[1:27:58] it's
[1:27:59] whosoever will be great among you
[1:28:04] shall be your minister and a minister
[1:28:07] there
[1:28:07] minister is diaconos
[1:28:11] one who attends

[1:28:27] supposed to be
[1:28:30] take off turn around and throw them away
[1:28:49] we'll attend somebody for 10 minutes and
[1:28:52] i
[1:28:52] know yeah
[1:29:10] that's the easy way out i'm not helping
[1:29:12] them because they don't listen you want
[1:29:13] to kill yourself
[1:29:15] christ never did that to you nor did he
[1:29:18] do it to me when we didn't listen
[1:29:22] how many of you got it all at once but
[1:29:24] yeah i got it i acted right from the
[1:29:26] beginning
[1:29:29] don't even raise your hands
[1:29:32] 44 and whosoever of you will be the
[1:29:36] chiefest
[1:29:50] shall be the servant of all
[1:29:55] oh you know what a servant is there
[1:30:01] a slave as a bond man
[1:30:15] oh now we're getting to be like jesus
[1:30:18] huh
[1:30:20] for even the son of man oh wait till i
[1:30:23] get into this
[1:30:25] for even the son of man
[1:30:29] that's office of of a prophet
[1:30:33] even the son of man came not to be
[1:30:35] ministered unto
[1:30:36] no inaudible i am come down from heaven
[1:30:39] come and serve me
[1:30:42] i'm over here
[1:30:45] even the son of man came not to be
[1:30:48] ministered
[1:30:52] but to minister and to give his life a
[1:30:55] ransom
[1:30:56] for many yeah
[1:30:59] you still want to be like jesus jesus
[1:31:04] i want to be like him
[1:31:08] one that attends wait a minute
[1:31:12] the son of man elijah came
[1:31:28] to fulfill the offices
[1:31:33] of his church this iglesia
[1:31:36] you'll know why i said that in a moment
[1:31:39] he didn't come for somebody to serve him
[1:31:42] no binoculars
[1:31:56] come on church i'm going to say that
[1:31:57] again we are servants then
[1:32:00] and our job is to try to make somebody
[1:32:02] else life a little bit better
[1:32:10] it is to free them especially
[1:32:13] so that they can be everything that they
[1:32:15] are called to be
[1:32:17] using because a servant's first
[1:32:21] interest el interest is not himself
[1:32:26] it is others
[1:32:33] i could just stop right here and just
[1:32:34] let that one just sink in
[1:32:38] so
[1:32:43] and they came to jesus jesus
[1:32:47] and john's disciples asked him
[1:32:51] he said are you uh are you he that was
[1:32:54] going to come
[1:32:56] or do we look for another
[1:33:00] when they came to jesus jesus jesus
[1:33:02] never said
[1:33:04] of course i'm the one tell
[1:33:20] that wasn't jesus's response
[1:33:29] i like to let those things just soak
[1:33:30] inside
[1:33:32] it's got you gotta get this church
[1:33:36] there is no rapture if we're not like
[1:33:37] him
[1:33:42] that's right not we can be like a church
[1:33:46] member
[1:33:48] the church is full of grandchildren
[1:33:55] but in the midst of all that there are
[1:33:56] many children
[1:34:01] he said
[1:34:06] no you go tell john
[1:34:11] simple as this you go
[1:34:15] no no no don't go tell him go
[1:34:18] show him
[1:34:21] go show john of those things
[1:34:26] show him again those things which
[1:34:31] you do here de las cosas
[1:34:42] you tell him to do this that the blind
[1:34:47] receive their sight losing how could the
[1:34:50] blind receive their sights
[1:34:54] if they didn't have a someone that was
[1:34:56] serving this
[1:35:03] if you look at a real minister is this a
[1:35:05] few hundred minutes how much
[1:35:06] time is that put in there serving the
[1:35:08] people
[1:35:11] how many hours of prayer
[1:35:21] you tell him that the blind receive
[1:35:24] their sight
[1:35:25] losing the lame also have a friend
[1:35:29] the lame also have a servant
[1:35:32] you tell him that the lame walk tell him
[1:35:36] that the lepers are cleansed
[1:35:38] and the death here
[1:36:05] it's very hard to be a servant because
[1:36:08] it
[1:36:18] how many of you have something against
[1:36:22] somebody
[1:36:24] wrong question i want to see how many
[1:36:28] want deliverance today from that come on
[1:36:31] whether you're online and it doesn't
[1:36:33] matter
[1:36:36] how many can raise your hand if you say
[1:36:37] i've got i've i've got some thing
[1:36:38] against somebody what's the point
[1:36:40] or somebody has something against you if
[1:36:43] you know somebody has something against
[1:36:44] you
[1:36:47] that gets me off the hook
[1:36:54] how many want to overcome that
[1:36:58] i'm going to give you the key today
[1:37:02] okay who wants a key point
[1:37:18] i'm going to tell you what to do are you
[1:37:19] ready
[1:37:21] now my question is how many of you will
[1:37:23] really do it
[1:37:26] you want to make it home do it
[1:37:29] you don't no it's up to you is
[1:37:35] invite that person to your house
[1:37:40] get a bucket of water
[1:37:44] and humble yourself you meet me you say
[1:37:57] you'll break that spirit just like that
[1:38:00] yes
[1:38:02] but you think people today will humble
[1:38:05] themselves to that
[1:38:08] i'm not the one that's wrong they're the
[1:38:09] one that's wrong
[1:38:13] you know somebody has ought against
[1:38:28] there is a god
[1:38:58] how many want to be the servant of all
[1:39:00] patos
[1:39:04] am i heading home this morning
[1:39:08] let's go on i got it i still got a
[1:39:09] little bit of time
[1:39:24] and humility is seeing ourselves
[1:39:28] as we really are
[1:39:31] did you get that real humility is to see
[1:39:35] yourself
[1:39:36] like you really are
[1:39:39] [Music]
[1:39:47] it is knowing who we are and owning it
[1:39:52] is
[1:39:55] it is living without hypocrisy
[1:40:02] we might act one way however when we get
[1:40:04] around people oh yeah look at this look
[1:40:06] at the brothers
[1:40:16] i want all these little points church i
[1:40:18] want you to just go over it over and
[1:40:20] over again
[1:40:22] say lord lord help me to be like
[1:40:26] jesus listen to this
[1:40:29] it is living without hypocrisy
[1:40:32] it is walking in the light is
[1:40:36] not afraid of no dark spots of your life
[1:40:44] nothing is being a open book
[1:40:47] only all to see
[1:40:54] one of the most loving things that i can
[1:40:55] do for someone
[1:40:59] is to be honest about myself
[1:41:17] how many times after you've talked to
[1:41:18] somebody or somebody's talked to you
[1:41:22] does one say i wonder what they meant by
[1:41:25] that
[1:41:29] i wonder what they're really up to they
[1:41:30] were really nice to me
[1:41:35] that way what is it
[1:41:38] you're having to sift through deception
[1:41:44] sir walter
[1:41:59] when we when first we fashion to deceive
[1:42:04] when by my incongruency
[1:42:13] i give people wrong signals
[1:42:17] they respond accordingly and wrongly to
[1:42:20] me
[1:42:24] and then i respond wrongly to their
[1:42:26] wrong response
[1:42:31] and on and off the circle continues
[1:42:34] until a war is started and no one
[1:42:37] remembers how the feud began
[1:42:42] it began when we first tried to deceive
[1:42:45] somebody of
[1:42:46] who we really were
[1:42:49] that's why jesus made himself of no
[1:42:54] reputation
[1:43:05] and being found in fashion as a man
[1:43:18] because you see humility is not thinking
[1:43:21] less of yourself
[1:43:27] because you're too busy thinking about
[1:43:29] someone else
[1:43:32] now we're getting into the mind frame of
[1:43:34] a servant
[1:43:50] peter 5 5 tells us
[1:43:55] in humility why has humility been lost
[1:43:59] in the church
[1:44:02] because the gentiles are always trying
[1:44:04] to exercise lordship over someone
[1:44:14] that's
[1:44:19] how many right of the lord do we have
[1:44:20] here
[1:44:23] you got to balance the word
[1:44:27] brother brother brother diego preached
[1:44:29] the other day
[1:44:32] he no
[1:44:39] but that don't take away that we're
[1:44:41] still his servants
[1:44:43] he just doesn't call us that no no no
[1:44:47] come on you got to balance the word we
[1:44:50] must continue as servants
[1:44:53] with all humility serving the people
[1:44:58] god has a ministry today you're still in
[1:45:00] the ministerial
[1:45:14] is he not still serving the people
[1:45:20] that's right watch this now
[1:45:23] pikachu when they said brother branham
[1:45:25] and they said mano branham that's
[1:45:27] that sister said is
[1:45:41] in the message be not afraid he says
[1:45:44] christ died to save every lost
[1:45:46] person
[1:45:49] no matter what creed has done for them
[1:45:54] that's always tried to be my approach
[1:46:09] what an example
[1:46:13] i'm just a public servant
[1:46:16] of god to you
[1:46:20] and the preacher is a public servant
[1:46:24] publicly
[1:46:34] that can help the people
[1:46:41] we are a publix we are public servants
[1:46:45] this is why satan is against
[1:46:49] every true minister of god
[1:47:05] as i was reading the message taking
[1:47:06] sides with jesus
[1:47:09] brother branham starts off saying have
[1:47:12] you noticed what satan has tried to do
[1:47:14] in the last few days
[1:47:18] to the ministers that's associated
[1:47:34] he said it's satan trying to get rid of
[1:47:36] us
[1:47:45] and even in our midst i find
[1:47:48] satan trying to get rid of us
[1:47:56] in one way or another that's right
[1:48:00] he's tried to kill some by car accidents
[1:48:04] he's tried to kill some by sickness
[1:48:08] he's trying to destroy the physical body
[1:48:10] of some el cuerpo
[1:48:11] de algunos he's tried to discourage
[1:48:13] others by using their children
[1:48:17] he's trying to discourage others by
[1:48:19] using their spouse
[1:48:23] discourage others by their finances
[1:48:29] he's trying to kill
[1:48:40] but i want every deacon every minister
[1:48:42] would you stand to your feet today
[1:48:58] and i want you people to understand that
[1:49:00] these people these men
[1:49:04] those that help the usher stand to your
[1:49:06] feet yes sirs
[1:49:07] [Music]
[1:49:08] that help you then they serve the people
[1:49:12] they worry about
[1:49:19] brother brown's telling you this and
[1:49:20] we're seeing it happen in our own myths
[1:49:23] trying to bring some sickness he'll do
[1:49:26] what he can to get to you
[1:49:28] he'll use your family's church he'll use
[1:49:31] whoever he can
[1:49:32] i can say the closest one to you but i
[1:49:36] want to repeat what brother branham
[1:49:39] he said i want to encourage each one of
[1:49:41] you ministers
[1:49:44] be courageous no matter what comes up
[1:49:49] what takes place just don't let
[1:49:52] nothing beset you no
[1:50:08] thank you my brothers gracious how many
[1:50:10] are going to pray even more
[1:50:13] not just the one man up here
[1:50:17] there's a ministry there many times even
[1:50:20] helped keep my arms up
[1:50:22] came here
[1:50:36] is
[1:50:51] but he came in the form of a sermon
[1:50:55] how i look at that and i say lord i have
[1:50:57] a lot to
[1:50:58] i got a lot to grow in you mean
[1:51:02] to be a good servant but that's not good
[1:51:04] enough
[1:51:06] i want to be a better servant for the
[1:51:08] rest of this year
[1:51:10] for the beginning of next year for as
[1:51:12] long as god would have me here
[1:51:15] i want to make sure i'm approachable
[1:51:18] touchable
[1:51:32] who can we
[1:51:45] henceforth i don't call you servants no
[1:51:47] more but friends
[1:51:50] amigos why because you're doing the same
[1:51:53] thing i'm doing that
[1:52:00] you know why we're his friend because he
[1:52:02] looks us and says now you understand me
[1:52:04] a little bit
[1:52:06] amigos
[1:52:10] and i'm just going to go down this list
[1:52:13] romans 1 1.
[1:52:14] paul
[1:52:35] the servants of jesus christ to all the
[1:52:38] saints
[1:52:39] in christ and christopher which are at
[1:53:09] the servant of jesus christ
[1:53:13] revelations do you notice they're all
[1:53:16] one one
[1:53:17] see because you can't go to the rest of
[1:53:19] the chapter lest you cross the
[1:53:21] servanthood
[1:53:24] the revelation
[1:53:38] signified it
[1:53:41] unto his servant john juan
[1:53:45] revelations 19 10.
[1:53:48] to worship him
[1:53:52] see thou do it
[1:54:06] the testimony of jesus is the spirit of
[1:54:08] prophecy
[1:54:09] jesus again brother branham
[1:54:13] says that you're jesus christ incarnate
[1:54:17] was wrong jesus christ
[1:54:34] search
[1:54:48] just give me like 10 minutes okay just
[1:54:51] like about 10 minutes
[1:54:54] i'm sorry i guess i just
[1:54:57] maybe i ought to just preach like 45
[1:54:59] minutes huh just
[1:55:01] drop it and go
[1:55:16] in one
[1:55:27] and there's a man there's men that go
[1:55:28] into those offices
[1:55:41] there's a balance to these things we'll
[1:55:43] get into those
[1:55:44] we've gotten to those but we'll get into
[1:55:46] a little later
[1:55:49] why did the church world put him out of
[1:55:50] their churches
[1:55:54] because they were not trained into in
[1:55:56] the word to know him
[1:56:15] and without the mind of christ you can't
[1:56:18] believe every word
[1:56:21] and having his mind is to know his will
[1:56:26] it is the mind of the anointed one which
[1:56:28] is christ
[1:56:31] and if that anointing only anoints your
[1:56:35] spirit
[1:56:37] you'll never be like jesus jesus
[1:56:42] if it only anoints your flesh you won't
[1:56:44] be like jesus
[1:56:47] but if that anointing goes down and over
[1:56:51] shadows the germ of life in your soul
[1:56:57] will produce christ in you
[1:57:00] and that's why that's why brother
[1:57:01] branham says this is
[1:57:03] you can have the holy ghost 24 hours
[1:57:08] you'll go to hell
[1:58:10] but don't lose sight that you are a
[1:58:12] servant of jesus christ
[1:58:15] that he uses for the benefit of the
[1:58:18] people
[1:58:31] how can people ever say that they are
[1:58:35] christians and deny the supernatural
[1:58:39] christians the whole ministry
[1:58:42] is the supernatural
[1:58:46] because each one when they got a swallow
[1:58:48] of that supernatural manner
[1:58:52] he become a priest or as soon as he
[1:58:54] become a priest
[1:59:01] because the ministry is the
[1:59:03] foreknowledge
[1:59:10] my lord i pray that you get this this
[1:59:13] morning
[1:59:14] once again
[1:59:43] there's were so many people well i don't
[1:59:44] need a ministry
[1:59:47] i got the messenger and the message
[1:59:51] how can you claim to have the message
[1:59:53] and deny what the message has produced
[2:00:08] and if you watch this in the seven seal
[2:00:09] how many times it explodes
[2:00:14] come on now how many brother jim that's
[2:00:17] right
[2:00:18] somebody that reads it explodes three
[2:00:21] times
[2:00:22] explode every generation that comes
[2:00:25] after
[2:00:26] an explosion that produces that
[2:00:28] explosion and this is where many people
[2:00:31] failing to understand yeah
[2:00:33] let me tell you something and don't you
[2:00:35] ever forget this
[2:00:37] the anointing doesn't just fall from
[2:00:40] heaven
[2:00:42] some pentecostal idea oh the anointing
[2:00:45] is going to come down and it will annoy
[2:00:47] me elohim
[2:00:48] not the way that god made his church
[2:00:50] they said no
[2:00:51] no he said he was like
[2:01:06] cannot get
[2:02:02] he poured out his spirit upon all flesh
[2:02:09] but it's the same as when he waters
[2:02:14] the weeds praise the lord just like the
[2:02:17] crop
[2:02:19] they all thank god for the water
[2:02:22] they're not all wheat and that's where
[2:02:25] people
[2:02:26] fail to realize you want the anointing
[2:02:30] from god
[2:02:44] every preacher out there has an
[2:02:45] anointing but i'm not talking about that
[2:02:48] anointing
[2:02:49] i'm talking about christ
[2:02:57] the anointing oil that goes down from
[2:02:59] the top of their head
[2:03:01] to the soles of our feet
[2:03:04] and is bringing the congregation into
[2:03:07] this priesthood
[2:03:11] but not by putting men above there
[2:03:15] even though there are offices in the
[2:03:17] church
[2:03:19] many understand that but watch that
[2:03:22] anointing how it comes forth
[2:03:25] they stay on that for a while when the
[2:03:28] prophet of the age put forth a message
[2:03:32] the supernatural the anointing
[2:03:35] elohim the mind of god i was once
[2:03:38] delivered to the state
[2:03:40] exploded
[2:04:12] a couple minutes and then you can go to
[2:04:13] the piano
[2:04:16] i just want to stop with this because i
[2:04:19] never finished
[2:04:25] in the beginning was the word
[2:04:28] the word was with god and the word was
[2:04:30] god
[2:04:35] remember some years ago brother tommy jr
[2:04:37] preached a message tremendous message
[2:04:40] the holy spirit brought through him and
[2:04:42] he preached on this
[2:04:44] he said you notice how most people jump
[2:04:46] from verse 1 to verse 14.
[2:04:50] he said but no one ever goes to or very
[2:04:53] very rarely do they go to
[2:04:54] to verse 2.
[2:05:00] and the word became flesh oh we go all
[2:05:03] the way over there
[2:05:40] i don't know whether to preach this or
[2:05:41] just or just let it just permeate
[2:05:59] the same was in the beginning el mismo
[2:06:02] estaba
[2:06:03] real quick genesis 1 26 says and god
[2:06:06] said
[2:06:06] let us make man in our image
[2:06:09] after our likeness
[2:06:14] image
[2:06:26] and likeness is the shape or resemblance
[2:06:32] so the image is the representative
[2:06:34] figure
[2:06:38] and the likeness is what's fashioned or
[2:06:40] shaped in the similitude of that image
[2:06:42] similar
[2:06:56] brother branham could jesus look like
[2:06:58] you and the man around his head i read
[2:07:00] this
[2:07:02] or you be jesus something like that
[2:07:05] in one sense of the word that's exactly
[2:07:07] the truth
[2:07:09] another sense of the word it's an
[2:07:12] antichrist
[2:07:14] the difference between right and wrong
[2:07:17] if you try to make me the person of the
[2:07:19] lord jesus
[2:07:21] you're making me an antichrist
[2:07:24] but because that person
[2:07:28] is a person of the lord jesus that's
[2:07:30] sitting at the right hand of the hand of
[2:07:32] the majesty
[2:07:37] but for his life
