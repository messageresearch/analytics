they sang My Papa's favorite song At The Cross at the cross where I first saw the light we've been appreciating the word of God that has been coming forth from this best and I don't know how many people have enjoyed it but we enjoy the presence of the Lord and we're we're here in expectation today because of what God has given us we're we're we're uh uh happy today that we're alive and we're happy that we're able to breathe and we're happy to be able to have the the the vision and happy to see to have the desire to come and serve the Lord I don't believe that you've come here this morning to waste your time I sure didn't I came here to give you uh a a good news and the good news is that Jesus Christ is alive I don't know if that if if that really stirs your heart but I believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday do you believe that and I want to give you a word of encouragement today and if I could tell you what would it be it would be simply the next day tell your neighbor look at your neighbor and tell them the next day now maybe give him a high five if you want to tell your neighbor again the next day hallu Hallelujah might have been a day just like today but it was the next day the day before they were working Elijah was baptizing you said uh who was Elijah well that was John the Baptist it was baptizing the day before but this was the next day now we've all received the message of the hour we all know that brother brand is the seventh messenger there ain't no one after him God had 1 2 3 4 5 six seven stars and he was the last one what he spoke to us about he spoke to us about a day even the Bible tells us but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel so we're talking about days now and one day speaks to another day day one day voice to another day one day speaks about the next day now I want to talk to you about the next day now we we've all have uh have uh have lived in a time that that we all have problems even if you don't and it's not going to be very deep today so you don't you don't have to to to to you can you can you can go on YouTube again and hear the message it's not going to it's not going to take you out and you're don't don't don't write don't but don't miss if you want to write write but don't miss because I want you to get the essence of the message now I want you to understand what brother Bram and he says when the day that John baptized Jesus the lamb John said there comes the meekness of God Behold the Lamb of God that take it that takes away the sin of the world and when John baptized him he went out of the water God the holy spirit in the form of a dove come down on him and abod in him amen amen abod in him that was the greatest event this world has ever seen and we'll see until I'm going to say it again that was the greatest event that this world has ever seen [Applause] until did I get off on the wrong exit until Christ and his church United together yeah this is what what what's wrong in the Simplicity of the Gospel there's nothing wrong with the gospel it's the understanding of it we always believe that something's coming and that's all right let it come until you until it meets you but one day the word meets the prophet in the middle of the water now now when he does I want you to know the attraction was always on the prophet 712 years a virgin shall conceive a virgin shall conceive and 712 years later a virgin and her espouse to be had just come back from church or from the synagogue and when Mary and Joseph sit down they started reading behold the Virgin shall conceive Mary looks at Joseph and says could that be us God will have a bride could that be me there cannot be until there is the next day and brother says this then the attraction changed from the prophet to his [Music] prophecy brother Bram says this the attraction changed from the prophet to his prophecy okay but it happens the next day sometimes we want to believe what we believe and that's all right but you got to let the next day come forward every major prophet went down thinking my prophecy didn't come to pass can you imagine 712 years I love what my our Pastor said 3500 years later the Jews hold on to their Prophet Moses 50 years later we don't even know if brother Brandon was our Prophet can you imagine 712 years must be off his rocker but one day the word of God the word that God thought was expressed through the mouth of the Prophet came to pass now in our day we didn't receive just any word brother Bernie used to say like this brother ber would say like this in the mind the part behind part of the mind of God Tau it brother is spoken now what did he speak about he spoke about the next [Applause] day you are people of rapture you are people of restoration you are people of the Resurrection you are the Temple of the Dynamics of God but it happens the next day well I'm going to believe yes Keep On Believing until your day comes around now I want to do do this for you and I hope that you are with me I know you are there is uh there there is a a type of horse and it's the Belgian draft horse this Belgian draft course is the can pull 8,000 lb by himself if you got two together how many could they pull you would say as I would said, but if take that same Belgian draft horse and you pair him up with another Belgian horse again you say 16,000 but if they've been raised together and they've trained together and they've learned how to pull together one can haul 8,000 pound two 16 32,000 lb no wonder when the scripture says this one can put 1,000 to flight but two but two 10,000 to flight the mathematics of God's word now if you want to go fast go by yourself go by yourself if you want to go far you got to go together we have seen the miraculous of God we have seen God In Action now now I got to say this we we we by the grace of God we went to a country this year called Poland there was a few people there maybe about 70 people you know of of the countries that we have visited Africa is crazy Africa ISC to worship God nobody even come close I I I love seeing Sister Sister Lizzy with her baby there in front and she was dancing and help do that's the way they do it over there you know why they don't have cell phones they don't have iPhones iones don't have i i tablets they don't have the big old screen TV most people worship God the way they have a TV right you ever seen this people have a small TV they do this they get a little bit bigger and they do this and a little bit more you can tell who's got a big screen at home because like right and we our worship is the same God did a little bit for me it is so sad I I pray for our worship leaders all the time always say somebody raise their hands somebody say glory and and and you won't understand until it's the next day you won't raise up your hands until God something there's always a crisis at home there's always a reason not to Worship the Lord I got Co I didn't get Co I'm sick I'm not sick I got money got a lot of money there's always a crisis at home do you know that the Japanese don't have a word for crisis they don't teach crisis they don't teach their people crisis they don't even have a word to describe what a crisis could be the closest word that they use to us in the English language is opportunity again this is the next day opportunity OPP opportunity is tremendous there's a problem in my house there's a problem in my church There's an opportunity Israel is in a crisis isra is inis you know what that means the church around the world is in a crisis oh no not my church brother no no yes it is you have a crisis at home you bring your crisis from home into the church and you bring it inside your body and then you try to Worship the Lord but it's in the day before the Middle East is on fire church and I'm talking about all of Malachi 45 is in a crisis if you think you're not in a crisis at home look at yourself in the mirror one day I believe one day I think I'll go to church the next day I don't know one day I believe God sent a prophet the next day I don't know but if there ever comes a next day to your life you will understand that in that day the Lamb of God shows up and he takes away the sin of the world the next day tell your neighbor the next day yell it to him if you want tell the next day the next day I like what brother Alex said last like the next day you might have to stand up and say the next day problems happen at night but the next day I'm telling you on Friday they crucified him on Saturday they buried him but the next day he [Applause] resurrected you're always going to have problems in this world you shall always have tribulation but be of good cheer for I have overcome the world can it get in any worse than this yes it can you might as well understand that we have been called to a fight oh you thought you were going to come to church and be on a cushy bench brother Fabio my papa brother Bernie they did not go on missionary trips on a Bed of Roses if it did not happen in their time they knew there was going to be a next day they talked about our day they preached about our day and we are the message or the revelation of the prophecy that they gave now you might not believe that that's all right that's all right you'll go out of here and say brother Tommy's out of his mind I'm going to give you a little little little just a little testimony we were in Poland and as and as ju the Africans the poish people are really conservative in the middle the Mexicans maybe somebody proved me wrong I don't know somebody got to prove it how you prove somebody have a [Applause] experience oh somebody called me a chicken one time they wouldn't do it twice if somebody said I didn't have the Lord they would not do it twice saw his name all of Heaven everything under the Earth heard him [Applause] shouting you've never had a next day experience I can sit down and I can say my dad's going to take me home you can sit here and say brother Bernie's going to take you home can sit here and say brother bram's going to take you home that's all right do you know that the dead in Christ they are waiting on [Music] us they're waiting on you and I you know how much work we have to do they're waiting on you and I because they without you cannot be made perfect because they've always they've always desired the next day so the brother writes me yesterday says he said while you were preaching the other day and this all honor goes to the Lord Jesus chist but he said you were preaching the other day you prophesied that there was two people that that had breathing problems he says one raised up one raised up and you still said in so many words said both of you are he and I did not know who you were talking about until a few weeks back and I said I had sleep at and I could not breathe and I found out that I was the second person now now you might not you might not get anything right now and you might feel sorry for yourself and say oh nobody's been as bad as me nobody has gone through where I've gone through you either transform your pain or you will transmit your pain you might say nobody has ever felt like this before don't feel privileged the book of Hebrews said they were stoned they were son us they were son they were they were despised of whom the world was not worthy of them they wandered about in sheep skins in caves looking for what they were looking for the next day again they were looking for the next day because in the next day the sacri the symbol was going to be finished and the reality was going to come to the Forefront in the old times they sacrificed the offerings the one showed up many people says that Jesus was our lamb that's but that's not all the truth Jesus was God's lamb Jesus was God's lamb what he had to do to settle the sin question that was his L we don't have not paid the price the maximum price for what calvary or what the world needed but we also to pray a price to bring Redemption to God's people now I want I I want to I want to do this real quick now in the 20th chapter of the book of St John the Bible speaks to us this was the resurrection of Jesus when they had buried Jesus the Bible says that they put a napkin on his face and buried him but when you go to the seventh verse when they look into the tomb they see the napkin and now it was neatly folded and placed in a place by itself now hold on to your seats hold on put your seat belts on or un unbuckle them whatever you want in Jewish tradition when the master of the house was finished with his food he would do this and he throw it to the side and the servant he knew when he had it was wrinkled and thrown to the side that he was done you can pick up the plate and go wash it but in the Jesus when he goes and he raises up from amongst the dead he takes off this Veil he takes off this napkin and he folds it because in the Jewish tradition when the master would fold his napkin it meant this I'm not I'll be back very soon I don't know what your condition is this morning but I believe that Jesus is not done yet I'll be back very [Applause] soon they should have killed us when they had the chance because he not done yet this is the [Applause] next I challenged a man one day I challenged a man by radio and he said this brother brandham he said died a drunker and I called him up not on my watch it's time for malakiah 45 to stand up and believe what they said they believe and if you have not had a next day experience today is your [Applause] day I said sir brother brandham did not die a drunker he was killed by a drunk driver he said well you know people think that you that you guys are a cult or heresy come on sir we're Heretics to somebody the is Islamic people think we're Heretics the Jews think were Heretics I told them but you know what sir anytime anywhere any place it's time to look your devil right in the eye you are in a crisis it's some other brother no sir it starts right here in Body Spirit and [Applause] soul I'm all right just to be I'm a good Christian so have you had the next day experience anybody without the Holy Ghost is an insane person you haven't had a next day experience the next day well needless to say the man hasn't called me Jesus knew nothing about the seven four glory of God while he was here because everything was going to come in the folds in the revelation of how he had folded it for seven Church ages and each one got their revelation of what was in the fold how is it I knew nothing about the Seven Seals the prophet of God says but each each day an angel would open up a [Music] fold he would open up his heart when you hear Brother Bernie's messages when you see yourself in the mirror you are his heart you are his message you are the revelation God has set in this place the word went away and he said this but yet a little while in the world more but you look at your neighbor don't look at him with the eyes of yesterday look with them with the eyes of today but you but you but you shall see me I will be with you the end of now now brother it's that you don't understand I've got to give up a lot of things in order in order to be a better Christian let me let me just take away all that real quick it's not it's what you put on again it's not what you give up what you put on so many years we said well if I could get rid of this I could get rid of that it's not what you give up it's what you put on I got I got to I got to read this stuff this these things great things the word crisis was to create was was created to describe things that we don't understand or are out of control or can't handle this we're in a but crisis is an opportunity to get it right it's time to put [Applause] Christ you say brother I I I I I I just can't do it by myself okay you you you you've heard this expression before you you you know you know why Devils don't like wet places because Devils can't swim okay they can't swim so the devil's coming after me you know what I do sister I raise up my hands cuz when I raise up my hands water starts [Music] flowing okay okay we're either going to transform our pain or we're going to transmit it and we're either going to feel sorry for ourselves do like this for us or por us are going to stand up as children of God and say ask for me in my house we will serve the Lord [Applause] amen the problem I got 16 minutes but the problem is we are either thermostats or we are thermometers and thermostat says let me go see how cold it is it's a thermometer I'm going to see how cold it is I'm to see how H I love the regulate the atmosphere so when it is cold in my house Holy Ghost and [Applause] Fire when things are going wrong it's Jehovah I've got to regulate my atmosphere Devils don't know how to swim you know when's the best time to preach When You're Going Through Hell Jesus is on the cross Jesus died but his soul but his soul starts going through hell it's the best time to change the [Applause] crisis it's been through the storm but the wind curtain turn it it's been through the fire but the fire couldn't burn it it's been fed to the Lions Li couldn't a lot of War but never never come on PT [Applause] deated this is the Church of the Living God sure we go through problems sure we go through tribulation the tribulations and in the persecution the Church of the Living God knows will be our next day amen tell your neighbor again the next [Applause] day is there some Eagles that can shout right now we aren't kitty cats we are the lion of the tribe [Applause] of who is worthy to take the book who is worthy to take the book and no man in heaven up in Earth neither under the Earth but a lion said wait a minute wait a minute who Challenge and nobody stood up and when it seemed like everything was lost a lamb he was looking for a lion a lamb St forward John couldn't see him because he was in the inter in the eternities he was there saving you he was there saving you and dunking each name until you would come to manifestation one day it would be the next day [Applause] go ahead go ahead go ahead if you feel the Lord Jesus
