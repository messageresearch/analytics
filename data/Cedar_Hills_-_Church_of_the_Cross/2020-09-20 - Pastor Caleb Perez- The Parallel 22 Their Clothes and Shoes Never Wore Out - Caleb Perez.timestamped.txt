[37:20] testimony amen
[37:23] i was going out the other day
[37:27] there to where the brothers were elk
[37:28] hunting
[37:33] i got on the freeway going north on
[37:35] interstate 10.
[37:37] interstate 25 going north
[37:41] and uh i had i had passed i was probably
[37:45] uh probably not quite to fort selden but
[37:49] right in there it might have been a
[37:51] little bit after fort zelda i'm sorry
[37:54] for seldom and uh and this car is coming
[37:57] of course i'm going north and this car
[37:59] of course the traffic's coming south
[38:11] i look and see if my my brights are on
[38:16] hello
[38:30] lights
[38:35] so i'm thinking maybe the road you know
[38:37] how the road goes
[38:38] bouncy sometimes and the lights kind of
[38:40] go up and down and maybe that's what i'm
[38:44] seeing
[38:59] little farther up or something okay
[39:03] and about the time that i that i was
[39:04] watching the semi
[39:07] trailer to look of course forward
[39:12] there's a car coming the opposite way
[39:15] head on to me
[39:18] that they were they were trying to warn
[39:20] me
[39:21] and i see this car coming head-on
[39:25] all i can do is pull over as fat and i
[39:28] have that trailer and i pull over as
[39:29] fast as i can
[39:30] okay because i pulled over
[39:33] the car goes right past me
[39:37] looked in the rearview mirror i said
[39:38] lord just take care of whoever's
[39:40] back there but i think the lord is
[39:44] always watching us
[39:48] i don't know you never know but that's
[39:52] why we should always pray before we go
[39:54] anywhere
[39:58] i was right before that happened that's
[39:59] what i was doing i was as i was driving
[40:01] i was praying
[40:04] i thank the lord for his protection
[40:07] god bless those that are on hookup
[40:09] there's
[40:10] god bless each one of you that has made
[40:12] the effort to come this morning would
[40:13] you stand
[40:17] as you can see here with the parallel
[40:18] number 22.
[40:22] i'm about to rival the the series of
[40:25] of uh the continuity of the word
[40:29] i think i i preached 29 messages
[40:34] on the parallel we can preach that to
[40:36] the coming of the lord
[40:40] because everything in the old testament
[40:41] is parallel in the new testament
[40:46] everything that we see in the natural of
[40:48] israel
[40:49] parallels us today
[40:53] we'll go as far as long as the lord
[40:54] tells us to and then we'll go
[40:56] we'll follow his lead wherever he he
[40:59] wants to
[41:00] to take us

[41:06] few times i preached don't ask me why

[47:17] i don't know about you but turn to your
[47:19] neighbor say neighbor that's the god
[47:20] that we serve
[47:22] you
[47:25] and i want you to notice and capture of
[47:28] course the parallel
[47:30] the spiritual parallel that is going on
[47:32] here
[47:35] why do our clothes and shoes wear out
[47:41] theirs did not wear out for 40 years
[47:45] our clothes wears out all the time
[47:49] buy a pair of shoes
[47:58] but my question is as we look into it on
[48:01] the spiritual aspect of things
[48:05] spiritual why is it that our patience
[48:08] seems to wear thin
[48:09] all the time
[48:13] i'm talking now i'm going i'm going
[48:14] parallel now into the spiritual aura
[48:18] why does it seem that we are wore out
[48:21] all the time
[48:26] their clothes and their shoes did not
[48:29] wear out for
[48:30] 40 years
[48:34] [Applause]
[48:46] and we seem to of all the things that we
[48:49] go through in life
[48:52] jobs and all that we seem to get wore
[48:54] out so fast
[48:58] and i say something is not being renewed
[49:01] in us
[49:04] because god said in his word
[49:08] they that wait upon the lord
[49:12] shall renew their strength i don't know
[49:14] if that's including you or not this
[49:16] morning but i'm going to say their
[49:19] clothes did not wear out for
[49:21] 40 years
[49:24] spiritually speaking we should not wear
[49:28] out either
[49:41] would renew their strength
[49:44] imagine them in the wilderness maybe a
[49:48] strap might have maybe
[49:50] tried to tear he says somehow some way
[49:53] the lord renewed their sandal perez
[50:03] are we wearing the right kind of
[50:04] garments today for the occasion
[50:10] there's garments different garments for
[50:11] different occasions
[50:15] you don't wear flip-flops to hike up
[50:18] mount everest
[50:23] very long
[50:34] a winter jacket when you go scuba diving
[50:45] you don't wear shorts and muscle shirt
[50:47] when you go up in a rocket
[50:51] and neither does the bride wear just any
[50:54] kind of clothes for her weddings
[50:58] dress by the word are you with me
[51:02] there is a certain kind of clothes for
[51:05] every occasion
[51:15] [Applause]
[51:21] certain there are many that claim to be
[51:23] the bride of christ today
[51:28] but they're all dressed differently
[51:32] and many think that they are dressed in
[51:34] muchos piensan
[51:43] but let's see how we should be dressed
[51:45] today
[51:48] if we're dressed properly
[51:51] and we know that our clothes and our
[51:53] shoes will not wear out
[51:57] man i don't know about you but that
[51:59] excites me this this morning
[52:02] i mean
[52:13] it's got to be able to stand up to the
[52:15] worst conditions that humanity has ever
[52:18] seen
[52:22] our clothes have to be able to handle
[52:24] the pressures of the day
[52:29] and our clothes have to withstand the
[52:31] attacks of the enemies
[52:35] you see we were not made to withstand
[52:37] the pressure of this day
[52:40] man was not made to handle the pressures
[52:50] that there are a people that are able to
[52:52] withstand the attacks of the enemy today
[52:58] because she is the only one that is
[53:00] dressed for the right occasion

[53:06] bibles ready as we as we go into this
[53:08] study peter five five says this
[53:12] cinco cinco di it's gonna tell us how we

[55:47] that i don't need

[55:54] i know he's accepted me but i
[55:57] pray that there can always be grace to
[56:00] the humble
[56:02] this is why there's so many problems in
[56:04] the homes and in the church
[56:08] we are not clothed with humility

[59:16] battle

[59:38] on
[59:38] what's happening

[1:00:46] [Applause]
[1:01:05] i don't know about you but that excites
[1:01:06] me you understand again
[1:01:08] their clothes and their shoes never wore
[1:01:11] out
[1:01:14] my what paul would say
[1:01:18] be not conformed
[1:01:22] but be transformed
[1:01:30] of your mind we've got to be renewed
[1:01:34] constantly
[1:01:49] and you see a lot of people today oh
[1:01:50] we're going to heaven
[1:01:53] they got their sights set on the
[1:01:54] destination
[1:01:57] it wasn't just about the destination
[1:02:04] but it was about the training that they
[1:02:05] received
[1:02:08] while on their journey through the
[1:02:11] desert to the promises
[1:02:16] and their clothes and their shoes never
[1:02:18] wore out
[1:02:28] you see all the hardships that they
[1:02:32] endured
[1:02:45] think about it for a moment god would
[1:02:48] allow them to experience a certain need
[1:02:55] then he would watch them as they try to
[1:02:58] figure out how to satisfy the need
[1:03:09] so can you imagine they all get together
[1:03:12] how do we get water almost
[1:03:25] well i don't know i don't know how deep
[1:03:27] the water is
[1:03:42] we ain't getting nowhere no thomas you
[1:03:44] can't we're about to die of
[1:03:46] thirst moses
[1:03:49] please speak to the lord we need water
[1:03:55] okay now
[1:04:09] they didn't even have a doctor brother
[1:04:10] branham says with them this element
[1:04:13] cause they only needed one prescription
[1:04:16] i am the lord that healed it all
[1:04:20] the time they didn't need to have a
[1:04:23] bunch of doctors with them
[1:04:27] he is still the lord our healer
[1:04:31] he would permit those things so that
[1:04:33] they could come to trust him
[1:04:37] doesn't that sound like us many times
[1:04:41] always trying to figure out
[1:04:44] your way of doing everything
[1:04:48] but i'm guilty of that
[1:04:51] you're hunting and i look up that
[1:04:52] mountain
[1:04:58] we were hunting one year and that was
[1:05:00] casano
[1:05:02] it was so bad establishment was mark and
[1:05:05] omar who else was with us biola was with
[1:05:08] us
[1:05:11] killed two elk down in the canyon
[1:05:16] and the next day we had to go back down
[1:05:18] and pull out another one yes
[1:05:22] we're all a bit queasy just thinking of
[1:05:25] it made us feel bad
[1:05:31] couldn't make it funny got the second
[1:05:33] one
[1:05:34] alfie
[1:05:45] [Music]
[1:05:49] that's it it gets tiring
[1:05:52] it's gonzalo we always look for an
[1:05:54] easier way of doing things
[1:05:57] you're in the middle of a canyon you're
[1:05:58] thinking
[1:06:00] like a helicopter just come yesterday
[1:06:09] and then at that moment you start
[1:06:10] thinking about maybe i should buy horses
[1:06:15] so i can have them all year long and
[1:06:17] never use them
[1:06:19] they're always trying to find some an
[1:06:21] easier way and there's nothing wrong
[1:06:22] with trying to find an easier way
[1:06:26] many times there are easier ways of
[1:06:27] doing things
[1:06:30] there is no easy
[1:06:35] there's no easy way or a different way
[1:06:38] of receiving the holy ghost
[1:06:43] i am the way jesus
[1:07:12] trust how much do we
[1:07:16] really trust him question we can ask
[1:07:19] ourselves
[1:07:22] three five and six tells us
[1:07:25] the lord with
[1:07:31] [Applause]
[1:07:40] but in all
[1:07:54] is
[1:08:08] children of israel
[1:08:22] think
[1:08:35] he shall direct thy
[1:08:49] they become servants
[1:08:53] to that master
[1:08:56] do you get that church look up i'm going
[1:08:58] to say it again if
[1:09:00] god has a way but i try to go another
[1:09:04] way
[1:09:25] that to whom ye yield yourselves
[1:09:27] servants to obey
[1:09:31] his servants ye are
[1:10:01] matthew 6 24 if you want to write it
[1:10:03] down matteo says
[1:10:04] no man he says he says i want everybody
[1:10:07] to repeat with me
[1:10:08] no man he said you that's me that's
[1:10:12] anybody
[1:10:14] no man
[1:10:21] i want you to get it again no man
[1:10:25] no man can serve two masters
[1:10:40] and he says you cannot serve god
[1:10:54] means wealth
[1:11:11] it's a miserly desire
[1:11:14] to gain hoard wealth
[1:11:20] my here we are
[1:11:24] and they're closed didn't wear out
[1:11:28] watch where we're going here
[1:11:33] hoarding wealth
[1:11:38] money as we've heard many times
[1:11:51] the greek word is phil arguria la
[1:11:54] palabra
[1:11:56] which means the love of money yes
[1:11:59] and the love of money is the root of all
[1:12:03] evil my father would tell me
[1:12:06] my father
[1:12:20] think about that for a moment because
[1:12:23] many times
[1:12:24] that becomes our master yes
[1:12:27] and when we are we have become or we
[1:12:30] have another master
[1:12:32] then we have to wear the garment of a
[1:12:34] servant
[1:12:39] come on i want you to get this this
[1:12:40] morning
[1:12:42] you get another master you know you
[1:12:44] gotta wear a different clothes
[1:12:46] wear different clothes the clothing of a
[1:12:50] servant
[1:12:54] watch where we're going with this now
[1:12:57] and the holy spirit
[1:12:59] said he told me this yesterday
[1:13:05] why they are still servants to so many
[1:13:08] things
[1:13:11] when by now they should be masters of
[1:13:13] them
[1:13:16] so i tell
[1:13:28] your garments are showing who your
[1:13:31] master is
[1:13:34] did you get that church i want you to
[1:13:36] get i want to drive it home this morning
[1:13:39] garments show who your master is
[1:13:42] we can try to say that we are this or
[1:13:44] that
[1:13:58] is
[1:14:13] had if you had holes in your clothes
[1:14:21] mama would get your jeans
[1:14:28] i think one time somebody got a patch
[1:14:31] with marijuana
[1:14:32] flower on it
[1:14:35] marijuana i guess they didn't know what
[1:14:36] it was maybe they did i don't know
[1:14:39] this is like
[1:14:55] you pay hundreds of dollars sometimes
[1:15:00] or or jeans
[1:15:04] whatever with with holes
[1:15:07] and they're just coming apart at the
[1:15:09] scene
[1:15:10] they're walking around and then i'm like
[1:15:12] you like it it's okay i'm not speaking
[1:15:14] against that okay
[1:15:16] but i'm like you know when i was young
[1:15:18] that was no no
[1:15:23] that's her heart i got this idea from
[1:15:27] one of the sisters
[1:15:29] she got all my jeans and she and she she
[1:15:32] she
[1:15:33] sewed the the crease she sewed it all
[1:15:36] the way down
[1:15:45] [Laughter]
[1:15:49] but it's easier to iron so leave it
[1:15:51] alone
[1:15:54] we were poor so we had to that's what we
[1:15:57] had so that's what we did
[1:15:59] that's what we were given when we look
[1:16:02] at that
[1:16:04] we
[1:16:13] once again he says tell my people
[1:16:16] why are they still servants to so many
[1:16:19] people
[1:16:20] so many things forgive me they should be
[1:16:23] masters of them
[1:16:30] you say brother i'm not a servant to
[1:16:32] nothing he said
[1:16:46] let me see how many of you have a temper

[1:17:26] this going on
[1:17:27] because we are servants to
[1:17:42] he says tell them why they're still
[1:17:44] servants to their anger

[1:23:57] first timothy 6 5 through 11.
[1:24:02] perverse disputing i'm going to read it
[1:24:03] just in english to save time
[1:24:05] perverse disputings of men of corrupt
[1:24:07] minds and destitute of the truth
[1:24:10] supposing that gain is godliness from
[1:24:13] such withdraw thyself
[1:24:17] you can you can repeat this now or
[1:24:19] translate it
[1:24:20] people want to measure
[1:24:23] how blessed they are how many
[1:24:26] possessions they have
[1:24:43] we we might have this or that does not
[1:24:45] mean that oh god is really blessing me
[1:24:47] he says i am in the perfect will of god
[1:24:50] look at what he's doing
[1:24:53] that's not the way to gauge it
[1:24:58] godliness with contentment
[1:25:01] is great gain
[1:25:04] for we brought nothing into this world
[1:25:07] and it is certain
[1:25:08] we carry nothing out amen
[1:25:12] and having food enragement
[1:25:15] or clothing let us there with
[1:25:19] let us be there with content

[1:25:53] many foolish and hurtful lusts which
[1:25:56] drown men in destruction and perdition

[1:26:04] more money you get equal
[1:26:06] hi

[1:26:32] christmas every day watch what he says
[1:26:35] here
[1:26:38] for the love of money is the root of all
[1:26:40] evil
[1:26:42] which while some coveted after they have
[1:26:45] erred
[1:26:46] from the faith watch now
[1:26:49] they've aired from the faith which faith
[1:26:51] is what
[1:26:54] perfect faith is the master of all
[1:26:56] circumstances
[1:26:59] they have erred from the faith and
[1:27:02] pierced themselves through with many
[1:27:04] sorrows
[1:27:07] but thou oh man of god
[1:27:13] oh i like that when i look in the mirror
[1:27:16] and it says thou
[1:27:44] come on come on put yourself there or
[1:27:47] the love of money is the root of all
[1:27:48] evil brother branham says
[1:27:52] keep away from that stuff
[1:27:56] i always know brother brown says
[1:27:59] weakness of ministers
[1:28:02] that usually takes them out of the
[1:28:05] harness of
[1:28:05] god is money
[1:28:11] ministers too we get it
[1:28:19] and that which fell among thorns are
[1:28:21] they
[1:28:23] which when they have heard
[1:28:26] go forth and are choked with cares
[1:28:29] and riches and pleasures of this life
[1:28:33] and bring no fruit to perfection
[1:28:42] it doesn't say they don't bring no fruit
[1:28:44] noise it cannot drain because everything
[1:28:46] brings fourth of its kind does not
[1:28:49] bring forth fruit unto perfection
[1:28:53] a perfection my goodness
[1:28:56] do you see when we rely
[1:28:59] god's telling us don't have you can't
[1:29:01] have two masters
[1:29:03] because once you rely on someone
[1:29:06] right you become the servant to that
[1:29:11] and instead he wants us to rely on
[1:29:14] solely on him
[1:29:18] or when the love of money is what
[1:29:20] motivates us
[1:29:30] [Music]
[1:29:34] because now i want this and i want that
[1:29:36] and i have this and i got to have that
[1:29:38] or i'm not happy
[1:29:40] you're a million miles from the from the
[1:29:42] kingdom of god
[1:29:45] nothing wrong as humans i understand
[1:29:47] they're saying oh i would like that
[1:29:49] if god wants to add that to me and
[1:29:51] praise the lord
[1:29:53] but when i go in debt try to get that
[1:29:56] but watch it now that master is going to
[1:30:00] wear you out
[1:30:03] because now you're always on pins and
[1:30:05] needles
[1:30:07] you're always worried how am i going to
[1:30:08] make the payments
[1:30:10] how am i going to do this come on church
[1:30:12] we become servants
[1:30:14] we become servants to our debt we become
[1:30:18] servants to our lustful desires
[1:30:21] in the midst of it all god's saying
[1:30:25] i have a way you're thinking why aren't
[1:30:28] you following me
[1:30:32] i can't sleep at night
[1:30:36] because you're a servant
[1:30:43] whipping the left and right there people
[1:30:46] getting whipped
[1:31:11] you got to work two jobs three jobs
[1:31:13] three quarters
[1:31:26] unto you and this is just in english now
[1:31:28] take no thought for your life
[1:31:31] what ye shall eat or what you shall
[1:31:34] drink
[1:31:35] nor yet for your body what ye shall put
[1:31:39] on
[1:31:41] i got clothes that you know nothing
[1:31:53] and the body and the raiment
[1:31:57] behold the fowls of the air for they so
[1:31:59] not
[1:32:00] neither do they reap nor gather into
[1:32:03] barns yet your
[1:32:04] heavenly father feeded them are you not
[1:32:07] much
[1:32:08] better than they wherefore if god
[1:32:11] so clothed the grass of the field
[1:32:14] which today is and tomorrow is cast into
[1:32:16] the oven shall he not much more
[1:32:19] clothe you o ye of little faith and
[1:32:26] their clothes
[1:32:27] and their shoes
[1:32:33] therefore take no thought why you're
[1:32:34] gonna what you shall eat or what you
[1:32:36] shall drink verse 31
[1:32:38] or whether or whether or where with all
[1:32:41] ye
[1:32:41] shall be clothed for all these things do
[1:32:44] the gentiles seek
[1:32:46] or your heavenly father knoweth that ye
[1:32:48] have need of all these things
[1:32:50] but seek ye first the kingdom of god
[1:32:55] and his righteousness
[1:32:57] [Music]
[1:32:58] and all these other things
[1:33:02] shall be added to you let me tell you
[1:33:06] something
[1:33:07] when god adds you a new car
[1:33:10] you'll make sure that you always have
[1:33:13] what it what you need to pay a payment
[1:33:15] every month
[1:33:17] god gives you a new house he'll make
[1:33:19] sure that he provides
[1:34:01] shall take thought for the things of
[1:34:02] itself
[1:34:04] sufficient unto the day is the evil
[1:34:06] thereof
[1:34:09] when i think of valley forge brother
[1:34:11] branham says
[1:34:14] george washington george washington
[1:34:16] two-thirds of
[1:34:31] men with no shoes bought
[1:34:34] to give us the economy that we have
[1:34:37] today
[1:34:41] that's why i was talking about last
[1:34:42] sunday
[1:34:44] economical
[1:34:54] they went after what their ideas were
[1:35:25] glory to god but they gave their lives
[1:35:30] the economy we have paracetamol
[1:35:37] and then america sells out what is
[1:35:39] american americans
[1:36:08] i have no idea when i started you know
[1:36:11] but that's okay
[1:36:12] there are no aspects to keep on going
[1:36:13] today
[1:36:16] money should never be our purchasing
[1:36:19] power el nino nunca
[1:36:37] is that not just the millionaires will
[1:36:38] have to give an account for the
[1:36:40] millions of dollars they've spent
[1:36:44] every single one of us for every
[1:36:48] penny he has put in our hands
[1:37:05] this morning
[1:37:09] money should never be our purchasing
[1:37:11] power
[1:37:14] from god for there is only
[1:37:18] one healer
[1:37:32] god
[1:38:00] what
[1:38:12] they accidentally dropped a coin
[1:38:28] he said now peter probably would have
[1:38:30] caught the fish
[1:38:34] in his mouth jesus said
[1:38:37] go and catch that fish look at his mouth
[1:38:41] what kind of money we need
[1:39:07] do you see what the holy ghost was
[1:39:09] telling us on wednesday
[1:39:26] by breaking bread and multiplying it
[1:39:32] how is that greater than what he's doing
[1:39:33] today
[1:39:36] the question is how many would have
[1:39:39] loved to have been there with jesus
[1:39:43] fed 5 000.
[1:39:47] i would have loved to have been there
[1:39:50] spent every bit of my time just sitting
[1:39:52] at his feet
[1:40:21] breaking and multiplying the bread
[1:40:22] element
[1:40:25] greater than what he's doing right now
[1:40:28] watch our mind this is why we're hearing
[1:40:30] on wednesday what's the mentality
[1:40:34] if i stood here this morning
[1:40:37] and this was a loaf of bread and i would
[1:40:40] get this and i'd
[1:40:41] rip it and right before your eyes
[1:40:46] the loaf would come whole again
[1:41:22] watch this now pikacy we're doing
[1:41:24] something that was done
[1:41:28] watch this now but somehow
[1:41:33] people think it lesser la gente pizza
[1:41:36] listen
[1:41:36] close listen to me this morning we think
[1:41:39] it lesser
[1:41:41] quest when we have prayed as a body of
[1:41:44] believers
[1:41:57] 20 000
[1:42:12] i would have loved to have been there
[1:42:14] two thousand years ago
[1:42:16] but he placed us here today and we are
[1:42:20] seen with our own eyes multiply the
[1:42:23] bread
[1:42:24] multiplication multiply the fun
[1:42:26] multiplication
[1:42:34] [Applause]
[1:42:36] jesus is not just worried about our
[1:42:38] spiritual being even though that's the
[1:42:40] most important
[1:42:59] but millions are hearing the message
[1:43:02] every single day
[1:43:05] provided the radio program or the radio
[1:43:22] thousands of message books have been
[1:43:24] printed
[1:43:26] and this is just us yesterday that's all
[1:43:29] the other brothers around the world that
[1:43:31] are doing and doing for the kingdom
[1:43:36] so that we can say oh look what we're
[1:43:37] doing
[1:43:39] if i ever have that attitude i would not
[1:43:42] send another dime over there
[1:43:44] because that's not about look what our
[1:43:46] church is doing
[1:43:49] we think that way that's the most
[1:44:12] if i have just a little bit of time that
[1:44:13] i can get into something that i really
[1:44:15] want yeah
[1:44:17] watch this now i
[1:44:30] if it doesn't go down
[1:44:59] open our eyes and you'll see the same
[1:45:01] lord jesus
[1:45:03] working through his body
[1:45:07] people online standing
[1:45:10] sending him love offerings just help and
[1:45:14] send this
[1:45:15] this work is not it's not just ours
[1:45:18] it's part of the body of christ that is
[1:45:20] producing this
[1:45:23] one of you for what you have given and
[1:45:24] what you're giving
[1:45:28] and i want to tell you that our shoes
[1:45:29] and our clothes have not worn out

[1:45:39] we have men like brother anthony anthony
[1:45:42] i appreciate the lord i appreciate the
[1:45:44] lord for all of you
[1:45:47] but the lord put someone in his path to
[1:45:49] distribute and donate food
[1:45:53] he never hoarded it to himself
[1:45:57] he said where can we who can we give it
[1:46:00] to you
[1:46:02] he knew god had god knew that he had a
[1:46:04] heart for the people
[1:46:07] many here have been supplemented in
[1:46:09] their homes
[1:46:24] a little to somebody talking about money
[1:46:27] that's the easiest thing
[1:46:30] give up yourself

[1:46:35] have received that god has brought you
[1:46:37] through

[1:54:26] a great three and a half years in glory
[1:54:31] in glory they won't have to go through

[1:54:42] let me tell you something the bride of
[1:54:44] christ
[1:54:48] she knows how to buy
[1:54:57] and just study these at home read them
[1:55:00] give us of your oil
[1:55:02] our lamps are gone
[1:55:13] rather to them that sell and buy for
[1:55:16] yourselves
[1:55:18] and while they went to buy me
[1:55:22] the bridegroom came and they that were
[1:55:25] ready went in with him to the marriage
[1:55:29] door was shot
[1:55:41] [Applause]
[1:55:43] she is given precious
[1:56:20] praise god he doesn't leave anybody out
[1:56:23] and he's that they have no money
[1:56:39] without money in dinero and without
[1:56:43] price it's impressive
[1:56:45] what a promise he's inviting you come
[1:56:48] here
[1:56:51] how do you buy without money
[1:56:54] easy
[1:56:58] study currency and money a little bit
[1:57:00] and you'll get it
[1:57:04] but we need to afford something i owe
[1:57:07] him my life
[1:57:49] growing up i heard so many stories
[1:57:53] my father on the mission field
[1:57:57] and as a child i i knew nothing just the
[1:58:00] things i would hear about
[1:58:01] sacrifices that he had made
[1:58:04] sacrificing and every time he went out
[1:58:07] he
[1:58:08] it was a sacrifice
[1:58:12] yet we sacrificed along with him at the
[1:58:14] home
[1:58:15] sacrifice any of you sacrificed which
[1:58:18] was there
[1:58:19] many of you you moved where he you
[1:58:21] followed him wherever he would go
[1:58:26] sacrificed your families sacrifices
[1:58:30] god don't forget those things
[1:58:46] but that never stopped him from going
[1:58:48] out and preaching
[1:58:51] what an example that was to me
[1:58:55] i'd be familiar with all those that
[1:58:57] would see him
[1:58:59] he didn't take money because he didn't
[1:59:01] have any no
[1:59:03] and i didn't understand that until i
[1:59:05] until recently
[1:59:08] that it was a fulfillment of scripture
[1:59:11] if we can't find ourselves in the
[1:59:13] scripture we got to go back and read it
[1:59:14] or we got to get a closer look
[1:59:18] but i want you to to get this now we all
[1:59:22] sacrificed
[1:59:24] he would eat wherever they would feed
[1:59:27] him
[1:59:29] he would sleep wherever he could find a
[1:59:31] place or in his car
[1:59:35] he would give everything he had
[1:59:46] then i understood the scripture that the
[1:59:48] lord gave me
[1:59:49] you know i'm going to go back and just
[1:59:52] just paraphrase it real quick
[2:00:02] there is no man that hath left house and
[2:00:07] brethren
[2:00:09] and on and on it goes
[2:00:24] a hundredfold search that in the
[2:00:27] scriptures
[2:00:29] search a hundredfold what it really
[2:00:30] means
[2:00:33] that's what we have seen is a
[2:00:36] hundredfold of
[2:00:38] souls coming in
[2:00:42] and as i read this and i began to see
[2:00:45] the story of peter and john at the gate
[2:00:47] called beautiful
[2:00:49] pedro they said the same thing silver
[2:00:51] and gold we don't have
[2:00:54] but what we do have we give to you
[2:00:58] silver and gold we have none
[2:01:02] but what we do have this morning we do
[2:01:04] give to you
[2:01:06] as i was contemplating this yesterday
[2:01:11] the lord says look at the first
[2:01:13] commission
