========================================

from Philippians the second chapter one to eight and second Corinthians three the game was six and reading into the fourth chapter of second Corinthians just for a background now in Philippians second chapter I will read first before reading let's pray Lord Jesus the word is truth and in this troublesome hour that we're living nation against nation pestilence earthquakes in many places man's hearts failing fear we see the handwriting on the wall now that is in a natural reading that all the world should see this but now there is a spiritual Ram also and we see the great happenings and we're going to speak of them today bless thy word our heart we know that there's no man in heaven or in earth is worthy to take this book to loose the seals are to look up on it even but there was one appeared a slain lamb bloody that came and talked to the book and was worthy and able now in I want to read from Philippians the second chapter one two eight and second Corinthians three the game was six and reading into the fourth chapter of second Corinthians just for a background now in Philippians 2nd chapter I will read first before reading this pray Lord Jesus the Word is truth and in this troublesome hour that we're living nation against nation pestilence earthquakes in many places man's hearts failing fear we see the handwriting on the wall now that is in a natural reading that all the world should see this but now there is a spiritual Ram also and we see the great happenings and we're going to speak of them today bless I were to our heart we know that there's no man in heaven on earth is worthy to take this book the loose the seals are to look up on it even but there was one up here to slay land bloody that came and took to the book and was worthy and able to open it Oh Lamb of God open thy word our hearts today for comfort we are your servants forgive our sins or anything that would keep the word from going forward with great power and influence today our own lies take it away Lord any hindrance that we might have full access to all the blessings promised to us through that word we asked it in Jesus name Amen [Music] Philippians 2 if there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the Spirit if any bowels of Mercy fulfil my joy that edie like-minded having the same love being a water card of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem the other better than themselves look not every man to his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which also was in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of man and being found in passion of a man he humbled himself and became obedient to death even the death of the cross now if we shall turn now over to 2nd Corinthians the 3rd chapter we will begin with the sixth verse and reading this to the 18th and down to part of the 4th chapter who also has made us able ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life but if the administration of death written and engraved in stones was glorious so that the surety of Israel could not stedfastly of all the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which glory wants to be done away how shall not the administration of the Spirit be rather glorious for if the ministration of condemnation be bores much more does the administration of righteousness exceed in glory or even that which was made glorious has Old Glory in this respect by reasons all the glory that itself or if that which is not away was glorious much more have which remaineth is glorious in n that we have such a hope we must greatly - of speech used rate - a speech and not as Moses which put a veil over his face that the children of Israel cannot steadfastly look to the end of that wish was abolished but their minds were blinded or until this stage remained the same thing untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which Bale is done away in Christ but even under this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their hearts never less when it shall be turned to the Lord the veil shall be taken away now the Lord is that spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord there is Liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord has changed into the same image from glory unto glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint not but have renown see hidden things and the dishonest not walking in craftiness and handling the Word of God deceit Lee but by manifestation of the truth condemning ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them which are lost may the Lord and His blessings to the reading of his word now by subject this morning I trust that God will reveal this and each time if you who take the tapes and listen hope and trust that that you have had a spiritual understanding a lot that God has been is trying to get over to the church without saying it right out think it some things sometimes we have to say things in such a way that it might pin down if I bring song to go out some to leave and some to ponder over but that's done purposely it must be done that way then it might be as I'm going to say you mean God would purposely do a thing like that he's certain he said one day when he had thousands around him he said except you eat of the flesh of the son of God son man and drink his blood and alive in you what kind of statement do you think the medical doctor or nurse or any fine intellectual person would think of in a statement like that bro man that had a ministry right he had why he would say eat the flesh that's cannibal to drink human blood it's a vampire in other words he wants us to be cannibals and vampires and the whole audience walked away from me and there was a ministerial association with a demon 70 that had been chosen and he turned to them and he said what would you think when you see the Son of Man ascending up from where he came from now he didn't explain that you never explained how Paul did that later on he just said it and then when this he said what will you say to these ministers when you see the Sun man ascending up from where he came from no doubt that man said not just at the moment or we eat with him we fish with him we sleep with him we know where he was born we see the crazy lady he was rocked in and how does this man this is a hard scene and the eye dated walk with unity or their lefty then he had 12 left he chose twelve in one of them was a deadly said so he turned to them and there's no one could explain what he had just said how are they going to eat his flesh and drink his blood and how did he come down when he was born I got her see they couldn't understand it and he turned to the apostles he said do you want to go also and that's why the Apostle Peter made a great statement Lord to whom would we go or we are satisfied we know surely that you and you don't have a word of life is nothing and we're set aside of that see they could not explain it they you can't explain faith is something that you believe and it's so solid that there's nothing else or take its place therefore they know that the word that was written from that age that they were living in the masai age that he fit that place exactly and what could they do to go back in that cold formal churches that have been coming out of said where would we go to see we are fully persuaded and you have the world line and they they couldn't explain it but they believed it see and Jesus said that to weed down his crown hey do you get the group together and out of all those people they only 11 of a man understood Ashley who he was they know that he was gone and gone home now there my son Keith this morning is to reveal or unveil that God God as always in every age has hid behind a veil all ages but he's been God all the time but he's can be self heed from the world and reveals itself to his elected like the apostles of that day now that was God speaking in Christ now man as always it's been the nature man he's sought to see physically that God he's always wanted to see it man is made creatures of the backing they think of a the Indians worship the Sun and we find Africa of different forms of animals and so forth enough of the totem poles of Alaska and different farms that they think this God is in as Paul spoke there at Athens that time on Mars Hill and told them that they were superstitious concerning this unknown God and they know he was there but their right mind a lot knows there's got to be something somewhere and huh Joe wanted a tall team I want you to notice the deform that God chose to talk to Jovi God was bailed when he talked to Joel he was veiled in a whirlwind came down in a world you me the God still comes in a world there's several sitting here a number that was witness to the day when he came in a world we told us the day before brother banks would stand when he said to take up this rock throw it up in the air and say thus saith the Lord you will see it right away and then I picked up the rock up on top of the mountain do it up in the air and the course is coming down and start the whirlwind see the suction of it you have to do something to cause something to follow it Jesus talk of a piece of the bread he broke it then multiplied from that piece of the bread he took water poured it into a pitcher he lied you took salt put it in a Cruz cut out a stick throw it on the water it is something to sing on and picking out this and thought it in the air and coming down started the whirlwind the next day while there was a minister with us on a hunting trip he was standing close to he said the Lord get visions out like this brother brown eyes that yes but I used to come out your arrest and just send the vision keen and brother borders he's outside now he was along brother the bank's woods I'm thinking oh several ones up there eight or ten and brother the banks was watching for this right on the mountain right across from exactly about 1/2 mile were the seven angels that appeared at a lecture go therefore come back and told about the seven seals just about a half a mile from that and then the next stage when this was going on while the I said to brother this brother I said watch your trouble you've got an allergy in your eye the doctors just ride for a couple of years of stopping and he came to the city or go let's go eat your I'll and I've said before wearing the Lord Jesus is a larger pain and he just got this gun and I said you're a mother what she was and what was wrong with her and he said that's the truth brother Roy Roberson for the church sandy prison I guess all you know knowing he went to the bachelor in a norm hop it was going to take place above a hand on his shoulder I said brother listen be careful watch something fishing to happen I walk back to where I'm supposed to be standing and out of the air came a whirlwind down to a canyon from above that was so great totally the tour rocks a tortillas a through out of the top of the mountain in the two hundred yards out in and plat three times like that and the voice came from all of them standing there brother debates president now he boasted that was what she told me yes I said yes that's it he said huh what did it say I said it now that's just for me to know brother they see the calls it was it was a long people but it went ahead it happened just a little traveling awkward little few days later it hit the ocean and you see my hat around Farraday he said it was an adjustment of sign now we behind it thank God still panics and so then the head to head habit see this has to happen in the veins it's got to have it got have an enemy these what happened in Moses one hand desired to see God and God told me to stand on the rock and on the rock Moses stood in he's seen God passed by and his back look like the back of a man dog was in a whirlwind God wobbles is standing on the rock I guess y'all see the picture out there the day we stood by that same rock and here's that light the easel or died our destiny got a little more there now again notice Jehovah are the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament he is the same God just changing his form and someone said yeah a Baptist minister out in Tucson how can you say that Jesus and God would be the same person I said well it's very easy if you just let your own thinking get away and think the Bible terms of it they are the self same be God is a spirit Jesus is the body that he was Bailey I said like in my home to my wife I am her husband I have a young daughter Rebecca I am her father and I have a grandson and his name is Paul I am his grandfather I am husband father and grandfather and my wife has no claims on me as father or grandfather she has claims on me alone as husband and my daughter has old claims on me as husband or grandfather she is my child see but yet all these three persons is the same person hey that's God Father Son and Holy Ghost is just a dispensation clean God is saying the same God God changed himself Jesus his farm if you know shirt Philippians he said not fake it robbery but took the farm of man now the Greek word there for that form of a look at it all day yesterday trying to think out what it was a fine coming with this word of a mafia it's spelled E in mor Phe looking into Greek to find out what it Martha was I'm a pronounce that wrong but at least I spell it whether the tape is released their people stars will know what I mean by he one day my Pia that means that he changed his self he come down how the Greek word there means that something that could not be seen yet it's air and that is changed and I can catch it see like Elijah was a dolphin Ziza the servant couldn't see all those angels around there and God just changed not broke the Angels down but he changed the scene of the sermon and there I was the mountains full easels and barn horses of the bar chariots of the bar all around is prophet see they change the scene that the thing is already there so that what I'm trying to say that God that always was is here the only thing he done want to become man he changed his mask he he this 'martha he changed himself to what he was to what he is or is man another act like in a great drama as I was speaking this morning you kind of catching up on this of Shakespeare in a long time but when Shakespeare wrote the drama the Farah King James of England when he the character of Macbeth see Shakespeare did not believe in witches but in the plate for the King didn't believe in witches so he had to include witches see and now in order to do this they changed the cast Becky here and Carmen they acted that and in the school where she just graduated a few weeks ago now maybe one person played three or four parts and in order to do that he changed his mask sometimes he comes out he's this character and the next time he comes out he's another character but it is the same person all the time and that's God he changed you sell from from a pillar of fire they become a man then change himself from that back in the spirit again that he might dwell in man God acting in man what he really was Jesus Christ was God acting in man in a man in a man that's why he was he changed from the pillar of fire and then it come in which was a veil in the wilderness that hid God from Israel Moses seen the shape of his body but really he was hid all the time behind this pillar of fire which was the longest it went from God now we find here now since Pentecost God is not acting in man or act in eyes acting room and think he was acting in a man named Jesus now is acting through man that he has chosen for this purpose God in the form of man he changed himself from the form of of a god to a form of man he came in three names three sons names he came in the son name of the son of man the son of David and the son of God three sons names and I came first in the son of day a son of man because he was a prophet now Jehovah himself called Ezekiel and the prophets son of man what see us now Jesus never referred to himself as son of God he referred to himself as son of mainly because the Scriptures cannot be broken there can be nothing broken in the scriptures every word must be so that's the way that I believe it that's why it's got to be not because I believe it because it's a Word of God now if you notice in the beginning one word page one in the Bible in Genesis 1 we find out that the whole all the sickness all the sorrow all the heartaches and everything that's ever happened to human beings came because one person disbelieve one word caused all this that's the first to the Bible in the last of the Bible revelations 22 the same God said whosoever shall take one word out of this or add one word to it see it must be word by word just so area so therefore I just take the little thing like I'm going someone always going over to you about the women bobbing their hair not to me as long as she does that I don't care saintly she doesn't know how much she knows she's still wrong she wears shorts and these poles like it I don't care what she does how much she can sing how well she can preach whatever she could do what kind of life she is it's still that one words broke see it's got to be every word not a sentence a word one word so the Bible is no private interpretation it must be word by word the way it's written we must believe that and not only believe it but live it if we don't live it then we don't believe it we just say we do like a basin back to one I said those disciples could not explain it but they believed it anyhow and they made their confession and live to it when all the rest of walked away from it they stayed with it they believed it that's the way we do that's where you got to do it no matter what anybody else does we believe it and then we act upon it if you don't do it then you don't believe it [Music] wherever you may find yourself at this morning the Lord Jesus Christ bless right there and that is the Lord gonna ask you to Dan yeah they're in white prayed to the Lord as we open up this service for Jesus that was here two thousand years me would be with us
