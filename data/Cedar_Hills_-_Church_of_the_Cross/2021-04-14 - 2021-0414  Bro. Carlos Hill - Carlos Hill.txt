wrestle with them and we struggle for him and we love him like crazy i'm amen amen amen amen amen let's get straight away into the word of god tonight it's uh we're going to be reading the book of of hebrews chapter 6 evreyos capitulo says verse 1 verse the word of god reads therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ the let's let's bow our heads for a word of prayer most gracious heavenly father lord father father it's a privilege lord jesus to be here in your house father to feel the anointing that's behind this desk lord to feel the love of the holy spirit to fellowship and

interpreter [Music] and father that you would just use us in whatever way you see fit all these things we ask in your precious and most holy name the name of the lord jesus christ so tonight i i i i have this this thought is we work with these the young people they fight a war that that i don't think i i could have thought the day and age they live in is is unbelievably evil and and so i asked the lord i said lord what can i do what else can i do how can we help them is there something lord that that we're not doing that that's not being done help me lord says and as i began to to to to pray to the lord and as i began to read it a little more and a little bit more lolita you know as as parents we fight a battle just as hard as they do nosotros and our battle starts at the moment that they're born and our battle continues on through their life and a large part of the battle that we fight as parents and young people it's very important that you guys understand this a large part of the battle that we fight as parents for you guys is just to get you guys to the principles of the doctrines of christ principles and it's a fight that parents fight yes because brother branham doesn't miss it when he tells us that a lot of times we just want to fight is to try to get you guys to the principles yes and the doctrines of christ because that's your launching off point i always brag about you guys to your parents and the pastor and everybody i talked to about you guys different personas and i always say if you ask the young people just about any question in terms of the principles and doctrines they can answer you in heartbeat what's the first thing you need to look for in a husband yes character and they can they can give us the principles and the doctrines all day long but but i want you guys to understand something let me start off by saying well done i want to give parents and and young people please give each other a hand because you've reached the principles of the doctrines of christ brother sham would you grab that stuff for me from the back please but but i want you guys to understand something the principles and the doctrines of christ they're simply this simple hold on it's coming got it for me brother sam do i see that that's a kiddie pool principles in the doctrines of christ they bring you to the kiddie pool of christianity and it's a very comfortable place to be here yes you see because when when i'm in the kiddie pool of christianity i can get my safety llama and i i know jesus christ is a savior jose christo el salvador and i know all the awesome basics of christianity right christianity i know that i should look for character and a husband or your wife i but but here's the problem guys here aki there aren't any storms here okay i really kind of don't need god all that much in reality because you see right here i've got the principles and the doctrines that can sort of govern what i do is doctrine comes right but i want you to know something there was another there was another man in the bible that had the principles and the doctrines of christ and we find out that in the book of luke chapter five that that jesus comes to simon jesus vienna and noticed that simon had been fishing all night long and he had nothing in his boat you know another and he was depressed and he was really beat up and he was sad and he was tired and here comes jesus jesus and jesus says simon jesus simone simon looks up out of his boat says hi jesus hola jesus simon he said simon i want to show you something and simon says he see monday lord i've been fishing all night i i'm really tired i'd just like to go home and go to bed and jesus says simon jesus simon i want to show you something and simon knew the principles in the doctrines of christ simone you see the way that they fished in those days and it would sort of pin the fish between the bottom of the sea ponies and then the net then the net would close around the fish is simon turns the boat around simon he says hold on simon says simon simon launch out lanzate come on guys come on he's almost simon this is simone chow watch out to the deep jesus and you find something so tremendous because you see the problem is is that as long as we stay in the kiddie pool of christianity we will never find what the book of psalms tells us why is it that the lord is telling simon simon launch out into the deep sea book of psalms 42 7 tells us when it's nice do you know what a water spout is but is the one thing that you don't brother carlos carlos but listen because it's the holy spirit telling you [Applause] and he gets simon and they go out to the he never went around on the and it wasn't because the disciples didn't know the sea of galileans until you're when you feel like that you find the one we want to make major life oh you guys are fine you got this [Music] amen don't make your life decisions from kiddie pools stop thinking you know on your own you know what another thing the water spout is even though you guys can't possibly see you yelankel you could get in the pool at all kinds of times but if you wanted results you had to wait for the angels and if you got in there first he said but it wasn't the shallow little little little little kid [Music] and the waters are troubled oh and it went over your head why because when you're in the water that deep water [Applause] it stabilizes that but let me explain something to you because the anchor is always greater than the storm and the holy spirit begins on sunday and he wants to baptize you with but you see it's fine to go out into the deep oh yes jesus it is fine to go out into the deep yes but the prophet jeremiah takes it one step further because the prophet jeremiah takes it one step further and he says the prophet jeremiah takes it and he says now that you've launched it he says he says [Applause] and you dwell the harder that anchor uh we gotta then every wind of doctrine that comes across [Applause] that's i'm going to tell you this and i'm going to tell you this and i'm going to tell you this don't make life decisions until you've gone to the deep yeah how many times have you guys asked questions what's my purpose what am i doing here where where am i supposed to go and here's jesus on your boat come on almost come on young people almost overness launch out no child but i want you to notice something was so tremendous jesus sent simon to the deep jesus there's ministers here i mean there's parents here there is a man who's the guide of this church he knows the deep he knows um that god has provided why because he sees you okay so brother ben no i'm just kidding you're starting to get the bandsaw you get real disoriented oh me mariello and you feel really out of it you're just and what's happening your blood is boiling inside your body and he's watching you carefully but we're used to kiddie pool christianity right where we want to make the rules but the dive instructor says wait hold on hold on maybe now we need the baptism of the holy spirit now let's call for the noise of the water spout let's call for the noise it's a special noise that the water spout begins to make it i know it's not an easy job but it begins to move and as it begins to move it you feel uncomfortable right i don't know what that is but the diving structure says did you stay calm here he comes and of the holy spirit don't lose sight of your dive instructor no no pieres you need your anchor necessitas that's what you guys need that's what you like it's not it's not crazy it's not wild you just need to go deeper no solamete tenesquirmas profundo you guys don't get it you guys don't get it leaving the principles in the doctrine the economy [Applause] aren't you tired but [Applause] you want to solve your problems get it get in don't be satisfied where you're at don't stop seeking his face don't assume that you know enough to get of believing that you're more than equipped you think that the holy spirit doesn't have you guys here for a reason you think the holy spirit's not mindful of what you're dealing with you think that you're alone you're wrong that's right so my challenge to you guys who's brave dive instructors right there the dive crew all the ministers they're right there let's go vamos you know how to fix the problem now you know what and say that you weren't so are you ready estan listos come on young people almost over this i'm tired of watching people live i'm tired of losing my young people if you guys don't belong to anybody else but me and the pastor and the ministers look around you you belong to us nino so parents at home casa let's take them to the deer let's get them where they gotta go and if we don't have the strength let's find somebody who's got it but guys i'm telling you right now we're going to the this youth group is that you have never seen before you're gonna go so deep that when the devil passes over he won't even be able to stop letting the devil tell you that you know enough about god and let's go deep let's go hide in this world vamos escondos it's time to recognize your pastor pastor the ministry el ministerio it's time to recognize what your parents are estimated we make a lot of mistakes sometimes as parents the parents sometimes we need to ask their forgiveness for you need the two fellows in the ship a lot of times we don't even know what goes on in our kids lives i'm because that's where it's all pouring into uh you can't go to the deep with a leaky boat you just can't you know you gotta start closing the gap gaps young people openness that's what the holy spirit wants from you too get rid of the pain and the hurt that you feel in your heart they the the all the things that that we do because i don't like what my parents told me because you don't dwell deep enough especially and maybe they've gone there and back in there and back in there and back
