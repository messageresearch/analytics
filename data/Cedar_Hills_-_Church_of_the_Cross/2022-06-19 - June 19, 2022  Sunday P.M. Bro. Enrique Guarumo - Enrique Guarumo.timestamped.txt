[16:39] be strong in life
[16:41] he told me i will not give you the fish
[16:44] my daughter i will teach you how to
[16:46] catch the fish
[16:48] the one who told brother bernie take
[16:50] care of her as your own daughter

[16:54] the one who presented me a living jesus
[16:57] christ

[17:22] who told me when who told me one day
[17:26] never just talk to a person just because
[17:28] they are from your own country
[17:30] instead talk to everyone and treat them
[17:33] the same because they're all children of
[17:35] god
[17:38] the one who told me
[17:40] the closer you get with god
[17:42] the humble you will be
[17:45] the one who say

[17:49] never step on a person they will put
[17:52] your foot on a person whenever he or she
[17:55] falls down

[17:59] to help them up
[18:03] the one who told me
[18:05] there's no better inheritance you can
[18:07] give to your children
[18:09] that you can do give to your daughter

[18:19] never miss a service
[18:21] and put god about anything and
[18:23] everything
[18:23] [Music]
[18:26] and i can go on and on and on with all
[18:28] the advice
[18:29] that he gave me
[18:31] but instead
[18:32] i want to say
[18:34] that i have been blessed beyond measure

[20:08] [Music]
[20:30] is
[20:51] [Music]
[20:58] [Applause]
[20:59] [Music]
[21:31] is
[21:54] the lord jesus christ bless you this
[21:55] evening
[22:12] first one
[22:24] oh
[22:52] that the scripture says
[23:06] remember now thy creator in the days of
[23:08] thy youth while the evil days come not
[23:14] no
[23:16] nor the years
[23:18] nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt
[23:20] say i have no pleasure in them
[23:23] let us pray
[23:26] beloved heavenly father
[23:30] we can thank you this evening
[23:44] at this time we present ourselves before
[23:46] you
[23:48] for your service beneficial
[23:50] and for the benefit of thy people
[23:52] [Music]
[23:55] may you open up our understanding
[23:59] so that we can comprehend what thy word
[24:01] says
[24:16] blessed in the name of the lord jesus
[24:18] our lord amen
[24:28] when we take these scriptures simply
[24:37] first of all what we try to do is try to
[24:39] be a help
[24:41] help in the scriptures
[24:44] pastor local as we heard our pastor say
[24:49] because of the lack of knowledge
[24:53] for many people perish
[24:58] established and here solomon is speaking
[25:01] to us
[25:04] and the first thing he says is remember
[25:08] thy creator
[25:12] in the days
[25:23] i'm going to speak a little bit on what
[25:25] is a friendship
[25:40] the bond doesn't tie them just unite
[25:42] them
[25:46] and we can see like as in a couple
[25:51] they can be a
[25:53] a good couple
[26:04] and today i want to focus on our the
[26:06] bonds that we have with god
[26:17] there is a bond towards our children i
[26:19] being socialists there are there are
[26:22] social bonds classes
[26:25] and different kinds of bonds
[26:30] but we are going to focus on the bonds
[26:32] of god
[26:37] [Music]
[26:39] and with that i'd like to take another
[26:41] scripture
[26:42] in
[26:43] daniel
[26:45] in daniel chapter one
[26:51] so that we can comprehend a little bit
[26:52] more
[26:54] daniel
[26:55] [Music]
[26:56] daniel chapter one
[27:01] and here i'm going to stay here a little
[27:03] bit
[27:06] because when we have friendships out in
[27:08] the world
[27:09] muchas personas
[27:14] and mainly here in the christian world
[27:46] and here we're gonna find three young
[27:48] men
[27:51] oh these pages
[27:53] they got stuck together
[28:12] and it is very important to see which
[28:14] bond we have with god
[28:17] and it says
[28:28] and the king spake unto
[28:30] ashpinaz
[28:31] the master of his eunuchs that he should
[28:34] bring certain of the children of israel
[28:36] and of the king's seed and of the
[28:38] princes
[28:52] and skillful in all wisdom
[28:55] and cunning in knowledge
[28:59] and understanding science
[29:03] palacio del rey and such as had ability
[29:06] in them to stand in the kings palace
[29:12] and whom they might teach the learning
[29:14] and the tongue of the chaladins
[29:17] versus
[29:19] verse six entrees
[29:26] now among these were of of the children
[29:28] of judah
[29:30] daniel hananiah
[29:32] mishael and azariah
[29:36] verse eight
[29:37] is
[29:41] but daniel purposed in his heart no
[29:43] contaminarce
[29:48] that he would not defile himself with a
[29:50] portion of the king's meat and says
[29:57] and us when we get to the place as the
[29:59] christians that we are momentos
[30:02] there are times there are moments
[30:04] situations
[30:17] [Music]
[30:34] not to contaminate himself
[30:41] now the king had placed certain young
[30:43] men
[30:45] with abilities
[30:48] with the ability to be able to be in the
[30:50] palace of the king
[30:53] persona
[30:56] that's why many people many many young
[30:59] people they say
[31:03] they desire a lot of things for their
[31:04] life
[31:08] the question is are we ready are we
[31:10] prepared
[31:13] because how beautiful it is
[31:44] i want to get married to your daughter
[31:55] but the question is
[31:59] are we prepared
[32:08] that's the problem
[32:36] that's why i use him as an example
[32:52] this young man came in to present
[32:54] himself with with his girlfriend
[32:57] and he said i want to get married
[32:59] okay
[33:03] congratulations
[33:07] but this man
[33:21] that doesn't matter to me you you say
[33:23] ludico
[33:24] i'm telling you antis i'm letting you
[33:27] know beforehand
[33:32] i'm letting you beforehand because you
[33:34] know sooner or later you might repent
[33:36] from that
[33:41] because that's why here the king was was
[33:44] requiring these men intelligentes to be
[33:48] intelligent
[33:56] and she says oh no that doesn't matter
[33:58] to me i want to get married okay
[34:05] and i said to myself well why does this
[34:06] man do that
[34:09] i i i thought that and i was ridiculing
[34:11] him
[34:13] but i was saying the truth
[34:17] the time passed
[34:26] why did this man tell this young lady
[34:28] that
[34:30] perron
[34:31] but in those three years
[34:41] [Music]
[34:53] [Laughter]
[35:03] but then there comes a time where you
[35:04] can say oh my daughter is ready to get
[35:06] married
[35:11] is she prepared
[35:14] because god is coming for a people
[35:17] question
[35:18] that are prepared
[35:22] that the bible says that he will come
[35:26] to them
[35:28] that are waiting for him
[35:57] because daniel although he was there
[36:01] he purposed in his heart no contaminants
[36:04] that he will not defile himself
[36:08] with the things of those the king
[36:14] that's why when when the young people
[36:15] when they go to school
[36:22] here we are going to re rehearse or go
[36:24] over the the bonds that we have with god
[36:28] and
[36:29] god
[36:31] and his immense wisdom
[36:35] he left us ten commandments
[36:38] cinco para con
[36:51] that we should love the lord our god
[36:55] above all things
[36:59] and if you fulfill that yes
[37:04] everything else comes on its own you've
[37:05] already overcome
[37:15] and here is where we enter into our
[37:17] personal bond with god
[38:00] not to defile thyself
[38:07] and god gave us the free moral agency
[38:12] so that you can decide whether you want
[38:13] to do it or not
[39:02] i want to read it so that we can be
[39:04] confirmed with the scripture
[39:12] the scripture says in verse 16.
[39:27] wherefore is there a price in the hand
[39:29] of a fool to get wisdom
[39:31] seeing he has no heart to it
[39:37] here i'm going to say something
[39:40] because the people think quela felicidad
[39:42] consists that that that a happiness
[39:45] consists
[39:48] i'll give an example better
[39:52] uh
[39:56] a lot of people say oh when i when i get
[39:58] married i want to be happy
[40:01] the bible says
[40:04] that it is an affliction of the flesh
[40:23] do not have so many problems
[40:28] you have a free moral agency
[40:34] it says here because
[40:41] wherefore is there a price in the hand
[40:43] of a fool to get wisdom
[40:45] he has no heart to it
[40:49] because many people think
[40:50] kevalen that they are worth
[40:55] they are they're worth a lot because of
[40:56] what they have
[41:00] they think because if they have a new
[41:02] vehicle
[41:04] and i hope that's not the the problem
[41:06] here the issue here
[41:07] but
[41:10] but if i buy a new vehicle
[41:16] i can think to myself oh well that's
[41:18] that's my worth
[41:22] oh they can put a nice watch of gold
[41:28] thinking that that's what that's what's
[41:29] going to give him his worth
[41:32] and that's not the way it is
[41:38] so then the scripture says
[41:45] yes
[41:49] a friend loveth at all times and a
[41:51] brother is born for adversity
[42:01] it is so important that the bible says
[42:02] that we should have friends
[42:08] and i like this because because the
[42:10] bonds of friendship
[42:13] they are broken when they are broken
[42:17] it is very hard to restore them
[42:27] that's why the bible says then it speaks
[42:29] to us that we should have a bond in the
[42:31] flesh
[42:39] but when we break those bonds
[42:55] that's why we must be born again
[43:02] because that is the bond that is going
[43:03] to unite you with god
[43:09] in tonses
[43:34] a man that has friends must show himself
[43:37] friendly in tons
[43:41] so then it is it's really easy to have
[43:43] friends
[43:46] but how hard it is
[43:49] to be able to to be friendly
[43:53] to to be a friend
[43:57] we can regardless we can have a
[43:59] bunch
[44:04] but when we try to go and be a friend
[44:06] and
[44:14] because when you have a certain
[44:16] viewpoint in life
[44:19] of
[44:19] of a wise man
[44:28] he said that you don't have to have you
[44:29] don't have to have war with with bombs
[44:31] and
[44:35] a missiles all you have to do is
[44:37] is express your position
[44:41] and then you would you'll have enemies
[44:45] and you don't you don't need bombs
[44:48] that's
[44:56] friendships are wonderful
[45:16] you're going to
[45:29] or it doesn't say that
[45:43] they don't get to the to the success
[45:45] that they like
[45:48] because bonds are broken
[45:51] jesus
[45:53] jesus
[45:54] jesus said these words
[45:57] by your fruits
[46:10] we see it by our fruits
[46:17] and according to that sometimes we think
[46:19] to ourselves oh i am very successful
[46:23] but
[46:24] in order for that to happen you need
[46:40] and the first bond that god demands of
[46:42] us
[46:44] is faith
[46:47] because without that faith
[46:50] you are not going to be able to move
[46:54] we
[47:10] the prophet preached a message called
[47:11] perseverant
[47:15] and we cannot get nowhere
[47:20] first of all you can't don't believe in
[47:21] yourself
[47:40] because it is impossible to please god
[47:42] without faith
[47:47] and says
[47:54] gonna go to ecclesiastes11
[47:59] and verse nine
[48:03] okay
[48:16] the youth don't have a sense of life
[48:42] and i don't know why there's there's
[48:43] there's youth that are there like if
[48:45] they're sucking on lemons
[49:06] and greet them and we're kind of scared
[49:08] sometimes
[49:11] but for for a youth
[49:14] living rejoicefully
[49:18] when we go outside
[49:22] we should say god bless you and with a
[49:24] smile
[49:26] [Music]
[49:45] the other day i was observing somebody
[49:47] that was
[49:48] smoking
[49:49] marijuana
[49:51] and i was observing him
[49:58] oh and this guy he began to sing and he
[50:00] began to shout
[50:03] okay
[50:06] because because i was going through a
[50:07] hard time
[50:32] i don't know if you've ever seen someone
[50:34] that's been in drugs
[50:36] he doesn't care about anything
[51:06] in
[51:18] sometimes it looks like we don't like
[51:19] anything
[51:33] brother or sister
[51:51] and walk in the ways of thine heart and
[51:54] in the sight of thine eyes
[51:58] here uh solomon is you know i see him
[52:00] he's tremendous
[52:04] tremendous to give this uh to give us
[52:06] advice to the young ones
[52:10] take rejoice and what you see
[52:30] god
[52:44] but know one thing
[52:48] that above everything that you do
[52:53] is going to judge you
[53:08] [Applause]
[53:11] one more scripture
[53:26] these
[53:29] and it says
[53:30] jose can me
[53:32] for i know that in me
[53:35] that is in my flesh
[53:37] no more
[53:38] dwelleth no good thing is
[53:51] and it says
[54:06] is present with me
[54:09] but how to perform that which is good i
[54:12] find that
[54:15] the church should be filled well
[54:20] but it's not easy to do it
[54:23] and it says
[54:28] for the good that i would i do not.
[54:34] but the evil which i would not that i do
[54:47] that's why the first thing that we
[54:49] should do is know ourselves
[54:52] because paul says i i know myself
[55:04] and i know that sometimes the brothers
[55:06] we we we leave them we're tired you say
[55:08] oh like glacia and we say oh the the
[55:11] church
[55:12] oh church
[55:17] and we i am up to here
[55:21] and sometimes we're a little bit a
[55:22] little bit up to here
[55:26] pero romanos but brothers
[55:31] that i want to do that i don't do this
[55:36] and it says
[55:41] now if i do that
[55:43] i will not
[55:45] it is no more i that do it
[55:50] but sin that dwelleth in me
[55:55] the apostle paul is saying that i have
[55:58] sinned
[56:00] he says
[56:24] i find then allah that when i would do
[56:27] good evil is present
[56:33] for i delight in the law of god after
[56:36] the inward man
[56:40] but i see another law in my members
[56:49] and bringing me into captivity he is
[56:52] telling me to the law of sin which is in
[56:54] my members
[57:10] and god knows
[57:22] and he's he even knows
[57:25] the way you sit down
[57:29] and the way you get up
[57:31] he knows everything
[57:34] i have one more scripture
[57:38] go
[57:48] 3
[57:49] 3
[58:03] therefore your members which are upon
[58:05] the earth
[58:11] who who wants to die
[58:16] so the the problem isn't that we're that
[58:18] we we're going to die and
[58:20] ask you so
[58:33] that's why the prophet recommends us
[58:38] that we should die to the things of the
[58:39] world
[58:46] i have a little boy back there
[59:01] we see how the lord how he teaches us
[59:07] because the prophet says that time is
[59:09] the best discerner
[59:12] and if we want to measure ourselves
[59:15] in our spiritual level
[59:21] so that we see that when we are we're
[59:23] little called me
[59:25] and i say it because i see my little boy
[59:30] and just to be able to put a shirt on it
[59:32] was we struggle
[59:34] cambiar
[59:36] to change him
[59:37] we struggle
[59:42] and i say oh well i'm sure he's gonna
[59:44] get to the to the point
[59:48] where he's going to be able to do it
[59:49] himself
[59:53] so then so then i understood
[1:00:00] on on your the stage of your
[1:00:02] spirituality
[1:00:05] you're going to do some things that are
[1:00:07] easy
[1:00:39] an adult
[1:00:54] where it says
[1:01:22] that it's a day of service
[1:01:25] and and the road or the way is a little
[1:01:27] easier
[1:01:34] and it says
[1:01:56] therefore your members which are upon
[1:01:58] the earth fornication uncleanness
[1:02:02] inordinate affection evil conspicuous
[1:02:07] and
[1:02:08] covetedness which is idolatry
[1:02:12] and who is god telling this to
[1:02:16] to his people
[1:02:18] es esta el
[1:02:19] this is between the people
[1:02:23] or this is for the people yes sir
[1:02:27] but this is here is where we should know
[1:02:29] how to measure ourselves
[1:02:32] and say you know and say where am i
[1:02:37] let us stand to our feet
[1:02:42] there are many more scriptures
[1:02:46] but when you break those bonds
[1:02:53] we we have we have done we have
[1:02:55] rehearsed it
[1:02:59] we have rehearsed this and we had and at
[1:03:02] our homes if we let something small that
[1:03:03] enter
[1:03:05] and before we know it
[1:03:08] we have a big problem
[1:03:12] because the bond
[1:03:14] familiaris we're not talking about the
[1:03:16] family bond
[1:03:19] because there it's delicate
[1:03:26] but we ourselves
[1:03:56] may you be
[1:04:25] are it is a time where there is a lot of
[1:04:27] profession
[1:04:30] but very little very few vocations
[1:04:34] help us lord yes
[1:04:36] and give us strength and this walk look
