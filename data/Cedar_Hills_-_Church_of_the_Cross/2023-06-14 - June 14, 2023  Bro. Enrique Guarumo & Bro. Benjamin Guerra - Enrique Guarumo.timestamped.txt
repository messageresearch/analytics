[40:55] and hot
[40:57] blessed be the name of the Lord
[41:01] good to know my brothers
[41:05] and we are here to enjoy the word of God
[41:10] it's open our Bibles Brothers
[41:20] and let's open to the Book of Psalms
[41:23] chapter 42.
[41:26] and when you have it please confirm that
[41:29] by saying amen
[41:38] two verses of this chapter verses one
[41:41] and two
[41:46] amen amen
[41:49] the scripture says Aguas
[41:58] as the heart panted after the water
[42:00] Brooks so painted my soul after thee o
[42:03] God
[42:12] my soul thirsteth for God for the Living
[42:15] God When shall I come and appear before
[42:18] God foreign
[42:24] for this opportunity
[42:28] foreign
[43:23] and we have to approach yourself for so
[43:26] very many reasons
[43:31] foreign
[44:20] [Music]
[44:48] be take
[44:52] except by him that put it there
[44:56] blessed be the name of the Lord
[45:13] I believe that he was in much anguish he
[45:16] said Prophet The Prophet says
[45:23] it usually requires anguish to pick out
[45:26] the very best of what's inside of the
[45:28] man
[45:30] have you ever experienced the time of
[45:33] being in English you will find out
[45:41] that's when you should really show what
[45:44] is a god that is in you
[45:47] because if God is in you nada nothing
[45:55] can separate you from God
[46:03] none of
[46:07] those things will separate you from God
[46:10] the prophet says
[46:15] foreign
[46:55] sometimes we get into many different
[46:57] kinds of orange
[46:58] for very many reasons
[47:22] the prophet said that David had to sit
[47:24] down and think
[47:26] about these things
[47:30] he was thinking what am I doing with my
[47:33] life but can we just business
[47:37] sometimes Brothers
[47:47] it requires you to sit and begin to
[47:49] meditate
[47:51] and you think Lord white tonight go
[47:54] forward
[47:57] instead of advancing it looks like I'm
[48:00] going backwards
[48:32] don't wait till you get in that
[48:34] condition to begin to look for God
[48:37] but to accept that moment brother
[48:40] to think of your life
[48:43] what you are going to do
[48:53] why did this happen to me
[48:57] muchas many times
[49:02] that is trying to get your attention
[49:09] and the prophet says he permits you to
[49:12] get in that hospital
[49:13] how many of you have ever been in the
[49:15] hospital
[49:17] they are laying in the bed
[49:21] you raise your hand Brothers
[49:25] the majority of us
[49:28] that when you look above
[49:36] my time my help comes in the time of
[49:39] trouble from above
[49:41] but we forget
[49:46] over all these things
[49:53] hospital hospital
[49:54] maybe we have to foreign
[50:27] above
[50:38] because success in this world
[50:41] it will have you so busy
[50:45] and the businesses of this world
[50:53] blessed be the name of the Lord says
[51:02] it's for you to seek after him
[51:09] it's time for you to repent
[51:14] what happens that many people they
[51:17] repent
[51:19] I mean the Bible says
[51:23] that separates himself from sins
[51:29] and departs from sins
[51:33] we shall obtain Mercy
[51:37] many people confess
[51:40] they don't separate themselves from the
[51:42] sin
[51:44] that's the Bible
[51:56] the question is if you separate yourself
[52:00] to continue doing the same thing
[52:07] the prophet says that repentance
[52:10] is to have the desire
[52:14] to never do it again
[52:19] that is a true repentance
[52:23] the prophet says
[52:27] David
[52:28] was calling out not
[52:31] for some historical something
[52:35] that happened many years ago
[52:40] he was crying out for the Living God
[52:44] brother I believe in a living God
[52:58] you're afraid to to come face to face
[53:01] with your sins
[53:21] I will never drink of you again
[53:24] I do not need you
[53:28] know why
[53:32] the one that drinks most he gets he gets
[53:35] drunk
[53:36] the next day he's gonna want more yes
[53:41] then he's going to want more
[53:44] but when you take God in his words
[53:48] you will never again
[53:50] you will never have that desire in your
[53:53] heart again foreign
[54:18] eternal life
[54:20] foreign
[54:22] you say now Lord
[54:25] give me that water domination
[54:29] oh I want from that that kind of water
[54:33] you know why porque yesterday
[54:36] she was tired that's why
[54:40] she had had five husbands and the one
[54:44] she had
[54:45] it was no good either but
[54:49] in her heart
[54:52] to find what was right
[54:57] you have to desire strongly to what is
[55:01] right
[55:05] maybe her first husband mistreated her
[55:08] she says
[55:10] maybe the second one he will humiliate
[55:13] her
[55:17] can you imagine that woman
[55:22] but when she found herself
[55:25] oh brother
[55:35] how difficult it is to find today a
[55:38] friend
[55:39] is very difficult
[55:45] the prophet said she wanted to find out
[55:49] somebody that wouldn't condemn her or
[55:51] accuse her of anything
[55:53] and then he would use the judgment and
[55:56] righteousness and in truth
[55:59] she said he said go bring me your
[56:01] husband she said I don't have a husband
[56:06] and Jesus said well you have said
[56:10] you have spoken in truth
[56:15] blessed be the name of the Lord
[56:20] how good is it to find somebody like
[56:22] that
[56:24] sometimes we need someone
[56:27] that will bring Justice or righteousness
[56:30] to you
[56:38] that's what you said if you knew the
[56:40] gift of God
[56:44] the people come to church brother
[56:47] but they don't know the gift of God
[56:50] foreign
[57:19] blessed be the name of the Lord
[57:22] brother when you're thirsty
[57:25] thirsty
[57:28] but all the time
[57:31] you're gonna always have a thirst
[57:35] all the time
[57:38] that's why the Bible says
[57:41] it says the Heart Is Never Satisfied
[58:24] how is that so brother
[58:27] the prophet says
[58:33] it was a woman
[58:36] correct me okay
[58:41] there was this demon in this woman that
[58:43] could take a hold of ten men and tear
[58:45] them up these are
[58:47] these are if the devil can do that
[58:51] what can the Holy Spirit do
[58:57] is
[59:00] just a few days ago I was driving
[59:06] marijuana there was a person in front of
[59:08] me that was smoking marijuana
[59:14] he was without a shirt walking down the
[59:16] street smoking his marijuana
[59:22] and I either started thinking
[59:28] glory to God it's gonna cost you brother
[59:33] and we say we have the Holy Spirit
[59:37] a brother a person
[59:40] one of one of those demons
[59:45] he will jump around he didn't care what
[59:48] people thought about him
[59:49] he didn't make no difference to him who
[59:52] criticized him
[59:54] he was in his craziness there
[1:00:16] you know in whom you have believed
[1:00:38] will worship God
[1:00:43] in his spirit in spirit
[1:00:46] and in truth
[1:00:52] why men
[1:00:57] One More Story
[1:01:01] I don't know if you've heard this story
[1:01:04] and in the military service

[1:08:16] and just throw some more nuggets out
[1:08:20] there
[1:08:22] you awake today
[1:08:24] hey man let's go straight to the
[1:08:26] scriptures
[1:08:38] amen let's start with first five sorry
[1:08:44] and in the evening sacrifice I Rose
[1:08:47] up for my heaviness and having rent my
[1:08:50] garments and my mantle I fell upon my
[1:08:53] knees and spread out my hands unto the
[1:08:56] Lord my God
[1:09:07] and said oh my God
[1:09:09] I am ashamed
[1:09:11] and blessed to lift up my face unto thee
[1:09:15] my God
[1:09:16] for our iniquities
[1:09:18] are increased over our head and our
[1:09:21] trespasses grown upon
[1:09:24] the heavens it is
[1:09:39] amen you may be seated
[1:09:41] amen what a beautiful message
[1:09:44] you know God gives us that thirst
[1:09:48] you know but but many times we when
[1:09:52] we're in Victory time
[1:09:55] it's easy to serve God
[1:09:58] but we're when we're in the gutter
[1:10:02] you know that's when we have we have
[1:10:05] problems
[1:10:07] you know because many times
[1:10:09] you know we come and we hear the word of
[1:10:12] God
[1:10:13] you know but we we take part of it
[1:10:18] you know because we're ashamed
[1:10:21] we're ashamed that we're sinful people
[1:10:25] you know because we do not recognize
[1:10:29] the sacrifice that was made
[1:10:32] we don't recognize
[1:10:35] the god that's in our days so
[1:10:39] we let these sins continue
[1:10:43] and then they become iniquities
[1:10:46] and to come to the point where we will
[1:10:49] not change
[1:10:52] it's so easy to come to church
[1:10:55] the pastor brings the word
[1:10:58] the ministry brings the words
[1:11:00] and you say oh that didn't partain to me
[1:11:06] wait a minute
[1:11:10] when John was told to take the book
[1:11:14] he was to eat all of it
[1:11:17] you know if we could come into the
[1:11:20] presence of God
[1:11:22] that thirst that God gave us
[1:11:25] was to take every bit of God's word
[1:11:30] no we are so worried
[1:11:33] about our sin are hiding our sinfulness
[1:11:38] instead of confronting it
[1:11:42] you know we let the devil play games
[1:11:44] with us
[1:11:47] but when we see reality
[1:11:50] We're not gonna make it
[1:11:52] we're not going to make you with the
[1:11:55] sinful nature
[1:11:56] We're not gonna make it with this
[1:11:59] iniquity mentality
[1:12:02] because what is it it's a slave
[1:12:05] mentality
[1:12:08] you know if we look and see where God
[1:12:11] has taken us from
[1:12:13] we forget about that part
[1:12:16] we were lost in the nuclear sins
[1:12:21] we were nobody
[1:12:24] but God who is Rich
[1:12:28] down and
[1:12:31] he saved me
[1:12:33] but that wasn't good enough
[1:12:36] we have to have the mentality
[1:12:39] that we gotta care enough about our
[1:12:42] brothers
[1:12:45] because we cannot make it
[1:12:48] without each other
[1:12:50] so when that word comes forward
[1:12:54] you say it doesn't pertain to me
[1:12:57] but it pertains to somebody
[1:13:01] you gotta think
[1:13:03] we gotta see God
[1:13:06] we gotta pray to God
[1:13:09] foreign
[1:14:27] I must say is
[1:14:45] worthy one more time
[1:14:48] give us one more opportunity
[1:15:01] we're not going to give him credit
[1:15:03] tonight
[1:15:06] he deserves no credit
[1:15:09] because my God's almighty God
[1:15:12] he's strong in Valor as Fuerte because
[1:15:17] you look at that life foreign
[1:15:39] [Music]
[1:16:06] foreign

[1:20:34] into a to to
[1:20:37] um rehab the Harlot
[1:20:41] they forgot what she told the spies
[1:20:49] that we have heard
[1:20:52] how you crossed over on dry land
[1:20:56] almost no evil how great your God is
[1:21:12] but there was one man
[1:21:15] that did not forget okay
[1:21:21] video
[1:21:43] let's turn to the description
[1:21:47] sorry I'm so excited tonight
[1:22:23] but that it may be a witness between us
[1:22:51] may not say to our children
[1:22:55] in the time that's to come
[1:22:58] you have no part with the Lord
[1:23:03] therefore said we it shall be
[1:23:06] when they should say unto unto us or to
[1:23:10] Our Generations in the time to come
[1:23:15] that we may say again
[1:23:18] behold the pattern of the altar of the
[1:23:22] Lord
[1:23:23] which our fathers made
[1:23:27] that this wasn't for the birth offerings
[1:23:32] it wasn't for the sacrifices
[1:23:35] but it is a witness
[1:23:38] between us
[1:23:42] what was established that day
[1:23:44] that it would never be forgotten
[1:23:48] it was prophesied
[1:23:51] of what was going to come
[1:24:01] fighting foreign
[1:24:34] Aiden
[1:24:36] examples of what was going to happen
[1:24:39] today
[1:24:41] they did not want it to be forgotten
[1:24:44] remember what the scripture says
[1:24:47] not the sacrifice
[1:24:50] not these burnt offerings
[1:24:53] but it was something wrong
[1:24:59] what are we here on Sunday
[1:25:03] what's Rapture it's a condition
[1:25:19] of who Jesus Christ now was they again
[1:25:23] Jesus Christ
[1:25:25] Jesus Christ
[1:25:26] battle King this is Crystal s so here's
[1:25:30] Ezra but I guess that is
[1:25:36] but to this day that was one of the
[1:25:40] greatest scriptures
[1:25:42] of someone who fought for the people
[1:25:45] yeah
[1:25:48] foreign
[1:26:32] great part of the Resurrection
[1:26:37] so what happened
[1:26:39] it we start thinking
[1:26:42] and we start praying Lord
