[0:01] let us go on to
[0:04] Perfection I like Paul saying those
[0:06] things Paul never was a person that like
[0:09] to stay too long in one place he liked
[0:11] to move on deeper one time in the
[0:14] scripture he said I forgetting those
[0:17] things which are in the past I press
[0:20] towards the mark of the High Calling see
[0:23] he keeps pressing on now we first we
[0:26] want to find out could we be perfect and
[0:29] we found found out in the scriptures
[0:31] this morning Matthew 5:28 that Jesus
[0:34] said that we had to be just as perfect
[0:36] as God was or we wouldn't go in now
[0:39] here's what we find out then over
[0:42] reading F scripture with scripture that
[0:44] Jesus by one sacrifice perfected
[0:49] forever his
[0:51] church ye we are then per perfect
[0:54] through Christ and we are free from
[0:57] judgment through Christ
[1:00] we shall never die through Christ we
[1:04] have lost death and found life through
[1:08] Christ not through any church not
[1:11] through any denomination not through any
[1:13] fantastic not through speaking with
[1:15] tongues not through shouting not through
[1:18] shaking not through dancing in the
[1:19] spirit but by
[1:23] Grace now you got to see where the
[1:25] picture is Paul is trying here to separ
[1:29] separate law From Grace we've got two
[1:32] pictures one the carnal one the
[1:36] spiritual this letter is to the Hebrews
[1:40] and all the Hebrews is trying to show
[1:42] the pattern of the Old Testament typ in
[1:45] the new now this Leon is absolutely not
[1:50] any interpretation at all it's just the
[1:53] Greek word for what the English says and
[1:56] it said now we don't want listen here
[1:58] see not laying uh down foundations of
[2:05] reformation from Works
[2:09] causing death now if you get that in
[2:12] your mind that he's speaking here that
[2:16] forms of reformation causes
[2:20] death Paul
[2:22] said leaving the principles go to
[2:26] Perfection not laying again the
[2:28] foundation of of repentance from dead
[2:31] works and of Faith towards God doctrines
[2:34] of baptism laying on of hands
[2:35] resurrection of the Dead Eternal
[2:39] judgment
[2:40] Reformation
[2:42] forms causing death was the right words
[2:46] that's actually why Paul wrote see what
[2:49] he's trying to do now you can be all
[2:52] worked up in Emotion by speaking in
[2:54] tongu shouting jerking shaking running
[2:57] up down the a nothing against that but
[2:59] but you can make yourself believe that
[3:01] you're saved when you're not your life
[3:04] will prove what you are Jesus said it
[3:07] will by their fruits you shall know them
[3:10] your life will prove whether you're
[3:12] saved or not if you never open your
[3:14] mouth Paul said let's go on to
[3:16] Perfection now we're talking about
[3:20] perfected and if we'll run this down
[3:22] you'll find out the perfected is the
[3:24] elected that's how it is with Christ
[3:27] when a man's born to the spirit of God
[3:29] not because he shouted spoken under some
[3:31] emotion but in his heart love come in
[3:35] and taking the place of the world I tell
[3:38] you he loves him he walks by him every
[3:40] day amen you don't have to tell him it's
[3:42] wrong to do this or that or the other he
[3:44] knows it's wrong and he walks he's an AR
[3:47] and beginning at the sixth chapter we
[3:50] got this in our lesson this morning
[3:52] therefore leaving the principles of the
[3:55] doctrine of
[3:57] Christ let us go on to
[4:01] Perfection I like Paul saying those
[4:04] things Paul never was a person that like
[4:06] to stay too long in one place he liked
[4:08] to move on deeper one time in the

[28:51] hands if you're
[28:53] ready all right I don't want brother
[28:55] Caleb to be ministering this morning we
[28:57] want the Lord to speak to us
[29:00] amen so let's get into the word now
[29:03] we're going to start a little slow and
[29:04] and and and then you'll see at the end
[29:07] it's all going to come together I
[29:08] promise you
[29:12] this Matthew the 13th chapter and the
[29:15] 10th
[29:22] verse Matthew 13: 10 and
[29:26] 11 one more time this may be one of the
[29:30] most important messages I have ever
[29:32] preached to
[29:35] you and the disciples came and said unto
[29:38] him why speakest thou unto them in
[29:46] Parables and he said unto them because
[29:49] it is given unto
[29:55] you we got to take that to yourself amen
[29:58] everybody put your name because it is
[30:01] given unto
[30:03] Caleb to know the mysteries of the
[30:06] kingdom of
[30:10] heaven but to them it is not
[30:14] given may God add His blessings to the
[30:17] reading of his word you may be
[30:22] seated Parables Paras what a
[30:26] word Parables can you repeat after me
[30:31] Parables Parables is an Earthly
[30:36] story with a Heavenly
[30:39] meaning now we we we went over this last
[30:42] time and we want to go over it again one
[30:46] more time a parable
[30:50] is an Earthly story with a Heavenly
[30:55] meaning a parable let me see your
[30:59] is uh
[31:01] also it means to place one thing side by
[31:07] side for the purpose of comparing
[31:12] it this has to equal
[31:16] this if if I bring
[31:21] this and I put this side by
[31:24] side it doesn't make sense
[31:26] right there's nothing that's similar
[31:29] about
[31:30] it even though in type they can say oh
[31:32] this is the water and this is water but
[31:34] but as as a whole it doesn't it doesn't
[31:37] jive
[31:38] right but when you bring these two
[31:42] together you find it that it's not just
[31:45] similar it's it's the
[31:47] same and that's what we're after this
[31:50] morning I don't I don't believe that we
[31:52] want to be just a a a
[31:55] Christian but when Christ is set side by
[31:59] side with
[32:00] us is the same life in us that is in
[32:05] Christ if not then we're just a church
[32:09] goer right the Life of Christ has got to
[32:12] be inside of
[32:14] you or else it's just religion that we
[32:17] have
[32:18] received it means to compare one thing
[32:21] with
[32:24] another the likeness the
[32:26] similitude
[32:28] now listen closely as I as I tell you
[32:31] other things that a parable
[32:35] is a
[32:37] parable
[32:39] displays a pre-ordained
[32:45] Harmony between spiritual things and
[32:49] material
[32:51] things now that's a
[32:54] parable it's very hard to get the
[32:57] spiritual and the natural to be in
[32:59] harmony with each other
[33:02] right in other words it's impossible
[33:05] really to have that
[33:08] Harmony unless the spiritual has come
[33:13] down to join with the
[33:15] natural then comes the harmony with the
[33:19] natural and the
[33:22] spiritual parables are predictive and
[33:26] prophetic
[33:29] and the bottom
[33:31] line Parables can def be defined as
[33:36] this a beautiful
[33:39] image from a beautiful
[33:43] mind I'm going to say it one more time a
[33:46] parable is a beautiful
[33:49] image from A Beautiful Mind in other
[33:53] words from the back part of God's
[33:56] mind he was release
[33:59] something that only those that were
[34:01] spiritual enough could
[34:05] catch a church member can't catch
[34:08] this this is important listen closely a
[34:12] church member cannot catch these
[34:16] things natural person can catch these
[34:20] things it takes a prophetic
[34:24] group spiritual group that is in har
[34:27] harmony with the spiritual
[34:31] realm these things if not we're going to
[34:35] be the same as everyone
[34:37] else waiting for a
[34:39] Rapture that never gets
[34:43] here are you with me Romans 1:20 have
[34:47] your Bibles ready because we're going to
[34:48] read some few
[34:51] scriptures for the invisible things of
[34:54] him from the creation of the world are
[34:58] clearly
[35:07] seen let me ask you a
[35:09] question and you see invisible
[35:16] things yes or yes see or see or no or no
[35:20] or no or no how many of you can see
[35:22] invisible
[35:26] things
[35:28] by faith we say right it's not a trick
[35:32] question I'm just reading the Bible here
[35:35] for the invisible
[35:37] things him from the creation of the
[35:40] world are clearly
[35:43] seen they cannot be clearly
[35:46] seen until there's an image that catches
[35:50] it in other words creation produces the
[35:55] image that catch the invisible
[35:59] and display it in the natural
[36:02] realm there's no other way to understand
[36:05] that being understood by the things that
[36:08] are
[36:09] made in other words the
[36:12] invisible can only be
[36:15] seen by the things that were
[36:18] made if we see a tree there has to be a
[36:22] spiritual tree that that it's
[36:26] showing you see a tree then you go see
[36:29] the tree of
[36:31] life okay there's a tree of life
[36:33] somewhere there's a tree though that
[36:35] never dies
[36:37] somewhere but then it's shown in a
[36:39] natural or a physical
[36:42] tree they are understood by the things
[36:45] that are
[36:48] made even his eternal power and
[36:55] godhead let me say Let Let Me read that
[36:58] again so his eternal
[37:01] power and
[37:03] godhead are
[37:06] invisible until something that is
[37:09] made can now reflect what that
[37:13] is are you are you are you understanding
[37:17] this so then so that they are without an
[37:23] excuse well I didn't know well look
[37:26] around we don't have an excuse no more
[37:30] because all that God was he poured into
[37:34] Christ and all that Christ was he poured
[37:36] into the
[37:37] church now something
[37:40] visible that is showing what was
[37:44] invisible the godhead was
[37:46] invisible his eternal power was
[37:50] invisible until a people came on the
[37:54] scene that he could put that power in
[37:59] godhead
[38:00] in and therefore the people have no
[38:04] excuse you have no excuse anymore that
[38:08] Jesus Christ is not
[38:10] alive there's no excuse no more maybe
[38:14] years and years and centuries
[38:16] ago but now more than ever
[38:20] before it is on
[38:22] display the harmony between the
[38:25] spiritual and the natural
[38:28] are you with me just setting a
[38:32] foundation I speak to
[38:35] ministers pastors people
[38:38] everywhere and and everyone seems it
[38:41] seems like everyone is telling me the
[38:43] same
[38:44] thing now maybe you can you can
[38:47] associate yourself with
[38:50] this there seems to be such a heaviness
[38:55] in in the in the world world
[38:58] today more than there's ever
[39:02] been such a
[39:05] heaviness that everyone I talk
[39:08] to man I'm I'm just so tired all the
[39:12] time am I talking to anyone
[39:19] here I there there's such a heavy it's
[39:23] like a heavy Cloud over
[39:26] world making the people Slumber and
[39:32] sleep all of a sudden you just doze
[39:36] off I was talking to somebody the other
[39:39] day sitting there and I was I just and
[39:42] for a moment I fell
[39:44] asleep that's not very nice
[39:48] huh I saw
[39:51] that yes you did I went to sleep on
[39:56] you that's
[40:02] I don't do that on purpose and I didn't
[40:04] I don't do that all the time
[40:06] okay I'm getting
[40:08] old but what's going on is is this
[40:11] heaviness is for one
[40:14] purpose to D our
[40:18] senses is that right come on now when
[40:20] you become become you get into that
[40:22] slumbering and
[40:24] sleepiness your senses are dulled
[40:28] you're not aware of what's going on
[40:31] you're not aware of the
[40:33] spiritual much less what's going on or
[40:35] what should be going on in the
[40:38] natural I hear people saying I just
[40:40] don't seem to hear from God no
[40:43] more I talking to anybody
[40:46] here come on now I just don't hear I
[40:49] used to hear him and I just don't seem
[40:51] to hear him
[40:52] anymore I just don't feel like myself
[40:56] anymore don't even feel like coming to
[40:59] church I don't feel like being around
[41:03] people am I talking to
[41:09] anyone That's what Satan
[41:11] wants crawl in a cave and don't be
[41:14] around

[42:23] you's going on the only ones that will
[42:27] catch the thoughts of
[42:30] God are those that were predestinated

[44:59] done I don't want him to catch me
[45:03] sleeping
[45:05] night there was a cry the Bible says
[45:08] they all
[45:10] slumbered but when the Cry came
[45:13] for what was it it was the
[45:16] groom it was it was behold the
[45:19] bridegroom
[45:20] coming somebody was announcing
[45:23] that that's why God sent a prophet
[45:27] and if we don't hear the
[45:29] prophet then you don't hear the the the
[45:33] voice that will wake you from your
[45:35] slumbering and
[45:37] sleeping simple as
[45:39] that I don't need to hear that I don't
[45:42] need to hear the
[45:44] messages now you're going to one side or
[45:46] the
[45:47] other you got
[45:49] to The Voice already said behold the
[45:52] bridegroom
[45:54] comes go ye out to me
[45:58] all right every person here every person
[46:01] in the
[46:02] world has a story sit down with every
[46:06] each one of you and all of you can say
[46:09] this is my
[46:11] story I was born with these
[46:14] parents I was born in this town I was
[46:17] raised in this town I went to this
[46:20] school L and on and on we all have
[46:24] stories amen everybody's got a story
[46:27] but I'm here to tell you
[46:30] something not every story is a
[46:36] parable I'm going to say that again not
[46:39] every story is a
[46:42] parable nor is every part of your life a
[46:48] parable and let that one sit I'm and I
[46:51] and I and I gave you that for a moment
[46:54] so you can see it later
[46:55] on not every story is a
[47:00] parable because not every
[47:04] story has a Heavenly
[47:08] meaning all right we have a lot of
[47:11] Earthly
[47:13] stories that that guy I'm about to punch
[47:16] his lights
[47:17] out what is that that's just an Earthly
[47:22] story I made a mistake I did this and
[47:25] this and this
[47:28] Earthly story there's nothing Heavenly
[47:30] about
[47:31] that are you with me come on I want you
[47:35] to put yourself in
[47:37] this we all have a
[47:40] story but it's not all part of the
[47:45] parable Matthew
[47:48] 11:25 and at that
[47:50] time Jesus answered and said I thank
[47:54] thee oh
[47:55] Father Lord of Heaven and
[48:02] Earth because thou has hid these
[48:05] things from the wise and prudent and has
[48:09] revealed them unto
[48:12] babes Jesus calls his father here Lord
[48:16] of Heaven and
[48:19] Earth he said I thank the old father
[48:22] Lord of Heaven and
[48:24] Earth ah here we are is Lord of the
[48:29] parable he's lord of the Heavenly
[48:33] meaning
[48:35] Earth which you need both to make a
[48:39] parable okay okay now watch now so you
[48:42] need the three parts you need the Lord
[48:45] you need the Heavenly part and the
[48:48] Earthly part and without the
[48:52] lordship it's just a
[48:54] story that's why brother Bram said says
[48:57] this you have made him your
[49:00] savior but is he your
[49:03] lord lord means total
[49:07] ownership I don't feel like doing
[49:09] that he's not total
[49:12] ownership that's why we do all the
[49:14] things we
[49:20] do want these things to hit
[49:23] home now Jesus is saying thou H has
[49:29] hid concealed it means to conceal or
[49:32] kept a
[49:36] secret you've kept this secret these
[49:39] things from the wise and The
[49:42] Prudent and has revealed them and the
[49:46] word reveal means to take the cover
[49:49] off taken the cover
[49:52] off you've revealed them unto
[49:55] babies
[49:57] now he didn't say babies
[50:01] here he said You' revealed them unto
[50:04] babes wait a minute I got to stop here
[50:08] because sometimes my mind just doesn't
[50:10] register things
[50:14] right if a baby is is an
[50:18] unskilled an an infant
[50:22] immature can't talk no
[50:25] teeth how are you going to reveal hidden
[50:30] things how are you going to reveal
[50:32] Parables how are you going to reveal
[50:35] Mysteries to a
[50:39] babe this doesn't make sense to
[50:41] me how I revealed them unto
[50:45] babes ah wow so now here's my first
[50:49] problem and I got a I got to work
[50:51] through
[50:52] this the baby cannot grasp these things
[50:58] once again he didn't say
[51:00] baby he said
[51:02] babes notice this now they are not just
[51:07] babes but these ones he's talking
[51:11] about are spoken word
[51:16] babes that which is born of the
[51:20] flesh is flesh Earthly story but that
[51:25] which is born of the spirit
[51:29] Spirit now we're talking about
[51:31] babes that are coming forth from the
[51:34] spoken
[51:36] word they are brother Bram calls them
[51:39] word

[51:47] somewhere here is the secret that's been
[51:51] hid where's he hiding
[51:54] them in the word
[52:01] I'm going to say it again where is he
[52:03] hiding

[52:30] word is the Original
[52:34] Seed so what is it that's

[1:00:11] story whose
[1:00:17] story some of you are
[1:00:23] sure brother Braham says this
[1:00:26] The Book of Revelations is not the story
[1:00:29] of John's
[1:00:31] life nor is it the story of the life of
[1:00:35] Jesus of 2000 years ago the Book of
[1:00:38] Revelation is not his story when he was
[1:00:41] here on
[1:00:42] Earth it is the
[1:00:45] story of
[1:00:48] Christ in future
[1:00:51] ages amen oh this story is the parable
[1:00:57] this is where we're going this
[1:00:59] morning this this is the story of Christ
[1:01:03] in future
[1:01:05] AG but he's not in that body no
[1:01:08] more how can it be his
[1:01:11] story because now he is in another
[1:01:14] body now he is in his mystical
[1:01:18] body and the Book of
[1:01:20] Revelation is his story that he's living
[1:01:24] out through you and I
[1:01:27] but the Earthly has got to catch the
[1:01:30] spiritual or else you'll never see
[1:01:33] yourself
[1:01:34] there all right watch this now see it
[1:01:37] was a
[1:01:39] prophecy this is is is so tremendous to
[1:01:43] me because the Book of
[1:01:45] Revelations has more symbols than any
[1:01:48] other
[1:01:49] book the only other book that has those
[1:01:52] probably close to that is the Book of
[1:01:55] Ezekiel I would say
[1:01:58] it's nothing but a book of
[1:02:00] symbols and the
[1:02:03] symbol behind the symbol is is there's
[1:02:06] something that's that's
[1:02:08] hidden I can show you
[1:02:10] water behind this water or this water is
[1:02:13] signifying something
[1:02:15] else if in a vision I see a wa I see
[1:02:18] this bottle of water there got to be a a
[1:02:22] spiritual meaning to
[1:02:24] this what is that okay we're going to
[1:02:27] find all this
[1:02:29] out it's a it's it's full of
[1:02:33] symbols that need natural
[1:02:37] people in order to display spiritual
[1:02:42] truths believe in the Book of
[1:02:44] Revelations There Are Spiritual
[1:02:48] truths spiritual
[1:02:51] truth it is not a
[1:02:53] parable it's just spiritual truth
[1:02:57] but once again it needs a natural
[1:03:01] form or an image to take the spiritual
[1:03:05] truths and the only way to take
[1:03:08] them the angel tells John eat all the
[1:03:15] book don't just eat what you like in
[1:03:18] church I believe that but I don't like
[1:03:21] that the whole
[1:03:24] book because in the whole B book are all
[1:03:26] the
[1:03:28] symbols and when those symbols can put
[1:03:30] on Flesh and
[1:03:32] Blood got a parable going on
[1:03:36] now that's what we're after this
[1:03:39] morning acts 18
[1:03:41] says shall receive
[1:03:43] power after that the Holy Ghost is come
[1:03:46] upon
[1:03:49] you you'll be
[1:03:53] Witnesses let me read it again
[1:03:56] I'm going to do what brother Danny
[1:03:58] does let me read it
[1:04:01] again you shall receive
[1:04:04] power after the Holy Ghost has come upon
[1:04:08] you then you part
[1:04:12] Parable right you're not part of the
[1:04:15] parable until after the Holy Ghost has
[1:04:17] come upon
[1:04:19] you because the parable is the natural
[1:04:24] Story the spirit spiritual
[1:04:27] meaning oh okay so then the
[1:04:32] natural is only a witness that the
[1:04:34] spiritual is
[1:04:37] here
[1:04:40] right I don't know if you got that I'm
[1:04:42] going to say it again the natural only
[1:04:45] shows that the
[1:04:49] spiritual oh I like
[1:04:52] this it brings you
[1:04:56] remember remember this only the bride of
[1:04:59] Christ is the real
[1:05:02] Parable all other lives are stories with
[1:05:05] no Eternal or Heavenly
[1:05:09] meaning can I ask you the question we've
[1:05:11] heard this many times what is the New
[1:05:21] Birth the revelation of Jesus
[1:05:24] Christ personal
[1:05:25] [Music]
[1:05:31] can you say
[1:05:33] that personal is the revelation of Jesus
[1:05:38] Christ
[1:05:39] personally to
[1:05:43] Caleb why is he revealing himself to
[1:05:48] us bring us into the
[1:05:50] parable not hard right to bring us into
[1:05:55] his story
[1:05:57] story remember the Book of Revelations
[1:05:59] is the story of Christ in future
[1:06:03] ages the The Book of
[1:06:05] Revelations the story of
[1:06:07] Christ in future re future
[1:06:11] ages but it's not Future No
[1:06:17] More it was future back then when John
[1:06:21] wrote it it was future this is his story
[1:06:24] in the future
[1:06:26] future age but not no more we're at the
[1:06:29] end of the story already we're at the
[1:06:32] end of the
[1:06:34] dispensation come on Church we're at the
[1:06:36] end of the
[1:06:38] book it's not Future No More he is here
[1:06:42] he is present and he's the same in every
[1:06:49] detail this is why Satan fights us so
[1:06:54] much how many of you have the new
[1:06:58] birth how many of you want the new
[1:07:01] birth why does Satan fight you so much
[1:07:04] for the new
[1:07:06] birth fight all of us so much for
[1:07:11] the because he
[1:07:13] knows that in those
[1:07:16] babes are there going to be the secrets
[1:07:20] secret he's trying to he's trying to
[1:07:22] keep you from being a babe A Spoken Word
[1:07:24] babe
[1:07:28] that when it is revealed to
[1:07:31] you through you it is the greatest
[1:07:34] worship that God could ever
[1:07:38] receive it's when the natural receives
[1:07:41] the
[1:07:42] spiritual there Harmony
[1:07:46] together the greatest worship is not how
[1:07:48] much we jump in Shou in
[1:07:51] church even though we should do all
[1:07:54] those things greatest worship when his
[1:07:58] life com into the
[1:08:01] believer through you is able to live his
[1:08:05] life and produce his
[1:08:09] story now this is where we're at why is
[1:08:12] there so many few new
[1:08:18] births come on I'm gonna get to I want
[1:08:20] to get to the nitty-gritty of all
[1:08:22] this there's no reason why
[1:08:26] why day after
[1:08:28] day week after week year after year we
[1:08:32] don't get the new
[1:08:34] birth that is nonsense to
[1:08:37] me how many of you want the new
[1:08:43] birth why is it that there's so
[1:08:46] few remember there's three stages of
[1:08:49] Grace is that right that bring us to a
[1:08:51] new
[1:08:53] birth but I'll tell you why why there's
[1:08:55] so few new
[1:08:58] births because there's so much
[1:09:00] unconfessed
[1:09:06] sin why beat around the
[1:09:11] bush you want to
[1:09:13] repent then
[1:09:15] repent and clean out the closets
[1:09:19] completely C to the Lord C to the ones
[1:09:22] that you've sinned
[1:09:24] against have a real
[1:09:27] repentance we've said this many
[1:09:30] times to repent is not to say I'm
[1:09:34] sorry that's all we know how to say as
[1:09:38] humans I'm sorry for doing that I'm
[1:09:41] sorry for doing that against you I'm
[1:09:43] sorry brother says nothing but a bunch
[1:09:45] of dry-eyed
[1:09:48] confessions he said you want a real
[1:09:51] repentance me that if you're walking one
[1:09:54] way
[1:09:55] stop turn around start walking again the
[1:09:59] another
[1:10:00] way that's a real
[1:10:03] repentance until then you're just taking
[1:10:06] a break from
[1:10:09] things oh come on now are we part of the
[1:10:11] parable or
[1:10:13] not that's all we do is take
[1:10:16] breaks oh yeah we' like to hit up on
[1:10:18] that some little marijuana every now and
[1:10:21] then I okay Lord I'm going to get
[1:10:23] serious with you
[1:10:26] and then we oh man two weeks pass man we
[1:10:29] doing good
[1:10:31] on boom boom
[1:10:35] boom back to the same
[1:10:38] thing what happened you did not
[1:10:46] repent are you with me Church come on
[1:10:49] now you want me to keep going today
[1:10:52] you're going to have to pull it from
[1:10:54] me we do we always go back to these
[1:10:58] things because the nature in US is
[1:11:01] calling for
[1:11:02] that but until we're born
[1:11:05] again because we have repented
[1:11:09] properly God can do something with
[1:11:13] us that's the greatest hindrance to
[1:11:17] God unconfessed
[1:11:21] sin now you fill in your blanks there
[1:11:23] with in your life
[1:11:27] you think that you're in the stage in
[1:11:29] another stage I think I'm in another
[1:11:32] stage keep
[1:11:35] regressing
[1:11:37] why you never
[1:11:41] repent well I was birthed yeah there's a
[1:11:45] lot of births going on churches are full
[1:11:47] of church
[1:11:51] children oh come on now the churches are
[1:11:55] full this
[1:11:56] morning church
[1:11:59] children that are a million miles from
[1:12:02] the kingdom of
[1:12:04] God either we we either we get serious
[1:12:07] or we
[1:12:08] don't or we just play Church to church
[1:12:12] put on a nice suit looking nice nice
[1:12:16] dress smile to
[1:12:18] everybody be behind that smile is
[1:12:21] nothing but
[1:12:24] agony
[1:12:27] depression the dumps somebody's coming
[1:12:30] oh how are
[1:12:36] you what's going on Church
[1:12:40] children he's not looking for Church
[1:12:43] children's looking for those that he can
[1:12:45] empty himself
[1:12:49] into notice this now you may be birthed
[1:12:52] as a church
[1:12:54] babe but have you ever been born in
[1:12:57] Christ that's why there's so many
[1:13:00] people that's why there's so many
[1:13:03] people that are children of the church
[1:13:06] and not word
[1:13:08] children and Christ doesn't reveal his
[1:13:11] secrets to Children of the
[1:13:15] church they are not part of the
[1:13:18] parable oh we're going to get to
[1:13:20] something good I'm just barely this is
[1:13:21] this is just barely
[1:13:23] getting ready for you
[1:13:28] you see a babe not only is someone
[1:13:31] unskillful or
[1:13:34] immature come on where's the symbol now
[1:13:36] here we go a babe also is a new
[1:13:40] birth new
[1:13:42] life it's an there's an innocence to a
[1:13:46] baby oh now we're decoding the
[1:13:50] symbol this could mean one thing to him
[1:13:56] and it could mean something else to
[1:13:59] me if brother if if brother emelo worked
[1:14:02] at a recycling
[1:14:05] plant he would say drink the water so I
[1:14:07] can take take the bottle bottle is
[1:14:10] important to him if you're dying of
[1:14:13] thirst car about the
[1:14:15] bottle right it can mean different
[1:14:18] things to different
[1:14:20] people I I say that for a reason
[1:14:23] here in the in theage the
[1:14:25] Rapture I'm going to skip that real
[1:14:27] quick because I because I want to get to
[1:14:29] something
[1:14:29] here but watch this now John 312 and 13
[1:14:33] listen
[1:14:35] closely when you have it you can say
[1:14:37] Amen how many are with
[1:14:39] me this
[1:14:41] is the most important message I've ever
[1:14:44] preached to
[1:14:48] you if I have told you Earthly
[1:14:53] things and ye believe believe
[1:14:56] not how shall ye
[1:14:59] believe if I tell you
[1:15:05] Heavenly we know Earthly
[1:15:07] things but how are you going to
[1:15:09] understand Heavenly
[1:15:11] things the parable hides the
[1:15:15] mystery and the Earthly or the
[1:15:19] natural is the Earth and
[1:15:21] vessel and that's where he keeps his
[1:15:24] secrets
[1:15:27] that's where he keeps his important
[1:15:30] papers in the old days that's the way
[1:15:34] they would do it where's the deed of
[1:15:36] your
[1:15:42] house was on a
[1:15:48] paper they would make earn vessels clay
[1:15:53] what and they would put the Deeds
[1:15:56] inside there that's where they were
[1:16:00] at somebody need the
[1:16:04] deed it's in this earth
[1:16:07] in all right all right Jeremiah 32 says
[1:16:11] this thus sayith the Lord of hosts the
[1:16:14] god of Israel take these
[1:16:19] evidences take these
[1:16:22] evidences this evidence of the per
[1:16:26] purchase both which is sealed and this
[1:16:28] evidence which is
[1:16:31] open and put them in an earn
[1:16:35] vessel that they may continue many
[1:16:38] days if I had time I would go into the
[1:16:40] seals right
[1:16:41] now right is that right that's what the
[1:16:44] seals did that's what it brought back to
[1:16:47] us it was the title de book of
[1:16:50] redemption and it was to be
[1:16:53] deposited in the
[1:16:58] parable who is it going to be deposited
[1:17:01] in all right here we go Earthly story
[1:17:06] your Earthly story I'm a
[1:17:08] vessel something's been
[1:17:10] deposited watch this now 2 Corinthians
[1:17:15] 4:7 but we have this
[1:17:19] treasure in Earth and
[1:17:21] vessels amen treasure x marks the spot
[1:17:28] right going with a treasure
[1:17:32] map all
[1:17:33] right we're trying to find where the x
[1:17:35] is
[1:17:37] at okay okay here's here it is on the
[1:17:40] map we have this
[1:17:42] treasure in Earth and
[1:17:44] vessels that the Excellency of the power
[1:17:46] may be of God and not of
[1:17:50] us why it's the story of Christ and we
[1:17:54] are part of
[1:17:55] Christ that's why the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:17:57] is liken
[1:18:00] unto it's compared to your story is an
[1:18:05] Earthly
[1:18:06] story but with the significance of a of
[1:18:09] the
[1:18:11] Heavenly and because you're in the
[1:18:14] Kingdom you're a citizen of the
[1:18:17] kingdom and therefore Heaven and Earth
[1:18:20] have
[1:18:21] United okay come on church we get so
[1:18:24] caught up with the Earthly
[1:18:27] story we forget the part of the
[1:18:33] parable I don't have no money for my
[1:18:38] rent I have no money for
[1:18:42] this we get so caught
[1:18:47] up
[1:18:53] Sparrow does he work about where he's
[1:18:55] going to get his
[1:18:57] food worry about where he's going to
[1:18:59] live yet we
[1:19:01] do we're outside of the
[1:19:05] parable because in the
[1:19:08] parable all things are
[1:19:10] possible in the parable ask whatever you
[1:19:13] want and it'll be given to you in the
[1:19:17] parable forgiveness in the parable is
[1:19:20] joy caling down in the dumps get into
[1:19:23] the parable in the parable is
[1:19:26] longsuffering gentleness goodness let's
[1:19:30] get into the parable Church we're living
[1:19:33] in the
[1:19:34] natural and there is no spiritual
[1:19:36] meaning to
[1:19:38] that this is what the Holy Ghost is
[1:19:40] shaking us this
[1:19:43] morning notice this now I'll tell you
[1:19:45] the
[1:19:47] parable the mystery that your Earthly
[1:19:50] story has a Heavenly
[1:19:53] meaning
[1:19:55] who am I talking to right
[1:19:57] now oh Heavenly
[1:20:00] signs Earthly
[1:20:03] signs we're going to get into
[1:20:08] something Isaiah 7:4
[1:20:11] says the Lord himself shall give you a
[1:20:15] sign Heavenly or
[1:20:19] Earthly if the Lord's giving it he is
[1:20:22] the Lord of Heaven and Earth so if he's
[1:20:25] it's an Earthly sign and a Heavenly
[1:20:28] sign he doesn't give half a
[1:20:30] sign he shows it and then he produces it
[1:20:35] watch now I'll give you a sign Behold a
[1:20:38] virgin shall
[1:20:40] conceive that's a
[1:20:42] parable there's got to be a virgin that
[1:20:44] will fulfill
[1:20:46] this God is saying Behold a virgin shall
[1:20:50] conceive and bear a
[1:20:52] son what an earth story with a Heavenly
[1:20:57] meaning let's pay attention to the
[1:21:00] Parables the details of the
[1:21:03] story watch what David said I believe it
[1:21:05] was David in Psalms
[1:21:08] 49 sharpen your
[1:21:11] hearing sharpen your
[1:21:14] hearing I will incline my ear to a
[1:21:19] parable we incline our ear to many
[1:21:23] things especially chees Miss and
[1:21:27] right gossip and all the
[1:21:30] things
[1:21:33] really oh see kind of knew something was
[1:21:38] up I kind of I kind of
[1:21:41] figure did you ever pray for that person
[1:21:44] because you knew something was
[1:21:46] up no we don't do that that's out of the
[1:21:50] parable that's natural
[1:21:53] physical
[1:21:55] amen I will incline my
[1:21:59] ear
[1:22:00] Parable I want to know the how many of
[1:22:02] you want to know the
[1:22:04] parable incline your ear to it faith
[1:22:07] comes by hearing and the hearing of the
[1:22:11] word of God why are we not inclining our
[1:22:14] ear to
[1:22:17] that right let's continue we talk about
[1:22:20] other about about others without knowing
[1:22:23] the parable
[1:22:27] do you know if that person that is doing
[1:22:30] that or what they did do you know if it
[1:22:33] was part of the parable or
[1:22:35] not and you speak against it you're
[1:22:38] speaking against the
[1:22:39] parable stop for a moment here's
[1:22:43] Isaiah the Lord says I want you to strip
[1:22:45] down
[1:22:47] naked and I want you to walk the
[1:22:50] streets for three
[1:22:52] years naked walk in the streets for
[1:22:55] three
[1:22:58] years imagine the thoughts of the
[1:23:08] people at him St and think about that
[1:23:11] for a
[1:23:12] moment yet his
[1:23:15] life was a
[1:23:17] parable cuz he says what you're
[1:23:20] doing got another meaning to it the
[1:23:23] people could only see a naked man
[1:23:26] walking but the parable was
[1:23:29] showing destruction to
[1:23:32] Egypt and to these other
[1:23:35] nations by him doing
[1:23:37] that how do you know if God didn't tell
[1:23:40] that person to do
[1:23:42] that do you know the parable
[1:23:47] enough know if what is being done is
[1:23:50] actually God is telling them to do
[1:23:53] that open up your hearing I'll hear the
[1:23:58] parable are you with me you catch these
[1:24:02] things because it's very important
[1:24:05] listen now listen as this unfolds
[1:24:07] here think about
[1:24:10] this how many sons did Abraham
[1:24:14] have when he when he was told by God to
[1:24:16] sacrifice his
[1:24:21] son let me hear come on
[1:24:25] two we got a two everybody in
[1:24:27] agreement okay can you name me his
[1:24:31] sons okay God says sacrifice your son
[1:24:35] yeah yeah two sons every been agreement
[1:24:37] okay let's read let's read Galatians
[1:24:43] 4 and verse
[1:24:46] 22 for it is written that Abraham had
[1:24:49] two
[1:24:51] sons one by a bond made
[1:24:55] this is this is tremendous don't don't
[1:24:56] miss this the other by a free
[1:24:59] woman but he who was of the Bond woman
[1:25:02] was born after the
[1:25:04] Flesh in other words it only he only had
[1:25:07] an Earthly
[1:25:09] story ishma only has an Earthly
[1:25:14] story theyve got money they got all
[1:25:16] these things they only have Earthly
[1:25:19] because they were born from the Bond
[1:25:20] woman he was born from the Bond
[1:25:23] woman but he of the free
[1:25:26] woman was by the
[1:25:29] promise watch and here's the point of
[1:25:31] all
[1:25:33] this which things are an
[1:25:37] allegory now you're going to have to
[1:25:39] take the
[1:25:41] allegory Parable there's an allegory and
[1:25:45] in the
[1:25:46] allegory Abraham had two
[1:25:48] sons in the Earthly
[1:25:51] story Abraham had two sons
[1:25:56] period that's an
[1:25:57] allegory because an
[1:26:00] allegory always looks back to the
[1:26:03] past that's why Satan's not afraid of
[1:26:05] the
[1:26:07] allegory he's afraid of the
[1:26:10] parable once again here's the these
[1:26:14] things Bond woman free woman writing to
[1:26:18] the
[1:26:19] Galatians are an
[1:26:21] allegory it's always an allegory is
[1:26:24] always always stated in the past
[1:26:26] tense never in the future it simply
[1:26:30] brings out the
[1:26:32] teachings from the past
[1:26:34] events but he understand that that's an
[1:26:37] allegory Abraham having two sons is an
[1:26:41] allegory they are events that happened
[1:26:43] in the life of Abraham as a
[1:26:47] man but everything that Abraham
[1:26:52] did was part of the
[1:26:56] parable listen to this and get this
[1:26:59] church not everything that Abraham did
[1:27:02] was part of the
[1:27:05] parable it was an
[1:27:07] allegory something to learn
[1:27:10] from but watch now the parable
[1:27:15] unfold If Abraham had two
[1:27:19] sons why does the Bible say Genesis
[1:27:23] 222
[1:27:25] he said take now thy
[1:27:28] son thine only
[1:27:33] son oh Church get this I'm going to say
[1:27:36] it again I thought he had
[1:27:38] two under the allegory he's got two but
[1:27:42] under the parable he's only got
[1:27:45] one because when you put it side by
[1:27:49] side it doesn't
[1:27:51] match until there's only one son Jesus
[1:27:56] or God didn't have many
[1:27:58] sons he had only one begotten
[1:28:02] Son stories to
[1:28:05] fit Abraham could only have one
[1:28:09] son how many are with me
[1:28:12] Hallelujah take now thy son th only
[1:28:15] son verse 16 and said by myself have I
[1:28:21] sworn sayth the Lord for because thou
[1:28:24] Hast done this
[1:28:26] thing and has not withheld thy
[1:28:30] son th only son oh here we are Hebrews
[1:28:36] 11:7 for by faith
[1:28:39] Abraham when he was
[1:28:42] tried he offered up
[1:28:45] Isaac he offered up Isaac and he that
[1:28:49] had received the
[1:28:52] promises offered up his only begotten
[1:28:56] son of whom it was said that in Isaac
[1:29:01] shall thy seed be
[1:29:03] called that's the
[1:29:06] parable accounting that God was able to
[1:29:09] raise him
[1:29:11] up even from the
[1:29:14] dead from when
[1:29:17] also he received him in a
[1:29:22] figure that word figure there in the
[1:29:25] Greek the same word as
[1:29:29] Parable say look it
[1:29:31] up that's the same thing he raised him
[1:29:34] up he received him in a
[1:29:38] figure me and my son will both
[1:29:42] return that's the
[1:29:44] parable oh I like this now are you with
[1:29:46] me now now we're we're going to get into
[1:29:48] some some more good stuff hold on with
[1:29:50] me do you see Satan is not not you don't
[1:29:55] care if you know the
[1:29:58] allegory but yet the allegories is there
[1:30:02] that we can learn from their
[1:30:04] stories but in the
[1:30:07] allegory is all the
[1:30:10] stries the
[1:30:12] wars the
[1:30:14] differences the struggles in the home
[1:30:18] of Abraham oh he was his life is the
[1:30:22] parable certain parts
[1:30:27] stop for a moment I want you to get
[1:30:30] Abraham brother Bram
[1:30:33] says he staggered all over the
[1:30:39] place and we say oh no Abraham didn't
[1:30:41] stag he staged
[1:30:43] all his wife saying well go ahead and
[1:30:45] take take
[1:30:47] Hagar do that wow okay he he was doing
[1:30:52] things that were not part of the par
[1:30:56] yet in the in the in the story
[1:30:59] line those things
[1:31:01] exist but not for the parable
[1:31:05] sake am here with me not for the parable
[1:31:08] sake here he is and this is this is what
[1:31:12] gets me he staggered all over the
[1:31:16] place until
[1:31:19] AA until
[1:31:22] churcha when Paul begins to
[1:31:28] write he writes this watch here's the
[1:31:31] parable he never says Abraham staggered
[1:31:34] here and here and here he did
[1:31:37] this begins to write under the
[1:31:39] inspiration all scripture is
[1:31:42] written it is God
[1:31:46] breathed that's not your concern you
[1:31:49] write what I tell
[1:31:51] you Abraham AB
[1:31:55] staggered
[1:31:57] not at the
[1:31:59] promise I'm going to say it again he he
[1:32:02] staggered all over the place yes but not
[1:32:05] at the
[1:32:06] promise we can stagger all over the
[1:32:09] place and Satan will use that against
[1:32:12] us they'll say you're worthless you're
[1:32:15] no good but that's not part of the
[1:32:19] parable because when it comes to the
[1:32:22] promise I am with you always even to the
[1:32:25] end of the
[1:32:26] ages when it comes to the
[1:32:29] promise True Believer will not stagger
[1:32:32] at
[1:32:33] that that's what we need to know this
[1:32:35] morning we might fail and we might fall
[1:32:39] but but we've got to
[1:32:42] repent and when we
[1:32:44] repent what does it do brings us back
[1:32:48] into the
[1:32:49] parable we step out of the parable at
[1:32:52] times but he gets his brother he puts a
[1:32:56] barricade there and says get back in
[1:32:59] line it won't be written about you what
[1:33:02] you did
[1:33:03] wrong as long as you have been made have
[1:33:06] made it
[1:33:08] right watch this now this is
[1:33:11] important the vision is the Heavenly or
[1:33:15] spiritual
[1:33:17] meaning and it is hidden in images
[1:33:22] and but a vision is is waiting for
[1:33:27] something it's waiting for the story to
[1:33:29] be carried
[1:33:31] out in the physical or natural
[1:33:35] realm a vision is projected into the one
[1:33:38] or ones that are fulfilling
[1:33:42] it a parable
[1:33:44] then is the mirror of the
[1:33:48] vision what the vision is
[1:33:52] showing here we go
[1:33:54] Parable now has has a a person an image
[1:33:58] of
[1:33:59] people that are there reflecting what
[1:34:02] the vision was
[1:34:04] showing in other words they're there to
[1:34:07] FF Vision this this is why I say this it
[1:34:11] is the
[1:34:12] images that is acting
[1:34:14] out what had been
[1:34:16] projected parables are not forced
[1:34:22] illustrations but rather the mirrors of
[1:34:25] spiritual
[1:34:28] things Parables prove that the
[1:34:32] external is the mirror in
[1:34:35] which we may behold the internal and the
[1:34:40] spiritual for all natural
[1:34:44] effects are based on spiritual
[1:34:48] causes write that down all natural
[1:34:51] effects are based on spiritual causes
[1:34:58] Parables a beautiful
[1:35:00] image from A Beautiful
[1:35:07] Mind when we see these
[1:35:09] things I want to get to this part
[1:35:12] now I want you to hear this and this is
[1:35:15] this is this is now this is the end end
[1:35:17] up end part of the
[1:35:19] message to take me just a little bit but
[1:35:22] follow me okay because we can preach
[1:35:24] forever and
[1:35:27] ever when James when Paul or James
[1:35:30] writes this I'm
[1:35:31] sorry he said for
[1:35:33] beholdeth we look into a glass
[1:35:39] right I'm going I'm going to do
[1:35:42] james23 for if any be a hearer of the
[1:35:45] word and not a
[1:35:46] doer he is like unto a man beholding his
[1:35:49] natural face in a
[1:35:52] glass
[1:35:59] for he beholdeth himself and goeth Away
[1:36:01] straight way forget what manner of man
[1:36:03] he
[1:36:07] was but who so lookth into the perfect
[1:36:10] law of
[1:36:13] Liberty and continueth
[1:36:17] therein he being not forgetful
[1:36:22] here forgetful
[1:36:25] he did Uncle preach last
[1:36:31] Sunday somebody said the atonement is
[1:36:34] that
[1:36:35] right what scripture did he
[1:36:41] use forgetful
[1:36:49] here but a doer of this
[1:36:51] work this man shall be bless in his
[1:36:54] deed that's why when we see modern
[1:36:57] events made clear by
[1:37:01] prophecy it means one thing to the
[1:37:03] believer and one thing to the
[1:37:06] unbeliever get this now now this is the
[1:37:08] important
[1:37:09] part watch this now watch the parable
[1:37:13] Heaven and Earth Earthly story Heavenly
[1:37:17] meaning in the beginning quote it with
[1:37:19] me in the
[1:37:21] beginning God created the
[1:37:24] what was he
[1:37:28] doing laying out the
[1:37:31] scene for the
[1:37:33] parable so he created the heavens and
[1:37:35] the
[1:37:36] Earth laying it out I'm going to need in
[1:37:39] this great mind of his I'm the heavens
[1:37:42] I'm gonna need the
[1:37:43] Earth show stuff in the heavens
[1:37:46] first they'll catch it on Earth and then
[1:37:50] those that capture it will be in
[1:37:52] harmony
[1:37:54] they'll know what I'm telling
[1:37:55] them come on church here I am this is
[1:37:59] this is what we're this is what all the
[1:38:01] messages about right
[1:38:02] now created the heavens and the Earth
[1:38:05] We're Going bring it together they're
[1:38:07] going to know what I'm thinking and
[1:38:09] therefore they'll come back to me that's
[1:38:12] the whole
[1:38:14] Parable they came down and now they're
[1:38:16] going to come
[1:38:17] back watch this now and this and this is
[1:38:19] where it gets
[1:38:21] good he prepared the stage for the
[1:38:25] parable to
[1:38:26] unfold God always declares it
[1:38:32] where come on I want everybody because
[1:38:34] you got to get with me in this he
[1:38:36] declares it
[1:38:38] where where tell your neighbor neighbor
[1:38:43] where does he declare
[1:38:47] it in the heaven first ah okay brother
[1:38:52] Bram says that he CES it in the heavens
[1:38:54] before he does it on
[1:38:57] Earth he always does
[1:39:02] that oh and he shows his signs in the
[1:39:05] heavens
[1:39:07] first how many know the story of of
[1:39:12] Jonah right all right if we go down we
[1:39:15] can see he's going to Nineveh and
[1:39:17] supposed to go to ninev all these things
[1:39:20] happened and he ended up going to
[1:39:22] tarus
[1:39:23] they say tarus is is like on the other
[1:39:25] side of the
[1:39:27] Mediterranean 2500 miles away he was
[1:39:31] going we know the story how the Lord he
[1:39:34] was thrown over and the Lord provided
[1:39:35] and made a fish and so
[1:39:38] forth but when he finally got
[1:39:42] there this is the gist now when he
[1:39:44] finally got there he had a message to
[1:39:48] tell what was the
[1:39:51] message repent or perish
[1:39:54] right simple that was the
[1:39:57] message this is Jesus now
[1:40:00] talking
[1:40:02] 12 verse
[1:40:04] 38 the Ser of the scribes and of the
[1:40:06] Pharisees answered and said Master we
[1:40:08] would see a sign from
[1:40:14] thee an evil an adulterous generation
[1:40:18] seeketh after
[1:40:22] aign sign be
[1:40:25] given but the sign of the Prophet
[1:40:28] Jonas here we go now listen closely
[1:40:31] pinch yourself pinch yourself this
[1:40:33] morning no sign will be given an evil
[1:40:35] and adulterous
[1:40:38] generation but the sign of the Prophet
[1:40:42] Jonas of all the
[1:40:44] stories why did he pick the story of
[1:40:52] Jonah
[1:41:01] because he wants to prove something to
[1:41:02] them to show them
[1:41:05] something and he's putting he's bringing
[1:41:08] Jonah from the
[1:41:09] past he's bringing his own
[1:41:12] life see how that they perfectly
[1:41:16] match other prophets were for different
[1:41:20] parts I'm not giving you no other sign
[1:41:23] but if you can comprehend
[1:41:25] Jonah you can comprehend
[1:41:28] me watch this now here we
[1:41:31] go no sign but the sign of the Prophet
[1:41:36] Jonas what was the sign of
[1:41:41] Jonas ministers hold on a second people
[1:41:44] know
[1:41:45] this what was the sign of the Prophet
[1:41:51] Jonas very good some somebody got it
[1:41:53] over there the sign of the Prophet Jonas
[1:41:55] was the sign of the
[1:41:58] Resurrection I will not give this evil
[1:42:00] and adulterous generation no other
[1:42:04] sign but the sign of the Prophet Jonas
[1:42:07] or the sign of the
[1:42:09] Resurrection they're not going to see
[1:42:11] any other sign if you can receive the
[1:42:14] prophet then you can see me receive
[1:42:19] me watch this now this is Brother Bram
[1:42:22] now he says as the son of man as Jonah
[1:42:26] was in the whale three days three
[1:42:29] nights the son of man lay in the heart
[1:42:31] of the earth three days and three
[1:42:33] nights brother R says watch the parable
[1:42:35] brother Ram
[1:42:36] says then
[1:42:38] listen bring it to
[1:42:41] yourself that's good back in history
[1:42:45] right
[1:42:48] allegory oh Jonah ran away from God he
[1:42:50] did
[1:42:51] all God's even worried about
[1:42:54] that he knew he'd get him
[1:42:57] back cuz the parable had to
[1:43:00] unfold bring it to
[1:43:02] yourself it may be a new light on the
[1:43:08] scriptures here we go come on now here's
[1:43:10] the
[1:43:11] parable it may be a new light on the
[1:43:13] scriptures think of it like
[1:43:15] that it may be something but it's in the
[1:43:19] scripture the sign of Jonas would be the
[1:43:22] sign of the Resurrection
[1:43:25] they seek after ass sign the wicked and
[1:43:27] adulterous
[1:43:30] generation and now he says we got
[1:43:33] Resurrection by
[1:43:36] history but then we got Resurrection by
[1:43:40] sign though that is the theme of our of
[1:43:44] our of our
[1:43:45] services Resurrection by history or
[1:43:48] Resurrection by
[1:43:50] signs do you know the resurrection
[1:43:53] do you know it by history because the
[1:43:56] Bible says because somebody told you or
[1:43:59] do you know it by
[1:44:00] sign he said let's put new light on this
[1:44:05] scripture has now come to
[1:44:08] us we that him in US is the
[1:44:14] resurrection I am the resurrection and
[1:44:16] the
[1:44:17] life and no sign shall be given to them
[1:44:22] but the sign of the prophet
[1:44:24] Jonah what happened in the time time of
[1:44:27] Jonah go back and listen to what what
[1:44:29] the elders
[1:44:31] spoke how many love what the Elder when
[1:44:33] he speak his teachings love his
[1:44:37] teachings back in here what happened
[1:44:40] during the time of
[1:44:41] Jonah
[1:44:44] anybody somebody
[1:44:47] got the brother remember you got a
[1:44:49] student hereo right here there was an
[1:44:52] eclipse
[1:44:55] where does it say that study your
[1:44:58] history go back all the Assyrian books
[1:45:00] it shows an eclipse going on when Jonah

[1:45:19] adulterous generation any other
[1:45:21] sign
[1:45:23] of
[1:45:25] Resurrection watch now they received for
[1:45:30] forgiven a sign but a true sign
[1:45:38] overlooked sign overlooked is the
[1:45:40] prophet he sent the prophet they
[1:45:42] overlook him
[1:45:43] out oh Jesus is coming Jesus is coming
[1:45:47] and they're missing the
[1:45:48] sign and and when you miss the sign you
[1:45:50] miss the
[1:45:51] parable
[1:45:54] okay watch this now the sign of the
[1:45:57] Resurrection The Sign of Jonah and God
[1:46:00] shows it in the heavens
[1:46:03] first when this when this solar eclipse
[1:46:07] happened the
[1:46:09] ninevites beli that a an
[1:46:14] eclipse was a precursor to God's
[1:46:17] judgment yes or yes is that right Theo
[1:46:21] that's right I got I got backup now how
[1:46:24] you like
[1:46:27] that an an an eclipse and then was a
[1:46:31] precursor to
[1:46:34] God's okay so
[1:46:36] either they had to have seen in the
[1:46:39] heavens
[1:46:40] first and that's why they knew that
[1:46:43] something was
[1:46:47] coming imagine that they never knew this
[1:46:49] in their
[1:46:51] lifetime and now us what do we do we
[1:46:55] take signs like if they're
[1:46:57] nothing another Blood

[1:47:55] seven years
[1:47:56] ago there was a solar eclipse that
[1:47:59] crossed
[1:48:01] America going from the northeast or
[1:48:03] Northwest I'm sorry
[1:48:07] Southeast just in case you missed
[1:48:10] it it crossed over seven cities in
[1:48:14] America named Salem Salem the Salem
[1:48:19] Salem is the shortened name for
[1:48:21] Jerusalem
[1:48:24] what was he trying to tell
[1:48:26] us seven years he
[1:48:30] gave why because America
[1:48:35] parallels
[1:48:37] coincidence no no with the number two
[1:48:42] the second solar
[1:48:44] eclipse this

[1:49:33] America that are named
[1:49:38] n brother brandham says that Wicked and
[1:49:41] adulterous generation is right

[1:50:08] all of
[1:50:09] Canada that's named nineve and it's GNA
[1:50:12] cross there
[1:50:14] too if you want to know go online you
[1:50:16] can read all the Nineveh Texas Nineveh
[1:50:18] Missouri Indiana Ohio Pennsylvania New
[1:50:20] York Virginia
[1:50:24] that's where it's it's going
[1:50:25] up the eclipse is is hitting every
[1:50:30] Nineveh in America in America
[1:50:36] coincidence ninev means the house of
[1:50:40] fish it was the capital of the Syrian
[1:50:44] Empire now let's put this the next one
[1:50:47] up now where these two
[1:50:51] cross
[1:50:55] brother Ram says you get your own
[1:50:57] whatever you come what's the word he
[1:51:00] uses you come to your own conclusion is
[1:51:03] what look at
[1:51:05] that right where they cross it's a big X
[1:51:09] over the United
[1:51:10] States
[1:51:13] 1956 Bram says this nation will either
[1:51:18] accept or they'll reject it and I
[1:51:21] predict they will reject it
[1:51:24] says why later on he says they have sned
[1:51:26] away their day of
[1:51:32] Grace and I'm telling you this this this
[1:51:35] morning don't send away your day of
[1:51:39] Grace Church I cry unto you this morning
[1:51:43] as your pastor I cry to you don't send
[1:51:46] away your day of
[1:51:48] Grace how close are we Church throwing
[1:51:52] in the Heavens
[1:51:53] already a big X
[1:51:55] now now remember the X can be one thing
[1:51:59] to the believer and another thing to the
[1:52:03] unbel what does an
[1:52:06] mean in the Hebrew
[1:52:09] alphabet the old it's called tab is the
[1:52:12] last letter of the
[1:52:15] alphabet it is used as or sounds like
[1:52:18] the word
[1:52:19] t but it's the last in the Hebrew
[1:52:22] alphabet
[1:52:23] bit and in old times in the times of
[1:52:26] Ezekiel it was drawn As an X the last
[1:52:30] letter in the
[1:52:32] alphabet also symbolizes
[1:52:36] completion
[1:52:38] Perfection so while it's judgment to
[1:52:41] one completion and Perfection to someone
[1:52:45] else come on now Church where are you
[1:52:48] where are you today what does The X
[1:52:50] signify to you the X can be a
[1:52:55] signature I saw my grandparents use an X
[1:52:58] many
[1:53:01] times the X can Mark the Spot of the
[1:53:07] treasure the x in
[1:53:11] algebra is used as a
[1:53:14] variable for an unknown
[1:53:18] quantity an X
[1:53:20] symbolizes something
[1:53:23] known mystery and to the world we are a
[1:53:29] mystery to the world judgment to Us
[1:53:34] mystery
[1:53:35] hidden treasure
[1:53:38] [Music]
[1:53:39] hidden watch The Mystery of the parable
[1:53:43] now what was Jonah's
[1:53:46] message a message of
[1:53:51] repentance how many how many days did he
[1:53:53] give Jonah or did Jonah give them to
[1:53:57] repent come
[1:53:59] on he gave him 40 days to
[1:54:02] repent the king the people the animals
[1:54:07] all of them went on a
[1:54:09] fast all of them put on
[1:54:12] sackcloth crying to God forgive us
[1:54:15] Lord that's what we need this morning is
[1:54:18] a true repentance cry to God saying Lord
[1:54:22] for for me Lord I Repent or everything
[1:54:26] here's my heart open to
[1:54:28] you how much time do you think we have
[1:54:31] church when the skies the heavens are
[1:54:35] declaring there there's not a whole lot
[1:54:37] of time left as it was in the days of
[1:54:42] Jonah that's the parable catch it
[1:54:46] church it's unfolding right now in our
[1:54:50] midst just another one
[1:54:53] 40 days you know what 40 days from
[1:54:56] August 8th when that when that eclipse
[1:55:00] is May
[1:55:04] 18th International astronomy
[1:55:09] day what that supposed to
[1:55:12] mean well we're astronauts aren't
[1:55:16] we but the very next day after the 40
[1:55:21] days is
[1:55:24] Pentecost look it up we have been in the
[1:55:27] Pentecostal ages all through the church
[1:55:31] age of
[1:55:34] Pentecost now watch 40 days from then
[1:55:37] the very next day is the is
[1:55:42] Pentecost everyone's looking for a
[1:55:44] Revival
[1:55:45] now Catholic Church is looking for a
[1:55:47] real life they started in
[1:55:51] 2022 the Eucharistic
[1:55:54] Revival brother brandham says they take
[1:55:58] a
[1:55:58] little little piece of
[1:56:01] bread they say the church can transform
[1:56:03] it into the literal
[1:56:06] body and I say no
[1:56:11] way you want to know the body of the
[1:56:15] Lord Jesus on Earth
[1:56:19] today is made of flesh and blood
[1:56:22] it is the people that have been washed
[1:56:24] and transformed by the blood of the
[1:56:28] Lamb going on here they're looking for a
[1:56:31] little piece of bread I'm looking for
[1:56:33] the bread of
[1:56:34] life that has come down to earth and is
[1:56:38] dwelling in the hearts of the
[1:56:41] believer to do what to fulfill or unfold
[1:56:44] the parable
[1:56:46] Church noen notice this now and I'm and
[1:56:49] I'm I'm coming to to an end now just
[1:56:50] bear me a few moments
[1:56:54] coming to a place 40 days of
[1:56:58] repentance and I'm going to tell you in
[1:57:01] the name of the Lord now is the
[1:57:05] opportunity repent I don't care if you
[1:57:08] have to tell your wife everything you
[1:57:10] did what you've been up
[1:57:14] to because afterwards there is no more
[1:57:20] grace take advantage of the grace while
[1:57:23] it's here
[1:57:24] church because once it's taken it's
[1:57:29] done you want to make things right and
[1:57:31] it'll be too
[1:57:34] late but the Bible says let him that is
[1:57:37] filthy be
[1:57:41] filthy come on
[1:57:42] now you watch
[1:57:46] porn you'll end up staying being a porn
[1:57:49] Watcher that's what going to do let him

[1:57:54] adulterer you're going to stay an
[1:57:55] adulterer you're a liar you're going to

[1:58:01] filthy be filthy
[1:58:04] still but let him that's clean be
[1:58:08] clean you're a Son of God you're a
[1:58:12] Believer you'll stay a
[1:58:17] Believer church I know it's hard but I'm
[1:58:19] telling you I want you to make it
[1:58:22] I do not want to leave not one of you
[1:58:25] here this is pray from my heart I cry to

[1:58:41] now maned on
[1:58:44] Earth I'm going to add one last
[1:58:49] piece and when you add
[1:58:52] the eclipse that happened last October I
[1:58:57] believe what do you
[1:59:01] get if the X was the last letter of the
[1:59:06] Hebrew the first letter of the Greek
[1:59:08] alphabet is
[1:59:10] Alpha and to the
[1:59:12] believer that's
[1:59:14] showing I am Alpha and
[1:59:17] Omega I am the beginning and the
[1:59:19] end that has been with you
[1:59:23] is I that walks amongst
[1:59:25] you here amongst
[1:59:27] you
[1:59:29] and in the end
[1:59:32] last was which is and shall
[1:59:36] be all three of those things what does
[1:59:39] it show judgment to
[1:59:45] one Eternity for the
[1:59:49] others where do you find yourself this
[1:59:51] morning
[1:59:53] we can look at all this and say
[1:59:55] my Bleak it looks bad for the
[2:00:00] unbeliever but for the
[2:00:04] believer what a masterpiece he
[2:00:08] is what a masterpiece he's
[2:00:15] making I'm going to say it again what a
[2:00:18] masterpiece he could take you and I he
[2:00:22] could make Sons and
[2:00:24] Daughters people that were no good that
[2:00:27] were lost that had no hope and he could
[2:00:29] make us Sons and
[2:00:31] Daughters painting a

[2:01:32] of
[2:01:34] Grace God's Great
[2:01:38] Masterpiece and I want to tell you one
[2:01:41] thing here's the end of it okay you want
[2:01:45] to see where we're
[2:01:46] at there is only one one place in the
[2:01:50] United States
[2:01:53] that is named
[2:01:55] this and it's in the state of
[2:01:58] Indiana and it's right in the path of
[2:02:00] the
[2:02:03] eclipse I can't make this up
[2:02:05] church but it's right in the path of the
[2:02:09] eclipse and it's called Rapture India

[2:02:41] we I'm going to tell you how close we
[2:02:50] are such a hard week this
[2:02:54] week that
[2:02:58] all man all hell was
[2:03:04] hitting it was Battle after battle
[2:03:07] everywhere we
[2:03:09] returned it was such a joy to me to be
[2:03:12] in the middle of that
[2:03:14] battle it wasn't something bad it was a
[2:03:17] joy to be in that battle I said Lord
[2:03:20] because you're in the Forefront there's
[2:03:22] nothing to
[2:03:23] fear we took care of things one thing
[2:03:25] after another after another and it was
[2:03:27] the Lord working mightily in this week
[2:03:30] with
[2:03:31] people demons out of
[2:03:34] people Healing The
[2:03:37] Sick taking people lost and and and you
[2:03:41] can see the Lord transforming them right
[2:03:43] before my eyes I saw this I saw new
[2:03:47] births
[2:03:49] coming I was so tired on
[2:03:52] on Wednesday Thursday
[2:03:55] night finally went to
[2:03:58] sleep and lo and
[2:04:01] behold here's the
[2:04:04] parable I'm fast
[2:04:06] asleep and then in this I break open
[2:04:09] into whether a night vision or whatever
[2:04:11] you want to call
[2:04:13] it and it was me and brother Tommy and
[2:04:16] brother will Tommy will and we were
[2:04:19] climbing we had climbed this ladder and
[2:04:22] we got to this platform that we could
[2:04:23] see out very
[2:04:27] far looking around and I said this is
[2:04:30] what you call come up a little higher
[2:04:33] There Was An Open Door come up
[2:04:36] higher and about the time we're they up
[2:04:38] there looking
[2:04:39] around somebody's
[2:04:42] coming when I
[2:04:44] turn it's our founding
[2:04:46] Pastor he comes up doesn't say a word
[2:04:50] but gives me that smile that he love to
[2:04:54] give and all I could do was feel from
[2:04:57] within me from the treasures of my heart
[2:05:01] all I could feel was just
[2:05:03] love and I said Dad I love you and I got
[2:05:06] him I could feel
[2:05:09] him a dream I could feel
[2:05:12] him how close are we now church when
[2:05:16] when when the dead in Christ start to
[2:05:18] become
[2:05:19] visible how close are we hold him and I
[2:05:22] hugged him and I said dad I missed you
[2:05:26] about Time Boom it ends you don't want
[2:05:28] it to end you want to hold on to it the
[2:05:31] the smile that he gave was this press
[2:05:35] the battle keep going it's all worth
[2:05:41] it church I tell you that this morning
[2:05:44] press the battle going it'll be worth it
[2:05:47] at the end as you stand to your
[2:05:50] feet rapor
[2:05:53] Indiana indana that's where the Prophet
[2:05:55] was
[2:05:57] from and I tell you this day this is
[2:06:00] your
[2:06:01] opportunity don't say brother Caleb said
[2:06:04] this 40 days don't say that I'm saying
[2:06:06] that the heavens are declaring
[2:06:08] that it's a parable it may be more it
[2:06:12] may be less a parable that's what you
[2:06:15] have to find out don't wait too long
[2:06:19] church if you have to make something
[2:06:22] right make it
[2:06:23] right with your husband or with your
[2:06:26] wife or with your children or
[2:06:29] whatever bow your
[2:06:31] heads it's today that we say get a hold
[2:06:34] of the horns of the
[2:06:37] altar if there's somebody that says
[2:06:40] brother I need help pray I to get a hold
[2:06:43] of
[2:06:44] it this moment is for
[2:06:47] you if you're doing okay then pray for
[2:06:50] others
[2:06:52] but this is an
[2:06:58] opportunity were brother I've done I
[2:07:01] think I'm living
[2:07:03] okay it's not about living
[2:07:06] okay beyond
[2:07:09] that it's about
[2:07:11] knowing who you
[2:07:13] are it's about knowing that you're part
[2:07:16] of the
[2:07:17] parable because when true repentance
[2:07:20] happens
[2:07:22] those sins are blotted
[2:07:25] out I'm going to say it
[2:07:28] again those things that are forgiven
[2:07:32] you are not part of the
[2:07:36] parable because what's placed into the
[2:07:38] sea of
[2:07:41] forgetfulness God doesn't remember that
[2:07:43] no
[2:07:44] more it's not part of his
[2:07:50] parable so I say Church make
[2:07:56] sure Parable doesn't mean it's going to
[2:07:59] be this or
[2:08:00] that it may be more less it it'll happen
[2:08:03] on
[2:08:05] Earth but it's already shown in the
[2:08:08] heaven that if today you hear his
[2:08:14] voice don't Harden your
[2:08:20] heart
[2:08:25] Lord we come before you as a
[2:08:27] congregation
[2:08:31] Lord yet Lord as individuals too
[2:08:36] Lord Lord not wanting to send away our
[2:08:39] day of
[2:08:42] Grace but the heavens have already
[2:08:44] declared it
[2:08:46] Lord and they will declare it
[2:08:49] Lord but Lord now is the time of
[2:08:53] repentance Lord that's what Jonah went
[2:08:55] and
[2:08:56] preached repent or
[2:08:59] perish and so Lord I come before you
[2:09:02] with all these people that have

[2:09:43] chains be broken this morning may every
[2:09:46] one of them Lord walk out of this
[2:09:49] building Lord a free person
[2:09:53] knowing that they're part of the parable
