father almighty God we come before you Lord grateful to you Lord for placing the different man lord it's not us as men that do this is your holy spirit that does the placing Lord is we did not choose

[Applause] and of course all these are all our associate ministers Associated together we we want to fulfill what God has called us to do because we have a responsibility amen amen so we are grateful this morning would you stand to your feet and uh we we bring this morning we bring uh greetings we we were able to be there on Friday night with with brother Israel Poe and his Services he sends his greetings able to hear a wonderful message brother Paul Dirksen Mr monopod Dirksen preaching on the false and the true Unity everyone everyone in the message should hear that message and if you can find it on there it's under Shalom Tabernacle I don't know if they have it online or not but it really puts a lot of things in perspective uh all these divisions that we find everywhere but my goodness it does not leave any wiggle room for anyone and so we bring greetings from like as I said from Brother Paul the manamos instrumentopo we had on Thursday we had dinner with brother Evans lunch with brother Jerome on Friday they all send their greetings and it was a good fruitful trip [Music] Amen brother Titus also called last night and we're we he sends his greetings and we we pray for we ask that you would pray for us as as next Sunday will be in Denver in Denver reaching for for brother Cabello amen will you pray for us amen so let's get into the word now water 20 worth 20 till alrighty Genesis the first chapter and he says and we will be we will be um put a subtitle to this and I don't know if I'm going to get to it or not because there's a lot here where do you stand number seven the god of the earth and so we'll see how far we go if not I'll pick it up when I next time I come back and we'll finish this off but our Focus today is on responsibility Genesis 1 28 says and God bless them and and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth is what a tremendous thing we find here this is responsibility is responsibility you know sometimes we want to have titles sometimes we want to be this or that you want to be noticed we want this but when it's all said and done he was to have dominion over the fish of the sea over the style of the air every living thing that moveth upon the Earth what a responsibility was laid on his shoulders His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated we have a responsibility that has been laid on our laps especially for Africa especially and uh I want to show you something this is Africa is just part of our responsibility so that's not all our responsibility Africa as parties but I wanna I wanna show you something um that as we were in in the old city of Jerusalem you know there are times that the Lord shows us things and uh and it really blessed my heart we were walking down the the uh we were walking down the the Via Dolorosa estamos everybody knows what that is right see your hands if you know remember the way of suffering it's the way where he carried the cross to going going to Calvary and going down that road uh there was a place that we saw a sign here and it said the pool of Bethesda um and as we entered into this place we came across this this picture that was hanging at the entrance I don't believe did you get that picture gentlemen a photo yes and uh we came across this picture you uh that was hanging and the entrance to that pool and as I looked at it and it says serving the church in 21 African countries I looked at that and I was like wow Lord I I I feel you talking to to me I'm aware that the Perez blancs is a Roman Catholic society that does missionary work in Africa but it stood out to me because it was not just a plaque of their work but it was a picture of our responsibility and I don't know you maybe can't see it but but two of the countries is is Uganda and and Ghana those little spaces is Uganda igana the Holy Spirit began to move there as I looked at it and I saw our responsibility as a family as a church posted on the walls of Old Jerusalem west side and last loss off of a street called you know it has been a Via Dolorosa a way of suffering but I want to tell you this morning we will not shirk our responsibilities because there are people that are depending on us I I don't know if you understand that but I'm going to say it again there are people that are depending on us and so so I I want to play this and it's it's about 15 minutes long you know but I want to even get the lights I want to play this this update on the video of Africa videos I believe it'll bless you okay [Music] your predictions [Music] you don't get right until we learn how to forget yes Hallelujah but the only way to really forget perfect love will be there Hallelujah we want to take this opportunity to thank God who has provided us with food and we thank also our brothers brother Carrigan the church providing us helping us especially in this time where we are suffering with famine as well as Ebola rockdown thank you Brothers may God bless you amen thank you Jesus thank you Jesus Sharon reverence of Cedar his church of the Cross special greetings our dear pastor Pastor calim today I want to uh to send our appreciation for the opportunity support towards the work we are doing by God's grace and we thank you for always standing with us and supporting us to see that we can have the spiritual food for both these people in Uganda today we are done with the book and we are packing a book entitled uh God is power to transform as translated in our local language once you appreciate each other everyone Pastor Karen God greet you bless you to the members of today's Church of the course God richly bless you to everyone that is uh for the love for the care and for the support we love you all now in the universe Jesus Christ I'm Brother Joseph uh his brother David along uh and brother camera we say shalom we love you God bless God bless your Saints I'm here with Pastor Matthias and we are so blessed that we are going to share the testimony showing that the Lord we saw the Lord Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever uh one of our friends is Pastor Solomon he got actually the accident I think it's not now about it man a goal and the track ran over his leg it crushed it so terribly and she was rushed to hospital days passed by at first they thought they could do something but when uh brother Matthias went back now it's about two weeks uh he they he found when they had opened the leg and it was in a terrible state if you look at the pictures it was terrible he shared the pictures with uh Pastor Caleb and this was the reply the pictures were so scary if you look at them and the reply that Pastor sent him he forwarded it to me if I can remember it he said the ministry is praying we are believing with you all God is still a Healer and still doing miracles when I read that reply I I really something struck my heart and I said amen well just shortly after I talked to a pastor and where the Matthias according to the hospital the doctors that told him they had to amputate the leg so we talked and they needed them some money in the hospital to do that and after talking to a pastor said well yes let that money that is coming in do the work real quick so uh but Tommy had sent the man about two days back and I told him yes I'm expecting the money anytime and immediately I get it I'll send it to brother Matthias and they'll amputated the leg so and then somehow he talked back to brother Matthias he sent him a message and he said is that money to help the leg you know to be amputated or took out of the leg then when he forwarded that message back to me I said wow it seems real God doesn't want the brother's leg this is what I thought really in my heart I said why has Pastor asked this maybe God doesn't want the brothers elect to be amputated but you know these were just thoughts coming in like that well but we all thought since the doctors have said they have to do that that's what they had to do so uh well I I kept on waiting for the money that was second day then the third day I waited for the money it didn't come through and at this time you know we were like we want the money to come through very fast like that we were all Imagining the pain that brother someone was going through but surprisingly the managing to go through the Saturday first day see if they they managing to go through I kept talking to uh buddy told me and he kept talking back to me and we were like he checked in The Source Bank everything was fine I could keep asking the bank here they could say we don't see the money in the system I was like what what's going on look at the brother to you know to be helped quickly then we kept on just praying but in all this uh I thank God because when Pastor talked to me sending a voice note I could see the meekness in him and the settlings that peace in his heart so it touched me like wow let's just keep praying God knows so we kept praying we kept preparing and then uh the money didn't go through sixth day the money didn't go through friends I like we could keep Imagining the pain and then money is not going through all the days after the Eighth Day that's when I could receive the money almost when all of Hope Has Gone money came through oh thank you a lot I sent the money straight to brother Matthias and brother Matthias goes to the hospital and what happened again when brother Julia sent me the money I rushed to the hospital to see Brothers when I reached there to your time another new doctor comes in he didn't come for brothers he just came to pass around but when he's God [Applause] and imagine so the the brothers so the the doctors they said they are not going to amputate to the leg so we sent he sent back the message to brother to pastor and then surprisingly we looked at it we looked at everything and oh god look here money did not go through for all these eight days because it is the real I want this really to go down into our hearts for the real fast time ever since for all the years that body Tony has been sending the money through the account never not even one time has the money ever delayed it was the first time ever the money to be delayed for 80 Days why the ministry is praying we are all believing with you God is still a Healer and still doing Miracles we believe that changed everything it changed the system in the bank that it couldn't see the money for eight days because God was waiting for the right doctor to come on that day and that's when God wanted the money to come through who do you say this is oh God had better plans for brother Solomon that he kept the system of the bank and want to see the money for all those days How great is our God thank you for the prayers as they call him we thank God for you know the way he walks through the ministry we thank God for revealing himself in our time continuously we thank God for your prayers it was because of those prayers that God has saved Brother songs like God is namely prayed forever and all the glory and honor goes back to our Lord Jesus Christ we thank him so much for revealing himself once again in our time God richly bless your Saints if you think things are not going right in the right direction God is in everything God richly bless you one of the pastors who has to hold himself ready to be taken to prison for not being able to pay the school in church rent this is from the pastor's wife praise the Lord or Pastor I am the wife to the pastor I am Juliet we're so grateful and thankful to God for the love he put in you and the end time message I with my children send our sincere appreciation towards the rescue of my husband I know and believe if it was not for the love of God in you my husband was to end his life in prison it's a joke [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] and put me back together now every desire is now satisfied hearing your love oh there's nothing better than you there's nothing better than you Lord there's nothing nothing is [Music] no I'm not afraid [Music] your mercy and Grace [Music] [Music] [Applause] and he is worthy of our praises and our adoration amen I pray that it blessed you this this morning now I got a question to ask you hello should I use that as part of the time of my message we'll see what the Lord has to say what a thing it is responsibility responsibility God bless them the voice of God to us the Commandments the commission that was left to us is our responsibility is I want to show you what the word responsibility is I don't think I'm gonna get to the God of this Earth so so if if I don't get there then just change the subtitle to responsibility there you go the state of being answerable accountable for something within one's power that troll or management it's the reason that many don't have a or do not like responsibility nowadays because they do not want to give an account for what they do and and their actions but responsibility once again is the state of being answerable accountable for something within one's power this is why brother Branham says that that power without character is satanic because character is what pushes you to be accountable because there's no accountability people think that real you know yes or yes so you'll see I'm going to say it again people think that real power they can do whatever they want they don't have to give an account for anything but let me tell you this this fine morning that's what responsibility does that makes you accountable for everything you say everything you think everything that you do our ability stability and responsibility irresponsibility it grows when we increase our sense of accountability to God man had a responsibility to God but he also had a response possibility to the Earth they had a responsibility to the fish of the sea responsibility he had a responsibility to the fowl of the air responsibility and to everything that was moving upon the Earth and his responsibility continued to grow so responsibility as God of the Earth the atom was God of the Earth let me see your hands if you really know it he was God of the earth there is nothing as destructive as irresponsibility I want you to repeat that can you just tell your neighbor neighbor there is nothing as destructive as irresponsibility and the word irresponsibility is just the opposite right responsibility not capable or qualified for responsibilities it is not answerable or accountable to a higher authority irresponsibility irresponsibility is unable to respond to conscience no one nowadays wants to take responsibility for their actions we always love to transfer our inexcusable Behavior to everyone and anyone that is around us my question is where do you stand and this morning we as human beings you've never seen a day like today where the blame game is played more than any other time it's amazing how much we want to blame someone else for our for our actions and and and the consequences we endure you see people I'm gonna change Banks they repossessed my house or my car like it's the bank's fault that you didn't pay the bill you know is that right we always want to transfer the blame somewhere they turned my electricity off oh man they're so mean why did you go shopping when you knew you had a bill to pay we blame the preacher for our condition but I'm going to tell you this morning quit trying to blame the preacher yes we come to the altar to get prayed foreign for prayer because our spirit is all messed up we cannot sleep at night we don't have peace we have headaches instead of praying for people I think a lot of times we should just be straight up and ask the questions who are you talking bad about is that right because everybody wants just a quick fix all the time would you speak evil what bad thoughts overtook you this week go make those things right and you'll feel much better we're used to playing the blame game we are the people that are responsible for a lot because much has been given us I'm going to say it again much has been given to us how many of you have your Bible here today let me see that let me hold it up if you got your Bible this is your book or someone else's book is this is my book it's me Libro but by taking possession of this book you have now taken on the greatest responsibility known to man responsibility let me see how many of you still steal your book but if this is your book yes you're responsible what for what is in this Pages hello everybody hola I'm going to say it again how many of you is this your book and you're responsible once again or what is in this book for the responsibility as a Believer is to live this word to make this word do what it says it will do this is your responsibility to make it alive in your generation sounds a huge response ability that we have responsibility how many have taken the message of the hour personal to you then you are responsible for that message Genesis chapter 2 and verse 16 says and the Lord God commanded the man there's the Commandment this is a responsibility saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eat is thereof Thou shalt surely die Adam knew that his responsibility was to the father's Commandments and then God did something for Adam that brought on a whole new responsibility verse 22 and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made here woman is for the first time man had a responsibility to take care of his books I'm building up to this now so that you understand he was the god of the Earth but there were things that were continuing to come forth his responsibility began to grow but it wasn't long before Satan threw the serpent got to his wife and then through her God to him God had put him in the garden and now God was taking him out of the garden and there's a lot of people nowadays being put out of what they were one is put into it come on now I I I I I gotta say that one more time he said but God placed me here but by your responsibility how important it is that we understand these things have you ever thought of all the many things that God has not given us because we are not responsible enough to handle them how many things that God desires to give us but we are not responsible enough responsibles brother Ram says in a man running from the presence of the Lord when Adam was in the Garden of Eden when he come to the responsibility to make his choice would he stay with God or go with his wife the responsibility was up to him he either had to take what his wife said or what God Said and when he chose to go the way of his wife then he lost his original conditional irresponsibility the responsibility does as I said produces blame and once again the blame game continued to blame the wife or the woman the woman blamed the serpenter and after the fall then was to come A different kind of responsibility a covenant for the man his responsibility to responsibility that person is the ground for thy sake and by the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat foreign but through it all now listen closely but through it all they also have the responsibility of raising the product of their irresponsibility oh church I want you to get this because this this is where we live today we know what we're responsible foreign the product of irresponsibility wears people down today it is building with a product that was produced by being irresponsible I deal with it all the time brother my marriage you chose him you chose her my children you chose not to apply the token is and now we're saying I need help the help was giveness you're uncomfortable no no I comforted it's the biggest hindrance of of why we are not responsible in many things because it's uncomfortable that's why we don't we don't many times tell others about the Lord because we got a little uncomfortable well my my finances brother you choose to live outside of your means and every time we are irresponsible every time we choose to disbelieve God's word yes every time we think that we are not accountable to anyone the product is come on church I'm going to say it again a product is birth and then you'll live the rest of your lives because you never plucked It Up by The Roots you'll live the rest of your life pruning branches off of that bush hello everybody hola pruning the same Bush all the time Bush should have been plucked up by the roof I know the uh anybody here same problem over and over again a month later get rid of the bush mismo hello everyone hola why people are okay for a little while gain the product of our irresponsibility and then another responsibility responsibility the brother hit is so good on when we were when we were in Tucson estamos in Tucson another responsibility arrives the responsibility the responsibility of Brotherhood yeah amen I want to let that one sink in for a little bit how many of you know that in in Genesis chapter 4 in Genesis Capital cuatro one through eleven story of Cain and Abel you all know that if you know that how many times the word brother is used there is it is used seven times not by coincidence think about that for a moment the broader Brotherhood is that important to God seven times it's used then it's a decision take on the responsibility responsibility taking care of your brothers it's a responsibility oh we're going to get to something here in a moment can you answer the question where is your brother Su Hermano in the middle there's seven in Medio I see a three three and in the middle dress yes when God asks the question where is your brother when I look at this on the Middle East we gotta know how to answer this question the only way to answer it you got to know first of all where you're standing and then you can know where your brother is standing the word standing means we've been talking about where do you stand the world standing is your s your status you're positioned if we're going to go through the process of being restored back to our position shouldn't we be taking a hold of our responsibilities right now you know yeah we can be very good and very responsible in some areas But as God of the earth Adam didn't have wasn't able to choose what he wanted to be responsible about is that right he couldn't pick and choose and say well I'll be responsible for the fish but not the not the fouls he knew where he was standing and everything God wants us to do comes our responsibility if you feel a responsibility towards people responsibility do you ever notice sometimes you feel a responsibility only towards certain people uh okay let me stop here for a minute right let me see how many of you are response still a responsibility towards people put our responsibility towards all people oh yeah I better change my message what do you think keep going okay why don't do not we feel a responsibility for all people Alma what's wrong somewhere something's wrong if I can't see someone out there and and my heart go out to them something's wrong something's wrong with me I don't have to look at anyone else there's a responsibility that has been laid Upon Our shoulders when I see this the real question is not how if we feel a responsibility or not the real question is how much responsibility are we willing to take responsibility well I did that last month so I'm going to take a break this month it's easy to do that when your bellies are full when everything is going good it's easy to take a little break right when somebody's dying and they're they're they're waiting they're what they're needing something and they're relying on us how can we take a break think about these things the Internet it's a sacrifice to take on more responsibility the question is how many of you are willing to take on more responsibility people are relying on you they're relying on us every prophet and every Sage the Apostle every Minister every person has had to face up to the responsibility of why they were sent to their age their day and their hours and we also have to come to the conclusion of our responsibility why were we sent to this day at this age what's the purpose I have a lot of businesses and then have a good job there's some nice things here in this earth the extent of our responsibility sometimes I I was I was hearing I was hearing our pastor the other day and he says how many of you are going with me to Colorado and hardly nobody raised their hands he said are you serious all that God has done now you don't want to go we got better cars better houses foreign every man that come on the face of the Earth has to answer to God for our responsibility and to many of us stewardship yeah we have to answer for it this responsibility is the responsibility is a stewardship that's been committed to us by God he says I don't care what it is we have a responsibility and we'll answer to God for the stewardship of our responsibility we recorded a four-part series uh week ago and uh I I I believe that it would be a wonderful thing for all of you to hear okay why we don't believe in just listening to tapes we are not against anyone that does that understand our heart is but there is a responsibility that the message gives us we must listen to the tapes that's our source but the source needs a channel to flow through if we have the source but no channels what is the source La Fuente it's not to attack anyone that does that is the purpose of doing these things but our purpose is this is that in the message through the scriptures responsibility has been placed the responsibility on our laps the question is how much responsibility are we willing to take responsibility yes sir it's much easier not to preach yes see Hello everybody hola much easier not to have to stay away from your family for hours and hours so much easier spend hours upon hours but I want to tell you this is Brother Brown says this is hard to say this is difficult but it's true that ministers many times they shirk a responsibility evidence for standing for the true word of God confronted with it they'll shirk that responsibility when the truth of the word of God is brought face to face with us human beings we are prone to shirt back estamos this uh you'll answer and I will too for what we say and what we don't say it's easy to dodge our responsibilities but we cannot Dodge the consequences of dodging our responsibilities we are responsible for this church Iglesia not I am responsible I am responsible but it doesn't lay on just the pastor to be responsible we all are responsible for this church foreign this is our responsibility to God and I want I want this to hit home because a church is made up of offices he says these offices are your responsibility to God responsibility I'm going to preach a different message today come on now we have a responsibility we're going to answer to God foreign they are your responsibility to God I'm saying it here tonight because it's my responsibility to God and then he says it's your responsibility foreign why did you stop preaching because somebody said I shouldn't preach anymore how much is that going to hold anyway responsibility is not to man in that sense it's to the commission it's true what he called us to do he sent us in this age we are way too comfortable this morning come on now let him Shake us a little bit amen because everything else is so much more important we shirk our responsibility to fill these offices where then is the problem brother Brian says being brought into the presence of God when God made a promise God is obligated to that promise and when he brings that promise to pass then people are afraid to face up to the responsibility of coping with the message of the hour to the responsibility of coping with the message of the hours are you coping with the message of the hours that's a question and I want to know how we're going to answer that question is to deal effectively is are we dealing effectively with the message of the hours we're afraid to take on the responsibility responsibility think about it because when we look at those videos how is it possible that so many things God has done there imagine Moses when he left the when he left Egypt with the children of Israel Pueblo the responsibility of two million responsibility how was he going to feed them elementar come on now vamos the problem is that we're afraid because we can't figure out how we're gonna do something God never asked you if you if or how you're gonna do it and take it I'm willing send me this question I don't know how I'm gonna buy my ticket I don't know how I'm gonna pay for this or that Lord I'm gonna go at your word feed 2 million how many clothes will they wear out where will they get the clothes where will I feed them I've come to them as a leader how will I be able to do it and maybe even in our homes we ask I don't know how we're going to do this you think it didn't go through my mind how we're going to feed all these brothers and sisters in Uganda I will take care of so many people both physically and spiritually yes I am a human being the question Lord how yeah but God isn't isn't interested in our questions of how we're going to do it because it's not us doing it to begin with Moses then rested upon this well it says that's how we do it we do as Moses did we rest upon this says God said surely I'll be with you and he went a step farther with you and I when it's all said and done all we do is make messes but when it's him in us he is in control he said that's all I need is rested upon the comfort of God's promise when we are so worried about everything else little do we know that his promises are better than 10 it's Tempur-Pedic Cloud this this gun says oh why didn't I rest on yes it's a good place to rest on the Promises he said he rested he took comfort in God's promise this is up to Moses to see how they would be fed no depends how are you going to do it Lord none of your business he just said he would do it what's the problem that's right I amen where's brother Justin Mr Justin what happened the other night with your little baby respiration says foreign [Applause] well what happens is that's all you maybe can't can't hear but those of you online but she lost her post it's done in linear [Music] what are we doing we're resting what happened brother Felipe to your little boy Nino rashes all over his arms Dr Victoria oh it wants to come back we don't care and we're resting on it resting on his promises he knows how to do it who else brother Abe wait umido respiratory the numbers okay that was in one week they are trying to take the life of people here who in whom we have believed that's why we have a responsibility because this word is this word is the greatest thing that has ever hit planet Earth and he loves his children I'll be with you even in you why are we worried so many questions we're afraid that's why we asked the questions We're Not Afraid no more and we're resting questions why Lord why no I don't I don't ask the questions that's why we we take on more of a responsibility we're not depending on ourselves that was so 20 30 years ago we are depending on him this morning we have a responsibility I love the Lord I don't know about you no no said you said should I stop and stop it just just for a few more moments more I haven't even gotten to the nitty-gritty all right brother Jim he's awesome we got so many things that we have to do so much responsibility that we have to face everybody has got to face a certain responsibility when you all choose a wife you choose your husband young young ladies foreign do you realize that the responsibility brother Ram says of this city Tempe uh I'm gonna put do you realize that's the responsibility of this city of Las Cruces I believe he says is resting upon your soul is I get a little uncomfortable man it's hot in here put these things on my train of thought it's resting upon your shoulders I believe that God has made each one of us lighthouses [Music] watch what he says you have the responsibility of the sins of this city the Los pecados my goodness oh yeah we could go home and chew on that for a while it's resting upon ministers and upon the church people is that you're going to get out from London minister they better start doing their job you better start doing your job pilgrims as we're journeying through Los peregrinos he said don't forget people think it's easy oh Pastor just sit back and collect the time oh no no no it's the duty of we as pastors because God Almighty will require your blood our hands at the day of judgment that's not an easy responsibility it's a great tremendous responsibility and God has given us people who love us to hear us and we should spend our time constantly watching for your souls sometimes people are walking on clouds oh everything is wonderful event speed aren't even touching the ground get a little responsibility it'll put you down amen amen oh yeah oh yeah we don't want to be ministers by title though we want to be ministered by responsibility that we have taken on the invisible Union of the Bride now what a sacred trust ability to a woman she's a type of the church which has the same responsibility as a woman as sacred responsibility to her motherhood to her virtues to her husband we do this as the church has a sacred responsibility prayer to Christ a crystal just the same as the woman don't you see that we all have a responsibility not just as pastors ministers on all of us as we honor God we honor him because we take responsibility why we know we got to know where we are standing God will never bless a Believer outside their position just like he will not bless Israel outside of their Homeland Israel man lost his position being irresponsible don't lose what you have because you're irresponsible the man had a position with God but forfeited he forfeited the right to save his wife and in doing so he lost his position what was his position he was the god of the earth he lost that by being irresponsible for said irresponsible he had all creation at his feet he lost it he forfeited brother Branham says imagine the responsibility what he would have to answer foreign for being the god of the earth we struggle with the responsibility of running our homes hello everybody hola well my wife said she would leave me I heard this or that you know wow what a thing because it happens I see pasta so the man stays there and can never grow anymore because he found another God man is responsible to God for becoming what God has made possible for him to become but all sin has to do is make you irresponsible towards your commission your position your office to doubt it one bit each fire what a struggle it is when God made man he was a god of the Earth the man was El hombre uh god of the Earth I don't know if I should get into this because this would take me a little while we won't have service tonight just real lightly but but just but just come with me for a little bit because it might go against a little bit of what we know he lost also his inheritance when he lost his fellowship and right the day you eat of it the day you die when he lost his life he also lost his inheritance in life because he had complete control Supreme control of the earth he was a god of the earth he is the god of God is the god of the universe everywhere but his son have this Earth under his own control now we should first of all look in the mirror and say but before I look at this do I have this this Earth under control we should have it under control by now but we have wandering eyes sometimes come on now bye I'm gonna get to something good right now once again here we are his son have this Earth under his own control he could speak he could name he could stop nature let's do anything he wanted to yes but when he did that he lost his inheritance now Satan wanted to be God of this Earth is that right but that position that title belonged to Adam Long and not just to Adam to every son that was to come and when Adam forfeited it was ready we know this he was ready to take that title deed book of redemption slip right out of his hands back to the original owner because Satan could not feel is for the Earth was made for man and not man for the Earth but I want you to notice this now goodness gracious oh yeah I want you to get this now Paul never calls Satan let's see what he calls him second Corinthians 4 4. in whom the God of this world he names them the God of this world blinded the minds of them which believe not incredible once again he never calls him God of the Earth but God of this world produces brother Branham clarifies he is the God of this evil age he has set up shop but he is a squatter and three times trespasses the Apostle John Juan records what Jesus referred to Satan as he always referred to him as the ruler of this world we are in the world the most age and once again man lost his position he was the god of the Earth but praise be to God when the lamb went forth and took that title deep book of redemption the price was paid when Christ died at Calvary but it had not been claimed yet till this end times listen to what the prophet of God says I love this yes a redeemed man he is the seventh angel messenger there was a Heavenly messenger but there's also an Earthly message he receives the book receiver Libro and John a type of the Bride eats it in the Book of Revelation office along with its title god of the earth now been restored back to man since the time that Adam forfeited the title god of the Earth was lost to man until after Revelations chapter 10. say it again there comes Revelations says here immediately after Revelations 10. and I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred three score days clothed in sackcloth foreign I want to know this this morning because it is about most important have you ever stood before the god of the Earth hello everybody I'm gonna say it again have you ever stood before the god of the earth here we find two prophets standing before the god of the earth two olive trees two candlesticks oh come on now almost what are these two candlesticks they're the prophet it says it's the prophet the prophets keep reading though there's truth in what you're saying open it up a little bit more Church you gotta see it's a picture unfolding you'll see that one in fine linen he was a man watch what he is god of the Earth when the whole church comes together not a god of the earth anymore the body of Christ come together let's see what he says here oh I wish I had this I don't know if I brought it or not but I gotta say it anyways watch these two revelation of Jesus Christ Elijah for the fourth time returns back in the spirit so they'll come back and run and be killed in the spiritual street called Sodom is the Lord was crucified Jerusalem preaching to the Jews but watch what he says end of the Gentile Ministries will carry over and connect with that connect come on now this is the overlap now stop dealing with the Gentiles and then start with the Jews that's right and in the overlap period transfer is made we heard this by our founding Pastor on that panel on Wednesdays notice this how important it is he says we'll go with them I don't know he said this Gentile Ministry I know there will be the seven Messengers there this is just for a moment but it's a transferring oh I love the way our founding Pastor said it's the same as Jacob that right before antis right before he meets Esau the Catholic Church an angel comes to him who's this jacob this Israel how is he wrestling with his Prophet because he's asking him questions then he's saying what's about this this atonement let me explain a little bit but then the sun is about to rise these two witnesses standing in other words they have come back to their positions back to their place as prophets of Israel standing before the capital G but a lot of the his body his mystical body is there foreign it is wait here watch now let me wrong I know there's there's a one man that is showing this that's typing all this is I'm going to be finished where is this big fellow this is in the sardisian church age he's in Christo because after all this world was not given for God to control let's notice that right who is the god of the earth who is the god of the earth he says [Music] just any man no he says who is this man can be plural plural but when we come together it's just Christ who is this God of the Earth on that his domain is all everything in the earth subject to the mass redeeming power he comes back again as the Earth belongs to me given to him he was ruler over everything oh you condemn me when I say I'm the son of God what kind of responsibility should how much more responsibility notice what he says notice what he says the god of the Earth but who else is this great Fountain of seven colors yes seven Messengers seven eyes in the Lambs they're coming together now that was God now that was not all God that was God seven horns seven churches he protected his rights on Earth there will be a group I'm going to say it again that's why you believe it however God bless you I'm not against no we don't need to go to Palestine oh hold on oh we'll go I don't know don't ask me that question but there will be a delegation but uh [Music] and give it back Studios who it is may God bless each one of you forgive me for the enemy we have such a responsibility in his time he makes all things beautiful in his time now I ask you though I'm sorry for yelling too much I just get excited just something in me that gotta make it home but you understand where we're at today extend the responsibility Church to our children to Las Cruces to our brothers don't play around no more no no no juege don't play around no more yeah we have
