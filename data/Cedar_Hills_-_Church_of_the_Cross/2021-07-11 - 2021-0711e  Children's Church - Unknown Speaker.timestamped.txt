[23:45] hope everybody's doing well this
[23:47] afternoon first of all i would like to
[23:50] thank the lord for giving me
[23:51] my life and for the pastor of letting me
[23:55] of him having the confidence so i can
[23:56] preach
[23:58] now how many enjoyed the service this
[24:02] morning
[24:08] well i was at sunday school but i've
[24:10] heard about it and i'm pretty sure
[24:12] everybody was blessed
[24:15] you can please turn your bibles open
[24:17] your bibles to luke
[24:19] 8 5.
[24:38] a sower went out to sow his seed and
[24:41] as he sowed some fell upon his wayside
[24:45] and it treaded down the fowls of the air
[24:48] and devoured it some fell upon a rock
[24:51] and as soon as it sprung up it
[24:53] withered away because it lacked moisture
[24:56] and some fell among thorns and the
[24:57] thorns sprang up with it and choked it
[25:00] and others fell on the good ground and
[25:02] sprang up
[25:04] and bare fruits and hundreds full
[25:07] and when he said these things he cried
[25:09] he that has
[25:10] ears let them hear we're gonna jump to
[25:14] number 11. now the parable is
[25:17] the seed is the word of god
[25:20] you may be seated
[25:25] now this afternoon i would like to talk
[25:28] about
[25:29] the sea and the title of my message is
[25:32] the seed that got planted in my heart
[25:35] now i'm sure you guys have heard many
[25:37] stories about seeds
[25:39] like jack and the beanstalk the good and
[25:41] the bad seed
[25:42] even the bible talks about the seed
[25:44] called the mustard seed
[25:46] which is the smallest seeds of them all
[25:51] now this seed is so powerful that it has
[25:53] everything you need
[25:57] but before i tell you that let me tell
[25:59] you a little something that happened to
[26:01] me
[26:01] one day i planted a seed of a plum tree
[26:06] i dug a hole
[26:10] the seed in butter in it and water it
[26:13] and i waited and guess what was
[26:15] happening nothing
[26:17] i waited months and months and months
[26:19] and guess what was happening
[26:21] nothing until one day i was playing my
[26:24] backyard
[26:25] and this itty-bitty bitty green stem pop
[26:28] out from the ground
[26:30] and i said oh what a funny-looking weed
[26:33] until that funny-looking weed
[26:35] soon started to grow branches and leaves
[26:39] and fruits
[26:40] until one and and i thank god for my
[26:43] mother
[26:44] that watered it because i only watered
[26:46] it once
[26:48] but i was expecting big fruits and i
[26:50] stayed without taking care of that
[26:52] seed
[26:55] now that we know that this seed is the
[26:57] word of god
[26:58] what are we going to do with it shall we
[27:00] receive it and throw it away
[27:04] sure should we plant it and never water
[27:07] it
[27:08] or should we treasure it in our hearts
[27:10] and take good care of it
[27:13] i think that the last option is the best
[27:17] because again brother brown said
[27:19] that it is equipped with everything you
[27:21] need
[27:22] for example are you having a bad day at
[27:25] school
[27:26] what does the seed say
[27:29] i can do all things in christ that
[27:31] strengthens me
[27:33] are you sick what does a seat say
[27:36] by his stripes we are healed
[27:39] are you feeling lonely what does the
[27:42] seat say
[27:43] fear not where i am with you don't be
[27:45] dismayed for i
[27:46] am your god
[27:50] how could we let this beautiful seed die
[27:53] if we don't water it of course it'll die
[27:57] but how can we water it but i thank god
[28:00] for the prophet of
[28:02] this eighth that he left instructions on
[28:05] us
[28:05] of how to take care of god
[28:09] now let's see what brother branham says
[28:12] in the message
[28:13] god revealing himself to the people
[28:16] he says the word is a seed
[28:19] that the sower sowed in the ground and
[28:22] every seed will bring forth its own kind
[28:25] if you need a salvation the seeds here
[28:28] if you need healing
[28:29] use the seed of the word and the word of
[28:31] god is a seed
[28:33] put it in your heart don't dig it up
[28:34] every morning and see if it's sprouted
[28:37] put it there and leave it because it's
[28:39] god's business to bring forth the
[28:41] harvest
[28:42] you just leave it there water by faith
[28:44] and praise god every day thanking god
[28:46] for it
[28:47] now don't only water it once a week
[28:51] when we come to church let's water it
[28:53] every day to see how big it'll grow
[28:57] it's a play it's okay to play video
[28:59] games or watch tv or do your favorite
[29:01] activity
[29:02] but we can find that time during the day
[29:05] where you can
[29:06] find where you can play where you can
[29:08] find yourself
[29:09] in prayer and read your bible and that's
[29:12] how the seed will grow to be at the
[29:14] perfect statue of the man
[29:16] god bless you
[29:38] hallelujah
[29:50] good to see you all once again how's
