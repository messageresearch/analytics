stomach I was having those issues that night but I thought well he's just saying the stomach he's not really saying anything about ovaries and just as I started to think that he mentioned about ovaries so I knew at that moment that I was healed and that God was going to heal me yes and so this month came around and I wasn't expecting any pain because I knew that God had healed me yes and

brother Jonathan John Henry and um let us uh let us go into prayer Lord we thank you Father Lord you are so so good to us Lord we're thankful for this time that we have gathered together foreign Lord we're thankful for these this opportunity as a panel gracias all these previous panels that have come before this what a tremendous blessing they have big enough and ask that you just be with each and every one of us amen amen we're gonna start uh with the scripture real quick before we are seated and it's in the Book of Matthew chapter 24 and verse six verses and it reads like this and ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that ye be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet is thank you brother Jerry's gonna start us off this evening amen God bless evening it was uh a struggle to to get this ready for me anyway because you get so much information and then you wanna I guess you could say myself I want to lay it out and say well should I do it this way should I do it that way for me so I had no I had no way I was going to go this morning yes as of this morning I had no way you know so I'm sitting down and I'm drinking coffee and it is about 8 30 this morning and it just seemed to fall in place so it's not me it's never been me but it's always been God amen amen and if we read a a scripture when you read Revelations 12 apocalypses and I'll start with verse 7. and it says there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels Miguel is and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world and he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him so if we read here it says there was a war in heaven so there's always a difference between a war and a battle right because War I guess if you could describe War now definition it's usually two groups or two Nations or two militaries going to battle one another you know you know sometimes you have one country trying to take over another country but of course within that war there are certain battles is that help you win the war is and I believe this is no different the the war started in heaven with Michael and his angels and the dragon and his angels but but if you if you if you read a little bit before that so it says the red dragon was cast out and he took a third of the angels with him you know so so right there we're we're we should be already outnumbered right you know because you know a lot of times as God children we feel like we're the minority so anyway they they fought and and and and and and when they were cast down where were they cast down too either cast down into Eden as brother Branham says so they they cast down there the the serpent the devil is angels Los Angeles and you can I guess you can kind of say one of the first battles maybe he they they they encountered was and and I I would say it's not so much a physical where they where they bought and and you know but he got into her mind he got into her mind and and and and and he said and throw us and he changed a couple of words or what a word and she believed it so right there that battle was lost that was a spiritual battle that that he fought but you know in in in in in and throughout the Bible there there are many battles you know and and I and I look at this and and and as myself we have our own battles within us also and me you know should I do this should I do this or he wants me to do this or he wants me to do that so so we we encounter many battles muchos and of course if you go through through the Bible in the Old Testament a lot of these battles were visible I mean people got killed blood was shared it said not just not just blood of the Saints Rashad also so so it was I mean it was a literal fight you know and and if you look through the Bible of course you you have you know one of the one of the main battles you speak of is David and goliaths yeah and you had all these big old Philistines and you had one little man he was outnumbered you know and and and within this battle he he was not afraid you know he said I'll I'll take him on I looked at him and he said man this is you know I'll I'll do with him whatever I want but that's why in a lot of these battles it seems like we're alone you know all the trials we go through it seems like we're alone but but God has always said I will be there and he told David he David said by the by by he believed in God he he knew as long as he stood behind God's word that was nothing Goliath was nothing Goliath couldn't touch him as long as he believed on God's word you know and and that's why I say we're gonna there's a lot of physical battles because it started in heaven it came down to earth so we're going to have there there was a lot of blood Ramada you know like like when when when the Battle of Jericho you know the the same thing you know God came and told them this is what you're gonna do if yours because in every battle there there there is somebody in charge and this one was in the Battle of Jericho was a captain of the lord of the hosts you know like like in in any military battle you got your generals who are usually in charge and they lay out a plan they say all right this is what this is how we're gonna attack this one is and this is how they're gonna this is how we're gonna attack over here well in this one he told him how he was going to do it he says this is how you're gonna how you're going to attack and take over in Jericho because you're going to go every day and you're gonna go around and then you're gonna do it and then when you come to the seventh day you're gonna go around but you're going to go around seven times and as you're going around you're going to be raising I guess worshiping out oh they were they were to be loud even a sir I said much and if you follow God's plan you see there's nothing the devil can't stand in front of you you know like I said there's many battles physical battles physicals but then we're also going to have our spiritual battles because there was war in heaven because it came down to earth so that doesn't make us exempt and told us no no no no no it's almost acceptable of course all these battles is going to lead to one final battle when I uh when uh there's going to be one final battle but but we also like I said we have a spiritual battle because in in in Ephesians 6 and official says 10 says yes finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might Hermanos Muse but on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil is not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual weakness in high places so we are going to have our spiritual battles in this in this war in heaven the battle was for it was jealousy right because because Lucifer wanted what Michael had Lucifer Lucifer one and he wanted he wanted he wanted it all he was so that's that's where the spiritual comes in sometimes now uh this is we we sometimes Maybe we see certain things that the world has versus because sin is beautiful right sin is beautiful yes it makes a pretty picture and that's where it comes in spiritually because because God chose the heart and devil chose the mind right because he went he attacked Eve's mind in the beginning but it all started over jealousy but if we stand on God's word if we if we stick to God's word then then nothing can can harm us now he paints a pretty picture and he says oh look how good this is look how good that is how good this is oh you're just by yourself oh it is but but realize you are not by yourself we don't stand alone in this world we don't stand alone in these battles we go through I don't stand alone in anything we do but as long as we have God's word in front of us God's word in front of us we can conquer anything because in this in this in a lot of these battles there's one thing that that you can that you read in there is that you're never alone they didn't fight it they actually literally fought it but there was somebody else because because if you look if you look at the the battle with Gideon and he started off with with 32 000. that's what he got 32 000. and the Lord told them that's too much yes they must he says you know you need to knock it down they say caramenos so he told him he told him whoever is afraid and doesn't want to fight this is so you do the math that leaves them with ten thousand yeah the Lord said that's still too much and he's okay so he tells them okay until he said okay this is uh whoever drinks water and there was the ones that were drinking the water and there were some that were just drinking it like crazy basically they got this bottle and they just drank it all at once that we're drinking water yeah they're watching out for what's coming here so after that there was only 300 left so you imagine as they get there there's 300 avian president and they look up and there's 150 000 that they have to go again those odds don't look very good yes but they stood on God's word on God's word and they believe that he would that he would be there fighting with them and fighting for them but then there were some battles that were lost right there were some battles were lost like when there was sin in the camp from the Avia picado in El Campo they lost that battle but then they had to go back and they had to clean out they had to search and they said why did we lose why wasn't the Lord with us and we got we ourselves we gotta we gotta check ourselves out you know we gotta check our house where is why can't I seem to get ahead they found the sin and they took it out I believe they they burned it right it was burned I think that's they burned it out and it's the same thing we got to get that sin in our lives and we got to burn it out we gotta stand on God's word because there's gonna be many battles there's going to be many fights muchas there's going to be many things but in these battles God is with us that's why in the Bible I believe it's 365 times there's a phrase that is used 360. Don't Be Afraid yes is that a coincidence that sits in there 365 days because he's telling you every single day don't be afraid well that's another message in itself but I I when I read that it caught me attention if we have him with us 365 days every single day yes we have nothing to be afraid of you have nothing to be afraid of us these battles are going to be great the ultimate and final battle is going to be great but this is preparing us for what's to come and we gotta stand on God's word we gotta put God first in our lives foreign to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God is transformados because also it says you got to be soberos of course you know when we say sober that you know a lot of people say oh well don't be drunk uh and then yeah that that's what it's used for yeah but it also can use to have your mind cleares have your mind focused and focalo because when when you're filled up with different other things or you're drunk on other things then you're not thinking clearly so you got to have a sober mind you got to have a clear mind um you know and here is what is God's plan for you yes amen amen that's that's what I have thank you amen thank you brother Jerry yeah we're doing battle up here with these brothers especially this brother here he did battle when we were younger but it's awesome to battle side by side I'm gonna ask a question and be honestos how many are afraid when you hear of Wars the war going on Ukraine right now when you hear of Wars does it scare you foreign man there's only two that are Joshua and Caleb are you one of them too man we got to believe that way right but what's scary about wars is your loved ones that are lost and when all this starts taking place they're not there that's what's scary so it's our duty to go out and get them right there's been several times in my life that I've had dreams and in these dreams you can just hear planes you know jets flying by aviones within yourself interested you know it it's it's on and you a couple times I've been in the house next thing I know I'm out I'm out in a in a field in pardes Campo and you look in the distance and you can see the armies coming you can see the enemy Elena and in several of my dreams I'm holding I'm holding a rifle is you know you're ready ready to fight but as they get closer and I turn away and look in the direction I'm heading the Lord says you gotta just get to that spot if you can reach that spot they can't touch you they can't harm you and in my dreams I always get there we get to that spot a couple times I even look around and there and there's no faces that I that I know people from inside the church but they're coming from different areas but we all meet in the same place and we talk and and hey we made it we made it yeah just just the little thing I wanted to share with you because we know it with with this subject Armageddon and Gog and magogi Magog like brother Jerry said we we battle daily you know there's events in life when we're born it's an event when you get married it's an event when you graduate from high school it's an event when some people get divorced personas it's an event why do people get divorcedentes brother Branham says in in the message invasion of the USA back in 1954 he says that the United States had the highest divorce rate in the whole world the prayer tasa you know and then he he goes on to say why because the United States they get out of Womanhood is uh husbands want a different partner Los esposos a wife wants a different partner so on and so forth yes but like I was saying every everything is an event I wake up in the morning and I'm Jolly Old I'm dolly always happy in a good mood but when I was a teenager stay away from me we don't like to get up early immediately you're in a battle in your mind Elijah it's time to get up you got to go to school more so when you're young and when you're older why would that be for cases is that adversary he's after you guys after us all right it's a battle we have a battle every morning when we wake up but there's a way out right our pastor is preaching on that on Sunday what do we battle with in our minds you can go from A to Z what we battle with us that are married he can't say the wrong thing at home because Armageddon will go on inside the house yeah yeah we gotta watch out huh that doesn't happen at my house though where's my wife at but something so simple as to the bed not being made simple things Julian Elizabeth that's never going to happen Julian Elizabeth we have you guys back so getting in with with this this goggin magogi Magog Brandon says know what this is Gog Gog is a Persona and Magog is a place a country and we know what's going on in the world right now just today alone I heard on the news that if the president there Putin if he he's he's he's struggling in that battle right now the Russian and if he decides to use nuclear weapons they're they're they want to go in there and assassinate him you know that's that's what you know the military the this is uh dude who do you all think the strongest military is the strongest military in the world it's there ready it's right there okay you say Russia what do you say Emma take a guess girls Ruby China okay we're both wrong the strongest military in the United States what no way as far as military the weapons the tanks Battleship uh the United States is the strongest when you think about it and say well how how are they gonna beat us you know how they're going to beat us because we're the ones we are the ones that are going to make this nation fall Nosotros we're bright right we will fall because of the things that go on foreign [Music] but he says Don't Fear Russia don't fear Russia clear ourselves we have to fear ourselves like in the times of Moses what happened when he came down just everything that was going on all the idols that were made we have Idols in our lives does anybody have an idol an idol can be anything from a car to money to you can go on and on so just quick real quickly just history on uh the president of Russia Presidente Russia he's he signed his own bill so how long does the president have in office how many terms depends on the country depends on the country well Putin signed in his own bill he signed off on it where he can be president for two more terms if elected president so he can be president until 2036. the president there he hates America he hates America holy America how did all these other countries gain all this knowledge on warfare spices again brother Branham says in the invasion of the USA it's from the United States we've gone down past presidents and and Military Chiefs and most possible presidents Secretary of Defense goes on and on continuously we gave them what we had they gained their knowledge from the United States and now they wanna use it against the United States but all this is going to take place that Henry will be bringing the Armageddon will go into more detail with Gog and Magog this happens at the end we always hear it's the end time it's the end time is it the end time right but will we be here for all this is we better not be here we better not be here when we have in battles in our minds fix them it's trust in the Lord sometimes you pray and you think he don't hear you we all do we're all human we think he doesn't hear us but he does hear us he does hear us if you have a sincere heart and you believe that he's there is it going to happen in five minutes no sometimes it takes it takes a while but just keep trusting and believing and those those battles in your mind they'll leave you they will leave you um I just have a couple more things here and then I'll switch over to to Will and particles how many have completed the whole stature of a perfect man perfect where are you at in that stature we have faith in the most faith we have virtue can you jump from one to the other well I'm back say no Isaac noise up girls can you jump your steps right that's our goal that's my goal statue of a perfect man perfect amen amen does God like to be worshiped God likes to be worshiped he loves to be worshiped he loves to be worshiped but a lot of times we can't even raise our hands because we're scared someone's watching us [Music] when I see the the African Brothers worship adorondo it's almost scary it's almost scary because you see them and damn bashful Benny where is where does God like to love to be worshiped the most you're saying church right you know he likes to be worshiped the most public and public you ever thought of that in public brother what does that means you ever walked through the store or singing a church song coming up no I would never do that huh you're a Hobby Lobby and sing Amazing Grace in public there's a man sometimes on Main Street you know the cream in his lungs are you guys he's preaching the word out there people are making fun of him I rolled my window down and I say God bless you brother amen but then I put myself in his shoes could I do that could we do that back in them Pentecostal days the the you know yes papa they would preach in the Parks and it's like little Jimmy I'll do it you don't care not important they used to do that and I would tell my dad are you crazy are you crazy you used to do that he showed me pictures of my grandpa and him preaching they almost had to do it said that are you crazy we're preaching what we knew but they weren't ashamed what a shame to do it but are we ashamed we can't be ashamed to testify or to preach his word it's important it's so important that it could be us that one of us that brings that last one in is oh I just want to read a couple scriptures and I'll be done uh Joshua 24 15. and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you whom ye will serve sorry is whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwells but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord amen and then just one more unamas second Timothy 4 7. I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept faith amen God bless you Jerry brother Jonathan Jerry and one of Jonathan certainly this is uh uh a profound topic um and it's amazing what we see going on right now yes from what the prophets prophesied thousands and thousands of years ago it's being completed in our time no wonder this was the time that they that they looked for conrason is and the time that they wanted to be in yeah and how privileged we are to be in this time you know in to understand what Gog and Magog is you know it's uh sometimes it seems like like a fairy tale a versus sometimes it seems like we get so caught up in our minds of of of what this really is we hear these words we hear Armageddon is and it uh it seems like it's it's it's fables we think of Armageddon as as maybe something like like Lord of the Rings for example but foreign I want to make everyone understand that this evening we look at it and it might seem scary is and um we we see so many events happening right now and we gotta go back to where to where we've uh we see Gog on the vemos and we're going to go back in Into the Book of Genesis I'm going to start with the 10th chapter of yes and the second verse yes and it reads like this yes the sons of japheth Gomer and Magog and maddai and Javen and tubal and meshech and tirus now in the Bible that's that's the first that you hear of Magog and La Villa is Magog when you when you see this this uh this event is and as you study it even more it's unlike any event there has ever been yes Hollywood can try in and Spruce it up as best as they can Hollywood uh foreign we understand that Para when we when we uh look at the scriptures this is like I said uh uh a great event Grande and it reads like this chapter 38. and the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man set thy face against Gog the land of Magog the chief Prince of meshech and tubal and prophesy against him and say thus saith the Lord God behold I am against thee oh God the chief Prince of meshech and tubal and I will turn thee back and put hooks into thy jaws and I will bring the fourth and all thine Army horses and Horsemen all of them closed with sorts with all sorts of armor even a great company with bucklers and shields all of them handling swords a how to refuse and those he had us it is Persia Ethiopia and Libya with them all of them with shield and helmet Gomer and all his bands the house of of tagarma of the north quarters and all his bands and many people with me casa de so confines tropas muchos Pueblos Contigo I don't know if the brothers have that map they they got it or not uh get the second map there we go hopefully we can that one was a little blurry but we can we can uh a little bit here alrighty so as as Ezekiel is is prophesying now keep in mind this is thousands and thousands of years ago but even even at thousands and thousands of years ago God's word remains perfect through time so we look at that first nation Persia Persia Persia is in in 1935 Persia and it means it changed its name to what's called Iran Iran and Iran is in the news constantly Iran it's a nation that not only hates uh hates America which to be honest it's we're really uh America itself is doing a great job of hating itself but it's also a nation that hates Israel it has said openly many times that it wants to wipe them off the map we know Iran as a country that is a that is an Islamic fundament that is the Islamic fundamentalist government yes Islamic the second Nation here the Bible says Ethiopia yes Ethiopia now it's not uh referring to the Ethiopia as we as we as we see it currently um but it's it's it's referring to Jose refere the area that we that we can see at see as Southern Egypt and Sudan Sudan keep in mind also Sudan is also an Islamic fundamental fundamentalist government and you're going to see a pattern in all of this foreign the third Nation Libya is to the west of Egypt it's strongly anti-america or anti-west ES anti-america anti-west anti-israel anti-israel and also an Islamic Nation Islamic number four numero cuatro we go to Gomer Gomer was also known as the Sumerians they originally lived north of the calcasus mountains in the southern part of what is modern-day Russia Moderno de Russia in ezekiel's time in El Tiempo de Ezekiel they had settled in what is now Central turkey Central okay number five numero Cinco we've got to garma that took the tagarma was identified by Josephus the josefas as the phrygians Como who uh or as a as as people who settled in what is called now what is called Eastern Turkey now yeah turkia we see turkey as as a nation right now that it's unlike these other nations mentioned before turkey is what they would maybe say their their Republic or democracy democracy they're part of NATO is but slowly but surely pero despacito they are leaning towards the way that these other countries are slowly leaning towards Islamic fundamentalism and I want you to see something really really interesting throughout the years Russia Russia and Iran Iran have never been friendly but as the saying goes the enemy of my enemy Elena is my friend es mi amigo anybody ever heard that uh the enemy of my enemy is my friend es mi amigo so here's brother Branham he says in the message the angel of the Lord now just remember this and watch it close we are in for the end times and I thought this was this is a really good sentence here really good statement yes it says watch geographically the healing geographicamente where your war is coming out just send you on that for just a minute it didn't say watch geographically where the war is coming out these noises it doesn't say watch geographically where the war is coming out but where your war is coming now see watch the Gog up there coming down so we understand now everybody understand he says watch the Gog up there coming down and I thought this was really really interesting down in Turkey and so ital the battles will not be settled in Korea Los batallas oh my goodness we just saw uh the other day or was it last week North Korea shot missiles over Japan Korea Del Norte uh in Japan I tell you everyone's getting on high alert but he says the battles will not be settled in Korea but over there in Palestine Palestine see we're near he says Billy Graham is going to have a meeting there in Washington Hermanos in Washington I was so happy for that is just a little afraid that we've sinned away our day of Grace I believe we're in for it I believe we're in for it when we come to a place where we join up and would throw aside the Bible and not even offer prayer nor nothing else to appease some ungodly nation that doesn't believe in God we're in for it that's right yes sir I said that from the beginning so how can you walk excuse me together except they be agreed that's true and when we throw off Christo alado we refused the cross and now we get a double cross um that's right that's what it is yes can you put up that picture of uh of the three men so in July 19th of this year and Julio de Julio there was this picture taken is to your to your right everyone know that President Putin Putin in the middle it's the president of Turkey and all the way to your left that's the leader of Iran Iran so imagine that coming to pass right before our very eyes a prophecy that was said thousands of years ago of these nations are rising now who is we've identified that as Russia amen amen the leader the leader in in the Book of Ezekiel when it's when it talks about the leader Gog it identifies him as the chief Prince of Principe or the ruler now we we understand through through history that Russia is a is a country or is it is a country that has that does not want anything to do with God they do not want anything to do with Israel Israel they are so against Israel in every way and this is and this is interesting and if you go back into um 38 Ezekiel 38 chapter 15. actually 14 I'm sorry therefore son of man prophesy and say unto God thus saith the Lord God and that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely shalt thou know it foreign thou and many people with thee and all of them riding upon horses a great company and a mighty Army Grand multitude back in 1990 or in the 90s um a a Soviet official official it was he was a spokesman he stated that in the early 90s principles that young people in the nation's schools are being required to learn Arabic yes as they're sick as their second language Segunda because his government had concluded that the future of their Nation lies with the Islamic nations of the world this was over 30 years ago and what has happened it has happened exactly as Ezekiel has had prophesied there's so much I'm I'm already over my time and I'm gonna I'm going to pass it over to brother Henry Henry you you live indigo sure is a subject that uh kind of keeps everybody kind of quiet because it's uh there's always been questions now with message believers [Music] message Believers is like well what's first Armageddon case what are we going to be here for this battle yes am I gonna make it and we make conclusions based on our fear yes and we leave the word to the side yeah we find comfort in it but uh but we just we just deal with our with our fears first seems like because those questions arise all the time well when is Armageddon going to happen [Music] well according to the politics and the systems of the world you already started so that brings questions in the mind of the believer so I'm gonna I'm gonna try to make it short today in my portion simply we're just going to call it Armageddon he must be born again you guys are looking at me like what are you talking about we think of Armageddon as as a battle that is just going to end the world is that the mind is this element is is that what we look at it oh of course it's gonna be is it going to be bad you're gonna be horrible really it's gonna it's gonna be a lot of Destruction and and if you look at these things as an American citizen you're missing it Lester Randall yeah we're in United States other nations look at this as something to to look forward to uh because they they want to see destruction on this nation and his people whereas when you start seeing all these enemies really coming up to understand when you realize that uh what's supposed to protect you is not that strong he consistency I mean really how strong how strong is yeah it is the as far as numbers goes and and and opinion this is the strongest army but who's leading it you see women that think that are men you get man to think they're women and they're the officials high-ranking officials of the Armed Forces where's the strength in that don't understand don't you think that our enemies know that is there respect for the power of United States no more no must because we had fallen into unbelief as a nation and there's no chance because the word needs to be fulfilled but just as that has to be fulfilled there's also a people there's also a call-out ones which is not just Americans not Suns that's what the mind is to change that behold I send you Elijah the prophet is not just for United States it's for the whole world as a matter of fact this is not Universal bride is universal so the mindset has to be different So speaking of Armageddon uh if you're a message believer are you a message believer you believe you're the bride you believe you're going to be here for all this mess is half of you are our bestest believer I'm right now I'm not a question in your confession Brothers but there's questions about that so you're not gonna be here so while we talk about it it's not for us let the Heat and burn up we don't have to be here we're the bride most Twitter where do we start brother Jerry and there was war in heaven [Music] Michael and his angels Miguel is Lucifer ideas and they kicked and they kicked him off heaven right was that the end of that war foreign let me ask you this um taking what brother Jerry said it's a war is and every war starts with the battle that was the first blows and and then who knows how many battles go on how many how many battles went on in the first World War uh that took place so this one war esta Guerra that started in heaven Michael and his Angel Miguel is Los Angeles bar against Lucifer and his angels um that's not over yet as a matter of fact let me just read this quote there's so much to read but let me just read this let me start with this quote says he says we're living in this great strange time we look at the papers noticias we see Armageddon coming up we see tanks atomic bombs atomicas we see the end of the Gentiles is at hand we see the world right is well we know that so and we we're preparing for it but then Brandon also says here in the port seal now the battle started in heaven it'll be finished on Earth well so I asked were you with Michael ayatras were you with it anybody do you I know we don't remember that well but you know were you with Michael at that time now on Sunday brother Caleb said um is he going to stand alone solo so again the bride you know this is not for us we're gone buddy don't pertain to us so is Michael Gonna Be Alone Miguel Vice star solo yo we start a fight and we're not gonna finish it is my question ask yourself your message believer you're you're you're you're a Christian Cristiano you you you know what's coming we have received the words of Prophecy we know yes but in reality we want to find the loop around it because we are dealing with our fears oh my God Russian is coming up what we're going to do was establishes come against our people oh yeah we fear war with your death if you're a torture but we forget that we were there with Michael Miguel how is that possible how can we call ourselves Believers yet we're afraid of an event that is about you and I okay Armageddon is not about Russia is [Music] not about the Romans is not about the enemies of the states or the enemies of of Israel but they'll be there but who else is going to be there Miguel but he's not alone they don't know it's the solo so if we can change the way we see things stop thinking as a carnal American o and start thinking through the revelation of the word then you start seeing things a little clearly anyway uh we want to talk about Armageddon because the scripture simply says Revelation 16 16. simply reads and he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon is so it's a place we always think War Emperor Atomic power or destruction destruction it's a place so let's put the word to the side let's start the place say that again let's study the place why is this place so important in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon it means the the hill or the city of megida significance the brothers just went to Israel they drove by it beautiful place and and it described as as a very interesting point on in history it is a valley that that sits about 50 miles north of Jerusalem and uh there are things there more important more important than our fears it is if the brothers can show me a picture picture of the valley Valley of uh it's also known as the value of Georgio that means your personal we can look at the other turn another picture we can put the other two pictures uh with with that one that Valley you can you can just leave those pictures there yeah that Valley is is known to be it's about 14 miles wide about 20 miles long come on and uh many events have taken place in here there was there have been some some bad events now that picture the professor that took these pictures he's standing in Mount Carmel in Monte Carmelo he claims that that's the location where Elijah built his altar this is and the view of the valley you can see the Valley from the south all the way uh to the from the south East I guess to the all the way to the northwest [Music] in this Valley it's not just appointed for for that event the event of the end of the world in this Valley there was many battles Saul and Jonathan died on that Valley Gideon beat the midianites in this Valley uh King the youngest king of uh that we found in the Bible die in this Valley as well many battles have been fought in this Valley but the most outstanding things to me it's that the ministry of Elijah is everything you read about Elijah [Music] have you ever read the story of Elijah out running uh the king asked questions he around the king's Chariot for eight miles across that Valley foreign [Music] the events of overcoming already set in place Los ceventus history has a count of 35 battles been been fought in this in this Valley the first one in 2350 BC is de Cristo the last one recorded in 1973 and the expected fight of Armageddon is 35 battles but I want to bring something here real quick receives the name of just real yeah just real correct yeah do you know where the name comes from have you ever read the story of Hosea is the lord gave him a son and in this is you go to the book of Hosea first chapter the third verse the daughter of Ibrahim and which conceive and bear a son and the Lord said unto him call his name Israel for yet a little while and I will avenge the blood of Israel upon the house of Yahoo to see the kingdom of the House of Israel and he shall come to pass at that day that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel Israel yes yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the son of the sea which cannot be measure or number and he shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them ye are not my people there it shall be said unto them ye are the sons of the Living God then shall the children of Judah the children of Israel be gathered together and appoint themselves one head and they shall come up out of the land for great shall beat the day of jezrael is a place that's the place so many things is not just a battle or or a atomic uh end of the world [Music] is a tremendous purpose in it first of all what started in heaven well there was no time where there was only but beings that were created to worship God Is War started in heaven the loser gots kicked out to earth now that kind of brings a question for ourselves why do we feel that we're kicked out to the Earth ourselves here we are well we have a purpose too but this is the only chance because this is the only time we're humans he ends an event that started in the in the Eternal Realms because evil was found in Lucifer in Lucifer he was sent down and bound into a area of time and in time we finish that war we finished that word we ended in in time that ESO cuts the possibilities of that Lucifer to ever become an angel is bound in time then starts a thousand years of peace now how is it bound a chain of circumstances so I ask you again are you going to be there by status Armageddon are you gonna be there only if you're born again is the new birth important is is the youth here I asked these men over here now he has the sisters over here because it's not important is the new birth important at all it's important how important is the Bible says the great and terrible day of the Lord you think is just that one day that there's a battle yeah let me ask you how much time is a day A Thousand Years millennials so it makes a difference when you're born again you understand Nuevo if you go and live a thousand years of Peace well where are you gonna be those a thousand years if you don't make it think about it what makes the difference the scripture says he must be born because yeah why why all this while this even matters well it doesn't matter if if you're not born of the spirit it doesn't have a purpose but that day but he's not alone but he's not alone we gotta end where we started back there then we'll have a thousand years of Peace how about that God bless you foreign I believe we can give another one to the Lord amen amen God is good this evening amen let us stand o nations are breaking and Israel's awaking the signs that the prophets foretold [Music] oh the
