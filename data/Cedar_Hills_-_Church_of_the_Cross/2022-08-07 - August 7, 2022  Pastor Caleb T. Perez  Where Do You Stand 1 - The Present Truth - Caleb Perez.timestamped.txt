[38:00] people are stranded
[38:02] they have lost their loved ones they
[38:04] have lost
[38:06] their properties
[38:08] so
[38:08] hunger
[38:10] and
[38:11] they are sad generally so what we are

[45:35] represent him in the country of mexico
[45:37] this last weekend
[45:44] we leave to colombia on thursday
[45:49] i was telling the
[45:51] one of the mexican pastors
[45:55] i said you're you're rich compared to
[45:57] these people of
[46:05] [Music]
[46:11] after you see this video your heart just
[46:14] breaks
[46:15] the videos
[46:18] it would be
[46:19] maybe
[46:20] not much if you didn't know them
[46:25] because many times we get we get
[46:28] hardened towards these videos
[46:33] videos but now that you know them
[46:37] uh it has fallen our lot to take care of
[46:40] them
[46:44] and the simplicity of the gospel is this
[46:48] implicit
[46:50] it is better to give
[46:52] isa
[47:23] god did not have to send forth
[47:25] jesus christ
[47:29] but in order to redeem the world he had
[47:31] too much
[47:34] and the first thing that he did that
[47:36] he
[47:49] in all of this i wanted just to read
[47:52] tell you a testimony
[47:56] i've had the the privilege of the last
[47:58] two months
[48:01] to to be able to speak with with men
[48:20] and i think that maybe me or or maybe
[48:24] people that claim the message in
[48:26] particular
[48:30] in general
[48:32] we always call ourselves
[48:34] non-denominational people
[48:38] nomination denomination and that's not
[48:41] the case yes no
[48:43] brother branham calls this
[48:44] inter-denominational
[48:46] iran
[48:58] coming to know the truth
[49:28] but i've had some of the greatest
[49:29] fellowship with these gentlemen
[49:34] and in them them you find a heart
[49:37] and egg
[49:39] these are businessmen
[49:42] i will not tell you who they are you
[49:43] know this is what is but they are people
[49:46] of a great heart
[49:50] when they found out what we were doing
[49:51] for africa
[49:56] they wanted to be part of it
[50:00] i told them about what god has done in
[50:03] our age
[50:06] i told them we follow the teachings of
[50:08] brother william mary and brandon
[50:13] they asked us
[50:14] what's the how do you you and so many
[50:17] words reconcile
[50:18] christ with
[50:20] what you believe
[50:22] in
[50:31] the understanding of the scripture and
[50:33] what we believe what brother branham was
[50:35] saying
[50:37] a lot of
[51:18] sometimes we come to the place of we
[51:20] have to defend
[51:24] when the word of god needs no defense
[51:29] the word of god is the word of god
[51:45] well we've had some great fellowship
[51:48] with these gentlemen
[51:52] i count them as people of god
[51:57] i i count them as people that that their
[52:00] heart is toward
[52:02] can you imagine people that don't come
[52:05] here but want to do and want to add
[52:08] their grain to what you do
[52:16] and i'm very proud of them
[52:19] very happy for their time that they have
[52:22] shared with us
[52:25] but when they found out we were doing
[52:26] bibles for africa
[52:31] these men got together
[52:34] and donated fifteen hundred dollars for
[52:36] the cause of affirmations
[52:41] [Applause]
[52:47] one of them
[52:49] as he is hearing our
[52:51] our sometimes we we we
[52:54] we believe what we believe
[52:58] is which is the greatest thing that i
[53:01] believe that there is
[53:04] but many times it is very common to us
[53:09] but when they heard the testimonies
[53:12] testimonials
[53:20] the testimonies
[53:22] testimonials of how god brought my
[53:24] father
[53:35] [Music]
[53:46] i testify this to the honor and glory of
[53:49] god
[53:52] he says
[53:54] he says uh
[53:56] i believe he called me tom
[53:58] yamatom he said he said tom
[54:02] i want to tell you after hearing these
[54:04] testimonies
[54:06] testimonials our church doesn't have the
[54:08] holy ghost no stigler not in the spirit
[54:10] to sound you guys do us
[54:13] he said our pastor is a good man
[54:17] he's speaking about his own pastor
[54:20] a good man he's a good preacher
[54:34] and the life is what the message
[54:36] produces
[54:39] so they might not see that a a certain
[54:42] thing of what they
[54:43] would call or you would call the message
[54:49] but if they receive him
[54:52] that i have sent okay
[54:55] they have received the message

[55:16] it's been just nothing but the greatest
[55:18] blessing of myself

[56:45] gentlemen

[56:51] and we thank the lord for that
[56:55] as he told them from the get-go
[57:11] that
[57:13] all i know is what brother branham says
[57:17] there'll be a lot of surprises at the
[57:18] judge
[57:24] i want to start a new series
[57:28] like any other series you know you can
[57:30] go on to the coming of the lord
[57:34] and i was inspired to
[57:36] as i was as i was uh studying this
[57:40] right before i went to mexico the lord
[57:42] began to deal with me on this
[57:46] it may be many things that you have
[57:48] already heard
[57:51] this as we put a foundation to this
[57:54] message today
[57:57] we'll see where the lord takes us on
[57:59] this series
[58:01] the name of the series where do you
[58:03] stand
[58:05] quite a question
[58:35] you know you you hear so much of that
[58:37] today
[58:39] well that's your truth not my truth yes
[58:42] that annoys me how many truths are there
[58:46] but jesus said pero jesus
[59:00] but there is only one
[59:02] the truth
[59:15] malachi the third chapter and the second
[59:17] verse
[59:21] today
[59:23] we have an extensive youth service
[59:25] tonight
[59:28] but we want to get into the word now
[59:31] malachi 3 verse 2 when you have it you
[59:33] can say amen
[59:37] but who may abide the day of his coming
[59:45] and who shall stand
[59:47] when he appears
[59:52] or he is like a refiner's fire and like
[59:54] fuller soap
[59:56] orchestra
[1:00:00] may god add his blessings to the reign
[1:00:01] of his word you may be seated
[1:00:04] god bless all the visitors that are here
[1:00:06] today
[1:00:08] amen brother jesus god bless you that's
[1:00:10] his daughter and his and his son there
[1:00:12] god bless you this morning jesus amen
[1:00:15] and the different ones that are here god
[1:00:16] bless you
[1:00:19] what a thing it is and it's a question
[1:00:21] who
[1:00:22] may abide the day of his coming
[1:00:34] sometimes we may have certain things in
[1:00:37] our minds
[1:00:41] we claim that we stand for certain
[1:00:44] things is that right
[1:00:47] here can say i you know i stand for
[1:00:48] something
[1:00:51] you stand for someone we say i stand for
[1:00:54] something yo me paro
[1:00:56] but as we make these claims
[1:01:00] the question comes back
[1:01:02] who shall stand when he appears
[1:01:07] it's easy to say i stand yes
[1:01:12] but when he appears
[1:01:14] then the truth is known
[1:01:18] as manifestation we hear this all the
[1:01:19] time i'm standing on his word
[1:01:22] is
[1:01:33] [Applause]
[1:01:35] the question then comes
[1:01:49] when we have good health buena salud a
[1:01:52] little bit of money
[1:01:54] few friends
[1:01:56] amigos good job
[1:01:58] nice church
[1:02:00] plenty of food
[1:02:02] and we can say oh we're really standing
[1:02:33] on the isle of patmos
[1:02:37] john had been around jesus we know that
[1:02:40] jesus
[1:02:41] had laid there on his chest
[1:02:45] he had eaten with him
[1:02:47] but notice that when he was on this isle
[1:02:50] of patmos
[1:02:52] the angel that jesus christ said i have
[1:02:55] sent mine angel
[1:02:59] he comes to john
[1:03:01] and begins to tell him about
[1:03:04] things that are to be he's telling him
[1:03:06] about the church
[1:03:10] and his appearing to john was
[1:03:13] so impactful is
[1:03:17] that revelations 1 17 all john could say
[1:03:20] is
[1:03:21] when i saw him
[1:03:23] i fell at his feet as dead
[1:03:40] that's why i say we can act real tough
[1:03:43] and we we yeah we we've got it together
[1:03:47] john says
[1:03:49] when he saw that angel i fell at his
[1:03:52] feet as dead pero juan condola
[1:03:57] daniel the eighth chapter daniel
[1:03:59] capitulo those of you have read this
[1:04:02] many times
[1:04:05] this was a vision that daniel had esther
[1:04:08] daniel and i want to pick it up on the
[1:04:10] 16th verse if i me
[1:04:14] and i heard a man's voice between the
[1:04:16] banks of july which called and said
[1:04:19] gabriel
[1:04:20] make this man to understand the vision
[1:04:24] you know
[1:04:31] i want you to notice daniel was not
[1:04:33] sitting down laying down daniel was
[1:04:36] standing up daniel lost
[1:04:40] and he
[1:04:41] he comes there and and verse 17 says so
[1:04:44] he came near
[1:04:45] where i stood vino
[1:04:49] estaba my question once again where do
[1:04:51] you stand on this thousand
[1:04:53] daniel was standing here it seems like
[1:04:55] on the banks of this river
[1:04:59] but when the angel came to him
[1:05:03] gabriel the angel we know who it was
[1:05:16] i believe church that where we are at
[1:05:18] today
[1:05:20] maybe this is a different kind of
[1:05:22] message
[1:05:24] but it's a message to make us check
[1:05:26] ourselves
[1:05:31] there is a reverent fear that is coming
[1:05:36] so here he says i was afraid and i fell
[1:05:39] on my face
[1:05:42] i see daniel here then
[1:05:45] he couldn't even stand anymore
[1:05:49] once again where do you stand
[1:05:53] it goes on to say but he said unto me
[1:05:55] understand oh son of man
[1:05:59] for at the time of the end
[1:06:02] shall be the vision
[1:06:06] he's telling him he's showing him he's
[1:06:08] gonna he's gonna he's gonna gonna tell
[1:06:10] him what this vision means
[1:06:14] this was a direct command to the angela
[1:06:29] but do we understand the vision this
[1:06:31] morning
[1:06:34] i look into the mirror many times and i
[1:06:36] say lord i don't understand certain
[1:06:38] things
[1:06:41] but when he sends the answer
[1:06:44] and
[1:06:57] watch as this unfolds
[1:07:02] now as he was speaking with me
[1:07:04] i was in a deep sleep on my face
[1:07:08] toward the ground
[1:07:10] is
[1:07:16] [Music]
[1:07:24] he couldn't i mean just to be in the
[1:07:27] presence of that angel
[1:07:30] you you can't you can't handle i can't
[1:07:33] handle that
[1:07:35] but when the angel is about to show you
[1:07:37] something
[1:07:38] else
[1:07:40] he's gonna tell you
[1:07:50] and that means that he put him back on
[1:07:51] his feet
[1:07:54] and he's telling
[1:08:10] lest you fall
[1:08:12] but when the angel comes
[1:08:14] and begins to reveal the message the
[1:08:17] word the vision
[1:08:21] places you exactly where you need to be
[1:08:25] and he makes you stand there
[1:08:28] you want to understand
[1:08:30] that's my question this morning
[1:08:32] how many of you want to understand this
[1:08:34] morning
[1:08:35] somebody want to understand the
[1:08:51] and i was sick
[1:08:53] certain days
[1:08:58] brother diego
[1:09:00] that angel
[1:09:02] that you that you saw is
[1:09:32] are
[1:09:36] brother branham passed out when he saw
[1:09:38] the vision of jesus
[1:09:43] paul was knocked off his horse
[1:09:46] are you really ready to
[1:09:48] receive and to stand in his presence
[1:09:53] we stand in church and we get the
[1:09:54] blessings of the lord
[1:09:57] it's wonderful
[1:09:59] the blessings are wonderful
[1:10:02] when his presence comes
[1:10:04] and you have to give an account
[1:10:07] everything that you have said
[1:10:10] everything you have thought look up and
[1:10:12] everything you have done okay let me
[1:10:14] tell you you and i would not be able to
[1:10:17] stand in the presence
[1:10:21] there is a reverence that god requires
[1:10:26] a holy god that we're talking
[1:10:30] it's not about just well i'm going to
[1:10:31] live any kind of life and then ask for
[1:10:33] forgiveness when i get to church
[1:10:37] question is where do you really stand
[1:10:39] this morning
[1:10:42] it's
[1:11:37] everybody always wants to know where do
[1:11:39] you stand on this issue
[1:11:43] and age we live
[1:11:45] what do you what do you think about this
[1:11:48] what do you think about gay rights
[1:11:51] what do you think about general gender
[1:11:53] identity
[1:11:56] all these things that they politicize
[1:12:00] but then the question then we come back
[1:12:02] to them what think ye of christ
[1:12:06] christ
[1:12:09] come on now there's there's more than
[1:12:11] one side to things here
[1:12:14] you hear people all the time say well
[1:12:16] when i when i see the lord
[1:12:20] i'm gonna tell him this or that
[1:12:23] i'm going to demand an answer from god
[1:12:30] you wouldn't even be able to speak
[1:12:34] because of how holy he is
[1:12:38] brother branham says that god is such a
[1:12:40] holy god
[1:12:43] that even the angels even the heavens
[1:12:45] look dirty to him
[1:13:05] how many believers do we have
[1:13:08] how many know where you're standing
[1:13:12] we have to know where we stand
[1:13:15] you know when we see these things
[1:13:19] if man can't even handle the angel that
[1:13:21] is sent
[1:13:24] how will we ever stand before a holy
[1:13:26] ghost
[1:13:29] we many times can't even stand for the
[1:13:31] truth
[1:13:34] we can't even stand for what we claim to
[1:13:36] believe
[1:13:39] much less stand for christ
[1:13:44] i
[1:13:56] standing before the
[1:13:58] judgment seat of christ
[1:14:02] and having to give an account for our
[1:14:04] lives
[1:14:06] we have been given opportunity after
[1:14:09] opportunity
[1:14:26] oh i'm telling you it becomes more of a
[1:14:30] reverent fear like never before
[1:14:35] god wants courageous men and women
[1:14:39] that will stand for the truth
[1:14:46] and the word stand there doesn't mean
[1:14:48] that you're idle that you're not moving
[1:14:53] or that you're not in action
[1:15:09] you take the assault and and you endure
[1:15:10] it
[1:15:13] amen it's to take your place
[1:15:18] and be in your position yes
[1:15:24] there's only one thing church that god
[1:15:27] that it pleases him
[1:15:30] the bible says that without faith it's
[1:15:33] impossible to please
[1:15:35] impossible
[1:15:36] so who will be in their position
[1:15:42] when he appears
[1:15:45] who will stand came back and the worst
[1:15:47] stand is it it's right here you take
[1:15:49] your place
[1:16:05] this is a whole different this is a
[1:16:07] whole different message today
[1:16:11] i wanted to settle in this this is this
[1:16:13] is the foundation that we're laying yes
[1:16:17] for the series
[1:16:30] if he appeared in your home today to
[1:16:44] or will the woman be caught in his place
[1:16:53] would he find the
[1:16:54] couples married
[1:16:58] living true to their vows
[1:17:14] where do you stand
[1:17:17] will he find the children
[1:17:20] the youth
[1:17:21] respecting their parents
[1:17:26] or will he will he find a divided home
[1:17:33] will he find the husband and wife
[1:17:35] calling each other dude
[1:17:41] or will he find them treating each other
[1:17:55] what a thing where do i stand
[1:18:01] and who shall stand when he appears
[1:18:05] we're not interested this morning in
[1:18:07] opinions or
[1:18:08] someone's ideas
[1:18:19] you know we have it in this church
[1:18:23] you know we have it in the chat
[1:18:39] it gets a little uneasy huh after a
[1:18:40] while
[1:18:49] this is not easy
[1:18:51] i sat here and i cried this morning
[1:18:58] i began to type this and i looked at
[1:19:00] this and i just how can you not cry
[1:19:04] and answer the question lord where do i
[1:19:07] stand
[1:19:08] pregnant
[1:19:10] divided homes
[1:19:12] and the men sit back
[1:19:16] do nothing about it
[1:19:18] job 38 2 and 3 says who is this
[1:20:02] where were you when i laid the
[1:20:03] foundations of the earth
[1:20:07] declare if thou hast understand it
[1:20:12] yourself the question where was i
[1:20:14] standing
[1:20:29] that you're standing for today
[1:20:32] nothing has changed
[1:20:35] where you stood at the beginning is
[1:20:37] where you'll stand at the end
[1:20:40] that's why god is asking job and telling
[1:20:43] him i want an answer
[1:21:13] that professed the message
[1:21:16] they would rather see you fail
[1:21:22] to sit there and have a conversation
[1:21:26] in the churches someone is always asking
[1:21:28] the question
[1:21:32] that's why i tell you people and i pray
[1:21:34] you listen closely
[1:21:37] you know sometimes people come to church
[1:21:40] listen to church
[1:21:55] anymore especially
[1:21:56] why because most people that's that do
[1:21:58] that
[1:22:00] don't even know what they're really
[1:22:01] talking about
[1:22:03] hello everybody
[1:22:05] hola a new family comes to church
[1:22:08] and then all
[1:22:21] a challenge for you is
[1:22:31] you know it's sad that i heard this the
[1:22:33] other day oh yes
[1:22:36] certain people
[1:22:37] they were thinking of coming to church
[1:22:42] and they
[1:22:44] they overheard somebody from this church
[1:22:48] telling somebody else from this church
[1:23:04] why would we go to a church like that
[1:23:08] people in that church are laughing and
[1:23:10] making fun of their own people
[1:23:15] shame on us
[1:23:17] we'll answer to god foreign
[1:23:33] and our words many times are far from
[1:23:35] there
[1:23:38] you go somewhere to church
[1:23:41] and the questions are they keep coming
[1:23:43] where do you stand
[1:23:46] where
[1:23:58] are you with the tape people or the
[1:24:00] ministry ministries
[1:24:05] are you with the thunder people or the
[1:24:06] no thunder people
[1:24:10] are you with the returned people that
[1:24:11] are not returned
[1:24:14] with the ten
[1:24:26] [Music]
[1:24:47] i'm not here to choose sides with people
[1:24:54] we have our doctrine here
[1:25:06] maybe i don't care what other churches
[1:25:08] do nothing talking to us is
[1:25:23] paul says god knew what to do with me
[1:25:27] i want to exalt myself under the
[1:25:29] revelations that i received
[1:25:33] he put a thorn on my side
[1:25:36] and this is what the lord showed uh
[1:25:51] such a thing
[1:25:52] that i say my heart melts
[1:25:56] and i feel faint when i hear those
[1:25:58] things
[1:26:00] who shall stand when he appears
[1:26:04] matthew 12 25 speaks to us
[1:26:09] and it says and jesus
[1:26:11] knew their thoughts jesus
[1:26:15] and said unto them every kingdom divided
[1:26:17] against itself is brought to desolation
[1:26:23] and every city or house divided against
[1:26:26] itself
[1:26:27] shall not stand
[1:26:32] where do you stand
[1:26:34] where does your house stand
[1:26:37] when it's divided against itself it
[1:26:40] cannot stand
[1:26:45] jesus knew their thoughts jesus
[1:26:48] what about our
[1:26:52] it's easy to read oh jesus knew the
[1:26:54] thoughts of those pharisees
[1:26:58] but he knows your thoughts
[1:27:14] simply something that has been impressed
[1:27:16] on us through our lives
[1:27:27] a certain doctrine or a certain church's
[1:27:29] ideas
[1:27:35] and that's usually what we hold on and
[1:27:37] believe to be true
[1:27:40] my parents were catholic so i'm catholic
[1:27:57] you're not standing on firm grounds
[1:28:02] i want you to get this now
[1:28:04] imagine to rest your eternal destination
[1:28:10] mom and dad believed it
[1:28:19] but you have to know
[1:28:21] that you have to have your own personal
[1:28:23] relationship
[1:28:26] that's what the bible it tells us to try
[1:28:29] the spirits
[1:28:31] and spirits try the thoughts
[1:28:34] see if those thoughts are from god or
[1:28:36] not
[1:28:39] come on church how many do that
[1:28:42] you get a thought do you try the fart
[1:28:46] and the first thing we should do
[1:28:49] i want proof
[1:28:51] you better tell that thought
[1:28:54] i want to prove
[1:29:36] there were
[1:29:50] this thought began at this point
[1:29:55] this morning
[1:29:58] that we preached
[1:30:00] is the very thoughts of god
[1:30:04] that were birthed
[1:30:18] are we
[1:30:33] to stand or where to stand
[1:30:37] today we serve the lord tomorrow
[1:30:40] today we we love we love each other
[1:30:42] tomorrow
[1:30:45] by the spirits
[1:30:59] and because of the lack of unity
[1:31:03] that's the reason there are so many
[1:31:05] divided homes
[1:31:08] divided churches
[1:31:11] divided relationships
[1:31:14] divided kingdoms
[1:31:24] there are three categories that must be
[1:31:26] restored
[1:31:33] [Music]
[1:31:52] this is huge nowadays
[1:31:55] because it's probably one of the hottest
[1:31:57] topics of the day
[1:32:02] is the husband and wife one or two el
[1:32:04] esposes
[1:32:08] it should be one
[1:32:16] people can be married 100 years and
[1:32:18] still not be won
[1:32:23] the church one or two el pastores
[1:32:27] [Music]
[1:32:30] is christ and his bride one or two es
[1:32:34] christo
[1:32:37] where
[1:32:38] do you stand
[1:32:47] as long as the husband and wife are not
[1:32:49] thoroughly identified no standing in
[1:32:52] vienna
[1:32:54] as long as the pastor and the church are
[1:32:56] not thoroughly identified
[1:33:03] as long as christ and his bride are not
[1:33:05] thoroughly identified
[1:33:18] that should be the first thing that
[1:33:19] happens in a marriage
[1:33:28] [Music]
[1:33:34] what he's supposed to do in the marriage
[1:33:39] what the word of god says that he should
[1:33:40] do
[1:33:42] and the wife must be thoroughly
[1:33:44] identified
[1:33:47] what is required of her
[1:34:02] know how to identify themselves in the
[1:34:04] marriage
[1:34:05] identification
[1:34:06] what happens even in the church
[1:34:09] they don't know how to identify the
[1:34:11] pastors
[1:34:13] it's not just the man up there that
[1:34:15] preaches on sunday no solos
[1:34:30] gender identity problems
[1:34:36] hello everybody
[1:34:38] we're getting to something here thomas
[1:34:40] who shall stand in this wicked evil age
[1:34:59] and i had got this from brother danny
[1:35:00] when he preached it's been a couple of
[1:35:02] years back
[1:35:05] wonderful there are messages that just
[1:35:07] stick to you
[1:35:10] whether danny was talking about how that
[1:35:12] in genesis 1 god said and god created
[1:35:15] and god did and god did
[1:35:18] have blood
[1:35:21] amen genesis 2 he forms the man yeah
[1:35:27] and now foreign start to read in genesis
[1:35:29] 2.
[1:35:31] the lord god
[1:35:34] the lord god said yes
[1:35:36] the lord god it wasn't just god anymore
[1:35:39] it was the lord god
[1:35:54] but if you go to the hebrew cross
[1:35:56] the word lord there
[1:35:59] means
[1:36:02] which means
[1:36:04] one with his family
[1:36:06] so now in chapter three
[1:36:20] he approaches him he says so god hath
[1:36:22] said
[1:36:31] that in itself shows that he did not
[1:36:34] want god to be one with his family
[1:36:57] without the proper name of of the lord
[1:37:00] jesus christ
[1:37:04] dare
[1:37:27] i'm going to say it again there are so
[1:37:29] many people today that don't have an
[1:37:31] identity
[1:37:46] you better have a better identity than
[1:37:47] that
[1:37:49] i believe your identity will show you
[1:37:51] who your pastor is to be wrong
[1:37:55] but you don't have to know who you are
[1:37:59] and there's there's an identity problem
[1:38:02] here
[1:38:03] there's an identity problem in the world
[1:38:05] today
[1:38:08] shall stand without an identity
[1:38:12] you can't go nowhere without an identity
[1:38:28] that's who you are let me pray with the
[1:38:30] kines
[1:38:32] well i go to church
[1:38:34] that's not proof yes
[1:38:36] the devil goes to church
[1:38:39] well i've been going to church since i
[1:38:40] was a baby
[1:38:53] and then we'll talk
[1:38:55] about
[1:38:58] [Music]
[1:39:11] are
[1:39:13] they can't identify what they are
[1:39:16] this is the problem today
[1:39:19] once again they can't identify who they
[1:39:21] are no
[1:39:23] they can't identify what they are
[1:39:26] therefore they can't identify their part
[1:39:28] in the relationship
[1:39:32] who shall stand when he appears
[1:39:46] but by the present estate that we're in
[1:39:50] right now establishing establishment
[1:40:19] where are you identified amongst the
[1:40:22] crowd
[1:40:26] and that's not just the crowd out there
[1:40:29] even the crowd in church
[1:40:33] where are you identified
[1:40:48] or do you mix really well
[1:40:53] brother brown goes on what group are you
[1:40:56] with
[1:40:59] i'm with the caleb and joshua outfit
[1:41:02] uh
[1:41:05] if you see it's not that you choose a
[1:41:07] group to be in no excuse
[1:41:10] but your choice to serve the lord
[1:41:14] automatically puts you in that group
[1:41:16] automatically
[1:41:18] is that right brother andrew
[1:41:20] i said brother andrew you don't join
[1:41:22] this church
[1:41:25] you are baptized by one spirit
[1:41:28] body of christ
[1:41:30] that right brother andrew a man of mine
[1:41:32] andrew that's right
[1:41:34] he's going to get baptized
[1:41:38] it's important to know where you're
[1:41:40] standing that's important
[1:41:43] are you with the believer esta con los
[1:41:46] crientes or do you have to be
[1:41:47] entertained at church
[1:41:52] oh if the music isn't just all just good
[1:41:55] i don't see live music
[1:41:57] making me jump out of my seats
[1:42:11] you see when someone doesn't know where
[1:42:13] they're standing
[1:42:16] they always feel threatened when someone
[1:42:18] disagrees with them
[1:42:23] that's why tell your brother
[1:42:25] don't you ever feel threatened by anyone
[1:42:30] yeah there was a man that was picking on
[1:42:32] my one of my guys
[1:42:37] he can handle himself pretty good though
[1:42:42] i said put him on the phone
[1:42:44] here i am walking around best buy
[1:42:46] preaching away
[1:42:50] trying to tell me
[1:42:52] that there is only one coming of christ
[1:42:55] i said poor you i said it's all over the
[1:42:57] bible there's three comings of christ
[1:43:00] they don't see the secret coming
[1:43:04] because it's not for everyone
[1:43:07] he said i believe that everyone goes
[1:43:09] through the great tribulation
[1:43:12] maybe you but not me i won't be there
[1:43:18] after a little while
[1:43:20] i was like hello
[1:44:05] our our belief but it makes us dig more
[1:44:07] no no
[1:44:08] no
[1:44:09] why i'm so grateful for the for god
[1:44:11] sending this seventh angel
[1:44:15] greatest message that has ever hit
[1:44:18] planet earth
[1:44:32] brought by the seventh angel
[1:44:35] to you and i okay
[1:44:38] raised us up
[1:44:39] and placed us in heavenly places
[1:44:43] jesus christ where we stand is
[1:45:56] and the question has arisen so much
[1:45:59] lately
[1:46:02] is a woman
[1:46:05] we hit on that a little bit last time
[1:46:10] and you
[1:46:19] and all these different professors from
[1:46:21] universities
[1:46:24] none of them
[1:47:15] this is my birth certificate oh okay
[1:47:19] so you had you oh this is where you were
[1:47:21] born
[1:47:22] i have a birth certificate for what is a
[1:47:24] woman
[1:47:27] where do i find that in the book of
[1:47:29] genesis
[1:47:31] the chapter el capitulo
[1:47:33] has its beginnings
[1:47:42] god raised up to bring forth children
[1:47:45] into this world
[1:47:48] somebody i don't want
[1:48:02] you have the birth certificate
[1:48:04] certificate nobody's going to tell you
[1:48:05] anything different
[1:48:07] i already searched the back no you are
[1:48:09] the school that's exactly what the
[1:48:11] abstract title d does
[1:48:15] it's an abstract it's an abstraction
[1:48:17] searches it back to the beginning
[1:48:21] to see who was with the owners at one
[1:48:23] time or through the years
[1:48:27] where did it come from
[1:48:29] where is the baby
[1:48:34] wow this is how much she weighs she
[1:48:36] weighed peso
[1:48:38] he or she
[1:48:41] he or she
[1:48:44] oh
[1:48:59] know where we're standing
[1:49:02] don't you believe anything anyone else
[1:49:07] unless you go back and find its
[1:49:09] inception
[1:49:12] that's
[1:49:25] message hits your heart
[1:49:40] where were
[1:49:48] there's no gender identity failure there
[1:49:51] i in my fire the header of the day i'm a
[1:49:53] man and says answer me like
[1:50:08] and the question arises today
[1:50:12] again i already said this but i'm going
[1:50:13] to say it again
[1:50:16] is a church
[1:50:19] and many cannot answer that
[1:50:22] oh we're the church of the living god
[1:50:26] that's that's good there's nothing wrong
[1:50:27] with that
[1:50:28] that's part of the answer especially
[1:50:30] the only way to answer that
[1:50:34] what is the church yes
[1:50:35] go back to its birthing
[1:50:51] i have to bring some doctrinal points
[1:50:53] here
[1:50:55] i'm not in any way throwing at anyone
[1:50:56] that don't believe like us god bless
[1:50:58] them
[1:51:00] i love them and i can sit down with any
[1:51:02] of them any time
[1:51:05] there's nothing against any brothers or
[1:51:07] sisters
[1:51:10] but how can you have a church without a
[1:51:13] pastor
[1:51:15] it's just a meeting place
[1:51:18] brother brown says how can i overcome
[1:51:20] commodities
[1:51:22] your pastor is your husband
[1:51:24] spiritually speaking
[1:51:30] that's not
[1:51:31] that's not up for discussion it is what
[1:51:33] it is
[1:51:36] but sometimes the church wants to tell
[1:51:38] the pastor what to do
[1:51:42] what's going on gender identity problems
[1:51:48] i want to put my own little group gender
[1:51:50] identity problem
[1:51:53] you don't have a birth certificate for
[1:51:55] that
[1:51:56] certificate
[1:51:57] hold i send you elijah the
[1:52:00] prophet for the coming of the great and
[1:52:03] dreadful day of the lord
[1:52:06] and he shall turn the heart of the
[1:52:08] fathers to the children
[1:52:12] and the heart of the children to their
[1:52:14] fathers
[1:52:26] scripture not only shows its birthplace
[1:53:10] not against anyone
[1:53:19] but i have to say what the prophet says
[1:53:24] what paul
[1:53:34] and without holy ghost-filled men
[1:53:38] who are called to fill the offices
[1:53:42] in that church
[1:53:47] forgive me but don't forgive me
[1:53:50] tape does not fill the office
[1:54:18] this is we gotta know where we're
[1:54:20] standing
[1:54:23] this is what he says
[1:54:26] this is brother branham these apostles
[1:54:30] prophets prophetess teachers
[1:54:32] evangelists
[1:54:33] and pastors pastors are god sent not god
[1:54:37] or not man called son
[1:54:41] god sent inspired men
[1:54:44] to keep the church lined up
[1:54:51] it's gifts of the spirit in the church
[1:54:53] that keep that church
[1:54:57] if a real church was ordained of god
[1:55:01] really filled with the holy spirit
[1:55:04] sin would appear in the church
[1:55:08] if sin would appear in the church
[1:55:15] if somebody had done something wrong
[1:55:18] the holy spirit would raise up and
[1:55:20] reveal it
[1:55:26] thank god that he's placed gifts in the
[1:55:28] church
[1:55:30] keeps
[1:55:42] that's why
[1:55:44] they may not like me for this because
[1:55:45] that's why there's no such a thing as a
[1:55:47] tape church
[1:55:51] and i'm not throwing anyone that gets
[1:55:52] together and here's tapes yeah i bless
[1:55:54] them
[1:55:55] nothing against them
[1:55:57] but the tape shows those offices
[1:56:01] how a church should be set up
[1:56:05] how a church should run
[1:56:08] how a home should run
[1:56:11] and how the individual should conduct
[1:56:13] themselves
[1:56:15] the tape shows all that
[1:56:18] gotta take people
[1:56:20] that will believe the message
[1:56:26] get into the place or the position that
[1:56:28] god has has predestined for them to be
[1:56:30] in
[1:56:31] the position
[1:56:34] i don't say this to throw at anyone
[1:56:37] but i say this who establish you in the
[1:56:39] faith
[1:57:15] wherefore i will not be negligent
[1:57:19] to put you always in remembrance of
[1:57:21] these
[1:57:22] things yes
[1:57:23] though ye know them
[1:57:25] and be established
[1:57:28] in the present yeah
[1:57:34] wait wait wait a minute wait we got it
[1:57:36] we gotta
[1:57:50] but because
[1:58:05] and and paul he knew he had to get them
[1:58:08] into grace
[1:58:12] peter finally realizes
[1:58:15] the ministry that god placed in paul
[1:58:18] ministerio quezon
[1:58:32] i know what's
[1:59:12] the purpose of these messages for that
[1:59:14] reason
[1:59:17] establish you in the present truth
[1:59:19] especially
[1:59:25] know where you're standing
[1:59:27] it's a progressive revelation
[1:59:31] not different from the first revelation
[1:59:39] okay
[1:59:40] it's it's not different
[1:59:42] but it's a furtherance of that
[1:59:44] revelation
[1:59:46] and this is the present truth yes
[1:59:50] why jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:59:54] the present
[1:59:57] and and
[1:59:57] revelation is always it is always
[2:00:00] progressing
[2:00:04] that's the problem with people today
[2:00:07] yesterday
[2:00:09] and they don't see what the present
[2:00:10] truth is
[2:00:13] my goodness
[2:00:19] i don't know maybe i should stop here
[2:00:21] have you had enough no yeah
[2:00:24] sure you want me to go a little bit more
[2:00:27] i'm telling you
[2:00:29] this really has hit me to my soul
[2:00:32] to establish us yesterday
[2:00:39] in the ephesian church age
[2:00:43] it speaks he speaks this la esto
[2:00:47] it was the apostles
[2:00:50] oh brother jimmy loves that subject
[2:01:04] that original word could not change
[2:02:01] that's right
[2:02:15] but he can give a revelation
[2:02:41] that that seed had to come through
[2:02:43] abraham
[2:02:51] said that it would come by the same
[2:02:53] bloodlines in david
[2:02:58] and it was the same
[2:03:11] i have come to make you understand
[2:03:19] and it's never been so great
[2:03:23] even from the moment that brother
[2:03:25] branham brought the message
[2:03:34] [Music]
[2:03:40] he's the one
[2:04:05] do you believe like me brother they may
[2:04:07] ask me
[2:04:49] this is my vision for
[2:04:54] in other words what he was preaching
[2:04:56] what he was seeing
[2:04:59] now seeing the vision for the future
[2:05:03] but the vision for the future
[2:05:19] i'm looking at the presents
[2:05:22] brother branham says this is my vision
[2:05:24] for the future
[2:05:27] and the message will take you
[2:05:30] it says
[2:05:31] so that you can
[2:05:58] there has been many groups of men that
[2:06:00] god has used
[2:06:03] but i also see this group of men
[2:06:07] what if i had a group of men
[2:06:11] trained in the message
[2:06:14] this is
[2:07:45] [Music]
[2:07:51] they were trying to destroy his
[2:07:52] influence before the people
[2:07:55] influence the same as they're doing now
[2:07:59] if they can just destroy the influence
[2:08:01] of the message
[2:08:05] before the people
[2:08:16] we will not let nothing whip this
[2:08:18] message
[2:08:44] but we also have the marriage
[2:08:48] [Music]
[2:08:56] can i have like 10 minutes and then i'll
[2:08:57] let you go see man
[2:08:59] of bombs

[2:09:42] minister
[2:09:44] it was the body there's
[2:09:56] what would you do for the lord if
[2:10:13] would you serve the lord the rest of the
[2:10:16] days of your life

[2:10:27] of the lord jesus christ for the
[2:10:28] remission of your sins

[2:17:32] the lack of their faith
[2:17:35] i'm telling you this morning the way i
[2:17:38] see this
[2:17:39] is
[2:17:44] that's a question for you to ask
[2:17:46] yourself
[2:17:48] jesus
[2:17:50] jesus
[2:17:51] of your great faith
[2:17:54] because of your lack
[2:18:08] two things that made him react
[2:18:12] those who believe
[2:18:15] and they weren't expected to believe
[2:18:19] and those
[2:18:21] with every reason to believe contol
[2:18:28] my question is does he marvel at us
[2:18:30] today
[2:18:33] for a lack of faith
[2:18:35] or for a great faith
[2:18:47] does he marvel at you because you
[2:18:48] believe him
[2:18:50] is even when all the world turned their
[2:18:54] back on you okay
[2:18:57] maybe your family turned their back on
[2:18:58] you so familiar
[2:19:00] been through things in your life and no
[2:19:02] one you say nobody could love me he says
[2:19:14] that you would believe with all your
[2:19:15] heart
[2:19:20] young people don't let it be that he
[2:19:21] marvels the other way
[2:19:27] to be raised
[2:19:31] you've been taught right and shown right
[2:19:36] you've had the opportunity to live for
[2:19:38] the lord with all your heart
[2:19:43] fully surrendered
[2:19:48] marvel him that way no
[2:19:50] no
[2:19:52] but can you marvel him today
[2:19:55] but even in the darkest most sinful time
[2:20:00] you've chosen to live for him
[2:20:04] and to be a light shining in a dark
[2:20:05] world
[2:20:08] chosen to take sides with jesus
[2:20:12] and to withstand all the negative
