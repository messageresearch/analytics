[1:02:18] IE Porto optical image is now a feminist
[1:02:22] when we look at this one to me Ramos
[1:02:24] says everyone has their own ideas whose
[1:02:27] propia see yes even what they think of
[1:02:29] the message or what they think of the
[1:02:30] scriptures you say I look at that missus
[1:02:33] domestically to that yet it shouldn't be
[1:02:34] that way I want to know Vidya said this
[1:02:36] terminate I realize that our past or our
[1:02:38] ideas or the way that we think know that
[1:02:41] most cuenta que la manera que nosotros
[1:02:43] paints them off there they have been
[1:02:44] formed by past influences and still four
[1:02:47] miles per influences whether in our
[1:02:49] lives
[1:02:50] yes yes whether in in another church
[1:02:52] that we used to attend 103 glaze ain't
[1:02:54] kept your home or school a glaze but the
[1:02:57] message of the hour as we heard please
[1:03:00] you're not some new idea Lewis good idea
[1:03:03] and whether I'm here to tell you is the
[1:03:05] message of the hour it means secondary
[1:03:09] thoughts of guys and hope you paint some
[1:03:11] analysis it throw a body here on earth
[1:03:14] we're partying up here that's why we
[1:03:16] tend many times to lean one way or the
[1:03:18] other what is the most whether it is
[1:03:22] issues in life
[1:03:23] Jessica see whether it is because of
[1:03:26] influences
[1:03:27] oh poor case here they come whether it
[1:03:29] is issues in a church oh poor Casey and
[1:03:31] that's why everybody has their idea for
[1:03:34] the way that a church should be run what
[1:03:36] is it come here they come on like lazy I
[1:03:38] said career but I want to tell you that
[1:03:40] well you look it is not my idea of how
[1:03:43] this church should be rise me there como
[1:03:46] esta Khaleesi I said because if caleb is
[1:03:48] running the church the way he thinks for
[1:03:50] kids in America live is that Korean
[1:03:51] League lacy ostomies indignation feel
[1:03:53] sorry for all of you
[1:03:54] miss Ito multiple coronal face I say it
[1:03:59] again I feel sorry for all of you
[1:04:00] momentum is being deceived
[1:04:04] stancine yeah so now if it's the Holy
[1:04:06] Spirit or a Csilla speedy - that is
[1:04:08] guiding and rolling the church
[1:04:11] no ego burn and what we're looking to is
[1:04:13] the Lucas caboose can now now now notice
[1:04:16] this now Auto survey nice
[1:04:17] I got a kick out of the the brother
[1:04:19] there for the changing Lamanna cheese we
[1:04:21] were as we were there in in the seminar
[1:04:24] of the pastor seminar that was making a
[1:04:27] point just I was in the Punto and I said
[1:04:30] y-you don't brother brothers I was
[1:04:32] speaking to two to three men the other
[1:04:34] day and I said I told him I don't trust
[1:04:38] you and I don't trust you and I don't
[1:04:39] trust you your lady here
[1:04:41] your lady here use no community no
[1:04:44] confidence in our Co and and I said but
[1:04:46] I do trust the Holy Spirit in you and in
[1:04:47] you and in you he it'll he come fearless
[1:04:50] be a dream and a brother who started at
[1:04:53] the end was started they were singing a
[1:04:55] song and by he just started on his
[1:05:01] making making up his own version yes
[1:05:04] love him I don't trust you know this and
[1:05:10] I don't trust your neighbor and then he
[1:05:14] goes on and says but what I do trust is
[1:05:18] the spirit in you anyway we got a song
[1:05:22] out of that that's the truth of the
[1:05:25] matter but in beans we failed each other
[1:05:30] but I want to always remember okay look
[1:05:33] they seemed pretty quick for us to
[1:05:34] always realize that what we rely on can
[1:05:38] locate wholly we honor that bringing
[1:05:40] forth the words in ideas and a bra and a
[1:05:43] balance to the world
[1:05:44] again don't balance el Piloto on one
[1:05:46] side and unloved now watch this now say
[1:05:48] based on one side and unless you have
[1:05:51] you have what we would call the ministry
[1:05:56] didn't move locate look at yes a.m. I'll
[1:05:59] be steady you understand we go back to
[1:06:02] 325 AD when that spirit of Nicolay and
[1:06:06] began to move what do they do somewhere
[1:06:09] see it set up a Pope a holy man above
[1:06:12] everybody right push it rumba own
[1:06:14] hombres a necklace or at all so then
[1:06:16] through the years the influence of that
[1:06:18] little mule influence it has been great
[1:06:21] I still gonna do sir and that's why in a
[1:06:23] church but it's just
[1:06:24] Alicia you find pastors many times
[1:06:27] cincuenta pastors ministers many times
[1:06:29] in easter business
[1:06:31] i am the leader of the church yes really
[1:06:34] do what I say or you're gonna go to hell
[1:06:36] who stares hello can you do a selfie
[1:06:38] right now I want you to I want you to
[1:06:40] understand because it's real it happens
[1:06:42] but you know cantina pork is real these
[1:06:44] man is too so look at the people and
[1:06:47] shove him down so low they put in a hill
[1:06:49] I was pulling Tombaugh so that they can
[1:06:51] step on them and be greater but I can
[1:06:53] see pamper our soul a juicy sermon you
[1:06:55] see you you understand me if you been
[1:06:57] around you've been to another church of
[1:06:58] you you understand that they're gonna
[1:07:00] senegalese you see that with this when
[1:07:01] you get a Manson you do what I say well
[1:07:03] 15 who nobody can say okay I guess I'll
[1:07:05] look for you that's fine but make sure
[1:07:07] you're on the word oh it's time yeah so
[1:07:10] you have then then this this aura about
[1:07:13] the ministries many times I see the 13
[1:07:15] Easter Easter when I talk I'm talking in
[1:07:18] general okay mr. Allen and so you have
[1:07:20] this that this the minister thinks that
[1:07:22] he is somebody so far greater than than
[1:07:24] the church I mean is rupees a case I got
[1:07:27] a grand mal to really listen then then
[1:07:29] he conquers the laity conquista like oh
[1:07:32] then the people in the church you gonna
[1:07:34] hit a legless yeah then they feel like
[1:07:36] their lesser and thinkest and so
[1:07:39] no then they look at the ministry and
[1:07:41] they say oh he's a great man oh is this
[1:07:44] Rambla Gandhi are you with me
[1:07:46] thank amigo but then after something
[1:07:48] happens to one of these men bitter
[1:07:49] asparagus to say again they saw somebody
[1:07:51] something happens or they fall or
[1:07:53] something might happen I mean it's like
[1:07:54] I know I go oh my goodness is it all but
[1:07:57] yeah now the problem with that or

[1:08:07] one standard material ministerio a
[1:08:10] lunesta dirty and they hold themselves

[1:59:21] Bible come on Stanley the order of the
[1:59:24] Bible and that's the sovereignty of the
[1:59:26] local church this already gives you look
[1:59:29] at he doesn't say that's the sovereignty
[1:59:30] of the local ministry Louise Achilles or
[1:59:32] any little me that local sovereignty of
[1:59:35] the local church is an authority against
[1:59:37] our pastor is the hair Hill pastoral
[1:59:40] acosta
[1:59:40] many like your watch mucho gusto nice

[2:00:13] busy appraiser
[2:00:13] now watch is now or a little bit when we
[2:00:16] look into this from the minimal sense of
[2:00:17] Holy Spirit in the church he certainly
[2:00:19] gets that is sovereign just throw it on
[2:00:21] not just the pastors all I mean till
[2:00:23] past or but that's where the problems
[2:00:25] start in the church they do I either the
[2:00:27] community said program in English when
[2:00:29] they put everything on the pastor only
[2:00:31] those who are the Deacons yeah or the
[2:00:33] ministry and usually when you do
[2:00:35] something like that you don't need to go
[2:00:36] upstairs edgewise I'm Anita you cut the
[2:00:38] power
[2:00:39] who's the chorus line line de la linea
[2:00:41] your life prove it I'm gonna drive this
