[36:22] chapter 19 and verse 9 of first kings
[36:32] unto a cave and lodged there and behold
[36:36] the word of the lord came to him
[36:39] and he said unto him
[36:52] yes
[36:59] lord jesus senor jesus we are
[37:03] happy to be in your house tonight
[37:11] to come and say some things
[37:15] great things of that you've left us
[38:01] we ask father a special prayer lord for
[38:03] our founding pastor
[38:05] especially that you will bless him
[38:10] bless brother william that is taking
[38:11] care of him
[38:14] and all the nurses and the doctors
[38:30] and give
[38:42] i was telling brother jimmy i'm going to
[38:43] try to do something that i probably
[38:45] doesn't account
[38:46] to but i'm trying to do a little bit
[38:47] something different
[38:54] now we we we see the story here
[38:58] of elijah
[39:07] many many times i and i say myself
[39:12] when i speak about elijah you speak
[39:14] about fire
[39:18] you speak about a man of the wilderness
[39:23] man that's not afraid of nothing
[39:41] you find in this portion of scripture
[39:44] yes elijah had already defeated 450
[39:49] prophets of the of of the so-called god
[39:53] baal uh
[39:58] and he had put them all to the sword and
[40:01] they
[40:01] he had killed all of them
[40:06] and as he did that
[41:09] finally he goes out and one two three
[41:11] four five six seven
[41:13] times
[41:17] and the seventh time he sees uh
[41:20] that there is the cloud the size
[41:23] of a man's hand
[41:29] then in chapter 19
[41:32] he's
[41:59] and this is where we find the story
[42:02] tonight
[42:05] he came into the cave lodged there
[42:10] and the word of the lord meets him there
[42:12] you know
[42:15] and he tells them what are you doing
[42:18] here
[42:18] he said and he said i have been
[42:23] very jealous for the lord god of hosts
[42:52] you ever find yourself that way
[42:56] you'll usually find yourself that way in
[42:59] your cave
[43:02] you'll find yourself when you're by
[43:05] yourself
[43:08] in your cave and god you hear the
[43:14] [Music]
[43:18] we ourselves have seen the mighty hand
[43:21] of god
[43:40] and if you ever want to be on your own
[43:44] go find a cave where you can dwell in
[43:46] buy a bus
[43:48] where you dwell in aid is only going to
[43:52] teach you one thing
[43:59] and instead of doing the miraculous for
[44:01] god and
[44:04] we get depressed and we start
[44:06] complaining to god
[44:11] and they're seeking my life
[44:15] and i'm the only monster that's the word
[44:17] of the lord tonight
[44:20] are you doing
[44:33] are you doing here
[45:01] can i tell you what brother branham says
[45:13] [Applause]
[46:27] in this fire yes now i want you to
[46:30] notice
[46:31] he sees all the supernatural miracles
[46:38] because god was not in the fire
[47:06] have you ever heard the sunrise
[47:14] nobody not in
[47:17] have you ever heard do fall asleep
[47:26] you know we've seen firefall
[47:30] you know i have seen paralytics
[47:34] walk god
[47:47] that in order to be able to develop a
[48:27] when god speaks to you
[48:30] don't do this naga says no i want to see
[48:33] a fire oh yo
[48:34] yo i need to see an earthquake
[48:38] i really want to see the wind come into
[48:41] the church and do this
[48:44] i want to speak in tongues
[48:58] but how about staying quiet with the
[49:00] lord
[49:04] and you raise your hands i say lord i
[49:07] want to rededicate my life
[49:12] i want him to become become my friend
[49:17] you won't feel you will might you won't
[49:20] feel the
[49:20] impact of an earthquake
[49:24] this is what brother branham talked to
[49:25] the man about yesterday
[49:47] he said do you love the lord jesus with
[49:50] all your heart

[51:17] the same question that god asked elijah
[52:02] 7 english vietnamese that have not
[52:06] bowed their knees now
[52:09] we are cells nosotros means coming to
[52:12] the understanding
[52:16] brother he sees
[52:20] in chapter 18 the the hand the size of a
[52:23] man's hand
[52:24] and capitalism
[52:28] listen did you ever think what the
[52:31] offices of the
[52:32] church is
[52:37] and when you need something
[52:40] to every person
[52:43] except the office
[52:47] and what do you think brother okay
[52:49] stewart what do you think sisters
[52:52] dude there is no office you know
[52:55] that is open for any problems
[53:26] we have gonna come accustomed
[53:32] that unless we see um
[53:35] we don't believe no cremos we have gum
[53:38] come accustomed
[54:11] [Applause]
[54:22] because
[54:50] is
[55:01] as we heard this morning
[55:21] and he says moreover the lord spake unto
[55:23] moses saying
[55:28] take thou also unto the principle spices
[55:35] and it speaks about five principal
[55:38] spices
[55:43] don't look too much into it no not that
[55:45] here's my word right now
[55:46] no no no you can read this when you get
[55:48] home
[55:50] five principal spices
[55:53] cinco species principal and it gives you
[55:56] the quantity
[55:59] to put into this anointing oil
[56:06] and you say i just need olive oil to
[56:09] anoint me
[56:11] olive oil now with that that's one spice
[56:14] yes
[56:26] it doesn't matter the oil that you use
[57:21] [Applause]
[57:24] and when you go to us and you start
[57:27] saying
[57:29] it always gives it also gives you the
[57:31] amount
[57:32] [Music]
[57:35] kind of looks like ephesians 4 11 and
[57:39] 12.
[57:43] god has set first in the church
[57:50] complainers murmurs
[58:04] you can complain about anything you
[58:06] wanna
[58:17] [Music]
[58:17] [Applause]
[58:19] and he gives you the quantity of that
[58:22] person
[58:25] if you look in the book of romans
[58:28] romano's those are nine
[58:29] spiritual gifts that are given to men
[58:48] god
[59:43] i can get it on all my own
[59:47] moreover the lord spake unto moses
[59:56] it's speaking about anointing
[1:00:12] calamus and it keeps on going
[1:00:17] and it talks about the anointing oil i
[1:00:20] talked about the olive oil
[1:00:26] without these five ingredients
[1:00:29] you cannot be properly anointed
[1:00:33] that's why you hear brother branham say
[1:00:35] one thing oh yes
[1:00:38] and you get and you repeat something
[1:00:40] different
[1:00:43] you know why because you're not anointed
[1:00:46] correctly
[1:00:51] or the king or reign or the congregation
[1:00:55] anointed correctly with the word
[1:00:59] the word says this is not set in the
[1:01:02] church it's just personal in regulation
[1:01:04] and you stand up
[1:01:05] to the point against the people with the
[1:01:07] anointing oil
[1:01:33] how many are afraid of a mosquito pontos
[1:01:54] and i'm not talking about baby shark doo
[1:01:56] doo doo doo doo doo doo
[1:01:58] doo doo baby sir i'm talking about
[1:02:00] sharks
[1:02:03] you're afraid of sharks one two
[1:02:07] three four five okay but little third
[1:02:10] the rest don't know if they're afraid of
[1:02:11] targets
[1:02:13] right do you know on an average year
[1:02:17] a new annual
[1:02:27] you know in the average year
[1:02:30] in the last hundred years
[1:02:47] but we're not afraid to go and do the
[1:02:49] sins of him
[1:02:53] because they're the mosquito
[1:02:56] and the mosquito is a little bitty dude
[1:03:00] and you're
[1:03:14] any place
[1:03:24] you know i i just don't know about that
[1:03:28] brother
[1:03:30] and you know that brother did me oh i
[1:03:33] said man
[1:03:34] and you know i'm going to stop going

[1:03:42] that's it you know you know you know
[1:03:44] what you know what
[1:03:45] what in so many words in encounters
[1:03:48] the catholics say about protestants
[1:03:52] they say the protestants say that we are
[1:03:55] the great
[1:03:58] we are the prostitute the great
[1:04:00] prostitute
[1:04:02] he says you see protestants jumping from
[1:04:05] church to church to church to church
[1:04:10] we say
[1:04:18] people jump from church to church like
[1:04:21] they don't know
[1:04:22] where they belong to them
[1:04:38] gave
[1:05:45] what god wants from you look at your
[1:05:47] schedule is a surrendered
[1:06:02] maybe you don't take it from him but you
[1:06:04] maybe you don't take it from me either
[1:06:08] but you're friends from the world no
[1:06:11] good
[1:06:13] all they are doing is sucking your life
[1:06:15] no casting is stupid to be there all
[1:06:17] they want is what
[1:06:18] you have get to look into genius but
[1:06:20] they don't want to take that to the
[1:06:21] promised land
[1:06:24] i don't want you to have it they want to
[1:06:27] take it away from you
[1:06:28] they want to give you another fire
[1:06:44] you're my friend
[1:06:50] if you're hanging around with people
[1:06:51] that do not come here
[1:06:56] you are you are just hanging around with
[1:06:58] suckers
[1:07:25] cause all of humanity to fail
[1:07:30] and instead of converting him
[1:07:34] he converted
[1:07:38] this is why we don't have no strength
[1:07:52] i come to church that if i don't have
[1:07:54] strength he gives it to me
[1:07:58] after every day after ever
[1:08:02] you know why there's no relationship
[1:08:07] and without a relationship
[1:08:27] the bible speaks to us that they are the
[1:08:30] little
[1:08:31] foxes that spoil the violence
