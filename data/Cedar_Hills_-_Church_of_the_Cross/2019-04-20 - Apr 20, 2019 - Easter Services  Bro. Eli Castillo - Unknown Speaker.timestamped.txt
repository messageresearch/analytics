[1:46:45] [Music]
[1:47:02] I know breath he gave as heaven looked
[1:47:07] away the Son of God was laid in da
[1:47:16] a battle in

[1:48:44] [Music]
[1:49:05] [Applause]
[1:49:07] [Music]
[1:49:21] there are words you see my brain has not
[1:49:27] yet reached a point where the former
[1:49:30] thought I could adequately describe the
[1:49:32] greatness of my god and my lungs have
[1:49:36] not yet developed the ability to breathe
[1:49:40] with enough agility to breathe out the
[1:49:43] greatness of this boat in my voice you
[1:49:49] see my voice so inhibited restrained by
[1:49:53] human limits that it's hard even send a
[1:49:56] person you see if their words
[1:49:59] [Music]
[1:50:05] his praises remarkable mercies are
[1:50:10] strength is impenetrable he is honorable
[1:50:14] accountable favorable he's unsearchable
[1:50:18] yet knowable indefinable yet
[1:50:21] approachable indescribable yet person he
[1:50:26] is beyond comprehension further than
[1:50:29] imagination concept in generations king
[1:50:32] of every nation but if their words for
[1:50:35] him
[1:50:38] you see my words are fuel and trying to
[1:50:43] capture the one true God
[1:50:45] using my vocabulary would never do but I
[1:50:48] use words as an expression an expression
[1:50:51] of worship to a savior a savior who was
[1:50:55] both worthy and deserving of my praise
[1:50:58] so I use words my heart expose the Lord
[1:51:03] blesses his name forever he has won my
[1:51:06] heart captured my mind and bound them
[1:51:09] both together he has defeated me in my
[1:51:13] rebellion conquered me and my sin he is
[1:51:17] welcomed me into his presence and
[1:51:20] completely invited me in he has made
[1:51:23] himself the object of my sight flooding
[1:51:26] me with mercies in the morning and
[1:51:28] drowning me with grace in the night but
[1:51:33] if there are words
[1:51:35] I don't have them for my god but what I
[1:51:41] do have is good news for my God knew
[1:51:45] that man-made words would never do these
[1:51:48] words are just tools tools that we use
[1:51:51] to express the one true God so he said
[1:51:56] his son Jesus Christ as the word living
[1:52:00] proof he is the image of the invisible
[1:52:03] God the firstborn of all creation for by
[1:52:07] him all things were created giving
[1:52:09] nothingness formation and by his word he
[1:52:13] sustains in the power of his name for
[1:52:16] he's before all things and above all
[1:52:18] things he reigns
[1:52:19] so praised him for his life
[1:52:22] [Music]
[1:52:28] the way he persevered in strife the
[1:52:31] humble son of God becoming the perfect
[1:52:33] sacrifice praising for his death
[1:52:36] [Music]
[1:52:41] that he willingly stood in our place
[1:52:43] that he lovingly endured the grave that
[1:52:46] he battled our enemy and on the third
[1:52:49] day a rose in victory he is everything
[1:52:53] that is promised praise him as the risen
[1:52:56] King lift your voice and sing for one
[1:52:59] day one day he will return for us to
[1:53:03] dwell with him for eternity for eternity
[1:53:08] so it's not just words that I proclaim
[1:53:13] for my words point to be word and the
[1:53:17] word has a name hope president
[1:53:22] joy has been
[1:53:24] this has a name love has a name and that
[1:53:30] name is Jesus Christ praise His name
[1:53:33] forever

[2:04:26] simply an outer expression of something
[2:04:29] that's going on on the inside and then
[2:04:31] when he comes that day and he baptizes
[2:04:33] you with His Holy Spirit by one spirit
[2:04:37] are we baptized into that body the Bible
[2:04:39] says so we start here men and brethren
