[17:31] you may be seated
[17:33] you maybe see it it's such a privilege
[17:35] to be here I am a man sent from God a
[17:41] man sent from God and I want to see if
[17:46] you guys can guess who I am so I'll give
[17:50] you a hint
[17:51] I'm uh I'm a character from the Old
[17:52] Testament kind of the Old Testament
[17:59] clothes clothes I think we all have
[18:02] beards back dance solid they all look
[18:03] the same but uh okay little bit after
[18:07] Moses Hughes maybe he was one of the
[18:10] judges and God called him to be a mighty
[18:16] man of Valor mighty man availeth Joshua
[18:22] you were close someone said it in the
[18:24] back
[18:25] say it again no it starts with a G up
[18:31] I'm al parents
[18:36] oh you're wrong okay I am Gideon and I
[18:41] am a man sent from God you know back in
[18:44] my time it was hard let me come down
[18:47] talk to you during my day it was pretty
[18:52] rough you know why because the children
[18:56] of Israel they were like the world like
[18:58] this today the children of Israel they
[19:01] turned their back on God they decided
[19:05] hey I got a better idea I want to get a
[19:06] another God so they adopted a god named
[19:09] veil which is not so there's a there's a
[19:14] commandment right says thou shalt have
[19:15] no other gods before me and they were
[19:16] doing the opposite so God what God did
[19:19] he sent in some Midianites he sent in
[19:23] the Midianites and what they did is they
[19:26] were like grasshoppers they were
[19:28] everywhere come on boys come help him
[19:30] out come on hop I'm out there a grass
[19:32] life they were every a Michael Ben and
[19:40] they were Scotty just plundered villages
[19:42] left things around you know hey Scott
[19:45] this is my food for winter
[19:49] hey and so they would come through the
[19:53] VIP and they would take more than just
[19:55] little fruit they would take cattle hey
[19:59] what's going take they would take the
[20:02] joy that I have with the lure you know
[20:05] they like the devil when he comes you
[20:07] young kids in school right does anybody
[20:10] have a hard time in life or school or
[20:12] yeah
[20:14] what do you struggle with brother okay I
[20:17] can't help you there but anyways just
[20:21] like the world
[20:22] what do you struggle with maybe with
[20:27] kids at school that make fun of you
[20:28] right maybe they fool you
[20:29] does anybody get bullied yeah yeah my
[20:33] brothers would bully me all the time you
[20:36] can't cry about it
[20:37] but just like just like the Midianites
[20:40] would come they would bully the children
[20:41] of Israel why because they chose the
[20:44] Israelites chose you serve a different
[20:47] God so God says fine
[20:49] I'll teach you a lesson so they did this
[20:51] for about seven years seven years kind
[20:55] of a long time so they're Gideon is kind
[20:57] of sick of it you know someone was sick
[20:59] of it some of are sticking to their gods
[21:01] and so here comes Gideon and one day
[21:04] there's a man that meant it Madame
[21:06] underneath an oak tree it was an angel
[21:10] I met him from an oak tree here's my
[21:13] angel come in the Lord is with thee thou
[21:18] mighty man of Valor
[21:19] o Lord if you're with us then we're bein
[21:24] Thal your miracles you know we know you
[21:26] Lord we know we knew God that came and
[21:29] you brought it the children out of
[21:30] Israel or out of Egypt Egypt was the
[21:33] mightiest nation on the earth and God
[21:35] did that where be you go in this thy
[21:40] might and thou shalt save Israel from
[21:43] the hands of the Midianites have not i
[21:45] sent thee said o my lord but i am poor
[21:50] I'm the poorest family Manasseh and in
[21:53] my father's house I was the least surely
[21:58] I'll be with thee and thou shalt smite
[22:00] the Midianites as one man Oh Lord if I
[22:04] found grace in thy sight let it be that
[22:07] I can bring a present for thee so here
[22:10] comes here I get in I went and I made a
[22:14] kit of cake cakes prepared a kid for
[22:17] this for this angel and it knows that
[22:19] the angel at the time and so I came in I
[22:20] and I I brought it to the angel and he
[22:26] told me to place it upon this rock
[22:27] because they asked him ask the angels
[22:30] prove to me that you're from the Lord so
[22:32] he told me to place it on this rock and
[22:34] there on the rock the angel put his
[22:38] staff and the and the the offering burnt
[22:42] up and was consumed this man is from the
[22:48] Lord take the flesh and the unleavened
[22:53] cakes and lay them upon this rock and
[22:55] pour out the broth so that's what I did
[23:01] so now so sounds funny right so I just
[23:06] wanted a sign from the Lord okay
[23:08] Gideon's got it no hey this guy's not
[23:10] just pulling him around alright cuz I've
[23:12] been messed around by a bunch of these
[23:14] guys over here so I got to make sure you
[23:16] know so the so the angel the Lord is
[23:19] commissioning Gideon to go out and save
[23:24] the Lord is commissioning Gideon to go
[23:26] out and save his people right and his
[23:30] people don't want to even be saved they
[23:32] want to turn to bail and so what a
[23:34] Gideon did God said don't be afraid so
[23:37] he goes to this big ol statue of bail
[23:39] and he takes it and he tears it all down
[23:42] and then he takes his father's his
[23:45] father's animals and offers it as a
[23:47] burnt offering to the Lord and so what
[23:49] do you find in the morning that the
[23:51] people of the city are mad
[23:53] they're super mad they're like hey would
[23:55] you do to my statue what you do to my
[23:57] xbox I loved it
[23:58] why'd you take it away from me but
[24:01] Gideon was happy because he said because
[24:03] before you could do anything before the
[24:05] Lord could use them you got to take all
[24:07] the garbage out all right you got to
[24:09] take all the garbage whatever that's not
[24:12] of the Lord that's talking back to your
[24:14] parents
[24:15] it likes to talk back to their parents
[24:19] hey I won't look

[26:37] then all the Israelites will go a think
[26:39] oh I did it check out check what I did
[26:41] God has nothing to do with me beating
[26:45] the enemy so sometimes Christians think
[26:47] that right God gives you a blessing and
[26:50] then you you're like oh God didn't do
[26:51] that I do that yeah so think guys like
[26:54] okay we'll see we'll see how you feel

[27:37] like uh we still we still the vision
[27:39] isn't complete yet this is not what I
[27:41] saw so let's go to the let's go to the
[27:45] stream follow me let's go to the stream

[29:06] was confused
[29:07] Lord we started off with 32,000 why are
[29:10] we down to 300 you know why God did that
[29:13] so he could show his greatness to Israel
[29:16] so I can show him who was God right who
[29:21] was the greatest God on the universe not
[29:23] BHEL BHEL got knocked down by a man and
[29:26] didn't do anything about it cuz he's not
[29:28] real but God wanted a show man look you
[29:33] still are the apple of my eye still love
[29:35] you you still are my people
[29:36] you started the children of God let me
[29:39] show you what with me we can do so here
[29:42] we come here we come come on in the same
[29:47] come on this I and here we find
[29:53] the Midianites so you guys count there
[29:59] and before they went to battle Gideon
[30:04] said I need another sign from You Lord
[30:06] I need another sign from you so what he
[30:08] did he said lord if there be when I wake
[30:13] up in the morning if there be doo doo if
[30:16] there would be some rain some water
[30:17] droplets on this on this fleece if I
[30:20] have it here on the ground or give me a
[30:23] sign that you that I know you're with me
[30:25] that you given me the confidence and if
[30:27] there be do on on the fleece and the
[30:30] ground be dry I know that you have sent
[30:32] me so I woke up again that morning and
[30:35] sure enough the Lord never fails because
[30:38] the Lord miracles are not dead okay the
[30:42] days of miracles are not past I come to
[30:44] tell you I don't know if anybody else
[30:46] believes that but it sure happens so
[30:49] alright so the miracle happened but then
[30:55] I said Lord just one more sign or don't
[30:56] don't be angry with me one more sign so
[30:59] I can have my confidence with you I
[31:00] asked in the morning that if if that we
[31:04] do on the ground but the mic police will
[31:06] be dry then I know you truly has sent me
[31:10] so I woke up in the morning and sure
[31:14] enough the ground was sopping wet and I
[31:17] greet and my fleece was dry wow what
[31:21] confidence that the Lord had in me and
[31:23] now the Lord always had the confidence
[31:26] in me who knows that the Lord has
[31:29] confidence in you does anybody here you
[31:32] know sometimes we think or maybe maybe
[31:34] it's just me you know the Lord is like
[31:37] hey you can do this son I called you to
[31:39] do this and he's called you you people
[31:41] to serve Him and a lot of times were
[31:43] like no Lord you don't know what you
[31:46] don't know what I've gone through the
[31:47] Lord and he's like I actually do know
[31:50] what you gone through and so but he says
[31:53] that's why I have the confidence you
[31:54] because I know what choices you would
[31:55] make I know that you would choose to
[31:57] believe in me
[31:58] and so that's what I did the Lord had
[32:01] faith in me so I had faith in him so
[32:04] it's time to get the devil out right
[32:06] we had the Midianites common many nights
[32:09] come over here and you guys can camp
[32:10] around here so what the Lord told me all
[32:16] these Warriors were trained had swords
[32:19] big weapons but the Lord told me and I
[32:22] don't have any trumpets but this is my
[32:24] trumpet and I am my men I gave every man
[32:27] a trumpet the trumpet that we used you
[32:30] guys can kind of like sit down in the
[32:32] middle the trumpet thought we use what's
[32:34] called a shofar shofar and it was like a
[32:38] either sheeps horn around sworn I got a
[32:40] pronghorn sheep horn so we're close
[32:44] we're close but uh he gave every man a
[32:47] horn and he give every man a pitcher it
[32:52] was like a little pop okay like a clay
[32:54] pot and he also gave him a torch with an
[32:56] inside another clay pot and he said I

[34:12] what the Lord told me to do and there
[34:14] were thousands of them everywhere a huge

[34:26] and the trumpet sounded a sword of the
[34:31] Lord and of Gideon a throne of the Lord
[34:34] and of Gideon a sword of the Lord and
[34:38] the Gideon you guys were scared and here
[34:42] the Midianites were confused they were
[34:45] so confused they started to fight him
[34:46] against themselves you guys can fight
[34:49] against yourself do it with honesty they
[34:54] were fighting against themselves they
[34:55] didn't know the Israelites didn't even
[34:57] touch him and here they come come over
[34:59] here guys come over here guys and
[35:04] they're running don't run foot and they
[35:09] were scared so then we chased him we hit
[35:11] him and they start running off and they
[35:14] were scared because they thought that
[35:15] every but there was about a billion of
[35:16] us coming after them get on or out of
[35:19] there devil and so that's what you got
[35:22] to do sort of the Lord and of Gideon
[35:25] thank you gentlemen can you all say it a
[35:29] sort of the Lord and of Gideon thorn of
[35:32] the Lord and of Gideon thank you
[35:36] gentlemen
[35:38] [Applause]
[35:44] you know what was amazing to me I've
[35:46] I've heard this story and hopefully I
[35:48] made sense to you all but what I saw is
[35:52] that you can kick the devil out anytime
[35:55] you want I don't know if you heard me
[35:58] you can kick the devil out anytime you
[36:00] want
[36:00] if you're feeling discouraged in your
[36:03] condition and say hey maybe you get
[36:05] picked on as a bully from school I don't
[36:07] know maybe that boy is the devil maybe
[36:10] it was the Midianites
[36:11] maybe it's your boss at your job maybe
[36:14] it's maybe one of your friends that is
[36:16] telling you to turn away from God and do
[36:18] bad things I don't know but what you
[36:22] need to do is is this they would use the
[36:24] shofar the shofar was a trumpet it was
[36:29] the Word of God and what it would have
[36:31] used to it would it sound
[36:33] symbolised it was this it would have
[36:37] symbolized the awakening of slumbering
[36:39] Souls I don't know if there's any so
[36:42] slumbering here that are sleeping that
[36:45] are dead that are dormant dirty souls
[36:49] that are like that year no okay good
[36:51] good I'm glad but if what it would do is
[36:54] awaken somebody's souls and give you
[36:56] courage and also it was meant to chase
[36:59] the devil away so in every what aspect
[37:03] of your life young kids you have the
[37:08] greatest weapon that our our pastor the
[37:11] ministers have that God has ever given
[37:14] us and that is his word and if the
