right now we had ourselves a great time in the lord last night but this is the promise of the lord jesus this is christ the book of psalms and and and here david david is receiving the great inspiration receiving the grand inspiration what would happen hundreds and hundreds of years later whosoever there was a man that claimed to be god's own son he was not one of god's son he was the only begotten name and i want you to know that he died on friday today is saturday oh yes he was buried on and he was entombed the scripture is what kept him in the grave there was nothing else that could keep him in the graveyard he was crucified on friday but there was others that were there that were waiting until the blood of bulls and goats would be done away from the blood of god himself i and when the scripture turned him loose this was the first time from when he was the worst he was actually free yeah because he was the eternal one but i will not leave my holy he overcame supplications [Music] to him i was able to save him from death and it was heard that he feared whatever you're going through you might be looking at a time of your life where it seems like all is lost but let me tell you the comment is the word of god still has the answer far away started going into the places the regions and when satan thought he had him when satan thought he had it i'm gonna tell you again he was buried in a borrowed tomb many people say he was very poor yes he was very poor but why would he have to brother mike buy a [Music] [Applause] have [Applause] again he will have a bride where is he and understand all right for if we be dead with him we shall also live with him if we suffer jesus we shall also reign with him there's a word [Music] tonight [Music] you in the middle of your heart [Music] [Music] where's my [Music] [Music] [Music] you in the middle of the heart [Music] oh i will rescue you [Applause] not expecting much out of today but here we have our
