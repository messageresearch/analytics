because many times it's easy to go one direction as we fancy no but there's there's so many facets to this message I'm as fast as ice demands and we we I know it's hard to to cover everything is little good at all but in the angle that we're gonna bring it in we pray that it is a blessing to you perineal Angulo say you better scripture we've been reading second Corinthians the third chapter

some air this morning amen please like this ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all man mr. Curtis we was not roses criticism which was called a soreness of esc later they told us embrace wear as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart siendo manifesto choice led carte escrita Yemen Estrada nosotros eschaton no Contenta mosque on LSP de Dios Bebo knowing Tablas de Piedras you know in Tablas the carnet del corazon amen may God at His blessings to the reading of his word see the recipients entire amen amen makes this statement element around my sister Clara soon and he says LD say scripture has a compound meaning let's get to attending on significant Westone we all know that right we've got that many times scripture-less cateura as a compound meaning hidden significant other words there's more than one meaning to two to each Scripture KCK must k1 significance is key to this is not just one scripture all scripture has come a compound meaning to that and it's it's not just to know sollozzo should be three or four when instead of trace what a man all scripture has a compound meaning though Alaska to the TV significant complicit oh then he also says you know what I mean this a and a compound revelation you now revelation tambien combustor now I will make sure that you understand that before we go aunt is a ciggy cuts against a sink internist all scripture has a compound meaning to ask you to attend a significant Ocampo stone and a compound revelation in a revelation composter if we are the living bible see someone lobelia VV until then each of us are part of that compound nosotros somos but i believe that good morning we're all a part of that compound ness of the meaning and revelation of the word so so most part ii posted a significant revelation when we speak about revival when the blood was there i think many of us can say well ii-i've been in a revival which is why I'm gonna see it Moses town I mean how many here can say I've been in a revival before what does point acid aqui esta la una Y I mean yeah and our mind goes back and maybe at time maybe we had a revival at a camp meeting because unless the mental yeah hey I won't come pimento said we should maybe in special services we had a revival services specialist don't do Bobby banana and and we many times view it as well and an evangelist came by or evangelist was preaching time in put him on citizen pretty Callisto poor he's rich so powerful and and oh we we we all got excited and we were in revival mode EPA cotton tremendo that get toasty mozcon mojitos yet there is so much more to revival than just that there I'm assume us tonight mint okay so that's that's barely not not even just at the top of the of the the whipped cream on top of we'd say super they reviled pastel we talked about revival Alamos they have I mean there is so much more that that goes on yeah mucho mas guitar Qantas in there is something that begins from within it's that good to uh por dentro but I believe that when a revival once again is something that begins from within SN who can pierce up or then throw once again if we go to and we say we were in a revival t1 was these samosas to be Muslim I mean oh and I felt it and I felt this and that he sent es to UK Oh once again it starts from within not from without so means that the adentro know DF whether Isaiah the 57th chapter will be reading a few verses so make I pray that you have your Bibles ready espero que think as really as least us and what did I say I think went I see at the King say and it says this for thus say at the high and lofty one okay see they say allantois oubli me that inhabiteth eternity capital attorney Dan whose name is holy this one obvious Tonto I dwell in the high and holy place a little too recently that with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit he canal camera and tallow you mill de espíritu to revive the spirit of the humble but I said we really split to they're also milled and to revive the heart of the contrite ones EBV Carol Corazon de los cabron now those what a thing that he looks after course I'll look Almeida you know when when we talk about this when the lamb was a stone many times we ask ourselves the question which is the same was a printe III need her or we say when am I gonna get a get revived is it cuando voy a ser mi vida yo and I believe that many here are revived in much of the KIAC rock is not ready how many believe that you've been revived but this can see already Dios but you know when we talk about that rock cuando la is a so why does our spirit and heart need to be revived for canisters pé-de-serra vivido when we go through life sk condo vamos por now there's so many things that happen to us in life i don't ask Oh Sasuke knows a contestant in la vida I'm gonna ever get kicked in the face it seems like in life what Vanessa que la vida let me see this patella Nakara and many times as we as we toil and we struggle mr.

in that pero el amigo sir as well by me so are you with me you go we gotta get all these little bits and pieces once again revival is not to bring in new members who never ment on US trade miembros my boss but revival results is that perilous will totally a mere towing system its to revive what's already in the church okay yes Dinah many here are in the church what was the key stunning iglesia then if you have been revived yes you already wear a revival has come to you means it has activated or revived something that was already there inside of you see captive okay esta men who still if we look

time very simple then comes the cankerworm know what you go what's the homer world in rural tonics Atticus and so forth of the church yes either began to eat out all the life-giving source out of the church from coming circulatory kudos Casey they took away the miracles he says Romero Isaac Camille knows me like that once again revival is not to bring new members into the church I mean understand me remember what revives what was already there we look at yes Hawaii a lot has been eaten by these bugs mucho see the Camino Police toes instead but this is life-giving source that should be in the church does be like it acoustically Glacia when we go through trials and tribulations and God will put up hardships forever see pretty food goes in of Edom it'll either make us or break us knows man knows not safe what this one was care how many of you ever felt like you were broke it's like they just they just take the very life very good but is there a Vedic it seems like when we everything seems to be going okay cuando but it's all about the end we're done and often you just get punched right in the gut again gold penniless tomorrow tomorrow we're all we've all felt that almost empty dough and just when we get a little bit of breathing room in Kakinada and we feel okay it knows that Tim here it comes again ie be any otra vez it either makes you breaks you as if we're to give it up that's why Jesus said say and asked me for you Peter what so kazuko Pedro I have to grade for one thing put on a cosa and that is that your faith doesn't fail you during this time yes okay s que tu fais notify in history you've gotta go through arson but don't let your faith fail you must prairies sk2 feta fy'y it'll either bring a spiritual death but then let this beat well tour I don't want to do nothing no homebase to stay yeah no kid or said I'm done Yaakov a attorney name or it'll revive what lays dormant in US v lo que esta dormido new stairs many times we even forget what is inside of us which I racist a nurse told me that won't look and start in through them we get hit so hard that we get spiritual amnesia no speaka tokenizer numbness yes we forgot who we are then this will be that chemists we forget what we have received through the years okay we're gonna see these overlaps you gotta go back and you gotta make sure that you remember what you have recited it's like you're doing research but other kids look a sido puesto he I remember the story of a man me acuerdo and historian hombre who went to the pasture if well past or he said he wasn't coming to church no more oh yeah no I need a little Asia he said I feel like it's a waste of time skin tokuma kissing a parody that impo he said I've come to church for the last 30 years every needle they support rain Daniels and to tell you the truth pastor but I see the lever that I don't remember not one message you've ever preached know me acuerdo needing good mensaje kept pretty callow the pastor looked at the man and passed on meanwhile hombre he said how many years have you been married cuantos anos tienes cos I've been married 40 years he ho tengo Quentin knows Castle he said and in those 40 years in this was quite a time you can you remember every meal your wife made you wear this to take a plateau kotecha the Camino sposa he says why no no he says then though you may not remember every meal UV and don't cannot take where this take a plateau the communities here on you're alive and healthy today's that's people he said love Leroy because of all those ministers he says and so it is spiritually yes yes is pretty 12 in that we may not remember every message that was ever preached that was a torment but we are alive and well today better stop most people so he said laws of those messages that we have heard a cow Salim in Sec history we have heard from the throne of God it was real then throne Elysian so that our mind might fail us at time don't can mr. Minton is failure this our heart will not fail us mr. Corazon normally our heart has been revived under mr. Clarence is your real a lot say less sure knows before what has been deposited into us but if you look at Co the pasta what has revived us it's okay no sorry vivido but i look at this continue meeting oh what a thing it is for revival cosa is why they have Eva Mentos he said revival is not for new members when I got Minton espera en Bros my boss he said bruh I watched the mighty sea beast old manor-house earned and waves went up and down and and I thought yo mr.

Nacimiento like I said there are so many facets of revival i much as fastest what does it do ok so ok he says it shakes all the trash out of the water onto the bank shallow dia he said that's why the church needs a revival today Elysium is still a memento that we can get all the unbelief shook out of us better that tolling clearly not so we can get all the worldliness out of all the feel that's why we need a revival where there's only thought was who not you've a mentor we gather a lot of things muchas cosas we collect a lot of things on the road we collect that was mucho putting it so I
