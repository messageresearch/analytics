their seat this song takes me back to my childhood my mother and my father my grandparents they would always encourage us come to the light come to the light thank God one day came to the all their hard work all their dedication all their consecration was not in vain because here we are today I'm pretty sure that many of you in the room have a an Apostolic background as well amen and uh we remember a lot of these songs and now that my mother and father are gone they have uh transitioned I have to learn to say that they have transitioned to be with the Lord I find myself singing these songs more often so so we can uh uh give get started here please go with me to the book of uh Titus let's start in the book of Titus please want to make myself a note and write the time down I want to stay within the a lotted am of time that and as we're looking for our scripture want to brother Caleb brother Tommy thank you for your confidence and this opportunity to stand behind the sacred pulpit and uh it is truly an honor I'm going to read this the the book of Titus uh chapter 2 verse 13 first and then we're also going to read the book of First Thessalonians the fourth chapter vers 16 and 17 the book of Titus first and thank God that they have it on the screen for me and as we're standing in reverence to the word Paul writes to Titus and he says looking for that blessed hope can somebody say blessed hope amen blessed hope and the Glorious appearance of the great God and our savior Jesus amen you may be seated thank you for your reverence unto the word thank you so much in this verse is where we find the title to our message blessed hope now we want to go to go first 1 Thessalonians 4: 16 17 please first Thessalonians there we go thank you you follow along if you have your scripture you can say amen and before I read this scripture let me ask this question if I may please a few three four months back I asked the young people in the music room how many books in the New Testament they're like oh I'll give you a clue there's 39 in the Old Testament so how many do we have in the new test can you answer that how many 27 do you agree okay we have an agreement now how how many Epistles do we have in the New Testament we just read from one of those Epistles amen we just read from one of those Epistles Paul writing to Titus someone else's mail yes we are we can learn something by reading somebody else's mail now if 21 Epistles the Apostle Paul receives credit for writing how many I hope we can learn a little bit something today or or take something take something with us and later on when you're having a conversation with somebody oh you know what brother Jacob said that 21 epist and the Apostle Paul receives credit writing 133 of those so now he's writing to the Thessalonians wrote to them twice amen so chapter 4 verse 16 and 17 and 16 reads in this manner for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first verse 17 please then we shall then we which are alive and remain come on shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord now I want to back up real quickly here before we continue to the book of this Titus and I'm going to reread it again please go back with me to the book of Titus verse 13 looking for that blessed hope okay we're looking for the Blessed hope and it's around the corner Christ is coming for his bride now we need to make emphasis on this the Blessed hope is one event is one event and the second part of it is the Glorious appearing we're going to have the Rapture of the church that's our blessed home we're going home we're going home brother Caleb now I know why you ask sometimes doesn't that exite you doesn't that excite you we're going home going home oh brother Tommy senior's probably like I'm waiting for you brother Bernie probably saying oh Bernie Garcia is probably saying I'm waiting for you I'm waiting for you Christ himself is saying I'm waiting for you we're going home we're going home that is your blessed hope that is our blessed hope if you don't have it you can obtain it tonight you can obtain it tonight don't leave for tomorrow what you can do today quickly typology remember the other night event that represents a spiritual truth you with me good we have three prime examples in the scriptures in the Book of Genesis 5 verse 266 I think I wrote down the wrong scripture please forgive me let me just mention it that's okay we remember the story of Enoch amen amen a man that walked with God and what happened to him he is a type of the church he is a type of the Bride that she's going to walk with God and she's going to disappear she's going to find herself in immediately in that Dimension with God Enoch is a type of the Bride Elijah what happened to Elijah did he see death no no some of us will not see death I love what the Spanish Bible says I had to bring sor I'm so used to this Bible right here surely we shall not all sleep am that's what Paul told the Corinthians surely we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed and a twinkling twinkling High Glory doesn't that excite you are you ready I'm ready I'm ready to go home I'm ready to go home I want to go see my savior right High I want to see my God my father and my mother was saying oh oh I want to see himor where's brother Hector is he with us here tonight there he is oh I want to see his face full of love oh on that great day going to sing glory be to God glory to God we're going home we're going we're going home we're going home we're going going home and again if you don't have this hope you can have it tonight accept Jesus Christ as your personal and if you've been serving God for 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 years your walk with the Lord is not in vain he's coming for you he's coming for you he's coming for you the other example that we have the third example can we read this one please in the Book of Revelations 4 verse 1 and two but the key verse is verse two here's John the Apostle also known as John the Theologian and we uh we tend to think sometimes that someone is alone while they're lonely but sometimes when you're alone God can talk to you John found himself alone in the island of patmas he was probably looking over the waters there's all my brothers at the synagogue praising and worshiping oh there's all the brothers Hills Hills but you know what God came down and revealed himself GL to God and this is what he writes are you with me amen here we go am after this I looked I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said wo come up hither and I will show thee things which must be here after verse two please this is our key verse here and before I read this verse I I I need to I I need to explain something real quick in my English Bible and as you can see up on the screen it uses the word immediately and in Spanish right below it it says I went in spirit see the difference so now let me read it now here's the third example of the church being taken away you ready to be taken away to be ready because it's going to be of an eye and we used to sing another song when we were we were children and I'm sorry I got to go into Spanish again it's just like lightning just like the lightning that's the way the coming of the Lord will be and I was a little kid that's why I was as a little kid singing but now I understand it he's going to come so quickly you're not going to have time to run to Cedar Hills Caleb or call Brother Tommy me he's going to be like a lightning he going to take his church away think about it for a moment just like the lightning that's the coming of the Lord and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven on theone I want to focus on that word immediately just for a second Enoch was taken and immediately in the presence of the Lord Elijah was taken away in the Sherry did not see death right amen right amen you agree with me we're getting it from here praise the Lord love to see them Smiles out there you know I have when they give me a weeks time to prepare make myself sick by getting nervous Lord what I'm in your hands I'm in your hands I don't only play trumpet I want to be a trumpet I want to be a trumpet and my family and my friends are watching going to watch it in the future you don't have the Blessed hope you can have it you can have it cuz God is offering it to you so John the Theologian immediately another type of the church immediately being taken and finding herself in the dimension of God imagine there he is and immediately finds himself in the presence we will immediately find ourselves in the presence going to go from one dimension into another quick amen amen Book of Revelations chapter 20 vers 1-6 key verses verse if you put up verse six for me please the Bible says blessed and holy blessed and holy is he or she that have part in the first resurrection in the Rapture in the taking away of the church you want to participate of that I believe this church is I believe brother Tommy sor brother Caleb brother Tommy and the ministry have prepared the bride I believe it's Paul that talked to to the book in Corinthians as well amen he he has walked the bride down the a believe I believe it's Paul who talks to the Corinthians about he has walked her down the aisle you have walked her down the aisle he's ready he's ready he ready blessed are those blessed are those that participate of the first resurrection that participated that Rapture it's there for you and for me us it's there for us promised each and every one of us amen amen blessed and holy is he that have part in the First Resurrection on such the second death ha no power hallelujah what do we just finish singing you'll no longer what you'll no longer die did we just s that come to the light didn't we just sing that come to the light Jesus says come to the light the second death have no power but they shall be priest of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years we're going to the marriage supper of the Lamb we're going to the marriage supper of the lamb and when somebody knows this I'm just going to mention this scripture Revelations 2 verse 11 22 2211 I'm sorry 221 I can read it's kind of short we're good he that is unjust let him be unjust still yes and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is Holy let him be holy amen amen amen yes knowing this we strive we strive to stay righteous and we're not righteous of our own doing through Christ's righteousness we are right and by his grace and by his grace and we also strive to keep our garments clean we find that verse in Revelation chapter 16 verse 15 no need to put it up we strive to keep our garments clean have a clean cons have a clean conscience amen amen we're going to the marriage supper of the lamb and when we're at the marriage supper of the Lamb well we're at as as the bride is at the marriage supper of the Lamb the tribulation is taking place on and they're running parallel one to another running parallel one to another where do you want to be I know where I want to be I want to be sing and I will with him and he with me glory be to God that's Revelations sorry they just start to pop up Sor this word just runs in my veins brother K sometimes it wakes me up at night just just runs in my veins hallu blessed be the Lord bless glory be to God you with me amen we're going home to the marriage supper of the land and we shall return and we shall return the book of Thessalonians says that we will meet the Lord where in the air in the air when he comes for us he's not going to set his foot on this Earth yet he will call up his children from the four corners of the world north south east and west he's going to pick you up and he's going to take you and I way he going to take us home and we're going to the mar supper of the lord it's going to be a big table h brother big amen I hope I get to sit right next to him right there by the head of the table wow be an honor but if he doesn't long as I'm there long as I'm there long as I'm there sing with my Lord with the Lord of lords and with the King of Kings glory amen amen we will return with him Zechariah Chapter 14 verse please ver and he shall flee to the Valley of the mountains for the Valley of the mountains shall reach unto eel yay ye shall flee like as fled from before the earthquake and in the days of Uzziah king of Judah and the Lord my God shall come he shall come and all the saints with him key word saints Saints you're a saint because you were washed with the Precious Blood of the were washed with the pre it doesn't say His Holy Angels it doesn't say his holy Army zeah says and all the saints we're going to come back with him we're going to return and then if you back up to verse four and I'll just mention it that's when he said to feet on the Mount of Olives he will set his M and it will Parton to then the Book of Matthew chapter 19 he told Peter that he would sit with him and he would judge the 12 tribes of I'm just going to mention it Matthew chapter 19: 27-30 we will sit with him on the throne we're going to return with him why because we have that blessed hope and then we will be with him at the Glorious appearing glory be to God glory be to God once again you don't have that blessed hope you can obtain it tonight you can have it takeen it's yours free that's right and if you've been serving the lord for for 30 40 years press on don't quit he's coming for us he's around the corner and if you just gave your life to Christ and you just got started you're going to have the same reward G to have the same reward amen amen Brothers God bless you tonight brother Ronnie thank you for your help and interpretation brother thank you very much bless you brother it was truly an honor and a blessing to stand up here and uh we have a custom would say that's I say in Spanish again we leave this Pulpit to the direction of the Holy Spirit and to the brother that who it corresponds to we leave this to the Holy Spirit they they come and to the brother to whom it corresponds to Lord touch his lips as well we have a blessed hope bless you this evening bless our brother this evening bless his [Music] word how many love God how many love God so if you love God you love your brother right greet your brother that is next to you as you stand to your feet and we're going to turn to our scriptures we thank God for this day for this opportunity we thank our pastor for the trust the confidence and may the Lord bless each one of you want to also give thanks to God because we have health I believe that if we have God we have everything a long time ago I heard a brother saying this it is hard to stand at a place like this when we see men that have been tested by time as our brother Fabio God bless God bless you brother what could I say when they're here in front of ministers that are here but the only one great is God we're going to enter into the word verse book of Samuel chapter 7 we're going to read a scripture and I want to entitle this thought ebenzer chapter seven of 1 Samuel verse 12 and the word of the Lord reads like this then Samuel took a stone and set it between mpan and Shen and called the name of it ebenzer saying hither too had the Lord helped us may the Lord add the blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated before entering into the word I want to tell you that I'm glad to be here with you and amongst you and we thank our pastor brother brother Caleb for his help and I also want to help Brother Carlos Hill for the help that he has given me God bless you brother he's been very patient with me trust me only he knows the patience that he has had with me and I see say this to relax myself is is it is something important to know it is a small testimony I want to give when I was young I lost my father when I was very young I I don't want to say I lost him he just went home when I was young he met brother brother Tommy Sor there in the 90s the 80s and I was telling this testimony and this testimony gives me life it fills me with joy because we can say with gladness hether to have the Lord helped us being my father sick he lost the the motion of half of his face which was a facial paralysis of course we were all worried we didn't know what to do so we went to church that time brother Tommy senior was was preaching but his way of preaching was so special and I believe that you all knew it he went it it happened the same thing that one time we went when he was preaching he didn't say very uh things in a in a big way and this is the the the part that I want to call your attention to that we call the words by the word we call things into existence by the word nobody told me about it nobody told me about it I was there I saw it when brother Tommy was preaching at half of the preaching he only raised his eyes and he saw a man that was in his wheelchair and he he was preaching and he was saying what can I say about faith what is faith is like if I say if like if I say rise up name of the Lord Jesus Christ and walk and the man after more being more than in a wheelchair he started walking it was half of the service that is the god I want to talk to you about being my father on the balcony and it looked like there wasn't any the doctors had said you have to take a process and because of your condition because he had diabetes they said you might be healed you might not be healed but that's what man said but God is in Mercy when brother tell me Wasing God in flesh God in flesh at half of the preaching he just turned to look at my father and he said demon let him in the name of Lord Jesus Christ and at an instant right away his face it was like if nothing happened my father couldn't even drink a bottle of water when he drank water the water would would come out that was a bad condition my my father said everything is all right and the greatest sign he said give me water he drank water and he finished the bottle glory to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that God that God that we just read he was right in front the people of Israel the people of Israel they had come from a problem that they had had for more than 20 years they were they were subjected under the Dominion of the Philistines and if you can read the the part that is you you can go home and read it you're going to find how they were afraid and they even said to the prophet cry and pray for us but they knew that they had left God then look at the important part a prophet Rises up bring it to the present time us we also have a prophet with God that raises up a stone that raises up re Revelation and and he draws a a path he draws a line between Mis and and Shan and he said the Lord has helped us so far ebenzer now the word until it marks the limit of a time is the final space of a time until the hither to and the question is since when that's when you and I come into the scene bring it to your personal life hether too had the Lord helped us until this day this time this space this moment this season has never left us alone the people of Israel they have forgotten they have forgotten great and glorious Wonders that the Lord has performed the Lord had fought their battle and at this time the people of Israel didn't even to do anything because God with a thunder he's scared he's scared and he defeated the Philistines now that same God with you tonight the same God that scared the Philistines is to defeat the Giants that you have in front of you just with the word St with the word this evening hither to it it means a limit of time now think about it how many how many things has the Lord has the Lord done for us he has done many things for us why are we here for your own strength for your own ability for how good you are never for the of the lord we haven't been consumed because his mercies are new every morning and great is his faithfulness how many can say Amen if the Lord is with us why should we fear but now we have it's our duty it's like the book of Lamentations 3:40 says we're going to read it together let us search Let us look upon upon our ways let us look let us search let us search and turn again to the Lord not to the man not to the person not to the church but to God to God the only one the only one who deserves all honor and Glory all praise honor power and Majesty glory to his name the Lord is worthy the word of God says Revelation 15 verse three great and marvelous thy Work Lord God Almighty doesn't it make you be happy doesn't it make you know that God is with you God is with you why are you suffering why are you worrying everything is in his hands the Bible says let us search and let us turn but there's a way to turn unto the Lord again there's a way you want to know it how many want to know the way it's not all of us how many want to know the way so now it's majority because if we don't have a majority here we cannot go but since we have a majority here let's go to the scripture so the Bible can tell us how we have to search for it and turn to the Lord 2 Chronicles chapter 7 three days ago I was talking to my brother my brother has been going through very difficult times and he was telling me while I'm waiting upon the Lord I said you're a liar because God is waiting for you but then we're making the word a liar the Bible says revelation behold I am I am at the door and I'm knocking I cannot be waiting on God God is waiting for me we're going to see how the Lord is waiting for us 2 Chronicles chapter 7 verse 14 If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves if they shall humble themselves which are called by my name and pray and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways How many things are they four things who can tell me those things humbleness prayer write it down humbleness prayer stick my face and what does it say to turn probably you're already humble and glory to God for that but if you don't add the nothing's going to happen you can pray a lot and that's good GL God for your prayer but don't stop doing it but add the next ingredient look for If my people humble themselves and pray speak my face and turn from the wed way that the most important part God needs of attitude from us you cannot have the same attitude all your life either you love God you love your his people hither tother to to when it says had the Lord helped us what does it mean is plural PL plural and I saw it an apostle Reverend Thomas one of his first visits I was there he started setting everything in order the women were sitting in one place and when we're sitting in other place he said what's happening here this is not good I'm not going to preach like that from now on he said that was the brother Tommy that I knew he said I want the husband and the wife to sitting together why because now now here's my beloved I can see her in her eyes and she's the first can do with someone else now you to fulfill this SC eer hither to at the Lord help us you and me a couple my love the Lord helped us because we are one and what God has joined together let no man cut a sender that is one that is the first person that that you have to say hither to we have been through trials through tribulations through problems for and downs but the Lord has never left us [Applause] alone and then you turn and you tell your children because strong marriages we all know that makes a strong family and strong family that church and a strong Church makes the bride the Living God [Applause] strong can you believe it hither to had the Lord helped us my wife my children and then the church the ministry how many problems have we gone through but God has never left us alone here we are we have a pastor we have a Ministry we have musicians we have deons we have the trust glory to God because God is with his people we're gonna we're advancing up to the third word hither to had the Lord help us help right past tense helped now I want to ask you if it's past tense is that [Music] over then we're going to close the Bible and go home and we turn on Netflix because we don't have a god anymore but if God is the same yesterday it is so important it's the same today healed you healed [Applause] you if God delivered you he still delivers you he chose you to put his name and for you to announce his wonders the glory of the power of each person raise up the name of the Lord up high not the person not the people no God is the only one who deserves honor his hand in his hand in his hand is all the power you want to see the power how many want to see the power no oh it's not yet in his hand in his hand is a power you want to see the power okay okay we're going to see the power how are we going to look for it are we going to look for God humbleness prayer seeking for him and to turn to him that's where well everything was going good me turning myself I cannot leave my ideas I'm good nobody has to tell me anything oh I'm good here somebody to tell me what to do oh you're you're crazy you're not so if you don't pass this part you're not going to be able to see the second one we're going to see the power we're going to be closing with this book of Isaiah we're gonna see Isaiah chapter 12 and then we're goingon to see the other scripture Isaiah chapter 12 that is a commandment for us we already have his glory his miracles and what what is his glory for the Miracles we all have it here is it to hide it under something to keep it here where nobody can see it where nobody can can know about it God healed me but nobody should know that God healed me God saved me well I'm saved but I'm just hiding here so nobody can see it it's for you to tell to Proclaim his glory saved you go with the standard by Grace walk with the ban you were sick now you are healed for the glory of God I believe that all one we have suffered some sickness that sickness hasn't left with medicine it helps but God brings the healing and Isaiah 12 says verse 4 it says and in that day you shall say praise the Lord call upon his name declare his doing among the people is to make known to declare to tell the people his works and then it says make mention that his name is exalted if you don't know it put it to test then only to the name to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Satan trembles take the sword by by the handle and see how Satan he might come with many things and you only need you only need to say I don't have anything but I'm an ambassador and I come in the name which is above all name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the one who defeated you on Calvary and by that name you're going to leave in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's his name exalted 1 Chronicles 2911 1 Chronicles 2911 as you find it the prophet says message Hebrews chapter 4 September 1st 1957 why did God lead the people of is Israel to Bitter Waters looks like he could have led him to a good water but he led him to Bitter Waters so he could prove their faith he likes to do it he likes to let tribulations come upon you to show that he can do it that he can do it tribulation that is in front of you he let it he lets it happen he lets itom but the

testimony all the way from Uganda Uganda says a few days back our daughter Deborah got her both knees dislocated and it was too painful for her the doctors told her the only option was to do surgery on both knees it was a shock to us and I informed buddy Thomas about it and and I sent our prayer request to our pastor to our pastor Caleb I informed him about the doctor's report and it will take to do the surgery meanwhile when we left the hospital they had promised to give us the final the final invoice to know the total cost or the estimate which was very expensive but somehow when my wife kept calling the doctor she couldn't pick the calls and even reply the messages yeah this made us think of trying another hospital we went to another hospital and met a prominent doctor in our country and he recommended surgery but it was too expensive it was on this day after reaching home I received a call from our pastor Caleb he had never called me since he received the information requesting for the prayer but when he called one thing he told me after narrating everything that we were going through he said brother Julius Julius time has come to believe in Divine Healing our God is the Healer this is what he told me the Lord has always used him to stand with us in many ways whether it needs money but this time surprisingly he he talked of other needs and for Deborah he mentioned nothing about financial help but rather Divine help just after talking to him I got a call from one of my friends and told me of some other Orthopedic Hospital we decided to go there when we were we were the first to meet the doctor and she assessed our daughter and for the first time we heard a statement from the doctor she will not need surgery now we will explore other options first until after six months she said oh you can't imagine the joy we felt in our hearts it was like an angel from the Lord talking to us this doctor we learned later she had come from India two days back coming back home I called Pastor Caleb to tell him what the Lord had done for us then he says well brother Julius I felt led of the Lord not to send money for the surgery I knew the Lord was going to do something and he says if you can believe me your daughter will not need surgery the Lord will make those bones grow right that settled it I have always believed the word from his servant that is the Lord's report we believe now for our daughter who do you say this is glory to God my heart is Overjoyed friends our God is so gracious the great physician he works in wondrous ways for his wonders to to to perform he didn't provide the money because he wanted to stop the surgery he made the doctors in the first hospital we went to not to pick up the calls because he wanted to stop the surgery he made the cost too high in the second hospital because he wanted to stop the surgery and we say right now that the same Lord Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever now their sister Deborah she's singing a song on and you'll see the the greatness of God what he does I thank God for saving me from the surgery of my knes because of your prayers God bless you Pastor khen and all the saints for
