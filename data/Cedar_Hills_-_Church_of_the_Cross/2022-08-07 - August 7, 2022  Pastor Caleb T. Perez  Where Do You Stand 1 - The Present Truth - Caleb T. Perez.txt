station is not good as you can see people are stranded they have lost their loved ones they have lost their properties so hunger and they are sad generally so what we are doing at this time is to grieve with them and support them in the best way possible so starting from tomorrow i will be moving with some church members we want to pray with these people encourage them about the easter eggs how the instance happened so maybe you will not understand the language i'll be the interpreter god bless you so um to begin at exactly 1pm united okay they never knew what was going on but they just discovered that the water has already entered the house so for their life they never knew they were the ladies talking she never knew or not so the only surviving things which was saved in this house was just only children but everything was smashed away from foreign it was the hell it was the help of this boy the way you were seeing him he was the one who saved the day who saved his own his brothers if it wasn't him i think was it wasn't easy this is what you can see this is the closest now which has remained the brothers things is not easy these are the closest we can remain but everything was was it was smashed with water but this is the one which remain and they're not using at all all the beds whatever everything was smashed within the water [Music] now they are not that digesting with the neighbors with the surviving houses they're just keeping them [Music] you made [Music] when our backs were against the wall and it looked as if it was over you [Music] made a way and we're standing here only because you made it away cause you move mountains you cause the walls to fall [Music] [Music] that's impossible and we're standing here only because [Music] when our backs were against the wall [Music] [Music] and we're standing here only because [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Music] miracles [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] over and over [Music] it's a great honor to present these bibles on behalf of pastor kharif and the whole ministry of sydney's church of the cross another sense that work together with the ministry uh it's really a great uh gift to the saints here in uganda and i'm so humbled that i can present these bibles to you they sense love you so much they pray for you and this is the talking of how much they think about you and they they pray for you they long to see in the rupture and one day if some of them you want to meet first offense what a great day to be when they see you they are in the rapture but the word of god that can't take you there so let the sense with the word of god trust god and pray for them always and continue loving the lord jesus christ and let it be known that we are just leaving to serve god and when we meet up there one day that will be god bless you this is a gift from the sense of the lord i will start your death god bless you so much [Music] only because you may [Music] [Applause] amen we're grateful to almighty god for for all that he's done for us thankful that he let us represent him in the country of mexico this last weekend we leave to colombia on thursday i was telling the one of the mexican pastors i said you're you're rich compared to these people of [Music] after you see this video your heart just breaks the videos it would be maybe not much if you didn't know them because many times we get we get hardened towards these videos videos but now that you know them uh it has fallen our lot to take care of them and the simplicity of the gospel is this implicit it is better to give isa god did not have to send forth jesus christ but in order to redeem the world he had too much and the first thing that he did that he in all of this i wanted just to read tell you a testimony i've had the the privilege of the last two months to to be able to speak with with men and i think that maybe me or or maybe people that claim the message in particular in general we always call ourselves non-denominational people nomination denomination and that's not the case yes no brother branham calls this inter-denominational iran coming to know the truth but i've had some of the greatest fellowship with these gentlemen and in them them you find a heart and egg these are businessmen i will not tell you who they are you know this is what is but they are people of a great heart when they found out what we were doing for africa they wanted to be part of it i told them about what god has done in our age i told them we follow the teachings of brother william mary and brandon they asked us what's the how do you you and so many words reconcile christ with what you believe in the understanding of the scripture and what we believe what brother branham was saying a lot of sometimes we come to the place of we have to defend when the word of god needs no defense the word of god is the word of god well we've had some great fellowship with these gentlemen i count them as people of god i i count them as people that that their heart is toward can you imagine people that don't come here but want to do and want to add their grain to what you do and i'm very proud of them very happy for their time that they have shared with us but when they found out we were doing bibles for africa these men got together and donated fifteen hundred dollars for the cause of affirmations [Applause] one of them as he is hearing our our sometimes we we we we believe what we believe is which is the greatest thing that i believe that there is but many times it is very common to us but when they heard the testimonies testimonials the testimonies testimonials of how god brought my father [Music] i testify this to the honor and glory of god he says he says uh i believe he called me tom yamatom he said he said tom i want to tell you after hearing these testimonies testimonials our church doesn't have the holy ghost no stigler not in the spirit to sound you guys do us he said our pastor is a good man he's speaking about his own pastor a good man he's a good preacher and the life is what the message produces so they might not see that a a certain thing of what they would call or you would call the message but if they receive him that i have sent okay they have received the message and so i counsel you today that the word of god will do exactly what it says it will do the problem it will produce according to its own kind of and i want i want to tell you that it's been just nothing but the greatest blessing of myself they don't come and ask me a question for five minutes we spent hours and hours and hours pasamos and then they asked me how much does my east flower cost and so the the what you see in the bags the look at the corn flour and so that to me was outstanding yes that people believe what you believe okay is towards what you believe god bless you and god bless his word this morning [Applause] amen we think for the time before that testimony god bless him and the work he is is doing and has done uh with those gentlemen amen and we thank the lord for that as he told them from the get-go that all i know is what brother branham says there'll be a lot of surprises at the judge i want to start a new series like any other series you know you can go on to the coming of the lord and i was inspired to as i was as i was uh studying this right before i went to mexico the lord began to deal with me on this it may be many things that you have already heard this as we put a foundation to this message today we'll see where the lord takes us on this series the name of the series where do you stand quite a question you know you you hear so much of that today well that's your truth not my truth yes that annoys me how many truths are there but jesus said pero jesus but there is only one the truth malachi the third chapter and the second verse today we have an extensive youth service tonight but we want to get into the word now malachi 3 verse 2 when you have it you can say amen but who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appears or he is like a refiner's fire and like fuller soap orchestra may god add his blessings to the reign of his word you may be seated god bless all the visitors that are here today amen brother jesus god bless you that's his daughter and his and his son there god bless you this morning jesus amen and the different ones that are here god bless you what a thing it is and it's a question who may abide the day of his coming sometimes we may have certain things in our minds we claim that we stand for certain things is that right here can say i you know i stand for something you stand for someone we say i stand for something yo me paro but as we make these claims the question comes back who shall stand when he appears it's easy to say i stand yes but when he appears then the truth is known as manifestation we hear this all the time i'm standing on his word is [Applause] the question then comes when we have good health buena salud a little bit of money few friends amigos good job nice church plenty of food and we can say oh we're really standing on the isle of patmos john had been around jesus we know that jesus had laid there on his chest he had eaten with him but notice that when he was on this isle of patmos the angel that jesus christ said i have sent mine angel he comes to john and begins to tell him about things that are to be he's telling him about the church and his appearing to john was so impactful is that revelations 1 17 all john could say is when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead that's why i say we can act real tough and we we yeah we we've got it together john says when he saw that angel i fell at his feet as dead pero juan condola daniel the eighth chapter daniel capitulo those of you have read this many times this was a vision that daniel had esther daniel and i want to pick it up on the 16th verse if i me and i heard a man's voice between the banks of july which called and said gabriel make this man to understand the vision you know i want you to notice daniel was not sitting down laying down daniel was standing up daniel lost and he he comes there and and verse 17 says so he came near where i stood vino estaba my question once again where do you stand on this thousand daniel was standing here it seems like on the banks of this river but when the angel came to him gabriel the angel we know who it was i believe church that where we are at today maybe this is a different kind of message but it's a message to make us check ourselves there is a reverent fear that is coming so here he says i was afraid and i fell on my face i see daniel here then he couldn't even stand anymore once again where do you stand it goes on to say but he said unto me understand oh son of man for at the time of the end shall be the vision he's telling him he's showing him he's gonna he's gonna he's gonna gonna tell him what this vision means this was a direct command to the angela but do we understand the vision this morning i look into the mirror many times and i say lord i don't understand certain things but when he sends the answer and watch as this unfolds now as he was speaking with me i was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground is [Music] he couldn't i mean just to be in the presence of that angel you you can't you can't handle i can't handle that but when the angel is about to show you something else he's gonna tell you and that means that he put him back on his feet and he's telling lest you fall but when the angel comes and begins to reveal the message the word the vision places you exactly where you need to be and he makes you stand there you want to understand that's my question this morning how many of you want to understand this morning somebody want to understand the and i was sick certain days brother diego that angel that you that you saw is are brother branham passed out when he saw the vision of jesus paul was knocked off his horse are you really ready to receive and to stand in his presence we stand in church and we get the blessings of the lord it's wonderful the blessings are wonderful when his presence comes and you have to give an account everything that you have said everything you have thought look up and everything you have done okay let me tell you you and i would not be able to stand in the presence there is a reverence that god requires a holy god that we're talking it's not about just well i'm going to live any kind of life and then ask for forgiveness when i get to church question is where do you really stand this morning it's everybody always wants to know where do you stand on this issue and age we live what do you what do you think about this what do you think about gay rights what do you think about general gender identity all these things that they politicize but then the question then we come back to them what think ye of christ christ come on now there's there's more than one side to things here you hear people all the time say well when i when i see the lord i'm gonna tell him this or that i'm going to demand an answer from god you wouldn't even be able to speak because of how holy he is brother branham says that god is such a holy god that even the angels even the heavens look dirty to him how many believers do we have how many know where you're standing we have to know where we stand you know when we see these things if man can't even handle the angel that is sent how will we ever stand before a holy ghost we many times can't even stand for the truth we can't even stand for what we claim to believe much less stand for christ i standing before the judgment seat of christ and having to give an account for our lives we have been given opportunity after opportunity oh i'm telling you it becomes more of a reverent fear like never before god wants courageous men and women that will stand for the truth and the word stand there doesn't mean that you're idle that you're not moving or that you're not in action you take the assault and and you endure it amen it's to take your place and be in your position yes there's only one thing church that god that it pleases him the bible says that without faith it's impossible to please impossible so who will be in their position when he appears who will stand came back and the worst stand is it it's right here you take your place this is a whole different this is a whole different message today i wanted to settle in this this is this is the foundation that we're laying yes for the series if he appeared in your home today to or will the woman be caught in his place would he find the couples married living true to their vows where do you stand will he find the children the youth respecting their parents or will he will he find a divided home will he find the husband and wife calling each other dude or will he find them treating each other what a thing where do i stand and who shall stand when he appears we're not interested this morning in opinions or someone's ideas you know we have it in this church you know we have it in the chat it gets a little uneasy huh after a while this is not easy i sat here and i cried this morning i began to type this and i looked at this and i just how can you not cry and answer the question lord where do i stand pregnant divided homes and the men sit back do nothing about it job 38 2 and 3 says who is this where were you when i laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou hast understand it yourself the question where was i standing that you're standing for today nothing has changed where you stood at the beginning is where you'll stand at the end that's why god is asking job and telling him i want an answer that professed the message they would rather see you fail to sit there and have a conversation in the churches someone is always asking the question that's why i tell you people and i pray you listen closely you know sometimes people come to church listen to church anymore especially why because most people that's that do that don't even know what they're really talking about hello everybody hola a new family comes to church and then all a challenge for you is you know it's sad that i heard this the other day oh yes certain people they were thinking of coming to church and they they overheard somebody from this church telling somebody else from this church why would we go to a church like that people in that church are laughing and making fun of their own people shame on us we'll answer to god foreign and our words many times are far from there you go somewhere to church and the questions are they keep coming where do you stand where are you with the tape people or the ministry ministries are you with the thunder people or the no thunder people are you with the returned people that are not returned with the ten [Music] i'm not here to choose sides with people we have our doctrine here maybe i don't care what other churches do nothing talking to us is paul says god knew what to do with me i want to exalt myself under the revelations that i received he put a thorn on my side and this is what the lord showed uh such a thing that i say my heart melts and i feel faint when i hear those things who shall stand when he appears matthew 12 25 speaks to us and it says and jesus knew their thoughts jesus and said unto them every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand where do you stand where does your house stand when it's divided against itself it cannot stand jesus knew their thoughts jesus what about our it's easy to read oh jesus knew the thoughts of those pharisees but he knows your thoughts simply something that has been impressed on us through our lives a certain doctrine or a certain church's ideas and that's usually what we hold on and believe to be true my parents were catholic so i'm catholic you're not standing on firm grounds i want you to get this now imagine to rest your eternal destination mom and dad believed it but you have to know that you have to have your own personal relationship that's what the bible it tells us to try the spirits and spirits try the thoughts see if those thoughts are from god or not come on church how many do that you get a thought do you try the fart and the first thing we should do i want proof you better tell that thought i want to prove there were this thought began at this point this morning that we preached is the very thoughts of god that were birthed are we to stand or where to stand today we serve the lord tomorrow today we we love we love each other tomorrow by the spirits and because of the lack of unity that's the reason there are so many divided homes divided churches divided relationships divided kingdoms there are three categories that must be restored [Music] this is huge nowadays because it's probably one of the hottest topics of the day is the husband and wife one or two el esposes it should be one people can be married 100 years and still not be won the church one or two el pastores [Music] is christ and his bride one or two es christo where do you stand as long as the husband and wife are not thoroughly identified no standing in vienna as long as the pastor and the church are not thoroughly identified as long as christ and his bride are not thoroughly identified that should be the first thing that happens in a marriage [Music] what he's supposed to do in the marriage what the word of god says that he should do and the wife must be thoroughly identified what is required of her know how to identify themselves in the marriage identification what happens even in the church they don't know how to identify the pastors it's not just the man up there that preaches on sunday no solos gender identity problems hello everybody we're getting to something here thomas who shall stand in this wicked evil age and i had got this from brother danny when he preached it's been a couple of years back wonderful there are messages that just stick to you whether danny was talking about how that in genesis 1 god said and god created and god did and god did have blood amen genesis 2 he forms the man yeah and now foreign start to read in genesis 2. the lord god the lord god said yes the lord god it wasn't just god anymore it was the lord god but if you go to the hebrew cross the word lord there means which means one with his family so now in chapter three he approaches him he says so god hath said that in itself shows that he did not want god to be one with his family without the proper name of of the lord jesus christ dare i'm going to say it again there are so many people today that don't have an identity you better have a better identity than that i believe your identity will show you who your pastor is to be wrong but you don't have to know who you are and there's there's an identity problem here there's an identity problem in the world today shall stand without an identity you can't go nowhere without an identity that's who you are let me pray with the kines well i go to church that's not proof yes the devil goes to church well i've been going to church since i was a baby and then we'll talk about [Music] are they can't identify what they are this is the problem today once again they can't identify who they are no they can't identify what they are therefore they can't identify their part in the relationship who shall stand when he appears but by the present estate that we're in right now establishing establishment where are you identified amongst the crowd and that's not just the crowd out there even the crowd in church where are you identified or do you mix really well brother brown goes on what group are you with i'm with the caleb and joshua outfit uh if you see it's not that you choose a group to be in no excuse but your choice to serve the lord automatically puts you in that group automatically is that right brother andrew i said brother andrew you don't join this church you are baptized by one spirit body of christ that right brother andrew a man of mine andrew that's right he's going to get baptized it's important to know where you're standing that's important are you with the believer esta con los crientes or do you have to be entertained at church oh if the music isn't just all just good i don't see live music making me jump out of my seats you see when someone doesn't know where they're standing they always feel threatened when someone disagrees with them that's why tell your brother don't you ever feel threatened by anyone yeah there was a man that was picking on my one of my guys he can handle himself pretty good though i said put him on the phone here i am walking around best buy preaching away trying to tell me that there is only one coming of christ i said poor you i said it's all over the bible there's three comings of christ they don't see the secret coming because it's not for everyone he said i believe that everyone goes through the great tribulation maybe you but not me i won't be there after a little while i was like hello our our belief but it makes us dig more no no no why i'm so grateful for the for god sending this seventh angel greatest message that has ever hit planet earth brought by the seventh angel to you and i okay raised us up and placed us in heavenly places jesus christ where we stand is and the question has arisen so much lately is a woman we hit on that a little bit last time and you and all these different professors from universities none of them this is my birth certificate oh okay so you had you oh this is where you were born i have a birth certificate for what is a woman where do i find that in the book of genesis the chapter el capitulo has its beginnings god raised up to bring forth children into this world somebody i don't want you have the birth certificate certificate nobody's going to tell you anything different i already searched the back no you are the school that's exactly what the abstract title d does it's an abstract it's an abstraction searches it back to the beginning to see who was with the owners at one time or through the years where did it come from where is the baby wow this is how much she weighs she weighed peso he or she he or she oh know where we're standing don't you believe anything anyone else unless you go back and find its inception that's message hits your heart where were there's no gender identity failure there i in my fire the header of the day i'm a man and says answer me like and the question arises today again i already said this but i'm going to say it again is a church and many cannot answer that oh we're the church of the living god that's that's good there's nothing wrong with that that's part of the answer especially the only way to answer that what is the church yes go back to its birthing i have to bring some doctrinal points here i'm not in any way throwing at anyone that don't believe like us god bless them i love them and i can sit down with any of them any time there's nothing against any brothers or sisters but how can you have a church without a pastor it's just a meeting place brother brown says how can i overcome commodities your pastor is your husband spiritually speaking that's not that's not up for discussion it is what it is but sometimes the church wants to tell the pastor what to do what's going on gender identity problems i want to put my own little group gender identity problem you don't have a birth certificate for that certificate hold i send you elijah the prophet for the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers scripture not only shows its birthplace not against anyone but i have to say what the prophet says what paul and without holy ghost-filled men who are called to fill the offices in that church forgive me but don't forgive me tape does not fill the office this is we gotta know where we're standing this is what he says this is brother branham these apostles prophets prophetess teachers evangelists and pastors pastors are god sent not god or not man called son god sent inspired men to keep the church lined up it's gifts of the spirit in the church that keep that church if a real church was ordained of god really filled with the holy spirit sin would appear in the church if sin would appear in the church if somebody had done something wrong the holy spirit would raise up and reveal it thank god that he's placed gifts in the church keeps that's why they may not like me for this because that's why there's no such a thing as a tape church and i'm not throwing anyone that gets together and here's tapes yeah i bless them nothing against them but the tape shows those offices how a church should be set up how a church should run how a home should run and how the individual should conduct themselves the tape shows all that gotta take people that will believe the message get into the place or the position that god has has predestined for them to be in the position i don't say this to throw at anyone but i say this who establish you in the faith wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things yes though ye know them and be established in the present yeah wait wait wait a minute wait we got it we gotta but because and and paul he knew he had to get them into grace peter finally realizes the ministry that god placed in paul ministerio quezon i know what's the purpose of these messages for that reason establish you in the present truth especially know where you're standing it's a progressive revelation not different from the first revelation okay it's it's not different but it's a furtherance of that revelation and this is the present truth yes why jesus christ the same yesterday the present and and revelation is always it is always progressing that's the problem with people today yesterday and they don't see what the present truth is my goodness i don't know maybe i should stop here have you had enough no yeah sure you want me to go a little bit more i'm telling you this really has hit me to my soul to establish us yesterday in the ephesian church age it speaks he speaks this la esto it was the apostles oh brother jimmy loves that subject that original word could not change that's right but he can give a revelation that that seed had to come through abraham said that it would come by the same bloodlines in david and it was the same i have come to make you understand and it's never been so great even from the moment that brother branham brought the message [Music] he's the one do you believe like me brother they may ask me this is my vision for in other words what he was preaching what he was seeing now seeing the vision for the future but the vision for the future i'm looking at the presents brother branham says this is my vision for the future and the message will take you it says so that you can there has been many groups of men that god has used but i also see this group of men what if i had a group of men trained in the message this is [Music] they were trying to destroy his influence before the people influence the same as they're doing now if they can just destroy the influence of the message before the people we will not let nothing whip this message but we also have the marriage [Music] can i have like 10 minutes and then i'll let you go see man of bombs we were speaking about the gates of hell in mexico in mexico here comes a young lady full of demons they're dragging this i don't know 14 15 year old girl down the aisle but watch as the unit the body the ministry comes together it wasn't just brother caleb it was the minister it was the body there's what would you do for the lord if would you serve the lord the rest of the days of your life i said will you be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins i said will you follow this message that was brought by william branham it had a little piece of material brother branham look for the mother to tell her hey give this and hold it against your daughter pray with her mother was on the other side it was the girl that was closest to the aisle and i looked at her and i went straight to him her eyes were perfectly fine she looked at me made me know and said with her eyes thank you he turned to her mom and said you know what happened someone was sincere the mother was sincere no matter what really wanted liberation for her daughter sometimes you can't even leave church because there's demons all around people talking and people getting upset and blah blah blah all things going on right outside the church we just got out of church everybody's already giving each other dirty looks to everybody but some people yeah she goes to the back of the back you know what is happening it goes to another young lady i'm nervous because more i see more of the young ladies than than the men but i'm going to tell you young ladies every one of you from now on don't go to the bathroom okay you start to breathe harder have a little anxiety i don't care if it's during a during a song search i don't understand that god act like we're free let's live like we're friends but i will tell you this every time that jesus says with the with the musicians but every time that jesus did something the bible says listen closely don't get carried away don't look around who's coming it's just the musicians coming up no matter what time and time again employee every time that jesus did some great miracles the bible says who is this but only two times in the scriptures scripture do we find that jesus that jesus was amazed jesus only two times in the scripture those vessels and they both had to do with faith listen closely here oh you're gonna be in that's what we're talking where do you stand where's your fight listen closely the first time la primera was the centurion i know my servant will be made whole yo he spoke the word jesus said jesus bible says look up that word that word means amazed because of a great faith they marveled the second time because of the lack of their faith i'm telling you this morning the way i see this is that's a question for you to ask yourself jesus jesus of your great faith because of your lack two things that made him react those who believe and they weren't expected to believe and those with every reason to believe contol my question is does he marvel at us today for a lack of faith or for a great faith does he marvel at you because you believe him is even when all the world turned their back on you okay maybe your family turned their back on you so familiar been through things in your life and no one you say nobody could love me he says that you would believe with all your heart young people don't let it be that he marvels the other way to be raised you've been taught right and shown right you've had the opportunity to live for the lord with all your heart fully surrendered marvel him that way no no but can you marvel him today but even in the darkest most sinful time you've chosen to live for him and to be a light shining in a dark world chosen to take sides with jesus and to withstand all the negative comments [Music] sorry i took a little longer this day there's such a reverence as i said a reverent fear that that has come circling around us i'm going to tell you again my heart melts when i even think pando how could we ever stand before but he made a way and he
