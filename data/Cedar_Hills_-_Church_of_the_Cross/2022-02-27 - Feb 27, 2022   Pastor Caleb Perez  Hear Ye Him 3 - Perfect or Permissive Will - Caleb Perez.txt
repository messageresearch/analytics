neighbor welcome good to see you god bless you all i'd like to greet brother adolfo mr mr you see all it reminds you of all that you've been through that and we simply say precious memories how they linger and for those that weren't able to come they're back home and uh they're watching us online back home and uh there's others in different parts of the country that are online watching spaces you all just turn around there's a camera back there just wave at them say god bless you amen amen and we're thankful to the lord for life and for this opportunity this morning brother we'll go as far as the lord leads us and then we'll stop when he says i i had been in a subject that i started on hear ye him and a couple sundays ago i preached the message here you him with a subtitle divine intervention but this morning i'd like to it would be hear ye him number three with a subtitle perfect or permissive will perfect so we pray that it is a blessing to you so kind when we're standing to turn in our scriptures uh to the book of saint john the sixth chapter of san juan capital and the 38th through the 40th verse and it reads like this for i came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me this lord i'm gonna hear this morning can say not to do my own will not to do my own will but to do the will of him that sent me and this is the will of the father or the father's will which hath sent me yesterday that of all which he hath given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me yesterday that everyone that seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last give you a moment to find it and it says while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hear ye [Music] one more time neighbor here and the interpreter or the i'm sorry the song leader and and for all the specials god bless you for your efforts especially i'll start by saying what a time we're living in one more time what a time that we are living in a and we're all sitting on the front row watching it all come to pass what a time we are living in the gospel of the kingdom being preached that's how sometimes it's all doom and gloom but but what a time we're living in am i talking about anyone here and it behooves us to know where we are standing first corinthians 10 12 tells us therefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall where the complete full perfect will of god is unfolding as it is right now it's sad to say this is but so many people have lived for so long under god's permissive one more time we have been so comfortable living under god's permissive will think just because god blesses us that it automatically means we are in his perfect will automatically acts the 17th chapter and i want to get these scriptures and make sure that we that we we put them in this foundation i want to know here this morning how many of you has god ever winked at your ignorance anybody here a few of you god has i'm grateful to god that he has winked at my ignorance it says but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent yes god has winked at our ignorance and that means wink means time past but when the light of the blessed gospel has shone upon we think it's okay continues to keep us it means that you're tolerant of something when we're talking about god's perfect or his permissive will means that he's tolerant of something but it might not be what is the perfect will think of this as just something simple being born into this world through sex between the mother and the father was not god's perfect will you only know that god tells us but it's god's permissive will in other words he permits we were all but through a new and we come to find out what his perfect will is is that the majority of people and then the children think that that's the way really to serve the lord we can hide a lot of things oh [Music] he said i was at home so i'm going to appreciate and we think that because god has tolerated certain things that he approves of us and once again i'm here to tell you that's not so casino to tolerate something doesn't mean you approve of it god is a holy god how many [Music] and god does not work in number two or number five spot god will only work in the number one spot let me tell you something so that we can get this clear the picture clear god has never and will ever never ever ever hamas god will never no never hello the blood of jesus christ he knows that we need a little bit of time to where we need to get it so he is tolerant but it doesn't mean it's his perfect will but the coming of the lord is so close to yourself every day not just when you come to church check yourself every single day are you serving god under his perfect will yes it's the difference between the pride it was oscillating right in front of me in front of the bed and out of that light ides came forth an angel now to many people praise with mangoes do it like that in front of my bed and he said what i tell you most people was like whoa yes but my father said i kept looking at him and he said you do exactly what i tell you it was not scriptural [Music] and i will tell you this in this church you better watch it let them be a curse whether it's angels or preachers how many have that much confidence in your past i said i will never do what you tell me you will and i said i will never preach permissiveness i will always preach god's perfect word what it cost me i want to know how many of you ministers could say that this is i [Applause] but the moment that a little bit of of pressure comes on us the first thing we do is our guy guess jesus lord don't love me he said i'll preach god's perfect will his perfect word no matter what it costs you know some of our life story much i'll still preach the perfect word now we're getting into something else watch where we're going i kicked him so hard he says because wait till we have to answer for every word that comes out of our mouths they've gotten away from the very foundation and they tolerate sin in church they tolerate unbelief and now people don't people think they don't need a pastor anymore i said people think they don't need a pastor necessity i think they can make it on their own that's not part of the foundation of the fundamentals hola does god ever change his mind about his words i won't even go into that because that's a whole another subject you know when brother branham talks about the cinematic woman he says this shooting my woman died she goes to where where the prophet is brown says he was her representative the resurrection of lazarus let me because my time is already going away from me and i haven't even started but listen to this when we think that we don't need a part of god's word anymore then how will you ever know god's perfect will without the mystery that he's placed in the church to bring you an eye to perfection doesn't matter that doesn't make sense the way that we think many times you'll never know god's mind you'll never know his perfect will and the ministry that he placed in the church [Music] on that one how many believe that prayer can change the mind of god [Music] some of you are you're pretty sure we should stand right now before i answer i want to see where he's going with this contest how many believe that that prayer can change the mind of god there's about one two three four five six okay well there's about maybe twenty thirty but i thought you just said that when you said a man a while ago i thought you said that god never changes his mind about it okay let me stop because i want i i'm not interested in running someone i want i want to get you this morning that god never changes his mind about his word ah that's right okay now we're you got to put it in there in the right place right god never changes his mind that's why brother branham would say this is when god was going to wipe out the children of israel and then here comes because moses says lord in the lord lord of lords [Applause] can his mind be changed about his word we're getting on a good track so how many believe that prayer can change god's program what is [Music] i'm going to read to you from the message the works that i do bear witness of me well i got a testimonial of me brother branham says he says i know jose prayer changes things it even changes god's changes god's mind about and here we are as human beings that go to church we know a little bit about god now and when we hear this crazy oh praise god and prayer will change his mind about that it has been done he says and then he says remember hezekiah because without understanding what the end because then we get an attitude every time we pray we got to get the same results anybody here guilty of that argument [Music] what's the matter que pasa is that anybody here we're on top of the world when he answers what do we pray for but when he doesn't contest oh my goodness oh this meal this is why it's so important to find the perfect will of yours though god will allow permissiveness you still are gonna have to deal with permissible there's always a price you got to pay for that i'm not seeking the perfect will of god that's why we complain all the time because we get comfortable living under god's permissive will we don't like the results of as my father had that experience that was 1951 when brother branham said that about prayers but watch 1965 we are here on this earth and you know the only way we know or we say that we're saved by some jewish fable called the bible will take care of that watch this now i said now sir i don't know how you can say that he said i asked for so how many are honest how many how many prayed and you didn't get what you what you're praying for we all should watch what he says here and i didn't get it he said and then i said this is brother brad i'm saying i said because you prayed wrong watch him balance this out physical prayer changes the mind changes the program watch him balance everything else in 1965. you pray wrong because god's mind don't need change because we're always praying lord lord do this lord and do this foreign come on church i'm going to say it again god is perfect it is omniscient it knows all things the mind of god knows the beginning from the end god is infinite eternal it's pure perfect it's perfect why would me as a human being pray to change god's mind what do i want him to change do i wanted to change it to my finite mind do i want him to change it to my imperfect mind how many are with me and that's why the holy ghost is telling you this it's because we take the wrong attitude [Music] and i don't need an amen for that one we are creatures that always want to be in control [Music] really absurd after a while it's absurd to think that we would want to change his mind it's because we're the ones that always want to be telling god what to do let me change your mind that's not the way it should be no this is then i'll believe them that love the let me make sure that you understand that there is a difference between god's permissive and his perfect will let me stop here for a moment because after years in the message let me tell you this now it is not god's perfect will in the message so long but why do we have prayer lines then we got to balance things because if not then we go wait a minute the bible says lay your hands upon the sick they shall recover well i'm not going to invite you no more to my church and this was well i don't care i'm not going to invite you for your time don't matter who it is but certain american brothers hermano americano we're preaching that was just speak the word that's the perfect faith i say amen to that because the word says the problem problem is is that not everybody has arrived to that level right amen here come a a a drug addict when he comes and they still won't believe the ministers we don't believe that no no because it wasn't them but the thing about it is this is that as he put his hands punished it was not [Applause] that are not at that level yet i think they cannot last anywhere but god tolerates that until that person gets to that level that's when they get to that level it's no more permissive will oh now we're finding a balance to all things watch what he says have god change your mind to his mind this is brother branham watching the children that message children of israel and then is because you're supposed to take my word but if you just speak the word why he was a gentile in that perfect faith but i'm going to come to the gentiles that when the gentile dispensation is over he'll turn and take the same faith okay all right now notice this now figure it's not about how much we forgive me but i'm going to be honest with you what i said you want god's perfect will to understand oh many times we come to the front and people will start to shake and move there's a time for that that's okay i have nothing against that you're not going to know all this can make one shout and one cry and the other one you know laughs speak in tongues one prophet praise god there's nothing wrong with it but the thing about it is that sometimes we come and we try to work ourselves up to it sorry sorry it's not come on and i have to keep saying come on [Music] it's nothing [Music] we're not seeing people do cartwheels and all of a sudden it wasn't a good service and we're like really maybe 30 40 years ago it's still there it's no excitement i noticed people coming through the line he says and just shaking themselves and oh god hallelujah amen glory to god don't do that noah hallelujah wait a minute he's not done yet if it is a narcissist you interfere with god come up but reverently wow every time the word comes forth it is doing a work in us we are blind to that this is looking for something to excite this guy namaste faith is something that's already in your heart you just come and believe it now there's nothing wrong after the lord's giving you and the blessings fall and you jump and shout oh yeah have a good time we're understanding the will of god he says show me a scripture where jesus ever jumped and shouted there's not one no no but i'll show you a bunch of scriptures that everybody jesus touched divine healing is not yes that's one of the great mysteries that the prophet came to unfold history of the baptism of the holy ghost oh i got the baptism we know when it's moving even though there is no sensation we want god's permissive or perfect will perfect how many one is perfect i want his perfect will there's a perfect way and there's a permissive way and that's why paul would say a more excellent way how many want to know a more excellent ways god permitted israel to take the law when grace had already given them a prophet come on now grace already provided a prophet when we pray it's not god's perfect because that's what's in your heart no wonder david would say creating miami that's why jesus when they said teach us to pray i will be done [Applause] temptation go ahead the light of frequency is so tremendous there's things that you've heard before i'm not telling you nothing new but he'll grant you permission he okay brother aj tell us what you said about sometimes god cancels our plans or or or what did you say right that's what he said did you hear that sometimes god ruins our plans thank you brother aj when i look at this cuando esto as long as you live i'll never forget this god doesn't change his mind because there's no canvas amenti it won't change his plan noah can be a supreme he won't change his word no i can be a super laboratory not for you no but not for me not for anyone else you've got to change you can't have god's word to match your experience you've got to have your experience good to have experiences yes match it with that's why we no longer live under the dispensation of the outpouring of the and every one of the prophets of old and patriarchs they all wanted to live in this time word of god has been perfect opened up already what a day we live in now now think about this this is as i was studying this i i rejoice in so many things there are only a few so that will live and act out the perfect will of god am i talking about we'll go down here brother aaron this is we're gonna say he's this is jesus jesus he had been adopted the father had adopted el padre matthew 17. now he had already the father had already approved and everything was done but there came a point that he was going to have to prove this question he had already been adopted in the mountains but now he comes to a place called gethsemane and the father knowing that the plan had to unfold the challenge of redemption but yet as a man jesus begins to cry jesus but i want to this is the lamb this is everything say it again son say it again [Music] what was so amazing about it is possible to put the father's will es posible ahead of yours oh that's what he was after i didn't get that thank you brother aaron i didn't get that one it was possible men and women greatest thing that we could so much to say but that holy spirit says no no no no no if we could come to that place of understanding and i just want to tell you that this is the greatest thing question how many of you have ever waited upon the lord for something it's not wait upon the lord like oh we'll see when he does something there doesn't mean that wait upon the lord lord please help me i i do not need the comforter today i need you on the scene and when you wait that way shall renew their strength oh sister crystal there's times and girls there's time that you'll say lord i can't know more i don't understand look at it but nevertheless not my will as children of and then the holy i said lord what do you mean it's my turn you're waiting on me that's me now it's time for me to wait on you this is where we're at today i'm waiting on god who here has a desire to receive that's it oh you got to say lord i want you that's it why don't we make it so hard he said i'm waiting on you [Music] your faith works the best and afterwards thank the lord and glorify him [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] in the beauty [Music] lord you see the hands of it's just a sea of hands up in the air right now as much as pilot just just so many hands up this morning these are trophies [Music] preach [Music] jesus as the holy ghost goes around the building [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] together as a body of belief [Music] right next [Music] it all belongs [Music] expecting they're anticipating [Music] come lord jesus on the scene come to every open heart lord jesus christ [Music] thank [Applause] [Music] you move in this place [Music] oh [Music] let him break every chain [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] i'm expecting [Music] oh [Music] yes [Music] that's perfection [Music] [Music] [Music] stop [Music] but afterwards it brings it together [Music] the body is capped by [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank the lord for them [Music] i'm gonna say i'm gonna say it again the prayer of a righteous man [Music] [Music] can you say i love you jesus the animals in your history say it again i love you jesus you are worthy to be praised and adored and as things like that love you jesus don't stop saying it i love you jesus [Music] god bless you this morning [Music] in your life [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] go [Music] is
