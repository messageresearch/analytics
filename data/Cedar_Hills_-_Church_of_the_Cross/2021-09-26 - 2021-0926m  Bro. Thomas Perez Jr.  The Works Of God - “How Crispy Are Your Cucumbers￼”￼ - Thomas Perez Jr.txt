this morning god bless and uh and for everybody that's on online god bless you this morning and we're happy to have everyone here today is and amen amen in in the in the book of first john in a libra de and i i'm going to try to take it a little easy on myself this morning we love the thrill that we feel when we get together with god's wonderful people first john chapter 3 behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not quite beloved now are we the sons of god and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him or we shall see him as he is little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous he that committed sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil verse nine whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god we're thankful father for their word this morning we're thankful for your people this morning grateful for your presence yeah and father after this is all over in the book of saint john the sixth chapter and verse 26 verse of 96 jesus answered them say it and said verily verily i say unto you you seek me not because he saw the miracles but because he did eat of the loaves and were filled labor not for the meat which perishes but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath god the father sealed him unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god that ye believe on him now i i want to uh entitle my message this morning the works of god and this might sound really funny or kind of corny or kind of strange piece [Music] but with a subtitle of how crispy are your cucumbers so you'll you'll find out a little bit more in a little while you know the word of god is is is so tremendous when i as i as i was hearing it last sunday and i as i hear the word of god as it is being ex expounded to us it has the the power in itself to produce and to bring about the exact effect that it is supposed to bring it the word of god is supposed to change the word of god is not a snack jesus says man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god and the word of god is simply it's our nourishment it's we we we can't even walk unless he comes in and and dwells in us and and gives us what we need that day is then god becomes a historical figure to us i never want for god to become a history for us because a god of history can never help us in that lives is this is maybe you maybe you don't but i did no that that mary was walking around one day and all of a sudden the angel came to her and greeted her and uh and all of a sudden the the the holy spirit overshadowed her and then he said that mary and joseph were having a conversation and the conversation was according to the message or or the the teaching that the rabbi had done on the day before he said i heard what the rabbi had to say about about the miracles that god did for our fathers and what god did for our grandfathers her question was can god do it today and then mary tells joseph did you notice the scripture that was given to us in the book of isaiah in the leader of the isaiah she said let's read it if we can vomit and they started reading for unto us a child is born a son all you're going to think what the word of god has got you cannot get anything on behalf of god if you don't talk about him i like to come and as we're hearing brother branham or or hearing here or reading the bible or hearing the or or hearing the messages what does that mean significant when all of a sudden the angel repents says hail mary you say hola maria you have found favor with god i want to tell you that you're gonna you're gonna have a son scripture started being fulfilled right then and there do you know what scripture you're gonna fulfill behold i send you out hold i sent to you and be outstanding elijah the prophet and leah for the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord the scripture that belongs to us that identifies god in our age child is giving when you when you come to to the to the realization of where we're at and the bible speaks to us in the book of numbers and you find out that that these were uh the israelites were were a people israelites it seemed like they always complained about something did you ever complain because you were too blessed yes and it becomes a complaint about everything we get rib eye and rib eye and and porterhouse steaks we get the best every sunday morning and it's not enough but this is where the israelites found themselves and they said in chapter 11 and verse and verse 5. we remember the fish and the garlic but now our soul is dried away there is nothing at all besides this manna before our eyes what they had forgotten is when they were eating the fish when they were eating the cucumbers pepinos when they were eating the melons and the onions and the garlic what they had forgotten was the basic thing the most cruel thing that they were under [Applause] the bars can be made out of gold but you're still a slave. they had forgotten that now they were free they had a slave mentality unless somebody whipped them that day they weren't comfortable unless somebody told them what to do again they all of a sudden came into this slavery when god frees them by the mighty hand of moses and they got to a hard place all they could remember was the fish and the cucumbers the melons and my question this morning to people is this how crispy are your cucumbers they were in the wilderness if they had any cucumbers by now they have become pickles amargost they had already become pickles but their remembrance was the cucumbers now there's nothing wrong with cucumbers i love cucumbers radishes and avocado avocado with any dish that you have you got a good dish we're gonna grow some big cucumbers but the cucumbers that they were thinking about was the imagination and how crispy are they right now jesus christ has done some marvelous things i appreciate what god did in silver city appreciate what god did it could you look at your season but i don't live back there jesus christ is the same yesterday [Applause] while but i'll tell you what what peter james and john did what is it after they received the holy ghost they come to a gate called beautiful and now what i do is i take from those things that were in my wife not to embarrass her she is the greatest woman i've ever met yes she me i married her but you know me and her have a this this thing hey i'm i i'm a type of person that i i i come across really really difficult really fast that's the greatest thing man i heard if you're welcome as i was telling my mom it was a it's a gift one so so so the simplicity of it is this i do a lot of bad things with her yeah yeah you know i'll do something bad against her but immediately i say i'm sorry and then she tells me then i'll do it again and she says see you weren't you weren't sorry for it [Laughter] so how did i do it again that's how i got how crispy are your cucumbers but because she's such a great person to deal with first the cucumber turns into a pickle and you you make i love pickles how many love pickles too all right good good man went so you love pickles i love pickles sister sister paula makes some of the best pickles but a pickle is is is a is a cucumber in a jar it's already old you need to whether you need to whether you need to leave it two hours three days five days whatever it's an old cucumber that's why they call it a pickle it's not it's not it's no longer a cucumber but did you know that a gourd is the same it runs in the same family quest is in the same family so it goes not that a cucumber becomes a gourd because no it doesn't no no no but what i'm saying is it belongs to the same family this is where we find ourselves elisha comes and he finds the school of the prophets and when they come to meal time they come to the meal time what i want to tell you is this when you come to the word of god and god gives you the richness of his glory you can you can you can munch on some great cucumbers but if you use them for history they become a pickle and you're thinking that you're still eating a cucumber can you imagine the imagination of a person 40 years later puerto and this was their complaint jesus said this i am the bread that descended from heaven they were not rejecting just the manna no had now rejected the word made flesh this is what i've understood of the message when your life does not produce it it's easy to say well brother branham did it esposito said oh elementary it's an easy way out facility the denominations say the apostles vietnam so we cannot produce the fresh is it doesn't have when the people of israel came out of israel they came out in a mixed multitude you want to start getting away from church stay hang around with people that don't come to church you want to unbelieve your we were born for [Applause] five demon-possessed women there in uganda i look back to see where my dad was he wasn't there the cucumbers remember the melons remember the promise of god [Applause] [Music] but but you'll find out what happened he had a disease that made him always horrible you can imagine how he looked not sitting out for anybody could do something with that poor man he wouldn't do it it'd be a brute i listen closely as we close this man standing there on his hands and feet he thought that i wanted him to do a war dance if there happens to be a missionary here would know that's what they plan a lot for the tourists and so forth doing their tribe dance the man wasn't mentally right and i said um i want to pray with him and he kept going like that but his hands just down on his old four couldn't raise up i said look what a condition that poor human beings in that man's a soul just like i am or anybody else here i said if there's any witch doctor that's near i'll challenge you in the name of the lord jesus to come do something for him that's right everybody was crying but there'd been a vision over him i'll say the thing he's thinking about he's thinking about his brother he's born in a christian home when he's young a baby he was this away i said he's 22 years old now but i said in a christian home he was born and his parents raised up to witness the same thing but i said he had a brother that was riding either a yellow goat or a dog and he fell off and he's hurt himself and he walks on two sticks under his arms like crutches i have to look on i see the vision of the boy being healed i said but thus saved the lord the boy is healed and about a city blocked them all away from me i heard a scream and here come the boy jumping up in the air holding them crutches ovaries i had just a screaming to the top of his body it taken them 20 minutes now to get the crowds quiet in the militia all around then in a few moments i looked again to the man to see what would happen above him was a vision like a blue shadow like looking into a television there's to the man normally nobody never knows what it is i've seen the dead raise that the doctor pronounced him dead i've seen things happen when god has said so like that all devils out of hell can't stop it amen just call almighty i've seen him sitting there normally i thought here's my chance here's my chance lord i said if anybody could help that man he wouldn't do it for me but i said i'll challenge the priest of the muhammad table to come and give him his soundness i'll challenge the witch doctor or anyone else to come and give him his soundness nobody can and neither can i but the god of heaven has raised up his son christ jesus and his promised the same things that he did we would also and i have seen a vision on the body that he's going to be made well it's just saith the lord if he'll do this i said how many will believe on him and he raised her hands i walked up to the void said in the name of the lord jesus raised up he thought it was like this interpreter told him again i threw a chain and all of a sudden he raised to his feet for the first time in his mortal life the tears run down on his back belly he began weeping that crowd went into a panic and i said everyone here that now only receive jesus christ his personal savior stand to your feet thirty thousand raw heath who stood to their feet and he accepted jesus christ as personal savior at one time but ten times bigger than the day of pentecost thirty times bigger notice what taken place mr baxter come to me said brother branham i believe in physical healing i believe you are standing interpreters again i said it again i said i do not mean physical healing i mean that you accept and will renounce all other gods and you will receive jesus christ as your savior if you're sincere throw your trinkets on the ground brush your idols and it was like a stone of death where the power of god struck the place and thirty thousand of them wow that's what's the matter with the christian church today and failed to do what christ said to if i be lifted up no wonder david could god bless the lord over my soul and forget not all his benefit who forgives all of our iniquities and healeth all of our diseases he's still god denied what then does it take it takes a surrendered life yes and that's wonderful but unless you live the life that these people did there is death in the pot i'm worthy that's why the five full ministries has been so thrown at in this last time that we don't need no preachers anymore that we don't need pastors apostles pastors apostles pastors prophets teachers and evangelists that we don't need them no more not he didn't [Applause] the holy ghost guides me if the holy ghost guides you anywhere i gotta hit that one more time give me chapter verse it is not unless they are conformed and he says according to this blueprint blueprint and this he finishes after this and that is thus saith the lord how do you get away from that is the word of god in its power i don't care what you do and you go home without that want to work the works of god how do i work the works of god to believe on him this is what this and finishing now this is what jesus was trying to get to the samaritan woman the first thing that he asked for i think of the glories yes i do but i also think of everything that that went wrong i also think of things that we've lost things that have and i'm here working in uganda in uganda me and the pastor are working with a man and i look up the road and i see a lady in a white dress coming and walking towards us as she gets closer it's my mama you think what is holding back the coming of the lord it's the readiness of the church foreign there's going to be a meeting in the air and we're going to meet them here how many have loved ones that have gone over to the other side we're going to meet them you've heard this before from our pastor pastor the reason that he has you meet them before before you meet him in the end because if you would meet him what a day that in the church oh yes cucumbers are good [Applause] you know there is coming today you know how hard you cried when your mama died you [Applause] hallelujah you know that lady that woman marilyn monroe died in maryland but somebody told me to watch the film the river of no return and when i saw her on the yoyo she was alive again divo de noise that one day can capture the literal voice of jesus thinking from your jesus is alive it's just beating jesus is not dead tell your neighbor we're gonna definitely tell your name jesus is not dead jesus is alive tell your neighbor he is alive [Music] thank you lord for healing me from my back senora misparda [Music] thank you lord for giving us the plan of salvation thank you for giving us the blueprints thank you for giving us a
