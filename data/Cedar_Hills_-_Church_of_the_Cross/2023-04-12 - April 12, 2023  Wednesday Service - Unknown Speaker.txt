[Applause] me amen God bless you [Music] thank you hello everyone brother Mike Carroll from Phoenix Arizona Phoenix Arizona testimonial 20 with my experience and Uganda experience first off everything that I had heard prior to making the trip as far as how life-changing the trip could be for someone uh uh with that I I built up an expectation but when I arrived in country it was everything I'd expected times ten it's very hard to put into words but I'll try uh the people that we came in contact with the pastors the ministry our team in Uganda Los pastures in Uganda we're the most humble and gracious people I've ever met in my life what they deal with on a day-to-day basis didn't hear any crying or murmuring you heard was joy and expectation conferences that we were able to hold while we were there with the pastors pastores ministers although they were they're quiet people on a day-to-day basis when it came to serving and worshiping the Lord they were the loudest people I'd ever heard in my life is and it had no problem with expressing how they felt about our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is you know when we it came time for us to leave they continue to say thank you and thank you and thank you gracias and I and I had to express to them that I owed them to thank you because it was a probably more of a learning experience for me experience than it was for them it gave me a totally different perspective mediona perspective differente on what the bride is and who she is Jesus Christ and I will grow from that is I will continue to learn from that and I look forward to the next opportunity that I have to Siempre Co bus to actually make that Journey yes [Applause] foreign I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if we could please turn to our scriptures in Mark chapter 16 verse 15. and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature [Music] I'd like to let you know that I was privileged and it was an honor to be able to go with Pastor Caleb and quiero this is the other ministers that went along with him truly was a blessing and from the bottom of my heart to travel with as brother will said the other day that there was 14 of us but we went as one Uno and in the scripture in Acts 2 chapter 2 verse and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place I was reading the message of brother Branham of questions and answers on the Holy Ghost Santo and this to me is exactly what happened there in Uganda yes Uganda when the day of Pentecost was fully come on they were all in one mind I like that better than one Accord one Accord upon most any subject stemmas but their minds but here their minds was the same one mind and in the same place and to see the interaction with the different brothers that went in companies it was beautiful to see that each and every one of them it didn't matter who we are or where we came from we never went anywhere unless we made sure that we were all accounted for eign we all went together following the leading of the Holy ghosts everything that we did and it was so beautiful to see that is one of the things that impacted me the most that I will always remember yes I remember on Sunday morning we were going to go to Brothers Rogers church it was raining that morning and as we were getting ready to go turn on the road to go up to his church oh the bus couldn't make it up the hill Escalade because of the rain forecast okay thank you amen God bless you all it's a pleasure to be back in the house of the Lord there's nothing like home but um just a pleasure to be behind this Pulpit today yes um there's so much to say with such little time to give it was just amazing to see the love of each one of those Brothers I mean I love that like can't explain like the way they hug you and yes they're such grateful people you see them with nothing but yet they have everything they need and the commitment you see in each every one of these pastors and ministers pastors you would see him packing up in a big cargo truck at least 50 in there and yeah and walking in the rain or and we would drive on our bus and we would just see him the church and it's amazing what our ministry has done over there yes you see these you see these pillars being builtes brother James brother Rogers it's amazing to see how how much they're enthused with the word of God is and and there was a let me just hit the scripture real quick it's John 16 24. here too happy asked nothing in my name asked and ye shall receive that your joy may be full and and the crazy thing is me and brother Tommy were talking about this we will see this these big cows or goats and they were just tied on with just a little old little rope and I said isn't that crazy they have the strength to break through that rope but they just won't do it and he said they're not roped by that rope they're roped in their mind they said and I began to say that's me that was me before I came I was rope by just a little rope I asked myself why am I going look at all this sin you've done you're not worthy no it is a little rope but then God says me and the Rope just went through yes maybe there's some of you with just a little sin again you're not worthy of the word of God you can't do that special who do you think you could change each and one of you know it's just a little old little rope as the devil tells you know voice anymore he's probably the same old lies amen and same old life mentiras and here's a quote with brother Branham it's it takes to overcome all unbelief there's it's chapter 60. now there's a time that a man come to a place where he can have a purpose it's something that will change him and that is when a man meets God yes a man could never be the same if he meets God face to face a day when you got to change it's not easy no especil you got this starts every day saying the word of God I'm just telling you is do anything just ask it in his name amen God bless you ameniga can you hear me yep now you can that's my brother Joe mermano Joe I'm happy to be here and and see you all again I thank the pastor for the confidence I want to start off by reading a scripture if I could it's found in Luke 10 2. we can all please stand and Lucas yes those it says therefore said he unto them to the Harvest truly is great but the labors are few pray ye therefore the lord of the Harvest that he would send forth the labors into his Harvest a man you may be seated I think the I thank the Lord for for allowing me to go to back to Uganda again with the pastor and all the men that that went foreign I got to see the ministers they don't just read the Bible there so brother I think it was brother Jimmy he was teaching a subject and they switch subjects in and as he switched subjects brother Tommy he he uh he yells out the scripture without looking to without looking to his notes or the Bible and brother Jimmy says oh I know and it's just amazing to see that the word isn't just in in Bible form it's in them so my duties up there I was the I was given the great honor yeah of reading scriptures for for my brother Tommy and whole in holding his backpack and carrying his bag around to me it's an honor to do these things some would say it's a small and significant part which is me I remember my life two years ago he made me part of his plan you know I'm a willing servant now yes this time it's to the king you know it it was inspiring seeing Joe and Joe in in brother will up here who's getting ready to come down it was their first missionary trip a supreme uh and seeing the way that I'm sure that they were a little nervous but how obedient to God at such a young age it's just amazing how they listen to that still Small Voice and over in Uganda there's there you would think that it's all desert the greenest place I've ever seen their ground is thick and clean it's like red color es is the ground there is the natural definition of good ground definition over there you saw the brothers when it was as they accepted the message just a few years ago the way they've heard it and they've accepted it and they've shared it is not just the natural definition but they're the spiritual definition of Good Grounds and it's for the seed and that seed is it's been a seed that's been planted over there and it's in those men and it's sprouted and I thank the Lord for allowing me to see his Harvest if he permits me it sure won't be the laughs amen God bless you amen [Applause] amen God bless and every one of you yes [Music] found in Matthew 14 27 and 30. just but straightway Jesus spake unto them Jesus saying be of good cheers it is but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to think he cried Lord save me amen he may be serious and so I just have a bit of a testimony I'd like to share with each and every one of you first of all I wanna um how my pasture do you see that is you gracias for being there for me foreign and I I can definitely say I'm someone that would love to have that same uh love for the word of God I had such a great time out there in Uganda as you guys saw we made a video I had that privilege to um to capture those memories memories that are so Unforgettable and they're memories that uh we want to hold on to yes just to get right into the testimony testimonial by the grace of God like many of us here I've had the privilege to grow up in this church and in this message I was someone who had a lot of Joy at all our passion for the things of the Lord I love to playing a music for the Lord I love to pray and most of all I love to read my Bible yeah it was a place of healing it was a place of healing as time went on trials and tribulations started to come I soon developed some condition with doctors call this Association meaning disconnected or disconnection is a significant disconnected or this this connection and uh I myself began to feel very disconnected from my surroundings my eyes with dilate making everything feel so unreal like I was living in a constant dreams I began to lose awareness of everything that was going on around me um I began to lose awareness of my own body I lost um I lost sync with my own body synchronization emotionally emotional and spiritually and the boy with a place that used to be well that's not a that's not a great place to be yeah just like I became very disconnected in the natural is I also became very disconnected in the spiritual meaning led me to a very heavy state of depression um uh anxiety took over my life beer overtook me to a state of Brokenness yeah where I felt very shattered where I felt like there was no hope is I became very imprisoned into my own mind the more time I I felt this way [Music] I became very distracted distracted with the things of this world I found myself not wanting to be at church not wanting to play or sing for the Lord not wanting to read my Bible not wanting to pray I was called and I came to a point of weakness but our Prophet tells us isn't it strain that God likened us to sheep noise a sheep is the most helpless thing there is nothing so insufficient of Defense than the Sheep a rabbit can run a squirrel can defensive but that's the way God wants us yes realize that we are totally insufficient okay and he turns us into and he begins to mold us he knows MPS the person that he wants us to be Allah what we can't do okay Nosotros it makes us live he makes our lips speak what God's lips would speak is I'm here to say that I'm nothing is for whatever the Lord may need me foreign [Applause] or God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life and I thank the Lord that day of redemption foreign God pouring out his love in our times of Shame and sorrow God took my place and it should have been myself pain the consequences of my own sins that's my place and by his grace with that we're in bondage we were set free and Redeemed by the blood he brought me back from so much weakness and that's because he is my strength he is I have a foreign it goes like this a dcrc now he cannot heal you or cannot save you or do anything for you until first you accept it and believe it that's right you've got to confess it is correct it's not that you've got to feel it got to confess it is not the high priest of your feelings he's the high priest of yours it's what you confess if you believe in healing and believe that God has healed and God will make your body obey your confession with his own blood to make intercession for any confession upon anything that he died amen and Isaiah 53. he was wounded for a transgression of our peace was upon Him of our peace [Applause] um it's a matter of accepting to accept what Christ did for you and I accepted except the price he paid to accept our healing to accept Christ in our hearts accept him as our savior Salvador and it's at that very moment yes that all sickness and sin is gone from and it's from that day yes forward that we are free thank the Lord uh the price was paid I do want to mention that uh official video coming soon [Applause] I think we could do a little bit better than that praise the Lord God bless his servants [Music] will if all the glory to Jesus [Music] [Music] love love yes
