this morning rejoicing sister sister rachel singing about the miracle mr mana rachel cantano de los milagros sister ruth talking about healing brother ethan singing and i said wow how perfectly it all goes with the message amen so we we could stay on all of the prophets that spoke until the coming of the lord but uh the lord says turn you turn the senor and so we are going to start a new series this this morning before we get into the word i want to i want to clarify something that i said last sunday there was not nothing that anybody told me but something that i felt that needs needs a little clarification i was talking about how how many times that that the people uh recognize the leaders and i use the word sometimes we get the glory you say it's simply i'm using it in the term of we we are the ones that receive recognition so we we know that that everything we do is not for our own glory glory and honor go to the lord jesus christ everybody here on that just wanted to meet i know we know but i but sometimes you don't want to let the enemy come in because we do nothing to try to receive or bring glory to ourselves so let's get into the word and and uh a man i've been so inspired with with what's been going on and i tell you i i think this may be the first time that i remember along with the ministers they're speaking about adoption now the lord is putting me or inspiring me to go and to hear ye him and to have all the ministry just going in the same direction we want to read uh uh hebrews 1 1. as i said we can stay on the prophets for a long time and it says god who at sun dry times and in diver's manner space in time passed unto the fathers by the prophets that's what we've been speaking about but now we want to turn the corner and come to now a little closer to home hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he at the pointed air of all things by whom also he made the worlds or created the world how many know what son of god means of all things that's why he hath appointed him heir of all things by whom also he had created or made the worlds matthew 17 5. this will be our scripture that we that we want to base it on those online god bless you wherever you are [Music] 17 5 says while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased with here what a thing it is may god add his blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated we're very happy to see as i said to see each one of you content amen so let's get into the word now these three words hear ye him determine the eternal destination of every man that hears it and his attitude towards it not just everyone that hears it but what is your attitude towards hearing because [Music] and nowadays we have so many voices that are directed at us everything that you hear it's a voice telling you things voices telling us what to do what to think what to wear what you believe where to go i is it just me voices literal voices voices literales voices on billboards and it's it's such a thing today that's why the voice of god is many times so rare it's so rarely heard even amongst the the the christian world it's because it's smothered out by so many so many other voices gotten to a place where sometimes our senses seem to be dulled to we're always asking well lord speak to me lord i can't hear you please say something to me yet in the midst of it all he's speaking to you missed all these voices he says he said he wasn't sure if it was just the wind maybe that was that that he heard but he said the voice of god came one more time and says and the voice simply said [Music] he said just speak to the storm a little sis [Music] oh we're going to get to some good things here so because the inspiration had come to him i like that once again i am the god of creation and we all know that only god can create we want to learn this morning not now now tell your neighbor only god can create this is important neighbor everybody shouldn't should know these things we have we have i i have i don't why put anybody else i have said this and repeated this many times the devil cannot create how many has said that the devil cannot create elements does everyone all understand that we many times we we act like they can create that's a doctrine of this church wow wow just just think about that let that let that penetrate just for a moment a doctrine of the church wait a minute we we are many times well we we want to argue about the doctrine of the tent the doctrine of the return of the regressor the doctrine of the thunders and of everything else and watch this that's a doctrine of this church in other words that's the part of the foundation of this church the very word as i put up here the formula of creation did you know that one of the one of the definitions of the word formula formula is a doctrine a doctrine of a church so when i speak about the formula of creation i'm talking about the doctrine of creation everybody get get get me all right so that is a doctrine of this church what do you all believe in that church i believe that satan is not a creator you started every conversation with them why why i think we could help a lot of people well they almost like you don't have to believe all these things start don't go there just start simple non-physical security we believe of creation and the only way that he can pervert creation there has to be creation that happens satan trying to how many remember that story about those scientists they were arguing with god we don't need you no more god we now are very intelligent is the science just they pick up a handful of dirt and when they do it he slaps her hand says get your own dirty notice this now people use the word today create so freely implying works of art or or inventions implicando he says a man that's a part of god he's a fallen race he's a fallen son and now in one sense of the word he cannot actually i'm there is an inspiration that was tapped into uh there's and that's where the very word imagination comes from where does the inspiration that activates our imagination where does that come from think about that inspiration can only come from one of two sources either from god or say oh it's not let me put it a little plainer oh never mind let's go on and by us not hearing the voice of god then everything we would make would be a perversion everything we would make would be our version and our version is use the upper version they are living because somebody don't see it or like we do ok well let's find out what version we have people are living under their version their we were speaking the other day but but that's why when you when you read or you hear or i 30 dollars hundred thousand my goodness they're telling you the success of it they're trying to inspire you especially when we're used to seeing fifty dollars then they start to lay off the formula or the plan for getting there [Music] fortunately what they can't tell you enough is what they have tapped into this is the plan this is how i did it this is the plan but the inspiration of it what drives it they're not going to they're not going to give you that watch when we look at that pandora let me tell you what god has done in my life what are we trying to do trying to inspire the people you hear what god did with his brothers it was a miracle what are we we're trying this morning as i said to stir the gift that is within you and we need inspiration the word inspiration actually or literally means that's why that's why when john was writing the book of revelation he would say i was in the spirit on the lord's day i was inspired i was inspired on the day of the lord when's the last in the book of psalms david would say create in me a clean heart and renew a right spirit within me in other words renew the right inspiration lord within me and me well i read the word brother that's all wonderful but the question is are you inspired to read come on we got to be real with ourselves this morning if we just pick up the bible now i gotta just soothe my conscience just read it man it's hard sometimes huh is it hard sometimes it's durability it shouldn't be right but when we like i said the other day but when we have to and this man we got this man we got this man and we got that and if we read the word it's wonderful but we've got to be inspired to read it we have to get into the spirit to read it if not it's the same as would be as reading and he reads the inspired word the two inspirations oh my my but in other words the two spirits his spirit and your spirit east west people he said i'll i'll put in you a new spirit of the holy spirit that's your spirit with a new nature i will put my spirit within yours when a don't need to be inspired jesus said the words that i speak unto you yes they are spirit and they are life so the spirit is somebody then the word is already inspired so what we need today is an inspiration over us watch how creation begins with a new inspiration and breathing over us word that's when you'll see miracles happen believers taking in the inspired word brings results is in no if all creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of god creation is groaning is creation finished a good question huh and that's why god creates in increments he does that to keep satan off balance what has not been created that's how he stays ahead of satan watch this now now now now get this in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and when god was creating he that's right the right hand man of almighty god was was lucifer all right my imagine if i got up here and acted like that you need a fresh inspiration let's inspire you [Applause] everybody everything the whole what's called the universe and lucifer illusive right next to him helping him and watching it all happen he picked up on things but he still wasn't the creator the devil cannot create nothing no puerto and it took him six thousand years six days six thousand years yes stays millennials to create his eden but occurs within it's taken satan six days or six thousand years to create his eden yes says milan and everything that's satan he first brings it up as something good those of you that have that that see what's going on in the world out there the hottest thing that is trending right now can anyone tell me what it is facebook just changed his name from facebook to meta facebook can be also known what is it the next stage of in the internet higher going into another realm anybody here coming together making what man is calling church what's going on out there and everything he does watch watch us now meta means to rise above me and go beyond it says it's a highly immersive uh virtual world realm it takes you to possibly an infinite number of parallel universes what is what's the inspiration behind all this where there is salvation where god is speaking to his people and take them into another realm where god does not exist at all taking you to another realm where you become god this is what this metaverse is all about it's another realm it's the evolution of this those of you that know about cryptocurrency it'll work hand in hand with this cryptocurrency and once everything is set up to work through this metaverse they'll be able to freeze your accounts whenever they want they'll be able to keep you from buying and selling i'll go into to a different currency watch out how tremendous this is it seems like such a wonderful thing and especially the new generation is wow buy all kinds of other things that are just not good what's the purpose of this question it's for you to make your own world espera it's for you to rule your own world it's for you to think of yourself as the god of your world why do you think people are that's where they're at nowadays they're sick and tired of their lives san casaus they get bored of going to church they're bored of doing all these things they can't send themselves they want to change they didn't come behind they get bored of their spouse they can't understand another one because they get bored and bored they never get sons and daughters now have that power inside is not that's almost it's not us as men but it is the hearing in him that when he speaks those are words of creation now think about this for a moment we live in three dimensions how saying perverts tries to skip the process a faster easier route and the formula formula is that he wants to do he's got a formula too but his formula brings death to formula god's [Music] sometimes he didn't know what world he was in listen watch the perversion now we'll take them into his metaverse and they sooner or later italian temple will not know what world they belong come on they have created such a fantasy in their minds it's a way of escape for them but it's the the antichrist spirit is working my god spirit is working also all over the world acting in the religious world politics the tech world whatever world secular world whatever you want to do it has become a conglomeration of every foul and filthy spirit that has come out of the bottomless pit canceling and the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet they repented not of the works of their hands that they should not worship devils and idols of gold and silver brass stone of wood which neither can see nor hear nor walk we can go into the religious realm of it and tell you what it is there we can go into the world and tell you what it is there but it's all made by human hands think about that for a moment because this this this brings us to an understanding what are these idols says anything you put before god is an idol it don't matter what it is religious or not religious and that doesn't matter and an idol in the bible is a representation of a being or person persona what is it called in in in the games in in computers there you go somebody knows anything that you create of yourself you ever try to build the person that's you're texting and you've got a little this is the best rendition that i could come up with of myself i tried to make one the other day i could just send it out with somebody and i could just be waving or what or not you know with dumb ideas but i could not find one that had a receding hairline it's what's representing you right it's what's representing you you naked so you're in the game and you're playing and it's like if you oh that's me that's playing oh yeah what is it doing the same effect that drugs do on you right but now it's you can see something that at least looks like you pero avatars and it's a graphic icon in other words an avatar is the gods who come down upon the earth amongst humans isn't that what happened in the time of paul pablo acts 14 if you want to you can write it down and read it later right paul prays for a crippled man that had been crippled from his mother's womb produced by man's imagination now get this the god baal right bill yeah bye here see them all through the bible it was produced by is the inspiration como es que von d'or the facebook repeated himself time and time again all he kept saying was imagine a world imagine imagine what could be imagined there's an inspiration there us as and we don't see any farther than this and when it's too late they're hooked on a tablet trying to make everyone a god using their serpent tells a woman you shall not surely die god knows the day that you eat thereof your eyes will be opened you shall be as gods come on now he didn't forget that still trying to get there he's still trying to be that himself he has many worshipping him that don't even know it but our doctrine is still the same is not a creator fear him he's not a creator can't be a perverter well there's no such a thing as devices in the bible there's no electronics those problems that's why people are looking for a way out everyone do the imagination of his evil heart every word devises their means for it is to invent or make something especially through the imagination of it is a repeat of genesis 6 5. and they have all one brother jerry i want to ask you a question in this virtual computer world and estimate how software and things are made how many languages are there at the end of the day there's just one language it don't matter where you live in china russia puerto rico and or united states or wherever they all only use one language zeros and ones can i get a verification brother roger back there all right all right thanks now we got in the mouth of two or three weeks notices now one language using come on now church then you have a bunch of little worlds and everybody's mad because you don't fit in their world no no no no because because you don't tolerate their nonsense you got to put up with everybody's ideologies nowadays that's funny they want you to respect their ideology when a christian stands up for his beliefs can't create hello everybody what does the imagination with the wrong inspiration do converts what god has created or something is you you've got to know the compoundness of it put on your spiritual capsule they don't know what realm they belong to and therefore it comes in the insanity of humanity i want to know what's really happening in the spiritual with god's people this morning worlds are being formed for him to be perverted the formula of creation oh my lord formula are you comfortable with everybody i gotta finish this right watch this now the formula of creation the formula christ has the formula of life has the formula of death writes a prescription don't let these quack drugs try to mess with it they give you too much antidote it won't help peter the apostle peter spoke what was the formula you shall receive it it's a formula formula of life take it or leave it the formula formula when it comes to creation there's three things that entail it if you're writing it down write this down three parts and if you go and trace those three words you'll find them all the way through the scriptures all associated with each other i'm not talking about man's wisdom or knowledge i'm talking about god's wisdom and any time that science breaks things down you understand creation they break it down to the cells to the molecule ala molecules to the atoms protons the neutrons all the way down to the electrons the photons electronics but when it's all said and done electrons they can only go back as far as what is that light loose they can trace it to the light loose that's as far as they can go faster that's why saiyan is not a creator he was all lucifer he was the light bearer but he was not the light he cannot create what's wrong we need some help over here is your is your microphone okay i just can't hear myself okay all right somebody help him hear himself all right all right here we go he was a bearer of lights right amanda there's many people that bear a lot of things i wish i could get this game i hold things but the question is they have light who was that light it was the same one from the beginning it's the same one came and embodied himself in a man what a tremendous thing he wanted to mix the elements his way he wanted to take the ingredients and make his own creations that's what a formula is in a formula that's what a formula is a formula a formula is the authoritative procedure or method that must be followed how many want to know the formula of creation let's see how god created it 3 19. i'm going to go real fast on some of these and just read them in english so that we can save some time the lord by wisdom hath founded the earth and by understanding hath he established the heavens he created the heavens and the earth he founded the earth and the clouds drop down the dew are you getting it what is understanding it's what has been established or perfected in the heavens that's what moses was looking at perfection of it that perfectly he saw the temple in heaven it was perfect that's what understanding is like this what has been established or perfected in the heaven to know how to control the knowledge the second ah okay you're over listening that's a little right that's a little whatever yeah but we know it's basil this is as we're we're we're striving to get to the to the core of this message how could bezel made the tabernacle of furniture the anointing oils think look inspirations i have filled him with the spirit of god oh there's there's this connection in what in k in wisdom in understanding in knowledge and in all manner of workmanship how many of you heard heard brother abraham preach on that point you heard him say who was he talking to aquiles we can say a lot of different things from different angles brother abraham's favorite angle of the problem is is we see wisdom as something out there wisdom has become a person a person i john was was born in sin jesus did not know how could he be saying john let us yeah it becomes us come on yourself god he was talking to his bride that was in him to fulfill all righteousness that's who he's talking to his wisdom notices now my goodness hold on hold on hold on this is these grapes are getting juicy oh my god okay here we go watch this now still with me oh yes that's going to make a little bit of time now hidden wisdom that's what we're talking about which god ordained from before the foundation before the world unto our glory proverbs 9 1 9 10 i'll just read it in english the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the holy is understanding there's the three words again you can't separate them watch this now proverbs 2 6 for the lord giveth wisdom and out of his mouth cometh where's his mouth a prophet out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding isaiah 11 2 speaking of jesus and the spirit of the lord shall rest upon him is that what brother abraham was talking about on friday rested upon him the spirit of the lord and it says the spirit of wisdom understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge of the fear of the lord where you look those three words are associated and i have even heard of thee that the spirit of the gods is hindi so what did he do okay daniel avatar come on church you made an idol of him everybody oh bowing wow those are uh i won't bow to that dinosaur you know my way in canada three hebrew children [Music] since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that he might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding what is it the embodiment oh the embodiment of christ in his body here on earth go ahead and say that the embodiment of christ here on earth let us make man is it brings a creative power in us now i'm going around the corner that when the holy ghost comes into our hearts creative power power of faith you're the son god he just speaks the word and it creates himself that's right his words is the creative power not in some other make-believe world no no word the very voice their very command is creative power because sons and daughters of god would create them a world because out here and go live a private life on it but he hasn't called us to a private life all those you have fellowship but it any kind of power forcing the people to do certain things that doesn't produce power but the word in its rightful place it makes all the difference in the church the atmosphere you take a good woman and a bad man sooner or later the man will become a good man hello everybody hola what type of people are we to be quickly constantly is a few more little things brother we create atmospheres that's right let me tell you what else you can create when the church of the living god gets out of gets to a place all these isms and sensations and everything else here we go let something slip out from the unseen your eyes to happen you don't need to be in a prayer line then no necessity you've got it then if you would say i'll tell you what you have it then instead i pray that something was said today can be a help for you we send it to the hospital where our brother rigo is hospital how many can raise their hands at this moment they have them intubated right now but god has the last word so in the name of jesus christ just repeat after me in the name of jesus christ in the name of jesus christ we as a body of believers believers we send the agent of the holy ghost to our brother eagle brother lord bring the healing now through the lips of your people that are redeemed we now send the agent of the holy ghost in jesus name that's it that'll bring so many we give you an opportunity every time is there somebody here that has never been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ never been baptized anybody here i'm saying that because he's he knows and i know that there are people that have not given their heart to the lord yet is is there anybody here would just raise their hand there's one hand would you come sister to the front it's because he said that you want to give your heart to the lord did you just raise your hand father almighty god lord i didn't pull the sister it's a promise that you made you said all that the father has given me will come to
