[40:01] 27 and then after that we'll read Luke
[40:15] 17263 and God said let us make man in
[40:19] our image after our likeness and let
[40:22] them have dominion over the fish of the
[40:24] sea and over the foul of the earth and
[40:27] over the cattle and over all the
[40:30] Earth and over every creeping thing that
[40:33] creepeth
[40:48] on so God created man in his own image
[40:53] in the image of God created he him male
[40:57] and female created
[41:07] them in Luke 17
[41:12] says and as it was in the days of Noah
[41:16] so shall it also be in the days of the
[41:19] son of
[41:25] man
[41:28] they did eat they drank they married
[41:31] wives they were given in marriage until
[41:34] the day that Noah entered into the ark
[41:37] and the flood came and destroyed them
[41:51] all likewise also as it was in the days
[41:55] of lot they they did eat they drank they
[41:58] bought they sold they planted they build
[42:10] it but the same day that lot went out of
[42:13] Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[42:17] heaven and destroyed them
[42:25] all
[42:27] even thus shall it be in the
[42:29] days when the son of man is
[42:37] revealed Lord
[42:40] Jesus Place ourselves completely under
[42:43] your
[42:46] control may you control every aspect of
[42:49] our
[42:51] being
[42:53] body
[42:55] and
[42:56] father may you till our
[43:01] hearts may your word come and be planted
[43:05] in good
[43:10] soil may your Holy Spirit Quicken the
[43:14] word in our
[43:18] heart you answer the questions that we
[43:23] have we surrender ourselves completely
[43:26] to your Divine will and
[43:32] purpose in the name of the Lord Jesus
[43:34] Christ
[43:37] pray amen amen you may be
[43:47] seated um I'm uh for those that don't
[43:50] know you my name is I mean not those
[43:52] that don't know you yeah for those that
[43:53] don't know you also
[43:56] those that don't know
[43:58] me Bern Garcia
[44:01] jcia j and uh I'm in public announce I'm
[44:06] going to make a pack with my
[44:08] interpreter I usually do this in the
[44:10] privacy of our room but I forgot
[44:15] to uh it might be a little bit different
[44:17] for you interpreting
[44:21] me but uh I like
[44:24] to take turns
[44:29] talking which means I'm GNA wait for
[44:32] you so you can wait for
[44:36] me uh when we're both talking at the
[44:38] same
[44:40] time sometimes it's hard for the
[44:43] monolingual speakers to understand
[44:45] what's being
[44:49] said those of us that speak
[44:54] bilingual we can pretty much
[44:57] understand because we get the first half
[45:00] of the first Minister and then the
[45:02] second half of the
[45:08] interpreter but those who only speak one
[45:10] language only get the first half of or
[45:12] the last half of depending what language
[45:21] they so um if I do get carried away
[45:28] all you have to do is give me the
[45:30] look and I'll understand that I'm
[45:33] breaking my
[45:37] pack
[45:39] um today we're going to just a little
[45:42] thought the son of man
[45:49] revealed so we have the the tense on the
[45:52] on the on the board is a little is a
[45:54] little uh wrong I I was probably
[45:56] slurring when I told him my
[46:01] title but it should end with an ed
[46:08] revealed not reveal
[46:11] it now the son of man ralth yeah that
[46:14] that is an important
[46:18] thought we're not going to try to get
[46:20] into that
[46:24] today just the son of man
[46:29] revealed now when we think of the son of
[46:32] man being
[46:36] revealed it conjures up in my mind
[46:39] anyways in my
[46:43] imagination uh some images of something
[46:48] awesome taking
[46:52] place in the last
[46:54] days in the culmination of the
[46:58] time when it's all coming to a
[47:03] climax the days when the son of man is
[47:10] revealed and so in our minds this must
[47:13] be some great momentous
[47:19] thing and it's it's as
[47:23] simple as uh honey can you stand up for
[47:26] a
[47:30] minute this is my wife letia who's
[47:40] accompanying see it's it's that
[47:44] simple she was hidden from your
[47:48] Viewpoint even though she was right in
[47:50] front of you the whole
[47:54] time and yet yet when she is announced
[47:57] and stands
[48:00] up and then all your attention turns
[48:03] that
[48:06] way then you can
[48:10] see when uh the son of man is
[48:15] revealed remember it's it's something
[48:17] that is
[48:20] hidden but is not going to be
[48:24] revealed or
[48:26] uncovered or exposed to
[48:30] view now when I was a
[48:33] kid my great dream was to be a
[48:41] ninja I wanted to be able to sneak into
[48:44] people's houses and assassinate them
[48:45] without them knowing I was even
[48:52] there I don't know if any of you have
[48:54] ever had that desire but I did I'll
[48:56] admit
[48:59] it I even had a couple of victims picked
[49:04] out so when the Lord saved
[49:08] me and changed my
[49:11] heart my desire to become a ninja went
[49:16] away it was no longer compatible with
[49:19] who I
[49:22] was but I got to admit that one aspect
[49:25] of being ninja still stuck with
[49:30] me and it never went
[49:35] away and that was the art of
[49:41] invisibility see the
[49:43] Ninja can be
[49:46] invisible in a crowd of
[49:50] people and it's not that he turns
[49:54] invisible but he's mastered the art of
[49:57] fitting
[50:02] in of looking like everybody
[50:07] else and and you can't see him you can't
[50:10] find
[50:12] him and that's how God is many
[50:18] times see he hides
[50:22] himself in the
[50:24] simplest
[50:27] but then he reveals
[50:31] himself in that very same simple
[50:36] thing in which he was
[50:40] hiding so we're we're not going to go
[50:42] very long
[50:45] today I I can already tell we're not
[50:47] going very
[50:49] long so I'm going War my son you might
[50:52] want to get a couple of songs ready in
[50:53] your mind to help me out towards the
[51:02] end so when I think of the son of man
[51:05] being
[51:07] revealed everywhere I
[51:09] go all the M churches
[51:13] rather because if I ask a denominational
[51:16] member they had no idea what what to
[51:21] say I said what is the son of man
[51:26] and right away everybody will
[51:28] say prophets Ministry of the
[51:35] prophet and and that is true that the
[51:38] son of man is a
[51:42] prophet but when you when you start to
[51:45] look at how see to me the a prophet is
[51:48] this great being it's it's the
[51:51] mouthpiece of God it's the voice of God
[51:54] for his
[52:01] generation it's the the son of man the
[52:05] prophet going to be
[52:09] revealed and uh what we understand that
[52:12] brother
[52:14] Branham being the prophet to the last
[52:17] Church
[52:20] age the seventh angel
[52:23] messenger the holder the seventh
[52:29] seal that in the last
[52:32] days all the Mysteries that had been
[52:35] hidden and broken up and loose end that
[52:37] were
[52:42] everywhere when this great seventh
[52:46] angel this
[52:48] star this
[52:51] messenger this
[52:52] Prophet the messenger or prophet
[52:55] of the seventh
[52:59] seal when he would begin to sound the
[53:06] trumpet the mysteries of God would be
[53:11] revealed and if the mysteries of God
[53:13] would be
[53:15] revealed that would include the
[53:18] revealing of the son of
[53:24] man and that he would do the same things
[53:27] that God did in the
[53:32] past the same thing he did in the days
[53:35] of
[53:37] lot which was to discern the hearts of
[53:41] the
[53:44] people to foretell the things that was
[53:47] going to
[53:50] happen those things would happen again
[53:53] in the days of which the son of a man
[53:55] would be
[54:01] revealed now
[54:05] sometimes when I go to a
[54:11] place and uh I've been wanting to go
[54:18] there right like Egypt for
[54:21] example I always wanted to see the p
[54:25] pyramids of
[54:29] Egypt in my mind it would be something
[54:34] incomparable one of the eight Wonders of
[54:36] the
[54:39] World it would be
[54:42] amazing and then one day quite
[54:47] unexpectedly I got the opportunity to go
[54:50] to the
[54:54] pyramids and as I stood there and looked
[54:56] up at the
[55:02] pyramids it's a bunch of rocks in the
[55:09] desert yeah they're they're piled up on
[55:11] each
[55:14] other but it didn't come
[55:18] close to matching
[55:21] up with what I thought it would
[55:25] be
[55:29] like and uh I looked closely at the
[55:34] Rocks saw how big they
[55:37] were and I did have to kind of
[55:40] wonder how they lifted those rocks so
[55:46] high but all in all just being there and
[55:48] looking at
[55:52] it it didn't right really seem like a
[55:55] big
[55:59] deal see to the Casual
[56:03] Observer you probably don't look like
[56:06] such a big deal
[56:15] either but when you begin to to Really
[56:18] delve beyond the outer layer of the
[56:23] pyramid
[56:27] and to study what's on the inside the
[56:29] interior of the
[56:34] pyramid and the technology of of how it
[56:36] was
[56:39] created and the possible functions it
[56:41] may have
[56:45] had I mean it could have been anything
[56:47] from a big giant water pump that would
[56:51] irrigated the
[56:53] land
[56:56] it could have been an energy source of
[57:00] some subtle electrical currents that we
[57:02] still do not understand even though
[57:05] we're starting to scratch the surface of
[57:14] them something about it is
[57:19] profound now
[57:21] you there's something about you that is
[57:24] profound
[57:28] and it's it's it's so
[57:31] profound that even you yourself are
[57:35] baffled by
[57:42] yourself why can't I just be
[57:48] happy why do I do the things I don't
[57:51] want to
[57:53] do and why why do I do the things I
[57:56] don't want to
[57:59] do why am I from here and
[58:04] there why does nobody understand
[58:11] me
[58:13] am what's my purpose here on Earth
[58:21] me and we we look for our answers mostly
[58:28] outside of
[58:33] ourselves that's why we will turn to
[58:36] alcohol or drugs or money or to a career
[58:47] popularity we think that there's
[58:49] something outside of us that we're
[58:53] lacking
[58:58] it leaves us in a state of
[59:04] confusion when when we are
[59:09] young and still closer to the Creator if
[59:12] I could say it that
[59:17] way we're filled with
[59:22] wonder we hear the stories of God from
[59:25] our parents and we
[59:32] Marvel it doesn't take a struggle for us
[59:35] to understand God is
[59:41] real heaven
[59:43] exists hell
[59:46] exists right and wrong is black and
[59:53] white
[59:55] the Catholic priest Jesuit priest
[1:00:02] say if we can get the child before he's
[1:00:07] seven if we can get the child before he
[1:00:10] turns
[1:00:13] seven they'll never leave the
[1:00:18] church because they can indoctrinate
[1:00:21] them and instill in them
[1:00:27] I remember we got a call from our our
[1:00:29] son's teacher one
[1:00:33] day a boy was in
[1:00:37] kindergarten and she said I want to let
[1:00:39] you know that today your son gave his
[1:00:41] heart to Jesus Christ in the
[1:00:49] classroom I said what do you mean what
[1:00:53] happened
[1:00:55] he said he looked so sad and
[1:01:01] depressed and I said Daniel what what's
[1:01:04] what's the matter are you
[1:01:08] okay she said no teacher he said no
[1:01:11] teacher I'm not
[1:01:13] okay I have come to realize that my
[1:01:16] heart is full of
[1:01:23] Darkness and she said and so I told
[1:01:27] him you know Jesus can take away your
[1:01:31] heart of darkness and put light in there
[1:01:34] don't
[1:01:38] you he said
[1:01:40] how he said just ask
[1:01:43] him invite him into your
[1:01:46] heart tell him to fill you with his
[1:01:50] light he said after about 30 40 seconds
[1:01:56] his face lit
[1:02:01] up he got a a great
[1:02:05] smile he looked at her there were tears
[1:02:07] in his
[1:02:09] eyes he said
[1:02:11] teacher Jesus
[1:02:14] came and he filled my heart with
[1:02:19] flight and you know we wonder sometimes
[1:02:22] as
[1:02:23] adults
[1:02:25] or maybe we start to pay attention as
[1:02:28] teenagers and we we we understand we
[1:02:31] need to change we need to do
[1:02:35] something we want to serve
[1:02:37] God and somehow we've complicated it so
[1:02:44] much but it seems like a simple
[1:02:49] prayer Lord
[1:02:52] Jesus I give you my heart
[1:02:55] today take the darkness
[1:02:58] out come into my life and fill me with
[1:03:02] your
[1:03:04] light It seems impossible that such a
[1:03:06] simple prayer like
[1:03:10] that could transform your
[1:03:14] life but let me tell you this
[1:03:17] morning if you can believe the simple
[1:03:21] Faith like a
[1:03:23] child
[1:03:25] and make a sincere prayer to
[1:03:29] God it doesn't take a lot of jumping and
[1:03:35] shouting that's not required to receive
[1:03:37] his
[1:03:40] life when you receive his
[1:03:43] life then you let him jump and Shout
[1:03:46] inside of
[1:03:49] you you don't have to manufacture
[1:03:53] anything you don't have to fit into a
[1:03:55] certain type of
[1:04:00] crowd you don't even have to believe a
[1:04:02] word that I'm
[1:04:06] saying you have to believe your own
[1:04:10] word Lord Jesus I give you my heart
[1:04:17] today my heart is full of
[1:04:21] Darkness would you come in
[1:04:24] take away this Heart of
[1:04:27] Mine give me a heart of
[1:04:29] Flesh put your life inside of
[1:04:33] me if you can believe your
[1:04:37] words as you pray a prayer like
[1:04:40] that or whatever prayer that you can
[1:04:43] believe
[1:04:45] in that acknowledges the presence of
[1:04:49] God that acknowledges your state of
[1:04:53] sin
[1:04:54] that confesses your need for
[1:04:58] him it can be long it can be short it
[1:05:01] doesn't
[1:05:03] matter what matters is that your
[1:05:06] soul makes a connection with almighty
[1:05:11] God what makes that
[1:05:14] connection a humble and contrite spirit
[1:05:18] the Lord will never
[1:05:23] reject he will not despise
[1:05:27] him if a man will say in his
[1:05:31] heart I have did the things of the
[1:05:34] world I have tried the worldly
[1:05:38] way I have done
[1:05:41] wrong and it didn't profit me
[1:05:46] anything
[1:05:48] amen if you would just admit
[1:05:51] that God would be faithful ful to save
[1:05:55] him and rescue him from the pits of
[1:06:02] hell why what does that
[1:06:08] do it reveals the son of
[1:06:13] man see it it's not a complicated
[1:06:18] thing to reveal the son of
[1:06:21] man it's a simple thing
[1:06:25] to reveal the son of
[1:06:28] man let's let's uh let's read a few a
[1:06:31] few quotes
[1:06:35] here and God identify by
[1:06:40] characteristics in
[1:06:44] 1964 Jesus said in Luke the 17th
[1:06:49] chapter when in the last
[1:06:52] days God in some dry times speaking by
[1:06:56] the
[1:06:59] prophets in the last
[1:07:02] days by his
[1:07:07] son now watch he said in the time when
[1:07:12] the son of man is being
[1:07:18] revealed this setting of Sodom will
[1:07:21] return
[1:07:22] again
[1:07:25] as it was in the days of
[1:07:29] Sodom so shall it be at the
[1:07:33] coming of the son of
[1:07:37] man when he is being
[1:07:43] revealed made known to the
[1:07:47] church to the
[1:07:51] elect not to Sodom
[1:07:54] or the
[1:07:56] sodomites or the ones down in
[1:08:00] Sodom to the
[1:08:04] elected Abraham was the
[1:08:09] elected and the Royal Seed of Abraham is
[1:08:14] the
[1:08:18] Believers so who is the son of man being
[1:08:21] revealed
[1:08:22] to
[1:08:24] he
[1:08:25] elected
[1:08:27] Abraham and his Royal
[1:08:31] seed the
[1:08:34] Believers
[1:08:36] through Christ Jesus the
[1:08:42] word and is the
[1:08:46] elected let me read that
[1:08:52] again and the Royal Seed of Abraham is
[1:08:55] the
[1:08:58] Believers through Jesus Christ the
[1:09:03] word and is the
[1:09:06] elected are you Believers this
[1:09:10] day then you through the Lord Jesus
[1:09:13] Christ you are the Royal Seed of
[1:09:21] Abraham and when the son of man is being
[1:09:25] revealed that setting would be
[1:09:33] again okay in Jesus Christ the same
[1:09:36] yesterday today and forever
[1:09:42] 52 August the
[1:09:45] 1 while you're getting your things ready
[1:09:47] I want to ask you
[1:09:51] something in Hebrews 1
[1:09:55] 138 the Bible said that Jesus Christ is
[1:09:58] the same yesterday today and
[1:10:04] forever do you believe that's
[1:10:09] inspired amen I believe that is the
[1:10:13] truth that at the Judgment
[1:10:16] day that God will see that that is the
[1:10:22] truth
[1:10:24] Hallelujah read that a little
[1:10:27] slower I believe that is the
[1:10:31] truth this is Brother Brown saying I
[1:10:34] believe that is the
[1:10:39] truth that at the Judgment
[1:10:43] day that God will see that it is the
[1:10:50] truth don't you believe it all right yes
[1:10:55] and now let's just
[1:10:57] wonder what type of a person Jesus
[1:11:06] was remember he's the same yesterday
[1:11:08] today and
[1:11:13] forever now I know we have some
[1:11:16] theological
[1:11:20] ideas and some painters have painted
[1:11:22] pictures
[1:11:26] but let's not look at him in the
[1:11:30] picture form
[1:11:36] tonight because we may not
[1:11:43] know but let's look at him in his
[1:11:52] life his
[1:11:54] spirit so
[1:11:57] Jesus when he comes back to Earth again
[1:12:01] in his body
[1:12:07] form it'll be too late then for us to
[1:12:10] think anything about
[1:12:14] it right so so let's think about it
[1:12:19] now when he comes back in his body
[1:12:22] form
[1:12:25] like the angel said this same
[1:12:29] Jesus that you see
[1:12:32] ascending this same
[1:12:35] Jesus will
[1:12:37] return when we see that body come
[1:12:41] back it'll be too late to start
[1:12:43] wondering what type of person he
[1:12:48] was now we're going with him then
[1:12:55] those that are
[1:12:59] ready how many want to be ready on that
[1:13:01] when he
[1:13:04] comes amen we want we want to be
[1:13:07] ready what does it mean to be
[1:13:10] ready it means we're not confused any
[1:13:18] longer we're not wondering about
[1:13:20] ourselves any
[1:13:22] longer
[1:13:25] I can't tell you how many years I
[1:13:26] suffered under the
[1:13:31] thought am I part of the Bride or the
[1:13:35] foolish
[1:13:40] virgin we don't wonder
[1:13:45] anymore because when the son of man is
[1:13:50] revealed something breaks apart in US
[1:13:55] there's no room for doubt
[1:13:58] anymore there's no wondering our
[1:14:01] position in Christ
[1:14:05] anymore there's no wondering who we are
[1:14:10] anymore because the revealing of the Son
[1:14:13] of
[1:14:15] Man reveals all those things to
[1:14:20] us the mysteries of God become known
[1:14:26] brother Garcia I've been in the message
[1:14:28] 30 years and I and I still have
[1:14:33] confusion I still don't understand
[1:14:36] what's going to
[1:14:40] happen that's
[1:14:44] okay all things are
[1:14:47] possible to he that
[1:14:51] understands oh I see I got some Bible
[1:14:53] readers
[1:14:55] here all things are possible to he that
[1:15:00] believes amen amen you
[1:15:03] believe how can you
[1:15:06] believe unless you know for an
[1:15:12] assur that something is
[1:15:15] true even though you can't see
[1:15:19] it even though you can't he hear it
[1:15:23] even though you can't feel
[1:15:26] it I was telling brother Tommy Jr
[1:15:29] yesterday Tommy j i I was at a point in
[1:15:33] my life that I did not believe in the
[1:15:38] resurrection I did not believe in
[1:15:44] afterlife and I was I was I was in
[1:15:48] depression because my son had just
[1:15:52] died
[1:15:55] and I looked at the scriptures and I
[1:15:58] said this is just a
[1:16:06] story brother Garcia
[1:16:08] really after so many years of serving
[1:16:11] God after so many years of
[1:16:16] preaching sometimes we enter in what is
[1:16:19] called an existential
[1:16:22] crisis
[1:16:27] where we don't believe in
[1:16:30] anything
[1:16:32] existing because we lost track we fall
[1:16:36] into a spiritual
[1:16:40] Amnesia we forget who we
[1:16:44] are we forget what our lives were before
[1:16:47] God came into our
[1:16:51] Liv we forget the the things that God
[1:16:54] has done for
[1:16:56] us that's why it's important to keep the
[1:17:00] testimonies
[1:17:04] alive that's why we read about
[1:17:07] David that's why the stories of Saul
[1:17:09] were written
[1:17:15] down so that we could
[1:17:18] know that we're
[1:17:21] human we are human
[1:17:26] still but I I kept on fighting this
[1:17:34] thought and I began to tell
[1:17:37] myself you might not be able to see that
[1:17:41] the word is
[1:17:44] true you might not be able to see that
[1:17:46] there is a
[1:17:50] resurrection you might not be able to
[1:17:53] believe in in an
[1:17:58] afterlife but the word of God is
[1:18:04] true God cannot
[1:18:07] lie you cannot deny the existence of a
[1:18:13] God because my focus up to then had
[1:18:16] always
[1:18:18] been as brother brandham said in one of
[1:18:20] his
[1:18:21] messages
[1:18:24] I don't know if I'm going to make it to
[1:18:27] heaven but if God was sending me to
[1:18:31] hell I'll still worship him there in
[1:18:36] hell out of gratitude for what he has
[1:18:39] done for me in my
[1:18:41] [Applause]
[1:18:43] life so I never looked at Heaven as a
[1:18:45] goal to
[1:18:47] reach I was appreciated of what God had
[1:18:50] done in my life
[1:18:54] I don't claim to know everything or the
[1:18:57] Mysteries or what
[1:19:01] thought but I do know that one
[1:19:04] day I was lost in
[1:19:07] sin and I gave my heart to Jesus
[1:19:11] Christ and he reached down his
[1:19:15] hand and he saved my
[1:19:18] soul and gave me a portion of his holy
[1:19:21] ghost
[1:19:24] and no matter how dark my life
[1:19:27] gets and how lost I
[1:19:29] am how much Satan is passing me through
[1:19:32] and
[1:19:35] fro how much I'm ready to give
[1:19:39] up it always seems like he makes the
[1:19:42] Fatal
[1:19:46] mistake and he mocks
[1:19:48] me and he tries to
[1:19:51] say and that day that you think you were
[1:19:54] born
[1:19:57] again was just an emotional
[1:20:01] fantasy oh he hits against that
[1:20:07] steak that anchor to which I'm
[1:20:11] anchored that exp spirit that nobody can
[1:20:14] take
[1:20:16] away I said hold it
[1:20:18] there oh you might tell me I'm not
[1:20:21] worthy
[1:20:23] you might tell me I'm a
[1:20:25] loser you might even tell me I'm an
[1:20:28] unbeliever but you can't never tell
[1:20:32] me that on that day I received a new
[1:20:37] [Music]
[1:20:38] birth that I
[1:20:40] was seed to
[1:20:44] be I became a new
[1:20:50] creature what happened
[1:20:54] the son of
[1:20:57] man had been
[1:21:00] revealed hallu what is a
[1:21:04] revealing it's an
[1:21:07] unmasking it's an
[1:21:09] unveiling it's exposing to the
[1:21:12] public what has been
[1:21:15] hidden and let me tell you
[1:21:18] something when the son of man is
[1:21:20] unveiled or revealed
[1:21:24] it doesn't need a public
[1:21:30] showing it's for an audience of
[1:21:34] one you are that
[1:21:38] audience and you see the son of man
[1:21:42] revealed in your life in your
[1:21:49] heartu so Jesus when he comes back to
[1:21:53] Earth again in his body
[1:21:57] form it'll be way too late
[1:22:00] then for us to think anything about
[1:22:04] it you believe
[1:22:06] that we're going with him
[1:22:09] then those that are
[1:22:15] ready okay so we're going to read this
[1:22:17] really
[1:22:19] slow so you can really catch this
[1:22:26] so
[1:22:28] now when we see him in body
[1:22:35] formu no matter
[1:22:38] whether he's a white
[1:22:41] man a yellow
[1:22:44] man or black
[1:22:48] man or brown
[1:22:51] man
[1:22:53] whatever he
[1:22:54] is he's my
[1:22:59] [Applause]
[1:23:04] savior you know the scripture says if
[1:23:07] you see your brother
[1:23:12] ER you go you talk to him and you turn
[1:23:16] his ways back to the
[1:23:21] Lord know assuredly you have rescued
[1:23:27] him and save a
[1:23:36] soul Who's your
[1:23:41] Sav yeah I I know it's
[1:23:44] Jesus he paid the
[1:23:47] price but who talked to
[1:23:50] you what color was the skin of the man
[1:23:55] Hallelujah LED you to the feet of Jesus
[1:23:57] [Applause]
[1:23:59] Christ hallelujah
[1:24:02] hallelujah what does the son of man
[1:24:07] do he does the works of the Son of
[1:24:12] God it was the son of
[1:24:15] God standing on
[1:24:17] Earth who said to his
[1:24:21] disciples who do men
[1:24:25] say that I the son of
[1:24:33] man he was the son of
[1:24:36] God in human
[1:24:40] form the son of
[1:24:42] man and he said why do you get upset
[1:24:46] that I say I'm the son of
[1:24:51] God did not your teachers call them whom
[1:24:54] the word of God came to
[1:25:02] Gods when you think of the son of
[1:25:06] man and you think of a
[1:25:09] prophet because the son of man is a
[1:25:13] prophet it's who the son who the word of
[1:25:17] God has come
[1:25:20] to cuz the word of God always comes to
[1:25:24] the
[1:25:27] prophet to the son of
[1:25:31] man what are you saying brother
[1:25:34] Garcia are you trying to say you're a
[1:25:38] prophet I'm more than a
[1:25:45] prophet that's right in this
[1:25:48] generation I wasn't called to hide in a
[1:25:51] COR of the battle raised around
[1:25:58] me fear had its grip on my
[1:26:04] throat and I fell into such a spirit of
[1:26:08] bondage of
[1:26:13] fear and I couldn't think of what to
[1:26:17] do I couldn't
[1:26:20] escape I called my buddy Tom
[1:26:24] Tom and he said Bernie Bernie listen to
[1:26:28] the service on

[1:26:33] on
[1:26:35] Wednesday and I heard Pastor Caleb
[1:26:38] saying you were chosen for this
[1:26:43] day for this
[1:26:46] age just take up the sword of
[1:26:50] faith and slay the
[1:26:53] enemy oh hallelujah hallelujah why are

[1:27:00] trenches when the enemy lies before
[1:27:04] us take up your
[1:27:07] sword cut left and
[1:27:10] right the
[1:27:13] enemy that's what we were called
[1:27:17] for light came out of
[1:27:20] Heaven ENT turned to my
[1:27:23] heart and the fear went
[1:27:27] away the doubt went
[1:27:29] away and discouragement went
[1:27:33] away everything went
[1:27:36] away I was left with
[1:27:39] peace and
[1:27:41] Assurance not that everything will be
[1:27:44] okay no that I could die on the
[1:27:50] battlefield in honor and Glory
[1:27:54] and God would be my eternal
[1:27:57] reward what can this world give
[1:28:00] us what can we fear of
[1:28:04] lost nothing we're not of this
[1:28:08] world how do you

[1:28:26] man whatever he is brother Ram says
[1:28:29] whatever he
[1:28:30] is he's my

[1:28:47] him I love him so
[1:28:50] much I love him with all oh
[1:28:56] my don't you just remember those
[1:28:59] times when you lay in the throws of
[1:29:05] defeat somehow you dragged yourself to
[1:29:07] the Church of
[1:29:10] God and maybe some L on
[1:29:14] nobody came up and preached the word of
[1:29:18] God and something stuck your heart
[1:29:23] and delivered
[1:29:25] you to to we never forget those
[1:29:29] moments we can't forget the ringing of
[1:29:31] those words in our
[1:29:32] [Applause]
[1:29:35] heart God didn't put us here to be a
[1:29:37] bunch of
[1:29:41] cowards he put us here because he
[1:29:44] knew we could overcome the forces of
[1:29:50] Darkness
[1:29:52] why are you jealous of Moses and Daniel
[1:29:56] and Israel and
[1:30:00] Isaac why do you wish you lived in their
[1:30:04] days oh what a great hero you would have
[1:30:08] been greater is the battle
[1:30:12] today than they ever
[1:30:15] faced when we get to
[1:30:17] heaven we'll go up to want to hear their
[1:30:20] testimonies
[1:30:23] and they'll tell us no no
[1:30:25] no first you tell
[1:30:27] me how did you overcome that 21st
[1:30:32] century oh because the son of man
[1:30:38] [Applause]
[1:30:47] revealed he says I love
[1:30:49] him with all my heart
[1:30:53] and now
[1:30:55] he but what he
[1:30:57] was it wasn't so much as the
[1:31:02] flesh but the flesh is
[1:31:05] wonderful it was virgin
[1:31:07] born you believe
[1:31:11] that I believe that almighty God
[1:31:14] overshadowed the Virgin
[1:31:18] Mary and created a blood cell in the
[1:31:20] womb of Mary
[1:31:25] my
[1:31:28] God he says bful
[1:31:34] sometimes it wasn't so much as the
[1:31:40] flesh but the flesh was
[1:31:44] wonderful it was virgin
[1:31:48] born you see that separation
[1:31:53] between you and Jesus
[1:31:56] Christ we've made it a great
[1:32:02] golf we've made it an a barrier that we
[1:32:05] can't
[1:32:07] overcome see we can't really be like
[1:32:12] Jesus because he was virgin
[1:32:17] born we were born in the body of sin and
[1:32:20] flesh
[1:32:25] but what he
[1:32:27] was it wasn't so much as the
[1:32:31] flesh but the flesh was
[1:32:34] wonderful it was virgin
[1:32:36] born I believe that God Almighty
[1:32:39] overshadowed the Virgin Mary and created
[1:32:41] a blood cell in the womb of
[1:32:48] Mary but he's basically saying
[1:32:52] that's not the great
[1:32:57] thing that that's not what he
[1:33:03] was then he goes and talks about the
[1:33:05] German life and how it came and how it
[1:33:08] was virgin born and the argument he had
[1:33:10] with a
[1:33:15] man great story by the way you you want
[1:33:18] to read it it's
[1:33:20] wonderful
[1:33:25] man he says he was a great
[1:33:32] person
[1:33:34] her
[1:33:37] son Hallelujah it was a great
[1:33:44] person
[1:33:47] literally conforming the
[1:33:50] son
[1:33:53] person are you a
[1:33:56] person you're a person
[1:33:59] right you're a human
[1:34:04] right by the way interesting side
[1:34:06] note does anybody here know can you tell
[1:34:10] me what the Hebrew word for human
[1:34:20] being
[1:34:22] no you all know it you read it all the
[1:34:24] time in the
[1:34:29] Bible the Hebrew word for human
[1:34:34] being is
[1:34:38] Adam when the Bible tells that he
[1:34:40] created Adam in his own
[1:34:46] image it's like say he he he said he
[1:34:49] created the human beings
[1:34:53] his
[1:34:55] own that's why he says male and female
[1:34:58] created he them
[1:35:05] plural but in English we just use the
[1:35:07] same word we didn't translate it we use
[1:35:10] the word Adam in our
[1:35:15] Bible Adam means human
[1:35:19] beings why is that important
[1:35:23] because if he created him in his own
[1:35:26] image he created him
[1:35:29] spirit Spirit
[1:35:31] God and everything that Spirit
[1:35:36] God that he called man
[1:35:39] was we we
[1:35:42] are you know when brother bam talks
[1:35:44] about the
[1:35:48] condens of the
[1:35:50] self-existence
[1:35:52] nothing
[1:35:54] existed not Darkness not life not space
[1:35:56] not
[1:36:00] vacuum nothing but
[1:36:03] eloh and this
[1:36:09] thinking and I don't know how many years
[1:36:13] in our
[1:36:17] time because there wasn't even
[1:36:20] time but it must have been trillions and
[1:36:22] trillions and trillions of our
[1:36:26] years because before he even spoke the
[1:36:29] first creative
[1:36:33] word he had already perfectly designed
[1:36:38] you and how many hairs you would
[1:36:41] have and what day you would be
[1:36:45] born and how many hairs you would lose
[1:36:47] and on what day you would lose
[1:36:50] them
[1:36:52] and how many extras he would have to
[1:36:54] create in his movie so that you could
[1:36:55] have people around
[1:37:01] you you know what I mean by extras
[1:37:04] right see each one of you are the
[1:37:06] individual stars of your
[1:37:11] movie and in your
[1:37:13] life I'm just an
[1:37:18] extra before he spoke the first creative
[1:37:20] word of there be
[1:37:24] light he knew everything about
[1:37:27] you and so he planned that I would be
[1:37:29] here
[1:37:31] today to speak to you sitting there in
[1:37:34] the
[1:37:37] chair but you were the entire focus of
[1:37:44] that you say well that doesn't really
[1:37:46] kind of make
[1:37:47] sense because there's too many people
[1:37:49] here who are stars of the movie
[1:37:54] well to to put it in a simplistic
[1:38:01] way when the composer amadas would sit
[1:38:06] down he put a sheet of paper in front of
[1:38:11] him he would begin to hear the music in
[1:38:13] his
[1:38:16] mind and he would write down each
[1:38:20] note
[1:38:21] he only had to write it down
[1:38:25] once he didn't have to
[1:38:29] edit every note that the
[1:38:34] flute and how the the violin would come
[1:38:37] in at a certain
[1:38:40] time and how the saxophones would would
[1:38:43] come in in
[1:38:45] focus and the notes that the piano would
[1:38:49] play whether it would Be
[1:38:52] chords for
[1:38:54] harmony
[1:38:56] Melody all these things he would write
[1:39:00] down and that that's what we have here
[1:39:04] today A
[1:39:07] composium of a small
[1:39:09] section of great
[1:39:13] orchestra that God has
[1:39:16] constructed of which we are but ausc
[1:39:18] part of
[1:39:20] it
[1:39:21] because all across the
[1:39:26] globe the same part of the symphony is
[1:39:30] being
[1:39:33] played each one doing their
[1:39:37] part all together making a melodious
[1:39:39] sound to our Creator
[1:39:44] God each part
[1:39:49] important now we didn't in the Bible he
[1:39:52] was a great
[1:39:54] person not his physical
[1:39:57] makeup but what he was in his spiritual
[1:40:02] makeup he was the son of
[1:40:05] God so Elohim then
[1:40:09] El after he thought all
[1:40:12] this he couldn't stay away from it any
[1:40:17] longer the desire to fellowship with us
[1:40:22] grew so
[1:40:24] great it burst out of
[1:40:27] him let there be
[1:40:30] light what what what came into
[1:40:34] existence
[1:40:38] light now could we see it with
[1:40:42] invisibilized no we couldn't see it with
[1:40:46] visible but it was there
[1:40:48] nevertheless the Greek Scholars call it
[1:40:50] the Logan
[1:40:53] it was the word of
[1:40:55] God it was the son of
[1:40:57] God like a son playing before the
[1:41:00] doorsteps of his father's
[1:41:05] house get to just throw things
[1:41:10] around playing around he created the
[1:41:15] universe the
[1:41:17] galaxies and he he made a mess
[1:41:22] just just like your children do they
[1:41:24] make a
[1:41:26] mess you say no brother Burnie what you
[1:41:29] mean he made a
[1:41:31] mess the Bible tells us that he made a
[1:41:35] mess in the beginning God created heaven
[1:41:39] and
[1:41:40] earth in the beginning was the
[1:41:43] word lust and the lust was with God and
[1:41:46] the loest was God all things were made
[1:41:49] by him
[1:41:51] not a thing was made that was not made
[1:41:53] by
[1:41:55] him for in the beginning the logus
[1:41:57] created the heavens and the
[1:42:01] Earth just playing
[1:42:04] around he made a
[1:42:07] mess and the spirit of
[1:42:10] God the world was without form and
[1:42:16] void and in
[1:42:18] chaos and the word of God hovered over
[1:42:22] the face of the
[1:42:25] waters and then brother Bram says and
[1:42:30] now the work of
[1:42:34] creation
[1:42:39] began how could that be the beginning of
[1:42:41] the works of
[1:42:44] creation everything before that was
[1:42:49] play
[1:42:53] yeah God can create when he's
[1:42:56] playing who knows how many millions of
[1:42:58] years he created
[1:43:00] for who
[1:43:04] knows but then it came time to go to
[1:43:09] work you ever notice your kids they can
[1:43:11] play all day every day
[1:43:17] 247 and when they're really small one or
[1:43:20] two
[1:43:22] time to go to bed I don't want to go to
[1:43:24] bed I'm not
[1:43:26] tired no you got to go to bed it's
[1:43:30] bedtime and you make them go to
[1:43:32] bed it seems like the minute their heads
[1:43:35] hit the pillow they're
[1:43:41] out they got all
[1:43:43] tired playing they don't know
[1:43:47] it they're playing they don't get tired
[1:43:52] but after seven days of work of
[1:43:57] creation six days man this is hard
[1:44:00] work I'm going to
[1:44:03] rest on the seventh
[1:44:05] day
[1:44:08] rest that
[1:44:11] logos was the son of
[1:44:17] God and then El
[1:44:22] and the Son of God had a
[1:44:25] conference and he said let us make man
[1:44:27] in our
[1:44:30] image he created
[1:44:33] Adam Spirit
[1:44:36] man always remember Adam means human
[1:44:41] beings you want to find yourself in the
[1:44:43] creation of
[1:44:45] God there you go you you are you are
[1:44:49] Adam
[1:44:52] and then God brother Brown says that was
[1:44:56] the third
[1:45:08] part
[1:45:10] man is the third part of the Trinity of
[1:45:13] God is
[1:45:15] the it says God what is it God
[1:45:18] manifesting himself
[1:45:22] in the
[1:45:24] logos the same God manifested himself in
[1:45:28] the
[1:45:31] logos then that same
[1:45:34] God manifesting himself in man Spirit
[1:45:40] man and through Spirit
[1:45:43] man begins to govern the
[1:45:47] Earth the same way
[1:45:51] the Holy Spirit should be governing the
[1:45:53] church
[1:45:56] today so the spirit
[1:46:00] man brother B equates him to the Trinity
[1:46:04] Holy
[1:46:06] Ghost the third Office of the deity of
[1:46:11] God but it's the same
[1:46:14] God Elohim El that existed by
[1:46:19] himself then manifested himself in the
[1:46:23] logos then manifested himself in
[1:46:28] Adam or human
[1:46:31] being no wonder he said where Were
[1:46:35] You
[1:46:37] Remember come on you can do
[1:46:40] it where were
[1:46:42] you when the sons of
[1:46:44] God out for
[1:46:46] joy as I plac the stars in the heaven
[1:46:52] how were they shouting for
[1:46:55] Joy they were
[1:46:57] playing you shout for Joy when you're
[1:47:00] playing all those things happened when
[1:47:03] the logus was
[1:47:07] playing who was he playing
[1:47:13] with okay sorry he was the son of
[1:47:18] God he went
[1:47:21] around and he healed the
[1:47:23] sick the lame yall believe he did
[1:47:27] that well
[1:47:29] now did he do it at his
[1:47:37] leisure Oh I thought I'd catch you on
[1:47:39] that but I
[1:47:40] didn't good teacher brother
[1:47:43] Bose who been teaching we went in no he
[1:47:46] didn't do it at his
[1:47:49] leisure he
[1:47:51] said it's not me that doeth the
[1:47:56] works it's my
[1:47:59] father wait a minute I thought it was
[1:48:02] the son of God in human flesh doing the
[1:48:06] work excuse me the Son of God in human
[1:48:11] flesh manifesting the office of the son
[1:48:14] of
[1:48:15] man healing the
[1:48:18] people but yet he said it's not
[1:48:21] me that doth the work it's the
[1:48:25] father
[1:48:29] amen him being the Son of
[1:48:33] God did not claim to be a Divine
[1:48:39] healer is that right he said that's the
[1:48:43] father no flesh is before
[1:48:49] God
[1:48:51] it was the father that
[1:48:55] did now when when the son of
[1:48:58] man when when brother
[1:49:01] Branham operated the ministry of the son
[1:49:04] of
[1:49:07] man revealing back to
[1:49:11] us the word of
[1:49:13] God Jesus Christ the son of
[1:49:17] God all he was doing
[1:49:21] was making a bridge path
[1:49:27] backwards to Elohim a
[1:49:32] Elohim brother Braham says these these
[1:49:35] mysteries in the book Feast of the
[1:49:40] trumpet these great
[1:49:42] Mysteries that were brought in our
[1:49:46] day
[1:49:48] Vindicated by Jesus Christ himself doing
[1:49:50] the same work that he
[1:49:53] did proving himself the same yesterday
[1:49:56] today and
[1:49:58] forever and the reason why these
[1:50:00] Mysteries were
[1:50:05] brought was so that we would know how to
[1:50:09] live our daily
[1:50:19] life
[1:50:20] so he revealed
[1:50:23] something what did he
[1:50:26] reveal how we should live our daily
[1:50:33] life but that's just too simple for
[1:50:37] us we want something much more
[1:50:40] complicated than
[1:50:42] that much more glorious or more
[1:50:45] mysterious more
[1:50:47] woess
[1:50:49] glor
[1:50:54] what is the son of
[1:50:56] man he that the word of God has
[1:51:04] come you know your you're your founding
[1:51:07] pastor of
[1:51:10] Thomas I know you've heard him
[1:51:15] say said I don't have a
[1:51:18] gift
[1:51:20] of God I have the
[1:51:31] gift what what what are we talking about
[1:51:35] here who the word of God Has
[1:51:42] Come has the word of God come to
[1:51:48] you has it revealed to
[1:51:51] you position in
[1:51:53] Christ or you still trying to take
[1:51:55] someone else's
[1:51:59] place are you still struggling and
[1:52:01] wrestling with the scriptures to try to
[1:52:03] understand something that's not for you
[1:52:05] to
[1:52:09] understand I was talking with brother
[1:52:11] Tommy yesterday he said something just
[1:52:13] spark the
[1:52:18] line you know where one body in Christ
[1:52:22] Jesus and he's coming back for his
[1:52:28] body she has dressed herself with every
[1:52:32] word of
[1:52:35] God you know sometimes I think we we try
[1:52:38] to put the veil on our
[1:52:43] head and maybe you're the
[1:52:45] head and then you put the veil on your
[1:52:48] head and then you think oh that's not
[1:52:51] all the
[1:52:53] word and then you put your shoes on top
[1:52:55] of your
[1:52:57] head and then you put your underneath
[1:52:59] clothing on top of your
[1:53:01] head and then you put all your dress on
[1:53:04] top of your
[1:53:05] head because I'm the head and I have to
[1:53:08] be dressed with every word that comes
[1:53:10] out of the mouth of
[1:53:13] God I think that we have a lot of gloves
[1:53:15] on the feet of the body of Jesus
[1:53:18] Christ
[1:53:22] we have a lot of shoes hanging in our
[1:53:25] ears and we think we're waiting for the
[1:53:28] last lost one to come
[1:53:32] in but maybe we're just
[1:53:35] waiting for the last member of the body
[1:53:37] of
[1:53:39] Christ to get itself in its own
[1:53:46] place Lord
[1:53:48] Jesus take away my
[1:53:51] confusion fill me with your
[1:53:54] light show me your will in my
[1:53:57] life that's what your Mysteries came
[1:54:01] for so I could know how to live my daily
[1:54:06] life how do I live my daily
[1:54:10] life every born again
[1:54:13] Christian has the right to hear the
[1:54:16] voice of God
[1:54:18] directly
[1:54:21] make yourself a little closet
[1:54:25] room go into
[1:54:27] there don't let anybody bother
[1:54:30] you close the
[1:54:32] door ask God your
[1:54:36] question tell him how great he
[1:54:39] is ask him your
[1:54:42] question and then shut your mouth and
[1:54:48] listen
[1:54:51] amen and you will hear the voice he's
[1:54:53] obligated he
[1:54:59] said it might take a half
[1:55:03] hour take an hour I take a day or two
[1:55:07] might take some
[1:55:09] weeks might take 21 days like it did for
[1:55:16] Daniel but he will have
[1:55:18] to
