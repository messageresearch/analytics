[40:12] that a child will be born soon the king
[40:14] of the Jews did I just hear you both say
[40:17] that you are following a star I have

[40:41] no King C we are looking for the king of
[40:44] the Jews we have been following a star
[40:47] and it led us somewhere nearby we
[40:49] believe we close wait there's the king
[40:51] of the Jews since when we have been
[40:53] studying the stars for so many years and
[40:56] all of a sudden and one appears it was
[40:58] it was like a messenger trying to tell
[41:00] us something a messenger that's a good
[41:03] one we do believe the Stars a son from
[41:06] God that your child would be born the
[41:08] king of the Jews not the not just the
[41:10] king of the Jews the King of
[41:13] Kings well continue to follow the star

[41:20] exactly so I may come and worship him
[41:22] too yes of course your majesty
[41:31] my king Do You Really Want To Worship
[41:33] the so-called King of the Jews what of
[41:36] course not I must get rid of this king
[41:38] of the Jews immediately list see
[41:58] have you have you seen the star haven't
[42:01] seen
[42:03] nothing have you seen the
[42:08] star please raise your hand if you've
[42:10] seen the star has anybody here seen a
[42:12] star that's brighter than all the others
[42:15] we've been looking for so
[42:20] long I guess we're going to have to find
[42:22] it by ourselves
[42:27] look there it is there it is there it is
[42:28] there it
[42:33] is Bethlehem but they walked out the
[42:37] gate and when they left that city of
[42:40] Darkness the light appeared before him
[42:43] again the star appeared in the Bible
[42:45] said they Rejoice with exceeding great
[42:48] joy they must have actually shouted a
[42:51] little they
[42:53] rejoiced with exceeding great joy
[42:58] they were
[43:00] overwhelmed the star had appeared to
[43:03] lead them to their final destination of
[43:06] their
[43:07] Journey they followed it now they know
[43:10] it hangs lower than it used to it's just
[43:13] a little closer
[43:14] now and finally as they went along
[43:17] rejoicing and praising God through the
[43:19] night Amen Let by the hand of the Lord
[43:24] the fire of the star come to a little
[43:26] state
[43:28] which was a little place in the side of
[43:30] the Hill a cave and there the star
[43:33] rested over the C Hallelujah and these
[43:38] Mighty mag eyes over a year and six
[43:42] months in their Journey on their road
[43:45] traveling watching following nothing nor
[43:48] other direction but the
[43:51] star and when it rested they went in and
[43:54] there they found the Babe Jo jph and
[43:58] Mary and they brought gifts from their
[44:01] Treasure Chest amen they offered unto
[44:04] him gold breaking sense and
[44:06] mirror if we just had the time let's
[44:09] stop a minute what did the goal
[44:11] represent he was a
[44:13] king he wasn't to be made King he was
[44:16] born
[44:18] King he was God the Eternal King
[44:44] as the wise men slept that night an
[44:46] angel appeared and warned them not to go
[44:48] back to King carara to tell them him
[44:50] where the Savior
[44:54] was I had the strangest dream last
[44:58] night so did I I never dreamed but last
[45:01] night I saw an angel that told me to go
[45:03] home and not talking heard anything
[45:05] about Jesus I had the exact same dream
[45:08] truly this is a dream from the Lord and
[45:10] King herro wants to kill Jesus we'll go
[45:12] home another way let me check my Google
[45:15] Google Maps for another way
[45:24] home
[45:25] guard
[45:27] guard yes yes have you found this
[45:31] so-called King of the Jews yet no
[45:34] there're just some so much children all
[45:36] right uh forget about him for one tiny
[45:38] little second um what about the wise men
[45:40] have our spice seen where they went I
[45:42] can't believe no one thought about
[45:43] putting an air tag on them before he
[45:44] left some
[45:47] people no so the wise men went to
[45:51] Nazareth and then they came back but
[45:53] they went home but don't worry anything
[45:57] good come out of of Nazareth no not
[45:59] really um but still I'm not taking any
[46:02] chances take the entire worldy guard and
[46:04] slay all the children in the Kingdom two
[46:06] years and under yes so King Herod
[46:10] decreed that all the children two years
[46:11] and under would be slain the lord gave
[46:14] Joseph A Dream in which he warned him to
[46:16] take Mary and Jesus to Egypt where Jesus
[46:18] would be saved Mary I had a dream from
[46:21] the Lord it is safe to return home now
[46:24] King Herod has died and nobody is
[46:26] searching for Jesus finally we can
[46:29] return to our homeland from Jesus we are
[46:31] going
[46:33] home so the King of Kings returned home
[46:36] and Jesus increased in wisdom and
[46:38] stature and in favor with God and man
[46:40] saving the Lost Healing The Sick and
[46:42] Performing Miracles and there are also
[46:44] many other things which Jesus did the
[46:47] which if they should be written in
[46:49] everyone I suppose that even the world
[46:51] itself cannot contain the books that
[46:53] should be written

[53:23] it an eternal sign
[53:27] the super signs of all
[53:30] signs God becoming one of
[53:43] us coming down to earth means that God
[53:47] gave his life so I could be BN again
[53:50] everything too it means Christ saving me
[53:53] and coming down to save me he bring me
[53:56] Redemption and he me he's going to me he
[53:59] fulfill the promise that he had made for
[54:01] me he CH me it means a lot to me knowing
[54:05] that someone loves and cares for me that
[54:08] deeply Christ is coming to Earth meant
[54:11] that when Satan tried to seal my life
[54:12] with an incurable illness and no hope
[54:15] his birth death burial and Resurrection
[54:17] meant that by his stripes I could be
[54:19] healed and have a hope for a future uh
[54:22] it means that he's coming down to redeem
[54:24] his bride I means that Christ came down
[54:27] to earth to redeem me and show his love
[54:28] to me what Christ coming down to earth
[54:31] means to me is that he came down as
[54:33] flesh to show his unconditional love
[54:36] even when I felt unlovable the coming of
[54:38] Christ means everything to me knowing
[54:40] that he is the Holy Spirit the holy
[54:43] spirit is my compass to my way back home
[54:46] and when I got into the good way I am
[54:49] right now and found uh God or G Jesus
[54:53] Christ uh into my life and put me in
[54:56] better path um Christ coming down to
[54:58] earth for me made me feel like I wasn't
[55:00] forgotten and showed um unconditional
[55:02] love more like a light at the end of the
[55:06] dark tunnel like when things seem to get
[55:08] hard and you just got to keep on walking
[55:10] and pushing forward and he's he's
[55:13] something that you look forward to
[55:15] seeing someone that you look forward to
[55:17] seeing and um yeah he's everything what
[55:21] Christ coming down to earth means to me
[55:23] was that the Creator came down to become
[55:25] my savior and present friend what Christ
[55:27] coming down to earth means to me is he
[55:30] came down from glory to become nothing
[55:31] so that I could become something in him
[55:34] he means to me that he's going to save
[55:36] every single one of us like it truly
[55:39] means to me is that God predestinated
[55:41] and knew that I was going to choose him
[55:43] first before he came down and that's why
[55:46] he came down to save us as well well I
[55:49] want last but now I'm found uh he pulled
[55:52] me out of the myy clay redeemed Me by
[55:54] his specious blood and call me his own
[55:57] God Lov me so much that he came to Earth
[56:00] and through his life he paved the way to
[56:02] my Redemption um Christ coming down to
[56:04] earth is like a second chance um for him
[56:07] it was like no words can describe how it
[56:10] how it is cuz he you know he he he went
[56:13] on the cross and died for my sins and uh
[56:16] when the Lord took my mom it kind of
[56:18] made me want to love him more and more
[56:20] um every day and it just really inspired
[56:23] me open my eyes a little bit to become a
[56:25] better Christian have a better
[56:27] it means to me that he's coming back to
[56:29] bring Redemption and that he's coming
[56:31] back to get his ride and just take me
[56:33] home that he came down to die for me to
[56:36] that way all my sins would be washed
[56:38] away what Christ coming to Earth means
[56:41] to me is that I can overcome any trial
[56:44] in my life with
[56:46] him Christ coming to Earth meant
[56:48] NeverEnding love and grace Christ knew
[56:50] the sins I would commit and the mistakes
[56:52] I would make and he still came for me
[56:54] his never- ending love and grace
[56:56] Christ coming down for Earth meant my
[56:58] freedom and he gave me a chance at his
[57:03] word which meant a Christ it
[57:07] means like God like God gave His only
[57:11] begotten son
[57:13] to pay for a
[57:16] sin that's it what Christ coming down to
[57:20] earth meant to me is that he became me a
[57:22] broken spirit so that I could become him
[57:25] his holy spirit
[57:27] what Christ coming uh down to earth
[57:30] means to me it means uh gave me a shot
[57:33] at eternity give me a chance to live
[57:35] forever with them and also to form a
[57:38] relationship with him Christ coming down
[57:40] to earth to me means that
[57:43] he he put his pain put his own life to
[57:48] have pain that you can't even understand
[57:51] and that I can spend one day in eternity
[57:54] with him
[57:57] gave me a chance because without him I
[58:00] there would be no chance I can make
[58:02] it Christ coming down to earth means to
[58:05] me is he came to this earth called
[58:07] Reuben and he repaired restored and
[58:10] renew Jesus come down to earth has
[58:14] adjusted my soul to where it needs to
[58:18] be what it means to me is that God loved
[58:21] me so much that he left his throne in
[58:23] glory to become a man just like me me to
