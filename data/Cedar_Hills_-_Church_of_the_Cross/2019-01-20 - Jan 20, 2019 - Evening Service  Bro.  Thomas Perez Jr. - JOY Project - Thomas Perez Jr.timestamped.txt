[16:37] my
[16:40] heart uh to do something for our joy uh
[16:48] people we we we called it the joy
[16:54] project and uh we we've always looked
[16:57] around us and we we see our elderly
[17:03] people and let us call them our mature
[17:08] people but to put all those words to the
[17:10] side we've just used the acronym of Joy
[17:13] or just older
[17:19] youth you know right now they they they
[17:22] do say that uh Michael Jordan's about 54
[17:26] years old
[17:29] there is no doubt in his heart that he
[17:31] can beat any player that is alive
[17:36] today his his body just won't permit
[17:40] him I I I always I I I I always think
[17:43] about
[17:45] ourselves and as the time goes
[17:49] by I I we we first we're we're inspired
[17:54] by our people of what keeps them going
[18:01] I always wanted to feel and and and
[18:04] understand why is it that that people
[18:07] how is it that they came to know the
[18:11] Lord and what is it that would make
[18:13] sister Carmen drive all the way from
[18:16] Silver City to be here on a Sunday
[18:21] morning it's got to be something that
[18:24] that that moves
[18:26] you something that inspires
[18:29] you that motivates you and that gives
[18:32] you the faith to keep on
[18:35] going and each one of these these people
[18:37] that we are going to portray tonight and
[18:40] on
[18:44] Wednesday in my book they are the heroes
[18:47] of our
[18:49] faith and I think we deserve to give or
[18:52] they deserve for us to give
[18:59] each one of them has showed me how to
[19:01] live a Victorious and Christian
[19:07] Life they are the shoulders that we
[19:10] stand
[19:13] on Cedar Hills Church of the Cross would
[19:16] not exist without these
[19:21] people their faithfulness is
[19:26] unmeasurable their continuation of the
[19:29] word of God that has been brought To Us
[19:31] by our
[19:35] Prophet is the foundation where we are
[19:38] built
[19:40] upon what they have taken from the
[19:44] gospels and made it
[19:47] alive is what makes this church an
[19:50] active
[19:52] church we are not a church that just
[19:54] comes to to service on Sundays to fill a
[19:58] pew
[20:02] we matter in this
[20:05] world I want us to know as Cedar Hill's
[20:07] Church of the
[20:12] cross the world would not be the same
[20:15] without
[20:17] you we are according to the word of
[20:21] God we know where we get our faith and
[20:24] we know where we get our life and our
[20:26] light
[20:30] and our life has continued and the light
[20:32] of the Gospel has continued to shine
[20:34] through
[20:38] us I want want every young person to
[20:43] know these people are not
[20:46] actors you're going to see a film
[20:49] tonight they are not actors they're
[20:53] living breathing human
[20:56] beings with the spirit of God inside of
[21:00] them that'll take them to the greater
[21:05] Hereafter and still with the heart of of
[21:08] coming to serve the
[21:12] Lord when I when I hear as as I hear our
[21:15] older musicians
[21:19] play and I hear Brother Tony just
[21:21] playing that
[21:24] piano I know that there is a God
[21:27] someplace
[21:29] the Bible speaks to us that there is a
[21:32] deep calling to the
[21:34] deep and if there is a deep calling
[21:37] somebody's got to
[21:40] respond we don't look for Heroes outside
[21:43] the
[21:45] world Our Heroes live right
[21:48] here they are the people that have have
[21:51] spawned this
[21:54] generation they are the people like my
[21:56] uncle Abraham that you heard this
[21:57] morning
[22:01] like my uncle Mike we can go on and
[22:04] on but you will see them and you will
[22:08] hear
[22:10] them with their own words tell you what
[22:13] Christ means to
[22:17] them that is what inspires
[22:20] us that's what takes us to
[22:23] Uganda is the foundation upon where we
[22:26] are built
[22:29] now I I I want us to
[22:32] understand that without without purpose
[22:34] in
[22:36] life it's difficult to
[22:39] live if you didn't know which way to
[22:42] go you would know what to
[22:46] do these people have showed us the
[22:50] way I I I seen the the life in the
[22:53] ministry of my my
[22:55] pops and I got to spend a little bit of
[22:58] time with him
[23:00] today and you know when when my boy
[23:04] prayed for
[23:06] him and he starts
[23:09] crying there there is something about
[23:12] it that that the devil can do anything
[23:15] that he that that he wants to with the
[23:17] will of
[23:19] God there is something inside the soul
[23:22] of the human
[23:24] being that is God himself
[23:28] God pours himself inside of
[23:31] you when you hear the word of
[23:35] God something's got to do something to
[23:37] your
[23:38] life I want to thank all of our young
[23:42] people that that that took this to their
[23:46] hearts and really believed what these
[23:49] these people were
[23:52] saying when you want to know what a man
[23:55] looks
[23:56] like how he acts
[23:59] we see our people that are going to be
[24:02] portrayed when you see a woman of how
[24:05] real lady should
[24:08] act we're going to see real ladies here
[24:11] in this
[24:13] film we're not going to see people like
[24:15] we see in the
[24:18] world that's not
[24:20] normal this is the word of God it's only
[24:24] for Supernatural
[24:26] people and as we we thank the young
[24:30] people I want to thank you for taking
[24:33] your

[27:44] you as a great writer
[27:47] said remember thy Creator in the days of
[27:50] thy youth while the evil days come not
[27:52] nigh then Thou shalt have no pleasure in
[27:55] it how Lord Jesus you said to Peter when
[27:58] when you were young you got up and went
[28:00] where you wanted to but when you get old
[28:02] someone packs you where you would not go
[28:04] let them remember now is the day this is
[28:07] the time grand
[28:13] father how did you come to know the lord
[28:17] well in
[28:19] 1962 in October I got discharged from
[28:23] the
[28:24] Army and
[28:26] uh after I got this charge
[28:30] uh I uh two weeks later I got baptized
[28:35] in the Apostolic Church in uh in Demi
[28:39] with my brother Michael the pastor there
[28:42] and then
[28:44] uh cuz I had to get baptized in order to
[28:47] marry your grandma Ruth CU she was she
[28:51] was a Christian and I
[28:53] wasn't so after I got baptized
[28:58] on November the
[29:00] 24th we got married in a twoone Arizona
[29:05] and that's how I started my
[29:08] journey as a
[29:10] Christian I didn't come into the message
[29:13] until
[29:14] 1972 because I did not have
[29:18] revelation of the baptism though I did
[29:21] get baptized in the name of of Jesus
[29:24] Christ but because that's what they told
[29:27] me I had to do not that I had Revelation
[29:30] but once I came into the message then I
[29:33] had to get re-baptized again and I got
[29:37] re baptized the third question is when
[29:40] did you accept the message of the hour
[29:44] there was in
[29:45] 1972 uh the one that we used to hear
[29:48] tape of Bernie Garcia we used to go to
[29:52] Silver
[29:53] City and uh we I even used to steal
[29:58] books of brother Brenham from uh your
[30:02] Uncle Mike and I would read a message
[30:05] every time I went to work uh instead of
[30:08] going to to the little house where we
[30:11] ate all the workers in P I would stay in
[30:14] the truck even at night with a
[30:15] nightlight and read a book of brother
[30:18] Brenham me and the founding Pastor Tommy
[30:22] used to go very often maybe sometimes
[30:24] twice a month to
[30:26] Phoenix and get tapes and book from
[30:29] Brother Bernie Garcia which brother
[30:31] Bernie Garcia was our my first tutor for
[30:35] me and uh and your uncle Tommy when did
[30:39] you um meet the founding pastor and when
[30:43] when did you start going to the cedar H
[30:46] Cedar Hills Church of the Cross well the
[30:49] I'm older than the P Pastor by two years
[30:53] so he had to meet me
[30:55] first so
[30:58] we were we were of all my brothers we
[31:01] were seven brothers me and him were the
[31:03] closest you know when we were all in the
[31:07] world I used to be the leader he
[31:10] followed me like my shadow everywhere
[31:14] and we were so close we were B we went
[31:17] slept together in the same bed in hand
[31:19] over when we became Christians and he
[31:21] became Pastor then he was the leader he
[31:25] was the spiritual leader and I followed
[31:27] him
[31:28] until right now what makes you keep on
[31:32] going the Bible says he that end doth
[31:35] Until the End shall be saved this is not
[31:40] a part-time thing this is a uh like when
[31:44] you get married to your wife until until
[31:46] death do we part you know it's until the
[31:50] Lord takes us away I mean so we want to
[31:53] be there you know follow the lord cuz
[31:55] there's no other way there's no other
[31:58] life there's no other Joy I
[32:01] mean what else is there to do I mean but
[32:05] to follow God he lead us all the way to
[32:08] the pro Promised Land you know to
[32:11] me to live is Christ and to die again I
[32:15] love him until you know like brother Ben
[32:20] says he will send me to hell I would
[32:22] still love him my all my love I don't
[32:25] want to lose like say because you have
[32:29] left the first love that first love is
[32:34] the word of God because it's the only
[32:36] thing that will take us out of this
[32:37] world how do you maintain maintain your
[32:41] relationship with the Lord and your
[32:44] brothers and sisters in Christ just
[32:46] being faithful you know the respect that
[32:51] the people have for me is not a gift of
[32:54] God it's a victory you have to earn it
[32:56] you have to earn the respect
[32:58] you know and now at my age you
[33:01] know the people look up to me not
[33:06] because it's because they see that
[33:09] Christ in me that I have been faithful
[33:11] all these years you
[33:13] know so I uh that's why I consecrate
[33:17] myself so because I have to be
[33:20] responsible as I Minister the word that
[33:23] I preach I have to answer to God in that

[36:07] seino introduced the Lord to her in
[36:10] between 1989 and 1990 she was baptized
[36:13] by Brother Jimmy in the river at this
[36:16] time she also received the Holy Ghost
[36:18] she received the message of the hour
[36:20] around the same time in the early '90s
[36:22] she would visit the church in Silver
[36:24] City where she met our founding Pastor
[36:27] what keep keeps her going she says that
[36:29] God has taken care of her at all times
[36:31] even through the most difficult ones she
[36:33] says that God has always been her
[36:35] provider and even when she had no money
[36:38] somehow she always found what she
[36:42] needed she never has a spirit of
[36:44] hopelessness she is always persistent
[36:47] and that's her key to life and her
[36:49] source of success comes from

[37:25] greetings here's a short video video of
[37:28] her sending greetings God bless
[37:44] [Music]
[37:51] you well hello again God bless you my
[37:55] name is Elizabeth and I'm to interview
[37:59] and my first question is um how did you
[38:03] come to know the Lord Jesus hi I came to
[38:06] meet the Lord when I was like around 20
[38:10] and I was going to the Church of
[38:12] Christ how did that happen uh through a
[38:16] friends that were going to the church I
[38:18] got invited to one other service and
[38:21] from there I I started there and I
[38:23] stayed there for I think maybe a year
[38:26] and then I drifted out out went back
[38:28] outside to the world and then until like
[38:32] around when I was like 27 28 my brother
[38:36] went to Silver City se he moved over
[38:39] there and then he he became
[38:43] um introduced to the message of the the
[38:46] evening and then he he brought it to us
[38:49] you know here at home with their mom
[38:53] that's how we
[38:54] started and then what year were you best
[38:57] baptized and what year did you receive
[38:59] the Holy Ghost oh I don't
[39:03] remember I sure don't remember that but
[39:06] I had a picture but I I couldn't find it
[39:09] and brother um Ray uhuh Ray was the one
[39:11] that baptized
[39:14] me and so would you say that around that
[39:17] same time you accepted a message of the
[39:19] hour or a bit before yes at that time I
[39:23] started and then we just kept on cuz it
[39:25] was fresh meat for me I hadn't listen or
[39:28] heard
[39:29] anything of such where we went before
[39:33] they they preached the gospel but this
[39:35] was was more revealing it it show me
[39:38] more uh hidden mysteries in the Bible
[39:42] yes okay so when did you meet our
[39:46] founding pastor and started attending
[39:48] Cedar Hills Cedar Hills when we went to
[39:51] baptized we got baptized up there in C
[39:54] oh okay and then and so that's kind of
[39:57] like how from yeah tell me all right and
[40:02] then what is it that makes you keep on
[40:05] going just the Lord because there's
[40:08] nothing else you know that's very true
[40:10] there's nothing else you know like the
[40:12] Bible say or the Apostle said where
[40:15] could we go to or who who could we go to
[40:18] when he was saying if you want to leave
[40:20] leave who could we go
[40:21] [Music]
[40:22] to and then how do you maintain your
[40:25] relationship with the Lord Jesus reading
[40:27] and praying and going to church and you
[40:30] know sometimes with the sisters what
[40:32] what would you say is your key of Life
[40:35] key of life is just you know the
[40:39] mentality you know with the Lord you
[40:41] know get him out praying and he's the
[40:44] one that's going to guide you through
[40:45] the day and whatever the situation is
[40:48] going to be he's going to be there
[40:50] regardless and he's the one he's the
[40:52] main goal you know just to because he's
[40:56] the only one
[40:57] that keeps us
[40:59] going okay I would say the same thing I
[41:03] agree with you a lot in that and what
[41:05] what's your favorite song your favorite
[41:07] favorite song oh I love all the songs
[41:09] mostly but I like the one like

[42:17] around there what is it that keeps you
[42:19] guys going like running with the message

[43:41] it right here and then the voice told me
[43:45] don't worry is nothing is
[43:49] there and I I turned around and nobody

[54:52] your favorite me message of brother BR
[54:55] the serpent see the world is falling
[54:59] apart
[55:01] um
[55:04] what being a
[55:06] Christian what what advice as a husband
[55:10] as a wife a parent a grandparent what
[55:13] what advice would you give well the
[55:16] basic is to go to church keep going to
[55:18] church and pray and pray together and
[55:22] reading the word of
[55:24] God uh talking to your k kids about the
[55:27] Lord or bringing them to church and be
[55:30] faithful to your husbands obey the word
[55:32] all the
[55:37] time so one of the first questions that
[55:40] they gave us uh was how did you all come
[55:42] to know the Lord
[55:44] Jesus how we came yes you want go first
[55:49] okay well I was going to a Pentecostal
[55:53] church
[55:54] uhhuh and and a sister that was in the
[55:58] message started coming to the
[56:01] church
[56:03] and when she mentioned brother brandom
[56:06] being the prophet I said well I want to
[56:09] know more about him and she would you
[56:13] know give me some tape to listen to and
[56:17] books to
[56:17] [Music]
[56:19] read
[56:21] and I lived in Douglas Arizona which is
[56:25] a Border Town
[56:26] next to our
[56:29] Prieta
[56:31] and when I finally left that church we
[56:34] left that
[56:35] church there was a message Church there
[56:38] in a
[56:40] pra and there was another Spanish
[56:44] sister we went to that church and she
[56:47] would interpret for us
[56:51] mhm but then
[56:53] my they brought they brought in that
[56:55] doctor of Two
[56:58] Souls polygamy and the new name of his
[57:03] brother Brandon instead of
[57:07] Jesus well it was it was weird
[57:11] because first the Spanish
[57:15] sister she she got out of the
[57:19] message and then the older one Rosie she
[57:23] moved somewhere
[57:26] and then they closed the smelter and
[57:29] Douglas and we moved to
[57:33] Hurley and that's what started
[57:35] everything you know I had the I found
[57:39] the address for the silver Church in the
[57:43] Yellow Pages so that I started going
[57:47] there and that's
[57:49] it and what year were you baptized and
[57:52] when did you receive the Holy Ghost 19
[57:56] 1987 1987 I started going to the church
[57:59] in silver mhm getting the Holy
[58:05] Ghost
[58:08] well since it's a
[58:11] process i' I'd say
[58:15] mainly after 1995 because I had to get a
[58:18] divorce mhm as soon as I and then
[58:23] later maybe
[58:28] it it's hard to tell
[58:30] because you can't specifically say well
[58:33] there's day in this month
[58:36] because you know you just you're just
[58:38] receiving word upon word it's a process
[58:44] so but when we moved here to Las Cruses
[58:48] MH that's when everything opened up big
[58:52] time Amen to that yeah so we re we
[58:57] really came into the Holy Ghost once we
[58:59] moved here uhhuh and when was
[59:04] that we I think we moved
[59:07] here about 2007
[59:11] mhm 2008 somewhere around there it's
[59:15] going on 12 years going on 12 years just
[59:18] about yeah somewhere there yeah that's
[59:20] hard hard to believe that yeah cuz we've
[59:23] been married 17 or 18
[59:28] 17 that's close
[59:31] enough and uh when you met our founding
[59:35] pastor and started when did you meet our
[59:37] founding pastor and started attending
[59:39] Cedar Hills Church of the cross that was
[59:41] when you said when you to Sil that's
[59:43] when I met in yeah 1987 yeah and how
[59:47] would you all say that you maintain your
[59:49] relationship with the Lord Jesus and
[59:51] your brothers and sisters in Christ well
[59:53] I guess we pray for each other and
[59:57] when we get an opportunity we we
[59:59] Fellowship you know outside the
[1:00:03] church you try to talk to people after
[1:00:06] church you
[1:00:08] know that that's the only thing I can
[1:00:10] think of and uh what would you all say
[1:00:13] is the key to life for you since we're
[1:00:17] elected to be in this
[1:00:22] message you know I guess my key would be
[1:00:26] be being grateful mhm that God could see
[1:00:32] who I really was and MH you know that I
[1:00:36] would that I would become a a part of
[1:00:40] the Bride
[1:00:44] yes and what would you say is your
[1:00:46] source of success well now it's my
[1:00:50] husband you know cuz when I was single I
[1:00:53] had a hard time especially mhm Financial
[1:00:58] uhhuh it mostly Financial cuz I I
[1:01:01] never I'm not a working type person
[1:01:05] yeah so it was really hard for me to get
[1:01:09] a decent job or to work around people
[1:01:13] you know just just having the ministry
[1:01:16] that we have and the pastor that we have
[1:01:19] and the and the Holy Ghost all that's
[1:01:23] the key uhhuh
[1:01:30] how did you come to know the Lord oh how
[1:01:33] did I come into the message yeah it was
[1:01:36] around the early early year the early
[1:01:39] '70s
[1:01:40] and we were going uh Tommy Pettis uh
[1:01:45] senior was the the pastor of the
[1:01:49] apostolic church and and Chu the
[1:01:51] consequences and that was the first time
[1:01:55] that
[1:01:56] I think uh he uh brother Mike had been
[1:02:00] talking brother Mike Pettis had been
[1:02:01] talking to him and
[1:02:03] he he told him a little bit about the
[1:02:06] message and and so he he uh shared it
[1:02:11] with some of us CU not everybody
[1:02:14] accepted it but he shared it with some
[1:02:15] of us and uh and
[1:02:19] uh I think what happened was that that
[1:02:24] uh he uh
[1:02:27] he started getting the message and then
[1:02:30] then you know shared it with us of
[1:02:32] course and and then we didn't well I
[1:02:35] personally did not understand it or
[1:02:38] didn't really know you know if it was
[1:02:41] true or not and so that night the
[1:02:45] service was dismissed we went home and
[1:02:49] and I had a
[1:02:50] dream that the Lord said spoke to me and
[1:02:55] said
[1:02:56] uh do not hesitate to believe what you
[1:03:00] have heard to be
[1:03:04] true and so from there on I said oh I
[1:03:07] want more of this I want to learn
[1:03:09] more and and then from there I think we
[1:03:14] we uh we uh left the the church and we
[1:03:17] started meeting in in in places in
[1:03:20] different places
[1:03:26] um do you uh remember the year you were
[1:03:29] baptized or when you received the Holy
[1:03:32] Ghost well I'll tell you what I didn't
[1:03:34] receive the Holy Ghost until after we
[1:03:37] came into the message because uh I I I
[1:03:41] was a
[1:03:42] Baptist and and I didn't of course they
[1:03:47] didn't know what the Holy Ghost was
[1:03:48] either so so uh I received it after we
[1:03:52] came to the message and and uh but when
[1:03:56] that
[1:03:57] was what year it was I guess in the
[1:04:00] early probably the early
[1:04:05] 80s
[1:04:07] um do you remember when you accepted the
[1:04:10] message of
[1:04:11] the
[1:04:13] well in the early' 70s early '70s
[1:04:16] mhm um uh when did you meet the founding
[1:04:19] pastor and attended Cedar Hills Church
[1:04:21] of the cross
[1:04:26] when did I Mee him yes well and Tru the
[1:04:29] consequences he was uh he was married
[1:04:32] married to my sister
[1:04:33] by and and then you know we were we we
[1:04:37] would visit a lot I would visit them a
[1:04:40] lot cuz we lived around the same area
[1:04:43] and and but of course you know he was
[1:04:46] still the pastor of the apostolic church
[1:04:48] and and uh so that's when when we
[1:04:53] met um how do you make maintain your
[1:04:56] relationship with the Lord and other
[1:04:58] brothers and sisters from in Christ how
[1:05:01] do I maintain it
[1:05:03] yeah I would think by you know staying
[1:05:08] you know staying in staying as close to
[1:05:10] the word as I can and and
[1:05:14] uh I don't know what
[1:05:18] else um what do you think the key to
[1:05:22] life is for you for me yeah
[1:05:26] the key to life for me is serving
[1:05:28] serving God just serving God with all my
[1:05:31] heart that's all that I know I've known
[1:05:33] for the last 40
[1:05:37] years all right now these are just more
[1:05:39] simpler now simple questions um what is
[1:05:42] your favorite Christian song oh my
[1:05:48] gosh
[1:05:51] um I guess I could say my favorite
[1:05:55] Christian song song is
[1:05:57] um is uh the song that I sing every once
[1:06:02] in a while would be thank you Lord for
[1:06:06] your blessings on
[1:06:08] me um what is your favorite brother
[1:06:11] Brown

[1:06:16] there's not a message that I don't I
[1:06:19] could say why I know every Everything
[1:06:21] cuz I learn every time I hear a message
[1:06:24] I I I learn something
[1:06:28] um any advice on for anybody on being a
[1:06:33] Christian oh my
[1:06:36] goodness
[1:06:40] uh uh being a Christian it it just uh
[1:06:45] giving your whole heart to God you know
[1:06:48] putting God first in everything and and
[1:06:51] serving you serving him with with all
[1:06:54] your heart
[1:06:56] and to the time that that no nothing
[1:07:00] else
[1:07:05] matters how did you come to know the
[1:07:08] Lord Jesus I was born into a Christian
[1:07:11] home and attended Rosen Creek
[1:07:13] Pentecostal church until the age of
[1:07:16] 16 July the 16th 1970 just before my
[1:07:20] 17th birthday I was invited by my sister
[1:07:24] Jeffy who was visiting with us that day
[1:07:27] to go home with her since it was summer
[1:07:30] vacation and stay a few days in Gina
[1:07:33] Louisiana I knew her motive was trying
[1:07:36] to save me but God was working on both
[1:07:39] ends he had been dealing with my heart
[1:07:42] for some time already but somehow I
[1:07:45] couldn't completely surrender to
[1:07:47] him somehow I knew I had to make a
[1:07:51] decision that it was
[1:07:53] time so I went with her and attended
[1:07:56] church with
[1:07:57] her and my other two older siblings who
[1:08:00] were living there also were also living
[1:08:03] there at the time they had all recently
[1:08:06] relocated to Gina because of a a non-
[1:08:10] denominational church that taught a
[1:08:12] Doctrine called The Serpent seed and
[1:08:15] also that you should come out of
[1:08:18] denomination so the second day I was in
[1:08:20] Gina was a
[1:08:22] Sunday and from that time
[1:08:26] that I entered the door the presence of
[1:08:28] the Lord surrounded me two young sisters
[1:08:31] sang a
[1:08:32] song I'll never forget it and it was
[1:08:35] called he really cares about you and
[1:08:39] while they were singing I totally
[1:08:41] surrendered everything to God my friends
[1:08:45] the way I
[1:08:46] dressed my
[1:08:48] makeup my school even separation from my
[1:08:52] home and other close family members
[1:08:56] but I didn't care all I wanted was for
[1:08:59] God to live inside of me and to serve
[1:09:02] him with all of my heart my whole life
[1:09:05] changed instantly and two months later I
[1:09:09] met my husband brother Tony and 8 months
[1:09:12] later we were
[1:09:15] married I had been baptized at a very
[1:09:18] young
[1:09:19] age but was re-baptized into the message
[1:09:23] in
[1:09:24] 1977 I met brother Tommy in 1977 at
[1:09:28] brother Nick castile's Church in bar New
[1:09:31] Mexico but my husband had known the
[1:09:34] Pettis family since he was a child back
[1:09:37] in the Apostolic Church it wasn't until
[1:09:40] 1986 that we started attending Cedar
[1:09:43] Hills Tabernacle the S the first service
[1:09:46] we attended was brother Pedro Pet's
[1:09:50] funeral and since that time we attended
[1:09:53] we started attended us attending Cedar
[1:09:56] Hills regularly commuting many years
[1:09:59] from Lordsburg New Mexico the funeral
[1:10:02] service was so inspiring for us and the
[1:10:04] presence of the Lord was so real that my
[1:10:07] husband told me as we left the parking
[1:10:09] lot of the church that day that we would
[1:10:12] be attending Cedar Hills and from then
[1:10:15] until now we're still here what keeps
[1:10:18] you going he is Jehovah Jara and he
[1:10:22] provides all my needs he's my Savior My
[1:10:26] Healer my guide my counselor my peace my
[1:10:31] Hiding Place he's everything to me and
[1:10:35] he keeps me going what is the source of
[1:10:37] your success I realize that I'm nothing
[1:10:41] on my own I can't stand alone I depend
[1:10:45] on him for strength every breath I take
[1:10:48] I can't face one day without him because
[1:10:51] he lives I can get through today and I
[1:10:54] Can Face Tomorrow
[1:10:55] what's your favorite message of brother
[1:10:57] brandham I love all the messages of
[1:11:00] brother brandham but I have really
[1:11:02] learned a lot from the church Age series
[1:11:05] I have heard them over and over again
[1:11:08] could you give some advice on how you're
[1:11:11] a Christian wife a parent and a
[1:11:14] grandparent well my advice on being a
[1:11:16] Christian especially to to the younger
[1:11:19] generation would be to remember thy
[1:11:22] Creator in the days of thy youth I
[1:11:24] believe there is a special blessing when
[1:11:26] you give your heart to him at a young
[1:11:29] age I did and I have not even one day
[1:11:33] one hour or one moment ever regretted my
[1:11:36] decision or look
[1:11:40] back oh how the Christian loves to do
[1:11:44] it he doesn't do it with a a grudge he
[1:11:48] does it with the feeling that he loves
[1:11:50] God and he's glad he can do it it's a
[1:11:54] joy to serve the Lord Jesus it's a joy
[1:11:57] to sacrifice it's a
[1:12:00] joy to Worship the Lord It's a joy to be
[1:12:05] called a fanatic for the kingdom of
[1:12:07] God's sake it's a joy to take a stand
[1:12:10] for the right and move from the
[1:12:14] wrong joy to praise him it's a joy to
[1:12:18] abstain from the things of the
[1:12:20] world in their heart it's a perfect limb
