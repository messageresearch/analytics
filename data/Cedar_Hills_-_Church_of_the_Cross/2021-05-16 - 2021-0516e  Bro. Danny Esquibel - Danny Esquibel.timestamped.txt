[40:33] so if david one day
[41:18] all right we'll see if you're with me
[41:19] when i'm done
[41:22] let's open our scriptures real quick
[41:26] to deuteronomy 30
[41:29] verse 14 verses
[41:35] when you have it you can say amen
[41:39] it says here but the word of the lord
[41:43] is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth and
[41:45] in thy heart
[41:46] and thou mayest do it
[41:53] verse 14 guys that's going to go to 15.
[41:56] see i have set before you this day
[41:58] life and good
[42:29] and the lord thy god shall bless thee in
[42:31] the land whether thou goes to possess it
[42:38] but if an indian heart turn away
[42:46] but shall be drawn away and worship
[42:48] other gods and serve them
[42:54] i denounce unto you this day that ye
[42:56] shall surely perish
[43:00] and that you shall not prolong your days
[43:02] upon the land
[43:03] no problem whether thou pass it over
[43:08] jordan to go to possess it
[43:09] on the vice passengers
[43:19] [Applause]
[43:36] that both thou and thy seed may live
[43:52] and you need to decide whom you're going
[43:54] to serve
[43:57] the bible says here as we just read
[44:01] before i have i have set before thee
[44:06] life and death that seems like a
[44:09] no-brainer right
[44:12] right nothing to think about right life
[44:20] but what are we going to choose tonight
[44:24] let's go over to first peter 5
[44:28] chapter excuse me chapter 5
[44:35] and we're going to read verse 6.
[44:39] starting with verse 6. and as you read
[44:42] in your bibles i'm going to be reading
[44:43] it to you from uh
[44:45] from uh another version
[44:50] alrighty so it's verse 6 versus says
[44:54] if you bow low in god's awesome presence
[44:57] he will eventually
[44:58] exalt you as you leave the timing in his
[45:02] hands
[45:15] and leave them there
[45:19] and leave them there for he always
[45:21] tenderly cares for you
[45:30] verse
[45:32] it says be well balanced and always
[45:35] alert
[45:39] because your enemy your brother
[45:46] i got it wrong be well balanced and
[45:49] alert because your enemy your sister
[45:52] says no no
[45:55] your enemy the church down the road
[46:08] [Applause]
[46:11] incessantly
[46:17] like a roaring lion looking for its prey
[46:20] to devour
[46:25] take a decisive stand against him
[46:30] and resist his every attack
[46:35] with strong vigorous faith
[46:40] now we just found out who our enemy is
[46:42] right
[46:45] is it your brother is it your sister
[46:49] no all right it's the devil now i want
[46:52] everybody to participate
[46:54] i
[47:08] oh
[47:21] how are we going to
[47:36] he's
[48:17] you must read your bible
[48:46] he lives in our house he is our compadre
[48:51] right but the bible says
[48:55] resist him you gotta resist
[49:28] christos
[49:57] or am i going to just let the day go by
[50:02] who's your enemy this morning
[50:06] right right who's our enemy
[50:10] now many false anointings shall arise
[50:14] muchos both anointings
[50:18] says many false christs and we're
[50:21] anointed every day
[50:24] you can be driving
[51:20] right
[52:16] but where is that anointing
[52:19] [Music]
[52:21] because we see jesus then when he was
[52:24] tempted of the devil
[52:27] here was jesus who was the world made
[52:30] flesh
[53:09] [Music]
[53:12] a plane no we don't break a plate
[53:17] right now
[53:21] we don't break a plate okay let's see if
[53:24] we don't break a plane
[53:37] may i drop this little thing here for
[53:39] you brother
[53:42] um if the devil can keep us separated
[53:49] he's got us shooting at one another so
[53:56] he's got an open target
[53:57] anywhere he wants to shoot he has an
[54:00] open target
[54:02] on blanco
[54:06] and what's the use of shooting equally
[54:08] so
[54:22] if you want to
[54:36] us but we want a blessing right
[54:42] and to get a blessing when a man has
[54:45] done you
[54:46] wrong
[54:49] and he has absolutely justly
[54:52] absolutely i mean he has done you wrong
[54:58] and you know that he's done you wrong
[55:02] he's done you evil
[55:18] you take him to prayer
[55:21] before god and take it away
[55:29] of just a selfish and don't take it in a
[55:32] way of just
[56:14] lord
[56:28] and not say well i'm supposed to do this
[56:33] but stand in the presence of our god
[56:37] our father praise
[56:40] our prayer should be
[56:56] and i don't see why he did it
[56:59] then let god go to talking to you
[57:03] and you'll see maybe what that man's
[57:07] been through
[57:09] the devil has twisted him up somewhere
[57:11] and caused him to do that
[57:13] [Music]
[57:16] no he's absolutely wrong okay
[57:20] before you leave before you leave the
[57:23] throne of god
[58:04] even if he's a rank sinner
[58:20] may
[58:35] let's see what that weapon can do
[58:41] it says now god knew this great warfare
[58:44] was coming on
[58:47] between right and wrong
[59:30] he wouldn't say i'll give him something
[59:32] here
[59:35] and a few years later given something
[59:36] different
[59:39] he said but if if they would have just
[59:41] stayed fortified
[1:00:54] then you'll take
[1:01:22] with the
[1:01:27] [Applause]
[1:01:50] but jesus said it is written
[1:02:01] in him back to the word
[1:02:46] what the bible says
[1:03:42] it was
[1:04:12] [Applause]
[1:04:24] determined
[1:04:27] [Applause]
[1:04:32] he gave you a bastard
[1:04:42] [Applause]
[1:05:06] is
[1:05:32] who knows how
[1:05:36] [Applause]
[1:05:48] it'll
[1:05:50] [Applause]
[1:06:02] foreign take decisive stand against him
[1:06:06] and resist his every attack
[1:06:12] with strong vigorous faith
[1:06:16] for you know that your believing
[1:06:17] brothers and sisters around the world
[1:06:19] are experiencing the same kind of
[1:06:21] trouble
[1:06:28] first peter chapter 5 verse 10.
[1:06:43] [Applause]
[1:06:56] take a decisive stand against him
[1:06:58] because you're brothers and sisters
[1:07:00] around the world
[1:07:02] are experiencing the same kind of
[1:07:04] trouble
[1:07:06] and then after your brief suffering
[1:07:10] the god of the god of all loving grace
[1:07:16] who has called you to share in his
[1:07:18] eternal glory
[1:07:21] his eternal glory
[1:07:26] christ
[1:07:37] [Music]
[1:07:41] he will set you firmly in place
[1:07:45] and build you up
[1:07:48] and he has all the power needed
