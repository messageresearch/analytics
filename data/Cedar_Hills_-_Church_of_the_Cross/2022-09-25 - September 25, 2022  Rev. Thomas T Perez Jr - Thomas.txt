said it before and I say it again this church would not exist in the form and shape that it exists today without him it would not exist today so we're grateful to God for him and his family as they take care of him as he takes care of us I don't I don't I don't have nothing profound to tell you this morning I I just want to encourage you we we we had a a wonderful couple of weeks we got to go see brother IRA and sister Carol Foster music and if anybody ever wants to go and see them they are such a uh just a great couple is they are part of a a a great part of foundational part of our church here and we had ourselves a great time in the Lord with them God bless you brother and sister carols we got to we drove over there on Wednesday came back on a Tuesday and uh then on two days later we were in Mexico City those days and we're grateful to God that he gives us the the the the energy and he gives us the desire to serve the Lord there are people that watch these Services all around the world I hinted communities of services I'm so happy that brother Jimmy I was able to accompany brother Jimmy and and we had our ourselves quite a time in the Lord and they all greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ as well as Brother Juan Antonio Tamayo from from Guadalajara greets you know and he's watching right now and God bless him and his family God bless our brothers from Uganda that are watching us right now and and around the world where they are watching God bless you I I've taken this portion of scripture because I love the Lord and I'm sure you do too yes you would not be here if you didn't love the Lord and and we're grateful that you are here you know I I you you take a lot of things of uh in life and you that have children you're really responsible to how they turn out you say is amen I gotta say that one more time you really are responsible for how they turn out you know the Bible says train up a child in the way that he should go you should know how your child is going to go man see how simple it is this morning but you get a lot of your traits from your family I have been blessed by God that I never have to look outside of my home for a hero you don't know you saw one of them preach behind this desk last Sunday I don't have to go outside of my family to look for my heroes foreign or maybe your mother and these are my mama's last written words you might you might know him but there might be people here that don't know them last words that she wrote down on paper this was when she was already there with her cancer and they're in the very last of her times and she writes this is to God be all the glory Gloria for all things I'm feeling very grateful to the Lord For All His blessings I don't know where to start because he keeps adding more because first the most precious thing that I have is the desire to serve the Lord I thank God for my salvation though I don't understand about my sickness I thank God that I'm never alone God is always there just when I have a question and even even there even though he doesn't always answer okay I I am I'm I'm just thankful that he is there words cannot tell or describe this was the lady that that was stricken with cancer is and as far as I know just a little while later she passed on to be with the Lord you know those things get handed off to your to your children the way you view service when you come to the house of the Lord the way you act when you come the way you worship it is impossible to love anybody else it is impossible to like anybody else the Bible says that God so loved the world this is what he had created this is this was this the man which was his ultimate creation foreign but you know when we come to the house of the Lord I thought I taught my boys but you say man you say Amen hahaha when you fire a gun does it go off foreign or do we say as the term says in the world do we go up half um when I see people worship God and they're looking at the at the ceiling you're not engaged when people walk in and they're like this and they're they're they're they're corvatas like that you don't know where you're at because laughs but when you come to the house of the Lord you go to you go to the restroom that's why we have a restroom s and in the restroom you have a mirror yeah to make sure you're tired straight to make sure your hair is combed make sure that you look half presentable you know why because this is the house of the Lord around man right correct this is the house of the Lord you are going to meet God here you say well brother you know I I bring him with you how does he travel does he like where he lives I I say all of this for a purpose you say brother it doesn't matter how you dress it doesn't matter it's about your heart and I say Amen but you know when you're gonna go to the bank and you really want alone you kind of look your best when you're going to uh to a to a nice restaurant you want to look your best thing when you come to the house of the Lord you want to look your best not only here but when you come to the house of the Lord and you come in yanin is you don't know where you're at if you come in here to do your manicure you're in the wrong place if you come here to talk about your brother you're in the wrong place but if you come here as soon as you open the doors he says welcome to the house of the Lord come with expectations that expectation yes I expect a sales got to be born inside of the person coming to church because there's nothing else to do you know that's why that's why I give Jerry brother Jerry a hard time and he's because sometimes he says well we could be doing other things puedo Bueno man I wish I had somebody to preach to this morning he is good looking as well that is mercy endureth forever when when when we when we do this God's got to show up you know Wednesday has got to be the most powerful prayer meeting I've ever been in in my life I I was I was there and there there in in my my my living room wherever My Den there in a in Silver City the power of almighty God just get in here you know you know why it comes through expectations if you go to McDonald's you are expecting a hamburger you still buy a McDonald's yes or no see or no yes yes yes yes yes if you go to a bar you expect a certain thing you go to the house of God because he lives here what can be the key because his mercy endureth foreign foreign adoration you know we always pray p-r-a-y right we're going to pray do you wanna you wanna p-r-a-i-s-e phrase thank you Lord all right all right all right yeah you know we're always like this give me give me give me give me give me something and it's overflowing overflowing we don't even know what the blessing because we can't even catch up because your cup is small you want to receive more make your cup bigger Grande you're not you're not getting it this morning you want more of God make your cup bigger Grande you don't want it you're gonna locate it make your cup bigger Grande come on Isaac practice this is how big your cup is that's the reason come to the house of the Lord if we do this number now she was just a new middle you don't want anything you said no kidding now when you come to the house of the Lord Brother when you come to the house you raise up your hands son Something's Gotta happen you know why why Emma Henry do you say do you want the praise of p-r-a-i-s-e okay and then and then I caught it right away and I said absolutely absolutely thank you Lord gracias well to make matters there was a man from Colorado amen offered cash for my house foreign [Applause] so brother Henry that's the p-r-a-i-s-e report is [Applause] now watch this Cain worship but it wasn't according to the word of God through the word of the Lord the Pharisees worship but not according to the word of the Lord now this puts us in a in a in a kind of a precarious situation because Lucifer in heaven was the director of the of the praise or the worship he was the director of the worship so it kind of puts me as a as a worship leader a kind of you kind of think well how are we going and this is what brother Branham Venom Cain worship but it was not according to the word of the Lord so when our worship is according to the word of the Lord it produces the presence of God you know I love when you add the adjectives when you when you come to to the Lord I love how brother Diego says there's no one like you you're so precious you're talking about God now Allah there's no one like you no I'm not here there's nothing no one before we worship you Lord we worship you are worthy of our worship when you do that he appears foreign [Music] I'm sitting in my hotel room in Mexico City capital of Mexico on Friday night and when I'm sitting I'm sitting at about 2 30 in the morning when all of a sudden the Devil comes right to me you've talked to the devil before right there's no how many talk to God oh come on even ministers didn't raise up your house you don't you you don't talk to God you're in trouble Christians all right don't get too excited but the Devil comes to you and he came to me on that 2 30 in the morning because I'm sitting down he says what are you doing here well at first it it's 2 30 in the morning you get a little little bit a little bit scared I'm sorry I got to replace the attack and and and and when that happened then then the spirit of Christ starts rising up in you know and I and you start saying things like this maybe not verbatim he said but this attitude don't be asking stupid questions right he wants to see if you're scared of him yeah you know what I'm here for eign um now now many people say why did christ come brother do you Brothers do you actually know that you were the Forerunner of Christ is I'm going to explain this because Paul tells us foreign man you gotta know what your job is here when we come to church we come for a reason we come to to see him that's why I I sang the song all yo quiero Verde that's why I sing the song Oh I want to see him you know why I want to see him this morning do you know that every time you wake up in the morning brother Jacob the devil trembles because you woke up man I don't think you believe that brother Isaac when you wake up in the morning my devil gets scared foreign [Applause] thank you we'll get a little stronger afterwards do you know the significance of our pastor in Jerusalem right now well brother isn't this supposed to happen and the other supposed to happen is it is it we're supposed to go with brother Branham what is this supposed to happen before we go yesterday and the tribes and the Pharisees said this and this is supposed to happen and Jesus when he comes he says Elijah's already come and you didn't even know there are promises happening before you I promise sometimes we don't even know because we have our mind made up this is the fourth Sunday of the month don't look good today and our mind becomes made up when you understand brother Branham and he says this is the scripture that identifies brother Branham above any other scriptures and when he comes to the well it comes at a certain times and he starts having a conversation and the conversation starts with the compensation worship adoration you know my our fathers worshiped in this mountain it all it all starts with worship it all starts someplace and your relationship with Christ is again the man el hombre did not complain anymore Hamas having choose until he saw the man without feet the book of the book of Hebrews chapter 10 and verse and verse of those and many men I want to just make emphasis to two words in that in that in that verse talking about the worshipers I'm not going to go to the purging I'm just going to go for the worshipers do you know that during this time was it a coincidence yeah brother Caleb going to Jerusalem and they find five heifers in Texas I am Cinco bacas shipped at the same time what is the use foreign you can't even worship God and understand what he is until he comes and he picks you up out of the my requests he justifies justification it's enough for you to shout for the rest of your lives but we're further along brother you just don't know where I remember and as you hear our pastor say something and he says this tremendous quote the great something the great something that he says as long as it keeps you from preparing yourself I got a great quote you wouldn't even know by your body language you know why I see you every every Wednesday really sometimes I see you don't raise your hands the majority don't even think anymore dong leaders know this that's why they're always saying come home and then we can go for hours you know you know you know you know the the Simplicity of it this world knows how to worship right correct you go to any sporting events and if you don't get up it's because you just you just you don't like the game but they know how to worship the music comes on I knew that are Christians start going mama yes sir right now that the Dolphins are doing good right that's the type of worship the player's good and everybody goes crazy they don't even know who you are and we're going crazy for them there was a mess [Applause] excuse yourself Santo thank you not worship is well brother you just don't know who I am real serious you know I know all of you there's none of you that is serious take you outside and yeah nobody is serious here I understand reverence yeah I understand respect I understand honor I understand giving God what he needs I understand coming to the house of the Lord I also thank God that after I acknowledge Him I worship Him he didn't give me one of his sons to die for me to take you out of where you are why we give him glory when you hear our pastor speak to us the very best of God you heard last Sunday the very best of God do you hear the panels and the Ministries the very best of himself but I don't know brother you know ah I don't know you know it's at this time I'm very deep in the things of God and that's why I can't praise him you're so deep you're stuck you're so deep you're stuck you don't know where to go but let me tell you the height of the revelation in the Book of Revelation 24 Elders the Bible says took off their crafts they threw their crowns what's the height of the revelations what has God done in your day he sent us an apostle who positionally place Us in order what does that do to us yes take off our crowns a revelation of the hours when you see our pastor preach to us words of eternal life you've never seen in your life it makes you take off your crap it's the height of the revelation when they very captures in Psalms 107 he says verbatim is oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good okay somebody got to tell you some of your neighbor he's good foreign [Music] because he is good all right sit down now every American I'm both even if well whatever you are yeah I'm both yeah stand up twice I'm already standing up yeah we're all Heinz 57. every American does America you're an American under your feet be seated Give the Lord Jesus a round of applause amen [Applause] he is good president and then it says this Psalms 107 and verse 2. let the redeemed of the Lord say so am I redeemed I've been bought with a prize for the worshiper you you can't even get cleansed if you're not a worshiper you still know personally your brother he he cleansed me okay that's fine it says for the worshipers you can't even get clean unless you worship oh I know a bunch of scripture fine but for the worshipers that scripture is going to make you do something that scripture is going to make you do something that scripture it says will has the power in itself to produce the product so when it comes that word I'm going to say it again when it tells you raise your hands it produces the product I can't brother okay and let's go to another one when we ourselves we we come the worshiper would come in the old testamento in the Old Testament and he would come and he would bring Islam what would he have to do he had to put his hands on it right corrector meaning that he was transferring his sins suspected through that lamb in the old testamental testamento now then that lamb was killed would only covered the worshiper now he would he would feel all right for a little while he feel all right but it only had enough power to cover him but the blood of Jesus Jesus say it again amen but the blood of Jesus doesn't just have power to cover them come on Church don't tell me again don't tell me again don't tell me again it got so much power sister silver today back to the molecules back to the atoms to the ashes where it's not remember anymore [Music] just go just go we want to give God Thanksgiving thanks don't tell me no more [Applause] I'm sorry they're telling me from the front row to preach it is not telling you about the precious blood of Jesus Christ worshiper don't ever I got 15 minutes be ashamed to raise your hands don't ever be ashamed to say Amen you say brother it's not in the amen and it's not in the race I understand entiendo but I want you to know that when you raise up your hands something happens to you defy gravity and you bring the presence of God to you okay brother you know you're you're hermano usted you're emotional yes I am yeah I'm very emotional you know why because he rescued me you know why because he loves me you know why I adore him there ain't nobody like him so he puts us under three he brings us and he calls us under three process or three steps of Grace partes is justification one of them is sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost is number three produces a new birth but you know Shania he trusts you so much you know what he tells you Shania I gotta read this for you I got to read this just just this one for you even maybe if somebody else doesn't capture it that's all right but but you you will according as his divine exceeding great having escaped the corruption [Applause] [Music] this is called The Great Escape Somebody went paid a price open the door it is The Great Escape the corruption that is in the world through lust is what verse is in the verse it's verse five first verse 4. okay good good now he comes and he does this work in you he justifies you sanctifies the scientific he fills you with the Holy Ghost the universe and that is all you need is you say how is it brother that is all you need is that is all you need from him because he does this is then he leaves that to you add to your faith is all right gives you just he justifies you he sanctifies you yeah then he tells you brother Roger now he's got so much confidence the spirit that he's placed in you it is that he tells you that they say now you add foreign I want to be a better person I want to have godliness I want to be more patient I need that I want to be I have more Temperance add it okay everything that you have a spoken word [Applause] in so much that brother Branham says in page 1. paragraph one 1961. the message entitled Faith he says your own Resurrection suprap your Resurrection is inside of you it's not done through the sea I'm waiting for Brother Branham to come back and fix everything then what he left us was not enough then we have believed the half message but since I don't raise up my hands halfway come on he's still scared somebody I refuse to do that okay that's fine I'll get it all right you have not is because you haven't added resurrections inside of you the restorationism whatever you need for your families I finished with this I'm not finished the Apostle Paul says this is Becca the Apostle Paul says it's the same Spirit too Mama another Spirit if the same Spirits he had missed my spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead he that raised up Jesus from the dead will also Quicken your mortal body spiritual bodies glorified bodies
