[21:10] lord we come before your presence

[21:18] even jesus when he came to the tomb of
[21:20] lazarus
[21:22] he turned around and said father
[21:26] i thank you lord
[21:28] because
[21:39] we're touching these people in need
[21:41] right now
[23:18] amen
[23:19] you'd all be seated at this time i
[23:22] believe we have a
[23:24] poem by our brother julian hill and
[23:26] immediately following will be the cedar
[23:28] hills choir amen
[23:30] god bless you
[23:47] hey everyone oh there we go
[23:48] hi uh hello everybody god bless you um i
[23:51] had another poem for you today but it's
[23:53] very short and the story that or how it
[23:56] came about is probably longer than the
[23:58] poem itself um
[24:00] but sometimes it's not so much about how
[24:02] long the poem is but what the message is
[24:04] behind it that's important
[24:05] and uh to give you a bit of backstory
[24:07] about this poem i uh
[24:10] a lot of the poetry that i've received
[24:12] for this happened about two to three
[24:13] years ago so what i'm about to tell you
[24:15] is no longer relevant but just so you
[24:17] know it was a very dark time about two
[24:18] or three years about years ago for me
[24:21] and uh i was dealing with a lot of
[24:23] things internally and this poetry was
[24:25] how i processed that
[24:27] in this specific piece i started to deal
[24:30] with existentialism a little bit and if
[24:33] you know what that is it's basically
[24:34] just uh trying to figure out where you
[24:36] are in the grand scheme of things in
[24:38] life and whether or not you're you're
[24:40] worth anything in it it's a big question
[24:43] and it's a question that has to do with
[24:44] purpose and huge things like that and um
[24:48] the devil likes to use that to
[24:49] manipulate you a lot because he can tell
[24:51] you something like well you don't matter
[24:53] in the grand scheme of things or we'll
[24:55] look at other people what they're doing
[24:57] on social media or even your immediate
[24:59] peers around you look at all the things
[25:01] they're doing you're doing nothing and
[25:03] uh you're meaningless you don't matter
[25:05] and that it's a big lie but it's one
[25:07] that tends to to work very well on us
[25:09] and so
[25:10] the beauty of this poetry and what god
[25:12] showed me through these things was how
[25:14] to shine the light in those areas and
[25:16] tell the devil he was lying
[25:18] and um in this specific piece i'm
[25:20] titling it here
[25:25] it's uh i'm going to call it the sands
[25:27] of time it's called xliv but i give you
[25:30] guys titles to to make more personal
[25:32] it's called the sands of time and it has
[25:34] to deal with the idea of of uh being a
[25:37] speck of dust amidst an ocean of sand
[25:39] and trying to to come to terms with that
[25:41] and figure out how you can find your
[25:42] importance in it and um
[25:45] i would recommend rereading this a lot
[25:46] there's a lot of hidden little secrets
[25:48] in here that you can find double
[25:50] meanings in but if you want to do that
[25:51] you can talk to me and i'll get you a
[25:53] copy
[25:54] but this is it the sands of time
[25:58] to the mortal man we are but a speck of
[26:00] dust in the sands of time blowing in the
[26:02] vast breeze nobody in particular only
[26:05] revealers of the jewels in our midst as
[26:07] they brush us aside
[26:09] but to god he remembers every grain of
[26:11] sand to him we are so much more
[26:14] valued at a price unmatchable by any
[26:17] mortal to him we are a nobody shaped to
[26:20] be somebody
[26:22] though the dust may go to dust as ashes
[26:24] go to ashes we are like the desert in
[26:26] which he loves to dwell
[26:28] proving to be the oasis
[26:30] in all his endless time
[26:32] and that is it and god bless you
[26:34] [Applause]
[26:51] you
[27:25] um
[28:36] so

[37:21] your hospitality
[37:24] is
[37:25] very
[37:26] amazing and special for us
[37:33] when we first came
[37:47] it was like
[37:48] i've
[37:50] [Applause]
[38:00] we have all been
[38:01] in christ before
[38:06] before the
[38:07] foundation of this world was laid
[38:14] so that's why
[38:16] i recognize you yes
[38:20] in the spirit of the lord jesus christ
[38:25] that we all
[38:27] are a member of
[38:29] a part of the body of christ
[38:34] and we all play a very important part
[38:40] on
[38:41] the body of jesus christ
[39:03] we all are a part of the body of jesus
[39:06] christ
[39:10] so
[39:12] when we look at each other
[39:16] we look at jesus christ
[39:20] so i want to greet you all
[39:24] and uh really look forward
[39:26] estoy
[39:31] so god bless you all
[39:33] [Applause]
[39:42] oh yeah
[40:17] and i just have to say we
[40:21] we've had a really really nice time here
[40:24] so far
[40:27] and i'm uh i'm very
[40:30] thankful to the pastor and the home
[40:32] industry for uh
[40:35] showing me the confidence
[41:01] so
[41:02] as brother marcus said we feel like home
[41:05] coming
[41:08] and
[41:09] i wish
[41:10] i had enough time to have a talk with
[41:12] everyone
[41:16] so
[41:18] we are really looking forward to that
[41:20] time
[41:24] and there is no time limit anymore
[41:30] so um
[41:39] okay i had a thought on my heart so uh
[41:42] so let's go to
[41:43] go to the scripture
[41:46] almost and
[42:02] and i put the title to my
[42:05] my simple message
[42:10] title is
[42:19] we know that this is the end
[42:23] not the end of the world
[42:28] and there is
[42:38] let's go to hebrews chapter 12
[42:43] very familiar scripture person
[42:56] but there's so much
[42:58] in it
[43:03] wherefore
[43:04] seeing we also are compassed about with
[43:08] so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay
[43:12] aside every way and the sin which
[43:15] do so easily beset us and let us run
[43:19] with patience the race that is set forth
[43:46] after this i looked and behold a door
[43:49] was opened in heaven
[43:51] and the first voice which i heard was as
[43:54] it were of a trumpet poking which which
[43:57] said
[43:58] come up hit her and i will show you
[44:02] the things which must be hereafter this
[44:05] question is
[44:16] and immediately i was in the spirit
[44:19] and behold a throne was set in heaven
[44:22] and one sat on the trunk
[44:31] of the father father celestial we thank
[44:33] you for this wonderful word
[44:38] and the
[44:39] revelation you have given us
[44:42] only by your grace
[44:45] because this message is a message of
[44:47] grace followed
[44:50] so may you bless your word father
[44:53] and bless all my brothers and sisters
[44:56] here
[44:58] in jesus name
[45:01] amen amen
[45:03] well
[45:07] that
[45:09] the voice you might be sitting when it's
[45:11] in touch the voice that john here was
[45:14] lavos scucha juan come up peter is
[45:18] souviaca
[45:19] well
[45:23] and still i think most of us
[45:26] musically has a question
[45:30] how to get there
[45:32] yeah
[45:32] and how to get higher commodity
[45:36] but paul said something pablo
[45:39] that's really important
[45:41] lay aside every way
[45:58] think of john pincus to the one he was
[46:02] in a certain condition
[46:06] both spiritually and naturally
[46:08] ambassador
[46:10] that when he heard the voice
[46:22] that's really important
[46:25] that we can recognize the voice
[46:30] and immediately
[46:32] in media
[46:33] get into the spirit in the spiritual and
[46:35] get higher each week
[46:54] on the ground
[47:03] and sometimes
[47:07] well
[47:08] it looks like even though i'm a believer
[47:14] i sometimes also feel like i'm
[47:16] crawling on the ground
[47:22] and sometimes feel like eating dust
[47:26] because we are
[47:28] sometimes very down to the earth
[47:35] but in this hour
[47:51] and being overcomers
[47:58] and actually it's impossible to
[48:02] to be overcomers as long as
[48:19] every
[48:20] person who offends us
[48:24] and we
[48:26] most likely we find ourselves battling
[48:28] with those things
[48:40] so when we are kind of weighed down by
[48:43] so many earthly things
[48:46] content
[48:55] so
[48:58] under
[48:59] heavy weights
[49:03] many christians they
[49:05] they find a way of getting used to that
[49:09] kind of life
[49:13] getting used to carrying all those
[49:16] things
[49:19] but that's not scripture
[49:23] because paul said get rid of pablo
[49:28] so when paul said said get rid of every
[49:31] way
[49:34] if we are believers
[49:37] we must believe that there is
[49:41] a way
[49:55] it come a question to my mind
[49:59] where
[50:00] do i
[50:02] build my house
[50:07] where do i
[50:09] build my life
[50:24] this is
[50:35] an eagle won't build his nest on the
[50:38] ground
[50:42] the eagle builds his nest way as high as
[50:46] he can get in the highest peaks
[51:02] you are a candle that sits on a hill
[51:05] [Music]
[51:21] the altas anticipationists we are
[51:24] expecting great things system was
[51:26] expectative of the grand discussions we
[51:28] are not saying
[51:30] well i'm pentecostal
[51:34] that
[51:47] i'm a methodist so
[52:02] that don't satisfy me
[52:04] satisfaction i got the ambition to move
[52:08] until i meet him
[52:13] in control
[52:20] [Applause]
[52:36] [Music]
[52:56] well
[53:00] john
[53:01] what type of the bride is so it it means
[53:06] you and me he is a type of human being
[53:11] and he heard the voice say
[53:16] come up here
[53:19] and and john was in a condition
[53:24] that made him able to
[53:26] get into that spirit
[53:28] capacity
[53:31] and
[53:32] in that condition the lord
[53:35] showed him the whole
[53:37] preview
[54:03] and in this drama
[54:04] drama we are compassed about with so
[54:08] great
[54:35] when you are going live on the stairway
[54:38] in vivo
[54:39] and this drama in this drama you must be
[54:42] prepared
[54:44] both in your soul
[54:47] your spirit
[54:49] and your
[54:50] body
[54:52] and
[54:54] sometimes
[54:56] we are forgetting about the problem
[55:00] sometimes we are getting very
[55:02] spiritual
[55:42] in order to stay in the right conditions
[55:54] and i hope it's okay for you that i
[55:56] speak a little bit about the body yes
[56:04] and
[56:06] you know
[56:11] when we when we were
[56:13] like
[56:14] babies
[56:26] sometime later we
[56:28] we we started we learned to swim
[56:40] you also have to learn how to fly
[56:45] well
[56:46] somebody leaves that believes that the
[56:48] rapture is is something
[56:55] and we are going like rockets
[57:01] but the rapture is actually a little
[57:04] tiny
[57:18] and when this seed is fully measured
[57:23] we will step into another dimension
[57:28] but until then
[57:31] we have to take care of this temple
[57:36] because when you are
[57:39] listening to the word
[57:43] the word has to go through
[57:46] certain channels
[58:16] and now
[58:18] we come to the tricky part all right
[58:27] [Music]
[58:54] so
[58:56] many times i i've said to myself which
[58:59] is versus medici
[59:19] and it is possible yes possibly but it
[59:22] happens it depends on my attitude it
[59:24] depends on me at tooth
[59:27] actually
[59:28] according to the best thing to do
[59:33] as soon as you wake up in the morning
[59:37] is to get right into the spirit
[59:43] because if you and i go right into the
[59:46] spirit
[59:48] the direction for the rest of the day is
[59:52] already set direction
[59:59] but you have to get into the right kind
[1:00:01] of spirits
[1:00:04] because there are many spirits
[1:00:08] and and
[1:00:09] and
[1:00:10] in this time we so easily
[1:00:14] get caught by all the spirits
[1:00:20] through a lot of different channels
[1:00:23] if we are not conscious
[1:00:27] and bring ourselves right into the holy
[1:00:30] spirit
[1:00:34] what does that mean
[1:00:40] read it
[1:01:01] in the same
[1:01:03] time
[1:01:03] that
[1:01:06] satan has to lose all his demons
[1:01:21] eating demons
[1:01:49] but the best way to cast out the demons
[1:01:54] is to act contrary to what the demon
[1:01:56] tells you to do
[1:02:01] have you ever felt that poo algona
[1:02:04] alone
[1:02:21] so what kind of decision do we make
[1:02:24] classes
[1:02:26] and very often they think okay just one
[1:02:29] more time
[1:02:59] you see then you glorify him
[1:03:03] and to bring myself higher
[1:03:08] amen actually we can't bring ourselves
[1:03:11] higher
[1:03:44] and i will give you a little testimony
[1:03:48] of what it means for me
[1:03:54] and
[1:03:55] when going through this
[1:03:56] pasta
[1:03:59] i i want you to remember one thing
[1:04:04] who is your
[1:04:06] greatest
[1:04:07] enemy
[1:04:10] in amigo
[1:04:13] and if i tell you maybe you won't like
[1:04:15] me so i will i will let brother branham
[1:04:17] answer that question
[1:04:23] some brother branham he says this is
[1:04:26] that's the biggest enemy i got is
[1:04:31] william branagh yes william branham he's
[1:04:34] always in my ways
[1:04:38] he's always in god's way
[1:04:41] i will say
[1:04:43] he always gets in god's way
[1:04:49] he is too tired
[1:04:51] he don't want to do this you don't want
[1:04:54] to do that
[1:04:58] if i just
[1:05:00] if i can just crucify that
[1:05:05] god can use it just
[1:05:17] he can use this body
[1:05:23] so
[1:05:24] i tell you a little story about myself
[1:05:31] for
[1:05:32] for many years
[1:05:35] the hardest thing in my life the most
[1:05:37] efficient me vida
[1:05:39] was to get up
[1:05:44] on
[1:05:50] what about you
[1:05:54] i i was always
[1:05:56] like a last minute sleeper
[1:06:02] i
[1:06:13] it
[1:06:19] so when i finally got up on the finale
[1:06:23] i felt like my whole life was like a
[1:06:25] mess
[1:06:28] and i was behind all others
[1:07:07] well i had a little discussion with the
[1:07:09] brother caleb this morning
[1:07:24] chocolate
[1:07:39] because we also need some some bitter
[1:07:41] things
[1:07:49] he said it was his religion
[1:07:51] he said
[1:07:53] he is
[1:08:05] well
[1:08:07] it could have the same effect
[1:08:13] on our brain
[1:08:18] or smoking
[1:08:20] or drinking
[1:08:23] because sugar it affects our reward
[1:08:27] center in our brain
[1:08:33] and every time we take in that stuff we
[1:08:36] we
[1:08:49] ourselves with something
[1:09:05] but
[1:09:06] it's a kind of tipping point here
[1:09:12] if you feel too good
[1:09:16] it will be harmful
[1:09:22] that's the reason children they they
[1:09:24] when it comes to candies and things
[1:09:30] they can't control themselves
[1:09:45] because in this
[1:09:49] there are so many spiritually candy
[1:09:51] stores around
[1:09:53] us
[1:09:56] for cheap price can get a lot of candies
[1:10:39] because
[1:10:41] when too much sugar
[1:10:45] you are getting
[1:10:47] brain fog
[1:10:52] and and with that kind of fog
[1:10:57] it's really difficult to judge things
[1:11:01] judge things the right way
[1:11:04] you see ben
[1:11:06] so
[1:11:07] we can see
[1:11:08] when when
[1:11:10] when people get too much sugar
[1:11:14] they are not
[1:11:16] stable not established but really
[1:11:18] unstable so in established and
[1:11:21] unpredictable impressiveness
[1:11:23] men
[1:11:25] and it's not good for their body
[1:11:30] but i was
[1:11:31] taking a lot of sugar
[1:11:35] because every morning
[1:11:37] after some few loaves of bread despite
[1:11:39] this
[1:11:41] i was not drinking chocolate
[1:11:45] chocolate i was eating it
[1:11:49] and drinking coffee
[1:11:52] and the more chocolate interesting the
[1:11:55] more coffee
[1:11:56] and not only chocolate no solo chocolate
[1:11:58] cake
[1:12:00] especially marzipan cake especially
[1:12:06] exactly
[1:12:14] but the consequence of this
[1:12:16] consequence
[1:12:17] was that
[1:12:20] i got sick in my body
[1:12:24] and i was gaining a lot of weight
[1:12:28] and i got so tired
[1:12:32] and i was
[1:12:34] some time ago i i was counting on how
[1:12:37] many hours i spent on the sofa
[1:12:44] in the afternoon
[1:12:46] because i had to crash down to the sofa
[1:12:49] every afternoon
[1:12:54] and sometimes sleeping one hour two hour
[1:12:57] three hours
[1:13:02] my calculation told me miss calculus
[1:13:06] that
[1:13:07] i spent more time on the sofa during 16
[1:13:11] years
[1:13:14] than a
[1:13:15] pilot spends up in the air
[1:13:20] during his whole career
[1:13:24] think of that brother
[1:13:26] that's a lot of armors
[1:13:30] wow
[1:13:32] so um in the evenings always a big bowl
[1:13:36] of
[1:13:37] vanilla ice cream
[1:13:42] with chocolate sauce on it
[1:13:44] yeah
[1:13:58] because the body is demanding
[1:14:03] because
[1:14:05] it goes to the reward
[1:14:16] caleb and his wife was so nice to us
[1:14:21] and they let us have their car because
[1:14:24] in the house
[1:14:25] also we could drive
[1:14:41] he said something the hulk
[1:14:43] be aware that this power
[1:14:46] is a diesel
[1:14:48] vehicle
[1:14:52] but actually
[1:15:04] [Music]
[1:15:37] i tried it out when we were happy
[1:15:45] so i started thinking
[1:15:49] how
[1:15:50] could
[1:16:01] so we'll see
[1:16:12] there is a bacterial flora are you not
[1:16:15] florida the bacteria you know that
[1:16:32] that are our enemy
[1:16:34] bacteria
[1:16:36] but those who should be there
[1:16:41] are our friends
[1:16:43] amigos actually
[1:16:45] we cannot live without nobody
[1:16:50] and there are billions of high pioneers
[1:16:53] they use
[1:16:54] in our brain
[1:16:57] we have
[1:16:58] billions of brains there must be units
[1:17:03] and we need those brain cells for
[1:17:06] everything we do
[1:17:09] and
[1:17:10] and we need
[1:17:14] that those brain cells they they are
[1:17:17] conscious
[1:17:20] because sometimes
[1:17:25] especially
[1:17:28] when driving car especially
[1:17:33] sometimes it's a matter of a second
[1:17:35] question
[1:17:38] we have to make the right decision
[1:17:41] correct but if we have
[1:17:57] if we have too much heavy weight on us
[1:18:02] we run the risk of acting too slow
[1:18:05] establish
[1:18:08] we run the risk of not recognizing
[1:18:12] the voice
[1:18:18] you see
[1:18:19] ben
[1:18:21] so
[1:18:25] for our stomach to
[1:18:28] to work properly
[1:18:31] it needs healthy foods
[1:18:35] the same way as our soul
[1:18:38] needs healthy spiritual food
[1:18:44] and if you carry the muscle you can't
[1:18:46] grow
[1:18:47] no no
[1:18:48] in order to grow we need solid food
[1:18:53] solido and what is growing quest
[1:18:56] i'll show you in a minute
[1:19:05] it's going up is
[1:19:12] [Applause]
[1:19:18] the opposite thing is shrinking
[1:19:33] it's important to know the difference
[1:19:35] it's important
[1:19:38] i'll tell you something
[1:19:43] our bacterial flora
[1:19:46] flora bacterial is communicating it's
[1:19:49] with our brains
[1:19:53] so if we
[1:19:55] eat
[1:19:57] junk food chico memos basura
[1:20:01] eating sugar azucares
[1:20:11] and now the stomach starts to send
[1:20:14] kind of
[1:20:15] and clear
[1:20:16] signals
[1:20:23] and we
[1:20:24] run the risk of acting
[1:20:25] in the wrong way it was
[1:20:28] god
[1:20:44] but in order to to get get rid of things
[1:20:49] we have to make
[1:20:51] at this
[1:20:55] decision
[1:20:58] we we need to have a right attitude
[1:21:02] correct and
[1:21:06] and make a commitment
[1:21:10] to ourselves
[1:21:12] to the lord
[1:21:39] is
[1:21:56] but in an easy life you can't overcome
[1:21:58] peru
[1:22:01] so we have to like brother branham said
[1:22:04] tenemos commodities in the modern have
[1:22:06] expectations that are expectative what
[1:22:09] kind of expectation class of
[1:22:10] expectatives that i can do better
[1:22:15] because i need to grow
[1:22:18] i need to get up higher
[1:22:35] lot of pains in my body muchos dolores
[1:22:38] said me cuerpo
[1:22:40] i could hardly walk difficult
[1:22:43] hardly do things difficult
[1:22:46] a specialist told me
[1:22:48] especially
[1:22:58] you look like a car that hasn't been
[1:23:00] repaired for 30 years
[1:23:10] you must do your part of us
[1:23:18] so when i got to a specialist
[1:23:22] specialist
[1:23:24] he said the first because i was i was
[1:23:26] aching so badly
[1:23:30] i was walking like this
[1:23:37] you see ben
[1:23:40] and when we went somewhere for
[1:23:45] having a walk in the city or something i
[1:23:47] i i just said my family
[1:23:49] here is a bench
[1:23:55] down here
[1:23:57] and you know where you find me
[1:24:00] you see
[1:24:02] it's not a good condition
[1:24:06] so when i came to that specialist
[1:24:09] specialist he said because i asked him
[1:24:12] could you
[1:24:13] help me with some some insoles
[1:24:21] [Music]
[1:24:25] and he was asking questions for one hour
[1:24:34] [Music]
[1:24:42] and the first thing you have to start
[1:24:44] with
[1:24:46] is to
[1:24:47] improve your balance
[1:24:50] to equilibrium
[1:24:53] so he said
[1:24:54] the oil closure right
[1:25:07] and he said from there
[1:25:10] you have to
[1:25:23] because when you get older he said
[1:25:27] if you don't have good balance
[1:25:30] when equilibrium
[1:25:32] in your body is
[1:25:34] especially in your feet especially
[1:25:36] if your muscles and things are not
[1:25:38] trained
[1:25:42] you will so easily fell on the ground
[1:25:45] and break bones in your body
[1:25:49] you see ben
[1:25:52] it was about
[1:25:59] that i had some motivation for doing
[1:26:01] this
[1:26:05] because i knew something
[1:26:08] it will be painful anyhow
[1:26:13] if i do nothing
[1:26:16] it will be very painful
[1:26:20] so
[1:26:20] better take some pain
[1:26:23] now
[1:26:26] to make some gains
[1:26:28] and beneficial so i started off with
[1:26:31] this mpc
[1:26:34] so long story short brazil historian
[1:26:39] i lost like 50 pounds
[1:26:43] and and my physical condition was
[1:27:18] you can make the puedes
[1:27:23] so
[1:27:24] conscious the best thing
[1:27:27] was
[1:27:28] one morning half past six
[1:27:45] remember last time i had that
[1:27:49] that feeling of being well rested
[1:27:56] so i was thinking for a little while
[1:28:00] why did i wake up
[1:28:02] and another voice told me don't ask you
[1:28:04] many questions
[1:28:08] and i i started arguing a little bit
[1:28:12] and i i said that well this good feeling
[1:28:15] will soon come to an end
[1:28:20] but then i made a decision
[1:28:23] yes to get right out of the bed
[1:28:44] but i knew
[1:28:46] in order to to have this lasting pero
[1:28:50] i have to get higher
[1:28:53] it's not enough with one app
[1:29:05] you mean for me
[1:29:07] it was like going into another dimension
[1:29:13] now
[1:29:14] aura i had energy when they're here
[1:29:18] and i made a decision
[1:29:22] i will use my energy for something very
[1:29:26] very important
[1:29:30] so
[1:29:32] every morning
[1:29:35] i open i open my ipad
[1:29:40] and i turned on some
[1:29:42] sermons
[1:29:45] from
[1:29:46] [Music]
[1:29:47] las cruces
[1:29:48] and i was listening
[1:30:04] hours
[1:30:21] and by doing this it it sets the
[1:30:24] direction for when doing this on monday
[1:30:27] morning
[1:30:29] because
[1:30:30] sunday is a wonderful day
[1:30:35] but monday is also really good
[1:30:39] because on monday morning i'm watching
[1:30:42] the service from las cruces from
[1:30:45] sunday
[1:30:50] and and that kind of
[1:30:54] gives me power for the whole week
[1:30:58] so it sets the direction it's
[1:31:02] for tomorrow
[1:31:04] and the next day
[1:31:06] and the next day
[1:31:08] until thursday morning
[1:31:11] when i'm listening to the sermon from
[1:31:14] the wedding
[1:31:17] and then
[1:31:19] next monday
[1:31:21] another sunday sermon otro servicio del
[1:31:24] domingo and in
[1:31:26] in between in with you thursdays and
[1:31:29] mondays
[1:31:32] there is so
[1:31:33] many things on that youtube channel
[1:31:37] it is the canal the youtube the las
[1:31:39] cruces and going back many years
[1:31:41] sometimes
[1:31:56] amazing grace
[1:32:00] gracia that i can sit up in norway
[1:32:06] amongst the
[1:32:08] billions of pine trees in telus beyond
[1:32:10] is
[1:32:19] from the ministry in las cruces del
[1:32:22] ministerio in las cruces and feel that i
[1:32:25] am a part of the same spirit
[1:32:29] i am a part of the same body
[1:32:35] this is something supernatural
[1:32:53] and
[1:32:54] by
[1:32:55] listening to
[1:32:57] hundreds of those sermons
[1:33:13] so i could come and see you in person
[1:33:22] and that makes me thinking of that great
[1:33:25] day

[1:33:33] in person and persona not through
[1:33:36] technology
[1:33:38] technology

[1:33:45] as his pride
[1:33:47] we meet him our bridegroom
[1:33:53] and
[1:33:58] amen
[1:34:15] because there was a little woman

[1:35:06] and she was so down to the ground
[1:35:08] yesterday
[1:35:10] that she got desperate he just said
[1:35:20] she broke all those circles
[1:35:25] she
[1:35:27] she went in the circle for a certain
[1:35:29] time

[1:36:05] before she had six men in her life

[1:36:48] muscle and she saw that he was
[1:36:50] crying you see ben what a revelation
