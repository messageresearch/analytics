amen God bless [Music] you God bless you everyone thank you I was just about to ask you for those tonight uh we have a special program prepared for you all and uh instead of just saying what's going off the top of my head I decided to actually write you all a Pros tonight to introduce the the program so I'm going to start reading it for you and as soon as I'm done we'll get this started Hebrews 11374 reads they were stoned they were saw asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wanded about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect 2023 has been a great year has had great results a great increase and a great trial though we have seen heard and felt the adversaries WS it has only made the testimony of Jesus Christ greater in our lives and the lives of hundreds of thousands but on a smaller scale not to be contrasted in saying one is lesser than the other we have seen this exact change progress and challenge in the youth 40 some members give or take have not only accepted the suffering of Christ but his reward Against All Odds persecution and Temptation the children of God the generation to come Stand Tall against the evil of this world Rising above and holding to the Lord steadfastly I as a member of the teaching Community can attest to how great a miracle it is that our youth retain their inheritance in the times we're living in parents along with all members of the body of Jesus Christ you should be proud of them to those of you who consider yourselves neither if you are looking for a miracle the children of God are one walking these same children the youth have not only chosen to carry their cross but have combined their Collective gifts for the edification of the body of Jesus Christ creating what you see today this play you are about to see has been carefully curated by your very own every prop you see was Handmade by one of them every stage piece was made under the inspiration given to everyone the music acting special effects and even some aspects of the script that needed an edit were done by the best of the best the Cedar Hills Church of the Cross youth I find this to be no surprise given the inspiration and center of study given to us this year by our pastor which was the study of the martyrs to those of whom the world was not worthy we give you the best we have to offer is the least we could give for those who gave everything for us the faith and this message showing us that it was and is worth dying for though today we may not face persecution on the physical plane we see it on the plane of principalities who seek to kill us spiritually and yet the children of God Stand Tall dying to ourselves and continuing our walk with the Lord this leads us to stevenh the first recorded martyr in the Bible the Holy Ghost filled man who didn't care what the world status quo was how dangerous it was to Believe In Christ or how unpopular being a Christian could be Stephen said what needed to be said regardless of the consequences in the words of the modern generation quote he stood on business he was about his father's business still the price of perfection is death primarily of Christ exemplified in the lives given for his sake and ours unknown and known this play is dedicated to the one who gave his life for the Lord from Cedar Hills Church of the Cross to you may your story Inspire those here today and those who will see this tomorrow as it did for us and myself this latter half of the Year may this play be a spark to light our fire for this coming year and punch the Antichrist spirit in the face as Steven did fighting the spiritual battle that was and is and will always be called the good fight that Antichrist spirit is still here as wrathful as it was then seeking whom he may devour we do not go forward fearing it but rather stand against it loving as God has commanded and being sound in our thinking just as Stephen did in his time as you will soon see and on that note brothers and sisters I pray you enjoy this play from our youth to you now presenting the story of a man who was full of faith and power was a work worker of Miracles and dedicated his life to the Lord the Martyr anthologies Steven of whom the world was not worthy the first of many plays to come God bless [Applause] you [Music] justes has a great embodiment jeski knew and admitted that Christianity had been defeated by rational faculty by the intellect the genius himself I'm a Christian ask me about my faith gosh these people never get old man so you're one of those people huh nice to meet you too I don't think nice is the word I would use well what word would you use um annoying annoying yeah what about this is annoying oh oh you hate reading huh um no actually I read quite a lot that's how I know that that little book of yours is nothing but a farce really your book says that sure does which ones oh you know science and constant change the Big Bang explosive guarantee of the real world of science that we made up I could go on explosive guarantee look I didn't name the books I just read them I mean I get that but the real question is which editions did you read uh fourth fifth I don't know why does that matter just seems like a lot of change for something so constant funny and bull talk for someone who has 50 different versions of the same Bible look the translations may change but the text is the same besides I don't own 50 different versions of the Bible I just have the one right shows how educated you are look not that I'm not enjoying our conversation but may I ask what brought you over here could have kept walking eating your sandwich and enjoy the rest of your day but instead you came over here to well discuss the fses of my faith does something about it bother you bother me no I'm just sick of you people and your oppressive Faith oppressive what's oppressive is it you no it is your people and by association you me yes I'm not oppressing anyone but I may be ooling someone okay okay look you actually seem pretty nice from what I can tell thank you and that's the problem why I just don't get it I don't get how you can sit there with the smile on your face feeling the breeze admiring the blossoms as a bird's tweet as if there weren't a thousand problems in the world it's so frustrating and the truth comes out and what of it nothing nothing as a matter of fact I heard that the truth can set you free who says that at this point I don't think you want to know what would be important for you to know is that the issues you have with me seem to be more issues you have with yourself what no you want to talk about it sure don't worry I don't bite but make sure not to touch my Bible just can I start to S what actually no no of course not it's just a joke it's just leather and pain okay let's start there leather and paper how can you believe in that well simply speaking it's about faith proceed well simply speaking it's about faith believing it taking God out his word and the rest will follow see that's what bothers me saying just believe it what are the facts to back it up how can you prove to me that that's real well the same way that you believe your science books are real you take it on faith but that's different because my books are based on facts not Faith proven facts that have been built over thousands of years your book was written by a bunch of dudes without any documentation to back it up kind of like how your books were written by a bunch of dudes with facts that change every year requiring new additions almost annually sounds like you have a lot more faith than me to me that seems a lot more unbelievable all right touche but's still there has to be something more surely what else do you have to prove to me that what you have is the truth well something that adds to my faith is the sacrifice of it all now I'm not just talking about Jesus even though his is the most important I'm talking about the martyrs known and unknown the ones that sacrific their life for our life Faith through sacrifice that seems a bit backwards it's not backwards it's a provided way okay whatever about these Martyrs who are these people you don't know about the martyrs and you call yourself a reader look I never had a reason to look into them nor a desire up till well now so you're saying you have an interest I'm saying is that for now you can call me a fish cuz I'm hooked good one thanks you got any stories well one comes to mind well I I have I've got I've got time and sustenance well then you're all set this is the story of Stephen in those days when the number number of disciples multiplied there was muming of the grecians against the Hebrews even their widows were neglected in the daily Ministry because of this the 12 stated that instead of serving tables they should bring the word of God they commanded the multitude to bring forth seven Men of Honor support who are full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom to send Stephen was among those seven why you may ask Not only was he full of faith and the Holy Ghost but also power of both Mind and Spirit because of this he did great wonders and worked many miracles among the people like what oh I don't know you name it I guess he made the lame wall the blind see and the deaf to hear you expect me to believe that no not really but other men certainly did enough to make them very upset interesting [Music] can't believe you oh my goodness Sirus can you believe what Stephen has been doing whether want to believe or not libertine the things that he does and continues to do has caused a great strength of people right you're right and on top of that I've got to take care of my synagogue hold on libert aneous since when did we start laying claim to the synagogue you to say I'm not the one who deserves it you deserve it you deserve it I've done more work than you and you deserve it yeah all this is irrelevant cuz God and Moses like me better shut up be quiet be quiet quiet come on gentlemen Gentlemen please let's not act like animals we leave that to the Christians okay so what is the deal here it's Stephen that's the problem I the sirenia speaks the truth step has been speaking blasphemy against God and Moses and are we just going to sit here and do anything about it you haven't thought about that have you no but are we going to sit we can't sit around and wait yes so why don't we just try him well wouldn't you agree people of Jerusalem shouldn't we lay hand on Steven for his blasphemy I'm not saying I disagree but why are we going after Steph again yeah I agree with him he sounds very convinced I mad for no reason so we agree Stephen is clearly a terrible person and should be tried as such gentlemen fetch me Stephen I'll with the council you there tiny man who whom Steven let borrow $15 come forth what is your name dollar bilus I will call you minion okay and how is your money situation as worse as before and this economy of course it is good good I need you to do something for me a real small significant thing here I need you to provide FSE testimony amongst Steven what but the law M you've seen how evil that man is who should we not be harbingers of Justice Law Men Without law just men sir I'll give you $20 30 15 sold move Stephen stop moving Stephen right there stay right there stop resisting Good Men of the council I bring before you st a Blasphemous man that has spoken not only against of God but of Moses uhuh and you know that a man I would never bring a man on these charges unless they had 100% true not at all tempered evidence regarding his case what say you doar billus this man has spoken and won't stop speaking Blasphemous things against his holy place and the law I myself have heard this firsthand I among many others have also heard him that Jesus of Nazareth will come and destroy this place and will change the cust the Customs which Moses delivered to us there see he confirms it this is the exact thing that we discussed earlier got got Stephen are these things so no the place stop wait wait what what's happening going to be honest I don't have step's entire speech memorized what so we won't know what happens next yes we will just give me a second a sandwich oh here it is Steven speech oh you carry his speech around it's a good speech all right now unlike me Stephen said all this under the inspiration without any paper necessary and what he said when a little something like brothers and fathers listen to me the glory of God has appeared to Our Father Abraham while he was still in Mesopotamia before he lived in haran leave your country and your people God said and go to a land where I will show you so he left the land of Chalin and settled in haran after the death of his father God sent him to this land where you guys are now living in he gave him no inheritance here not even not even enough ground to set his foot upon but God Almighty promised him through him and his descendants would possess this land which you guys are staying in even though at the time Abraham had no child God spoke to him in this way for 400 years you and your descendants will be strangers in a country not of your own and they will be enslaved and and served as slaves God said afterward they will come out of that place and worship me then he gave Abraham the Covenant of circumcision and Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him eight days after his birth later Isaac became the father of Jacob and Jacob became the father of the of the 12 Patriarchs because the Patriarchs were jealous of Joseph they stole him as a slave into Egypt but God Almighty was with him and rescued him from all of his troubles he gave Joseph wisdom and enabled him to gain Good Will from the Pharaoh king of Egypt so Pharaoh made him ruler over Egypt and all of his place but then Great Famine struck Egypt and Canaan bringing forth great sufferings and our ancestors could not find food when Jacob heard these things and great when he heard that there was things in when he heard that there was grain in Egypt he sent our forefathers and the on his first visit he went on the first visit on the second visit Joseph told his brothers who he was and the learned about Joseph's family after this Joseph sent for his father Jacob and his whole family 75 and all then Jacob went down to Egypt where he had our an where all our our ancestors have died where their bodies were brought back to shech and placed in the Tomb that Abraham had bought for their sons for some for a certain sum of money as the time Drew near for God to fulfill his Almighty Pro promise to Abram Abraham the number of our people greatly grew in Egypt then a new king to whom Joseph meant nothing came to power in Egypt he dealt treacherously with our people and oppressed our ancestors by forcing them to throw out their newborn babies so that they would die what at this time Moses was born oh he was an ordinary child for 3 months he was Cared by his family but then he was placed outside Pharaoh's daughter took him and brought him up as her own son Moses was educated in all the wisdom of Egyptians and was powerful in speech and wisdom when Moses was 40 years old he decided to visit his own people the Israelites he saw one of them being mistreated mistreated by an Egyptian so he went into the fence and by killing the Egyptian Moses thought that his own people would realize that God was using him to rescue them but but they did not the next day Moses went upon two Israelites that were fighting and have you and he had to try to reconcile them by saying men you are brothers why do you guys not want to hurt each other but the man who was mistreating the other pushed Moses and said are you thinking of killing me as you killed the other Egyptian yesterday when Moses heard this he fled to Midian where he settled as a foreigner and had two sons after 40 years had passed an angel appeared to Moses in flames in a burning bush in this desert near Mount Si when he saw this he was amazed at the sight as he went over to get a closer look he heard the Lord say I am the god of your fathers the god of Abraham Isaac Jacob Moses trembled in fear and did not dare to look but then the Lord told them take off your sandals for this place where you are now standing in is Holy I have indeed seen the oppression of my people people in Egypt I have heard their groanings and have come down for you to set them free now come I will send you back to Egypt this is the same Moses keep in mind this is the same Moses that they had rejected with their own words who made you ruler and judge he sent he sent there to be the ruler and delivered by God himself through the angel who appeared to him in that bush he led him out of Egypt and performed wonders and signs into Egypt at the Red Sea for 40 years in the wilderness by his own people but he he was an assembly in the wilderness when the angel spoke to him on Mount Si with their ancestors and received living words to pass on to us but our ancestors refused to obey him instead they rejected him in their own and they return their hearts back to Egypt so they told Aaron make us God who will go before us as for this fellow Moses who led us out of Egypt we don't know what has happened to him that was the time when they made an idol form of a calf they brought him sacrifices to it and revealed in what their own hands have made oh but God turned them away and gave them over to worship the the moon and the stars this agrees with of what is written in the book of the prophets did you bring sacrifices an offering for 40 years into the Wilderness people of Israel you have taken up the Tabernacle of Mo and the star of your God refin the idols you made to worship therefore I will send you into Exile Beyond Babylon I don't even know those words our ancestors had the Tabernacle of Covenant law with them in the wilderness it had been made the scene after receiving the Tabernacle of her ancestors under Joshua brought it with them then they took the Land from the nation that God drove out of them before it remained into the into the land until it was time of David who enjoyed in God's favor and asked that he might provide a dwelling place for God of Jacob but it was Solomon who built the house however the most high does not live in houses made by human hands oh no as the prophet said Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol excuse what kind of house will you build for me sayth the Lord or where will my resting place be has not all my hands have made this oh you stiff neck people oh that's it your hearts are still uncircumcised you are just like your ancestors you guys always resist the Holy Spirit me back hold me back was there ever a prophet you guys did not persecute they even K those who predicted the coming of the righteous one righteous one and now you have betrayed and murdered him you who have received the law that was given him through Angels but have not obeyed it oh that's what is your problem get on the floor get him get him get him get him he's gone why are they reacting that way that's a common reaction for losing Spirit of the Antichrist but where are they taking him out of the city what for to Stone [Music] him Lord receive my spirit Lord hold not their sins against [Applause] [Music] them [Music] he's [Music] de how could they do that people doesn't care who you are how old or how young if you're anything like Christ it wants you dead he wants you dead who's he the devil Lucifer the embodiment of evil the Antichrist Spirit that's that's a lot to take in yes it is the truth always is because the truth is love God's love and God's love is overwhelming when you really take him at his word take him in that's when you really see him that's when he becomes more than just a religion or an old book he becomes real then once you feel the gravity of the sit situation cannot Escape his pool the same pool the planets to the Sun s similar to the pool you felt walking by the stand I see I just I I don't understand that after all they did to him he didn't want them to be held accountable for what they did that's love God's love a true man of God who is filled with the Holy Spirit that's what Christianity really is that's who God really is don't get me wrong I hear what you're saying but I this I fail to understand to see how this is supposed to add to your faith personally I'm more terrified now than what I was from when I first got here I get that look the Lord doesn't give us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind though the devil would want us to to live in fear or martyrdom we don't because we don't fear him but God we believe that all things work together for good to those who love God to those who are called according to his purpose and if we believe in him regardless of the trials and tribulations we face then we will receive eternal life the protection of God and the promise that is in the Kingdom of Heaven the death of the Saints ask our fa Faith because it it humbles us it makes God so much more real and there's very few real things in this life than blood blood has been shed for me time and time again that tells me that though the world may doubt and disagree the Saints knew that the word of God was worth dying for if nothing else but for my sake for whosoever will the same as Christ and those who have spiritually died after Faith your sacrifice is Faith in what's real it's kind of beautiful when you put it that way a relationship with the Lord It's a romance it's beautiful if you just let him show you how beautiful it can be not only through you but through those who stand for him man I see that now but you know those men didn't deserve him he was far too good for them he was of whom the world was not worthy of I'm guessing that's another scripture you're quoting it is Hebrews 11:38 nice you know um I'm sorry for how I treated you I've realized that I've held in a lot of bitterness towards God and it's I can see now that I was wrong not only for how I treated God but for how I treated you I'm really sorry can you forgive me as Heil so can I how could I call myself a Christian if I couldn't forgive oh look at the time I'm Wai for work I was on my lunch break don't forget to sandwich on the way there right right right thank you by the way for helping me see things clearly it really means a lot of course anytime all right are you here every day around this time as much as I can be all right all right um I'll come by tomorrow then I didn't get your name pel Penelope I'm Marge nice to meet you Marge you the same Penelope bye see you tomorrow Marge and may God bless all of whom the world is not worthy of [Music] [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] what a story huh um well I actually was able to study the story of Jon of Arc do you guys know who that is no let me tell you guys so I wrote it in the first person because I thought it was kind of cool to present it that way um you know our pastor always tells us to put ourselves in in shoes right and to make it personal so I kind of put myself in her shoes and I wrote it in the first person so I'm going to read it for you guys yeah okay go I am Jonah Arc a humble servant of God chosen to fulfill a Divine Mission from a young age I felt a deep connection to the Divine hearing the voices of saints and receiving visions that guided me God's presence in my life was palpable guiding my every step and fing filling me with unwavering faith it was through his grace that I found the strength and the courage to lead the French army into battle despite the odds stacked against us I knew that God's will was at work and I trusted in his plan in moments of doubt and uncertainty I turned to prayer seeking guidance and soless from the almighty through these conversations with God I found Clarity and the conviction to persevere even when faced with skepticism and betrayal throughout my journey I relied on God's strength to overcome the challenges that arose he provided me with the necessary skills and knowledge knowledge to lead the troops inspiring them with his divine presence I understood that my role was not only to fight for France but also to serve as a vessel for God's will even during my darkest moments such as my capture and subsequent trial I clung to my faith in God I knew that he was with me providing me with the strength to defend myself against the false accusations and face my impending death with unwavering WI resolve God's presence in my life continued to shine even after my passing my story became a testament to the power of faith and courage that comes from trusting in God's plan I am Jon of Arc forever grateful for God's pre for God's guidance and unwavering faith that carried me through the my extra extraordinary Journey my life serves as a reminder that when we align ourselves with God's will anything is possible and his presence can carry us even through the most challenging of circumstances I lived a life that this world was not worthy of did you guys awesome right yeah yeah so did you guys like study anybody or just me cuz I know it couldn't just be me have y'all ever heard of Ann huton Hutchinson sorry so I happened to write something in her point of view as well go something like this I am I am an Hutchinson a remarkable woman who lived in the 17th century I was born in England and later later immigrated to Massachusetts Bay Colony in America with my husband and children I was known for my strong religious beliefs and involvement in the Puritan Community I became a prominent figure in the colony holding religious meetings in my home where I discussed and challenged sermons of the Puritan ministers I believe that salvation came through faith alone rather than through good works which was controversial stance at the time this led to conflicts with the religious leaders and the established church despite facing opposition I fearlessly continued to express express my beliefs my influence grew as PE as people were drawn to the Bible studies and meetings I held in my home in December of 1936 a group of opposing clergymen called upon me to try to convince me to to deny my beliefs after being exiled from the Puritan Church my response was the Lord judges not as a man judges better to be cast out of the church than deny Christ Christ after my Exile I settled in Rhode Island where I continued to practice my faith and advocate for a belief in the personal relationship with the Lord my legacy lies in challenging the authority of the established the established church for they would not allow me a place to live only a place to die in summary Ian Hutchinson was I'm a courageous and influential cre figure in colonial America who stood up for her beliefs and lived a life not worth of whom the of whom the world is not worthy of sorry than wow that was amazing well see I went a different route I is a third person so what I did was I wrote about you guys know who anpus was hey you guys so anpus was a very faithful man to the Lord Jesus during the perg church age of course he was a loyal martyr and wasn't ashamed of his beliefs and what was inspiring to me about him is was his faith he gave his life everything to God everything but not even death was a power enough was powerful enough to interrupt The Works of God he was killed during the reign of Nero by burning in a Brazen bull bull but shaped altar it was what what a faith I also wrote mine in third person have you guys heard the story of Victor I know tell us tell us brother well Victor was a gentle charitable Christian and this Christian still happen to live in the worst time of the 10 persecutions of the Roman Church and many of the killings of the martyrs were written as unspeakable and well Victor in spite of all this Victor spot this was a charitable Christian he often spent most of his time visiting the poor giv to the poor visiting the sick and the needy and he did this so much that his reputation as a charitable Christian got so grew so widespread that it even reached the emperor and the thing was that Emperor hated the Christians and up in hearing this the emperor sent him to be dragged through the streets and he was stoned and beaten by hateful pagans and when he was thrown in like in back in the ancient Roman days the martyrs were examined examined basically like a it's like court and in this court they would give him the ultimatum Freedom or recent your faith recent your faith and well Victor he stood steadfast he was beaten he he was stretched on the rack and tortured at the same time but he didn't let go he was so courageous that he he was so courageous that even the even his tormentors were tired of torturing him that's how courageous and that's how strong he was in his faith and Well on yeah and it so happened that I think on his second examination right after it was tortured he was thrown in prison and this prison it wasn't like a nice pretty ones that we have was the worst of the worst and well he would he was thrown in there beaten and bruised and hurt but even though he was hurt he still had the courage and they couldn't beat the life out of of them and that same life he preached to his same captors he converted three of his jailers to Christ can you believe that and those three and when the emperor heard of those well they they were beheaded and Victor was yet beaten again it was brutally beaten this time but his third examination that's where Glory came his third examination he was presented to a pagan altar with an idol on top of it and well he was given incense and he was told he was given this ultimatum either you sacrifice to your God or you die and for some this could have been a hard question but for Victor his Godly Zeal made him kick over that altar oh I can't believe this I can't believe it oh my goodness he kicked over the Altar and this made the emperor so mad oh my goodness and well they cut off his leg and he was later Taken to a grain to a Mill and it was crushed under the millstones I'm sorry I'm taking so much of your time but it's just so amazing I me and he didn't let go that's what's amazing he identified himself with the word he became the word that's amazing what do you think well I didn't write one but one does come to mind you know when we think of Martyrs especially the disciples we think mostly of well Peter Steven uh do you all remember the story of Andrew well just for a facts if you need a refresher Andrew was Peter's younger brother and uh tradition has it that he preached to many Asiatic Nations and he was crucified in Essa now this story takes place in about 66 ad Andrew was in Greece and he voluntarily went to the governor and his name was agias and he was trying to persuade him not to persecute the Christians and then he was also telling him that the things that he and his people were doing were wrong they were worshiping Idols false gods and he told the governor he said it is good for you a judger of men the first know your judge who sits in heaven all this saying along with all the other words that Andrew was saying made the king mad and he said are you the same person who has overthrown the Temple of the Gods and is persuading and telling the men to be superstitious and go against the thing of Rome things of Rome and he answered the king and he said the Romans don't understand the truth he said Jesus came down from heaven into the world to teach you that the things that you are doing are wrong he said the false gods and uh Idols you worship are not Gods but they are devils he said you teach the people to do the very things which are offensive to God so he turns away from you I mean can you believe that and not even know you're doing it like that's that's crazy so then he said at this point he said when they serve Devils the people fall into wickedness and after they're dead the only thing left for them is their evil Deeds at this the governor was enraged mad Furious and he said enough he said if you ever preach or teach your Doctrine again he said we will fasten you to a cross with haste and this is the good part I can imagine Andrew he probably you know took a breath in knew what he had to say and do and I can imagine he maybe squared his shoulders a little bit looked the governor boldly in the eye and told all the people and he said sir if I was afraid of the cross I would not have taught the glory majesty and honor of it at these words it was done he was sentenced to be crucified as they were nearing the place of the execution he wasn't sad but he was he was filled with joy to go out of this world the same way his Lord did on a cross he said the nearer I am to the cross the near near I am to God the farther away from the cross the farther I am from him for 3 Days Andrew was hung on this cross he was instructing and telling the people around to steadfast hold steadfastly to the words of the promises of God and the doctrine they had received from him after 3 days the Christians went to the governor to ask him for his release so they can he could be released to them at this point he said oh Lord he said let not your servant uh to be be released to dwell among men again he said I have known you I have loved you and I have kept your ways he said you are the one I desire to see he said it is in you I am what I am having said his final words on this Earth he committed his Spirit into his Lord's hands and what stood about what stood out to me about Peter uh Andrew sorry was he wasn't afraid to tell the people yeah I'm a Christian I will willingly take up my cross and follow Christ and I think that's it's a good lesson for you know not only Us but make it personal me we shouldn't be ashamed afraid or embarrassed to take up our cross and follow Jesus and well that's what I had to say this gospel really is dripping with blood isn't it it [Music] [Applause] is has always been the the outs scourers of the earth they were hated by all people cast out in alleys anywhere they could live yes amen read Hebrews 11 and take the last six or eight verses of it how they wandered about in deserts and and wearing sheep skins and goat skins and was destitute and Afflicted and tormented those people that are how our testimonies stand up against theirs in the day of the Judgment those people in that day [Music] [Music] hello youth if you wouldn't mind coming up to do your bow and uh and that'll be it from [Music] us all the youth who were involved come on up if you were in the stage design music whatever was you were doing come on up guys you guys can keep applauding you don't have to worry about us it's okay okay go sit down you guys did it good job guys you guys did great amen God bless our youth this evening I'm many enjoyed that before we go any further we have one one more witness I'm going to ask sister Ruth Collins if she'd come up and her testimony to the Lord God bless you um sorry Pastor i g to use notes um first of all I want to thank my pastor Tommy William for making the stand you did for my brother our founding Pastor thank you so much um my testimony started um in 1979 my youngest daughter Pam was uh eight years old and she used to go to church with my neighbor they would go with brother Nick Castillo and she used to invite me every Sunday mother you want to go and I'd say and I would say no I said pray for me baby I'm not going I don't feel lad well it took two months and after two months one Sunday I told her you don't have to go with a neighbor no more I'm taking with me I'm going to church too so my sister Rachel Jonathan's mother and Matthew's mother and I and I had I have four children and Rachel has four children we climbed into my car and we were packed like sardines but we were going to church anyhow we got there and um excuse me um uh after about two or three weeks uh our founding pastor and his congregation would go to church there with brother Nick and that was about every two or three weeks and uh in between I would think well where do they meet during the week well I started asking around I asked sister Carol and sister Lucy where do you guys meet during the week she said we meet in different houses to pray said okay okay there so they were meeting at this certain place and um I knocked on the door and I went in and I founding pastor says what are you doing here I said I came to pray I says he said you don't belong here well I do and I'm staying and he okay anyhow I continued and every time I went and he tell me the same thing what are you doing here I said he says I guess you can stay I said to myself I'm not going nowhere I'm staying either way anyhow um sorry okay one um my my husband brother Ross would go to church with me once in a while and um one day Tommy uh asked me he says you and Ross want to go with with us to TRC to a prayer meeting to L house and I said sure we had a big car those nice cars where your honey you could sit next to your honey yeah I like those cars anyhow so uh my husband drove and then was Tommy and L in the front seat sister Viola sister Ruth and myself were in the back seat we were going through the black range and brother r a cigarette and I told him what are you doing he I want to smoke I says no you're not cuz then we going to stink and Tommy turns back and tells me hello okay and then we already get to TC and I know he knew what was up well that was our pastor he knew dealt with him or we got there to Sister Lucy's house and we all started praying and the power of the Lord came down real strong and um the presence of God was so thick it was this was something new for me and I had never witnessed that before and a prophecy came by God he used Freddy py if any of you remember Freddy pel fredd and um he gave he prophesied or the Lord prophesied to brother Ross and he told him a lot of things but I I don't remember them but one thing he did say that had SLI my mind he told brother Ross I give you your son I had forgotten about this prophecy and uh about a month ago my pastor and sister uh La came to our house and um he was talking with my son and the Lord spoke to me and said remember the prophecy that I was going to give you your son so I started telling Pastor he said you got to give this testimony the reason why um our founding Pastor didn't want me there at the at the meetings at the houses because he didn't want uh my pastor then Nick to think that he was proel liting anyhow after we left that prayer meeting my brother rush through the cigarett out the window and after that he never touched a cigarette or a beer he was delivered completely and I'm pretty sure our founding Pastor knew what was up that's why he invited us where we continued going with brother Nick Nick and um I we passed in front of a sword Tabernacle where they were meeting and uh sister Lucy told me I would honk at them and they would wave at me and she said you know what you know what brother Pettis said She's mine and she'll be here with us pretty soon and I said after she told me that I said okay I got some work to do so I made a meeting with brother Nick and I told him we're we're moving he says where are you going where I'm going to go to church with brother Tommy my brother and he said but why what have I done to hurt you or what I said nothing but I belong over there I said I belong with him because I am his sheep so he said okay I I hate to see you go but I you go with my blessings that was my pastor told me to do do it the right way anyhow we we went and we started we became members of SW Tabernacle with my precious brother which I miss so much

to be here standing before you this evening amen let us turn to our scripture really quick that way we are not standing so long Matthew 2717 maybe a little bit of a strange scripture for for such a time as this but hopefully the Lord willing that we can uh express to you the thought that the Lord has given and our pastor thank you for the the confidence H for the ministry thank you amen and it says therefore when they were gathered together isas said unto them whom will ye that I release unto you barabus or Jesus which is called Christ man you may be seated a little strange H amen I I really youth I really enjoy the drama you know that's one thing when I when I first read the uh the fox's book of martys FO yeah some sometimes you can't help but think man your your testimony is nothing compared to these brothers bet to Lions beheaded it was rough time that our brothers went through whom the world is not worthy amen but they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb word of their testimony amen you know I I the lord gave me this this quote right here from from brother Brandon I had no idea why I put it on there and as the drama's going forth and I'm hearing the hearing them talk here in the table I I understood why because a lot of times we think that right or am I the only one that that our testimony can't compare to that am I the only one no I have thought that I've read that book several times and it it hits me every time can't help but shed tears Now Youth are you taking notes now now we all know what over the what the meaning of to overcome means right to keep life in you with there's more to it than that brother brandham says here in the message how can I overcome he says overcome means to recognize the devil and every one of his tricks imagine that to overcome is to know the devil and every one of his tricks he goes on to say a lot of people say there is no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there's a real devil he's just as real as you are or anybody a real devil and you must recognize him recognize him real you must know he's a devil then the same time that you recognize him and know that he's a devil and he's against you I like this part right here then here's the here's the another definition for you of the word overcome then to overcome you must recognize that God in you is greater and mightier than he is you're not acting like your God is your God is great and M come on now you're not acting like that are we defeated are are are do we think our testimony can't can't compare to these brothers our brothers our brother Steven how he was stoned the first martyr recognize the tricks that the devil pulls on us that is a trick that he uses all your testimony is nothing that is a trick that he uses pulls pulls on on us but you must recognize that God in you is greater and mightier than he is the one that's in you has already overcame him and Christ in you makes you an overcomer amen amen now for me now I want Ronnie of 2023 to die now I'm not just saying that because I'm up here it's the end of the year it's something good to say stimulate you a little bit kind of get you moving move the crowd no no no no

message from me as you all know but I want Ronnie to die Ron has to die this nature of Ronnie the Gonzalez he's got to die okay your nature our natur has to die as I said I'm tired of seeing of things in a negative light all the time I don't I me I'm talking about myself I'm opening up my heart a little bit to you okay I'm not speaking for nobody I have to preach my experience if I get up here and preach somebody else's experiences I'm a liar and that's one thing I do not want do in behind the pp I do not lie they used to make fun of me all the time they say oh brother Ronnie she there he goes saying he's nervous again it's a delicate thing to stand behind it makes me nervous because I handled the word not because I don't know because I don't want to purposely or maliciously lead somebody in a way they shouldn't shouldn't be led that is never an intent for a minister shouldn't be there should never be an intent of a minister I'm not trying to make myself sound good I'm not trying to make myself look good Ronnie has to die Ron has to die out there before he gets back here and I want Ronnie to stop looking at things in a negative way brother time we were talking to H I said I was going to mention this I'm tired of seeing the things as half full looking at the glass half full right because we have two perspectives right you can see it as half full or half empty I'm tired of seeing things half full I'm tired of seeing things half empty I don't want both I'm sorry I don't want to be a a Halfway Christian I don't want halfway Perfection I don't want halfway Holiness I don't want halfway to be a Christian halfway I want the whole thing filled up I want to see things as they are fully I'm tired of seeing those things church I don't want it I'm finally I'm fine to see a little bit the tricks that Satan is trying to pull on me and that is one of the things that he pulls on us all the time it's seeing things in the negative form oh but this is going on this is going on this brother and that brother it's the tricks of the devil I'm tired of seeing those things that way brother Caleb since you started preaching these messages on what think you of Christ now we people say this all the time ministers say this all the time it's the greatest Ministry of the greatest series of messages no it hasn't been I'm sorry it's been beating me up it's been beating the beating me up every single message that I've heard since that very first one that you preached it's been beating me up brother he gets up here he beat me up here brother Tommy he beat me up I'm in my car I'm listening to a message I'm getting beat up I listen to brother Bram he's beating me up what think you of Christ what think ye of Christ tired of seeing things in a negative halfway filled again I don't want to be a Halfway Christian I want to be filled you remember that little drama I put you guys I showed you with the Cup being filled that's what I want I want my f to my cup to be running over to be running over exceedingly abundantly what think you of Christ the second we hear that for the most of us we get a a picture in our mind right right see don't tell me nobody can say no because I know we [Music] do what think you of Christ now I want everybody to look around okay how many are the word look around come on brothers and sisters look around now these now these people are are believers in the word we believe that we are the word and if they are the word then they are the fourth Bible which is the living Bible which is the living word amen amen can I get a witness now when we read the scripture your Bible took my brought my tablet it up here we read the scripture there's absolutely nothing wrong with the scripture there's no contradictions in the in the Bible this is 100% the word of God there's there's no discrepancies there's absolutely nothing wrong with this I tell my kids I tell some of the youth and the children your Bible never goes on the floor this is precious this is the word of God it never goes on the floor nothing ever goes on top of it this is precious this is my precious nothing ever goes on top of it and it never goes below anything no I'm talking about this Bible this word again there is absolutely nothing wrong with this book now now when we as we heard this morning and we as we heard the prophet of God if we we're reading the scripture and we see something if we don't see Christ in that scripture we have to go back we read it wrong we we got to go back and and see if we can see Christ in it again there's nothing wrong with the scripture now if I don't see Christ in there there is something wrong with the way that I saw that maybe my interpretation of of what I think that is is wrong I must see Christ in every scripture now brother Noah raised his hand that he's the fourth Bible now when I read it the book I must see Christ in every scripture there's not something wrong with with the word of God as per se there's nothing wrong with the word now if I don't see Christ in the way I read the Bible I must go back and read it again what think ye of Christ amen what think ye oh and once I see in brother Noah well wait a minute I rais I Rose my hand too that I'm that I'm the living Bible now when I looked at myself in the mirror which is the word of God did I see Christ if I didn't see Christ I have to go back and look at myself in the mirror again and see if I see Christ amen amen until then if I as long as long as I see Christ in the Bible as long as I see Christ in these great men and as long as I don't see Christ in brother Noah as long as I see I don't see Christ in brother Andrew do know Andrew brother Ethan Ethan brother Jimmy jimy as long as I don't see Christ in them I'm seeing the glass half empty half empty something that is half something half is hybrid I must see it fully say oh well brother Ronnie I don't know about that well isn't there are we not supposed to put not supposed to put a razor blade between the brothers if you can put you separated it you separated that scripture as we heard this morning now time's almost up okay going back to the scripture pilot said to the religious people of the day he says whom will ye that I release unto you barab or Jesus which is called the Christ now Christ is in us which is the hope of glory right amen amen now if I can't see Christ brother Noah but you know what but maybe God just maybe he did something to offend me maybe he did something to offend me now I'm reading that scripture with a hybrid condition oh God no no no no no brother Ronnie yeah but brother no I know no I can see Christ brother Ronnie but not brother Noah oh he did something to me he said something that just don't know brother Ronnie has Christ brother no I don't no half empty what are we going to release in US is the power to to loose or in the power bind are you going to lose barabus which was a carnal man am I going to lose Noah the carinal man or I going to lose Noah which is called the Christ not that he's Christ no no no no no no no then it makes me it makes him an antichrist to say that Christ dwells on him now that's a different story who who will you release who shall you release this new year brother Noah rnie oh he's got it now brother Andres and no oh no not even close what did you release to the brother did you release barabus or releas Jesus called the Christ I'm going end with this because whatsoever you lose will God lose don't be guilty of putting the lid on the jar brother will that was good I enjoyed that you don't know what I'm talking about go back and listen to brother William's message what we need what I need what Ronnie needs what Ronnie needs is this right here in the message evil Age golden age when the enemy comes in like a flood raise a standard against it why his word but I've read the seal books I've read all the Bible Lord I've read the Hebrews Lord and I'm still lacking still lacking Lord this is the standard that he is raising he is raising you and he is raising I you and I but you have to respect me and I have to respect you and when you and I get together that's the standard that God that's God's standard because without you and I God doesn't have a standard God doesn't have a standard he says are you with me can I get a witness and I'm GNA leave you with this Brother Carlos Carlos if he can come up here and I'm going to play it for you you and thy are the elements that God has here to make it and outside of you and die there will be no Resurrection here so the standard has to be raised how is it by respecting one another if I did wrong forgive me am if you did wrong I forgive you said that for this I played that for this brother Caleb said this at the beginning of of of this series and I'm talking everybody okay I'm not leaving anybody out it's time that we start living like Christ is amongst us everywhere youngest to the oldest left right up and down diagonal it's time church that we start living like Christ is Among Us you want God to raise a standard start changing the way you see things as I am trying to do my best myself amen God bless you brother Jimmy sister Virginia if you'd come and give your special to the Lord to blame me more [Music] [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Music] of me [Music] [Music] for [Music] S you for me [Music] so me [Music] [Music] for me God [Music] [Music] me what [Music] for me [Music] [Music] where [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] Grand [Music] for [Music] s for [Music] me be [Music] for [Music] [Music] for and Cru [Music] [Applause] amen amen God bless brother Jim Virginia for that give another round stand if you would tur in your Bibles to the book of Philippians chapter 2 and if the if they would put that that same title what what think ye of Christ because I find I find in this in this title in this in this phrase I find that that we we we misunderstand a lot of times because when we hear the word [Music] think automatically we we go back to Webster's Dictionary weer and we make the assumption that when Jesus asks what think ye that he's looking for a thought in their brain that he that he wants to pick their brain for the thought book of Philippians chapter 2 verse 5 and it says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus and if we go to Book of Proverbs chapter 23 we find out a detail here that only Believers know the Book of Proverbs chap 23:7 tells us for as he thinketh in his heart so is he and may the Lord add his His blessings to the reading of the word and you may be seated you see when when when Jesus asks the disciples what think ye of Christ he wasn't looking for their brain many people think that we think in our brain and you know you realize that that is the greatest deception the devil has ever pulled over it is the root cause of all of the issues that we run into in our walk the greatest battle that's ever fought it's in the mind and it's because in the brain is where all information is stored Good the Bad and the Ugly it's all in the brain but it's not in the mind so when Jesus asked the disciples what think ye of Christ he wasn't looking in their brain he was looking for the mind that they should have had he was looking for his mind he wanted to see if they really knew that stood in front of them that stood in front could they identify him why because that mind that they should have had his mind it wasn't their own thought he wasn't looking for their own thought process you know I realized that when I was sitting back there in the back and I'm not throwing at anybody but this is why I say it's the greatest deception that devil has pulled over on us because when the minister asks the question who's the bride of Christ half of us go who's saved half of us go why because we're accessing the files in our brain because when we're thinking about the question we're thinking about it and we're referencing all the bad things that we've done we're looking at all the things that we messed up we're we're thinking about all the people that have offended us we're thinking about all the bad things that we've said and thought we're thinking about all the all the negative things and that brother Ronnie is why we get Negative Tendencies is because we process the questions from our brain but not from our mind and a Believer was never called to process things from your brain you were called to process things from the abundance of your heart that's where the mouth speaks you want positive things in your life you want positive things speak from the abundance of the heart from the abundance of your brain that's why the fight is always there because Satan's always trying to get you process it from your brain remember all the things that you did are you the bride of Christ and your brain registers I did this I did that I I could possibly be the bride of Christ but out of the abundance of the heart when the Mind speaks when the mind the Mind speaks from Christ and when the Mind speaks the brain speaks first remember what the brother did to you but then the Mind speaks oh but I forgive him remember what the sister did to you but then the mind oh but glory to God I forgive them remember what you did yesterday but then the Mind by his stripes when the brain speaks your daughters sick then the Mind speaks but he said she'd be healed when the brain speaks and it tells you you're not worthy remember that on that cross then the brain then the Mind speaks then the Mind speaks by his stripes he was wounded for your transgression when the brain speaks remember all the bad things that you did the Mind speaks but he was wounded for my iniquity by his St I am healed because until we can speak until we can process the revelation of what think ye of Christ from the mind will never be able to come to the full realization of the answer because it's not here it's not up here it's here so when the minister asks are you the Bride of Jesus Christ don't process it here process it here let here speak forth what think you of Christ in your mind not in your in your brain I never understood brother branham's statement when he that he makes in the 70 weeks of Daniel and he says there'll be a famine for spiritual food and I always thought that maybe we should be like a prepper the ones that prepare a lot that maybe we should just store up all the books and all the tapes and that's good there's nothing wrong with that but then I hear the chief oh thank God for that man then I hear the chief and he says it's not that you need all the books and the tapes that's not enough all the books and the tapes you got to store them in your computer you got to take them all into your mind that's why it's so important and I understand that when you read the word you hear the word pay attention don't be doing other things because you have to record it in your mind it has to override all the negativity and when you begin to fill up the files in your brain then my little boy asked me a question this morning he said Dad how does a minister get himself out of the way and it took me a minute because I couldn't explain it but all of a sudden I remembered what the chief said it's when you get the mind when a minister speaks from the mind not the brain when he speaks from the mind then the anointing of Christ begins to access the files that are St in the [Applause] bra he begins to take control it's no longer your words just accessing your file he's assembling it and putting it together so when we go out and we witness to people the Bible says don't worry about what you'll say why because the files should be here so that Christ can access what's inside he'll assemble the words he'll put it together what think you of Christ not in your brain don't think Christ in your brain think Christ using that mind and when you do you will begin to act answer every question with such Aur that no demon in hell will move you because it's no longer I that liveth it's no longer I that think no longer I that speak it's no longer I that walkth no long I thatth no longer I that worship it is Christ in me in me the hope of glory god bless [Applause] you Hallelujah brother Ronnie and everyone that's participated in the program this evening may the Lord Jesus Christ bless you they asked me brother Diego uh speak to us about 2023 for you this is my humble opinion for brother Diego the year 2023 it has been the best year of my life it's been the most wonderful year for me I haven't wanted a more great experience and most glorious exper then this year and let me tell you why two times brother I was at the hospital at the in the ICU I I I I'm almost dying and so that's why I went to the hospital otherwise I wouldn't have gone what a year Allelujah and if this if this were something small let me tell you the best part Satan he is trying he's trying to to give me a cancer I feel I've been God's favorite in the year 2023 God knows I'm speaking the truth I'm speaking from my heart I received a call about two months ago a friend a brother a minister he says brother Diego how do you feel how are you please tell me how can I help you and I said friend I feel wonderful today is the best day I am so grateful to [Music] God that he has uh held me worthy to go through these trials and and I tell him imagine Satan he's trying to put a cancer on me and the brother was a little bit shaking say brother Diego I thought you g say oh brother hurts oh I'm so sick oh the devil look brother oh this is terrible this so hard it's my humble opinion someone could say B Diego you have a problem that cancer is going to kill you no no let me make a small correction brother Diego does not have a problem cancer has a problem because I have a promise you know what cancer means cancer means death you know how cancer is the Lord showed me it is a dark shadow brother BR was sister there's a a dark shadow around around you you have cancer and cancer means death and I have news for for this cancer because the Bible tells me of one that said oh death canc oh cancer oh death I will be your death why I speak this way because I'm not afraid and if someone has cancer someone has a sickness let me tell you I understand you but I believe in him that said one day I am the resurrection and the life if we open the scripture R in Romans chapter 5:3 and the scripture says Apostle Paul chapter 5 verse3 in Romans here you'll understand my craziness says and not only so but we glory in the good times no no no no we Glory when everything is good no here's the Apostle Paul we Glory let me let me say something I will speak as a missionary do you not believe I'm a missionary I I know you you seem a bit but I'll say for the first time because I want you to understand this point I am also a missionary and when the team from here goes I even I'm the first one that goes let me tell you I could glory in that no no C can can a sheep glory in himself and say oh look at my wall what a beautiful wall no no that is his nature we can't Glory ourselves in those things but as a Christian there's one thing that we can glory in and that's in Tri in the problem difficulties because that's where where we can glory and see the hand of God that's the trial when dieo or when no can tell God how much I love him how much I need him the trial does not change anything but also the trial it helps me to prove to Satan who I'm on brother Branham said if Satan through the through through through the law of sin can can can put a Cancer and man recognizes it and accepts it he he didn't get it listen here's the key Satan through the law of sin he can put a Cancer and man recognizes and accepts it that is why Satan sent me a letter a cancer uh my friend Diego forgive me but that letter is not for me I don't recognize it I don't accept it Satan through the law of sin he can do these disgraces how much more Christ dwells in us who died when Jesus was here he showed his power Jesus said I have power to lay down my life and I have power to take it up again when Jesus came he cast out demons when Jesus came he healed the sick now I asked when Jesus dies on the cross what happened with that that power where is that power did that power go away let me help you Jesus said now all power all power not only did he had the power receed more power brother brandham said he received more power and where is that power everything that was in God he pour into Christ and where is that power now everything that was in Christ he put it he P it he pour it here that's why can cancer I am your cancer the word chaos it's it's the worst definition we say oh it went out of control this happened this happened and that happened and it was a chaos as an expression to say no one had control the Bible tells me of a place where there was a chaos there is no way for man to be a region called Gad that region was famous because one man that had a legion more than 6,000 demons this region was it was crazy the these this man would go where they were cultivating and the people would run they would find it destroyed this man was a chaos his Fame it had gone out nobody wanted to go to gader and everybody knew what happened in there in gadera Satan through 6,000 demons had placed a chaos the word demon it means Tormentor it was a chaos but here comes a man that gets down from the first thing that happens this demon this man the scripture says these demons they cried out and they said Jesus why have you come son of the almighty to to torment us just wait wait a moment there was a chaos but here comes a man who is the chaos to the chaos yes brother Jesus you come to torment us oh brother I'm tired for of sickness always following and disappointment is always following a bad economy it's time to look back begin to speak the correct word because he the same one that faced this Legion he is the same one that is here that is here that is here and the the same that was over there it's the same thing that has to happen here when I heard this said wow Lord Lord told me I am the high priest of your confession hallelujah oh Allelujah doesn't say I'm the high priest of your depression I'm the high priest of your complaint I'm not the Christian has to confess the word speak declare I am healed brother brandham said God God will make your body to submit itself what God the god that and Heavens the universe the Angels won he make this Earth submit itself God he is here he is here look Henry look brother Henry the Lord shows me this see you have a contract in your hand you're you don't have it yet in your hand but your wife has it sister and I see you both happy but I see something else I see an inheritance such a a big land that I Rejoice because I know it's yours seeing that it's such a wonderful great blessing I see you're not conscious of of that blessing I see you have this contract in your hand and I want you to realize that there's an inheritance for you if you can have for that blessing which is this land that belongs to you and this contract that I see you have in your hand Concord correctly hen oh brother Henry I don't see a limit to all the things you can do the anointing Jacob Lord shows me this friend I see we're walking together and you begin to speak to me of that wonderful lady that was your wife and you speak to me about her my friend and you tell me just such wonderful things and I see your heart and I can discern it and I can see that you're telling me the truth you love this lady so much this lady must have felt so proud having a husband like you brother Jacob listen to this my brother you have to go on forward because I can see that there exists the possibility that you stay stuck there she is fine she must have felt very proud of having been by your side life must continue brother Jacob I see wonderful things he's here thank you Lord David David I'll tell you this the Lord takes me to your house I see you open up the door for me and I see a big smile how you always have one and you say brother Diego I'm struggling I have problems in my economy I want to ask you is this the truth for David if God God can show me these things this can have you to have some Faith there is a scripture that says for you have received a righteous man you should receive a righteous man reward for you have received a prophet you should receive a prophet's reward I believe I see that you open the door and I see you receive me I'll speak a word and God will honor that word Lord I pray for your son at this moment along with all the church Satan let go of his economy everything that is hindering everything that is uh bringing a setback every failure in the name of Jesus Christ we rebuke you reproach you out we face you we face you let go of our brother's economy Lord exalt your name everything will be fine Brother David I see something fabiio Fabio I'll say something might help you to make a make decisions if you think it's brother Diego there'll be no virtue in these words but my brother Fabio if you believe is the holy spirit this information will help you very much to to achieve many objectives in Vision I see you will return you will return to Colombia I don't see that you return back to the United States perhaps you haven't yet made that decision not yet but brother Fabio I see I see that there is a time for you and I want to ask a question don't have to answer what would you do if God gave you three months you will die in three months no that's not what I'm saying what if God gave you a year I'm speaking of a time man of God what would you you do what changes would you make to better to achieve many things what would you do my friend these words only try to stir up your faith Faith servant of God and I'll make a prayer because I know you believe me Lord I pray for your Serv along with your children father now that he returns there's a work to do in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord give him wisdom and place the words so that he can achieve all the desires he has in his heart that wonderful people in Colombia Lord that he can see that is our prayer that he can see that Revival that you have promised for Colombia Lord that it may be that he may be that important part in the name of Jesus Christ the Lord is here if this is the preface if this it's only joing a trial the things that this that that we'll see in this next the next Minister can please come for forward how can we not be grateful if you are sick after you have seen God move it would be a sin to go out sick believe him declare confess and live the word may the Lord bless you it was the best year God bless [Applause] you what a time we've had I want us to I thank the the ministers this this today and I am grateful for the their lives grateful for each one that that has taken a part today and throughout the year I'm grateful to our pastor for what he means to us and um as we draw uh at the end of this time and enter into the new new new time uh Joshua would tell the people uh follow the ark because you haven't been by this way before and so as we we go into new territory and we go into the newness of life we we want to go in with full assuredness of faith that he which started good work in us will finish it and I uh am grateful tonight for the opportunity that he has given us I don't want us to to have go into this year haphazardly but we go in with full vision and uh I appreciate the word of God so much this morning and I I thank God every day I I've I've learned so much through the ministry of of of our pastor I'm um a person that that has probably been caught or in a bridge between two um at uh a character I'm a revolutionary um but in in in position we've got to make sure that there is an establishment of the Kingdom we cannot be as Paul says one that beateth the air every every every blow we throw has got to hit the mark we we cannot be pcha style we have to be the third part of Christ the mystery to restore rest the kingdom and as we draw an eye to this we must draw an eye with full assuredness of Faith Jesus in the 16th chapter of the book of St John says this in the world you will have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world if I can can can leave you with some thoughts tonight I want to leave you with uh some encouragement the encouragement uh uh of uh of that what we will be facing this year was uh in one way was a was a difficult year but in in uh the most glorious of all the years because we understand the scripture says that that the sufferings of this present world are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us so whatever sufferings we may have gone through they are not the equal of the glory that God wants to reveal in us because the glory of the latter house is more glorious than the glory of the former [Music] house and so we we understand through all our ups and our Downs that it all depends on our attitude and I've learned this so much from our our pastor of how to keep our attitude I I I want to more than ever before as we see the lights of that City coming towards us and as we're going to that City I want us to understand this that we as as a people have got to make the clearcut decisions as for me and my house we will serve the Lord and as we draw nigh to two 2024 again may we draw nigh with auress of faith of attitude what is our attitude I appreciate all the messages that were spoken tonight and what more could we say than what has already been said but I want us to check our attitude I need to check my attitude every day am I a person of a negative or will I be a positive person not posit and only Doctrine but bringing the word of God to pass in my generation but it starts off with our my attitude and I want to read this for you a little bit in part of this country in the 1980s when the Wolves were in danger of extinction there was a special Bounty offered for wolves caught alive each live wolf brought into captivity would bring $5,000 that turned two men Sam and Jad into Fortune Hunters Sam and jam they headed for the forest day and night they looked for their $5,000 wolf but they couldn't find him it was hopeless one night as they camped in a clearing Sam awoke to find more than 50 wolves surrounding the camp their eyes were flaming and their teeth were Beed he nudged his friend and said Jed wake up we're rich that's a pretty good attitude or what of the two men who were sent by a shoe manufacturer to a remote country to sell shoes one wrote back I have terrible news this is a god forsaken country nobody here wears shoes I'm coming home the other man wrote this is a wonderful country I am so grateful you sent me to this territory nobody here wears shoes send me 5,000 pairs what about the day when attitude won't carry the day what about our circumstances what about Paul and Silas cast into prison and you would just be crying to the Lord you would think we would be crying to the Lord Lord I am in prison but at midnight they started singing a song they started saying hallelujah they started praising the Lord they started giving him honor giving him glory and the prison chain started breaking you know why it is by attitude that we serve God what does he call us for why does he call us for he calls us to be a special people he calls us to be a royal priesthood he calls us to be a new generation so when St Matthew tells us barely barely I say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled what he's talking about he's talking about this race he's talking about this kind he's talking about this family he's talking about this St he talking about this breed of people never passed away until the purpose of God would be fulfilled in their life The Rock The Rock there is a rock a distracted man tripped over it a violent man used the rock as a weapon an industrious man built a house with it a tired farmer sat and rested on the Rock but David used it to beat Goliath Michel Angelo used it to create a masterpiece all these men had the same thing a rock but how it was used was up to each individual you can have the revelation of the hour but how you use that revelation will determine upon your year likewise this new year will be the same year that everyone is granted what we do with it is what will make the difference what does he call us to he calls us to a New Creation he calls us to a new a a new life he calls us and he says now this is my creation this is what I have created but now he is standing in the midst of the church stands there revealing who he is in this last day self the author of the creation of God this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special special designation of himself he is the creator of that church knowing if he is the creator of that church then we understand this I love when my papa would tell us this we are the best of God we are the best of God we are the best of God he said again tell your neighbor I am the best of God you are the best of God you are the best that God has you are the best that God has in this world this is my papa as everyone has said we miss him so much you know he gave us and he said this this is the best of God not the best of me the best of God this is the best that God has to offer you he says why did you turn that water into wine do you know that they keep the best for last was that do you know that they keep the best for last and this is the best it's the best wine you can find because it's the only wine that can give you the stimulation of Revelation nothing stimulates us like the real wine this is the wine you can get high on this wine it's good stuff you know they say the wine the older it gets the better do you know do you know how long God has stored this wine God has stored it for thousands of years in this church age in this time he pulled out the car he reserved it for you for me take this wine take this cup drink it for this is my blood do not fear he says this not demise I am with you do not be dismayed for I am your God I will strengthen and help you I will uphold you with my righteous right hand do you know how many people depend on you around the world they know who you are they know your names they know where you stand they know how you you worship they call me and they say where is that person that worships where is so and so I don't see him no more in the video or them I don't see them no more they know who you are they know your light they know your Fame they know your stance they know your position Philippians tells us do not be anxious about anything but in every situation by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving present your request to God and the peace of God which transcends all understanding guard your hearts your mind Christ Jes I never want us to make this common I never want us to think that this happens everywhere what you've seen our young people do today last week when you seen our children do here can I tell you something about the teachers of the of our little children one of the little children that had only been coming to church a couple of times she happened to go to a a family outing and she says we cannot we cannot eat till we pray and she didn't let them eat until they prayed know what the people of that place said those people in that church are the real thing that is a testament of what God has done in your life without us really realizing the effect that we have worldwide Matthew tells us so don't worry what shall we eat or what shall we drink or what shall we wear for the pagans run after these things and your heavenly father knows what you need them seek ye first the kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well therefore do not worry about tomorrow tomorrow will worry about itself each day has enough trouble of its own but Solomon tells us trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not unto your own understanding all your ways acknowledge Him and He will straight your path and Paul captures that revelation and he says this may the god of Hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit Solomon goes back and says my people which are called by my name humble themselves pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways I will hear from heaven will forgive their sin heal their land when we do that this is what I want is hearing the ministers tonight I don't want to say it's I or we or us did it that's when we did when we were in infancy but now as we become older When We Were Young when I was young I did as I wanted to but when I became an old man when I became an older man someone else tied my waist somebody else told me what to do somebody else told us let's go to Colombia somebody else told us let's go to Poland somebody else told us let go to UGA somebody said let's light the world on fire know why the revelation of the hour is not just to anybody to the new race this is a super race this is a super creation because it is God in his creation why we look at at at ourselves I look and I see can we at this point reach to what we H we have to reach I was driving the other day on on 70 I have never considered myself that I'm a missionary or a or anything of that nature of a title or any title that there is when somebody asks me what are you I am a help I looked at my papa I helped him and I helped him according to what he and I tried to be as faithful as I could when the time came that he could no longer do the daytoday and we there was we we we we went to the what was God called and what God had instituted and placed in this church the foundation of this church is sure sure there's no other Foundation that can be laid that's what's already been laid the foundation is laid this is an established headquarters and I and and as as as as we went through our process I told our pastor as I was with my papey will be with you and I've tried to be as faithful as I could even if I even if I don't feel to go I go anyway because I know that what God is obligated to is this he's not obligated to me but he is obligated to his and this word has been established here we don't look anywhere else for any word the word has already been founded in our heart already sealed with the Holy Ghost and it is not sinking sand is the rock of eternal life eternal salvation as I'm driving on 70 after doing missionary work for 35 years I'm driving and I hear the Lord say for me say to God I finally felt what my papa felt and I ask myself the question what I what are you doing here what am I doing here should be out there I should be out there helping people and I don't want cedar heels to get to the place of jealousy where they think when we we're going out that we don't care oh we go out because we do care and we leave you in very capable hands we never leave you as orphans and our heart is to be here but our heart is to be out there where they've never heard one time they've never heard the name of Jesus much less the name of William brandham William Bram but in this new creation it causes a chain reaction and it causes us to take the Great Commission into all the world the gopel when we do that I tell Mya this I feel my papa more in the mission field than I do anywhere else because that's where his heart was at we as people of Promise must got to understand this I I'll leave you with this when those who are called to fish don't fish they fight when energy intended to be used outside is used inside the result is explosive instead of casting Nets we cast stones instead of extending Helping Hands we point fingers instead of being Fishers of the Lost we become critics of the saved instead of helping the hurting we hurt the helpers the result church scrooges this this is what captured she the queen of sheba's attention she saw Solomon in his in his in his throne the Bible says that the streets were lined with bars of silver and when she saw the wisdom of Solomon she was so OD by that wisdom but that's not the only thing that captured her attention she says your servants are so happy when they serve you we're having another church service wow we have prayer meeting on on Saturday wow we have church service on Sunday morning now they want to have one on satday night oh that's too much but your servant she said we're so happy to serve this is the attitude that we must have when we that are called to fight the enemy start fighting each other because we are the best fighters in the world and we come to church ah the bunks are too hard ah the pews they're so they're they're they're too hard oh the song worship was too long first service was why was too long and then we have to go visit the brothers can you imagine if Jesus Christ he's on the cross and instead of saying I didn't have to come here not my will but thy will be done but he opened up his arms and he said this is how much I love you he got a hold of the cross for you and me and it became a joy lay down his life at that moment of suffering when he couldn't get when his body it seemed could not take it anymore and the Bible says that drops of sweat like blood what had happened he died of a broken heart his his heart had torn in two and when he couldn't no more he started looking in time and when he looked down the corridor of time saw you you stand you stand cuz he knew without you you would only see to the Cross to the suffering but he knew that we wouldn't just see to the Cross we would see through the cross on the other side the resurrection no wonder he says I am don't look for it anywhere else I am the resurrection and the life you might be tired right now because it's almost midnight but let me tell you if you can just go a little bit farther without the holy ghost without the Holy Ghost the Bible says David encouraged himself he didn't need for Tommy Jr to preach him a message he might have felt down he knew the Lord is my shepherd not want encour en himself in the Lord when you feel down when you look at men of renowned men in our time we have been blessed by God to live in the apostles generation what you are receiving now is the apostles rain and that's what we are looking at searching for RO for warts on an on others while ignoring the warts on our nose crooked fingers that bypass strength and point out weaknesses poor testimonies broken hearts legalistic Wars and sadly the poor go unfed confused go uncounseled confused go uncounseled and the loss go unreached when those who are called to fish don't fish they fight but when those who are called to fish fish they flourish an afternoon project an afternoon service project a visit to the hospital God bless you my brother I just came to see how you what happened Christ showed up to your to your time before brother faio goes back home I want each and every one of you to shake his hand we are living in that generation of the Apostles it's been a pleasure to have him here for the last 10 months [Applause] amen he was my papa's best friend and because he's my papa's best friend our best what have you seen today what have we seen in this world you shall always have tribulation there's always going to be somebody that don't like you get over it there's always going to be somebody that say You're A Hallelujah you're a Holy Roller malah 45 believer this world you shall always have tribulation you always hear people say brother brand made mistakes and I say this God Don't Make Mistakes I I don't
