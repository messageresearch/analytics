[33:51] oh
[33:55] believe all things things are
[34:01] possible
[34:03] ho
[34:06] [Music]
[34:13] believe and we read Luke 1 verse 37 and
[34:24] 38 for with God nothing shall be in
[34:30] impossible and Mary
[34:33] said behold the handmade of the
[34:37] Lord be it unto me according to Thy
[34:42] word and the angel departed from
[34:47] her God bless you you
[34:56] may Maria
[34:58] incred
[35:00] mecia Maria
[35:46] and she made her way down along the path
[35:49] I believe or I might say this as a
[35:52] little drama that she was thinking about
[35:55] what happened the day before and after
[35:57] they had come from church while it was
[36:00] customary that her engaged husband
[36:04] Joseph was to uh uh come home with her
[36:07] that day for
[36:09] dinner and as the dinner was made ready
[36:12] while they had had their dinner as usual
[36:15] they set out on the porch looking across
[36:17] the Little
[36:19] Valley over on the other side of the
[36:22] Hill Joseph was a
[36:24] cartender and knowing that he was fixing
[36:27] to Mary this beautiful young Jewish
[36:30] Maiden uh being a carpenter he was
[36:33] building their future home over on the
[36:36] other Hill so it you know I'd imagine it
[36:39] had to have that little Special Touch to
[36:41] it because is go to bring his Pretty
[36:44] Young Bride into this home it the doors
[36:47] had to fit just right and he was taking
[36:49] his time about doing it because he
[36:52] didn't want to hurry up job on this one
[36:55] he must be the windows must fit just
[36:57] right and the doors just right I'd
[36:59] imagine when he went in the gate might
[37:00] have been a big heart shape so that when
[37:03] he went in make the gate in the shape of
[37:04] a heart roses all around the house and
[37:07] they'd plan this for some time since
[37:09] their engagement they would go out there
[37:11] on say a Sunday afternoon and sat down
[37:13] on the porch and look just across where
[37:15] their future home would be and as a
[37:17] custom they'd speak about the Lord
[37:20] because they were both great Believers
[37:22] in
[37:24] God and this Sunday was a special one as
[37:28] they hurried dinner and got the dishes
[37:31] washed and Joseph was already sitting on
[37:33] the porch when Mary arrived and and it
[37:37] must have been a conversation something
[37:39] like this as they usually talked about
[37:41] the way the house was shaped and his how
[37:43] it would look and the rabbis would come
[37:46] home with them for dinner but instead
[37:49] they fell on the subject of the
[37:51] morning's message that he had heard from
[37:53] the rabbi the notable honorable one
[37:58] and uh perhaps it was Mary that said
[38:02] Joseph wasn't that a striking message
[38:06] this morning that the rabbi preached our
[38:10] beloved Pastor oh Joseph must have said
[38:13] that was an outstanding message I loved
[38:17] it so much when he spoke of that great
[38:21] Jehovah God who led our people out of
[38:24] Egypt did it not thrill you when he read
[38:27] the Scrolls of Exodus when they were
[38:30] brought out how that Jehovah LED them by
[38:34] a pillar of fire and they just had no
[38:38] Compass to go but they went by the
[38:41] leading of the
[38:43] spirit oh Mary wouldn't it be wonderful
[38:46] that if we could live all our lives
[38:48] watching that Pillar of Fire and be led
[38:51] like they were and how that when they
[38:53] needed food he reigned the Mana Out of
[38:56] Heaven they had bread and then when they
[38:59] needed flesh he blowed in quailes from
[39:02] the coast fill the ground and when they
[39:06] needed water he had a smitten Rock when
[39:08] they were sick he had a brass serpent
[39:11] for an atonement for their sickness and
[39:14] oh how great it was but he said
[39:18] sweetheart I believe he spared the whole
[39:20] thing when he said but alas
[39:23] Jehovah doesn't do that
[39:26] anymore somehow or another I've always
[39:28] believed that that Jehovah always
[39:32] Remains the Same Hallelujah he he just
[39:35] can't
[39:36] fail and I believe that the reason that
[39:39] we have uh living in the days that we
[39:42] are is because that our people has lost
[39:45] faith in
[39:47] Jehovah I believe that he is
[39:50] Immortal and he doesn't get old and fade
[39:52] away he just simply is the same Jehovah
[39:56] and he expects us I don't think that I
[39:58] would disregard or disrespect The
[40:00] Honorable Rabbi but when he said this
[40:03] morning in his message that Jehovah
[40:05] performed no more miracles that the only
[40:08] thing that he wanted us to do was to
[40:10] come to church and pay our TI live a
[40:14] good life as we could and he'd take us
[40:16] up home in glory I I can't hardly
[40:19] believe that Mary uh I believe that
[40:22] Jehovah wants us to walk with him like
[40:24] they did in that
[40:25] dayen and
[40:28] then it must have been that Mary said oh
[40:30] uh dear do you know we should read the
[40:33] scriptures first well if you've ever
[40:35] been in a Palestinian home and see some
[40:38] of the old ancient
[40:40] landmarks the books of the Bible was
[40:42] kept in a like a it's called a scroll
[40:46] rolled up on like a stick and they kept
[40:49] them in a container like a waste basket
[40:51] just stick them down in this container
[40:54] and like the scroll of Isaiah The Scroll
[40:56] of Jeremiah and all those prophets were
[40:58] in there and so it didn't make any
[41:00] difference which one they read because
[41:01] they know it was all ordained of God
[41:05] because it was their
[41:06] Prophet so Joseph said well I dear would
[41:11] would you go in and get one of the
[41:12] Scrolls she just a chance reached in to
[41:15] get the scroll and brought it out she
[41:17] said well dear today it seems like we
[41:19] read from the book of
[41:21] Isaiah so he pulled open the scroll and
[41:24] Joseph began to read and his m
[41:27] his eyes fell up on this
[41:30] potion a virgin shall
[41:33] conceive and shall bring forth a son
[41:37] they shall call his name
[41:39] counselor Mighty God Prince of Peace
[41:42] Everlasting
[41:44] father and when he got down to the end
[41:47] the little virgin lady sitting to the
[41:50] side said just a moment Joseph
[41:53] dear what does a prophet mean by a Virg
[41:58] conceiving well Joseph might have said
[42:01] this dear that's just a little too deep
[42:04] for me I do not understand it but I
[42:07] believe it it's just what the Bible said
[42:10] I don't know how it will ever happen but
[42:12] we know this dear if we know that Isaiah
[42:16] was Jehovah's
[42:18] Prophet therefore being Anointed with
[42:20] the holy spirit of God upon him he could
[42:23] not prophesy wrong because he was born
[42:26] to prophet and we know that his words
[42:29] are true and when he said a virgin shall
[42:32] conceive that was not Isaiah that was
[42:35] our
[42:36] Jehovah and Jehovah is able to do
[42:39] anything that he says that he'll
[42:41] do and as they spoke about it on down
[42:45] how his name would be called counselor
[42:48] Prince of Peace Mighty God Everlasting
[42:51] father and the government shall be up on
[42:53] his shoulders and there' be no end to
[42:54] his kingdom and so forth she said it
[42:57] must be the same one that the prophet
[43:01] Moses promised to us the Lord your God
[43:05] shall raise up a prophet like unto me
[43:07] therefore it must be the Messiah Joseph
[43:10] said I believe the scribes interpreted
[43:12] that way that this would be the
[43:15] Messiah that was to come and um as the
[43:19] evening passed on the night service Drew
[43:21] near while they went on back to church
[43:23] again and it was the next morning that
[43:25] she was going along for the water and
[43:28] she could hear the hammer across the way
[43:31] where the saw where Joseph was building
[43:33] on their house and as she got up and had
[43:36] her breakfast and stuck the little
[43:38] picture under her arm and started down
[43:40] to the city public well now if we had
[43:44] time I'd like to dwell on that well for
[43:46] a while but we don't have the time so as
[43:51] she was going along with her head down
[43:53] thinking she couldn't get it off her
[43:55] mind and she said that remark that
[43:58] Joseph made to me when I stopped him on
[44:01] that scripture of Isaiah
[44:04] 9:6 and how that he he said to me dear
[44:09] you know I think you always thought you
[44:11] was the most beautiful woman I ever
[44:14] seen but somehow in the last few minutes
[44:17] you've been more beautiful than ever
[44:19] you're big brown eyes
[44:23] sparkle and just when we mention this
[44:25] scripture
[44:27] did it thrill you or what's taking place
[44:30] well she wondered what was that when he
[44:33] said a
[44:34] child is born a son is
[44:37] given wonder what made me feel the way I
[44:40] did and just then as the little Maiden
[44:43] was walking she noticed something
[44:45] Flicker and she looked
[44:47] around and it must have been the sun she
[44:50] said that shined against a rock up on
[44:52] the desert Hill there
[44:54] somewhere and as she went on about her
[44:57] way thinking about what was taking place
[45:01] and what they'd been talking about she
[45:03] turned a corner that goes up to the city
[45:07] well where the ladies meet out there
[45:09] early the morning and let their uh
[45:12] buckets down they they Crocs more like a
[45:15] croc or a jug they got a long neck two
[45:18] handles they had a hook they hooked
[45:21] under in a Windle they let the jug down
[45:24] it being made out of clay while it sank
[45:27] they'd Windle the water back up and then
[45:29] set it up on top their heads and walked
[45:31] right on back home with maybe holding
[45:33] five or six gallons of water enough for
[45:36] the day unless they were washing and
[45:37] then usually they went to the places to
[45:40] wash
[45:42] now as she turned the corner she seen
[45:46] that light flicker
[45:48] again and as she looked when she had to
[45:51] pass to a little narrow place where just
[45:54] one person could pass down stood
[45:59] Gabriel the archangel
[46:02] Hallelujah it wasn't the son the s n she
[46:07] seen reflecting he was following her and
[46:11] he met her to where he got in a place
[46:13] where she'd have to look to him and she
[46:17] looked and he was all of a glow of light
[46:20] around him frightened the little
[46:23] virgin I had no doubt she grabbed her
[46:26] water pop and those big eyes stared out
[46:29] and looked at the Archangel he said Hail
[46:32] Mary or
[46:34] stop you're highly favored before God oh
[46:38] I like that Hallelujah that little woman
[46:42] in the meanest City there was in the
[46:44] world at that time no one meest city
[46:47] anyhow in
[46:48] Palestine and in
[46:51] there she had lived such a life until
[46:54] God chose her for a certain work that he
[46:57] was going to
[46:58] do there she looked into his
[47:02] face and it startled her you know it's
[47:07] usually as we are thinking on those
[47:11] things the Bible said if there be any
[47:14] praise if there be any virtue think on
[47:16] these
[47:17] things I think the reason we don't see
[47:20] no more of it and we do we got our minds
[47:22] on too many other
[47:25] things I think the Angels would still
[47:28] appear to us if we only kept our minds
[47:30] up on them yes amen but we're thinking
[47:34] about something else that where we're
[47:36] going a certain program we got to look
[47:39] at or or a certain shopping we got to
[47:42] do but our scripture tells us seek ye
[47:45] first the kingdom of God and his
[47:47] righteousness and all these other things
[47:50] will be added unto
[47:53] you and there then when we see
[47:58] that that he said th highly favored
[48:02] before
[48:04] God and we notice again I want don't
[48:08] want to leave this scripture but it was
[48:11] theopus and his friend on the road to
[48:13] emus as they were going along there
[48:17] brokenhearted speaking about Jesus being
[48:20] crucified and dead and the stories that
[48:24] they had heard about him being raised
[48:25] from the dead and they didn't believe it
[48:27] on the road going over going back to
[48:30] maybe go to work on Monday morning on
[48:34] the road back it was while they were
[48:38] thinking of him that he appeared to them
[48:42] stepped out of the bushes and begin to
[48:44] talk to him just like an ordinary man he
[48:48] said oh why are you so weary what's
[48:50] wrong with you they said are you just a
[48:52] stranger here do you believe now this
[48:56] this is kind of sticky but people who
[48:59] had walked with him and talked with him
[49:02] and walked all day with him after his
[49:04] resurrection the same Jesus and didn't
[49:06] know
[49:08] him he he will reveal himself to
[49:12] whosoever he will
[49:15] reveal oh I pray tonight that he'll take
[49:19] the shades from every one of our eyes
[49:22] and will come into this building and
[49:24] reveal himself in the power power of his
[49:27] resurrection that every person might see
[49:30] him the sinner as her savior the sick as
[49:34] her
[49:36] healer and we notice that he walked with
[49:39] them all day and then he made out like
[49:43] he was going somewhere else or going all
[49:46] by and they constrained him to come
[49:50] in Oh I like that constraining him to
[49:54] come in oh Jesus you
[49:57] you you're here in the church tonight
[49:59] you must go home with me Hallelujah I
[50:02] want to take you to my home I never want
[50:04] to lose this stealing of your presence
[50:07] let me take you home come in and abide
[50:10] with me never want to lose that feeling
[50:15] wouldn't that be
[50:16] wonderful Hallelujah you know I want to
[50:19] stop here in my message just a moment
[50:22] and say the most glorious things that I
[50:25] have ever seen happen is when something
[50:28] anointed me I wish I could stay in that
[50:30] place all the time you reading the book
[50:33] that night when the maniac ran out on
[50:34] the platform up there to kill me at at
[50:37] um where Portland you was there brother
[50:40] Jack or was brother Brown was there when
[50:42] that Maniac Run out to kill me and
[50:45] threatened to do it great big huge
[50:48] fellow and instead of hating the man I
[50:51] loved him he wouldn't have done that he
[50:53] was probably a man with a family same as
[50:55] I had and he wouldn't have done that it
[50:57] was the devil on him that was doing that
[51:00] and when I loved him I wasn't afraid of
[51:03] him then love castes out
[51:07] fear it's when you can love you heard
[51:11] the story about the old mother possum
[51:13] coming up to the house
[51:15] love it takes love to conquer the time
[51:20] that bull was going to kill me out there
[51:21] in the field run right up on and it
[51:25] wasn't that I hated him uh was a game
[51:27] warden I reached to get a gun I left it
[51:30] in my car and I was glad I did
[51:31] afterwards he run up and I thought well
[51:33] if I have to die I might as well die
[51:36] facing him I can't run from him there's
[51:37] nothing to get out of the way and just
[51:40] then I thought well if I have to go I
[51:43] want to go looking at him and when it
[51:45] did he ran right to me because he
[51:47] catched me anyhow and he had a chain
[51:50] hanging from his nose just killed a
[51:51] colored man few weeks before that I
[51:53] forgot about him being in that field I
[51:55] was going to pray for a sick man and he
[51:57] threw his knee down like this and hit
[51:59] the dirt and roared and here he comes
[52:02] and I don't know why but something
[52:05] happened always when a healing takes
[52:08] place or anything there's something
[52:10] happen a love comes in that it just
[52:13] takes everything else out of the way oh
[52:17] I tell you brother you can have all the
[52:19] theology you want you but give me love
[52:20] every time ever since by faith I saw
[52:24] that stream thy flowing wounds applied
[52:27] redeeming love has been my theme and
[52:30] shall be till I die love oh if I could
[52:35] only live in that atmosphere all the
[52:38] time and as that struck
[52:41] me I said creature of God I am the
[52:45] servant of God I'm on my way over to
[52:49] pray for one of his sick
[52:51] children now I'm in your territory I'm
[52:54] in your field here
[52:56] I didn't mean to disturb
[52:58] you but in the name of Jesus Christ go
[53:02] back and lay down I'll not bother you
[53:05] and he looked like he was coming on here
[53:08] he come just as hard as he could I just
[53:10] stood still no more afraid than I am
[53:11] right now and when he got about three
[53:13] foot from me he
[53:16] stopped you looked at me he looked so
[53:19] depleted one way and then the other
[53:21] turned around walked over and laid down
[53:25] I passed by with the two feet walk out
[53:28] on by love conquers something
[53:33] [Music]
[53:35] happens something takes place the other
[53:38] I I was telling you about down in Mexico
[53:40] when brother Jack was there there's an
[53:43] old uh Mexican man come up on the
[53:46] platform he was total
[53:48] blind and a poor old fell is their
[53:51] economics are so poorly balanced and
[53:54] they don't have nothing to eat this old
[53:57] fell didn't have on any shoes and an old
[53:59] hat in his hands sewed up with cards and
[54:02] an old ragged looking coat on and
[54:05] trousers almost to his knees and dust
[54:07] all over him he come walking across the
[54:10] platform with a little Rosary in his
[54:12] hand little bunch of beads and he got up
[54:15] to me saying something somebody was
[54:17] leading him I stood looked at him I tell
[54:20] you brother until you can feel another
[54:22] man's condition you can never help him
[54:24] that's right
[54:26] that's that's the reason God so loved
[54:29] the world hallelujah hallelujah you had
[54:32] a feeling for
[54:34] it and I looked at him I thought there
[54:37] he is probably a bunch of little
[54:39] children somewhere working for a few
[54:41] peses a day and now after all this maybe
[54:45] another never had a good meal in his
[54:47] life and you're in that condition now
[54:51] Nature has been so bad to him or his
[54:53] Fate has blinded him
[54:56] and he was I C my foot upside him I
[54:58] thought here I stand with a good suit on
[55:01] and a pair of shoes a good pair of shoes
[55:03] I don't know whether he ever had a pair
[55:04] of shoes on his life I hope that's not
[55:07] right I've got a pair at home I got
[55:10] another suit at home that man's got just
[55:12] as much right to him as I have I put my
[55:15] foot up the side of his S I give him my
[55:17] shoes before he said anything why his
[55:19] foot was much bigger and his his
[55:21] shoulders much wider couldn't give him a
[55:23] coat oh God what can I do for him and my
[55:26] old dad would have lived he'd had been
[55:28] about his age what was it entering in
[55:32] all at once something happened I begin
[55:35] to feel that presence of Love Sympathy
[55:39] for the old
[55:40] man he jerked out little beads and
[55:43] getting all her Hail Mary Mother of God
[55:44] bless I said that's not necessary just
[55:47] put it away and he said to brother
[55:50] espinos where is the Healer I want to
[55:53] get a hold of him and I said just tell
[55:56] him to Bow his head I put my arms around
[55:59] the old fell I start I said Lord Jesus
[56:02] this poor old man I can't get him a
[56:04] shoes he can't wear them I can't give
[56:05] him a coat but Lord God you're the only
[56:08] one can help him now you can give him
[56:10] something that'll fit him that's
[56:11] eyesight that's what he's craving for no
[56:14] more than I said that I heard some glor
[56:16] adios and there he was she as good as I
[56:18] could running across the platform just
[56:20] as hard as he could
[56:23] go and the next night there was a rick
[56:27] of clothes old scares and aprons and old
[56:30] coats and rags and hats piled up on
[56:33] there two or three times as long as this
[56:35] year and about that how how I ever how
[56:37] they ever got the right one I don't know
[56:39] but what they seen something oh when
[56:44] something happens something takes place
[56:47] that's the way it was with Mary that
[56:50] morning something must have took place
[56:53] when she was thinking about him and
[56:55] there he appeared
[56:56] into her presence it was the same thing
[56:59] with Moses like it was with Mary he said
[57:02] you're going to conceive in your womb
[57:05] and bear a child now she know the
[57:09] Angel's message was scriptural yes I
[57:13] don't care what kind of an Angel it was
[57:14] that appeared if that Angel's message is
[57:18] not scriptural and a promise of God let
[57:21] it
[57:22] alone there's been all kinds of angels
[57:25] appearing everything things and they
[57:27] bring all kinds of messages if the angel
[57:29] of the Lord whose servant I am would
[57:31] come if that angel would come don't
[57:33] matter how much it looked like to pillar
[57:35] ify how much it looked like to like if
[57:37] his message didn't bear record with this
[57:39] word I'd let him alone and let him be a
[57:41] curse it has to be in this Joseph Smith
[57:44] you know saw an angel he said but it
[57:46] didn't bear a record with the word and
[57:49] Mary knew that she just read the day
[57:51] before Isaiah 9:6 that something was
[57:53] about to happen GL to Jesus amen and she
[57:57] know it was on its way
[57:59] then Moses likewise when he'd give up
[58:03] all of the hopes with this Theology and
[58:06] was on the backside of the desert herden
[58:08] Jethro sheep and one day he saw a a ball
[58:12] of fire sitting in a bush back there and
[58:15] he come up and Tuck off his shoes as he
[58:17] was bid and he listened to see what it
[58:19] was but when he saw that angel was
[58:23] scriptural said I've heard the cry of my
[58:26] people and I remembered my Covenant he
[58:29] know that God made the promise and it
[58:31] was that was the angel that would go
[58:33] with him I remember my promise and my
[58:36] Covenant I've seen the sufferings of my
[58:39] people and I've come down to deliver him
[58:42] Moses know it wasn't his anymore because
[58:44] of that I have come down to deliver him
[58:47] oh that's a good part I come down you
[58:51] just be a mouthpiece barming so he seen
[58:54] it was absolutely scriptural and Mary
[58:58] saw it was absolutely scriptural for the
[59:01] day before she'd been reading it perhaps
[59:04] in the scroll as our little drama goes I
[59:07] tell you it pays to read God's word
[59:10] Daily Now Jesus said search ye the
[59:13] scriptures for in them you think you
[59:15] have eternal life and they are they
[59:17] which testify
[59:19] me otherwise he said if I do not the
[59:22] works of my father that was supposed to
[59:24] be done when he come then believe me not
[59:26] but if I do the works though you don't
[59:28] believe me believe the works because
[59:31] they're the ones that sent of
[59:33] God we are looking for a Heavenly
[59:36] visitor in this day it's a promise of
[59:39] God put on your deep spiritual thinking
[59:42] quick church and remember we are now
[59:46] looking for a visitor and there's many
[59:49] claiming it but the only way that we'll
[59:52] know this heavenly visitor because he'll
[59:54] bear record of the
[59:59] work she knew that that angel was from
[1:00:03] God when she seen his action looked at
[1:00:06] him it must be an angel he said I'm
[1:00:09] Gabriel standing at the right hand of
[1:00:11] God now when God gets ready to do
[1:00:15] something he sends a
[1:00:16] messenger always always has he always
[1:00:19] will Gabriel announc the first coming of
[1:00:22] Christ Gabriel will announce the second
[1:00:23] coming of Christ that's right something
[1:00:26] major sixing to happen and we notice
[1:00:29] this Angel when he said Hail Mary and
[1:00:31] told her what was going to take place
[1:00:33] she didn't doubt him because she know he
[1:00:35] was perfectly scriptural that it was
[1:00:38] supposed to be that way now we're
[1:00:40] looking for a messenger in this last
[1:00:42] days because Jesus said it would be
[1:00:45] because all the prophets said it would
[1:00:47] be Malachi said it would be all the
[1:00:50] prophets has testified Jesus in the very
[1:00:52] shadow of the Cross spoke more of his
[1:00:55] second coming than he did of his going
[1:00:57] away and when we see these things begin
[1:00:59] to come to pass we better go to search
[1:01:02] in the scripture because he said there'
[1:01:04] be false Christ arise and false prophets
[1:01:07] and would show signs and wonders in so
[1:01:09] much that it would deceive the very
[1:01:10] elected if it was possible Billy Grim
[1:01:14] said in a message here a few weeks ago
[1:01:16] it's already deceived the very elected I
[1:01:19] differ with the Evangelist it cannot
[1:01:21] deceive the very elected because they
[1:01:24] are elected of God
[1:01:27] Jesus spoke that in the days just before
[1:01:30] the coming of the son of man it would be
[1:01:33] as it was in Sodom and if we Tu it
[1:01:37] before last this in this week that there
[1:01:40] was an angel came to Sodom three of them
[1:01:44] for three classes of people one of them
[1:01:47] was the sodomites the other was the
[1:01:49] lukewarm Church the other was the
[1:01:52] elected and called out Church Abraham
[1:01:54] and his group in his group and Sodom in
[1:01:57] their group all two of them went out the
[1:02:00] evangelists went down to preach to Sodom
[1:02:02] and to bring out that group of people of
[1:02:05] Believers down there you just got a few
[1:02:08] of them out but we notice that the one
[1:02:11] that stayed behind to the elected
[1:02:14] church he showed a
[1:02:17] sign and it was God yeah doing that it
[1:02:21] was not a myth it was not a theophany a
[1:02:26] theophany don't eat he eat the Flesh of
[1:02:29] a calf and eat some whole cake corn
[1:02:32] bread and some butter on it and drink
[1:02:34] the milk from the cow a theophany
[1:02:36] doesn't eat and drink it was God that's
[1:02:40] right made manifest in
[1:02:42] flesh it sure was and what was he
[1:02:45] speaking Jesus said as in that day so
[1:02:48] will it be God will come again come into
[1:02:53] the Flesh of his people that he has
[1:02:55] bought and
[1:02:56] Sanctified and will show to his elected
[1:03:00] Church the same sign that he showed to
[1:03:03] his elected church back there there was
[1:03:06] no come out of it there was no this that
[1:03:08] he was already out of it Abraham was but
[1:03:11] the other Angels was calling out calling
[1:03:14] out down there but Abraham was already
[1:03:17] out and the church the very Word Church
[1:03:20] means called out God's church is already
[1:03:23] called out it's called out
[1:03:26] and he gave him a sign that he was the
[1:03:29] one and when he did with his back turned
[1:03:32] he told Sarah was in the tent behind him
[1:03:35] laughing by power the same thing that
[1:03:38] Jesus manifested in his coming
[1:03:41] manifested to both Samaritan and to the
[1:03:43] Jew and it's predicted that in this last
[1:03:46] days that he would send his messenger
[1:03:48] again and that messenger tonight is that
[1:03:51] a
[1:03:52] man no sir it's the Holy Ghost that's
[1:03:55] his messenger god in his
[1:03:59] church moving showing the signs and
[1:04:03] wonders just before his appearing now
[1:04:06] remember this Angel has to be a
[1:04:09] scriptural Angel yes besides that we are
[1:04:12] warned of God about false prophets the
[1:04:16] Bible said if there be a man among you
[1:04:18] who thinks himself to be a prophet or so
[1:04:20] forth and what he says doesn't come to
[1:04:22] pass then don't fear him I'm not with
[1:04:24] him but what he says comes to pass then
[1:04:27] I'm with that Prophet hearing that's
[1:04:30] true so we find out today that that
[1:04:33] message is a true bible message it's
[1:04:37] back to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:39] back to the power of God back to
[1:04:41] Pentecost again restoring the hearts of
[1:04:45] the fathers back to the children or the
[1:04:49] children back to the father's rather in
[1:04:51] this last days we're looking for a
[1:04:53] Heavenly messenger and I believe he's
[1:04:56] here tonight yes
[1:04:59] amen I believe that he's here what does
[1:05:03] he do he Bears record now listen friends
[1:05:05] don't take a substitute don't just shake
[1:05:08] a man's hand and put your name on the
[1:05:09] book that that's that that's as far as
[1:05:12] it goes that's all right I may might
[1:05:14] help you uh get out of the saloon and
[1:05:16] get in a a decent place and try to live
[1:05:19] right that won't do it all except the
[1:05:21] man be born again he cannot even see the
[1:05:24] kingdom of God am
[1:05:26] now C needs to understand there's a lot
[1:05:29] of people that say they're born again
[1:05:30] and can't understand the message of God
[1:05:33] can't see the angel of the Lord their
[1:05:36] eyes are blinded brother except the man
[1:05:39] be born of the Holy Ghost the same holy
[1:05:41] ghost that wrote the word will confirm
[1:05:43] the word and the same confirmation of
[1:05:45] the Holy Ghost in
[1:05:46] [Applause]
[1:05:47] you you see what I mean it will bear
[1:05:51] record of
[1:05:54] itself and our Spirit Bears record with
[1:05:57] his spirit because his Spirit Bears
[1:06:00] record of his word the word of God is
[1:06:03] sharper more powerful Hebrews 4 than any
[1:06:07] two- a sword even piercon to the thunder
[1:06:09] in the M of the bone and a discerner of
[1:06:13] the thoughts and the intents of the
[1:06:17] heart that's thus sayith the Lord the
[1:06:20] Lord's word just exactly Jesus Christ
[1:06:23] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:06:25] appearing in his elected Church oh we
[1:06:29] got great Revival sweeping the lands
[1:06:31] everywhere calling out of Sodom and so
[1:06:34] forth but in the elected church we have
[1:06:37] that person God the same God that was
[1:06:40] back on her there's only one of them and
[1:06:43] that one was in his church manifesting
[1:06:45] himself to be the resurrected Lord Jesus
[1:06:48] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:06:51] forever scriptural if he wasn't with the
[1:06:54] scripture didn't bear record of the
[1:06:56] scripture didn't confirm his word then I
[1:06:58] would not believe him but being that he
[1:07:01] does that I know he's from God just like
[1:07:03] Mary did hallelujah
[1:07:06] amen oh like Moses did or any the rest
[1:07:10] of them if it wasn't scriptural now back
[1:07:13] in the Old Testament they had more than
[1:07:15] one way to find out if a man dreamed a
[1:07:18] dream or a prophet prophesied you know
[1:07:20] what they did with that they took him
[1:07:22] down before the Yum Thunder that hung on
[1:07:25] the PO H the UR Thunder is believed to
[1:07:27] have been those 12 burst stones and
[1:07:30] Aaron's birth uh his breastplate
[1:07:33] carrying the birthstone of each one then
[1:07:36] he hung it on the post if the prophet
[1:07:38] stood up and prophesied and no matter
[1:07:41] how really it sound if the supernatural
[1:07:44] didn't answer back a conglomeration of
[1:07:46] rainbow lights around in these
[1:07:48] glittering like that no matter what the
[1:07:50] prophet said he was
[1:07:52] wrong no matter what the dreamer dreamed
[1:07:55] it was wrong but God always answers back
[1:07:58] in a supernatural
[1:08:01] way now and that priesthood ended and
[1:08:04] the yundum was taken down but God's got
[1:08:07] another yundum this is it God's word is
[1:08:12] a urath thund that's God's word let
[1:08:15] every man's word be a lie and mine be
[1:08:17] true said God heavens and earth will
[1:08:20] pass away said Jesus but my word shall
[1:08:23] never pass away
[1:08:26] now then if one speaks and it's not
[1:08:30] scriptural don't believe it if he speaks
[1:08:32] and it is scriptural wait a minute try
[1:08:35] it with the UR mundam then if the
[1:08:37] supernatural answers back that it is the
[1:08:39] truth then believe it that's the way to
[1:08:41] believe a true message if the bible
[1:08:43] promises anything and the Bible says
[1:08:46] it's so that's God's year with thund if
[1:08:48] the preacher preach is preaching like
[1:08:50] the Bible said that's God's messenger
[1:08:53] God's witness that if it is the then the
[1:08:55] supernatural of that word will be made
[1:08:58] manifest and prove itself to be God God
[1:09:01] keeps his
[1:09:03] promise we're looking for a
[1:09:06] messenger that messenger is the Holy
[1:09:09] Spirit the Bible said a little while the
[1:09:11] world won't see me no more Jesus did yet
[1:09:13] ye shall see me for I'll be with you to
[1:09:16] the end of the world the works that I do
[1:09:20] shall you do also More Than This shall
[1:09:23] you do for I go unto my father now the
[1:09:26] word there more in the right translation
[1:09:28] I've used it there and more because it
[1:09:30] said the King James greater who could do
[1:09:32] any greater he raised the dead stopped
[1:09:34] nature done everything but then he was
[1:09:37] in one person all of God was bottled up
[1:09:40] into one man Jesus Christ but in this
[1:09:43] time he's Across the Universe in his
[1:09:46] church more of it the same work same
[1:09:50] works that I do shall they do also More
[1:09:54] Than This shall I do because I returned
[1:09:56] back to the pillar of fire that I was
[1:09:59] before I Was Made question
[1:10:01] the Myself by the same work and the same
[1:10:05] manifestations I
[1:10:08] did that is exactly right Jesus said
[1:10:12] when he was here on Earth I come from
[1:10:14] God and I return to
[1:10:17] God is that right that's right all right
[1:10:20] if he was God he would would spoke to
[1:10:22] there one day and they talked him about
[1:10:25] about being 50 years old yet and saw
[1:10:27] Abraham he said before Abraham was I am
[1:10:30] I am was that Pillar of Fire that was in
[1:10:32] the bush with Moses that was a
[1:10:34] scriptural Pillar of Fire that same is
[1:10:37] the I am not I was or will be I am
[1:10:40] always
[1:10:42] just
[1:10:43] [Music]
[1:10:45] forever we see when I am was made
[1:10:48] presence Among Us in a body of his own
[1:10:51] son that he created own body cross his
[1:10:54] cast from God to become a human in order
[1:10:57] to bring us back to Salvation and back
[1:10:59] to the Garden of Eden again crossed
[1:11:02] itself spread his tents Among Us and eat
[1:11:04] like us and slept like us and walk like
[1:11:06] us and look like us he become us that we
[1:11:09] through him might become him going into
[1:11:12] the kingdom then when we find that
[1:11:15] Pillar of Fire when it was with him it
[1:11:18] performs signs and wonders and he
[1:11:20] confessed it's not me that doeth the
[1:11:21] works it's my father that dwelleth in me
[1:11:24] he doeth the works for barely verely I
[1:11:26] say unto you the son can do nothing in
[1:11:27] himself until he sees the father do it
[1:11:29] also and the son does what the father
[1:11:32] shows and he worketh and I worketh
[1:11:33] hether to
[1:11:35] amen rightall he died rose again on the
[1:11:39] third day and a few days after that
[1:11:42] there was a little critical hook noosed
[1:11:44] Jew with a bunch of stuff in his pocket
[1:11:46] going down to persecute the church all
[1:11:48] them that was in this way yeah went out
[1:11:51] to on his road to Damascus and he was
[1:11:54] stricken down and when he looked up he
[1:11:56] saw a great Pillar of Fire hanging there
[1:12:00] saying Saul Saul why persecutest thou me
[1:12:03] he said who are you Lord who is this
[1:12:05] Pillar of Fire I come from God I go to
[1:12:08] God he said I'm Jesus that's hard
[1:12:13] [Music]
[1:12:16] you the prophet said there' be a for
[1:12:18] Marine in a lattering then the lattering
[1:12:21] would be both former and lattering
[1:12:22] together a great church Universal have
[1:12:25] sweep from one side of the world to the
[1:12:27] other side of the world a great message
[1:12:29] great signs and wonders would have be
[1:12:31] accomplished by this church Daniel said
[1:12:33] the people that know their God in that
[1:12:34] day shall do exploits exactly where
[1:12:37] we're living at in this day now the
[1:12:40] mechanical eye of the camera shows over
[1:12:42] us that that Pillar of Fire is the same
[1:12:46] Pillar of Fire that led the children of
[1:12:48] Israel now it's got to do the same
[1:12:51] things that did when it was in him art
[1:12:53] is not the same Pillar of Fire amen but
[1:12:56] if it does the same thing how can you
[1:12:59] doubt it in
[1:13:00] scripture Hail Mary blessed art thou
[1:13:04] amongst women thou found favor with god
[1:13:07] oh Church hail blessed art you among the
[1:13:10] people because you found favor with God
[1:13:12] you believe for eternal life and God's
[1:13:14] give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:17] right this Messenger will be true
[1:13:20] Messenger of God the Holy Spirit which
[1:13:23] is God's message
[1:13:26] notice Mary as soon as she seen it was
[1:13:29] scriptural she didn't say I'll go over
[1:13:31] and see whether Dr Jones says it's right
[1:13:33] or not she didn't go by to see if Rabbi
[1:13:36] kabiny thought it was right or not she
[1:13:39] never had nothing to do with it you know
[1:13:41] what she said she said behold the hands
[1:13:43] made of the
[1:13:45] Lord be unto me according to your
[1:13:49] word or she know that word was God's
[1:13:52] word that messenger was God's messenger
[1:13:55] was God's angel because he stayed with
[1:13:57] God's
[1:13:59] word behold the hands made of the Lord
[1:14:03] hallelujah said how will it be he said
[1:14:05] the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you and
[1:14:08] this holy thing that'll be born to you
[1:14:09] shall be called The Son of God she said
[1:14:11] here I am I don't know how it's going to
[1:14:14] happen it don't make any difference you
[1:14:15] said so it's scriptural I believe it I
[1:14:17] accept it she started right out praising
[1:14:20] God before she felt life before she felt
[1:14:23] any sign of anything she didn't want no
[1:14:26] more signs she had his word and that was
[1:14:28] always
[1:14:31] necessary I like
[1:14:34] that Moses as soon as he got a hold of
[1:14:36] God and seen it was scripture here he
[1:14:38] went to Egypt he did as soon as Mary got
[1:14:41] a hold of an Angel got a hold of her
[1:14:43] brother and she seen him and know it was
[1:14:45] God because it was scriptural she took
[1:14:48] his word and went around
[1:14:50] testifying of something that didn't even
[1:14:52] show one evidence of ever being another
[1:14:54] thing she testified of something that
[1:14:56] never had happened
[1:15:00] before Oh Praise be the Lord she
[1:15:04] testified of something that never
[1:15:06] happened never had a virgin
[1:15:09] conceived but she had the Angel's word
[1:15:11] and the angel was scriptural yes so she
[1:15:14] know it was promised and the angel had
[1:15:16] the word of the Lord and promised it and
[1:15:18] because she thought herself humbly and
[1:15:20] lowly yet God had chose her so she's
[1:15:22] just happy about it and she went forth
[1:15:24] with her message telling everybody she's
[1:15:26] going to have a baby before she even had
[1:15:28] the first sign of a baby she didn't wait
[1:15:31] and say now wait let me feel and see if
[1:15:32] I feel any better or not no
[1:15:34] no oh God give us more
[1:15:38] marries B on and the rest of the world
[1:15:41] needs marries like that that can take
[1:15:44] God at his word and start rejoicing

[1:17:14] stranger and you want Know What's mar at
[1:17:15] them people that's what it
[1:17:17] is Joy promised it on the day of
[1:17:21] Pentecost Peter said this is that I want
[1:17:24] to add something to that if this isn't
[1:17:26] that I want to keep this to that comes
[1:17:28] because I'm having awful good time with
[1:17:31] this now I believe this is
[1:17:34] that the same that that was that to that
[1:17:37] day oh Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:17:41] today and
[1:17:42] forever Mary didn't wait she didn't care
[1:17:45] about critics she didn't care what
[1:17:46] anybody said she met an angel she seen
[1:17:49] his voice or seen his presence and she
[1:17:51] snowed he told her the truth because it
[1:17:53] was scriptural promis of a blessing to
[1:17:55] her just s and believe it and she know
[1:17:57] it was going to happen that's right oh
[1:17:59] she you something about when you hit
[1:18:00] something like that you can't keep still
[1:18:02] about
[1:18:03] it the angel told her that her cousin
[1:18:07] Elizabeth was uh up in the hilly country
[1:18:11] of Judea was old about 70 years old and
[1:18:14] she had conceived and was going to have
[1:18:17] a son it was already 6 months with her
[1:18:19] as a mother course a little baby little
[1:18:21] John hadn't had no life yet they kind he
[1:18:24] worried about
[1:18:25] so we find out that Elizabeth Zachariah
[1:18:28] was her husband which was a a priest
[1:18:31] yeah he was at the temple long about 6
[1:18:34] months before this happened you know God
[1:18:36] gets getting things together amongst the
[1:18:37] humble people look at Zacharias now the
[1:18:41] angel Gabriel came to him he was in the
[1:18:44] temple ministering and when he did it
[1:18:46] burning incense was his lot standing at
[1:18:49] the altar and he happened to look at the
[1:18:50] right hand side the right hand side of
[1:18:52] the altar I guess you always wonder why
[1:18:54] I bring the people this way where he
[1:18:56] stands so at the right hand side of the
[1:18:58] Altar and there stood an angel and told
[1:19:01] him that at the days of his ministration
[1:19:03] there he was going home and be with his
[1:19:06] wife and she'd conceive and bear a son a
[1:19:10] child and that preacher doubted that
[1:19:13] word why he had many times if he was
[1:19:17] going to be the father of the child look
[1:19:19] at Sarah he had some examples in the
[1:19:21] Bible look at Hannah at the temple many
[1:19:26] examples like that and still he doubted
[1:19:28] how much difference it was from that
[1:19:31] callous uh teacher of
[1:19:34] philosophy how much difference there was
[1:19:36] in that Seminary Minister than there was
[1:19:39] in that little
[1:19:41] virgin she never questioned she said
[1:19:43] behold the hands of me of the Lord
[1:19:45] that's all she took him at his word and
[1:19:47] that's settled it amen but this man
[1:19:49] couldn't believe it he said I'm Gabriel
[1:19:52] that stands in the presence of God my
[1:19:54] word shall be
[1:19:58] fulfilled you know what he was talking
[1:20:00] about he said because you've doubted me
[1:20:03] you'll be dumb until the day the baby's
[1:20:07] born went home his wife conceived and
[1:20:10] hid herself 6 months Mary thought oh
[1:20:14] isn't that wonderful now I'm going to
[1:20:15] have a baby and there Elizabeth my
[1:20:18] cousin Jesus and John were second
[1:20:21] cousins there I tell you it's going to
[1:20:23] be wonderful because that she's going to
[1:20:25] have a baby and I'm going to have a baby
[1:20:27] I just can't hold it any longer I'm
[1:20:29] going right up to tell her right up to
[1:20:31] the mountain she went hard as she go I
[1:20:33] you see her pretty little face shining
[1:20:35] she's just about 18 years old imagine
[1:20:37] her black hair blowing back like that
[1:20:39] and she's on her Road this little robe
[1:20:41] wrapped around her and you know
[1:20:42] Elizabeth had hid
[1:20:44] herself I kind of like that I think it
[1:20:47] looks so disgraceful to see women out
[1:20:49] like there these shs on and things when
[1:20:51] they're to be mothers it looks pitiful
[1:20:54] what a
[1:20:55] difference that's horrible I know what
[1:20:57] you ought ought maybe not ought to say
[1:20:59] if I offend you you forgive me but You'
[1:21:01] listen to your doctor I'm your brother
[1:21:04] see so there the woman in that condition
[1:21:07] but she hid herself I can imagine her
[1:21:09] sitting back there you know kind of
[1:21:11] snubbing a little with the knitting some
[1:21:13] little what little booties you know
[1:21:15] getting them all ready like that and
[1:21:16] knitting a little blanket but she was
[1:21:18] feared because she said now I'm old and
[1:21:21] notice the angel of the Lord they were
[1:21:23] righteous Bible said her in Zechariah
[1:21:26] they were righteous keeping all the
[1:21:28] Commandments of God that's Where Angels
[1:21:30] appear always appears in a righteous
[1:21:33] family somewhere where God can use
[1:21:36] something something to work with and
[1:21:39] then she's making these little booties
[1:21:42] and I imagine it's a little window like
[1:21:43] it is in Palestine some sometimes not no
[1:21:45] window to light in it but just a little
[1:21:47] shade hanging down and she heard
[1:21:49] something she raised up and she looked
[1:21:51] coming up and she said you know I
[1:21:53] believe that looks like my cousin
[1:21:57] Mary look at her little face shine while
[1:22:00] she's grown up I hear she's going to get
[1:22:02] married so it must have been that uh
[1:22:06] well she's a young woman but that's
[1:22:07] married so she slipped her little robe
[1:22:09] on you know and runs out the meter and
[1:22:12] women in them days are not like they are
[1:22:14] now you know they I they run and throw
[1:22:17] their arms around one and hug one
[1:22:18] another you know I like friendliness
[1:22:20] don't
[1:22:22] you I I just hate to see this little old
[1:22:24] silly stuff in this
[1:22:26] 1960 version of
[1:22:28] friendliness oh my there's not enough of
[1:22:31] it now you Southerners down here don't
[1:22:33] notice the bad but up there oh my I went
[1:22:37] to my uncle here not long ago in New
[1:22:38] York he'd been living in one house 20
[1:22:40] years and his neighbor Coes that Texas
[1:22:42] flag there to him I said who lives there
[1:22:44] I said I don't know I said you've fallen
[1:22:47] from
[1:22:48] Grace I said well said I said how long's
[1:22:51] you live there I said he's there when I
[1:22:52] come here
[1:22:54] you don't know your neighbor's dead till
[1:22:55] you read it the paper that's right no
[1:22:57] friendliness here not long ago brother
[1:23:00] Moore and I and brother Brown went down
[1:23:02] to see a little boy named David a few
[1:23:04] years ago down here in Cal or Florida
[1:23:07] they had us out there and and brother
