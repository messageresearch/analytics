[9:17] God bless you this
[9:19] evening I I'm really happy to be in the
[9:23] house of the
[9:25] Lord it has been a very rough month
[9:30] but God has still with
[9:33] us I'm very thankful to all of
[9:37] you to the pastor to the
[9:40] ministry to the
[9:42] man that have uh prayed for me for the
[9:45] last couple of
[9:47] weeks it's been a very very
[9:51] rough even today was very
[9:55] rough when the pastor called me and I
[9:58] was battling with my
[10:00] myself he said he said are you ready to
[10:02] hit
[10:04] it I was like
[10:06] Gideon I was like
[10:10] Gideon are you calling me a brave
[10:13] man I'm right there in the
[10:16] corner Satan is taking away from me
[10:19] everything and you're telling me to go
[10:20] up there and
[10:22] fight I feel like
[10:25] that thank you Pastor confidence am
[10:29] amen he has blown me so
[10:33] hard that I have to blow him back
[10:38] again sometimes we
[10:40] forget what really Christian is to
[10:43] be and we see it that Christian is to be
[10:47] nice and
[10:53] dandy this this
[10:55] month God really has taught me how to be
[10:58] a Christian
[11:00] and let's read the scripture so I can
[11:01] tell you
[11:02] why Philippians chapter
[11:07] 3 verse 10 yes I think this is the one
[11:11] of the the the scriptures that our
[11:13] pastors likees to read read the
[11:18] most I guess he he repeats it because he
[11:21] wants us to get a hold of
[11:24] it and he says like
[11:27] this that I may know him
[11:30] in the power of his
[11:34] resurrection and everybody's going like
[11:36] w yes
[11:39] Glory okay let's keep
[11:42] reading and the fellowship of his
[11:51] sufferings being make conformable unto
[11:55] his death
[12:01] he's not just talking about the
[12:03] resurrection he's speaking about the
[12:08] until until we get a
[12:11] reward okay you can you may be SE
[12:16] it the reason I read
[12:19] this because Christian is it means
[12:25] Christlike and Christlike we always see
[12:27] it you know uh racing up the
[12:32] death praying for the sick seeing
[12:35] Miracles and
[12:37] wonders but we don't see the other side
[12:39] of the
[12:41] coin we don't see when he was
[12:44] weak when he was
[12:46] hungry when when everybody turned their
[12:49] back on
[12:50] him oh we don't want to see that
[12:53] picture we always see that picture that
[12:55] he's always
[12:57] smiling but see when he was at the
[13:01] cross he was
[13:03] suffering he's father where are
[13:06] you I need you right
[13:09] now that's right I'm suffering right
[13:12] now we don't want to go through that
[13:16] stage we don't want to get
[13:18] sick I don't want to get
[13:21] sick but I have
[13:24] to how are you going to know the power
[13:26] of his resurrection
[13:30] if you're not
[13:32] dead that's right and we get all happy
[13:35] and we
[13:36] sing his resurrection power is moving in
[13:39] this
[13:42] hour but how are we going to know if
[13:44] we're not dying to
[13:47] ourselves the only ones who can know
[13:50] that is the ones that are coming through
[13:52] those
[13:53] doors looking for a a last piece of Hope
[14:01] [Applause]
[14:02] am he
[14:04] said I am the of the
[14:08] valley the of the valley has a special
[14:14] characteristics he suffers when he comes
[14:16] out and he suffers when he's
[14:20] gone what do you mean
[14:23] brother it struggles to come
[14:26] out through all this filthy mud
[14:31] I struggle with
[14:34] myself to let the Holy Spirit come out
[14:37] through this filthy
[14:40] M and then that's not
[14:43] it and everybody says he it looks
[14:46] pretty that's not the best of it
[14:50] yet the best of it
[14:52] comes when it has to be
[14:57] smashed let me tell you
[15:01] brother every piece of juice got got on
[15:03] me this
[15:08] month I had no
[15:11] strength and I thought I thought it was
[15:13] like
[15:14] woo God gave me a
[15:16] car God gave me a
[15:20] carom oh nice it feels
[15:22] good oh I'm a
[15:25] Christian I have a
[15:27] house I'm a Christian
[15:30] and that's the power of the
[15:32] Resurrection but the price that comes
[15:34] with
[15:36] it nobody wants to go through
[15:40] it when you're there on the
[15:44] dumps we brother brother David thank you
[15:46] for that

[15:53] really God's going to say really you
[15:55] want to raise your
[15:57] hands let me see

[16:12] doctor nobody was able to find
[16:15] anything and yet I was still fighting
[16:17] trying to believe that I had
[16:20] something and this last
[16:23] Sunday I came up woo let's pray for the
[16:27] sick and the surpr surpris one was
[16:31] me all of a sudden one of the ministers
[16:33] comes and tells me everything's
[16:36] fine he didn't know about it he didn't
[16:39] know what was going through and I was
[16:42] hoping to hear
[16:44] something says Satan cannot hurt Satan
[16:47] cannot hurt
[16:49] you oh you're talking about worshiping
[16:52] God in the worst
[16:57] moments we don't know how to
[17:00] here's the Lord Jesus
[17:04] Christ he's praying for the
[17:07] sick bringing
[17:09] Miracles raising up the
[17:11] dead and everybody's like
[17:14] wow I want to be like him I want to
[17:17] bring
[17:19] that yet he comes and
[17:24] says the fellowship of his sufferings
[17:29] but nobody wants to
[17:30] suffer every everybody wants to get
[17:33] everything nice and
[17:34] dandy you want to get your
[17:37] healing you come to the
[17:39] altar you think it's going to be easy
[17:41] when you leave the
[17:44] doors no God wants to say okay you
[17:46] really got a hold of the power of
[17:51] Resurrection let me Smash you a little
[17:53] bit and then now now we can say
[17:59] I want to raise up my hands
[18:01] lord lord I can't no
[18:05] more I want to be that Temple of worship
[18:08] you don't you don't worship when
[18:10] everything's at his
[18:12] best you worship when you're at your
[18:16] worse when you're in your
[18:19] pain when you're
[18:21] suffering then it really comes a worship
[18:24] from your
[18:25] [Music]
[18:26] heart here's a woman at the here's the
[18:29] woman with the blood
[18:32] issue she was she was
[18:35] dying she didn't know what the power of
[18:37] the Resurrection
[18:39] was but she was worshiping in her
[18:42] heart because she
[18:45] said I
[18:46] know if I just touch him right
[18:50] now I know
[18:52] Lord that you're going to heal me
[18:59] when you're
[19:00] dying when the doctor tells you you're
[19:03] goingon to
[19:05] die I didn't
[19:08] worship I was crying
[19:12] out that the crying out was coming at
[19:15] his
[19:21] best why because I have a
[19:25] car no no I don't worship like a but God
[19:29] cannot accept my worship like
[19:30] that because everything's nice and
[19:33] D but if I want to be
[19:37] Christlike then I have to
[19:40] suffer then I understand brother Caleb
[19:42] what me told
[19:44] you you want to be where I'm
[19:47] at you have to walk the same path that I
[19:51] walked you want to be a
[19:54] Christian you have to walk the same
[19:56] steps he walked
[19:59] sometimes you have to be the lamb for
[20:01] your
[20:03] family the lamp of
[20:07] sacrifice cuz you have to sometimes
[20:13] intercede I didn't know what I was going
[20:15] through
[20:17] this but now I understand that God had
[20:21] to allow
[20:23] this because maybe it was going to hit
[20:25] one of my kids
[20:28] was going to hit my wife which though
[20:30] she's hurt because because of of what
[20:32] I've been going
[20:38] through but I have to be a
[20:41] lamb nobody wants to be a
[20:43] lamb everybody wants to eat of the
[20:48] Lamb everybody everybody in the time of
[20:52] Moses everybody ate the
[20:55] lamb but po poor lamb
[20:59] he's the one who had to pay the
[21:01] price nobody wants to pay a
[21:05] price I I I I I I remember
[21:08] this here comes TL
[21:11] Osborne Osborne and he says I'm a
[21:14] Pentecostal have you heard of TL
[21:17] Osborne well he in his campaign he
[21:20] brought up a lot of Miracles
[21:21] [Music]
[21:23] too he didn't go what Brad Brandon went
[21:27] through but he says I was always used
[21:30] to you
[21:32] demon you get out of this woman right
[21:36] now and here comes a man from
[21:39] Kentucky that have paid he has gone
[21:41] through the sufferings of the Lord Jesus
[21:45] Christ Spirit of
[21:50] blindness leave this child
[21:53] now there was not a lot of
[21:55] emotion do the power of Resurrection
[21:57] brings emotion
[22:00] yes it
[22:02] does but now what what is what what does
[22:06] the power of Resurrection cause to the
[22:07] to the person that is
[22:12] dying have you been in un condition have
[22:15] you been in that
[22:17] condition have you been suffering
[22:20] lately

[22:29] when you can see the
[22:31] reward oh it's
[22:35] hurting oh but when it comes the
[22:38] smell out of that
[22:41] Lily comes the most expensive perfume on
[22:46] Earth even though comes through the
[22:49] mud have you ever been in the
[22:52] mud have you ever been in the mud have
[22:55] you struggled to come out of the mud

[25:11] offerings I don't even think that's even
[25:16] 10% you have to

[25:20] Christian is to
[25:22] suffer you you born you suffer and you

[27:34] Christian how come you're
[27:37] sick if you're a
[27:40] minister how come you're

[27:54] the price the
[27:56] most the pastor
[27:59] you see him behind the pulpit you don't
[28:01] even know what price you have to go
[28:04] through you see the
[28:06] Elder how many tears has it cost
[28:10] them to bring the Holy Spirit into our
[28:15] hands and to bring it so easy to
[28:20] us you want to know the scripture that
[28:24] says he's moved by the feeling of our
[28:27] infirmities
[28:31] oh he moves because when I'm
[28:34] sick the only way let me tell you the
[28:38] only way he can move in our
[28:41] midst by the feeling of our
[28:44] infirmities is when you feel the same
[28:46] pain as your
[28:49] brother God is a spirit let me tell
[28:53] you he cannot
[28:55] touch brother Bon says

[33:39] for
[33:42] us all the blood that he has shed in his
[33:46] life for
[33:49] us Pastor you can't do
[33:52] that he said I need you
[33:55] amen and and and we come i' I've I've
[33:59] had a message boiling within me for a
[34:02] while
[34:03] now you know and I went back and I began
[34:07] to ponder on Paul's
[34:12] life you know and and I find a
[34:15] man that was so caught up in
[34:20] himself so caught up in what he had
[34:25] accomplished they had made him Pharisee
[34:28] of
[34:30] Pharisees everybody thought that Paul
[34:33] was the master of
[34:36] theology he was brought and taught
[34:41] BYO one of the best that there was at
[34:44] that
[34:45] time and Paul was
[34:49] chosen they thought so highly of
[34:52] Paul they said you are such a great
[34:55] Pharisee
[34:58] that we want you to persecute the
[35:01] Christian and Paul was so
[35:05] stuck in that
[35:08] position that he forgot the very thing
[35:10] that God had called him
[35:15] for he had studied so much of a Christ
[35:18] that was to
[35:21] come but because he was so caught
[35:26] up Christ had come
[35:29] and he didn't even recognize
[35:33] it that's where we find ourselves
[35:36] today but you know what sometimes we get
[35:39] so stuck in
[35:42] ourselves of what we've
[35:46] accomplished I'm a minister I'm a deacon
[35:50] I'm this one I'm that one but we forget
[35:54] what he's doing right now
[35:57] that God has to come into the scene
[36:01] Church he's got to get our
[36:04] attention he's got to shake us as say
[36:07] look what's
[36:09] happening the coming of the Lord is
[36:13] thee but we are just trying to live in
[36:15] our regular
[36:17] lives there's no urgency in our
[36:21] lives the word that our Prophet brought
[36:26] us is the
[36:28] Church the coming is
[36:31] ahead it is right
[36:33] here but we're so caught up in
[36:37] ourselves we cannot see what's
[36:40] happening think about it every
[36:45] prophecy is coming to pass we look at it
[36:50] oh that's all news
[36:53] already no
[36:56] urgency no urgy
[36:59] you know that's where Paul found
[37:04] himself in a
[37:07] life that he thought he knew what was
[37:10] the
[37:12] truth and Christ had
[37:15] come and he did with him what he
[37:21] wanted but you know
[37:23] what thank be to
[37:26] God that he doesn't look at our
[37:29] faults but he looks at his
[37:32] plan you know as Paul
[37:35] talks he says
[37:38] yet when I was yet his
[37:42] enemy he loved
[37:47] me and I wanted to hit your heart
[37:51] tonight when I was yet his
[37:55] enemy he loved me
[38:00] you know and many times we we want to
[38:03] say that's that's where Christ found
[38:08] me but how many did that happen today in
[38:11] your lives
[38:14] Church how many were you his enemy
[38:18] today how many were you his
[38:22] enemy that he looked past
[38:25] that he looked past our
[38:28] fault but he said you know what I'm
[38:31] going to place you in a
[38:33] place that you can stand behind this
[38:39] ministry CU he loved us so
[38:42] much that's why it's got our walk with
[38:45] him church has got to be
[38:48] personal every single day if not we're
[38:52] going to find ourselves like Paul
[38:55] was don't worried about what he had
[38:59] studied not realizing that he had missed
[39:02] the
[39:04] mark but do you know what God
[39:06] did he took a man because remember what
[39:10] our what our pastor had
[39:13] brought Sunday he said
[39:16] until but you know
[39:18] what Paul one day looked right into the
[39:22] face of
[39:24] God and found out
[39:27] he had no one
[39:31] till how many have looked at God in his
[39:35] eyes and S there's no until for
[39:41] me the road I'm on right now there's
[39:43] there's not an
[39:46] until how how many have seen seen the
[39:49] eyes of
[39:52] death and you just want to give up on
[39:55] everything
[39:58] enemy comes against
[40:00] you you give
[40:02] up your head goes in the
[40:05] gutter
[40:07] and and there's no one until for
[40:11] you but you know what I remember what
[40:13] our pastor had
[40:15] said he said your
[40:18] name is tied to
[40:20] something your name may be tied to
[40:22] someone
[40:24] else and that's where Paul found himself
[40:28] you know because one of the greatest
[40:30] messages that was preached in the
[40:33] Bible was the message of
[40:37] St okay and I want to just tell you real
[40:39] quick about
[40:40] it you know the
[40:44] Pharisees they found themselves and they
[40:46] got
[40:48] upset because they were so focused on
[40:51] the
[40:54] apostles that they had this crazy deacon
[40:59] and I want you deacons to pay attention
[41:02] here they had this crazy
[41:06] Deacon that he was
[41:08] going he was Healing The
[41:11] Sick he was saving the
[41:14] Lost he was preaching a
[41:18] gospel that was
[41:20] alive you know he was doing the works
[41:23] that he was called to
[41:26] do he wasn't trying to get a higher
[41:30] office he said this is what I am this is
[41:34] what God called me to do and he was
[41:37] doing such a great and mighty
[41:39] work that those
[41:42] Pharisees they said you go get that
[41:45] Steven and you bring him before the
[41:48] council we got to have a talk with
[41:53] that so you see what was happening in
[41:57] those those
[41:59] days is every
[42:01] Apostle all these great
[42:04] men they were running
[42:07] scared of Paul because Paul was going
[42:11] persecuting the
[42:13] Christians they were hiding from the
[42:16] law they did not want to get
[42:19] caught so they find
[42:21] Steven they bring him before every
[42:25] Pharisee amongst great
[42:28] Council and here's
[42:31] St they said
[42:33] so what do you have to say about
[42:37] this and here stepen Steven now here
[42:41] comes the Deacon coming out of
[42:44] Ste all
[42:46] right you guys want to
[42:49] know here you go he preached such a
[42:53] mighty
[42:54] message that impacted Paul so
[42:58] much that that's when Paul looked he
[43:01] looked into the eyes of
[43:03] God and he saw where he had
[43:07] failed thought there was no ideal for
[43:11] him there's no hope for me everything
[43:15] that I
[43:16] know it's wrong everything that I can
[43:20] see there is no God in my
[43:23] life because what did Paul have to do
[43:27] he had to clean that
[43:29] table because it was full of vom there
[43:33] was sin on his table there was unbelief
[43:36] on this there was no hope for
[43:42] him but you know what Steven was a wise
[43:49] man he did not just preach them any
[43:53] message but he showed them where they
[43:57] went
[43:58] wrong and most of
[44:01] all he showed them the way
[44:07] back because in that message what he
[44:11] accomplished he says you uncircumcised
[44:16] Philistines stiff
[44:18] necks here comes a
[44:21] correction but he said you know what let
[44:24] me take you back and let let me show you
[44:27] where you guys missed
[44:29] it he took them if if you read Acts
[44:33] chapter 6 and
[44:37] 7 you you you can see his whole
[44:40] message but in there he takes them all
[44:42] the way back to
[44:44] Abraham to Moses and then he goes all he
[44:49] he shows how
[44:50] Joseph was the type of Christ and how he
[44:54] came and where there was a pharaoh who
[44:57] knew not
[45:00] Joseph but he said but you are still L
[45:02] that
[45:03] seed he showed them the way back he say
[45:07] Moses he says they all died in the
[45:10] wilderness he says but what have you
[45:12] done with them you did the same things
[45:15] as your
[45:16] fathers they thought he was talking
[45:18] about Moses but he took him back to
[45:22] Moses and told them how Moses look to
[45:25] Christ
[45:27] that's when when Paul
[45:29] realized I missed
[45:32] it he was in such
[45:36] confusion and they were so upset with
[45:40] him that they stoned him and they killed
[45:43] him by the order of
[45:47] Paul but you know what confused the heck
[45:49] out of
[45:51] me is that they looked at
[45:53] Steven and the Bible in chapter six the
[45:56] last last verse of the
[45:59] chapter they saw him as an
[46:05] angel remember every SC every scripture
[46:08] has a compound
[46:10] meaning the prophet of God says he says
[46:14] they looked at him as an
[46:16] angel he says because they found no
[46:19] fault in his
[46:22] teaching everything that he brought
[46:25] messed up to what they knew was the
[46:30] sces they knew every scripture by
[46:33] heart they found no fault in
[46:37] that but you know what but Paul didn't
[46:41] just see
[46:42] that Paul saw a natural Angel standing
[46:45] in the
[46:46] m and then what did he say I see
[46:51] Jesus standing on the right God now Paul
[46:55] was really Shook Up
[46:57] Paul Paul ordered his
[47:00] death but then Paul leaves the
[47:03] scene and he says bring me his
[47:06] garments bring me bring me his
[47:11] garments he was confused he didn't know
[47:15] what
[47:16] happened but within him he began to cry
[47:20] un the
[47:21] Lord he said give me these garments give
[47:24] me his garments
[47:28] he kept him with
[47:30] him and he began to
[47:32] ponder how did I go
[47:35] wrong Lord Lord I need
[47:39] you
[47:41] Lord how did I miss it
[47:44] Lord Lord he saw you standing he saw
[47:48] this man
[47:50] Jesus standing at the right hand of
[47:53] God lord I don't understand
[47:57] Lord but I saw something in that
[47:59] man Lord what did I do Lord is there no
[48:04] hope for me Lord the very promise that
[48:07] Abraham that Moses had
[48:10] promised that you would send that
[48:12] anointed
[48:13] one Lord did I just destroy the every
[48:17] the very
[48:22] evidence did I destroy it
[48:25] Lord will there no Resurrection
[48:28] Lord did I just murder you
[48:32] Lord did I did I kill the
[48:37] hope for the pardon of my
[48:39] sins Lord did I kill
[48:42] it is our Humanity
[48:47] ruined is there any hope
[48:49] Lord Lord what's going
[48:52] on
[48:54] Paul we have another order for you
[48:58] you need to go to
[49:00] Damascus and you need to persecute
[49:04] those I could just imagine
[49:07] Pauling that
[49:10] order Lord see Paul knew every
[49:14] scripture and in the scripture what Paul
[49:18] found he was the
[49:20] first Mar of
[49:23] Christians he saw that he saw S as a
[49:29] murderer he said I've killed the man
[49:31] almighty
[49:34] God now I got to go persecute these
[49:38] Christians if I tell them what's going
[49:41] through my
[49:42] mind they going to kill me
[49:45] now what have I put myself
[49:49] into what have I
[49:51] done
[49:53] Lord clean my table Lord
[49:57] clean What I've Done
[49:59] lord I can't take it back
[50:02] lord so Paul is such a
[50:05] mess his way to persecute those
[50:11] Christians he
[50:13] took the clothes of
[50:16] Sten how can I make this
[50:19] right but all of a
[50:21] sudden as he was on his way to
[50:25] Damascus a bright light shine before
[50:30] him him knowing the
[50:33] scripture he knew that was the same
[50:36] light that led the children
[50:40] is he said
[50:44] Lord what would you have me
[50:48] do what would you have me
[50:50] do how many of you
[50:53] tonight are in that same position
[50:58] that sometimes we think we know
[51:00] everything we think we have our lives
[51:02] figured
[51:03] out we have persecuted we have become a
[51:08] martyr a Marty in this last
[51:11] day because we're persecuting God's
[51:15] word when we have such a mighty
[51:20] testimony we have such a mighty word in
[51:22] our
[51:23] midst
[51:25] pers we have the clothes in our
[51:28] hands ste's clothes in
[51:31] our because why cuz we thought we had it
[51:36] all figured
[51:37] out when we left God on the
[51:41] side we just pushed him oh the pastor
[51:45] has it that's all we need he's bringing
[51:47] such a mighty powerful
[51:49] message that's all we
[51:52] need yeah that's what you need you need
[51:54] it inside of you
[51:57] that's why he says it over and
[51:59] over the word inside of
[52:02] you now get these TV shows inside of you
[52:06] get this Facebook inside of you these
[52:09] cell phones inside of you but get the
[52:12] word inside of
[52:13] you because God his Mercy is still
[52:19] here so Paul
[52:23] here God gave him a
[52:25] chance God gave him an
[52:27] opportunity because you know
[52:30] why he needed a man like
[52:33] Paul afraid to take the
[52:36] gospel afraid to cry out
[52:40] sin so the greatest message that was put
[52:44] forth Paul was that message of
[52:48] Steven Paul looked at that he was so
[52:52] determined with God's
[52:55] word so
[52:56] eted to make it right with
[52:59] God that he went with the gospel he
[53:04] started building churches he said God is
[53:07] still
[53:07] alive it's not me he said I used to be a
[53:12] Pharisee he said but it's not me anymore
[53:15] but it's Christ it's Christ that lives
[53:18] inside of
[53:19] me and that message is still going
[53:22] on the message of St
[53:26] you're marching
[53:27] on that no matter what confronts
[53:31] you he's more than able as you
[53:34] stand he's more than
[53:36] able more than able
[53:39] tonight that it doesn't matter your
[53:43] circumstance I don't care if you're
[53:47] down if you think you don't have a
[53:50] purpose your life can't be any worse
[53:53] than
[53:54] Paul's but now Paul got
[53:57] up his work was so
[54:01] hard he had to convince the
[54:04] people hey I'm not here to kill you
[54:09] anymore but I'm here to give you
[54:12] life so he had to convince the
[54:17] people that Christ was no longer
[54:20] dead but that he was alive
[54:26] [Music]
[54:28] with every eye closed
[54:31] tonight you know God is still
[54:37] calling you know we could turn God
[54:45] off but when we were yet his
[54:49] enemies he had loved
[54:52] us you see many times we think God owes
[54:55] us something
[54:59] he doesn't know it's
[55:01] nothing you see grace is an an unmerited
[55:07] favor he did it because he loved
[55:11] us he continues to do it
[55:14] because but you see church one
[55:17] day there won't be Grace
[55:21] anymore one day he will call for his
[55:24] judgment
[55:26] but you know what
[55:31] church we that congregate
[55:34] here can never say that the
[55:38] clean and true word has not been
[55:41] preached in our
[55:46] midst God gives us opportunity after
[55:51] opportunity and I don't know about you
[55:55] church but I wake up every
[55:59] day and it seems like I have failed God
[56:02] over and
[56:05] over but that's when we have to get up
[56:09] church and say
[56:12] Lord Lord I want to do something for
[56:14] your kingdom
[56:15] today I want to be able to go go to
[56:18] sleep tonight
