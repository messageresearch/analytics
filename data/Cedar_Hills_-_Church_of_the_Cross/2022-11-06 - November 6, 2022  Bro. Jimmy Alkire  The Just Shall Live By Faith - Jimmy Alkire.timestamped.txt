[32:46] [Music]
[33:09] El pagola
[33:16] my my
[33:19] isn't that wonderful
[33:21] isn't that why you're here this morning
[33:34] otherwise we wouldn't even be here
[33:39] they're privileged to be here in the
[33:41] house of the Lord
[33:44] to be able to speak to God's children
[33:47] and
[33:51] asking for your prayers God will help us
[33:54] bring this little subject
[33:58] the judge shall live
[34:03] and really what we're after is
[34:07] the approach to the sanctification yes
[34:13] and we're going to see that without a
[34:15] true understanding or Revelations
[34:24] will never be able to approach
[34:28] sanctification
[34:35] I've been doing this almost 40 years now
[34:39] that doesn't necessarily mean anything
[34:41] of I haven't learned
[34:45] but through the years I was just
[34:47] mentioning to brother Ben up there if we
[34:49] had all the people here that have come
[34:51] through here
[34:57] silver and here in Las Cruces
[34:59] we would need a tabernacle that would
[35:01] hold at least 2 000.
[35:08] and what what happened
[35:11] is that many
[35:25] but they never get past
[35:28] sanctification foreign
[35:43] The Book of Romans chapter 1
[35:47] Romano suno versus 17 and 18. versus
[35:54] amen how many brought their swords this
[35:56] morning
[35:57] how many soldiers
[36:03] about four minutes ago
[36:06] so I'm gonna do my best to not go over
[36:08] and out of course
[36:12] for me okay
[36:15] or therein is the righteousness of God
[36:18] revealed from Faith to Faith
[36:26] be part of it as it is written
[36:29] the just shall live by faith
[36:39] I wanted to stop there
[36:43] let's say it together
[36:45] for the just shall live by faith
[36:53] vivira
[36:57] have you ever wondered why it doesn't
[36:58] just say the judge live by faith
[37:10] right and it puts the sense in the
[37:13] future why does it say the just shall
[37:16] live by faith
[37:18] instead of just saying the justice
[37:24] you know the intellectual mind might ask
[37:26] that question but
[37:27] um
[37:30] God wants us to live in the future
[37:35] no no it's not
[37:37] we'll never get to the future without
[37:38] living today
[37:41] by faith today but it's showing you the
[37:45] characteristic of what this
[37:47] justification is
[37:56] it's always going to make them continue
[37:59] to live
[38:07] it's something that starts
[38:10] and it's something that goes foreign
[38:29] many people think that the process of
[38:31] the new birth
[38:34] to be justified
[38:37] to be Sanctified
[38:39] and then receive your I'm going to say
[38:42] it like this your first baptism of the
[38:45] Holy Ghost is
[38:52] not going to justify you anymore
[38:56] he's not going to sanctify you know
[38:59] it's not going to give you another
[39:01] baptism of the Holy ghosts
[39:04] you've got the total package
[39:07] you're already ready for the Rapture
[39:10] the sad thing is
[39:18] at his differences with the Pentecostal
[39:20] Church yes
[39:21] they thought when they got to that point
[39:24] to receive the baptism of the Holy
[39:26] ghosts
[39:29] and he goes no you're barely at the
[39:32] point where you can begin to grow
[39:37] and we have new people here
[39:40] us middle and older people
[39:44] as a matter of fact even though there's
[39:46] about 100 of us that are gone or more we
[39:48] still got a decent crab this morning
[39:52] there's much more of us middle and older
[39:55] folks than what we realize
[39:59] I never consider myself oh I never
[40:02] consider myself
[40:07] with that said and then then we're here
[40:10] because we want to continue
[40:13] the judge shall live by faith and
[40:18] and then it's right in the in the verse
[40:20] here
[40:21] why shall just person live by faith
[40:27] well the first part of the verse says
[40:30] for Darian is the righteousness of God
[40:33] revealed from Faith to Faith
[40:44] he's not going to reveal it to you all
[40:46] at once
[40:49] now let's take this word righteousness
[40:54] the Greek word is
[40:58] foreign
[41:43] consistent giving to everyone what is do
[41:47] them
[41:48] loving through the theaters
[41:53] exactly and then equity
[41:56] and that's just now talking about what
[41:59] God is doing
[42:01] is
[42:03] the important or consistent distribution
[42:08] of what Justice is amen
[42:17] now here's the key to all this
[42:21] it includes a lot of things
[42:24] and many times you don't see these
[42:26] things until you get in certain
[42:28] situations in your life
[42:32] when you begin to wonder why this and
[42:36] why that foreign
[43:25] and to visit
[43:28] the widows uh
[43:36] to keep yourself pure from the world is
[43:39] True Religion yes
[43:41] and then what is this producing us what
[43:44] is this righteousness produced in US
[43:48] Conformity of heart and life into the
[43:52] Divine Law uh
[43:56] Conformity of heart and life
[44:00] to the Divine Law Allah now we speak of
[44:04] the Divine Law we're speaking of the
[44:06] word of God
[44:09] the law of Grace
[44:11] we don't want to get into what the law
[44:14] was and what Grace is amen
[44:20] and I like this on Justice The Virtue
[44:24] which consists in giving to everyone
[44:29] what is
[44:32] then it goes to the word impartiality
[44:38] Equity is the impartial dispute
[44:40] distribution of Justice
[44:46] where did these attributes come from
[44:49] Psalms 98 verse 9. up there my dear
[44:53] brother
[44:57] amen
[45:00] before the Lord
[45:01] for he cometh to judge the Earth
[45:04] with righteousness shall he judge the
[45:06] world
[45:07] and the people with equity
[45:18] Isaiah 11 4.
[45:21] I say yes
[45:31] but with righteousness shall he judge
[45:34] the poor you know
[45:39] who with equity and and reprove with
[45:44] equity for the meat of the earth
[45:50] and he shall Smite the Earth
[45:56] and with the breath of his lips shall he
[46:00] slay though he couldn't respond
[46:03] that's what his Justice will do
[46:07] now before we go any further what does
[46:10] God base the Sun
[46:15] how is he to his Justice going to give
[46:19] each person
[46:24] it's all based on his foreign
[46:30] he knows
[46:31] the end from the beginning
[46:34] and sometimes I like to say he knows the
[46:38] end from before the beginning
[46:43] amen because he thought about it
[46:47] but there was no beginning
[46:50] until the word was spoken
[46:55] when he began to express the word
[46:59] in the beginning
[47:05] we're going slow this morning
[47:08] now on this I'd like to go to our first
[47:11] quote
[47:12] foreign
[47:20] amen
[47:24] [Music]
[47:26] I don't know why the the letters on this
[47:28] brother Eddie are our large journalists
[47:30] cutting off part of it so
[47:33] I know you
[47:34] you're doing the best and he's doing
[47:35] awesome job let me get it on my tablet I
[47:39] don't want to admit I don't want to
[47:40] leave out one word
[47:47] amen
[47:49] how many love the Lord this morning
[47:52] yes now you can maybe read it holy see
[47:55] how it cut part of it off on this side I
[47:59] just want to make sure I don't leave
[48:00] anything amen
[48:11] okay
[48:13] and we are the children of Abraham
[48:15] Hallelujah
[48:17] not as Isaac was
[48:20] but his Royal seat through Jesus Christ
[48:25] by the faith
[48:28] Abraham's seed
[48:31] coming forth in the last days
[48:38] to shine like the stars
[48:42] Abraham's children
[48:45] considered not his own body dead
[48:53] I don't want to read all that let's go
[48:55] to the next paragraph 2 30.
[48:58] he did Abraham didn't even consider his
[49:02] own body
[49:05] that was dead as far as producing a
[49:09] child
[49:10] by the way he was only a hundred years
[49:13] old
[49:17] but he didn't even take that into
[49:20] consideration
[49:24] oh you're an old man
[49:28] it's not based on that I don't even
[49:32] consider that is
[49:38] revealed to you
[49:41] when it really something you can't make
[49:45] it happen
[49:47] it's got to be revealed to you
[49:50] then you don't even consider anything
[49:53] else
[49:55] how impossible it is
[49:58] don't consider what the doctor said
[50:02] it doesn't say don't respect what the
[50:05] doctors
[50:07] don't confuse things here no no no no
[50:10] consider it in other words that's not
[50:14] going to dictate to you what your
[50:16] decision is going to be no no
[50:18] consideration
[50:22] about what your health is going to be
[50:26] your health is not determined on what
[50:29] the doctor says
[50:33] how much more Are Spiritual salvation
[50:37] spiritual Satan tries to tell us this
[50:39] and this and this about this all foreign
[50:43] [Music]
[51:22] it wasn't even brought into
[51:25] consideration
[51:28] oh my that shakes me
[51:31] body dead
[51:34] the deadness of Sarah's womb
[51:39] we're not even brought into
[51:42] consideration
[51:45] 232.
[51:48] no circumstances will be considered
[51:51] circumstances
[51:53] When Faith Finds Its betting grounds
[52:00] foreign
[52:35] or what you have been
[52:40] what I have said many times and the
[52:42] prophet says this is
[52:46] you must believe what God says about you
[52:49] yes
[52:51] more than what you know about your own
[52:55] self
[52:57] so if Abraham didn't consider even his
[53:01] lack of productivity as a man
[53:06] um
[53:08] how about us can we not consider
[53:11] everything that we've had in our life up
[53:14] to this point
[53:19] justification the the Justice the
[53:22] righteousness of God
[53:25] to be impartial
[53:28] is because he knew that you and I would
[53:31] accept this message
[53:34] he knew that you and I were going to
[53:37] receive the Lord Jesus Christ
[53:40] knew that we would go through this
[53:42] process
[53:48] that we would stick with the process
[53:55] let's continue now let's go back now to
[53:57] Rome I'll go to Romans 4.
[54:00] Romano
[54:02] verses three through six
[54:05] and as you would say
[54:08] we're going to get into the nitty-gritty
[54:13] we're going to enter into what makes you
[54:15] tick
[54:17] what motivates you yeah and this is
[54:21] where it gets a little sticky yeah
[54:26] and sometimes we don't like that
[54:28] because it makes us feel uncomfortable
[54:33] but how many want to feel right with
[54:35] that foreign amen
[54:43] amen
[54:44] verse 3 for what saith the scripture
[54:48] Abraham believed God
[54:51] and it was counted unto him for
[54:54] righteousness
[54:57] it wasn't based on what how he felt
[55:01] yeah it was based on what God had told
[55:06] him
[55:07] and we could go into many details how he
[55:10] could have gone by what he felt
[55:14] but now let's continue in the scriptures
[55:19] now him that worketh is the reward not
[55:23] reckoned of Grace but of death
[55:34] but to him that worketh not myself but
[55:39] believeth on him that justifieth the
[55:41] ungodly
[55:44] his faith is counted for righteousness
[55:49] now let's go back to the first part of
[55:52] that verse
[55:54] Abraham believed God and it was imputed
[55:57] to him as righteousness
[56:00] it's not something he had to work
[56:02] himself up to
[56:05] it was something that was revealed to
[56:07] him
[56:09] but watch the one that works now notice
[56:12] the eth as I've said many times
[56:23] those were to indicated something that
[56:26] starts and that it's continuing until it
[56:28] produces that's what this is
[56:35] but now it's going to talk about a
[56:36] person that wants to do work but Allah
[56:40] right but him that worketh
[56:44] not believeth on him that justified the
[56:47] ungodly
[56:48] let's go back to verse verse before that
[56:51] my brothers verse 4.
[56:53] um
[56:54] yes
[56:56] now to him that work worketh is the
[56:59] reward not wreck and the graceful of
[57:01] death
[57:08] first of all why does they use the word
[57:10] salary
[57:15] well when the person approaches it like
[57:17] this
[57:19] they think somebody owes them something
[57:24] yeah
[57:27] well at the roots of it
[57:32] what does this mean yes
[57:34] if you do what you do to begin to
[57:37] sanctify yourself
[57:40] because you feel like you owe him
[57:45] and many people ask them why they
[57:47] approach sanctification
[57:51] they start to dress right
[57:54] they start to grow their hair or cut
[57:56] their hair like you know all the
[57:58] requirements for men and women
[57:59] [Music]
[58:03] they're beautiful
[58:05] in the eyes of others they look like
[58:07] they're really holy
[58:11] want to be right
[58:13] how many you want to be right how many
[58:16] want to be holy
[58:18] how many want to show Christ through
[58:21] your your body
[58:23] there's not one of us here that wants to
[58:25] go out and be a devil knowing
[58:39] [Music]
[58:53] it's not a reward record of Grace
[59:01] when a person then takes the attitude
[59:04] that what they're doing is a work of
[59:08] Grace
[59:11] because they haven't
[59:13] understood even what Grace is
[59:18] it's the unmerited favor of God yes
[59:24] so they repent they get baptized
[59:27] I've seen this for many many years
[59:30] they continue a while continuing and
[59:34] then all of a sudden they're gone no
[59:36] matter how many times we call them on
[59:38] the phone
[59:40] try to show them brother we miss you
[59:43] I'm talking over a 30-year period look
[59:47] at that I'm talking about just right now
[59:49] you're going to misunderstand what I'm
[59:51] saying
[59:53] but they never approach sanctification
[59:56] correctly
[59:59] they did under justification
[1:00:02] the Lord Jesus
[1:00:04] to the best that they understood
[1:00:08] that sacrifice on calories
[1:00:11] died for them
[1:00:16] but they still don't live right
[1:00:21] and why don't forget your past sins are
[1:00:26] forgiven amen
[1:00:28] and I'm calling the prophet now
[1:00:31] but the desire
[1:00:34] to do those things
[1:00:37] that God forgave them for in the past
[1:00:44] so it's going to continue
[1:01:15] how many want to approach it correctly
[1:01:21] space that's not based on Grace
[1:01:24] but it's based on what he did for you at
[1:01:27] Calvary
[1:01:31] as our Pastor said last Sunday how many
[1:01:33] remembered that message what a
[1:01:35] tremendous message
[1:01:38] if you don't truly receive the
[1:01:41] Revelation that you are Justified
[1:01:47] how can you ever be born again
[1:01:51] I might have not said it verbatim just
[1:01:54] every little word that's as close as I
[1:01:56] can remember I would have to go but
[1:01:57] that's the gist of what he was saying
[1:02:03] um
[1:02:07] without that see Nestle that God has
[1:02:12] Justified you oh brother Jimmy quit
[1:02:15] beating around the bush tell us what to
[1:02:17] be just means
[1:02:20] what justification is yes
[1:02:25] but I'm making sure that you're
[1:02:27] following
[1:02:29] how many are following
[1:02:32] it doesn't make any difference that I'm
[1:02:35] saying it in one sense
[1:02:39] because I'm not the important one here
[1:02:43] neither are you individually
[1:02:47] but it's us together
[1:02:50] in Christ and Christo that's the goal
[1:02:53] islameter that's what we're after it is
[1:02:59] so without that correct Revelation yes
[1:03:04] you're gonna always
[1:03:07] do things for a wrong mode
[1:03:13] now what is the word Justified
[1:03:16] let's nail it uh
[1:03:20] justification
[1:03:22] is the act of justifying
[1:03:27] to be just
[1:03:30] trying to be right
[1:03:33] um
[1:03:38] Vindication indication
[1:03:40] defense defense oh is God defending you
[1:03:45] yes see what is the justification going
[1:03:48] to do then
[1:03:51] at the end of the court case
[1:03:58] but that Court was all done through
[1:04:02] Jesus Christ
[1:04:04] he took our place
[1:04:09] so that we can take his place
[1:04:16] was the judicial sentence
[1:04:20] the Declaration of Innocence
[1:04:24] he declared you innocence
[1:04:28] through the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:04:31] Christ the famous quote we read all the
[1:04:34] time
[1:04:37] as though we never did it to begin with
[1:04:42] through this declaration
[1:04:51] and always will be one of those Sons and
[1:04:55] Daughters of God
[1:04:59] that was rejoicing in your salvation
[1:05:02] through Jesus
[1:05:04] since before the foundation of the world
[1:05:09] in his great thinking
[1:05:12] so you're rejoicing
[1:05:15] in your salvation and to Salvation Caleb
[1:05:18] also managed in that quote yesterday
[1:05:20] last Sunday
[1:05:23] and I use that in Juarez
[1:05:26] so let's go to that quoting serpent seed
[1:05:29] brother up there serpent seeds
[1:05:33] paragraph number one amen
[1:05:39] how many love the Lord Jesus
[1:05:41] how do you how many would like to know
[1:05:44] why God would vindicate
[1:05:48] you've been uh
[1:05:54] but what is he going to vindicate
[1:05:58] what is he going to Defenders
[1:06:04] thank you
[1:06:07] no no
[1:06:09] he knows this as a perverse
[1:06:12] but he saw something Beyond this
[1:06:16] let's read the quote amen
[1:06:20] dear God
[1:06:22] the Great and Mighty God
[1:06:26] who formed All Things by the power of
[1:06:29] His Spirit
[1:06:31] has brought Jesus Christ
[1:06:34] his only begotten son
[1:06:39] who Philly died for we Sinners
[1:06:45] for the unjust foreign
[1:07:33] way back before the foundation of the
[1:07:36] world
[1:07:37] how do we know
[1:07:40] that that wasn't at the same time the
[1:07:43] lamb was slain yes
[1:07:51] it was at the same time
[1:07:54] the same body of what we would call time
[1:07:57] is it
[1:08:01] but at this part here he was not working
[1:08:05] in time
[1:08:07] what he was working was in an event
[1:08:12] that he was going to make come to pass
[1:08:16] in the future
[1:08:19] remember time with God
[1:08:22] is
[1:08:24] and you're a part of God's events
[1:08:37] did he sell you in this event
[1:08:41] amen and
[1:08:45] and at the same time
[1:08:47] in his mind instrument he saw the lamb
[1:08:52] he slayed the land
[1:08:55] because he saw that you and I were going
[1:08:58] to fall
[1:09:00] and how is he going to leave us in that
[1:09:02] condition
[1:09:04] okay now let's continue reading
[1:09:07] yeah when God
[1:09:09] in his great thinking
[1:09:13] shouting and rejoicing in our Salvation
[1:09:16] to Jesus
[1:09:18] [Music]
[1:09:19] Christ this is what he's going to base
[1:09:23] his justification on
[1:09:26] this is what he's going to base his
[1:09:28] righteousness
[1:09:31] his just decision to to decision to
[1:09:35] elect us since before the foundation of
[1:09:39] the world
[1:09:40] when he saw us rejoices
[1:09:43] the foundation Jesus
[1:09:52] I want to let that soak in a little bit
[1:09:54] okay
[1:09:57] we've heard that so many times what does
[1:10:00] it means
[1:10:03] if he saw us rejoicing in our Salvation
[1:10:06] through Jesus
[1:10:10] Jesus the lamb he's already slain
[1:10:13] foreign
[1:10:56] foreign
[1:11:58] yes Glory
[1:12:00] and wipe away the memories
[1:12:03] you know another statement our pastor
[1:12:06] made last week is
[1:12:08] that justification it's not just for
[1:12:12] The Sinner yeah
[1:12:15] it's for the Savior yes Salvador
[1:12:21] he went through the same thing
[1:12:25] but in order to manifest the
[1:12:27] justification
[1:12:29] the Declaration the Declaration that we
[1:12:33] never did it to begin with
[1:12:36] he had to go to Calvary
[1:12:39] but he couldn't stay in the grave
[1:12:41] foreign
[1:13:24] just means you understand
[1:13:26] as you approach sanctifications foreign
[1:13:54] [Music]
[1:13:59] and you are already Justified
[1:14:08] he justified
[1:14:10] and those he's Justified
[1:14:14] he has already glorified glorificado
[1:14:19] but it is it looks like he skipped
[1:14:21] sanctification didn't it
[1:14:27] he said if these people my children in
[1:14:30] Las Cruces
[1:14:34] can truly be justified by faith
[1:14:39] and they understand it's me vindicating
[1:14:42] what I've already thought yeah
[1:14:46] they'll go through hell or high water to
[1:14:49] make it
[1:14:51] y'all go to sanctification
[1:14:54] not go through the loss of friends
[1:14:57] Amigos
[1:15:02] don't go through anything
[1:15:04] sanctification ain't gonna stop them
[1:15:07] because I Justified
[1:15:09] they're glorified conditions
[1:15:13] I can see it every moment around my
[1:15:16] Throne
[1:15:18] I can see that Celestial body
[1:15:21] I can see that glorified State
[1:15:25] oh I know they're gonna stick with the
[1:15:28] process
[1:15:32] nobody discourage them
[1:15:35] they're not going to focus on what
[1:15:37] anybody does to them
[1:15:40] focus on the purpose of God
[1:15:44] has put down in your heart
[1:15:50] the problem is the problem is friction
[1:15:53] comes among people in the church
[1:15:57] no
[1:16:00] no your
[1:16:01] ability my glasses though
[1:16:03] no not here not here
[1:16:06] because we can see God doing that in
[1:16:08] ourselves
[1:16:11] but we don't see him doing it
[1:16:20] once in a while I hear somebody says oh
[1:16:23] brother this that in the oven oh I don't
[1:16:25] know and this and that so let's discuss
[1:16:27] this is
[1:16:29] all right let's listen to him for not
[1:16:31] very long because I don't like that
[1:16:37] brother sister hermano hermana did that
[1:16:40] person die for you yes
[1:16:45] did that person justify you yes
[1:16:48] that person raised from the dead for
[1:16:50] years
[1:16:52] oh and by the way
[1:16:55] uh is this where God Wants You is
[1:16:59] this where he's placed you in the body
[1:17:01] yes
[1:17:04] very spiritually in the body of Christ
[1:17:07] universally
[1:17:11] and then here locally
[1:17:14] is this what God wants
[1:17:17] many times
[1:17:20] in Silver City these things would arise
[1:17:26] people say brother if this you don't
[1:17:29] tell this is your place
[1:17:30] I'll help you
[1:17:40] if I'm not the man that God has ordained
[1:17:44] to see you through then he's got to be
[1:17:47] somewhere you better you better get down
[1:17:48] to business with God and find out where
[1:17:50] you're supposed to be because
[1:17:55] get rid of the people
[1:17:58] and I tell the people oh this is where
[1:18:02] God wants me uh
[1:18:05] they all answered me that way when I get
[1:18:07] down to the nitty gritty
[1:18:09] by the way I say oh there's not that
[1:18:12] many so don't get any ideas
[1:18:18] and I go then if this is where God wants
[1:18:20] you see
[1:18:23] no devil yeah no situation
[1:18:28] nothing take you away from what God has
[1:18:32] placed for you no they can now look at
[1:18:35] it because if you leave your place
[1:18:39] God has placed
[1:18:41] that church is going to suffer the whole
[1:18:44] thing like like
[1:18:46] how many believe that how many have read
[1:18:49] the adoption
[1:18:54] then I have no business looking at
[1:18:57] somebody else that I think is not doing
[1:18:59] their part
[1:19:03] doing what God called me to do
[1:19:07] I'm standing in the bridge
[1:19:13] I have that characteristics through that
[1:19:16] seeds
[1:20:12] pretty good little over half
[1:20:14] that'll increase the middle as you get
[1:20:17] the revelation
[1:20:18] if I can believe I'm a part of the Bride
[1:20:22] I think
[1:20:25] otherwise but goodies and don't just you
[1:20:29] know
[1:20:30] look at it that that way
[1:20:33] brother Tommy says one time
[1:20:35] I'm Not Gonna Leave Nobody behind you
[1:20:39] said more than one time I'm sure you've
[1:20:42] heard him saying
[1:20:44] our pastor now brother Caleb he's got
[1:20:47] the same I we are not gonna leave no one
[1:20:50] behind the woman
[1:20:53] because we know that God is working in
[1:20:57] his people my
[1:21:03] can you imagine what am I not in his
[1:21:06] thoughts and his thinking
[1:21:07] is
[1:21:10] already forgiven you yeah
[1:21:14] what you were going to do when you came
[1:21:17] to Earth
[1:21:37] salvation is isn't that what we're doing
[1:21:40] here this morning
[1:21:41] are you rejoicing in yourself
[1:21:45] exactly what his thinking was
[1:21:49] when he justified
[1:21:52] he's defending what he thought about yes
[1:21:57] what you think about yourself
[1:22:02] oh boy I started she stopped moving
[1:22:05] right there I don't know about you my my
[1:22:09] that makes me feel like Giant
[1:22:13] a giant well you're only five foot seven
[1:22:15] no I'm probably not even a five foot
[1:22:16] seven minutes as you get older you grow
[1:22:19] right
[1:22:23] Amen brother
[1:22:27] but I'm not talking about
[1:22:32] Brothers
[1:22:33] [Music]
[1:22:34] why when that bride she wakes up
[1:22:38] comfort and shine like never before yeah
[1:22:43] amen and we're doing good on time so far
[1:22:46] I've only been going 40 minutes
[1:22:50] [Music]
[1:22:52] oh my
[1:22:57] God so when he saw rejoice
[1:23:01] in our salvation
[1:23:04] it was the Vindication
[1:23:07] of the scriptures in job
[1:23:16] our Spirits rotated out of God
[1:23:21] remember this is not based on time
[1:23:25] as we know it
[1:23:29] but our Spirits rotate out of God
[1:23:33] out of this great light
[1:23:35] yes
[1:23:38] and man we start running around the
[1:23:40] church
[1:23:43] going around that logos
[1:23:46] and we're going around that logos
[1:23:49] foreign
[1:24:35] damn angels as Los Angeles and
[1:24:38] everything was so happy
[1:24:43] before the foundation of the world
[1:24:48] it strikes in me you know they will pay
[1:24:50] for it
[1:24:54] how is the devil Ever Gonna Keep Me in
[1:24:57] the dust of the earth
[1:25:00] he just can't do it
[1:25:03] that's right
[1:25:05] how is he gonna he's talking about if he
[1:25:08] dies
[1:25:11] how is the devil Gonna Keep Me in the
[1:25:14] dust of the earth
[1:25:17] if my spirit as the Son of God
[1:25:23] the Creator created
[1:25:27] in the form of a spirit and form of the
[1:25:29] spirit the one his plan is finished
[1:25:35] foreign
[1:25:57] about you
[1:25:59] bye
[1:26:02] we love the Lord Jesus
[1:26:05] now I would like to go to the scriptures
[1:26:08] as we tie this into sanctification
[1:26:12] sanctification which means let's say
[1:26:15] together sanctification sanctification
[1:26:18] cleanse
[1:26:20] and set aside
[1:26:22] before sir
[1:26:26] we've heard it
[1:26:28] future home of the Heavenly bridegroom
[1:26:30] with the Earthly bride uh

[1:26:44] she's talking about this mine is
[1:26:49] no that's not the mind this is just the
[1:26:51] computer
[1:26:53] what do you think they got the idea of
[1:26:55] the computer from here
[1:27:00] he's talking about the mind of the
[1:27:03] spirit of the spirit that he went placed
[1:27:06] in the heart
[1:27:07] that will control this computer
[1:27:11] this mind this carnal mind the brain is
[1:27:18] no longer be able to dictate to you and
[1:27:21] me
[1:27:24] what we're doing
[1:27:26] there's something in the heart
[1:27:29] that is so Superior yes
[1:27:34] that from the inside out
[1:27:37] there comes a Divine
[1:27:40] Supreme
[1:27:42] control control
[1:27:44] like I tell all the ministers
[1:27:47] they're all younger than me now most of
[1:27:50] them
[1:27:51] you know and you get excited when you're
[1:27:53] going to preach
[1:27:54] and sometimes your nerves are just
[1:27:58] and you're getting a little frustrated
[1:28:02] because you don't want to defraud God's
[1:28:04] people okay
[1:28:07] I promised I would never stand up here
[1:28:09] and defraud God's people
[1:28:14] yeah
[1:28:17] I hope your picture don't go too fast
[1:28:24] and I say much
[1:28:27] little boys
[1:28:34] do you believe in God
[1:28:39] those that speak English
[1:28:41] and those that speak Spanish
[1:28:45] don't you think he wants everyone to
[1:28:47] understand
[1:28:49] so simple we make it so complicated
[1:28:53] oh by the way
[1:28:57] what is anointing yes
[1:29:00] I jump and run all over the place
[1:29:08] anointing is supreme control is control
[1:29:16] I'm not your control I don't know about
[1:29:18] you no no I don't
[1:29:20] you it's all done
[1:29:24] don't insult yourself because you're one
[1:29:26] of God's people you
[1:29:31] how many believe it with all your heart
[1:29:37] getting close here but let's go now to
[1:29:41] chapter 38 of Ezekiel
[1:29:44] because we're entering into
[1:29:45] sanctification we have the approach now
[1:29:51] we enter in to be cleansed
[1:29:54] we're already Justified
[1:29:57] God's already declared our innocence
[1:29:59] through the blood yeah
[1:30:06] just to feel better
[1:30:10] to to not feel guilty
[1:30:14] because we no longer feel guilty
[1:30:17] we're going to go through this process
[1:30:20] of sanctification
[1:30:23] because our Lord and savior Salvador
[1:30:26] won't do the same thing is
[1:30:31] people say what didn't Caleb say last
[1:30:35] Sunday
[1:30:37] justification wasn't just for the center
[1:30:40] yeah
[1:30:47] that's why to his resurrection foreign
[1:31:02] thus will I magnify myself
[1:31:05] and sanctify myself
[1:31:11] and I will be known in the eyes of many
[1:31:14] nations
[1:31:17] and they shall know that I am
[1:31:25] not isn't that a mouthful leave that
[1:31:27] scripture up bro I mean I'm just sitting
[1:31:29] here I'm almost slobbering you know
[1:31:32] thus will I magnify myself
[1:31:38] foreign
[1:32:50] amen I'm no longer my own
[1:32:54] I am bought with a price
[1:32:56] I don't just know Jesus as my savior
[1:33:00] Jesus
[1:33:08] no man can call Jesus
[1:33:13] except by the Holy Spirit
[1:33:17] I can't say he's my the possessor of me
[1:33:20] you don't know
[1:33:23] me
[1:33:25] in control of me
[1:33:27] if the Holy Spirit
[1:33:35] John 17.
[1:33:37] Juan this is yet oh I see he's going to
[1:33:39] go through the same process everybody
[1:33:41] important
[1:33:43] how many have read this scripture is
[1:33:45] beautiful
[1:33:47] read the whole chapter it's wonderful
[1:33:51] John 17 7.
[1:33:56] sanctify them through thy truth from
[1:33:59] difficult
[1:34:00] Thy word is
[1:34:05] as thou has sent me into the world
[1:34:09] even so have I also sent them into the
[1:34:13] world
[1:34:14] [Music]
[1:34:16] doesn't that make you feel good
[1:34:20] yeah he's he was sent into this world
[1:34:24] and now he's sending us
[1:34:28] in another place the same father that
[1:34:31] sent Jesus
[1:34:35] went in Jesus
[1:34:38] when he sent them and when he sends you
[1:34:42] and me I'll stay the same Jesus Mundo
[1:34:54] all right verse 19.
[1:34:57] the next verse
[1:34:59] and for their sakes I sanctify myself
[1:35:06] that they also might be Sanctified
[1:35:09] through the truth
[1:35:13] in other words if I don't sanctify
[1:35:15] myself
[1:35:19] [Music]
[1:35:23] if you don't sanctify yourself
[1:35:27] how is the rest of your family going to
[1:35:29] be Sanctified
[1:35:32] let's just bring it down
[1:35:39] scripture and then we'll have two quotes
[1:35:41] real quick and then we're done other
[1:35:43] times about God
[1:35:45] Hebrews 2
[1:35:47] videos
[1:35:52] for it became him from whom all whom are
[1:35:57] all things
[1:35:58] and by whom are altered
[1:36:01] and bringing many sons unto Glory
[1:36:11] to visit
[1:36:16] up to make the captain of their
[1:36:19] salvation perfect
[1:36:22] through something
[1:36:27] like Gloria
[1:36:29] Perfection is
[1:36:36] next verse 11.
[1:36:39] for both he that sanctified
[1:36:42] and they who are Sanctified are all of
[1:36:48] One
[1:36:49] is
[1:36:53] piados
[1:37:11] set aside for service
[1:37:13] and then the Holy Ghost comes in and put
[1:37:16] you in the service
[1:37:20] he's going through the process
[1:37:24] for which cause he's not ashamed to call
[1:37:28] them bread
[1:37:32] aren't you happy that he's not ashamed
[1:37:35] to call us a Brethren said
[1:37:39] we're going through the process
[1:37:43] last few quotes
[1:37:45] amen
[1:37:55] get it up there for me please
[1:38:00] watch this
[1:38:02] and we're gonna probably jump through
[1:38:04] this just to not beat it off
[1:38:08] he is the bridegroom
[1:38:13] took away your shame
[1:38:18] he took away and
[1:38:22] put it in the sea of forgiveness
[1:38:26] [Music]
[1:38:29] and by the washing of the water of the
[1:38:31] word
[1:38:37] and the blood of life
[1:38:40] that's right that's what the Bible says
[1:38:43] your first husband that you were married
[1:38:46] to to
[1:38:48] the world the people talking spiritually

[1:39:19] as though you never did it at the
[1:39:22] beginning

[1:39:28] this is
[1:39:30] this is in the month of November
[1:39:34] of 1965.
[1:39:39] I think
[1:39:42] 65.00
[1:39:43] this is as though you never did it
[1:39:49] because now you've been Washed
[1:39:53] by the Water of the world
[1:39:57] when it says as though you never did it
[1:40:01] means as if you never did it
[1:40:06] but here in sanctification
[1:40:08] sanctification the complete
[1:40:11] manifestation of what you are
[1:40:14] still not known
[1:40:17] so there's part of you as a human that
[1:40:21] did do it
[1:40:23] but through the spirit of the word and
[1:40:26] the blood the Lord
[1:40:30] as though you never did it
[1:40:33] and you stand Justified
[1:40:39] you'll never see it and notice how his
[1:40:43] time justifications
[1:40:48] of the Water by the word
[1:40:56] without that foreign

[1:41:05] that just go to our last quote
[1:41:09] things that are to be reaching 65 also
[1:41:11] because uh
[1:41:18] things that are to be here we are
[1:41:22] the Bible said so Jesus said
[1:41:26] before be there for perfect perfect
