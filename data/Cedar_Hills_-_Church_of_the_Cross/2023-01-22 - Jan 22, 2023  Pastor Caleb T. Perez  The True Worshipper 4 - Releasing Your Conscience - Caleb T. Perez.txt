the father or one amen we want to get into the word I I I I just as I said I just we're very grateful to God for for what he's given us Miracles the deliverances remember the Fight Continues don't don't just say oh that was a wonderful time and then go back to your same lifestyle that has to be a change gotta be a change you can't go back to the same way you're living right you gotta fight the good fight amen got to maintain what God's given us we want to this is our fourth message on the true worshiper and uh and I want to put a subtitle to this releasing your conscience many of you young people want to know the will of God in your life where are you going to find it you just pray and then it just comes automatically how does it come to you can't know the will of God this is not just for the young people for all of us but I believe that we we got to know God's provided way and how he does things so this I pray it's a blessing to you once again releasing your conscience where's your conscience in your body where's your conscience oh come on vamos we went into a brand to a brick wall where's your conscience where are you sure yeah like not you're not sure today maybe you're still a little drunk but say like you mean it where is your conscience amen so releasing your conscience as our conscience we are born with a conscience that is bound by a nature of a sinful nature and so if you can turn in your Bibles to the book of Saint John the fourth chapter 23rd verse we have been reading these two scriptures and we pray that they it is a blessing when you have it you can say Amen foreign like this but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him amen God bless the visitors that are here God bless you all also we have brother brother would yelled is there too God bless you guys Revelations 11 1 says there was given me a read like unto a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of God and the Altar and them that worship therein says blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen sure was nice to see you back up here Sister Laura I enjoyed that once again there were three things that are needed three things that are needed in worship and you remember anybody to help me out here this morning things that are needed required for true worship somebody else a temple an altar and and a worshiper amen tell your neighbor Temple and Temple altar worshiper three things that are needed for worship God will not receive worship without these three things I'm watching you now that she means you're not going to bed early enough all right let me make sure a temple and an altar a worshiper once again God will not receive worship without these three things a temple for that's where his glory comes to Gloria it is his reference point here on Earth it is First Corinthians 6 19 says what says he say what oh no ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost once again we need a temple this is that ye your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you okay which we have of God and we are not your own Matthew 23 19 says fools and blind for weather is greater the gift or the altar that sanctifieth the gifts there is an altar then and the reason you we need an altar for true worship as it's the altar that sanctifieth the gift that's right amen without the altar there is no sanctifying of the gift it's the altar as he said that sanctifies it and sets it aside for service and brother Branham says your heart is the altar so now we have a temple we have a an altar Temple your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost heart is the altar that's where God comes to and then he continues he says then around this altar the Lord healing in a greater measure okay now we got a couple of things now we're that we're hitting now we got the Temple of the Holy Ghost that we are around the altar once again measure the measure the Altar and then he says healing in a greater measure in a more higher measure in the highest plane that there is what is it Eternal healing wow eternal spirit is making Eternal creatures out of Eternal out of eat of creatures of time once again making Eternal creatures out of creatures of time then you have the worshiper and the true worshipers are the expressed attributes of God yes or yes COC once again the worshipers are the expressed attributes of God and so therefore the worshipers that are once purged should have no more conscience or desire of sin this is where we're going today you should have no more conscience of sins because the conscience has been released from a sinful nature okay here's where we're going now now three things in the Old Testament were three separate things in the new testamento three things right in order for this to be accomplished in Christ the mystery he says Mysterio Heavenly places just for a momento Heavenly places is the believer's position in Christ I want you to tell your neighbor Heavenly places is the believer's position in Christ so where the believer stands in Christ is Heavenly places if you find your position you're in Heavenly places you can't find your position or not be in Heavenly places that's impossible okay this is what happens when we set together Ephesians chapter 3 and verse 8 as I build this Foundation fundamental unto me Who Am less than the least of All Saints is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ in extractiveness request as a Christian and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the Mysteries this is what we want to get to yeah The Fellowship of the mystery how many knows once again that that hello how many know that God's will in your life is a mystery Mysterio right it's a mystery it's a Mysterio it's a struggling nature trying to find out what am I doing here on Earth so we're trying to get into the The Fellowship of the Mysteries you know sometimes we have a hard time with this but we want to stay away from from brothers or sisters but but they're part of the mystery that's why when you don't feel connected what's happening I've got to get back to the fellowship because when I sit down and have fellowship with brother Emilio and I began to to talk with him I began to see the part of the mystery it's a great mystery it's been here but now it's been manifested through the members of the body of Christ how many uh how many here can say I'm I believe I'm a I'm one of the members of the body of Christ it goes beyond just talking and having a good time but if we want to get into the fellowship of it I gotta know what brother Elijah's what he's going through yes or or brother Paul I gotta know they're also struggling nature to find that Fellowship we didn't talk to each other let's find The Fellowship of the Mysteries this is a great mystery Mysterio watch this efficacy this Fellowship of the mystery is the companies which from the beginning of the world has been hidden God you've been hearing God know ye not that you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost to pour this into you but he needs a temple he needs an altar and he needs a worshiper that's why the true worshipers okay we're I caught another one another one over there yawning get your yawns out before you get to church hello everybody brother it's been a long week and sure you're gonna get this today to the intent verse 10 verses yes that now unto the principalities and powers in Heavenly places might be known by the church oh I I like this now because it's got to be known by the church Fellowship of the Mysteries known by the church the manifold wisdom of God now you all said you want to know right I want to know what the mystery is Will in your life it's for the church watch in verse 11 according to the Eternal purpose that's because we come to the same church yes or yes COC that doesn't equal automatically equal if we go to the church wonderful no the devil came to church this morning you know the spirit of antichrist is moving along in the audience too in whom we have boldness now Hallelujah [Music] the Bible says let us therefore come boldly Before the Throne he wants us to have boldness and accessor oh yeah access with confidence somebody told me the other day one of the guys walks upstairs and says can I have a bottle of water yeah I was like hey when you go home do you say uh can I get a bottle of water this is your house have confidence you need a bottle of water get a bottle of water brother Ethan when you are at home do you say uh mom dada can I get something to eat from the refrigerator what do you do okay you just do it he said he's got access Got Confidence in church that's what he wants for me you have access to him you have you got to have confidence go and take what's yours with confidence by the faith of him we'll start then to re to to reach New Heights what could a church accomplish Iglesia I saw a lot of things being accomplished this week what was going on we were getting into the Fellowship of the Mysteries what could a church do for God if we could get into this place with him The Fellowship of the Mysteries that's where we'll get into the perfect worship when the body begins to come together unite together my goodness when this worshiper comes together with this worship together with these words That's what Satan fears it's the unity don't let nothing take it away from you I'm in disagreement with a lot of things that's okay take you out of the Fellowship of the Mysteries and you find yourself cold and indifference Ephesians 1 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus the angels of God are with us spiritual blessings to us spirituales yes or yes COC uh I don't see him I don't feel him huh they're here you're not available but they're not here just to pass some time the Bible says here watch watch this is the prophet in the infallibility of God's spoken word the angels of God are with us to minister spiritual blessings to help us along the road and encourage us as we see the hill of Zion Yonder in sight now he says the reason we don't have spiritual blessings I have too much time to watch television his wonders to perform too much time to read the newspapers or listening to something that we ought not to listen to is yeah listening to a lot of stuff we don't need to be listening and we are not Redeeming the time for giving it to the things of the world instead of our time to the Lord Jesus Christ that's the air that we make we release our conscience is money cars houses Lord's really blessing me I can go on vacation God bless you and those things spiritual blessings oh the blessings that we look for now they have a car why can't I get it what does it have to do with the Fellowship of the Mysteries we're releasing the conscience to the wrong things this is God's desire for his church this is my desire as a pastor my question is can we reach this level I'll do all that I can church but I need each one of you to to do all that you can too lord gave me this and as I was reading I said oh Lord and say Lord can we ever get there when I pick up the phone or I sit down to talk with somebody then that's all I hear is this one doesn't like this one this person doesn't get along with that one is going to sit in my study and cry you know how will we ever get there opening my heart to you as a pastor and we ever get there our Spirits watch releasing the conscience conscience is in the spirit right this is adoption number one on the screen now our Spirits has brought us into it Heavenly atmosphere oh brother Heavenly atmosphere celestial problem is it's not always a Heavenly atmosphere celestial oh what could happen it's a question what could happen tonight if we would be sitting here in Heavenly places they're in a Heavenly atmosphere and the Holy Spirit moving over every heart that's been regenerated and become a new creature in Christ Jesus Christ all sins under the blood all sins but you don't know what what they did to me come on now when will we get to the place where we can see each other through the blood of the blood look at you all I see is the blood because if I am the Temple of the Holy Ghost then when God looks at the Earth all he sees is the blood of his son going around then why are we trying to get out get under the blood and see what's going on in perfect worship with our hands up to God your heart's lifted in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus worshiping together that's what I'm after this morning worshiping together in Heavenly place juntos brother Branham asks you the question did you ever set in one yes I don't know about you but I was I was gone on Fridays oh I have he says that till I would Weep For Joy yes and say God never let me leave here it's a shame we live here everything he gives us it runs out when we get home what is waiting for us at home it is a leak and by Monday Tuesday it's it's gone never let me live here a place that you can take with that you can be at anywhere you're at it's a place that you can invite somebody to come in with you can we Fellowship about the Mysteries just Heavenly places in Christ so now let's let's see what the blessings are he's blessing us with brand new cars oh yeah oh see yeah brand new Raptor Raptor I gotta put myself there right oh brand new this or that yeah let's see what this spiritual blessings for all the worldly things Divina [Music] [Applause] Divine Healing is not just the healing of the body the healing of the Soul he wants to heal our souls more than anything he's blessing us with Divine Healing he's blessing us with foreknowledge oh now we're getting into what he wants to give the church to get together he wants to give us foreknowledge look through the message you'll find foreknowledge of God everywhere he wants to give you give us Revelations he wants to give us Visions he wants to give us Powers all the Heavenly blessings he he would bankrupt all of heaven or he would go back on one word of him Heavenly blessings I ask where is this Joy it's hard to find it anymore out of the Fellowship of the Mysteries has been released not your brother and sisters every heart filled with the spirit come on now walking together now you know why we talked about this in youth areas setting together in Heavenly places not one evil thought amongst well I don't have check your thoughts what you've been thinking of okay who you've been thinking of oh come on we many times are so far from The Fellowship of them is not one cigarette smoke we're all Christians not in here right yourself not one short dress oh we don't want to talk about that oh no we don't want to go there huh oh we're going there we just went there not one this or that is not one evil thought nobody got anything against one another okay foreign oh yeah that's real Fellowship foreign I want to see by your hands I'm going to go down the things and I'm going to see how many of you desire this is so what's the problem if we desire it is come on what's the problem are we one way in church and another way at home I desire that you I don't know if you understand conscience or desires because his conscience has been released that's why you gotta sigh and cry for the Abomination you'll desire this church you can't just want it you gotta desire it is everybody's speaking in love and harmony everybody in One Accord in one place suddenly there came from heaven like a Russian Mighty Wind he said there you are he has blessed us with all spiritual blessings that's the believer's position in Christ the believer can all listen closely the believer can only worship Christ in Christ minuto you think just sitting here in church you're in Heavenly places no no you can sit here and be stuck to the Earth where the status but how many want to go to Heavenly places why don't we desire it every time we come why are we not an expectation every time why do we have to wait for a week-long service foreign it's got to be a constantly everyday thing you don't listen closely you cannot Worship the Lord just because you came to church oh I went and well I really Worship the Lord never found your place in Christ he will not accept that word come on Checkers I I gotta check myself I said Lord I want true I want to be a true worshiper the believer can only worship Christ as he is now brother Brown stops and says I don't believe you get it this is I don't believe you get it watch him now all right let me go another route it is going there wow look and then he says look why does he say a meeting this is the believer's position in Christ I'm gonna go another route we're not getting anything a believer cannot worship and has no right to worship not just not only can you not worship but you don't even have a right to work no man has no right to Worship the Lord your side of being in the body of the Lord Jesus Christ did you know that oh as we think because we raise our hands and we sing a few songs we're worshiping the Lord he said Cain was a worshiper where do we pick up these ideas we can live any kind of life and come raise our hands in church and everything's cool no right to even worship Him by one Spirit coming to the body baptized into the body but then you have a right to begin to finally worship that's what he's telling the woman at the well you worship ye no not what you were says no right to worship unless you come into this body outside of your position there is no true worship why okay because outside of the body but you're always fighting against the people that are in the body and if they're in the body but worship is in here you're fighting against them they're actually fighting against him come on now people are fighting against Christ his worship is in her when we find our place our position even one worshiper you begins to unite with another worship oh my now we're on to something now The Fellowship of the Mysteries that's the trouble we shouldn't be broke up in organizations and denominations we should be Sons and Daughters of God holding the great galaxy of the world together you want a purpose in life you want God's perfect will get in love perfect what a purpose you should be Sons and Daughters taking the great galaxy of the world together but there's so much unbelief that keeps us apart foreign but then pero luego and realize our conscience has to be released is that is my goodness it's getting hot and we're coming to something and listen closely especially you young people listen closely because I hear this time and time again for the young people behind myself ask the same questions what's my purpose what am I doing I don't get some of these things this is a huge key I believe that the Lord is giving us today you all ready you ready list this is our founding pastor is when I read the scripture and I'm sick is I don't read it by his stripes ye are healed forces all right brother Ron I mean I'm on a run all right brother Noah I don't read it by his stripes you are healed okay open your Bibles okay now when you read your Bible say this open it like you're going to read it when you read your Bible and it says by his stripes how many have read that scripture before right let me see your hands if you read it okay what did you get out of the scripture what's the key here's the key now I'm giving you this key adding it to you you're going to use it from now on okay why did you read by his stripes oh somebody got a little Revelation over there he says I read it the way brother Branham taught me to read it brother Branham I don't know there's so many mistakes and errors in the message the way he taught us to read by his stripes I mean here we are Stripes amen amen it was wounded for our transgressions we're not reading it the way he taught us he says the way that I read it he says is by his stripes okay now it's you when you read the scriptures it's not just the history book young people you gotta read it it's for you buy his stripes Caleb Perez is here okay we're getting to something here now but I want you or you young people to get this come on say it you're healed you're not reading it the way I taught you say it again no stand up nah what is he say it like a man do you all hear it back there no they didn't hear turn around and tell them come on come on don't be afraid now he's reading it right and now he's confessing with his Mouse what is he doing he's releasing his conscience he's releasing the conscience to the world here's the key now you gotta put your name there is yeah what is it whosoever will put your name confess it from your mouth conscience is released and now the word Mia oh Church yeah this is the key church he says when I make by faith my Confessions by his stripes Caleb paris's heels versus Caleb Pettis is restored caliper is perfected is perfect releasing my conscience to these things watch what he says here I think he said okay and when I release it that's scripture becomes alive to me that's why the message seems dead to a lot of people foreign hey what a thing that is though to wash one another's feet on your family's feet when you begin to unite on another level it's not Palace that unites the baddest family a lot of Jesus Christ to unite his family gotta throw away all this nonsense sometimes yeah in a church yeah I understand God uses families don't get me wrong for a specific purpose that don't make me any better than any of you must be better or higher because I'm the pastor and nada come on Church they don't make me any better than you well you didn't like that or what no let's go Stone we always like to elevate people right and then something goes wrong and then it's like I thought I believed you can go to hell believing in the mess you by Revelation who the man is that has placed the man in the office don't ever try to make brother Caleb something that he's not we don't believe in all this junk that goes around eight Messengers and 15th Messengers there is a respect yes respect the man that's there too I understand that remember when it's all said and done the body of Christ I'm gonna tell you what I believe something else we can do away with a man and have enough entrance what happens and then sometimes somebody in the church do you have a little authority over someone no no this is what I've stood foreign amen we're gonna clean a little house there's a bunch of nonsense that goes on in the church we will fulfill that adoption I completely you want to be part of it I welcome you into the mystery The Fellowship of the mystery oh my barely getting going so don't try to stop you need to leave God bless you there's there's the door but we were after something this morning do you love me I love you too and I wouldn't talk like this if I didn't enough but it's time we release so many ideas you ready for the next part yeah watch this I mentioned something in the panel on Thursdays [Music] and I want to reiterate this because it's very helpful listen closely okay and it will help you so I talked about that remember that the man that was given a book of brother Branham I don't want this no more this band all he called me was a buzzard or Crow or whatever the man was like oh he calls me is an eagle everywhere I read what's the difference one man one man's conscience was released to the message and the other one hadn't been released we're gonna go listen closely because this is gonna this is gonna snowball now watch this now watch the releasing of the conscience how do you find God's perfect will in your life are you waiting for the aha moment the Revelation is an aha moment but but let's find out how this aha moment comes God's will in your life is a mystery and without the mystery we cannot be a true worshiper I'm not all here because that's what our desire is a true worshipers watch this you worship you know not what acts 17 we're going to go to this scripture and then we'll we'll see as this as this unfolds now this is Paul verse 22 he's standing on Mars Hill he's telling that you're too superstitious way a lot of people see the Rapture very superstitious driving in my car you're too superstitious your conscience has been released to a denominational idea denominational Church get this message today hear it again this is where the Lord is going to come and bring it all together I passed verse 23. as I pass by and I beheld your devotions oh I love the Lord I love the message I love oh we got to bring it to us right and amidst all your devotions I found an altar in control what is the altar okay come on what is the altar your heart I found a heart and in this inscriptions to the unknown God I see a lot of Hearts today wherever I go and it's got that inscription to the unknown God you don't automatically know him just because you go to church not even Cedar Hills but I believe in Cedar Hills and Cedar Hills there's a portal portal and you have it in your heart to the unknown God because if you're not in the body you can even worship him therefore ye ignorantly worship raising your hands but if you're not in the body it doesn't receive the worship you have a form of godliness why because you don't spend your time trying to get to know the grooms oh my my entire neighbor neighbor we're in for good and right now what a ride we're going on come on now this is why we don't do it we ignorantly worship but Paul says I declare it unto you I'm going to declare to you the mystery El Mysterio okay come on now Revelations 10 7 and 8. Holy Ghost is putting it together for you today that's all read it together but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared it to his servants the prophets how many believe that well I don't believe that's brother Branham your conscience hasn't been released I don't believe that's him your conscience hasn't been released simply that's right that's right so since you got a good idea who is it got a better idea than God what's your idea let me see yeah what you have released your conscience too well in YouTube and YouTube this man said this is you would be that's right oh if I've ever felt the presence of the Lord it's right now let him come and have total control of his service it's right now oh so much as he walking through the through this through this church right now whatever you would ask for it is all right yes anybody want receiving anything okay we'll stand to your feet for a moment whatever you're asking for looks for a moment your feet how do you say in Jesus name it's here to meet you he wants a release of the conscience release your conscience to him days of the voice of the seventh Angels he would begin to sound the mystery of God will be finished and Christ is the mystery of God reveals when you come into his body you're coming into the mystery of the fellowships you may be seated you just believe it put your my hands on you all the time that's okay there's time for that church there's time for all this that's okay there are people that need that grow a little bit every time you came through those doors that's real perfect worship and the voice which I heard from heaven instead go and take the little book yes which is open in the hand of the Angels but the problem is we want to just release our conscience to certain things I don't want to release my conscience we have a message that's what we were doing on Thursday was bringing a balance there's a balancing there is a Ministry of tapes to take the tapes my conscience is just released to that portion still I'm Gonna Miss This other portion of the books I want it open to all the messages are you are you getting it this morning do I have to go another route Christ is the anointed word of the hour and it should never be to the unknown God anymore was the seventh angel just revealing the mystery of marriage and divorce Mysterio was the seventh angel just revealing the mystery of the blindness of Israel sure those Mysteries were revealed but let me ask you this question people might ask why we have a picture just because we believe he's a prophet no no because he is a Vindicated prophet and the same Jesus Jesus that came forth which was the very Tabernacle of God he went back to his original condition or his original which was the pillar of fire that's foreign come on Church don't you see the same one no es el mismo or are you blind come on now same light that miss my Luke he had gone back into um who are you Lord I am Jesus your conscience to the revelation of the words came to bring a message from God that would reveal the very mystery as well yes he brought all those things but without releasing your conscience all we become is a bunch of theologians in the message and a theologian cannot give life to anyone oh we we know a lot huh we're going to be responsible for Allah conscience is released when my conscience is released the whole message I can't help but give lives it's okay to become a theologian as well but answer the mystery first Mysterio primero I can't help if it makes you can talk to anyone and say they say well this and this yeah but what about this and this message but before I do that make sure that I'm a son make sure that you're a dog you got to make sure you're a doctor and that you have come into the fellowship yes or yes and then if you want to become a theologian go for it a son and daughter of God first where do I find the answer to the mystery where do you find the answer to the Mysteries come on I'm locked on right now I'm in my Jet right now and I'm locked on wow come on somebody help him again I'll let you answer where do you find and find out what his will is we gotta get this church if I take three hours that's okay right I don't care today we're this is the end this is the end of the of of our eight day Services God tell us at the end what he wants to tell us get us in line for what's coming get in line for the coming of the Lord stop all this nonsense that goes on where do I find the mystery in the scriptures and that's why when you come to me and say brother can you help me I don't know what my purpose is you haven't been married well we're gonna get to something good right now you haven't been eating all the book use this key now they believe that you're a part of the lord of the Bride of Jesus Christ how many of you believe that you are part then you came from the groom which is the word how many believe that the Bible is palabra okay if your conscience hasn't been open to it you don't know come on now this will change your lives and people this will change your lives get this key and use it then if you are part of the Bride you must find yourself in the grooms this the message of the hour foreign because in the days of the voice of the seventh angel he would begin to sell the Mysteries you were part of him and your mystery amen yes or yes okay you're part of the groom I think we got that down it's the same problem with couples we don't spend time studying the word or the groomers young couples don't spend time studying each other foreign let me do it for you I know you want to do that but you're you're ashamed we don't spend time studying each other I want to tell you something your groom so Novia loves you so much I don't know if you believe me your groom so nobio how many are the part of the bride of Christ groom loves you so much that he studies you every day your groom loves you so much come down and become one of us so that he could better understand us oh come on if that don't make you feel important nothing will you know assistant is important let me see how they do how they dressed in wow look at them studying my word oh and he just says shakes his head and said um that's my bride came down from glory to Justin Darius and yet we don't give him the same back come on now don't don't let me lose you we're in the middle of it right now you don't do the same thing love him the same way I want to know everything about my life whoa look at this The Mystery of the fellowship Fellowship of the mystery is what my groom says okay watch watch where we're going with this now this is good good stuff it was Bueno we know the church no we know the church we know everybody in the church yeah because everybody most I shouldn't say everybody but a lot of people don't redeem the time the media helps you study the Grooms everybody's dirty laundry right and the groom is like I love your star really they wear us I gave my life for you and you release your conscience you release your altar and make it a filthy altario and the tables the Bible says are full of vomits but we're studying I don't think so no Creo is it wrong to do this oh I love the way our founding Pastor asked that is wrong he said to go to Disneyland yes and those that love Disney hope yes like if Disney saved you or something but then he comes and brings a balance he said but he said answer the sin question there's nothing wrong with it because it's not the Disneyland that brings joy to you it is almighty God that comes in the power of His words they say is it wrong to play basketball yes it is CCS I know you like it that it sites on you right now play basketball yesterday unless you've answered the symbols those spirits that atmosphere will suck you in it won't ask for permission nothing wrong with doing these things nothing can take you away [Music] all right you get friends out there and all the Amigos oh they'll make you love things out there my question now I'm gonna flip it on you did you get him to love the Lord that's the question hello everybody I like this we're not even close to being done right now foreign we know Church we know religion failures we know what everyone's doing but ask them about the groom um exactly exacto and you love someone so much you didn't even care what anybody says or things I fell in love with my wife and I was like yeah okay whatever right right come on yeah why don't we fall in love with God watch this now when I read the scriptures I read the message I'm finding out answers to my Mysteries there are those that read the message to find mistakes when they tell me that the message is wrong I say impossible worry come on let's challenge him today the message is wrong and I found the answer is what he was sent to do for the faith to return us back and who we originally are hello don't make it complicated what he came to do you know why silent okay because one day years ago I released my country I released it to Malachi foreign and when you answer the same questions release your conscience to every word you remember now when I was talking about this I have a quote wonderful hermoso but you better have more than a quote the conscience to the whole message we have released and I ask you what have you released your conscience to this you want to find errors in the church and and here's a here's the news flash humans in here we make mistakes but please look at each other through the blood talk about the church to anyone else at least your conscience to those things like that amen you want me to stop I'll stop I'm officially halfway through now I'm going to put this in a way let me put it like this in a church yeah for a while you get a lot of ministers and sometimes the minister is waiting for the next time he gets to preachers They Don't Preach for a while I like the way things are going in that church Iglesia something's wrong you're not a preacher or Minister because you get behind this sacred dance your number one thing is that the minister is to take the gospel around the world yeah my brother told me it says brother hermano I believe brother Branham says that the United States needs more missionaries than anyone else and so I'm now I don't care about going anywhere else I only want to preach to my neighbors and anyone I come in contact and I said God bless you for that brother if that's what his conscience was released but I said but if he called you to testify to your neighbor and to go around the world don't knock somebody that goes to another country what's the balance now it's easy to get one thing and say oh yeah but we don't need this we just need the missionaries right yeah we do it's possible we should all be missionaries don't throw at somebody that goes somewhere where God's pulling him to a punch line at the end well I I'm only a housewife brother might result that you would put the word only in front of that no such thing as only a housewife no I'm not only a stay-at-home moment no I dip my hats to you Sombrero to a mama that will teach your children my question is sisters Hermanas that are Housewives de casa do you find joy in it oh here we go come on I'm bringing it right to you do you find joy in that hey because if you did if you don't find Joy I found your place you're not in the mystery or The Fellowship of the Mysteries you should have so much joy foreign he gave some let's read it again Ephesians four if he's 11 and 12. we read this so many times I know you're tired I can feel your sluggishness now over what but man this is too much I'm putting this because it goes out too yes yes go back and hear it again find yourself have slept through part of it is okay brother James stand up all right my brother read it what what [Music] give him somebody somebody get him a little get a microphone or something here we go again come on now and he gave some Apostles okay okay now how did I teach you to read that meal and some he gave me some ah ah you're getting it you want me now read it again and he gave me Apostles no no no not just me I want you to put your name it's personal there okay he gave James Apostles uh-huh and what else and he gave James prophets oh I like it he's continuing it keep on going come on and he gave James evangelist oh yeah somebody got a shout right it's right about now come on church and keep on going and he gave James pastors oh and then he gave James teachers oh I like that give one to the Lord Jesus for that are you getting the key are you getting the key now every time you read that and the eunuch says and the Anthony said Philip says do you understand what you read how can I unless some man Teach me yeah well some man's about to teach you because he gave the unit and the eunuch put his name who is this man talking about Jesus but who is it foreign foreign Publix del Cielo and he looks for eign it's not because we go and preach the gospel around the world just because we do that a lot of people go around the gospel you know what I released well I only believe in in handing out bibles if you're reading the word and that part of the word speaks out to you do something about it release your conscience to that part of the word Place yourself in the groom when I read it one day go into all the world and preach the gospel I release my conscience and that's all I can do now yes whether somebody believes me or not I don't it doesn't matter oh Church watch this now this is this is something tremendous First Corinthians 10 29. conscience constiencia come on I'm finishing now I won't keep you long as let's see when I tell you I'm finishing then you guys are like oh okay here we go I saw something you're like you're right and your eyes were fluttering like yeah and some of you are like emotions I'm getting ready to finish foreign but I still gotta tell you if First Corinthians 10 29. well they should do what we do oh throw it in the garbage well I do this does it matter you're tooting your own horn well I made food for everybody on a bozo badge or what we're getting some nice badge food for everybody everybody in church ah look what I do get off it oh we went to Africa okay here's my here's our founding Pastor all right that's our founding passage we did all this and yes no my conscience was released but if I ever think that I did anything us here in the church is about the testimony of Jesus Christ if I ever portrayed anything wrong God forgive me forgive your dumb servant Lord they would ever try to put somebody's eyes on me enough is enough of that nonsense conscience I say not thine for why is my Liberty my freedom to do what God's called me to do why is my Liberty judged of another man's conscience yeah well I hear tapes and everybody should do that if God calls you to do they do that that you got to answer for that but don't try to dictate my country of what God has called me today what I have released my conscience to the world read the word read the word you want Deliverance when the anointing comes when he the groom comes to you begin to reveal himself to you yes oh I feel this oh yes I felt a joy when I went and I did and I preached and I did this for the Lord why'd you stop doing it because you had to work more to make more money never have more things wow wow and you have less Joy than you did when you had nothing to serve the Lord where have we've gotten so comfortable but there's no joy nothing anymore that's right you know when a new car becomes old can you make your first payment the first month is I don't know why I bought this thing oh my can I can I just have like five ten minutes

one another religious Spirits when you sleep in church yeah like you never have they're always alert I'm sorry I get off on these things just reality it's the realities of things that we go through yes send it on high he gave gifts unto men now I say this and I'm going to close with this don't let your conscience be dictated because if I say everybody here we need to start speaking in tongues new doctrine in the church we're going to come you're going to have some classes everybody's learning how to speak in tongues what a bunch of nonsense are all apostles we all have the same gifts and why are we judging someone else's conscience it's up to them to release the conscience is part of the word the groom is saying fit right here baby I'm trying to be this I think I'm a great servant I'm gonna do this or that and we're trying to fit in the group okay when the mold is there oh I fit please I get it my Mysteries now unfolded I'm releasing my conscience and I'm releasing everything else we have no plan B let's see now First Corinthians 12 3 and I'm closing with this maybe let me see one foreign First Corinthians 12 8.1 is given by the spirit the word of wisdom is Lord is this it come
