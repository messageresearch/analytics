[35:27] and you know we we know that the prophet
[35:30] of God speaks about the the challenge of
[35:33] the day
[35:36] and he speaks to us about the challenge
[35:39] of the hour
[35:41] and we know that that there are
[35:44] scripturally and and knowing this the
[35:46] Bible the message of the hour yes
[35:53] there are three great showdowns I I Tres
[35:56] Grande and so
[35:58] we we don't want to take too much uh uh
[36:02] of going into into a lot of detail no
[36:06] queremos
[36:08] but we want to go into what what is uh
[36:11] our our portion tonight
[36:13] how many have been enjoying now all the
[36:16] panels
[36:17] and I I we've been enjoying it I think
[36:20] to to be able to to speak with you
[36:25] I want everyone to understand one thing
[36:28] tonight
[36:31] we only have one message
[36:36] we have one
[36:38] messengero and and his name is William
[36:40] Miriam Branham is William Marion we
[36:43] don't have a message or or or uh
[36:46] anything without him
[36:50] but we do understand that what the
[36:53] message produces
[36:56] and the message is required to produce a
[36:59] certain things
[37:01] we are then proud of products or
[37:04] manifestation of what the message is
[37:13] the 48th Psalm uh Salmo it reads like
[37:19] this and this is to start off the Mount
[37:22] Zion Showdown
[37:25] how many know what a Slowdown is one two
[37:28] seven
[37:33] if you come to church because to be
[37:36] happy
[37:39] solo to have no problems
[37:46] if you've accepted the message of the
[37:49] hour
[37:50] so you could kick back
[37:54] you've you've you've you've joined
[37:56] yourself to the wrong thing
[37:59] but if you've come for the purpose of
[38:02] understanding him
[38:05] and
[38:06] to know what he he has given us which is
[38:11] the responsibility of his word
[38:16] then it does bring us to a showdown in
[38:19] pontes
[38:21] but I like the uh once we we read the
[38:26] scripture we'll we'll we'll tell you
[38:28] about before there's a showdown there's
[38:30] got to be a show up uh
[38:37] uh Psalms 48 says this is
[38:42] great is the Lord
[38:51] and greatly to be praised
[38:56] this is Wednesday
[38:58] and so I know that that sometimes we're
[39:01] a little we're little little
[39:02] lackadaisical or tired on Wednesdays
[39:07] but great is the Lord
[39:10] [Music]
[39:12] now your neighbor great is the Lord
[39:15] greatly to be praised
[39:19] City above our God
[39:22] in the mountain of his Holiness
[39:26] beautiful for situation Hermosa
[39:30] Provincia the joy of the whole earth is
[39:34] Mount Zion is on the sides of the north
[39:39] the city of the great king
[39:42] now there is we've we've understood by
[39:46] the scripture
[39:48] and understood uh Brethren
[39:53] Germans how many showdowns
[39:56] tell me which ones they are dressed
[40:03] uh there's Mount Carmel Showdown
[40:05] Caramelo
[40:07] there is uh
[40:12] and the third one Mount Zion Showdown
[40:17] and that's where we find ourselves at
[40:19] today yeah
[40:21] brother brother brother Seth tell us
[40:25] what happened at at
[40:27] carmelon El Monte Carmelo well there's a
[40:30] lot of interesting things that happened
[40:33] at Mount Carmel this is the reason why
[40:35] we're talking about because it's it's
[40:37] actually a continuation of the same
[40:39] Showdown is
[40:45] to further explain the Mount Zion let's
[40:48] go to Mount Carmel all right
[40:50] the gentleman upstairs
[40:53] Carmelo sorry brother Jim if the
[40:55] gentleman upstairs would uh put the
[40:57] picture or the map of the location of
[41:00] Israel mapa
[41:05] yeah let's try to try a different one
[41:08] almost
[41:10] you can see on this tip to the left kind
[41:13] of where it makes a point
[41:15] there's Mount Carmel ah yes that montage
[41:19] and it's on the edge of the
[41:20] Mediterranean Sea is
[41:24] and rather than just being a single
[41:27] Mountain
[41:30] Mount Carmel is actually a high wooded
[41:33] Mountain Ridge is is
[41:41] located by the Mediterranean Sea and the
[41:43] City of Haifa location
[41:49] and the word caramel in Hebrew is
[41:54] Vineyard
[41:57] Orchard or garden of God
[42:02] and reflects the fertile beauty of the
[42:05] mount carmel's pitch picturesque slopes
[42:17] and you can see Mount Carmel right there
[42:23] so Mount Carmel is also known in Arabic
[42:26] Elias
[42:32] Mount Mar Elias
[42:36] which is translated Mount Saint Elisha
[42:40] or Elijah
[42:43] so this is Mount
[42:45] Carmelo Egyptian records note that it
[42:49] was a holy
[42:51] mountains
[42:54] a high place that was a center of idol
[42:58] worship
[43:02] so here you find okay allowing
[43:10] um going outside of his people and
[43:13] marrying a idol worshiper foreign
[43:19] how he married Jezebel and brought in
[43:22] the the pagan gods of Baal and asherah
[43:31] and and for this
[43:33] that Bale was the actual D favorite
[43:37] deity of Jezebel uh
[43:41] who they claim was the god of rain and
[43:44] vegetation
[43:46] and fertility
[43:49] but our God is a jealous God
[43:53] Thou shalt have no other gods before me
[43:59] and God calls for a three-year drought
[44:02] through Elijah
[44:06] so just real quick think about that they
[44:09] thought
[44:10] they worshiped the god of Baal
[44:13] who they thought brought them Reign and
[44:15] all this Prosperity
[44:19] but they didn't realize that God is the
[44:22] one that created the heavens
[44:26] so it took that man Elijah to go up and
[44:30] gather the prophets to the top of Mount
[44:33] Carmel
[44:34] wanted
[44:38] so like you said that
[44:41] he showed up
[44:45] Elijah and our day showed up
[44:49] and he told Ahab
[44:52] you've heard the story
[44:55] call ye on the name of your gods
[44:59] foreign
[45:39] and so it came to pass
[45:43] that it came for The Showdown
[45:46] and it came to pass at the time of
[45:50] offering
[45:53] that the prophets of Baal
[45:56] another opportunity to to worship their
[45:59] God
[46:00] opportunity
[46:02] he was right
[46:06] that he was their God okay
[46:09] so Elijah gave him all day
[46:13] and even mocked them
[46:17] but it came to pass at the time of the
[46:19] offering
[46:23] it was Elijah's turn yeah
[46:26] it came in the evening time
[46:31] anybody know about the evening time
[46:33] message
[46:35] there shall be lied about the evening
[46:38] time
[46:40] so no coincidences in the evening
[46:47] that Spirit of Elijah is so amazing
[46:52] because he was sent to turn the hearts
[46:58] destination of Israel
[47:01] back to the Lord
[47:05] in that evening time
[47:07] even so today in our times
[47:15] was able to turn our hearts back
[47:20] to the Lord Jesus Christ
[47:24] so what I find was very amazing pop look
[47:30] this place of Mount Carmel
[47:33] Carmelo was an idol worship place
[47:37] and they try to put their altars on it
[47:42] but Elijah actually went up
[48:10] to bring them back
[48:12] bring their hearts back to God
[48:15] it's a very very important important
[48:18] point tonight
[48:20] you know that God does does or or the
[48:24] Jewish people
[48:26] when you find out what they do they do
[48:29] it together
[48:32] individuals everybody has everybody in
[48:36] America we're all individuals of what we
[48:39] possess in America
[48:41] whatever they have they have it together
[48:43] in a tribe
[48:46] that's why they always have a lineage
[48:49] that's why they always say this he was
[48:52] the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[48:55] and they can go back and back and back
[48:57] and forth into their tribal order
[49:02] because they don't view themselves as a
[49:04] personal
[49:07] they identify themselves in their tribe
[49:10] that they belong to
[49:13] in the nation which they belong to
[49:16] Inland
[49:17] that's why they're called the people of
[49:19] God is
[49:21] that's right
[49:24] and so it's the same in our day
[49:27] you see Jezebel types the Catholic
[49:30] Church
[49:32] the mother of Harlot
[49:35] and how she caused all these
[49:50] and even worse
[49:55] trying to cause the children of Israel
[49:59] or the true church or like even our
[50:03] nation
[50:04] as Ahab types the president United
[50:07] States
[50:10] of the Pagan worship
[50:15] how many prophets did did was was that
[50:19] this scene of the of this of this
[50:21] showdown
[50:24] remember we even though there's three
[50:26] showdowns it's one continuous Showdown
[50:32] we never want to lose fat
[50:35] of it that it continues
[50:39] how many prophets
[50:41] were there my knowledge is for about 400
[50:45] prophets
[50:47] does anybody have a story of uh or a
[50:50] testimony of did that happen in our time
[50:53] Argentina
[50:55] no
[51:19] that was in Chicago wasn't it is it when
[51:22] Chicago that that is a showdown you know
[51:26] every time that you go and do something
[51:28] for the Lord there's a showdown
[51:30] somebody I'm going to be happy for you
[51:33] to do what you do for the Lord
[51:36] ladies uh sisters you wear a dress
[51:41] and you go you go to the store
[51:44] there's a showdown
[51:46] man you go and you act differently
[51:50] there's a showdown you don't cut your
[51:53] hair ladies
[51:55] there's a showdown you believe what you
[51:58] believe
[51:59] there's a showdown
[52:02] every time somebody gotta stand up in
[52:06] our generation
[52:08] the challenge of the day
[52:11] you know you know you you if if our
[52:15] lives don't pattern of what we're
[52:17] supposed to do
[52:42] but I have come Jesus says that you
[52:45] might have life
[52:48] and that more abundantly
[52:51] every day what you believe comes down to
[52:54] a showdown
[52:57] even in your own members it comes to a
[53:01] showdowns and your body at times will
[53:05] Rebel according against what you
[53:09] actually believe is
[53:13] but this is where this is where we're
[53:15] all at
[53:16] the in the in The Showdown
[53:19] so finally up or finalizing The Showdown
[53:23] there had to be something in Elijah that
[53:26] just irked him about these false gods
[53:31] is
[53:33] kind of like the way the Goliath called
[53:36] out the children of Israel
[53:41] something that's that David couldn't
[53:44] stomach yeah no support So Elijah's turn
[53:50] he's calling on the Lord God of Abraham
[53:53] Isaac and Jacob
[53:55] and he's telling them to let it be known
[53:58] the day that you that he is the god in
[54:00] Israel
[54:03] and as he's proclaiming this
[54:06] the Lord comes down in a consuming fire
[54:11] and picked up the sacrifice water and
[54:14] rocks
[54:17] the Lord himself showed up
[54:21] and the people fell on their faces
[54:24] saying that the Lord foreign
[54:32] so I want you to know take this last
[54:35] part of The Showdown
[54:38] everyone knew who was God
[54:42] because of who who showed up and
[54:48] through the showdowns you have Elijah
[54:52] you have God but
[54:56] Elijah remembered the Mosaic law
[55:01] and the reason I say that because when
[55:03] we get to Mount Transfiguration you see
[55:05] Moses
[55:09] we remember that in Deuteronomy
[55:12] Deuteronomy 13 chapter one
[55:17] he had to bring Moses on the scene
[55:21] you see just because God showed up
[55:26] didn't show up
[55:29] you still have the false prophets that
[55:31] are there alive
[55:35] Deuteronomy tells us
[55:37] if there arise among you a prophet
[55:41] suenos
[55:46] and then he says let's go after other
[55:48] gods and serve them
[55:51] the law says let him be put to death
[55:56] that's very important in our life
[56:00] because many times God shows up
[56:03] and we can't go and kill
[56:48] what a tremendous picture brother bro
[56:51] and and a tremendous testimony brother
[56:54] Seth just got through telling us
[56:57] do you have to add to to our to our
[57:00] showdowns so
[57:04] much
[57:06] give a little background we're talking
[57:08] about um
[57:15] and after a while we're gonna go into
[57:17] the difference between the Z and the S
[57:19] right this is
[57:22] it gets really really really nice
[57:26] I was talking to brother Seth upstairs
[57:28] and uh
[57:31] I was uh mentioning to him that I read
[57:33] yesterday that the word Zion in Hebrew
[57:35] and I mentioned I said
[57:38] is actually used as a feminine term is
[57:43] I think that's very important to
[57:45] remember here
[57:48] so we know that God works in threes
[57:52] uh we're talking about uh we mentioned
[57:55] the three showdowns
[57:57] and I want to speak about three
[57:59] different seeds
[58:01] now if you guys can quickly return to
[58:04] your Bibles in Galatians 3 16. do we
[58:07] have any pictures
[58:10] this is this is going to be this is
[58:13] going to be really good here
[58:17] now to Abraham and his seed were the
[58:19] promises made
[58:21] he saith not and to seeds as of many but
[58:25] as of one and to thy seed which is
[58:27] Christ
[58:29] is Christo
[58:42] and you guys don't have to turn to it
[58:44] but I'm just going to read it real
[58:45] quickly Genesis 1 11.
[58:49] and God said let the Earth bring forth
[58:51] grass the herb yielding seed and the
[58:53] fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind
[58:55] okay seed in itself upon the Earth and
[58:58] it was so conformation
[59:11] now uh I wanted to start with the quoted
[59:13] brother Branham here
[59:16] and if the guys can get the pictures
[59:18] ready
[59:21] now there has been three different kind
[59:23] of seeds planted
[59:27] we have a denominational seat
[59:32] is
[59:34] Oral Roberts Oral Roberts
[59:39] there's Billy Graham there's Billy Brown
[59:41] Billy Graham nominational seat Billy
[59:43] Graham
[59:44] Billy Graham my brother Brown calls him
[59:46] the head planter
[59:52] next Oral Roberts for the Pentecostal
[59:54] organization
[59:58] it wasn't a Pentecostal seed it was a
[1:00:01] Pentecostal organizations
[1:00:08] Pentecost is not a movement
[1:00:17] thank you
[1:00:18] and then the third C that was planted
[1:00:22] we all should know who this is
[1:00:25] anybody know who this is
[1:00:28] The Showdown
[1:00:32] so the word seed has been planted
[1:00:34] plantara
[1:00:37] now
[1:00:39] I was going to ask kind of the seed but
[1:00:40] everyone should know who painted the
[1:00:41] seed between the Malachi four or five
[1:00:43] right
[1:00:46] so the spirit of Elijah anointing a man
[1:00:48] from Kentucky named William Marion
[1:00:50] Branham
[1:00:53] now the seeds have already been planted
[1:00:57] the denominational seat of the churches
[1:01:05] we got the Pentecostal seeds
[1:01:08] the Pentecostal organizations
[1:01:13] [Music]
[1:01:15] Tommy Hicks Oral Roberts and brother
[1:01:17] Brown says they're all great men of God
[1:01:20] where he says I believe the word of God
[1:01:23] has been planted
[1:01:27] and there's a key word here
[1:01:29] this is unadulterated
[1:01:33] away from any of those organizations
[1:01:37] we had the three preseason we know that
[1:01:40] Christ is the word
[1:01:41] seeds
[1:01:44] now you guys might be thinking well what
[1:01:46] does this have to do with The Showdown
[1:01:49] tell us we got we got three seeds that
[1:01:52] were planted right yes
[1:01:54] everything to do with it these three
[1:01:57] seeds that were planted they're all
[1:01:58] growing together
[1:02:02] we all believe that we're about in The
[1:02:04] Harvest Time
[1:02:07] and every seed that is planted is coming
[1:02:09] to a showdown or a show up
[1:02:17] now each one of these seeds
[1:02:20] believes that they're a bride
[1:02:23] you asked the Pentecostal organization
[1:02:26] they believe that they're right
[1:02:28] organizations
[1:02:37] and they believe sincerely that they're
[1:02:40] bright
[1:02:41] they're good people is
[1:02:44] now they all might be Brides
[1:02:47] it might be a church pride in English a
[1:02:51] religious
[1:02:53] but there is only one word
[1:02:57] now these three seeds might look similar
[1:03:00] as they're growing yeah it gets you
[1:03:02] excited tonight
[1:03:06] but until the point where they start to
[1:03:08] bloom and show what life was inside of
[1:03:10] them from the very beginning
[1:03:16] now at that point is when we come to The
[1:03:18] Showdown
[1:03:20] so if these three seeds are believed to
[1:03:23] be bright
[1:03:25] what actually separates the bride from
[1:03:29] the other groups
[1:03:34] and brother Tommy asked us this question
[1:03:36] the other day
[1:03:39] to be honest I was stuck yeah
[1:03:44] it's more digging and I called our
[1:03:46] pastor yes
[1:03:48] and the Lord just opened it up
[1:03:53] now it comes down to one thing
[1:03:56] that is by God's foreign
[1:04:05] now these religious Brides
[1:04:08] novias really shows us
[1:04:11] if they were the bride see what an
[1:04:13] anovia God would have to judge the World
[1:04:15] by what they believed by what the church
[1:04:17] is
[1:04:20] but we know that God will judge the
[1:04:22] World by Christ's word
[1:04:26] now here we have the groom
[1:04:29] Jesus Christ the word
[1:04:31] and we have the bridegroom yeah
[1:04:35] what separates her is she recognizes
[1:04:38] what part of the word she is
[1:04:45] she is the very fulfillment of Malachi 4
[1:04:49] 5 and 6.
[1:04:51] he says
[1:04:53] here now remember
[1:04:56] every spoken word of God is the original
[1:04:58] seeds
[1:05:01] God handed everything in the Earth by
[1:05:03] his word
[1:05:06] and as long as you stay with the
[1:05:09] original seeds
[1:05:12] now listen here you can see mue
[1:05:43] uh-huh
[1:05:45] so there you see
[1:05:47] the reproduction of the Original Seed
[1:05:50] production
[1:05:51] which is the bride that has made herself
[1:05:54] ready
[1:05:56] and how has she made herself ready
[1:05:59] and he gave some Apostles
[1:06:04] from evangelists and teachers
[1:06:12] man
[1:06:14] that that's also a showdown
[1:06:17] and that's the that's the whole the
[1:06:20] whole the whole thing is where we're you
[1:06:22] know you know when you and I've said
[1:06:24] this maybe time and time again but but
[1:06:26] sometimes you get something different
[1:06:29] sometimes
[1:06:31] but if you there's a song that says that
[1:06:34] if you've never had a problem
[1:06:39] you would never know that God could
[1:06:41] solve them
[1:06:44] man you do know what I'm talking about
[1:06:47] right
[1:06:48] we're all humans we all have problems
[1:06:50] you've never had a problem
[1:06:53] you never know that God could solve them
[1:06:57] how how was David ever revealed David
[1:07:04] was revealed by his problem
[1:07:09] which was the giante
[1:07:13] only your problem will D will will
[1:07:17] reveal who you are
[1:07:19] that's why we give God thanks for for
[1:07:22] the problem for the trials
[1:07:25] the Bible speaks so that there are more
[1:07:28] precious than gold tried in the fires
[1:07:33] because they reveal who you are
[1:07:36] well you have plenty of money in the
[1:07:39] bank
[1:07:40] car is brand new
[1:07:44] everything well works fine
[1:07:47] you love the Lord you raise your hands
[1:07:51] there's no problem
[1:07:55] Only The Showdown and only the giant
[1:07:58] coming into your Valley
[1:08:02] will make the King show up and reveal
[1:08:06] who actually David was
[1:08:10] brother Henry
[1:08:14] here you come a a a a a king and
[1:08:20] um and he comes and he he wants to take
[1:08:23] a take a hold of this this city
[1:08:27] which is which was which was part of it
[1:08:30] was Mount Zion
[1:08:34] and Mount Mount Zion montession is a is
[1:08:38] a is a is a mountain it's
[1:08:41] a people it's a place it's a condition
[1:08:47] is the nation it's a nation
[1:08:49] and brother Branham says
[1:08:56] speaking of Zion and I believe that the
[1:08:59] church today
[1:09:00] only in its conditions
[1:09:03] it's only a place that God's bringing
[1:09:06] the church that when it all breaks
[1:09:12] what a time of rejoicing
[1:09:14] when the redeem stands someday to Crown
[1:09:18] Jesus
[1:09:19] [Music]
[1:09:20] king of King and Lord of lords
[1:09:24] when he's sitting on Mount Zion
[1:09:29] and all around the earth
[1:09:34] with the redeemed singing Redemption
[1:09:40] angels will stand off on the sideline
[1:09:44] is
[1:09:51] extend Zion to the whole earth
[1:09:56] so Zion
[1:10:00] is a confusing thing what was that is
[1:10:03] that confusing confusing thing
[1:10:05] the scripture tells us it's a confusing
[1:10:09] thing
[1:10:10] we're talking about it but is it please
[1:10:22] well it is confusing
[1:10:25] and the scripture tells us that is
[1:10:30] confusing is
[1:10:33] let's go to to the other Showdown
[1:10:39] are you talking about Mount Zion that's
[1:10:41] the mountain in the north of London
[1:10:44] so the most uh if you can pull the map
[1:10:47] back up
[1:10:49] the most northern mountain
[1:10:53] is called Mount Hermon Del Monte at the
[1:10:57] northern border of Israel
[1:11:01] you see in Christian tradition in the
[1:11:04] tradition Christiana they say that the
[1:11:07] mount Transfiguration Showdown is
[1:11:16] and I bring that up because
[1:11:19] they say Christian tradition
[1:11:23] which to me is Catholic church
[1:11:27] with an elevation of roughly 1800 feet
[1:11:33] but the scripture says
[1:11:37] he took them to an exceeding high
[1:11:40] mountain
[1:11:43] 2000 feet is not very high Los milpies
[1:11:47] ten thousand ten thousand Millions you
[1:11:51] got a mountain right yes there's a
[1:11:53] picture we have of Mount uh let's go to
[1:11:57] Mount Tabor almost
[1:12:00] and you can see the city on the left
[1:12:03] yeah it's a it looks more like a hill
[1:12:05] but it's a communal Loma I couldn't go
[1:12:07] to the next picture
[1:12:12] uh go to the next one that's my table
[1:12:14] still hey
[1:12:19] you have another one sorry guys I didn't
[1:12:21] guess the label it
[1:12:24] I'll keep speaking all right
[1:12:29] picture of Mount Hermon look you have
[1:12:32] the picture with the snowy snow snow cap
[1:12:33] of Mount Hermon brother Genesis
[1:12:36] there we go
[1:12:38] you see the little city on the bottom
[1:12:41] unless you that uh
[1:12:44] yes sir yes sir
[1:12:46] [Laughter]
[1:12:49] get me all excited Hallelujah Mount
[1:12:53] Hermon ten thousand feet
[1:12:56] that's the exceeding high mountain
[1:13:01] means the sacred Mountain
[1:13:04] you can see that it's very snowy up
[1:13:07] there
[1:13:09] it brought a lot of dude
[1:13:13] because as Jesus brought
[1:13:16] Peter James and John up there
[1:13:21] he took them by themselves
[1:13:23] and was transfigured in front of them
[1:13:28] and appeared then appeared Moses and
[1:13:31] Elijah
[1:13:34] so in Mount carmelon
[1:13:37] God above us then is
[1:13:51] you see both Moses and Elijah
[1:13:54] it's important to have both of them
[1:13:59] they were the with Christ with Christ
[1:14:02] with them
[1:14:05] they were the three Heavenly witnesses
[1:14:10] there with the three early Witnesses
[1:14:15] you have faith hope and love
[1:14:20] did you know that that's over here that
[1:14:23] Moses been in that mountain
[1:14:26] talk to me talk to me but not not on the
[1:14:29] top of the mountain so
[1:14:33] he got my attention here
[1:14:36] we speak of Mount Zion
[1:14:39] and it's spelled the iron he says
[1:14:44] but the first time that is even
[1:14:46] mentioned is actually spelled s-i-o-n
[1:14:49] pero La primes
[1:14:51] in the book of uh Deuteronomy
[1:14:55] 448
[1:14:57] given the directions of the land
[1:15:01] it says from Aurora which is by the bank
[1:15:04] of the river Arnon Del Rio
[1:15:08] even onto Mount Zion which is Hermann
[1:15:10] hasta Del montecione so the first time
[1:15:13] that we
[1:15:15] find sign in the Bible it is he
[1:15:18] identifies it as Mount Hermon La
[1:15:20] primervesque
[1:15:22] says
[1:15:25] David speaks a lot of Zion and praises
[1:15:28] the lore about this mountains
[1:15:32] [Music]
[1:15:33] because it is known and brother Brian
[1:15:36] brings that up that war was so special
[1:15:38] about this place
[1:15:42] but it was known and still known that
[1:15:45] God chose
[1:15:51] but
[1:15:52] z-i-o-no
[1:15:57] it's all in the Old Testament
[1:16:00] except in those two passages when David
[1:16:03] speaks of it once
[1:16:07] and then the first time that we hear of
[1:16:09] it is when he's identified as as
[1:16:17] it speaks in the Bible in the Old
[1:16:19] Testament about 152 times a
[1:16:25] zione I think it's only nine times as I
[1:16:28] am
[1:16:32] and it was a female uh word in the
[1:16:35] Hebrew
[1:16:36] [Music]
[1:16:38] then to the Greeks so
[1:16:48] it is tremendous to me
[1:16:51] that the book of Romans Paul says
[1:16:55] Romanos Pablo dice speaking of a
[1:16:57] showdown here
[1:16:59] as it is written
[1:17:01] behold I lay in Zion a stumbling
[1:17:39] a precious Cornerstone angular preciosa
[1:17:43] a sure Foundation
[1:17:46] establish he has he he that believeth
[1:17:49] shall not make Ace
[1:17:52] but going back to Moses Moses when he
[1:17:56] went around that corner is
[1:18:05] foreign
[1:18:08] which gets my attention to that Mount
[1:18:10] Carmel is in the promised lands
[1:18:19] is before Jordan
[1:18:22] well at that point
[1:18:25] if we take that in time on this side of
[1:18:28] the river
[1:18:30] Del Rio he asked permission to go across
[1:18:33] some property be the permission
[1:18:37] and the most fear people on Earth in
[1:18:41] those days
[1:18:43] which was the king of the amorites
[1:18:46] two Mega giants
[1:18:50] look like a little kid
[1:18:57] German
[1:19:09] so most of a cinder he was just never
[1:19:11] happened
[1:19:15] but he's already been there
[1:19:17] he passed through there
[1:19:20] Joshua and Kayla they learn how to kill
[1:19:22] Giants through that Josue
[1:19:26] in every showdown in Colorado seems like
[1:19:30] there's evil ever presente
[1:19:34] and then goodness
[1:19:46] so The Showdown is not for for the
[1:19:49] believer
[1:19:50] The Showdown is that something shows up
[1:19:55] so in our daily walk as we're talking
[1:19:58] sharing with the brothers
[1:20:01] every time there's there's a showdown
[1:20:03] then
[1:20:06] something has to show up I'll go
[1:20:09] back to caesarea or Philippi
[1:20:17] or somebody had to show up
[1:20:20] and Peter actually showed up
[1:20:23] because everybody's Jesus has asked them
[1:20:26] Jesus
[1:20:29] who the son of man is
[1:20:35] and it took something inside of Peter
[1:20:39] Revelation
[1:20:41] to him to declare
[1:20:56] but Peter the Revelation showed up in
[1:20:59] him
[1:21:00] Revelations
[1:21:04] that Jesus is the Christ is
[1:21:09] that really settle there or that started
[1:21:12] a process
[1:21:14] I would say started the process
[1:21:17] I didn't start at other showdowns
[1:21:23] absolutely everybody's gotta answer that
[1:21:26] showdown in their own life
[1:21:30] because no one can call him the Christ
[1:21:33] except by the holy spirit
[1:21:37] so uh
[1:21:39] the this area of Philippi right
[1:21:43] the scholars believe that that uh
[1:21:47] Mountain Transfiguration was actually
[1:21:50] in Mount Mount Hermon known as Zion yes
[1:21:54] maester because the last location before
[1:21:57] Jesus took him up into a high mountain
[1:21:59] was that that area there in caesarea
[1:22:03] Philippines
[1:22:07] so a previous chapter right there in
[1:22:10] Matthew 16 they're standing there and
[1:22:12] yes
[1:22:14] Peter comes out the greatest Revelation
[1:22:18] and he thought he was somebody
[1:22:46] made such declaration concerning who
[1:22:49] Jesus is
[1:22:52] Jesus and while they're they're in that
[1:22:56] condition up in the high mountains
[1:23:02] oh keep in mind as you follow Peter the
[1:23:04] moment
[1:23:06] that uh Jesus was always on his case
[1:23:09] Jesus
[1:23:11] and he said you know he would tell him
[1:23:14] hey
[1:23:14] Satan asked me for you
[1:23:21] and and and
[1:23:23] there was something about Peter too
[1:23:26] so at The Showdown now this is Peter's
[1:23:30] Showdown it is
[1:23:33] really we we call it the the Montrose
[1:23:37] figuration Showdown but there's not a
[1:23:38] showdown
[1:23:39] Elijah you get Moses
[1:23:45] and and there's and there is uh and
[1:23:48] there's Jesus yes and the supernatural
[1:23:51] event takes place
[1:23:53] there's no confusion there's not really
[1:23:56] nothing going on tonight
[1:24:02] Peter had a mountain figuration Showdown
[1:24:11] because Mr I'm better than everybody I
[1:24:14] know who Jesus is because I know him
[1:24:20] when The Showdown came up yeah
[1:24:24] the trinitarian part of Peter came out
[1:24:29] didn't he try to erect some Tabernacles
[1:24:34] Peter had trinitarian Tendencies
[1:24:38] that's what Jesus says hey I'm going to
[1:24:41] pray that your faith fell you not this
[1:24:43] is
[1:24:44] I'm going to fail I'm going to pray that
[1:24:46] your Revelation don't don't go against
[1:24:48] you
[1:24:53] within him there was something
[1:24:56] that caused him to to confess who Jesus
[1:24:59] was
[1:25:02] there was something there too that
[1:25:04] immediately he wanted to break it in
[1:25:06] three
[1:25:07] elements why don't we just build a
[1:25:10] turmeric one for you one for Moses
[1:25:14] this is The Showdown well and that's why
[1:25:18] I say in that part
[1:25:20] even in Mark Carmel they they turn their
[1:25:23] heart foreign
[1:25:39] in this message was really hard against
[1:25:42] the trinitarian teaching on the spirit
[1:25:45] behind it
[1:25:48] have you wonder why the Catholics
[1:25:50] decided to pick on Peter to make him the
[1:25:52] first pope
[1:25:53] Catholics
[1:25:56] I mean Peter was never even in Rome
[1:25:58] Pedro and roma right but period that was
[1:26:02] there
[1:26:04] upon this Upon This Rock I will build my
[1:26:07] church
[1:26:09] well they wanted those because Peter had
[1:26:13] trinitarian tendencies
[1:26:17] the Lord rebukes them
[1:26:21] how many know that
[1:26:24] yes now after that confession
[1:26:28] it's like every time Peter says
[1:26:30] something the Lord was on his case
[1:26:35] immediately immediately and and because
[1:26:38] he was hunting that spirit so
[1:26:43] then the Lord is speaking about his
[1:26:46] death
[1:26:47] and Peter rebukes the Lord
[1:26:52] a Jesus
[1:26:55] it I think it's in the book of Luke the
[1:26:57] music is in Lucas well I know it's
[1:27:00] different one different this the
[1:27:01] different scriptures said that I
[1:27:03] differences
[1:27:05] but but when the Lord is speaking about
[1:27:07] how he has to go to Jerusalem and and
[1:27:09] die
[1:27:13] then Peter goes and rebukes the Lord no
[1:27:16] don't talk like that
[1:27:19] no he's bringing the show down with him
[1:27:23] because even if people is confounded and
[1:27:27] remember that Zion
[1:27:29] brings confusion
[1:27:33] some people think science is Jerusalem
[1:27:36] are going to spend some questions
[1:27:38] and they don't leave Jerusalem because
[1:27:41] any anywhere outside of Jerusalem is
[1:27:44] wrong
[1:27:45] then
[1:27:48] even Mount Hebron which is very
[1:27:51] significant in the southern parts of
[1:27:53] Palestine is
[1:27:57] Palestinians when the Lord brings uh and
[1:28:00] mentions uh the New Jerusalem as Zion
[1:28:07] it's very confusing
[1:28:09] well Bueno
[1:28:14] what about Peter que de Pedro and it's
[1:28:17] trinitarian attendance is
[1:28:20] the spirit that after the confession of
[1:28:24] who Jesus is
[1:28:29] you know that in Mount Zion or Herman in
[1:28:32] the montession OR Hermon is known for
[1:28:36] three outstanding Peaks is so
[1:28:43] still has three points I
[1:28:46] [Laughter]
[1:28:48] mean
[1:28:51] um
[1:28:53] Peter descends
[1:28:56] and says Lord I will not leave you it is
[1:28:59] then the Lord tells him you will deny me
[1:29:02] three times
[1:29:04] before I knew this so you you will deny
[1:29:07] me three times
[1:29:08] we already show you colors up in
[1:29:10] Mountain speakers
[1:29:17] and he did deny him
[1:29:19] then he he had an experience
[1:29:23] he knew that
[1:29:25] his confession
[1:29:27] it's not good
[1:29:33] there was not alive in him
[1:29:36] because what you're saying he hadn't
[1:29:38] killed those false prophets those that
[1:29:41] anointing those called spirits espiritus
[1:29:47] I believe that after his experience
[1:29:50] to experience yeah he changed them
[1:29:54] why why was why do I consider this so
[1:29:57] delicate
[1:29:59] because Jesus said
[1:30:03] uh
[1:30:06] Jesus said in Matthew 28 in Mateo
[1:30:10] therefore and teach All Nations
[1:30:14] baptizing them in the name of the father
[1:30:17] and of the Sun the liho and of the Holy
[1:30:20] Ghost Santo
[1:30:23] what if Peter would have got would have
[1:30:25] gotten hold of this
[1:30:27] without an experience yeah
[1:30:34] yeah because it's Peter later on after
[1:30:38] he said Lord let's build three
[1:30:39] Tabernacles here this is
[1:30:43] the Lord said hey I gotta pray for you
[1:30:46] because
[1:30:47] I pray your faith don't fail yes
[1:30:52] I will never leave you even if everybody
[1:30:55] does before
[1:30:59] the morning comes you will deny me three
[1:31:02] times
[1:31:07] that experience of feeling that he had
[1:31:10] betrayed the Lord and his confession
[1:31:12] it's experience
[1:31:17] when he had a New Birth really
[1:31:22] you know that later on Peter comes and
[1:31:25] says
[1:31:28] says repent he said repentios and be
[1:31:31] baptized said about this others the name
[1:31:34] of the Lord Jesus amen
[1:31:37] but he also said one more thing
[1:31:42] concerning zione
[1:31:45] in the book of Peter first Peter 2 6
[1:31:49] and he says wherefore also is containing
[1:31:52] the scripture
[1:31:54] is
[1:31:59] a Chief Cornerstone La Piedra principal
[1:32:02] elect
[1:32:04] Gonzalo
[1:32:13] decision
[1:32:16] [Music]
[1:32:19] and everybody say amen amen
[1:32:25] for ye are not common to the amount that
[1:32:29] might be touched
[1:32:33] and that burned with fire nor unto
[1:32:37] Blackness
[1:32:41] and darkness and Tempest
[1:32:46] and the sound of a trumpet is
[1:32:49] and the voice of Words
[1:32:53] which voice they that heard entreated
[1:32:59] the words should not be spoken to them
[1:33:03] anymore
[1:33:06] for they could not endure that which was
[1:33:09] commanded
[1:33:13] and if so much as a beast touch the
[1:33:17] mountains
[1:33:19] it shall be stoned
[1:33:22] or thrust through with the dark
[1:33:30] and so terrible was the sight that Moses
[1:33:34] said
[1:33:37] I exceedingly fear and Quake yo is
[1:33:45] but ye are common to Mount Zion
[1:33:50] and unto the city of the Living God
[1:33:54] the heavenly Jerusalem
[1:33:57] Celestial and to an innumerable company
[1:34:00] of angels
[1:34:04] to the general assembly and Church of
[1:34:08] the firstborn
[1:34:12] which are written in heaven
[1:34:16] and to God the judge of all
[1:34:20] and to the spirits of just men made
[1:34:24] perfect
[1:34:27] so you you we find out then then that
[1:34:30] Zion or Zion is is the bride
[1:34:33] is placed in here
[1:34:37] there is there is a message that we
[1:34:40] believe
[1:34:41] there's a message that we should live
[1:34:45] cannot be something that we can just
[1:34:47] repeat
[1:34:49] it's got to be something that we say
[1:34:53] spoken word
[1:34:55] is that original
[1:34:58] so as we have received the seed in this
[1:35:01] last day
[1:35:04] it causes a manifestation to come out
[1:35:09] this is why brother Branham before in
[1:35:13] future home
[1:35:15] you can put this this one up here
[1:35:17] gentlemen
[1:35:19] before before he talks about what we're
[1:35:23] going to say
[1:35:40] this is where where the majority of
[1:35:43] people have and we all have our problems
[1:35:48] if we can't turn it around but this is
[1:35:51] what we have it all the first one el
[1:35:54] primero this is before we can ever go
[1:35:57] any further with God it says
[1:36:00] the first circle is the sinner is
[1:36:05] God comes he he cleanses the all of this
[1:36:11] and it comes into the person comes into
[1:36:14] justification
[1:36:16] it goes from Lost to Justified
[1:36:21] and he's cleansed of all these things
[1:36:24] that
[1:36:26] but according to the prophet of God
[1:36:30] that old serpent that thing that made
[1:36:33] you do it
[1:36:36] it's still in there
[1:36:38] and this is then where we come to a key
[1:36:42] is he said but then it becomes empty
[1:36:45] that serpent is taken out
[1:36:48] but what we want to do is to be able to
[1:36:53] come into Mount Zion
[1:36:56] it's a new nature
[1:37:00] it's a new creation
[1:37:05] this is where he has placed the
[1:37:07] Revelation
[1:37:09] this is before we can ever go to the
[1:37:12] Heavenly Jerusalem
[1:37:14] has got to be satisfied in our life who
[1:38:22] and The Showdown is for him that it that
[1:38:25] his is that is his
[1:38:31] we are either children or Sons and
[1:38:33] Daughters of God
[1:38:35] I always say this if the message only
[1:38:38] came to produce one son
[1:38:42] what a waste of a message
[1:38:46] but the message did not just come to
[1:38:49] produce
[1:38:51] we are living in the time
[1:38:59] The Showdown comes
[1:39:02] now now I I I was was traveling with our
[1:39:05] pastor the other day
[1:39:08] and you know sometimes I I had dreamed
[1:39:11] that maybe one time that that maybe one
[1:39:13] day I would learn how I could preach
