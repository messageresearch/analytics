[29:10] Corinthians the third chapter in the
[29:12] sixteenth verse in the seventeenth um
[29:14] and I have a lot of scriptures that I'm
[29:16] gonna read so - that's you're in Sunday
[29:19] school this morning
[29:20] estamos en escuela manically ever give

[30:35] loud is to last time what it does not
[30:39] represent oh okay know ye not that your
[30:44] body is the temple of the Holy Ghost
[30:46] which is in you which ye have of God and

[50:04] feel right at home
[50:05] can ya mother that look but a star come
[50:06] when Casa and watch as Moses begins to
[50:09] write the first book of the Bible who
[50:11] says that
[50:12] Olivia and he says in the beginning even
[50:16] el principio God created your Clio not
[50:21] Satan no certain because Satan is not a
[50:24] creator gaining God created and then
[50:29] Pacific heroes of the heaven los cielos
[50:31] and the earth ela Tierra
[50:33] amen how many can say amen to that
[50:35] that's God's Word when the seat of
[50:36] midnight
[50:37] notice God created the heaven and the
[50:39] earth the heaven it's you know is the
[50:43] original is godina it's what everything
[50:46] is patterned after it's okay some more
[50:49] than others yeah and the earth is the
[50:52] inheritance of man that he was going to
[50:54] create is that NCI parra Lumbricus
[50:56] you'll see what we had one more time in
[50:58] the beginning God created the heaven and
[51:01] the earth and the precipitous cureless
[51:03] yet is let it slow cetera
[51:06] he created the very pattern kill in
[51:08] patron and then created the earth you

[51:36] was here and it was the earth yeah that
[51:39] was without form and void and darkness
[51:42] was upon the face look at the eyes so
