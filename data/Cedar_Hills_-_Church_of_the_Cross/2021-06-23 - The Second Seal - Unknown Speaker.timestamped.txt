[0:00] now tonight we are studying this
[0:03] uh second seal and it for the first four
[0:07] seals
[0:08] there is four harsh riders then i grab
[0:11] me a pencil right quick and start
[0:13] writing down as fast as i can
[0:15] while he's there he's doing something
[0:18] real supernatural now
[0:20] too so we're just expecting great things
[0:23] now i'll read the third verse now and
[0:26] when he had
[0:27] opened the second seal i heard the
[0:29] second beast say
[0:31] come and see and there i went out
[0:33] another horse
[0:35] fourth verse that was red and power was
[0:38] given to him that set thereon
[0:40] to take peace from the earth that they
[0:43] should kill one another
[0:45] and they should kill one another and
[0:48] there was given
[0:50] unto him a great sword
[0:53] and he didn't see what it was he just
[0:56] saw
[0:56] a symbol and that symbol
[1:00] for the reason it was he said come see
[1:03] but he saw a symbol that he was to
[1:06] symbolize it
[1:07] to the church and remember the secrets
[1:10] was to be revealed in the last day
[1:13] and how does he reveal his word his
[1:17] secrets
[1:18] the bible notice the first church
[1:22] when the catholic church says that they
[1:24] were the first
[1:26] original church they're exactly right
[1:29] they were they began at pentecost
[1:33] that's where the catholic church began
[1:36] i once didn't hardly believe that i read
[1:39] history and i found
[1:40] out it's right now let's go to the
[1:42] second season
[1:43] [Music]
[1:45] when the slain risen
[1:48] lamb opened it and the
[1:51] second uh calf-like
[1:54] beast said come see what the seal
[1:59] mystery is now we get it the lamb
[2:02] remember has to open every seal
[2:04] the second first was a line the next was
[2:07] a was
[2:08] a was it like a calf or a ox or
[2:10] something
[2:12] we find here that he saw what
[2:16] a red horse go forward
[2:20] let's just read and see what he says
[2:21] here and there went out the fourth verse
[2:23] there went out
[2:24] another horse that was red the first and
[2:28] swine
[2:29] and power was given unto him that set
[2:31] their own to take
[2:32] peace from the earth and they should
[2:35] kill
[2:36] one another and there was given him
[2:39] a great sword now
[2:42] this symbol here and we want to look at
[2:45] him real close
[2:47] let us now consider what john saw
[2:50] then of these things what he saw a red
[2:53] horse
[2:54] and his rider goes forth power given to
[2:57] him
[2:58] to slay with a great sword
[3:02] now here's my revelation
[3:06] this is satan again it's a devil
[3:11] again in another form
[3:14] now we know that that um seals pertained
[3:19] as i said the other night and trumpets
[3:20] pertain to
[3:21] to civil wars you see amongst the people
[3:25] among nations but you find out here
[3:28] that this man has a sword so he pertains
[3:31] to church
[3:32] political war you might not think that
[3:35] but just watch in a minute
[3:38] notice the
[3:41] change of color of these horses same
[3:44] rider
[3:47] change of color of horses and a horse is
[3:50] a beast
[3:51] and the beast in the bible and her
[3:53] symbol represents a power
[3:56] the same system riding on another color
[4:00] power from the innocent white to a
[4:05] bloody red
[4:07] see watch him now it's coming
[4:11] when he first started he was
[4:15] just uh well he's just a little doctor
[4:17] to get a
[4:19] much closer nicoladianism of course
[4:22] it wouldn't slay anything that's
[4:24] revelation 2 6 if you want to put it
[4:25] down
[4:26] then after while he was given a crown
[4:28] because you can't put a crown on his
[4:30] spirit's
[4:30] edge but when this spirit become
[4:32] incarnate
[4:33] the second work of his of his
[4:35] dispensation of his
[4:37] missing the second word
[4:40] he become a crowned false prophet
[4:44] to the working of the antichrist spirit
[4:49] now we see him now
[4:52] he becomes that when he takes that then
[4:56] he uh is already satan controls
[5:00] the political powers of the world
[5:03] now he gets into a place that he's going
[5:06] to make a universal
[5:07] church power taking religious power
[5:11] and do you not understand my brothers
[5:15] that in when this nation appears
[5:19] in the 13th chapter of revelation
[5:22] this little animal raised up like a lamb
[5:26] and it's got two horns civil
[5:29] and ecclesiastical power but he done the
[5:32] same thing the beast did before
[5:35] now when he did that he did not have the
[5:38] ecclesiastical power yet
[5:41] but he started him with a demon of a
[5:44] false
[5:45] teaching and that teaching become a
[5:47] doctrine
[5:48] that doctrine become incarnate in a
[5:51] false prophet
[5:53] and then he went just to the right place
[5:57] he never went to israel now he went to
[5:59] rome
[6:00] now i see a room the council was held
[6:03] and they elected a head bishop
[6:07] amen and then by doing this
[6:10] they united church and stayed together
[6:15] then he dropped his bowl
[6:18] he got off his white horse he got on his
[6:22] red horse
[6:23] or he can kill anybody that don't agree
[6:25] with him
[6:26] [Music]
[6:28] there's your seal
[6:31] same watch him right on into eternity
[6:35] see unites both his powers together
[6:40] now we find out he unites his power
[6:44] then when he become both state and
[6:46] church
[6:48] the ecclesiastical then what are you
[6:50] going to do
[6:51] he farms his own religion and now he can
[6:54] do whatever he wants to
[6:56] that he has a right to putt to death
[6:58] whosoever will not agree with him
[7:01] that's exactly what he did too amen
[7:04] he went back down to hippo and he was
[7:07] the very one that signed that
[7:09] paper that had the revelation from god
[7:12] that it was
[7:13] all right and pleasing god to put every
[7:16] person to death that didn't believe with
[7:18] the roman catholic church
[7:20] now listen i'm quoting from the
[7:22] mortality
[7:24] from the timeless of saint augustine of
[7:27] hippo
[7:28] until 15 and 86 on the
[7:32] roman mortarology the roman
[7:35] catholic church put 68 million
[7:39] protestants today
[7:40] [Music]
[7:43] was his sword red was it ride a red
[7:45] horse
[7:47] what was it the same power
[7:51] the same rider amen there's the seal
[7:55] they admit 68
[7:58] million on the mortarology besides all
[8:00] those put to death outside of that
[8:03] oh mercy during the dark ages there were
[8:07] millions fed the lions and slaughtered
[8:10] that way
[8:10] because they wouldn't bow down to that
[8:12] catholic doctrine
[8:13] now let me say something brother there's
[8:16] something fixing to happen
[8:18] and all these big old ecclesiastical
[8:20] walls are going to collapse
[8:22] and go right back over honor and agree
[8:24] because you're go to good as certain as
[8:25] i'm standing here
[8:27] there's an image to that beast it's a
[8:29] certain as i'm standing you're in this
[8:30] nation talking
[8:31] according to the word of the law listen
[8:34] when you feel that little funny feeling
[8:37] you get away from them walls get away
[8:39] you'll die
[8:40] there don't do it come out of it get
[8:43] away from all this stuff
[8:44] leave the safety as quick as you can
[8:48] ask come for mercy that's power hit
[8:54] heavenly father oh i i just sometimes
[8:59] lord stand urine and i
[9:02] tremble i think that awful
[9:06] hour that's approaching
[9:09] and uh there's no way to stop it

[9:16] now i thought of why don't the people
[9:19] come
[9:20] and and listen and what they come and
[9:23] accept it
[9:25] but of course i know that that
[9:28] you said they wouldn't so they won't
[9:31] but there is some that's got their names
[9:34] written on the lamb's book of life
[9:36] and when them seals are thrown over
[9:38] there they see their name there and the
[9:40] holy spirit speaks to them
[9:41] they come you can't keep them away no
