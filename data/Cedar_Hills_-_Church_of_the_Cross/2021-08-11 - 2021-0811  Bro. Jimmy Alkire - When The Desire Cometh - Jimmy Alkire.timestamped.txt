[27:43] jimmy alkire
[27:45] to bring words of life if you guys can
[27:47] please stand
[27:49] how many are ready to receive
[27:52] we've done our part we've tilled the
[27:54] ground we have set the atmosphere
[27:57] now it's time for the lord to come and
[27:59] to reign his holiness on us
[28:05] [Music]
[28:11] [Music]
[28:21] is
[28:23] [Music]
[28:31] is
[28:35] [Music]

[29:20] [Music]
[29:32] lord

[29:47] [Music]
[29:49] oh
[29:59] [Music]
[30:02] oh man
[30:08] [Music]
[30:26] oh
[30:32] [Music]
[30:48] [Music]
[31:01] but the reason that they can't
[31:15] and then the lord draws unto
[31:29] i have a little subject tonight i don't
[31:31] know you know yeah let me look at the
[31:33] clock even though
[31:34] i don't think this is deep
[31:36] you know me
[31:39] i'll try to keep it as simple as i can
[31:41] it is really simple
[31:44] [Music]
[31:54] and in spanish it doesn't give you the
[31:56] same meaning
[32:08] but in the old translation of the king
[32:10] james version
[32:12] valera when it says when the desire
[32:15] comes
[32:19] it means that when this desire comes
[32:22] to the sale it's not gonna stop
[32:27] it's going to continue
[32:29] until it produces something inside of
[32:32] you
[32:33] nosotros
[32:36] lord jesus and we're going to get into
[32:37] it a little bit
[32:40] god give us the grace amen
[32:43] so let's go to our first scripture in in
[32:46] proverbs chapter 13.
[32:50] proverbial
[33:04] where i majored on the first part of the
[33:06] verse
[33:08] uh
[33:21] why does it make the heart sick for
[33:23] torment
[33:24] because you thought it was something so
[33:26] sure that you would receive
[33:29] it
[33:33] and you kept waiting for it and you kept
[33:35] waiting and you kept hoping and it never
[33:52] so god is telling you now this desire
[33:54] you had that gave you a hope
[34:00] it let you down
[34:03] in other words it's the wrong kind of a
[34:06] desire
[34:09] but when this desire comes
[34:18] it is
[34:29] for all your mercy and your goodness
[34:34] and we just thank you lord for
[34:37] another day of life
[34:41] another day to serve you lord
[34:46] another day to
[34:48] express your love to this lost world
[34:55] express your word to your children that
[34:57] have been redeemed
[35:10] as he said oh what i would do if i had
[35:14] too literal blood blood drops of the
[35:16] blood of jesus
[35:18] [Music]
[35:22] christ
[35:25] [Music]
[35:27] how i would hold it over my heart
[35:31] but today i have a greater privilege
[35:34] than that
[35:38] and that is to speak to those that have
[35:39] been purchased by that blood yes yes
[35:58] but there's not one speck of desire in
[36:00] us to ever defraud your children
[36:07] even though we have many mistakes as
[36:09] humans
[36:19] amen amen you may be seated
[36:24] now let's turn to hebrews chapter 10
[36:30] yes
[36:33] verse 2
[36:36] you know
[36:37] why the lord spoke
[36:38] sunday all day actually but in the
[36:41] evening with brother william
[36:46] when he spoke about the salmon that just
[36:48] got me
[36:52] to see what produced that drive in
[36:56] the salmon
[37:01] and i want to recommend something to you
[37:02] young people that you'll love
[37:08] back in the year of 2017
[37:14] our pastor brother caleb preached a
[37:16] series of messages how many remember
[37:18] this series the mind of the spirit
[37:22] [Music]
[37:35] where he really and i'm not going to go
[37:36] into that there because then i'll never
[37:38] get into my message
[37:41] but he he gets into what our conscience
[37:44] really is
[37:48] and he actually used this scripture
[37:52] and many others
[37:53] [Music]
[37:54] so i want to read this
[37:57] go get a hold of that message
[38:01] it shows you exactly what god is going
[38:06] to do in you and he's doing it
[38:12] it'll bring you to such a point
[38:26] for then would they not have ceased to
[38:29] be offered talking about the sacrifices
[38:31] of the old testament
[38:33] sacrifices
[38:39] because that the worshipers
[38:44] was through
[39:00] [Applause]
[39:14] and we know as we heard our pastor and
[39:16] we hear the messenger of the day
[39:21] that the word conscience there
[39:23] prophet says you no longer have a desire
[39:32] now let's go to first peter chapter 3
[39:34] verse 21. very familiar now i want to
[39:36] read this scripture because we've had
[39:38] some new baptisms
[39:44] and if any of you are here tonight that
[39:46] got baptized
[39:48] are you on cloud nine right now
[39:51] uh
[40:00] floating around there
[40:02] oh that's good it's when god picks you
[40:03] up in your his arms
[40:06] oh he even he even rocks you into
[40:13] even
[40:14] amen
[40:17] but then as you begin to confront your
[40:19] everyday life
[40:33] there's still something in you that
[40:35] desires sin
[40:38] picado and what that
[40:41] serpent nature does
[40:45] it distracts you from the spirit
[40:48] of the spirit that's in your heart
[40:52] of that desire
[40:55] that when it comes
[40:57] it's going to produce the tree of life
[41:01] it distracts you from that
[41:03] to destroy the eso so watch
[41:18] how many know that little song
[41:22] every day with jesus
[41:26] is sweeter than the day before
[41:51] [Music]
[41:57] from up here i can get down and talk to
[41:58] you one on one
[42:12] you're not depending on yesterday's
[42:14] experience
[42:19] you appreciate what god did for you
[42:21] yesterday
[42:24] but you want to walk with him every day
[42:28] you're not dissatisfied with what you
[42:30] get at church
[42:34] don't misunderstand that
[42:37] i get super satisfied well our services
[42:40] are
[42:41] out of this world
[42:55] there will be a tree
[43:00] [Applause]
[43:09] every day with jesus
[44:02] he's the one i'm living for
[44:34] you become
[44:43] i might turn into a bitter old cranky
[44:45] man someday
[45:01] are you ready for a little bit more
[45:09] the like figure were unto even baptism
[45:14] that also now save
[45:27] you don't listen to the scripture
[45:29] correctly in english it says
[45:43] it's actually the word
[45:58] but it does save you
[45:59] see
[46:01] where i can figure now when to even
[46:03] baptism does
[46:05] also now save us
[46:23] in other words that nature that's fallen
[46:56] by the resurrection of jesus christ
[47:01] why he begins to raise you from the dead
[47:33] your baptism is an expression in the
[47:36] outward
[47:41] but it's based on something that's
[47:43] happening on the inside of you
[47:50] understand it's safe the baptism yes yes
[47:54] it saves us
[47:55] now we have a good conscience towards
[47:57] god
[48:01] but this conscious begins to struggle
[48:03] these desires that we have
[48:30] and you couldn't tell the difference you
[48:32] know
[48:44] my
[48:46] mind uh i would like to read a quote out
[48:50] of identified with christ
[48:56] and actually brother willow i'm going to
[48:57] read this one in paragraph 75 first
[49:13] or if we suffer with him
[49:17] we shall reign with him
[49:20] and god has given us the promise
[49:25] my whole desire
[49:28] completely
[49:42] begins to control me now
[49:45] there's something down in my soul
[49:48] and my whole desire
[49:51] is to be like him
[49:55] how many want to be like him
[49:58] [Music]
[50:08] this was going to be a preaching yes
[50:11] [Music]
[50:13] but at the same time i don't want to go
[50:14] too crazy
[50:17] because i want to make sure you get this
[50:21] well first of all i wanted to make sure
[50:23] that i got it
[50:38] the tree of life what does that mean yes
[50:41] significance that little desire this is
[50:43] the same beginning of the same goes down
[50:45] in that very gene of your soul
[50:50] that is so small
[50:52] before
[51:06] your life into existence
[51:10] it will take you to genesis 1 26.
[51:15] when your spirit was created in the
[51:17] image and the likeness of god
[51:28] amen
[51:31] we're going to get to something good
[51:34] something
[51:46] so when brother jimmy kicks the bucket
[51:48] someday
[52:15] we have to transfer it to you
[52:19] it's not just the young young but the
[52:20] older young no no
[52:24] we don't know how long we're going to be
[52:26] here
[52:28] but right now i've got doors opening up
[52:30] to preaching
[52:31] apostolic churches
[52:35] and i'm going to go
[52:38] and the pastors know
[52:42] out of water
[52:55] it's just something i have to express
[52:57] that i just don't understand
[53:30] now let's go down to paragraph 7b
[53:39] the second part
[53:47] it's that was paragraph 75 there but
[53:50] let's go down to
[53:51] paragraph 77
[53:54] d
[53:57] i'll just read it from here then for
[53:58] right now he'll get it he's doing a fine
[54:00] job
[54:04] very well
[54:07] he knowing no sin
[54:24] and it's no more like than what is right
[54:29] it's no more than what is right
[54:34] no more than
[54:35] our duty is to look at these things
[54:40] and see these desires that we have
[54:46] that god put in us
[54:49] to create
[55:03] all right now we're going to go to a
[55:04] scripture that people think oh that
[55:06] don't even talk about me
[55:11] well you're going to find out it's
[55:12] exactly what it's talking about
[55:16] he's talking about us is
[55:20] do you see yourself in the bible
[55:23] do you see yourself in the message
[55:26] he created us this desire
[55:30] to make us
[55:32] want to be like him
[55:36] now what's this next statement
[55:40] because here i see proverbs 13 12.
[55:43] um
[55:57] before the real desire ever
[56:29] come forward and be identified with him
[56:31] in baptism
[56:35] is there anybody here tonight
[56:38] that would like to be identified with
[56:40] jesus
[57:19] begins to stand up
[57:26] my
[57:31] and then as you are planted
[57:36] oh my
[57:38] it reminds me of something that
[57:39] brotherhood said
[57:41] he said not stuck out somewhere
[57:52] oh
[57:53] a sea can't grow up it's not planted
[57:58] that's so simple to understand right
[58:05] in the likeness of his death
[58:09] you shall also share
[58:13] in the likeness of
[58:15] the resurrection
[58:21] now we're going to go to a scripture
[58:22] that everybody thinks
[58:24] is the scripture don't talk about me
[58:31] let's go to first corinthians
[58:38] and we're going to
[58:40] start with verse 10.
[58:44] are you understanding me a little bit
[58:47] how many of you
[59:00] if you repented and that were baptized
[59:02] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[59:07] you were planted in the likeness of his
[59:09] death
[59:14] that's why god's not going to get away
[59:16] let you get away with
[59:30] before i ever got the baptism of the
[59:33] holy ghost
[59:38] this flesh tried to get away with all
[59:39] kinds of stuff
[1:00:07] now we're going to get into it a little
[1:00:08] bit
[1:00:14] let's go back to youtube actually to
[1:00:16] verse nine brothers i i said ten let's
[1:00:18] go back tonight
[1:00:24] did i get your water brother
[1:00:28] sorry bro i didn't drink out of it i
[1:00:30] almost did
[1:00:34] y'all forgive me can put up with me a
[1:00:35] little bit
[1:00:38] oh man i'm in trouble
[1:00:39] can you all put up with me a little bit
[1:00:44] i feel a little bit bad
[1:00:48] amen
[1:00:50] but as it is written
[1:00:52] i have not seen
[1:00:54] nor ear heard
[1:00:57] neither had it entered into the heart of
[1:00:59] man
[1:01:00] the things which god had prepared for
[1:01:03] them
[1:01:04] that love him
[1:01:45] but now watch as god begins to search
[1:01:48] your life
[1:01:50] [Music]
[1:02:02] amen
[1:02:05] but god has revealed them to us
[1:02:11] by his spirits
[1:02:16] for the spirit searches all
[1:02:46] but notice
[1:02:58] as a foundation for the seals
[1:03:15] but when it says the good things of god
[1:03:19] we want to look around this space
[1:03:23] but it's actually talking about you
[1:03:25] understand
[1:03:27] aren't you of god can you
[1:03:54] so this scripture does talk about uh
[1:04:01] [Music]
[1:04:10] for the
[1:04:11] search of things
[1:04:19] it goes into you
[1:04:22] the very fact that you're here
[1:04:25] [Music]
[1:04:38] he sees
[1:04:53] the spirit begins to search
[1:04:57] us
[1:05:01] that's what he's been doing
[1:05:06] the ministry that's what we've been
[1:05:07] doing
[1:05:10] that's what the camp meetings were about
[1:05:15] god from eternity
[1:05:19] he's coming down and he's finding those
[1:05:22] he's coming down and he's finding though
[1:05:29] but he can't accept them back into his
[1:05:32] presence
[1:05:47] whether you understand it or not
[1:06:01] it's incredible
[1:06:05] the state of being profound
[1:06:12] the quality of being great
[1:06:16] an extent
[1:06:31] have such a great magnitude
[1:06:34] magnitude that we as humans don't
[1:06:37] understand
[1:06:40] in this fallen state
[1:06:43] it says
[1:06:59] you know the scripture says
[1:07:02] that he would pour out his spirit up
[1:07:05] on all flesh
[1:07:10] but he would never be able to
[1:07:12] live
[1:07:25] where he could go
[1:07:48] oh my goodness
[1:07:49] so can you see this scripture even
[1:07:51] though if you just read it like that
[1:07:54] it
[1:08:09] but the spirit of god el espiritu
[1:08:12] comes
[1:08:13] vienna
[1:08:14] he hides himself in simplicity
[1:08:17] in simplicity but then under simplicity
[1:08:21] of this creation
[1:09:33] even so that things of god knows no man
[1:09:41] i'm gonna say it this way
[1:09:44] there's things of the spirit of god no
[1:09:46] serpent man knows them
[1:09:54] now our elder preached that we by this
[1:09:57] wrong birth are serpent seed
[1:10:42] until you
[1:11:24] amen
[1:11:32] and they thought they were ready for the
[1:11:34] rapture
[1:11:36] because they couldn't even walk yet
[1:11:52] oops
[1:11:56] or daddy or papa
[1:11:58] showed you how to walk
[1:12:01] why you didn't even know how to talk
[1:12:04] but you hear daddy talk
[1:12:19] did you know he walked around as a memo
[1:12:29] brother said for a long time
[1:12:34] before
[1:13:01] his soul
[1:13:15] to please god
[1:13:22] [Music]
[1:13:30] it
[1:13:40] and our pastor says they're his only
[1:13:41] consciousness
[1:13:44] the consensus
[1:13:53] well he wasn't even conscious of
[1:13:55] themselves
[1:14:41] are you happy
[1:14:43] let's continue reading here
[1:14:46] amen
[1:14:50] let's go down now to verse 14.
[1:14:56] let's go back to verse 12 actually
[1:15:00] for we have received not the spirit of
[1:15:03] the world
[1:15:07] but the spirit which is of god
[1:15:12] that we might know the things that are
[1:15:15] freely given to us
[1:15:32] let's read that last part together where
[1:15:34] it starts but the spirit which is of god
[1:15:48] now we have received
[1:15:50] not the spirit of the world
[1:15:54] but the spirit which is of god
[1:15:57] that we might know the things that are
[1:16:00] freely given to us
[1:16:18] oh
[1:16:45] according that he has predestinated
[1:16:51] [Applause]
[1:17:01] and he knows exactly what he's doing in
[1:17:02] your life
[1:17:08] there's so much of this that can stop
[1:17:09] and go in too much but
[1:17:11] i'm down to about 10 minutes
[1:17:20] amen
[1:17:23] which are given to us now verse 13
[1:17:28] now these things are freely given to us
[1:17:32] what are we going to do with them
[1:17:37] don't stay in there
[1:17:39] don't tell your neighbor
[1:17:41] don't tell your
[1:17:43] best friend in the world
[1:17:45] [Music]
[1:17:54] there are people in the world i don't
[1:17:55] get along good with as far as
[1:18:10] the decent people they know
[1:18:12] that aren't there are christians
[1:18:15] i have no problem
[1:18:18] but i can't
[1:18:20] be who i am
[1:18:37] i'm trying to testify to them with my
[1:18:38] life
[1:18:53] no these things have been fully given to
[1:18:55] us of god we just read it
[1:18:58] which things we put on the shelf
[1:19:06] which things also we speak
[1:19:10] versus verse 13 bro
[1:19:12] in the beginning
[1:19:34] english now
[1:19:37] which things also we speak not in the
[1:19:39] words of which man's wisdom teaches
[1:19:42] but which the holy ghost teaches
[1:19:45] comparing spiritual things
[1:19:48] with spiritual
[1:19:52] but the natural man receiveth not the
[1:19:55] things
[1:19:57] of the spirit of god
[1:20:09] [Music]
[1:20:20] the animal man
[1:20:22] or they are foolishness to him
[1:20:28] neither can he know them you know
[1:20:39] but he that is spiritual
[1:20:41] judgment of things
[1:20:44] and come your
[1:20:58] the spirit of god searches out all the
[1:21:01] things
[1:21:04] of god
[1:21:07] he gives you spiritual discernment
[1:21:12] he gives you the revelation
[1:21:15] of how to discern the difference
[1:21:19] between what's of the world and what's
[1:21:21] of god
[1:21:24] what's the difference between religion
[1:21:26] and christianity
[1:21:54] you know why we have a hard time seeing
[1:21:56] this
[1:21:58] go see that go in this little message
[1:22:05] the mind of the spirit
[1:22:11] and i wrote this down the best i could
[1:22:12] okay i might have missed a word or two
[1:22:17] adam was one with god in spiritual
[1:22:20] perception
[1:22:29] [Music]
[1:22:37] self-conscious
[1:22:45] the veil had been ripped
[1:22:49] and now he saw himself in a different
[1:22:52] way
[1:22:55] than he had never seen before
[1:23:01] he became self-conscious
[1:24:09] majority of you do so don't anybody
[1:24:11] think that i'm growing and indirect
[1:24:42] [Music]
[1:24:56] you'll never find that he was conscious
[1:24:58] of himself
[1:24:59] before the fall
[1:25:03] that didn't happen until after the fall
[1:25:08] now he saw himself through the eyes of
[1:25:12] the enemy
[1:25:15] rather than seeing himself through the
[1:25:17] eyes of god
[1:25:21] and i got this part i got it in
[1:25:22] parenthesis because i got it exactly
[1:25:24] right our pastor said in 2017
[1:25:29] i am tired of seeing myself through the
[1:25:33] eyes of the enemy
[1:25:37] how many of you are tired
[1:26:34] face to face
[1:26:37] son how did it go today
[1:26:41] what face to face
[1:27:30] he
[1:27:42] but it could not annihilate sin from
[1:28:40] in the book of
[1:28:45] he was filled with the holy ghost
[1:28:48] but when he saw there nobody could come
[1:28:50] out and open the seals
[1:29:21] because when that desire would come
[1:29:23] forth
[1:29:25] it would be a tree of life
[1:29:35] so what is
[1:29:50] and it lets
[1:29:51] [Music]
[1:30:05] [Music]
[1:30:16] and you can see what you should have
[1:30:18] done
