[0:13] no we don't have membership in no church
[0:18] not here on the earth
[0:21] here we have fellowship
[0:25] around the world
[0:28] so then
[0:29] when your spirit bears record with his
[0:32] spirits
[0:36] when the love of god is in your heart
[0:41] in other words
[0:56] a
[0:58] this is a different anointing from
[1:01] the young ministers that have
[1:03] preached something
[1:08] domingo let me say one thing
[1:13] let me give him his flowers
[1:17] because i preached to you
[1:19] everybody takes flowers to the grave
[1:39] wednesday
[1:40] miraculous
[1:41] it to me one of the best messages this
[1:44] man has praised
[1:46] [Music]
[1:48] everybody was saying amen
[1:50] amen he's my buddy it's me
[2:00] god bless you
[2:01] oh man
[2:03] oh my god i have to say something
[2:06] david
[2:20] i didn't like the way he was but now
[2:23] oh my god
[2:27] one of caleb's right hand man
[2:31] and you're my professor oh
[2:36] [Music]
[2:51] you can tell me afterwards
[2:56] notice hebrews 6 11.
[3:00] and we decided that every one of you do
[3:02] show the same diligence to the full
[3:04] assurance of hope unto the end
[3:16] nuts lost for the followers of them who
[3:20] through faith and patience inherit the
[3:23] promises
[3:32] for when god made the promise to abraham
[3:34] because he could swear by no greater he
[3:37] swear by himself
[3:46] saying surely blessing i will bless thee
[3:49] and multiplying i will multiply them
[3:58] now abraham received the covenant
[4:00] without any merit at all
[4:07] not because abraham was a better man
[4:10] okay
[4:12] or a
[4:39] even though he was a gentleman
[4:43] he was a good scribe
[4:46] he was a scholar
[4:49] he was a diplomat
[4:52] he never did
[4:54] nothing he didn't do anything
[4:58] but god took a little hook knows
[5:22] it
[5:24] because it will lead you into temptation
[5:30] because the day you eat you shall surely
[5:32] die
[5:36] and
[5:36] then there in the garden of eden
[5:41] the first woman preacher came on the
[5:44] scene
[5:48] because the first preacher was adam
[6:17] he had a
[6:25] [Music]
[6:33] and just because she was co-equal with
[6:36] aaron
[6:38] can you people see the spirit of lady
[6:43] ocean
[6:53] i remember i don't know how many of you
[6:54] knew who billie jean king was and you
[6:57] know
[7:00] to you and on her day she was one of the
[7:02] best woman tennis players
[7:09] and she loved it for equal payment on
[7:12] the on the tournament
[7:41] that spirit of lady ocean didn't come in
[7:44] the seven church age it was there since
[7:47] the beginning
[7:52] so she said if you preach to me i have
[7:55] the right to preach to you also
[8:01] and besides i have more wisdom than you
[8:04] do
[8:07] of course he wasn't telling
[8:11] because allah teacher of the serpent was
[8:13] satan who was perfect in wisdom
[8:22] he was the one that prayed to eve the
[8:25] elf working pretty cool ever
[8:30] he then
[8:32] he told me
[8:34] that if i were rid of the fruit my eyes
[8:37] would be open
[8:46] [Music]
[8:52] venom
[8:53] adam said i wonder what it is all about
[9:02] and brother says that adam was tempering
[9:06] he
[10:02] abraham would have been lost a long time
[10:05] ago
[10:16] but in pre-figure it was christ
[10:22] galatians 3 15.
[10:31] brethren i speak after the manner of man
[10:34] though he'd be but a man's covenant yet
[10:37] if it be confirmed no man dis analyse
[10:41] or add us there too hermanos hablando de
[10:44] interminus
[10:54] now to abraham and his seed were the
[10:57] promises made he says not end to seeds
[11:02] as of many but as of one into thy seed
[11:05] which is christ
[11:26] and we've been dead in christ
[11:30] and baptized into his body
[11:33] we are abraham's seed
[11:37] and our ears of the promise
[11:41] so how are you ever going to fall
[11:47] if god made the promise to you
[11:52] so how are you ever going to backslide
[12:08] well you say can we backslide us
[12:14] absolutely absolutely
[12:16] because the prophet told us that we
[12:18] backslide every day
[12:35] because abraham and them got it
[12:41] and you will get it also
[12:47] but knowledge
[12:50] it's just not that easy
[12:53] here's what the prophet said
[12:57] and because of that
[13:00] don't you think that you have the right
[13:02] to sin
[13:03] you know
[13:17] you rip what you
[13:47] tubs where they would wash all the
[13:48] clothes in the old time that's what you
[13:50] reap
[13:54] it
[13:55] does not mean that you are in love
[14:20] [Music]
[14:28] not only bible studies
[14:32] because the pastor gives tremendous
[14:34] teachings
[14:40] the first words that i read about the
[14:42] minister
[14:56] he does not give you the right to sin
[15:01] it means that you are lost
[15:05] let us go back to hebrews 6 verse 4.
[15:14] for it is impossible for those who were
[15:17] once enlightened and have tasted of the
[15:20] heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[15:23] the holy ghost
[15:35] if they shall fall away
[15:38] or have tasted the good word of god in
[15:41] the power of the world to come yes
[15:49] if they shall fall away to renew them
[15:51] again until repentance seeing they
[15:54] crucified to themselves the son of god
[15:57] afraid and put him to an open shame
[16:17] i got a phone call about
[16:19] four days ago i
[17:01] he said do you believe that we'll be
[17:04] living the earth forever
[17:10] if you do the will of god
[17:14] but not on this earth it's going to be
[17:16] cleaned
[17:27] and he said he started saying that he
[17:30] was going to be 144 000.
[17:36] and i said do you know that those
[17:39] 144 000 is not the gentiles
[17:57] he said
[17:59] there is no jew that is going to be
[18:01] saved
[18:04] don't you know that the jews
[18:07] rejected christ
[18:12] and then he said i'm going to tell you
[18:14] something you probably don't know
[18:19] oh i said that guy is barking up the
[18:22] wrong trees
[18:40] is
[18:44] and he started to
[18:46] to explain about mount zion in 144 000
[19:49] and this is
[19:50] one of the things that we were talking
[19:52] about
[19:55] the bible says that all of israel
[20:00] israel
[20:02] is not israel
[20:15] so if all israel will be saved
[20:52] and remember brother says we are not
[20:55] talking about the wall street group
[21:00] is the wall street
[21:02] so then in town says how do we become
[21:06] israel
[21:09] israel
[21:10] being dead in christ
[21:14] take on abraham
[21:46] if you don't walk up to the correction
[21:49] when you do something wrong
[21:56] cristiano god will warn you just about
[22:00] their teeth and then if you don't take
[22:02] the warnings
[22:04] at their tension
[22:06] we're gonna go into something good
[22:09] he will take
[22:19] a preacher friend
[22:21] of brother brethren oh amigos
[22:30] and he went to a a
[22:33] service station a
[22:35] man who used to service his car foreign
[22:50] [Music]
[22:53] and he was a close friend of brother
[22:55] brennan
[22:58] and brother
[23:00] when he came from the
[23:01] meetings overseas
[23:05] he went to select service his car
[23:10] says how are you
[23:12] brother ramsey
[23:16] he said i am doing fine
[23:19] he said i would like for next time i go
[23:22] to overseas that you go with me
[23:28] no he says i wouldn't go oh
[23:31] you know
[23:32] how come you don't want to go
[24:12] [Music]
[24:29] i know you were just joking the other
[24:43] he said if i love god i would be a
[24:45] christian
[24:47] christian
[24:49] brother branham
[24:56] so this dr ramsey he hired a colored
[24:59] brother
[25:04] and one one day on the holidays
[25:10] the liquor stores were closed where he
[25:32] go across the river and bring me a case
[25:35] of beer
[25:36] [Music]
[26:09] and he started getting sick
[26:15] and started going down
[26:19] and he died
[26:22] now i ask the question to you people
[26:27] what's this man saying
[26:31] and the reason that i tell you this
[26:36] years ago in in the church in silver
[26:39] city
[26:42] even before
[26:45] [Music]
[26:48] and i'm not going to mention names
[27:42] you really have to go into the into the
[27:44] message and scriptures and do
[27:46] [Music]
[28:14] doing those
[28:42] the scripture
[29:25] people
[29:35] you want to know why
[29:38] yes
[30:40] [Music]
[30:48] i believe brother ramsay was saved
[30:50] you're croquet lemon ramsestava salvo
[30:53] and one of the main reasons
[30:58] that he was taken of the scene
[31:16] and many even in
[31:31] sanctified him
[31:34] and he counted the covenant an unholy
[31:38] thing
[31:42] and because what he was doing
[32:12] he
[32:34] [Music]
[32:40] nothing in
[32:50] but if you are really truly a child of
[32:53] god
[33:09] you because
[33:10] you fall down
[33:14] you'll condemn me if you stay there
[33:18] but you get off and says i'm going ahead
[33:21] this is
[33:32] and this i say that the covenant that
[33:35] was confirmed before of god in christ
[33:38] the law which was four hundred and
[33:41] thirty years
[33:42] after cannot disannounce
[33:45] that it should make the promise of
[33:47] non-effect
[33:50] ratification
[34:01] the law came after they left egypt
[34:10] for if the inheritance be of the law
[34:13] it is no more of promise but god gave it
[34:17] to abraham by promise
[34:35] [Music]
[34:46] romans 4 13. romano
[34:53] for the promise
[34:55] that he should be the heir of the world
[34:57] was not to abraham or to his seed
[35:01] through the law but through the
[35:04] righteousness of faith
[35:17] for they which are of the law be heirs
[35:20] faith is made void
[35:24] and the promise made of non-effective
[35:36] because the law worketh wrath
[35:39] but where no law is there is no
[35:41] transgression was
[35:50] therefore it is a faith that it might be
[35:53] by grace to the end the promise might be
[35:56] true to all the seed not to that only
[35:59] which is of the law but that also which
[36:02] is of the faith of abraham who is the
[36:05] father of
[36:07] allah
[36:24] not anything you do
[36:26] or any law or joining church
[36:33] it was a grace act of god
[36:39] galatians 3 19.
[36:42] destiny
[36:59] yeah go ahead okay wherefore didn't
[37:01] serve the law it was added because of
[37:03] transgressions till the seed should come
[37:05] to whom the promise was made and it was
[37:08] ordained by angels in the land
[37:10] of a mediator
[37:29] it was added to serve until the seed
[37:32] came
[37:47] and in the hands of a
[37:58] whereas by one man's disobedience many
[38:01] were made sinners so by the obedience of
[38:04] one shall many be made righteous
[38:16] foreign
[38:22] moreover the law entered the the offense
[38:25] might abound but for sin about abounded
[38:29] grace did much more
[38:44] reigned unto death even so my grace
[38:48] reigns through righteousness unto
[38:51] eternal life by jesus christ our lord
[38:57] has
[39:08] for when god made promise to abraham
[39:10] because he could swear by no greater he
[39:13] swear by himself
[39:22] so you people can understand
[39:26] let us go back to galatians 3 16.
[39:32] now to abraham and his seed were the
[39:35] promises
[39:36] made he said not and to sit
[39:39] a plural as many many bodies of one and
[39:43] thy seed which is christ
[40:08] now the seed of abraham was one
[40:11] of the abram
[40:12] which was christ in three figures
[40:16] but abraham had many children
[40:21] he had one before he made head isaac
[40:27] which showed that sarah was sleeping
[40:33] to sleep
[40:50] because he wanted hagar to bring the
[40:53] child
[40:56] thinking that he was too old
[41:00] and for god to bypass and make some
[41:04] other way
[41:56] and they are at war all the time
[42:45] because thou has kept the word of my
[42:48] patience
[42:49] i also will keep thee from the hour of
[42:52] temptation we shall come i will come
[42:54] upon all the world to try them
[43:09] what does he mean by the word of his
[43:11] passion
[43:15] after he had patiently endured
[43:18] especially
[43:22] he obtained the promise of
[43:26] you see the spirit is speaking about the
[43:30] word of god
[43:33] which is given to us
[43:36] who wait for the fulfillment of the
[43:39] world
[43:42] it requires patience
[43:46] yes did in the case of abraham
[43:50] why if god fulfills his word
[43:56] [Music]
[44:06] when we pray for you
[44:10] you'll come here in church to the altar
[44:14] and some you can get your healing you
[44:17] don't have to come to the front just by
[44:18] sitting there yeah
[44:34] then
[44:50] [Music]
[45:01] hebrews 11 17.
[45:08] by faith abraham
[45:10] when he was tried
[45:11] offered up isaac and he did receive the
[45:14] promises offered of his only begotten
[45:44] there
[46:28] and today we are all overcome with
[46:31] impatience
[46:36] hebrews 6 16
[46:39] says he
[46:40] says for men barely swear by the greater
[46:44] and he knows for confirmation is to them
[46:47] and end of all stripes
[47:21] it tells what you are
[48:16] that's why brother branham priest the
[48:18] lady of the prayers
[48:31] be sure that your sins
[48:33] don't
[48:34] find you out
[48:39] because your life always reflects what's
[48:41] inside of you
[48:46] so it's
[49:01] all the answers
[49:04] saint john 5 24. san juan capital
[49:10] verily verily i said to you he that
[49:13] speaks in tongues
[49:20] [Music]
[50:53] immutable things in which it was
[50:55] impossible for god to lie we might have
[50:59] a strong consolation who have fled for
[51:02] refuge to lake hold upon the hope set
[51:05] before us
[51:06] those
[51:36] god is not a man that he should lie
[51:39] neither the son of man that he should
[51:40] repent has his seed
[51:43] said and shall he not do it or has he
[51:46] spoken and shall he not make it good
[52:12] as an anchor of the soul
[52:15] both sure and steadfast
[52:17] which
[52:41] the veil is what keeps us from seeing
[52:44] god it
[52:54] the veil is what keeps us from seeing
[52:57] the angels at their
[53:04] [Music]
[53:11] [Music]
[54:08] i told you
[54:17] the angels of the lord in campus run
[54:20] above them that fear him and deliver
[54:47] the veil is what keeps us from living
[54:50] the way
[55:17] and when the veil was turned into
[55:22] what happened
[55:27] when the bell was turned into
[55:32] god became god again
[55:39] and he raised up the veil that he hid
[55:42] himself
[55:47] that's the resurrection of the lord
[55:49] jesus christ
[55:52] proven to us
[55:55] that in this veil that we're here now
[56:00] is
[56:56] down
[56:59] in flesh
[57:02] to show himself
[57:05] he had to hide himself yes
[57:08] condescending because we could not see
[57:10] him
[58:19] but the spirit of the living god
[58:23] that dwells in here
[58:26] he calls those things which were not as
[58:29] though they were
[58:34] so if god
[58:37] [Music]
[59:55] because they want to be with us as much
[59:58] as
[1:00:28] amen
[1:00:30] the insurance agent
[1:00:32] went to sell insurance to brother
[1:00:34] brenham
