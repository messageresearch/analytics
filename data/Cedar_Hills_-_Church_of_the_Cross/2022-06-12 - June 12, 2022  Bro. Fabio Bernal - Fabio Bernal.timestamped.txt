[42:01] with the opportunity that he's given me
[42:03] to fulfill a desire in my heart
[42:08] to know and to see the mountain with it
[42:10] was written
[42:11] the william brangham the name of reset
[42:14] william branham and the three stages of
[42:16] his ministry
[42:19] yellowstone park
[42:28] biblical sign for the cleansing of the
[42:30] earth for the millennium
[42:33] olympia
[42:36] that the volcano will cleanse
[42:42] but don't don't worry it's not now
[42:46] but it's best to line up and and to
[42:49] straight up
[42:52] because then we'll be affected by that
[42:54] we must be in
[43:00] then we we
[43:02] went to the place where
[43:04] in the map where he shows the
[43:06] position
[43:08] montana
[43:19] you can see that on the west side you
[43:20] can see the profile of the prophet
[43:22] looking down towards california
[43:24] is on the
[43:25] but in the lower part of his face that's
[43:27] where that mountain range is it says
[43:33] now that kind of spooks people
[43:35] it's almost fanaticos the word fanatics
[43:52] and
[43:53] jumps and dances because he likes it
[43:57] wouldn't you like to go to the glory of
[43:59] god
[44:02] don't wait for it up there yeah yes
[44:04] he has descended
[44:12] many are waiting for the glory of god
[44:14] when the glory of god is already here
[44:18] all that was in heaven
[45:02] uh
[45:11] and years do bring very wonderful things
[45:14] yes
[45:16] and
[45:16] experience it's a little individual it
[45:18] is an individual
[45:24] that is marked by the years
[45:29] that's what the old timers would say
[46:21] but the house of prayer is here
[46:38] there's people that don't like to go to
[46:39] church
[46:51] is
[46:57] when someone is afraid of something it's
[46:58] because you owe something
[47:01] if i don't know
[47:02] why would i worry
[47:06] but when you know that there is prince
[47:08] against you
[47:11] you're trying to jump around so they
[47:13] don't catch your prince
[47:20] it is a pleasure to be with you
[47:34] [Applause]
[47:36] by
[47:38] [Applause]
[47:42] and we want to speak a little bit today
[47:46] about the day that we live in
[47:48] while
[47:50] the events
[48:16] jesus said me and my father
[48:29] but jesus has not said that you are his
[48:37] there are things that are near that goes
[48:39] our common distance
[48:41] oh there's things that bring us closer
[48:42] to the things that bring us apart
[48:46] to the same journey of faith
[48:49] so it is necessary
[48:53] problem says to know the day and the
[48:55] hour
[48:56] that we're living in
[48:59] in god's time
[49:14] is revealed to the bride foreign by the
[49:17] prophet of god
[49:26] and if you have a petition in your soul
[49:54] that you are inviting us to your house
[49:56] this morning
[50:00] to give us the well-being and the
[50:01] eternal security okay
[50:06] where there is a joy in the heart of the
[50:08] believers
[50:12] [Music]
[50:24] bring us to your
[52:19] in the book of matthew
[52:51] finally my brethren be strong in the
[52:53] lord and in the power of his might
[52:57] vestigo de toda
[53:04] put on the whole armor of god that ye
[53:06] may be able to stand against the wilds
[53:08] of the devil
[53:11] contrast
[53:24] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[53:26] blood but against principalities against
[53:28] powers against the rulers of darkness of
[53:30] this world and spiritual weakness in
[53:32] high places
[53:43] wherefore
[53:44] take unto you the whole armor of god
[53:46] that you may be able to withstand in the
[53:48] evil day and having done all to stand
[53:51] hold
[53:53] on
[54:08] again the devil taken him up into
[54:11] exceedingly high mountain and showed of
[54:13] him all the kingdoms of the world and
[54:15] the glory of them
[54:20] and he saith unto him all these things
[54:22] will i give thee if thou will fall down
[54:24] and worship me
[54:29] there's a little too much they don't
[54:31] know
[54:33] but he didn't know the answer
[54:35] had for him
[54:51] one of the things that catches my
[54:52] attention
[54:56] is that a certain word is used too much
[54:59] system
[55:05] and i ask do people know what a system
[55:07] is
[55:09] what system are you in
[55:11] why do you look for a system
[55:14] what does the system mean means
[55:32] i have a system politico politico
[55:35] religious economic economic or financial
[55:40] importance
[55:41] and jesus as you said i don't care about
[55:43] the system
[55:45] or my system is not of this world
[55:51] so many originally
[55:54] they said
[55:55] brother where are you going to go to
[55:56] school for i'm going to go learn
[55:59] our system should learn how to lie
[56:14] do you know that god has a computer
[56:15] called william branham
[56:18] and what you put there he comes up
[56:21] what you search for
[56:29] to get accustomed to the system of a
[56:30] prophet
[56:32] the system of a pastor
[56:34] the system of the holy spirit
[56:36] it's not easy
[56:40] because that system does not agree with
[56:41] your system
[56:43] for the system of god
[56:45] it's not of this world
[56:54] of satan does that the subject that i
[56:56] want to speak on
[57:06] but world is a system
[57:40] a matter is is related within itself
[57:49] so any movement anything is to be
[57:51] intertwined
[57:59] also means a compilation of things
[58:02] that related within themselves are they
[58:05] not i mean orderly
[58:20] he wanted
[58:38] the first thing that he looked for was
[58:40] allies
[58:44] because a system does not work without
[58:46] allies
[59:01] nothing can move
[59:06] the first
[59:07] thing the saint wanted to do was to find
[59:08] alliances
[59:12] with the most important that god had
[59:15] miguel which was michael
[59:43] then a prophet is the mind of christ
[59:47] and a pastor is the mind
[59:51] and the church is the mind of his pastor
[59:58] so when someone says the prophet
[1:00:00] me
[1:00:01] no your pastor will present you
[1:00:05] prophet
[1:00:07] said the order is
[1:00:10] that the
[1:00:12] the messenger
[1:00:58] and christ presents them to the father
[1:01:01] he says this you gave me
[1:01:04] and no one ever was lost
[1:01:08] because the system of god now
[1:01:10] didn't permit okay
[1:01:12] that nothing will come out
[1:01:15] but
[1:01:16] that will go from here
[1:01:18] that's what he needed
[1:01:37] because they have a lot of allies
[1:01:42] what's happening
[1:01:43] right now
[1:01:46] with the world the g20
[1:01:49] organization
[1:02:00] because you have enough water at home
[1:02:02] and you have enough with that
[1:02:04] oh
[1:02:28] and then we write where we wrote that
[1:02:49] and those that are around a pastor if
[1:02:51] they're not born again they're the worst
[1:02:53] politicians
[1:02:58] the ones that change that give opinions
[1:03:01] [Music]
[1:03:11] there is an assembly to to fix the
[1:03:13] damage
[1:04:10] it
[1:04:36] and after the heat goes through then
[1:04:37] you're in worse condition
[1:04:51] but if you eat slow you're still gonna
[1:04:53] look enough
[1:04:56] whether you eat at home or in a
[1:04:57] restaurant you pay more in the
[1:04:59] restaurant
[1:05:02] that's why i like to eat at home because
[1:05:03] it's cheaper
[1:05:51] a different future than the one you have
[1:05:52] in your in your brain
[1:05:57] take that trash out and show you reality
[1:06:01] that was shown to us by a prophet
[1:06:05] the world is a tangle
[1:06:08] and the devil dances
[1:06:11] and you end up drunk in hell
[1:06:15] [Music]
[1:06:32] if you say something that makes sense
[1:06:33] you know where you're going
[1:06:42] the greatest
[1:06:43] mystery i have discovered
[1:06:59] that's why when jesus knew who he was
[1:07:04] because he jesus came and suffered until
[1:07:06] he learned who he was
[1:07:09] then he fulfilled his purpose
[1:07:12] when you discover who you are
[1:07:15] you also fulfill your purpose
[1:07:20] there are people with purpose with our
[1:07:22] goals
[1:07:26] el zero
[1:07:38] is satan and discernment wrapped
[1:07:46] money
[1:07:48] and poverty
[1:07:49] on a serpent
[1:08:21] so the world is is a system that is
[1:08:23] moved by the police
[1:08:25] but the religious the economic and
[1:08:27] financial dominion
[1:08:30] call the cosmos
[1:08:34] dominato so this world is dominating
[1:08:48] you are in one of those three
[1:09:32] the church
[1:10:09] [Applause]
[1:10:28] because you without money you don't even
[1:10:30] get robbed
[1:10:34] because the ones that are wrong
[1:10:41] they know who has it where they where
[1:10:43] they where they put their money
[1:10:49] and the one that has it is always
[1:10:50] worried that somebody's going to take it
[1:10:52] from him
[1:10:56] that's why god calls
[1:11:27] he called us out of this system
[1:11:30] and he took us to heavenly places
[1:11:33] in christ jesus
[1:11:35] our lord
[1:12:02] and he said let's become partners
[1:12:59] what
[1:13:01] matthew 4
[1:13:24] how many know that satan is actually
[1:13:26] friendly
[1:13:29] because the people don't know
[1:13:51] you're walking uh with him just holding
[1:13:54] him by his arms
[1:14:09] m

[1:15:54] and the parents said well he told me he
[1:15:55] didn't do it
[1:15:58] is that the children has become more
[1:16:01] shrewd than you that are
[1:16:03] el diablo

[1:17:26] because she doesn't it doesn't know if

[1:20:12] says the devil controls all world
[1:20:14] systems get control of his
[1:20:28] but this political religion and this
[1:20:31] this uh two-point tongue
[1:20:35] control
[1:20:38] the devil controls all world systems
[1:20:45] and the nations he controls him until
[1:20:47] until god
[1:20:48] sets his kingdom
[1:20:52] he got my attention
[1:20:59] the god doesn't interfere or gets in any
[1:21:01] of satan's systems
[1:21:06] he has to take your problem
[1:21:09] because he programmed me to cry out to
[1:21:12] me

[1:21:30] the systems of satan

[1:24:48] el diablo universal he is universal
[1:24:55] el nacional
[1:25:07] many people think there's gonna be way
[1:25:08] out there somewhere god's gonna do
[1:25:09] tremendous things
[1:25:59] you are working for satan
[1:26:21] drink or or or or smoke or i didn't go
[1:26:24] out with older or younger women
[1:26:27] i was always studying
[1:26:30] a day i had an experience
[1:26:46] at times he will test his students in
[1:26:47] the office where we work
[1:26:54] when i got there to the podium my titans
[1:26:57] officina then the magistrate was
[1:27:00] and the students were here in the four
[1:27:02] years
[1:27:05] and i was praying and reading the
[1:27:07] message
[1:27:09] no i don't remember only god knows
[1:27:12] what happened
[1:27:16] i
[1:27:30] looking at
[1:27:44] they told them what they saw
[1:27:49] and they said this man is convinced
[1:27:52] of what he believes
[1:28:26] and he was a denominational preacher
[1:28:30] and he said i know you believe in
[1:28:33] william branham
[1:28:40] and he said and what if he no seriously
[1:28:42] bill's in about 77 wouldn't he be a
[1:28:45] false prophet
[1:28:48] and i said neither he is a false prophet
[1:28:50] or neither will this fail
[1:28:54] he was predicting events
[1:28:57] not the coming of jesus
[1:29:03] that's right
[1:29:11] the reason why i want to talk to you is
[1:29:12] because you are are truly a servant of
[1:29:14] god
[1:29:16] and i asked him how do you know this
[1:29:21] he said because this morning when you
[1:29:22] came out of the elevator
[1:29:25] and you went on the hallway to your
[1:29:26] office
[1:29:31] was following you through the hallway
[1:29:33] [Applause]
[1:29:47] and he said no don't don't get all
[1:29:49] swollen up in your shirt here with what
[1:29:51] i'm going to tell you
[1:29:55] but that helped me to be more humble
[1:29:57] from that day
[1:30:01] many more experiences that i had
[1:30:16] is
[1:30:47] in the world and the nations until god
[1:30:50] sets his kingdom
[1:30:53] the most sublime thing is
[1:30:54] this message is the seal
[1:30:56] of the kingdom of god
[1:30:58] diablo so the devil no puerto rico
[1:31:11] [Music]
[1:31:29] so how many are now in the kingdom
[1:31:32] no not in the kingdom of god
[1:31:35] but it isn't the kingdom of heaven
[1:31:39] the kingdom of god and he doesn't share
[1:31:41] that with nobody
[1:32:37] if you do an upright job
[1:32:46] i work
[1:32:47] in one of the most corrupt uh judicial
[1:32:50] systems
[1:32:56] 48 years ago to release a drug dealer
[1:33:04] was worth 500 million pesos
[1:33:12] at that time dollar was 200 pesos now
[1:33:14] it's about 4 000 pesos
[1:33:16] so at that time was a lot of money
[1:33:23] one sentence just to give him room to
[1:33:25] escape the country
[1:33:34] and to see a lot of unrighteousness
[1:33:42] so the kingdom of satan is politics
[1:33:44] religion
[1:33:47] e
[1:33:47] echo
[1:34:00] because the lord says here
[1:34:15] that
[1:34:16] are co
[1:34:17] dressed with the code of righteousness
[1:34:20] [Music]
[1:34:21] which is doing what is right
[1:34:27] they used to call me
[1:34:30] and i could be
[1:34:44] in
[1:34:52] and i have to say well i'm sorry but i
[1:34:55] cannot
[1:35:12] and the president was part of the
[1:35:13] uncovered for them
[1:35:18] and then he offered this
[1:35:20] office where a lot of money comes in he
[1:35:22] offered this position to my boss
[1:35:34] if you love me you don't take this offer
[1:35:37] and give this to somebody
[1:35:39] he went and talked to his wife
[1:35:45] but my assistant told me this
[1:35:49] and the wife said do what he you know
[1:35:52] if you don't want to
[1:35:54] end up in jail or dead
[1:36:05] so i know what moves within that system
[1:36:22] as the god of this perverse age and
[1:36:25] sweden in his eating domina he dominates
[1:36:29] conestas especially with this
[1:36:33] specialties
[1:36:36] if you want to be a doctor especially
[1:36:38] you have to do certain specialties
[1:36:42] specialists
[1:36:44] is not just to examine
[1:36:47] everything but only those things that he
[1:36:49] becomes
[1:36:50] becomes
[1:37:18] because it's all
[1:37:46] you
[1:38:05] they are dumber than we are
[1:38:10] and they were right
[1:38:14] in the garage
[1:38:17] instead of becoming psychologists they
[1:38:18] became they became ecologists
[1:38:23] i finished with this i have a lot to say
[1:38:28] just changed my style of preaching
[1:38:37] because he has a dominion
[1:38:41] and he has a structure to handle this
[1:38:48] the dominion was staying with his
[1:38:49] politics
[1:38:53] the first thing he uses is politics
[1:38:56] for assad
[1:38:58] and politics is to disguise the truth
[1:39:01] with the lie
[1:39:07] have you ever gone to to to place
[1:39:10] the custom parties or someone
[1:39:12] [Music]
[1:39:14] who who's their own
[1:39:18] question
[1:39:19] takes the mask off and you know it's
[1:39:20] such and such son
[1:39:24] el domino
[1:39:35] he doesn't present himself less than
[1:39:37] what he wants to be as a
[1:40:04] but here is as the lord orders he said
[1:40:05] get rid of that because no you're going
[1:40:08] to die
[1:40:19] if you remember the story of neyman
[1:40:24] the the queen
[1:40:26] with neyman
[1:40:33] us with this message we're going to hang
[1:40:35] saying
[1:40:38] because i would like to see him hang him
[1:40:40] and see that how he's sticking that
[1:40:42] tongue out
[1:40:43] don't you want to see that
[1:41:00] the person is so nervous to to to be
[1:41:19] try to find the what's known as the
[1:41:21] queen
[1:41:22] and they don't find it
[1:41:25] so what they they they plant
[1:41:28] and where there's the outdoors
[1:41:30] everything can be in favor
[1:41:35] or wasn't that what satan do
[1:41:38] he didn't deceive her
[1:41:40] but she put her in
[1:41:42] and
[1:41:43] took her to the deceit
[1:41:51] we as pastors shepherds themselves
[1:42:23] not of gossipers
[1:42:29] [Applause]
[1:42:38] [Applause]
[1:43:20] and forgive me i wasn't going to go in
[1:43:22] there but i'm talking about politics
[1:43:25] oh tell me if it's not politics
[1:43:34] i talked to about the five years he
[1:43:35] didn't tell me what i want i want
[1:43:41] and if the other minister who tells him
[1:43:43] the same thing then they said i'm going
[1:43:44] to look for another church
[1:43:50] satan's eating is full of churches that
[1:43:52] offer the holy spirit
[1:43:54] but this message is the truth
[1:43:57] and he offers
[1:43:59] eternal life
[1:44:02] with all the wishy-washy here
[1:44:17] do you know where you go when you said
[1:44:19] you go to church
[1:44:26] brother branham said this is your your
[1:44:28] judgment uh tribunal for your eternal
[1:44:31] distress
[1:45:14] there's a call today
[1:45:18] two or three come usually the same
[1:45:24] and the other ones
[1:45:25] oh they're not right
[1:45:28] now
[1:46:09] but the first thing that parents think
[1:46:10] of their children is not to be born
[1:46:11] again but to
[1:46:13] you're going to go to you're going to
[1:46:14] study
[1:46:22] i want you to see a doctor to be able to
[1:46:50] they won't have a specialist class
[1:47:42] make it a little easier so i said well
[1:47:43] what do you become a specialist if
[1:47:44] you're doing the same thing
[1:47:50] so what they really need is just to pick
[1:47:52] up dummies because the universities
[1:48:31] but first confess your sin
[1:48:34] and you
[1:48:35] you'll be healed
[1:48:38] you don't need specialists for that no
[1:48:41] but sincerity
[1:49:06] they don't go to church because their
[1:49:07] children have to go to school
[1:49:28] because whatever she learned at the
[1:49:29] beginning 60 years later she doesn't
[1:49:31] remember where it was
[1:49:38] learn to live with what god gives us
[1:49:48] and i've been telling you this for a
[1:49:50] while but i'll finish with this
[1:49:52] education
[1:50:08] just
[1:50:54] the even the teacher had to go birth put
[1:50:56] it because he didn't have enough to buy
[1:50:58] shoes
[1:51:02] but they all taught us more
[1:51:15] respect honor
[1:51:20] now go see if you find that in school
[1:51:22] today
[1:51:27] we came out better educated
[1:51:31] and with better diplomacy
[1:51:36] because the the the best uh uh
[1:51:39] certificate is your life not a paper
[1:51:42] hanging on the wall
[1:51:45] many times you get professions to be
[1:51:47] specialized in something
[1:51:51] hospitality
[1:51:53] take a nurse that's been working for 20
[1:51:55] years and they will know more about the
[1:51:56] dead and living
[1:52:25] [Music]
[1:52:29] and
[1:52:30] and if someone uh dies a patient dies or
[1:52:33] to on a nurse
[1:52:40] he did something else and he killed them
[1:52:53] the person says i need someone that
[1:52:54] speaks to me more theologically
[1:53:04] only the true experience with god will
[1:53:05] give you a change in your life
[1:53:08] what the scripture says
[1:53:26] wants to make you a scientist
[1:53:28] investigator
[1:53:30] search god see if he exists
[1:54:30] yes
[1:54:36] it's the gospel of a farmer that i
[1:54:38] learned
[1:54:39] of brother william branham scientific
[1:54:41] scientist he has activated
[1:54:43] specialization and the scientists they
[1:54:45] want to become
[1:54:49] the the doctor in your town will charge
[1:54:51] you ten dollars
[1:54:54] now that he took another class now he
[1:54:56] charges 50.
[1:55:00] he becomes a specialist of something
[1:55:02] else
[1:55:28] said how much did it cost you just to
[1:55:29] boil some water and put this little
[1:55:30] earth
[1:55:33] scientist
[1:55:34] scientific that's why everything is
[1:55:36] unique
[1:55:38] and a scientist
[1:55:40] goes so high up that he loses
[1:55:43] his behavior
[1:56:14] [Music]
[1:56:40] forgot the principles
[1:56:46] what happens
[1:56:54] if you talk to me too loud i'm going to
[1:56:55] sue you
[1:56:57] [Music]
[1:57:05] in the run to the pastor
[1:57:08] i said
[1:57:21] only have one advice
[1:57:35] of the word of god
[1:57:50] or respect anymore
[1:57:58] now what closes the cycle is corruption
[1:58:01] oh yes
[1:58:02] it's the time of corruption like never
[1:58:04] before
[1:58:06] if you borrow something
[1:58:10] don't forget brothers that i've loaned
[1:58:12] you this money but at this percentage
[1:58:17] and they take advantage of the needs of
[1:58:20] others
[1:58:23] they ask him a favor
[1:58:24] nothing
[1:58:25] i don't have
