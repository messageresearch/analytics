to give a little bit more of what we started on Wednesday pray that the Lord will bring it in such a way and hold it with everything that sometimes but praise the Lord thank you thank you without you here will be no reason to preach the Lord Jesus will consider a new art subject the groaning creature so I don't mind all right let's open our Bibles to Psalms 38. how many brought your swords this morning Lord All My Desire is before and my groaning is not hidden from lordy in your Jesus and that means oh Lord Alma as the psalmist said unto their inspiration of your Holy Spirit um in our groanings it's not hidden we just thank you Lord for that says we enter into your words we ask it all on the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ yes I'm kind of somewhere else already you just pray for me that God will help the Lord I sure can't be nothing without him as we started the other day and we we left off and we were in Romans 8. and let's go back there again amen and we're gonna go back to first night Romans 8 19. woman for the earnest expectation of the future wait for the manifestation is notice in Spanish as we stated the other day in Spanish it says that ardent desire in Spanish that Ardent groaning is Grande that the creation knows this creature knows that without the manifestation of the sons of God is things will never be the way they were in the Garden of Eden this planet Earth that groans also for the manifestation of the sons of God is such a point that one day it will explode from within to cleanse all the impurities all the curse of sins it's groaning for us and you know that word creature there there the original formation is so without this creature being formed first there would never be a creation how many believe that that is being formed on the inside of you by the Holy Spirit foreign praise the Lord Jesus then we went into that word waiting yeah that verse down there says in verse 20 I believe 22 verse or verse it's no it's actually the same verse the creature waits for the manifestation is we're waiting for it but we found out that the Greek word there does not mean just sitting around waiting for something to happen but this creature this expectation is expectativa this Ardent desire is that this creature has makes them expect fully for it to happen it's not that it's waiting the way we think of the word waiting but because that Ardent desire that the other word was intense was an intense anticipation this creature this new birth is once it's born in you if you water that desire if you water that seed that's in your heart that desire has to grow oh my aren't you happy for that this morning you know I would like to go back to the quote we left the other day out of identified with Christo and you remember the scripture we quoted as as we go there is no this is not yeah okay anyway my thought left that's okay identified with Christ I've got it here it's paragraph 75 it says I call it B because there's two parts of the paragraphs but I challenge you tonight identify yourself with Jesus Christ and his death and in his resurrection and see where you'll be at the resurrection for if we suffer with him we shall reign with him God has given us the promise God has given us the promise let's repeat this together too my whole desire is to be like him my God is so good let's go down here to the end of paragraph 775 with Christo the very end of the paragraph is and it's no more than what is right it's no more than our duty to look at these things and to see these desires that we have that God put in us to create in us to make us want to be like him but I said oh my so we see that these desires it makes us want to be like him it's not that he's forcing us to be like him but this desires that he's creating in US it makes us want to be like him we realize that we're not like him talking about this fellow here is just Renegade this guy that I had a sour note there or what is praise the Lord I'm taking a little more time this morning I I just I I got so away from myself this morning at about three o'clock three o'clock in the morning president and I saw myself and I saw certain things happening it wasn't a vision I was actually taken here so I'm having a hard time just trying to keep myself out of the way because this morning at least for me and I believe for many of you we are going into a place we've never how many would like to go foreign the cup says he just finished saying creating in US these desires to make us want to be like him yeah and now if you can see it by faith before the real desire and Strikes wow if you can see it in other words you can't manifest it yet really hasn't taken over yet but if you can see it by revelations before before and I would invite anyone this morning that this is your first time here or you haven't surrendered your life to the Lord and been baptized I would encourage you with this is now if you can see it by faith before the real desire strikes come forward and be identified in him accept him with all your heart accepted so how is he gonna create this desire in us how more or what else can he use to create this desire in us it's his word in in a Libro it's his word and you know as I mentioned Wednesday a statement that our pastor made under the anointing how that coldness was coming in the church you know our enemy he's he's a pro let's throw an Amigos professional man he's got a lot of experience as far as time over 6 000 years before that you can't even count it because he came from eternity so what I saw on the people what I saw in a lot of our young people okay is that you come to certain stages you accept the Lord you get baptized you're just so in love with the Lord here we pray the Holy Ghost descends it feels so incredible how many have felt that way raise your hand you just man you're in cloud nine or you're walking in heaven or whatever you want to call it right you say devil nasty come on big boy you man you're you're strutting along there that's que pasa it goes through a period of time you feel numb is do you think what why do I feel this way did anybody spelled that way like if you were alone or you don't feel his presence like before because as humans we like to feel his presence not just in our souls but when our bodies experiences his presence it makes us feel so secure it's like he's not even there is all you know is there is what happened you know why he's doing that he's getting you into a state where your senses stand up because he has another sense he wants you to be conscious of his presence and every moment of your life and him understanding how we are he knows we love to be able to pick it up with our five energy to the body to receive smell share your taste all of it and as a spiritual being we like we like to to remember that what he did last week we like to reason within ourselves and we say oh I feel so much better why didn't I feel this way before and then our imagination oh we can begin to see ourselves walk on streets of gold in business we loved for these senses to help us pick up the presence of God but God says children where I'm taking you I didn't design these sensors to take you there has to be something else that will take you into a realm with God can't believe that all things are possible are you with me so far because now we're going to go back into eternity brother what are you talking about you're gonna die right here in the Pulpit or what I don't care in the Revelation that's what happened to me at three o'clock in the morning and waiting on the Lord because there's something that's what happens then I just saw I just saw I saw a lot of most of you there is and I saw you gathered around and you had your heads towards heaven and you had your hearts open you had your hands raised to the heavens with one of us you said Lord Jesus in your Jesus this morning up in the office that I could had a hard time staying there you know I don't know if you understand me well just pray for me but there's something going on here now let's go to the scriptures as we begin to see how we were formed and God Indios and the great Eternal Spirits as he changed from being Elohim interest that existed of himself and by himself and he changes to the Lord is my Jehovah's Witnesses they say they're your friends brother because I'm an original Jehovah Witness original now God was not going to be by himself anymore but he didn't just want to produce just anything he wanted to make sure that what came out of him would have the potentials so he could have fellowship with his children so that he could have fellowship with himself with parts of himself he's known Lucifer was there he knew he was watching everything he knew Lucifer was gonna get lifted up in his heart he was so careful to think about us but he wanted us to be when we would come to this earth Lucifer was there thinking he wouldn't get foreign right in front of his nose foreign I'm sure you've got that scripture up there my dear brothers First Corinthians how many brought their Bibles if I got this right no I don't have it right let me see here it's the scripture maybe I'm not supposed to read that one oh before I forget and I'm all ready for Kitty this is our condolences to sister birthday on the passing of brother Augustine yeah God would give them Comfort because they say Consuelo and consolation praise the Lord Jesus Christ well I must have marked that scripture down wrong maybe that's why they're not putting it up he says so let's go to our next scripture amen praise the Lord we love the Lord God amen here we go for then what they have not ceased to be offered but then they would they they not have been ceased to be offered had not ceased to be an offered man because the worshipers once purged foreign are you all happy conscious having mental faculties not told by Sleep also means to be awake the mean significance aware of something within oneself but notice the word it uses in Hebrews 10 too is not the word conscience as we just read it's the word conscience with as the word science in it and we're not talking about science but there's there's a little difference in these words but two words yeah the meaning of these two words were brought together by the interpretation that God gave through his Prophet this sense of Consciousness is of moral goodness or blameworthiness of One's Own conduct or intentions that you don't feel unworthy of things that you did your conduct or even the intentions you had of things that you never did [Music] if your Purge you would have no conscience of these things and at the same time you're conscience the first word then you will be come to a point where you're no longer dull yeah you will not be slow to peace you will not be slow you will be conscious you say what do you go into this this is an instrument if you have no desire for something how would you be conscious you're getting there if you approach from it you no longer the prophet says that means they're that conscience in Hebrews 10 means you would have no longer have a desire for the things of the world but when you go into the meaning of the words it's talking about having a sense of morally being right do you no longer feel guilty about anything you're worthy from I'll blame there's no blame that they can put on you because your conscience has been cleaned but the prophet says that means you no longer would have that desire for sin significance amen now the scripture came to me today I gave wrong first John two Primera de cuandos amen [Music] praise the Lord are you happy we're going to get into this and we're going to find out whether we were conscience is when we were in God may sound like Greek To You Right he says we're gonna find out the way God felt about us as he was forming us inside of himself amen amen love not the world either the things that are in the world if any man loved the world or the the love of the father is not in him he said for all that is in the world just say that all together for all that is in the world what does a-l-l mean is all the things of the world no matter how nice it looks to you if it's a part of this Fallen World System whether it be politics yes because we're not here just to be religious we're not just here to make our conscience feel better so that we we can go out of here feeling happier we want to please we want to walk with him is the religion that we cover ourselves with religion all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes two things are physical and what does it produce the pride of life you're so proud of what you achieved and what you think you are okay it says it is and the world passeth away and the last thereof is but he that doeth he that continues to doeth the will of God forever it means all these things that surround us that our penetrated our bodies and our spirits that we've been so accustomed to because we were born in sinus we were formed in iniquity and we came into this world with a lying nature that's all we've ever known as the human all of our lives do you want to stay there give me the quote out of the questions and answers on Genesis amen amen praise the Lord now we're going to find out if we were conscious Indios brother you're crazy as they always say that's nothing when God created me William Branham and you can put your name there he's the son of God just like you and me we had a right to put his name there I was before the foundation of the world he made my my being at least said my spirit my Espiritu I wasn't conscious of anything as far as I know of yourself watch the way he's saying this he goes I wasn't he's talking here and now he's in flesh for the foundation of the world and now as the man is saying I was not conscious of anything yeah but I was there believe you're getting it are you getting it now just a minute Jesus told the disciples that he knew them before the foundation of the world and Paul said that here he chose us in him before the foundation of the world there was some part of me Neville or the rest of you all here was there some part of you there I.E before the world began and I don't want to read the last part of this quote because it's going to take me somewhere else so if brother brennam wasn't conscience as far as he knew because he's he's looking back to eternally from a time space from a body of cells he was in conscience remember conscience and Consciousness are tied to the desire is so it couldn't be a desire of William Branham nope it couldn't be your desire through the same it wasn't your conscience there no question he was conscience but you were inside of him his conscience is I'll leave that there just for a minute foreign so now because we're seeing a few thousand years before we came to earth oh my goodness right are you happy oh no no you're going to understand yourself better now if you can see yourself a couple of thousand years before you came to Earth Jesus in God's mind died for the sins of the world Jesus and your name was put on The Book of Life [Applause] he wrote Jesus's name there first Jesus name was written in the book was written hallelujah oh glory to God glorious blessed be the name senor ah I'm starting to feel a little bit better that's the Bible truth it is see your name was ordained of God and placed in the book of life before the foundation of the world you were there in his attributes and if I go there well like time will be gone I won't even get work what is an attribute it's a characteristics characteristic it's a nature of what he is you've always been that way once we were redeemed and washed in the Precious Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ amen let's go to the next paragraph and when that has gone in the egg and you become a part of your father is and your mother is a part of your father is Glory Gloria that lets all denomination out is all together in other words just not a system of man there's not just four walls the church they can save you that could give you the new birth that can reveal this to you certainly does God in all the only place the next identity it doesn't seem like we're in the right way can we go to the next paragraph I got it this part this is the part I got to get you to you got it well I don't see the paragraph that I won he says and listen when you were in him he says you don't remember them it's been one of those paragraphs no he goes because you were just a part of his life could say foreign you are not an independent being said in the independiente and you were conscious he was the one that was conscious of you while you were in him no wonder then when we came to Earth to live in a body of sins something on the inside that you know when we saw we were last perdidos he saw everything that you would ever and he he saw you saved that's when the lamb came out in his mind slain from the foundation of the world it would have never been manifested on Earth knowing the that you would be here today that I would be here we are not just here by chance we are here by the predestinated his Consciousness David said All My Desire is before you the video told us how many happy grannies and all my brownies they are not hidden from you how could they hide from God we could feel for you he was a high priests it must be his desire in us if you can see this desire that is creating in us right now at 11 13. this day esteria of July the Julio the 16th yes he says 2023. he is creating this in US continue until he sees the products that we will be choice in our Salvation if we hadn't even come to Earth yet perdonado before we everything in his Minds he would not failure and no matter what Lucifer would do is go there because I'll go back to the serpent again foreign that was you and I heard the truth we wouldn't understand it all but we would believe we would just believe it no matter what we've gone through no important when he saw that of us that increased his face he spoke about you and me it just said you know what Escape my faith is Justified in these people my faith is Justified because now they're pulling my thoughts and they're making them live We are Becoming blessed it's no longer just a thought in the back part of God's mind see them rejoicing in Las Cruces Tabernacles in Cedar Hills Church at the cross Cedar Hills Church and they are forgiven yes glory to God glorious and what's the problem with you and me we can't forgive ourselves that's where our complexes come from we know the Lord forgive us but we're constantly getting on our own case mismos oh and I've got chopped good on this one okay thank God you Godly men like brother tell me I said yes don't degrade yourself that intense expectations it can't hold you back anymore even when you want to hold yourself is there something in you that explodes the power of the Living God you can see the fall whatever it hurt him so deeply fundamentally even the separation he would feel unless to lose contact with us accessible satisfaction that is he will lose a part of himself now we're inside of the spirit of God stealing what he felt he was separated from us now as we come back into the presence of the Living God Redemption is the expectations of this creature that was still in God now it's in you and me I was with you before Jesus said father glorify me he is that we were a being yet it's not that we all were a being yeah but we were part of your life foreign real oh my God but now but I would always amen amen and that was that's what makes you feel bad it is look what makes you feel bad when you disobey him or if I let some body and I started looking at their mistakes I don't want nothing to do with us now that's not me that thought but this book was Sometimes some others feel that way oh yeah but now that I understand that you were a part of that life while he was thinking and now I see you yeah I see a part of myself I see a part of each one and I cannot live without one one less part you know enough to PCN one correction I want to
