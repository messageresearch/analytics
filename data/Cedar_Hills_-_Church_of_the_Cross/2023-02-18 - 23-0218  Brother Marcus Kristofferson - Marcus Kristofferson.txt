good morning everyone are you happy this morning it's a it's a great testimony to see that all of you are here this morning because it's so many people that so many youth they're laying drunk in a dish this morning but you stood up for Christ when you came here this morning and that's a testimony so whatever people say to you you always have the testimony to show and to Proclaim to the full angels that you have a Christ you have a savior that died for you and protects you day and night so I usually behind this book but I get very formal but this morning I will try to relax and just talk with you guys and I hope that we can get to know each other better and that I can I can tell something from my life that maybe can encourage you and help you to understand that we are on the same team we are fighting for the same same course and we are going going to the same place we're going home to replace we came from so I I just want to read a portion from the scripture this morning and we will open up the Bible in James chapter five verse 16. so do everyone have their Bible this morning because the Bible is your sword is the thing you fight with so if you don't have your bubble this morning this is last day you forgot your Bible you always need to bring your Bible because if I tell you to go into the bathroom with somebody in the world you will always bring a tool with you so bring your Bible but let's read and it reads from James chapter 5 verse 16. confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man a valid match let's power heads dear heavenly father I'm so grateful for this morning that we could wake up and we could talk to you this morning that we could come in peace relax in front of your throne of Mercy that we can stand and talk together about what you did for us that's the youth here in Las Cruces and all the visitors that there are here this morning that they can come with an open heart and they don't need to fear anything because whatever that is said from this Pulpit is from you Lord that they can relax and that they can take this word and convert it into life and bring it to be a part of their testimony and their their walk in the Lord so we ask that your angel will come and be amongst us this morning we welcome your Holy Ghost to jump from heart to heart and make a rejoicing moments together so we ask this in your precious holy name amen you may be seated so I just want to ask how many is younger than 12 years older is everybody other than 12 years old it's very good yeah you want to go there it's very nice when I was 12 years old I had a huge struggle in my life I was was I was dragged back and forth we had youth gatherings but it was so hard for me to live the right life because I had a lot of friends that was pulling me they wanted me to play soccer and everything that this world wants to give us but I I had heard from my parents that watch out for those things because it's it's spirits that tries to to occupy your time many times the things you do it seems harmful but it tries to take your time and your time is so important because God wants all your time so when I was 12 years old I had a very good friend of mine and he was kind of like a dad for me because my dad that you saw yesterday that was not that I grew up with because my dad was very sick for many many years he was sleeping many hours a day and he he always was there for me but when I wanted to go out to play he he didn't have the strength to come together with me so that was a hard time for me but I had a very good friend that was kind of like a father for me that I used to to go to and do all the fun things with but when I wanted to have some good advices I went to my dad because he was my good advisor so we had all these U.S Gatherings once a month and we was approximately yeah I think at most 30 30 youths in Norway and we used to go maybe up in the forests found a cabin and sing some songs and barbecue and just have have a good time and and the most important thing we did was to talk about the Lord and to to talk about each other not always about the scripture but about each other what what is happening around us and however everyone is doing and suddenly on one of those trips it was something touched me and I just broke down and I felt into tears and I knew that this is my time now I need to take a choice to choose God or the world so I decided to baptize and and I had turned 13 years old when I I made a choice so we went to Convention and I got baptized but it didn't happen so much after that I thought that my life was going to change dramatically dramatically but it was it was the same after and I couldn't understand why because I heard that when you baptized you will be filled with a Holy Ghost and all your troubles will disappear but I got into more trouble it got so worse and it stayed on for many years and it was so hard for me it was like my dad's spoke yesterday about the dark room and but I have baptized so I had that red color that was protecting me all the way so that was the only thing that kept me I didn't knew that but when I looked back I understand that something kept me so and the time went by and when I was 16 years old how many year is 16 years old 16. nice when I was 16 I moved out from home so I wanted to leave my parents and Eros because of school but because of my parents but I needed instead of traveling like two or three hours to school every morning I moved to another city but the time got even worse for me when I left my parents and that was a very hard time because you know I I grew up in a message I gained so much knowledge about this message my father has been a preacher his whole life they come from the the Pentecostal denomination and and so he preached there and then he kept on going we received the message and I have three siblings I'm the youngest one and during that time growing up in a message we we actually didn't talk about the message among the youth because we were in the message so why why should we talk about the message when you are in the message are you familiar with that are you talking about the message or DIY avoid it because so many times you think that I am saved I don't need to talk about this message because I'm I'm saved and you're avoid it so you you won't end up in arguing with people about the message and so but during those years when I was in church and we we went to service every Sunday and Wednesday nights foreign because we we never spoke about the message together we we were talking about what we did on our spare time and what we were supposed to do in the weekends but not about the message and it was something missing in my life and I didn't feel I feel like home so so I went further and further away from the message I was still in the church but that was only for two hours on Sunday and that is not the LIE that's a religion and you're not a part of her religion you're part of Christ they're part of of a body so I had drifted away and I like to do skiing skiing is my favorite thing to go go out in the wilderness and find the highest peak and climb it and then ski down and it's it it's kinda peaceful because it's like flying down the mountain and you just come to Norway and try it I invite you all and I'll take you for a tour and it's it's really nice so this was so good to me skiing so I started to skip the services Sunday after Sunday because I really like skiing it's it's harmful it's only skiing but as gift service and skipping service is skipping a fellowship with Christ and I didn't knew that it was harmful for me to skip service because I I wasn't drinking I was in smoking I was in partying I was only skiing and why why should that be harmful but you know Sunday after Sunday skipping skipping skipping I I started to lose something that's that I should that have in my life but it was in I think it was in in 2000 and 14. some years ago that I was in the end of high school and I was thinking of becoming a engineer and become something great and study but at the same time I was living living alone and every day when I came back from school I was switching on the TV looking on movies I was having on music and when I was cooking food I was looking at movies when I was eating I was looking at movies all day and night day in and day out and it felt like that it got darker and darker and darker and darker in the life and it was a terrible time but I knew about the truth because I had been there but I I was trying to avoid it I thought that I I am so clever I can I can kind of out of this myself but Satan is stronger than that he when he gets a hold of you he won't let go when you stand alone he'll take you and try to force you down so during that year I was I was cast into so so many things and nobody saw it because I was all by myself in the apartment I had when I was when I was sometimes going to service everything seemed nice I was praying and reading my Bible and singing listening to the preacher but when I get put out of the service went back home I was back in the ditch but nobody saw it so my sister always said oh mark you're such a nice and good Christian boy you never do nothing wrong but I knew that that's not the life I live I live a different life I'm I'm hiding and nobody sees it so are you family familiar with that to to be to hide and and try to live a life and and and you can't live it you know the truth and but it's it's something that's you you're not able to to come true to really live that life you're trying to hide and it's it's Satan that is pulling you away from the message he tries to get a hold of you to put you into to things that maybe it looks harmless but he tries to occupy your mind all the time in basketball movies and sucker everything going to the gym it can be everything it's your time so during that year I was I was cast into pornography movies music and lots of things and you know all of those things was for free I didn't have to pay for anything of those it came for free so it was so easy to to end up on in those things and Satan when I I conquered one thing he just gave me another thing and it kept on going but it was one important thing that I did that year two times a week I went home to my parents and I had conversations with my dad and I knew that I shouldn't go home because he is telling me the truth but it was something that was probably me go home and talk to Dad or listen to that I I never said something to him so he didn't knew that I was suffering because I was hiding it from everybody I didn't tell anybody but during during that year he said so many things and it was like like a picture and I didn't see the picture but as I I received a lot of pieces of that pictures of that picture but I I didn't I wasn't able to put those pieces together because I lived a different life then that he told me to live so every every time I went home when I came back to my apartment it got darker I went to my dad and it got darker and it kept on going and in the church I went to I I every every time before the service I was kneeling down and I was praying and I told the Lord that I can't do this this is too hard for me it's it's something I I can't understand so Lord please help me but there was no help coming and I was trying I was trying and I was trying and after a while I made a promise the Lord a very strange promise because the promise was that I'm not going to read the Bible anymore but I will stay faithful in prayer but I will stop reading the Bible because I don't understand any word of it and it got darker and darker and I knew that it was a wall waiting for me and I one day I will hit that wall and at this time I was I was actually 19 years old so baptized when I was 13 years old and still now 19 years old struggling a lot and as I was walking towards this wall darker darker darker and I use all my times with the things I shouldn't do I was I was praying and praying Lord what what do you want to show me why why are you doing this to me because the Bible the Bible that I knew but I didn't read anymore said that if you pray you'll get an answer but I I didn't get an answer and I couldn't understand why why Lord why are you doing this to me and do you feel it light like that sometimes you pray for something Time After Time After Time and it seems like you don't get any answer and why why is that happening and one day my dad called Marcus please come home I need to tell you something and I was thinking okay yeah yeah I'll come home and and we'll have a talk or I will listen to you again so I went went home and and we were taking a walk out in the wilderness and he was just telling me some some few things and I was thinking yeah I I hear what you say but it doesn't matter because I I'm not able to live that life and and then he said he gave me a scripture and that is Luke 24 25 and that reads Dennis said unto them of Fools and slow of Hearts to believe all that the prophets has spoken and in that moment when he said that scripture it was like the heaven opened for me and and my dads didn't realize but in my life in my heart it was something special happening I couldn't understand why what is happening to me right now but to believe all that the prophets have spoken I I realized that for so many years I had tried to fight this fight alone and I didn't believe all things that the prophet had spoke I had believed my own words not the prophet's word and when when Dad gave me that scripture the the Bible and a message everything he had said the past year in our conversation all the puzzles came together like like a big picture for me and I understood that now something happened and that was the day I died in myself I totally gave up myself and and from that day on my my life turned and I began to read the scripture again to listen to messages and that kept on going for for a long while but Satan he came with an even bigger Army trying to defeat me one more time but now I had the scripture the Bible that I could use because you know that when Jesus was was tempted Satan tried to tell him that just just do these wondrous and I will give you the whole Earth but Jesus knew that if I'm listening to that voice I'm a boy I'm obeying that voice I'm obeying Satan so in my life I had obeyed Satan everything he said to me I obeyed it and that was the fault I did I was obeying the wrong voice and and so so after after this time I I I started to live a new life a good life but still it was a fight because growing growing up in the message has everybody here parents in in the message have you grown up in a message you know when you grow up in a message you gain a lot of knowledge you know so much about the message but has it become a revelation to us or not is it a knowledge or a revelation and that was my big struggle is this only things I know or is it revealed to me that you know when when you are aware of those things and you are thinking is this only knowledge or is it revealed to me when when you are having those thoughts it's a spirit that tries to tell you its knowledge but listen to the spirits that tells that this is a revelation it's a peace maybe you don't know that this person that you know about is something that is a part of your picture the image that you know of the image that you are created after that the things you know maybe it's something you don't understand but it's something that you are supposed to use later in your life so the first scripture we read about confess your faults one another and pray one for Honor you know the reason why we are supposed to do that the reason is to not end up like me spending six or seven years of my life alone if you start using this scripture to confess your faults maybe it's a small thing because it's it's easy to confess small things but the big things it's it's hard to confess because you think that oh it's only me having this problem but if you start practicing to confess Small Things oh today I said something bad to my brother pray for me help me and you know why we should confess it's because my testimony is your testimony because we are part of one body so if you think that your problem is only your problem that is wrong because your problem is my problem because we are a part of the same body you understand how many people have some problems today be honest everybody has a problem maybe you ain't practicing enough maybe you and kind enough is always something we have problems with but that's a good sign because then you have something to conquer because we are Overcomers for Christ so I want to encourage you to to start confess to somebody to find somebody to talk to and and confess your faults because before the foundation was laid we were together as one big great family and we we are having an amnesia that is our biggest problem amnesia because we don't remember what happened back there because we are in a flesh and our memory is so bad that's why you see the world they're repeating the same things they go into World War it goes sometime and then they'll have a World War again they never learn but we we have a way to learn and when you confess to your brother and it's it's not embarrassing to tell your brother or sister about your faults because in this body we are trapped in this body this body doesn't don't belong to us this is flesh and blood we are a spirit and we are going back to a spirit form so when you confess to a friend of yours or to somebody that's you trust then your memory will start coming back you will understand who you were and that the things you are doing that seems to be wrong is only something that you are trapped in it's not the real you so when we help each other to get this memory back to talk about the scripture because the scripture is a story about you and me when you understand that that we are reading about ourselves because we are part of one body the body of the Lord Jesus Christ and the memory starts coming back you understand that oh that was me that was the choice that I made before the foundation of this world was laid then you start to live another life your problems you understand that this is just something that's that is trying to hit you down hit you down all the time but when you can together with your brother and sister speak about your your your testimony and and your life the memory about who you really were comes back and we know that the prophet says that the day you understand who you really are that is the day you will be translated and we will go into an outer body and into the spirit that we belongs to and we have we have these angels around us that is helping us all the time so this is only some few humble words I wanted to share with you to help each other to bring the memory back that the things you're struggling with with it's it's nothing special for you all of us are struggling with the same thing your trouble is my trouble and if one part of the body is hurting the whole body is hurting but if you don't tell about your life then it will be hard for somebody else to help you so try not to do like I did to hide to close my door and be for myself because when I was for myself Satan and his army with his Fallen Angels was so strong and kept me down for so long time but when I started to to join people and talk about this message message it became easier and easier and easier still is a fight because we are supposed to be Overcomers if you don't conquer some something you can't be an overcomer and if you don't have a scar you haven't been in a battle so we need scars to show that we have overcome something so I want to encourage you to to start talk about your life and because it can come a time that you really need to have a good friend that can help you out if you have confessed to your friends for a for a time they they get they get to know you and they can see that oh now he's struggling I need to go and talk to him so take this scripture take a video and start using it because this this scripture is is for getting healed but I think it's it's one week ago when I got this scripture I understood that this scripture is here for me to bring my memory back and your memory back so take this scripture with you and use it and help each other to get the memory back and I'll tell you that the thing you are struggling with you will understand that that is just something you are trapped in it's not your fault you're trapped in it you made a decision before the foundation of this world and you chose the message that Michael came with and the things you're struggling with that is not you not the real you it can seems like because we feel like oh this this is my life but this is not what is you you are the choice you made back there so God bless you and I hope that it was something that you could read relates to and that you could understand anything of it so God bless you [Applause] hey man would you please stand let's just get rid of Marcus another Round of Applause it's uh how many enjoyed that did you all catch that we're gonna have a fellowship today right every
