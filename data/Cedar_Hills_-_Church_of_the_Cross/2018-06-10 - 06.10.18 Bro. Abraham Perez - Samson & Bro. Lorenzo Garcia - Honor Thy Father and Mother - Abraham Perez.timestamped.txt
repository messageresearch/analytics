[10:38] chapter will be reading the first verse
[10:44] to the fifth
[10:57] and the children of Israel did evil
[10:59] again in the sight of the Lord and the
[11:02] Lord delivered them into the hand of the
[11:04] Philistines forty years and there was a
[11:08] certain man of Zorah of the family of
[11:10] the Danites whose name was Manoah and
[11:15] his wife was barren and bare not and the
[11:19] angel of the Lord appeared unto the
[11:21] woman and said unto her behold now thou
[11:24] art barren and Barriss not but not shall
[11:28] conceive and bear a son now therefore
[11:32] beware I pray thee and drink not wine
[11:35] nor strong drink and eat
[11:37] not any unclean thing for a lo thou
[11:42] shall conceive and bear a son and no
[11:44] razor shall come on his head for the
[11:46] child shall be a Nazarite unto God from
[11:50] the womb and he shall began deliver
[11:53] Israel out of the hand of the
[11:56] Philistines at the word word the word of
[12:06] the Lord you may be seated
[12:13] we start with Samson when he's going to
[12:17] a town called Timnath where he meets
[12:21] this young lady you know get to know his
[12:25] name though but we know that she's a
[12:28] daughter of a Philistines but this woman
[12:30] does please Samson very well so Samson
[12:35] goes to his father and mother and he
[12:37] tells them if he can take this woman to
[12:41] be his wife but they tell him if he has
[12:45] any interest in any other girls and
[12:47] they're amongst their people but he does
[12:51] not so they go to Timnath to go meet the
[12:55] young lady
[12:56] while Samson as the Bible describes it
[13:01] goes down where he comes upon this young
[13:05] lion and he he ends up beating this line
[13:10] at battle cause lion attacked him
[13:13] Worthen we meet up with Samson again
[13:16] where he goes and goes to his new wife
[13:21] and goes and takes her but when he's
[13:23] walking he comes upon the lion and he
[13:26] sees that a foreign bees have gone to
[13:31] the corpse and then he sees that they
[13:33] had they made the sweetness stuff he
[13:36] gets it and he eats upon it and then of
[13:41] course it's honey where he gifts some to
[13:43] his father and mother and of course then
[13:50] we see Samson again at the wedding where
[13:53] they say that he has companions to be
[13:56] with there with with him where then he
[13:59] tells or then he tells the Philistines
[14:04] because the Philistines were there also
[14:06] he tells the Philistines I shall put
[14:09] forth a riddle and the riddle goes like
[14:13] this and if you do want to read the
[14:15] riddle of the riddle will be located in
[14:17] judges 14 14 and they say out of the
[14:21] eater
[14:22] come forth meat and out of the strong
[14:24] come forth sweetness the Philistines
[14:28] cannot cannot know the riddle they were
[14:32] confused of the riddle so days the
[14:35] Samson said if they get the riddle right
[14:38] then they get 30 yeah 30 garments and
[14:47] and cloth I think and cloth and if they
[14:54] win then he has to get them for him and
[14:58] if they win then they have to get it for
[15:00] him on the seventh day still the
[15:04] Philistines could not figure out the
[15:05] riddle so what they do is they go to the
[15:09] wife Samson's wife and they threaten her
[15:12] if they said they told her if she does
[15:14] not tell us the answer to the riddle
[15:16] then she and her then her father shall
[15:20] be burnt with fire so she goes up to
[15:23] pond
[15:24] Samson and she tells him Samson died has
[15:27] not loved me that I has hated me because
[15:30] of the I shall not tell me the answer to
[15:32] the riddle he tells her I have not even
[15:35] told my own family the answer to the
[15:37] riddle but he sees as she's weeping so
[15:42] he tells the answer to the riddle
[15:44] anyways so he goes meets up with the
[15:47] Philistines and the Philistines tell him
[15:50] because he tells them what is the answer
[15:53] to the riddle then he then they tell him
[15:56] what is stronger than a lion and what is
[16:01] sweeter than honey well then he finds
[16:05] out that his wife told them the answer
[16:09] of the riddle so what he does is that he
[16:11] goes out to go look for the cloths and
[16:14] garments thirty of them or then he
[16:18] stumbles upon this campsite where there
[16:20] he finds Philistines mistreating his
[16:22] people so what he does is that he kills
[16:25] them and takes their cloths and garments
[16:27] and then he gives and he goes back to
[16:30] visit his wife and give him the cloths
[16:31] and garments and then he finds out that
[16:34] his wife has given a has been given away
[16:37] to another companion or then he gets mad
[16:41] and grabs three hundred foxes and wraps
[16:46] sticks to there between their tails with
[16:50] fire and sends him back to the
[16:52] Philistines
[16:53] we felt where then burns everything then
[16:59] then the Philistines said how come how
[17:04] come is Samson treats us like this
[17:07] then they think to themselves then we
[17:10] should treat him the same way he's been
[17:12] treating us so they go and they kill his
[17:15] wife and his father they burnt them with
[17:17] fire were then he gets mad again and
[17:21] kills thousands of men with a jawbone of
[17:27] an ass were then he then he goes into
[17:32] hiding a harlot hides hides um
[17:36] this is where we find in Samson again
[17:38] because he goes to Gaza and he gets hide
[17:41] by a harlot because the gays i'ts wanted
[17:45] to kill him they said if they do not
[17:48] find him then they'll try to kill him by
[17:49] morning but the end of finding Samson
[17:53] and Samson takes off but to show him how
[17:56] powerful he is he takes the door of Gaza
[18:01] and takes it with him which frightens
[18:04] them all then this is where Samson
[18:09] stumbles upon a town this town was
[18:14] called Zurich where he met Delilah
[18:23] Delilah was not a very nice person as we
[18:27] all know the the Philistines promised
[18:38] her a lot of money can any of you figure
[18:41] out how much they promised her yes a
[18:50] thousand
[18:57] thirty shekels of silver 400 pieces of
[19:05] silver
[19:08] does anybody have another answer no it
[19:16] was 1,100 pieces of silver that they
[19:19] promised her each from the guard every
[19:22] guard each gave her 11 pieces of silver
[19:26] but not yet because she still had to
[19:30] find out what made Samson strong so she
[19:35] goes to Samson and she tells him Samson
[19:38] tell me I pray thee what is where does
[19:42] thy strength come from where is thy
[19:45] weakness from he tells her well if you
[19:53] wrap me around with this core that has
[19:56] not been dried then I shall be weak like
[19:59] any other man so she does that to him
[20:03] but where he finds where she says Samson
[20:08] the Philistines are upon thee and he
[20:11] gets up and he snaps it actually the
[20:15] Bible describes it like he snapped it
[20:17] like it was nothing so she gets mad at
[20:23] him at the next day and she tells him
[20:25] that has mocked me and told me lies
[20:27] she says Samson I tell thee and pray
[20:30] thee wonders thy weakness come from
[20:33] where does I strength come from he tells
[20:36] her if you wrap me around with the rope
[20:38] that has not that has been new that's
[20:41] new then he shall be weak like any other
[20:44] man so she does then she tossed Samson
[20:48] again
[20:49] Samson the Philistines are upon thee
[20:51] where he gets up and he snaps the ropes
[20:55] like its thread
[21:03] then she tells him again
[21:05] Samson that I has marked me and lied to
[21:08] me again
[21:09] where does I strengths and weakness come
[21:11] from so he tells her if you put these
[21:15] web and you put webs into my hair then I
[21:20] shall be weak like any other man she
[21:24] does that to him
[21:25] he gets up he just beats them all over
[21:28] again so then the next day she tells
[21:32] them Samson dye has marked me that has
[21:34] hated me has not loved me
[21:36] that has told me three lies what is thy
[21:41] weakness come from Samson and he sees
[21:44] that she's really mad so he tells it
[21:46] with all his heart when before I was
[21:51] born
[21:52] the angel came to my mother and told
[21:56] told her that there shall not be any
[21:58] razor upon my head that my hair shall
[22:02] not be shaved so she sees that he says
[22:05] that with all hers all his heart so she
[22:07] does she goes to the Philistines and
[22:09] tells them so the Philistines go there
[22:12] at night worse where Delilah makes
[22:15] Samson sleep on her on her lap and then
[22:19] she forces a man to shave off Samson's
[22:21] hair then she tossed Samson Samson
[22:24] Philistines are upon thee where he gets
[22:26] up and he tries to fight back but he
[22:28] cannot the Philistines take him down and
[22:31] they put out his eyes where he can no
[22:34] longer see so with Samson does as I he
[22:41] he goes he goes to Gaza they take him to
[22:47] Gaza where they put him in jail he
[22:49] cannot see so the guard takes him and
[22:55] takes him to the pillars but he tells
[22:57] the guard please leave me let me lean on
[23:00] the pillars for I cannot see so that's
[23:03] what he does and then he tells the Lord
[23:06] a prayer now does anybody know the
[23:09] prayer
[23:13] nobody he tells the Lord oh Lord
[23:19] do remember me one last time where
[23:27] there's a message that brother Branham
[23:29] that brother Branham preached which was
[23:33] called just one last time and the and he
[23:43] says lord please let me die with these
[23:45] Philistines because all the men and
[23:48] Philistines and women came to see Samson
[23:51] that day there was thousands of people
[23:54] there so what he does he gets to the
[23:57] pillars puts his two hands there and he
[23:59] pushes them which kills all of them
[24:01] including Samson like to thank you all

[27:19] respectful that's perfect to be
[27:24] respectful right it's too it's too to
[27:26] have the most the highest respect for
[27:28] them right and and I can i I want to be
[27:33] honest with you with you kids today okay
[27:34] I just I just wanna want to speak to you
[27:37] all from the bottom of my heart because
[27:39] one time I was your age okay and I was a
[27:41] little kid and playing around and I I
[27:44] have my mic I'm lucky to still have my
[27:46] dad and my mom still alive
[27:49] but if I'm being honest I there's been
[27:53] some times when I've been when I was a
[27:55] kid and I got mad at my parents I would
[27:59] get mad at them sometimes has any of any
[28:02] of you kids ever have you any of you
[28:04] kids ever gotten mad at your parents
[28:07] okay okay we're being honest right are
[28:10] we being honest okay raise your hand if
[28:12] you if you've been mad before at your
[28:13] parents yeah okay
[28:16] okay thank you for the honesty and I
[28:19] remember a few times yelling at my my
[28:22] mom I I yelled at my mom and I remember
[28:27] her slipper right right away she'd take
[28:30] out that slipper and just and just smack
[28:32] through that slipper right away but we
[28:35] need to honor honor our parents right
[28:39] why why would God I'm curious why would
[28:42] God even why would he even have us I
[28:45] would even have this as a commandment
[28:47] did anybody want to guess why God would
[28:49] have this as a commandment to live a
[28:58] better life
[29:00] okay and have more years of your life
[29:02] that's that's that yep that's right on
[29:04] with on track with the Bible that's
[29:05] that's awesome brother
[29:15] he put it in the tablets right yes that
[29:18] that's right anybody else
[29:27] okay that's it that's a good answer also
[29:29] so so I asked myself the question why I
[29:33] would God put this in in the
[29:35] commandments okay and we all we all
[29:37] honor our Lord Jesus Christ amen would
[29:39] you you guys honor God yeah okay I honor
[29:42] God too right and and and we have to
[29:46] understand that with our parents it
[29:48] doesn't matter if if your parents come
[29:51] to church or they don't come to church
[29:53] when it says honor thy father and thy
[29:55] mother it doesn't it doesn't give any
[29:58] any stupid it doesn't give anything it
[30:03] doesn't say because your parents are
[30:04] good or because your parents are bad or
[30:07] nothing it just says honor your father
[30:09] and your mother because that's who God
[30:12] chose to bring you into this world God
[30:15] chose them to bring you into this world
[30:17] and by them bringing you into this world
[30:20] you're here sitting down right now and
[30:22] you're so so privileged to be listening
[30:26] to what you heard this morning you heard

[30:30] words of life right you hear the message
[30:33] of the hour you hear the Prophet you
[30:35] hear the ministry you guys are so
[30:37] privileged
[30:38] you guys are so valuable to God that he
[30:41] gave you guys parents that he would want
[30:44] you to honor and and and love and take
[30:48] care of them
[30:48] now let me God God sent me God sent me
[30:52] today to give you guys a message okay
[30:54] and the message that that that he wants
[30:57] to give you today is that he understands

[31:03] mean you guys are kids and and sometimes
[31:06] we hear we hear some really really good
[31:08] messages and and sometimes they might be
[31:10] a little bit hard for us to understand

[42:44] my grandma my grandma cooks really
[42:45] really good too she cooked very good she
[42:48] passed away but she cook very good one
[42:50] of my favorite things to do and I would
[42:52] stay over there at my grandma's was she
[42:54] would make me a sandwich that was the
[42:56] most incredible sandwich that anybody
[42:59] could ever have it was just an
[43:01] incredible sandwich so my grandma's
[43:04] being gone though she's been gone for I
[43:06] don't know seven years or so so the
[43:08] other day I was home and I was just I
[43:11] was also bad I wanted this sandwich and
[43:16] you know what I said you know what the
[43:17] heck was I'm gonna go to the store I'm
[43:19] gonna go to the grocery store and I
[43:21] bought everything that my grandma would
[43:23] buy everything the same bread the same
[43:25] meat the same mayonnaise the same
[43:28] everything everything everything and I
[43:30] went home and I started cooking
[43:32] everything up and and putting stuff
[43:35] together the whole nine yards and I went
[43:37] and I sat down and I
[43:39] my sandwich and it was the same thing my
[43:41] grandma would make and as I was eating
[43:44] it about about halfway through the
[43:46] sandwich I said to myself this how much
[43:50] taste nothing like my grandma's sandwich
[43:53] nothing nothing that it tastes like my
[43:55] grandma's sandwich and I made everything
[43:58] exactly the same so I couldn't figure it
[44:00] out why in the world would my sandwich
[44:02] not taste like my grandma salmon and I

[44:08] experience that I would have when my
[44:10] grandma was there with me
[44:12] my grandma would hug me when I was
[44:15] eating and she would ask me how I was

[44:19] experience to that and it's the same
[44:22] thing with Christ you guys you kids as
[44:25] you grow up you're gonna have to get
[44:27] your own experience now you understood
[44:30] me about my grandma because you guys
