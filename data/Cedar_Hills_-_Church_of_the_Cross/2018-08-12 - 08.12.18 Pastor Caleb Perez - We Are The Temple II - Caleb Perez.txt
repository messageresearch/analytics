Castle let's see he wanted you fashion it so that he could feel right at home can ya mother that look but a star come when Casa and watch as Moses begins to write the first book of the Bible who says that Olivia and he says in the beginning even el principio God created your Clio not Satan no certain because Satan is not a creator gaining God created and then Pacific heroes of the heaven los cielos and the earth ela Tierra amen how many can say amen to that that's God's Word when the seat of midnight notice God created the heaven and the earth the heaven it's you know is the original is godina it's what everything is patterned after it's okay some more than others yeah and the earth is the inheritance of man that he was going to create is that NCI parra Lumbricus you'll see what we had one more time in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth and the precipitous cureless yet is let it slow cetera he created the very pattern kill in patron and then created the earth you know we saw that that much to be in that pattern gave us that in this patron how many understand me so far what does men in do now watch this now but I think once again when others heaven elo was perfect in a perfect own heaven Cielo was not without form and void and dark no stop there's sort of no you must see it was the pattern patron he created the heaven and the earth he was here and it was the earth yeah that was without form and void and darkness was upon the face look at the eyes so they never see int never last cuz God wanted his children's home to be patterned after his al mismo patron come in here with me but God said let there be light and there was light yo-dee-hooo cassell elusive once again heaven is the real it's here was the perfect pattern el patron per second earth in that era is what needs to be formed into that pattern and looking at a just a for the mother in this it but let's see if we fit the pattern now what was I see km wasn't is it but God took Moses just a mom myself off the mountain of fire is mo Isom Monta light games were flashing a Viet Reynosa roaring the lost renault through here and he showed him what kind of a dwelling-place he desired to dwell on earth le mostró que que lugar de el que de amor Aaron and Moses patterned the earthly tabernacle after what he had seen in heaven mo le mostró a comic area in patron a sanctuary of the Lord moons and what yo para el Senor now if you notice is if the fetus Solomon never varied one bit from the pattern Salamanca barrio del patron when Solomon built the temple understand amana difficult temple it was exactly according to the pattern that Moses had seen in in heaven in exactamente como la vista Moises and the mother Brown says what a spiritual application in equal America aplicación the spirit that we could apply here keep with Emily can I eat that we are never to leave the scriptures can O'Callahan with the hair let's get to that to stay exactly with the pattern again the scripture is our pattern esto patron how many read the pattern what was lane and patron oh gosh where did I ask that question porque si la pregunta about 20 people read the pattern the hint is Lennon how many people know that this is the pattern what does any case this el patron God's Word how many read the pattern it want to learn and patron all you just didn't you just didn't want to participate yeah I'm not getting a participant it's okay this word is our pattern esta palabra no patron you have to come too you have to come God's Way they make an even more than yours and gods gods means of doing things is it more concise in las cosas and as long as we try to get in ourselves inventors get Atomos SLO uno meeting and a word no I lose your nada did you get that no capo you try to get in yourself it ain't gonna work that that I said look forces maseo's no offense you're not and we just can't patterned after one another in no point once I said it but thrown so much as we love one
