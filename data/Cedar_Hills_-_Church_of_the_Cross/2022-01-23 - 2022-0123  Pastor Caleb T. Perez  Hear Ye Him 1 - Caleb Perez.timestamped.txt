[48:55] oh i'm ready
[48:58] by the blood
[49:04] this morning
[49:09] [Music]
[49:24] now
[49:25] i am
[49:27] [Music]
[49:38] written down
[49:40] [Music]
[49:54] this morning
[50:08] rejoicing sister
[50:10] sister rachel singing about the miracle
[50:12] mr mana rachel cantano de los milagros
[50:14] sister ruth talking about healing
[50:18] brother ethan singing
[50:24] and i said wow
[50:26] how perfectly it all goes with the
[50:28] message
[50:31] amen
[50:32] so
[50:33] we
[50:34] we could stay on
[50:36] all of the prophets that spoke until the
[50:38] coming of the lord
[50:43] but uh the lord says turn you turn the
[50:46] senor
[50:48] and so we are going to start a new
[50:50] series this this morning
[51:06] before we get into the word i want to i
[51:08] want to clarify something that i said
[51:10] last sunday
[51:13] there was not nothing that anybody told
[51:15] me
[51:17] but something that i felt that needs
[51:19] needs a little clarification
[51:23] i was talking about how how many times
[51:24] that that the people
[51:26] uh recognize the leaders
[51:31] and i use the word sometimes we get the
[51:33] glory you say
[52:01] it's simply i'm using it in the term of
[52:03] we we are the ones that receive
[52:05] recognition
[52:10] so we we know that that everything we do
[52:13] is not for our own glory
[52:17] glory and honor go to the lord jesus
[52:20] christ
[52:22] everybody here on that just wanted to
[52:24] meet
[52:25] i know we know but i but sometimes you
[52:27] don't want to let the enemy come in
[52:31] because we do nothing to try to receive
[52:32] or bring glory to ourselves
[52:37] so let's get into the word and and uh a
[52:39] man i've been so inspired with with
[52:42] what's been going on
[52:54] and i tell you i i think this may be the
[52:56] first time that i remember
[53:06] along with the ministers they're
[53:08] speaking about adoption
[53:12] now the lord is putting me or inspiring
[53:14] me to go and to hear ye him
[53:18] and to have all the ministry just going
[53:20] in the same direction
[53:26] we want to read uh uh hebrews 1 1.
[53:31] as i said we can stay on the prophets
[53:33] for a long time
[53:37] and it says god who at sun dry times
[53:40] and in diver's manner space in time
[53:43] passed unto the fathers
[53:45] by the prophets that's what we've been
[53:46] speaking about
[53:52] but now we want to turn the corner and
[53:54] come to now a little closer to home
[53:59] hath in these last days
[54:01] spoken unto us by his son
[54:04] whom he at the pointed air
[54:07] of all things by whom also he made the
[54:11] worlds or created the world
[54:21] how many know what son of god means
[54:28] of all things
[54:30] that's why he hath appointed him heir of
[54:33] all things
[54:36] by whom also he had created or made the
[54:38] worlds
[54:41] matthew 17 5.
[54:45] this will be our scripture that we
[54:48] that we want to base it on
[54:59] those online god bless you wherever you
[55:01] are
[55:13] [Music]
[55:19] 17 5 says while he yet spake behold a
[55:22] bright cloud overshadowed them
[55:24] and behold a voice out of the cloud
[55:27] which said
[55:28] this is my beloved son
[55:32] in whom i am well pleased
[55:45] with
[56:00] here
[56:03] what a thing it is may god add his
[56:05] blessings to the reading of his word you
[56:07] may be seated
[56:11] we're very happy to see as i said to see
[56:13] each one of you content
[56:24] amen so let's get into the word now
[56:26] these three words hear ye him
[56:41] determine the eternal destination
[56:44] of every man that hears it
[56:48] and his attitude towards it
[56:51] not just everyone that hears it
[56:54] but what is your attitude towards
[56:56] hearing
[57:10] because
[57:18] [Music]
[57:20] and nowadays we have so many voices that
[57:22] are directed at us
[57:37] everything that you hear it's a voice
[57:39] telling you things
[57:42] voices telling us what to do
[57:46] what to think
[57:48] what to wear
[57:50] what you believe
[57:52] where to go i
[57:54] is it just me
[57:57] voices
[58:00] literal voices voices literales voices
[58:03] on
[58:04] billboards
[58:21] and it's it's such a thing today
[58:24] that's why the voice of god is many
[58:26] times so rare
[58:28] it's so rarely heard
[58:32] even amongst the the the christian world
[58:36] it's because it's smothered out by so
[58:38] many
[58:40] so many other voices
[58:44] gotten to a place where sometimes our
[58:46] senses seem to be dulled to
[59:02] we're always asking well lord speak to
[59:04] me
[59:05] lord i can't hear you
[59:08] please say something to me
[59:10] yet in the midst of it all he's speaking
[59:12] to you
[59:14] missed all these voices
[59:58] he says
[1:00:14] he said he wasn't sure if it was just
[1:00:16] the wind maybe that was that that he
[1:00:18] heard
[1:00:21] but he said the voice of god came one
[1:00:24] more time
[1:00:26] and says
[1:00:39] and the voice simply said
[1:00:54] [Music]
[1:01:18] he said just speak
[1:01:20] to the storm
[1:01:22] a little sis
[1:01:31] [Music]
[1:01:32] oh we're going to get to some good
[1:01:34] things here
[1:01:36] so
[1:02:02] because the inspiration had come to him
[1:02:11] i like that once again i am the god of
[1:02:15] creation
[1:02:17] and we all know that only god can create
[1:02:21] we want to learn this morning not now
[1:02:23] now tell your neighbor only god can
[1:02:25] create
[1:02:27] this is important neighbor
[1:02:30] everybody shouldn't should know these
[1:02:32] things
[1:02:34] we have we have
[1:02:35] i i have i don't why put anybody else i
[1:02:38] have said this and repeated this many
[1:02:40] times
[1:02:42] the devil cannot create
[1:02:46] how many has said that
[1:03:14] the devil cannot create
[1:03:16] elements
[1:03:18] does everyone all
[1:03:21] understand that
[1:03:25] we
[1:03:26] many times we we act like they can
[1:03:28] create
[1:03:39] that's a doctrine of this church
[1:03:44] wow wow just just think about that let
[1:03:46] that let that penetrate just for a
[1:03:48] moment
[1:03:50] a doctrine of the church
[1:03:53] wait a minute we we are many times well
[1:03:56] we we want to argue about the doctrine
[1:03:58] of the tent
[1:04:02] the doctrine of the return
[1:04:04] of the regressor the doctrine of the
[1:04:06] thunders
[1:04:08] and of everything else
[1:04:10] and
[1:04:39] watch this that's a doctrine of this
[1:04:42] church
[1:04:44] in other words that's the part of the
[1:04:46] foundation of this church
[1:04:50] the very word
[1:04:52] as i put up here the formula of creation
[1:04:57] did you know that one of the one of the
[1:05:00] definitions of the word formula
[1:05:04] formula is a doctrine
[1:05:06] a doctrine of a church
[1:05:08] so when i speak about the formula of
[1:05:11] creation
[1:05:13] i'm talking about the doctrine of
[1:05:15] creation
[1:05:17] everybody get get get me all right
[1:05:20] so that is a doctrine of this church
[1:05:26] what do you all believe in that church
[1:05:29] i believe that satan is not a creator
[1:05:34] you started every conversation with them
[1:05:38] why why i think we could help a lot of
[1:05:40] people well they almost like you don't
[1:05:41] have to believe all these things start
[1:05:44] don't go there just start simple
[1:05:46] non-physical security we believe
[1:06:03] of creation
[1:06:06] and the only way that he can pervert
[1:06:08] creation
[1:06:12] there has to be creation that happens
[1:06:16] satan
[1:06:30] trying to
[1:06:45] how many remember that story about those
[1:06:47] scientists
[1:06:49] they were arguing with god
[1:06:52] we don't need you no more god
[1:06:56] we now are very intelligent
[1:07:14] is the science just they pick up a
[1:07:16] handful of dirt
[1:07:20] and when they do it
[1:07:22] he slaps her hand says get your own
[1:07:23] dirty
[1:07:41] notice this now
[1:07:43] people use the word today create so
[1:07:45] freely
[1:07:49] implying
[1:07:51] works of art or
[1:07:52] or inventions implicando
[1:08:07] he says a man that's
[1:08:09] a part of god
[1:08:12] he's a fallen race
[1:08:16] he's a fallen son
[1:08:19] and now in one sense of the word
[1:08:35] he cannot actually
[1:09:32] i'm
[1:09:57] there is an inspiration that was tapped
[1:09:59] into uh
[1:10:14] there's
[1:10:28] and that's where the very word
[1:10:30] imagination comes from
[1:10:33] where does the inspiration
[1:10:37] that activates our imagination
[1:10:40] where does that come from
[1:10:42] think about that
[1:10:44] inspiration can only come from one of
[1:10:47] two sources
[1:10:50] either from god
[1:10:52] or say oh it's not
[1:10:54] let me put it a little plainer
[1:11:55] oh never mind
[1:11:56] let's go on
[1:11:58] and by us not hearing the voice of god
[1:12:02] then everything we would make would be a
[1:12:05] perversion
[1:12:12] everything we would make would be our
[1:12:15] version
[1:12:18] and our version is use the upper version
[1:12:34] they are living
[1:12:48] because somebody don't see it or like we
[1:12:50] do ok
[1:12:55] well let's find out what version we have
[1:12:59] people are living under their version
[1:13:02] their
[1:14:08] we were speaking the other day but but
[1:14:10] that's why when you when you read or you
[1:14:12] hear or
[1:14:26] i
[1:14:40] 30 dollars
[1:14:42] hundred thousand
[1:14:44] my goodness they're telling you the
[1:14:45] success of it
[1:14:47] they're trying to inspire you
[1:14:50] especially when we're used to seeing
[1:14:51] fifty dollars
[1:15:21] then they start to lay off the formula
[1:15:23] or the plan for getting there
[1:15:26] [Music]
[1:15:28] fortunately what they can't tell you
[1:15:30] enough
[1:15:32] is what they have tapped into
[1:15:36] this is the plan this is how i did it
[1:15:38] this is the plan
[1:15:39] but the inspiration of it
[1:15:42] what drives it
[1:15:44] they're not going to they're not going
[1:15:45] to give you that
[1:15:48] watch
[1:15:49] when we look at that pandora
[1:16:19] let me tell you what god has done in my
[1:16:21] life
[1:16:22] what are we trying to do
[1:16:24] trying to inspire the people
[1:16:28] you hear what god did with his brothers
[1:16:31] it was a miracle
[1:16:32] what are we
[1:16:46] we're trying this morning as i said to
[1:16:48] stir the gift
[1:16:51] that is within you
[1:16:53] and we need inspiration
[1:16:56] the word inspiration actually or
[1:16:58] literally means
[1:17:12] that's why that's why when john was
[1:17:14] writing the book of revelation
[1:17:17] he would say i was in the spirit
[1:17:19] on the lord's day
[1:17:22] i was inspired
[1:17:25] i was inspired on the day of the lord
[1:17:28] when's the last
[1:17:42] in the book of psalms david would say
[1:17:44] create in me a clean heart
[1:17:49] and renew a right spirit within me
[1:17:53] in other words renew the right
[1:17:55] inspiration lord within me
[1:17:59] and me well i read the word brother
[1:18:02] that's all wonderful
[1:18:04] but the question is are you inspired to
[1:18:10] read come on we got to be real with
[1:18:13] ourselves this morning
[1:18:15] if we just pick up the bible now i gotta
[1:18:17] just soothe my conscience just read it
[1:18:23] man it's hard sometimes huh
[1:18:27] is it hard sometimes it's durability it
[1:18:29] shouldn't be right
[1:18:31] but when we like i said the other day
[1:18:33] but when we have to and this man
[1:18:35] we got this man we got this man and we
[1:18:37] got that
[1:18:51] and if we read the word it's wonderful
[1:18:55] but we've got to be inspired to read it
[1:19:00] we have to get into the spirit to read
[1:19:02] it
[1:19:04] if not it's the same as would be as
[1:19:06] reading
[1:19:19] and he reads the inspired word
[1:19:24] the two inspirations
[1:19:27] oh my my but in other words the two
[1:19:29] spirits
[1:19:32] his spirit
[1:19:33] and your spirit east west people he said
[1:19:35] i'll i'll put in you a new spirit
[1:19:39] of the holy spirit
[1:19:41] that's your spirit with a new nature
[1:19:44] i will put my spirit within yours
[1:19:48] when a
[1:20:30] don't need to be inspired
[1:20:32] jesus said the words that i speak unto
[1:20:35] you yes
[1:20:37] they are spirit and they are life so the
[1:20:39] spirit is somebody then the word is
[1:20:41] already inspired
[1:20:44] so what we need today is an inspiration
[1:20:46] over us
[1:20:49] watch how creation begins
[1:20:54] with a new inspiration
[1:20:57] and breathing over us
[1:21:12] word
[1:21:14] that's when you'll see miracles happen
[1:21:18] believers
[1:21:21] taking in the inspired word
[1:21:25] brings results
[1:21:40] is in no
[1:22:21] if all creation is groaning for the
[1:22:23] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:22:27] creation is groaning
[1:22:30] is creation finished
[1:22:34] a good question huh
[1:22:46] and that's why god creates in increments
[1:22:51] he does that to keep satan off balance
[1:22:57] what has not been created
[1:23:01] that's how he stays ahead of satan
[1:23:08] watch this now
[1:23:10] now now now get this in the beginning
[1:23:12] god created the heaven
[1:23:14] and the earth
[1:23:17] and when god was creating he
[1:23:28] that's right the right hand man of
[1:23:30] almighty god was was lucifer
[1:24:28] all right
[1:24:39] my
[1:24:44] imagine if i got up here and acted like
[1:24:46] that
[1:24:52] you need a fresh inspiration
[1:24:56] let's inspire you
[1:24:59] [Applause]
[1:25:10] everybody everything the whole
[1:25:13] what's called the universe
[1:25:19] and lucifer illusive right next to him
[1:25:23] helping him and watching it all happen
[1:25:30] he picked up on things
[1:25:33] but he still wasn't the creator
[1:25:36] the devil cannot create nothing no
[1:25:38] puerto
[1:25:43] and it took him six thousand years six
[1:25:46] days six thousand years
[1:25:48] yes stays millennials to create his eden
[1:25:51] but occurs within it's taken satan six
[1:25:53] days or six thousand years to create his
[1:25:56] eden yes
[1:25:59] says milan and everything that's satan
[1:26:03] he first brings it up as something good
[1:26:36] those of you that have that that see
[1:26:39] what's going on in the world out there
[1:26:43] the hottest thing that is trending right
[1:26:45] now can anyone tell me what it is
[1:27:02] facebook just changed his name from
[1:27:04] facebook to meta
[1:27:06] facebook can be also known what is it
[1:27:08] the next stage of in the internet
[1:27:12] higher going into another realm
[1:27:16] anybody here
[1:27:27] coming together making what man is
[1:27:29] calling
[1:27:44] church
[1:27:46] what's going on out there
[1:27:48] and everything he does watch watch us
[1:27:51] now
[1:27:52] meta means to rise above me
[1:27:57] and go beyond
[1:28:20] it says it's a highly immersive
[1:28:22] uh
[1:28:24] virtual world
[1:28:40] realm it takes you to
[1:28:43] possibly an infinite number of parallel
[1:28:46] universes
[1:28:50] what is
[1:28:52] what's the inspiration behind all this
[1:29:22] where there is salvation
[1:29:25] where god is speaking to his people
[1:29:28] and take them into another realm
[1:29:31] where god does not exist at all
[1:29:36] taking you to another realm
[1:29:39] where you become god
[1:29:42] this is what this metaverse is all about
[1:29:46] it's another realm
[1:29:48] it's the evolution of this
[1:29:51] those of you that know about
[1:29:52] cryptocurrency it'll work hand in hand
[1:29:54] with this
[1:29:55] cryptocurrency
[1:29:56] and once everything is set up to work
[1:29:59] through this metaverse
[1:30:05] they'll be able to
[1:30:06] freeze your accounts whenever they want
[1:30:11] they'll be able to
[1:30:13] keep you from buying and selling
[1:30:18] i'll go into to a different currency
[1:30:24] watch out how tremendous this is it
[1:30:26] seems
[1:30:27] like such a wonderful thing
[1:30:30] and especially the new generation is wow
[1:31:00] buy
[1:31:13] all kinds of other things that are just
[1:31:14] not good
[1:31:17] what's the purpose of this question
[1:31:21] it's for you to make your own world
[1:31:23] espera
[1:31:26] it's for you to rule your own world
[1:31:31] it's for you to think of yourself as the
[1:31:34] god of your world
[1:31:38] why do you think people are that's where
[1:31:39] they're at nowadays
[1:31:41] they're sick and tired of their lives
[1:31:43] san casaus
[1:31:44] they get bored of going to church
[1:31:47] they're bored of doing all these things
[1:31:48] they can't send themselves they want to
[1:31:50] change they didn't come behind they get
[1:31:51] bored of their spouse they can't
[1:31:53] understand another one because they get
[1:31:55] bored and bored they never get
[1:32:50] sons and daughters now have that power
[1:32:52] inside
[1:33:06] is not
[1:33:21] that's almost
[1:33:22] it's not us as men
[1:33:25] but it is the hearing in him
[1:33:28] that when he speaks
[1:33:30] those are words of creation
[1:33:33] now think about this for a moment
[1:33:37] we live in three dimensions
[1:33:41] how saying perverts
[1:33:44] tries to skip the process
[1:33:47] a faster easier route
[1:33:51] and the formula
[1:33:53] formula is that
[1:33:55] he wants to do he's got a formula too
[1:33:59] but his formula brings death
[1:34:01] to formula
[1:34:02] god's
[1:34:19] [Music]
[1:34:44] sometimes he didn't know what world he
[1:34:46] was in listen
[1:34:48] watch the perversion now
[1:34:51] we'll take them into his metaverse
[1:34:55] and they sooner or later italian temple
[1:34:57] will not know what world they belong
[1:35:04] come on they have created such a fantasy
[1:35:06] in their minds
[1:35:09] it's a way of escape for them
[1:35:12] but it's the
[1:35:26] the antichrist spirit is working
[1:35:31] my god spirit is working also all over
[1:35:33] the world
[1:35:36] acting in the religious world
[1:35:39] politics the tech world whatever world
[1:35:42] secular world whatever you want to do
[1:35:45] it has become a conglomeration of every
[1:35:48] foul and filthy spirit
[1:35:52] that has come out of the bottomless pit
[1:35:54] canceling
[1:36:00] and the rest of the men
[1:36:02] which were not killed by these plagues
[1:36:06] yet they repented not of the works
[1:36:08] of their hands
[1:36:11] that they should not worship devils and
[1:36:13] idols of gold and silver brass stone of
[1:36:16] wood which neither can see nor hear nor
[1:36:19] walk
[1:36:48] we can go into the religious realm of it
[1:36:50] and tell you what it is there we can go
[1:36:51] into the world and tell you what it is
[1:36:53] there but it's all made by human hands
[1:36:57] think about that for a moment
[1:36:59] because this this this brings us to an
[1:37:01] understanding
[1:37:04] what are these idols
[1:37:06] says anything you put before god is an
[1:37:09] idol
[1:37:11] it don't matter what it is
[1:37:13] religious or not religious and that
[1:37:15] doesn't matter
[1:37:17] and an idol in the bible
[1:37:20] is a representation of a being or person
[1:37:24] persona
[1:37:26] what is it called in in in the games in
[1:37:29] in computers
[1:37:32] there you go somebody knows
[1:37:36] anything that you create of yourself
[1:37:42] you ever try to build the person that's
[1:37:45] you're texting and you've got a little
[1:37:53] this is the best rendition that i could
[1:37:54] come up with of myself
[1:37:59] i tried to make one the other day
[1:38:03] i could just send it out with somebody
[1:38:04] and i could just be waving or what or
[1:38:05] not you know with dumb ideas
[1:38:09] but i could not find one that had a
[1:38:11] receding hairline
[1:38:27] it's what's representing you right
[1:38:31] it's what's representing you
[1:38:34] you naked
[1:38:35] so you're in the game
[1:38:37] and you're playing and it's like if you
[1:38:39] oh that's me that's playing oh yeah
[1:38:41] what is it
[1:38:42] doing the same effect that drugs do on
[1:38:44] you right
[1:38:47] but now it's you can see something that
[1:38:49] at least looks like you pero
[1:38:53] avatars
[1:38:54] and it's a graphic icon
[1:39:23] in other words an avatar is the gods who
[1:39:25] come down upon the earth
[1:39:30] amongst humans
[1:39:32] isn't that what happened in the time of
[1:39:33] paul
[1:39:35] pablo
[1:39:37] acts 14 if you want to you can write it
[1:39:39] down and read it later
[1:39:42] right paul prays for a crippled man that
[1:39:44] had been crippled from his mother's womb
[1:40:19] produced by man's imagination
[1:40:24] now get this
[1:40:25] the god baal
[1:40:28] right bill
[1:40:29] yeah bye here see them all through the
[1:40:31] bible
[1:40:33] it was produced by
[1:41:15] is
[1:41:30] the inspiration
[1:41:45] como es que von d'or the facebook
[1:41:46] repeated himself time and time again
[1:41:50] all he kept saying was imagine a world
[1:41:55] imagine
[1:41:56] imagine what could be imagined
[1:42:11] there's an inspiration there
[1:42:26] us as
[1:42:38] and we don't see any farther than this
[1:42:42] and when it's too late
[1:42:46] they're hooked on a tablet
[1:43:05] trying to make everyone a god using
[1:43:08] their
[1:43:21] serpent tells a woman you shall not
[1:43:22] surely die
[1:43:25] god knows the day that you eat thereof
[1:43:28] your eyes will be opened
[1:43:30] you shall be as gods
[1:43:36] come on now he didn't forget that
[1:43:39] still trying to get there
[1:43:45] he's still trying to be that himself
[1:43:50] he has many worshipping him that don't
[1:43:51] even know it
[1:43:54] but our doctrine is still the same
[1:43:57] is not a creator
[1:43:59] fear him he's not a creator
[1:44:02] can't be a perverter
[1:44:25] well there's no such a thing as devices
[1:44:27] in the bible there's no electronics
[1:44:31] those problems
[1:44:44] that's why people are looking for a way
[1:44:46] out
[1:44:59] everyone do the imagination of his evil
[1:45:02] heart
[1:45:06] every word devises their means
[1:45:12] for
[1:45:26] it is to invent or make something
[1:45:28] especially
[1:45:41] through the imagination of
[1:45:54] it is a repeat of genesis 6 5.
[1:46:23] and they have all
[1:46:24] one
[1:46:39] brother jerry i want to ask you a
[1:46:40] question
[1:46:42] in this virtual computer world and
[1:46:44] estimate how software and things are
[1:46:46] made
[1:46:47] how many languages
[1:46:49] are
[1:46:52] there at the end of the day there's just
[1:46:55] one language
[1:46:57] it don't matter where you live in china
[1:46:59] russia puerto rico and or united states
[1:47:01] or wherever
[1:47:03] they all only use one language
[1:47:05] zeros and ones
[1:47:09] can i get a verification brother roger
[1:47:11] back there
[1:47:13] all right all right thanks now we got in
[1:47:15] the mouth of two or three weeks
[1:47:18] notices now one language
[1:47:20] using
[1:48:04] come on now church
[1:48:06] then you have
[1:48:08] a bunch of little worlds
[1:48:11] and everybody's mad
[1:48:14] because you don't fit in their world no
[1:48:15] no no no because
[1:48:30] because
[1:48:31] you don't tolerate their nonsense
[1:48:38] you got to put up with everybody's
[1:48:39] ideologies nowadays
[1:48:43] that's funny
[1:48:45] they want you to respect their ideology
[1:48:50] when a christian stands up for his
[1:48:53] beliefs
[1:48:57] can't create
[1:49:08] hello everybody
[1:49:16] what
[1:49:17] does the imagination with the wrong
[1:49:19] inspiration do
[1:49:23] converts what god has created
[1:49:40] or something
[1:49:54] is
[1:50:09] you you've got to know the compoundness
[1:50:10] of it
[1:50:11] put on your spiritual capsule
[1:50:15] they don't know what realm they belong
[1:50:17] to
[1:50:19] and therefore it comes
[1:50:20] in
[1:50:21] the insanity of humanity
[1:50:45] i want to know what's really happening
[1:50:46] in the spiritual with god's people
[1:51:18] this morning worlds are being formed
[1:51:24] for him to be perverted
[1:51:28] the formula of creation oh my lord
[1:51:30] formula
[1:51:33] are you comfortable with everybody
[1:51:35] i gotta finish this right
[1:51:37] watch this now the formula of creation
[1:51:39] the formula
[1:51:41] christ has the formula of life
[1:51:45] has the formula of death
[1:52:15] writes a prescription
[1:52:17] don't let these quack drugs try to mess
[1:52:20] with it
[1:52:25] they give you too much antidote it won't
[1:52:27] help
[1:52:55] peter the apostle peter spoke
[1:53:09] what was the formula
[1:53:24] you shall receive it
[1:53:26] it's a formula
[1:53:28] formula of life
[1:53:32] take it or leave it
[1:53:36] the formula
[1:53:38] formula when it comes to creation
[1:53:44] there's three things that entail it
[1:53:48] if you're writing it down write this
[1:53:49] down
[1:53:51] three parts
[1:54:08] and if you go and trace those three
[1:54:10] words you'll find them all the way
[1:54:12] through the scriptures
[1:54:15] all associated with each other
[1:54:20] i'm not talking about man's wisdom or
[1:54:21] knowledge i'm talking about god's wisdom
[1:54:25] and any time that science breaks things
[1:54:27] down
[1:54:30] you understand creation
[1:54:33] they break it down to the cells
[1:54:37] to the molecule ala molecules to the
[1:54:39] atoms
[1:54:40] protons
[1:54:41] the neutrons
[1:54:43] all the way down to the electrons the
[1:54:45] photons
[1:54:46] electronics but when it's all said and
[1:54:48] done electrons they can only go back as
[1:54:50] far as what
[1:54:52] is that
[1:54:55] light
[1:54:56] loose
[1:54:58] they can trace it to the light
[1:55:01] loose that's as far as they can go
[1:55:02] faster
[1:55:04] that's why saiyan is not a creator
[1:55:07] he was all lucifer
[1:55:09] he was the light bearer
[1:55:12] but he was not the light
[1:55:15] he cannot create
[1:55:44] what's wrong
[1:55:46] we need some help over here
[1:55:49] is your is your microphone okay
[1:55:51] i just can't hear myself okay
[1:55:53] all right somebody help him hear himself
[1:55:56] all right
[1:55:58] all right here we go
[1:56:02] he was a bearer of lights
[1:56:04] right amanda there's many people that
[1:56:06] bear a lot of things i wish i could get
[1:56:08] this game i hold things
[1:56:10] but the question is
[1:56:12] they have
[1:56:26] light
[1:56:28] who was that light
[1:56:30] it was the same one from the beginning
[1:56:36] it's the same one
[1:56:38] came and embodied himself in a man
[1:56:54] what a tremendous thing
[1:57:01] he wanted
[1:57:03] to mix the elements his way
[1:57:08] he wanted to take the ingredients and
[1:57:10] make his own
[1:57:11] creations
[1:57:18] that's what a formula is
[1:57:20] in a formula
[1:57:22] that's what a formula is a formula a
[1:57:26] formula
[1:57:27] is the authoritative procedure
[1:57:33] or method
[1:57:35] that must be followed
[1:58:18] how many want to know the formula of
[1:58:19] creation
[1:58:21] let's see how god created it
[1:58:24] 3 19.

[1:58:36] and by understanding
[1:58:38] hath he established the heavens
[1:58:41] he created the heavens and the earth
[1:58:45] he founded the earth
[1:59:00] and the clouds drop down the dew
[1:59:03] are you getting it
[1:59:05] what is understanding
[1:59:07] it's what has been established
[1:59:10] or perfected in the heavens
[1:59:14] that's what moses was looking at
[1:59:16] perfection of it that perfectly he saw
[1:59:19] the temple in heaven
[1:59:20] it was perfect
[1:59:22] that's what understanding is
[1:59:25] like this what has been established or
[1:59:27] perfected in the heaven
[2:00:07] to know how to control the knowledge
[2:00:38] the second

[2:01:10] little right

[2:03:48] we can say a lot of different things
[2:03:49] from different angles
[2:03:52] brother abraham's favorite angle of
[2:04:05] the problem is is we see wisdom as
[2:04:07] something
[2:04:08] out there
[2:04:19] wisdom has become a person
[2:04:22] a person
[2:04:50] i

[2:10:03] i'm going around the corner
[2:10:05] that when the holy ghost comes into our
[2:10:07] hearts
[2:10:09] creative power
[2:10:12] power of faith
[2:10:26] you're the son
[2:10:41] god
[2:10:43] he just speaks the word
[2:10:46] and it creates himself
[2:10:50] that's right
[2:10:51] his words is the creative power
[2:11:09] not in some other make-believe world no
[2:11:11] no
[2:11:14] word the very voice
[2:11:17] their very command
[2:11:20] is creative power
[2:11:22] because
[2:11:48] sons and daughters of god would create
[2:11:50] them a world because
[2:11:54] out here and go live a private life on
[2:11:56] it
[2:11:59] but he hasn't called us to a private
[2:12:00] life
[2:12:03] all those you have fellowship
[2:12:18] but it
[2:12:32] any kind of power
[2:12:35] forcing the people to do certain things
[2:12:38] that doesn't produce power
[2:12:40] but the word in its rightful place
[2:13:27] it makes all the difference in the
[2:13:28] church
[2:13:30] the atmosphere
[2:13:32] you take a good woman
