[34:15] I've always
[34:17] as brother will said
[34:19] the other day
[34:21] that there was 14 of us
[34:26] [Music]
[34:32] but we went as one
[34:38] and in the scripture in Acts 2 chapter 2
[34:42] verse 1 yen is
[34:48] and when the day of Pentecost was fully
[34:51] come steps
[34:56] they were all with one Accord
[34:59] o
[35:03] in one place
[35:05] a
[35:08] I was reading the message of brother
[35:11] Branham is
[35:16] of questions and answers
[35:20] the Holy Ghost
[35:23] the El Espiritu Santo
[35:26] and this to me
[35:30] is exactly what happened there in Uganda
[35:33] yesterday and
[35:37] Uganda
[35:38] when the day of Pentecost was fully come
[35:41] Santo
[35:44] they were all in one mind is
[35:50] now I like that better

[35:56] because you could be one in Una cuerdo
[36:00] record upon most any subject
[36:07] but their minds but here their minds was
[36:10] the same
[36:13] one mind
[36:15] and in the same place
[36:20] and to see the interaction with the
[36:24] different Brothers
[36:32] it was beautiful to see that
[36:37] each and every one of them
[36:40] it didn't matter who we are or where we
[36:43] came from
[36:47] we never went anywhere
[36:49] unless we made sure that we were all
[36:52] accounted foreign

[37:09] and following the leading of the Holy
[37:12] Ghost thing

[37:24] one of the things that impacted me the
[37:26] most Una de las cosas

[37:50] and as we were getting ready to go turn
[37:54] on the road
[37:59] to go up to his church Iglesia
[38:06] the bus
[38:07] couldn't make it up the hill because
[38:14] of the rain
[38:17] so it
[38:20] so it couldn't make it because the dirt
[38:23] was slippery it was muddy

[38:43] salimos for things

[38:48] towards the church
[38:57] and what was so beautiful to me
[39:02] was that
[39:03] they
[39:05] as we were walking up it appeared to be
[39:07] at least a hundred yards
[39:11] [Music]
[39:17] not more
[39:19] to where the church was
[39:21] and to see a group of people
[39:25] hermanus

[40:53] we got into the church
[40:58] to me that
[41:00] was so beautiful to see the love of the
[41:02] people

[41:46] is is that is is that if they had seen
[41:50] me before yes

[42:01] that
[42:02] we were all one we went as one

[42:11] different than they treated the rest of
[42:12] the brothers that had been there before

[48:44] amen what a subject we continue to have
[48:48] here
[48:50] be grateful to God we were able to go to
[48:52] a wedding this week
[48:56] goes to Phoenix we must have Phoenix or
[48:59] of our niece
[49:04] amen may God bless them in their
[49:07] marriage earn and Jimmy
[49:09] amen when we talk about worship
[49:14] most people will use the word or the
[49:17] term worship with interchangeably with
[49:20] praise everybody
[49:25] when we talk about worship we say oh
[49:27] we're going to worship and let's go
[49:28] worship and praise the Lord
[49:31] and we interchange the word worship
[49:35] as I said with praise
[49:37] with giving Glory With Honor
[49:42] magnify to bless and all these things
[49:46] they are associated with worship
[49:51] but it doesn't mean that because you do
[49:54] these things that there is real worship
[50:01] doesn't mean just because you you praise
[50:03] or you do these things that you are
[50:05] giving true worship
[50:09] because worship is a mystery
[50:13] I want you to tell your neighbor that so
[50:15] that your neighbor knows very well
[50:17] neighbor
[50:18] worship is a mystery
[50:23] how many believe that
[50:25] Amen in in understanding or
[50:29] distinguishing between praise and
[50:31] worship
[50:34] I think it was best put When It Was
[50:37] Written like this
[50:40] praise is about God
[50:44] worship is to God
[50:48] you get that I'm going to say it again
[50:51] praise is about God is
[50:58] praise is opening up
[51:01] worship is entering
[51:05] you get that one all right I'm going to
[51:09] say it again praise is opening up
[51:12] worship is entering In
[51:16] Praise Is boldly declaring
[51:22] worship is humbly bowing
[52:07] and when you bring the word worship into
[52:10] the English language
[52:14] you can see up there it comes from two
[52:17] words
[52:19] and sip we also
[52:23] sip worth
[52:26] means or we are it means worth worth
[52:32] and sip or ship means the quality or
[52:36] condition
[52:38] so when you come to the word worship
[52:42] it is the quality of having worth
[52:47] so anything that we worship
[52:50] we are putting worth too
[52:54] okay and we worship the people today
[52:58] worship many things
[53:00] which one has their Idols
[53:03] which one has their churches
[53:06] each one has things that are more
[53:08] important in life
[53:10] but when the real believer comes to it
[53:15] they are the only ones that can give God
[53:18] the worth that he deserves
[53:22] amen this morning I'm gonna say it one
[53:25] more time
[53:44] and
[53:51] we are proclaiming in this dark world
[53:56] that he alone is worthy
[54:00] now only the the true worshiper can can
[54:03] ascribe that to him
[54:07] the Bible says in Psalms 29 2.
[54:12] give unto the Lord the glory do unto his
[54:16] name
[54:18] and Worship the Lord in the beauty of
[54:22] Holiness
[54:25] you can't talk about worship without
[54:28] mentioning praise
[54:32] for praise would be like the attribute
[54:35] or a part of worship
[54:39] that's why these two words are used so
[54:42] commonly together
[54:45] they are often used interchangeably at
[54:48] times
[54:51] but though one cannot have true worship
[54:56] without it producing praise
[55:00] one can praise without producing worship
[55:05] amen for instance if you take and we say
[55:08] we praise our children when they do
[55:11] something something good foreign
[55:26] that doesn't mean that we worship them
[55:29] yet on the other hand
[55:32] we cannot Worship the Lord
[55:35] without it producing praise
[55:38] now there's some there's a few words
[55:41] that I want to go over with you
[55:44] because it helps us to break it down and
[55:47] to understand what a true worshiper
[55:49] really is
[55:51] in the Hebrew there are a few words
[55:55] that we want to go over
[55:57] the first word if they put it up there
[56:00] is
[56:02] this word yado means to worship with
[56:06] extended hands
[56:09] giving thanks to God
[56:12] it is often a cry for help
[56:18] when we are in Desperate Straits and
[56:21] need a victory this is
[56:28] raising our hands is one of the most
[56:31] explosive and meaningful expressions of
[56:34] Praise
[56:36] can we raise our hands this morning
[56:40] this morning look at your neighbor say
[56:43] neighbor this is explosives
[56:47] what an expression of praise it is
[56:51] because it is also the international
[56:54] sign of surrender
[56:57] it is
[57:03] you gotta put some effort into it
[57:07] the Bible says in Psalms 134 2.
[57:13] stop your hands in the sanctuary
[57:17] bless the Lord
[57:19] one more time can we all lift our hands
[57:22] in the sanctuary
[57:45] because it says once again you've got to
[57:48] be tuned into his presence
[57:51] if we just say oh I'm in a prayer
[57:56] does us no good if we are not tuned into
[57:59] his presence
[58:03] it is the privilege I like this Barack
[58:08] is the privilege
[58:10] of blessing the Lord in other words each
[58:14] one of us has been given a privilege
[58:17] to be able to bless the Lord this
[58:20] morning
[58:22] that's why job could say
[58:27] and the lord taketh away yes but blessed
[58:31] be the name of the Lord
[58:34] the next word is
[58:38] it is to sing or to Lord's praise is
[58:44] because
[59:00] he doesn't just sing at church
[59:03] all day long
[59:07] good job brother keep it up
[59:09] there are over 300 mandates in the Bible
[59:13] that they tell us to sing
[59:17] God helps his children
[59:20] so that your children can remember
[59:25] he tells his children he says this is
[59:27] your children
[59:29] of What the Lord Has Done
[59:31] teach them in songs
[59:34] teach them in poems
[59:37] it is our blessing to be able to worship
[59:41] God in spirit and in truth
[59:46] habits the Praises of Israel
[59:51] how many know that once again God
[59:55] inhabits the Praises
[59:59] he inhabits the Praises
[1:00:02] and you tell your neighbor he inhabits
[1:00:05] the Praises in other words
[1:00:09] that's where he lives
[1:00:12] the word zamar la palabra then is to
[1:00:16] pluck the strings of an instrument
[1:00:20] and while you're plucking to sing
[1:00:22] praises
[1:00:25] it speaks of rejoicing
[1:00:30] it is translated into the New Testament
[1:00:35] as the word
[1:00:40] Ephesians 5 19 would you put it up there
[1:00:48] speaking to yourselves in Psalms and
[1:00:51] hymns and spiritual songs
[1:00:56] singing and making melody in your heart
[1:00:59] to the Lord
[1:01:04] amen what is verse 26.
[1:01:09] okay okay go to verse 19. huh
[1:01:14] nosis wow
[1:01:22] singing and making Melody just in your
[1:01:25] mouth
[1:01:26] no it says making melody in your heart
[1:01:31] the next one we find is
[1:01:35] same root as yada
[1:01:38] but it literally means an extension of
[1:01:41] the hands in adoration
[1:01:45] and then comes the word
[1:01:49] which means to shout
[1:01:52] or a dress with a loud voice
[1:01:57] here today
[1:02:00] all right we got a few of them anybody
[1:02:03] else want to do a Shabbat today
[1:02:06] and we do it all together
[1:02:13] oh okay now we'll make sure you're awake
[1:02:16] this morning
[1:02:17] I need a little Foundation this morning
[1:02:20] okay let's see the let's see a Shabbat
[1:02:23] from the from the young people one two
[1:02:25] three
[1:02:27] minutes they're awake
[1:02:29] all right
[1:02:32] it's to shout or address with a loud
[1:02:35] voice
[1:02:38] is even deeper than that
[1:02:42] it includes an attitude of gratitude
[1:02:48] for God's promises
[1:02:51] even while still in need
[1:02:56] let me this is a good one
[1:03:00] once again
[1:03:02] it is to have gratitude
[1:03:05] for God's promises
[1:03:08] even when you're still in need
[1:03:12] that's usually the time that we lose the
[1:03:14] worship
[1:03:18] the time I guess the Lord don't love me
[1:03:23] raise your voice
[1:03:27] and give God the Gratitude
[1:03:31] it's to be surrounded by the enemies
[1:03:36] and still maintain your faith in God
[1:03:41] even before the victory arrives
[1:03:45] are already Victorious yes how many
[1:03:49] believe that this morning
[1:03:51] amen amen
[1:03:54] then it means to dance
[1:03:57] or sometimes we have a we can dance good
[1:04:00] at home
[1:04:02] we don't like to dance Too Much at
[1:04:04] church
[1:04:07] oh that's all right no not in church no
[1:04:10] no that's where you should eyes where
[1:04:14] you go
[1:04:15] I'm gonna remember David
[1:04:17] when the ark came back to Israel
[1:04:21] did he just say oh well I'm glad you
[1:04:24] have the ark back okay we dance so much
[1:04:28] in the spirit
[1:04:30] that even his wife was a little ashamed
[1:04:33] of him
[1:04:35] but when you have Quran
[1:04:38] who's around you know he was looking at
[1:04:42] you
[1:04:45] I think we need some qurar once in a
[1:04:47] while
[1:04:49] then there is
[1:04:52] which means to clap your hands
[1:04:56] somebody can clap and give one to the
[1:04:58] Lord this morning
[1:04:59] that is
[1:05:02] and then you come to the the most
[1:05:05] well-known praise word that there is for
[1:05:08] praise
[1:05:10] can anyone tell me what it is
[1:05:15] hallelujah hallelujah amen Hallelujah
[1:05:20] it is the Premier word for praise in the
[1:05:23] Bible
[1:05:25] it transcends the languages of the world
[1:05:30] it no matter what what language or what
[1:05:33] nation we go to visit
[1:05:36] everybody knows what Hallelujah means
[1:05:41] Hallelujah means praise to the Lord
[1:05:44] it is not translated
[1:05:48] how many know that the word hallelujah
[1:05:51] is not translated
[1:05:55] it is transliterated
[1:05:59] it is the outcry
[1:06:02] of one is who is excited about God is
[1:06:11] oh come on
[1:06:13] some of you are still half asleep
[1:06:15] I'm going to say it again
[1:06:18] it is the outcry of one who was excited
[1:06:21] about God
[1:06:24] hallelujah
[1:06:26] means you're excited
[1:06:28] is there anyone that's excited this
[1:06:30] morning
[1:06:32] Hallelujah come on can we can I get
[1:06:35] another Hallelujah
[1:06:37] excited about God
[1:06:40] yet you find people after so many years
[1:06:43] in the message
[1:06:47] to lose their Hallelujah
[1:06:52] it's one of the worst things that could
[1:06:54] ever happen to a Believer
[1:06:57] when we're not excited about the things
[1:07:00] of God
[1:07:02] it's when we get cold and indifference
[1:07:06] notice this word hallelujah
[1:07:09] it is used only 24 times in the old
[1:07:12] testamentos
[1:07:14] all between Psalms 104 and Psalms 150.
[1:07:18] it is
[1:07:21] the ultimate exaltation
[1:07:26] you won't find the word hallelujah in
[1:07:28] the Old Testament
[1:07:30] but what you find is praise the Lord
[1:07:37] that means Hallelujah
[1:07:40] that is Hebrew Hallelujah
[1:07:43] and it is used four times in the New
[1:07:46] Testament
[1:07:48] all in Revelations chapter 19.
[1:07:53] and after these things
[1:07:55] I heard a great voice of many people in
[1:07:59] heaven
[1:08:01] saying Hallelujah
[1:08:04] Salvation and Glory salvation an honor
[1:08:08] and Power
[1:08:24] are commanded to praise the Lord
[1:08:30] ah all the inhabitants of the Earth
[1:08:34] are commanded to praise the lord
[1:08:38] we can praise the Lord in singing and
[1:08:42] shouting foreign
[1:09:11] that's right once again praise is the
[1:09:14] outward expression
[1:09:16] external worship is the inward
[1:09:19] Revelation
[1:09:21] praise does not require anything of us
[1:09:25] it is merely the truthful
[1:09:29] acknowledgmento of the righteous acts
[1:09:33] the losses of God Almighty
[1:09:36] and since he has done many wonderful
[1:09:39] Deeds
[1:09:41] he alone is worthy of Our Praise
[1:09:45] You See worship comes from a different
[1:09:48] place within us
[1:09:54] worship comes from a different place
[1:09:56] within us
[1:09:59] worship comes from within it should be
[1:10:03] reserved for God Alone
[1:10:07] worship is the art of surrendering
[1:10:12] and losing oneself in the Adoration of
[1:10:15] another
[1:10:17] praise can be a part of worship
[1:10:22] but worship goes beyond praise
[1:10:26] there's a lot of Praise that goes on in
[1:10:29] the churches
[1:10:32] but very little worship that really goes
[1:10:34] on
[1:10:36] Hallelujah I'm going to say it one more
[1:10:39] time there's a lot of Praise going on in
[1:10:42] the church
[1:10:44] there's a lot of movement and dancing
[1:10:48] brother Branham was asked the question
[1:10:52] what does it mean when he says when the
[1:10:55] Bible says that bodily exercise profit
[1:10:58] is external
[1:11:21] in English
[1:11:23] it's good a little bit it's when we're
[1:11:25] spooky though but people think that
[1:11:26] because they jump and Shout
[1:11:29] that they are worshiping
[1:11:32] that doesn't equal that is even though a
[1:11:36] worshiper can jump in shouts
[1:11:40] but not everybody that jumps and shouts
[1:11:42] is the worship
[1:11:44] are you with me we can express ourselves
[1:11:48] in different ways
[1:11:50] but the true test is what is on the
[1:11:53] inside
[1:11:54] it is the Revelation the revealing of
[1:11:57] the word
[1:11:59] that he has unveiled in the heart of the
[1:12:02] Believers
[1:12:04] that will determine the type of
[1:12:06] worshiper that you really are
[1:12:14] it is impossible it's impossible
[1:12:17] to worship God
[1:12:20] and someone or something else at the
[1:12:23] same time
[1:12:26] God will not share his worship with Noah
[1:12:32] try to live like the world
[1:12:35] and then try to live in church
[1:12:38] it doesn't it doesn't go together
[1:12:41] because sooner or later your Folly is
[1:12:44] going to be made known
[1:12:47] here Jesus in Luke 4 8 tell Satan Lucas
[1:12:52] it is written Thou shalt Worship the
[1:12:56] Lord thy God
[1:13:01] can we all said together and him only
[1:13:06] shout thou serve
[1:13:40] worship the father
[1:13:43] what about the Gentiles
[1:13:45] you'll get to us in a minute
[1:13:48] he worship and ye know not what
[1:13:53] we know what we worship
[1:13:56] for salvation is of the Jews
[1:14:05] and now is when the true worshipers
[1:14:10] shall worship the father now he's
[1:14:14] including me and you
[1:14:15] now worship the father
[1:14:18] in spirit
[1:14:22] father seeking such to worship
[1:14:25] God is a spirit now notice the true
[1:14:29] worshiper
[1:14:31] yes the worshiper who knows the truth
[1:14:37] you don't just go to church and get a oh
[1:14:40] that felt
[1:14:42] goodness I felt to tingle down my spine
[1:14:46] and all of a sudden you're a worshiper
[1:14:49] the true worshiper knows the truth
[1:14:54] receive the truth
[1:14:56] found himself in the truth
[1:15:00] you shall know the truth
[1:15:03] and the truth shall make you free
[1:15:07] now Revelations chapter six if you can
[1:15:10] turn in your scriptures
[1:15:16] this is so tremendous when it comes to
[1:15:19] the worshipers
[1:15:21] and when he had opened the third seal
[1:15:25] I heard the third Beast
[1:15:34] what an invitation
[1:15:38] and when I came to see he says I beheld
[1:15:41] and lower Black Horse
[1:15:44] and he that sat on him had a pair of
[1:15:46] balances in his hands
[1:15:51] if you go back to the beginning of
[1:15:54] Revelations chapter 5 and read the
[1:15:56] chapter
[1:15:58] who is it that is speaking here
[1:16:02] somebody help me out
[1:16:08] who's speaking every time a seal is open
[1:16:16] you try
[1:16:20] to try
[1:16:22] but every time he opened
[1:16:25] one of the seals was opened
[1:16:28] there was a voice that said come and see
[1:16:31] the limitations
[1:16:34] who's the one that was making the
[1:16:37] invitations
[1:16:41] oh come on you're looking at me like you
[1:16:43] have no idea what I'm saying
[1:16:52] I ain't gonna preach no more until you
[1:16:54] give me the answer is
[1:17:00] me and you will read
[1:17:08] I gave you a clue
[1:17:11] start reading from chapter one
[1:17:16] the revelation
[1:17:23] okay ministers you can jump in anytime
[1:17:26] you like to
[1:17:27] when a lot of ministers
[1:17:47] some of you not
[1:17:50] oh oh honey I need somebody got it we
[1:17:53] can go on now
[1:17:56] look it says Revelation 6 1 right okay
[1:18:00] watching Revelation six one and it was
[1:18:03] my fault because I said Revelation 5
[1:18:04] right
[1:18:11] foreign
[1:18:39] we're gonna have to have a study just on
[1:18:43] chapter six of Revelation
[1:18:45] was a lion exactly right and then came
[1:18:49] now and that was he's saying come and
[1:18:51] see and that was the there was a white
[1:18:52] horse right
[1:18:54] and so we go to the second one and so
[1:18:57] forth and we don't want to that's not
[1:18:58] our our subject today so much
[1:19:01] but every time a seal was pulled back or
[1:19:05] or broken open
[1:19:07] who's breaking open the seals
[1:19:12] but now we know that the lamb has come
[1:19:15] and sat on his throne
[1:19:19] and he's in this messenger yes
[1:19:23] through the messenger he's breaking the
[1:19:27] still open is that right amen now now we
[1:19:30] know that that's that should be ABCs
[1:19:33] but this is the part that I want to get
[1:19:36] so when he opened the third sale foreign
[1:19:51] it's a living creature
[1:19:54] a beast right but not therion
[1:19:58] no this is a living creature right
[1:20:01] and so when we when we see this
[1:20:05] and they each one as a seal is open
[1:20:09] creature is saying something
[1:20:13] but in the midst of all this
[1:20:16] oh I like this
[1:20:18] it is him speaking and I beheld in lower
[1:20:23] Black Horse
[1:20:24] and he that sat upon him had a pair of
[1:20:27] balances in his hands
[1:20:30] and so we see it's the same message come
[1:20:33] and see
[1:20:35] that Philip tells Nathaniel
[1:20:39] can anything good come out of Nazareth
[1:20:43] and Philip says well come and see
[1:20:46] Philippines and the same message
[1:20:49] these living creatures
[1:20:51] are giving the same message
[1:20:56] why he's about to uncover Satan and his
[1:20:59] plan
[1:21:02] but this is where it really gets
[1:21:04] interesting
[1:21:06] come and see means that you got to come
[1:21:09] and understand it for yourself
[1:21:16] you gotta know for yourself
[1:21:21] the greatest message you can ever tell
[1:21:23] anyone
[1:21:26] but watch now as it changes in verse six
[1:21:32] Revelation 6 6. Revelation says and I
[1:21:36] Heard a Voice
[1:21:37] this voice
[1:21:52] that begins to talk okay
[1:21:56] a measure of wheat for a penny he says
[1:22:01] and three measures of barley for a penny
[1:22:04] he says
[1:22:05] and see thou hurt not the oil and the
[1:22:10] wine
[1:22:11] wait a minute here this is good stuff
[1:22:15] as these living creatures are speaking
[1:22:20] there comes a voice from the midst of
[1:22:23] those living creatures
[1:22:26] hold on a minute
[1:22:29] or this gets any further
[1:22:32] yeah I'm here to tell you
[1:22:35] don't you touch the oil nor the wine
[1:22:39] is
[1:22:49] oh good one how many agree with brother
[1:22:52] with brother brother Diego
[1:22:55] who's speaking now
[1:22:59] it's the lamb in the midst of it all
[1:23:03] come on
[1:23:05] in the midst of it all the lamb Rises
[1:23:11] don't you hurt the oil nor the ones
[1:23:15] oh I like that now there's another voice
[1:23:19] coming forth
[1:23:21] he's in the middle of the four living
[1:23:24] creatures
[1:23:25] because the throne is in the middle
[1:23:28] oh yes it belongs to the lamb
[1:23:33] and this was so important is
[1:23:36] that the lamb couldn't have anyone speak
[1:23:40] first so
[1:23:46] Where is the hallelujahs
[1:23:50] where is the shouts understand
[1:23:52] where were you when the sons of God
[1:23:55] shouted for Joy
[1:23:58] when they were saying hallelujah
[1:24:02] okay so now the lamb our El Cordero says
[1:24:06] nobody's going to say this he said I
[1:24:08] gotta say it myself
[1:24:11] stands up and says don't hurt the oil
[1:24:14] nor the water
[1:24:18] my goodness watch as this voice comes
[1:24:22] forth
[1:24:23] selling I want you to notice
[1:24:26] in all of brother branham's Ministries
[1:24:30] he mentions oil and the wine a few times
[1:24:35] but he never explains the oil and the
[1:24:39] wine
[1:24:42] until he preaches the Sills
[1:24:49] I don't know about you but Jonah says
[1:24:51] this this excites me is
[1:24:54] I don't care about
[1:24:56] sports or anything else
[1:24:58] this is what makes me shout hallelujah
[1:25:02] notice this once again it wasn't until
[1:25:05] the seals that he begins to explain
[1:25:12] why because the lamb was now speaking
[1:25:16] from his throne
[1:25:19] the real perfect worship
[1:25:22] is a mystery and can only come
[1:25:27] here when the lamb breaks the Sills
[1:25:33] in other words there was worship before
[1:25:36] but I'm not like this worship
[1:25:39] this is when the lamb breaks open the
[1:25:42] seals
[1:25:44] and the real worshiper comes foreign
[1:26:26] Revelation 6 with Matthew
[1:26:30] it goes Perfecto
[1:26:33] the true worshipers
[1:26:36] worship the father father in spirit
[1:26:40] there's your oil
[1:26:43] there's your wine and this is what Jesus
[1:26:47] was talking about ah
[1:26:51] remember that well
[1:26:55] the hour is coming in now is
[1:26:58] but that hour was no longer coming
[1:27:02] that hour is no longer coming
[1:27:06] that hour is here
[1:27:12] you have an opportunity Church
[1:27:18] like no other human being
[1:27:24] I want you to get that this girl
[1:27:26] you have an opportunity this morning
[1:27:30] to worship God you say hallelujah
[1:27:34] like nobody's ever done it
[1:27:37] because the full truth
[1:27:47] and we can worship him on another level
[1:27:52] that when somebody says
[1:27:58] thank you
[1:27:59] best just to keep that one inside
[1:28:03] it begins to build up
[1:28:06] and you begin to shout hallelujah
[1:28:09] your Hallelujah Church
[1:28:13] the very foundations of Hell
[1:28:16] fundamentals take all of Heaven
[1:28:20] nobody has ever shouted Hallelujah like
[1:28:23] weeds
[1:28:25] but the question is are you shouting
[1:28:28] Hallelujah
[1:28:33] the hour has already
[1:28:35] Christ the anointed word of the hour
[1:28:40] and the prophet of the day is
[1:28:43] the word because the word he has the
[1:28:47] word porque
[1:28:48] he has the words and Jesus Christ in him
[1:28:52] makes him the anointed word of the hour
[1:28:57] Jesus Christ
[1:29:00] make us the Revelation
[1:29:03] I don't know if you're getting it the
[1:29:06] revelation of the whole thing
[1:29:10] what he says is
[1:29:14] because Jesus the word Jesus
[1:29:20] he is the word the anointed word
[1:29:24] the anointed Messiah
[1:29:27] is comfort and anointed people
[1:29:31] am I talking to anyone
[1:29:34] oh you ought to be shouting hallelujah
[1:29:38] oh come on is there anyone else that can
[1:29:41] shout hallelujah this morning Hallelujah
[1:29:45] it's the Revelation
[1:29:47] that Satan hates yes
[1:29:51] because it exposes his plan
[1:29:55] he hates Revelations and Genesis
[1:30:00] why is he so against Revelation
[1:30:04] because the entire Canon of God's word
[1:30:09] and God's Church
[1:30:12] solemnly built upon Revelation
[1:30:16] don't you hurt the oil nor the wine
[1:30:20] while the living creature saying come
[1:30:22] and see
[1:30:27] and says don't you hurt
[1:30:30] oh my
[1:30:32] what why would be we'd be afraid
[1:30:36] why are we afraid of anything why do we
[1:30:39] fear anything
[1:30:39] you know why because we haven't heard
[1:30:42] the lamb yet
[1:30:45] we've heard a lot of preachers
[1:30:50] I'm going to say it again we've heard a
[1:30:52] lot of preachers
[1:30:54] but we have not heard the Lambos the
[1:30:58] voice behind the voice
[1:31:00] oh come on now you you gotta say Amen
[1:31:03] this morning
[1:31:05] time to hear the Lambs
[1:31:08] we're the living creatures
[1:31:14] but now the lamb has spoken
[1:31:17] not the oil nor the wine
[1:31:21] watch what he says here in the message
[1:31:24] the third sale
[1:31:27] spirit and oil
[1:31:30] the oil is the spirit
[1:31:32] and the joy of the wine
[1:31:36] that spiritual life don't hurt that is
[1:31:42] [Music]
[1:31:45] remember the lamb speaking
[1:31:48] otherwise and this is this is in the
[1:31:51] third film
[1:31:52] otherwise Rome
[1:31:56] Roma
[1:31:58] don't you touch it
[1:32:02] it's mine it's Mio that
[1:32:05] belongs
[1:32:07] to me is
[1:32:12] what was it okay
[1:32:17] it wasn't a for beasts
[1:32:23] he's going to take his own
[1:32:27] that belongs to him
[1:32:30] he has redeemed it
[1:32:32] oh but don't hurt that oil and wine
[1:32:36] that's right
[1:32:39] listen to it now I like the way brother
[1:32:43] Brown says
[1:32:44] don't you heard it boy
[1:33:06] you understand boy
[1:33:11] you're gonna pay one of these days if
[1:33:13] you mess with it
[1:33:15] I don't mess with my children
[1:33:18] mess with the ones that I have put my
[1:33:21] holy ghost in I'm looking
[1:33:23] don't you mess with the ones
[1:33:26] that I am revealing myself
[1:33:30] and have the anointing
[1:33:34] emulation of the revelations
[1:33:37] don't mess with them
[1:33:41] you're gonna pay for it
[1:33:46] watch when he says as he goes on now the
[1:33:50] fourth cell
[1:33:51] watch he says now we gave an
[1:33:53] illustration
[1:33:55] oil and the wine was
[1:34:00] but let's review this again
[1:34:04] symbolizes the Holy Spirit
[1:34:08] like the foolish virgins
[1:34:12] with no oil
[1:34:14] but the wise virgins
[1:34:17] which is the holy spirit
[1:34:20] now watch as the lamb unfolds the
[1:34:23] mystery of worship
[1:34:29] it's not a mystery no more the lamb is
[1:34:31] now unfolding them
[1:34:34] oil symbolizes the Holy Spirit
[1:34:37] connectado
[1:34:53] you see why the lamb is saying what he's
[1:34:55] saying
[1:34:56] don't hurt the oil or the wine
[1:35:00] because that's where my worship comes
[1:35:03] from
[1:35:04] and you will not interfere with my words
[1:35:10] I don't know about you but that excites
[1:35:14] no one else boy
[1:35:22] sounds good
[1:35:25] you like that
[1:35:28] Nobody messes with my oil or wine boy
[1:35:40] so he sees him a little boy
[1:35:44] little boy
[1:35:47] could you say that the rest of the time
[1:35:49] I'm up here boy
[1:35:51] yeah boy
[1:35:54] what he says hey look at this thing
[1:35:56] that's what he called the end is
[1:36:00] his worship is only found in her
[1:36:06] there is no other group
[1:36:08] there is no other Church there is no one
[1:36:11] else on planet Earth
[1:36:13] no one else in heaven
[1:36:16] only in here
[1:36:19] the prophet of God says his worship is
[1:36:22] only found in Earth
[1:36:26] put your name is
[1:36:32] okay now put your name there come on
[1:36:34] guys come on sister his worship is only
[1:36:39] found in Solo

[1:36:49] mystery that's when Mysterio oh
[1:36:51] something that God said
[1:36:53] it's a mystery they can't understand it
[1:36:58] after a while God comes down and reveals
[1:37:01] it
[1:37:02] and then vindicates it
[1:37:05] and brother Branham continues
[1:37:07] between the sixth and the seventh seal
[1:37:10] says
[1:37:12] questions and answers on the Sills
[1:37:15] and they asked him after him preaching
[1:37:17] it is
[1:37:28] the oil we took as the symbol of the
[1:37:30] Holy Spirit
[1:37:32] Wine and oil is connected together
[1:37:36] in the Bible in worship
[1:37:40] the Wine El Vino the stimulation is
[1:37:47] you know when you get stimulated
[1:37:49] how many of you does the word of God

[1:41:51] Spirit
[1:41:53] God is the word in the beginning was the
[1:41:57] word the word
[1:41:59] the Word was God and the word became
[1:42:03] flesh and dwelt amongst us
[1:42:06] and it sits here in a natural form now
[1:42:09] yes
[1:42:11] the very word that had happened
[1:42:15] it now sits in its natural
[1:42:19] format Aki
[1:42:34] [Applause]
[1:42:57] I didn't know that till the other day
[1:43:08] is about to preach the seventh seal but
[1:43:11] uh
[1:43:13] questions and answers
[1:43:16] but did you notice how brother Branham
[1:43:19] starts the seventh seals
[1:43:22] I have read it recently
[1:43:25] he's talking about the Seven Silly and
[1:43:28] he says
[1:43:29] this is the eighth day he said
[1:43:33] what he says
[1:43:35] Eighth Day is eternal
[1:43:38] that right amen what he's about to bring
[1:43:42] a message
[1:43:51] he's already preached six seals they say
[1:43:55] you preach the Plan of Redemption but
[1:43:58] now the seventh seals which was the
[1:44:01] heart of the messenger
[1:44:04] it's now being broken
[1:44:09] to bring us higher into eternity
[1:44:15] to show the mystery of worship
[1:44:20] oh my God I can go into that for a while
[1:44:24] but I want to just continue to go let me
[1:44:27] see where I'm at I think I have about 15
[1:44:30] minutes
[1:44:32] we're all doing good that must be in all
[1:44:35] right
[1:44:36] Satan can impersonate the first and
[1:44:38] second pool
[1:44:41] but the third pool he knows nothing
[1:44:44] about
[1:44:45] because it is the
[1:44:48] revealingo the perfect word
[1:44:52] it is the complete revealing of the
[1:44:55] perfect worship
[1:44:57] from his throne is saying
[1:45:02] not the oil nor the one
[1:45:05] what is the stimulation of Revelations

[1:48:49] the Believers at Rome were surrounded by
[1:48:52] a city of pagans
[1:48:56] that sounds like today
[1:48:58] with all this woke culture and
[1:49:00] everything else
[1:49:02] we are surrounded by pagans from every
[1:49:06] side
[1:49:08] and what they had to deal with in Rome
[1:49:12] wait a minute I'm not just talking about
[1:49:15] pagans out there
[1:49:19] because we get to throw oh that's easy
[1:49:24] what about the ones that constantly
[1:49:32] it is
[1:49:42] what they had to deal with on a daily
[1:49:44] basis
[1:49:46] and still up all the gospels
[1:49:50] was only possible listen close
[1:49:53] because of the faith in Jesus Christ

[1:50:03] world every day
[1:50:05] hello everybody hola you gotta go deal
[1:50:09] with them on a constant basis
[1:50:12] but they had a faith
[1:50:16] and this faith that Paul is talking
[1:50:18] about
[1:50:20] the faith that the whole world was had
[1:50:24] spoken of is
[1:50:26] you know what that means
[1:50:29] they had a dynamic faith

[1:50:41] God
[1:50:44] that's good yeah same beliefs too

[1:51:00] Dynamic active and vital Dynamic
[1:51:03] activity what made it such a faith

[1:51:19] now we're getting into true worship
[1:51:23] this kind of church was not hindered by
[1:51:27] a culture
[1:51:31] that was dominated by pagans
