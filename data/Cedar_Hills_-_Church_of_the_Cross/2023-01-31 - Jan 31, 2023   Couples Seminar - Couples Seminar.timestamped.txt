[12:40] okay
[12:45] there was that place
[12:51] or he created a place
[13:25] it is oh
[13:50] hopelessness come to the mind of God
[13:53] and let's bring this picture
[13:57] yeah
[14:00] that there was a Unity
[14:08] [Music]
[14:10] when God places
[14:16] there was a union or a Unity
[14:20] because
[14:24] they have part of this nature
[14:33] I don't believe
[14:52] sometimes
[14:55] being so too precious
[14:57] foreign
[15:16] and I think over time
[15:37] you're so beautiful

[20:27] you okay
[20:29] what do you say my children
[20:33] what a beautiful moment
[20:40] this is a Unity
[20:43] this is perfection
[20:48] it's one plus one plus one
[20:51] and it equals
[20:56] this is
[21:00] what God wanted in the beginning
[21:03] now open your eyes
[21:18] do you see why it's so important the
[21:21] family to God
[21:27] knowing the plan of God
[21:30] he also has an objective
[21:33] and it is
[21:39] Genesis chapter 12 tells us
[22:03] every pain every wrong thing
[22:10] now just imagine okay
[22:13] foreign
[22:14] [Music]
[23:10] Abraham
[23:26] and he said I promise
[23:41] because God once again wants to have
[23:44] communion with the family
[23:59] but it's for the generations
[24:09] see how important the family is
[24:18] that God can perpetually forgive His
[24:22] blessings
[24:29] and the children of the children
[24:34] do you see why the family it's a link
[24:37] it's the link
[24:49] if that link is weak
[24:52] Ness
[25:03] the plan that God has with that family
[25:10] is there any questions to this point
[25:18] no question
[25:23] when
[25:25] God calls Abram
[25:27] s
[25:28] [Music]
[25:30] but it wasn't just for him but it was
[25:32] for his children
[25:34] now in this time
[25:43] we are the seat of Abraham
[25:48] when I read in Genesis
[25:57] I was not just talking about Abraham
[26:14] a great nation
[26:19] maybe not everybody has had the
[26:21] privilege
[26:24] to be raised in a Christian home
[26:27] but we have had the honors
[26:30] [Music]
[26:33] to know the love of God through Christ
[26:38] and that places
[26:41] [Music]
[26:52] names
[27:12] and holiness
[27:14] foreign
[27:26] how important we are
[27:30] in the chain of God
[27:34] when we say eyes
[27:42] these are baby things
[27:49] God gives it to every one of you
[27:52] what's your name Andrew
[28:02] what was the promise that God Made You
[28:06] we just read it
[28:09] yeah
[28:12] a great nation
[28:19] what is the promise that God has for
[28:23] your for your life what would your
[28:26] answer be
[28:27] foreign
[28:38] [Music]
[29:08] [Music]
[29:16] [Music]
[29:21] foreign
[30:18] [Music]
[30:43] [Music]
[30:45] that gives us promises
[30:51] that he will also be the god of our
[30:53] children
[30:54] somebody has to have a question
[30:57] somebody has something they want to say
[31:01] Hallelujah
[31:04] foreign
[31:43] but uh to a separation
[31:47] and Abraham he has to pair price
[31:54] [Music]
[32:30] do you see the importance yes
[32:39] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is
[32:42] always spoken
[32:48] we have a very important job
[32:53] this morning
[32:56] the Lord showed me something
[32:59] e
[33:01] e
[33:02] here
[33:04] I was coming into the scholarship home
[33:15] and I saw three prayers where they put
[33:18] the children the babies yeah
[33:21] and there were three children just
[33:24] little children and they also I'll use
[33:27] his enemies and between 8 and 16 months
[33:37] it's a vision
[33:40] Hollywood and God wants you to teach
[33:43] something
[33:46] I saw these children
[33:52] and the first child
[33:56] and I saw that this this child was
[34:00] influenced by demons
[34:22] [Music]
[34:24] being influenced by these spirits
[35:02] to change
[35:17] my generation
[35:26] I want you to put yourself in my shoes
[35:30] and ask yourself the same questions
[35:34] could those be your grandchildren
[35:39] do you know those those grandchildren
[35:41] were already lost
[35:49] for the families
[36:00] [Music]
[36:04] I will be the god of your generation
[36:10] that promise was lost
[36:14] I don't want that to happen in my life
[36:26] maybe I don't read the Bible enough to
[36:29] my children
[36:31] names
[36:42] [Music]
[36:43] and that is gonna negatively uh have a
[36:47] negative effect to my children
[36:52] we
[36:54] it's almost
[36:55] we are the example
[36:59] so our children is
[37:23] my wife
[37:26] knows that I'm not living that right
[38:28] that God has elected me and has chosen
[38:32] to make me a great nation
[38:36] and I have a promise to my children
[38:40] and I want my children
[38:42] for them to run
[38:50] that they thought that I knew he always
[38:54] be the same God
[38:58] they also know him by revelations
[39:22] to that point
[39:27] have you understood yes
[39:33] so is this the reason
[39:37] that he will always refer to himself
[39:43] I am the god
[39:45] of Abraham
[39:50] right absolutely make sure that we know
[39:54] this is Generations
[40:06] okay
[40:08] I'm in
[40:12] um
[40:14] a God that loves his family
[40:23] he asked Abraham just to obey him
[40:27] be perfect
[40:30] you know what Perfection is
[40:34] [Music]
[40:41] supposed to say he's the one that fills
[40:43] the requirements for you
[40:46] all he's asking of us is to be obedient
[40:49] it's that's it
[40:53] the same fellowship or communion
[40:56] [Music]
[41:02] today you and I can have the same time
[41:08] through Jesus Christ
[41:25] did you capture it
[41:29] we're in the same position
[41:35] [Music]
[41:38] that communion with God for kids because
[42:12] and God cannot be there
[42:22] the husband and the wife must be
[42:25] immunity
[42:28] the children with the parents
[42:31] the parents with the children
[42:34] that gives us a Unity
[42:38] so that the Holy Spirit can come down
[42:54] then that's why he says the families
[42:57] that pray together
[42:59] they stay together
[43:04] you have a question
[43:15] you know I was reading a story today
[43:17] and the story was about a family
[43:24] and one day they had an uncle that came
[43:27] and visited
[43:30] and he was a Christian
[43:46] and so they pray for the moon
[43:54] the the uncle left
[43:58] and so the next time they got together
[44:01] to eat
[44:03] he said that the dad jumped in it was
[44:07] about to and by this is
[44:15] that is God not God today
[44:32] my children
[44:35] depending the knee
[44:38] they make
[44:41] pandemic
[44:43] the decision that I will make
[44:46] my grandchildren okay that I don't even
[44:50] know
[44:51] they are depending on the decisions
[44:57] [Music]
[45:05] [Music]
[45:08] but they will also are they are
[45:10] depending on the decisions I'm making
[45:12] today
[45:18] once again I I promise myself today
[45:24] me and my house
[45:27] we will serve the Lord
[45:33] if there's something that today
[45:38] you feel something in your heart okay
[45:42] for what we have heard
[45:45] that was this Vision that we have that
[45:48] we have that we have shown us
[45:53] I want to change that scene
[46:01] full of the Holy Ghost
[46:04] not not full of spirits
[46:10] having a Passion to serve the Lord
[46:17] show them the correct way
[46:21] to bring Christ on the scene
[46:24] me and my house
[46:27] we will serve the Lord
[46:34] that wants to
[46:38] change the scene
[46:45] amen amen
[46:50] it's gonna be the same as Abraham
[46:54] we're gonna have to pay the price or yes
[47:04] those that come from a Christian home
[47:08] your father's Peter price
[47:12] some of us that maybe that didn't come
[47:15] from
[47:16] we have paid a price so that we could be
[47:19] here
[47:40] gave him
[47:42] [Music]
[47:45] I will bless your seed or your
[47:47] Generations
[47:49] so that one day those words
[47:56] oh
[48:06] that's right
[48:08] one day my son would say father
[48:17] I am going to serve the god that you
[48:20] serve
[48:21] [Music]
[48:22] that would be the greatest
[48:42] I had a dream last night
[48:45] God called me
[48:49] that your daughter Lily got mama would
[48:52] say
[48:54] did you call me
[48:56] no no
[49:03] he's faithful
[49:06] he is faithful
[49:11] Satan will not have mercy foreign
[49:26] [Music]
[49:41] [Music]
[49:48] [Music]
[50:15] they want to ask
[50:24] um
[50:27] how many children do you have two
[50:31] come on
[50:32] how do you see them in the future
[50:39] I see them preaching and serving the
[50:42] lord
[50:45] they have to grow up here
[51:03] that will never leave them
[51:10] one day
[51:21] and I'll make of you
[51:27] Brother David
[51:30] how many children do you have
[51:33] problems how do you see them in the
[51:36] future
[51:38] man
[51:40] I remember
[51:44] with all these promises oh my
[51:51] God
[51:56] that is a promise
[51:58] yeah
[52:09] how will they get there
[52:13] you gotta show them by your example
[52:17] how they're gonna get there
[52:21] and I know
[52:23] how many children are you going to have
[52:26] brothers
[52:47] soon as artists writing and creating
[52:50] things for the Lord
[52:52] using their gifts
[52:59] I think that we're accomplishing the
[53:02] objective today
[53:04] the biggest lie
[53:18] that is the biggest thing
[53:27] because I want them to have the best
[53:37] we give it to our children and
[53:39] everything
[53:43] in six years they destroyed everything
[53:46] okay
[53:51] I'll see the the real thing that's
[53:54] important
[54:03] [Music]
[54:17] with God
[54:20] you have to have an experience with him
[54:23] just like Abraham
[54:26] and the way that Jacob had inside and
[54:30] Isaacs
[54:34] because it's a promise
[54:37] you and your generation
[54:49] is there anything that you would want to
[54:51] say you would like to add anyone
[54:57] yeah
[54:59] what tremendous lesson that we have
[55:01] heard now
[55:08] I as I as I'm hearing the Holy Spirit
[55:11] speak to us
[55:13] there's so many things that you get
[55:15] flooded with when you're hearing these
[55:17] things
[55:20] and it's so true I remember speaking one
[55:25] day to a man
[55:27] he said this he says you know we need to
[55:33] learn
[55:34] that if our fathers they have a quarrel
[55:38] between them
[55:46] he says that doesn't mean that that
[55:49] their children have to be fighting too
[55:54] they should never transfer
[55:58] this is one of the biggest mistakes we
[56:01] make with our children
[56:06] we have a problem or an issue
[56:09] [Music]
[56:31] your children my children should not
[56:34] have to carry that in life
[56:44] thank you
[56:46] foreign
[58:19] that Spirit of drinking always follows
[59:11] still in the place foreign
[59:19] [Music]
[59:49] [Music]
[1:00:00] very important that you understand
[1:00:03] because you want them to have an
[1:00:06] opportunity
[1:00:08] now back in the old days
[1:00:12] in the biblical days
[1:00:15] when the father was or the the parents
[1:00:18] were a certain way
[1:00:23] the Bible says that they would that he
[1:00:25] would visit the the iniquity of the
[1:00:29] parents
[1:00:31] three and four generations
[1:00:34] and so we look at that and we're like
[1:00:36] wow
[1:00:37] through the years
[1:00:49] and this is the thing that we're
[1:00:52] grateful to God
[1:00:54] is that those curses can be broken
[1:01:19] [Music]
[1:01:35] one of the things
[1:01:39] that God would even give our children
[1:01:48] that he would give our children
[1:01:51] they don't have to be something because
[1:01:54] their parents or grandparents
[1:01:59] now they can choose for themselves
[1:02:17] remember don't make them carry stuff
[1:02:21] that you carry
[1:02:23] me
[1:02:26] here's another mistake that parents make
[1:02:29] this I'm talking about a homeless
[1:02:33] they'll tell their children everything
[1:02:35] that they did wrong growing up
[1:02:37] videos
[1:03:04] don't make your children carry those
[1:03:07] things
[1:03:16] it does nothing to help them okay
[1:03:22] [Music]
[1:03:31] you're fine
[1:03:54] he was
[1:03:57] he was a young a young dad
[1:04:01] and his first
[1:04:03] of course they had 14 13 children
[1:04:06] and the first part in the first half of
[1:04:09] the of these children
[1:04:11] they knew my grandfather that answered
[1:04:15] the Lord
[1:04:17] but the second half of these children
[1:04:21] my grandfather as a Godly Man
[1:04:24] [Music]
[1:04:25] and I remember even hearing this
[1:04:28] [Music]
[1:04:30] my older uncles
[1:04:42] and my dad
[1:04:44] I don't care
[1:04:59] who cares
[1:05:11] once again don't let them don't make
[1:05:14] them carry stuff that they don't have to
[1:05:15] do
[1:05:23] okay
[1:05:32] yes
[1:05:36] instead of prayers
[1:05:47] [Music]
[1:05:49] as for me and my house we will serve the
[1:05:52] Lord
[1:05:59] let's ask God to help us
[1:06:03] to to fulfill this this content that
[1:06:07] we've made it
[1:06:09] to be parents that are of a good example
[1:06:14] that if there is another generation
[1:06:22] that it would be another generation that
[1:06:25] would continue with this man
[1:06:35] I'm gonna ask God to forgive my failures
[1:06:47] foreign
[1:06:50] thank you for these words
[1:06:54] that there would be fire in every one of
[1:06:57] these words
[1:06:59] so that our hearts can burn
[1:07:03] the the desire to be obedient
[1:07:08] and the examples to our children
[1:07:44] in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:07:49] [Applause]
[1:08:13] and when I say intimacy
[1:08:17] [Music]
[1:08:27] between couples
[1:08:53] I love you my friend
[1:08:57] any questions
[1:09:17] foreign
