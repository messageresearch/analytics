to the great Eternal Place amen are you happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight we're just so thankful that God gives us the opportunity and foreign really yeah okay amen I believe he does and we're just here to help God's children as you can see here it's a funny title isn't it rapturing question mark well are you doubting brother Jimmy we're gonna make the Rapture uh no nothing like that oh when the Rapture comes the Lord's Gonna Take Me by force this is but before that happens you have to take it by Foreign amen for by grace are ye saved through faith for Gracia soy salvos de la Fe and that not of yourselves it is a gift of God because that is thank you this fine evening Lord come before your children Lord and we have placed ourselves in your hands lordos you're in the audience and here in the Pulpit Lord we pray that you would close our mouths to anything that would not help your children Lord and that it would be your spirit quickening your word to each Heart Lord we ask all this in your precious Name Lord Jesus the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you're sitting and just go to our next scripture in Romans the seventh chapter and how many people uh I've read roman The Book of Romans you know all spend a lot of time in prison and [Music] some of the Epistles he wrote while he was in prisoners there's even times Mrs wrote with real big letters because he was just kind of maybe a candlelight uh I basis and he had problems with his eyes so here he is a physical prisoner physical in a physical prison um but how did he knows that God had chosen him to someday become the prisoner of Christ it shows you that you could be in a prison you could be in jail for whatever crime or you could be in jail and you're not even guilty of the crime but just because you're a prisoner inside of a jail something doesn't mean that you're gonna live right when you get out of jail no significance but when you become a prisoner to Christ you know what causes you to be a prisoner to Christ the chain for we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal sold under sin is for that which I do I allow not or what I would that do I not but what I hate that I do foreign ah come on you've never how many have ever felt like you wanted to do something good that's according to the word and it just escapes you on how to do it is implemented that's all he's saying is so he could be in the physical prison here but he's had an experience with God experience and now he's in the process of becoming a prisoner to Christo even though he's in jail that's what Romans 7 is all about continuity but then I do that which I would not I consent unto the law that it is good is Buena and the next verse now then it is not no more me that do it but the sin that dwelleth in me and I want you to notice he says this sin this which is what is he said it dwelt in him well the question would be what part of him was still a sinner he had a new birth yeah oh yeah he was born again but in his makeup like you and me he has the white dog and the black dog he has this hybrid flesh he had a spirit that is permitted by God yes that's not perfect you know it's perfect that needs to be transformed and he's saying there's sin that still dwells in me he was trying to to me to figure out his own makeup he did he knew God had called him do you know that God has called you how many numbers how many of you have been born again young people born again but how many of you feel this way exactly the way exactly in a prison becoming a prisoner remember one time I preached in Camp Thunderbird many many years ago the Paradox of the prisoner and the soldier you know how the soldier will take the prisoners to prisoners but you know when God pero and yours there has to be something that takes his prisoner it's it's it's the prisoner now taking the soldier to the Battlefront I mean it's no longer the soldier taking the prisoner to jail now it's the prisoner taking the soldier and making him a love slave to Jesus Christ I'm a soldier and the prisoners for I know that in me you're saying me now he's beginning to understand there now you can begin to understand as you walk with God now I know that in me that is in my flesho is in Uganda I really enjoyed that that was good stuff yes because it's it's an expression that is survived from a previous time all the way to the present time it's something that lest there's a change it will always be the same way that is in my flesh continues to dwell no good thing no good thing we'll ever dwell notice the word dwell [Music] um sometimes you wish the devil would do that right get away okay I'm going to attack him some other way there's never no good thing that will ever dwell in this hybrid bless Jimmy already said that do we really have a reality of that Yeah because sometimes we think we're hanging better believe it that's me yeah so yeah yeah oh you never think that you never think that you're something else until you become a prisoner of Christ it's a little silly but where we're going yeah is something that's so special that God wants to show you tonight for to will is present how many have the will right now then you wanna serve them you want to fulfill your purpose in this life you want to do exactly what God called you to do and you have a will to do it for to will is is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not for como hacer how many have ever felt that way raise your hands Manos young people a witness are you paralyzed okay it's not a formal dead church I'm sorry I'm not trying to suppose okay praise the Lord I'm forgiven let's go on Amen and now I would like to go to a quote out of adoption part two parties amen you can put that up there for me for me R2 paragraph 51 and 52. so that you can see how special you are on a god you're not just anybody persona you are a son and daughter now brother William starts off what do you think the writer of this book that's in it be manifested in the last days waiting and groaning for those sons of God to rise on the scene in the last days do you think the rising of those sons of God is so strong it would pull up more sons of God the rising impact of the sons of God now when it says those sons of God is not referring to all the sons of God it's referred me to a special classes special in a special time for a special purpose wow yeah amen praise God but those sons of God to rise on the scene in the last days with the power of the Holy Ghost oh now we know what sons of God is talking about and I don't believe it's talking about the end of laodice I think it's talking about the end of the Friday because when the brightens question mark he starts using that expression in 1953. and you'll see it all the way through the message then he uses the expression starting in 1955 Grace gracias wow there's even rapturing Grace and then one time Universe in 1962 this is the expression rapturing strings what oh is it going to be rap stream Faith by itself that takes us out of here and everybody thinks Rapture Rapture yeah by grace for Gracia amen rapturing strength that's the one that really gets my attention because he only uses it one time in the homework it's on my famous list of things that brother Branham only said one time it was just way over a hundred times tremendous things one time is that the holy spirit is waiting for two or three Witnesses now in your experience hence to experiencia have you experience Rapture in faith yes rapturing Grace gracias if you ever come to service and felt like you know I'm going to service might as well go one last time I'm a donkey and I cannot change I'm a donkey and I just can't change our human complexes but then you come to church and the revolution of faith comes and raptures you right out of your business the grace of God that you don't deserve no matter that I don't deserve it it's rapturing Grace but now notice here but when will it be a Permanente rapturing strings to never fall back again rapturing what rapturing faith abstain Grace strength uh the contest 1962. I didn't give this one to you guys and I've already used up 18 minutes of my time [Music] as the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raises up a standard against him and if we have come to the end of these things and the mysteries of God has been completed with us well you're part of the mystery do you know what it is the mystery and Mysterio of us in Christ The Mystery of his will well I don't want to go there my time will be gone and then I won't stay not even happy what I have done here the mysteries of God has been completed with us we are looking for more Springs how many are looking for more students well what kind of strings do you want what kind of strength do you need in order to rise up as one of those sons of God with the power of the Holy ghosts amen are you one of those Sons and Daughters okay oh now we're getting a few more hands to me Arrow stairs but you do pitched in me you inspired me what's this oh my goodness to meet a worse Force foreign a wrapped okay what is in me that needs to be raptured what does me needs to come to the Forefront okay your spirit your spiritual your body no way Jose no you're so Su Alma that the voice of our souls so many times we can barely hear it because it's buried under so much stuff it even lost its original positions his soul is in the background now then there's his Spirit of natural human sinful spirit and then a sinful body and the human race that's such a hard time listening and hearing the voice of the souls God wants to bring your soul in a Rapture who is the original position I suppose it's your the way it was before the fall you know let's get into that let's go to the message the greatest battle ever fought okay can we go to the next part Brothers can you skip it or do it here paragraph 104. what was the matter problema you had to open the Channel first and if you read how many have read this message he's talking about the five senses of the body the five the five in inlets to the spirit and and then the Soul and the nature of the song but he says you've got to get this channel open first neces not channels no Canales there's a channel that connects to those channels and if that one is not correctly prayed Place freedom to access your senses to access your memories your affection your emotions it can do nothing for you what's this you've got to get the soldier soldado not a soldier you've got to get the soldiers the Holy Spirit visiting the Battlefront visitando El frente bataya places instead of finding this weak worldly experience he finds the nature of that Spirit yes I don't live in here anymore send your garbage and your lies to send somebody else he doesn't even have a chance to get in is not foreign [Music] is every one of the other channels just like an old boilera with the flu stops [Applause] and you'll blow the thing up now let's go on that same message to paragraph 71 you guys got there it is so what does that mean to place the soldier at the Battlegrounds because he's not a good visitor as a matter of fact he he won't go there if he can't stay it doesn't have the characteristic of being a visitor characteristics it happens to be the one that wants to to live there how many of you want the Holy Spirit now Paul he was going through this because he had yet become a prisoner to Christ even though he had been a prisoner and as he was inspired by the Holy Spirit foreign I like watching you guys are awesome spectacular like looking at you right in the eyes it sounds worse in Spanish you're you're a nose you're nosy you're a busybody in other people's business don't put that one on me no no no no not that no amen senor yeah this is what I want okay paragraph 71 is this out of the message the greatest battle ever fought either that or I got the paragraph wrong see if I can be a little patient with me I'm losing time you got it okay paragraph 71 the greatest battle ever fought now I had if you was looking on my Note here I had a little map draw it out I had there not long ago and use it on the board the human being is made up just like a grain of wheat Estates question for you is a grain of wheat an original product of God yes so he's talking about the original order or makeup of this and now it's going to compare it to you and me just show us something is really nice but uh okay let's go down here the human being to stay right there the human being is made up just like a grain of wheat instead the physically you're the the seed of your father and mother music and the life comes from the Father the pope come from the mother and so the two together the egg and the blood comes together and in the blood cell is life is begins to develop making the child Now watch how he touches now any seed has a shell on the Outside Inside is the pope yeah inside of the pope is the germ of life well that's the way we're made and spirit yes that is the original makeup oh wait God made man it was not bad it became buddy I already formed it in the original series now you know why he didn't attack Adam he had to to take a part of the of man physically that was a byproducts but the woman was a part of his Spirit a part of Adam's spirit that was a part of God's life that wasn't a byproducted that was the daughter of God but it was the plan of God for him to trap satanas and obese called the surface so he could bring into judgment he wanted his attributes to be okay salvation to be a savior Healers or how could it if there was nobody sick how could there's nobody that was a sinner how could he deliver somebody that was never bound he had to permit this in order for his attributes to come out amen amen now I want to leave that quote there well let's finish this this part the outside the body is the conscience and so forth and the inside of the soul is a spirit and the spirit governs all others amen amen now let's go to the message and know if it's not how many have read the message amen okay this bit on our tablet that's the right one yes okay very well yeah now this outside man is the flesh that's what we look at what we see it has five energy to the body and any grammar school child as myself would know there is five senses that control the body is that's the only way you have to the body is see taste feel smell here is she tastes you now that is the evil one on the outside and El exterior now on the inside is the spiritual also National Body and Soul anymore oh brother doesn't change his mind made a mistake yeah right God Don't Make Mistakes instead of that is the spirit instead of a world in nature because it was not given from God but it was given permitted by God now you got that but every child that's born in the world and come into the world speaking life that person is the center to begin with and can we go to paragraph 127. amen now people can live in this now if I had the White Water I would put these two sets of circles and you know what Spirit places inside that one the original one is Marriott you can dance in the spirit they can shout in the spirit when retirement this can absolutely have the real spirit of God anointing on that Spirits foreign Espirito so that's not the spirit that's on the inside of the wheat is because Alma Spirit yes go to Psalms 51. you guys jump on the I know let me see what order I had it in here we go and how many have read this scripture over and over it's wonderful isn't it he ate in me a clean heart you know what clean heart there is in the Hebrew significance it says he has to put it back together right foreign when he was bringing you foreign they sell it would only need contacts with the original Creator original and then that spirit that was worldly let's go back to the description a clean heart oh God who is hate that spirit that was filthy he can clean that Spirit hello and now the Holy Spirit and my spiritual amen amen praise the Living God are you again or do you just want to stay with body Spirits no you don't know oh this is good it's just it's not what this is what Paul was finding out about himself and when you feel the way Paul feels I know what's right I know he should do this I know I've been taught correctly you say is and I read the scripture I just haven't been able to do this I have a will hello I don't know how to let that wheel by the power foreign [Applause] amen amen okay one more scripture John 5 39. and we've read the scripture so much and we so misunderstand the scripture and you're going to even hear the in Spanish when you visit in Spanish it's you can see why people misunderstand nothing against the Spanish it just doesn't say what it says in English and it doesn't say what it says in the original Greek original search the scriptures once a week when I come to church everyday yes search the scriptures in Spanish it says oh it looks like to you that you have eternal life if I read the Bible yeah well I think yeah I I could think that I had you know right now I might just have eternal life that's totally countries do you want to read the Bible with me this is what I call foreign don't last they are you they are they yes so I must become the scripture no wonder it says search the scriptures you'll find yourself if you're a Believers now all together search the scriptures foreign [Music] you think concise is that's why we messed so many things because we think that we know how to do things but the only place you can really think is and then you think and I can say spend size you have eternal life no well I I don't know if I have eternal life or not no says but if you're thinking in the scriptures you've always had eternal life Son of God didn't know who you were the scriptures foreign all right don't worry thank you let's stand their feet you
