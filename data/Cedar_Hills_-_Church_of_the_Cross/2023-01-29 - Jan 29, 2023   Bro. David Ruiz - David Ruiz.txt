time around the campfire how about you who likes to go camping one more time who likes to go camping first couple rows yes how about those in the back I'm sorry the older folks know it as hunting who like to go hunting there we go so you guys can all sit down for a bit I was out there in the field and that's why I'm dressed real warm because it gets cold out there especially right about now and I wanted to share a story with you that I heard are you guys interested are you sure because I can leave and we can keep on singing songs who said that tell us a story man well this story was told first by our prophet how many knows the name of our prophet what's the name of our Prophet sweetheart that's right brother Branham and what was his first name again William and for our for our older children in the back what did he go by Brother starts with a B call me Bill is what he said all right and a lot of times he shared stories from the Bible so let me ask you how many brought their Bible today okay Dad did you bring your own Bible today or are you still borrowing your sons don't answer that but for those who brought their Bible let's go to a scripture found in first Timothy chapter six verse 12. once the pages stopped turning that's when I'll go because we want to wait for everybody especially for our young ones right bless you let's see you again careful there though I'm running out of blessings First Timothy bless you hey I'm running real low now first Timothy chapter 6 verse 12 reads like this that was a fake one and that was my daughter so I know fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life were into Thou Art also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses so do me a favor look to your left look to your right those are the witnesses that you will profess to all right let's get the campfire going again I know it's getting cold in here too cold a hundred percent cold now how many have heard of the chief told by Brother Branham the story of the chief we got one hand two hand three hands Four Hands okay are you guys just raising your hands because the pastor Rose is in or do you know the story of the chief yeah it involves a chief the Holy Ghost and a couple of dogs have you guys heard that story no couple said no would you like to hear the story yeah all right all right all right all right and can you guys hear in the back is that okay yes okay so there was a meeting very much like tonight and there was a chief who decided to give his heart to the Lord and when he gave his heart to the Lord a prophet brother Branham explains to us saying that he was filled with the Holy Ghost how many want to be filled hold on keep him up aye real high let me see okay let me see everyone in the first row yes second row yes third row I almost got you brother Noah third row yes fourth row brother will okay brother will Chief gots both hands up all right okay what about over here how many want to be filled with the Holy Ghost oh okay hold on okay I see the hands I see the hands all right oh about over here okay so we're in agreement we all want to be filled with the Holy Ghost yes so he was filled with the Holy Ghost and he was on fire baby you like that but after some time brother Branham saw this Chief again and he goes hey chief since you've gotten your new birth since you've received the Holy Ghost how has it been going and do you know what the chief said he goes wow pretty good and pretty bad and brother Branham goes explain to me what do you mean how can you do pretty good and pretty bad doesn't it make sense to only do good or only do bad oh no it's a good answer right there Chief goes pretty good pretty bad brother random goes well can you explain Chief said I find two dogs that are constantly fighting with each other these dogs don't like each other one of them is the good dog he's the white one pure he's clean and the other one that he doesn't like and he fights with is the bad dog that's the black dog and he's mean and nasty and sinful and they fly every day the moment I wake my eyes that's what I see dog barking and fighting and biting and brother Branham asked the chief he goes well chief got a question for you and I would think that he if he brother Brandon was here he'd like to ask you a question which dog wins the good dog the good dog the white one the white one the white one which one the good dog the good dog the white dog okay so all of our young children want the good dog the white dog the pure dog The Godly dog to win how many parents are in agreement with that all right but is he guaranteed to win parents oh you see a dog has to if that dog has to fight it has to have strength right to last in the fight to win a fight like a boxer right so where does he get his strength from oh we got a lot of raised hands from the Lord okay from God the Holy Ghost from Jesus from the Lord Jesus Christ from Jesus Christ from Brother Branham from the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost from God's strength okay what about some of our older boys third row someone give me an out it's food so brother Yandel said his food so the dog the food that the dog eats gives him strength but the dog's food is brother random States reading your Bible as young children listening to your parents oh oh yeah that's right listening to your parents listening to God's word listening to tapes listening to the preaching not yawning during service how about that huh ouch a chief brother Caleb he he caught a few of us yawning last Sunday didn't he it's okay it happens I know I've been one of them and the laugh tells me you've also been one of them but that's the key it's the food that you feed the dog but if you feed the white dog and the black dog the same amount aren't they going to be the same string so then if you want the white dog to win who do you have to feed more together parents together parents were weak huh one more time parents there we go so if you want your white dog that's in you to beat the black dog that's in you you have to feed the white dog mark how am I giving it the word buddy all right and you know this story has become so popular it's been making its Rounds Around the World that I found out they're gonna make a film how many like to watch movies and don't lie to me parents don't lie to me how many like to watch films come on there's some good ones out there let's be honest or or or shows with good meanings come on parents come parents Beyond his parents hold on I can't see all right all right there's some good films out
