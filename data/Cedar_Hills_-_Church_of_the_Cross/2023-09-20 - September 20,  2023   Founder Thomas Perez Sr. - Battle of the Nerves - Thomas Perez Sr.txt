your Bibles to Second Chronicles and we're going to read from chapter 20 the capital and we're going to start reading here chapter 20 and verse 14. how many of you love the Lord this morning raise your hand if you love the Lord how many of you want to believe God in all things it is not as easy as it sounds everybody says I believe God but we can prove that we don't believe him by the way that we act by the way that we let Spirits control our beings but let's let's go this morning and I what I'm trying to do so that God you can understand God so that God can help you this morning I know that there's a lot of nervousness which and then for a contexto stand still and see the salvation of the Lord now let us read from second chronicles 20 14. then upon James style the son of Zechariah the son of denial the son of jail the son I met Naya a Levine of the son of Ezra came the spirit of the Lord in the midst of the congregations and you inhabitants of Jerusalem and Thou King Jehoshaphat does send the Lord unto you be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but God it is I want to repeat that let's praise again and I want you to repeat with me for the Bell is not yours but God let's all say it together for the battle all right verse 16 yes you see tomorrow going down against them behold they come up by the clip of this you shall find them at the end of the brook before the Wilderness of the Royals you shall not need Divine in this battle set yourself stand you still and see the salvation of the Lord with you o Judah and Jerusalem fear not nor it is me tomorrow go against them for the Lord will be with me all right let us open our Bibles to one more scripture that's found in the third chapter of the book of Exodus tres and the 13th verse versiculous and Moses said unto God behold when I came unto the children of Israel and shall say unto them that God of your fathers has sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall I say unto them is and God said unto Moses I am that I am and he said thus shall now say unto the children of Israel I am have sent me unto you here may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word and you may be seated amen you know that I am is here with us this morning but when you are confronted with the situation you do not realize that I am is we live in a very nervous age we all are aware one nervous now that they have ever been done nervousness has hit Humanity I want to read a quote from Brother Branham in the last message that he preached while he was here on this Earth in the message communion he said this because Esto and notice the words we also can look around and see that the way that the human mind is living the people I want to repeat that again we can look around and see that the way that the human mind is living the people ESO the human mind is living the people that we can't stay must we'd be in a complete insane Institution the whole world would be part of the world but the whole world would be in a complete insane institution is [Music] that the prophet of God yes the human mind is that the mind is living the human body that the human mind is leaving the people I should say is not because a man is [Music] nobody else only the Lord you can see that anywhere I was shocked the other day when I read this article articulum of a man what he did to his 10 year old daughter in Elsinore Lake California in California put her in a nice chest generator and dumped her into the lady how can a man do that even to a dog [Laughter] you know that in itself should be as well I found out then what the prophet says Professor when he says that the human mind is leaving the people we can see that all around we can see how people are so nervous today we all see that don't we the police people are so nervous you see people going down the highway and it's a hustle bustling they're trying to hurry to get home they get out of work they can hardly wait to get home to sit down watch television and drink some beers matter they run over somebody the children are nervous you're fine even in the elementary school elementary we find the children smoking marijuana marijuana they do that because they're nervous they don't know what to do with their times probably just inside the church I would find not a woman a lot of men in here they have no fingernails [Laughter] and nervousness now that's a bad condition together find people that in their bodies foreign and they get this rash over their body they say well I got an allergy a lot of it is not an allergy it's nervous that it's a nervous system do you know that the nervous system is connected to your spinal cord it's connected to the vertebrae it's connected to your brain and these fibers when they get irritated well it is done by a control center foreign and conditioned Health happens in every family that sometimes we don't know how to cope stay well we something is going on in my home if this is going on in my home I don't know what to do I don't know what to do the word of God [Music] we eat hard to spend still yes [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] at the end the Lord says Be not Afraid or dismayed by reason of this great multitude Made It by a foreign okay [Laughter] forgive us that is what gave him the courage Moses had to have a solid foundation he had to know what he had believed can you imagine Minecraft I notice and I pray that you understand what I want to say okay won't come in and twist what I want to say but all of you here today fast and break break I certainly believe in prayer my Bible tells me to pray without sins I know him through the words helion when the Lord wanted to bring him in battle celebrities he grabbed 32 000 men the number went down to ten thousand yeah the number the Lord said that's too many and the number went down to 300. what was the difference between those 10 000 and those 300 or 9 700. foreign [Music] [Music] let's go what's the difference foreign glory to God why the words come come quiet oh oh brother Perez oh God I don't know what we're gonna do in our home oh we're all trouble in our homes if the promise has been giveness you don't understand when you try to do good I want to tell you what the Bible says a lot of people say I believe in God but I don't believe in the devil well I don't believe in the devil but I believe there's a devil oh you know he is stronger he is but he is so wise that he makes you happy upstairs to believe it okay are you interested in your nails leave your nails alone even right here they're nervous people yeah attempted to believe okay but God is a prophecya God gives a word Heaven and Earth will pass away but his word is not going to pass away but what happened I had a young man call me yesterday from some other place I was safe where because then you don't know who I'm talking about um I [Music] said you know what's wrong with you foreign try to do good yesterday I come out of these homes and I had to run to another home that's that's bad when I try to do it when God gets ready to do something he commands the people to stand still stand still I want to read something here with if you want to read with me in the Book of Numbers Chapter 13. we'll find here where where the Lord has spoken to Moses and he told him to send man to search the land of Canaan it is okay yeah and the Lord didn't tell him to choose just any man he said it had to be head of the tribe they woke up they had to be rulers and two of the men that went with this were Caleb and Joshua I want you to notice then Moses sent them to spy the land of paintings whether they were strong or weakness [Music] whether the cities they dwell in were good or bad yeah he said but let us go on we live the other ten words did not believe God [Music] that is the same thing that happens in our generation that's what happens in our generation it's easy to go to church is that right we're either going to believe God or the devil that's too hard they could go in and possess the land foreign there was a there was a man by the name of Tom Foy the older man not the attorney and not the young one that got killed in the plane accident he was a good friend of my daddy because my dad is 90 almost 92 years old right now but my dad was a carpenter and Tommy had a lot of land that stretched all the way down the battery down there and he told my daddy one day he says Pedro Pedro you see all that land oh that is fine my dad says how much do you have upstairs he didn't say anything one day all this will be mine because it is you might have it for a little while but it don't belong to you when Israel was going when he was we're going through all these cities that he ties the mri's the jebusites and so on God said it belonged to Israel why we're so nervous things belongs to the children of God oh I'm sure that I did we can't take it over right now I'm not speaking about men like this but because someday it'll all be ours but I'm speaking about another thing is [Laughter] what this problem I just can't overcome you cannot overcome yourself [Music] oh but where is it and understand [Music] sometimes we think that church is a lot of shouting foreign [Music] you know Jesus do you have problems in your home maybe you got a problem with one of your children find out you know I'm here all the time [Laughter] watch it you will also follow if you don't watch what you're doing because insanity is nothing out of the ordinary now to see to see a young man get up and whip his daddy yes Shane Elizabeth well we're not all Christians we are modern Christians fundamentals when accepted when America was American when America in America I would really get the paper the other day yeah okay Jimmy Carter in a nice Christian way he can go to hell yes the next president of the United States with one of the great preachers of the United States a majority leaders and people when when keepers foreign foreign [Applause] foreign foreign [Laughter] foreign [Laughter] [Music] what's up I live in Central and sometimes ah there's this it's very scary to pass between the hours of 10 at midnight through that place called Brown Derby not long ago my wife and I was going to church a hundred people around the road there was two days [Laughter] they don't have enough prison in jail to house the purpose so they had the committee the Commissioners got together so they appointed a judge to be permanent in jail if it's misdemeanor something not too much you know or whatever while they judge him they judge him right there he's got to make my 10 15 bucks and just go out the street again the Old Wire we're seeing this more and more remember in the Bible when you see the horsemen of apocalypse six not 19 because many preachers Revelation 6 is not Jesus Christ but Revelation 19 is Jesus Christ because then from a red to a blank and you mix it together it's a mixture of religions [Applause] [Laughter] officials you're from Mexico Church he says he should get to church at least 30 minutes foreign foreign he loves to do one thing to watch when a prophecy comes well I wonder if it's true or not oh beautiful attitude thank you Lord [Music] can you imagine how long do you wait for it 25 years I can imagine the doctors and everybody telling Abraham sure you didn't make a mistake babies did you know the white Christians are today in this sense that the devil has the upper hands when I got baptized everything's gonna be all right [Laughter] message this afternoon balance [Music] it's one chicken get on the red horse watch homes for peace has been taken away [Music] what's up foreign you cannot add one more hair to
