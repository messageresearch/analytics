[22:42] [Music]
[22:45] service if we open our Bibles to John 11
[22:49] and verse
[22:52] 40 right many of us know this scripture
[22:54] by memory
[23:01] those seeing us via internet may God
[23:02] bless you thank you for
[23:08] connecting the scripture says and if you
[23:10] could please
[23:12] stand scripture says
[23:35] verse 39 Jesus said take you away the
[23:37] stone Martha the sister of him that was
[23:39] dead said unto him Lord by this time he
[23:42] stinketh for Heath been dead four
[23:50] days and Jesus said unto her said I not
[23:53] unto thee that if thou would wouldest
[23:55] believe thou shouldest see the glory of
[23:57] God
[24:09] then they took away the Stone from the
[24:10] place where the dead was laid and Jesus
[24:12] lifted up his eyes and said father I
[24:15] thank thee that thou Hast heard
[24:17] me let's pray
[24:20] Lord we thank you for your
[24:23] word Lord Inspire us today
[24:29] then Lord prepare us as Prayer
[24:31] Warriors for the honor and Glory of your
[24:34] name that is our prayer
[24:36] Lord if you may please take your
[24:40] seat give me your undivided attention
[24:42] for minutes let me catch your
[24:46] attention we've heard of great preachers
[24:49] of famous
[24:51] men they have been used by the Holy
[24:53] Spirit
[24:55] tremendously but still
[24:58] I have not seen yet the
[25:03] first that has done the same as what
[25:05] happened
[25:07] here a dead man four four
[25:11] days he he was rotting
[25:18] corrupt this is something
[25:24] impossible let me put it better of the
[25:26] impossible this is the most impossible
[25:31] that humanly could could
[25:36] occur but hear the
[25:40] word brother
[25:43] Paul have I not told you if you
[25:46] believe you would see the glory of
[25:50] God and I ask this this
[25:53] even what is your
[25:56] impossible what is your difficulty
[26:01] what is that which cannot be
[26:04] resolved is there something more
[26:07] difficult than to raise a dead man
[26:09] that's been dead for four
[26:11] days Jesus said for
[26:15] God there is
[26:17] nothing I want you to repeat that
[26:21] word and and pronounce his
[26:24] name say you put your name there brother
[26:28] Noah for
[26:31] God
[26:32] nothing is
[26:37] impossible and and and that puts us a
[26:40] little bit
[26:43] better and let me give you something
[26:44] even
[26:46] better I I tell my
[26:50] children if I want to be
[26:52] someone and I say it
[26:56] truthfully I want to be just
[26:59] anyone I want to be just
[27:04] anyone don't lift me up or do any of
[27:06] those things I say it from my
[27:09] heart because I want to be just
[27:12] anybody because Jesus
[27:14] said
[27:17] anyone that tells this
[27:19] mountain
[27:23] anyone not the great
[27:25] one not not the Lord
[27:29] or the Theologian no no no no no anyone
[27:35] anyone anyone look son
[27:40] anyone that tells this mountain be
[27:44] removed and and does not doubt it shall
[27:48] be
[27:52] done that's for
[27:55] me I'm anyone
[27:58] who is
[27:59] anyone
[28:02] amen you have to believe
[28:04] it because God ask of
[28:08] that to please him it is
[28:13] necessary that he that draws near to
[28:16] him believe that he
[28:18] is and he is a
[28:20] rewarder of those that seek
[28:23] him there's Angels ready prepared
[28:28] to to
[28:29] execute in
[28:32] favor of the
[28:34] redeemed what is your
[28:37] problem do not fear your
[28:39] problem these words of
[28:42] Jesus they are the most
[28:45] special when he says
[28:47] father I thank you because you hear
[28:52] me he said it
[28:55] publicly he wanted the people to be
[28:57] assured
[29:00] that their prayers were
[29:04] heard there's people oh the prayers once
[29:07] again oh you know how it
[29:09] goes don't let that attitude
[29:14] enter if I see that God hears someone's
[29:18] prayer I want to get close to that
[29:20] someone because I want to
[29:23] learn if God hears
[29:26] him I want to learn
[29:30] so that he can also hear
[29:34] me let us
[29:38] pray let let us run uh towards hell and
[29:42] all those
[29:43] spirits that Satan sends to torment
[29:49] us that's the best that God can give
[29:53] us I said that the right
[29:56] way it's the best that God can can give
[30:00] us because that is
[30:03] where God will bring out the best there
[30:06] that is
[30:08] where you can prove to the
[30:10] devil that you are a son of God that is
[30:15] where you can tell God that you trust in
[30:19] him that's
[30:21] where the scripture
[30:25] says the best we can do as Christians
[30:29] is to wait on
[30:30] God because the Bible
[30:33] says that God is
[30:35] good with those that
[30:38] wait don't be
[30:40] impatient but wait for he is good with
[30:44] those that we let us pray brother let us
[30:47] pray let us
[30:49] believe if you feel in your
[30:51] heart come to the altar do it praise God
[30:57] lift up your
[30:58] hand and say Lord thank
[31:02] you God sent a perfect
[31:05] sacrifice to make you a son and daughter
[31:07] of God and the best thing he sent a
[31:10] prophet with a
[31:12] message to tell
[31:15] us that we are his
[31:17] beloved we are his chosen one and that
[31:23] heaven is supporting us backing us
[31:26] up so let us
