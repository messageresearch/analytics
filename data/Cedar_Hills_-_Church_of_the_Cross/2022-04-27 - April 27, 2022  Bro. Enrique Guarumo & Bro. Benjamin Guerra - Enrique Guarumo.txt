[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] may the lord jesus let us open our bibles we're going to be turning to hebrews chapter 11. this evening we're going to be speaking on a little bit on the face hebrews 11 1 now faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen let us pray father beloved lord and heavenly father we come before your presence have you made us worthy of every promise of yours and at this hour i ask that what you have inspired me to speak i believe that you still have the power to close many different ways but we understand that faith is a revelation as a revelation and the first issue that we find here in the bible that by revelation abel offered a more excellent sacrifice and there is where the first problem arised is it is a faith it is a substance and i want to i want to stay there for a little bit on the substance is because many times como cristianos as christians or i want to make a clarification here al christianism we have to understand that it's not just another religion it is a a way of of living a way of life different from the world when we come to christianity and we have to understand that it is to be like christ and and to begin in christianity we have been showed that the first thing that you receive when you are born again faith because you cannot have faith before you are born again and i'm not talking about the faith that the world has i am talking about the faith of christianity because there are there is faith of many religions but the only faith that that god accepts is that of christ because he is the the author and finisher of our faith and as we go forth you're going to find out that in the statute the first thing that we are going to encounter is faith so that attribute was the first attribute to the first church age but and the people began to fall from that faith and that was the correction that god gave to that church because they lost that first love you know that faith and love they go together the prophet said that they contain found a very uh pleasing story and it is and it is on on peter pedro and we know peter that he was very tremendous and one day he told the lord lord i will be with you unto death and he didn't carry that sword just because they gave it to him because he he had it because if he had to use it he was going to use it to and we know that the prophet says that he didn't want to just use a sword and cut the ear off he wanted to cut off his head he said jesus but the prophet says that jesus he corrected the error of peter how many times is jesus correcting our heirs because if there is something to christianity there should exist conviction and i would like to ask everyone a question why are you a christian porque es cristiano why why are you a christian el mundo the prophet says that they are scared we have a saying that says if those who have fear no puede pelia cannot fight they were in the middle of the sea and when they were there jesus they had left jesus and that's why the prophet says that when you leave jesus that's when the problems arise fundamental so then in christianity the faith is so fundamental is because that is where the basis of christianity is so there is where they began to show us teach us why a woman should dress correctly and i asked the question because i know it's not just here locally but they're in your homes brother or sister oh do you know why you must wear a dress i go dancing see you something so simple it's not as simple as just saying oh well because the church says they come to the end they are going to say what bad is it when they come to age they're going to say well how bad is it that's why the bible says for teaching for correction the people don't even know why they are christians you you show your children that it is a dishonor yolo pencil i will think about it and meditate on it but that's why faith should have a foundation question because without faith it is impossible it's impossible it is impossible for but without revelation it is impossible brother or sister to please god and where does all this begin at your house than to sit down and read a verse of the bible and we know that it's true i see it for myself because many times we're in such a hurry that we don't even have time to pray when god the prophet says that god is never in in a hurry oh he has to we got to run over here you got to turn off the light gotta run here and there our faith is there is one thing that paralyzes faith brother you you may say oh brother i i just don't feel like i'm able oh brother it's such a burden to go to church sometimes we come and we don't even have a reason why we come this the prophet says don't permit a root of bitterness rise up against their brother because that paralyzes faith as much as as the preacher gets up and preaches as he preaches as hard as he can but if you have a root of bitterness again it'll come in one year and out the other iwa and you're going to continue the same forest that's why faith cometh foreign hearing music is good christian music but that's not how revelation comes revelation comes through his word what am i going to do today and that begins at my home there is something that broke my heart and i have to be honest with you i have to be honest as as i was doing this and as i was thinking on these things and for me up to a certain point it's okay and brothers i i didn't even know especially i saw a little a little white line there oh brothers and they hurt me so much because when it comes down to you is taking the story of your face it is more precious and i remember that the prophet when one day a young lady came to him and the this young lady asked for brother branham so why don't they let me sing in the choir and have you ever have you ever asked why oh because maybe i use a little bit of makeup on what oh well i'm an american no you are a christian you have to identify yourself with him [Applause] and prove really if you are a christian or not principio and if you are not come to the beginning to the principles ask yourselves oh lord ask yourself how lord how can i come back to this that's why zechariah is remembered and he said lord what do i do have you ever asked yourselves what it is the prophet said to deny the faith am i ready to go with the lord the prophet of god says it's not you waiting for god it's god waiting for you to we have to search our faith we're going to find out that peter when he was in these tremendous streets the prophet said that peter was about at the point of death and he said lord is that you permeate and peter walked on the water he got me no did he walk on the water when the circumstances arised it was the waves because you say i have peter began to disappear to perish and says and then and when the circumstances arise we began to think like the rest of them but it's not like that bro that's not the way it is brothers hermanos you are not the same as the rest he knew that the only way that he could curse the people of israel is for them to to mix you wanted to to make them mix allah he was a prophet on a salary and then he he looked further away you look for a wave to make them fall and what happened he did it he found a way yeah and then he says okay lord now i can curse them when you don't don't bring nothing of denomination you know why no it doesn't work because this is a new kingdom it is a new people this is to be born again lord many times it is difficult but heavenly father you called us help destroy all that is bad in our life that we may be good christians in your head in the name of the lord jesus christ [Music] was hey man don't you love him tonight [Applause] and also give one to the lord for senor for such a beautiful message [Applause] certain things but but it's god's word amen and that's at the at the end of the day we have to realize that's god's word and and when it comes [Music] amen and many many times we don't understand really what the new birth process is the process many times we fall flat on our face but we gotta get up amen and it reads like this i hear the pages amen we thank our pastor for the opportunity that he's given us this night to speak to the bride of christ amen also i say unto you whosoever shall confess me before men him shall the son of man also confess before the angels of god but he that denieth me before man shall be denied before the angels of god amen you may be seated and may god add his blessings to the reading of his word amen amen and and i know it's not by some coincidence i know god's always in control in control was talking in the back i just you know started thanking the lord for for his guidance amen amen and if i were to put a title would be converted you know many times we you know i didn't understand what the what it meant when we hear are you converted you know i always saw it as a process of the new birth process but we we see and we hear you know many things that peter had to go go through and you know it seems which you know he the lord tested him he put him through many challenges but at the end he's the one that god gave the keys to the kingdom you know they called him the chief of the apostles amen but you know when you start looking at converted you know we got to start from the beginning you know many people don't understand then you come to church you we have a lot of new members that have started coming and the first thing they want to do they want to change themselves but that's not god's plan you know like our brother guadumo we accept that sacrifice that he made for us you know we accept the blood that was shed for us that's the first part of it because we're telling the lord lord i put myself into your hands lord you changed me senor kambia you know but many times the first thing we want to do i want to dress like the sister oh you make it i want to dress like the brother i want to act like the brother i want to be like this one and we began to be reformed instead of being transformed by him you know and many times even in the journey muchas vez is owning a hornet we forget about that we forget about the promise that we made with him we said lord i told you i made a vow with you that i was going to put myself into your hands when i came to you lord i was broken and we forget all about what we promised the lord but because we took the wrong steps the wrong steps to let god begin to change many times is a message like we just heard but we promised god when your word comes forth senor con i'm gonna open up my heart how many could do that tonight because that's what the disciples had to do okay you know many times we gotta confess with our mouth because when those words begin to come out that confession comes from somewhere it's a confession that comes from your heart and then it got to get put to action because you look at peter pedro peter was a tremendous apostle of god he loved the lord like brother said he would have killed someone for it because what was that greatest confession that he made and he says who do man say that i the some son of man amigos that but he says who do you say let's read that tonight matthew 16 13. matteo is and when it came and when jesus came into the coast of caesarea philippi he asked the disciples saying whom do man say that i the and they said some say thou art john the baptist some say elias some say others jeremiah or one of the prophets he said unto them but who do you say i am saying and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god you know and that was the confession church yes yeah but in verse 17 it reads like this and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also on to the dower peter pedro and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against him so you you see he had to first confess it but after he confessed it it was so great that jesus says and thou art peter jesus something great because because you keep on reading what is this and the gates of hell peter we want to take the easy way out but when we get into trouble that's when we we expect god we don't ask god we don't ask because the into the john's and the matthews and we see many promises but we don't really but those words seem a lot simpler than what they are we got to start believe first because now we got to go organize [Music] unless the father showed me amenos so now we have to go through those same steps the plan was put there in plan he says i must go but i'm going to send you a company so when that cover comes he's got to dwell inside of you then you get put in the same place as jesus it is you see there basil it's so easy we presume a lot of times we venture without authority we want the same works that jesus did but we don't want to put ourselves in the same place that he was that i could do nothing unless the father showed me so you see here that peter with this confession [Music] many times like i said we don't want to confess and when the inspiration of the holy spirit is here to inspire you foreign god will make your body come into your confession okay church it's not your confession is different than mine john confession is different your walk is different than my wife your experience is different than mine experiences but god works with us he wants us [Music] but we're always trying to condemn somebody we talk about a message of love but can we really love somebody you know many times we say i love all my brothers and sisters here but it's also our obligation christians to love everybody where did jesus go and see why it's not functioning the way it should in our lives so after this confession and this is where i got the message i was reading the scriptures let me turn to luke 22 32. vamos a lucas bentidos luke 22 32. look at those i'm just going to read the last part of that so i want you to capture and and just remember he went and he said thou art the christ the son of the living god and faithful the art the christ the saint peter el mismo pedro was casting out demons and bragging about it but jesus said wait peter moment when you're converted strengthen your brother and that got me scratching my head maybe converted means a lot more than what i think it does significa significa so i go and i begin to search this word and it says many things but the one that caught my attention to cause to return look at all the miracles that happened in the old testament so at the end of the message i'm going to tell you the miracle that happened tonight like our brother said our faith gets so mixed up with everything but it says to return to bring back detroit so this is the evidence here church if you're converted you want to be changed back back to that condition is oh i hope you could hope to be a good actor for me today okay it's probably the best but anytime the bible says it twice like behold simon simon behold divo simon simon satan had desired this is jesus knew everything about jesus christ picture now now let me tell you my version peter pedro satan wants to sift you satan you know church thank you iglesia he loved peter pedro but now satan came peter he didn't know what the lord was doing for the third time do you love me he said you know i do lord so many times we don't think about the importance of our lives but god thinks highly of us you know many things happened before the holy ghost had even come on he said when the holy ghost or what the holy ghost was given for por la que puedo el espiritu santo was so that peter pedro could be converted he said he couldn't be converted until the holy ghost was given so you look and it changes the perspective it can be perspective because you go to john 14 12 again he that believeth on me pedro work that jesus christ did why would we forget that because that is going to be what produces the works but why shouldn't we die if that's what jesus created jesus we gotta see the same thing in our midst and it's easy yes it's so easy to put it off and make an excuse oh it's not just miracles it's other stuff oh no you got it hard eternal life i understand that's to me the most important is to impart eternal life but it also produces the works the miracles if you're sick there's no reason to wait there's nothing impossible for god if your life's in shambles just do you see if your life's tore up broken god can fix it this is our prophet the same holy spirit the prophet that save the lutherans that saint to fight the messages that baptize the pentecostals that's where many people finish their seven church ages he says now aorta set in an order a church an iglesia that draws the rest of them from the grave it's going to be so powerful what's happening as long as we let things come in front of us that coat will never come to pass that coat will never come to pass but then part of it is recognizing who your brothers and sisters are maybe you see it differently than i do but maybe your way is going to help me church we got to change iglesias as you stand to your feet i can't see my sister falling down i believe right now is but it's time to call upon him yeah many of us are in trouble right now but his presence is here if you need him this is but then i looked at the message i was bringing forth the lord how am i going to bring this message if i can't pull from your faith lord the god of your patriarchs lord lord they did all that without the holy ghost but it's been given in this last days whatever you need from the lord just reach out and and touch him tonight [Music] you're my provider [Music] you are more than enough for me [Music] and by your strife i have been set free [Music] lord you are with lord
