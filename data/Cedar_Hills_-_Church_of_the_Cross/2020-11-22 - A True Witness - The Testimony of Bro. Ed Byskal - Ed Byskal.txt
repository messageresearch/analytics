========================================

[Music] [Music] h [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] would like to tell you of some native Indian people that were down here at the coast of on British Columbia on Van cver Island there was a the chief of ulet tribe his name was Jack Patrick he was a Christian I lived in his house when I would go up there for meetings and his wife and his uncle who became a very dear friend of mine Albert Jackson and his wife the four of them had brought a a sister up once again this event actually spans many years but yet the actual event which I'm relating happened in these meetings and they came up for the meetings because I had spoken of arranging these meetings in Grand Prairie and Dawson Creek so they drove the 800 miles up to Dawson Creek and then found out that the first meetings were in Grand Prairie they almost came back which would have been a great disappointment to me they had a woman with them that was dying with cancer and she had a terrible issue of blood I I don't know much about it except I was to find out and in the years that followed and uh brother Brenham called her out and told her to stand she wasn't strong enough to stand and he called her out and said that she would be healed or whatever more I don't know to have faith and the native Indian people had a very simple faith and they were staying in a motel they told me that that night they were in the motel and in the middle of the night at some time she became violently ill I think sister Albert Jackson went with her to the washroom and she passed a large cancer many years later now this is the other aspect many years later we had moved to Toronto were in Toronto for several years moved back here here to Sur and now had the meetings and a church here a woman a native Indian woman from Port El Bernie who was in the meetings her name is Agnes dick she came over to our church here in Su and was here in the house we had meetings in the house and she was in the meetings in the house just once in all the years we've been here she was just there once and this was many years after 1961 it probably was at least 1972 73 so 10 11 12 years later she was came to Vancouver because she was in the medical field and nursing or something and she took a special course there and came out here and saw us just once and that's why I like to be able to convey to you I was there I was in the meetings I had arranged the meetings I knew the people Chief Jack Patrick his wife Albert Jackson his wife and now Sister Agnes dick comes over and spends one service with us and after the service I was telling her about this she said they stopped at my home on the way up and she said they spent the night and she said the woman was issuing blood and so on so badly it soaked through she said I had to put sheets under her and it soaked through into the mattress and I told them do not take her she will not make the journey she will not be a she will not live for that Journey that long journey to Dawson Creek and Fort and Grand Prairie and she said she was she got healed and she's still living today and that was many years later 10 12 15 years later and she's still living today I think that I should say say something was something registered in the hearts of the native people sister Agnes dick when I had been when I had been there living there on Vancouver Island which was some years before this woman was healed and I had a unique experience with this Albert Jackson he was a very very very elderly man and had a real scowly looking face just like a great storm and I I thought that he was angry with me first time I met him I thought he was very angry with me I preached but now a short time later here we are having a meeting in Port El Bernie which is probably 50 60 miles from UK cluet and he came to me because we had this very close connection he could not speak English well so he said to me he said I was to preach in the long house and there was about 300 people there and so he Albert Jackson said uh fo you a you that's before you a fo you speak I speak I said okay brother Albert before I speak you want to speak before you I speak okay I said that's fine so before I got up and spoke and I remember what I spoke on I spoke on the midnight hour and the workers and the laborers that were called at the different times and I said it's very very late [Music] and he got up and spoke in his native tongue all I noticed was all the children were lined up on little bench with on blocks of wood and they were just sitting he they were transfixed with him as he spoke in his native tongue this sister Agnes dick that I just talked about got up after and she came to the front and she said I don't think I could ever be the same again she said I know that brother Bisal doesn't know anything of our language and I know that Albert Jackson doesn't know anything of English and he gets up and speaks to us in our native tongue and brother Bisal gets up and speaks in English and they both said almost the same thing word for word word and she said I can never be the same so there were Supernatural things that were happening at that time but here maybe 20 30 years later is a network and a woman is healed from cancer and then they are affected by our lives and our ministry and when it comes down to Sister Agnes dick passing her husband calls he's 82 years old then has his grandchildren called brother Eddie bisco many years and I go back to Port El Bernie and there so we have a a very very unique connection and all I can say is they're caught in uh in a web of Supernatural things that were happening so I would like to say the supernatural God that was calling the woman to stand the supernatural God that healed her from cancer the supernatural God that kept her alive for many years and then to have the same Supernatural God call us to come over and give testimony and to speak and to sing and to give testimony once again so that they would know the God that was demonstrating himself on the platform was the same God [Music] [Music] h [Music] [Music] we lived in Victoria and uh I got a call from my brother saying that my dad had had uh a massive heart attack the main artery of to his heart had ruptured out and he was just hanging on a thread and uh in those days they had oxygen tents where they put them over you so my husband called the doctor in Dawson Creek and the doctor said you'd better send her up so it was about a 2hour flight I guess up to Dawson so I went up and and I was only able to stand by his bed for 10 minutes and a day and not not speak to him he couldn't speak of course and I was there for 2 or 3 days and then I had to come back because we were now preparing for brother bram's meetings I was very burdened for him my heart was very heavy and we went into the alurn meetings with that on my heart wanting to speak to brother brandham and ask him to pray for him but I didn't have a chance because I was playing the piano and then we came down to Victoria and had the meetings there and the meetings closed and brother Ed was speaking to brother brandham and just saying goodbye to him and we stood outside the motel and it was evening late evening and they were just saying goodbye in a very casual way and then he just turned and said oh by the way sister piscal your father will be all right and from then on he recovered and I think he was about 64 when he had that attack and from then on he had no trouble with his heart not one minute and he lived just a month from 85 and he passed away just from old age no trouble with his heart whatsoever and when brother Bram said he'll be all right he was all right and he he confessed he said I know I'm saved in Al Bernie I was in the meetings there when brother Brown was there and hearing him call out the native Indian people that I knew and I knew their situations I don't know if he told about this one uh brother his name was Mike and he was sitting right up probably the second row from the front and everybody knew about an older man who was from a little fishing Village called a houset he had been an invalid just laying on the C for years and uh and brother bradam said to this brother Mike you're praying for this man and he's an invalid and he's in a hospital not far from here in a city called Nimo well brother Ed knew that this brother was from AET so in his his mind he said no this brother is not in a Nimo he's in a houset and another brother on the platform said no this brother is not in Nimo he's in alurn in a hospital and afterwards they found out yes he had been moved that very day up to the Indian Hospital in Nimo and brother Bram had said he's in the nimu brother Robert Johnson um took brother branam out in his boat this is in the alurn area and it was out on the alurn canal and uh brother Johnson and his wife were unable to have children and they had prayed about having a child and uh as they were going along in the boat uh suddenly they thought they had hit a log what they call a dead head it's a floating log just below the surface very dangerous to to boats if they hit that and and uh brother brandham said to brother Johnson you thought you thought you hit a dead head that was the presence of the Lord letting you know that he's going to give you and your wife a child we lived with the native people that ulet we stayed in their house I wouldn't even want to tell you the conditions of things that we saw but you know that's the way it is you know when you when you don't want to put your elbows on the table because you know they're going to stick there you know and little kids running around without diapers or anything else you know and there's no Plumbing there's no running water there's at one at one house we stayed in there they gave us the room with the bed and up one corner of the room goes a Stairway that goes upstairs and between the steps it's all open so they gave us the room of the curtain across the door so we get into the bed and at every step there's a little kid looking through the you know through the stairs yeah and there was 18 of us in that house yeah so but I don't know you look back on it and I love those people I want to I like to go back yeah and we saw some wonderful things take place we saw we know one woman that at one point drunk crawling on her hands and knees along the muddy path to the to get to her house you know and then the next thing we saw her she's just wonderfully saved and transformed and you just you just Rejoice over those things yeah the change that you see in these people only God can do it drunks one brother we know he he got on the ferry to Victoria and go to he was drunk when he got on the ferry over to from point A to point B drunk when he came back drunk when he walked to his house on the reserve and his the little kid comes up to him and says daddy listen to what I heard today for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son and that man was saved transformed right there from that scripture a wonderful believer so yeah it's good [Music] [Applause] [Music] coming home the other night or the other day or just before I come home I was fell into a vision and I seen some little fellas thin look like young boys or something had on caps and we were standing hunting and I'd shot a mammoth big brown looking bear and then they turned around and said to me said um but there's some confusion about the meeting and I said no matter what the confusion is if I supposed to go wherever it was I'll go anyhow see it doesn't matter in the vision stop I don't know where that's at but this is on tape it's going to happen just remember it's going to happen it's a vision on one of the trips uh we had just arrived and made camp and uh brother brother Southwick said Blain why don't you and Billy Paul and brother Ed uh go this Direction and I and brother Brandon will we'll we'll go up the mountain just behind us here and I think that he wanted to do that because on the first day of the hunt he wanted to um be take brother brand a little bit easier and he wanted it a little easier for himself as well because he had you know suffered a wee bit with angina so they were going to take it easier and we made our way uh down the valley and then up into another Little Valley and we just climbed up on a bench and there was a giant bear coming down the other side of this Valley not far from us and he was making his way and we kind of positioned ourselves behind some Willows I never saw a bear like this before or since and he was quite dark very large and right from behind his ears and over over his hump and down his down his cape down his breast like so he was just the color of golden wheat I never saw a bear like that it was the most magnificent thing and large and he was turning over stones and looking for ants and things and maybe rodents and so on and he was making his way L down and and I know that Grizzlies are very poor sighted but they're hearing and and especially their smell is so accurate we don't know that world at all but God has given them that and he when he walked out to the where the hills turned into this Valley and he just across from us and Billy Paul and brother Blaine and myself we got down in the Willows there was just small Willows there and we were watching this bear and he came down and he was across from us he was probably four five 600 yards across the mouth of this little Valley it was started like a wash from a basin and uh we were watching him and uh the other brother Brothers thought I should try a shot at it and I said no I wouldn't do that I said brother Brenham hasn't fired a shot yet that I know of I said I I wouldn't want to do that we didn't know it had not connected it with the a vision brother Bram had had of a large big brown bear and this was him and we watched him for probably half an hour and then I saw that bear and he just put that giant head up into the air and the wind and he uh he was he tossed his head back and forth and he was trying to get our scent and then he just went like this and looked straight across the valley at us and then he wheeled around and started on a gallop and he ran straight up this mountain I timed him it was probably 10 12 minutes and he went right right over the top of this mountain up into the glacier and his big paws and we were watching in the glasses and he ran right over the top of this mountain and disappeared that day brother Billy Paul had gotten a caribou and I also got a caribou later in the afternoon and the next day was just a cloudy Stormy Weather and it rained and it was cold and that night and the next day and the next day and the next day 4 days we were locked into the tent and I heard brother Southwick he kind of came by because I was kind of the point man and arranged the Hunts and bought the food and got things you know organized for the hunt and uh so he kind of he just came by me he said I think brother Brenham wants to go home oh I said you know that was a shock to me I couldn't believe that he wanted to go home we hadn't really started the hunt in Earnest so I said to brother brandham I I said brother brandham do you do you want to go home oh he said we've had a wonderful hunt I said but you haven't even fired a shot he said well that means I can come back next year and uh he took it so nicely and and I felt I felt kind of downhearted that to me it hadn't been completed and uh it was raining and cloudy and the clouds were hanging low and it was cold and it was just very miserable weather so Bud started to pack up things and make ready to go and it was uh I was feeling quite downcast and we had the horses outside and now starting to put the panyards on them and this is quite a lengthy process probably take 2 and 1 half three hours and uh I was outside with my horse and brother Brenham he came up and he said brother Eddie where was it that you saw that bear and I said well I pointed down the valley I said it's right down here and where those that little uh Valley comes in to this one I said you just turn left and he go right up in there and he was right on the bench of the mountain and he said uh how long how long are we going to be so we asked bud how long are we going to be oh he said you have lots of time you just take your time and go and and uh you know you've got a lot of time probably a couple of hours yet so brother Brenham just disappeared in the little short Willows and he was gone and and brother Bud carried on and I was standing with my horse and we were in our rain gear and this was really remarkable and then finally I got on my horse and I was sitting on my horse and brother brandham about an hour and a half or two hours later he came out he he'd been out he' actually been alone with God I believe and he came out and he uh came up right beside my horse and this is what happened to me this this is what I heard and this is my testimony and he said put his finger up he said this is on account of me he he said and some people might be offended with this but this is what he said I'm the Jonah in this group he said I knew I should have been with you little fellows he said it's the only time I know that I've disobeyed a vision only twice only twice that I've known I've disobeyed a vision and he said uh like this was the second time and he said uh but he said this is over and we'll right out of here dry dry the leaves on the bushes were just Laden with rain and wet and if you just went a a few meters few yards into the woods because there were short Willows but if you would just go a few yards you'd be soaking wet and I was just I was bewildered I didn't know what to say I didn't know how to respond and I just sat there and I was sitting there about maybe 10 minutes and pondering the words that I've just heard but we'll drive we'll ride out of here dry it's over he said it's over and we'll ride out of here dry so all I knew is that whatever uh disappointment there was or he'd settled something with God or whatever I wasn't questioning I didn't try to figure things out I just knew it was over and in about 10 minutes not more than 10 12 15 minutes at the most there was a puff of air warm air that just kind of blew by by me and I thought boy that was nice that was nice warm air and I we hadn't felt that for a number of days and just a little puff of air and then little while later there was a little breeze and the leaves were shaking and I noticed a probably 20 30 yards or meters in front of me a sun the Sun was shining just a big round spot where the Sun was shining thought well I I looked up there was a hole in the sky and I was looking at Blue Sky and the Sun was shining straight through there on the ground and a little warm breeze was just like a Hawaiian Breeze was blowing just a lovely little breeze and the leaves were shaking and and before our horses took the first step it was hot sunshine I took off the rain gear that I had on and we rode out of there in our shirt sleeves and it was very warm weather and we rode all the way home about 8 hours in the perfect sunshine and just a lovely day you couldn't have had a more picture perfect day than that day and we just rode out dry I want to say to the viewers if we' rode out wet you wouldn't be hearing this testimony we rode out dry that's what he said and that's exactly what happened and I want to give all the glory to our Lord Jesus Christ the people and many people don't understand some don't think well it's not fulfilled Etc I would like to I have a couple of slides here that we'd like to refer to and I'd like to quote this is in September 1962 after the hunt and it's in the message countdown brother brandham says so I in these 30 going on 32 years of ministry I have tried to stay true to I don't know one thing I've ever had to Al on because I just read it out of the Bible said just what the Bible say and let it go like that and so I haven't had to take back or rearrange because I just said it the way that the Bible says it and I find out if God has spoken anything then we must go with that word in order to make it be fulfilled amen amen we've seen that as I told you last night of a vision just recently see that I had to be there and warning to be there and telling me 6 months before to be on that spot and standing there and saying go down there three times with them and I just walk on the other man and the vision passed right through exactly God's part I was left standing so we want to remember you've got to stay on the word stay right with the word where the word leads you go right with the word and you'll bring you out all right bring you out all right I'm sure and that that for my part is the absolute solution and to the vision uh I I'm just sorry that a lot of people either don't ask their pastors or they don't research it in the message and then some just speak presumptuously that's without authority of any kind they don't have any Supernatural Authority they don't have the attendance of the Angel of the Lord and they go and say that brother brandham spoke presumptuously well I can I can declare he did not he spoke with great Authority and great clarity and furthermore I was right there it never belittled or diminished him when he said this is on account of me it never occurred to me that that it made less of him I always thought it was great it was greater that he could actually say it this is on account of me I mean I didn't want to be selfish but the fact that we wrote out dry and the weather changed I thought what kind of man is this you know that speaks to the wind and the waves and speaks to the storm and the clouds and what is this what's God doing for me you know I always thought that it was just beyond uh beyond what was almost necessary you know that we that we that I I I would be privileged to experience that and here I it it baffled me that people would find that as a reason to disbelieve I thought what a world is going through their minds I just I can't even understand it today I just can't understand it he just lived lived it lived the full life of the Lord Jesus Christ uh whether it was whether it was in honor or whether he was admitting that he wasn't standing where he should be as he said in the message and he told it right publicly to the people and you have to be standing where you standing with the word if it's to be fulfilled and then it'll be all right [Music] [Music] we were driving in his vehicle he was driving I was sitting in the passenger side and Blaine Southwick was in the back seat I don't know what Blaine was doing at this moment but brother brandham was just driving and it was a gravel Alaska Highway was still gravel there and he said he tilted his head back a little bit and he said brother Eddie what do you think of this ministry do you think it could be that of Elijah the prophet as it's foretold in the scripture and then he mentioned several time several places and then he said into Revelation and then his voice just trailed off well I want to stop there brother bram's voice when he was I would say deep under anointing in the deep in a vision he's actually in another world and he would say uh-huh uh-huh you notice when he was when he is has people before him and he starts telling them in detail about their lives and about why they're there and you're praying for someone and he was in the war and you have a letter from your daughter and in your purse and uhhuh uhuh and his voice would just get what I call thick kind of deep and thick and trails off and sometimes not very clear in what he's saying not too hard not too easy to hear well that's how the voice went and so I knew that he was just under uh in a deep somewhere in a deep vision said what do you think of this ministry he did not say my Ministry he said this ministry you think it could be that of Elijah the prophet as it's foretold in the scriptures in the Revelation and so on and then he just trailed off I said well for I felt very inadequate to answer that kind of a question I didn't feel spiritually adequate in I didn't feel as though I was adequate to answer that question and I looked down at the glove box and I said well for all I know brother brandom it must be it has every appearance of being and at and and then he said I kind of think so myself and at that instant with a complete Union of what our agreement in agreement at that instant all I can tell you is that it was a person I believe the angel of the Lord just between us and slightly forward not right here but just slightly forward the presence of a person and I literally I froze I thought I was going to die I thought I was going to pass into some other place I didn't know anything about and I was just staring at the box and I was afraid to move and the presence was so holy the presence was so all consuming you just could not not that you wanted to escape it but it was just um just all complete complete presence gripping you and I just stared at the box and I I looked up I only knew one thing to do and that is to see how brother brandom is reacting to this and I just looked I cast my eyes kind of sideways to look at him we had about 4 days beard on three 4 days beard I would say we we we we had been out in the bush and his beard was sticking out prickling like very prickly and and his face was pale and I thought he looks like a person near death I'd only seen it once before in my life and I'd been with a very good friend of mine I just came to his house I just pulled in and he had been pinned between two heavy pieces of equipment with his temples and had truck and a loader behind it and he was pinned between the two and he used all of his strength probably a supernatural strength at that moment and just to press the push the two pieces of equipment apart in that freedom and when I happened to drive in they had him laid out on his sofa and I noticed that his beard from the shock to the system his beard had prickled out and he was just pale and that whole image just flashed through my mind in an instant when I looked at brother Brenham and that I just thought that and brother Brenham kind of rolled his head back looked over to me he said I guess he's come to me brother Eddie 10,000 times 10,000 and that's every time the same it's just like I could die [Music] and at that instant we were just driving a curve in the highway and there was a big bull moose standing right in the middle of the road and it it startled me oh I said I said brother brandom there's a moose and I hadn't gotten a moose and I needed a moose and he just kept driving he never slowed down we were we weren't not going fast he said it's all right brother Eddie just get your gun in your shells and kind of like he's yours sort of thing and he just kept driving he drove up so close that that and I shot that moose and uh we dressed the Moose out and brother bandam sat here just on my left and he sat on the log and we just dressed the Moose out and when we were done we walked back to the car and I I stepped into the car and just closed the door and I can't describe the atmosphere it was it was just so Serene and so marvelous that the after effect of the whole thing and the presence of that person and brother Brown said every time he comes something good happens and I've used that phrase many times every time he comes whether it's in a church service or in a family's life or a home is a distinct atmosphere of the person of the Lord Jesus Christ and every time he comes something good happens [Music] in [Music] [Music] [Music]
