[14:19] better good morning everyone how are you
[14:21] guys
[14:22] doing
[14:24] amen that's what I'm talking about wake
[14:26] up how many you guys stayed up late last
[14:28] night yeah how many of you had a good
[14:31] reason to stay up late last night yeah
[14:33] what were you doing watching TV what or
[14:36] praising the Lord I like that answer
[14:38] don't know if it's true but I like that
[14:41] answer uh first of all I just like to uh
[14:44] bring greetings uh in the name of my
[14:46] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ man I'm so
[14:48] thrilled to be here grateful for this
[14:51] opportunity once again to stand on this
[14:53] platform which you guys probably don't
[14:55] remember the last time I was up here but
[14:57] just understand it's a a a very very
[15:01] humbling moment a very very humbling
[15:04] situation to be in um those you who get
[15:07] up here and song Lead and play these
[15:10] instruments man I pray to God you guys
[15:12] never take it for granted never take it
[15:15] so uh to get
[15:17] started um ask a quick question how many
[15:21] of you guys in here love the
[15:23] Lord easy answer right all right next
[15:26] question is how many of you guys love
[15:29] love the
[15:30] Lord okay same answer right so how many
[15:33] of you guys trust the
[15:35] Lord with all of your
[15:37] heart right we're going to see because
[15:40] I'm going to test you I'm going to test
[15:41] you based on some of the things that I
[15:45] know probably at least half of you are
[15:48] going through or have gone through in
[15:49] your lives I don't know most of you I
[15:52] know your faces whenever I come back I
[15:54] see you you smile you say hello brother
[15:57] I love you love you guys too but I don't
[16:00] truly know you so today hopefully you
[16:04] have an opportunity to get to know
[16:07] yourselves a little better and hopefully
[16:10] after this service I'll get to know most
[16:12] of you a little better so if you guys
[16:15] would real quick if you have your Bibles
[16:17] uh turn to uh Psalms 13 1-5 this is
[16:21] going to be NLT version so if you have
[16:23] the King James
[16:24] version you you probably won't
[16:27] necessarily be able to follow this
[16:28] wording IED use this version uh because
[16:31] I think it just really really simplifies
[16:33] it it really breaks it down where it
[16:36] doesn't matter if you're 8 years old or
[16:38] if you're 18 you can probably understand
[16:41] it you guys have it please say Amen am
[16:45] all
[16:46] right so Psalms 13 1-5 starting with
[16:49] verse one it says oh Lord how long will
[16:53] you forget forever how long will you
[16:57] look the other way
[17:00] verse two how long must I struggle with
[17:02] anguish in my soul with sorrow in my
[17:04] heart every
[17:06] day how long will my enemy have the
[17:09] upper
[17:10] hand verse three turn and answer me oh
[17:14] Lord my God restore the sparkle in my
[17:17] eyes or I will
[17:19] die verse four don't let my enemies
[17:23] gloat saying we have defeated
[17:26] him exactly don't let them Rejoice at my
[17:32] downfall in verse five which is slowly
[17:35] becoming probably one of my most
[17:38] favorite verses and it's so simple but
[17:41] gosh it just hits me every time I read
[17:43] it verse 5 says but I trust in your
[17:46] unfailing love I will rejoice because
[17:49] you have rescued me hallelujah how many
[17:52] of you guys have felt that just felt
[17:54] rescued by the Lord amen may the Lord
[17:57] add His blessings to the reading of the
[17:58] word please be seated
[18:02] so this the message I'm bringing forward
[18:05] today um first of all I'm going go back
[18:07] to verse five because again verse five
[18:10] you're talking a man that was we're
[18:12] talking about David and and when David
[18:15] was in in prison in gath and I'm not
[18:16] going to really go into that I can't get
[18:18] into the book of David and all that
[18:19] stuff we'll be here all day and I don't
[18:21] have that kind of time um but verse five
[18:25] with everything that he was going
[18:27] through
[18:29] that's the one thing that he had on his
[18:31] heart at one point that was in his heart
[18:33] which is I trust in your unfailing love
[18:36] I will rejoice because you have
[18:38] rescued okay
[18:42] so I'm I'm going to define the word
[18:45] trust now I looked this
[18:48] up and and I I didn't have him put it in
[18:51] the slide
[18:53] but I looked up a definition for it I
[18:56] just Google give me give me a definition
[18:57] of trust
[18:59] and one of the things that came up
[19:02] was to firm belief in the
[19:05] reality truth ability or strength of
[19:09] someone or something then it says
[19:12] relations have to be built on
[19:16] trust now it also says similar words are
[19:22] confidence belief and
[19:26] Faith okay now when I look up faith and
[19:29] I'm like okay what's the difference
[19:30] between faith and trust and I can't I'm
[19:32] not really even going to get into that
[19:34] because brother Duron killed it last
[19:36] night he absolutely killed it and he
[19:38] just crushed my message to be honest so
[19:41] you know I had to kind of deviate some
[19:43] things um but when I look that up like
[19:46] faith and trust and what's the
[19:47] difference it says faith and trust have
[19:50] similar meanings and often people will
[19:52] use words interchangeably even Mariam
[19:54] Webster defines Faith as belief and
[19:57] Trust in and loyalty to
[20:00] God uh now for most people there is no
[20:03] practical difference between faith and
[20:06] trust but today we're going to hit on
[20:08] trust and the question I ask which is my
[20:11] title is who do you trust not who do you
[20:16] trust who do you trust no who do you
[20:19] trust not who do I trust because for me
[20:22] it's who do I trust but it's for you who
[20:25] do you trust all right so
[20:31] understanding the the interchangeable
[20:34] parts of faith and
[20:36] trust
[20:38] um understand young people that without
[20:42] faith we have nothing um we are
[20:48] nothing uh we're talking about
[20:49] relationships we're talking about trust
[20:51] we're talking about faith um I read a
[20:54] quote once that said if we expect
[20:56] nothing from the Lord we get nothing
[20:59] from the Lord so to expect something
[21:02] from the Lord and to want something or
[21:05] expect to get something from the Lord
[21:07] you got to have faith right you got to
[21:08] have trust and we're going to keep
[21:10] coming back to that word trust I'm not
[21:11] going to hit so much on faith but you
[21:13] guys know again they're interchangeable
[21:16] so uh about three years
[21:20] ago I was asked to come and and give my
[21:22] testimony here most of you probably
[21:24] don't remember that all right but when I
[21:27] gave my my testimony
[21:29] it was a very like I said a very
[21:31] humbling experience to just be standing
[21:32] here be able to share my life with you
[21:34] guys and share my testimony and what I
[21:36] went through growing up not just as a
[21:38] child but as an old man I know I look 25
[21:42] but I'm not I'm I'm old enough to be the
[21:45] grandparent of most of you in here
[21:47] believe it or not I just I wear it well
[21:51] sorry so and one of the things too I I
[21:54] have to try to remember I'm going to put
[21:55] this out there because I just think it's
[21:56] important um brother Caleb when he asked
[21:59] me to a little bit of a backstory when
[22:01] he asked me to come and do this today of
[22:04] course I said sure whatever you need me
[22:06] to do brother Caleb he said well you
[22:08] know just give the people or give the
[22:09] youth something positive give them
[22:11] something to um to look forward to to be
[22:15] positive about I'm like okay so so just
[22:17] be a coach and I don't think brother
[22:19] Caleb truly understands that I'm a coach
[22:22] that's my nickname is coach all right so
[22:24] I've coached nearly 18 years of track
[22:26] and field I've coached basketball I've
[22:28] Co coach Pop Warner football um you guys
[22:30] lucky I forgot my whistle cuz I was
[22:32] really going to bring it and I forgot it
[22:34] but I will tell you the first person
[22:35] that refers to me is bro while I'm
[22:37] standing up here AB um we'll be doing
[22:40] push-ups I'm just saying so that a
[22:42] little bit of coach is in me but the
[22:43] other part of being a coach is we talk a
[22:46] lot we love to talk you know what I mean
[22:49] because that's how we get our points
[22:50] across and a lot of times when we're
[22:52] coaching and we're talking we're
[22:54] demonstrating so everything's pretty
[22:56] animated right and we're constantly
[22:59] repeating repeating repeating because
[23:01] it's the process so how many of you have
[23:04] played organized
[23:05] Sports how many of you have had a coach
[23:07] that said trust the
[23:09] process you may not understand the
[23:11] workout we're doing right now I know it
[23:13] hurts you know you're in pain you want
[23:15] to quit but trust the process because
[23:18] right now you're dealing with all of
[23:20] this but on the backside you're going to
[23:22] see the results okay our relationship
[23:25] with the Lord is no different we have to
[23:27] trust the process
[23:29] all right we go to him because there's
[23:31] things that we need there's things that
[23:32] are troubling us things that we don't
[23:34] understand our body's going through
[23:35] changes our parents are mean uh the my
[23:39] teacher doesn't like
[23:40] me and the Lord says be patient trust
[23:43] the process like brother Tommy Jr said a
[23:46] long time ago sometimes we just have to
[23:48] watch the picture develop right okay so
[23:53] going back a little bit of my childhood
[23:56] um uh grew up in a a very very humble
[24:00] environment not a lot of money um hardly
[24:03] any money uh but I had a very
[24:05] hardworking mother that that worked for
[24:07] everything that we needed we didn't have
[24:10] most of what we wanted it just wasn't
[24:12] that way that wasn't our life but we had
[24:15] almost everything we needed you know we
[24:17] didn't eat steak shrimp maybe once a
[24:19] year we got to go to Red Lobster and get
[24:20] the little popcorn shrimp and a little
[24:22] piece of steak that we got split drink
[24:24] of Shirley Temple right all right like
[24:26] once a year but we never missed a meal
[24:29] might have been a baln sandwich but we
[24:31] never missed a meal right wrong balone
[24:34] brother exactly especially when you're
[24:36] fried just right and get that little
[24:37] burn on it right and if and if you're
[24:39] really feeling froggy you like poke a
[24:41] hole in it see if you can get the bubble
[24:42] to go down you guys don't know anything
[24:45] about that actually joson does and Maya
[24:47] does okay Jon just did it the other day
[24:49] she was so excited Dad
[24:53] look amazing right yeah so but there was
[24:57] no social media there was nothing to
[24:59] really draw our attention away from the
[25:02] world around us like right now man you
[25:04] guys and I feel I feel bad for you I
[25:05] really do um in one aspect and that's
[25:09] the fact that you're surrounded by
[25:11] social media everything's social media
[25:13] everything is right here and everything
[25:16] here is not good that's right probably
[25:18] 98% of what's in here is bad right all
[25:22] right we know it's the enemy right okay
[25:24] so we we didn't have that we played
[25:27] outside man we we would we would get
[25:30] bikes bicycle parts from my house and my
[25:32] buddy's house over here and but and we
[25:34] put a bike together we all shared the
[25:36] bike yeah you know or we go out in the
[25:38] woods behind our apartment complex and
[25:41] we we get some scrap wood and we get
[25:42] some cardboard and next thing you know
[25:44] we've got a fort and we're hanging out
[25:46] in there all day till we hear Michael
[25:49] right Ramone get in the house you know
[25:52] we're here we all come running Andre
[25:54] let's go you know we all go running in
[25:56] the house right so that's the kind of
[25:58] life we live you know we have these you
[26:01] know people would in the neighborhood
[26:02] would throw out their mattress so we get
[26:05] the mattresses and we put them at the
[26:07] end of our building and we're tumbling
[26:09] Bo we're doing gymnastics we're flipping
[26:12] mind you some of the people in our
[26:13] neighborhood obviously had some bladder
[26:14] problems if you get my drift so all
[26:17] those mattresses weren't to cleanest
[26:19] mattresses but that's all we had to play
[26:21] with right that's how we kept from
[26:22] breaking our necks when we tried to do a
[26:23] double Su assault and miss you know
[26:26] that's how we kept from killing
[26:27] ourselves was to use those nasty
[26:29] mattresses but that was our life man and
[26:31] we were happy we were happy and the the
[26:35] way we got through it was we had
[26:38] trust okay not necessarily for me back
[26:41] then was it trust in the Lord because I
[26:43] didn't truly understand that but I had
[26:45] trust in my mother that she was going to
[26:47] take care of us her trust was in the
[26:50] Lord because that's all she had she had
[26:52] nothing else all right
[26:54] so as we grow
[26:57] up uh
[26:59] um we you know we developed these
[27:01] friends and and you know we got our
[27:03] siblings but we got these friends in the
[27:05] neighborhood and our neighborhood was a
[27:06] very tight-knit neighborhood whether I
[27:08] was in Florida or whether I went to AR
[27:10] when we finally moved to Arkansas even
[27:11] when I went to Germany as a as a a a
[27:14] junior in high school we we developed
[27:17] these tight-knit neighborhoods we
[27:18] weren't gangs we were just friends and
[27:21] with those friends like even with your
[27:23] siblings I'm sure you
[27:25] too get in the fights every now and then
[27:28] I know Judah and Hannah did because I've
[27:30] heard the stories but these two brothers
[27:33] I know they get into fights I get into
[27:35] fights with my siblings but we loved
[27:36] each other and we trusted each other we
[27:38] always had each other's back if one
[27:40] fought and this is probably not a good
[27:41] thing but this is the way we were raised
[27:43] my mom would say if one of you fight you
[27:46] better all fight or everybody's getting
[27:47] a whipping when you come home that's
[27:49] just the way it was we had trust all
[27:52] right and I could go out and this is not
[27:55] I'm not making this up this is the truth
[27:57] I could go out out and be playing with
[27:59] one of my best friends 10:00 in the
[28:01] morning we get into a fight because we
[28:02] had a
[28:03] disagreement by 2:00 we were playing
[28:06] together again right we had each other's
[28:09] back we were friends now don't come from
[28:11] that neighborhood over here trying to
[28:13] start some mess because we had each
[28:15] other's back I might have just fought
[28:16] with him when it comes time to defend
[28:18] our neighborhood we're all fighting
[28:20] right yeah and I'm not condone in that
[28:22] I'm just saying that's how it was back
[28:25] then back then you could actually fight
[28:27] and walk away
[28:28] nowadays just walk away all right it's
[28:31] not worth it so when I when I turned 17
[28:35] I I I graduated high school uh 10 days
[28:39] later I went to Army boot camp and then
[28:41] from there I didn't even stop at home
[28:43] from army boot camp went straight to to
[28:46] college when I got there there was so
[28:49] much
[28:51] turmoil in
[28:53] here and so much in here because when I
[28:57] left I had this strange relationship
[29:00] strained relationship with my mother I
[29:03] was trying to grow up you know at 17
[29:05] years old I was the man of the house
[29:08] probably really from probably age 13
[29:10] when I got my first job like paycheck
[29:13] job not not you know sweeping my room
[29:16] and clean and putting away my clothes
[29:18] because that was part of my chores no I
[29:19] went to work I went across the street to
[29:21] the quick stop I stocked the the the
[29:24] coolers I swept the the the uh parking
[29:27] lot I cleaned the bathrooms why because
[29:30] I had to help all right although I
[29:32] trusted my mom there was things I wanted
[29:34] that Mom couldn't provide like Nike
[29:36] shoes and lei jeans and you know I
[29:39] didn't want to go to school going close
[29:40] to Kmart I just didn't I was too cool
[29:42] for
[29:43] that so but when I got to college man I
[29:46] was going through so much I was I was
[29:49] excited I just went through army boot
[29:50] camp that really made me a man it
[29:53] brought me out of my my shell because I
[29:56] was a complete introvert uh truly up
[29:58] until that point and the Army really
[30:00] helped me become a man I think but when
[30:03] I got there man with that strain
[30:06] relationship um it brought a lot of
[30:08] sadness in my life there was
[30:10] darkness and I understood that part of
[30:12] it but there was other things that went
[30:15] with that that I I at the time I just
[30:17] couldn't grasp I'm I'm I'm starting a
[30:20] new adventure you know in my life but
[30:22] yet I can't find that Joy anymore that I
[30:25] had when I was a kid and I had nothing I
[30:27] couldn't find that Joy
[30:28] but through the whole process of growing
[30:30] up I lost two sister by the time I was
[30:33] 16 15 two sisters passed away that was
[30:37] part of my testimony I know you guys
[30:39] probably don't remember but I had two
[30:41] sisters passed away so I was dealing
[30:43] with that leaving my mother I was
[30:45] dealing with that um not seeing my
[30:48] younger brother I was dealing with that
[30:50] not having my father in my life dealing
[30:53] with that so I was sad I was broken uh
[30:58] there was just Gloom all the time you
[31:00] know 17 goodlooking kid I'm in college I
[31:03] didn't play sports then but you know I'm
[31:05] seeing the young ladies and hey hey you
[31:08] would think that would have been my
[31:09] focus hey chase the girls enjoy college
[31:12] party I didn't get any of that none of
[31:14] that experience did I have because I was
[31:17] broken
[31:19] now when I finally realized that
[31:22] something was truly wrong I had a friend
[31:25] of mine uh who was kind of like a Aunt
[31:28] to me I went back to my town to visit I
[31:31] went back to a football game as an
[31:32] alumni you know you get invited back to
[31:34] come watch the games and stuff and I
[31:36] would go and I would stay at her house
[31:37] and finally she told me one day she's
[31:39] like you know what you need to go see
[31:40] your mother I can't have you come stay
[31:42] here anymore unless you go see your
[31:44] mother so with the way I was already
[31:46] feeling I thought man what do I have to
[31:49] lose I trusted this lady because she
[31:52] practically raised me and a lot of kids
[31:54] in our neighborhood because we always
[31:55] hung out of of the house and if she said
[31:57] that I should do that I thought man I
[31:59] got to trust her all right so I go visit
[32:03] my mom we have a conversation one of the
[32:06] things she told me was that you know
[32:07] what this is your home this is still
[32:10] your home you can always come back I
[32:12] think that was I went to the game Friday
[32:14] night Saturday morning I went to see my
[32:16] mom by Monday guess where I was I was
[32:18] back home I quit school I had to get
[32:22] back in my element but before I did
[32:25] that it wasn't just her voice that I
[32:28] heard when I got back to Pine Bluff
[32:30] Arkansas where I was going to College
[32:32] University of Arkansas Pine Bluff
[32:34] something told me and I didn't
[32:36] understand it then but I know now
[32:38] something told
[32:41] me I got
[32:43] you trust me this is not your
[32:47] environment this environment is
[32:50] broken you're in bondage I I didn't
[32:53] understand any of this stuff but now
[32:55] when I break it down I understand that's
[32:56] what he was saying to me that was the
[32:58] Lord talking to me amen he said go home
[33:01] this is not where you
[33:03] belong so I trusted that voice that I
[33:06] didn't know really I didn't understand
[33:09] because I went to church here and there
[33:11] you know at the time I was reading my
[33:12] Bible at the time I was going to a
[33:14] church that I would never go back to
[33:16] again because I saw so many bad things
[33:18] there but but something told me to go
[33:22] home so I went home it only took me two
[33:25] days I listened and I was gone now as I
[33:28] got
[33:29] older that same trust that I that I had
[33:33] in that voice that I didn't
[33:35] understand that trust kind of dwindled
[33:38] away why because I was doing
[33:41] better right I wasn't in that that funk
[33:44] that I was in I was doing better I
[33:46] didn't really need that voice that much
[33:48] anymore you know what I mean happy now
[33:50] man I I went and I joined the Air Force
[33:52] I think I had turned 18 by the time I
[33:54] left for boot camp for Air Force got a
[33:57] little money now I'm playing sports
[33:59] right you know I'm back on top again I'm
[34:01] traveling the world uh I'm competing my
[34:04] first trip to New Mexico was while I was
[34:06] competing for the air force uh in fast
[34:08] fo softball which is similar to baseball
[34:10] some of you young ladies probably know
[34:11] what it is but that's that's I was on
[34:14] top of the world I didn't need that
[34:16] voice that trust that I had was gone now
[34:20] all right so when you
[34:22] take and and I'm going to ask some
[34:24] questions and and I'll if you want to
[34:26] raise your hand by all means you can but
[34:28] you don't have to because I'm I'm kind
[34:30] of referring to me but I know I'm
[34:32] talking to probably quite a few of you
[34:35] when you refer back to verse one I don't
[34:39] know if it's up there if if you guys
[34:41] could put it up verse one from uh Psalms
[34:43] 13
[34:44] 1-5 if you guys have
[34:48] it all right when you refer back to that
[34:52] verse it says oh Lord how long will you
[34:55] forget forever
[34:58] how long will you look the other
[35:00] way and again you don't have to raise
[35:02] your hands
[35:03] but how many people in here have felt
[35:07] that yes sir yes sir like man the Lord
[35:11] has forgotten how many people have felt
[35:13] like Nathaniel under that tree like this
[35:15] is going so wrong in my life Lord this
[35:18] is when I need you the most but it's
[35:20] like you don't hear
[35:21] me you're not listening you don't see
[35:24] what's going on around me I felt that
[35:28] okay if you go to verse
[35:32] two how long must I struggle with
[35:34] anguish in my soul with sorrow in my
[35:36] heart every
[35:38] day how long will my enemy have the
[35:41] upper
[35:43] hand all right when I was in college I
[35:45] didn't understand what Depression was I
[35:47] had no idea what Depression was I was
[35:50] depressed I hate that word yeah I hate
[35:53] the word
[35:54] anxiety all right but I know they exist
[35:57] right now you go to a doctor and they're
[35:59] going to diagnose you you have anxiety
[36:02] take this pill okay now you're depressed
[36:06] because you took that pill right so now
[36:08] you have anxiety you have depression uh
[36:12] you have what else uh you're lazy now
[36:16] why because everything just bogged you
[36:17] down and you don't want to do anything
[36:19] you don't want to get up you don't want
[36:20] to go hang out with your friends you
[36:22] don't want to go to work anymore your
[36:23] little part-time job you just quit that
[36:25] because you just don't feel like it
[36:26] right so I I felt that scripture three
[36:31] I'm sorry verse
[36:33] three turn and answer me oh Lord my God
[36:38] restore the sparkle to my eyes or I will
[36:42] die now you're at a point to
[36:45] where you you you're kind of pleading
[36:48] with the Lord like okay I don't know
[36:50] what to do now what do I
[36:53] do you know you might
[36:56] have had uh let's see your first car
[37:00] that you you know you had for a couple
[37:01] of weeks or a couple of months boom you
[37:03] wreck that car your whole world just
[37:05] crumbles around you what am I going to
[37:07] do now or your first love your first
[37:10] girlfriend your first boyfriend I've
[37:11] gone through that man I saw a girl one
[37:14] day
[37:15] and talk about love at first sight I was
[37:19] like who is
[37:21] she
[37:22] wow and I have my cousin say bro you
[37:26] can't get her H you can't get her cuz
[37:29] I'm
[37:30] like I'm going to try though right I got
[37:34] her took me a few months but I got her
[37:36] right and we we dated for two three
[37:39] years I think it was she went on to
[37:41] college I was still in the Air Force two
[37:43] or three years great relationship for
[37:45] the most part but that environment she
[37:48] was in come on completely changed our
[37:51] relationship I thought that was a woman
[37:53] I was going to marry and live forever
[37:54] with but that environment that she was
[37:56] in our relationship all right so I was
[38:00] sad once again I was depressed I'm
[38:03] driving down the highway crying like I
[38:04] don't understand this Lord why Lord I
[38:07] don't I love her I don't okay but I know
[38:10] I'm not the only one that have gone
[38:11] through that right come on
[38:13] now but I when you I don't mean to seem
[38:17] and sound insensitive either
[38:19] but when I think about things like that
[38:23] that's what I call the to me I call that
[38:25] the pity party and we all have a pity
[38:27] party every now and then and it's almost
[38:29] expected when you don't truly know what
[38:32] you
[38:33] have I know some of you guys still don't
[38:36] realize what you have here you're in
[38:39] this ministry fivefold Ministry I never
[38:43] knew what that was I've never even heard
[38:45] of that if someone had told me that at
[38:46] 17 16 years old I would have think man
[38:49] the pastor does
[38:50] laundry what is he
[38:52] folding honestly I I I had no clue what
[38:55] that was are you serious but now but now
[38:59] now I know what it is I know what it
[39:02] means and you guys are privileged you're
[39:05] blessed to be in a situation where you
[39:08] have this
[39:10] ministry and if you're part of that
[39:12] Ministry back there where brother donon
[39:14] I've been there I've been to that church
[39:16] I get excited when I go to that church I
[39:17] get excited when I watch them on
[39:19] television when I hear them worshiping
[39:21] and praising I get excited you know
[39:24] there's times I I'll finish our service
[39:26] and I I know I've told this St before I
[39:27] think at his
[39:29] church I'll finish our service
[39:31] especially with the time change now I
[39:32] can go and I can watch the end of their
[39:34] service and there's times I'll go I'll
[39:36] be at work and I'll just go put my
[39:38] workout clothes on and I'll go walk and
[39:40] listen to it but there's times I'll sit
[39:42] in my room at work and I'll I'll watch
[39:43] it and I'm just watching the service and
[39:46] I'm it's just like watching Cedar Hills
[39:48] I'm up and down you know what I mean I'm
[39:50] praising and worshiping him in my room
[39:51] and I know some of the guys that work
[39:52] are probably wonder what is he doing in
[39:55] me but they know me now when I first
[39:57] started I'm sure they were wondering if
[39:59] I was losing my mind because I would go
[40:02] to other parts of the fire station I
[40:03] would go in the training room and I I
[40:04] get on the big screen man and I put
[40:06] servant up there I praise your worship
[40:08] by myself I'm singing All Out Loud all
[40:09] of the but I don't
[40:11] care you know what I mean that's what I
[40:14] do so when you when you get to verse
[40:18] four verse four says don't let my
[40:21] enemies gloat saying we have defeated
[40:23] him don't let them Rejoice at my
[40:26] downfall
[41:27] time they've attended church with us any
[41:28] kind of service I think my daughter did
[41:30] like one Bible study online with us and
[41:33] then that was it but she's been slowly
[41:35] finding herself in the Lord she's
[41:37] struggling with some things she's
[41:40] retired out of the Air Force at 29 years
[41:42] old so that right there should tell you
[41:43] she you may not understand that but
[41:45] normally you do 20 years and you retire
[41:48] or you have an opportunity to retire
[41:49] she's
[41:50] 29 so she did 7 eight years she's
[41:53] retired so that tells you she struggled
[41:55] with some things my parents struggle
[41:58] with a lot of things but you know their
[42:00] health their
[42:02] finances um their
[42:05] spirituality there's a lot of different
[42:07] things that they struggle with but they
[42:09] came now to get them
[42:13] here it was it was a fight it was a
[42:16] battle because I put the invitation out
[42:18] there I thought what do I have to lose
[42:19] all they can say is no right and now
[42:23] they've been around the Phoenix group
[42:25] and they understand now they're starting
[42:26] to see what the Phoenix group group is
[42:27] all about what that family is all about
[42:30] and when I invited them they were like
[42:33] oh yeah yeah we could probably go my
[42:36] daughter first time I I mentioned it to
[42:39] her she was yeah Dad I think I'd like to
[42:42] go all right little different answer
[42:44] from my parents right so my daughter
[42:46] just started a new job she went to her
[42:49] supervisor she's a chef a pastry chef he
[42:51] works at one of the finest restaurants
[42:53] in Scottdale
[42:55] Scottdale um and and she she talks to
[42:59] supervisor she said hey I i' like to go
[43:01] out of town for the weekend she works
[43:03] Monday through Friday normally just
[43:04] started this stop though she's only been
[43:06] there two three
[43:07] weeks uh we have a trip to New Mexico
[43:10] for church for for
[43:12] Passover uh well if you can find someone
[43:15] to swap your Friday yeah you could get
[43:17] Friday off okay mind you Monday through
[43:21] Friday my parents well I don't know you
[43:25] know our finances are tight and they are
[43:27] I'm so I'm not I'm not mocking them for
[43:29] that the finances are tight so I talk to
[43:32] my wife and I'm thinking you know I
[43:34] don't want them to miss this opportunity
[43:36] money can't be the issue you know let's
[43:38] let's let's try to work it out so I told
[43:41] my parents don't worry about it we'll
[43:42] we'll figure it out if you want to go
[43:44] I'll book the room we'll figure it out
[43:45] right so we're we're ready to go we're
[43:49] we're we're we're getting things
[43:50] together I talk to another brother tell
[43:53] him what's going on and I'm not I'm not
[43:55] going to say any names to them I'm going
[43:56] to put him out there like that he
[43:57] probably doesn't want want to know but I
[43:59] talk to him and he says what money
[44:02] shouldn't be an issue let them know they
[44:04] have a
[44:06] sponsor they want to go they have a
[44:09] sponsor so so I'm thinking all right

[44:18] they coming here but they're coming here

[47:54] to me he's not just talking to brother
[47:55] donon he's not just talking to brother
[47:57] Caleb talking to you you guys have that
[48:00] power we have that
[48:03] power you guys have to understand that
[48:05] we we can't allow the enemy to have
[48:07] control of us and control of our
[48:10] situations and life he doesn't have that
[48:13] power that's for us
[48:15] right do you think that the Lord would
[48:18] give us that type of authority if he
[48:21] didn't trust
[48:24] us he knew us before the foundation of
[48:27] the
[48:28] world you didn't think the Lord knew
[48:30] what kind of battles that we would face
[48:33] absolutely brother he knows he knows
[48:35] what you're going to go through right he
[48:37] knows what you're going through that's
[48:38] right we may not know what you're going
[48:40] through but he knows amen all right
[48:44] trust trust the process trust that he
[48:47] hears you trust that he sees you trust
[48:48] that he he sees you when you're crying
[48:50] at night and you're in your bedroom by
[48:52] yourself sees
[48:54] that all right don't lose that trust
[48:56] don't lose that
[48:58] Faith all right when I got baptized here
[49:00] four years
[49:03] ago brother Tommy Jr you guys are all
[49:06] gone man this
[49:08] is never imagined it would happen that
[49:10] way everyone had gone
[49:12] home we left the sanctuary went to
[49:15] Brother Caleb's house had a couple
[49:16] conversations a couple hours later we
[49:18] were back here just us brother Caleb
[49:21] brother Tommy my mother-in-law uh my
[49:23] wife my my my daughter uh brother Omar a
[49:28] few people that just came back over to
[49:30] the church got baptized right up here
[49:33] well used to be right
[49:34] there and he read acts
[49:39] 238 repent and be baptized every one of
[49:42] you in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[49:43] remissions of sins and ye shall receive
[49:45] the gift of the Holy
[49:47] Ghost and having received that
[49:51] gift I can tell you right now I'm I'm no
[49:54] longer the person I I used to be
[49:57] you know it took me a long time to get
[49:59] there it took me 50 52
[50:01] years 56 now almost 57 it took me 52
[50:05] years you guys are 12 13 14 years old
[50:08] take advantage of this take advantage of
[50:10] this opportunity now granted it I I keep
[50:13] getting told it wasn't your time it
[50:15] wasn't your time but I know there was
[50:17] opportunities for me to convert my life
[50:20] and become the person that that the Lord
[50:22] wanted me to be I believe there was
[50:24] because even though I didn't quite
[50:27] understand what was going on I had
[50:29] people interceding for me I think I had
[50:31] people I don't know if they were
[50:33] prophesying on my life because I didn't
[50:37] understand that but I had people that
[50:38] would pull me aside and go what are you
[50:39] waiting for I see you envisioning
[50:42] yourself standing up here this is after
[50:44] church service I'm sitting in the front
[50:45] PE just you know engaged like that's
[50:48] that's just me that's the kind of person
[50:49] I was then I get pulled aside afterwards
[50:52] that scared the Daylights out of me I
[50:53] didn't understand that so I don't know
[50:56] if that was the Lord you know
[50:58] interceding for me at that moment and I
[51:01] just didn't grasp it one of my best
[51:03] friends later on went to the Seminary
[51:04] became a
[51:05] pastor I love listening to him I love
[51:08] talking to him and learning from him but
[51:10] when he moved away for me all that went
[51:13] away this was when I'm an adult with a
[51:15] wife and children all of that went away
[51:17] from me so was that the Lord interceding
[51:20] for me right
[51:21] then I don't know because it didn't
[51:23] bring me in it took this family come on
[51:27] it took Cedar Hills come on it took
[51:29] brother
[51:30] donon to bring me in it took brother
[51:33] Judah it took my niece Maya to bring me
[51:36] in talk about it sir go ahead you know
[51:39] that's what it took for me to get where
[51:42] I'm
[51:44] at and I'm I'm getting ready to to wrap
[51:48] this up but brother Brenham what said
[51:52] and this is just a oneliner and I I I
[51:54] love it and it kind of sticks with me he
[51:56] said for some we as Christians may be
[51:57] the only Bible that some people ever
[52:01] read so if that's not Food For Thought
[52:03] for you I don't know what it is so I try
[52:05] to carry that with me I mean my walk
[52:09] prior to coming into the word and coming
[52:12] into the message my walk was almost
[52:15] always a respectable walk I did some
[52:18] things behind the scene that a lot of
[52:20] people don't know about things that I'm
[52:21] not proud of but for the most part I try
[52:23] to always be a leader I try to always be
[52:26] a teacher
[52:27] teacher um I try to always be that
[52:29] positive example for others you know if
[52:32] I had experiences that I could share
[52:34] that would help someone I tried to do
[52:36] that yeah all right so understand when
[52:39] you walk out of here today and you go to
[52:43] Walmart or you go to to Sonic or you go
[52:47] wherever that walk is what people see
[52:51] right all right I can be in Walmart
[52:54] looking for syrup I can see a gentleman
[52:57] or a lady down the aisle and sometimes
[52:59] and and I'm
[53:01] I'm I'm guessing or I'm I'm judging
[53:04] maybe but I can look and see and go man
[53:07] must be a Christian or I can have a
[53:09] conversation with when because I some of
[53:11] you know I'll talk to anybody I don't
[53:12] care I love talking to people I'm a
[53:14] coach I love talking right I'll talk to
[53:17] anyone but you start you engage in that
[53:18] conversation you immediately know if
[53:20] someone's a Christian all right so we're
[53:23] all walking
[53:24] Billboards nice we're we're all walking
[53:27] Billboards not necessarily by what we
[53:28] wear but could be by what we wear yeah
[53:32] yeah yes if you're not wearing the right
[53:34] thing people are going to look at you
[53:36] and go she ain't no Christian not
[53:38] wearing that I see your belly button
[53:40] what is she 12 why do I see her belly
[53:43] button her defense that baby doesn't
[53:46] know any better right that's on the
[53:49] parents right that's on the parents
[53:52] Brother Don has a story about his
[53:53] daughter playing uh running track
[53:57] which just I love that yeah cuz that's
[54:00] me I'm a track coach right but running
[54:02] track in a
[54:03] skirt being the only one out there
[54:05] running in a skirt you think people
[54:08] don't know she's a Christian come
[54:11] on my
[54:13] daughter playing
[54:15] soccer in a
[54:17] skirt I guarantee you if you looked at
[54:22] her you may not think she's a Christian
[54:25] come on J right but she's got that skirt
[54:28] on and I guarantee you that's that's got
[54:30] people thinking like why is that young
[54:31] lady wearing a skirt I bet she's a
[54:33] Christian okay we're walking Billboards
[54:36] remember that when you walk out of here
[54:37] you're representing the person sitting
[54:40] next to you you're representing the
[54:41] person behind you you're representing
[54:44] your parents you're representing brother
[54:48] Caleb you're representing Jesus Christ
[54:50] amen there it is all right there it is
[54:52] he has that trust in you to put you in
[54:54] that position that you're in so you can
[54:56] represent him that's his trust in you
[55:04] right all right I got some other stuff
[55:06] here but I know I'm running out of time
[55:07] so I'm not really going to hit on it um
[55:11] I sound like brother Caleb right now
[55:12] right I'm just going to skip through
[55:13] that
[55:15] um but if you go to Revelations
[55:21] 3:15 probably the favorite scripture of
[55:25] mine
[55:27] this would probably always be my
[55:29] favorite scripture Revelations 15 I'm
[55:32] sorry 3:15 and
[55:34] 16 verse 15 I Know Thy words that thou
[55:38] art neither cold nor hot why would thou
[55:41] worth cold or hot verse
[55:46] 16 so then because Thou Art
[55:50] lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will
[55:52] spew thee out of my mouth first time I
[55:55] ever heard that scripture I was sitting
[55:57] in the backs of the
[55:59] sanctuary
[56:01] during uh the devil virus time
[56:06] Co right nothing but the devil that's
[56:08] all that was that's not science that's
[56:10] not MediCal that's the devil that's all
[56:11] that was but I was sitting back there I
[56:13] heard that
[56:14] scripture and it struck me like a bolt
[56:16] of lightning boom it just hit me and I
[56:18] was just like out of breath I just felt
[56:22] something in my body I felt that
[56:25] tall I felt
[56:27] worthless I felt embarrassed because I
[56:30] knew and brother Caleb said that I knew
[56:34] he was talking about and I know we all
[56:35] feel convicted sometimes right we're
[56:38] hearing a message and go man how does he
[56:39] know that like no one knew I did
[56:43] that God knows right God knows God knows
[56:47] that day I needed that was my first trip
[56:50] out to Las crues well besides when I
[56:52] played softball but that was my first
[56:54] trip to Cedar Hills when I heard that
[56:57] scripture and that changed my life
[56:58] forever I will never be the same I don't
[57:01] want to be the same right I have trust
[57:04] and faith in the Lord that I will never
[57:07] be that person
[57:09] again and I try to show that to everyone
[57:11] I know my guys at work that I've worked
[57:14] with for 30 years God I'm old
[57:18] but when I I have conversations with
[57:20] them now and a lot of them I know
[57:22] they're curious so when we engage in
[57:25] conver conversations I try to share as
[57:27] much as I can with them without sharing
[57:29] too much sometimes because you might
[57:30] scare them away right or they say okay
[57:33] here he goes again preaching get up and
[57:35] get out of the kitchen right but I try
[57:37] to let them know but what's really cool
[57:39] is a lot of them will say oh brother I
[57:41] see the
[57:42] change I see your walk is
[57:44] different certain conversations I get up
[57:47] and walk out of the kitchen anymore fire
[57:48] station man we're good guys but brother
[57:51] let me tell
[57:53] you it's not a great environment
[57:55] sometimes
[58:56] smoke whatever I don't go back because I
[58:59] know that's not the place for me the
[59:01] Lord trust me to stay here and not to be
[59:03] out
[59:04] there am all right brother Brandon once
[59:08] said the great sacred trust was given to
[59:11] the bride of
[59:13] Christ but understand that that sacred
[59:16] trust for him to give us that sacred
[59:18] trust it has to go both
[59:20] ways that's how I see it it has to go
[59:22] both ways he can't just or we can't just
[59:26] have trust in him and then go do what we
[59:28] want to do and think okay the Lord's
[59:30] going to work it out I know I messed up
[59:32] Lord's going to work it out
[59:36] because when you you think you you can
[59:39] have that relationship with God and then
[59:40] you you
[59:42] backslide understand that yeah we can go
[59:44] to him and we can ask for forgiveness
[59:45] for what we did he hears us he's going
[59:49] to forgive us to see your forgetfulness
[59:52] that song I love that song to see your
[59:54] forget forgetfulness is gone
[59:57] but understand that that comes with some
[1:00:00] consequence all right now we got to work
[1:00:02] our we got to work our way back into
[1:00:04] that favor we never really lose the
[1:00:05] favor but understand okay the Lord's
[1:00:08] watching he sees what you're doing he
[1:00:10] hears what you're saying he sees where
[1:00:12] you're going all right so we have to
[1:00:14] make sure that we stay where we're
[1:00:16] supposed to stay in the
[1:00:18] Lord like Psalms
[1:00:21] 188 and I'm kind of bouncing all over
[1:00:23] the place right now but
[1:00:26] I want you guys to just understand man
[1:00:28] that premoral agency I remember when we
[1:00:31] learned that in Bible study and I'm just
[1:00:33] going to hit that real quick 100% free
[1:00:35] moral agency an understanding that you
[1:00:40] have the
[1:00:42] opportunity do whatever you want to do
[1:00:44] in
[1:00:45] life Lord's not going to stop
[1:00:49] you free
[1:00:50] will right Free
[1:00:54] Will is it perfect
[1:00:57] will free will perfect will there's a
[1:01:00] difference right you want to go
[1:01:02] experiment Lord's going to allow you to
[1:01:03] go
[1:01:04] experiment but that's not his perfect
[1:01:07] will all right so every single day our
[1:01:11] free moral agency we have to die out to
[1:01:13] our free moral agency every every single
[1:01:15] day we have to be free moral agents we
[1:01:17] have to die out every single day every
[1:01:20] day is a day of forgive uh forgiveness
[1:01:23] ask for forgiveness every because we're
[1:01:24] all doing something amen we may not
[1:01:27] think about it at the time but while
[1:01:28] we're driving we go oh I should have

[1:02:10] forgive me I didn't mean to do that all
[1:02:13] right Psalms

[1:09:31] need um a couple volunteers um I just
[1:09:35] need one for right
[1:09:37] now I will say a little bit of uh
[1:09:39] background about myself really quick I I
[1:09:41] told you guys a little bit about myself
[1:09:42] last time I was here um but when I was
[1:09:45] about your age those of you guys are
[1:09:46] still in high school I was 100%
[1:09:48] committed 100% sure that I was going to
[1:09:50] be a very famous actor and uh and uh
[1:09:54] y'all laugh but hey it paid for a little
[1:09:56] bit of my school I did get a college
[1:09:57] scholarship for for a little bit um and
[1:10:00] then I woke up one day and I uh I woke
[1:10:03] up one day you
[1:10:05] want and um I said I was walking to to
[1:10:10] the cafeteria to go get some food and I
[1:10:11] was like what on Earth am I going to do
[1:10:12] with the degree in theater and so I
[1:10:15] changed my major long story short I
[1:10:17] became a teacher um but one of the
[1:10:20] things that I took away from uh from all
[1:10:22] that act all those acting classes which
[1:10:23] I actually hated was the thing I hated
[1:10:25] the most was improv um and we're going
[1:10:27] to do a little bit of improv today um so
[1:10:30] I do need a volunteer um and I I pick
[1:10:34] you pal yeah come
[1:10:37] on so I I I did say he was going to
[1:10:39] volunteer but instead I he got volunt
[1:10:42] told and the reason why I I I picked him
[1:10:45] is because I I know him a little bit U I
[1:10:48] know a little bit of his uh his
[1:10:49] personality and I needed somebody with
[1:10:51] this Spirit right here okay so so here
[1:10:54] is the
[1:10:56] um here is the uh scenario all right I
[1:10:59] know who I know you live at home I know
[1:11:01] you live with your parents okay I know

[1:11:08] he called you on the phone he said hey
[1:11:10] mi you don't you don't drive right
[1:11:14] no you don't legally drive okay so he
[1:11:17] doesn't legally drive but we're going to
[1:11:19] pretend like he does because for this
[1:11:21] for the sake of this you're going to
[1:11:22] need to be able to get somewhere on your
[1:11:23] own let's say your dad called you up he
[1:11:25] said m i I bought some chicken
[1:11:28] sandwiches I need you to go down to the
[1:11:30] restaurant and pick them up because I'm

[1:11:35] pick up dinner so I need you to do that
[1:11:36] for me can you do that yeah you need to
[1:11:39] put the microphone to okay so he's going

[1:17:21] 20 and I'm going to just give him the

[1:26:02] up pretty quick it's a lot easier to do
[1:26:05] with your receipts um but but in the
[1:26:08] spiritual sense um it's very important
[1:26:10] to keep our receipts as well because
[1:26:13] there are certain things boys and girls
[1:26:15] that are already paid for and certain
[1:26:17] things that sometimes we are unwilling
[1:26:21] to stand our ground for and and accept
[1:26:24] and take what's already ours because our
[1:26:26] daddy did pay for it okay so if we could
[1:26:29] go on to the next slide here's what I
[1:26:30] want to show you I want to share
[1:26:32] something with you to hopefully help you
[1:26:34] out brother Caleb asked me to come over
[1:26:36] here and to Hype you guys up and I think
[1:26:37] he got the wrong guy because I'm not
[1:26:38] really like a hype man kind of guy
[1:26:41] that's more like brother Caleb Ali you
[1:26:42] know what I mean that's more like Seth
[1:26:44] and and Omar they their hype guys but
[1:26:46] I'm hoping that I put the word out there
[1:26:48] for you guys and maybe the word will
[1:26:50] hype you up a little bit okay so so what
[1:26:52] we are going to do right now is we are
[1:26:54] going to think what I want you to do is
[1:26:57] I want you to think about a problem that
[1:26:59] you have and I see a lot of people some
[1:27:01] some of you guys have notes and if you
[1:27:02] have somewhere to take notes um I want
[1:27:04] you to write it down and if you don't
[1:27:05] you can just write it write it down in
[1:27:07] in in your mind I want you to think
[1:27:09] about a problem that you had like Ezra
[1:27:11] had like Noah's had or Bo had excuse me
[1:27:14] and I want you to think about your
[1:27:16] hunger think about your desire to please
[1:27:20] your dad to go do what he asked you to
[1:27:22] do whatever whatever that that version
[1:27:24] of your problem is right now something
[1:27:28] that's that's ailing you think about
[1:27:31] what that problem is right now give you
[1:27:34] 10
[1:27:39] seconds so the mic made it very clear
[1:27:41] we're all battling some all the time
[1:27:44] maybe we're battling maybe our problem
[1:27:47] is lday by the time Tuesday hits around
[1:27:50] I kind of sometimes use bad language
[1:27:51] when I get around such and such a friend
[1:27:53] maybe our problem is is like well on
[1:27:55] Friday nights well usually I like to do
[1:27:57] this that and the other maybe our
[1:27:59] problem is well when nobody's looking
[1:28:01] here's what I like to do whatever is
[1:28:03] your problem you don't have to say it
[1:28:04] out loud I'm just get I I want you to
[1:28:06] think about that for one
[1:28:08] second and then what I want you to do is
[1:28:11] I want you to take that one word or that
[1:28:13] one little phrase that you wrote down
[1:28:14] and I want you to rewrite it underneath
[1:28:16] it in a sentence that says this never
[1:28:19] again will I confess whatever that
[1:28:21] problem is Right amen and and then we're
[1:28:24] going to piggyback off of what brother
[1:28:26] Caleb spoke yesterday and
[1:28:28] say I have hope
[1:28:32] because blank and then and then and then
[1:28:35] leave leave the blank empty for now and
[1:28:38] remember what brother Caleb told us
[1:28:39] yesterday he said that hope hope the the
[1:28:42] definition the actual definition of hope
[1:28:45] is to have high expectations to have
[1:28:48] trust to have confidence to anticipate
[1:28:51] with great pleasure an expectation with
[1:28:54] the guarantee okay so that guarantee
[1:28:57] part again if you come and you purchase
[1:28:59] something it is guaranteed that whatever
[1:29:03] it is that you purchase when you can
[1:29:04] prove it that you are you should be
[1:29:06] expected to receive that good or that
[1:29:09] service right it would be unjust for me
[1:29:12] to for example order a couch and then go
[1:29:15] pick up said couch and then say I'm
[1:29:17] sorry well I don't make that couch
[1:29:20] anymore it why is it unjust because I
[1:29:22] have the invoice you can see that it's
[1:29:24] paid and full I fully expect that you
[1:29:27] are going to give me that cou
[1:29:30] right funny story this is this is true
[1:29:33] one day I ordered a
[1:29:35] couch I went to pick up the couch and I
[1:29:38] got to the place and the lady's like
[1:29:40] yeah
[1:29:41] well uh I'm sorry uh the couch isn't
[1:29:44] here I was like okay that's that's
[1:29:46] that's fine you told me two weeks ago
[1:29:49] when I was supposed to pick up my couch
[1:29:50] two weeks ago that the couch wasn't here
[1:29:52] you told me that it would be here today
[1:29:54] I expect my couch
[1:29:56] today I love and they said well sir the
[1:29:59] couch isn't here I was like well I don't
[1:30:01] know where it is but you better get it
[1:30:03] here and they're like well sir and let
[1:30:05] me talk to the manager so they she she
[1:30:07] walked away she comes back and she goes
[1:30:09] oh I know why the couch isn't here sir
[1:30:11] like okay like it's because we don't
[1:30:13] make that couch anymore wow I like okay
[1:30:17] I don't care right I don't care if y'all
[1:30:21] make that couch anymore I bought that
[1:30:23] couch when you did make it and I fully
[1:30:27] expect that you are going to have that
[1:30:29] couch here for me today because two
[1:30:32] weeks ago I was here you told me to wait
[1:30:33] two more weeks I waited two weeks and
[1:30:35] I'm tired of sitting on the floor
[1:30:39] yeah so she's like okay excuse me sir
[1:30:42] let me get uh let let me make a phone
[1:30:52] call and
[1:31:08] okay okay okay
[1:31:12] okay hello sir and I said
[1:31:23] no
[1:31:26] and she
[1:31:29] [Applause]
[1:31:32] goes first of all you see an invoice
[1:31:35] with somebody's name is Garcia just
[1:31:36] assume
[1:31:37] yeah you just assume everybody's not
[1:31:40] brother Caleb Duron around here some of
[1:31:42] us do speak
[1:31:44] Spanish so she incorrectly assumed that
[1:31:47] I wouldn't speak Spanish she said all
[1:31:49] this right so here's what happened
[1:31:51] here's what happened a truck
[1:31:55] uh like a little little datson pickup
[1:31:57] truck with some Sonora license plates
[1:32:00] came screeching around the corner about
[1:32:01] 20 minutes later with my couch right
[1:32:05] with an ottoman on top of it that was
[1:32:08] given to me for free and with a check
[1:32:11] for 200 bucks for the
[1:32:13] inconvenience why because I had a little
[1:32:16] bit of righteous indignation and I said
[1:32:19] look I don't like to create a problem
[1:32:21] two weeks ago when I was supposed to get
[1:32:23] it I you I I expected it it wasn't there
[1:32:26] I gave you some Grace here I am I want
[1:32:28] it now and I refused to say who can I
[1:32:31] buy another count yeah right I refuse to
[1:32:34] say well I don't know like maybe I can
[1:32:37] uh come back in two weeks and maybe
[1:32:40] you'll have it no why because the
[1:32:43] righteous indignation stood up Rose up
[1:32:47] and you know what at some point you just
[1:32:48] expect what's rightfully coming to you
[1:32:51] you expect what is already paid for to
[1:32:53] be given to you and it would be unjust
[1:32:56] it would have been unjust for that
[1:32:57] company not to have given me that couch
[1:33:00] that I paid for that was paid for
[1:33:03] already right so here's what we're going
[1:33:05] to do you're going to rewrite that
[1:33:07] sentence or do it in your brain or do it
[1:33:09] on your paper and you're going to say
[1:33:10] never again will I
[1:33:13] confess that I cuss never again will I
[1:33:16] confess that I'm a drunk never again
[1:33:19] will I confess that I have anxiety never
[1:33:23] again will I confess that I am Unworthy
[1:33:26] of of the Gospel never again will I
[1:33:29] confess whatever problem that you have
[1:33:31] that you suffer with only you know
[1:33:32] you're going to say I have hope because
[1:33:35] and then we're going to fill in some
[1:33:36] blanks in a minute do that in your brain
[1:33:40] if you don't have it if you do have
[1:33:41] notes do it with you right now can we go
[1:33:43] to the next slide please I'm going to
[1:33:45] give you an
[1:33:46] example never again will I confess I
[1:33:49] can't this is an easy one for us to do I
[1:33:52] have hope that I can because I can do
[1:33:55] all things through Christ who
[1:33:56] strengthens me Philippians 4:13 let me
[1:33:59] tell you something Philippians 4:13 is
[1:34:01] my receipt anytime the devil tries to
[1:34:05] tell me that I can't actually yes I can
[1:34:09] you know why because my daddy already
[1:34:11] purchased it and my daddy gave me the
[1:34:12] receipt it's right here okay so this is
[1:34:15] exactly why we went through this
[1:34:17] scenario why so you can see if your
[1:34:19] righteous indignation can rise up for a
[1:34:21] chicken sandwich then it should be able
[1:34:24] to rise up for these things that are
[1:34:25] written in here for all these receipts
[1:34:28] that you have for you let's go to
[1:34:29] another one never again will I confess
[1:34:32] addiction do I have a receipt for
[1:34:34] addiction boys and
[1:34:35] girls amen do I have a receipt for
[1:34:38] addiction up there do I have a receipt
[1:34:41] for overcoming
[1:34:42] addiction I have hope because where the
[1:34:46] spirit of the Lord is there is liberty
[1:34:49] so I am no longer going to confess
[1:34:51] addiction do you know why because
[1:34:53] Liberty I have the receipt for my
[1:34:56] freedom already never again will I
[1:34:58] confess addiction because I have hope
[1:35:01] because who he whom the sun set free is
[1:35:04] free indeed there is my receipt right
[1:35:06] there John 8:36 let's go to the next one
[1:35:09] we're going to do one more never again
[1:35:11] will I confess anxiety this is a big one
[1:35:14] this is a big one and I I I hear it too
[1:35:16] much it's because I suffer with anxiety
[1:35:18] I suffer with anxiety and I'm not
[1:35:20] telling you that you don't but what I am
[1:35:22] telling you is you have a receipt for it
[1:35:25] and if your righteous indignation will
[1:35:27] stand up you can have your freedom from
[1:35:30] your anxiety and here are your receipts
[1:35:32] I have hope a guarantee that the anxiety
[1:35:36] is gone why because I am casting all my
[1:35:38] cares upon Him who cares for me there's
[1:35:40] one receipt I left you three because we
[1:35:43] talk about this too much I never again
[1:35:45] will I confess anxiety I have a
[1:35:47] guarantee that I don't have anxiety
[1:35:49] because he said my peace I leave with
[1:35:51] you my peace I give unto you you I do
[1:35:54] not give as the world gives here is your
[1:35:58] diagnosis for your anxiety I do not give
[1:36:01] as the world gives do not let your
[1:36:03] hearts be troubled and do not be afraid
[1:36:05] that's John 14:27 and here's my favorite
[1:36:08] one and this is an NIV version like Mike
[1:36:10] said because it helps us a little bit
[1:36:11] more and it's written differently than
[1:36:13] it is in King James never again will I
[1:36:16] confess anxiety I have a guarantee
[1:36:19] because when anxiety was great within me
[1:36:22] your consolation brought me
[1:36:25] joy these these are our receipts now if
[1:36:29] you go to the next slide I I I know all
[1:36:31] of us don't have our phone I created a
[1:36:34] list I I got you started with 25
[1:36:37] receipts for some of the problems that
[1:36:38] we have if you go ahead and scan that I
[1:36:40] know it's kind of irregular but if you
[1:36:41] go ahead and scan that it's listed on
[1:36:43] there you'll be on there as viewer only
[1:36:45] okay if you request access to it and you
[1:36:48] have a receipt for something that's not
[1:36:50] on
[1:36:51] there will you please request access and
[1:36:54] help us keep a list and then we can keep
[1:36:56] it there and then anytime that we are
[1:36:58] struggling with something anytime Church
[1:37:00] filet or devil filet or whoever sends
[1:37:03] you away and says you know what if you
[1:37:04] don't have your ID if you don't have a
[1:37:06] receipt then you don't get what you have
[1:37:09] already purchased it'll be right there
[1:37:11] for us it'll be easy somewhere that we
[1:37:12] can easily look up if you have a Mac you
[1:37:14] press you press crlf and then you can
[1:37:16] find whatever problem that you have just
[1:37:18] by searching it okay and so so again
[1:37:22] please understand if if you're willing
[1:37:24] to have some righteous indignation over
[1:37:26] a chicken sandwich if you're willing to
[1:37:29] have some righteous indignation over a
[1:37:30] sofa how about our healing how about our
[1:37:33] salvation and remember remember that
[1:37:36] sometimes when we have that indignation
[1:37:37] and we come and we demand our
[1:37:39] chicken sometimes that chicken will be
[1:37:41] ready right away you get it instantly
[1:37:45] and sometimes you might have to stand
[1:37:48] there and wait for them to cook up that
[1:37:49] chicken sandwich and we're using a
[1:37:51] metaphor you understand right but
[1:37:53] sometimes when you're are waiting for
[1:37:54] your deliverance from anxiety sometimes
[1:37:56] when you're waiting for your deliverance
[1:37:58] from sickness sometimes that chicken
[1:38:00] sandwich will come right away and it'll
[1:38:02] be instant I've seen it my son was sick
[1:38:05] one day for two days in a row sick sick
[1:38:07] sick sick sick couldn't eat had a fever
[1:38:10] all day long he was lethargic and it was

[1:38:18] took him to we took him to the to the to
[1:38:21] the minister and what did the minister
[1:38:22] do he prayed for him he pulled out the
[1:38:26] receipt he said Lay Your Hands on the

[1:38:29] the receipt and what
[1:38:33] happened chicken sandwich came to him
