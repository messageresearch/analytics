[43:36] Jesus amen and amen you may be seated
[43:42] I'm going to ask the gentleman you could
[43:44] go ahead I have a short short video a
[43:46] couple minutes we're going to play
[43:47] before
[43:50] sets the the foundation for the small
[43:52] thoughts
[43:56] you guys go ahead
[44:06] the sun
[44:08] gives us warmth and light
[44:13] it is the fuel of life
[44:16] without the energy of the sun almost
[44:18] nothing grows thrives lives
[44:23] son is a monster
[44:27] a Planet Killer
[44:32] and we don't see that side of the sun
[44:34] down here
[44:37] but eight astronauts with over a
[44:40] thousand days in space between them can
[44:43] show us how being up there
[44:47] help them understand the sun's bright
[44:49] Fury
[44:52] [Music]
[44:54] it's got an incredible amount of power
[44:57] which you really appreciate when you go
[44:59] out in Space the sun can give life and
[45:02] it can destroy life
[45:05] given the amount of radiation from the
[45:08] Sun there shouldn't be life on the
[45:09] surface of the Earth
[45:11] we shouldn't be here
[45:13] the Earth Shields us in a suit of armor
[45:17] [Music]
[45:19] and the way she does it
[45:21] but that's not all
[45:24] these molten insides are full of iron
[45:27] and nickel
[45:33] Rising falling spinning
[45:36] constantly Melting Furnace
[45:41] and all that churning metal creates its
[45:45] own magnetic field
[45:49] [Music]
[45:57] [Music]
[46:01] this magnetic field stretches as far as
[46:03] 400
[46:05] 000 miles into space
[46:11] surrounding the entire planet
[46:16] it is a massive force field
[46:21] and it helps deflect the deadly
[46:23] radiation
[46:25] that destroyed Mars
[46:39] for the most part our magnetic field is
[46:42] invisible
[46:45] but when the sun flares up we get to see
[46:48] it in action
[46:50] we call it the Aurora
[46:54] pretty much on everyone's bucket list
[46:56] but in space
[46:58] see it in an entirely different way
[47:02] [Applause]
[47:04] [Music]
[47:06] I saw this green clothes almost like a
[47:10] person dancing it was this shape of
[47:13] these forearms that were moving as we
[47:16] went over
[47:21] the leaves
[47:23] and all of them
[47:24] all of the colors
[47:26] enormous
[47:27] ghost of a curtain
[47:30] a curtain
[47:33] you're not just seeing it with your eyes
[47:36] you're you're feeling it you're feeling
[47:38] it with your heart as well it's
[47:40] it's a part of you
[47:43] [Music]
[47:49] when we look down at the Aurora
[47:51] all the more beautiful
[47:53] because we know that we're looking at
[47:55] our planet keeping us safe from the Sun
[48:06] [Applause]
[48:08] UV radiation breaks down DNA
[48:12] turns healthy cells cancers
[48:16] we were hit by the full force of the sun
[48:19] plants would be sterilized
[48:23] microscopic life would be sterilized
[48:28] life couldn't be sustained on the
[48:30] surface of the Earth
[48:39] [Music]
[48:41] Sun yes
[48:47] just when you thought you were somebody
[48:51] after watching that
[48:54] none of us should even be here
[48:56] [Music]
[48:59] anybody know what the Aurora is
[49:03] this one's for you
[49:07] also known as the Northern Lights
[49:12] how many have seen the Northern Lights
[49:15] how many have seen him from space
[49:27] amen this this Aurora light or the
[49:30] Northern Lights
[49:31] Del Norte
[49:33] there's this uh happens usually through
[49:37] March through April
[49:39] it is
[49:41] and September through October
[49:46] and I could go into detail of the
[49:49] particles and ions and all that but to
[49:51] save time
[49:56] the number one place to view the
[49:59] Northern Lights
[50:03] majority of people would say Alaska
[50:06] in Alaska but the number one place is
[50:09] known as the heart of the Aurora
[50:13] principals
[50:15] and that that's found in tromoso Norway
[50:19] yes
[50:22] I don't think it's it's by coincidence
[50:24] that that's where our brother martin our
[50:26] brother brothers and sisters are in
[50:28] there in Norway
[50:36] is brother Branham
[50:39] so we see him in the circle bow of green
[50:46] amber color
[50:48] um
[50:51] this greenish what what does green
[50:54] represent
[50:56] life
[50:57] green is is the Evergreen always stays
[51:00] green
[51:01] what does it mean
[51:05] that God has promised
[51:08] and he took a oath back there in Genesis
[51:12] another message he says follow the
[51:14] compass uh
[51:23] he says I was standing there in the
[51:26] North Pole a few years ago
[51:29] the Northern Lights sweeping yes
[51:34] and he says
[51:36] anywhere that Compass will point right
[51:39] straight to that magnetic pole
[51:43] is
[51:46] it'll guide you North every time
[51:52] and he says it will Point towards Jesus
[51:55] Christ
[51:57] just as certain as I'm sitting in this
[52:00] church today
[52:04] now I'm just going to tell tell a little
[52:06] little story those of you who have who
[52:08] have read it in in messages and the life
[52:11] story
[52:15] The the life story uh has a little bit
[52:18] more details
[52:21] as I told Brother Carlos I'll bring the
[52:24] wood and you bring the fire
[52:26] Bros
[52:29] so brother Bradham is in Toledo Ohio
[52:32] in Toledo Ohio he just finished uh he's
[52:36] preaching five consecutive nights
[52:42] five nights in a row
[52:45] it's the peak of Summer yes
[52:50] about 80 to 100 degrees
[52:53] and about 70 percent humidity
[52:57] and he preaches five nights in a row
[53:00] like this is
[53:04] anybody who is who's ever been uh on the
[53:08] east east coast you know the humidity is
[53:10] is nasty
[53:14] so brother uh I think I believe his
[53:17] brother Ern Baxter uh tells brother
[53:19] Brandon I'll I'll go ahead and preach
[53:21] for you tonight brother Branham and you
[53:23] could get some rest
[53:28] so brother Brown says yes I'll I'll
[53:31] thank you I'll take that rest for for
[53:33] time to pray and and prepare for the
[53:35] next the next service
[53:41] so around noon time brother Branham gets
[53:43] hungry
[53:47] so he he goes to the restaurant where
[53:50] he's been eating restaurant
[53:53] and it's closed yesterday so he goes
[53:57] across the street sees another
[53:58] restaurant
[54:01] and as soon as he walks in
[54:05] he can't believe his eyes
[54:08] he sees a police officer with his arm
[54:11] around a girl
[54:15] putting coins into a slot
[54:18] Machina and brother Branham is is is he
[54:22] can't believe his eyes
[54:24] because at that time gambling was
[54:26] illegal in Ohio
[54:30] he looks to this side Mira is a young
[54:34] girl about 18 years old
[54:38] and uh she's got alcohol in her hand
[54:42] and there's there's two young boys with
[54:44] her okay
[54:46] and they're they're uh really Brandon
[54:49] puts it he they're fawning over her yeah
[54:59] staring at her and
[55:04] they like her
[55:06] now you know
[55:09] and anyways so he uh
[55:12] he he
[55:16] says this this little girl ought to be
[55:17] in church
[55:20] he looks to his other side
[55:23] and he sees an elderly woman
[55:29] with two elderly men on those Hombres
[55:32] now the way he puts it is
[55:34] he says that that's some that's
[55:36] somebody's Grandma there yeah
[55:38] she's about 65 years old
[55:42] she's got blue hair
[55:44] she's got blue eyeshadow uh
[55:56] somebody's grandma
[56:00] hello
[56:01] hola
[56:03] and he's he's in disgust and he says is
[56:06] this is this the world that Rebecca and
[56:08] Sarah have to be raised in yeah
[56:15] he was disgusted
[56:17] then all of a sudden
[56:21] the Lord comes down
[56:24] whether Bantam goes in the corner yeah
[56:28] he sees a vision
[56:30] he sees the world turning
[56:35] this is what he's what he sees yes
[56:39] he sees a red streak going around the
[56:41] whole world
[56:45] he sees Jesus standing there Jesus tells
[56:49] them this the Crimson covers the blood
[56:52] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[56:57] died to save Sinners
[57:00] that is the reason God can't destroy
[57:03] these people is
[57:06] they still have a chance
[57:09] every Mortal being has the right to
[57:12] accept their salvation
[57:16] until the day they die and go beyond
[57:18] that blood
[57:21] if they die without accepting it
[57:25] they are already judged
[57:28] but as long as they're alive
[57:31] they have a right to the tree of life
[57:34] if they will accept it
[57:38] and all of a sudden he sees Jesus taking
[57:41] hits
[57:44] taking hits and he says I believe I'll
[57:48] go closer and see what it is
[57:51] and Jesus says
[57:54] he tells brother Branham Jesus
[57:56] the jerks are caused by the slaps of
[57:59] your sins
[58:04] this is to the prophet where does that
[58:06] leave us
[58:09] and brother brother in life story says
[58:15] he uh he he said surely Lord that I I
[58:18] didn't do that
[58:23] and then he sees Jesus say eBay Jesus
[58:26] every time the sins would hit Jesus
[58:30] Jesus he would say father forgive them
[58:34] forgive him he don't know what he's
[58:36] doing
[58:37] even though you might think you know
[58:39] what you're doing
[58:42] if the holy spirit is not not not
[58:45] guiding you
[58:47] and and Jesus is not resurrected in you
[58:51] Jesus
[58:53] you don't really know what you're doing
[58:56] you might think you know
[58:59] but you don't know brother Bill he sees
[59:03] words on a book
[59:07] and he gets closer to read it
[59:10] his brother Brandon's book is
[59:13] condemned
[59:15] and brother Brandon can't handle it he's
[59:18] shaking he goes to the feet of the Lord
[59:19] Jesus
[59:23] Jesus and he says forgive me I beg of
[59:25] you it is
[59:27] and Jesus gets his fingers and dips him
[59:30] in his side he Jesus Thomas
[59:34] and his fingers across the cover of the
[59:36] book it is
[59:40] and he writes pardoned it is
[59:43] and he throws the book behind him
[59:46] and he says I forgave you but you want
[59:48] to condemn these people
[59:51] oh come on
[59:53] vamos Iglesias
[59:55] and he says you're forgiven but what
[59:57] about her it is
[1:00:00] talking about the old lady
[1:00:03] he says she needs the gospel too
[1:00:07] brother Branham comes too
[1:00:10] and he's got a different Outlook now
[1:00:14] he walks over to the old old woman
[1:00:20] may I sit with you in in and talk to you
[1:00:25] she goes I got company already
[1:00:30] he says I didn't mean it like that man
[1:00:32] yeah this is
[1:00:38] her attitude changed after that
[1:00:42] so he begins to talk to her and he says
[1:00:44] I condemned you in my heart and and he
[1:00:46] tells her about the vision he just had
[1:00:47] them
[1:00:50] and you can start putting those those
[1:00:53] pictures up
[1:00:57] so he tells her what he what what he
[1:00:59] sees the forgiveness
[1:01:04] and uh she she starts telling brother
[1:01:06] random her testimony
[1:01:10] and then she says Branham he said
[1:01:14] you're not the one holding that Revival
[1:01:16] here are you
[1:01:19] yes ma'am that's me
[1:01:21] she said I've been wanting to go down
[1:01:23] but but I just I just couldn't bring
[1:01:25] myself to it
[1:01:26] [Music]
[1:01:28] she knew where she got off the off the
[1:01:30] right path and got back on the wrong
[1:01:32] path
[1:01:36] brother Bradham is seeing here yes
[1:01:40] from Earth the lights look a lot
[1:01:42] different
[1:01:45] but as you can see there's the green and
[1:01:48] there's the red going around the whole
[1:01:49] world
[1:01:53] all that a prophet the prophet had seen
[1:01:58] has and will come to pass
[1:02:01] and for the first time here astronauts
[1:02:04] are seeing it
[1:02:06] and to close here Brother Carlos gets
[1:02:08] ready
[1:02:10] tell her sister I don't care what you've
[1:02:12] done
[1:02:15] the blood of Jesus Christ is still
[1:02:17] around you
[1:02:20] the world is covered over with his blood
[1:02:24] and it's protecting you
[1:02:27] from the wrath of God
[1:02:30] and someday when the breath leaves your
[1:02:32] body
[1:02:34] your soul will go out
[1:02:37] and you'll go beyond this world to a
[1:02:39] place that blood won't do you any good
[1:02:41] yeah
[1:02:44] there will be nothing but judgment
[1:02:47] and while you still got a chance
[1:02:51] accept it accept it accept the pardon
[1:02:54] accepted Jesus will forgive you and and
[1:02:58] save you Jesus
[1:03:17] she says do you think he'll have me yeah
[1:03:22] absolutely he'll have you absolutely
[1:03:25] will you pray that I could be saved
[1:03:28] and right there in that Diner
[1:03:31] now together in parade
[1:03:34] until the woman accepted her salvation
[1:03:39] brother Branham stands up
[1:03:42] he sees the policeman removed his hat
[1:03:46] and he also was kneeling down in respect
[1:03:50] his brother Bradham left the restaurant
[1:03:54] he thought that's right yes don't
[1:03:57] condemn them
[1:03:59] give them the gospel
[1:04:02] there's always got to be death before
[1:04:05] life
[1:04:07] that's the only way that brings life is
[1:04:15] none of us should be here
[1:04:18] that's what keeps the wrath of God from
[1:04:21] destroying us yes
[1:04:24] because when he looks down what does he
[1:04:27] see
[1:04:28] so your sins be a Scarlet
[1:04:45] God bless you
[1:04:48] [Applause]
[1:05:17] we find this this evening
[1:05:21] that we serve a good God is that right
[1:05:27] and and because this is a a young
[1:05:30] people's service you guys knew it was a
[1:05:31] young people's service right
[1:05:34] it's it's aimed at the young people
[1:05:36] right so so how many young people I got
[1:05:38] tonight
[1:05:40] all right we got a whole bunch of young
[1:05:42] people yeah man story Lori thank you
[1:05:47] Lord amen amen all right so so we have a
[1:05:51] good God right
[1:05:53] and we all know that God is a good god
[1:05:58] and that's a good thing to know yes
[1:06:02] but we heard this morning something
[1:06:05] tremendous
[1:06:07] and about about a quarter of the way
[1:06:09] through my uncle Tommy's message
[1:06:14] I got kind of nervous because he started
[1:06:17] preaching my message
[1:06:20] but I thought to myself as
[1:07:01] you see like we heard this morning
[1:07:05] we know that God is good
[1:07:08] and and we know certain things about the
[1:07:11] message
[1:07:13] and we know certain things about brother
[1:07:15] Brandon
[1:07:17] and we know great things about our our
[1:07:20] founding pastor
[1:07:30] of a bunch of different identities
[1:07:34] right we we when I was in high school
[1:07:37] preparatoria I remember
[1:07:40] there was like two or three groups that
[1:07:43] you could identify as
[1:07:45] grupos
[1:07:47] we had the cool kids
[1:07:50] and then you had the not cool kids
[1:07:55] and that was about it yes and then as
[1:07:59] time went on a little bit
[1:08:02] I remember my kids and they were in
[1:08:06] school and there's like the Emos
[1:08:09] and then there was the glass
[1:08:14] they're called the gods cause they
[1:08:16] impressed all
[1:08:18] blacks
[1:08:20] and then you have you have the jocks the
[1:08:24] guys who do all the sports
[1:08:26] and then you got the Nerds nerds right
[1:08:30] and then we thought that was like a
[1:08:33] whole bunch of different identities
[1:08:36] but now you guys
[1:08:39] now you guys live in a world
[1:08:42] where there's hundreds
[1:08:46] if not thousands of different identities
[1:08:50] of every shape
[1:08:53] every color
[1:08:54] every size
[1:08:57] and every difference in mix and match in
[1:09:00] the middle
[1:09:02] and somehow or another
[1:09:05] the young people of this day
[1:09:10] are expected to figure out
[1:09:16] who they are
[1:09:19] they live in a world even in a mundo
[1:09:22] where you can identify as anything
[1:09:27] I wake up today
[1:09:29] and I choose what I want to be
[1:09:33] I would like to identify today
[1:09:38] as a brontosaurus
[1:09:41] that was my boy saying people you could
[1:09:44] identify as a brontosaurus
[1:09:48] I'm a quail today
[1:09:51] and I remember that we me and my wife
[1:09:54] went to a place it's Austin Texas
[1:09:58] and that was the worst anointing I've
[1:10:01] ever felt in my entire life
[1:10:05] because in a place like Austin Texas
[1:10:08] Austin Texas you can walk down the
[1:10:11] street as a brontosaurus
[1:10:15] and nobody will bat an eye
[1:10:32] nobody looks at you weird
[1:10:36] but my question to you young people
[1:10:40] my question for you this evening
[1:10:46] is what do you identify as
[1:10:53] when I ask you the question what do you
[1:10:55] identify as
[1:10:59] maybe the maybe the answer comes back
[1:11:05] well I'm I'm I'm so-and-so
[1:11:09] but the most common one you're going to
[1:11:11] hear
[1:11:14] especially if I ask you in here is
[1:11:20] Cristiano
[1:11:23] and we identify as a
[1:11:28] Christiano but you notice the question
[1:11:33] that always goes out
[1:11:36] is always the question
[1:11:40] of what
[1:11:43] do you identify as yes
[1:11:46] and you see young people here's the
[1:11:49] problem
[1:11:50] because when you approach your identity
[1:11:53] what
[1:12:01] it creates a whole bunch of problems
[1:12:05] it's like when you say to be baptized in
[1:12:09] the name of Father Son and Holy ghosts
[1:12:16] so when you ask what do you identify
[1:12:23] that's the reason that a large majority
[1:12:25] of the world when you ask people who are
[1:12:27] transgender is
[1:12:37] a woman
[1:12:41] okay what the woman
[1:12:44] but you see you can't identify
[1:12:48] what okay without the characteristics
[1:12:52] because
[1:12:58] once you get the characteristics
[1:13:03] that define the thing
[1:13:06] the question changes
[1:13:09] and it's no more why
[1:13:16] so if I asked you the question
[1:13:19] what do you identify as
[1:13:22] and you say I'm a Christian
[1:13:25] Cristiano then my next question to you
[1:13:27] will be is
[1:13:29] that like on Wednesdays is
[1:13:33] that just like on Sundays
[1:13:36] because what
[1:13:39] is not who you are
[1:13:43] what okay is what you do
[1:13:47] and that's why the world is twisted up
[1:13:52] people want to be what they want to be
[1:14:23] and we find Jesus Christ
[1:14:26] it's an easy answer we're Christians
[1:14:30] okay what does it mean
[1:14:32] what does it mean to be a Christian
[1:14:34] Cristiano
[1:14:36] anybody what does it mean significa to
[1:14:40] be like Christo
[1:14:42] what does that mean s
[1:14:45] what does it mean
[1:14:48] who who is he NSL
[1:14:52] who is he
[1:14:55] do you know his characteristics
[1:14:59] do you know what he does
[1:15:02] do you know all the things that there
[1:15:05] are to know about him
[1:15:08] then how do we be a who
[1:15:12] without understanding all of his
[1:15:14] characteristics
[1:15:17] so to understand his characteristics
[1:15:21] we have to go way way way back
[1:15:26] we find in the Book of Matthew
[1:15:29] chapter 16.
[1:15:32] and verse 14 is
[1:15:35] and I'm just going to read verse 15.
[1:15:38] because I want you to notice how Jesus
[1:15:41] asks his disciples
[1:15:46] Jesus and he saith unto them
[1:15:52] but what say ye that I am
[1:15:59] no right that's why when some said well
[1:16:02] you're a prophet
[1:16:04] no that's a what well you're you're
[1:16:07] maybe a Mighty Man
[1:16:18] yo sorry
[1:16:20] you notice that no no all right so when
[1:16:24] when we figure out we need to figure out
[1:16:27] we need to figure out who he is
[1:16:32] and to understand that
[1:16:34] we go all the way to the Book of
[1:16:37] Revelation
[1:16:39] apocalypses and we find out in the Book
[1:16:41] of Revelations chapter one apocalypse
[1:16:45] oh and this is such a tremendous book it
[1:16:48] and everybody gets scared of this book
[1:16:52] and and the book starts out
[1:16:57] with a tremendous statement
[1:17:02] because it tells you
[1:17:04] said what this book is all about
[1:17:09] and it tells you say that it is a
[1:17:13] revelation it is
[1:17:16] so we we find out
[1:17:20] in order to understand the who is
[1:17:24] we have to have an apocalypse
[1:17:32] give me all looking at me like it's the
[1:17:34] end of the world
[1:17:36] do you know what the word apocalypse
[1:17:39] means
[1:17:42] the unveiling
[1:17:44] it has to be revealed
[1:17:47] right and the only way it can be
[1:17:49] revealed
[1:17:51] is if you study the words
[1:17:54] because you gotta find out
[1:17:58] because that's what defines you is
[1:18:05] the book starts out the revelation of
[1:18:07] Jesus Christ
[1:18:10] which God gave unto him
[1:18:13] oh my and then let's go down to the book
[1:18:16] to chapter four
[1:18:17] I'm sorry verse four apologize chapter
[1:18:21] one and verse
[1:18:23] and I want you to notice this here
[1:18:27] John to the seven churches
[1:18:32] Grace be unto you and peace from him
[1:18:35] which is
[1:18:37] and which was and which is
[1:18:43] and from the seven spirits
[1:18:47] which are before his throne
[1:18:50] now I want you guys to notice these
[1:18:54] seven spirits
[1:18:56] and I know that I know that it sounds a
[1:18:59] little bit deep okay
[1:19:03] but I know you guys can get this
[1:19:07] because when we were in youth we covered
[1:19:10] some crazy stuff right
[1:19:15] so these these seven spirits that were
[1:19:17] Before the Throne
[1:19:21] these Spirits are the seven spirits of
[1:19:24] God
[1:19:26] they're Before the Throne
[1:19:29] but when John sees him he's on the Isle
[1:19:32] of
[1:19:32] passed
[1:19:34] and these Spirits they begin to unfold
[1:19:37] themselves and John can see them coming
[1:19:48] John sees something called
[1:19:53] the seven that give names
[1:19:59] who's heard of that
[1:20:02] the seven names of Jehovah
[1:20:05] who can name me one who's got one
[1:20:10] we sang the song this morning who's got
[1:20:12] one
[1:20:14] what is it
[1:20:17] Jehovah jirehobachide right correct so
[1:20:21] what are these seven spirits what are
[1:20:23] these seven Redemptive names have to do
[1:20:25] with anything
[1:20:28] because when you realize
[1:20:31] those seven names
[1:20:34] are the descriptors
[1:20:37] of who Jesus Christ is
[1:20:41] they're his characteristics
[1:20:45] came from the throne
[1:20:47] they came to John
[1:20:50] they were so that they could come to
[1:20:52] brother Brown
[1:20:54] not that they could be revealed to each
[1:20:56] and every one of you
[1:20:59] so that when they ask who are you
[1:21:03] you'll know who you are
[1:21:06] when they say who is Jesus Jesus oh
[1:21:11] that's easy
[1:21:12] he's Jehovah
[1:21:16] foreign
[1:21:57] see how once you start to understand it
[1:22:01] it all ties together
[1:22:05] because each one of those Messengers
[1:22:09] they brought apart
[1:22:11] they brought apart
[1:22:14] of the revelation of Jesus
[1:22:17] Christ and it's a revelation of Jesus
[1:22:20] Christ
[1:22:22] for each and every one of you
[1:22:25] it's him unfolding
[1:22:28] all of his glory oh that's the Gloria to
[1:22:32] you guys
[1:22:33] it's him taking all of his
[1:22:36] mysteriousness
[1:22:39] breaking it down through seven messages
[1:22:48] so that you can understand
[1:22:51] that the answer to your question
[1:22:56] is not what
[1:22:58] yo it's who am I
[1:23:04] so when they ask you
[1:23:07] what are you okay well I'm a Christian
[1:23:11] Cristiano
[1:23:13] then be a Christian does it sound
[1:23:16] Christiano as who
[1:23:18] not as what
[1:23:21] because when you're a Christian
[1:23:25] that means that the life that was in
[1:23:28] Jesus Christ
[1:23:34] when you're a Christian as what
[1:23:38] it's just a part-time job
[1:23:41] it's a part-time occupation
[1:23:45] it's a job with minimal commitment
[1:23:51] but when you become Christianity you're
[1:23:54] a Christian
[1:23:59] it's because there's a revelation
[1:24:03] when you plan your life
[1:24:06] when you think about your future
[1:24:09] don't get caught up in the what no
[1:24:12] saying
[1:24:14] being a Christian is who you are
[1:24:19] it's not what you are
[1:24:22] and that's where a lot of the mistakes
[1:24:24] get made
[1:24:26] that's where we as many as many times as
[1:24:29] as even older younger people
[1:24:35] do you see what I did there
[1:24:38] right older younger people
[1:24:43] we make our mistakes
[1:24:45] we become
[1:24:48] what we are and no que somos
[1:24:51] I'm a business owner so you um
[1:24:59] and that becomes our identity
[1:25:03] that becomes our life
[1:25:06] that becomes what we are
[1:25:08] what we do becomes what we are
[1:25:12] but that's not who we are
[1:25:16] our goals should always be
[1:25:20] to go back to who we are
[1:25:25] because I'm a Son of God
[1:25:28] how many sons of God
[1:25:31] how many daughters of God
[1:25:35] that is who you are
[1:25:38] you are a part of Jesus Christ
[1:25:43] you represent his life
[1:25:46] so when you conduct yourself on a
[1:25:49] day-to-day basis
[1:25:52] you don't conduct yourself from a
[1:25:54] standpoint of what am I because
