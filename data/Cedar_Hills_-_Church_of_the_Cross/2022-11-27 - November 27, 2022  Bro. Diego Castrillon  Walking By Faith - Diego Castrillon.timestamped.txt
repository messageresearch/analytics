[17:46] oh I heard about
[17:49] his groaning
[17:52] of his Precious Blood

[18:11] Victory
[18:13] in Jesus
[18:16] my Savior forever
[18:22] he's taught me oh
[18:26] anybody

[19:01] his healing oh of his cleansing Powers
[19:07] revealing
[19:10] how we made the land
[19:13] to walk again
[19:16] and he calls the blind to see
[19:22] oh and then I cried near Jesus
[19:28] won't you kill my broken spirit
[19:35] and somehow Jesus came and brought to me
[19:43] the Victory and we're singing now
[19:47] oh Victory
[19:50] in Jesus Oh My Savior forever
[19:59] he's not me

[20:56] men
[20:59] [Music]
[21:01] each time you open your eyes take a
[21:03] breath it's a victory
[21:08] the Apostle Paul said these words
[21:14] because we even have resisted to death
[21:18] is
[21:20] very good this morning
[21:23] want to greet each one of you uh
[21:28] Brothers
[21:32] give me the opportunity to be here
[21:37] direct myself to this precious audience
[21:41] also want to give thanks to our lord
[21:43] Jesus
[21:50] thank you
[21:53] I do it with all fear and trembling
[22:00] before the most precious thing of God
[22:04] how many believe it Brothers
[22:14] you know what the word value is
[22:21] I've heard Christians
[22:24] I'm not worth anything
[22:26] sometimes
[22:31] we felt that
[22:33] is
[22:35] something caught my attention
[22:39] how much is this bottle of water worth
[22:44] if you're not thirsty
[22:47] maybe it's not worth anything to you
[22:49] pero
[22:51] but if you're thirsty that is
[23:00] maybe it's worth 50 cents
[23:04] what's worth in the store
[23:11] it's the same bottle
[23:13] but I'm gonna pay a dollar okay
[23:16] there's more more value to it
[23:22] if I buy it in like in a stadium
[23:33] bottle here
[23:39] it goes to space with the astronauts how
[23:43] much is it worth it
[23:45] it's invaluable it has no price
[24:00] it has in another
[25:02] foreign
[25:51] unto me
[25:55] and not only did he take me out
[25:58] but he placed me
[26:01] Heavenly places
[26:04] and he gave me promise
[26:07] all those promises
[26:11] when I could live with confidence
[26:15] now do you know how much you're worth
[26:20] the soul that you have
[26:24] that's why I'm so happy to be a
[26:26] Christian
[26:59] you're lost
[27:05] you're going to know this morning
[27:09] you're gonna you're gonna leave with
[27:11] enough strength
[27:14] challenge whatever demon from hell and
[27:18] tell him to his face
[27:24] that makes me feel better
[27:29] we can open up our scriptures and Matteo
[27:33] capitulo
[27:34] foreign
[28:45] Matthew 14.
[28:52] and we'll start with verse 23.
[28:56] the scriptures
[29:02] and when he had sent a multitude away he
[29:06] went up into a mountain apart to pray
[29:09] Jesus who's speaking about Jesus
[29:18] and when the evening was come he was
[29:21] there alone
[29:27] but the ship was now in the midst of the
[29:29] sea tossed with waves
[29:32] where the wind was contrary
[29:41] and
[29:43] when the disciples saw him walking on
[29:45] the sea turbaron they were trouble
[29:51] and they cried over for fear
[29:54] Jesus
[29:56] Jesus speaking to them saying
[30:00] be of good cheer in his eyes be not
[30:03] afraid
[30:07] and Peter answered him and said Lord
[30:12] help me come bid me come unto thee on
[30:16] the water
[30:17] and he said come
[30:20] on
[30:24] Jesus and when Peter was come down out
[30:27] of the ship he walked on the water to go
[30:29] to Jesus
[30:33] but when he saw the wind boisterous he
[30:36] was afraid and began to sink
[30:40] and he cried saying Lord Save Me
[30:43] Jesus
[30:45] and immediately Jesus stretched forth
[30:47] his hand
[30:48] and caught him and said unto him
[30:52] watch these words
[31:03] Lord good morning
[31:08] because this morning we can fight
[31:14] you can open up this bread to us
[31:43] spirit that opens up the understanding
[31:46] of these words

[35:33] without faith as impossible it's
[35:36] impossible to please
[35:42] these words
[35:49] you will never obtain nothing of God
[35:52] if it's not through faith
[35:57] then what is faith
[36:02] iones faith is not they're not it's not
[36:05] an emotion
[36:07] sometimes we think
[36:10] that if we shout
[36:13] God is going to answer us and we cry
[36:17] Lord
[36:19] [Music]

[42:13] many years back I remembered yo yo
[42:18] me being a Christian
[42:26] I read disco here
[42:29] but I don't feel anything
[42:33] I'm acting like a hypocrite all right
[42:46] I want to know him if the Bible is the
[42:50] truth and this message is
[42:59] obligated to his wife
[43:01] and since then
[43:03] I can tell you
[43:07] God answers my prayers
[43:28] [Music]
[43:43] to be able to enter into his presence
[43:48] your faith has a confession
[43:51] foreign
[43:55] the commission that came to brother
[43:57] Branham
[44:00] an Affliction is
[44:03] a message from afflictions and
[44:06] infirmities
[44:10] he said the angel told me
[44:13] if you're sincere is
[44:28] you can find out where you're being held
[44:30] back
[44:44] are you sincere
[44:47] are you sincere
[44:52] are you here being sincere with God
[44:56] when you speak with your brother are you
[44:58] sincere
[45:01] you speak with a pastor are you sincere
[45:05] when you pray to God
[45:11] the word sincere signifies
[45:14] are you an Estonia oh there's a story
[45:19] years back
[45:22] Los griegos the the
[45:25] greeksios
[45:29] they were very well known for their
[45:31] culture and their statues and very
[45:33] valuable things
[45:38] many times when the when the sellers
[45:40] would get gather these statues
[45:43] and it would take to sell them
[45:47] they wouldn't mishandle them
[45:53] they would chip like parts of it
[46:00] he would get uh like some cement or what
[46:05] with wax
[46:10] he would guess what she is
[46:17] and the statute looked like it was brand
[46:19] new they put wax on it
[46:23] and the buyer would come
[46:26] you would look at the Statue and it's he
[46:29] would say it's perfect and he would
[46:31] purchase it
[46:32] but when the sun
[46:35] hit the statue
[46:39] all the imperfections started to come
[46:41] out
[46:43] that's where the word
[46:46] there was people
[46:52] and when they were going bye they would
[46:56] tell the sellers I want a statue
[46:59] I want a statue without wax
[47:03] I want it to be perfect
[47:39] if he has made me perfect
[47:41] why do I want to go back
[47:44] on to that condition
[47:47] which condition brother Diego
[47:51] yes 5 10 15 years
[47:55] we still speak about the brothers
[47:59] we still have to talk about these things
[48:08] now this brother he's throwing at me
[48:10] over here
[48:15] you're never going to grow as a
[48:17] Christian
[48:19] personal because you're taking it
[48:21] personally
[48:23] a way that's incorrect
[48:27] so the Bible says
[48:31] by the stripes
[48:40] but if in the church
[48:43] if we hear that someone says something
[48:46] why do we take it personal
[49:08] you have to be very sincere
[49:12] it's not a game
[49:15] the bride is here
[49:17] the predestinated ones
[49:21] now there's a work
[49:26] it has to be done at the same time
[49:31] he needs to know
[49:34] that there is a bride that's perfect
[49:39] faith is required
[49:43] it's a confession
[49:52] another brother in the church
[49:56] why are you not mature enough
[49:59] why don't you just just deal with it
[50:02] just suffering deal with it
[50:06] yeah I know that there's many times that
[50:08] people speak
[50:12] because God shows it to me all right now
[50:16] I I deal with it and I put it to the
[50:19] side
[50:20] and I pray for them

[50:26] but when they get a hold of it
[50:33] like my sons and daughters of God yes
[50:42] just like I have protected them those
[50:46] are my prayers
[50:50] we have to take these things out

[1:01:37] let me tell you brother
[1:01:41] my wife they had to operate her yeah
[1:01:45] it was urgent it was it was definite
[1:01:47] okay
[1:01:52] I believe God used to doctors yeah
[1:02:26] he used to prayer
[1:02:31] he's the Lord
[1:02:35] the the session I have to go to surgery
[1:02:39] the word was spoken and I said
[1:02:42] the way you say brother it was my faith
[1:02:47] the word of God went out and I believed
[1:02:50] it
[1:02:51] in the morning we went again to the
[1:02:53] hospital
[1:02:55] the doctor was going to admit her
[1:02:58] foreign
[1:03:56] how many fast
[1:04:31] the most tremendous
[1:04:52] I did
[1:04:55] who's next
[1:04:59] I begin to pray
[1:05:06] you gave it to me
[1:05:11] go go get another opinion the holy
[1:05:14] spirit says
[1:05:15] I already had the victory because I
[1:05:18] heard his voice
[1:05:19] when my wife went
[1:05:22] I got the best doctor
[1:05:25] I paid whatever it was because
[1:05:29] he looked at the the diagnostic
[1:05:32] operation she doesn't need surgery
[1:06:05] how much does God honor faith
[1:06:08] foreign
[1:07:06] because God knows
[1:07:08] he knows all things
[1:07:11] it's your faith

[1:07:35] you
[1:07:40] we're going to help you so that we can
[1:07:42] all grow in the faith
[1:07:51] it's not what the people pray it's what
[1:07:54] you believe
[1:08:00] the gifts
[1:08:03] they don't heal anyone
[1:08:05] a vision
[1:08:07] it doesn't heal anyone
[1:08:10] but the vision
[1:08:12] of his face
[1:08:18] you understand it
[1:08:20] that's the order the
[1:08:44] has already done it
[1:08:49] oh yeah
[1:08:52] I'm gonna enter in here Peter
[1:08:58] scripture saying hello
[1:09:02] is
[1:09:09] let me show you Castle let me show you a
[1:09:13] special case
[1:09:15] or a real case
[1:09:18] we have all heard
[1:09:21] how Peter was was sinking
[1:09:24] Jesus comes to help him
[1:09:29] why did you doubt hombre
[1:09:33] of little faith
[1:09:36] with all my heart is
[1:09:43] I always kind of would avoid talking
[1:09:46] about that
[1:09:50] because I could not understand how Peter
[1:09:52] could have such little faith
[1:09:54] those are the words of Jesus
[1:09:57] Peter why did you die oh you have little
[1:10:00] faith
[1:10:03] how could Peter have a little faith
[1:10:06] when the scriptures say
[1:10:10] when they when they were in the boat
[1:10:14] the waves would hit it
[1:10:18] in the middle of the Waves an image it
[1:10:21] appears
[1:10:22] and the people get they get scared
[1:10:26] because when we see the supernatural
[1:10:29] Sometimes
[1:10:31] some they get scared
[1:10:36] maybe others are more attentive
[1:11:11] [Music]
[1:11:16] then Peter
[1:11:19] let me say senor he says Lord a school
[1:11:23] chairman here hear this brother Pedro
[1:11:24] Peter
[1:11:27] Jesus it didn't know if that was Jesus
[1:11:30] and Peter was no damage it was
[1:11:33] intelligent
[1:11:35] he didn't know
[1:11:41] the Bible says
[1:11:44] when he recognizes the voice
[1:11:47] and Peter says oh Lord see yes if it is
[1:11:52] you Manda bid me to come pick the word
[1:12:04] for Jesus would speak English in the
[1:12:07] campaign
[1:12:08] things would happen
[1:12:11] when Jesus would say
[1:12:13] oh recover your sights
[1:12:16] those paralyzed
[1:12:19] those the Dead Come resurrect
[1:12:22] here
[1:12:30] that's what Peter said Lord if it's you
[1:12:34] let me send the words
[1:12:43] it's what you believe it's your face
[1:12:47] do you believe that you can come
[1:12:56] he puts his foot on the water
[1:12:58] foreign
[1:13:59] but it was it was a time
[1:14:03] but at one moment
[1:14:08] Peter he says that one time Peter
[1:14:10] looking at the waves come on
[1:14:15] isanto the Holy Spirit told me this
[1:14:19] that's why I hadn't preached it
[1:14:22] while I was working
[1:14:24] he brought me to these words and he told
[1:14:28] me
[1:14:30] when the scripture says
[1:14:35] little faith
[1:14:37] the Holy Spirit told me
[1:14:40] it doesn't say
[1:14:43] the Poquito he didn't say small in
[1:14:46] quantity
[1:14:47] you know Parker but little porque Noel
[1:14:50] because it didn't reach
[1:14:53] to finish come and fall it started
[1:14:59] to finish
[1:15:06] but it was Peter's face
[1:15:14] oh Peter of little faith
[1:15:17] your faith did not sustain this you
[1:15:21] understand
[1:15:23] that's your face
[1:15:26] that fail you
[1:15:28] oh
[1:15:32] yeah muchos
[1:15:34] Christians are precious people
[1:15:38] they're sinking is
[1:15:41] stuck yes
[1:15:43] you know why they're sinking
[1:15:47] because they're like Peter looking at
[1:15:49] the waves
[1:15:51] brothers because I have 10 years
[1:15:56] when the brother told me this is
[1:16:04] five years and I'm still sinking is
[1:16:08] that person treated me back
[1:16:10] they should not have done that
[1:16:15] is our emotions
[1:16:18] that
[1:16:21] [Music]
[1:16:35] that you can walk by faith
[1:16:37] if I ask you
[1:16:40] five more minutes
[1:16:44] how many walk by faith
[1:17:02] because my faith was not sufficient
[1:17:07] we walk by faith
[1:17:13] until the boss he he tells us something
[1:17:16] at work oh yeah I'm not gonna go to
[1:17:18] church you walk by faith
[1:17:25] we walk by faith until the husband does
[1:17:27] something wrong
[1:17:29] I'm not going back
[1:17:31] walk by faith
[1:17:34] causes person in Western things happen
[1:17:37] in our lives
[1:17:49] or do you think that Jesus
[1:17:51] if they have done many things
[1:18:01] but Jesus comes
[1:18:12] that could take his Focus away
[1:18:16] from his mission
[1:18:20] he was the Lamb of God
[1:18:23] there was no storm
[1:18:25] that could drown him Jesus is coming
[1:18:28] here
[1:18:30] that's because he was gone
[1:18:35] the Bible says he's my older brother
[1:18:38] and I look at Peter porque Pedro and
[1:18:41] because Peter
[1:18:43] as a disciple
[1:18:46] he knew that if his Lord could do it
[1:18:49] he had the right to do it also
[1:18:53] are you understanding me
[1:18:56] that was back then
[1:18:58] let me tell you
[1:19:01] the same Jesus
[1:19:07] the Same Works
[1:19:16] he says
[1:19:19] because I will no longer be here
[1:19:23] in
[1:19:31] spirit
[1:19:35] nothing that can hurt you
[1:19:38] and greater workshops
[1:19:40] because I shall be there with you
[1:19:46] there's no virtue in us
[1:19:51] but I have given my heart to someone
[1:19:54] that walked upon the storm
[1:19:57] okay
[1:20:09] I didn't get a chance to reach where I
[1:20:11] wanted to you
[1:20:13] I believe that it has been sufficient
[1:20:18] you shake a few things
[1:20:21] and to refine other things
[1:20:26] so you and I could grow the Bible says
[1:20:30] to the stature
[1:20:46] we have been called to have perfect
[1:20:49] faith
[1:20:51] it's what you believe in
[1:20:55] the Bible says the Bible even says what
[1:20:57] you ask is
[1:21:02] the Bible says yes
[1:21:05] he says whatever he asks whatever I
[1:21:09] asked
[1:21:11] no it's not what the Lord gives look
[1:21:14] what you asked
[1:21:16] how do you understand
[1:21:18] what faith is
[1:21:26] if you could see because this is if you
[1:21:30] feel if you're sinking
[1:21:33] maybe you like Peter
[1:21:36] maybe your faith hasn't been sufficient
[1:21:39] look brother
[1:21:41] I finished with this is
[1:21:48] if he feels inspired
[1:21:53] don't lose the spirit
[1:22:00] and to look
[1:22:06] Lucas thank you Luke 22 32.
[1:22:21] foreign
[1:22:53] I want you to catch this
[1:23:14] you're acting like children all the time
[1:23:16] Dios
[1:23:18] no responses
[1:23:21] God doesn't answer your question
[1:23:24] it's my faith is
[1:23:34] and I finish with this is
[1:23:42] he departed into a mountain for what
[1:23:46] to pray
[1:23:49] it's speaking of Jesus
[1:24:16] we have to be by ourselves with God
[1:24:19] many times
[1:24:52] to pray
[1:25:13] on the land
[1:25:15] watch the scene
[1:25:23] the ship was in the midst of the Sea
[1:25:27] on the land
[1:25:29] where it was a ship
[1:25:33] where was Jesus
[1:25:41] the following verse
[1:25:44] country
[1:26:02] and he saw the toiling and growing even
[1:26:05] though
[1:26:06] for the wind was contrary to them
[1:26:10] how could Jesus see them
[1:26:13] if he was on the land
[1:26:16] you understand
[1:26:20] Jesus was not there
[1:26:22] he was on the land he was praying
[1:26:26] he had a vision
[1:26:29] he saw his disciples
[1:26:33] tired
[1:26:37] the Bible said let's read it again
[1:26:39] together
[1:26:43] he saw them toiling and Rowing
[1:26:46] the Bible is
[1:26:49] the Bible wants you to understand
[1:26:52] that he knows what your what Your toil
[1:26:55] is
[1:26:57] what you're going through the Bible says
[1:27:02] that the wind was contrary
[1:27:07] aren't you tired of everything what was
[1:27:09] going wrong
[1:27:12] how could Jesus see this
[1:27:15] because he had a vision
[1:27:20] foreign
[1:27:21] that's why he went walking
[1:27:25] to rescue
[1:27:27] Amigos rescue his friends
[1:27:31] and I finished with his testimony
[1:27:36] every time that my pastor our pastor
[1:27:39] goes out on a missionary field
[1:27:41] when I speak of faith
[1:27:44] I also said that I was going to speak on
[1:27:47] the gifts
[1:27:51] it's important for the people
[1:27:54] you learn what the Bible says about the
[1:27:57] gifts
[1:28:01] 90 of what the majority of these
[1:28:03] churches have heard
[1:28:06] [Applause]
[1:28:07] they say that the gifts are no longer
[1:28:09] needed
[1:28:11] oh we don't need the gifts anymore
[1:28:13] what the gifts
[1:28:16] we have the word
[1:28:21] that has partial truth
[1:28:25] but let us look at the scene here
[1:28:29] Jesus
[1:28:31] was not only a prophet
[1:28:34] is
[1:28:35] he was the god prophet
[1:28:38] yes
[1:28:39] and he was as a man
[1:28:42] he didn't know what was happening
[1:28:47] the Bible says that you saw them that
[1:28:50] they were toiling foreign
[1:29:02] this is gone that is a gift
[1:29:05] thanks for the gift Jesus Jesus
[1:29:10] he could go walking
[1:29:12] and go and rescue his friends
[1:29:20] every time
[1:29:24] I'm Amanda I like to pray yes because
[1:29:32] it's a nature
[1:29:36] is
[1:29:45] so days before your pasture goes and
[1:29:48] goes out to these different countries
[1:29:50] by the grace of God
[1:29:54] because God has provided a gift
[1:29:58] he's sovereign
[1:31:05] this man has a problem
[1:31:07] this man is stuck over here
[1:31:12] other times
[1:31:14] I see symbols
[1:31:17] foreign
[1:32:04] Glory Glory
[1:32:06] every gift
[1:32:09] that God has placed in the church
[1:32:13] has to be proven first
[1:32:15] is
[1:32:30] has to be proven first is
[1:32:39] when the Holy Spirit began to give this
[1:32:41] gift into the church
[1:32:45] I recognize that sister
[1:32:47] she spoke in tongues that's the Holy
[1:32:51] Spirit
[1:32:52] and I know the life that she lives
[1:32:55] foreign
[1:33:30] trip to Denver
[1:33:33] and this Vision that God gave me
[1:33:37] okay
[1:33:39] when I begin to speak to your pastor
[1:33:41] what he's going to encounter over there
[1:33:47] something I still don't understand
[1:33:56] I know when you get there
[1:33:59] there's going to be an atmosphere
[1:34:01] there's going to be a contrary
[1:34:07] not that the church will be operating
[1:34:09] this atmosphere
[1:34:12] but what was happening at that moment it
[1:34:15] was gonna be contrary
[1:34:19] because there was a malignant purpose
[1:34:27] be able to kill two people in those in
[1:34:29] that congregation
[1:34:30] Persona there were not just any any
[1:34:32] people
[1:34:34] was the the wife of the past and and his
[1:34:37] daughter crocodiles
[1:34:45] brother you can say what does that have
[1:34:47] to do with it
[1:34:48] that's the way God speaks
[1:34:56] to show me the nature of the spirits
[1:34:59] that we're attacking in Denver
[1:35:01] uh
[1:35:08] I told my pastor
[1:35:12] the spirits
[1:35:16] personas don't want to kill these people
[1:35:25] um
[1:35:32] very very like like stealth like like
[1:35:35] likes to hide it's it's
[1:35:42] hides under the water it only shows its
[1:35:45] eyes
[1:35:46] oh when the crocodile bites it's death
[1:35:50] there's no way
[1:36:40] a great victory in that place
[1:36:47] when our pastor gets there
[1:36:49] is
[1:36:55] the the wife and the daughters
[1:37:03] that there's a great chance that they
[1:37:06] will not make it
[1:37:11] now the vision begins to form the
[1:37:14] picture
[1:37:17] it's not the good picture
[1:37:21] it's good when you go you say
[1:37:23] we're here
[1:37:28] he has a trial that magnitude
[1:37:31] of this man of God
[1:38:26] that's what Visions are foreign
[1:38:45] prayed
