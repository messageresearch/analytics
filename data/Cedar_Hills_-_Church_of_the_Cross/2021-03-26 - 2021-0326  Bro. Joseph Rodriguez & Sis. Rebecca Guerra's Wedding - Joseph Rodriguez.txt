[Music] so [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] foreign [Music] is [Music] yes this place [Music] falling in love [Music] it goes [Music] cool [Music] me who giveth this woman to this man in the bonds of holy matrimony coming here this by evening privilege to be here you all ready so i don't know how many bats were lost tonight but i am crying inside you know i brother caleb had um told me a while back he said it's payback time and i thought i was still gonna get away with it but you know i i am we're reflecting on our lives and it was a privilege to baptize every one of my kids my children it's a privilege today to marry my daughter i'm not losing a daughter but i'm gaining quite a quite a man as a son if you cry you're going to make me cry so and we you know we we love joe rodriguez to death so he's you know proud to to be here standing with with this beautiful couple this this night amen you may be seated we're gonna enter we're going to enter into god's sacred word um i'm going to read a passage from saint mark 10 7 through 10. and it reads like this for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh so then they are no more twain but one flesh what therefore god has joined together let no man put asunder amen and you know we it's a special day when you have the opportunity to marry your your daughter and i tried to see what would be the most appropriate guidance that we could give them tonight um and as i was reading and i was reading this the scripture says what god has joined together this ain't what man has joined together but it's what god has joined together you see many advertisements on tv on on what they say come join this app or join this to find your perfect couple or to find your perfect mate but as i was reflecting on my own life you know i was thinking what would be the best scenario that i could think of the love of god and you know when when you find the one that god has placed in your path you go through many trials and it's i was thinking if if we both were perfect i don't think we would have loved each other as much as we we do now you know you have these trials and if if we're perfect you know because many times as humans we expect god to show us his love we expect god to show us his mercy but we fail to show our spouse the same love the same mercy the same forgiveness you know and where does that perfectness come from that perfectness comes from god you know in a marriage there's not just two but there's three you know if god is not present your marriage will fail you know because that's where we get the perfectness and that's where we find mercy that's where we find grace because we were all lost in sin shaped in iniquity but the scripture tells us here what god had joined together it says let no man it says let no man break this so what a perfect picture god has placed for us today it's a miracle that these two are sitting here in our midst in this world that we live in but this is what god has joined together you know many people in this world choose why get married we could live in sin we could live we could do this and we could still be successful we could still be rich we could still have children it the story goes on and on but because what is it it's sin and that's what we're fighting against here this morning or this evening is sin you know many many times we just let so casually sin enter into our lives and we forget the sanctity of marriage that god has placed in our midst that's why the scripture says what god has joined so beck and joe you have to find your center and your center is not a good job your center is not a nice house your center is not a good car but your center is god if you find that center in your life you will be successful i always remember the story that the prophet of god tells us he says i married two couples he said one was well off the other didn't have much but he said when i went to check on the couple that had many he says as i was approaching the door all i could hear was bickering fighting he says they were barely hanging on he said but when i went to the couple that didn't have much he says what an example of love that i saw because why they had their center which was god many times we we tried to say god is our center but when we look at our lives everything comes before god everything no matter what it is but if you guys can place god as your center and stick to it no matter things things are going to get hard that's why when we get into the vows through sickness through trials that's where you gain your character i always remember our founding pastor brother the mosque senior me and my wife were were newlyweds we were struggling and we went to him for counseling and at this time my aunt biola was really really sick and one of the things he told me that always stuck to my heart he said i never knew love until now he says i thought i loved your auntie he says but when she got sick he says i really found how much i loved her this is because i had to take care of her i had to nurture her and he said once god put this through he said i really found out how much i really loved her and i'm looking and he was such an example to us i'm looking and i'm saying you know many times we don't understand what love is we we want to see love through our eyes instead of seeing it through god's eyes that's why it's so important that god becomes our centerpiece and if you could start and keep it there you don't have to worry about anything else because it's not going to matter the only thing that matters your walk with god and are you ready for the mouse joe are you happy becca are you happy this is this this you guys have to look at this this is a victorious day you know for me as a father it's a victorious day you know we i have my daughter has found somebody that believes the same way she does that believes the message of the hour that's a good christian young man so you know if i shed tears they're going to be tears of joy they're not going to be tears of sadness you know let me just so you understand what i'm getting into i we had rented a lift to do the hall and as soon as we started it broke down and normally said okay let's just take it back so before i knew joe and gabe had this sucker broke down and they had it fixed and i'm all sheesh i don't need a mechanic anymore so you know it's i really have have come to to love joe he's he had he he he didn't understand me when we started off you know we we had to put him through some trials and some temptation you know but he's still here he's still here so he he must love her amen let's let's let's enter into these vows you will stand dearly beloved we are gathered here together in the sight of god and in the face of all this company to join together this man and woman in holy matrimony which is commanded by saint paul to be honorable among all men it is therefore not by any to enter in unadvisedly or lightly but reverently disgracefully soberly and in the fear of god y'all understand that right into this holy state these two persons present come to be joined if there's anyone here that can show a just cause why they shouldn't be lawfully joined together in holy matrimony do you now speak or from here on after forever hold your peace i'll require and will be charged you both as you surely answer at that day of judgment when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed if there's either of you that know any impediment why you should not lawfully join together in holy matrimony do you now confess it be assured unto you and to the couples that are joined otherwise that god's word does allow their marriage is not lawful but duly believe you have considered this solemn obligation you're about to assume that you have prepared to enter upon the same reverently disgracefully soberly in the fear of god i shall propose to you the marriage covenant you will witness the same you will join your right hands together just relax you know you guys are shaking joseph rodriguez will you have this woman to be your lawful wedded wife to live together in this holy state of matrimony we didn't hear you you waited this long do you promise to love and honor and cherish and support in sickness or health riches or poverty and will forsake all others as long as you both shall live he said yes rebecca will you have this man to be your lawful wedded husband to live together in this holy state of matrimony do you promise to love honor and cherish and support in sickness or health riches or poverty and cleave to thee only unto him as long as you both shall live he said yes joe i will require a token take it
