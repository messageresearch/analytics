[11:16] brandham
[11:17] amen William Mar
[11:27] br
[11:32] good morning friends it's a privilege to
[11:35] be here this morning in the service of
[11:37] the
[11:38] Lord and all the teachings of this book
[11:44] there's not one verse that you can put
[11:46] your finger on but what with the grace
[11:48] and the help of the holy spirit that we
[11:50] can Tide Genesis of Revelations right
[11:52] into it amen there's not another piece
[11:55] of literature written anywhere that can
[11:57] do that but but you know God sometimes
[12:00] makes some of the to our opinion some of
[12:02] the most foolish
[12:04] choices now God seen a little hook NOS
[12:07] Jew just as full of temper as he could
[12:10] be with his mouth setting sideways I'll
[12:13] go down rest every one of them I'll I'll
[12:15] throw them in jail I'll do this God said
[12:17] that's my choice right
[12:19] there oh you spoke with tongues oh you
[12:21] shouted run up down the aisles and cried
[12:24] tears like You' been peeling onions that
[12:26] don't mean one thing not one thing
[12:30] unless that everyday life backs up just
[12:33] exactly he knew he had to face Pharisees
[12:36] he had to face Sadducees he had to face
[12:39] the world and the Gentile world and so
[12:42] Paul this Bible is written this book of
[12:44] Hebrews is written for that purpose he's
[12:47] shaking those Hebrews and taking that
[12:49] Old Testament and showing it over here
[12:51] in the New Testament this is God he said
[12:54] amen here it is on on all the prophets
[12:56] and everything he was the angel that led
[12:59] the children of Israel in this light
[13:00] through the Wilderness he returned back
[13:03] to that same light and Paul saw it out
[13:04] of the Old Testament amen he said I'm
[13:07] Jesus the angel of the Covenant and when
[13:10] Paul seen that he said sure that was him
[13:13] and here he is this morning doing the
[13:15] same
[13:16] thing the Scripture vindicates
[13:19] it the camera vindicates it now that
[13:23] reason I refer to that picture it isn't
[13:25] because I'm there I'm I'm just a sinner
[13:29] Save By Grace like you are but what I'm
[13:31] trying to say is it's his presence with
[13:34] us that's the main thing now what did
[13:37] God do now Paul's trying to speak what
[13:40] is it led them out of Egypt was it Moses
[13:43] No Moses was a flesh instrument and
[13:47] listen for some when they had heard did
[13:52] provoke how many knows that the
[13:53] Israelites provoke god with their
[13:55] unbelief amen they murmured they
[13:57] completely God walked right down there
[14:00] when they got out the first thing they
[14:01] got in trouble God loves to bring you in
[14:04] trouble he loves to put trouble down and
[14:07] see what you'll do about it so he just
[14:09] stopped up the Red Sea and the first
[14:11] thing you don't marched him right out
[14:12] into this place then sent Pharaoh after
[14:15] him see how God likes to do it he loves
[14:18] to display his power and love he's God
[14:23] and he just loves to show you who he is
[14:26] could you imagine
[14:29] god with his with his Sanctified holy
[14:33] people led them right out in this trap
[14:36] then got him out of that trap and let
[14:38] him run out here where there's no water
[14:40] when he could have tuck him somewhere
[14:41] where there was
[14:42] water oh you're unbelief you provoke me
[14:46] to
[14:47] anger because of unbelief think of it
[14:51] you've got to separate yourself from
[14:53] that dogma of the world ah them days of
[14:56] Miracles just passed there's no such a
[14:57] thing as that that's ftic ISM separate
[15:00] yourself the Bible said come out from
[15:03] among them and be ye separated sayth the
[15:05] Lord and I will receive
[15:06] you I will receive you after you
[15:09] separate yourself you shall be my
[15:11] children I'll be your God separate
[15:13] yourself don't yoke yourself up with
[15:16] unbelievers that's right young man
[15:18] getting married marrying some girl that
[15:21] don't believe or some young girl married
[15:23] a boy that don't believe you do that I
[15:26] don't care how cute he is and
[15:29] and how cute she is and what those big
[15:31] eyes she's got they'll all fade out one
[15:33] of these days but brother your soul will
[15:35] to live forever be careful what you're
[15:38] doing she ain't a real believer him a
[15:40] real believer don't you yoke yourself up
[15:42] like that stay away from such it'll
[15:44] cause you trouble down the road he's
[15:47] speaking to the Christians now don't you
[15:49] let this same gospel that was preached
[15:52] back on Earth in signs and wonders and a
[15:55] pillar of fire let him when these things
[15:56] go to takeen place again don't you fall
[15:59] over the Wayside by unbelief to go to
[16:01] dton for their carcass fell in the
[16:04] wilderness but now we remove into a
[16:07] dispensation and don't you harden your
[16:09] heart don't you act like they did in the
[16:13] days of provocation when they provoke
[16:15] God how they do it not believe in him
[16:18] morally let me grind this down to you
[16:21] you said brother R I go to church that's
[16:23] all right I never lied in my life that's
[16:26] fine I never stole I never done this
[16:28] that that's very fine that's all good
[16:30] but that still isn't
[16:33] sin the sin is when God shows himself
[16:36] and you disbelieve
[16:38] it each one of them prophets know just
[16:41] what the other Prophet had said and know
[16:42] that their Spirit was the same and they
[16:44] was
[16:46] watching oh
[16:49] brother that hard to shake us out of our
[16:51] word and condition there you are let the
[16:54] world say what they want do and do what
[16:56] they want do blessed be the name of the
[16:59] Lord Keep Me In Christ if I'm called
[17:02] anything a fanatic or holy ruler someday
[17:05] he's coming and those that are in Christ
[17:09] will God bring with him when he comes
[17:12] it's all a spiritual revealed truth
[17:15] laying right there and it takes a
[17:17] spiritual mind to catch
[17:19] it rest on that through the day think of
[17:22] it even if you do without your dinner

[47:21] B Elizabeth
[47:23] Elizabeth I like the number three
[47:27] three is
[47:32] perfection I was able to come to the
[47:34] gospel in 1978 by the grace of
[47:40] God and this message arrived unto me by
[47:42] God's grace by
[47:48] 1980 I was just a teenager I fell in
[47:50] love with this
[47:54] message I grew up up hearing about the
[47:57] heroes in the
[47:58] Bibles I fell in love with
[48:01] Moses I fell in love with
[48:03] Joshua I fell in love with all the
[48:08] Patriarchs I fell in love with each and
[48:10] every one of those
[48:13] characters and when I arrived into this
[48:15] message by his
[48:20] grace I learned that God is Not only a
[48:23] god of history but a god of the present
[48:27] and I began to hear the name of other
[48:31] Heroes and of course we know brother
[48:37] brandham I began to hear about arus Paul
[48:43] Columbo and the more that I read about
[48:45] them I fell more in love with them
[48:47] Wesley I fell in love with
[48:51] Wesley I fell in love with Charles uh
[48:54] Fus
[48:57] I'm still in love with
[49:01] them but nonetheless for my
[49:08] benefit I began to hear about the uh
[49:11] Heroes of Our
[49:14] Generation I grew up hearing their
[49:17] names I heard brother Bernie Garcia
[49:21] Thomas perz
[49:22] enri enri Anaya
[49:27] and one day I heard about a brother
[49:29] Fabio
[49:31] Bernal I heard I remember the first time
[49:33] that I heard his
[49:35] name it was like as if I was looking up
[49:37] at the
[49:39] stars he was so tall and I was so
[49:47] small and for the first time yesterday I
[49:50] had the privilege to be able to hear him
[49:51] for more than two
[49:54] hours
[49:56] and I've been able to store up
[49:57] everything from what he told me
[50:04] yesterday and I met brother thas perz in
[50:10] 1995 and just by hearing him I knew that
[50:13] he was going to be
[50:15] Supernatural and I believe in the
[50:18] Supernatural and I'm a product of that
[50:23] Supernatural and in this morning I'm
[50:24] directing myself to the
[50:28] supernatural I don't only want a god
[50:30] from
[50:32] yesterday I want a present
[50:37] God so for me this is something that's
[50:40] really important to be able to express
[50:44] it because if it wasn't for these men
[50:46] that paved the
[50:48] way what would be of all of
[50:54] us the grace came in wrapped in human
[51:00] flesh a God in
[51:06] feet and I recognize that I'm amongst
[51:09] all of them the
[51:15] smallest and I'm very grateful for the
[51:17] amount of effort that these men have put
[51:19] forth let's give them an
[51:24] Applause
[51:30] to be able to leave their homes their
[51:32] families their
[51:36] children to leave the church and have
[51:38] money
[51:40] invested now I understand it in my own
[51:45] flesh it's the work that the Lord has
[51:48] called me to
[51:50] do I know the kind of pain it is to be
[51:53] able to leave your children and your
[51:54] wife behind
[51:59] now you understand now the pain that it
[52:00] is to leave your church and your
[52:01] brothers
[52:04] behind but I know that that is that
[52:07] there's no other greater calling than
[52:11] that and I've came to understand that
[52:13] eternal life is to live for
[52:18] others and when Jesus was hanging up on
[52:21] the cross he was living for eternal
[52:24] life
[52:26] someone has to die so That Others May
[52:31] Live every day something dies for
[52:33] somebody to be able to
[52:37] live that is the very essence of our
[52:40] existence and to be able to keep going
[52:43] forward the message that we preach and
[52:45] we
[52:50] believe has to be a part of our walk our
[52:52] talk and our
[52:54] thinking
[52:58] so in this morning I take advantage of
[52:59] this beautiful
[53:03] opportunity to be able to thank and
[53:06] greet our precious heroes from Las
[53:08] Cruses New
[53:10] Mexico I love the last name of
[53:15] peris some brothers tell me that that
[53:18] was the last name of
[53:22] adamz and here I find our brother Emilio
[53:24] Perez
[53:27] I love you my
[53:30] brother I fell in love since the very
[53:33] first time that I met
[53:36] you I ask that you forgive for the way
[53:38] that I
[53:40] speak am I can't do much more less than
[53:45] my last name is love my father is
[53:49] love I'm his son so I am
[53:53] love so and this morning I direct myself
[53:56] to the god of love the children and you
[54:00] are also
[54:03] love uh one time I saw a man take a
[54:05] horse by
[54:08] whipping and I saw how obedient that
[54:11] was and it was based of all the
[54:16] whiplashes and then I saw another man
[54:18] take another horse with
[54:21] sugar and I saw that sugar was love
[54:29] I ask that you forgive me for being so
[54:39] romantic as I knew this message or
[54:42] understood this message I couldn't
[54:47] help and the greatest Prophet that ever
[54:49] stepped on Earth was our Lord Jesus
[54:53] Christ and all of us are small
[55:00] poets and I hope that this may be a way
[55:03] or a manner of
[55:09] living and in this morning I also send
[55:12] bring forth the greetings from the
[55:13] church where I
[55:16] attend in the Missionary Church the
[55:17] blood of Jesus
[55:22] Christ never did I ever think that I
[55:24] would one day preached the
[55:27] gospel I didn't know that I was born for
[55:32] this when I came to
[55:36] Earth I thought that I was
[55:40] jari I didn't know what the purpose of
[55:42] my life
[55:47] was and now I live eternally grateful
[55:49] for this great
[55:51] honor to be able to
[55:54] speak
[55:57] to be able to
[56:01] preach and which is the greatest gift
[56:03] that the Lord has given
[56:09] us and in this morning I'm going to be
[56:11] resting upon this beautiful scripture of
[56:13] St
[56:18] Matthew If any man will come after me
[56:20] let him deny
[56:23] himself and take up his cross and follow
[56:29] me and we all know that we're all living
[56:32] in very Glorious
[56:35] Days never has a church ever lived in a
[56:38] time like
[56:40] this how privileged we
[56:46] are Abraham wanted to sit where you're
[56:48] at at this
[56:53] moment
[56:55] the prophets who wrote the Bible would
[56:56] give anything to be able to be where
[56:58] we're standing
[57:02] at this is the greatest day of all
[57:08] days the Earth is groaning and moaning
[57:10] for this great
[57:14] day the day of the manifestation of the
[57:17] sons of
[57:20] God and at the same time this is the
[57:23] worst and most dangerous time of
[57:27] all and see that nobody deceives
[57:32] you because many will come in my name
[57:35] and they will
[57:38] deceive to us there's no denomination
[57:41] that can come and deceive
[57:44] us a communist can't come and deceive
[57:50] us but when somebody comes and believes
[57:53] the same or says that they believe the
[57:54] the same thing that we
[57:57] do that's why we're now
[58:02] obligated to become one with this
[58:08] word to be able to come in an agreement
[58:11] with this word at a daily
[58:14] basis because these are dark and
[58:16] troubling
[58:20] days and as we see as the darkness
[58:23] grows
[58:25] how sin is
[58:29] growing I asked myself who is the one
[58:31] that's responsible for
[58:35] all and the easiest thing for me to do
[58:37] is to blame the
[58:39] devil poor
[58:44] devil and in this morning I'm not here
[58:46] to defend
[58:48] [Music]
[58:51] [Applause]
[58:53] him
[58:55] I'm here with the purpose to be able to
[58:57] see what our part
[59:00] is I'm not a product of just so and
[59:06] so we didn't come to have a picnic
[59:11] day we're children of a plan of a
[59:18] project and then for some reason God
[59:20] permitted us to be able to be born in
[59:21] this
[59:23] day
[59:26] we hope that all of us be able to will
[59:28] be able to see what that purpose
[59:33] is and as a man of this message but the
[59:36] greatest desire was to be a happy
[59:41] one be happy in my matrimony to be happy
[59:44] as a
[59:47] son be happy in the church to be able to
[59:50] back up the
[59:51] cause all of that was good
[59:56] but that's not
[59:57] enough there is still something
[1:00:03] greater and I always went along feeling
[1:00:06] empty inside and I never understood
[1:00:12] why I married the most beautiful woman
[1:00:14] in the world forgive me
[1:00:19] sisters and I have the most beautiful
[1:00:21] children in the world forgive me
[1:00:23] Brothers
[1:00:28] I have the greatest mother and the
[1:00:29] greatest Brothers forgive me
[1:00:34] please and I congregated in the greatest
[1:00:36] Church in the
[1:00:42] world and even though I had all of that
[1:00:45] I still felt empty inside and I didn't
[1:00:47] understand
[1:00:52] why and the Lord came on to me 25 years
[1:00:55] later after knowing this
[1:00:59] message and I had lost myself in a cage
[1:01:02] or in a jail cell that I created
[1:01:05] myself my own denomination
[1:01:11] ofari nobody put me in there I put
[1:01:13] myself in there and I incar incarcerated
[1:01:19] myself I never drank smoked and never
[1:01:22] went around with women
[1:01:25] but yet I was still
[1:01:29] lost in a jail cell that I created
[1:01:34] myself and then when I realized that
[1:01:35] that was my sad
[1:01:39] truth when I thought that there was
[1:01:41] nothing else left for
[1:01:44] me he came unto me when I least expected
[1:01:49] it and on the 12th of October of
[1:01:52] 2003 he came unto me
[1:01:55] I never went seeking for him he looked
[1:01:58] for
[1:02:00] me I was lost in the
[1:02:05] religion I thought it was enough just to
[1:02:07] be able to know this
[1:02:11] message I thought it was enough to be
[1:02:13] able to say that God sent a
[1:02:16] prophet and all that is great that's all
[1:02:19] of our
[1:02:21] identity but nonetheless there's still
[1:02:24] something
[1:02:25] I
[1:02:27] am the very life of
[1:02:30] [Applause]
[1:02:32] God and that's the very thing that all
[1:02:35] of us
[1:02:37] need and the reason why I was
[1:02:41] lost the reason why I felt like I wanted
[1:02:43] to
[1:02:45] die was because the church wasn't
[1:02:47] sufficient enough for
[1:02:49] me the church is
[1:02:51] okay she fulfills a certain part
[1:02:57] but nonetheless you will never take the
[1:02:59] place of the Holy
[1:03:01] [Applause]
[1:03:04] Ghost she will never take the place of a
[1:03:06] personal experience with the Living
[1:03:09] God and that's the very thing that all
[1:03:11] of us need this
[1:03:14] day when I was a child I read in the
[1:03:19] Bible but nonetheless those that are
[1:03:23] here
[1:03:26] will not hinder those that have gone
[1:03:31] on more than 40 years had to passed by
[1:03:33] for me to be able to
[1:03:37] understand that as long as I didn't
[1:03:39] surrender
[1:03:41] myself I'm just a hindrance for all of
[1:03:44] those that are
[1:03:47] sleeping those that are resting in
[1:03:49] Christ Jesus want to raise
[1:03:52] up and the reason why they can't do
[1:03:56] it because of the reason that we don't
[1:03:59] surrender
[1:04:02] ourselves we're now hindering the coming
[1:04:05] of the
[1:04:08] Lord because the same Lord coming with a
[1:04:13] shout voice of
[1:04:18] Archangel we're all waiting for that
[1:04:21] second
[1:04:23] part of that second mysterious
[1:04:27] descent but there has to be an alignment
[1:04:31] done we have to
[1:04:37] understand that we're the main
[1:04:39] characters in this
[1:04:44] play how many of you are understanding
[1:04:49] me forgive me for my
[1:04:52] voice my wife
[1:04:56] I wish you had a much softer
[1:05:02] voice some couple years
[1:05:04] ago Phoenix I was in
[1:05:12] Phoenix and I met with a man that had
[1:05:15] knowledge about the
[1:05:20] word and he came to visit me in the
[1:05:22] place where I was staying at
[1:05:25] and he came with his
[1:05:28] wife and then all of a sudden he told me
[1:05:30] brother
[1:05:32] scari I present unto you my
[1:05:37] cross and the sister didn't stay
[1:05:41] quiet and she said brother scar
[1:05:45] Roi I present unto you also my
[1:05:51] [Music]
[1:05:53] cross
[1:05:54] and that scarred my mind and my heart
[1:05:56] for many
[1:06:00] years and it came unto my mind that how
[1:06:02] many times we said that our wife is our
[1:06:05] cross my children are my
[1:06:09] cross the problems the issues are my
[1:06:13] cross my children are not my
[1:06:17] cross they are the greatest thing that's
[1:06:19] ever happened to
[1:06:20] me my wife is not my cross is
[1:06:26] my wife is my better half the
[1:06:30] trials They're Not My
[1:06:34] Cross brother Bram says that when a man
[1:06:37] loves
[1:06:38] God he sends them a
[1:06:43] trial so then trials are just nothing
[1:06:46] but a demonstration of God's
[1:06:48] love because it's through those
[1:06:53] trials
[1:06:55] that that man of God that's within us is
[1:06:57] going to get
[1:06:59] perfected God didn't die for
[1:07:02] him he died for the one that lives
[1:07:07] inside and nobody ever saw
[1:07:10] him the one that's out here is
[1:07:14] not it's just the house that lives
[1:07:19] in but all the sacrifices I make because
[1:07:22] of this
[1:07:24] but nonetheless this is not
[1:07:26] me and I've come to
[1:07:31] realize she says where has that young
[1:07:33] man that I fell in love gone
[1:07:38] to and I look at myself in the mirror
[1:07:40] and I can't
[1:07:42] deny but the one that lives inside of
[1:07:46] me was made at the very image of
[1:07:50] God it's a piece of
[1:07:52] God the image of
[1:07:56] God and he looks like
[1:07:59] God so then what's our
[1:08:04] cross because if we love him then we're
[1:08:07] going to follow
[1:08:09] him but we have to take up our
[1:08:12] cross and I can't take your
[1:08:16] cross and each and every one of us has
[1:08:18] our own made
[1:08:21] cross and your cross will never be my
[1:08:23] cross
[1:08:25] and my cross will never be your
[1:08:27] cross my cross is not my
[1:08:30] wife neither is it my
[1:08:33] children neither is it my
[1:08:38] trials my my cross is not the uh slip
[1:08:41] ups and
[1:08:43] mistakes what is my cross then
[1:08:47] Lord when Jesus came to
[1:08:52] Earth he had already known very clearly
[1:08:55] what his role was going to be
[1:09:00] here he didn't come with a forgetful
[1:09:03] mind like you and
[1:09:08] me he said father glorify me with the
[1:09:11] glory that we had
[1:09:16] before and it's still taking me some
[1:09:18] time that I was in the thoughts of
[1:09:21] God I didn't know that
[1:09:26] I thought that I had started at the
[1:09:28] moment of
[1:09:31] conception and now we
[1:09:34] understand that our very beginning was
[1:09:36] at the mind of
[1:09:40] God so then what's your cross brother
[1:09:42] scavi stop beating the
[1:09:45] bush our cross my
[1:09:48] cross is our
[1:09:52] responsibilities
[1:09:55] each and every one of us has come to
[1:09:57] this Earth with a
[1:10:00] responsibility and nobody will be able
[1:10:02] to do the job that I have to
[1:10:06] do and nobody will be able to do the job
[1:10:08] that you
[1:10:12] are and when I say this I don't only
[1:10:14] refer myself to the
[1:10:17] ministry I don't refer myself only to
[1:10:19] the
[1:10:21] ministers because at the end of the day
[1:10:23] we're all preacher
[1:10:27] the woman preaches without words Peter
[1:10:30] said can you preach without saying any
[1:10:35] words and then the greatest message that
[1:10:37] ever was
[1:10:39] preached wasn't of
[1:10:44] words our own lives has to be a
[1:10:51] preaching we're written Epistles read of
[1:10:53] all
[1:10:56] man I Am The Gospel According to
[1:11:01] St and for the love of God please don't
[1:11:07] misinterpret I'm not here so that you
[1:11:09] can think that I'm holy even though I
[1:11:12] am I wish that everybody would think the
[1:11:17] same we can't be holy without the Holy
[1:11:21] One we can't be Christians without
[1:11:26] Christ does not make us a
[1:11:29] [Applause]
[1:11:31] Christian being the children of the
[1:11:33] pastor doesn't make
[1:11:36] us being his friend or relative
[1:11:43] doesn't to be a Christian we need the
[1:11:45] Life of Christ to be within
[1:11:49] us that's the reason why I felt so empty
[1:11:52] inside
[1:11:54] all alone
[1:11:58] and and it was because of the absence of
[1:12:01] God within my own
[1:12:03] heart and I was a deacon for many
[1:12:07] years being a deacon is something good
[1:12:12] but the greatest thing that could ever
[1:12:14] happen to
[1:12:18] us is that God's own life rest within
[1:12:22] us
[1:12:25] a brother once told
[1:12:27] me why is it that brother Branham always
[1:12:30] [Applause]
[1:12:34] says if God ever gives a holy ghost to a
[1:12:37] man he will never let
[1:12:39] him I believe in the
[1:12:42] order and God is a god of
[1:12:45] order God placed in
[1:12:49] order and God doesn't like
[1:12:52] disorder
[1:12:54] but when God gives us his
[1:12:59] life he gives it unto us so that his
[1:13:01] Works may continue
[1:13:05] on Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:13:07] today and
[1:13:13] forever and we have seen the life of of
[1:13:16] Jesus Christ being replicated in the
[1:13:18] life of brother
[1:13:20] brandham but God is not a god of History
[1:13:25] he's not only a god of the
[1:13:28] future he is a god of the
[1:13:31] present he is not
[1:13:34] sleeping he's not
[1:13:36] dead he's
[1:13:38] [Applause]
[1:13:40] alive but we have them incarcerated like
[1:13:42] I
[1:13:44] [Applause]
[1:13:46] did I imprisoned the Lord Jesus Through
[1:13:49] the last 25
[1:13:52] years
[1:13:53] can you
[1:13:57] imagine the saddest thing that I ever
[1:13:58] saw brother Bram said
[1:14:01] once and prisoned
[1:14:04] Eagle it was the saddest
[1:14:09] thing because God had given the Eagle
[1:14:12] wings to so that he could
[1:14:16] fly and since we all create our own
[1:14:21] cage we start to fill ourselves with
[1:14:27] limitation but this message brings back
[1:14:29] that sight that we once
[1:14:31] lost taking off that
[1:14:33] Veil what is taking off that
[1:14:36] Veil it's to open our
[1:14:40] eyes we need that our eyes to be
[1:14:44] open and and I'm not speaking about our
[1:14:46] physical
[1:14:48] eyes because these eyes are pointed
[1:14:52] outward
[1:14:54] they cannot see on the
[1:14:58] inside then now we have a need to be
[1:15:00] able to see with some different kind of
[1:15:05] eyes when I see the word of the Lord I
[1:15:07] don't see it
[1:15:09] nobody I see myself in
[1:15:13] there because the word of God is a
[1:15:17] [Applause]
[1:15:18] mirror so then when I ask myself then
[1:15:20] who's that
[1:15:22] fault and answer my own
[1:15:25] self based upon what brother Branham has
[1:15:31] said that at fault the ones that are
[1:15:33] standing behind the
[1:15:37] pulpit and I'm not here as a
[1:15:42] saint I am here as a preacher of the
[1:15:47] gospel and I've come to realize that I
[1:15:49] have not surrendered myself
[1:15:52] enough
[1:15:54] I've realized that I've come to relax
[1:15:56] myself and get
[1:15:59] comfortable so then I say unto the Lord
[1:16:02] help
[1:16:04] me my mother always told
[1:16:06] me you have to
[1:16:09] die so That Others May
[1:16:12] Live you have to
[1:16:15] die but who loves to
[1:16:17] die nobody wants to
[1:16:20] die but that's the origins of
[1:16:24] you have to
[1:16:26] die to be able to
[1:16:28] live my
[1:16:30] cross our
[1:16:32] cross are not our
[1:16:37] problems it's not our daily pressures
[1:16:39] that we
[1:16:41] live and it's not our
[1:16:44] limitations and it's not our
[1:16:47] differences our
[1:16:49] cross is the
[1:16:52] responsibility
[1:16:54] in which we were all born to
[1:16:56] do and brother Branham
[1:17:01] says that God didn't send us to be able
[1:17:03] to build great
[1:17:07] buildings God didn't send us to build
[1:17:09] great
[1:17:10] churches and all of that has its
[1:17:12] place it fulfills its
[1:17:16] purpose but he sent us onto
[1:17:20] Earth to be a
[1:17:24] this message throughout through the
[1:17:26] whole
[1:17:27] world and when I speak about the
[1:17:31] gospel obviously I do not refer myself
[1:17:33] only to the
[1:17:36] Bible I refer to my uh to the good
[1:17:39] [Applause]
[1:17:41] news I tell the people that I don't like
[1:17:43] the newspaper from
[1:17:45] yesterday I want fresh
[1:17:49] news not only shall Man live by bread
[1:17:54] but by every
[1:17:56] word that comes out of the mouth of
[1:18:00] God and that's the difference in between
[1:18:03] us and the
[1:18:06] denominational they eat of the
[1:18:09] bread they carry the same
[1:18:11] Bible they study the same
[1:18:15] Bible but the word of the Lord still
[1:18:18] says not only of
[1:18:20] bread not only of the Bible
[1:18:24] and it may sound a little off but it's
[1:18:27] not but
[1:18:29] also of every
[1:18:31] word that comes out of the mouth of
[1:18:34] God and God has a
[1:18:37] mouth the mouthpiece for our day Willam
[1:18:42] is William Mar
[1:18:45] brandham that's the name of the
[1:18:47] messenger of the
[1:18:48] day and
[1:18:50] US me
[1:18:54] we're only an echo of that
[1:18:57] voice I'm not looking for an eighth
[1:19:01] me God only has seven
[1:19:05] [Applause]
[1:19:08] eyes and I'm very grateful to be born in
[1:19:10] the days of this
[1:19:13] messenger so then what's our
[1:19:16] responsibility and I tell my
[1:19:21] wife
[1:19:23] I promised her that over there in glory
[1:19:26] I pr
[1:19:28] not I'll live for you and you will live
[1:19:30] for
[1:19:33] me and I look at my children and I've
[1:19:35] seen that I've made
[1:19:37] myself and deprived of seeing them grow
[1:19:41] up one day I came into my
[1:19:44] home and I opened the door without
[1:19:47] anybody
[1:19:49] knowing and I went into my room to
[1:19:51] surprise my wife
[1:19:54] and then all of a sudden I found a
[1:19:55] man sleeping next to
[1:19:59] her and I almost lost my
[1:20:05] mind and when I removed the bed sheet I
[1:20:07] saw that it was my older
[1:20:11] son and I had noticed that he had
[1:20:15] grown that's why every time that I
[1:20:18] can I give them
[1:20:21] love
[1:20:25] I a deep morning within for missing
[1:20:30] them and I thank God for the wife and
[1:20:32] kids that I
[1:20:35] have and I thank the Lord for the church
[1:20:37] that I
[1:20:39] attend for them to be able to share me
[1:20:42] with all of
[1:20:43] you and I always knew
[1:20:46] this what I wanted was a happy place to
[1:20:49] live in happy
[1:20:51] children
[1:20:53] a church to go
[1:20:55] to somewhere to have find
[1:21:00] Refuge where to go and heal the the
[1:21:02] wounds that the life brings
[1:21:06] them where to find the answers to the
[1:21:08] questions that I
[1:21:09] have where they can treat me
[1:21:13] well where they make me feel
[1:21:16] good I didn't
[1:21:19] know that God had called me
[1:21:23] to serve
[1:21:26] him to tell my
[1:21:28] brothers that Christ
[1:21:30] lives he has not
[1:21:33] died and in the same works that he
[1:21:40] did he is willing to do them again if
[1:21:43] we're willing to
[1:21:44] believe I don't have any
[1:21:47] doubts I divorced myself from
[1:21:51] them I know that Wherever I Go the signs
[1:21:53] will follow
[1:21:56] me I'm not here so that you can think
[1:21:59] something if you are children of
[1:22:02] God wherever you
[1:22:05] go the signs will follow
[1:22:10] you I know that wherever I go the power
[1:22:13] of Resurrection follows
[1:22:16] me forgiveness the grace the
[1:22:19] mercies the Divine
[1:22:21] Healing I believe in
[1:22:24] that but I'm not only speaking of
[1:22:28] myself I'm speaking of every
[1:22:31] child every son and daughter of
[1:22:37] God we are the very representation of
[1:22:40] the Lord Jesus Christ here on
[1:22:44] Earth here on Earth you are God's
[1:22:50] representation and one day I found
[1:22:51] myself
[1:22:58] and one Sunday like this someone began
[1:23:00] speaking in tongues onto me and one
[1:23:04] interpreting for God so loved this
[1:23:08] city he has
[1:23:12] Sosi so that everyone that believes in
[1:23:15] Him should not die but have everlasting
[1:23:19] life I almost pulled out all my hairs
[1:23:21] and I said this is the
[1:23:23] this is uh treason
[1:23:26] heresy but then I began to
[1:23:30] meditate and then I began to meditate
[1:23:34] in that each and every one of us is the
[1:23:36] very mercy of God for
[1:23:39] our we're the grace for our own family
[1:23:45] members we're the very Grace of those
[1:23:47] who have not heard the word of the Lord
[1:23:50] and while I'm
[1:23:51] speaking
[1:23:54] thousands and thousands of people are
[1:23:58] dying without ever having the
[1:24:02] opportunity to be able to hear the name
[1:24:04] of the Lord Jesus
[1:24:07] Christ so then when I ask
[1:24:12] myself then who's at fault for the
[1:24:14] darkness to
[1:24:15] grow then I look at
[1:24:19] myself and I realize that I have not
[1:24:21] done enough
[1:24:24] I realize that I have not preached
[1:24:27] enough and I realize that I have not
[1:24:29] surrendered
[1:24:32] myself oh Brothers we need to wake
[1:24:38] up realize the reason why God has sent
[1:24:41] us onto this
[1:24:43] Earth We're All ambassadors of Jesus
[1:24:50] Christ a prisoner of Jesus J Christ
[1:24:52] because of each and every one of
[1:24:55] you that's who we are my
[1:25:01] mother so if women were allowed to
[1:25:05] preach I would be quiet
[1:25:11] forever I would mute myself and sit down
[1:25:14] at her feet to learn from
[1:25:17] her when I went to the airport she told
[1:25:21] me everything will be
[1:25:23] [Applause]
[1:25:24] okay I will be on my
[1:25:29] knees leading unto God that he may
[1:25:31] Prosper your
[1:25:34] ways my mother is a missionary but she
[1:25:37] doesn't go out
[1:25:38] to but she is a
[1:25:41] missionary there's many ways of being
[1:25:43] able
[1:25:47] to now the missionary field is
[1:25:51] growing and the whole world is growing
[1:25:53] in
[1:25:56] hunger and the complete world is dying
[1:25:58] for an ounce of
[1:26:01] love and now I'm ashamed to be able to
[1:26:03] say or that my name is because that's
[1:26:06] our
[1:26:07] name I told the young man in the
[1:26:11] morning when I was
[1:26:15] 16 I went walking into my house about 8
[1:26:21] kilm I didn't have money to be able to
[1:26:23] say like you say over here to pay
[1:26:25] the I was walking I was looking down at
[1:26:28] the
[1:26:31] ground and hoping that I would find a
[1:26:33] Coin to be able to buy something from
[1:26:36] H and then all of a sudden I find a
[1:26:38] little pamphlet and it
[1:26:42] said I live in a dark
[1:26:45] country where Darkness
[1:26:48] thrives and in the thrives a shame
[1:26:53] the shame
[1:26:55] misery and in the misery a
[1:26:59] hand willing and to put forth their
[1:27:03] work to bring forth
[1:27:06] light to this dark
[1:27:10] country and I've haven't been able to
[1:27:12] forget about it after 40
[1:27:14] years and it keeps beating within my
[1:27:17] heart because Jesus
[1:27:20] said I am the light of the world
[1:27:24] and while I'm in the
[1:27:25] world I am the light of the
[1:27:29] world but knowing that the his hour was
[1:27:31] coming
[1:27:32] night he looked onto his disciples and
[1:27:34] he
[1:27:36] said you
[1:27:37] are the light of this
[1:27:41] world if the world is in
[1:27:44] darkness shall it be
[1:27:47] Lord should should it be that I
[1:27:51] don't
[1:27:53] and what good is the light if I hide
[1:27:55] it the light is not so that you can hide
[1:27:58] it the light is so that you can show
[1:28:02] up brothers and
[1:28:05] sisters the world is
[1:28:07] dying
[1:28:10] slowly for just a little bit of
[1:28:12] light for a little bit of
[1:28:15] love where is that
[1:28:18] love the love is
[1:28:20] hidden but let's wake it up
[1:28:23] stop wake up you who
[1:28:26] sleeps and Christ shall Enlighten
[1:28:29] you and this message that we have
[1:28:33] received is the same message that Jesus
[1:28:36] Christ
[1:28:38] preached it's the same message that the
[1:28:40] apostles
[1:28:44] preach it's the same message why the
[1:28:46] Apostle Paul gave his
[1:28:48] life the same
[1:28:51] message
[1:28:53] and this is a message of
[1:28:54] restoration it has the
[1:28:57] power to be able to bring us
[1:29:00] back to bring us back to the
[1:29:04] father and what was in that heart love
[1:29:10] love love for one
[1:29:12] another the missionary
[1:29:15] work involves
[1:29:20] love you can't support the
[1:29:23] missionary you need
[1:29:26] love a missionary heart is a the heart
[1:29:30] of a love for lost
[1:29:33] souls and brother Bram
[1:29:36] says it is very
[1:29:40] unjust to comb somebody two
[1:29:44] times and I'm already comb myself and I
[1:29:48] continue brother scari you're already
[1:29:51] combed
[1:29:52] it's so
[1:29:55] unjust to preach somebody the gospel two
[1:30:00] times and that breaks my
[1:30:05] heart so then I find out that we have a
[1:30:08] responsibility with our
[1:30:11] own because those who don't provide for
[1:30:13] their own home is
[1:30:17] wor but we have a responsibility for
[1:30:19] those that don't know
[1:30:23] you are the light of those three
[1:30:26] crosses you are the light of Las
[1:30:30] Cruses you are the light to the United
[1:30:34] States we are the light to the entire
[1:30:38] world and I'm not saying that everybody
[1:30:40] has to
[1:30:42] believe because the message has always
[1:30:44] been
[1:30:48] there it's been preached on to the great
[1:30:50] multitudes but it's for
[1:30:53] oh little
[1:30:57] flock you're not afraid for the it is
[1:30:59] God's
[1:31:01] will but we have to preach it to
[1:31:05] everybody so that nobody can be able to
[1:31:08] say that it's because of you that I
[1:31:09] never
[1:31:10] heard because of you I am
[1:31:15] lost if we can hear the voice of those
[1:31:17] that are
[1:31:20] asleep
[1:31:22] if we can hear the screaming and the
[1:31:23] shouting of all those that have gone on
[1:31:25] to
[1:31:26] the we have the
[1:31:30] Hope every day that I open up my eyes
[1:31:32] it's a
[1:31:33] miracle a miracle of
[1:31:38] life and it's the time to be able to get
[1:31:40] right with
[1:31:43] God it's the opportunity to be able to
[1:31:46] get right with
[1:31:49] our it's the opportunity to be able to
[1:31:52] say or to our wives
[1:31:54] forgive it's the time to be able to
[1:31:59] forgive and it's the opportunity to go
[1:32:06] worldwide and I'm not speaking about a
[1:32:08] dream or an
[1:32:13] illusion speaking about the cross that
[1:32:16] the Lord has called us and told us to
[1:32:18] carry the cross of
[1:32:20] Jesus was to die for the world
[1:32:25] completely that was the cross of
[1:32:30] Jesus to be able to purchase back that
[1:32:32] property that
[1:32:35] was be able to reclaim that which Adam
[1:32:38] had
[1:32:40] lost if you and I can be able to say
[1:32:42] that we're
[1:32:46] saved was because Jesus didn't never
[1:32:48] gave his back to his
[1:32:50] responsibility and he knew that he had a
[1:32:52] cross to
[1:32:55] be and just like him that he was given a
[1:32:58] cross each and every one of you as
[1:33:03] well
[1:33:07] Brothers constantly I I uh afflict
[1:33:12] myself I have a lot of things that I'm
[1:33:14] ashamed
[1:33:16] of if there was a time machine I would
[1:33:18] go and buy
[1:33:20] it to be able to prepare my
[1:33:23] mistakes to correct all of the
[1:33:26] wrongdoings
[1:33:30] mission if I would be able to go back to
[1:33:33] [Applause]
[1:33:37] 1980 the year that I found that pamphlet
[1:33:40] of Revelations
[1:33:45] 10:7 I would go back and dedicate my
[1:33:48] life to that very moment
[1:33:52] God didn't only call the
[1:33:55] elderly or the older people or
[1:33:59] the god also called the young
[1:34:02] people I didn't
[1:34:05] know that God had called me to be able
[1:34:07] to work in his
[1:34:10] kingdom I was so worried about finding
[1:34:13] uh Financial
[1:34:16] stability I was so worried in being able
[1:34:19] to build up a name for myself
[1:34:22] I didn't know that he had called
[1:34:25] me he had to tell me face to face one
[1:34:28] day that's the reason why I sent you to
[1:34:32] Earth for you to be a
[1:34:36] construction I've been a Mason worker
[1:34:38] for 25 years of my life and I still
[1:34:44] am the smell of of
[1:34:48] Steel I love smell of cement
[1:34:56] and when I walk into a building I can't
[1:34:57] do none less see how building is built I
[1:35:00] love the
[1:35:02] foundation I love the pillars and
[1:35:07] Foundations and I know that the most
[1:35:09] important part of this whole
[1:35:12] building are not the walls or the
[1:35:14] ceiling it's the
[1:35:16] foundation but the foundation you can't
[1:35:18] see it because it's hidden
[1:35:25] one time my teacher once told
[1:35:28] me I I hope that the Lord May one day
[1:35:30] allow you to be go deep and I told him
[1:35:34] of course I
[1:35:36] am uh we can speak a little bit about
[1:35:38] the
[1:35:41] return we can talk about a little bit of
[1:35:48] uh shot
[1:35:52] we can talk a little bit about the the
[1:35:55] tent I am very
[1:35:58] profound and my teacher once told
[1:36:01] me and what I told you that being deep
[1:36:05] is to go deep is down what do you want
[1:36:09] to look down
[1:36:10] for who wants to see the
[1:36:14] foundation who wants to do the first
[1:36:17] works we don't want to do the first
[1:36:19] works we only want the big
[1:36:22] to be able to construct our own name to
[1:36:25] build our own
[1:36:27] church but we need to look
[1:36:31] down the structure of this building this
[1:36:35] home rests upon
[1:36:39] two built upon
[1:36:44] the and Jesus Christ being the Chief
[1:36:47] Cornerstone we have to go back to the
[1:36:50] foundation
[1:36:53] Jesus told to all those that that knew
[1:36:55] the
[1:36:57] law but in the beginning it wasn't
[1:37:00] so it wasn't like that in the
[1:37:04] foundation we have to go back to the
[1:37:07] beginning this message brings us back
[1:37:11] to go and preach the gospel to every
[1:37:13] living
[1:37:15] creature and these signs shall follow
[1:37:17] them
[1:37:18] that in my name they shall cast out
[1:37:21] shall speak with new
[1:37:23] tongues shall raise the
[1:37:25] dead I have
[1:37:27] seen nobody has
[1:37:30] ever I have seen it with my own
[1:37:34] eyes I've seen a dead course in the
[1:37:39] name a God that we serve is not a god of
[1:37:42] History I believe in the
[1:37:44] history our history is our
[1:37:47] memory but Jesus Christ is the same from
[1:37:50] yesterday
[1:37:52] tomorrow but he's also the same
[1:37:55] today the only thing that we have need
[1:37:58] of is to
[1:38:04] believe who has believed our
[1:38:09] report oh brother let's go on reporting
[1:38:12] the Gospel of Jesus
[1:38:15] Christ but then we find ourselves with
[1:38:16] the roadblock of
[1:38:19] unb but the unbelief doesn't hinder
[1:38:22] God God is the
[1:38:25] same he multiplies the bread heals the
[1:38:30] sick he opens the eyes to the
[1:38:34] blind he makes the the lame
[1:38:37] walk and that's the God that I
[1:38:41] preach and the God that I present unto
[1:38:43] you this
[1:38:46] morning give an Applause to that God
[1:38:49] this
[1:38:50] morning
[1:38:53] blessed be the
[1:38:56] name of the Lord Jesus
[1:38:58] [Applause]
[1:39:01] Christ but why is it that Darkness has
[1:39:07] magnified brother Fabio said
[1:39:11] yesterday the message is the Fountain of
[1:39:14] our
[1:39:18] inspiration I love him but I don't have
[1:39:20] to hear him to be to inspire
[1:39:24] myself our inspiration comes solely from
[1:39:27] this
[1:39:29] message and in this message we find
[1:39:31] Little Golden
[1:39:33] nuggets oh how I love those little
[1:39:35] golden
[1:39:37] nuggets gold is
[1:39:40] deity and brother bam
[1:39:46] says that sin has grown because we have
[1:39:50] not
[1:39:52] we have not forfeited our own
[1:39:55] thoughts we haven't forfeited our own
[1:40:00] works and we have not denied our own
[1:40:04] selves and the only
[1:40:08] way that the that hell
[1:40:15] will because the Bible says that the
[1:40:17] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[1:40:19] it
[1:40:24] amen it's that we must love one
[1:40:33] another it's that we must not only
[1:40:35] preach about the cross but we
[1:40:38] must what good is the cross if we don't
[1:40:40] get on
[1:40:42] it what good is it to be a sheep if we
[1:40:44] don't
[1:40:46] die Peter had found a
[1:40:49] sheep
[1:40:52] you're the Lamb of God that takes away
[1:40:53] the sin of the
[1:40:54] world that no let nobody touch
[1:40:57] him don't let nobody do any
[1:41:01] harm and when he found out that the land
[1:41:03] was going to
[1:41:05] Jerusalem no you're I'm not letting you
[1:41:08] pass I will not let
[1:41:10] you you are my
[1:41:13] lamb I will not let anything happen to
[1:41:19] you get behind me
[1:41:26] Satan Peter had not understand
[1:41:29] yet that not only did a lamb was a
[1:41:33] lamb but also that the lamb must
[1:41:37] die because if it did not
[1:41:41] die we would all be completely
[1:41:47] lost oh and how do we thank God for that
[1:41:49] sacrifice of the Lamb
[1:41:54] nonetheless the scriptures have a double
[1:41:56] or double
[1:41:59] meaning and just the same as the Lamb of
[1:42:02] God
[1:42:03] died we
[1:42:05] also the
[1:42:07] lamb must
[1:42:11] die and the Sheep of
[1:42:14] raise if you don't raise your hand
[1:42:16] you're not a
[1:42:19] lamb what good is
[1:42:22] if it does not
[1:42:23] die now I understand my
[1:42:26] mother my mom once told me
[1:42:29] stop stop getting so
[1:42:34] desperate stop looking at the
[1:42:36] process die for
[1:42:40] them so that the just die for me I'll
[1:42:43] die for
[1:42:44] them but that's what it's all
[1:42:47] about to die for my
[1:42:49] children to die for my
[1:42:52] wife to die for my
[1:42:54] family to die for my
[1:42:57] friends to die for the
[1:43:00] congregation because if the lamb doesn't
[1:43:04] die it would be no of good
[1:43:06] use but who wants to
[1:43:09] die nobody wants to
[1:43:11] die we all want to
[1:43:16] live Jesus said if the wheat doesn't
[1:43:19] fall to the ground and die
[1:43:21] you cannot bring forth
[1:43:24] life brothers and
[1:43:28] sisters I love you in the name of the
[1:43:30] Lord Jesus
[1:43:32] Christ I feel privileged and
[1:43:37] honored be able to stand behind this
[1:43:39] pulit where great men have
[1:43:41] stood and who am I I'm just an
[1:43:45] usher in which God has permitted to
[1:43:49] preach
[1:43:51] love one
[1:43:53] another up to the
[1:43:55] point that you would
[1:43:57] die
[1:44:00] voluntarily so that someone else may
[1:44:04] live I
[1:44:06] die in every
[1:44:08] breath in every
[1:44:11] breath in every word that comes out of
[1:44:13] my mouth I'm
[1:44:16] dying so that someone else may
[1:44:19] live if we stop
[1:44:23] preaching how will believe the Bible
[1:44:27] says if there's no one to preach
[1:44:29] him and how are they going to
[1:44:32] preach if there's nobody to
[1:44:35] send this is our
[1:44:38] mission this is our
[1:44:40] [Applause]
