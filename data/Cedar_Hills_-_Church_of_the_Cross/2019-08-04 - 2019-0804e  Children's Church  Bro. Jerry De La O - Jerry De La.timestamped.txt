[23:45] big lorry
[23:49] logo
[23:54] [Music]
[24:03] this afternoon
[24:05] man the children excited excited for
[24:11] God's Word I didn't dress up fancy today
[24:15] I just came normal I want to scare
[24:19] anybody but I mean I've had a hard week
[24:25] yeah
[24:26] which ladies hard week it's tough isn't
[24:30] it I had a hard week myself and that's
[24:35] kind of what brought me to this topic
[24:37] because there was things that I was
[24:39] trying to do different things that I was
[24:41] trying to do during the week trying to
[24:44] get things done and working on different
[24:46] things and everywhere I turned I got the
[24:49] door slammed in my face it's kind of
[24:53] weird huh
[24:54] strange you know I try to do something
[24:57] here and door got shut try it another
[25:01] thing in a door got shut so I'm gonna
[25:04] speak a little bit on temptation how
[25:08] many know what temptation is right what
[25:12] is temptation brother
[25:17] uh-huh there we'll attempt you to do
[25:19] something really bad huh our tries to
[25:22] anyway right but how many know what this
[25:24] is right here what is it it's a doorknob
[25:29] right it's got a door it's got a handle
[25:32] inside and out it's got a lock on it
[25:36] right so when you put the when you put
[25:39] these things together this thing in the
[25:41] middle right here this is what keeps the
[25:43] door from opening and closing right so
[25:49] when you put this on the door and it's
[25:52] functioning correctly and the doors
[25:54] closed they can't open by itself right
[25:57] doors though doors don't open by
[26:00] accident yes or no right unless you
[26:04] don't close it all the way right you
[26:08] know sometimes I be sitting in the house
[26:10] and all of a sudden the door just blows
[26:12] wide open right away so oh yeah somebody
[26:14] wants to come in Oh sometimes we just
[26:16] don't close the door all the way you
[26:19] know that and that and that's what led
[26:20] me to this thought is temptation because
[26:24] Jesus was tempted right did Jesus get
[26:27] tempted you go to the scripture Matthew
[26:31] 4:1 right who wants to read that for me
[26:36] Matthew chapter 4 verse 1 go right ahead
[26:42] brother
[26:48] when then when Jesus then was Jesus led
[26:51] up of the spirit into the wilderness to
[26:54] be tempted of the devil so Jesus was
[26:57] tempted right so we we shouldn't be no
[27:00] different
[27:01] yes right the devil will tempt you guys
[27:07] all the time right that's why I said
[27:09] think you got you got this door knob
[27:12] opens and closes it even has a lock
[27:14] right so how many young kids here have
[27:18] done something wrong right I guess we're
[27:25] all young kids huh I continue to do
[27:28] wrong to sometimes but how many have
[27:30] done wrong okay
[27:32] and was it ever your fault of course not
[27:40] right I don't know maybe some yeah but I
[27:43] know when I was growing up with my
[27:44] brothers and sisters and something bad
[27:46] happened it wasn't my fault right we
[27:51] always wanted to blame somebody else and
[27:56] that's kind of the way the world is
[27:57] today nobody wants to take
[27:59] responsibility for their actions I did
[28:05] it I did something wrong I remember I
[28:08] beat up my brother at one time you know
[28:12] he was bloody nose and I act I don't
[28:14] know Mom the dog must have did it that's
[28:18] what I said I didn't why I was afraid to
[28:20] get in trouble but every every time we
[28:24] get in trouble we always wanted to blame
[28:26] somebody else yes or no we didn't we
[28:29] didn't want to take responsibility but
[28:33] that's why this door knob goes to a door
[28:39] and when temptation comes you got to
[28:44] shut that door right you got to shut it
[28:48] and then of course we choose if we want
[28:51] to open it or not right because doors
[28:55] don't open accidentally so the devil
[28:58] comes we got to shut that door and we
[29:00] got to close it
[29:02] because he's not afraid to shut the door
[29:03] on us when we're trying to do something
[29:05] right when you're trying to do good the
[29:08] devil will come in he'll try and shut
[29:10] the door on you right
[29:11] he's Trey he's tried on me so what
[29:15] what's what's different between you and
[29:17] I this afternoon there's no difference
[29:21] which we choose what doors to open and
[29:24] close because temptation has many doors
[29:29] there's many doors of temptation you
[29:32] know of course you guys are younger you
[29:34] know and I'm sure your parents ask you
[29:38] will you take out the trash right and
[29:43] what is our first reaction right I don't
[29:48] want to right how come you forgot to
[29:55] take out the trash
[29:55] I don't know it wasn't my fault I
[29:58] started to play next box there's a
[30:01] temptation right there yes his xbox
[30:04] plain plain Xbox is it bad not
[30:09] necessarily but if you're on it all day
[30:12] long and you're forgetting to do what
[30:14] you're supposed to do then the devil's
[30:16] got you he tempted you and he got you
[30:18] and so you opened that door to that but
[30:23] the next time he comes you shut that
[30:24] door right in his face you slammed the
[30:28] door in his face and you locked it and
[30:31] you don't open it that's what the
[30:32] doorknob does he when you when you when
[30:34] you have it this is locked right now
[30:35] it's not gonna open you don't lock it Oh
[30:40] broke it I guess but see this thing
[30:43] right here this is what opens and closes
[30:45] the door this little latch right here
[30:47] when it's it when it pull back in the
[30:49] door the doors gonna open but when this
[30:52] isn't the thing the door don't open so
[30:54] it can open by accident we got to open
[30:57] it I gotta open it so when the devil
[31:00] comes and he says talk back to your
[31:04] parents slam it in his face shut her in
[31:09] his face because Jesus were tempted many
[31:12] times right
[31:14] because it says if you if you read more
[31:16] in in in the scripture if you read on
[31:23] down it says he took him he was hungry
[31:29] right when the devil took him up when he
[31:32] went up into the mountains in the
[31:33] devil's temper he got hungry yes and
[31:36] what did the devil tell him what do you
[31:39] tell him turn in turn these stones into
[31:42] bread right and see whenever you're
[31:46] tempted there's a way to fight the devil
[31:49] how many know the best way to fight the
[31:52] devil the Bible you use God's word
[31:56] against him right you use God's word
[31:59] against the devil and that's what Jesus
[32:01] did here
[32:02] because what did he say to him anybody
[32:10] and shall not live by bread alone right
[32:14] he uses he used God's Word and that's
[32:17] what we need to do the devil comes and
[32:18] we gotta use God's Word to defeat the
[32:21] devil we gotta use God's Word to close
[32:23] that door stop him in his tracks don't
[32:29] let him get any farther because he'll
[32:33] tempt and tempt and tempt and what he's
[32:35] trying to do he's trying to distract us
[32:41] when he's tempting you he's trying to
[32:43] distract you he's trying to to keep you
[32:47] from realizing the young ladies you
[32:51] should be and the young men you should
[32:54] be because the devil don't care how old
[32:57] we are
[32:58] he don't he'll try and defeat you any
[33:03] way he can but we got the greatest word
[33:07] what does brother Branham say God's word
[33:09] is he says drop that atomic bomb on him
[33:14] right drop that atomic word of God on
[33:18] Satan and it will stop every temptation
[33:21] we have every temptation because it's
[33:25] going to come
[33:27] even even right now guys I'm sure you
[33:30] guys had different temptations right the
[33:32] devil has tempted you in many ways right
[33:36] how many go to school getting ready to
[33:39] start school aren't we right maybe
[33:43] sometimes you want to act up a little
[33:44] bit in class why are you laughing at me
[33:52] how are you laughing at me something
[33:56] sometimes we do how we want to act up in
[33:58] class and that's not good because when
[34:00] we get in trouble see that's a
[34:04] temptation right there talking back to
[34:07] the teachers that's not good huh that
[34:15] should be what respectable you got to be
[34:19] respectable that's what he was trying to
[34:23] say you got to be respectable right we
[34:27] got it we got to start young better
[34:31] start even as we get older we got to be
[34:33] respectable I tell you what when I went
[34:36] to school I was a horrible kid I was III
[34:40] I was horrible I was bad I talked back I
[34:47] didn't listen
[34:48] I say words that I shouldn't say right
[34:53] because that's the temptation when
[34:55] you're in school with our friends right
[34:58] we want to be cool right
[35:02] Bryn Jonathan one we wanted to be cool I
[35:05] wanted to be cool so then I start saying
[35:08] things that shouldn't be saying started
[35:13] saying things I shouldn't be saying and
[35:15] I tell you an experience I had I got
[35:19] home from school one day and I didn't
[35:22] realize my mom had had a parent-teacher
[35:24] conference with the principal well next
[35:27] thing you know I got home I got so put
[35:28] in my mouth that's not a good feeling
[35:33] see but that's why we got to close every
[35:36] single door every single door to
[35:40] temptation err
[35:41] single door to the devil because there
[35:43] are many doors out there you know he's
[35:45] gonna want you to talk back he's gonna
[35:46] want you to do to do different things
[35:48] not listen to your parents and then as
[35:51] you get older things getting even worse
[35:54] and then she get older than that things
[35:56] will get even worse but if we stop it if
[35:59] we shut that door shut the door close it
[36:02] in his face and say you are not welcome
[36:04] here you kick him out shut the door
[36:07] don't let him back in he's the only way
[36:12] he gets in is if we let him that's the
[36:16] only way he's coming back in right
[36:20] because if he fought him if you read
[36:22] from from from Mark Matthew for 1
[36:25] through 10 he tempted him that whole
[36:28] time right he told him bow to me he says
[36:33] take a look at all this this could be
[36:34] yours if you bow to me he fought him
[36:39] with God's Word right and that's what
[36:42] you and I have to do we have to fight
[36:44] him with God's Word we have to we have
[36:46] to close the door in his face we have to
[36:51] listen to our parents we have to listen
[36:53] to the word we have to read God's Word
[36:57] because if we don't read God's Word or
[36:59] read the Bible then how are we gonna
[37:01] know not to fight him right right we got
[37:07] we gotta we gotta read gotta hear his
[37:10] word he attention to his word close the
[37:14] door in his face because he doesn't stop
[37:18] how many are children of God this
[37:22] afternoon right every single one of your
[37:25] hands should go up we are all children
[37:27] of God even to even to this day he's
[37:31] still trying to stop me to realize Who I
[37:34] am because he don't like that and that's
[37:38] what he's starting he's gonna start if
[37:40] he hasn't started already he's gonna try
[37:43] and stop you from realizing the young
[37:45] men and young women and young ladies
[37:48] that you should be right
[37:53] because there is in the end there is
[37:56] consequences to our actions there is
[38:01] consequences to our actions I did
[38:07] something and there was a consequence
[38:08] that I had to pay but I opened the door
[38:11] to that now I got it now when she opened
[38:13] the door it's your responsibility to
[38:15] shut it when I just said it you gotta
[38:17] clean him out but not once you clean it
[38:20] out you got to fill it up with something
[38:24] right you got to fill it up with
[38:27] something watching we fill it up with
[38:30] the Word of God they fill it up with a
[38:36] Word of God
[38:37] don't leave it empty because if you
[38:39] leave it empty what is he gonna do he's
[38:43] gonna peek in the window said oh he
[38:46] cleaned it out but they didn't put
[38:47] nothing back in it that's my spot right
[38:49] there that's my bedroom he's gonna say I
[38:51] want him I want back in and he's gonna
[38:54] knock but don't open it don't don't open
[39:00] the door to the to to the devil don't
[39:02] open the door to their patients because
[39:04] there is many many out there many many
[39:07] things out there many many bad things
[39:11] and and as I as I get ready to close I
[39:15] would like to say something here you
