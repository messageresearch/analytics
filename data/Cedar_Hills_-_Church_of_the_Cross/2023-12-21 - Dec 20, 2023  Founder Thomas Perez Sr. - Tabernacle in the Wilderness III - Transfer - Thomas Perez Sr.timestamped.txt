[14:18] morning just one word
[14:27] transfer
[14:29] transfer it wrs this way in Daniel 7:9 I
[14:33] watched till Thrones were put in
[14:36] place and the Ancient of Days was
[14:39] seated His Garment was white as snow and
[14:43] the hair of his head was like pure wool
[14:46] his throne was a fiery flame its Wheels
[14:50] a burning
[14:57] fire
[15:12] a fiery stream issued and came forth
[15:16] from before him a thousand thousands
[15:19] ministered to
[15:21] him 10,000 times 10,000 stood before
[15:25] him the court was seated
[15:29] and the books were
[15:47] opened I watched then because of the
[15:50] sound of The pompus
[15:52] Words which the horn was speaking I
[15:56] watched till the till the Beast was
[15:59] slain and its body destroyed and given
[16:02] to the Burning
[16:09] [Music]
[16:18] Flame as for the rest of the Beast they
[16:22] had their Dominion taken away yet their
[16:25] lives were prolonged for a season and a
[16:27] Time
[16:38] I was watching in the night visions and
[16:40] behold one like the son of man coming
[16:44] with a Clouds Of Heaven he came to the
[16:46] Ancient of Days and they brought him
[16:49] near before
[16:57] him
[17:07] then to him I want you to watch closely
[17:10] here then to him was given dominion and
[17:15] glory and a
[17:27] kingdom
[17:29] that all peoples Nations and languages
[17:33] should serve
[17:41] him his Dominion is an everlasting
[17:45] [Music]
[17:50] Dominion which shall not pass away and
[17:54] his kingdom the one which shall will not
[17:58] be
[18:07] destroyed amen may the Lord add His
[18:09] blessings to the reading of the word let
[18:11] us
[18:16] pray father we have read a portion of
[18:18] thy holy
[18:22] word we report for service at this
[18:27] time
[18:29] we pray that your holy spirit will come
[18:32] upon your
[18:36] children I Surrender myself to thee this
[18:39] morning
[18:42] Lord take me Lord and use me as you
[18:45] would
[18:49] have bless your
[18:53] children heal the
[18:57] sick
[18:59] bind the
[19:03] Brokenhearted set at Liberty the
[19:09] captives for we come in the name of the
[19:12] Lord Jesus
[19:16] Christ bless us
[19:19] now in Heavenly
[19:22] places in Christ
[19:25] Jesus amen amen you may be
[19:37] seated in the Book of
[19:42] Genesis
[19:46] 128 it's showing us here how God blessed
[19:54] them and God said to
[19:57] them
[19:59] be fruitful and
[20:03] multiply and fill the
[20:08] Earth subdue
[20:11] it have dominion over the fish of the
[20:18] sea over the birds of the
[20:22] air and over every living thing that
[20:25] moves on the
[20:27] Earth
[20:29] how many here believe and understand
[20:32] that Jesus Paid the price at
[20:39] Calvary I guess not everybody let's
[20:42] raise your hands if believe that amen we
[20:46] we must confess
[20:48] this I I believe
[20:51] that but even though he paid the
[20:57] price we still have a lot of
[21:01] problems is that
[21:03] right even though he paid the
[21:07] price the devil is still the
[21:12] devil he is the Bible calls him a
[21:15] roaring
[21:18] lion you ever heard a roaring
[21:23] lion amen and he is
[21:27] seeking
[21:29] whom he can
[21:32] devour and he will
[21:36] devour anything that is not inside the
[21:42] kingdom that's why it
[21:45] says that his
[21:48] Dominion is an everlasting
[21:53] Dominion that shall not be
[21:57] destroyed
[21:59] today we look at the Middle
[22:02] East and everybody is in expectation of
[22:07] whether we are going to war or we're not
[22:09] going to go to
[22:14] war but what we are seeing and being
[22:17] Witnesses
[22:21] of is nothing else but what is written
[22:25] in the
[22:26] Bible
[22:29] it's coming to what is called the
[22:31] Judgment of the
[22:36] Nations we don't look to these
[22:40] kingdoms we look to another
[22:44] kingdom now when the Lord told his
[22:50] disciples he said when they asked him
[22:52] teach us how to
[22:56] pray he said he said pray in this
[23:01] manner he said thy kingdom
[23:05] come thy will be
[23:09] done on
[23:11] Earth as it is in
[23:14] heaven so then the will of
[23:19] God is to be accomplished here on the
[23:24] earth when we receive the Lord
[23:30] as our our personal
[23:33] Savior and we receive the Holy
[23:37] Spirit we're receiving a shadow of a
[23:41] shadow of a
[23:44] shadow we receive what is called the
[23:47] earnest of
[23:53] it amen we receive that
[23:56] amen but as long as we don't hold the
[24:00] abstract title deed in our
[24:06] hands amen we don't have full possession
[24:10] of
[24:13] it we know that Adam lost he forfeited
[24:17] his his title
[24:21] did we all have read this and understand
[24:26] this I am I am moving into a cycle this
[24:32] morning because we're going from a
[24:35] shadow to a shadow to a
[24:39] shadow but we want to come into that
[24:42] Perfect Light Of
[24:46] God Amen so then when we receive the
[24:51] Lord amen we receive him as our
[24:56] savior
[24:58] the Bible
[25:00] says and the the the prophet tells
[25:04] us Satan's dirty hands could not keep
[25:08] this book in his
[25:13] hands and he says it went back to the
[25:16] original
[25:21] owner but it it won't do you a bit of
[25:25] good if it stays in the hands of the
[25:31] owner but the owner had given this to
[25:36] somebody and it had been
[25:39] lost and he had to bring it
[25:43] back the Original Seed had to be
[25:49] restored and in order for him to do
[25:53] it he had to come as a near Kinsman
[26:00] Redeemer but let me take the word near
[26:03] and just put Kinsman before
[26:08] it amen how many understand
[26:11] this so then I don't want to take too
[26:14] much time on this because you've heard
[26:16] all these
[26:18] things but we
[26:21] understand that in
[26:26] 1963 what body repeat after me
[26:32] 1963 amen God confirmed the
[26:38] contract he confirmed it and gave it to
[26:41] the seventh
[26:45] angel we know we know that the angel
[26:48] comes at the end of the
[26:52] age and at the end of the
[26:56] age was when this angel
[27:00] came and he came to rebuke
[27:06] lady because they thought they had
[27:10] everything but he said they were
[27:14] naked they they they needed
[27:17] oil they needed to be
[27:20] dressed to see that God was bringing the
[27:24] kingdom down to the
[27:26] Earth
[27:30] that's why the kingdom that God was
[27:34] given was an everlasting
[27:38] Kingdom amen how many understand
[27:41] that now the Bible tells
[27:45] us if you would turn in your Bibles I'm
[27:48] not going to read it I'm just going to
[27:49] be quoting these
[27:53] scriptures in in Revelations
[27:56] 31
[27:59] now if you notice in Daniel
[28:02] 7 it says till Thrones were cast
[28:07] down now the Bible says
[28:11] here to him that
[28:15] overcometh will I grant him to sit in my
[28:20] throne and the prophet interprets that
[28:23] and says in my
[28:26] domain
[28:28] not everybody can sit in that
[28:33] Kingdom it says to the
[28:37] Overcomer now when it says
[28:41] Overcomer the Bible tells us the prophet
[28:45] shows
[28:47] us it says to
[28:50] overcome you must keep life inside of
[28:56] you
[28:58] not the light out
[29:00] here the light has to come inside of
[29:05] you that's the only
[29:08] way that you and I can
[29:12] overcome you cannot overcome by being a
[29:15] religious
[29:17] person you cannot overcome by memorizing
[29:20] the
[29:23] Bible the only way that you and I are
[29:26] going to make it out of
[29:29] here keep life inside of
[29:34] us and that life is the light of the
[29:39] man that's the life that he gave
[29:43] us
[29:46] amen now according to the
[29:52] word I'm going to turn it a little
[29:56] bit
[29:58] there's three
[30:02] Bibles but in
[30:05] actuality there's four
[30:09] Bibles that's right there's three
[30:14] steps in the
[30:19] journey but there are actually
[30:24] Four amen amen
[30:27] I I I remember when brother brandham was
[30:31] went amongst the Pentecostal
[30:36] people and and they put that old colored
[30:39] man to
[30:43] preach and he said why why do they put
[30:45] such an old man they should have put a
[30:47] young
[30:50] guy said he was about 90 some years
[30:55] old he said but you you you've heard all
[30:58] these preachers preach about these
[31:00] things down here on
[31:04] Earth he says but I'm going to take you
[31:09] before he said he went up to the
[31:13] heavenlies and he said he brought down
[31:16] that horizontal
[31:21] rainbow he said after a
[31:24] while Bob Willard was ching to
[31:29] him there ain't enough room for me up
[31:33] here brother Bram says if if if that
[31:36] made that old man do
[31:39] that what will it do a young
[31:42] man think about it when he brought him
[31:48] down we see the
[31:50] Bible and and it was written first in
[31:53] the
[31:55] skies it was called the
[31:58] zodiac then he brought down to the
[32:02] pyramid and then the word was put in
[32:06] book
[32:08] form it's called the
[32:11] Bible everybody reads the
[32:14] Bible everybody that goes to church
[32:17] reads the
[32:19] Bible that calls himself a
[32:22] Christian these
[32:24] words were written by the Holy
[32:29] Spirit but actually they were they were
[32:33] men of all wrote this
[32:38] Bible they were inspired by the Holy
[32:42] Spirit now we find also another
[32:47] thing if we want to break these
[32:51] Bibles the
[32:53] Zodiac the
[32:56] pyramid and the book which which we
[32:59] called the
[33:03] Bible how many have a
[33:05] Bible let's erase your
[33:07] bibl beautiful
[33:10] beautiful don't
[33:12] forget we're raising the
[33:15] Bible we're raising the
[33:18] standard let's see you raise the
[33:21] Zodiac you can't stop there raise the
[33:25] pyramid you can't it's in Egypt raise
[33:30] this everybody raise this we have this
[33:34] in book
[33:36] form we have another thing with
[33:40] us which is called
[33:46] tapes they didn't have magnetic
[33:50] tap but they had
[33:52] scripes and they would they would write
[33:55] everything that Paul was
[33:59] saying when the prophet was
[34:02] here it came on Magnetic
[34:05] Tape amen amen all right now I want you
[34:09] to notice
[34:12] carefully I don't want to stay too long
[34:14] and explain all these little
[34:18] details because I want to get to
[34:22] something I want you to be in
[34:24] expectation of something
[34:29] the prophet of
[34:30] God had three pools in his
[34:36] ministry amen the first
[34:39] pool the second
[34:41] Po and the third
[34:44] pole we could call him three
[34:48] stages amen we also notice that the that
[34:52] that seventh
[34:55] seal that third
[34:58] P had three parts to
[35:01] it he said something happened today or
[35:08] yesterday he said and another one
[35:13] today the other one came in an unknown
[35:18] language now this is what I want to get
[35:23] to when we saw these pictures that were
[35:26] placed here by
[35:30] brother we find six six of those
[35:36] ages now he said the seventh one had not
[35:40] been completely covered with
[35:45] Darkness he said there was a little
[35:47] light left in
[35:50] it we find that when the prophet
[35:55] came he preached to us
[35:57] six
[35:59] seals and those six
[36:03] seals was the book of
[36:07] redemption that Redemption was to show
[36:10] us the
[36:14] plan he said in the first seal this is
[36:18] the plan of
[36:21] God how many how many want to know God's
[36:24] plan you should be be very enthused
[36:27] about
[36:30] this
[36:31] plan this is what he has for
[36:36] you this is what he has for
[36:40] me I believe
[36:42] today that if we had not known his
[36:47] plan my wife would not be here with
[36:51] us according to his
[36:54] plan it let us see something
[36:58] that the human mind cannot
[37:02] comprehend beyond
[37:06] that when the churches
[37:09] preach when the churches
[37:12] preach when they continue to
[37:15] preach it it's easy to preach Jesus
[37:19] Christ of
[37:24] yesterday it's easy to
[37:27] it's easy to preach
[37:30] that now when when John was
[37:35] commissioned in the aisle of
[37:40] pedmas this were the instructions given
[37:44] to
[37:47] him
[37:50] write
[37:52] write all the things that you have
[37:55] seen
[37:58] the things which
[38:01] are and the things that shall be
[38:07] Hereafter it is
[38:10] easy when you have a
[38:13] mind and you can
[38:16] study to give
[38:19] history and explain everything in
[38:25] detail but toing bring him to the
[38:29] scene it takes something
[38:32] else it doesn't take your
[38:36] mind but it takes your
[38:40] surrendering and a
[38:43] recognition that he is the
[38:46] same yesterday today and
[38:50] forever I am not
[38:53] preaching a Christ of yesterday but a
[38:57] Christ of
[38:58] today and if he is with
[39:03] us then we must manifest
[39:07] it because if we don't
[39:10] manifest we are being
[39:13] Liars we really don't believe
[39:15] him today not yesterday I know what he
[39:19] did yesterday but I want to know what he
[39:23] is
[39:24] today in my life
[39:27] in your life that's the resurrected
[39:30] Christ in every
[39:33] detail except the Corporal
[39:41] body that's the expectation I want to
[39:43] get you to
[39:47] this we have seen
[39:51] teachers explain to
[39:54] you how a man can blow away
[40:01] this that's good that's good
[40:05] teaching we can see how balloons can go
[40:10] up but we want to see more than that
[40:14] this
[40:15] morning we want to see a
[40:18] Deliverance bringing it from a
[40:21] shadow to a shadow to a shadow until the
[40:25] perfect light
[40:27] with
[40:30] us but we must recognize
[40:34] it in our
[40:37] midst read your
[40:39] Bible and bring him out of
[40:44] here I say again read your Bible and
[40:47] bring him out of
[40:51] here bring him out of
[40:55] this take him out of here come and pray
[41:00] and I'm not saying for you not to pray
[41:01] because you must be prayed
[41:04] up come and pray and bring him out of
[41:08] [Applause]
[41:11] there fast until you ain't got no W
[41:16] left and I'm not saying you shouldn't
[41:19] fast CU some of you go out here saying
[41:21] you don't believe in praying and
[41:24] fasting I pray more and we pray more and
[41:29] fast more than people that are on their
[41:35] knes sometimes we're on
[41:38] trips I fast from my
[41:44] wife my children my
[41:48] friends I pray whether I'm driving I
[41:52] don't have to be kneeling down
[41:54] today Bible says we pray
[41:57] all the
[41:58] time pray without
[42:01] chasing I don't know how many hours at
[42:03] night you

[45:05] cry why did he cry because of what he
[45:09] saw in
[45:12] heav
[45:14] amen now the book of
[45:18] redemption was
[45:20] opened so we could understand the Plan
[45:23] of
[45:24] Redemption
[45:28] amen
[45:30] now I want
[45:32] to I want to read a
[45:35] scripture in Revelations
[45:38] 10 I'm going to hurry as much as I can
[45:41] to save
[45:44] time because I I know I know
[45:48] myself amen Revelations 10 and it says
[45:54] that he saw an angel Angel come down
[45:56] from
[45:59] heaven clothed with a
[46:03] cloud a rainbow was on his
[46:07] head his face was like the
[46:10] sun his feet like pillars of
[46:14] fire he had a little book
[46:17] open in his
[46:19] hand he set his right foot on the sea
[46:22] and his left foot on the
[46:24] land
[46:26] cried with a loud
[46:28] voice when a lion
[46:31] roars when he cried
[46:33] out seven Thunders uttered their
[46:37] voices when the seven Thunders uttered
[46:40] their
[46:41] voices I was about to
[46:44] write he had to
[46:46] write because the commission was for him
[46:49] to write
[46:51] everything as he was about to
[46:54] write all of a sudden the angel said
[46:58] don't write
[47:01] this this takes my own personal
[47:06] touch I will write
[47:10] this no one else will write
[47:13] this I will write this in their
[47:18] hearts it won't be in this
[47:22] paper it will be in heart hearts of
[47:27] Flesh where he was going to
[47:31] write and let me tell you one thing no
[47:35] one can write
[47:37] it John is a type of the
[47:40] Bride the bride cannot write
[47:44] this
[47:49] finger the things that are for his
[47:52] people his will and your will you must
[47:57] find out his
[47:59] will for you to
[48:01] do what has commissioned what has been
[48:05] commissioned for you to do
[48:11] here let me tell you something about
[48:13] this
[48:16] light God told
[48:21] Moses build me a
[48:24] tabernacle
[48:27] according to the fashion that you have
[48:29] seen
[48:33] it now this
[48:36] Tabernacle we call it the Tabernacle in
[48:39] the
[48:42] wilderness in the desert of
[48:46] Si amen now the Tabernacle was fashioned
[48:51] in such a
[48:54] way
[48:56] that you would see the outer cord out
[49:01] here amen and that got what is called
[49:05] Cosmic
[49:09] light inside the
[49:14] that was a little
[49:17] room that was separated into
[49:23] two one was the Holy place
[49:27] that did not have Cosmic
[49:32] light but it had candle
[49:35] lamp
[49:37] Candlestick or he says
[49:44] lampstand that still wasn't the True
[49:50] Light but there was another
[49:54] Veil you know I
[49:56] knew this since I was in
[50:00] denomination but really I didn't know
[50:05] it I knew how to read it I I used to
[50:09] enjoy
[50:11] it but there was a
[50:14] veil and it's called the veil of self
[50:19] will can everybody say self
[50:23] will self will is you
[50:26] don't look to
[50:28] nobody self go like
[50:31] this
[50:33] self you th
[50:36] this behind this other
[50:38] veil was where the sh or Shina glory of
[50:42] God would come
[50:45] down only in this
[50:48] place no one was permitted in
[50:52] there only the high
[50:54] priest only once a
[50:57] year Moses was called by the pillar of
[51:03] fire amen and who went with
[51:07] Moses was J for six
[51:11] days the P
[51:13] fire the
[51:15] cloud was there but on the seventh
[51:19] day God Called Moses inside this
[51:24] cloud Joshua couldn't go in only Moses
[51:28] could go
[51:29] in anybody went in there it was death
[51:34] because it was a
[51:36] type of what was
[51:38] coming since the Garden of
[51:41] Eden when the
[51:43] sherim were placed there to guard the
[51:49] entrance amen poor interpreter I I'll
[51:52] Tire them
[51:54] out you tired my
[52:07] voice
[52:09] amen now we
[52:12] find that Moses was taken to this
[52:18] place but I want to read a scripture
[52:20] found in second
[52:23] Corinthians chapter
[52:27] three amen don't you love the
[52:30] Lord this is his
[52:33] word amen second Corinthians
[52:38] 3 praise
[52:42] God give my interpreter a breather
[52:48] here
[52:51] 36 remember that Tabernacle in the
[52:54] wilderness
[52:57] remember the seven Church
[53:00] ages Israel had seven Church
[53:03] ages
[53:05] amen who also made us sufficient as
[53:08] Ministers of the New
[53:12] Covenant go
[53:17] ahead not of the
[53:20] letter but of the
[53:22] spirit you have to watch it here
[53:27] because
[53:28] God when he expresses his
[53:34] thought then it is
[53:39] written want you to notice that let me
[53:42] say that
[53:43] again when God expresses his
[53:49] thought
[53:51] then it is
[53:54] written
[53:56] but
[53:57] then he hides
[54:00] it behind his
[54:04] word it has to be in the
[54:08] word because God is the
[54:13] word and he's in the
[54:16] word but as long as you see it
[54:20] written and you don't take this and eat
[54:24] it you'll always see it written in the
[54:28] Bible but it has to be
[54:32] written some place
[54:35] else to be made
[54:44] manifest to bring the original
[54:48] seed to his
[54:52] restoration
[54:54] Redemption you cannot have Redemption
[54:56] without
[54:58] restoration they go
[55:01] together redeem is to send
[55:04] back and to
[55:07] restore to place it in its original
[55:13] position that's why God said
[55:16] Adam Where Art
[55:19] Thou he knew where Adam was but Adam had
[55:23] left his position
[55:26] and as long as you are not in
[55:29] position he will say Jacob Jacob where
[55:34] thou Tony Tony where thou William
[55:39] Williams where thou but when you find
[55:42] your
[55:43] position he ain't looking no
[55:46] more he's
[55:49] there he's there
[55:54] are this is hard for the people to
[55:58] understand for the letter
[56:01] kills read the Bible all you
[56:04] want read these books all you
[56:07] want brother it'll kill
[56:12] you I want to say that
[56:15] again you read this it'll kill you but
[56:20] you got to die before you can
[56:23] live yes sir it'll kill you you do
[56:28] something wrong you're doing something
[56:31] wrong and this letter will kill
[56:34] you and some of you come to
[56:38] church you give your heart to the
[56:41] lord it's everything's
[56:43] okay but you begin to hear the
[56:46] word begins to kill you before you know
[56:50] it you don't want to come to church
[56:52] anymore why because the
[56:56] kill body doesn't stop right there it
[56:59] says that the
[57:01] spirit gives you life and if you want
[57:05] life to be in the Kingdom you let that
[57:08] letter kill
[57:12] you cuz you got to read the
[57:16] letter everybody has to read this
[57:19] letter this was a letter sent from
[57:23] God and it'll
[57:29] kill so many Desires in brother
[57:33] pis till the letter
[57:37] kill and the Bible says when when the
[57:41] worshiper is once
[57:45] cleansed he has no more
[57:49] desire of sin why because the spirit
[57:55] gives life not it's his
[57:59] spirit I know that he has changed my
[58:01] heart and my
[58:04] spirit it's my Same
[58:07] Spirit it hasn't changed in a
[58:10] sense but in another sense my spirit has
[58:15] been
[58:17] transferred has been
[58:19] changed it has been shown
[58:22] something it has
[58:25] nature the nature of the
[58:28] world
[58:31] nature of the holy spirit in my life
[58:35] that's what changes and the spirit makes
[58:39] you
[58:41] free that's
[58:43] Spirit not just because you you you you
[58:46] spoke in
[58:47] tongues and that's all right if you
[58:49] speak in
[58:49] tongues not because you
[58:52] prophesied not because you preached not
[58:55] because you're a good
[58:56] J no but until this letter
[59:02] kills the sacrifice must be
[59:06] killed we must die but we shouldn't stay
[59:11] dead that's why a lot of people read the
[59:15] message and they're dead they never get
[59:18] the
[59:19] life but when we are buried with
[59:23] him so
[59:27] resurrect we must come up we must
[59:32] resurrect with him for he is our savior
[59:36] he is our lord of every
[59:39] tongue of every nation of every
[59:48] language all
[59:50] right
[59:53] amen s
[1:00:07] in the ministry of
[1:00:09] death written and engraved on
[1:00:14] Stones was
[1:00:17] glorious so that the children of
[1:00:20] Israel could not look steadily at the
[1:00:23] face of Moses
[1:00:27] because of the glory of his
[1:00:31] countenance which Glory was passing
[1:00:35] away you think that Ministry was
[1:00:39] glorious watch this
[1:00:42] one how will the ministry of the
[1:00:46] spirit not be more
[1:00:50] glorious how many can see a glorious
[1:00:53] Ministry
[1:00:57] amen now remember Moses veiled
[1:01:02] his and and uh the things of
[1:01:05] God are still
[1:01:07] veiled maybe not out
[1:01:10] here let me tell you
[1:01:13] something even
[1:01:15] though the Revelation has been
[1:01:19] given there Still Remains a
[1:01:23] supernatural thing
[1:01:30] there there's a little Supernatural
[1:01:32] right
[1:01:34] there we we we preach
[1:01:37] here fine we got to preach here we also
[1:01:42] got to preach
[1:01:43] here but there's a supernatural thing
[1:01:46] here amen it's called Supernatural
[1:01:53] gospel
[1:01:55] let me quote to you what brother Brenham
[1:01:59] said he said witches and
[1:02:02] warlocks again
[1:02:07] brasas no more about the
[1:02:13] supernatural than most
[1:02:23] preachers
[1:02:29] they know more about
[1:02:32] it the supernatural
[1:02:44] frightens hear me ex
[1:02:48] me this
[1:02:51] ministry more glorious glor amen than
[1:02:55] that of
[1:02:56] Moses that's what the B that's what Paul
[1:02:58] wrote
[1:03:00] here how will the ministry of the spirit
[1:03:03] not be more
[1:03:10] glorious for in the ministry of
[1:03:13] condemnation had
[1:03:18] Glory the ministry of righteousness
[1:03:21] exceeds M more much more in glory much
[1:03:28] for even what was made
[1:03:32] glorious had no glory in this
[1:03:36] respect because of the glory that
[1:03:44] excels
[1:03:46] amen now watch
[1:03:48] this when the son of man
[1:03:51] came and I understand the son of man is
[1:03:53] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:57] amen he
[1:03:58] came how many believe he came I believe
[1:04:02] he came he planted the Original
[1:04:07] Seed and he was going to use the
[1:04:11] voice because brother Bram says I am the
[1:04:15] voice of God to
[1:04:18] you but then we read it's the voice of
[1:04:22] many
[1:04:23] Waters
[1:04:26] and we heard brother
[1:04:27] Fabio bring to us the
[1:04:30] message whener came he was not by
[1:04:36] himself but the servants were with
[1:04:40] him let me let me tell you
[1:04:44] something when
[1:04:46] Elijah was commanded to go to the
[1:04:49] Widow's
[1:04:52] home the Bible
[1:04:54] says that God had already commanded the
[1:05:00] Widow had G his Commandments to the
[1:05:05] Widow but the Widow didn't know nothing
[1:05:07] about it
[1:05:09] yet we don't know that God had given the
[1:05:13] Commandments when God said let there be
[1:05:17] light the light has to
[1:05:20] come it might not come right
[1:05:23] away has to come because God gave the
[1:05:27] Commandment the woman God said there's a
[1:05:32] widow that shall sustain the
[1:05:36] like the Widow didn't know nothing
[1:05:38] about but when the prophet Drew
[1:05:41] near there was something about the
[1:05:44] prophet that got the attention of the
[1:05:49] Widow poor man I'll give him a drink of
[1:05:53] water
[1:05:55] but how selfish was that
[1:06:00] man how
[1:06:05] selfish that
[1:06:07] woman had enough
[1:06:10] food for one
[1:06:15] meal and for her
[1:06:18] son and then they were going to
[1:06:22] die right
[1:06:26] sometimes our wallets have
[1:06:33] money and we're asked for a little bit
[1:06:35] of money to help the
[1:06:40] kingdom said I ain't going to give no
[1:06:44] money that's right but if you were like
[1:06:48] the Widow that Elijah came
[1:06:51] to she would give him
[1:06:55] I want you to notice what these men said
[1:06:59] to
[1:07:02] her make me some
[1:07:08] bread make I mean the man was looking
[1:07:12] out for
[1:07:17] hisas but what was he really looking for
[1:07:22] that what what made the woman recognize
[1:07:26] that that man was God's
[1:07:32] anointed what made you recognize who
[1:07:35] your pastor
[1:07:37] is who made you recognize that brother
[1:07:40] Bram was the
[1:07:43] prophet I gave them the
[1:07:47] Revelation oh no you might have Spen to
[1:07:51] him but the revelation
[1:07:54] has to be commanded by God and that
[1:07:57] woman will receive that and when she
[1:08:01] receives them it's not a chffa
[1:08:04] revelation that's the problem today
[1:08:07] second hand
[1:08:09] Revelation amen but this woman when she
[1:08:13] got that this was the word of
[1:08:17] Elijah he says you bake me that
[1:08:22] cake and I I'll guarantee
[1:08:26] you that as long as there is famine in
[1:08:29] the
[1:08:32] land you will always have that Cru of
[1:08:36] oil you'll always have that meal
[1:08:43] offering I'm G say that
[1:08:46] again as long as long as you do as long
[1:08:50] as you give me
[1:08:52] first is that the way it works with
[1:08:56] you me first and then
[1:08:59] them no no no it's God first then your
[1:09:04] family you don't put your family over
[1:09:08] God God first God says give
[1:09:12] me God says give me a woman she has been
[1:09:19] commanded she didn't know it but in her
[1:09:22] heart a seed had been
[1:09:26] planted who put it there the almighty
[1:09:30] God Elijah I have
[1:09:34] commanded a widow woman to sustain thee
[1:09:39] no that she was
[1:09:41] widow she had not divorced her
[1:09:44] husband brother Bram says that her
[1:09:47] husband was waiting for her in
[1:09:52] glory
[1:09:58] where are those
[1:10:04] Ravens that will keep the voice of
[1:10:07] Elijah
[1:10:14] alive well I know what he'll do with
[1:10:16] that
[1:10:17] money you buy him a new
[1:10:20] car it's funny that you can drive a new
[1:10:22] car but the pastor can I drive a new
[1:10:31] car let me tell you a little
