[59:49] mince words neither does it means
[59:51] exactly what it says
[59:57] unless a corn of wheat fall to the
[59:59] ground and die
[1:00:06] it'll bring forth much
[1:00:08] so we're grateful to the lord
[1:00:26] day that we get closer to being able to
[1:00:29] see her one day
[1:00:33] we're grateful to god for what he's
[1:00:35] given us
[1:00:36] i'm going to ask you to stand really
[1:00:38] quickly now
[1:00:41] and in the book of isaiah in the libra
[1:00:43] de isaiah the 48th chapter in the 22nd
[1:00:47] verse
[1:00:49] and i want to thank our pastor for the
[1:00:51] opportunity for the confidence
[1:01:05] there is no peace saith
[1:01:08] the lord
[1:01:09] unto the wicked
[1:01:13] lord jesus we come before you
[1:01:17] and ask you father that you'll give us
[1:01:19] our daily portion
[1:01:21] when it is all over
[1:01:24] we'll be sure to give you all the honor
[1:01:26] and all the glory
[1:01:27] [Music]
[1:01:29] for you alone deserve it
[1:01:31] we are grateful to you
[1:01:34] thankful to you
[1:02:17] you know the bible talks to us and it
[1:02:18] says
[1:02:21] casting all your care upon him for he
[1:02:23] careth for you
[1:02:30] as we were in the in the funeral of
[1:02:32] brother larry khan
[1:02:36] khan the next day uh a brother jimmy
[1:02:39] garcia from from san diego
[1:02:42] garcia de san diego made these these
[1:02:45] declarations
[1:03:25] and i want to tell you this morning that
[1:03:26] you are precious in the eyes of god
[1:03:41] as you see in the scripture
[1:03:45] there is no peace no i pass
[1:03:48] saith the lord and to the wicked
[1:03:52] and we are not here to declare who is
[1:03:55] wicked and who is not
[1:03:59] but what we want to do is to is to maybe
[1:04:02] challenge your faith just a little bit
[1:04:06] i want to entitle my our message this
[1:04:09] morning
[1:04:22] a life worth giving birth to ona
[1:04:31] in our
[1:04:33] our
[1:04:34] speaking this morning
[1:04:38] i want to for you to take at the very
[1:04:40] initial word time the the word anxiety
[1:04:44] and worry
[1:04:49] we're not going to cabbage down on it
[1:04:52] we're going to tell you just what it is
[1:04:56] anxiety does not empty tomorrow of its
[1:04:59] sorrows
[1:05:04] but only empties today of its
[1:05:13] [Music]
[1:05:19] quit worrying then because it is simple
[1:05:27] sinful and produces fear
[1:05:35] worry is a disease that causes other
[1:05:38] ills
[1:05:42] it borrows trouble that cannot be paid
[1:05:45] back
[1:06:16] about all of this
[1:06:20] can you imagine every day wondering what
[1:06:23] is going to happen tomorrow
[1:06:29] there was a story of a man that said
[1:06:34] and he put his name and you can put your
[1:06:35] name there
[1:06:39] thomas was tired of worrying
[1:06:43] so he hired a man for a thousand dollars
[1:06:47] a week so that this man could worry for
[1:06:49] him
[1:06:54] he said well how are you going to pay
[1:06:57] him
[1:07:13] mental and physical suicide
[1:07:16] is mentally physical
[1:07:19] worry is a grave digger that has no
[1:07:21] sympathy
[1:07:25] it is a needless and wasted time and
[1:07:28] effort
[1:07:31] [Music]
[1:07:33] that should be spent on worthwhile
[1:07:35] things
[1:07:39] it produces guilty
[1:07:52] because eventually then you start
[1:07:54] feeling guilty
[1:07:58] and then you have regrets
[1:08:01] of things that maybe you should have
[1:08:03] done
[1:08:05] that is called worry and anxiety
[1:08:51] like an orphan without a heavenly father
[1:08:56] the sparrows were having a conversation
[1:08:59] one day
[1:09:02] and they would say look at the humans
[1:09:04] that they're going and they're anxious
[1:09:06] and they're worrying
[1:09:11] and spinning as they go
[1:09:15] and one sparrow says
[1:09:18] maybe they
[1:09:47] yellow i wonder if god will save me
[1:09:51] he already did
[1:09:53] i wonder if he will heal me
[1:09:56] he already did yeah
[1:09:58] it's a crime against god
[1:10:40] but many people do not want to go
[1:10:42] through the problem
[1:10:45] i want you to notice it is a valley of
[1:10:48] the shadow of death
[1:10:51] even though i walk through it
[1:10:55] camping there no mr
[1:11:24] it's cruel for you to to think every day
[1:11:29] if i could only
[1:11:31] if i could only live yesterday again
[1:11:36] if i could only live back by tomorrow so
[1:11:51] don't worry about tomorrow
[1:12:07] is amnesia
[1:12:10] because we don't remember where we came
[1:12:12] from
[1:12:15] when we don't remember where we came
[1:12:17] from
[1:12:18] we don't know where we're going
[1:12:48] i was
[1:13:02] then this would not happen
[1:13:04] i can tell you why
[1:13:06] the reason that things happen
[1:13:09] it is the love of god
[1:13:12] it is the peace of god that passes all
[1:13:14] understand
[1:13:46] when then should we go home
[1:13:52] is when
[1:13:53] you got to remember the story of uh
[1:13:57] of the prodigal son yesterday
[1:14:12] how many know that the lord jesus is
[1:14:14] rich in everything
[1:14:17] and he
[1:14:19] he wanted his blessing everything right
[1:14:22] now
[1:14:24] if god was to give you all the blessings
[1:14:26] that are yours right now you couldn't
[1:14:28] contain them
[1:14:32] but we all want them right now
[1:14:36] we want to feel rich right now
[1:14:39] we want to feel important
[1:14:54] i think that sometimes we forget that
[1:14:58] and the cause is that maybe we we want
[1:15:01] to live really really what we should be
[1:15:05] in this world
[1:15:36] and as
[1:15:50] this world is
[1:16:00] a man he
[1:16:02] he he comes to the understanding
[1:16:07] what is then the most perfect thing and
[1:16:10] the most understanding thing and what
[1:16:12] what what what is that that draws you
[1:16:14] what what what is what is your priority
[1:16:17] in life
[1:16:32] when i see you i see god
[1:16:38] i see god
[1:16:40] when i see you i see life
[1:16:44] when i see you
[1:16:46] i said
[1:16:55] [Applause]
[1:16:59] amen
[1:17:03] backsliding is a form of insanity
[1:17:12] it is insane to walk away from the lord
[1:17:15] and all his blessings
[1:17:20] that's why i love we love my uncle
[1:17:22] abraham so much
[1:17:25] the only way you take me out of cedar
[1:17:26] hills
[1:17:27] foreign
[1:18:37] we might have and i do we
[1:19:02] waited for him at home
[1:19:19] and he got all the blessings
[1:19:37] the bible says that he went and acted
[1:19:39] like he was homeless
[1:19:44] and spent things like he didn't have
[1:19:45] that and that was going to be done
[1:19:47] tomorrow
[1:20:01] he's in a pig's pen
[1:20:30] when the bible says
[1:20:32] that he came to himself
[1:20:36] in other words he's right here
[1:20:39] the promise is right there
[1:20:42] he's eating with the pigs right here
[1:21:13] my father's house
[1:21:17] they have plenty to eat
[1:21:19] what should i live in is
[1:21:40] my father's
[1:22:19] when a believer is out of fellowship
[1:22:21] with the lord
[1:22:36] how do you get when you don't come to
[1:22:37] church for a little while
[1:22:41] the song says raise your hand
[1:22:45] and you try with all your heart
[1:22:49] but when there's a person that really
[1:22:51] loves the lord
[1:22:53] you don't have to say raise your hand
[1:23:00] you can put your hands in your pockets
[1:23:05] what does that show
[1:23:07] you're homeless
[1:23:11] but when you're in the house of the lord
[1:23:16] come on now
[1:23:17] man and you hear it
[1:23:33] and absolutely private
[1:23:39] you know why
[1:23:41] they returned home when he returned home
[1:23:46] he said i'll go to my father not saying
[1:23:48] father i've sinned.
[1:23:52] against thee and against heaven
[1:23:55] i'm no more than i i can't be called
[1:23:57] your your son
[1:24:00] make me one of your
[1:24:56] i gotta tell you
[1:25:07] [Applause]
[1:25:09] hallelujah
[1:25:14] [Music]
[1:25:23] we
[1:25:24] look
[1:25:26] to the scripture
[1:25:31] a man named
[1:25:33] elijah
[1:25:35] elias
[1:25:37] according to scripture brother david
[1:25:53] yes jesus christ the son of god
[1:25:56] see jesus
[1:25:58] he ascended upon him
[1:26:01] but the bible says he died
[1:26:06] he died to take away our sins
[1:26:09] so according to scripture
[1:26:14] enoch enoch and elijah elias were the
[1:26:17] only ones that did not see death
[1:26:26] [Laughter]
[1:27:02] it
[1:27:07] why is that so important to us
[1:27:13] because jesus said
[1:27:15] jesus he that believeth in me created me
[1:27:18] shall never die
[1:27:21] [Applause]
[1:27:26] you you can come home now
[1:27:29] if you believe you can come home now
[1:27:32] that believeth in me shall never die
[1:27:36] [Applause]
[1:27:38] how is it that we never die
[1:27:41] because we believed a message from a man
[1:27:43] that never died
[1:28:10] amen
[1:28:12] but when he comes to the understanding
[1:28:17] of the word of god
[1:28:20] that death to a believer
[1:28:24] is then just a vehicle
[1:28:36] i will be alive more than at that time
[1:28:40] any other
[1:28:53] oh we took care of him
[1:29:02] the bible tells us
[1:29:05] then we come to the
[1:29:07] knowledge of the truth
[1:29:28] here's the prodigal son he comes to
[1:29:30] himself
[1:29:32] but he rehearses
[1:29:35] what he has got inside of him
[1:29:38] the father has different plans for him
[1:29:43] but he already knew who to go to but
[1:29:46] but our words
[1:29:49] produce producing the
[1:30:03] tomorrow
[1:30:07] well i already knew it was going to be
[1:30:09] half cloudy yes
[1:30:11] so heart part cloudy part
[1:30:14] you won't even say part partly sunny no
[1:30:17] positive
[1:30:20] well i always knew that the cup was
[1:30:22] olives you almost drink all of it it's
[1:30:24] half empty yes
[1:30:28] it's not half full nostalgia
[1:30:32] [Music]
[1:30:37] well you just don't know my sorrows
[1:30:41] tomorrow manana they're going to be
[1:30:44] worse let's not feel tomorrow you're
[1:30:46] going to be worse eman you know
[1:30:48] you know tomorrow i'm going to be sicker
[1:30:50] than today
[1:30:52] and you're going to be sick today
[1:30:54] oh i never had a boyfriend
[1:30:58] i'm never going to have when the girl
[1:30:59] says you're
[1:31:14] but when you come to yourself
[1:31:18] i'm going to say it again when you come
[1:31:20] home
[1:31:22] to where the blessings are at
[1:31:24] today is partly sunny
[1:31:41] he already knows my tomorrow
[1:31:56] he saw his
[1:32:07] and you will never ever get anything
[1:32:09] from god until you get in
[1:33:33] he said if you see me when i go away
[1:33:40] if you see me
[1:33:42] without knowing no death
[1:33:47] so powerful was that spirit of elijah
[1:33:51] was the spirit of elias that he was
[1:33:53] going to use it five times
[1:33:55] out of sinkhole you said how come what
[1:33:58] he says he said john the baptist came in
[1:34:01] the spirit and power of
[1:34:21] [Music]
[1:34:43] jesus christ
[1:35:12] then you can have anything
[1:35:15] because i want a double portion of your
[1:35:17] spirit
[1:35:20] the bible says
[1:35:22] when he sees him
[1:35:25] the man told elijah falls
[1:35:30] and elisha eliseo had already had a life
[1:35:36] but this was a life now worth giving
[1:35:38] birth
[1:35:55] and how does he know that that spirit is
[1:35:57] with him
[1:36:00] he goes to a river called death
[1:36:04] and he takes the mantle of elijah
[1:36:08] and he cries out
[1:36:11] where is the god of elijah
[1:36:15] the river jordan
[1:36:18] which is a separation
[1:36:22] called death
[1:37:04] this was not the first time that the
[1:37:06] water divided hither and feathers
[1:37:11] because it didn't happen in the time of
[1:37:13] moses
[1:37:15] but this was another pair of gentlemen
[1:37:32] place
[1:37:38] to or towards that place
[1:37:45] okay
[1:37:49] okay so so he he divides the water
[1:37:53] he divides the water over here
[1:37:56] and over there
[1:37:58] right
[1:37:59] okay okay
[1:38:17] [Music]
[1:39:08] but it's got to bring birth to something
[1:39:51] the converter
[1:40:19] a million germs went out uh
[1:40:23] a million eggs went out
[1:40:26] of saline him in that purpose
[1:40:29] divided the hitler
[1:40:32] from the cedar
[1:40:34] and said
[1:40:47] he will accept the message and what's
[1:40:50] the parameters of the man that never die
[1:40:54] [Music]
[1:40:55] [Applause]
[1:41:02] here is the hither
[1:41:07] yaki
[1:41:13] okay okay thank you
[1:41:15] here is the hither
