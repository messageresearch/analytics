TRANSCRIPT
========================================
shalom my precious brother our beloved founder of shida his church of the cross i took this opportunity to appreciate you and let you know how much we do value you just because of what you felt for africa it has been out of the vision of brother branham that equipped you to have a feeling for africa i would really want to say that there was no way out that i would ever know you and you would ever know me if our prophet never had a feeling for africa and i also know that it was not our prophet willing to be coming to africa but the lord jesus himself wanted to come to africa i have read his quote where many times brother branham wanted to come to east africa even to uganda but the religious order of his day and the law of his day would not permit him to come [Music] and yet the spirit was willing in this regard every every man would get to have a feeling that there were souls that were entangled in the land of africa that would one day need to hear the omega voice of our lord jesus this would make evil men and willing men risk their lives to travel to the jungles of africa i am particularly giving my voice to you because of how much we have been touched by the love of your sons and associates ministers that they have always struggled with brother caleb and brother tommy jr i have always tried so much to think of them how they would risk their lives [Music] to travel and come to uganda and most of all dare their lives to reach this part of our country that has been named [Music] a place of rebellion in history many people have been murdered maine different kind of atrocities until our land which is actually land is in the world map as an area that has been constantly in war and the people their own good look so fierce and hard to stay with and indeed even from within uganda many missionaries have always been stopped from reaching our locality but this did not make any sense no matter how perhaps they may have also been told the area is hard it didn't make any sense to your two sons brother caleb and tommy and the team that travel with them leave or die they had to reach even in dark they had to travel they wouldn't know where they were going but they were determined i truly see the spirit of caleb in caleb that great army in the days of joshua that little spirit that sparked and quieted all the negative testimonies that were rising against the promise truly brother caleb while i talked to dad i don't leave you in this regard i truly know that like we have always said this time ground you didn't just come because there is a feeling for africa but you came because god had already appointed you for this time brother thomas junior our dad i want to say this i don't know how long you're going to spend yet living with us but even if you go be assured that we love you we cherish you we feel like i told brother caleb i would be very glad to shake her hand with such a man of this kind i believe brother tommy brother caleb is a reflection of your own ministry the nature of the balance that they have always had men who don't draw walls around them they are not always for the doctrines that they uphold they don't help you because you are right with their own doctrine they want to build the unity in the face that we have regardless of factions and kinds of pool here and there i believe that was what our lord jesus christ was when he came in the land of israel it was not to pull punches with samaritans and the jews he was to unite them though he failed according to the prophecy they desired no unity at all but his attitude was to to make them be united same thing when brother branham came he would not have disregards to lose and the denominations he would always peruse through their ranks and would appear believe point people to christ and he made the statement that that was his very purpose was to make men have good standing and relationship with christ i'm sure everyone who is built in the like faith would think so i witnessed this in the ministry of brother toby and brother caleb something that keeps me warm keeps me always looking unto the end of god's program i failed to give my appreciation to you before you leave us any day that you will leave us my words will remain as an appreciation from our jolly land in which suda hills church of the cross have invested a lot of funds in different times in circumstances that they have never even thought they would be involved in they came in with the purpose of doing the translation but they have ended up doing quite more than those and they do willingly they have become part of us particularly me as brother barcelo pio i have become the very family of brother caleb and brother tommy in many ways they have done so when the crisis came the pandemic came in they had to send in a lot of help to help here and there surely like i told brother caleb this happened at the time when god had already given a way out and the way out here is you came in not that you really have a lot of fans you came in i told brother caleb because there was a crisis ahead of time and it would be very difficult you know our poor status we are poor material yes but god has given us the spiritual wealth and as long as we are in the body we do have a feeling when we are hungry when we are thirsty when we are naked when we are afflicted by diseases we still have the feeling that touch our physical bodies and someone would stand in to help us and clothe us and help us here and there would it be possible especially at this time that the world is shut things are not moving would it be possible for us to survive quite well though we don't have all that we want to have but they have done what is recommendable that a child god can do to a fellow brother and sister i want to say as i conclude your vision for africa a continent that was described by those who try to understand about it as a dark continent that continent according to them is that they didn't know much about it until explorers came and when they knew they found their people there and the people have black colors but they have the very soul the spirit and the blood that brother ram said we can transfuse our own blood and we still look alike many tried to put them to look like animals but brother branham refused it oh this is the place your heart has always been and finally your son had to come to accomplish with great love happiness joy and real re-yearning to see you i now send my voice to you and i say actually greets you we cherish every effort that you have always put through your sons and the members in your congregation to our land may you live long may you see the glory of the lord and to my brother caleb just been a great opportunity to meet you that i can have the potential talk to your dad may you be well may the hands of the lord never depart from you may he enlighten your heart may deal with you more than he has ever dealt with you god bless you all this is brother basil of pio from gulu northern uganda amen you
