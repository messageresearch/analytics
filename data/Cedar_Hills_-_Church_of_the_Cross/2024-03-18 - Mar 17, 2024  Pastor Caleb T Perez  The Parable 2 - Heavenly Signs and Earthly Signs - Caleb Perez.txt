TRANSCRIPT
========================================
let us go on to Perfection I like Paul saying those things Paul never was a person that like to stay too long in one place he liked to move on deeper one time in the scripture he said I forgetting those things which are in the past I press towards the mark of the High Calling see he keeps pressing on now we first we want to find out could we be perfect and we found found out in the scriptures this morning Matthew 5:28 that Jesus said that we had to be just as perfect as God was or we wouldn't go in now here's what we find out then over reading F scripture with scripture that Jesus by one sacrifice perfected forever his church ye we are then per perfect through Christ and we are free from judgment through Christ we shall never die through Christ we have lost death and found life through Christ not through any church not through any denomination not through any fantastic not through speaking with tongues not through shouting not through shaking not through dancing in the spirit but by Grace now you got to see where the picture is Paul is trying here to separ separate law From Grace we've got two pictures one the carnal one the spiritual this letter is to the Hebrews and all the Hebrews is trying to show the pattern of the Old Testament typ in the new now this Leon is absolutely not any interpretation at all it's just the Greek word for what the English says and it said now we don't want listen here see not laying uh down foundations of reformation from Works causing death now if you get that in your mind that he's speaking here that forms of reformation causes death Paul said leaving the principles go to Perfection not laying again the foundation of of repentance from dead works and of Faith towards God doctrines of baptism laying on of hands resurrection of the Dead Eternal judgment Reformation forms causing death was the right words that's actually why Paul wrote see what he's trying to do now you can be all worked up in Emotion by speaking in tongu shouting jerking shaking running up down the a nothing against that but but you can make yourself believe that you're saved when you're not your life will prove what you are Jesus said it will by their fruits you shall know them your life will prove whether you're saved or not if you never open your mouth Paul said let's go on to Perfection now we're talking about perfected and if we'll run this down you'll find out the perfected is the elected that's how it is with Christ when a man's born to the spirit of God not because he shouted spoken under some emotion but in his heart love come in and taking the place of the world I tell you he loves him he walks by him every day amen you don't have to tell him it's wrong to do this or that or the other he knows it's wrong and he walks he's an AR and beginning at the sixth chapter we got this in our lesson this morning therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to Perfection I like Paul saying those things Paul never was a person that like to stay too long in one place he liked to move on deeper one time in the scripture he said uh forgetting those things which are in the past hey

I I'll be leaving after service and I'll be gone for for through the end of the week if you have any need or anything arises please don't hesitate to call the ministry that is here amen we want to get into the word now and um wow this this may be one of the most important messages that I have ever preached I wish I wish that everybody was here but wherever you're at God bless you may you receive also this is the parable number two and uh it is with the subtitle Heavenly signs and Earthly signs and if you don't have to leave if you don't have to go out please don't don't disrupt uh today if you if you can you hold on a little bit longer you have to go to the restroom just hold hold on or I mean if it's an emergency go ahead but but uh TR not to let it be a you know disturbance going in and out amen so let's get right into the word read all the the the visitors that are here God bless you may God be with you may you find and what you are lacking what you need this morning why don't you smile at your neighbors and say it's good to see you neighbor now if there's something that you that you hear that you're maybe don't understand just put it to the side don't throw away the whole pie just just throw away the seed right and uh and so let's get into this now is everyone ready some of you some of you are ready some of you are like I'll make sure everybody's ready this morning let me see let me see your hands if you're ready all right I don't want brother Caleb to be ministering this morning we want the Lord to speak to us amen so let's get into the word now we're going to start a little slow and and and and then you'll see at the end it's all going to come together I promise you this Matthew the 13th chapter and the 10th verse Matthew 13: 10 and 11 one more time this may be one of the most important messages I have ever preached to you and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in Parables and he said unto them because it is given unto you we got to take that to yourself amen everybody put your name because it is given unto Caleb to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given may God add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated Parables Paras what a word Parables can you repeat after me Parables Parables is an Earthly story with a Heavenly meaning now we we we went over this last time and we want to go over it again one more time a parable is an Earthly story with a Heavenly meaning a parable let me see your is uh also it means to place one thing side by side for the purpose of comparing it this has to equal this if if I bring this and I put this side by side it doesn't make sense right there's nothing that's similar about it even though in type they can say oh this is the water and this is water but but as as a whole it doesn't it doesn't jive right but when you bring these two together you find it that it's not just similar it's it's the same and that's what we're after this morning I don't I don't believe that we want to be just a a a Christian but when Christ is set side by side with us is the same life in us that is in Christ if not then we're just a church goer right the Life of Christ has got to be inside of you or else it's just religion that we have received it means to compare one thing with another the likeness the similitude now listen closely as I as I tell you other things that a parable is a parable displays a pre-ordained Harmony between spiritual things and material things now that's a parable it's very hard to get the spiritual and the natural to be in harmony with each other right in other words it's impossible really to have that Harmony unless the spiritual has come down to join with the natural then comes the harmony with the natural and the spiritual parables are predictive and prophetic and the bottom line Parables can def be defined as this a beautiful image from a beautiful mind I'm going to say it one more time a parable is a beautiful image from A Beautiful Mind in other words from the back part of God's mind he was release something that only those that were spiritual enough could catch a church member can't catch this this is important listen closely a church member cannot catch these things natural person can catch these things it takes a prophetic group spiritual group that is in har harmony with the spiritual realm these things if not we're going to be the same as everyone else waiting for a Rapture that never gets here are you with me Romans 1:20 have your Bibles ready because we're going to read some few scriptures for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen let me ask you a question and you see invisible things yes or yes see or see or no or no or no or no how many of you can see invisible things by faith we say right it's not a trick question I'm just reading the Bible here for the invisible things him from the creation of the world are clearly seen they cannot be clearly seen until there's an image that catches it in other words creation produces the image that catch the invisible and display it in the natural realm there's no other way to understand that being understood by the things that are made in other words the invisible can only be seen by the things that were made if we see a tree there has to be a spiritual tree that that it's showing you see a tree then you go see the tree of life okay there's a tree of life somewhere there's a tree though that never dies somewhere but then it's shown in a natural or a physical tree they are understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead let me say Let Let Me read that again so his eternal power and godhead are invisible until something that is made can now reflect what that is are you are you are you understanding this so then so that they are without an excuse well I didn't know well look around we don't have an excuse no more because all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church now something visible that is showing what was invisible the godhead was invisible his eternal power was invisible until a people came on the scene that he could put that power in godhead in and therefore the people have no excuse you have no excuse anymore that Jesus Christ is not alive there's no excuse no more maybe years and years and centuries ago but now more than ever before it is on display the harmony between the spiritual and the natural are you with me just setting a foundation I speak to ministers pastors people everywhere and and everyone seems it seems like everyone is telling me the same thing now maybe you can you can associate yourself with this there seems to be such a heaviness in in the in the world world today more than there's ever been such a heaviness that everyone I talk to man I'm I'm just so tired all the time am I talking to anyone here I there there's such a heavy it's like a heavy Cloud over world making the people Slumber and sleep all of a sudden you just doze off I was talking to somebody the other day sitting there and I was I just and for a moment I fell asleep that's not very nice huh I saw that yes you did I went to sleep on you that's I don't do that on purpose and I didn't I don't do that all the time okay I'm getting old but what's going on is is this heaviness is for one purpose to D our senses is that right come on now when you become become you get into that slumbering and sleepiness your senses are dulled you're not aware of what's going on you're not aware of the spiritual much less what's going on or what should be going on in the natural I hear people saying I just don't seem to hear from God no more I talking to anybody here come on now I just don't hear I used to hear him and I just don't seem to hear him anymore I just don't feel like myself anymore don't even feel like coming to church I don't feel like being around people am I talking to anyone That's what Satan wants crawl in a cave and don't be around nobody but I don't say that to throw at anyone I'm saying this because because I want your senses to be sharpened this morning recognize the enemy you got to recognize where that heaviness is coming from look the the higher up we go we say Lord I Want More Revelation do you really you're going to pay a price for more Revelation as you go up in your maturity you're going to fight greater Devils than you've ever known this is what's going on people say Pastor is there something wrong with me there's nothing wrong with you but you just better get ready to fight we're coming up into these into these Realms church and all hell is doing everything it can keep the thoughts of God from getting to you's going on the only ones that will catch the thoughts of God are those that were predestinated from before the foundation of the world look what this is the higher we go the question is are we prepared to handle doubt comes in and the doubt is maybe you're I don't know maybe you're not prepared for this can we ever be be prepared for that yeah in one sense yes but it's got to be him in us he has already overcome the Bible says in Ephesians 612 and 13 and just bear with me okay this is going somewhere for we wrestle wrestle we we've read this so many times but when it comes time to wrestle oh no all hell's against me I don't know what to do wrestle wrestling is a struggle for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places want to go to high places you're going to wrestle with spiritual wickedness in high places so take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day when's that evil day right now church tell your neighbor right now right now is that evil day and if you're going to stand in the evil day you got to put on the whole armor of God now Church Shake Yourself this morning you got to shake your family I'm GNA say it again Church you got to shake yourself this morning shake your family Shake everyone around you don't I mean you got to snap out of this slumbering and sleeping the spirit that's here there's wor work to still be done I don't want him to catch me sleeping night there was a cry the Bible says they all slumbered but when the Cry came for what was it it was the groom it was it was behold the bridegroom coming somebody was announcing that that's why God sent a prophet and if we don't hear the prophet then you don't hear the the the voice that will wake you from your slumbering and sleeping simple as that I don't need to hear that I don't need to hear the messages now you're going to one side or the other you got to The Voice already said behold the bridegroom comes go ye out to me all right every person here every person in the world has a story sit down with every each one of you and all of you can say this is my story I was born with these parents I was born in this town I was raised in this town I went to this school L and on and on we all have stories amen everybody's got a story but I'm here to tell you something not every story is a parable I'm going to say that again not every story is a parable nor is every part of your life a parable and let that one sit I'm and I and I and I gave you that for a moment so you can see it later on not every story is a parable because not every story has a Heavenly meaning all right we have a lot of Earthly stories that that guy I'm about to punch his lights out what is that that's just an Earthly story I made a mistake I did this and this and this Earthly story there's nothing Heavenly about that are you with me come on I want you to put yourself in this we all have a story but it's not all part of the parable Matthew 11:25 and at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes Jesus calls his father here Lord of Heaven and Earth he said I thank the old father Lord of Heaven and Earth ah here we are is Lord of the parable he's lord of the Heavenly meaning Earth which you need both to make a parable okay okay now watch now so you need the three parts you need the Lord you need the Heavenly part and the Earthly part and without the lordship it's just a story that's why brother Bram said says this you have made him your savior but is he your lord lord means total ownership I don't feel like doing that he's not total ownership that's why we do all the things we do want these things to hit home now Jesus is saying thou H has hid concealed it means to conceal or kept a secret you've kept this secret these things from the wise and The Prudent and has revealed them and the word reveal means to take the cover off taken the cover off you've revealed them unto babies now he didn't say babies here he said You' revealed them unto babes wait a minute I got to stop here because sometimes my mind just doesn't register things right if a baby is is an unskilled an an infant immature can't talk no teeth how are you going to reveal hidden things how are you going to reveal Parables how are you going to reveal Mysteries to a babe this doesn't make sense to me how I revealed them unto babes ah wow so now here's my first problem and I got a I got to work through this the baby cannot grasp these things once again he didn't say baby he said babes notice this now they are not just babes but these ones he's talking about are spoken word babes that which is born of the flesh is flesh Earthly story but that which is born of the spirit Spirit now we're talking about babes that are coming forth from the spoken word they are brother Bram calls them word children calls them bride children now we're going to get somewhere here is the secret that's been hid where's he hiding them in the word I'm going to say it again where is he hiding them the bright children how many know the secret you've been here a long time you got to know the secret already what's the secret that he's hid and where is he putting it okay this is in the message the spoken word is the Original Seed so what is it that's hid is the secret what is the secret brother Bram says here is the secret you ready how many ready for the secret are you still with me all right here's the secret the word is in the bride tell your neighbor here the word is in the bride oh wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute no that's a good secret but I want the secret to even be more personal the secret the word is in me now your neighbor neighbor the word is in neighbor the word is in me than me yeah all right you got the secret the words in me and everybody says I got the word hallelujah and that's all they that's all that's all they go they don't go any further wait wait wait he says the word is in the bride everyone says we have the word watch watch here as as it unfolds the word is in the bride and keep on reading somebody to tell me the word is in the bride the word is in me amen I got the word now praise God that's not the whole secret the other part of the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ oh now I've got the word and the mind of Christ you need those two things to understand the secret you need the word and the mind to understand the parable he says the word is in the bride now when I say when it says me up there that's me that's my notes they should have just gotten it from the but anyway that's me okay that's me that those are my notes everyone says we have the word fine but don't stop there and here's brother brandom again and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word it's like if I gave you a million dollars and I said okay here you go brother federo here's a million dollars and if I have in my mind what the million dollars is for but brother a million bucks I'm out of here and what's the first thing brother fedo is going to do shopping spree right man I got to buy a new car I need a I need a car I need some new clothes I need wait wait wait wait what good is it to have the word without the mind of Christ that will tell you what to do with it you got to have both okay are you with me this is the parable unfolding to know what he wants done with it so when he catches my thoughts is going to say what would you like me to do with this I'd like for you to go to to Uganda I want you to build a church I want you to help this brother and I want you to do this now he's getting the mind what to do with that it's no different in the spiritual watch and she does it in his name no one else can do it she does it in his name because she has thus sayith the Lord watch the process and then it is gered here we go with the babes now and then it is gerti so the Holy Spirit Waters it until it is grown and serves its purpose how many believe God sent a prophet in this why what was the purpose say God sent a prophet no no no he he he sent a prophet to share with us the thoughts of God God Reveals His secrets to his servants the prophets and he catches that from from God and he catches that message and when he does he puts it forth for a purpose thoughts that God had not from the beginning thoughts from before the beginning he had we heard it on Wednesday he has thoughts about us now listen closely now this predestinated bride is catching these thoughts people are coming to their spiritual senses that could actually be me come on now and saying here's this heaviness you're part of that body oh I think I am I used to believe I am I don't know anymore I said a few cuss words and I don't know where that came from I'm doing things but what's happening Shake Yourself he's getting you in this trance so that you cannot do the purpose for which you were sent to Earth this bride is catching these thoughts these Revelations that are needed for the parable to unfold that bride catches the mind of God because she knows what he wants done with it all right how many believe that the Book of Revelations is your book let me see your hands say it's a book in the Bible it's my book all our book how many really believe that the book of Revelations is is Caleb's book can you say that this morning the book book of Revelations is is that's right that's right got to be personal right my book okay how is it your book oh we got some people that said I'm there how many believe that the Book of Revelations is a story they're not trick questions how many believe that the Book of Revelations is a story whose story some of you are sure brother Braham says this The Book of Revelations is not the story of John's life nor is it the story of the life of Jesus of 2000 years ago the Book of Revelation is not his story when he was here on Earth it is the story of Christ in future ages amen oh this story is the parable this is where we're going this morning this this is the story of Christ in future AG but he's not in that body no more how can it be his story because now he is in another body now he is in his mystical body and the Book of Revelation is his story that he's living out through you and I but the Earthly has got to catch the spiritual or else you'll never see yourself there all right watch this now see it was a prophecy this is is is so tremendous to me because the Book of Revelations has more symbols than any other book the only other book that has those probably close to that is the Book of Ezekiel I would say it's nothing but a book of symbols and the symbol behind the symbol is is there's something that's that's hidden I can show you water behind this water or this water is signifying something else if in a vision I see a wa I see this bottle of water there got to be a a spiritual meaning to this what is that okay we're going to find all this out it's a it's it's full of symbols that need natural people in order to display spiritual truths believe in the Book of Revelations There Are Spiritual truths spiritual truth it is not a parable it's just spiritual truth but once again it needs a natural form or an image to take the spiritual truths and the only way to take them the angel tells John eat all the book don't just eat what you like in church I believe that but I don't like that the whole book because in the whole B book are all the symbols and when those symbols can put on Flesh and Blood got a parable going on now that's what we're after this morning acts 18 says shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you you'll be Witnesses let me read it again I'm going to do what brother Danny does let me read it again you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you then you part Parable right you're not part of the parable until after the Holy Ghost has come upon you because the parable is the natural Story the spirit spiritual meaning oh okay so then the natural is only a witness that the spiritual is here right I don't know if you got that I'm going to say it again the natural only shows that the spiritual oh I like this it brings you remember remember this only the bride of Christ is the real Parable all other lives are stories with no Eternal or Heavenly meaning can I ask you the question we've heard this many times what is the New Birth the revelation of Jesus Christ personal [Music] can you say that personal is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to Caleb why is he revealing himself to us bring us into the parable not hard right to bring us into his story story remember the Book of Revelations is the story of Christ in future ages the The Book of Revelations the story of Christ in future re future ages but it's not Future No More it was future back then when John wrote it it was future this is his story in the future future age but not no more we're at the end of the story already we're at the end of the dispensation come on Church we're at the end of the book it's not Future No More he is here he is present and he's the same in every detail this is why Satan fights us so much how many of you have the new birth how many of you want the new birth why does Satan fight you so much for the new birth fight all of us so much for the because he knows that in those babes are there going to be the secrets secret he's trying to he's trying to keep you from being a babe A Spoken Word babe that when it is revealed to you through you it is the greatest worship that God could ever receive it's when the natural receives the spiritual there Harmony together the greatest worship is not how much we jump in Shou in church even though we should do all those things greatest worship when his life com into the believer through you is able to live his life and produce his story now this is where we're at why is there so many few new births come on I'm gonna get to I want to get to the nitty-gritty of all this there's no reason why why day after day week after week year after year we don't get the new birth that is nonsense to me how many of you want the new birth why is it that there's so few remember there's three stages of Grace is that right that bring us to a new birth but I'll tell you why why there's so few new births because there's so much unconfessed sin why beat around the bush you want to repent then repent and clean out the closets completely C to the Lord C to the ones that you've sinned against have a real repentance we've said this many times to repent is not to say I'm sorry that's all we know how to say as humans I'm sorry for doing that I'm sorry for doing that against you I'm sorry brother says nothing but a bunch of dry-eyed confessions he said you want a real repentance me that if you're walking one way stop turn around start walking again the another way that's a real repentance until then you're just taking a break from things oh come on now are we part of the parable or not that's all we do is take breaks oh yeah we' like to hit up on that some little marijuana every now and then I okay Lord I'm going to get serious with you and then we oh man two weeks pass man we doing good on boom boom boom back to the same thing what happened you did not repent are you with me Church come on now you want me to keep going today you're going to have to pull it from me we do we always go back to these things because the nature in US is calling for that but until we're born again because we have repented properly God can do something with us that's the greatest hindrance to God unconfessed sin now you fill in your blanks there with in your life you think that you're in the stage in another stage I think I'm in another stage keep regressing why you never repent well I was birthed yeah there's a lot of births going on churches are full of church children oh come on now the churches are full this morning church children that are a million miles from the kingdom of God either we we either we get serious or we don't or we just play Church to church put on a nice suit looking nice nice dress smile to everybody be behind that smile is nothing but agony depression the dumps somebody's coming oh how are you what's going on Church children he's not looking for Church children's looking for those that he can empty himself into notice this now you may be birthed as a church babe but have you ever been born in Christ that's why there's so many people that's why there's so many people that are children of the church and not word children and Christ doesn't reveal his secrets to Children of the church they are not part of the parable oh we're going to get to something good I'm just barely this is this is just barely getting ready for you you see a babe not only is someone unskillful or immature come on where's the symbol now here we go a babe also is a new birth new life it's an there's an innocence to a baby oh now we're decoding the symbol this could mean one thing to him and it could mean something else to me if brother if if brother emelo worked at a recycling plant he would say drink the water so I can take take the bottle bottle is important to him if you're dying of thirst car about the bottle right it can mean different things to different people I I say that for a reason here in the in theage the Rapture I'm going to skip that real quick because I because I want to get to something here but watch this now John 312 and 13 listen closely when you have it you can say Amen how many are with me this is the most important message I've ever preached to you if I have told you Earthly things and ye believe believe not how shall ye believe if I tell you Heavenly we know Earthly things but how are you going to understand Heavenly things the parable hides the mystery and the Earthly or the natural is the Earth and vessel and that's where he keeps his secrets that's where he keeps his important papers in the old days that's the way they would do it where's the deed of your house was on a paper they would make earn vessels clay what and they would put the Deeds inside there that's where they were at somebody need the deed it's in this earth in all right all right Jeremiah 32 says this thus sayith the Lord of hosts the god of Israel take these evidences take these evidences this evidence of the per purchase both which is sealed and this evidence which is open and put them in an earn vessel that they may continue many days if I had time I would go into the seals right now right is that right that's what the seals did that's what it brought back to us it was the title de book of redemption and it was to be deposited in the parable who is it going to be deposited in all right here we go Earthly story your Earthly story I'm a vessel something's been deposited watch this now 2 Corinthians 4:7 but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels amen treasure x marks the spot right going with a treasure map all right we're trying to find where the x is at okay okay here's here it is on the map we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us why it's the story of Christ and we are part of Christ that's why the Kingdom of Heaven is liken unto it's compared to your story is an Earthly story but with the significance of a of the Heavenly and because you're in the Kingdom you're a citizen of the kingdom and therefore Heaven and Earth have United okay come on church we get so caught up with the Earthly story we forget the part of the parable I don't have no money for my rent I have no money for this we get so caught up Sparrow does he work about where he's going to get his food worry about where he's going to live yet we do we're outside of the parable because in the parable all things are possible in the parable ask whatever you want and it'll be given to you in the parable forgiveness in the parable is joy caling down in the dumps get into the parable in the parable is longsuffering gentleness goodness let's get into the parable Church we're living in the natural and there is no spiritual meaning to that this is what the Holy Ghost is shaking us this morning notice this now I'll tell you the parable the mystery that your Earthly story has a Heavenly meaning who am I talking to right now oh Heavenly signs Earthly signs we're going to get into something Isaiah 7:4 says the Lord himself shall give you a sign Heavenly or Earthly if the Lord's giving it he is the Lord of Heaven and Earth so if he's it's an Earthly sign and a Heavenly sign he doesn't give half a sign he shows it and then he produces it watch now I'll give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive that's a parable there's got to be a virgin that will fulfill this God is saying Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son what an earth story with a Heavenly meaning let's pay attention to the Parables the details of the story watch what David said I believe it was David in Psalms 49 sharpen your hearing sharpen your hearing I will incline my ear to a parable we incline our ear to many things especially chees Miss and right gossip and all the things really oh see kind of knew something was up I kind of I kind of figure did you ever pray for that person because you knew something was up no we don't do that that's out of the parable that's natural physical amen I will incline my ear Parable I want to know the how many of you want to know the parable incline your ear to it faith comes by hearing and the hearing of the word of God why are we not inclining our ear to that right let's continue we talk about other about about others without knowing the parable do you know if that person that is doing that or what they did do you know if it was part of the parable or not and you speak against it you're speaking against the parable stop for a moment here's Isaiah the Lord says I want you to strip down naked and I want you to walk the streets for three years naked walk in the streets for three years imagine the thoughts of the people at him St and think about that for a moment yet his life was a parable cuz he says what you're doing got another meaning to it the people could only see a naked man walking but the parable was showing destruction to Egypt and to these other nations by him doing that how do you know if God didn't tell that person to do that do you know the parable enough know if what is being done is actually God is telling them to do that open up your hearing I'll hear the parable are you with me you catch these things because it's very important listen now listen as this unfolds here think about this how many sons did Abraham have when he when he was told by God to sacrifice his son let me hear come on two we got a two everybody in agreement okay can you name me his sons okay God says sacrifice your son yeah yeah two sons every been agreement okay let's read let's read Galatians 4 and verse 22 for it is written that Abraham had two sons one by a bond made this is this is tremendous don't don't miss this the other by a free woman but he who was of the Bond woman was born after the Flesh in other words it only he only had an Earthly story ishma only has an Earthly story theyve got money they got all these things they only have Earthly because they were born from the Bond woman he was born from the Bond woman but he of the free woman was by the promise watch and here's the point of all this which things are an allegory now you're going to have to take the allegory Parable there's an allegory and in the allegory Abraham had two sons in the Earthly story Abraham had two sons period that's an allegory because an allegory always looks back to the past that's why Satan's not afraid of the allegory he's afraid of the parable once again here's the these things Bond woman free woman writing to the Galatians are an allegory it's always an allegory is always always stated in the past tense never in the future it simply brings out the teachings from the past events but he understand that that's an allegory Abraham having two sons is an allegory they are events that happened in the life of Abraham as a man but everything that Abraham did was part of the parable listen to this and get this church not everything that Abraham did was part of the parable it was an allegory something to learn from but watch now the parable unfold If Abraham had two sons why does the Bible say Genesis 222 he said take now thy son thine only son oh Church get this I'm going to say it again I thought he had two under the allegory he's got two but under the parable he's only got one because when you put it side by side it doesn't match until there's only one son Jesus or God didn't have many sons he had only one begotten Son stories to fit Abraham could only have one son how many are with me Hallelujah take now thy son th only son verse 16 and said by myself have I sworn sayth the Lord for because thou Hast done this thing and has not withheld thy son th only son oh here we are Hebrews 11:7 for by faith Abraham when he was tried he offered up Isaac he offered up Isaac and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called that's the parable accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead from when also he received him in a figure that word figure there in the Greek the same word as Parable say look it up that's the same thing he raised him up he received him in a figure me and my son will both return that's the parable oh I like this now are you with me now now we're we're going to get into some some more good stuff hold on with me do you see Satan is not not you don't care if you know the allegory but yet the allegories is there that we can learn from their stories but in the allegory is all the stries the wars the differences the struggles in the home of Abraham oh he was his life is the parable certain parts stop for a moment I want you to get Abraham brother Bram says he staggered all over the place and we say oh no Abraham didn't stag he staged all his wife saying well go ahead and take take Hagar do that wow okay he he was doing things that were not part of the par yet in the in the in the story line those things exist but not for the parable sake am here with me not for the parable sake here he is and this is this is what gets me he staggered all over the place until AA until churcha when Paul begins to write he writes this watch here's the parable he never says Abraham staggered here and here and here he did this begins to write under the inspiration all scripture is written it is God breathed that's not your concern you write what I tell you Abraham AB staggered not at the promise I'm going to say it again he he staggered all over the place yes but not at the promise we can stagger all over the place and Satan will use that against us they'll say you're worthless you're no good but that's not part of the parable because when it comes to the promise I am with you always even to the end of the ages when it comes to the promise True Believer will not stagger at that that's what we need to know this morning we might fail and we might fall but but we've got to repent and when we repent what does it do brings us back into the parable we step out of the parable at times but he gets his brother he puts a barricade there and says get back in line it won't be written about you what you did wrong as long as you have been made have made it right watch this now this is important the vision is the Heavenly or spiritual meaning and it is hidden in images and but a vision is is waiting for something it's waiting for the story to be carried out in the physical or natural realm a vision is projected into the one or ones that are fulfilling it a parable then is the mirror of the vision what the vision is showing here we go Parable now has has a a person an image of people that are there reflecting what the vision was showing in other words they're there to FF Vision this this is why I say this it is the images that is acting out what had been projected parables are not forced illustrations but rather the mirrors of spiritual things Parables prove that the external is the mirror in which we may behold the internal and the spiritual for all natural effects are based on spiritual causes write that down all natural effects are based on spiritual causes Parables a beautiful image from A Beautiful Mind when we see these things I want to get to this part now I want you to hear this and this is this is this is now this is the end end up end part of the message to take me just a little bit but follow me okay because we can preach forever and ever when James when Paul or James writes this I'm sorry he said for beholdeth we look into a glass right I'm going I'm going to do james23 for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass for he beholdeth himself and goeth Away straight way forget what manner of man he was but who so lookth into the perfect law of Liberty and continueth therein he being not forgetful here forgetful he did Uncle preach last Sunday somebody said the atonement is that right what scripture did he use forgetful here but a doer of this work this man shall be bless in his deed that's why when we see modern events made clear by prophecy it means one thing to the believer and one thing to the unbeliever get this now now this is the important part watch this now watch the parable Heaven and Earth Earthly story Heavenly meaning in the beginning quote it with me in the beginning God created the what was he doing laying out the scene for the parable so he created the heavens and the Earth laying it out I'm going to need in this great mind of his I'm the heavens I'm gonna need the Earth show stuff in the heavens first they'll catch it on Earth and then those that capture it will be in harmony they'll know what I'm telling them come on church here I am this is this is what we're this is what all the messages about right now created the heavens and the Earth We're Going bring it together they're going to know what I'm thinking and therefore they'll come back to me that's the whole Parable they came down and now they're going to come back watch this now and this and this is where it gets good he prepared the stage for the parable to unfold God always declares it where come on I want everybody because you got to get with me in this he declares it where where tell your neighbor neighbor where does he declare it in the heaven first ah okay brother Bram says that he CES it in the heavens before he does it on Earth he always does that oh and he shows his signs in the heavens first how many know the story of of Jonah right all right if we go down we can see he's going to Nineveh and supposed to go to ninev all these things happened and he ended up going to tarus they say tarus is is like on the other side of the Mediterranean 2500 miles away he was going we know the story how the Lord he was thrown over and the Lord provided and made a fish and so forth but when he finally got there this is the gist now when he finally got there he had a message to tell what was the message repent or perish right simple that was the message this is Jesus now talking 12 verse 38 the Ser of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered and said Master we would see a sign from thee an evil an adulterous generation seeketh after aign sign be given but the sign of the Prophet Jonas here we go now listen closely pinch yourself pinch yourself this morning no sign will be given an evil and adulterous generation but the sign of the Prophet Jonas of all the stories why did he pick the story of Jonah because he wants to prove something to them to show them something and he's putting he's bringing Jonah from the past he's bringing his own life see how that they perfectly match other prophets were for different parts I'm not giving you no other sign but if you can comprehend Jonah you can comprehend me watch this now here we go no sign but the sign of the Prophet Jonas what was the sign of Jonas ministers hold on a second people know this what was the sign of the Prophet Jonas very good some somebody got it over there the sign of the Prophet Jonas was the sign of the Resurrection I will not give this evil and adulterous generation no other sign but the sign of the Prophet Jonas or the sign of the Resurrection they're not going to see any other sign if you can receive the prophet then you can see me receive me watch this now this is Brother Bram now he says as the son of man as Jonah was in the whale three days three nights the son of man lay in the heart of the earth three days and three nights brother R says watch the parable brother Ram says then listen bring it to yourself that's good back in history right allegory oh Jonah ran away from God he did all God's even worried about that he knew he'd get him back cuz the parable had to unfold bring it to yourself it may be a new light on the scriptures here we go come on now here's the parable it may be a new light on the scriptures think of it like that it may be something but it's in the scripture the sign of Jonas would be the sign of the Resurrection they seek after ass sign the wicked and adulterous generation and now he says we got Resurrection by history but then we got Resurrection by sign though that is the theme of our of our of our services Resurrection by history or Resurrection by signs do you know the resurrection do you know it by history because the Bible says because somebody told you or do you know it by sign he said let's put new light on this scripture has now come to us we that him in US is the resurrection I am the resurrection and the life and no sign shall be given to them but the sign of the prophet Jonah what happened in the time time of Jonah go back and listen to what what the elders spoke how many love what the Elder when he speak his teachings love his teachings back in here what happened during the time of Jonah anybody somebody got the brother remember you got a student hereo right here there was an eclipse where does it say that study your history go back all the Assyrian books it shows an eclipse going on when Jonah was sent to nin now this is where it's going to get good okay wake up wake up Pi your neighbor up whoever is asleep stay awake this is where it's going to get I won't show this wicked and adulterous generation any other sign of Resurrection watch now they received for forgiven a sign but a true sign overlooked sign overlooked is the prophet he sent the prophet they overlook him out oh Jesus is coming Jesus is coming and they're missing the sign and and when you miss the sign you miss the parable okay watch this now the sign of the Resurrection The Sign of Jonah and God shows it in the heavens first when this when this solar eclipse happened the ninevites beli that a an eclipse was a precursor to God's judgment yes or yes is that right Theo that's right I got I got backup now how you like that an an an eclipse and then was a precursor to God's okay so either they had to have seen in the heavens first and that's why they knew that something was coming imagine that they never knew this in their lifetime and now us what do we do we take signs like if they're nothing another Blood Moon another eclipse Big W you're asleep you don't even know what's going on shows it in the heavens first Clos to this this is this is where where we're coming to now listen closer God said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven and let them be for signs Seasons days and years show the first first picture this is where we're at when I'm done with this you check your life and see where you're at let's see where you're at in the parable God G us an opportunity right now August 21st 2017 seven years ago there was a solar eclipse that crossed America going from the northeast or Northwest I'm sorry Southeast just in case you missed it it crossed over seven cities in America named Salem Salem the Salem Salem is the shortened name for Jerusalem what was he trying to tell us seven years he gave why because America parallels coincidence no no with the number two the second solar eclipse this one those of you how many are how many have have have looked into it have kept up with it this one will occur on April 8th 2024 will come from the southwest go to the Northeast there you see the trajectory the path and see it very well anyway you can see more or less right now this time why did I read about Jonah you can't write this stuff make this stuff up because this one will cross over seven cities in America that are named n brother brandham says that Wicked and adulterous generation is right now more wicked and adulterous generation than the people on Earth today it will go over seven cities in America scrip that write that figure that one out and not only that but there's also one one city in all of Canada that's named nineve and it's GNA cross there too if you want to know go online you can read all the Nineveh Texas Nineveh Missouri Indiana Ohio Pennsylvania New York Virginia that's where it's it's going up the eclipse is is hitting every Nineveh in America in America coincidence ninev means the house of fish it was the capital of the Syrian Empire now let's put this the next one up now where these two cross brother Ram says you get your own whatever you come what's the word he uses you come to your own conclusion is what look at that right where they cross it's a big X over the United States 1956 Bram says this nation will either accept or they'll reject it and I predict they will reject it says why later on he says they have sned away their day of Grace and I'm telling you this this this morning don't send away your day of Grace Church I cry unto you this morning as your pastor I cry to you don't send away your day of Grace how close are we Church throwing in the Heavens already a big X now now remember the X can be one thing to the believer and another thing to the unbel what does an mean in the Hebrew alphabet the old it's called tab is the last letter of the alphabet it is used as or sounds like the word t but it's the last in the Hebrew alphabet bit and in old times in the times of Ezekiel it was drawn As an X the last letter in the alphabet also symbolizes completion Perfection so while it's judgment to one completion and Perfection to someone else come on now Church where are you where are you today what does The X signify to you the X can be a signature I saw my grandparents use an X many times the X can Mark the Spot of the treasure the x in algebra is used as a variable for an unknown quantity an X symbolizes something known mystery and to the world we are a mystery to the world judgment to Us mystery hidden treasure [Music] hidden watch The Mystery of the parable now what was Jonah's message a message of repentance how many how many days did he give Jonah or did Jonah give them to repent come on he gave him 40 days to repent the king the people the animals all of them went on a fast all of them put on sackcloth crying to God forgive us Lord that's what we need this morning is a true repentance cry to God saying Lord for for me Lord I Repent or everything here's my heart open to you how much time do you think we have church when the skies the heavens are declaring there there's not a whole lot of time left as it was in the days of Jonah that's the parable catch it church it's unfolding right now in our midst just another one 40 days you know what 40 days from August 8th when that when that eclipse is May 18th International astronomy day what that supposed to mean well we're astronauts aren't we but the very next day after the 40 days is Pentecost look it up we have been in the Pentecostal ages all through the church age of Pentecost now watch 40 days from then the very next day is the is Pentecost everyone's looking for a Revival now Catholic Church is looking for a real life they started in 2022 the Eucharistic Revival brother brandham says they take a little little piece of bread they say the church can transform it into the literal body and I say no way you want to know the body of the Lord Jesus on Earth today is made of flesh and blood it is the people that have been washed and transformed by the blood of the Lamb going on here they're looking for a little piece of bread I'm looking for the bread of life that has come down to earth and is dwelling in the hearts of the believer to do what to fulfill or unfold the parable Church noen notice this now and I'm and I'm I'm coming to to an end now just bear me a few moments coming to a place 40 days of repentance and I'm going to tell you in the name of the Lord now is the opportunity repent I don't care if you have to tell your wife everything you did what you've been up to because afterwards there is no more grace take advantage of the grace while it's here church because once it's taken it's done you want to make things right and it'll be too late but the Bible says let him that is filthy be filthy come on now you watch porn you'll end up staying being a porn Watcher that's what going to do let him that's filthy be filthy you're an adulterer you're going to stay an adulterer you're a liar you're going to stay a liar you're a gossiper you're going to stay a gossiper let him that's filthy be filthy still but let him that's clean be clean you're a Son of God you're a Believer you'll stay a Believer church I know it's hard but I'm telling you I want you to make it I do not want to leave not one of you here this is pray from my heart I cry to you this morning get a hold of the horns of the altar are declaring show it in the heavens first come down to earth now maned on Earth I'm going to add one last piece and when you add the eclipse that happened last October I believe what do you get if the X was the last letter of the Hebrew the first letter of the Greek alphabet is Alpha and to the believer that's showing I am Alpha and Omega I am the beginning and the end that has been with you is I that walks amongst you here amongst you and in the end last was which is and shall be all three of those things what does it show judgment to one Eternity for the others where do you find yourself this morning we can look at all this and say my Bleak it looks bad for the unbeliever but for the believer what a masterpiece he is what a masterpiece he's making I'm going to say it again what a masterpiece he could take you and I he could make Sons and Daughters people that were no good that were lost that had no hope and he could make us Sons and Daughters painting a masterpiece how the Sun and the Moon 91 million miles away from each other come together a Passover you who are spiritual a Passover and would create the corona how is that possible the heavens declare the glory of God I want to just tell you this now I'm finishing now this is the end of the Gentile age mark it in your your in your word in your Bible brother Bram says there's nothing left for America but judgment thank God we are Americans and live here they cannot be saved as a nation but as an individual his grace free because they sinned away their day of Grace God's Great Masterpiece and I want to tell you one thing here's the end of it okay you want to see where we're at there is only one one place in the United States that is named this and it's in the state of Indiana and it's right in the path of the eclipse I can't make this up church but it's right in the path of the eclipse and it's called Rapture India Rapture indana now you tell me where we you tell me how serious we should be he's already showing it in the heavens the only thing left is for it to come to Earth as brother will comes I can go on and on and doesn't I don't need to say much more but how close are we I'm going to tell you how close we are such a hard week this week that all man all hell was hitting it was Battle after battle everywhere we returned it was such a joy to me to be in the middle of that battle it wasn't something bad it was a joy to be in that battle I said Lord because you're in the Forefront there's nothing to fear we took care of things one thing after another after another and it was the Lord working mightily in this week with people demons out of people Healing The Sick taking people lost and and and you can see the Lord transforming them right before my eyes I saw this I saw new births coming I was so tired on on Wednesday Thursday night finally went to sleep and lo and behold here's the parable I'm fast asleep and then in this I break open into whether a night vision or whatever you want to call it and it was me and brother Tommy and brother will Tommy will and we were climbing we had climbed this ladder and we got to this platform that we could see out very far looking around and I said this is what you call come up a little higher There Was An Open Door come up higher and about the time we're they up there looking around somebody's coming when I turn it's our founding Pastor he comes up doesn't say a word but gives me that smile that he love to give and all I could do was feel from within me from the treasures of my heart all I could feel was just love and I said Dad I love you and I got him I could feel him a dream I could feel him how close are we now church when when when the dead in Christ start to become visible how close are we hold him and I hugged him and I said dad I missed you about Time Boom it ends you don't want it to end you want to hold on to it the the smile that he gave was this press the battle keep going it's all worth it church I tell you that this morning press the battle going it'll be worth it at the end as you stand to your feet rapor Indiana indana that's where the Prophet was from and I tell you this day this is your opportunity don't say brother Caleb said this 40 days don't say that I'm saying that the heavens are declaring that it's a parable it may be more it may be less a parable that's what you have to find out don't wait too long church if you have to make something right make it right with your husband or with your wife or with your children or whatever bow your heads it's today that we say get a hold of the horns of the altar if there's somebody that says brother I need help pray I to get a hold of it this moment is for you if you're doing okay then pray for others but this is an opportunity were brother I've done I think I'm living okay it's not about living okay beyond that it's about knowing who you are it's about knowing that you're part of the parable because when true repentance happens those sins are blotted out I'm going to say it again those things that are forgiven you are not part of the parable because what's placed into the sea of forgetfulness God doesn't remember that no more it's not part of his parable so I say Church make sure Parable doesn't mean it's going to be this or that it may be more less it it'll happen on Earth but it's already shown in the heaven that if today you hear his voice don't Harden your heart Lord we come before you as a congregation Lord yet Lord as individuals too Lord Lord not wanting to send away our day of Grace but the heavens have already declared it Lord and they will declare it Lord but Lord now is the time of repentance Lord that's what Jonah went and preached repent or perish and so Lord I come before you with all these people that have come Lord with nothing to hide our hearts and minds and all open to you this this moment Lord and I pray that you come down and that you meet them Lord theyve taken a step towards you now Lord I pray you take a step towards them and by the power Lord of almighty God that is in this building oh Lord we take every unclean Spirit under our control in the name of Jesus I declare these people free Lord chains that have bound them may the chains be broken this morning may every one of them Lord walk out of this building Lord a free person
