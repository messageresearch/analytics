[0:08] i saw under the altar the souls of them
[0:12] that were slain for the word of god
[0:15] and for the testimony which they held
[0:19] and they cried with a loud voice saying
[0:22] how long
[0:25] oh lord
[0:26] holy and true does not judge and avenge
[0:29] our blood on them that dwell on the
[0:32] earth and white robes were given un
[0:35] unto every one of them and it was said
[0:39] unto them that they should rest yet
[0:42] for a little season
[0:44] until their fellow servants also their
[0:47] brethren
[0:48] that should be killed as they were
[0:51] should be fulfilled

[1:14] fifth seal now
[1:16] there's there's there's no rider goes
[1:19] forth
[1:21] and there's no
[1:23] beast to announce
[1:24] it that is that the mystery of the
[1:28] church ages are already finished at this
[1:31] time
[1:32] the mystery of the antichrist
[1:35] is revealed
[1:37] at this time
[1:38] the antichrist took his last ride
[1:42] and we found him on this pale horse
[1:45] mixed with these many colors and rides
[1:48] all the way into perditions right
[1:51] there they're waving the church age the
[1:53] church absolutely
[1:54] is raptured at this time
[1:56] the church goes up in the fourth chapter
[1:59] of revelations and does not return till
[2:02] it comes back with this king
[2:04] in the 19th chapter
[2:06] but these seals here are revealing what
[2:09] has been
[2:10] what is and what will be
[2:14] notice
[2:15] when the antichrist or
[2:18] them them
[2:19] revelations in the presence of that ball
[2:22] of fire hanging there in a room oh
[2:24] brother
[2:26] although i've seen since a child
[2:28] every time it comes near me it alarms it
[2:31] he almost puts in an unconscious
[2:33] condition
[2:35] you never get used to it you can
[2:38] it's too sacred
[2:40] now
[2:41] notice not on the ninth verse souls
[2:44] under the altar
[2:46] now here's where i'm gonna get some real
[2:49] [Music]
[2:51] disagrees
[2:53] but i just watched just a minute yes see
[2:56] i thought that too but it
[2:58] didn't come that way
[3:00] we've i've always thought
[3:02] that these souls under the altar were
[3:05] the the the martyrs of the early church
[3:08] and i'm sure that
[3:10] well dr us smith and everyone says it is
[3:13] see
[3:14] but i thought so myself
[3:16] but when the holy spirit showed the
[3:18] vision to it it wasn't
[3:22] that isn't the soul now who are these
[3:24] souls
[3:26] that's the next thing who are they that
[3:28] if they're not the early church
[3:32] this is israel
[3:35] that's to be saved as a nation
[3:38] all them that are predestinated
[3:42] that's israel
[3:43] that's israel itself for i would not
[3:47] brethren that you should be ignorant of
[3:49] the mystery
[3:53] thus you should be wise in your own
[3:55] conceit
[4:00] the blindness
[4:02] in part
[4:03] is happened to israel until the
[4:05] fulfilling fullness
[4:07] of the gentiles become in
[4:10] as it is written
[4:12] that shall come out of zion are
[4:14] delivered
[4:16] and shall turn away ungodliness for
[4:19] jacob
[4:21] what
[4:22] israel was blinded
[4:26] for the very purpose
[4:28] of us being saved
[4:31] notice
[4:32] now
[4:34] i want you to watch this real close
[4:37] they were given robes
[4:40] they didn't have
[4:42] they were given robes
[4:44] white robes each one of them
[4:47] now the saints
[4:50] now have
[4:51] already have one
[4:53] they get it here
[4:54] [Music]
[4:55] but there they were giving robes
[4:57] and the saints already had theirs and
[4:59] gone on
[5:01] see
[5:02] see they had
[5:04] had not
[5:06] the these souls
[5:09] understanding now that's under the altar
[5:12] why they were martyred
[5:14] by sinful man like eichmann
[5:17] see they're holding right on millions of
[5:20] them
[5:21] but they remain
[5:22] jews now remember what wasn't they were
[5:27] killed for the word of god sake
[5:31] not for the testimony of christ did you
[5:32] understand that but remember the church
[5:34] come in also the martyrs of the church
[5:37] was for
[5:38] the word of god and the testimony of
[5:40] jesus christ i mean it was that your
[5:42] truth all right now but these didn't
[5:46] have the testimony of jesus christ for
[5:48] the word of god and for the testimony
[5:50] which they helped the jews and hitler
[5:54] hated them so did i
[5:55] started stalling all the rest of the
[5:57] world
[5:58] but they stayed true to what they
[6:00] believed
[6:02] and they killed them because they were
[6:04] jews
[6:09] that's right and for their testimony
[6:11] they helped they were martyred
[6:14] and here was souls under the altar
[6:16] after
[6:17] the church had been gone now what
[6:22] they had in their blindness martyred
[6:25] their messiah
[6:28] and now they were reaping for it
[6:31] they realized that they recognized it
[6:33] has gone on they've seen them when they
[6:35] come before they alter god
[6:37] but now watch the grace of god comes to
[6:40] them
[6:41] and jesus gives them each one a white
[6:43] robe
[6:46] watch pull over after the church is gone
[6:51] like joseph did to his brethren a tithe
[6:55] look when joseph stood there and when he
[6:57] finally made himself going there for the
[6:59] altar
[7:01] [Music]
[7:14] and he said to him he said
[7:16] don't you know me
[7:18] oh hey he's speaking hebrew now
[7:21] i'm your brother joseph
[7:25] oh my they said nah oh you're going to
[7:27] get so wait a minute wait a minute
[7:29] god did that for a purpose
[7:31] had you to throw me out in order to save
[7:34] life
[7:37] [Applause]
[7:39] [Music]
[7:40] don't be angry with yourselves remember
[7:42] joseph said that which is a type of 144
[7:45] thousands we'll get later
[7:47] what he did he just run right quick the
[7:49] benjamin fell on his neck started
[7:50] hugging
[7:51] his little brother that had been born
[7:53] into the family after he had been gone
[7:57] by his mother
[8:01] the first church
[8:02] the orthodox church the 144 thousand
[8:06] were born in his absence
[8:08] while he's awake and get his gentile
[8:10] bride
[8:16] so you see who they are
[8:19] these jews 144 000
[8:22] is to be called out
[8:24] by the two witnesses of revelation 11.
[8:30] now remember there was to prophesy
[8:32] notice
[8:33] these souls
[8:35] are to
[8:36] wait a little season for the 144 to be
[8:41] martyred
[8:42] oh isn't that isn't that just puts the
[8:44] bible together well listen i just got
[8:46] something to tell you it's just so good
[8:48] it's just burning right in my heart
[8:50] i hope you haven't forgotten
[8:51] [Music]
[8:53] let me say this in the presence of him
[8:56] by
[8:57] his grace
[8:59] he also let me see my people
[9:03] not long ago and white ruins
[9:06] remember
[9:09] you remember the story
[9:11] not long ago
[9:13] the gentile bride
[9:15] they're there now
[9:17] they're always in white robes
[9:20] notice this now
[9:23] now if there's no altar
[9:26] of sacrifice
[9:28] in heaven
[9:29] where is the sacrifice for sin land
[9:34] the land
[9:39] there has to be a place where that
[9:40] slaying lamb bloody is laying there or
[9:44] the blood or i do think brother by the
[9:46] opening of this fifth seal as i believe
[9:50] that it's open to us
[9:53] i did it
[9:54] with good conscience
[9:56] with clear revelation before god
[10:00] not trying to just make it think because
[10:02] i always was against the organization
[10:04] never would belong to him
[10:06] but it's open to me now
