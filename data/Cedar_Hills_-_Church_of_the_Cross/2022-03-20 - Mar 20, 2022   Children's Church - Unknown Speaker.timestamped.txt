[30:48] oh just thinking of this gets me alright
[30:53] so i had
[30:55] my first show ever
[30:57] on tv
[30:59] and i hired a new chef
[31:02] and i had all confidence in him
[31:04] he did a great interview
[31:06] i thought man this guy is the cat's meow
[31:10] turns out
[31:12] i couldn't trust the guy
[31:14] he ate all my inventory
[31:18] do you guys believe me or not yeah yeah
[31:21] well i don't think you do because i i
[31:23] want to show you a little video of this

[32:10] delicious
[32:11] gooey
[32:13] chewy
[32:15] fabulous fantastical brownies
[32:18] and today we got a very special employee
[32:22] he just started here at the bakery so
[32:24] i'm very proud of this young man i have
[32:26] very high expectations for him so let's
[32:29] put our hands together for mr
[32:33] chef
[32:34] chubby cheek chicas
[32:38] hello how are you today
[32:41] very good so today we're going to be
[32:43] doing the brownie it's a very
[32:46] important cornerstone to the baking
[32:49] world
[32:51] so today we've got see brownie i just
[32:53] put them in and i'm just going to take
[32:55] them out you know it's just that fast on
[32:57] the cooking show
[32:58] and they're already ready to eat
[33:01] but chef it's very important to know
[33:05] that these brownies are for a wedding
[33:07] so we must let them cool off
[33:10] because they're going to serve as the
[33:12] bottom of the cake so if you eat the
[33:14] brown or if you touch the brownie too
[33:16] early they will crumble and melt
[33:19] i got to go take care of some visits in
[33:21] the back here i want you to watch the
[33:24] brownies garden with your life
[33:26] and just don't touch them okay they're
[33:28] very important this chocolate came from
[33:31] paris
[33:36] [Music]
[34:11] so
[34:14] [Music]
[34:21] i'm almost done
[34:23] [Music]
[34:38] what chef doesn't know won't hurt
[34:43] [Music]
[34:49] that's
[34:53] [Music]
[35:14] why
[35:17] [Music]
[35:23] don't come back
[35:27] [Music]
[35:38] okay okay so i shouldn't have been so
[35:40] hard on him right
[35:42] yeah
[35:43] but the little meatball did it
[35:45] i cannot believe this
[35:47] it makes me so upset just to see that
[35:49] again
[35:50] that's all i had for the week and he ate
[35:52] all of it
[35:54] so
[35:55] after thinking about it this last week i
[35:57] said well
[35:58] you know it's not very christian of me
[35:59] just to kick him out
[36:01] he has a family to feed
[36:03] so
[36:04] in front of you all i have invited him
[36:06] back
[36:08] to come see if maybe he's a changed man
[36:10] over the course of the week
[36:12] and i also want to apologize to him
[36:14] so with that said i'd like to introduce
[36:18] chef
[36:19] chubby cheek chicas
[36:22] [Applause]
[36:34] [Music]
[36:36] are you doing good
[36:38] all right i hope you don't eat me out of
[36:39] this place again
[36:41] i was hungry you know i was hungry
[36:43] you're always hungry
[36:46] stop it
[36:47] i'll give you the spoon
[36:49] [Music]
[36:54] okay
[36:56] so today
[36:59] are you okay
[37:01] okay
[37:03] so
[37:03] real quick
[37:05] do you know what patience is
[37:08] i mean you
[37:11] okay i don't know
[37:13] why don't you help your friend out
[37:15] um
[37:16] it's
[37:17] when you be quiet
[37:20] oh who taught you that
[37:23] is he right
[37:29] no
[37:32] it means that
[37:34] it means that you wait for something
[37:38] right that's the perfect answer
[37:40] did you hear that
[37:42] you wait for something
[37:44] you don't take it by force
[37:47] okay
[37:48] so why do you think it's so important to
[37:50] be patient can you tell me
[38:03] why is it important to be patient
[38:06] uh
[38:07] because you wanna
[38:09] patient
[38:11] yes yes i think we all can agree on that
[38:15] but yeah i know you can tell me
[38:19] okay
[38:20] so it's very important to be patient
[38:23] because
[38:24] you will burn the brownies
[38:26] or you take them out and they melt all
[38:28] over
[38:30] but in this case we want to talk a
[38:32] little bit more in depth
[38:35] so it's very important to be patient
[38:37] because god he has great plans for each
[38:40] and every one of us
[38:45] he has very
[38:46] great plans for all of us
[38:49] but we have to go through a season of
[38:51] testing
[38:52] in this case
[38:54] he did not pass the test
[38:56] i asked him to watch for
[38:58] five minutes that's all it was and he
[39:00] could not do it
[39:02] i come back and he's licking the pot
[39:06] so today
[39:07] we're going to make a little recipe here
[39:10] you want to help me chef chef
[39:12] all right
[39:14] so it's gonna call for two heaping cups
[39:17] of you guessed it patience
[39:20] so go ahead
[39:21] hold my mic
[39:24] hold it for me
[39:25] it's gonna call for two whooping heaping
[39:27] cups of patience
[39:29] let's see
[39:30] there's a cup there
[39:32] i think we can just
[39:35] i think that will do
[39:39] a heart full of love
[39:42] well
[39:43] this will be our heart
[39:45] and it's full of love
[39:50] that's pretty good
[39:54] a dash of laughter
[39:56] show me your laugh
[39:59] [Music]
[40:03] don't make me dump this flower on your
[40:04] head
[40:05] you show me your laughs
[40:10] oh my gosh
[40:14] and a sprinkle of kindness
[40:20] so what you do with these ingredients
[40:22] is you combine them all together
[40:24] patients love kindness and a little bit
[40:26] of understanding
[40:28] with a dash of laughter
[40:30] and you want to serve this to everybody
[40:32] you come in contact with
[40:34] for your entire life
[40:36] does that make sense
[40:39] so
[40:42] let's let this cook for a little bit
[40:46] again i have something very important in
[40:48] the bag that i have to go take care of
[40:50] okay can i trust you this time chef yes
[40:53] yes
[40:54] okay i'm going to be right back
[41:04] smells good
[41:05] [Music]
[41:19] [Music]
[41:26] raise your hand if you think i should do
[41:27] it
[41:28] [Music]
[41:32] no ready if you think i shouldn't do it
[41:35] oh he doesn't have no help
[41:38] i'm almost done
[41:40] no chef's coming back
[41:41] i think pink butcher
[41:44] better make him think he can trust he
[41:46] yes i trust
[41:49] well maybe maybe i'll pray
[41:55] dear lord
[41:56] may you give me the patience to not eat
[41:59] this delicious soup in jesus name amen
[42:07] well i'm a new man so
[42:09] see what we do
[42:28] just checking
[42:38] and do it
[42:39] be wrong i'm just watching you
[42:41] don't mind me i'm still busy back here
[42:49] shouldn't eat it do i think i should eat
[42:51] it
[42:56] do you think i should eat it or no
[43:01] i'm guessing uh um
[43:06] [Music]
[43:14] well i have a scripture i'm going to
[43:16] read so the recipe says
[43:18] my brethren count it all joy when you
[43:21] fall into temptations
[43:24] knowing that the trying of your faith
[43:26] works patience
[43:28] but
[43:29] let patience have her perfect work
[43:32] that you may be perfect and entire
[43:35] wanting nothing
[43:41] okay
[43:43] let's see
[43:45] how's our soup coming along
[43:48] perfecto
[43:50] and you didn't eat it
[43:52] great
[43:58] well you don't think it's so mad my
[44:00] goodness
[44:01] i just asked you to watch it and ask me
[44:03] to eat it anyway
[44:05] all right
[44:08] well
[44:10] i approve of your honesty and you are
[44:12] welcome back at my kitchen anytime
[44:15] and i will be inviting you again to be
[44:18] on linguine live okay
[44:21] all right
[44:22] can we give him a hand
[44:30] so
[44:32] i'm very proud of him for two reasons
[44:34] first of all he didn't eat my soup
[44:38] segment second of all he came back
[44:41] and he was a good sport and he allowed
[44:44] me to trust him
[44:46] so
[44:47] what's so important about this
[44:49] is that sometimes
[44:51] we pray for patients right we want to be
[44:53] more patient
[44:54] in certain things maybe it's with our
[44:56] brother or sister
[44:58] but a lot of times
[45:00] god will continue to give you the same
[45:02] test over and over and over
[45:04] and maybe you're praying lord take this
[45:06] test away
[45:07] i want to have more patience well the
[45:09] way he's going to give you the patience
[45:11] is by giving you the same test until you
[45:14] can show
[45:15] that that is no longer
[45:17] a hard thing for you to get over
[45:20] so like my brother here
[45:23] his temptation
[45:24] or his test was the brownie
[45:27] he loves to eat and it's very hard for
[45:30] him to pass up food so when these
[45:32] brownies were sitting there
[45:34] the first time he fell and he wasn't
[45:36] able to resist it
[45:38] second time comes along
[45:40] and he did better
[45:42] and he was given a chance to prove that
[45:45] and so i want to just pass that along to
[45:47] you all today
[45:49] that we must be patient
[45:51] when we go through a certain test
[45:53] just know that it's going to work
[45:55] patience
[45:56] and patience will then help your faith
[45:58] to grow
[45:59] and you'll be a better christian in the
[46:01] long run
[46:02] so don't get all stood up
[46:05] when you have to go to these
[46:07] tests
[46:08] it's all to help you be a better
[46:09] christian
[46:11] how many want to be a better christian
[46:14] amen so who can now tell me what
[46:16] patience means
[46:20] you told me i think she can tell me
[46:26] when
[46:29] yes you wait on the lord amen
[46:32] let him
[46:34] be the one who opens the doors let him
[46:36] be the one
[46:37] who takes you to the next step of your
[46:39] life
[46:40] don't try to force it open
[46:42] just let the lord open the door for you
[46:44] and you can simply walk in
[46:46] and be a happy christian boy and girl
[46:50] so i thank you for coming to my show
[46:52] today we look forward to seeing you next
