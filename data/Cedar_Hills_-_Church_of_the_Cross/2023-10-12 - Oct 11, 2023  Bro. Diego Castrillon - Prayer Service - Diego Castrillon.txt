prayer service I also want to invite the ones that are watching us on the intern to join us today in this moment in this hour that our armor faith can become stronger portion of his holy spirit alt together with ours that we can fulfill the scripture when they would sing this song of of David Saul he made 100 flee but David he made 10,000 flee there where you're at I would ask you to open your scriptures in Acts chapter 12 we're going to read the petitions first if you were unable to bring a petition don't worry Our God does not see this paper he's not saying oh let's see brother what the paper says thanks be to God he's not a man is a spirit he can see your heart and mine that is all he needs he wants to see faith I'm GNA read this petition in Spanish and then the petitions that are in English I'm only going to read them in Spanish to save time [Music] G now the position is in English please pray for Phoebe Maru her baby is in the ICU in aluer please pray for Jacob he has an upper respiratory infection God bless bless you brothers and sisters requesting prayer for my brother heading for an infection that doesn't want to heal the Lord grant him mercy and Grace and he will be healed before the before he sees the bone specialist from our sister Isabelle please keep in prayer as I have a few upcoming labs to do May everything come out fine God bless you brother Milo ask him for prayer for my right hand if has been in constant pain for the past two days thank you God bless you Sister Shelby Medina God bless you Saints please remember my my mother Ramona and I as we travel back from Louisiana together tomorrow to Las Cruzes New Mexico God bless you Sister Sil silver we're gonna be praying for the petitions that are on the internet God is here and he will answer them I would ask you to stand I want to help your faith a little bit before we start praying and for that I want to use the scriptures let us open the Bible in the book of Acts chapter 12 I want you to notice how this Story begins I believe that it looks like what is happening today the scripture reads like this act chapter 12 vers 1-5 now about that time the time of Herod The King The King stretched forth his hand to give them a comfortable time it doesn't say like that to take them camping the Bible is clear to Vex that was the time that her brothers the apostles were living in and he killed James the brother of John with the [Applause] sword and because he saw it please the Jews he proceeded further to take Peter also than were the days of the unleavened bread when we when he had apprehended him he put him in prison and delivered him to four cenans of soldiers to keep him intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people now watch this service that that the next the the next verse Peter was therefore kept in prison listen the next part but but prayer was made without seasoning of the church unto God for him I'm gonna read it again but prayer was made without pleasing of the church unto God for him let us pray Lord very good evening we prepare ourselves for this prayer service Inspire us with the scriptures to recognize what you have given us to face the enemy so be it to be be the to you be the glory in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ please be seated give me eight minutes I want you to see the the situation the the the the the situation of this time Jacob had been killed Herod had killed him Al together with other Christians in that time the Pol political power and the religious power had gotten together to bring a persecution against the Primitive church now if that seems like a a small thing the Bible says that Peter was he was taken by Herod I don't need to be a prophet to know what was going to happen to Peter what his destination was what was going to happen happened to him that was the picture but the scriptures say that the church would pray until they would fall asleep no they would make prayer until they got hungry they would make prayer without ceasing for Peter before God maybe you don't understand these scriptures but if we go to Luke chapter 18 Jesus he gives us the key he gives us the tools to understand what we have to do in this hour in this time in this moment Luke chapter 18 the parable of the Widow and the unrighteous judge and he speak a parable saying he speak a parable unto them to this end that man not always to pray and not to faint to to pray always at all time what does it mean brother dieo we have to pray when things are going good we have to pray when we're going to lay down we have to pray when we're going to get we have to pray at work we have to pray when things are going wrong we have to pray at all times Jesus say and there wasn't a city a judge which feared not God and neither regarded man I believe that Parable was written for this time that we have men that have power that they don't fear God they and they don't regard any man and there was a widow in that City and she came unto him saying avenge me of my adversary Jesus calls a character and she he calls her a widow there's no weaker and vul more vulnerable person a widow she didn't have anyone to defend she didn't have any children any family she didn't have any money she was a defenseless woman but she had an she had an adversary verse four and he would not for a while but after what he said with him within himself do I fear not God nor regard man yet because this wi of trouble with me I will avenge her lest by her continual coming she weary me these are the words of Jesus and the Lord said hear what the unjust just judge said shall not God avenge [Music] shall not God avenge what is your need what is your worry what is your fear at every level pastors ministers churches what is your fear what do you need shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him God here he gives it for his elect that cry not only by day but also at night he's not talking about a day and a night he talking about the good the evil times in the day and evil times at [Applause] night though he be along with them I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth Peter he was going to be killed he had a death sentence there was nothing to do there was no human power on the earth to deliver him and the Bible says but but a church I imagine it was a family a small group that started praying because they understood what Jesus said to them shall God not avenge his elect that cry day and night unto him someone took control the leadership of that family of that group and they organized a prayer group and they said you're going to pray eight hours when you get tired the other one's going to pray eight hours and the other one hours and the other one8 hours they were praying without seing I imagine Heaven the Angels praising God God receiving the glory I do this for you to understand this is just a drama for you to understand when prayers began to happen not in the amount of people what God hears it is the quality what moves God and those men started to pray Lord save Peter send an angel to help Lord we need they're gonna kill that's what they were praying Peter Peter Peter when a voice started to be heard Praises in heaven Peter Peter Peter Peter when the Angels were praising that name started to sound Peter I believe God said wait a moment what is that voice what is that voice there was the sister Lord Peter they're going to kill him we need him Lord they killed James and the others but we need Peter when in heaven God heard the prayer without ceasing what God did the angel go answer the prayer when the Angel takes Peter Peter out he goes and knocks at the door house where they were praying Peter never never knew what happened he never knew that there was an army of four an army of four that moved Heaven on the favor of his children and his elect here we are brother not to waste time here we we are to pray we're going to unite our faith the Bible cannot fail God will Advent us whatever you need whatever you're looking for God will answer it but do not stay with this prayer only keep praying keep praying keep praying I invite you this evening that if you have fails A Little Bit of Faith now that the word has called you elect that the word has told you that he's going to answer the tells you whatever you ask I'll do it I invite you in this hour that if you feel in your heart now that we're going to pray if you feeling your heart to come to the front or just standing
