[38:25] their seats if everyone get their Bibles
[38:30] out we're going to turn to Matthew
[38:42] 516 and it reads like
[38:48] this let your light so shine before men
[38:52] that they may see your good works and
[38:54] glorify your father which is in heaven
[39:10] you may be
[39:13] seated so first off I just want to give
[39:15] thanks to our
[39:18] pastor for encouraging me to go to
[39:21] Mexico allow to speak
[39:25] tonight
[39:27] Mex and I also want to thank brother
[39:29] Paco for taking us in at the youth
[39:35] camp and I want to thank three brothers
[39:38] that went with me to
[39:42] Mexico uh for making it a special
[39:46] trip and for those that know that don't
[39:49] know that was my first missionary
[39:55] Tri
[40:01] it's actually kind of funny how it
[40:05] happened because in the past couple
[40:07] weeks I've been struggling a little
[40:12] bit just dealing with personal thoughts
[40:15] in my head and my walk with
[40:20] God and so I ended up having a meeting
[40:23] with the
[40:25] pastor
[40:27] and telling him that I felt disconnected
[40:29] and that I wanted to
[40:34] reconnect and so he tells me you want to
[40:36] reconnect with
[40:39] God and at that moment you know I didn't
[40:42] hear the pastor I heard the Lord
[40:49] talking and he tells me how would you
[40:51] like to go to
[40:54] Mexico so at that that moment you know I
[40:57] decided why not we got to get this
[40:58] started
[41:02] anyways so then I got my passport got
[41:04] our tickets and we were off to
[41:09] Mexico and like the other brothers said
[41:11] it wasn't an easy time getting
[41:16] there you know brother Enzo lost his
[41:18] ring at the
[41:22] airport we ended up having a 4-Hour
[41:24] delay to get there he
[41:29] so that ended up making us miss the
[41:31] first
[41:34] night but we still made
[41:38] it so I'm just going to give a little
[41:40] report of the trip to
[41:45] Mexico you know I'd never been to Mexico
[41:47] so it was beautiful sight to see on the
[41:49] way over
[41:53] there and at the same time it was a very
[41:55] humbling
[41:59] experience you know before we got to the
[42:02] youth
[42:06] camp we stopped to get something to
[42:10] eat and it was a little taco
[42:14] shop got to have the
[42:17] tacos but as we ate there and finished
[42:24] up and as we were getting ready to pay
[42:27] and we TI the
[42:34] server um when we gave him a tip that
[42:37] wasn't so large to us but to him it was
[42:44] enormous and I remember us walking out
[42:46] the taco shop and me looking to my
[42:52] left and I just saw tears coming down
[42:54] his eyes
[42:59] so that was that was really nice to
[43:03] see so then we got to the youth
[43:06] camp and if the brothers can put up the
[43:09] first picture with the
[43:12] grass so that was out in the
[43:16] courtyard um it's very beautiful up
[43:19] there in the
[43:21] mountains um and it was just for me it
[43:25] was mind-blowing just to be
[43:30] so when we get there we got there late
[43:32] Friday
[43:36] night we had missed most the first day
[43:38] because of our
[43:41] DeLay So when we got there it was night
[43:44] time
[43:46] already um but when we got there the
[43:48] guys were tired we all wanted to go to
[43:54] bed but all the youth were having a
[43:56] specials
[44:02] night and so me and Ethan decided to go
[44:05] and and join
[44:08] them and that was really special because
[44:11] even though I didn't understand what
[44:12] they were
[44:16] singing you can just tell that they were
[44:18] singing with all their
[44:23] heart and so the next day we woke
[44:28] up and pretty much the whole second day
[44:30] we were doing activities with the
[44:35] youth you know if the brothers can put
[44:37] up the second picture with the
[44:40] youth the other
[44:45] one well it's one with us
[44:52] outside um and we were just having a
[44:54] bunch of games and activities going
[44:58] on and like I said even though we had a
[45:01] language barrier between each other
[45:02] because I don't understand
[45:05] Spanish um we literally felt like family
[45:07] next to each other going through all the
[45:13] activities yeah you know they were
[45:14] having us do the hair on
[45:18] Samson doing some weird volleyball with
[45:21] the
[45:24] blanket
[45:26] and we even did a relay with tic tac
[45:30] toe tac toe and apparently to Ethan and
[45:32] some of the youth I was an NFL
[45:39] allar
[45:42] football so that was that was very fun
[45:45] um and very personal to
[45:49] me because I didn't grow up in the
[45:51] message
[45:53] so that was pretty much like my first
[45:55] youth experience in
[46:00] total so it was nice to be out
[46:04] there um and then we got into the
[46:07] services at night Saturday
[46:13] night and that itself was an experience
[46:16] out of the
[46:20] world that night brother Seth and Enzo
[46:22] spoke to the
[46:24] youth
[46:27] uh and you know I felt like I was part
[46:30] of the youth there getting lectured as
[46:36] well but what really got me that
[46:41] night um if the brothers can put that
[46:43] last photo back
[46:45] up was when Enzo made an alter
[46:51] call and just to see the spirit of God
[46:58] moving those kids and everyone that was
[47:01] there at the
[47:05] service that was
[47:07] tremendous you know I think every single
[47:10] Youth and person there went up to the
[47:14] altar so that was just nice to be a part
[47:16] of that to see that we can take that to
[47:18] them in
[47:23] Mexico and so because of the delays
[47:28] um me Ethan and Ronnie got pushed to
[47:32] Sunday Ron
[47:36] uh and so pretty much the reason I went
[47:39] was to give my testimony to the youth
[47:45] there and for those that don't know I'll
[47:47] share a little bit of
[47:52] it you know I was explaining to the
[47:54] youth that I didn't grow up in the
[47:59] message you know I saw a very different
[48:02] lifestyle at my
[48:08] home and that's not something I wish any
[48:11] of you used to go
[48:17] through and so I was explaining to them
[48:19] that as I grew up that became my
[48:23] life now I didn't have any back ground
[48:26] in the message going to church or any of
[48:32] that and as events went on in my life I
[48:35] really my past from what I saw as a
[48:38] childhood really attached
[48:47] itself me you know I became addicted to
[48:50] drugs
[48:53] myself I became an alcohol
[48:58] I became abusive towards my my
[49:04] spouse and other things in that
[49:09] nature and you know I got to a point in
[49:11] my life where I thought I was
[49:18] done you know after I just went through
[49:20] a breakup I was struggling with
[49:21] depression really
[49:24] bad
[49:28] I didn't care about work anymore I
[49:29] didn't care about my family anymore
[49:33] anything and so one night I decided to
[49:36] commit
[49:40] suicide you know I I overdosed that
[49:47] night and I thought my life was going to
[49:50] end
[49:53] there but God had a different plan
[49:58] you know I just remember waking
[50:01] up and I've said this before I just
[50:03] remember hearing a
[50:08] voice telling me that it wasn't my time
[50:13] yet and you know in my mind not knowing
[50:15] anything about the supernatural or
[50:23] anything it somehow just clicked in my
[50:25] mind that that was a higher power that
[50:29] SP and from that day forward I mean two
[50:32] years and 7even months
[50:36] later I've been here at Cedar
[50:39] Hills Hills and continuing my walk with
[50:42] the
[50:46] Lord you know and I'm very grateful for
[50:48] all the things the Lord has done with
[50:52] me and even allowing me to experience
[50:56] this kind of
[51:01] trip and you know this this trip really
[51:04] impacted me a
[51:11] lot not only because it was my first
[51:13] time out of the
[51:17] states but because of what we did
[51:22] there you know as I was talking to some
[51:24] of the youth
[51:30] you know some of them went through some
[51:31] of the things that I went through as a
[51:37] child you know we were talking about it
[51:39] and we don't know what any of you youth
[51:40] are going through or the youth over
[51:42] there in
[51:46] Mexico so it really is nice just to see
[51:49] what the Lord can do for someone like
[51:54] me take take me from a sinner in the
[51:58] world and changing me to a child
[52:06] God and so I wanted to bring that back
[52:08] here to you
[52:12] you that we may not know what
[52:14] circumstances you're going
[52:18] through but just see my life take
[52:24] that
[52:26] and if you can see what God can do for
[52:29] me how much more can he do for
[52:32] you you know I always say it all the
[52:35] time you youth have such an
[52:39] opportunity the ministers the
[52:44] pastor all the help that you have
[52:48] here to help you in your
[52:53] walk and so with that it takes me to my
[52:55] second
[52:58] scripture in Matthew
[53:03] 6
[53:09] 31-34 and it reads like
[53:12] this therefore take no thought saying
[53:16] what shall we eat or what shall we drink
[53:19] or wherewith thou shall we be
[53:24] clothed
[53:32] for after all these things do the
[53:34] Gentiles seek for your heavenly father
[53:36] knoweth that you have need of all these
[53:48] things but seek ye first the kingdom of
[53:51] God and his righteousness and all these
[53:55] things shall be added onto
[54:05] you you know I really like that
[54:10] scripture especially For You
[54:14] Youth because I know there's a lot of
[54:16] Temptation in the world to be
[54:23] famous to see your friends in the world
[54:26] have all the things that they
[54:30] have for them thinking that they're cool
[54:32] for drinking and all
[54:37] that and just for you guys to realize
[54:40] that you don't need
[54:45] that you know me as a Living
[54:49] Testament that the world can offer you
[54:54] nothing that the Lord can give
[54:57] you you know I still struggle to this
[55:00] day with certain
[55:03] things you know my so-called friends
[55:06] that I
[55:11] had I haven't heard from them in three
[55:16] years sometimes my family has a hard
[55:19] time seeing what I'm
[55:24] doing
[55:25] but I tell them they just don't
[55:26] understand what the Lord has done for
[55:29] me you know I may have lost friends
[55:32] family and other things in the
[55:37] world but the Lord knew that was going
[55:39] to
[55:41] happen and he gave me a new
[55:46] family
[55:47] so in closing I just want to let you
[55:50] youth
[55:52] know just remember where you're part
[55:55] priorities
[55:58] are that if you just seek the kingdom of
[56:00] God
[56:05] first that he will give you all your
[56:08] needs
[56:10] provided thank you guys God
[56:14] [Applause]
[56:23] bless
[56:29] God bless

[57:14] and I will cover thee with my hand while
[57:16] I pass
[57:23] by man bless you may be
[57:29] seated thank our pastor for the
[57:31] opportunity to be able to to speak
[57:36] here and for I want to thank you for
[57:38] sending me to
[57:41] Mexico been I've been to Mexico several
[57:43] times over the last several
[57:48] years you know but for me I don't know
[57:50] what it was about this trip it it was
[57:52] different for
[57:53] me
[57:56] kind of almost feel like I it awoken
[57:58] something inside of
[58:00] me I was in Sal in
[58:04] July and it was a great
[58:08] trip but this trip was
[58:11] short but
[58:14] long and it it did something for
[58:17] me and know and I you know can't wait to
[58:21] go on the next
[58:23] one
[58:25] amen and uh as we heard from the the
[58:28] testimonies from Brother
[58:31] John guys tore it
[58:37] up yeah brother Enzo and brother Seth
[58:39] they did an awesome
[58:43] job I hadn't interpreted in a while and
[58:46] they tore me
[58:50] up brother Lorenzo he preached in
[58:52] Spanish and it was
[58:53] awesome
[58:56] told him he's got to do that
[58:59] again amen and
[59:02] uh so that was that's my short testimony
[59:05] for Mexico
[59:08] okay I so so normally we preach what we
[59:12] preached over there
[59:14] right but I can't do that this
[59:17] time especially not after the message on
[59:19] Wednesday
[59:22] Sunday Pastor thank you for that that
[59:24] was
[59:26] awesome and I'm not just saying that
[59:28] just to butter him
[59:29] [Applause]
[59:32] up that's those are awesome and I I I
[59:35] feel that that's part of the reason why
[59:37] this Mexico trip was such an impact for
[59:41] me that first message on what think you
[59:44] of Christ that that one really it hit me
[59:50] deep we hear that statement oh it hit
[59:53] different
[59:56] right we we've used that statement
[59:57] before right it hit
[59:59] different and that first one that hit
[1:00:01] different was for
[1:00:03] me you know and and we heard on Sunday
[1:00:06] that that whenever we read the scripture
[1:00:09] we must see Christ in every scripture
[1:00:14] right
[1:00:16] right do a little visual
[1:00:21] here with me
[1:00:23] brother
[1:00:26] we've seen this
[1:00:28] before but I'm I'm G to do it
[1:00:31] again this couple Waters would you call
[1:00:34] it
[1:00:41] full a cup of water
[1:00:45] full according to our founding Pastor he
[1:00:47] says
[1:00:49] no I'm G to make a little bit of mess
[1:00:51] here
[1:00:53] okay luckily it's
[1:00:55] water he said now when you read the
[1:00:57] message this is the definition of
[1:01:03] fool that's full David said my cup run
[1:01:12] over and all that God
[1:01:16] was he didn't pour into
[1:01:21] Christ because then that leaves God
[1:01:23] powerless
[1:01:25] all that God
[1:01:27] was he
[1:01:31] kosis he pours into
[1:01:34] Christ all that Christ
[1:01:37] was this is
[1:01:39] you he pours into the
[1:01:45] [Applause]
[1:01:51] church everything he pours
[1:01:55] what is he
[1:01:56] doing he is transferring
[1:02:00] himself it used to be that was God above
[1:02:04] us then it was God With
[1:02:06] Us now it's God in
[1:02:09] us amen amen God moved from his throne
[1:02:13] in
[1:02:14] glory to his
[1:02:16] son to the temple
[1:02:20] temp amen amen now now here here's the
[1:02:24] thing that gets me
[1:02:26] here now if we see Christ in every
[1:02:30] scripture and we must see Christ in
[1:02:33] every
[1:02:34] scripture he is the principal theme
[1:02:36] throughout the whole entire
[1:02:39] thing but if but if Christ is in
[1:02:43] you and if Christ is in
[1:02:48] me and we are in
[1:02:51] Christ then I must see myself in every
[1:02:54] scripture
[1:02:57] also you following
[1:03:00] me now now we can't read the
[1:03:04] Bible we can't read the message of the
[1:03:08] hour just like a history
[1:03:11] book just like a book of good
[1:03:14] morals now there's a lot of there
[1:03:17] there's a lot of uh people that say the
[1:03:19] the Bible it's it's good
[1:03:23] morals
[1:03:25] although there is history Within These
[1:03:28] Pages although you will learn good
[1:03:32] morals but if that is all you take from
[1:03:35] the
[1:03:37] word you have missed the message that it
[1:03:39] is trying to pay to
[1:03:43] you now now when I was going to barber
[1:03:49] school I I moved here to crues for two
[1:03:52] three
[1:03:53] months
[1:03:54] kind of sort
[1:03:55] of now when when I was here you there
[1:03:58] was no such thing as
[1:04:01] texting texting doesn't quite exist
[1:04:05] yet so so what I would
[1:04:07] do I would write to my
[1:04:12] girlfriend she's my wife now Sister
[1:04:15] Grace now when I would write these
[1:04:17] letters to
[1:04:19] her the content that was in the
[1:04:23] letter
[1:04:25] was between me and between her it was
[1:04:29] between two
[1:04:31] people now there might have been other
[1:04:33] people that read those
[1:04:35] letters there might have been friends
[1:04:37] that read the
[1:04:38] letters now there might have been family
[1:04:40] members that read the
[1:04:42] letters but the contents that was in
[1:04:45] those
[1:04:46] letters was between me and between
[1:04:51] her now this evening on a Wednesday
[1:04:54] Wednesday is very common for Christian
[1:04:56] churches to have
[1:05:00] church and they're all reading
[1:05:02] this right now at this very moment there
[1:05:05] are there are congregations and there
[1:05:06] are churches that are reading the same
[1:05:08] book that we
[1:05:11] are but although there are many that
[1:05:14] read the
[1:05:14] [Applause]
[1:05:16] letter although there are other people
[1:05:18] that read
[1:05:19] it the contents of this
[1:05:23] letter directed to one other
[1:05:28] person
[1:05:29] amen and that is to the bride of
[1:05:33] Christ again although there are others
[1:05:37] that read
[1:05:38] it this is only directed to one other
[1:05:43] person and this is a love
[1:05:47] letter it is a love letter between
[1:05:49] Christ and his
[1:05:51] church it is a love letter between
[1:05:54] between Christ and his
[1:05:56] bride now when we read this book now we
[1:06:01] have to get this book and we can't just
[1:06:03] skim over it and just read
[1:06:05] it again although there are others that
[1:06:08] read
[1:06:10] it there are things between the lines
[1:06:13] that only the person that it is
[1:06:15] addressed to will
[1:06:20] catch you following
[1:06:23] me
[1:06:25] now it doesn't only speak about
[1:06:27] him about Christ it also speaks about
[1:06:31] his
[1:06:33] beloved now now a few months ago I was
[1:06:37] listening to the church age uh
[1:06:42] series and and I've heard it before and
[1:06:46] I caught something that was in the in in
[1:06:48] between the lines this
[1:06:51] time now I I found out that that that
[1:06:54] before hee preaches the the church
[1:06:59] ages he preaches the revelation of Jesus
[1:07:04] Christ amen amen he is the principal
[1:07:07] theme of the entire
[1:07:10] gospel amen amen he is the
[1:07:15] groom now when I read when I heard these
[1:07:19] messages I began to hear how brother
[1:07:22] Brandon was talking about how there
[1:07:24] would be a people a
[1:07:29] bride and she was going to be from the
[1:07:32] first church
[1:07:34] age all the way to the last Church
[1:07:37] age it was speaking about a certain
[1:07:42] person amen amen now now it spoke of his
[1:07:47] deity no but I also I also read this and
[1:07:51] I'm going to read it to you here
[1:07:54] the one from the patmas vision
[1:07:57] gentlemen he says this
[1:08:00] morning this morning was more of a
[1:08:02] sermon
[1:08:04] type placing the foundation upon the
[1:08:07] deity of the
[1:08:10] revelation God being revealed in
[1:08:15] Christ how many believes
[1:08:17] it God was God was revealed in
[1:08:22] Christ Jehovah revealed in
[1:08:26] Christ now where is he got to be
[1:08:31] revealed that's a question that he asked
[1:08:34] there now where is God to be
[1:08:38] revealed in his
[1:08:40] church in his
[1:08:42] people in us he
[1:08:46] says he didn't say in
[1:08:48] me now he is inclusive in this one he
[1:08:52] said in US
[1:08:56] us now the a different
[1:09:01] Spirit different
[1:09:03] Works a different
[1:09:06] manifestation no sir The Same Spirit the
[1:09:11] same work the same manifestation the
[1:09:14] same love the same forgiveness the same
[1:09:17] long
[1:09:18] suffering gentleness
[1:09:21] patience peace
[1:09:24] Mery all that was
[1:09:28] in Christ is in the
[1:09:34] church I'm gonna say that one
[1:09:37] again all that was in
[1:09:41] Christ is in the
[1:09:45] church remember keep this in
[1:09:48] mind I just gave you the demonstration
[1:09:51] there he said it now want to tell
[1:09:55] you remember this keep this in
[1:09:59] mind all that God
[1:10:01] was he poured into
[1:10:04] Christ all that Christ was he poured
[1:10:08] into the
[1:10:09] church God above us God With Us God in
[1:10:14] us amen so we're going to leave that
[1:10:16] there for a
[1:10:18] minute now if you were to be so kind
[1:10:20] with me to turn to John chapter 13
[1:10:25] now when you read the
[1:10:27] scripture we are we are very privileged
[1:10:29] people because we had a prophet that
[1:10:31] would give us types and symbols he was a
[1:10:38] typologist for the last several months
[1:10:40] I've been working on on a on a list I
[1:10:42] got a big old list of types and symbols
[1:10:46] representations when I get done with
[1:10:48] that they will will will'll give it to
[1:10:50] everybody else give to
[1:10:52] everybody so when you when you when you
[1:10:55] come across
[1:10:57] John now we we all know this most of us
[1:11:00] know
[1:11:01] it now when you come across the name
[1:11:05] John John is a type or a representation
[1:11:08] of the bride of
[1:11:11] Christ okay amen now John 1323
[1:11:17] says now there was leaning on Jesus's
[1:11:20] bosom one of his disciples you know
[1:11:27] it says whom Jesus
[1:11:29] loved now we all know what leaning is
[1:11:33] right but I went to the dictionary to
[1:11:35] get a little bit better of an
[1:11:36] understanding of what this scripture was
[1:11:38] trying to tell
[1:11:40] me now the definition of
[1:11:45] Leaning it means to
[1:11:48] set to
[1:11:50] put to
[1:11:52] lay to play
[1:11:55] to rest oh we had a we heard a good one
[1:11:58] on on Sunday about rest
[1:12:03] amen so so the disciple that would lean
[1:12:06] on Jesus's bosom was
[1:12:10] John the the writer of the book we just
[1:12:13] we just uh we just
[1:12:15] read now brother Caleb's gonna be Jesus
[1:12:19] okay so what what so we can get a little
[1:12:22] bit of understanding of visual of what
[1:12:24] was going on
[1:12:27] here this is what John would
[1:12:30] do he would be on his
[1:12:34] bosom what is in the
[1:12:37] bosom behind the bosom is the
[1:12:40] heart where was the bride
[1:12:44] resting in the bosom of
[1:12:47] Jesus okay amen that's where she
[1:12:51] rested that's where Shew
[1:12:55] D she was in the bosom and he was
[1:12:58] whispering secrets to
[1:13:02] her listening to the
[1:13:05] heartbeat both hearts beating as
[1:13:10] one a
[1:13:11] pulsation beating beating it
[1:13:14] simultaneously at the same
[1:13:17] time as
[1:13:19] one because they were
[1:13:21] one okay I'm going to leave that one
[1:13:24] there I'm going to come back to that
[1:13:30] one
[1:13:32] started now let's go back to
[1:13:36] Exodus Exodus
[1:13:41] 33:22 this evening I'm not gonna not
[1:13:43] gonna take very long I have no idea what
[1:13:44] time I started at
[1:13:48] so and it shall come to pass while my
[1:13:50] glory passes by that I will put thee in
[1:13:53] the Cliff of The Rock and I will cover
[1:13:55] thee with my hand while I pass
[1:14:02] by now there's two different words CLI
[1:14:04] and
[1:14:07] CLI there they're synonymous they mean
[1:14:09] the same
[1:14:11] thing that's why I had asked brother OED
[1:14:13] if he would sing that song for
[1:14:17] Meck
[1:14:18] [Music]
[1:14:22] ofes let me
[1:14:24] hide myself in
[1:14:28] thee let the
[1:14:31] water and the
[1:14:34] blood and you know the rest it
[1:14:37] say now Cliff comes for the the the
[1:14:40] Hebrew word for
[1:14:43] Clift is Nar is now Nar means to bore
[1:14:49] out pick
[1:14:50] out dig out put out Thrust
[1:14:56] out
[1:14:58] Pierce and Clift in English
[1:15:03] means a split in
[1:15:06] something an
[1:15:08] indention a
[1:15:10] divide a slash
[1:15:13] wound a vshape
[1:15:16] indention okay who was the rock we all
[1:15:19] know who the rock was
[1:15:21] right this rock ises
[1:15:24] Jesus yes he's the
[1:15:27] one and that rock was bruised for
[1:15:31] you or that rock was clefted for
[1:15:36] you and being
[1:15:39] clefted something came
[1:15:44] out something came
[1:15:46] out now the question is
[1:15:51] what what happened to that piece that
[1:15:53] came
[1:15:56] out it's an
[1:15:58] indention it's a slash it's an
[1:16:01] indention following me so
[1:16:04] far now to find out we need to now to
[1:16:07] find out what happened there we need to
[1:16:08] go to the Old
[1:16:12] Testament and we got to go to the first
[1:16:15] Adam now the first Adam we saw God saw
[1:16:19] him that he was
[1:16:21] alone we've all heard this
[1:16:24] before and God said it's not good for a
[1:16:26] man to be
[1:16:28] alone I'm going to make him a help
[1:16:32] me so the Lord causes a deep sleep to to
[1:16:35] come upon
[1:16:38] Adam and he opens the
[1:16:42] side and takes a rib
[1:16:45] out and from that
[1:16:48] rib he forms a
[1:16:50] woman and she was bone of his bone
[1:16:53] of his
[1:16:55] flesh
[1:16:57] Amen brother L it was splitting the
[1:17:03] atom brother L preach that message on
[1:17:05] that several years
[1:17:08] back
[1:17:16] the it's not the same in Spanish that in
[1:17:19] English now now so that so that's what
[1:17:21] happened to the first
[1:17:25] and being that is it's a type in a
[1:17:27] shadow of of of
[1:17:30] Christ so now then the antitype has to
[1:17:35] come all the characters all the
[1:17:39] situations that happened in the
[1:17:41] Bible all of it was pointing to
[1:17:44] Christ amen he was the
[1:17:49] antitype so now so now we we're going to
[1:17:51] have to fast forward through all of
[1:17:52] Jesus
[1:17:54] life and we're going to take him to when
[1:17:56] he's on the
[1:17:58] cross now it it used to
[1:18:01] be it was a a Roman custom it was it was
[1:18:04] a
[1:18:06] law you know there was uh they used to
[1:18:09] break the legs of those who were
[1:18:11] crucified to make sure that they were
[1:18:15] dead so I can see these two Roman
[1:18:17] soldiers that are walking to check to
[1:18:19] see if the three were were
[1:18:21] dead
[1:18:25] I can see one with a
[1:18:28] club a
[1:18:30] club like a
[1:18:34] bat he he comes to the first malactor
[1:18:38] gets it
[1:18:42] and and all of a sudden
[1:18:46] ah Agony in
[1:18:49] pain oh the first malactor he wasn't
[1:18:51] dead he was he was already going through
[1:18:56] hell now he had to go through more hell
[1:19:01] pain and I can see and I can see these
[1:19:03] two Roman soldiers as as they're
[1:19:07] walking now one of them had a
[1:19:10] spear and as they were
[1:19:12] walking I can see him maybe looking at
[1:19:14] that there the cross there in the
[1:19:17] middle and maybe thinking to
[1:19:20] himself that's strange
[1:19:23] those little birds look like they're
[1:19:25] trying to pull the nails
[1:19:28] out oh he was
[1:19:31] astonished wow look at their chest
[1:19:33] they're covered in
[1:19:36] blood stood out to him left an
[1:19:38] impression
[1:19:39] in and here they come to the second
[1:19:43] malactor
[1:19:44] gets the club and
[1:19:47] boom
[1:19:49] silence he was dead but yet he was imp
[1:19:54] Paradise here they come here he comes
[1:19:57] for the third
[1:19:59] one right when he's about
[1:20:01] to the Cog wheels of Prophecy are
[1:20:06] turning oh you you thought it was just
[1:20:08] religious people that were the cgws of
[1:20:10] Prophecy
[1:20:13] huh oh that scripture might be
[1:20:17] fulfilled that not one bone in his body
[1:20:19] would be
[1:20:21] broken and he says look at the
[1:20:24] birds he's dead can't you see he's dead
[1:20:28] look at
[1:20:29] him look he gets the
[1:20:32] spear and he punctures his
[1:20:36] side and what happens and we all we all
[1:20:39] know this we know it by
[1:20:41] heart water and blood came out
[1:20:45] amen that was the last Adam
[1:20:48] there this was the antitype of the first
[1:20:51] Adam
[1:20:53] the bride coming out out of his side
[1:20:55] just like the first
[1:20:58] Adam what was it it was the
[1:21:02] release it was the
[1:21:05] birth of the
[1:21:07] Bride she came
[1:21:09] forth water blood and
[1:21:13] spirit water to to cleanse
[1:21:15] her blood to protect
[1:21:18] her and spirit to give her his life
[1:21:23] amen give her life for
[1:21:27] what because she is going to she was
[1:21:30] going to be where he was going to speak

[1:21:35] now she would speak as the Oracles of
[1:21:39] God Amy man are you following me so far
[1:21:42] now let's go back to the brother
[1:21:44] brandham
[1:21:45] here it is a rising of the
[1:21:50] Sun and as he being the groom
[1:21:54] I like this one here the bride has to
[1:21:57] come
[1:21:59] forth because it's part of him and it
[1:22:02] can only oh look at this one
[1:22:05] here and it can only be the
[1:22:08] manifestation of the fulfilling of all
[1:22:11] the revelations any other has spoken of
[1:22:15] the
[1:22:21] Bride can only
[1:22:24] manifest that's the only thing she's got
[1:22:26] to do is
[1:22:29] Manifest if it does something different
[1:22:31] from the groom it's not the
[1:22:36] bride if it does something
[1:22:39] different from the groom it's not the
[1:22:44] bride because she is flesh of his flesh
[1:22:47] bone of his bone life of his life power
[1:22:51] of his power he is
[1:22:54] him as a man and a woman are
[1:22:58] one and a woman taken from his
[1:23:01] side she taken a spirit the feminine
[1:23:06] Spirit of

[1:23:50] him to do the same things he

[1:23:58] cylinders if he hit on 16
[1:24:01] cylinders will no

[1:24:27] that I wish I had a voice to be able to
[1:24:30] put it forth the way he
[1:24:33] did but Jesus is going to have a
[1:24:38] Voice come on

[1:25:31] ju the son of
[1:25:35] Thunder oh we're looking for something
[1:25:39] else we're looking for God or Jesus to
[1:25:42] speak from somewhere
[1:25:44] else we're looking for him to Thunder
[1:25:46] from somewhere
[1:25:49] else no no to his people to his
[1:25:54] bride she was given the name th of
[1:26:01] Thunder
[1:26:03] amen
[1:26:05] zeed means my
[1:26:08] gift the real word of that
[1:26:13] is means to be endowed
[1:26:19] endowment Terry in Jerusalem
[1:26:23] ended with power from on
[1:26:28] high so we saw
[1:26:30] Jesus we saw we we saw the bride leaning
[1:26:33] on his
[1:26:36] bosom we saw how she came
[1:26:39] out that was the Fulfillment of
[1:26:42] Daniel Daniel 2:45 when it says for as
[1:26:46] much as thou sawest the
[1:26:51] stone
[1:26:52] was cut out of the
[1:26:55] mountain without
[1:27:00] hand what was it that was birthed out of
[1:27:03] Jesus what was it that was heun
[1:27:09] out something came
[1:27:11] out amen amen Daniel said he saw Behold
[1:27:16] a stone was come out of the
[1:27:20] mountain I only know one
[1:27:24] mountain I only know
[1:27:27] one that's my Lord Jesus
[1:27:29] Christ oh how she was taken out of
[1:27:33] him how he was
[1:27:35] parted how he was slashed how he was
[1:27:39] pierced and all of a sudden The Birth
[1:27:41] come
[1:27:51] outu
[1:27:54] the very next day brother brandham
[1:28:00] says standing
[1:28:02] there a whirlwind came
[1:28:06] down and blasted the mountains
[1:28:10] out rocks cut the top of the trees
[1:28:14] off about three or four feet above my
[1:28:18] head made three
[1:28:20] blasts boom boom boom boom boom boom and
[1:28:25] the brothers come
[1:28:27] running there was about 15 men standing
[1:28:31] there preachers and
[1:28:33] everything what was it he said what was
[1:28:36] it I said judgment is striking the West
[1:28:41] Coast about two days after
[1:28:44] that the earthquake almost sunk
[1:28:49] Alaska what is this light up on Sunset
[1:28:52] mountain in the Coronado
[1:28:57] Forest everything he says has a
[1:29:01] meaning everything he says has a
[1:29:05] meaning don't take it
[1:29:07] lightly read in between the
[1:29:10] lines now if the stone was cut out of
[1:29:13] the
[1:29:15] mountain now and if Jesus is the Great
[1:29:20] Pyramid then was cut
[1:29:23] out had to be the exact same
[1:29:28] substance if it a circle was cut
[1:29:32] out then it's doing something different
[1:29:34] than what the groom
[1:29:37] was if he was a
[1:29:39] pyramid a
[1:29:41] mountain then what was cut out was also
[1:29:43] a
[1:29:47] pyramid that's where I've talked about
[1:29:49] this several
[1:29:50] times
[1:29:52] that's why we must reach that stature
[1:29:54] brother
[1:29:56] Elijah that's why I must reach that I
[1:30:00] reach that I have to reach
[1:30:01] that I'm not going to just say you I
[1:30:04] have to reach
[1:30:06] that amen and what is in the shape
[1:30:11] of we know that
[1:30:16] right on Sunset mountain in the Coronado
[1:30:19] Forest of
[1:30:20] Arizona
[1:30:23] what is that strange thing that happened
[1:30:25] up
[1:30:26] there that people has been driving east
[1:30:30] from
[1:30:32] West put that picture up there
[1:30:37] Brothers before we went to
[1:30:40] Tucson I had been studying on this
[1:30:45] right
[1:30:47] watch brother Daniel Evans has these in
[1:30:49] his church Danel Evans
[1:30:53] that people are has been driving east
[1:30:56] from West picking up the rocks that laid
[1:30:59] around there where it
[1:31:04] struck and every one of them every one
[1:31:07] rock has three corners on
[1:31:12] it that it tore
[1:31:16] off the three are one they're laying on
[1:31:20] desk on paper on paper
[1:31:23] we Across the
[1:31:25] Nation what is this strange thing upon
[1:31:29] sunset
[1:31:31] Mountain in the Coronado
[1:31:35] Forest what is that
[1:31:39] strange what is that strange
[1:31:42] thing brother
[1:31:44] Caleb now you preach now the bride is
[1:31:47] going to pour
[1:31:50] back
[1:31:53] remember that remember that on
[1:31:55] Sunday all that God was he poured he
[1:31:58] poured he
[1:32:01] poured now she's got to pour
[1:32:06] back
[1:32:09] why because
[1:32:12] eternity was a perfect
[1:32:15] circle right eternity was a perfect
[1:32:20] circle that's why we all
[1:32:22] married couples must wear a
[1:32:26] ring it was A Perfect
[1:32:29] Circle S said in and then what
[1:32:33] happened a
[1:32:35] hickey what is a hickey of b-shaped
[1:32:42] indention now what must happen to
[1:32:45] Eternity how is it that the bride's
[1:32:47] going to pour
[1:32:50] back we heard on Sunday where where Paul
[1:32:52] says to fulfill the
[1:32:56] word I like that
[1:32:59] one to complete the
[1:33:02] word to make eternity whole
[1:33:05] again and the only way that it can be
[1:33:08] the hi can be popped
[1:33:10] up the only way is if that stone that
[1:33:14] was cut out of the
[1:33:16] mountain has got to come back to its
[1:33:19] place and then the word is
[1:33:24] [Applause]
[1:33:28] complete so will the church have to be a
[1:33:31] matched to everything God has
[1:33:37] promised it must be the piece that's
[1:33:40] mitt
[1:33:44] off so if the original is the
[1:33:48] word so will the subject that's been
[1:33:50] taken off from the
[1:33:54] word be taken from it to be the
[1:33:57] word to what to
[1:34:02] match to push out that
[1:34:06] picky to make it
[1:34:09] complete to make
[1:34:17] itlu the
[1:34:20] flag
[1:34:25] you know what I see
[1:34:26] here I don't just see the six-pointed
[1:34:29] Star of
[1:34:32] David I don't just see the flag of
[1:34:38] Israel I
[1:34:40] see the bride being plucked
[1:34:46] out poured
[1:34:48] out she came out and I see it coming
[1:34:53] back
[1:34:55] in fulfilling it
[1:34:58] perfect she is that perfect
[1:35:01] word she is pushing that she is pushing
[1:35:05] that hickey
[1:35:07] out filling
[1:35:09] it is the immortal god with the immortal
[1:35:15] bright the same
[1:35:18] substance
[1:35:20] look I'm going to finish with
[1:35:23] this
[1:35:24] look Christ in you makes him the center
[1:35:28] of life of the
[1:35:32] Revelation
[1:35:34] see it's Christ life it Christ life in
[1:35:39] you makes
[1:35:41] him the center of the
[1:35:44] Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the
[1:35:47] Bible the complete revelation of
[1:35:50] Christ
[1:35:53] Christ in
[1:35:55] you Christ in
[1:35:57] you Christ in
[1:36:00] you makes
[1:36:02] you the complete
[1:36:05] Revelation the whole entire
[1:36:10] thing you see what God's trying to
[1:36:14] do don't look at the world and say oh
[1:36:16] it's bad out
[1:36:19] there don't look at as bad out
[1:36:22] there I understand our founding Pastor

[1:36:34] saying it's getting good out there it's
[1:36:36] getting good out there
[1:36:39] there why our Redemption is that much
[1:36:44] closer to complete eternity to push out
[1:36:47] that
[1:36:49] hickey complete the word

[1:49:06] way but before we leave I pray that you
[1:49:10] or ask that you would pray for us as we
[1:49:11] go to as we leave on our trip
[1:49:17] tomorrow but I want I wanted to to just
[1:49:20] go over something with you
[1:49:24] all uh we are living in perilous
[1:49:29] times and uh you know sometimes I don't
[1:49:32] I don't think we we understand how
[1:49:34] perilous the times
[1:49:40] are amen we we we know a god of of long
[1:49:46] suffering we know a god of mercy and a
[1:49:49] god of
[1:49:52] Grace but we don't want to know a god of
[1:49:58] judgment we don't want to know what it's
[1:50:00] like when there is no mer Mercy
[1:50:04] anymore when Grace has finished we don't
[1:50:07] want to we don't want to be
[1:50:09] here and you know sometimes we got to be
[1:50:14] reminded but I think just you you you
[1:50:17] turn on the news and and and you see
[1:50:19] what's going on in the Middle
[1:50:23] East my goodness it is it's quite a
[1:50:26] thing unfolding before
[1:50:31] us but I I want to to uh just to to make
[1:50:35] this couple of comments and and maybe
[1:50:38] we'll get into it when we when we
[1:50:43] return but I want you to to remember
[1:50:46] this and think about this while I'm
[1:50:48] while we're gone
[1:50:54] everyone knows
[1:50:56] that that the first son of Abraham was
[1:50:59] Ishmael
[1:51:03] right ishma of course was the son of the
[1:51:06] bonds
[1:51:08] woman and Isaac we know was the son of
[1:51:12] the free
[1:51:16] woman and in the message hearing
[1:51:18] recognizing and acting on the word of
[1:51:22] God he said whenever there is a Revival
[1:51:25] it always produces
[1:51:29] twins he said that's a rude
[1:51:34] remark
[1:51:36] true when there was a
[1:51:40] birth out came Isaac or from Isaac and
[1:51:45] Rebeca produced
[1:51:47] twins when the world was created to
[1:51:50] produced
[1:51:51] twins produced two
[1:51:54] trees Cain and Abel were born and
[1:51:56] produced that those were
[1:51:58] Twins and then brother Bram says this
[1:52:01] and and of course it kind of startles or
[1:52:03] or or makes you stop for a
[1:52:08] moment he when Ishmael and Isaac was was
[1:52:13] born and he says it produced
[1:52:17] two now we stop for a moment there
[1:52:20] because when you look at
[1:52:23] that in the in the
[1:52:26] natural we always say twins it was one
[1:52:29] mother and two children
[1:52:33] right and and uh and and so but but when
[1:52:36] you when you really see what the word
[1:52:39] twin
[1:52:41] means it means something
[1:52:44] containing or consisting of two matching
[1:52:48] or corresponding parts part
[1:52:52] s so one son of the natural and one of
[1:52:56] the
[1:52:59] spiritual why am I saying
[1:53:01] this because we know that through Isaac
[1:53:04] came
[1:53:06] Christ and through Christ came
[1:53:10] us that's the
[1:53:13] connection now now this you talk about
[1:53:16] prophecy being fulfilled open your
[1:53:18] eyes
[1:53:20] turn the television
[1:53:21] off what's going on put your phones and
[1:53:25] your things to one side
[1:53:27] and you you've got to be a spiritual
[1:53:31] church you got to be to you got to be
[1:53:34] spiritual to to to know the
[1:53:39] prophecy if you're not in in tune with
[1:53:43] this I'm going to tell you you're going
[1:53:45] to miss
[1:53:47] it everybody understand this is so
[1:53:51] important this is of utmost important
[1:53:54] right now
[1:53:56] importance talk about when somebody says
[1:53:59] oh brother brandham is not a
[1:54:02] prophet he missed it here and here don't
[1:54:05] tell me
[1:54:06] that it was the prophet of God that was
[1:54:08] sent to us
[1:54:12] Gentiles and to me I I want to read this
[1:54:15] this
[1:54:17] quote and if you ever seen a a a quote
[1:54:20] that that that is unfolding and and it
[1:54:22] is being unfolded
[1:54:26] today
[1:54:28] 1957 we would see
[1:54:31] Jesus Remember ishma and Isaac
[1:54:35] okay the he starts off the great ships
[1:54:39] are out in the
[1:54:41] Seas you can say brother brandom is seen
[1:54:44] some seen what was going on in the news
[1:54:48] 1957
[1:54:50] and that's
[1:54:51] true but a prophet is also seeing the
[1:54:57] future we know that right we know that
[1:55:00] in our minds but we many times we don't
[1:55:02] we don't put it
[1:55:04] together he's seen the very events that
[1:55:07] are happening right
[1:55:10] now understand that a prophet can look
[1:55:12] forward he can look
[1:55:15] back the great ships that are out in the
[1:55:18] seas
[1:55:22] what SE look at the Mediterranean
[1:55:25] Sea right this is the natural and
[1:55:28] there's a
[1:55:30] spiritual with their missiles headed
[1:55:32] towards each
[1:55:35] other just striking for that or waiting
[1:55:39] for that strike
[1:55:41] off the Jews are congregating Yonder in
[1:55:45] is in
[1:55:47] Israel ishma and and Isaac is at one
[1:55:51] another's
[1:55:54] throat everything the scripture said to
[1:55:57] be fulfilled is now at
[1:56:03] hand the gospel has been
[1:56:07] preached oh yes Christ is
[1:56:12] Vindicated the Gentile days is
[1:56:18] finished
[1:56:20] what a word right there when this scene
[1:56:23] begins to
[1:56:25] happen the Gentile days is
[1:56:28] finished my question is how close are we
[1:56:32] really because once he turns to the Jews
[1:56:38] completely the dispensation of the
[1:56:40] Gentiles is
[1:56:42] done there is not one more Gentile that
[1:56:45] can be
[1:56:47] saved there's no more Mercy
[1:56:50] there's no more grace for the
[1:56:51] Gentiles Grace has now turned to the
[1:56:55] Jews now this is once again ishma and
[1:56:59] Isaac at each other's
[1:57:02] throat been like that since they were
[1:57:05] born but you couldn't script this if you
[1:57:08] wanted
[1:57:11] to do you know who the president of
[1:57:14] Israel
[1:57:17] is anybody know
[1:57:24] no Netanyahu is is the prime
[1:57:30] minister the the
[1:57:32] president of Israel is Isaac Herzog
[1:57:38] Isaac okay ishma and Isaac at each
[1:57:40] other's throat
[1:57:44] is the president once again of Israel is
[1:57:48] Isaac
[1:57:49] that's
[1:57:50] right the leader of Hamas Hamas in the
[1:57:54] Gaza
[1:57:56] stripaz from 2006 to
[1:58:00] 2017 and now he is a senior political
[1:58:06] leader of the Palestinian group
[1:58:09] Hamas ham his his name is
[1:58:16] ishel Isaac and ishma at each other's
[1:58:22] throats the prime minister's name
[1:58:25] is prime
[1:58:28] minister
[1:58:29] Netanyahu but what's his first
[1:58:32] name
[1:58:34] Benjamin ah let's see where we're at
[1:58:38] today Joseph is
[1:58:42] coming come on Church Joseph is
[1:58:45] coming he's getting ready to reveal
[1:58:48] himself
[1:58:51] to his
[1:58:53] brothers it's ready Benjamin's in
[1:58:57] place Isaac and ish's in in their
[1:59:03] place watch what brother bam
[1:59:06] says they had a little Benjamin down
[1:59:09] there his little
[1:59:12] brother you know who Benjamin
[1:59:16] represents this new bunch of real
[1:59:20] genuine
[1:59:23] Jews that's Gathering there
[1:59:26] now to make that
[1:59:32] 144,000 this race that's coming
[1:59:36] up not these Wall Street
[1:59:40] Crooks W Street no that's more Cannon
[1:59:47] F them ain't Jews
[1:59:50] the real
[1:59:53] Jews are these little Benjamins coming
[1:59:58] up from down here who have never heard
[2:00:01] the word of Jesus
[2:00:04] Christ now if if we can't see this whole
[2:00:07] thing
[2:00:08] unfolding nothing is by
[2:00:11] coincidence and yet we're
[2:00:14] so we're so into the things of the
[2:00:17] world EarthBound
[2:00:22] it's gonna pass Us
[2:00:25] by I say this church so you can shake
[2:00:29] yourself snap out of it where you're
[2:00:32] at we're like caught in the glare of
[2:00:34] that of that
[2:00:37] serpent wherever he turns us we
[2:00:41] turn we're like zombies at
[2:00:44] times snap out of it wake up Church wake
[2:00:49] up where are
[2:00:52] we on October
[2:00:58] 23rd of this year the leading Italian
[2:01:04] parliament said put out a
[2:01:08] statement this from Italy
[2:01:10] okay he said this and he's quoting Ezra
[2:01:13] the 5th
[2:01:16] chapter take these vessels
[2:01:20] and go carry them into the temple that
[2:01:22] is in
[2:01:24] Jerusalem and let the house of God be
[2:01:27] built in its
[2:01:30] place and then he says we have in
[2:01:34] Rome the
[2:01:36] implements which are the tools and the
[2:01:40] utensils of the Jewish
[2:01:43] temple that was
[2:01:46] destroyed 2,000 years ago W and all
[2:01:52] along the Catholic Church been
[2:01:55] saying no we don't have any of them we
[2:01:58] don't have no vessels we don't have none
[2:02:00] of that but now it's coming to
[2:02:05] pass that when
[2:02:07] Rome remember the destruction of the
[2:02:10] temple they took many of the of the
[2:02:14] utensils and the bowls and all these
[2:02:16] things that was in the
[2:02:17] temple
[2:02:19] Rome took them and now they're
[2:02:22] confessing that they have
[2:02:24] them but that it's time to return
[2:02:27] them now now you all read the
[2:02:30] scriptures watch what happened in the
[2:02:32] time of
[2:02:34] Daniel right remember the writing on the
[2:02:38] wall were they doing all that they were
[2:02:41] having
[2:02:42] parties using the cups the
[2:02:46] chales having a good time
[2:02:50] Abomination but it's now time for all
[2:02:52] these vessels to return
[2:02:56] back we have
[2:02:59] them we took them 2,000 years
[2:03:02] ago and the Vatican is now
[2:03:07] admitting what they have denied for over
[2:03:09] a hundred
[2:03:11] years they said with these
[2:03:14] vessels you all brought light into the
[2:03:17] whole world
[2:03:19] they are with
[2:03:21] us and by keeping
[2:03:24] them perhaps we're preventing
[2:03:29] you from fulfilling your
[2:03:34] destiny the week before that one of the
[2:03:37] leading rabbis in Israel
[2:03:41] said this war will lead to the Third
[2:03:47] Temple and that third go goal this is
[2:03:49] their goal now whether it happens or not
