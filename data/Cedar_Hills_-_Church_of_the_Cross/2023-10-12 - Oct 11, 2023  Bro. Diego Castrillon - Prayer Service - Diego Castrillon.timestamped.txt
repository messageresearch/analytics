[31:29] I would ask you to
[31:31] stand I want to help your faith a little
[31:35] bit before we start
[31:38] praying and for that I want to use the
[31:46] scriptures let us open the Bible in the
[31:48] book of Acts chapter
[31:52] 12 I want you to notice how this Story
[31:56] begins
[32:03] I believe that it looks like what is
[32:04] happening
[32:06] today the scripture reads like
[32:11] this act chapter 12 vers
[32:23] 1-5 now about that time the time of
[32:26] Herod
[32:27] The
[32:32] King The King stretched forth his hand
[32:34] to give them a comfortable time it
[32:37] doesn't say like
[32:40] that to take them
[32:44] camping the Bible is
[32:47] clear to
[32:52] Vex that was the time that her brothers
[32:55] the apostles were living in
[33:01] and he killed James the brother of John
[33:03] with the
[33:05] [Applause]
[33:12] sword and because he saw it please the
[33:15] Jews he proceeded further to take Peter
[33:17] also than were the days of the
[33:19] unleavened
[33:25] bread
[33:35] when we when he had apprehended him he
[33:37] put him in prison and delivered him to
[33:39] four cenans of soldiers to keep him
[33:42] intending after Easter to bring him
[33:44] forth to the
[33:47] people now watch this service that that
[33:50] the next the the next
[33:55] verse Peter was therefore kept in
[33:59] prison listen the next part
[34:03] but
[34:10] but prayer was made without seasoning of
[34:13] the church unto God for
[34:16] him I'm gonna read it
[34:24] again but prayer was made without
[34:26] pleasing of the church unto God for him
[34:30] let us
[34:31] pray Lord very good
[34:34] evening we prepare ourselves for this
[34:37] prayer
[34:38] service Inspire us with the
[34:42] scriptures to recognize what you have
[34:45] given
[34:45] us to face the
[34:50] enemy so be it to be be the to you be
[34:54] the glory in the name of the Lord Jesus
[34:55] Christ
[34:58] please be seated give me eight
[35:01] minutes I want you to see the the
[35:05] situation the the the the the situation
[35:07] of this
[35:09] time Jacob had been
[35:12] killed Herod had killed
[35:15] him Al together with other
[35:19] Christians in that time the Pol
[35:21] political power and the religious power
[35:24] had gotten together
[35:29] to bring a persecution against the
[35:31] Primitive
[35:32] church now if that seems like a a small
[35:39] thing the Bible says that Peter was he
[35:42] was taken by
[35:48] Herod I don't need to be a prophet to
[35:51] know what was going to happen to
[35:52] Peter what his destination was what was
[35:56] going to happen happened to him that was
[35:58] the
[36:00] picture
[36:02] but the scriptures
[36:04] say that the
[36:08] church would
[36:11] pray until they would fall
[36:14] asleep
[36:17] no they would make prayer until they got
[36:21] hungry they would make prayer without
[36:24] ceasing for Peter
[36:27] before
[36:30] God maybe you don't understand these
[36:35] scriptures but if we go to Luke chapter
[36:39] 18
[36:41] Jesus he gives us the
[36:43] key he gives us the
[36:46] tools to
[36:48] understand what we have to do in this
[36:51] hour in this time in this
[36:55] moment
[36:59] Luke chapter
[37:02] 18 the parable of the Widow and the
[37:05] unrighteous
[37:08] judge and he speak a parable
[37:17] saying he speak a parable unto them to
[37:20] this end that man not always to pray and
[37:22] not to
[37:23] faint to to pray always
[37:28] at all
[37:29] time what does it mean brother
[37:33] dieo we have to pray when things are
[37:35] going
[37:37] good we have to pray when we're going to
[37:39] lay
[37:40] down we have to pray when we're going to
[37:43] get we have to pray at
[37:46] work we have to pray when things are
[37:48] going
[37:50] wrong we have to pray at all times Jesus
[37:55] say
[37:59] and there wasn't a city a judge which
[38:01] feared not God and neither regarded
[38:05] man I believe that Parable was written
[38:08] for this
[38:10] time that we have
[38:12] men that have
[38:14] power that they don't fear
[38:17] God they and they don't regard any
[38:25] man
[38:27] and there was a widow in that City and
[38:28] she came unto him saying avenge me of my
[38:35] adversary Jesus calls a character and
[38:39] she he calls her a
[38:42] widow there's no weaker and vul more
[38:45] vulnerable
[38:47] person a widow she didn't have anyone to
[38:51] defend she didn't have any children any
[38:53] family she didn't have any money
[38:57] she was a defenseless
[39:00] woman but she had an she had an
[39:05] adversary verse
[39:16] four and he would not for a while but
[39:18] after what he said with him within
[39:20] himself do I fear not God nor regard
[39:25] man
[39:32] yet because this wi of trouble with me I
[39:34] will avenge her lest by her continual
[39:37] coming she weary
[39:41] me these are the words of
[39:44] Jesus and the Lord
[39:47] said hear what the unjust just judge
[39:53] said shall not God avenge
[39:56] [Music]
[39:59] shall not God
[40:01] avenge what is your
[40:04] need what is your
[40:06] worry what is your
[40:09] fear at every
[40:12] level pastors
[40:14] ministers
[40:16] churches what is your fear what do you
[40:21] need shall not God
[40:24] avenge his own
[40:27] elect which
[40:29] cry day and night unto
[40:34] him God here he gives
[40:37] it for his
[40:39] elect that
[40:41] cry not only by day but also at
[40:48] night he's not talking about a day and a
[40:52] night he talking about the good the evil
[40:55] times in the day
[40:58] and evil times at
[41:02] [Applause]
[41:03] night though he be along with
[41:08] them I tell you that he will avenge them
[41:13] speedily nevertheless when the son of
[41:15] man
[41:16] cometh shall he find faith on the
[41:20] earth
[41:23] Peter he was going to be
[41:25] killed
[41:26] he had a death
[41:28] sentence there was nothing to
[41:32] do there was no human power on the earth
[41:35] to deliver
[41:36] him and the Bible says but
[41:40] but a
[41:44] church I imagine it was a family a small
[41:47] group that started
[41:50] praying because they
[41:53] understood what Jesus said to them
[41:57] shall God not
[41:59] avenge his
[42:02] elect that cry day and night unto
[42:05] him someone took
[42:09] control the leadership of that family of
[42:11] that
[42:12] group and they
[42:15] organized a prayer
[42:18] group and they said you're going to pray
[42:20] eight
[42:22] hours when you get tired the other one's
[42:24] going to pray eight hours and the other
[42:25] one
[42:26] hours and the other one8
[42:29] hours they were praying without
[42:32] seing I imagine
[42:35] Heaven the Angels praising
[42:38] God God receiving the
[42:41] glory I do this for you to
[42:44] understand this is just a drama for you
[42:46] to
[42:48] understand when prayers began to
[42:52] happen not in the amount of people what
[42:56] God
[42:57] hears it is the
[42:59] quality what moves
[43:02] God and those men started to
[43:04] pray Lord save
[43:07] Peter send an angel to
[43:10] help Lord we
[43:12] need they're gonna
[43:17] kill that's what they were praying Peter
[43:20] Peter
[43:22] Peter when a voice started to be heard
