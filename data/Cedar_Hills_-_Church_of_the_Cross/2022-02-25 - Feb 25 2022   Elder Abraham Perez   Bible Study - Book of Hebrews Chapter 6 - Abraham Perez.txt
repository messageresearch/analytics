========================================

you know they see it that we're gonna go into dangerous territory tonight if i ever studied for a message what we're going to speak about tonight it's such a delicate subject did i have to confess i was afraid to preach honest for many years oh yeah i would i would highlight it a lot of times but i will never go deep into the grain of what we're going to talk about tonight yesterday you can see how delicate it is i started since i got up until five o'clock in the evening of course not straight i would take a little break because [Music] because it's very delicate and these messages is not just to you people that are sitting here it's not only to the people that don't come to bible studies they're on our online so studio not only for you and for them to go to africa africa norway to brother martin it goes to many places so i am responsible for what i teach in tons of responsibility because in that in that day i will answer to what i teach and i want to be sure when i get before you your brothers and sisters there is god bless you my faithful brother i know you're always there for me here he said if we ever need to get close to god it's right now you just see what's happening around the world and the everybody's worried about the russians well let's go into our lesson this will be chapter 6 and uh open your bibles to hebrews 6. therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works in a faith toward god protection of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of the resurrection of the dead and and this will we do if god permitted we already know this from years back we know this this is only church reforms carnal reformation but it says leave those behind [Music] i am not perfect we ain't going to where we think we're going you see perfect and it says unto eternal judgment there cannot be reconciliation for for judgment that is why god had to take his own medicine medicine when he condemned man for sinning the only way he could reconcile was to take the place of man himself enemies and he became a sinner give yes and though i be scout of all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be a burn and have it won't work we your father and mother were born condemned for you were judged by the sexual desire of your father and mother because of their act and [Music] we see that jesus by one sacrifice he perfected forever his church iglesia are you in the church of the firstborn estas so then we know that man never seeks god no man can come to jesus except god draws him first then god breathes the breath into your nostrils and god came in with a new nature the old carnal nature died so then let us go into perfection so you have everything in gonna have everything in order the churches that paul visited [Music] [Music] told farmers god is good yo bueno we talked to him even when he resurrected we already talked to him sid when you blessed are they that have not seen but yet they believe they will have their reward so it's talking about us right now we never knew brother brennan but we believe the message that he brought brother vernon said hey that's time he said that's the hardest healing that satan can give him so then paul is trying here to separate law from grace we have two pictures here one is [Music] it means to turn from a certain course or doctrine to the truth to show the jews that's quite this letter to the hebrews trying to show the pattern of the old testament type in the new testament leaving the principles i really want you to learn this i want you to give me your undivided attention that we had we find out how we are perfected absolutely spotless and blameless not because we are not noticed because we are in him let me go back we do we do we sin every day and we have to be perfect yet we are perfect perfect because we are in him and god could no more judge us god and he if god would judge us then he would not be righteous because he already judged us when he judged christ he judged me so then he if he judged [Music] [Music] or when he judged christ upon the husband christo he took my judgment ertomo miguel i've been redeemed the holy ghost has given us the ministry to warn the people of what's happening [Music] their solarize false christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders and so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very last behold i have told you he doesn't say christ singular notice christo singular jesus christ plural is a crystal plural they shall arise false and false prophets so if they [Music] they have a message it's the genuine holy ghost of god upon them but they still are false then you say brother long hey how can this be anointed false teachers maestros saint matthew chapter five verse 43 matteo you have heard that it has been said thou shall love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you oh that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and send its reign on the just and on the unjust chaos uh [Music] oh here we go into the very nitty gritty like i said commodity all these years i've mentioned a lot of these scriptures you know i was afraid to teach in on this a lot of these scriptures is not so easy to come and teach to you people um do you think it was easy for me and caleb to teach in the book of revelation to the people in uganda apocalypse uganda there's a few things that we still do not understand [Music] and we don't try to say something just so you can think that we are we know everything in october i mentioned these scriptures a few times says can you see the man of branham when you have need of it necessity that god will come on the scene i thank my savior that he told me what the scripture is it is something that i and you should know is allocate your instead is definitely because you can reach people that i cannot you got yours your your brothers your sisters your father your mother and friends that you know that's why you come to church on sunday and i rejoice sandy with brother thomas message brother tommy jr preaches his teachings [Music] foreign for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift egos taran and were made partakers of the holy ghost and have tasted the good word of god and the power of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance then they crucify themselves the son of god afraid and put him to an open chain exponential have tasted not of the gifts uh gift singular gustaro no de los donas if the bible says it is impossible it is impossible for it is impossible for those [Music] and tasted of the good word they never got it they were borderline believers from what happened to them because it was impossible and what happened they perish in the wilderness perez and yet their names were taken out of the book whose numbers were on borralos deliver [Music] they were borderline believers so where do you get your knowledge of course you gotta go to church tennessee i learned from your father of course nobody could you know say it like he could not but we're through playing games can you see how near we are to go home just put your side on russia taking over there yeah but you can lead a horse to water but cannot make him drink tomorrow where do you get the knowledge in the life of different brothers and sisters [Music] hermanos how many people in since we started in this message all the people that we've known since those times [Music] everybody including myself we should examine ourselves daily including me do we sing daily that comes delicate then you reject the knowledge then it is impossible for you to ever be saved remember those back there recording were borderline believers they were born in the church they were born in the church here on iglesia think about it they had never seen the land el tereno we had never feel or heard the message of the album these people that were going with moses had never seen the land and because they were borderline believers they never entered into it is impossible for you to spiritual let's go a little further almost i got you thinking now i got you think that's where i wanted to get you yeah a they had never seen the land until [Music] if i want to go to juarez yeah well i'll m borderline believers they have the evidence they saw the evidence he says it is impossible if they have tasted of the good words why caleb they robbed the grapes there [Music] they perished in the wilderness never went in nunca entrada and here we are that was the first exodus you and i usted you are in the third have you gotten the evidence here there was a land beyond the river we've got thy evidence the evidence yeah it's the same holy ghost the same christ they had a knowledge of the truth don't all of you have a knowledge of the truth my girl oh yes the messages that come from behind these puppets we heard the brother carlos escuchamos carlos brother omar alan i cannot come to not even i was really getting a little crazy oh my god oh god how can people miss such tremendous services and stay home and i don't care if they hear me domingos and drive over 200 miles to be here and church with us but don't get me wrong normally we don't have a jezebel religion then we force the people to come it's whoever will no i'm not i know that there's many times and people that just can't come yo business you know it's impossible to come to every service but god knows we might not know but god knows if you can come will not come forever on that like i've said you people should be glad that it's not the funding pastor that gets the content i am minorly me and caleb we put [Music] oh my god oh dear the founding pastor was one in a million dollars just like just one caleb for one in a million person come on josue he knows where he is okay hebrews [Music] those 300 and some ministers in chicago in chicago they were going to come to be baptized in the name of jesus christ of christ they for those that were enlightened gospel business you said you were coming in you turned away from the message he says some individuals will come out as individuals and that's the sign of his coming churches who have seen and heard the truth and i indicted [Music] and the same thing [Music] capital losses verse one verso uno [Music] it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted as a heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost in participated and tasted of the good word of god and the power of the world to come in age of halloway to renew them again and to repentance seeing they crucified to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame the question is do you sing daily because yes or no see or no i thought it's gonna [Music] john 1 8 juan uno if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not enough method sorry if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness verse 10 he says yes if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not enough first john chapter 3 verse 6. remember juan capitulo says whosoever abandons in him whosoever sinneth had not seen him neither known him little children let no man deceive you he that was righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous either committed sinners of the devil or the devil's sinner from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil whosoever is born of god does not commit sin or his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god if you say you don't think that you make god a liar but he says here there is [Music] does not commit sin [Music] is still in you when you were born because you are of the world that is the reason you cannot have reformation and you cannot have birth without crucifixion in order to be resurrected in christ how can you make a man a sinner come up when the bleach of the blood of jesus christ is between him and god that would scatter sin all to be nothing on the wall in brenham what was happening he said let me see if i can take this out he said let me take this crucifix off the wall how do [Music] and free from the judgments illegally they'll wish you so then how can we sing enthusiastically you cannot sing because there is a blood sacrifice i sacrificed you the same there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk [Music] take gracie gracie which is the first color in the rainbow color thank you is correct [Laughter] and you know that's what we got we had to get a blood transfusion am i it purified our blood purification and eternal [Music] and god cannot see nothing but the blood of his own son because jesus is making intercessions constantly notice as we are getting ready to finish speaking segments but by the way as we read here come on in we ready in hebrews 6 4. give me 6 4 again says cuatro de nuevo for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost by the participated i'm reading this scripture that you can receive the holy ghost is i would get they never came to the baptism of the holy ghost they were only enlightened and they tasted of the graves and it takes me back to the vision that i got yes when brother venom knocked at the door in hanover and hannover i mean the the founding festival were by ourselves grave in the briefcase and i said brother branham can i carry your briefcase it was so heavy i couldn't carry it nothing he's speaking here to the borderline jews this is the last scripture if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge as the truth there remains no more sacrifice for sins brother little said when you're born in the kingdom of god you'll make mistakes because a lot of time we thought we made a mistake we were condemned [Music] you will have up god may have to take you away from this earth early did you understand she also said because if you make mistakes cristiano you're still a christian but he could cut your life short here on earth it does say the scripture yes [Music] willfully after we have received the truth after you have received the truth especially enlightened only by the knowledge that they have illuminators they never received the truth they didn't they only tasted it well no matter if i do something wrong you will say us he says he will forgive me brother says you see the mount urbana that shows you are not right because you still have a desire your heart is not right with god because remaining now you will do wrong but not willfully voluntary sometimes you are trapped in to do something that you did not mean to do this is you will god knows my heart the holy church moving on [Music] there's only one righteous it's his righteousness oh father forgive me then god does not see it we are brought into fellowship and grace with him yes and i hope this message in line you on this subject when i say messages not only on bible study everybody is a teacher to us we learn from everybody [Music] god bless each and every one of you were dismissed i just want to
