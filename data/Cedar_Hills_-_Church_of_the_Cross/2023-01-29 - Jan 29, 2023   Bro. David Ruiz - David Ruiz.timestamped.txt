[31:06] right
[31:07] and can you guys hear in the back is
[31:08] that okay yes okay
[31:11] so
[31:12] there was a meeting very much like
[31:14] tonight
[31:18] and there was a chief
[31:21] who decided to give his heart to the
[31:23] Lord
[31:25] and when he gave his heart to the Lord
[31:28] a prophet brother Branham explains to us
[31:30] saying that he was filled with the Holy
[31:33] Ghost
[31:35] how many want to be filled
[31:38] hold on keep him up
[31:40] aye real high let me see okay let me see
[31:42] everyone in the first row yes second row

[31:59] oh okay hold on
[32:01] okay I see the hands I see the hands
[32:04] all right oh about over here
[32:07] okay so we're in agreement we all want
[32:08] to be filled with the Holy Ghost yes
[32:11] so he was filled with the Holy Ghost and
[32:13] he was on fire baby
[32:17] you like that
[32:19] but
[32:21] after some time
[32:23] brother Branham saw this Chief again
[32:26] and he goes hey chief
[32:29] since you've gotten your new birth
[32:32] since you've received the Holy Ghost
[32:35] how has it been going
[32:38] and do you know what the chief said
[32:41] he goes wow
[32:46] pretty good
[32:48] and pretty bad
[32:49] and brother Branham goes
[32:52] explain to me what do you mean how can
[32:54] you do pretty good and pretty bad
[32:59] doesn't it make sense to only do good or
[33:02] only do bad
[33:04] oh no it's a good answer right there
[33:09] Chief goes
[33:10] pretty good
[33:12] pretty bad
[33:15] brother random goes well can you explain
[33:17] Chief said
[33:19] I find two dogs
[33:23] that are constantly fighting with each
[33:25] other
[33:26] these dogs don't like each other
[33:29] one of them is the good dog
[33:31] he's the white one
[33:33] pure he's clean
[33:36] and the other one that he doesn't like
[33:38] and he fights with
[33:40] is the bad dog
[33:41] that's the black dog
[33:43] and he's mean and nasty and sinful
[33:47] and they fly every day the moment I wake
[33:50] my eyes that's what I see
[33:52] dog barking and fighting and biting
[33:57] and brother Branham asked the chief he
[33:58] goes well chief
[34:01] got a question for you
[34:03] and I would think that he if he brother
[34:05] Brandon was here he'd like to ask you a
[34:07] question
[34:08] which dog wins
[34:13] the good dog
[34:15] the good dog
[34:19] the white one
[34:21] the white one
[34:23] the white one
[34:27] which one
[34:28] the good dog
[34:30] the good dog
[34:32] the white dog
[34:35] okay so all of our young children want
[34:38] the good dog the white dog the pure dog
[34:41] The Godly dog to win
[34:44] how many parents are in agreement with
[34:45] that
[34:47] all right
[34:49] but is he guaranteed to win
[34:51] parents
[34:53] oh
[34:55] you see a dog
[34:58] has to if that dog has to fight it has
[35:01] to have strength right
[35:03] to last in the fight to win a fight like
[35:05] a boxer right
[35:09] so where does he get his strength from
[35:13] oh we got a lot of raised hands
[35:17] from the Lord okay
[35:19] from God the Holy Ghost
[35:23] from Jesus
[35:25] from the Lord Jesus Christ
[35:27] from Jesus Christ
[35:30] from Brother Branham
[35:33] from the Holy Ghost
[35:35] the Holy Ghost
[35:37] from God's strength okay what about some
[35:39] of our older boys third row someone give
[35:41] me an out
[35:43] it's food
[35:45] so brother Yandel said his food
[35:48] so the dog the food that the dog eats
[35:51] gives him strength
[35:54] but the dog's food is brother random
[35:57] States
[35:58] reading your Bible
[36:00] as young children listening to your
[36:01] parents
[36:03] oh
[36:04] oh yeah that's right listening to your
[36:07] parents
[36:09] listening to God's word listening to
[36:11] tapes listening to the preaching not
[36:14] yawning during service
[36:17] how about that huh
[36:21] ouch
[36:22] a chief brother Caleb he he caught a few
[36:24] of us yawning last Sunday didn't he
[36:27] it's okay it happens I know I've been
[36:30] one of them
[36:33] and the laugh tells me you've also been
[36:35] one of them
[36:38] but that's the key
[36:40] it's the food that you feed the dog
[36:44] but if you feed the white dog and the
[36:47] black dog the same amount
[36:51] aren't they going to be the same string
[36:54] so then if you want the white dog to win
[36:57] who do you have to feed more
[37:01] together
[37:04] parents together
[37:08] parents were weak huh
[37:10] one more time parents
[37:13] there we go so if you want your white
[37:16] dog
[37:18] that's in you
[37:20] to beat the black dog
[37:22] that's in you
[37:24] you have to feed the white dog mark
[37:27] how
[37:29] am I giving it the word buddy
[37:32] all right
[37:34] and you know this story has become so
[37:37] popular

[37:40] World
