[13:27] out then it doesn't take us smart man or
[13:29] an educated man it takes a a man that's
[13:33] willing to Humble himself before God now
[13:36] we realize that he had a great thing to
[13:38] face he had to come back and tell his
[13:40] church all the people the very things
[13:43] that he had persecuted was right you

[14:39] here that in the last part now of the
[14:42] closing of the second chapter which I
[14:43] wanted to get to now watch he took not
[14:47] the nature of angels now who's he he's
[14:51] talking about Christ who's Christ God
[14:56] the logos of God the before there was
[14:59] any light before there was ever adom
[15:03] before there was ever a star before
[15:05] there was any visible thing God filled
[15:09] all space
[15:11] am and in that was nothing but
[15:15] Purity pure love pure Holiness pure
[15:20] righteous it was Spirit notice he took
[15:24] on the Seed of Abraham he become a man
[15:30] God made flesh among us to redeem us in
[15:34] other words God became sin that we
[15:38] Sinners might become partakers of him
[15:41] next verse listen that here for in that
[15:45] he
[15:46] himself had
[15:49] suffered God could not suffer in
[15:53] spirit he had to become flesh to feel
[15:58] the pain pain of sickness to feel the
[16:00] temptation of
[16:02] lust to feel the temptation of
[16:06] want to feel the temptation of hunger to
[16:10] feel the power of death that he might
[16:14] take it up himself to stand in the
[16:18] presence of the great spirit Jehovah the
[16:22] spirit not the man the spirit and before
[16:25] God could ever understand he being that
[16:29] great Holiness how he could ever
[16:32] understand after he condemn Man by his
[16:35] Holiness he condemn man and the only way
[16:39] he'll ever know how to justify man is to
[16:42] become man amen amen why he's a high

[17:19] tempted or in other words he is able to
[17:22] secure those to help those to make those
[17:27] to sympathize with
[17:29] because God himself became man in order
[17:32] to feel it and on Calvary on that old be
[17:36] and death once anchored its stinger
[17:39] anyone knows when a be anchors it
[17:41] Stinger it can't sting no more when the

[47:33] evening because I thought that Caleb was
[47:37] going to preach this
[47:39] morning probably the majority you also

[48:25] with a word this
[48:31] morning and it's good to see your pretty
[48:34] faces this
[48:39] morning this
[48:42] morning the interruption of nature part
[48:50] three and uh let's start with Revelation
[48:54] 6 verse
[49:03] you know I like to teach on
[49:09] Prophecy and like I've told you
[49:13] before I can teach you
[49:17] people but I cannot learn
[49:22] you God bless everybody this on
[49:29] online and those that don't feel well
[49:31] may God send his healing Angel and
[49:34] comfort you at this
[49:43] moment and I beheld when he had opened
[49:46] the six seal and lo there was a great
[49:50] earthquake and the sun became black his
[49:53] sackcloth of hair and the Moon became
[49:56] his
[50:08] blood the Lord add his Blessing to the
[50:11] re the where you may be
[50:17] seated I hope you are not in a
[50:21] hurry I might stay about three or four
[50:24] hours behind the
[50:31] I'm not going to say anymore because
[50:35] get I just said
[50:39] that now God has a a
[50:44] p how he does
[50:47] things he does it by a identifying
[50:51] himself in the
[50:54] scriptures
[50:56] our life here is nothing but a
[51:02] perversion because our life here should
[51:04] have should have been the right
[51:11] life but it was perverted by a natural
[51:18] birth the first
[51:21] life or First
[51:24] Union
[51:26] you were joined in Birth by
[51:32] Nature a natural
[51:36] act a natural
[51:41] human as being associated man and wom
[51:46] together in a sexual
[51:51] Affair which brought your natural life
[51:54] on this Earth
[51:58] and that life that we have is associated
[52:01] with sin and
[52:07] death the woman which is a
[52:12] byproduct was made that
[52:16] way in order to be
[52:22] deceived after the creation
[52:27] Adam had to take a
[52:31] byproduct for a
[52:34] wife now an animal made once a
[52:41] year to
[52:44] reproduce but the woman any
[52:49] time she was made that
[52:53] way C the attributes of God had to be
[53:00] displayed so what was
[53:03] it it was
[53:06] nature associated with
[53:11] death brother Ram
[53:13] said your first
[53:17] husband had ruled over
[53:21] you it was your Nature by a natur
[53:28] birth so
[53:31] naturally you love the
[53:34] world because you are part of the
[53:38] world your desires was by
[53:43] nature to love the
[53:47] world you are a part
[53:52] of then you say
[53:56] brother brother
[53:58] l i don't love the
[54:01] world excuse
[54:04] me excuse me do you don't love the
[54:08] world or throw away your television
[54:11] throw your car throw
[54:13] your throw them
[54:16] away you don't love the world who made
[54:20] all
[54:21] that people of the
[54:23] world so you part of the
[54:27] world I don't care how much Holy Ghost
[54:30] you
[54:33] have the serpent is still inside of
[54:38] you does the serpent in you wants to
[54:41] come to
[54:46] church how did the Apostle Paul
[54:50] say when I would do
[54:54] good
[54:55] evil is
[54:59] present how many
[55:02] times I'm not sping
[55:07] you I'm going to say like my nephew Tim
[55:10] he said when they came from
[55:13] Phoenix Pho he said I I'm only trying to
[55:17] help
[55:19] you I'm only trying to
[55:22] help he's because he's wife is a
[55:28] doctor of the
[55:30] physical but I am a doctor of the
[55:35] spirit amen amen
[55:40] now there there has to be an
[55:43] interruption of nature in all of
[55:47] us and when the six seal was
[55:51] open there was an earthquake
[55:56] oh we're going to hit the the
[55:59] earthquake it's going to be
[56:01] good not because I'm behind this
[56:06] P now I got your attention
[56:09] now I got your good that's what I
[56:13] wanted okay
[56:19] notice but there has to be an
[56:22] interruption of nature in your life
[56:28] that's why ye must be born
[56:34] again you have to
[56:38] separate you have to die to your first
[56:43] husband well you
[56:46] say I'll just divorce
[56:52] him there is no writing a div
[56:57] divorcement no
[56:59] sir he
[57:02] died the nature of the world has to
[57:07] die every SP of him has to
[57:13] die you know why it has to
[57:16] die you have to be re reunited again
[57:21] with your other
[57:23] nature
[57:28] you know your name of your first
[57:33] nature was born and put in a book of
[57:39] life and all your dids were written in
[57:43] it
[57:46] too and everything you've done with that
[57:52] nature was put in a book called The Book
[57:55] of
[57:58] Life now when you were separated from
[58:01] that
[58:04] Union by spiritual
[58:08] death your natural
[58:15] desires did all of us have natural
[58:20] desires and I don't have to go but you
[58:24] the how come the alcoholics or the
[58:26] druggist have those
[58:32] desires how what desires did you have
[58:36] before you became a
[58:40] Christian and are you still
[58:44] tempted and lead us not into temptation
[58:48] but Deliver Us from
[58:53] Evil
[58:55] ah but when you start hearing the word
[58:58] of
[59:01] God you knew there was something
[59:07] better but if that is what she
[59:12] wanted she was pregnated with that kind
[59:16] of
[59:20] pregnation look at the churches
[59:23] now
[59:25] Bible
[59:26] schools a bunch of
[59:30] intellectuals everyone disagreeing with
[59:33] the
[59:35] other different
[59:38] doctrines it is a big
[59:41] mess it is a modern
[59:45] babyon I was talking to to the pastor in
[59:48] Lima
[59:51] Peru he calls me over the phone if I can
[59:54] answer him certain
[59:59] questions I said
[1:00:02] brother how many churches in Lima
[1:00:06] Peru he says there's over 120 churches
[1:00:10] in
[1:00:15] Peru
[1:00:16] why well I don't believe what you
[1:00:21] teach and then they go open the little
[1:00:28] church and then somebody there doesn't
[1:00:31] like what they
[1:00:34] did so on and
[1:00:37] on especially you go to big cities and
[1:00:40] there's a
[1:00:42] bunch uh different
[1:00:47] churches that wouldn't be
[1:00:50] bad if there was
[1:00:53] Fellowship
[1:00:55] but there's no
[1:00:56] fellow there's very few that get
[1:01:01] together so what separates
[1:01:06] people what happened to their
[1:01:10] nature much can be said but I'll leave
[1:01:15] it
[1:01:18] notice when you you done with that
[1:01:21] nature it was put in a book called The
[1:01:23] Book of Life
[1:01:28] and we know now that there's something
[1:01:33] better like I said it it's nothing but a
[1:01:37] modern
[1:01:40] Babylon when you are separated from your
[1:01:43] first
[1:01:46] Union by a spiritual
[1:01:49] death but now you are
[1:01:52] remarried again to a new spiritual
[1:02:00] union of eternal
[1:02:03] life that
[1:02:06] germ that was in you at the
[1:02:09] beginning and found
[1:02:12] you now your old book is
[1:02:18] gone with your old
[1:02:23] Union but now your
[1:02:26] name has been
[1:02:30] transferred from the old
[1:02:33] book When God put it in the sea of
[1:02:39] forgetfulness and now you stand
[1:02:41] perfectly before
[1:02:45] God and now your
[1:02:48] name is in a new
[1:02:52] book not in the Book of Life
[1:02:55] but in the Lamb's Book of
[1:02:59] Life your new life is in the Lamb's Book
[1:03:04] of
[1:03:05] Life your marriage
[1:03:10] certificate for your true
[1:03:13] Eternal
[1:03:18] is from the beginning it takes
[1:03:23] hold
[1:03:25] and what
[1:03:28] happen when your nature is
[1:03:34] interrupted when Christ
[1:03:38] Jesus was being formed in the Virgin
[1:03:43] Mary notice that's when the persecution
[1:03:48] set
[1:03:52] in and it's the same way need every one
[1:03:55] of
[1:03:57] you Gans
[1:03:59] [Music]
[1:04:02] 49 I like to give
[1:04:06] scripture so you don't think that it's
[1:04:09] Abraham just telling you
[1:04:14] this Pro
[1:04:18] scure my little
[1:04:21] children of whom I travail in birth
[1:04:27] again until Christ be formed in
[1:04:34] you Christ is being formed in
[1:04:41] you when you are
[1:04:45] dying how could Christ be forming
[1:04:52] you if you still have the desires of
[1:04:55] your old
[1:04:59] nature that's was Paul telling the
[1:05:02] Galatians
[1:05:05] there so when you're
[1:05:08] dying Christ is being formed in
[1:05:15] you and Christ is coming to
[1:05:20] life and watch the persecution say
[1:05:29] remember when you your old
[1:05:34] nature remember
[1:05:37] Danny we like to hang out with all the
[1:05:40] guys some of them would smoke others
[1:05:47] drink and some of us did some of that
[1:05:53] thing that was your old
[1:05:56] nature ah but I
[1:05:59] remember when I was working in Los
[1:06:04] Angeles and I we we bought a car me and
[1:06:07] [Music]
[1:06:08] Danny and I was working
[1:06:12] Tommy I had a quite a few
[1:06:17] friends but I went to a party a company
[1:06:20] party where I
[1:06:23] worked
[1:06:25] and
[1:06:26] I I hit one of those big concrete
[1:06:31] pillars on the
[1:06:36] freeway I he head on about 2:00 in the
[1:06:43] morning it's a miracle that I'm behind
[1:06:46] this
[1:06:48] pul the guy that was next to
[1:06:52] me he head hit the wind chill and his
[1:06:55] head was sticking out he was
[1:07:03] bleeding and and and and to right now I
[1:07:07] didn't I didn't even know that I had
[1:07:08] that
[1:07:12] accident the motor came inside the
[1:07:16] car and and my chest hit the steing
[1:07:22] wheel now that's what they tell
[1:07:26] me and I was knocked into the
[1:07:33] freeway when I woke

[1:07:40] later I felt something on the bottom of
[1:07:43] my
[1:07:46] feet and I said I was in in fast
[1:07:52] sleep

[1:08:34] me in other
[1:08:37] words he God was not taking care of
[1:08:42] me he was taking care of the gift that

[1:19:44] AIT when I was a pastor of the
[1:19:50] apost look

[1:19:55] you play
[1:19:56] it there was this girl that came from
[1:20:00] this was in
[1:20:03] City this was this girl that was
[1:20:10] in and she was
[1:20:14] playing and I always wanted to play the
[1:20:20] guitar no my brother tell me he got when
[1:20:23] he got the first guitar he could he was
[1:20:25] natural he could play right
[1:20:30] away so when I was in the Army I bought
[1:20:33] me a
[1:20:37] guitar I came

[1:21:18] me God didn't give you that

[1:22:00] are if we didn't have Caleb as our
[1:22:06] pastor we couldn't you
[1:22:09] know what we know because thank God that
[1:22:12] we had an
[1:22:17] apostle who set the word in order
[1:22:24] we got good evangelists here
[1:22:28] this and we got I'm not the only
[1:22:32] teacher you get any one of of these
[1:22:35] young
[1:22:40] ministers as Bernie Garcia
[1:22:44] said this message makes theologians out
[1:22:47] of everyone
[1:22:50] yeah let's go on one more
[1:22:53] let's learn
[1:22:56] together there's many places where the
[1:22:58] Bible
[1:23:01] states that the sun would be
[1:23:06] darkened but in the scriptures that are
[1:23:10] in the Bible not one of that say with
[1:23:19] sack Ezekiel 32
[1:23:25] e
[1:23:29] and and when I shall put thee out I will
[1:23:32] cover the heaven and make the Stars
[1:23:35] thereof dark I will cover the sun with a
[1:23:37] cloud and the moon shall not give her
[1:23:51] light
[1:23:55] all the bright lights of heaven will
[1:23:57] make over thee and set Darkness upon thy
[1:24:01] lens say the Lord
[1:24:10] God sack cloth is made of animals
[1:24:14] especially goat
[1:24:20] and was the other one go
[1:24:24] camel it's a coarse
[1:24:29] fiber something like your burlap
[1:24:40] saap you know like where you used to buy
[1:24:43] 100 pounds of beans
[1:24:48] in it's a it's it's a a p F or a sack
[1:24:54] that light cannot
[1:25:00] penetrate and what is
[1:25:03] sackcloth it's used mainly in
[1:25:11] morning
[1:25:14] penitence to mortify the
[1:25:19] flesh which is an act
[1:25:22] by which an
[1:25:25] individual seeks to modify their simple
[1:25:34] nature of the process of
[1:25:39] sanctification and during the
[1:25:43] tribulation the
[1:25:48] 144,000 are called by Moses and Elijah
[1:25:54] and they will
[1:25:56] prophesy for
[1:25:59] 1,260
[1:26:01] days which is three and a half
[1:26:04] years and when those 144,000 are
[1:26:12] prophesying they will be closed in
[1:26:20] sex that's in
[1:26:23] tribulation so they needed an
[1:26:26] interruption of
[1:26:30] nature sin was a nature of the
[1:26:34] world and the sun was
[1:26:38] blackened and the prophet Joel was
[1:26:41] seeing
[1:26:43] this
[1:26:48] Joel and I will show wonders in the
[1:26:51] heaven and in the earth blood and fire
[1:26:54] and pillers of
[1:27:05] SM that was verse 30 right the sun shall
[1:27:09] be turned into darkness and the moon
[1:27:11] into blood before the great and terrible
[1:27:15] day of the Lord
[1:27:21] come
[1:27:23] Into
[1:27:25] Darkness I ask the question to you
[1:27:30] people what
[1:27:35] Darkness oh we're going to get something
[1:27:39] here Exodus
[1:27:43] 20 verse
[1:27:47] 19 and they said unto Moses speak thou
[1:27:52] with us and we will hear but let not
[1:27:56] speak with us L we
[1:28:07] die and Moses said unto the people fear
[1:28:10] not for God is come to prove you and
[1:28:13] that his fear may be before your faes ye
[1:28:17] sin
[1:28:21] not
[1:28:30] look at verse
[1:28:32] 21 and the people stood AAR off and
[1:28:36] Moses Drew near unto the deck thick
[1:28:40] Darkness where God
[1:28:50] was our brother here from
[1:28:53] church last last year asked me this
[1:28:59] question I don't understand that that
[1:29:02] scripture brother
[1:29:04] L how can a god of
[1:29:08] Life be in the
[1:29:17] darkness you know
[1:29:19] what it means that God
[1:29:22] Darkness means that God is in secret
[1:29:30] places that's right how come when the
[1:29:33] plague of Darkness see that's why Moses
[1:29:37] is in in a be there during the Great
[1:29:43] Tribulation cuz he can blacken the Sun
[1:29:47] and bring Darkness Moses
[1:29:50] can
[1:29:53] and the when the six seal was
[1:29:56] open there was an
[1:29:58] earthquake and the sun was
[1:30:02] blackened but he had
[1:30:08] sa it it was
[1:30:12] darkened Moses can do
[1:30:14] it m did
[1:30:17] that and it says the moon will turn to
[1:30:20] blood
[1:30:23] Moses can do
[1:30:28] that
[1:30:30] Darkness he called for darkness in
[1:30:35] Egypt and the Egyptians had no
[1:30:40] light but the Israelites had
[1:30:45] light the israelit had
[1:30:49] light the world is in darkness right
[1:30:53] now but we have
[1:30:57] light we have
[1:30:59] light to them God is in
[1:31:04] darkness we know the secret
[1:31:10] places isn't the rtor going to be a
[1:31:17] secret noce
[1:31:20] can
[1:31:22] they were
[1:31:24] blinded just like the foolish
[1:31:28] virgins the foolish
[1:31:31] virgins give us some of your
[1:31:35] oil but how could they get
[1:31:39] oil when the lady oans were
[1:31:46] blind I Cel
[1:31:49] thee anoint th eyes with
[1:31:54] eyes that they thou may
[1:31:58] see because L went to a complete black
[1:32:07] out it's we are living in a blackout
[1:32:14] world and it's the angels look down the
[1:32:18] and see past the
[1:32:20] bister
[1:32:24] to a dark
[1:32:27] world where there is no
[1:32:31] law the only
[1:32:35] light is the light that you
[1:32:39] have so the children he sing This Little
[1:32:43] Light of
[1:32:48] M if they look down God looks down and
[1:32:51] only the light that we
[1:33:00] have so Leia went to a complete
[1:33:06] blackout complete apost
[1:33:10] apostasy that is ending in the Great
[1:33:15] Tribulation and Lady
[1:33:17] oia the only church age
[1:33:22] on the outside knocking to get
[1:33:29] in brother venham said we have
[1:33:34] discovered that the word also teaches an
[1:33:37] invasion of
[1:33:42] air eror eror
[1:33:49] ER the error there is a complete
[1:33:53] blackout of Truth in the last
[1:33:59] day as the Lord is getting ready to to
[1:34:05] come that is
[1:34:07] why lady oia was destroyed by an
[1:34:14] earthquake Moses can interrupt
[1:34:19] nature he already
[1:34:23] Exodus
[1:34:27] 10 and the Lord said unto Moses stretch
[1:34:30] out thy hand toward Heaven that there
[1:34:33] may be Darkness over the land of Egypt
[1:34:35] even darkness which may be F which verse
[1:34:39] is that
[1:34:50] brother
[1:34:59] and Moses stretched forth his hand
[1:35:01] toward heaven and there was a thick
[1:35:03] Darkness all the land of VI for three
[1:35:14] days not one another neither Rose from
[1:35:18] from the place for three days but all
[1:35:20] the children of
[1:35:21] had light in their
[1:35:34] dwelling the only light now is in the
[1:35:39] bright but once the bride is taken
[1:35:44] away noce the interruption of
[1:35:49] nature then the Moon becomes his
[1:35:54] blood Genesis
[1:35:59] 114 and God said let there be lights in
[1:36:03] the firment of the heaven to divide the
[1:36:06] day from the night let them be for signs
[1:36:10] and for seasons and for days and
[1:36:20] years
[1:36:23] now in the original
[1:36:26] Hebrew it does not say
[1:36:29] Seasons he said it will be
[1:36:34] signals so what signals does a Heavenly
[1:36:38] Bodies tell
[1:36:42] us so what signals does the moon send
[1:36:48] us
[1:36:49] notice so then and in
[1:36:55] 1962 the astronomers predicted that the
[1:36:58] world was going to blow to
[1:37:04] pieces and the American newspapers made
[1:37:08] fun of
[1:37:13] it but brother Venom
[1:37:16] says something is fixing to happen one
[1:37:20] of these days
[1:37:24] and
[1:37:25] then five planets came in
[1:37:31] line it had never
[1:37:35] happened and I
[1:37:38] predict watch here
[1:37:41] Paula I predict this has a spiritual
[1:37:49] application and before God does does
[1:37:51] anything on
[1:37:54] Earth he shows it in
[1:37:57] heaven because it comes from the
[1:38:02] Supernatural and drops into the
[1:38:07] natural and is made
[1:38:10] manifest because we were not made for
[1:38:16] heaven we were made for the
[1:38:19] Earth so we
[1:38:22] know that the moon controls the
[1:38:28] waters oh the moon controls the
[1:38:33] people follow me
[1:38:36] closely you understand where we're
[1:38:40] going because the
[1:38:43] moon
[1:38:47] influen the actions of the people on
[1:38:50] earth
[1:38:52] Job
[1:38:56] 38
[1:38:59] 31 can thou bind the sweet influences of
[1:39:03] the pades or lose the V of
[1:39:15] or
[1:39:18] Hallelujah can th bring forth a wrath in
[1:39:22] his season or can thou guide our tourist
[1:39:26] with his
[1:39:34] son
[1:39:37] the a constellation of seven
[1:39:43] stars but one was
[1:39:48] missing and the three wise men found
[1:39:54] they knew where that star
[1:39:57] was
[1:39:59] no the
[1:40:02] observatories or the
[1:40:05] denomination could not find the
[1:40:10] star and this is the
[1:40:13] meero MEO is a
[1:40:19] constellation he's got TW that he's got
[1:40:23] 12 planets around 12
[1:40:29] St was in the first Bible in the
[1:40:35] Zodiac another name
[1:40:40] for and it covers it's
[1:40:44] 12 because Jacob had 12
[1:40:49] sons
[1:40:53] I've said this before
[1:41:01] but I want to I said to my mother look
[1:41:06] Tommy I told my
[1:41:12] mother how come so many babies are born
[1:41:14] in this
[1:41:17] month my mother said because of the Moon
[1:41:23] look brother
[1:41:25] julan oh my mother's so
[1:41:31] crazy when I read the
[1:41:34] message I found out I was a crazy one
[1:41:38] not my
[1:41:40] mother my mother had more Revelation
[1:41:42] than
[1:41:44] me it controls the isn't the moon a
[1:41:49] policeman the takes care of the
[1:41:55] wers so the wers means the
[1:41:58] people your
[1:42:01] character whatever you
[1:42:03] do is influenced by the
[1:42:08] moon notice where we're
[1:42:12] going notice where we're
[1:42:16] going what influence you is the flowing
[1:42:21] of an
[1:42:22] invisible
[1:42:27] substance that fills the space in the
[1:42:33] heavens and serving is the
[1:42:38] medium
[1:42:43] serving for the transmission of
[1:42:48] light for of the light way
[1:42:52] waves and and other
[1:42:56] forms of radiant
[1:42:59] energy and it is
[1:43:03] thought to affect the
[1:43:08] characters and the actions of
[1:43:13] people amen Revelation 121 AP
[1:43:19] apocalypses
[1:43:23] and there appeared a great wonderand in
[1:43:25] heaven a woman clothed with a sun and
[1:43:29] the moon under her feet and upon her
[1:43:31] head a crown of 12
[1:43:42] Stars we know that the
[1:43:47] moon she reflects light from the sun
[1:43:52] so then the Lord said let there be
[1:43:55] lights in the firmament for
[1:44:01] signals so what type of signal did the
[1:44:06] solar eclipse that just happened a while
[1:44:10] ago what was a spiritual
[1:44:19] application
[1:44:21] it
[1:44:22] occurred when the moon got between the
[1:44:25] Sun and the
[1:44:28] Earth and the
[1:44:30] moon It cast a
[1:44:35] shadow did you see that shadow when when
[1:44:38] the moon covered the sun there
[1:44:42] was it's what he did he cast The
[1:44:47] Shadow and remember we read here on and
[1:44:53] 121 that there was good things to
[1:44:58] come we're going to find what was the
[1:45:00] good
[1:45:03] things so
[1:45:08] notice it occurred when the the moon got
[1:45:12] between the Sun and the
[1:45:15] Earth and the moon cast a shadow over
[1:45:18] the
[1:45:19] Earth it has a spiritual
[1:45:24] meaning are you people
[1:45:28] listening the
[1:45:30] Moon is gradually
[1:45:35] moving from the
[1:45:38] Earth but the Moon is a in a perfect
[1:45:45] distance in
[1:45:48] position to appear in the
[1:45:52] SK and it is the same size as the
[1:45:59] sun How can there be when the sun is 400
[1:46:04] times bigger than the
[1:46:08] moon Isaiah
[1:46:17] 3026 moreover the light of the Moon
[1:46:20] shall be is the light of the sun and the
[1:46:23] light of the sun shall be Sevenfold is
[1:46:26] the light of seven
[1:46:40] days and when that alignment
[1:46:44] comes they call it the diamond
[1:46:49] effect
[1:46:51] he leaves the corona visible around the
[1:46:59] Sun and he looks like a diamond
[1:47:04] ring watch the spiritual
[1:47:10] application in the book of
[1:47:13] Hebrews Isaac could not take possession
[1:47:16] of everything that Abraham has
[1:47:24] until he got
[1:47:26] married now when the bride gets married
[1:47:30] in
[1:47:32] heaven she can walk out in full
[1:47:36] [Music]
[1:47:40] possession and when she does
[1:47:43] that the bride makes an
[1:47:49] exodus follow me closely now
[1:47:52] here as we turn the corner to
[1:47:57] finish because she have she has full
[1:48:03] possession she is clothed with the
[1:48:09] sun Psalms 19 verse
[1:48:16] one the heavens declare the glory of God
[1:48:20] and the firmament CH his handy
[1:48:37] work which verse was it
[1:48:47] 191 day and today I speak and night unto
[1:48:51] night shth
[1:48:59] knowledge there is no speech nor
[1:49:02] language for their voice is not
[1:49:07] heard their line is gone out through all
[1:49:11] the year and the work to the end of the
[1:49:13] world and have he said a tabernacle for
[1:49:17] the
[1:49:19] Sun
[1:49:27] is there a from the
[1:49:32] sun which is as a
[1:49:35] bridegroom coming out of his
[1:49:38] chamber and rejoices as a strong man to
[1:49:42] run and
[1:49:45] race brother Brandon preaching from the
[1:49:49] Sun
[1:49:51] and we see the foolish
[1:49:54] virgins they go to the
[1:49:57] moon and they
[1:49:59] say isn't the moon a reflector of the
[1:50:06] sun they get the light from the
[1:50:09] sun and I saw a woman clothed with the
[1:50:16] sun
[1:50:18] notice the foolish virgin
[1:50:21] give us some of your
[1:50:24] oil but the bride has made an
[1:50:28] exodus from the Moon to the
[1:50:32] Sun so the
[1:50:34] Moon is no longer a
[1:50:39] reflector so when the foolish virgin
[1:50:42] wakes
[1:50:46] up does she wake up too
[1:50:51] there is no reflector in the moon no
[1:50:55] more even in that
[1:50:59] time even then the
[1:51:02] sun is in
[1:51:05] darkness Nature has been
[1:51:10] interrupted Revelation 1212
[1:51:18] apocalyps the therefore Rejoice ye
[1:51:21] heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to
[1:51:24] the inhabiters of the earth and and of
[1:51:27] the for for the Devil is come down unto
[1:51:29] you having a great WRA because he know
[1:51:32] that he has but a short
[1:51:46] time and when the dragon saw that he was
[1:51:49] cast into the Earth he persecuted the
[1:51:51] woman which brought forth The Man
[1:52:03] Child and to the woman were given two
[1:52:06] wings of a great Eagle that she might
[1:52:08] fly into the Wilderness to a place where
[1:52:10] she is nourished for a time and have a
[1:52:13] time from the face of the
[1:52:18] serpent
[1:52:30] and the serpent cast out of his mouth
[1:52:32] water as a flood after the woman that he
[1:52:35] might CA her to be cre away of the
[1:52:47] flood and the Earth help the woman and
[1:52:50] the Earth opened her mouth and swallowed
[1:52:52] up the flood which the Dragon cast out
[1:52:55] of his
[1:53:05] mouth and the dragon was brought with a
[1:53:13] woman as that is Rome with the woman is
[1:53:17] a bride as was Roma
[1:53:21] but the the the bride has already made
[1:53:24] an exodus from the
[1:53:29] Moon and he was full of
[1:53:33] Wrath and the dragon went to make war
[1:53:36] with the remnant of
[1:53:42] herity the remnant is the foolish
[1:53:47] virgin and it is also the
[1:53:55] 144,000 so when the bride
[1:54:00] lives the sleeping virgin was put into
[1:54:03] other
[1:54:06] Darkness where there was
[1:54:09] weeping
[1:54:11] wailing the nation of
[1:54:14] teeth and at the same
[1:54:17] time the great Tri ration falls on
[1:54:27] them so when he opened the six Hill
[1:54:31] there was a great
[1:54:34] earthquake and we're going to finish
[1:54:36] with the earthquake right
[1:54:41] here St Matthew
[1:54:48] 241 forgive me for taking your time
[1:54:54] but but this is
[1:54:58] life this is life it's not my
[1:55:02] word it's the word that the bright is
[1:55:05] like put putting fuel in your spiritual
[1:55:13] tank
[1:55:16] nowas and Jesus went out and departed
[1:55:19] from the temp Temple and his disciples
[1:55:21] came unto him to show him the buildings
[1:55:23] of the
[1:55:31] temple and Jesus said unto them see not
[1:55:34] all the things for I say unto you there
[1:55:37] shall not be L here one stone upon
[1:55:39] another that shall not be thrown
[1:55:48] down
[1:55:52] and as he said upon the Mount of Olives
[1:55:55] the disciples came unto him privately
[1:55:57] saying tell us when shall these things
[1:56:00] be and what shall be the sign of thy
[1:56:02] coming and of the end of the
[1:56:16] world there have never been so many
[1:56:18] earthquakes is
[1:56:22] now the Bible says a there's a great
[1:56:30] Earth notice as as we're finishing
[1:56:35] now
[1:56:37] 1 the Bible talks about this great
[1:56:43] earthquake the words of
[1:56:46] Amos who was among the hurtman of tea
[1:56:52] which she saw concerning Israel in the
[1:56:54] days ofah king of
[1:57:02] Judah and in the days of
[1:57:05] job the son of Joes king of
[1:57:11] Israel two years before the
[1:57:17] earthquake it was such a great
[1:57:23] earthquake that it is there has not been
[1:57:27] a greater earthquake for 4,000 years in
[1:57:31] the
[1:57:36] Bible
[1:57:39] notice Zechariah
[1:57:44] 144 and his feet shall stand in that day
[1:57:47] upon the Mount of Al
[1:57:53] which is before J Jerusalem on the
[1:57:59] East and the M ofle shall CLE in the
[1:58:02] midst therea the
[1:58:08] East and toward the
[1:58:11] west and there shall be a very great
[1:58:16] valley and Heaven to move toward the nor
[1:58:20] North and half toward the
[1:58:30] South and you shall flee to the Valley
[1:58:33] of the
[1:58:37] mountain for the of the mountain shall
[1:58:41] reach unto
[1:58:46] a and you shall flee
[1:58:50] like as he fled from before the
[1:58:52] earthquake in the days ofah king of
[1:59:00] Judah he was a mighty here in Zechariah
[1:59:03] is talking about that great
[1:59:09] earthquake
[1:59:11] okay and there and when the Sixth Seal
[1:59:14] was
[1:59:16] open there was a great earthquake
[1:59:20] Grand some of you might
[1:59:25] disagree but me and K had a good
[1:59:31] talk and I know Tommy J is in agreement
[1:59:37] also that great earthquake that opened
[1:59:41] the six
[1:59:44] seal which is that great
[1:59:48] earthquake
[1:59:50] I always have
[1:59:53] thought that that great
[1:59:56] earthquake is when the bride is picked
[2:00:01] up and Los Angeles will sing into the
[2:00:08] Pacific and whoever doesn't
[2:00:11] agree God bless
[2:00:14] you but Caleb told
[2:00:18] me about a vision that your father
[2:00:23] had that the founding Pastor was in in a
[2:00:30] plane and and as he was going on this
[2:00:35] plane he looked
[2:00:37] down and Los Angeles was seing into the
[2:00:45] ocean the pl
[2:00:48] means
[2:00:51] you know Revelation is
[2:00:54] symbol so then he was he was he had been
[2:00:59] raptured I have a booklet
[2:01:02] here I don't know if anybody in this
[2:01:05] church has
[2:01:07] it written by Perry
[2:01:10] greenry green it is called the
[2:01:13] earthquake
[2:01:17] judgment let me read
[2:01:19] what says
[2:01:21] here I'm finishing with
[2:01:25] this after making this
[2:01:29] statement brother Bram turned to his son
[2:01:33] and
[2:01:35] said Billy Billy where are you
[2:01:44] standing Billy Paul said Billy Paul
[2:01:48] downtown Los
[2:01:50] Angeles
[2:01:52] Angeles brother vham says again where
[2:01:54] are you
[2:01:59] standing Billy Paul said Billy Paul in
[2:02:03] front of the M Company downtown Los
[2:02:13] Angeles Caleb before he left or talked
[2:02:18] to me
[2:02:22] he said he said Uncle would you please
[2:02:26] explain that to the
[2:02:35] congregation so how many have walked
[2:02:39] down Broadway in Los
[2:02:42] Angeles Angeles California yeah yeah we
[2:02:47] in the 1950s me and my brother
[2:02:53] Danny
[2:02:55] okay so
[2:03:02] then go
[2:03:07] ahead I I don't want to see
[2:03:11] but I I won't tell you if you believe
[2:03:15] that Los
[2:03:17] Angeles thinking of Los
[2:03:22] Angeles Billy Paul just passed
[2:03:27] away the son of brother
[2:03:34] Venom so
[2:03:38] then oh I didn't finish reading yes oh
[2:03:42] the main part yeah forgive me no no
[2:03:46] thank
[2:03:47] you
[2:03:54] why does he have me here okay
[2:04:00] noce at this
[2:04:04] point brother Brena made a prophetic
[2:04:10] statement Billy he
[2:04:13] said I may not be
[2:04:17] here
[2:04:19] here is where the problem
[2:04:23] is that that brother Venom missed
[2:04:28] it so he made a he prophesied and he
[2:04:32] missed it
[2:04:37] bad so
[2:04:39] then brother Brenham
[2:04:41] said I may may not be
[2:04:46] here but you will not be an old
[2:04:52] man
[2:04:55] until will sing will swim right where
[2:04:59] you are
[2:05:04] standing so did bilul die a young
[2:05:11] man he said you will not be old he was
[2:05:16] 88 so they said brother Ram Miss
[2:05:20] so do you see why you need somebody to
[2:05:23] teach
[2:05:28] you I mean you don't think that I get
[2:05:30] the revelations right
[2:05:35] now but God gives you Revelation when he
[2:05:38] sits it is
[2:05:43] time years
[2:05:45] back we didn't need
[2:05:47] it now that we're in the end
[2:05:51] time we need to know these
[2:05:55] things you will not be an old
[2:06:01] man how can that be if he was 88 years
[2:06:07] old and once
[2:06:10] time is God hidden and revealed in
[2:06:17] simplicity
[2:06:19] but you know what in order to know this
[2:06:25] Revelation you need a
[2:06:27] key I got the
[2:06:30] key yeah Caleb got the
[2:06:33] key got the key Jimmy has a
[2:06:39] key you need the
[2:06:43] key what
[2:06:45] happens when the r come
[2:06:49] are you going to be lifted an old
[2:06:52] man you going to be lifted a young
[2:06:57] man and Billy Paul is going to be there
[2:07:00] a young man when he
[2:07:03] living and he sees Los Angeles going
[2:07:06] down and see the
[2:07:10] shark is going to see those
[2:07:13] sharks and you will too see the you will
[2:07:16] be

[2:26:30] really in reality I even though I knew
[2:26:33] it I could not find it till till this
[2:26:37] morning I had someone had sent it to
[2:26:40] me and uh and and then uh and and then I
[2:26:44] I I misplaced it and then and and then I
[2:26:47] couldn't find it again but I found it
[2:26:51] this and they they asked a a man uh uh
[2:26:55] we were privileged by God uh to go on a
[2:26:58] tour this in May right before my papa
[2:27:01] passed
[2:27:05] away and what I'm going to show you or
[2:27:07] or give you is what is on the May
[2:27:10] Company
[2:27:15] website May May Company and I stood we
[2:27:19] stood me and the pastor along with our
[2:27:23] families we stood outside of the May
[2:27:26] Company in here in
[2:27:31] May yes and and and so so this is not
[2:27:34] something that we I I looked for it and
[2:27:37] I I I uh they asked the question
[2:27:41] here and it it it's a by an anonymous
[2:27:44] person that is writing into the May
[2:27:46] Company
[2:27:51] and it says I I I have I have heard I I
[2:27:54] have hear the same
[2:27:56] rumor and it says I wonder if you could
[2:28:01] help I heard a rumor that there was a
[2:28:03] flood in the May Company building
[2:28:05] downtown Los Angeles sometimes in the
[2:28:15] 1970s
[2:28:17] and and and sharks were supposedly
[2:28:19] swimming in the basement is there any
[2:28:21] truth to
[2:28:24] this and the man
[2:28:26] answers there is no reference to a flood
[2:28:29] or sharks of the May Company in Los
[2:28:31] Angeles Times
[2:28:35] archives and it was probably an urban
[2:28:38] legend around the time of the popularity
[2:28:40] of the film
[2:28:44] Jaws and there he goes on there are no
[2:28:47] records of this or a flood in the May
[2:28:50] building in the
[2:28:53] [Music]
[2:28:54] 70s it is used as an Evidence uh of a
[2:28:58] prophecy made 1520 years earlier however
[2:29:01] no evidence
[2:29:05] exists and he says the full prophecy is
[2:29:08] that part of Los Angeles will fall into
[2:29:11] the
[2:29:14] sea this has been reduced over the years
[2:29:17] to a flood with sharks in the May
[2:29:23] building okay and so the the the
[2:29:26] question keeps on
[2:29:28] coming and again in October n uh of
[2:29:34] 2017 and it says please did sharks swim
[2:29:37] swim in the May Company basement during
[2:29:40] the California
[2:29:45] earthquake
[2:29:49] please let me
[2:29:50] know and the answer is
[2:29:53] this yes there were sharks swimming in
[2:29:56] May in the May building's
[2:30:00] basement this was confirmed by a worker
[2:30:03] there at the
[2:30:06] time was sent to all the workers to stay
[2:30:09] out of the basement due to shark
[2:30:11] swimming
[2:30:15] there not something that I
[2:30:18] imagined but this is something that God
[2:30:21] had said in in the
[2:30:25] 1970s I do believe without a shadow of a
[2:30:27] doubt what our what our what what our
[2:30:30] senior Elders said
[2:30:33] tonight that as we go up and the
[2:30:35] earthquake
[2:30:38] happens brother Billy Paul is not an old
[2:30:42] man but I I I just wanted just to to
[2:30:46] read this for
[2:30:47] you that in the 1970s brother Billy Paul
[2:30:51] was not an old
[2:30:54] man there are people that will try to
[2:30:57] discredit wherever they
[2:31:01] can they're they're they're combining
[2:31:04] the two the swimming of the
[2:31:07] Sharks and the sinking of Los
[2:31:11] Angeles let me tell you what the prophet
[2:31:14] of God said this
[2:31:17] oh caperna said
[2:31:19] Jes thou who exalted into
[2:31:23] heaven will be brought down into
[2:31:26] hell for if the mighty Works had been
[2:31:29] done in Sodom and
[2:31:32] gomorah it have been standing to this
[2:31:35] day and Sodom and gomorah lays in the
[2:31:39] bottom of the
[2:31:41] sea and Caper is in the bottom of the
[2:31:45] sea now they might not want to believe
[2:31:48] this but this is the prophet of God to
[2:31:51] our
[2:31:53] generation thou City who claims to be
[2:31:56] the city of the
[2:31:59] Angel who has exalted yourself into
[2:32:03] heaven and sent all the dirty filthy
[2:32:06] things of Fashions and
[2:32:11] things till even the foreign countries
[2:32:14] come here to pick up our
[2:32:19] field and send it away to your fine
[2:32:22] churches and Steeples and so
[2:32:25] forth the way you do remember one day
[2:32:30] you'll be laying at the bottom of the
[2:32:33] sea your great honeycomb under you right
[2:32:39] now the wrath of God is boucing right
[2:32:42] beneath
[2:32:43] you how much longer he will hold this
[2:32:46] sand bar hanging out over
[2:32:50] that when that ocean out yonder a mile
[2:32:54] deep will slide in
[2:32:58] there back to the salt and
[2:33:02] sea it'll be worse than the last days of
[2:33:08] Pompei repent Los
[2:33:11] Angeles repent the rest of
[2:33:13] you and turn to God
[2:33:16] the hour of his wrath is upon the
[2:33:21] Earth flee while there's time to
[2:33:25] flee and come into
[2:33:27] Christ that's why I said that is the
[2:33:31] prophecy of none other than the seventh
[2:33:37] angel people might saying oh no it's not
[2:33:39] going to
[2:33:40] happen it's not if it's going to happen
[2:33:44] you might say Well when is it going to
[2:33:46] happen
[2:33:47] that might be another another question
[2:33:50] but it will happen that is thus sayth
[2:33:54] the
[2:34:03] Lord we we we we take with our lives and
[2:34:07] and uh and in our lives uh we we just if
[2:34:11] we come to church we come to
[2:34:13] church but remember one day you're going
[2:34:16] to wish that those Church doors were
[2:34:21] open and one day they won't be but while
[2:34:26] there are
[2:34:27] open flee to Christ flee to Goan don't
[2:34:32] flee to this church flee to Christ flee
[2:34:36] to Goan flee to the word and in honor of
[2:34:40] brother Billy Paul
[2:34:42] this you know as you you hear Brother
[2:34:45] Bram and life
[2:34:48] story and and brother brandham is is is
[2:34:51] is is recounting the
[2:34:53] story and it's not a story it's a
[2:34:56] vision when he went beyond the curtain
[2:34:58] of time and he meet Sharon
[2:35:02] Rose she was she was a a just a little
[2:35:08] baby and he goes and he meets a young
[2:35:12] lady didn't recognize her she come to
[2:35:16] talk to him and she says Mom's waiting
[2:35:19] for
[2:35:19] you I'll stay here and I'll be waiting
[2:35:22] for Brother for for Billy
[2:35:25] Paul we're gonna ask the Lord
[2:35:28] Jesus to rest his Gallant
[2:35:31] Soul greatest
[2:35:33] witness of the ministry and the life of
[2:35:37] brother
[2:35:38] brandom many people might say many
[2:35:40] things about brother
[2:35:43] brandom but let me tell you this is the
[2:35:48] Revelation Upon This Rock I'll build my
[2:35:51] church and the of Hell cannot Prevail
[2:35:54] against the church because built upon
[2:35:58] Revelation you know I when when we had
[2:36:01] the
[2:36:02] opportunity to finish when we had the
[2:36:05] opportunity brother Jerry come on when
[2:36:08] when we had the opportunity to meet
[2:36:10] brother brother Billy Paul and Brother
[2:36:13] Joseph and catch the vision tour catch
[2:36:16] the vision in in Silver City New Mexico
[2:36:19] in Silver City I had always thought this
[2:36:22] and maybe maybe this sounds strange to
[2:36:27] you but but to me brother brother
[2:36:30] brother Jacob I had always
[2:36:32] thought would brother brandham have
[2:36:34] liked
[2:36:37] me I don't know maybe maybe it sounds
[2:36:39] maybe it sounds
[2:36:41] corny maybe it does but I always
[2:36:44] thought brother brandham would liked
[2:36:48] me and when I met the bus there in in
[2:36:53] the parking lot of
[2:36:57] Walmart Walmart and he stretched brother
[2:36:59] Billy Paul stretched forth his
[2:37:04] hand he stretched forth his hand to me
[2:37:08] and I I shook his
[2:37:10] hand and I embraced him I knew brother
[2:37:13] Brandon would have like
[2:37:17] now now now maybe that sounds real
[2:37:22] simplistic but I
[2:37:24] remember till the day that I die he
[2:37:28] called me to the
[2:37:29] platform to show people how brother
[2:37:32] Brandon prayed for for for
[2:37:36] people and he placed his hands upon me
[2:37:39] now now now now you believe this or not
[2:37:43] but I believe in and I'll take this to
[2:37:44] to to when H my time
[2:37:48] goes and I'll take this with
[2:37:51] me he said put his hands upon me the
[2:37:54] anointing was out of this
[2:37:57] world as later on as we we we went to to
[2:38:01] greet
[2:38:02] him he tolds me this
[2:38:05] words you know he was with
[2:38:08] us now remember that brother Billy
[2:38:11] Paul was the man besides brother
[2:38:15] brandham
[2:38:16] that was able to see the angel of the
[2:38:18] Lord now and we we we're grateful to
[2:38:22] that and I'll never I'll never
