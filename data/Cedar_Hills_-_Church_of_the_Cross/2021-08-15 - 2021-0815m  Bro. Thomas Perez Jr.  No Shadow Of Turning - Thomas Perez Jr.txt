[Music] [Music] do [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] hey [Music] i clean all the secrets [Music] it just won't fade so many different stories we thought could not be redeemed but it's against our darkest values we start to see the beauty of the blood the goodness of this grace and mercy on his earth that can never be explained heaven's best takes all the scars for the worst in all of [Music] of us and we stand free that's [Music] the goodness of this grace best takes all the scars for the worst in all of us that's the glory of the crossing the wonder of his life [Music] the goodness of disgrace [Music] is [Music] love is [Music] notice now notice now we're going to read in the bible and the the seventh seal that's found in revelations the eighth chapter and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of a half heart that's all we have now we're going to notice i remember after the fourth chapter of revelations the church is gone after the the four harsh writers has went out the church is gone see and then they were satan and his angels was kicked out and then they come to the earth and the battle set in again because eve broke down the barrier from where she was uh isolated behind the word of god you believe in god's mathematics you don't you sure lost you'll sure get lost in the word if you start four or six or or something besides just the mathematical words running an order you'll sure have in your scene a cow picking grass on top of a tree somewhere you'll certainly run out because god does not his whole word does run completely in in mathematics yes perfect the most perfect there's no other literature written like a language so perfect in mathematics now the the eighth chapter only reveals the scene of uh the scene of the seventh seal where nothing else is revealed now nothing all the way back from genesis is seventh chapter the seventh seal spoke seals from the very beginning in genesis the seventh jesus christ is speaking himself told her the end time and when he got told all said six seals when he got to seven he stopped there it is it's a great thing and nowhere through the church age since in the early apostolic church has the protestant church ever had a prophet tell me who it was never but we are promised in the last day that to return to the church again for the benefit of straightening up all that has been missed undone left undone of course predicted here that the seventh angel's message would finish the mysteries of god amen now we went through it all we see that it's perfectly in harmony with the scripture that's the reason now could you imagine when this person comes on the scene when he does remember it'll be so humble and thanks to the churches are messing up long ways if there be one among you you're spiritual or a prophet i the lord my god will make myself known to him and speak to him in visions through dreams interpret dreams somebody have a dream the prophet will be able to interpret it and if he has a vision he speaks it i'll make myself known to him through visions and dreams make myself going and if what he says comes to pass then hear that prophet because i'm with him now return now to the eighth first of the uh by the first verse i mean of a chapter revelation 8 1. we must remember that this seventh seal is the end of time of all things right the things written in the seventh seal book sealed up of the plan of redemption from before the foundation world it ever begins it is the end it is the end of the struggling world is end of struggling nature it's the end of everything in there is the end of the trumpets it's the end of the vials it's the end of the earth it's it's even the end of time time runs out the bible said so it's the end of the viles and even in the ushering in of the millennium that's on the seventh seal it's just like firing a rocket into the air and that rocket explodes here and it goes up then it explodes again it puts out five stars one of those stars explodes goes out five stars smith and then one of them stars explodes goes out five stars submit see it fades on out now how is he going to do it that's what we're going to go with we don't know notice the breaking of this seal was so great that heaven was hush-fired in silence for the space of a hammer god is it green what is it it was hushed cabins it was the same move for a half hour when the seventh sealed mystery in the book of redemption broke over [Music] think of it but it's broke amen the lamb breaks it you know what they were all about i mean they didn't know their blessing just stopped why what is it i'm going to tell you my my revelation and now uh certain as i stand in the platform tonight i had the revelation that revealed it's in a threefold manner sitting there when this left me something has come to me and said don't fear not in your little voice like on the inside of me spoke i have to just tell you the truth just exactly what happened something hit and said don't fear this is that third pull i was standing with a little baby shoe when he told me something make your first pull and when you do the fish will run out to the lure so then watch your second pull say because it'll only be small fish he said then the third pool will get it and there's three great things that goes with it and one unfolded today or yesterday the other one unfolded today and there's one thing that i cannot interpret because it's in an unknown language but stand right there and look right straight at it and this is the third ball coming up amen that's the reason all heaven was south remember the seventh messenger was the seven messengers was the noted one to me the seventh angel it seemed more to me than any i see they were standing like this and i was standing here and i was watching those other see one first bunch of little purrs feathers all beat down you remember them and they all flew eastward and the second bunch were brighter bigger birds look like doves pointed wings they flew eastward first pull second bull then the next was angels and it's standing right there and this explosion left and i was looking this way towards the west and they come and just pick me up and then i went out of my knowing and the one of them coming was the one that looks strange to me was the one on my feet to the left where i entered the constellation at but counting from the left to the right it would be the seventh angel okay coming across now remember the seven lessons do you remember the pyramid of white rock now notices that now when this taken place junior was standing in a field and had a had a big pyramid to it like that and there was something left on the rocks and i was revealing that to the people is that right junior about a year before it happened and notice the next thing now i took some kind of a bar and cut it off and on the inside was white rock that had nothing wrong on it and at that time i started to the west and i told them all i said don't go out west stay here and look on this until i return went west for the blessed return back to the east with the holy spirit interpreting this unwritten word amen amen but i know that it was then seven thunders putting themselves right close together just banging seven different times and it unfolded into something else that i see then when i see that i look for the interpretation flew across there and i couldn't make it out that's exactly right the hour isn't quite yet far amen what happens is that those seven thunders that he heard thunder and was forbidden to write that's what the mystery is laying behind those seven consecutive thunders going out now why that is proven why it is the secret that no one knows about john was forbidding to write about it even even on a symbol about it wow this is why there was a no activity activity in heaven it might give away the secret do you see it now amen but here is seven straight thunders rock and roll one two three four five six seven that perfect number then heavens couldn't write that heavens can't know about it nothing else because there's nothing to go on his relaxing time it was so great till it's kept secret from the angels now why if satan should get a hold of it he might do great damage that's one thing he don't know if they made one move it might give something away so they just shut up quit harping everything stopped uh seven god's perfect number seven is right down the road seven thunders utter straight together like you're spelling out something notice at that time john's started writing he said don't write it jesus never spoke of it john couldn't write it angels know nothing about it amen what is it it's the thing that jesus said even the angels of heaven didn't know nothing about it i don't seven so the thing for you to do is therefore the power is or whatever takes place at all blended together so i could truly say that to the best of my understanding according to the word of god and the vision and the revelation the interpretation thereof is just god bless you each one [Applause] this amen amen amen what privilege it is to be in god's house once again why don't you turn around and smile at your neighbor bless them this morning i'm [Applause] later god bless you this morning as we bow our heads and we go before the author this morning dear lord heavenly father we come

everybody maintain make sure your mass still maintains fitted uh little uh perez uh uh mukama perez he's two years old today and we're grateful to the lord jesus for that is and uh before we we go any further i i just wanted to to read this i thought this would be such so vital for i didn't expect me to change much simply give worldly stuff i still wore pants every once in a while so when i went to the camp i was waved by the the love everyone had for the lord and then the question came am i worthy of the gospel i didn't think about the question nope nope i might have just said yes right off the bat but the more i looked into it the more i started thinking the way i was living in the way and the way that i had been following the word was wrong and in the camp they talked about the result of excuses is the mark of the beast that realization hit me hard i was i knew that the love of this community community and the love god gives me is more than what the world could ever offer i and i won't and we appreciate that great testimony testimony now uh we we want to we do want to say we want to greet everyone on on the internet i always knew we were being seen in africa in latin america and throughout the united states but not until the other day that a brother told me that even in europe they are watching the simulcasts at all of our brethren around the world and we're thankful to the to to the lord jesus this morning we we want to go into some some scriptures before i before i go into that i had the privilege to open up the convention the virtual convention in in in colombia on friday in colombia in colombia and we're we're very very happy and thankful to you brother fabios for his confidence that he has placed in us to do such a work establish i do want to say that that i i trust the lord more than now than ever before and i i think that everybody should every day it should be a new day the bible speaks to us about new mercies doesn't mean that the mercy of god ever gets old to us and we're grateful to god that he is always understanding of our trouble i was out mowing my weeds not my grass my weeds but and i bought this uh riding lawnmower to mow these weeds and i don't know if any of you ever have these conversations with the lord well i i i am his son he is my father yes it is not a good thing it's to be disrespectful to almighty god when are you going to give me your whole heart and you know when you have a dialogue with god he already knows your heart before you even know it if you would have known our life we've been christians our whole life i don't know what it is to be in the world that does not make me a better person than anybody that was in the world makes me a better person what makes me a little bit more responsible but i tell you one thing for sure not to make a person that he feels better than another person that would keep you from such a thing but as i as i look and i'm 56 years old they tell me that i sing my first song at two and a half and once when you think that you have surrendered everything that you have to godot without without understanding this i said this he said he's i i told him he says when are you going to give me your whole heart and i said whenever you you heal my son and i'll heal your son how do you unders how do you rationalize that the only thing that you can understand is this you heal my son i'll heal and i i i looked at the scripture or i looked at myself i should say and and when i hear the word of the lord what are we going to call this immediately i was telling the pastor and i started sawing them down with the handsaw yes i have a chainsaw i have all kinds of different things i could use a man came by with his wife walking has got to moves us when i first sometimes it might be somebody did something wrong to me he said sometimes it might be you doing something wrong to somebody that you never made right he says and this this this brother yesterday something happened to him and this man this man would follow him until one day god delivered him from that shadow there's a song but he said that man never followed him again there are things in your life that will follow you every single because it dwells inside of you because there is a shadow that lives inside of you and anything can trigger it anything can make it come back to life but let me tell you they committed every good gift gonna win every perfect gift comes from the father of life well there is no shadow of tourney the old-fashioned way antigua a brother brother told me one time in so many

something can ever receive is god's own life you have the holy ghost that's god's own life yes or no that is god's own life the thing about it is you ought to gotta understand in this is you're just
