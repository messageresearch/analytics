[33:56] [Music]
[34:02] but uh he kept us in prayer
[34:05] [Music]
[34:19] away
[34:22] i want to read here in matthew 21
[34:31] god bless all the visitors god bless
[34:33] those online
[34:41] amen man
[34:43] today i brought you a giant prince
[34:47] [Music]
[34:54] and it says that when they drew nye unto
[34:56] jerusalem and were come to beth page
[34:59] onto the mount of olives
[35:01] then sent jesus to disciples
[35:10] [Music]
[35:12] saying unto them go into the village
[35:14] over against you and straightway you
[35:16] will find an ass tied and a cult with
[35:18] her
[35:20] loose them and bring them unto me
[35:28] young
[35:30] [Music]
[35:32] and if any man
[35:34] say
[35:35] ought unto you you shall say the lord
[35:38] hath need of them
[35:39] and straightway he will send them
[35:48] all this was done that it might be
[35:49] fulfilled which was spoken by the
[35:51] prophet saying tell ye the daughter of
[35:53] zion behold thy king cometh unto thee
[35:56] meek and
[35:57] sitting upon an ass and a cult in the
[36:00] fall of a nest
[36:14] [Music]
[36:15] and as you're being seated we're going
[36:16] to continue to read and then bless may
[36:18] the lord add his blessings to the
[36:19] reading of the word
[36:24] now it says
[36:33] right so
[36:34] we want to find out how meek he actually
[36:36] came
[36:45] where everything has been completely
[36:47] watered down
[36:50] right so we automatically get the
[36:52] definition of me
[36:56] and we we tend to
[36:59] put it into the terms of today right
[37:04] real timing
[37:06] though right real uh
[37:08] don't say a word about anything don't
[37:10] make any riffraff
[37:13] [Music]
[37:15] don't agree with anybody you know just
[37:18] just try not to say anything too
[37:20] previous no more
[37:22] [Music]
[37:32] you tell anybody anything and whoa i i
[37:35] got rights here
[37:41] right and it says that he came meek upon
[37:43] a donkey
[37:49] and the disciples went and did as jesus
[37:51] commanded them
[37:53] and brought the ass and the colt and put
[37:55] the punt put on them their clothes and
[37:57] they sent him thereon
[37:59] and a very great multitude spread their
[38:01] garments in the way others cut down
[38:03] branches from the trees
[38:05] and straw them in the way
[38:08] and the multitude that went before and
[38:10] that followed christ saying hosanna the
[38:13] son of david
[38:15] blessed is he that cometh in the name of
[38:16] the lord hosanna in the highest
[38:20] and when he had come into jerusalem
[38:22] all the city was moved saying
[38:24] who is this
[38:54] and
[38:57] in the highest and when he was coming to
[38:59] jerusalem all the city was saying who is
[39:00] this and the multitude said that
[39:02] this is jesus the prophet of nazareth of
[39:05] galilee
[39:26] i think they put victory in there but
[39:28] that's good i mean but it's his
[39:30] triumphant entry right
[39:34] now we want to find out
[39:38] and has he had a triumphant entry in you
[40:09] and we see here
[40:12] that he came in a meek and lonely way
[40:18] so this is what was called his
[40:19] triumphant entry
[40:23] and jesus in the next verse verse 12
[40:27] and jesus went into the church of god
[40:32] no no the church of god
[40:36] right
[40:38] right okay so let's just bear with me
[40:41] there and jesus went into the temple of
[40:43] god
[40:46] so we find out right here
[40:49] that coming to church
[40:52] just isn't going to get the job done
[40:56] you might come to church every service
[41:00] and this morning i'm going to piggyback
[41:02] a little bit yes
[41:04] i'm
[41:18] it doesn't matter how much church we
[41:20] come to import
[41:23] the bible says here
[41:25] that jesus was going to the temple jesus
[41:29] and the bible says it is
[42:00] in the temple
[42:27] the temple of the lord
[42:41] the house of prayer
[43:10] is
[44:18] right okay so it's getting a little
[44:20] further down two why did he need two he
[44:22] needed a dog
[44:26] okay so
[44:27] so sorry why two porquedos right so you
[44:31] ride one you lead the
[44:35] did other have baggage that like if
[44:37] you're hunting or you know you're
[44:38] outfitting you have you're riding one
[44:40] and you're carrying all your supplies
[44:45] right
[44:46] what was it that he needed two four
[45:02] i don't
[45:29] i come not to bring free
[45:31] but knowing
[45:33] but i come to bring a sword
[45:36] right and so
[45:38] the true definition of
[45:41] me
[45:43] if you read in matthew 5 five five
[45:45] verses
[45:48] it says blessed are the meek for they
[45:50] shall inherit the earth
[45:54] and so right away oh i gotta be real
[45:57] meek so i can inherit the earth
[46:12] are they
[46:19] [Music]
[46:25] does that sound like many of
[47:07] that he can enter into
[47:33] [Music]
[47:50] you're not
[48:32] whoa right
[48:35] say yes i come in the name of the lord
[48:38] no there's a difference
[48:41] and he who comes in the name of the lord
[48:46] and when the lord himself
[48:49] with the lord himself
[48:53] there's a difference
[48:54] one is blessed
[48:56] oh there's many that go to africa oh he
[48:59] was just going afraid there's many that
[49:00] go around the world
[49:03] and they go in the name of the lord
[49:06] they preach
[49:08] they teach in sin but there's no
[49:10] difference
[49:12] from him
[49:13] who comes in the name of
[49:28] he
[50:10] and that he entered
[50:12] into the temple
[50:15] he made a triumphant entry
[50:19] into the temple
[50:25] he's not coming into the church
[50:31] he's coming into the temple
[50:36] now how many temples of the lord do we
[50:38] have here this morning
[50:41] right
[50:43] we should be the temple as brother jerry
[50:45] preached
[50:48] a temple was structured
[50:51] and what did he come for
[51:02] those predestinated seed that god seen
[51:04] before the foundation of the world
[51:20] esperanza
[51:47] it had to be on the earth
[52:01] who kept it in darkness yeah
[52:13] [Music]
[52:14] when the s-o-n shines
[52:42] no wonder the gospel is
[53:12] that's good news
[53:15] but
[53:17] never a news
[53:20] never a news
[53:22] lieutenant news never news
[53:27] was there news like this news
[53:32] that he who made the promise
[53:36] has confirmed the promise
[53:39] that he's alive forevermore
[53:43] and have the keys of both death in hell
[53:50] was shook away
[53:51] all the gloom was shook away
[54:47] there shall be light again across the
[54:49] earth
[55:31] right so he had many victories
[55:33] victorious right how many believe that
[55:37] but he hasn't had his greatest victory
[55:40] he hasn't had the greatest victory yet
[55:45] jesus greatest victory
[57:22] is
[57:23] [Music]
[57:37] you need to be reconciled back to god
[57:41] and what needs to happen
[57:43] is that your nature must be changed
[57:50] we have preachers you know it's just
[57:51] coming
[57:52] to always
[58:17] [Applause]
[58:20] you gotta
[59:02] no the light la luz
[59:06] many today
[59:08] we try to find out
[59:11] as brother henry was talking
[59:14] henry and it says listen lay aside every
[59:18] week
[59:22] lay aside every week
[59:35] [Music]
[59:44] those are just the attributes
[59:58] but
[1:00:12] incredible
[1:00:22] separate yourself from maybe somebody
[1:00:25] unbelief
[1:00:40] right what our problem is today
[1:00:45] is that we like to walk as brother henry
[1:00:47] said
[1:00:49] we like to walk in darkness
[1:00:53] and we like to walk in the light he
[1:00:54] knows
[1:01:29] [Music]

[1:04:24] in darkness
[1:04:38] jesus
[1:04:52] i was

[1:05:31] where is it drawing its life from
[1:06:39] it doesn't matter how long it's been in
[1:06:40] darkness
[1:06:43] or why it's been kept in darkness
[1:06:58] open
[1:07:37] and maybe you find yourself in a church
[1:07:38] condition today
[1:08:06] uh go on and on
[1:09:05] right
[1:09:07] acetylene it's like gases
[1:09:09] or mixtures like brother abraham knows
[1:09:11] what i'm talking about right outside
[1:09:14] you got hydrogen you got h2
[1:09:17] carbon dioxide you got all these i used
[1:09:19] to work in a welding store
[1:09:23] but you're carrying around a good
[1:09:24] mechanical can of gasoline
[1:09:30] and you have the mechanics
[1:09:31] mechanics but that's might be just as
[1:09:35] well you might be just carrying a gas a
[1:09:37] can of water
[1:09:43] right you say oh i got gasoline
[1:10:14] he brings you the spark
[1:10:18] park
