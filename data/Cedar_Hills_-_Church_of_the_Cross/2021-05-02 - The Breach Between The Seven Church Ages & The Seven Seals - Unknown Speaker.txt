========================================

and now tonight we are have uh starting on the subject of the breach between uh the uh seven church ages and the seven seals now now we're going to turn to the fifth chapter now this is not the seventh seal it is the breach between the church ages and the seven seals and i saw in the right hand of him that set up on a throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who's worthy to open the book and loose the seals at all and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under either under the earth was able to open the book neither to look upon whatever and i went much because no man was found worthy to open him and to read the book neither to look there on and one of the others said under with me we not behold the line of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i be held in low in the midst of the throne of the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain heaven seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth unto all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set up on the throne the seventh angel begins to sound there's the messages wrote out there we got to take book form now at the beginning of the sounding of the message the mystery of god should be finished and we realize that in the scriptures over in malachi 4 there is to be a one like john a and elijah to whom the word of god can come to and he is to reveal by the holy spirit all the mysteries of god and restore the faith of the children back to the faith of the apostolic father restore back all these mysteries that's been broken through these denominational years now we see that this seven seal book now is the mystery of redemption it's a book of redemption from god now all the mysteries at this time should be finished at the sounding of this messenger now here's the angel on earth and another angel mighty messenger come down see this angel was an earthly angel messenger but here comes one down from heaven rainbow covenant only christ it could be just exactly like was in revelations standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks with a rainbow the look upon as jasper and saristol and here he returns back in the 10th chapter after the coming time and all the mysteries is to be finished and the seals are to be broke and proclaiming that it's time is no more and he said when the seventh angel has begun to sound then the mystery should be finished and time for the angel to appear now notice the seven seals holds the mystery of the moon until we can see what those seven seals has sealed in we're only pursuing them things but god in every statement and everything has to vindicate it to make it right so his children will watch those things be alert and the book will not the seals will not be released until the message of the seventh angel but the genuine revelation of god will be made perfect in that sound vindicated truth and this seven seal book remember it was closed here in revelations the fifth chapter and in revelations the 10th chapter it is open now we're going to see what the book says about how it becomes open and is not made known until the lamb takes the book and breaks the seals and opens the book the lamb's got to take the book now and it is not made known until the lamb takes the book and breaks the seals because remember the book was being holded in the hands of him that's set up on the throne and the lamb comes to him that sits upon them and takes the book out of his right hand takes the book oh that's deep we'll try to solve it out if we can by the help of the holy spirit there will be the sounding of the seventh angel's voice and then the book will be revealed at that time now don't say no about that people had saved back there but the mysteries that they couldn't understand how that god can be three and yet one oh so many things how can eve eat an apple and uh because the wreckage of the whole world [Music] how can these things be and the seals are to be opened by the lamb and revealed to the church and that time is no more [Music] how wonderful now let's read uh a scripture i got written down here ephesians 1 13 and 14 now in whom we also trusted after that you heard the word of truth and the gospel of your salvation in whom after that you believe you were sealed with the holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the the session unto the praise of his glory see now while we got the scriptures open let us uh see the holy spirit air itself is a seal the holy spirit is a seal and a seal signifies what a finished work the holy spirit being a seal to the individual like i used to work for the railroad company and uh with little box cars with cans and different things from the canning factory and but then before that car could be sealed the inspector come around the sea of that car was properly loaded and that inspector would test everything to see if it was properly in place if it wasn't he condemned the car then we had to do it all over again until the inspector was satisfied then when the inspector's satisfied he shuts it over the inspector shuts the door and the inspector places a seal upon it and then no one can break this seal until it reaches its destination that's what the holy spirit's been doing [Music] he goes and he inspects the holy spirit inspects that person until he's steadily satisfied and knows that they are then they are sealed on to their eternal destination there's not nothing can ever break that seal the bible you're putting your scripture ephesians 4 30 said grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed until the day of your redemption hold that word redemption the day that the book of redemption has been revealed and the redeemer comes to claim is possession or another thing a seal uh signifies his ownership when you are bought by the blood of jesus christ and sealed by the holy ghost you no longer belong to the world or anything pertaining to the world you are owned by god another thing is a seal is a security seal means you are secure you don't believe in eternal security i don't know but now but a seal signifies security to its destination and the holy spirit seal cannot be broken you know i've heard me say that people said the devil maybe do this no no there will not do it she just wants to see me because when you're sealed in he's sealed out now amen you went out to him he couldn't get into you because the only way to get into you is come through the same process that you have you'd have to be saved sanctified and filled with the holy ghost let it be your brother so see so he didn't do it you just went to the borderline and come back lusting for the things of the world you never went all the way over in the kingdom you see across jordan the death the self amen now notice now this book is sealed and and you are seated with the book until the day of redemption now 8 romans 8 22. to begin for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travail in pain together now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to whip the redemption of our bodies go and make us all folks feel good not to make us all feel good [Music] waiting for this out we understand this will take place at the first resurrection see nature is growing we are growing everything is groaning because we realize there's something not right and the only way you can groan and wait for it is because there has been new life coming here that speaks of a new world now break the seals and released all the mysteries to them to the seventh angel whose message is to reveal all the mysteries of god the mysteries of god raising these seven seals see it that's what he said here all the mysteries lays in these seven seals and when he becomes the lion he takes the book that's his rights god's hell is the mystery but now the lamb comes nobody can take the book it's still in the hands of god if this book mysteries is the word of god the seventh angel has to be a prophet for the word of god to come to you [Applause] no priests hopes or anything else can get it the word don't come to such amen the word of god comes only to a prophet amen always amen amen malachi 4 promise such until i meet you god be with you you
