thank you we're grateful to you once again in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen you may be seated amen we we're we're we are endeavoring tonight after after speaking to to our pastor I I I I uh felt a a a burden on my heart uh to do something for our joy uh people we we we called it the joy project and uh we we've always looked around us and we we see our elderly people and let us call them our mature people but to put all those words to the side we've just used the acronym of Joy or just older youth you know right now they they they do say that uh Michael Jordan's about 54 years old there is no doubt in his heart that he can beat any player that is alive today his his body just won't permit him I I I always I I I I always think about ourselves and as the time goes by I I we we first we're we're inspired by our people of what keeps them going I always wanted to feel and and and understand why is it that that people how is it that they came to know the Lord and what is it that would make sister Carmen drive all the way from Silver City to be here on a Sunday morning it's got to be something that that that moves you something that inspires you that motivates you and that gives you the faith to keep on going and each one of these these people that we are going to portray tonight and on Wednesday in my book they are the heroes of our faith and I think we deserve to give or they deserve for us to give each one of them has showed me how to live a Victorious and Christian Life they are the shoulders that we stand on Cedar Hills Church of the Cross would not exist without these people their faithfulness is unmeasurable their continuation of the word of God that has been brought To Us by our Prophet is the foundation where we are built upon what they have taken from the gospels and made it alive is what makes this church an active church we are not a church that just comes to to service on Sundays to fill a pew we matter in this world I want us to know as Cedar Hill's Church of the cross the world would not be the same without you we are according to the word of God we know where we get our faith and we know where we get our life and our light and our life has continued and the light of the Gospel has continued to shine through us I want want every young person to know these people are not actors you're going to see a film tonight they are not actors they're living breathing human beings with the spirit of God inside of them that'll take them to the greater Hereafter and still with the heart of of coming to serve the Lord when I when I hear as as I hear our older musicians play and I hear Brother Tony just playing that piano I know that there is a God someplace the Bible speaks to us that there is a deep calling to the deep and if there is a deep calling somebody's got to respond we don't look for Heroes outside the world Our Heroes live right here they are the people that have have spawned this generation they are the people like my uncle Abraham that you heard this morning like my uncle Mike we can go on and on but you will see them and you will hear them with their own words tell you what Christ means to them that is what inspires us that's what takes us to Uganda is the foundation upon where we are built now I I I want us to understand that without without purpose in life it's difficult to live if you didn't know which way to go you would know what to do these people have showed us the way I I I seen the the life in the ministry of my my pops and I got to spend a little bit of time with him today and you know when when my boy prayed for him and he starts crying there there is something about it that that the devil can do anything that he that that he wants to with the will of God there is something inside the soul of the human being that is God himself God pours himself inside of you when you hear the word of God something's got to do something to your life I want to thank all of our young people that that that took this to their hearts and really believed what these these people were saying when you want to know what a man looks like how he acts we see our people that are going to be portrayed when you see a woman of how real lady should act we're going to see real ladies here in this film we're not going to see people like we see in the world that's not normal this is the word of God it's only for Supernatural people and as we we thank the young people I want to thank you for taking your time volunteer in your time to make this project available I want to thank our joy members that that that that that let a young person ask them these questions because I want us to understand this as brother Bram says they they they are leaving the footprints on the sands of time and all those are Mighty big Footprints at times but I'll tell you we have trusted in them let them trust in us that he that started a good work in you will finish it in us and I do want to say as brother brandham SP speaks to us in the message God hiding himself in Simplicity the beauty of the church is the character of the people each and every one of us starting from myself I am not my father I have never claimed to be my father I have been I have I I carry his name but each and every one of us is a portion of what he is each and every one of us that have received the Holy Spirit have been placed into this Kingdom well you know what it's all about and I want to thank you thank you each and every one of the joy members when I see you I see Christ and I can say tonight without reservation what a beautiful picture may God bless you for your lives keep on keeping on God bless you [Music] My Heart Will shout through [Music] the to the king of King my heart will s [Music] [Applause] [Music] you as a great writer said remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth while the evil days come not nigh then Thou shalt have no pleasure in it how Lord Jesus you said to Peter when when you were young you got up and went where you wanted to but when you get old someone packs you where you would not go let them remember now is the day this is the time grand father how did you come to know the lord well in 1962 in October I got discharged from the Army and uh after I got this charge uh I uh two weeks later I got baptized in the Apostolic Church in uh in Demi with my brother Michael the pastor there and then uh cuz I had to get baptized in order to marry your grandma Ruth CU she was she was a Christian and I wasn't so after I got baptized on November the 24th we got married in a twoone Arizona and that's how I started my journey as a Christian I didn't come into the message until 1972 because I did not have revelation of the baptism though I did get baptized in the name of of Jesus Christ but because that's what they told me I had to do not that I had Revelation but once I came into the message then I had to get re-baptized again and I got re baptized the third question is when did you accept the message of the hour there was in 1972 uh the one that we used to hear tape of Bernie Garcia we used to go to Silver City and uh we I even used to steal books of brother Brenham from uh your Uncle Mike and I would read a message every time I went to work uh instead of going to to the little house where we ate all the workers in P I would stay in the truck even at night with a nightlight and read a book of brother Brenham me and the founding Pastor Tommy used to go very often maybe sometimes twice a month to Phoenix and get tapes and book from Brother Bernie Garcia which brother Bernie Garcia was our my first tutor for me and uh and your uncle Tommy when did you um meet the founding pastor and when when did you start going to the cedar H Cedar Hills Church of the Cross well the I'm older than the P Pastor by two years so he had to meet me first so we were we were of all my brothers we were seven brothers me and him were the closest you know when we were all in the world I used to be the leader he followed me like my shadow everywhere and we were so close we were B we went slept together in the same bed in hand over when we became Christians and he became Pastor then he was the leader he was the spiritual leader and I followed him until right now what makes you keep on going the Bible says he that end doth Until the End shall be saved this is not a part-time thing this is a uh like when you get married to your wife until until death do we part you know it's until the Lord takes us away I mean so we want to be there you know follow the lord cuz there's no other way there's no other life there's no other Joy I mean what else is there to do I mean but to follow God he lead us all the way to the pro Promised Land you know to me to live is Christ and to die again I love him until you know like brother Ben says he will send me to hell I would still love him my all my love I don't want to lose like say because you have left the first love that first love is the word of God because it's the only thing that will take us out of this world how do you maintain maintain your relationship with the Lord and your brothers and sisters in Christ just being faithful you know the respect that the people have for me is not a gift of God it's a victory you have to earn it you have to earn the respect you know and now at my age you know the people look up to me not because it's because they see that Christ in me that I have been faithful all these years you know so I uh that's why I consecrate myself so because I have to be responsible as I Minister the word that I preach I have to answer to God in that day for what I I teach the people and it's the love that I have for the Lord for the pastor of the church and for the people that I love I can look anybody in the church and tell them that I love them and I mean what is the key to life for you the key to life is my love for the Lord my love for the word when I can hardly wait in the morning when I get up you know I get up I I I just when I hurry to open the Bible to open the message of the hour and study because it's their love that I cu the more that the Lord reveals to me the more I can teach the people and you know they rely a lot on me so uh it's a gift that God uh has me and that's what keeps me going especially after the when the Lord took your grandma away you know what else do I have nothing but the word of God what is this the source of your success I am a I was a nobody you know I was you know the black CH of a family and uh I've done much wrong to come said cheapest of Sinners but God out of nothing you know he made something you know and if I have any success first of all for the life of Jesus Christ the life I have for him that he died on the cross for my sins the love that I have for William Brandon that he brought this message to us the love that I have for my father and mother who were Christians who taught us the things of God my love for for my wife she was a Christian when I knew her you know she kept me in you know uh when I was just starting when I was real weak she was the strong one in the family but she had been she had been a Christian since she was the age of 14 the love of my founding Pastor that he guided me all through these years and now the the love that I have for for Caleb El pastor know I don't look at his age I just look at his experience and I just look God living in that man that's my success my name is Eliza and I had the privilege of interviewing sister damona and this is what I learned she was 22 years old when she came to know the Lord her son seino introduced the Lord to her in between 1989 and 1990 she was baptized by Brother Jimmy in the river at this time she also received the Holy Ghost she received the message of the hour around the same time in the early '90s she would visit the church in Silver City where she met our founding Pastor what keep keeps her going she says that God has taken care of her at all times even through the most difficult ones she says that God has always been her provider and even when she had no money somehow she always found what she needed she never has a spirit of hopelessness she is always persistent and that's her key to life and her source of success comes from God she likes all Christian songs SL hyms her favorite color is pink she loved to cook especially during the holidays her specialty was tamales meno and BOS she doesn't really like Vacations or going out as a mom her advice is to be nice and respect her children advice on being a good Christian is love all your brothers and sisters and respect them as well that was my interview in the nutsh show she wanted to send you all greetings here's a short video video of her sending greetings God bless [Music] you well hello again God bless you my name is Elizabeth and I'm to interview and my first question is um how did you come to know the Lord Jesus hi I came to meet the Lord when I was like around 20 and I was going to the Church of Christ how did that happen uh through a friends that were going to the church I got invited to one other service and from there I I started there and I stayed there for I think maybe a year and then I drifted out out went back outside to the world and then until like around when I was like 27 28 my brother went to Silver City se he moved over there and then he he became um introduced to the message of the the evening and then he he brought it to us you know here at home with their mom that's how we started and then what year were you best baptized and what year did you receive the Holy Ghost oh I don't remember I sure don't remember that but I had a picture but I I couldn't find it and brother um Ray uhuh Ray was the one that baptized me and so would you say that around that same time you accepted a message of the hour or a bit before yes at that time I started and then we just kept on cuz it was fresh meat for me I hadn't listen or heard anything of such where we went before they they preached the gospel but this was was more revealing it it show me more uh hidden mysteries in the Bible yes okay so when did you meet our founding pastor and started attending Cedar Hills Cedar Hills when we went to baptized we got baptized up there in C oh okay and then and so that's kind of like how from yeah tell me all right and then what is it that makes you keep on going just the Lord because there's nothing else you know that's very true there's nothing else you know like the Bible say or the Apostle said where could we go to or who who could we go to when he was saying if you want to leave leave who could we go [Music] to and then how do you maintain your relationship with the Lord Jesus reading and praying and going to church and you know sometimes with the sisters what what would you say is your key of Life key of life is just you know the mentality you know with the Lord you know get him out praying and he's the one that's going to guide you through the day and whatever the situation is going to be he's going to be there regardless and he's the one he's the main goal you know just to because he's the only one that keeps us going okay I would say the same thing I agree with you a lot in that and what what's your favorite song your favorite favorite song oh I love all the songs mostly but I like the one like u k Monte I like that one it's very so you like the fast SS those are those are really nice and your favorite message uh brother Bram brother brandham uh be certain certain I think I I still need to read that so you're certain my God and what's your advice on being a Christian a Christian I would tell you guys the youth you know if you have the spirit you'll have joy peace patience kind this so what year were you baptized and receive the Holy Ghost well he baptized in in December but I don't know the day what what day and what year but for me I baptized in the 19 90 and December the 31st when did you accept the message of the hour 1990 uh he start like uh 92 around there what is it that keeps you guys going like running with the message the thing that kept us going is when I got sick and the Lord talked to her breast cancer M and well they that cancer they ready to split it they told us to spread out they they told us that there 14.9 just one point to against spread over and then that the doctor uh tell us uh they need to send it to ABI to get radiation so in in the time uh we went to to get all the paper together to we can go to our all the time when he they take him to the inside together like exam or whatever they do I'm stay in a little room in the waiting room by the day the the the day that the Lord speaking to me I take a little book The the name is I reading and that Les page I and then when I read that I hear a voice like a sweet voice a sweet I don't know I can explain because for me I hear it right here and then the voice told me don't worry is nothing is there and I I turned around and nobody there so I started reading that little page and still the bottom and when I when I pronounce the I see I hear the voice again and they told me don't worry it's nothing it's nothing there there no cancer and and I'm still like hcha so I read it again and the third time because I'm alone that the third time I reading again that little page and when I when they said they the voice again and they told me he not going to be there so the third time I said okay it is you and I believe and that time he not he not going to yeah they going to church but yes and no was going and then uh after that be before before we we had to go to over King our brother Caleb told us uh tell your husband if they want to my dad pray for for him before you going so I asked I asked him and then he said yes when when they start praying for him in the in the front the more or less the same I hear it the same voice the same words brother Tommy said you don't have cancer you don't have nothing everything is so I believe when I hear that voice and I believe when that brother thy said so we went we went to our Kiki about the second second week he start with a radiation I asked him I tell the doctor why they don't you don't get it was supposed to get 15 minutes R radiation and they start only with six minutes said the doctor said to me he said you don't have any cancer it's only a tumor that we're burning they it yes where where the cancer go got so what keeping us going from there he start to going more and more and then after when he baptized they they told Caleb when you going in fishing I told Caleb I call him at night he say Kaleb say what let's go fishing said where let's go to Emilio's house he said and he asked when did Emilio put fishes in the swimming pool he he stayed with it up there you know he baptized people there this like fishing I remember this is so he baptized and emelia's swimming pool and the night very cold know this is when I became a deacon and it was cold and then it was slimy down there what is your source of success the word this is our our success for Life the first question is like what year you were baptized what year yes or do you kind of like remember when you were baptized and how that went I yeah I remember I remember what year was but I remember the baptism all right well can you kind of like maybe like almost 30 years ago uhhuh and you kind of remember like how it was when you got baptized like how you felt or like uh I remember like how was your walk with God afterwards like did you like how did I feel afterwards yeah like how was your walk like what led you to get baptized what what it to get baptized yes okay it was uh like I started walking you know walking with the Lord I I did the I took the first step you know I took the first step to to walk with the Lord yes that was my first K and I and I got baptized because I believe the message yes like when did you receive the Holy Ghost and oh when did I receive the ho [Music] yes say I would say when I got baptized you know I I I accepted him and I you know I receed him he is the Holy Ghost yes I would say when I got baptized all right and like like before you went like you received the Holy Ghost and everything like did your life change a lot afterward oh things did change my life my life just went B Every Which Way it my life got harder and harder and harder you know it didn't go easy yes I had a lot of Trials a lot of problems but you know and did you having God like and the Holy Spirit in your life like helped you get through those issues how did I get through that like did Having the Holy Spirit and God help you get through those issues oh yes of course I wouldn't have been able to do anything without him yes nothing and what would you like say that you did to help you get through hard times what did I do yes like what would you do when times got hard it [Laughter] all right your question uh no that was that was about it those are the only questions that I [Music] had still you know still struggling and I think it goes on and on and on you know it's never gonna end here yeah we just have to depend on him for everything more and more and more but every day you know they have more tis and you get through them that makes you even stronger yes so just keep on going keep on going you know that's the way it that's the way it is dep for everything it said you get to the point where you can't do anything without him you know nothing God bless you Sister Gloria God bless you brother Sy Martinez yeah um how is your your day today very good um that's right if we could interview you uh for today yes yes um the back the background to this uh is uh is uh we're doing a our youth are doing a project for uh for our church and uh the project is called just older Youth and um it's to appreciate our elders and uh to know about their lives and how they met the Lord and I was wondering if uh if I can ask you some questions yes um how did you come to know the Lord Jesus uh we know that the Lord by the by the message of brother BR through brother Jose B and brother Bern Garcia um what year were you baptized and when did you receive the Holy Ghost in 1979 we were baptized in Mission Texas and Rio grandi and uh do you do you know who who baptized you uh brother Jose pass is which is the brother pass um when did you accept the message of the hour we accept the message in 1979 more or less but we baptized in the same year the end of the year um when did you meet our uh founding pastor and started attending to Cedar Hill Church of the Cross we met him on around 1990 but we started attending with him on Silver City in 1994 um what what makes what makes it that keep you that keep you guys going praying and going to church serving the lord um what how how do you maintain the relationship with the Lord and our brothers and sisters all around the world well praying one another and you know reading the word of God um what is the key to Life free free mo what is the key of what of life well the the real key is the Lord the serving the lord this all we got I um what is the source of your success uh praying together of a family in our house at night you know and and keep going on um what what are your favorite songs only believe I like that Amazing Grace by brother Brandon um what what is your favorite me message of brother BR the serpent see the world is falling apart um what being a Christian what what advice as a husband as a wife a parent a grandparent what what advice would you give well the basic is to go to church keep going to church and pray and pray together and reading the word of God uh talking to your k kids about the Lord or bringing them to church and be faithful to your husbands obey the word all the time so one of the first questions that they gave us uh was how did you all come to know the Lord Jesus how we came yes you want go first okay well I was going to a Pentecostal church uhhuh and and a sister that was in the message started coming to the church and when she mentioned brother brandom being the prophet I said well I want to know more about him and she would you know give me some tape to listen to and books to [Music] read and I lived in Douglas Arizona which is a Border Town next to our Prieta and when I finally left that church we left that church there was a message Church there in a pra and there was another Spanish sister we went to that church and she would interpret for us mhm but then my they brought they brought in that doctor of Two Souls polygamy and the new name of his brother Brandon instead of Jesus well it was it was weird because first the Spanish sister she she got out of the message and then the older one Rosie she moved somewhere and then they closed the smelter and Douglas and we moved to Hurley and that's what started everything you know I had the I found the address for the silver Church in the Yellow Pages so that I started going there and that's it and what year were you baptized and when did you receive the Holy Ghost 19 1987 1987 I started going to the church in silver mhm getting the Holy Ghost well since it's a process i' I'd say mainly after 1995 because I had to get a divorce mhm as soon as I and then later maybe it it's hard to tell because you can't specifically say well there's day in this month because you know you just you're just receiving word upon word it's a process so but when we moved here to Las Cruses MH that's when everything opened up big time Amen to that yeah so we re we really came into the Holy Ghost once we moved here uhhuh and when was that we I think we moved here about 2007 mhm 2008 somewhere around there it's going on 12 years going on 12 years just about yeah somewhere there yeah that's hard hard to believe that yeah cuz we've been married 17 or 18 17 that's close enough and uh when you met our founding pastor and started when did you meet our founding pastor and started attending Cedar Hills Church of the cross that was when you said when you to Sil that's when I met in yeah 1987 yeah and how would you all say that you maintain your relationship with the Lord Jesus and your brothers and sisters in Christ well I guess we pray for each other and when we get an opportunity we we Fellowship you know outside the church you try to talk to people after church you know that that's the only thing I can think of and uh what would you all say is the key to life for you since we're elected to be in this message you know I guess my key would be be being grateful mhm that God could see who I really was and MH you know that I would that I would become a a part of the Bride yes and what would you say is your source of success well now it's my husband you know cuz when I was single I had a hard time especially mhm Financial uhhuh it mostly Financial cuz I I never I'm not a working type person yeah so it was really hard for me to get a decent job or to work around people you know just just having the ministry that we have and the pastor that we have and the and the Holy Ghost all that's the key uhhuh how did you come to know the Lord oh how did I come into the message yeah it was around the early early year the early '70s and we were going uh Tommy Pettis uh senior was the the pastor of the apostolic church and and Chu the consequences and that was the first time that I think uh he uh brother Mike had been talking brother Mike Pettis had been talking to him and he he told him a little bit about the message and and so he he uh shared it with some of us CU not everybody accepted it but he shared it with some of us and uh and uh I think what happened was that that uh he uh he started getting the message and then then you know shared it with us of course and and then we didn't well I personally did not understand it or didn't really know you know if it was true or not and so that night the service was dismissed we went home and and I had a dream that the Lord said spoke to me and said uh do not hesitate to believe what you have heard to be true and so from there on I said oh I want more of this I want to learn more and and then from there I think we we uh we uh left the the church and we started meeting in in in places in different places um do you uh remember the year you were baptized or when you received the Holy Ghost well I'll tell you what I didn't receive the Holy Ghost until after we came into the message because uh I I I was a Baptist and and I didn't of course they didn't know what the Holy Ghost was either so so uh I received it after we came to the message and and uh but when that was what year it was I guess in the early probably the early 80s um do you remember when you accepted the message of the well in the early' 70s early '70s mhm um uh when did you meet the founding pastor and attended Cedar Hills Church of the cross when did I Mee him yes well and Tru the consequences he was uh he was married married to my sister by and and then you know we were we we would visit a lot I would visit them a lot cuz we lived around the same area and and but of course you know he was still the pastor of the apostolic church and and uh so that's when when we met um how do you make maintain your relationship with the Lord and other brothers and sisters from in Christ how do I maintain it yeah I would think by you know staying you know staying in staying as close to the word as I can and and uh I don't know what else um what do you think the key to life is for you for me yeah the key to life for me is serving serving God just serving God with all my heart that's all that I know I've known for the last 40 years all right now these are just more simpler now simple questions um what is your favorite Christian song oh my gosh um I guess I could say my favorite Christian song song is um is uh the song that I sing every once in a while would be thank you Lord for your blessings on me um what is your favorite brother Brown message I don't all of them all of them there's not a message that I don't I could say why I know every Everything cuz I learn every time I hear a message I I I learn something um any advice on for anybody on being a Christian oh my goodness uh uh being a Christian it it just uh giving your whole heart to God you know putting God first in everything and and serving you serving him with with all your heart and to the time that that no nothing else matters how did you come to know the Lord Jesus I was born into a Christian home and attended Rosen Creek Pentecostal church until the age of 16 July the 16th 1970 just before my 17th birthday I was invited by my sister Jeffy who was visiting with us that day to go home with her since it was summer vacation and stay a few days in Gina Louisiana I knew her motive was trying to save me but God was working on both ends he had been dealing with my heart for some time already but somehow I couldn't completely surrender to him somehow I knew I had to make a decision that it was time so I went with her and attended church with her and my other two older siblings who were living there also were also living there at the time they had all recently relocated to Gina because of a a non- denominational church that taught a Doctrine called The Serpent seed and also that you should come out of denomination so the second day I was in Gina was a Sunday and from that time that I entered the door the presence of the Lord surrounded me two young sisters sang a song I'll never forget it and it was called he really cares about you and while they were singing I totally surrendered everything to God my friends the way I dressed my makeup my school even separation from my home and other close family members but I didn't care all I wanted was for God to live inside of me and to serve him with all of my heart my whole life changed instantly and two months later I met my husband brother Tony and 8 months later we were married I had been baptized at a very young age but was re-baptized into the message in 1977 I met brother Tommy in 1977 at brother Nick castile's Church in bar New Mexico but my husband had known the Pettis family since he was a child back in the Apostolic Church it wasn't until 1986 that we started attending Cedar Hills Tabernacle the S the first service we attended was brother Pedro Pet's funeral and since that time we attended we started attended us attending Cedar Hills regularly commuting many years from Lordsburg New Mexico the funeral service was so inspiring for us and the presence of the Lord was so real that my husband told me as we left the parking lot of the church that day that we would be attending Cedar Hills and from then until now we're still here what keeps you going he is Jehovah Jara and he provides all my needs he's my Savior My Healer my guide my counselor my peace my Hiding Place he's everything to me and he keeps me going what is the source of your success I realize that I'm nothing on my own I can't stand alone I depend on him for strength every breath I take I can't face one day without him because he lives I can get through today and I Can Face Tomorrow what's your favorite message of brother brandham I love all the messages of brother brandham but I have really learned a lot from the church Age series I have heard them over and over again could you give some advice on how you're a Christian wife a parent and a grandparent well my advice on being a Christian especially to to the younger generation would be to remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth I believe there is a special blessing when you give your heart to him at a young age I did and I have not even one day one hour or one moment ever regretted my decision or look back oh how the Christian loves to do it he doesn't do it with a a grudge he does it with the feeling that he loves God and he's glad he can do it it's a joy to serve the Lord Jesus it's a joy to sacrifice it's a joy to Worship the Lord It's a joy to be called a fanatic for the kingdom of God's sake it's a joy to take a stand for the right and move from the wrong joy to praise him it's a joy to abstain from the things of the world in their heart it's a perfect limb L all the time God's spirit comes into you and changes your Desir [Music] [Applause]
