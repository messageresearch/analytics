grateful to be here in the book of St John the third chapter and uh grateful to see each and every one of you H happy to God that he has given us this day that he has made for us the Bible says that we should rejoice in it and be glad and rejoice in it tell your neighbor I'm happy that I'm here tonight and really mean it if you would amen amen you heard our pastor I mean it really mean it turn around smile at them just take your time tell them they SM they they uh they smell good something like that they brush teeth they they smell good they smile good and everything of that nature right so nice so nice to to to say something nice to to somebody and so so right away we're going to go to St John the 3 chapter and the 16th verse and uh we're we're we're grateful ful to God for what he has done for us St John the 3rd Chapter and the 16th verse for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life we thank you Father for this day and we're thankful that we have the Breath of Life tonight Lord Jesus we ask father that you will anoint us in a in a way to Mighty way to help your young people and we we trust in you tonight to give us our daily portion in Jesus name we pray amen amen you may be seated to each and every one of you and you look around maybe there's a there's an empty space just just remember that oh brother Freddy brother God's done a miracle in brother Freddy's life amen so every every place that you see that's empty there's an angel sitting there if you can believe that you like the Angel that's sitting right next to you all right all right and and and and you you say how do you know this the Bible says that the angels of God encamp around those that fear Him and so we understand that when the scripture tells us where wherever there's two or three congregated in my name there I am in the midst of them but but in all of this I believe our the subject of our of our of the young people's uh uh theme this year has been or or to this date or from here on in is of whom the world is was not worthy of and and uh you go into Hebrews the 11th chapter and you find out where the Hall of Fame is at you you you go into you can go into the Football Hall of Fame and you can go to the baseball or basketball Hall of Fame but this is our Hall of Fame this is this this is these are our heroes when when you look at at at what a hero is I pray everybody I get everybody's undivided attention when you find a hero you find someone that you look up to someone you want to emulate now I I I was was privileged by God to be able to go into the Town Council of the of Silver City city and and they gave my dad an award November 7th was was declared as thas peris senior day and the re the reason is because of all the work that he had done for humankind they asked they asked me the question or they asked me can you give a little bit of background about him and I simply said this I did not have to go outside of my home to find my heroes My Heroes lived inside my house who I wanted to be like I never wanted to be like any other any other person in the world but my papa never wanted to be like anybody in the world but like my brother and my Theo those are my heroes they live in my own house so when you find out the person that God has called you to be God has also called you to be a hero to somebody it's a hero of the faith you find out like brother Freddy believed so much that now his his he his foot is healed that's a hero of the faith those are the people that will believe God and take him at his word and take God and make the word of God come alive to them in their generation this last week I saw the power of God like I have never experienced it before now now I I've been a Christian since I remember and I've been in church since I remember but but God deals with us at different times and I won't I won't take very much of your time but that's why I want you to capture this God will deal to with you at certain times in where you're at and I saw the spirit of God on Wednesday in gy Colorado it was the Book of Ezekiel all over again when he saw that the presence of God in the pillar of Fire that was infolding in itself now I had I had seen the pillar of fire before I had seen the fire of God drop before but this was all the time that I found myself in the fire and when you find yourself in the presence of God he no longer becomes a historical figure to you you become part of the story because he is then your life that's why John 3:16 has enough power within itself to save the whole world it does it we we we we love all the other scriptures that was there's 800,000 words in the Bible Bible and what great scriptures that there is but this scripture has enough power save the whole world if you will take it to yourself okay Abra AB God so loved who that he gave who that he gave Abraham his only begotten son that if Abraham believeth in him Abraham should not perish but have everlasting life or eternal life when you understand the purpose of what God has called you to now now it is a vast vast thing because the world engulfs us every single day you're coming into Halloween Halloween and Halloween Halloween is actually when the people really get going of who they really are I don't know about about about Las crues but Downtown Silver City on Halloween is the scariest place to be on the planet Silver City and Halloween they have this what is called this Zombie Walk and you don't even want to be caught there so you find out that the real person shows up professional people the whole year long and all Halloween comes around and they put on a mask and they put on the most grotesque things they can ever find God also used masks but the Simplicity of the word of God is this when he comes to live inside of you he changes mask from one to the other but it's not a Halloween mask and it becomes the face of God now we without with understanding when first John tells us first John tells us it ha not yet appeared what we shall be we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him Paul says this now we look through a glass Darkly but then face to face that's what I I I I loved about the message on on Wednesday is because the the the pastor spoke on the encounter or the visitation The pel Experience because that become a face to-face encounter have you ever saw yourself face to face have you ever saw yourself with God face to face have you ever talked to God face to face God so loved me how did he love you he must have known you the Bible talks about predestination it talks about for knowledge it talks about election talks about choosing and all of these words are found in God if we know what God is before there was a world he knew who you were knew who you were before he created the planets he had already elected you chosen you in him the Bible says before the found found of the world so when you come to the understanding God loves me why would God love me God loved me because I was a church member no no the Bible says when we were unlovable how do we understand that do we we think that we are sometimes the best people in the world and we we've never broken a plate and we've never done nothing wrong excuse me we were all born in sined in iniquity to this world speaking Li and unless there is a nature change and there's got to be a nature change young people we can sit in our Pew all day long and we can be here for the rest of our lives and we can sit in a Pew until that day of judgment when it says I don't know you or we can know what he has done for us I don't know about you but what he did on Calvary what he did on that what he did for me is more valuable than any drug it's more valuable than any any feeling it's more valuable to me than anything that the world has to offer you know why God loved me for God so loved the world that he gave me his only begotten son now now in it then you you you you come to the understanding what then do I have to do for him now the prophet of God gives us his story and he gives us his his his his history and he tells us this the morning when I was born he was standing with his they tell me with his hands in the bibs of his overalls he's talking about his dad and a little window on the side of the Hut after I was born a light came into that window settled down where I was it's been with me from that day to this now let me tell you when Christ comes to live inside of you he doesn't come to live inside of you to leave he actually comes to live inside of you to stay do you understand that when God chooses you he chooses to stay the problem is is that we don't choose him to stay and so we start trying to do something else that will fill the void now now on Sunday morning the the pastor is ISE is speaking and I saw a young man when the pastor gave the challenge who will be the face of this generation of this revival nobody called him nobody said come forward he himself in the middle of the service came very respectfully knelt down surrendered his life to the Lord like you had never seen anybody you know why somebody understood the purpose that they were set to Earth for now now now when the Bible says this in Hebrews whereby the children were were were made partakers of flesh and blood in other words before you became Flesh and Blood you were already a child of in other words we as children to on Flesh and Blood took on flesh and blood but we were already children before we took on flesh and blood this is the prophet I'm at home I'm among people I'm among young ladies that I went with in my young days I'm amongst boys here that I played boy boyfriends that I played together I ask you today if you've ever seen me smoke drink or be drunk or defile myself in that way no sir I did not not for my goodness but it's by his Mercy his for he he his foreordained will for me to do this for a while there was a there was a a big movement in the message and they and the movement was this you have to go out in the world to get a testimony and so you had to go do this and this and that and these people would don't go do this and this and that and then come back into church and say the Lord this is my testimony because I didn't have a testimony before well if they were caught in a trap and that happened to them well I I feel bad for them but how about this testimony God kept [Applause] me and especially young girls and young men when you wear your heart on your sleeve and say all this guy is so awesome this girl is so beautiful I think I'll give myself to them you can't get it back there are things you cannot get it back but how about staying here and waiting upon God until the word become the reality to you and gives you the desire of your heart that's a testimony the testimony is how God kept me your testimony is how God has kept you he is faithful in every generation now we we we I was born he says he say I believe that gifts and callings are without repentance how many Christians believe that it's not what you try to work yourself up to it's what you're born to be this is the prophet what were you born to do I was born to be a barber that's how you make money or whatever you do but what were you born to be I was born to be a Son of God I was born to be a preacher and I love to worship God I was born to go to the Nations I was born to rescue people the Bible when Isaiah tells us this the spirit of the Lord is upon you for what purpose to free the captives to find the Brokenhearted set those that are prisoners at Freedom what were you born for well you know my my dad he he works hard in the church and you then the scripture should should be should should read this God so loved my parents God so loved my grandpas God so loved my great grandpas and without the understanding of what he come to do you'll never get to the understanding that God so loved me who am I I am a person you are a person of whom the world is not worthy of you say how can that be by being here tonight you have become a hero of the faith while the people on the outside say will God have a church there are young people that that are are here that can stand to their feet and say I am the face I am the people of God I am a young person that God has chosen I was born in this generation to be the face of the Revival Deuteronomy 33 tells us there is is none like unto the god of Jesu who rideth upon the heaven in thy help and in his Excellency on the sky I wonder if tonight we can all together say there is no God like our God can you say that can you say that young people there's no God like my God there is no God like my God now I don't know what kind of God you serve there are people that serve three Gods but there are people that know who their God is there are people that have been adopted into the family there are people that the revelation of God has come to them there is none like unto the god of Jes when you look on who is jeson it's used in the Tanaka or Hebrew Bible it is generally thought to be derived from a from a root word meaning upright just or straight how is our God any of those things you can always count on who he is he's unchangeable if he saved brother Ross Collins which he did he can save James James he's the same in all generation he's upright he's the same yesterday today and forever if God can save anybody here he can save the other person he can give the person the Holy Ghost how many young people here have never receive the Holy Ghost just raise your hands everybody here got the Holy Ghost thank you everybody else is good have you received the the Holy Holy Ghost you don't know thank you sister if there's a holy ghost that you are Desiring for there's a holy ghost that can fill that desire now we're we're we're we're we're we're just about finished now how many here again have not received the Holy Ghost three four now here we go all right good the rest are good huh we're all good and that's wonderful how many of those that have not received it would like it tonight well you know how many of the older people would like to receive the Holy Ghost don't don't get too excited I want more I want more is there more of him there's more than you can than you can think about brother brandham says it's like this it's like a little fishy in the ocean thinking that he can drink up the whole ocean God wants to give you more than you can ever desire for if you desire the Holy Ghost there is the Holy Ghost here for you all right amen all right he's here at this present time how many would like to come to receive him how many here have never been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ one back there two three four five how many would like to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ anybody here right here wow got one two anybody else God's here three we got some more but we got to understand this God loved me that he gave me and once you get that understanding you're going to love him with all your heart because there is no one like our God I'm here to tell you that he can keep you from all evil that he can keep you from all evil I I I I look at and I say this there was a man in the in the in in the history and the man was about ready to be to be eaten by lion in the Coliseum and when he was about ready to be eaten he said in the name of Jesus stop he was the last martyr in the Roman Coliseum the word of God gives us the power to do this to stop Satan in his tracks it wins every single time I don't know what you need tonight maybe you need the joy of your salvation when was the last time that young people or old people raised up their hands when was the last time that you sang like nobody was looking at you we we we like to sing I I I I I I get a kick out of people clapping her hands like if they're gonna break them like if they're they don't work I love people that Worship the Lord that raise up both hands try it might like it try it you might like it try it try it you might like it this might be a way way of life try it this is something that God has called us to do if you knew that somebody loved you so much would die for you brother Moses what what would you do if he died for you you would owe him your life and whenever you would hear God so loved me I raise up my hand I raise up my voice I say hallelujah praised be to God because there is no God [Applause] like understand this that he is here right now and if
