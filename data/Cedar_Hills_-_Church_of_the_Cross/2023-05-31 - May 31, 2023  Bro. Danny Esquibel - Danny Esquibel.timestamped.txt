[12:32] this desk
[12:36] her best that we can amen
[12:39] man everybody looks so so nice God bless
[12:43] you
[12:46] so let's see
[12:48] let's start off we'll we'll read a
[12:51] John 8. I changed it up on you brother
[12:54] yeah but uh we're going to start with
[12:56] John 8. um
[13:01] 31.
[13:07] right
[13:09] so we can then we'll read this and then
[13:10] you can take your seats
[13:14] and then set Jesus to those Jews which
[13:17] believed on him
[13:19] you continue in my word
[13:22] then are ye my disciples indeed Jesus
[13:34] and you shall know the truth
[13:37] and the truth shall make you free
[13:44] amen
[13:46] and may the Lord add His blessings to
[13:48] the reading of the word
[13:54] the truth
[13:56] you shall know the truth
[13:59] and the truth shall set you free right
[14:06] no
[14:09] okay so you shall know the truth and the
[14:12] truth shall make you free
[14:17] right so how many free people do we have
[14:20] here tonight
[14:22] right so we got quite a few hands this
[14:25] evening
[14:28] how many people that didn't raise your
[14:30] hand want to be made free tonight
[14:34] right okay so we don't have no hands
[14:37] foreign
[14:45] and now the other half that didn't raise
[14:48] their hand
[14:50] said they wanted to be free but they
[14:51] didn't raise their hand that they wanted
[14:52] to be free
[14:56] so let's start let's go with another
[14:59] scripture here
[15:01] and we're going to go to John 4.
[15:05] and we all know the scripture very well
[15:08] right
[15:09] so we're going to start with actually
[15:12] verse 13.
[15:16] and uh so this is Jesus speaking to the
[15:19] woman at the well amen Jesus
[15:22] and so I'm going to read it to you in
[15:24] another version while you follow along
[15:26] there
[15:29] it says then Jesus answered Jesus
[15:33] if you drink from Jacob's Well you will
[15:36] be thirsty again
[15:43] so we gotta stop right there and find
[15:46] out what the word if means
[15:50] right it's just a two-letter word amen
[15:54] so if see
[15:57] is introducing a conditional Clause is
[16:12] right so it's a conditional Clause right
[16:15] if
[16:19] f c
[16:22] it's a conditional Clause
[16:25] right and so you would use the word if
[16:30] in conditional sentence in in France
[16:35] sentences to introduce the circumstance
[16:39] yes in which an event
[16:43] or situation might happen
[16:48] might be happening
[16:52] or it might have happened right
[16:57] but if anyone drinks
[17:01] The Living Water I give them
[17:05] they will never be thirsty again
[17:09] so if you can put that scripture back up
[17:11] so they can read along right
[17:15] uh for they will never be thirsty again
[17:19] for when you drink the water I give you
[17:23] it becomes a gushing Fountain
[17:28] of the Holy Spirit
[17:32] flooding you with endless life
[17:36] right man okay so
[17:40] you know when the woman replies uh let's
[17:42] drink that water so I'll never be
[17:44] thirsty again then
[17:47] you'll sit as
[17:50] that old that I won't have to come back
[17:52] here to draw water
[17:54] Jesus said go get your husband and bring
[17:57] him back here
[17:59] and she says I have no husband right
[18:04] that's true
[18:06] right that's the next verse there
[18:09] and so I'm reading it in this version
[18:12] right for thou has had five husbands but
[18:14] it says here that's true Jesus said
[18:17] or you've been married five times
[18:21] and now you're living with a man who is
[18:23] not your husband
[18:26] you have told the truth
[18:29] right so first of all we got to be
[18:31] truthful
[18:34] you want to be made free tonight
[18:38] then you got to be truthful
[18:41] right nothing happened for this woman
[18:43] here
[18:45] she could have simply said
[18:50] uh she could have said something else
[18:52] other than that she had no husband
[18:55] he could have said he's out of town
[18:59] oh my husband he's not a Believer
[19:03] no but she says I have no husband
[19:06] and Jesus said you have said truth
[19:11] right so you shall know the truth
[19:15] and the truth shall make you free
[19:18] right and Jesus also said Jesus that my
[19:23] words are
[19:25] spiritual and they are live right so how
[19:29] many want to be made free again
[19:33] right okay so not everybody wants to be
[19:35] made free but
[19:37] right because you're going to be made
[19:39] free one way or the other
[19:42] because Satan also has Freedom
[19:46] right we're living in a day and age
[19:50] everybody wants their freedom
[19:53] right nobody wants to be told what to do
[19:57] right uh everybody wants to be free
[20:01] oh I'm free at last
[20:04] the young people young young people
[20:07] nowadays
[20:08] they they say uh when I'm 18.
[20:12] I'm gonna move out of the house I'm
[20:16] gonna go get me an apartment
[20:18] I'm gonna do whatever I want to do
[20:21] I'm gonna be free
[20:24] all right
[20:26] okay okay go ahead
[20:28] but everybody wants their freedom
[20:32] so to be free
[20:34] the definition for free
[20:37] is that you're not under the control is
[20:46] and able to act
[20:50] to act able to act foreign
[21:07] I
[21:12] would be free
[21:14] so you're not
[21:25] so everybody today wants to be made free
[21:28] right
[21:29] they want their freedom
[21:32] but we know that there's only one free
[21:39] and that is in Christ
[21:42] right that's God's Freedom today
[21:46] and the only way to receive that freedom
[21:49] is
[21:51] to have the truth
[21:54] now that's word their truth is
[21:59] something that a lot of people today
[22:01] don't like is mucho is
[22:05] right nobody wants to hear the truth
[22:08] but we know in the scriptures as we've
[22:11] heard
[22:13] that God is seeking
[22:23] so you shall know the truth
[22:26] and the truth shall make you free now
[22:32] we know that
[22:34] worship
[22:37] and spirit and Espiritu right they're
[22:40] all connected into truth right
[22:42] so people say today
[22:45] I worship God
[22:48] right I hear it all the time
[22:51] right everybody claims to be Christians
[22:55] nowadays
[22:57] right everybody's Christian
[22:59] oh I met this guy at the store he's a
[23:02] Christian is
[23:06] I met this guy he wants us to pray for
[23:09] him he's a Christian
[23:11] right so everybody today is Christian
[23:14] right
[23:15] but we all know that a Christian is to
[23:18] be christ-like right
[23:22] and there was only one who came to show
[23:24] us what Christ was amen
[23:28] right so there'll be a lot of so-called
[23:30] Christians
[23:33] well we know
[23:36] so so
[23:40] let's read what brother Brown says here
[23:42] yeah
[23:43] now he's speaking in the message God's
[23:47] provided God's chosen place
[23:52] so now the title of the message is
[24:01] right but if I was to have a third title
[24:06] and take a page out of Brother Jimmy's
[24:09] book right
[24:10] it would be God's chosen place of
[24:14] worship
[24:17] now what does all that have to combine
[24:20] right
[24:22] we want to be made free right
[24:26] okay so now notice
[24:28] brother Brandon here he says the second
[24:31] verse
[24:32] so this is out of God's chosen place of
[24:35] worship
[24:38] paragraph 26 but foreign
[25:39] I want to worship him
[25:42] we all here tonight
[25:46] to worship him we're sitting here
[25:49] tonight
[25:54] Jehovah Witness Christian Science
[25:59] but we're all thinking something
[26:03] we want to know truth
[26:06] the Bible said
[26:09] You shall know the truth
[26:11] and the truth shall make you free
[26:13] somebody
[26:17] again you can't know what you're doing
[26:21] you don't know how to do it
[26:23] until you know how to do it right
[26:30] you know how to do it rather
[26:34] rather entonces you must know what
[26:37] you're doing
[26:39] and how to do it so you might say
[26:44] I'm gonna go to church
[26:50] I'll go over I'll go to church that's
[26:52] fine
[26:54] but unless you know what you're doing
[26:59] you won't know how to go to church
[27:07] what do you mean how to know how to go
[27:08] to church you get in the car you drive
[27:10] to church it is you just think okay
[27:14] and if you don't know how to go to
[27:17] church
[27:19] and why you go to church
[27:22] you won't know what you received
[27:26] when they're preaching
[27:28] you won't know what it's all about
[27:34] you won't know the truth
[27:37] now who wants to come to church
[27:41] in the time that we're living in is
[27:48] right that would be that'd be insane
[27:50] right
[27:51] but you shall know the truth
[27:53] and the truth shall make you free
[27:56] and you won't know how to do it
[27:59] [Music]
[28:01] you must you must know what you're doing
[28:04] and how to do it
[28:07] this shows us that God has a meeting
[28:09] place for his worshipers
[28:15] in one certain place
[28:18] in that place only God meets his
[28:22] worshipers
[28:25] now also the place he has chosen for his
[28:28] worshipers
[28:31] he claimed he would put his name
[28:35] now that's the funny thing about the
[28:38] name
[28:39] right because we hear it so often said
[28:44] wherever two or three are gathered in my
[28:47] name
[28:49] there I am in the midst of them
[28:52] but that's the secret there that is it's
[28:56] the name
[28:58] in el nombre thank you also worship
[29:03] Earth he claimed
[29:07] this shows us that God has a meaning
[29:09] place for his worshipers in one certain
[29:10] place in that place only where God meets
[29:13] his worshipers
[29:17] he claimed he would put his name
[29:20] now let's search out and find through
[29:23] the scriptures
[29:24] where this place is
[29:27] surely if God said he would put his name
[29:30] in this place
[29:33] where he had chosen to meet the people
[29:36] in worship with them
[29:42] or them worship Him
[29:46] that's that it's somewhere in the Bible
[29:49] is
[29:51] for it was all ages
[29:54] and the great unchanging God cannot
[29:57] change
[30:00] man changes
[30:02] but you can put your life upon anything
[30:05] that God ever said at any time
[30:11] because it is
[30:15] for you shall know the truth
[30:17] and the truth shall make you free
[30:23] if you're ever in jail how many have
[30:25] ever been put in jail
[30:32] oh yeah I remember
[30:35] I'll see you my question I remember yeah
[30:37] me and brother Jerry Gonzalez right we
[30:39] stopped at your house
[30:41] put in jail
[30:43] one day I was going to work
[30:45] five o'clock in the morning
[30:48] and got pulled over
[30:51] they put me in jail
[30:56] oh my goodness oh my God
[30:59] right
[31:00] but when you go to jail
[31:02] you can be set free
[31:06] it's like I always say about diets right
[31:10] well say I'm gonna go on a diet
[31:13] oh it's just a set free mentality
[31:17] right you're set free from that Donuts
[31:21] right but that donut will come again and
[31:24] haunt you a little later on down the
[31:25] road
[31:27] right because it's got to be a changing
[31:30] of the mind right
[31:31] it's got to be a changing of your habits
[31:36] or it can be like the doctor will say
[31:39] okay if you don't stop you're gonna die
[31:40] tomorrow right
[31:45] that puts a little uh fire under you
[31:48] right
[31:52] a little problem comes up in the church
[31:55] right that's why you can go to church
[31:58] if you don't know what you're doing just
[32:01] right a little problem will come up in
[32:03] the church
[32:05] I'm not going to church no more oh yeah
[32:09] right
[32:10] I'm gonna I'm not gonna go to church no
[32:13] more
[32:14] right little tiny prong oh my that guy
[32:16] hurt my feelings over there
[32:20] I'm not going to church
[32:23] you shall know the truth and the truth
[32:26] shall make you free
[32:27] now you want to be made free so
[32:33] you know why people don't come to church
[32:36] right because they pick up a morbid
[32:40] Spirit right we heard
[32:42] right it's not for any other reason
[32:45] think about it yeah
[32:48] your feelings hurt
[32:50] based on your emotions
[32:53] right and then all of a sudden you got
[32:55] this spirit that gets a hold of you yeah
[33:00] and morbid meaning to have a disease
[33:05] or the symptoms of a disease right
[33:10] you say oh I got I'm not gonna go I'm
[33:12] just going to leave it to God
[33:15] I'm gonna put it in God's hands
[33:18] right like if God's a magician right
[33:22] right but his word says
[33:25] he has a chosen place
[33:29] where he has chosen to place his name
[33:33] so there's no other healing
[33:37] you're not going to throw it in the laps
[33:39] of
[33:42] God's going to take care of it right my
[33:46] heart is broken
[33:47] my heart is in right but God's going to
[33:51] take care of it well God has a chosen
[33:54] place of worship
[33:56] the place where he meets the worshipers
[34:01] in his words
[34:03] his word is
[34:07] but if we find out
[34:10] that people don't really want to be made
[34:13] free
[34:15] so God has a place
[34:17] where he has placed his name
[34:20] right and we say oh no there we're all
[34:23] Christians
[34:24] no we don't get bad spirits right
[34:30] no no nothing ever gets a hole no no no
[34:33] no talking about nothing ever gets a
[34:35] hold of me
[34:36] you know who I am I've been a disciple
[34:39] for 30 years
[34:42] right so let's find out one time Jesus
[34:46] Jesus he was talking to Peter
[34:49] and the disciples
[34:51] and he the Bible says that he began to
[34:54] talk about his crucifixion
[34:57] and we find it in Matthew 16 21
[35:02] right and so we're going to read it and
[35:04] I'm going to read it in this version
[35:05] here okay
[35:07] from then on Jesus began to clearly
[35:09] reveal to his disciples that he was
[35:11] destined to go to Jerusalem and suffer
[35:12] Injustice
[35:25] he also explained that he would be
[35:27] killed three days later for life again
[35:30] [Music]
[35:35] verse 22 Peter took him aside and
[35:39] representatives
[35:40] to correct him privately
[35:44] he reprimanded Jesus Jesus over and over
[35:51] God forbid Master Senor
[35:54] prepare yourself
[35:57] you must never let this happen to you
[36:02] and right away Jesus recognizes
[36:07] that was the same message
[36:33] because your thoughts
[36:41] and so
[36:51] I'm gonna go help somebody
[36:57] you become a hindrance
[37:01] and his truth
[37:04] people say oh I'm gonna go help this
[37:06] brother
[37:07] well what if that brother
[37:10] needs a heart transplant neces
[37:13] and you're a chiropractor
[37:18] Pedro
[37:37] [Applause]
[38:13] right so you want to be made free
[38:16] only by the truth
[38:19] what is truth
[38:21] did you hear
[38:23] the truth
[38:24] now you can come to church
[38:27] that's great you can hear the prophets
[38:32] that's great we should do that
[38:35] and still not know the truth
[38:39] so I hear tapes every day
[38:44] you still might not know the truth
[38:47] oh but when he reveals himself
[38:51] in his chosen place of worship
[38:55] he Reveals His name
[39:00] so he has a name right he reveals it to
[39:04] you
[39:07] in Galatians 1 15.
[39:10] he said but when they please God is
[39:15] when did it please God
[39:45] he consented to the death of Stephen
[39:48] Madre
[39:58] hey man
[40:00] yes sir but he consented to the death we
[40:04] heard that right
[40:07] and he called me by his grace
[40:12] to be a good church member
[40:15] did he call you here to be a good church
[40:17] member
[40:20] no he called us
[40:22] to reveal his son
[40:25] and each and every one of us
[40:28] it don't do no good
[40:31] brother Branham
[40:45] if he doesn't
[40:48] know himself
[40:54] if he doesn't reveal himself
[40:59] then we're just good church members it
[41:02] doesn't implemented
[41:04] but we shall know the truth
[41:07] and what are we here to do
[41:10] in me that it might preach him amongst
[41:14] the heathen
[41:15] he revealed himself
[41:17] call me by his grace that I might preach
[41:20] amongst things
[41:27] A good sermon on Wednesday
[41:30] we got those a dime a dozen of this
[41:33] right good sermons everywhere
[41:36] right correct
[41:38] to preach A good sermon sermon
[41:42] no the truth no La verdad Jesus said he
[41:46] who hears my words
[41:49] he hears the truth is
[41:53] you hear his words
[41:57] not the words of our pastors but the
[42:01] words of the ministers
[42:04] they're Jesus's words
[42:07] see I am not the light
[42:10] no man is the light
[42:12] Jesus said Jesus my spirit
[42:16] is the oil
[42:18] that lights the candle
[42:21] Jesus is the light Jesus without Jesus
[42:25] we can do nothing
[42:27] but when Jesus lights
[42:36] cannot be here
[42:38] but he wants to reveal himself
[42:42] Iglesia
[43:18] what did Brother Branham do
[43:20] revealed the Mighty God Amen
[43:23] that little girl
[43:25] if Jesus was here
[43:28] right he would lay his hands upon you
[43:32] but in his status
[43:43] but he wants to reveal himself
[43:48] there's only one way
[43:51] right and in John 8 34.
[43:58] Glory
[44:00] Jesus answered verily I say unto you
[44:02] whosoever committed to sin is the
[44:04] servant of sin yes
[44:13] and the servant abideth not in the house
[44:16] forever
[44:17] but the son abideth ever yes
[44:23] right and so brother Brandon says here
[44:28] now there's only one way
[44:31] for you to receive truth
[44:37] brother Brown says I was telling someone
[44:41] this afternoon
[44:44] in a little meeting
[44:46] I said
[44:48] every son that's born of God
[44:53] has to be tried
[44:56] first primero Jason
[45:00] I remember when I had mine
[45:03] do you remember when you had yours
[45:06] he said I remember when I had mine
[45:09] oh my greatest hours
[45:14] when when a man is born again
[45:18] there's a little spot
[45:22] like size of a fingernails
[45:26] that God get yours injects
[45:31] into his system in susiastema
[45:34] okay
[45:36] God does that says
[45:44] cooperate with me
[45:46] hmm
[45:50] for when you're born again
[45:54] there's a little spot the size of a
[45:57] fingernails
[46:00] but you must be proven
[46:04] Luke 22 Lucas
[46:08] verse 31.
[46:17] right so we say oh
[46:20] it's gonna be a Bed of Roses right
[46:34] and I'm reading it in the
[46:37] translation version here
[46:40] Peter my dear friend
[46:44] listen to what I am about to tell you is
[46:48] Satan has obtained permission
[46:53] to come and sift you like wheat
[46:57] and test your faith
[47:01] right
[47:03] he obtained permission
[47:06] so we must be tried
[47:10] but here's Jesus Jesus okay so Jesus is
[47:13] in the garden Jesus is
[47:15] praying is right how many know that he's
[47:18] praying right no
[47:22] where was Jesus given the power
[47:26] Jesus right he says in in John 17 he's
[47:30] saying
[47:32] he says all power was given to me right
[47:38] well was that fulfilled right then and
[47:40] therefore
[47:42] was it fulfilled right then and there
[47:45] no he had to go to the Cross
[47:48] he had to be tried he had to be proven
[47:52] to look as a problem brother Brown says
[47:54] that in injection to his system
[47:57] and it falls into his heart
[48:00] and their anchors
[48:06] makes him prove it
[48:08] you say you're a
[48:11] Christiano Satan satanas make him prove
[48:15] it
[48:17] you say that you're this or that
[48:22] makes him prove it
[48:25] but in the garden
[48:28] Jesus Jesus was praying he said all
[48:32] power has been given to me
[48:34] right but he first had to go to the
[48:37] Cross
[48:38] right he had to be go to the cross and
[48:42] he had to die right and in that
[48:45] scripture there is
[48:47] Jesus says I am no longer in the world
[48:53] no longer in the world
[48:55] the Bible says that he was in The Garden
[48:59] of Gethsemane Elizabeth
[49:01] and he was praying yes and he says I am
[49:05] no longer in the world
[49:09] or was he not in the world no
[49:14] but as he was in the garden
[49:16] he was praying
[49:19] not my will no me volunteer but I will
[49:23] be
[49:24] if at all possible
[49:29] but not my will nevertheless
[49:33] but I will be done
[49:38] I am no longer in the world
[49:45] right he asked the question is
[49:55] you think that the disciples had the
[49:58] answer
[50:00] you think the disciples had the
[50:02] revelation of who Jesus was
[50:07] yes or no
[50:10] right
[50:13] Peter got a revelation right
[50:17] right
[50:19] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[50:21] Living God but you think Peter had a
[50:24] full revelation of who he was was
[50:27] Jesus didn't even have a full revelation
[50:30] of who he was Jesus
[50:35] he said I come from God
[50:37] I go back together he knew that much but
[50:42] when he was in the garden
[50:44] and he said I am no longer in the world
[50:48] what happened he gave up his will he
[50:53] says
[51:00] and he came face to face
[51:08] but he had to give up his will first
[51:32] we have to be proven
[51:35] but they don't
[51:40] John 8 one Ocho
[51:43] 36. didn't they say
[51:57] we want to be made free tonight
[52:04] if the father
[52:10] no right we so much we often repeat this
[52:13] scripture
[52:14] he whom the son had set free okay
[52:20] it's free indeed is no that's not what
[52:24] it says it says see
[52:31] introduce the circumstance
[52:34] in which an event or a situation might
[52:38] happen
[52:40] it might be happening right now
[52:44] it might have already happened
[52:51] therefore
[52:56] you are free indeed
[53:00] wow
[53:02] it says in this version here
[53:05] so if the sun sets you free from sin
[53:10] then become a true son and be
[53:12] unquestionably free
[53:15] um
[53:18] so if the sun sets you free from sin
[53:24] he's gonna set you free
[53:36] so
[53:51] [Applause]
[54:21] by his name or sunombre so he has a
[54:25] place where he has put his name
[54:29] in Galatians 5 1 in galatas it was for
[54:33] Freedom that Christ has made us set us
[54:35] free
[54:39] is it was for Freedom
[54:41] that Christ has set us free okay
[54:44] you shall know the truth and the truth
[54:48] shall make you free
[54:50] if you if you said if see if see there's
[54:55] the condition there is
[54:59] if a man drinks from this well
[55:06] set you free
[55:08] you're no more a slave
[55:12] daughter of God
[55:15] he don't set you free
[56:00] and you become a prisoner
[56:05] now Matthew 16 14 in closing
[56:11] so I like to read this I don't like a
[56:14] lot of other things about this but I
[56:16] like to read these
[56:18] in this version here
[56:23] right so I want to be free
[56:27] then Jesus said to his disciples
[56:30] if you truly want to follow me
[56:34] you should
[56:36] at once completely reject and disown
[56:39] your own life
[56:45] and you must be willing to share my
[56:48] cross
[56:52] and experience it is
[56:55] experience no we're we're in Matthew 16
[56:59] 24.
[57:03] and you must be willing to share my
[57:05] cross and experience it as your own
[57:10] as you continually surrender to my ways
[57:16] I mean for if you choose self-sacrifice
[57:20] foreign
[57:57] is this great news
[57:59] noticias yes I got some great news
[58:02] Jesus loves you
[58:05] Jesus and he wants to make you free
[58:10] Jesus Loves You Jesus and he wants to
[58:14] make you free oh but brother you don't
[58:17] know my life
[58:18] oh I'm I'm this oh this is Jesus loves
[58:23] you and he wants to make you free
[58:26] oh brother but you don't know what
[58:28] happened to me when I was in the past
[58:33] Jesus Loves You Jesus and he wants to
[58:37] make you free
[58:41] but there's some bad news
[58:43] bad news is
[58:46] Jesus Loves You Jesus and he wants to
[58:49] make you free
[58:50] so just as he died
[58:54] you're gonna have to die the same way
[58:59] you shall know the truth and the truth
[59:02] shall make you free
[59:04] if the sun
[59:06] makes you free you are free indeed
[59:11] you might be in jail
[59:14] you might have already been set free
[59:18] but when you're made free
[59:21] actually all you're waiting foreign
[59:49] was a thief
[59:52] it was a thief well guess what
[59:56] you know what the difference is like my
[59:59] daddy used to say all the time
[1:00:02] you know what's the difference between a
[1:00:04] thief in jail
[1:00:09] outside of jail foreign
[1:00:37] right and so he found himself on the
[1:00:41] cross well
[1:00:45] the son Elijah was there hanging on the
[1:00:49] cross
[1:00:50] if thou canceled
[1:00:53] and he said
[1:00:56] I know you'll say that you are you stays
[1:01:00] who you say you are interested is a kiss
[1:01:03] remember me
[1:01:07] remember me
[1:01:09] if the Sun
[1:01:11] hijo
[1:01:15] he says
[1:01:18] you will enter into Paradise
[1:01:24] can you imagine the scene
[1:01:28] Jesus died Jesus right his body goes to
[1:01:31] the great
[1:01:33] his soul Goes to Hell
[1:01:36] the spirit goes back to God right
[1:01:39] right and so
[1:01:43] that beef
[1:01:44] is
[1:02:17] the one who was at the gate
[1:02:22] my name is
