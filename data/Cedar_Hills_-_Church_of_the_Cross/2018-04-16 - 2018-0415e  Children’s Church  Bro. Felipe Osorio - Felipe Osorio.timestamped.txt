[12:14] Egypt to the promised land
[12:15] we all know that right now one of your
[12:18] teachers in Sunday school told me that
[12:21] you guys already know the story of
[12:23] Joshua and Caleb is that right amen amen
[12:31] amen
[12:38] you guys want jumping jacks - okay
[12:43] so let's get our swords let's stand to
[12:46] our feet let's open up our Bibles to the
[12:51] book of numbers numbers 13 chapter 13
[12:57] verse 1 and 2 chapter 13 yes chapter 13
[13:10] verse 1
[13:18] and it says and the Lord and the Lord
[13:21] spake unto Moses saying send out men and
[13:25] that they may research the land of
[13:27] Canaan which I give unto the children of
[13:29] Israel of every tribe of the father of
[13:36] their fathers shall ye sandy man
[13:38] everyone at ruler among them a man close
[13:42] their Bible you be you have permission
[13:44] to be seated so so Moses was meditating
[13:52] he was meditating and the Lord called
[13:54] upon him and he told him to go see the
[13:59] promised land that I promised you the
[14:01] children of Israel now from each tribe
[14:05] he got a man someone raised their hand
[14:08] and tell me how many men were they yes
[14:17] stand to your feet
[14:24] that's exactly right
[14:26] yes there were 12 men at least 12 men
[14:31] they were they were sent to a mission
[14:36] they were a special task force and so
[14:40] these men - what went to their mission
[14:42] and as they went they went to the
[14:45] promised land because Moses had asked
[14:47] them well I need you to do the mission
[14:49] to go see if there's week if they're
[14:51] strong men if there's walls if there's a
[14:54] city if there's water if there's food
[14:56] and you don't know what's over there
[14:58] Moses had a lot of questions so these
[15:01] spies they went to the promised land
[15:05] now next question they brought evidence
[15:10] so they looked at the promise they
[15:13] observe the the they observed the
[15:16] Promised Land right no first question I
[15:22] hope I'm not confusing you guys first
[15:25] question how many days did they scout
[15:28] and spied on the Promised Land
[15:31] raise your hand yes
[15:43] hey no no almost how many days they
[15:50] scouted in the promised land voice
[16:02] no well they scouted the land it's spot
[16:05] on the land for 40 days you're in the
[16:08] land you remember did you guys learned
[16:09] that in Sunday school they spotted the
[16:12] land for 40 days and idly spotted they
[16:16] took evidence to the people back they
[16:19] went back to camp to Moses
[16:21] they took evidence what did they take as
[16:24] evidence raise your hand no no yes but
[16:32] you got to stand up come on soldier
[16:38] you could tell right here come on
[16:42] attention grapes that is exactly right
[16:51] but not any kind of grapes there were
[16:53] big grapes there it was a branch of
[16:56] grapes
[16:56] it was huge so it was so big that they
[16:59] had to put it on a on a stick and two
[17:02] men how to carry it back so that when
[17:04] they went back Moses told Moses saw the
[17:08] grapes all the people saw the grapes and
[17:09] they asked okay well the report what did
[17:12] you guys see what happened and they said
[17:15] well there was honey and milk flowing it
[17:20] sounds pretty good huh honey milk maybe
[17:23] cookies never know right
[17:26] they said there was honey and milk
[17:27] flowing but there was just one problem
[17:29] Moses and the aunt out of the 12 spies
[17:32] the ten were complaining and they said
[17:34] Moses we cannot cannot go to the
[17:37] promised land
[17:38] and Moses said what's what you guys see
[17:42] there are giants there are men of great
[17:45] stature we cannot defeat them yes
[17:55] and only to to knew they could and only
[18:00] to knew they could keep them amen that's
[18:03] right
[18:04] good job that's exactly right
[18:07] but that's why there were ten of them
[18:09] complaining and as they were complaining
[18:13] to Moses Moses hasn't said anything but
[18:16] then like our soldier said two men stood
[18:21] up
[18:23] Caleb raised his hands and said we shall
[18:27] go to the promised land we shall go
[18:30] because it is ours already we will win
[18:34] the battle that's how we soldiers have
[18:37] to face our battles today with the same
[18:39] faith the same courage the Caleb and
[18:43] Joshua had the same courage we need when
[18:45] we go to school when we're traveling
[18:48] when we were in church or at the park we
[18:51] always have to have that faith and so
[18:55] but the people still complained the
[18:57] people cried they murmured they they
[19:00] were sad because they couldn't go
[19:03] against the Giants they were tired
[19:04] because they thought that Aaron and
[19:06] Moses brought brought them to let him
[19:09] die in the land of Canaan so they said
[19:11] you know what Moses
[19:13] we're gonna pick a new leader we're
[19:16] gonna pick a new captain we don't want
[19:18] you anymore
[19:24] do I scare you okay amen and and wait
[19:36] and when forgive me and when Moses Moses
[19:45] just fell down on his feet with Aaron
[19:47] and the Lord came and the Lord's
[19:49] presence appeared and he said the people
[19:54] of Israel I would destroy the people of
[19:56] Israel he was going to destroy the
[19:58] people of Israel but then he said but
[20:02] then Moses cried out say forgive forgive
[20:04] the people and they were forgiven but
[20:07] they had to face the consequences
[20:10] sometimes when we don't obey the Word of
[20:13] God when we don't obey our parents when
[20:16] we don't do what's right
[20:18] that's exactly right soldier they punish
[20:21] us and we have to learn from from our
[20:24] mistakes we have to learn from our
[20:27] mistakes so they were sent for how many
[20:30] years were they sent in the wilderness
[20:32] raise your hand who knows that think for
[20:36] how many years they were sent in the
[20:38] wilderness to die
[20:41] that is correct well done soldier they
[20:47] were sent 40 years to the wilderness to
[20:50] die but Joshua and Caleb how they stood
[20:56] up for the Lord and that they knew what
[20:58] they they were not looking at the Giants
[21:01] they were not looking at the walls
[21:02] they were looking straight at the
[21:04] promise and they knew what they wanted
[21:06] they knew directly what they wanted so
[21:09] that's that's that's what we have to
[21:11] remember now in days that's open right
[21:15] let's let's open our Bibles
[21:23] to the book of mark mark chapter 11
[21:34] verse 24 all right
[21:38] Santa Fe
[21:46] therefore I say unto you what things
[21:49] soever you desire when you pray believe
[21:54] that you receive them and you shall have
[21:58] them amen
[22:00] so remember that's one of the promises
[22:03] that Lord has gave us that we should
[22:05] pray pray but you got to know that that
[22:09] is a promise whenever you pray for it's
[22:12] already yours it's already done
[22:16] so when you're going through
[22:18] I have a testimony myself when when I
[22:23] was younger years ago
[22:29] no I'm just kidding that was last year I
[22:33] was a young boy and I remember I was
[22:41] frustrated I was frustrated I was sad
[22:43] and I always thought when I prayed to
[22:46] the Lord I say the Lord is too busy for
[22:48] me
[22:48] the Lord has so many prayers to answer
[22:50] he doesn't have time for me you wouldn't
[22:53] care I thought to myself so I thought
[22:57] okay I don't need to pray anymore I
[22:59] don't need to hear the God's Word I
[23:02] don't need to hear his message I said
[23:05] that terrible it was consequences for
[23:08] that and and when you feel lonely and
[23:11] when you feel scared and you don't know
[23:13] what to do and it's okay to be afraid
[23:15] because we are humans and when you feel
[23:17] scared you start searching other places
[23:20] you start searching other friends
[23:23] friends that are there that don't even
[23:25] believe this will beautiful word and you
[23:28] talk to them and oh and I'll tell you
[23:30] what your friends out there in school
[23:34] they're not gonna care about your
[23:35] spiritual life they're not going to care
[23:37] about your relationship with God that
[23:40] comes to you that comes to you when I
[23:43] realized when I went to these people
[23:45] when I when I when I went to other
[23:47] friends when I went to these influences
[23:49] I looked back it was far away I was far
[23:56] away
[24:00] so just don't cry I was far away from
[24:06] the Lord and the Lord had yeah promised
[24:13] me he already had promised me he
[24:16] promised me that I will be fine he
[24:19] promised me no matter where I am with
[24:21] fear he always will be by my side always
[24:29] amen that's my that's my testimony and
[24:34] the Lord brought me to his feet and
[24:37] children when you feel afraid don't be
[24:40] afraid to talk the way the Lord now the
[24:42] way the Lord brought me close to him he
[24:45] didn't just brought me close to him he
[24:47] brought me through my parents I spoke to
[24:51] my parents my parents came to me
[24:53] remember your parents are not there just
[24:56] to spank you or just to ground you
[24:58] although they do you know but remember
[25:02] they loved you so much when you feel
[25:04] insecure about something or you feel
[25:06] lonely go to your parents talk about it
[25:10] with your parents don't be afraid don't
[25:12] go to your friends to school
[25:14] don't go anywhere else all your parents
[25:17] want is the best for you best amen
[25:23] that's right so don't be afraid don't be
[25:27] afraid to speak with your parents don't
[25:29] be don't be don't be afraid now
[25:32] sometimes we feel alone and scared and
[25:34] we don't know what to do speak with your
[25:36] parents or speak with your pasture go to
[25:38] straight to your pastor your parents
[25:39] don't be afraid that the Lord is always
[25:42] gonna be by your side and always
