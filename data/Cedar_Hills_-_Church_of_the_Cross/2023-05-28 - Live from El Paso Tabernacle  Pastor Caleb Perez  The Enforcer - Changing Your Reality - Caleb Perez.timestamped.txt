[55:16] Jesus Christ
[55:26] for the confidence to permit us to
[55:29] preach and to use this sacred desk
[55:33] is
[55:42] after hearing those the two fine
[55:45] messages
[55:50] God bless you for for letting the Lord
[55:53] use it
[55:55] I can give one to the Lord Jesus
[56:00] wow wonderful
[56:04] foreign
[57:04] anyone that's here
[57:06] as long as one person is blessed and
[57:08] helped that's all we want
[57:11] us
[57:15] so in the message that that uh this is
[57:19] the unfailing realities of the Living
[57:21] God
[57:23] brother Branham we know those you that
[57:26] have heard the message brother Branham
[57:27] uses the scripture John chapter 4.
[57:33] and in there of course it's the woman at
[57:35] the well
[57:37] and my goodness you could go so many
[57:40] ways with this message
[57:44] and but here we find in John chapter 4
[57:47] if you can turn to it
[57:51] on the 23rd let's let's just read the
[57:54] 23rd and the 24th verse
[58:01] when you have it you can say Amen
[58:12] now we already know the story yeah
[58:17] so we are seeing a woman
[58:20] her reality is is not a very good
[58:23] reality
[58:26] maybe all the bad decisions she made in
[58:30] life
[58:33] not a very good reality
[58:36] but all of a sudden she meets up with a
[58:39] man
[58:42] that she realizes is more than a man
[58:46] is
[58:48] the god man it is the god Prophet is
[58:53] you know we know the the conversation
[58:56] that went on
[58:59] but it comes down to worship
[59:04] and so let's let's read the 23rd and the
[59:07] 24th verse
[59:10] and it says but the hour cometh
[59:17] when the true worshipers shall worship
[59:20] the father in spirit and in truth
[59:28] for the father's seeketh such to worship
[59:32] Him
[59:36] is a spirit
[59:39] can you repeat that
[59:45] and they that worship Him
[59:48] must worship Him in spirit and in truth
[59:54] if you worship only in spirit
[59:58] you don't have a complete reality
[1:00:01] if you worship just in truth
[1:00:04] your reality is not unfailing
[1:00:08] but when you can worship in spirit and
[1:00:12] in truth
[1:00:36] now as I look into the audience tonight
[1:00:41] I see a lot of people
[1:00:44] and each one of you is living a certain
[1:00:47] reality
[1:00:50] I believe tonight
[1:00:52] that the Lord Jesus is about to do
[1:00:57] something
[1:00:58] that's going to rock our world
[1:01:02] you see because the Lord Jesus
[1:01:05] the Bible says is the same yesterday
[1:01:09] today and foreign
[1:01:12] cannot leave when brother Branham left
[1:01:15] the scene
[1:01:18] am I talking to anyone tonight
[1:01:21] I'm going to say it again he did not
[1:01:24] leave
[1:01:25] and the prophet of God left the scene
[1:01:29] nor did he leave when brother Tommy left
[1:01:33] the scene
[1:01:35] but he's the same just as much today
[1:01:40] brother says in every detail
[1:01:44] except the literal Corporal body
[1:01:49] now I believe that there are going to be
[1:01:53] realities that are going to change
[1:01:54] tonight
[1:01:57] and I want to know is there anyone here
[1:02:00] that can be honest
[1:02:02] I can raise your hand and say I need a
[1:02:05] change in my reality
[1:02:09] let me see your hands
[1:02:12] you see because we as humans
[1:02:15] we're getting through these routines
[1:02:19] and we go to church and after a while
[1:02:24] what am I getting out of this
[1:02:28] and we go home and it just seems to be
[1:02:31] the same routine
[1:02:34] and we go to work
[1:02:36] and then sometimes we ask this is there
[1:02:40] must be more to this than what is going
[1:02:43] on in my life
[1:02:46] I believe he's about to change some
[1:02:49] reality
[1:02:52] when we ask the question and we say well
[1:02:55] what is my reality
[1:02:58] an older person can say well is this all
[1:03:02] there is to life
[1:03:06] the younger maybe will say well I just
[1:03:09] want to have a good time
[1:03:12] those and many people think because as I
[1:03:15] said that that they've made some bad
[1:03:17] mistakes
[1:03:20] some bad choices
[1:03:22] that they have to stay a prisoner to
[1:03:25] their reality
[1:03:29] but I'm here to tell you tonight
[1:03:32] you don't have to stay a prisoner to
[1:03:35] your reality
[1:03:38] I want you to turn to your neighbor and
[1:03:40] tell your neighbor
[1:03:44] you don't have to stay a prisoner
[1:03:48] to your reality
[1:03:51] tell your neighbor neighbor I want my
[1:03:53] reality to change tonight
[1:04:01] I I don't know if you if you believe me
[1:04:04] or not
[1:04:05] I'm gonna say it again there's gonna be
[1:04:08] some realities that are changed tonight
[1:04:12] and my question is is it your reality or
[1:04:16] is it yours or who's reality
[1:04:22] I mean I want to talk to Believers
[1:04:24] tonight
[1:04:26] how many believers do we got here
[1:04:29] now what I'm trying to do is raise your
[1:04:33] faith
[1:04:34] to show that it is possible
[1:04:38] for your reality to change
[1:04:41] things gotta change tonight
[1:04:45] because the faith or what we claim we
[1:04:48] have
[1:04:49] sometimes doesn't seem like it's enough
[1:04:54] Something's Gotta change come on now we
[1:04:57] gotta get out of our routine
[1:05:08] we're going to get to that in a moment
[1:05:11] but as we talk about the Holy Ghost
[1:05:14] how many of you have the Holy ghosts
[1:05:17] the Holy Ghost is the enforcer it is
[1:05:38] [Applause]
[1:05:58] but the Holy Ghost is not in his office
[1:06:03] unless he comes and dwells in someone
[1:06:08] hello everybody you've got to come and
[1:06:11] dwell in someone
[1:06:13] it is a vessel to use
[1:06:16] therefore when he comes in the Believers
[1:06:20] the believer then becomes an enforcer of
[1:06:24] the claims
[1:06:26] so my question is tonight
[1:06:29] how many of you are enforcers
[1:06:36] oh oh yeah
[1:06:39] okay how many of you have the Holy
[1:06:40] ghosts
[1:06:48] let me ask you a question again
[1:06:51] how many of you have the Holy Ghost
[1:06:54] because we may have to change our
[1:06:57] subject
[1:06:58] and talk about receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:07:01] yeah
[1:07:02] we can't go on if we if if if we're not
[1:07:06] fulfilling this part first
[1:07:08] how many of you have the Holy Ghost
[1:07:12] then how many of you are enforcers
[1:07:19] wait wait a minute I'm sorry there's a
[1:07:22] disconnect here
[1:07:24] there's a disconnected
[1:07:30] because the number of people that raise
[1:07:32] their hands that they have the Holy
[1:07:34] ghosts
[1:07:36] so the number of people that say uh that
[1:07:39] that say if I asked are you do you are
[1:07:42] you an enforceros
[1:07:51] Santo okay
[1:07:54] how many are enforcers
[1:07:57] you can't have the Holy Ghost and not be
[1:07:59] an enforcer no president Elizabeth
[1:08:06] okay we gotta we gotta settle this
[1:08:09] before we get into it
[1:08:12] you've got to go God's provided
[1:08:17] the problem is is that people want to go
[1:08:19] their way
[1:08:21] because we live in a day and age
[1:08:24] as we were hearing this morning
[1:08:27] our young people have it 10 times worse
[1:08:31] than we did
[1:08:34] and we live in a world
[1:08:37] that people are constantly saying
[1:08:41] you've got to manifest your own reality
[1:08:48] anybody heard that um
[1:08:51] you haven't been living under a rock or
[1:08:53] something
[1:08:54] how many hear that
[1:08:59] this is my reality is
[1:09:05] this is my truth
[1:09:08] hello young people hola Joven is I feel
[1:09:12] for you all
[1:09:13] because uh that's all there is out there
[1:09:19] now nobody knows what a woman is
[1:09:27] nobody knows if they're a man
[1:09:34] oh come on
[1:09:35] well this is my reality
[1:09:39] that's right and we're gonna go to hell
[1:09:41] with our realities
[1:09:51] because you cannot meet the challenge of
[1:09:54] the day
[1:09:55] you can't meet the challenge of the hour
[1:10:00] if you have the reality of the world
[1:10:04] now your reality has gotta change
[1:10:08] there's no way you'll meet the
[1:10:10] challenges that are out
[1:10:13] so that's why we're here tonight
[1:10:19] they say listen you got to manifest your
[1:10:23] own reality
[1:10:26] positive thinking
[1:10:32] oh come on I'm dead I I gotta say all
[1:10:35] this before I get into this yes
[1:10:37] I got to make sure that you all are with
[1:10:40] me here yeah
[1:10:41] positive thinking right
[1:10:44] nothing wrong with positive thinking
[1:10:47] about negative thinking
[1:10:49] the problem is is that you're trusting
[1:10:52] in your positive thinking
[1:10:54] and if you're not born again
[1:10:57] then even though you have a positive
[1:11:00] thinking
[1:11:02] your reality is flawed
[1:11:09] well my professor told me that
[1:11:12] um
[1:11:16] hello hola
[1:11:20] Suave man
[1:11:24] oh my teacher told me that I'm in my ass
[1:11:27] wonderful are they born again or not
[1:11:30] um
[1:11:33] do they have the Holy Ghost spirit to
[1:11:36] Santa then they're trying to enforce
[1:11:38] something on you
[1:11:40] that if you don't watch it
[1:11:43] your reality becomes influenced
[1:11:47] ah here's the woman at the well
[1:11:51] she had made many a mistakes
[1:11:55] she had made choices that that she
[1:11:58] shouldn't have made decisions

[1:12:05] you've had five husbands
[1:12:10] so it's not even yours what
[1:12:21] [Applause]
[1:12:57] and I would give you living water

[1:13:28] he said come on seek first
[1:13:31] kingdom of God and it's righteousness
[1:13:35] and all these other things will be
[1:13:38] attitude
[1:13:43] what part of that reality don't you
[1:13:45] understand this
[1:13:47] listen
[1:13:49] this is my reality my truth
[1:13:53] and the sad thing about it is
[1:13:56] that same way of thinking yes
[1:13:59] has infiltrated the churches
[1:14:06] oh
[1:14:07] I'm letting that settle for a moment for
[1:14:10] for a reason now
[1:14:13] we don't need a pastor no more yeah
[1:14:19] oh
[1:14:20] come on church I'm the league yeah that
[1:14:23] is a failing reality
[1:14:26] that is not the unfailing reality of a
[1:14:30] living God
[1:14:34] it's not no Lewis hello hola you begin
[1:14:38] to form your little ideas or your your
[1:14:41] little ideology
[1:14:45] and your truth becomes warped it is
[1:14:50] I don't need
[1:14:53] propheta
[1:14:58] oh I I I believe in the prophet
[1:15:02] but we don't need a fight for Ministry
[1:15:04] ministerio
[1:15:09] oh come on Angeline you know what I'm
[1:15:11] talking about
[1:15:13] what's out there
[1:15:15] and a lot of people have a reality
[1:15:18] that's warped
[1:15:22] it's a reality that's been tampered with
[1:15:30] an image
[1:15:32] I don't know if you how many of you
[1:15:34] believe me
[1:15:38] [Music]
[1:15:41] watch now
[1:15:43] while I'm preaching
[1:15:46] you check yourself
[1:15:48] let every man examine himself
[1:15:52] you got to do that today because
[1:15:55] realities are changing
[1:15:58] what's true for me
[1:16:02] or what is true to me
[1:16:04] I'm based on my own understanding and
[1:16:08] experiences
[1:16:12] truth to those things
[1:16:14] you see when you talk about truth and
[1:16:17] reality
[1:16:20] the first thing you got to know is that
[1:16:22] is your reality subjective or objective
[1:16:30] come on now I I want you to see this
[1:16:33] because people are blinded to things
[1:16:37] I I have to put this now I gotta I gotta
[1:16:40] say this
[1:16:41] a subjective reality
[1:16:45] says that something is actual
[1:16:50] depending on my mind
[1:16:54] come on now it's dependent on my mind
[1:16:57] it's the inner world of my mind my
[1:17:01] thoughts
[1:17:04] it's the world of emotions it's
[1:17:09] the world of feelings
[1:17:12] that compose our thoughts okay
[1:17:16] opinions judgments
[1:17:20] influences
[1:17:49] YouTube YouTube you can learn anything
[1:17:53] on YouTube
[1:17:56] that's right it's got some good things
[1:17:59] yeah
[1:18:00] but it's got some bad things
[1:18:03] part of the tree of knowledge of Good
[1:18:05] and Evil yes
[1:18:09] but you can see how far
[1:18:14] the reality is
[1:18:17] because it's been tainted
[1:18:21] with man-made ideologies
[1:18:25] religions and beliefs
[1:18:32] the problem is is that we try to use
[1:18:34] that to approach God no problem is
[1:18:45] and form their own Fashions and their
[1:18:49] truths foreign
[1:18:57] but the problem is this
[1:19:00] after they tell you what they claim that
[1:19:02] they believe
[1:19:06] I'm hitting home with you young people
[1:19:10] because after they tell you oh this is
[1:19:13] what you should do this
[1:19:17] it is
[1:19:20] am I talking to anybody here
[1:19:24] enough
[1:19:25] time yeah all right
[1:19:29] just be yourself
[1:19:31] but notice the people that tell you that
[1:19:34] is
[1:19:35] they have to use drugs
[1:19:38] because they don't like the reality
[1:19:41] they've created
[1:19:45] and so they're trying to get you to come
[1:19:48] to the same reality
[1:19:51] and then they can't function without
[1:19:54] CBD
[1:20:00] did I say that out loud
[1:20:07] that one didn't go over very good yeah
[1:20:11] you wonder huh
[1:20:13] we better change our realities
[1:20:17] so they began to use drugs and alcohol
[1:20:22] and alcohol go to porn
[1:20:25] all these things so this has caused us
[1:20:28] because they're trying to get away from
[1:20:30] their reality
[1:20:33] they're looking for a way of escape
[1:20:37] and then they'll turn even to a virtual
[1:20:41] reality
[1:20:43] oh this is your generation
[1:20:46] they go now to a virtual reality
[1:20:50] because in the virtual reality
[1:20:53] you can act like God
[1:20:56] you can control everything you can
[1:21:00] create your own environment
[1:21:02] your own atmosphere there yeah and it's
[1:21:05] a way to get away a way to escape your
[1:21:09] reality
[1:21:11] but yet God gives you something far
[1:21:13] greater
[1:21:15] who gives you his holy spirit
[1:21:44] and he wants to give it to you
[1:21:48] [Music]
[1:21:53] okay we're barely getting warmed up now
[1:21:55] okay
[1:22:00] they never realize that's their
[1:22:03] subjective reality
[1:22:06] has been influenced
[1:22:10] and there are so many influences
[1:22:14] everywhere you turn
[1:22:17] whether it's a woke
[1:22:22] whether it's cancel culture
[1:22:25] oh it's even in religion is
[1:22:30] Mama come on we can become churches
[1:22:37] that's my reality
[1:22:40] wonderful
[1:22:42] Church doesn't equal unfailing realities
[1:22:52] uh I go to church
[1:22:54] the devil's here before you and yeah
[1:22:59] okay okay
[1:23:03] oh
[1:23:08] but there and there is an objective
[1:23:11] truth
[1:23:13] an objective reality
[1:23:17] that is not based or influenced
[1:23:21] by your personal feelings or emotions
[1:23:27] it's not influenced by what the world
[1:23:30] says
[1:23:32] what the church says
[1:23:34] it is the reality
[1:23:36] no matter if people realize it or not
[1:23:41] accept it or not he'll accept us or no
[1:23:44] God is God
[1:23:46] and there's nothing whether you feel
[1:23:48] good or bad it doesn't influence
[1:23:52] it is an objective truth is
[1:23:59] an objective truth
[1:24:01] whether you accept it or not or Jesus
[1:24:05] that God has placed in the church
[1:24:08] foreign
[1:25:03] what happened
[1:25:05] your reality was influenced by your
[1:25:08] feelings
[1:25:11] that's why the Bible says that those
[1:25:14] that are led by the spirit of God
[1:25:18] they are the sons of God
[1:25:20] not those that are led by emotions
[1:25:25] those that are led by the spirit
[1:25:28] today they are the sons of God
[1:25:32] now watch this now it takes somebody
[1:25:35] with a holy ghost
[1:25:37] to begin to enforce the claims

[1:40:40] was his reality
[1:40:43] to follow the footsteps of his Earthly
[1:40:45] father

[1:43:31] interpreter
[1:43:34] or a revealer of the word

[1:43:55] the word comes to the propheta
[1:44:00] foreign
[1:44:39] now in the first seal here's
[1:44:47] here's what the prophet of God says
[1:44:51] when the first seal was opened
