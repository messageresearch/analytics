[14:37] amen
[14:39] good morning buenos dias
[14:42] it's certainly
[14:43] good to be
[14:44] in the house of the lord this morning
[14:49] welcome each one that is with us this
[14:52] morning
[14:57] and we pray that you feel at home in the
[14:59] house of the lord
[15:04] we
[15:07] are grateful to god
[15:11] for all that
[15:12] he has done for us
[15:16] and truly it is amazing grace
[15:20] gracia
[15:21] for
[15:22] the last weeks or so
[15:29] my thought has been the grace of god
[15:36] and
[15:38] last wednesday miraculous pasado i
[15:41] was going to start teaching on the grace
[15:44] of god
[15:47] and
[15:49] i was
[15:51] a little troubled wednesday
[15:54] a lot of hassle and been moving and what
[15:58] have you trying to find a home and what
[15:59] have you
[16:00] done
[16:03] and
[16:04] that wednesday was when brother alex
[16:06] burunda came to my home in the evening
[16:12] now i had told certain people in this
[16:15] church that i was going to preach on the
[16:17] grace of god
[16:34] because i knew
[16:36] and i know that it's a holy spirit
[16:38] leading yo
[16:41] when you can have that kind of
[16:43] fellowship
[16:47] and the other one doesn't know from the
[16:50] other by lip what you're going to do
[16:55] and leave it to the holy spirit
[16:59] what a grand thing it is
[17:01] i like to there there is
[17:04] no possible way ninguna manera posible
[17:08] that i
[17:09] can finish and maybe when i say i
[17:11] finished
[17:12] i pray that i could just at least open
[17:14] up a little bit of what grace is
[17:21] and
[17:22] i'm going to restrict myself
[17:26] restriction and mimism it's almost 10
[17:29] 30.
[17:30] i'm going to restrict myself to an hour
[17:32] and 15 minutes
[17:36] and
[17:37] i'd like to maybe wednesday continue
[17:40] this thought
[17:43] i'd like for you to open your bibles
[17:44] with me to the prophet zechariah
[17:50] chapter four
[17:53] to you that don't know how to handle
[17:54] your bible very good
[17:57] zechariah second to the last book of the
[18:00] old testament before the gospel of saint
[18:02] matthew
[18:04] yes
[18:10] that's the book of zechariah
[18:14] now
[18:16] in zechariah 4 zacharias cuatro and
[18:19] verse 6 versiclos says
[18:24] we're going to read six and seven says
[18:28] amen
[18:30] if you have it say amen
[18:33] then he answered
[18:35] and spake unto me saying
[18:38] this is the word of the lord unto zero
[18:42] babel
[18:43] saying
[18:44] not by might
[18:46] zechariah 4 6
[18:48] not by might
[18:50] nor by power
[18:53] but my but by my spirit saith the lord
[18:56] of hosts
[19:14] who art thou
[19:16] o great mountain
[19:18] before zerubbabel
[19:20] thou shall become a plain and he shall
[19:24] bring forth the headstone
[19:27] thereof with shoutings
[19:30] crying
[19:31] grace
[19:32] grace
[19:34] unto it
[19:45] now turn in your bibles to
[19:48] the book of revelation chapter 12
[19:52] apocalypses
[19:54] and we'll read verse 1
[20:01] and there appeared a great wonder in
[20:04] heaven a woman clothed with the sun
[20:09] and the moon under her feet
[20:11] and upon her head a crown of twelve
[20:13] stars
[20:29] there was a time when
[20:31] this third minister met this man down
[20:34] the street
[20:40] and he asked him the question
[20:43] do you know grace
[20:44] gracia
[20:46] and
[20:47] of course if somebody would know would
[20:49] say it on here
[20:52] i said would you know grace
[20:56] i said i know gracie
[21:03] matthew but that's not the grace we're
[21:05] speaking about
[21:07] he said grace who
[21:09] gracia
[21:11] he said the grace of god
[21:14] i believe
[21:29] creo that the message of grace
[21:33] is one of the most misunderstood
[21:35] messages
[21:36] in the world
[21:40] the people
[21:42] have taken grace
[21:45] and have made a disgrace out of it
[21:50] and
[21:51] in grace in la gracia you find
[21:55] and we find schools of thought and
[21:58] control escuelas de pensamiento
[22:01] you hear people
[22:03] speak
[22:04] in like manner
[22:07] and they say
[22:08] i'm saved by grace this is so
[22:09] established
[22:21] too many people
[22:23] to do anything they want to but i
[22:45] i have a picture of
[22:47] the great mountain
[22:51] which is in the form of a pyramid
[22:55] we find that the top part of it
[23:00] is the headstone
[23:03] and the prophet of god teaches us
[23:16] he says that grace and love are twin
[23:19] sisters this is
[23:24] there was a song when i was growing up
[23:29] it went something like this
[23:31] love and marriage
[23:34] go together like a horse and carriage
[23:39] you can have one without the other one
[23:44] so
[23:45] love elamor and grace
[24:03] amen amen so then
[24:05] uh i believe
[24:07] when we we speak about the grace
[24:12] it's quite a context
[24:14] let me define to you first because i do
[24:17] not want to run through this message
[24:21] and i want to teach it
[24:24] now
[24:25] we know that teaching
[24:28] positions the church
[24:44] whatever i can teach
[24:46] you
[24:48] the word grace
[24:51] means mercy or cl and clemency
[24:57] the unmerited love
[25:00] amor sin mercer and favor if a war of
[25:04] god the diors toward man
[25:08] to honor
[25:10] to dignify
[25:13] in other words
[25:15] if we have his grace
[25:19] we have the unmerited love and favor of
[25:24] god
[25:35] that's why sometimes they call them
[25:37] reverend
[25:39] or sirs is this the time
[25:42] or the lady
[25:45] the chosen or the elected lady
[25:48] called the woman
[25:50] she's called a lady
[25:53] because she's honored
[25:55] she is dignified
[25:57] god has found favor in her eyes
[26:01] it's unmerited
[26:04] means that there's nothing you can do
[26:07] so if you stop right there sit at the
[26:10] gym
[26:11] you can go home
[26:13] and say praise god
[26:16] there's nothing i can do
[26:18] i'm gonna sit back
[26:20] i'm gonna relax
[26:36] but this is love foreign and they're
[26:38] twin sisters
[26:40] amen amen so then
[26:43] says let us
[26:45] come down
[26:47] to the bottom
[26:49] and let's talk vamos
[27:04] let us not try to put an act
[27:09] there are days ideas when we feel
[27:12] discouraged
[27:15] uh
[27:18] the
[27:19] amen
[27:21] and the reason for it
[27:24] is because
[27:26] we read the word
[27:30] when you take these books
[27:34] and you take
[27:36] the bible
[27:37] and you read it
[27:41] it makes you rejoice at times
[27:44] and there are times when we read the
[27:46] bible
[27:48] and we read the spoken word
[27:51] it won't make us rejoice
[27:54] but
[27:55] there are times when we are reading a
[27:58] book
[28:00] or hearing a table
[28:02] that
[28:03] we want to turn it off right away
[28:07] and the reason for it
[28:10] because it's heavy
[28:12] there are things there is that we are
[28:15] doing wrong
[28:18] and
[28:18] it hits us nos vega and
[28:22] when you get up
[28:24] you might take a little walk
[28:26] on the pocono that's why people are very
[28:28] nervous
[28:33] i i wonder i wonder sometimes what makes
[28:37] us so nervous
[28:40] we sometimes can't
[28:56] we're at home
[29:06] and it's the same thing all over again
[29:09] it's because
[29:25] i'll go hey there there's something
[29:27] bothering them
[29:28] so they make a joke out of it
[29:31] and that's that's
[29:32] that's fine
[29:34] but but what we're trying to get to
[29:37] i'm trying to help you locate your
[29:40] problem
[29:42] under the message of grace
[29:45] we feel discouraged
[29:52] but we are not fulfilling that
[29:56] we are very ungrateful
[30:00] uh and to what we have received
[30:04] we do not appreciate no
[30:18] we walk sometimes thinking we are
[30:31] any people don't worship the way i
[30:33] worship
[30:48] so who
[31:01] it's to pretend to be something that
[31:04] we're not
[31:06] it's a fraud
[31:09] pretense
[31:11] and the church in general has gone into
[31:14] what is called a sham
[31:27] of what the word of god has for us
[31:43] go to church iglesia to soothe a
[31:46] conscience
[31:48] but they will never let their conscience
[31:52] show them.
[31:56] there comes a time
[31:58] when a
[32:08] you don't need for nobody to tell you
[32:10] when you're doing wrong
[32:25] god is greater than your conscience
[32:30] god is in his word
[32:32] so you pick up the bible
[32:35] you pick up a book
[32:36] you begin to read
[32:38] that's greater than your conscience
[33:20] is
[33:36] yourself
[33:50] it is
[34:03] amen
[34:04] and uh we hear people
[34:07] praise god
[34:09] there's nothing i can do
[34:11] god did it all for me
[34:13] that's right
[34:18] pero
[34:26] [Music]
[34:28] will have your life sanctified
[34:30] typical
[34:32] grace gracia we'll show you how to do it
[34:37] that's his grace
[34:39] if you did something wrong
[34:42] and nobody ever told you you did wrong
[34:46] you never knew you did nothing wrong
[34:51] that's because nobody loved you
[34:53] especially
[34:56] the children
[34:59] that do wrong hyacinth
[35:13] amen
[35:14] feeling discouraged
[35:18] it's good to feel discouraged
[35:21] it's good to feel uneasy
[35:24] it's good to have tension
[35:28] because if you didn't have any tension
[35:29] in life
[35:31] everything would be all right
[35:34] amen amen
[35:36] at times our bases we don't know what we
[35:39] have no look tenemos we really don't
[35:41] know what we have no s
[36:04] and
[36:07] people say well everything's all right
[36:15] and
[36:16] i hope you can put on your seat belts
[36:17] this morning
[36:21] because it's
[36:23] it's something winning
[36:27] how many like to jump and shout out
[36:38] but a lot of times muchas versus we jump
[36:42] and shout drink
[36:45] louder and higher than we live
[36:51] we go into what is called
[37:01] you can have a person come to church
[37:05] jump and shout okay
[37:20] because the people that don't like to
[37:22] jump and shout
[37:23] out
[37:24] we'll use this leverage
[37:28] and the people that like to jump and
[37:30] shout out
[37:33] we'll go to the other side
[37:48] so then when we are in church
[37:53] and the spirit of god
[37:55] descends
[37:59] everybody feels it
[38:02] then
[38:04] [Applause]
[38:30] is
[38:43] well i want to have his presence
[38:47] let me quote to you the prophet
[38:50] he says when the spirit of god comes
[38:53] down
[38:55] does not make you shout
[38:58] out
[39:11] uh
[39:25] so then one thing una cosa is to feel
[39:28] his presence
[39:30] and the other thing
[39:32] is to have his presence
[39:35] in his presence
[39:37] when you have his presence
[39:40] let
[39:53] you have been dignified
[39:56] you you have his favor
[40:00] not that you married it
[40:02] but
[40:03] that he gave it to you
[40:05] you know what happens
[40:07] when god does that to you
[40:11] it humbles you you mia
[40:14] it humbles you to a to a place
[40:18] that you know that it's not because i
[40:21] did this for that
[40:31] now
[40:33] probably
[40:34] on the remark that i just made
[40:36] in
[41:03] and when everybody's coming this way
[41:06] and you have to turn and go this way
[41:09] it gets too hard
[41:11] and the church
[41:13] i understand
[41:15] that i okay and you use this
[41:19] can know this bible from cover to cover
[41:24] i can know these spoken word books
[41:28] from cover to cover
[41:31] and because i know them
[41:48] i am not safe because my father was a
[41:51] preacher
[41:53] i am not safe because i was raised in a
[41:56] christian home
[42:14] the world
[42:28] corinthians we go along this message is
[42:31] going to get a little deeper and a
[42:33] little deeper
[42:35] we're burning placing the soul our feet
[42:38] on in on the river
[42:55] and then we'll go to the shoulders
[42:58] and then we will pass the river that you
[43:01] have to swim
[43:04] so you follow me if you want to
[43:06] understand a little bit about the grace
[43:08] of god
[43:24] it says though i speak
[43:26] with the tongues of man and of angels
[43:32] and have not charity
[43:36] i am become a sounding breath or a
[43:40] tinkling symbol
[43:45] you see
[43:46] if you speak with tongues
[43:49] that's fine
[43:51] nothing wrong against speaking in terms
[43:52] of language but you can speak in tongues
[43:58] and
[44:00] and you can uh
[44:01] you can speak with the tongues of man
[44:03] and of angels
[44:05] but you don't have love
[44:09] you're nothing
[44:10] no es nada that's the bible
[44:14] now
[44:14] watch verse 2.
[44:17] though i have the gift of prophecy is
[44:22] you know i can have the gift of prophecy
[44:26] let me let me interpret that for you or
[44:29] try to open that up a little bit for you
[44:31] prophecy is not just a man that brings
[44:34] prophecy to the church
[44:38] we all should prophesy
[44:42] prophecy is to preach the word also
[44:46] and a woman can preach
[45:01] and though
[45:02] we can have a tongue or a gap you know
[45:04] how people have a lot of gap yet
[45:07] i know some woman that cannot preach any
[45:09] man
[45:11] but why don't they do it
[45:13] because they have
[45:15] an understanding
[45:17] amen amen but though i have the gift of
[45:19] prophecy
[45:21] and i can understand all mysteries
[45:24] mysterious you enumerate the mysteries
[45:26] in the bible
[45:28] and the the major the greatest mysteries
[45:32] are 11 of them you find them in
[45:35] uh sirs is this the time
[45:39] so it tells me here that i i can
[45:41] understand all mysteries
[45:44] and all knowledge
[45:59] i can prophesy
[46:01] i can do all these things
[46:03] i can teach you seven thunders
[46:05] whatever is revealed of them
[46:08] i can teach you about a little bit about
[46:09] the seven seals
[46:12] the six seals
[46:27] one more i'm nothing yet
[46:30] that's the bible
[46:32] so then it puts me on the alert
[46:36] that i am not saved because i know this
[46:40] i am
[46:53] i know that satan can even take the gift
[46:56] and impersonate it
[47:01] amen satan can take that
[47:03] but there's one thing he cannot
[47:05] impersonate
[47:08] the word of god
[47:35] that's why paul said i die daily
[47:39] we speak hablamos about repentance
[47:44] and people say well praise god i i
[47:46] repented a long time ago oh
[48:04] for thoughts that come to our mind
[48:07] sometimes
[48:09] we we we are as christians
[48:12] we begin to think bad about somebody
[48:14] else
[48:17] and we forget to repent about them
[48:20] then we wonder why
[48:23] instead of going forward
[48:26] sliding back
[48:28] but you come across a message
[48:32] and the message says
[48:46] and told
[49:14] everywhere
[49:28] i won't say the rest on that until later
[49:33] now
[49:36] when we believe
[49:37] the first thing that we must do
[49:40] is to believe god is clear
[49:42] how
[49:55] how many believe everything god said
[50:00] raise your hand
[50:01] now put them down
[50:03] thank you gracias
[50:07] i want
[50:08] me
[50:10] yo
[50:25] sometimes i find myself obviously
[50:29] that i think i believe
[50:33] but i don't
[50:34] know
[50:37] i might go to your home
[50:41] and pretend to you that i believe
[50:45] everything
[50:46] you pretend
[50:49] there are some things in the world
[51:05] you say you
[51:43] foreign
[52:02] when
[52:16] said this
[52:18] god said that the question that's why
[52:20] you find people
[52:21] will get baptized
[52:23] we'll follow god
[52:25] after a while
[52:26] they don't want to do it anymore
[52:29] it's not because they believe god
[52:58] [Music]
[53:26] you might think that because you do this
[53:28] in church
[53:30] that you are doing the right thing
[53:32] no we're not no
[53:34] that god wants you doing this
[53:37] but if you don't know it
[53:39] the devil will entertain you right here
[53:42] because he can impersonate any gift
[53:45] card
[53:51] this world
[53:54] is what is called satan's iden
[54:00] do you know that this world now
[54:04] belongs to him
[54:06] do you know that you and i are intruders
[54:09] right now or squatters
[54:15] do you know that this is his son
[54:18] do you know that he gained it
[54:21] by beating god's son
[54:25] so then it's his interest
[54:28] he controls all this el control
[54:31] so then
[54:32] we were all his property
[54:36] you were his property
[55:05] the the redemptive de gracia
[55:09] when
[55:10] you
[55:10] let
[55:11] let me let me emphasize that a little
[55:13] bit
[55:15] emphasis
[55:18] you
[55:19] you and i if you understand correctly
[55:23] you and i
[55:25] you you see
[55:27] somebody that doesn't know the lord
[55:31] coming down the street
[56:01] that has been taken over
[56:04] and controlled by by a power
[56:07] there that's why jesus christ said this
[56:10] christo render to caesar what's caesar's
[56:13] says
[56:26] no he'll tell you it's mine it is
[56:31] saint said if you bow to me i will give
[56:34] you all this.
[56:39] jesus christ says
[56:41] he says

[1:17:36] because let me tell you something
[1:17:38] when i married my wife because i called
[1:17:40] my esposa i didn't marry her because she
[1:17:42] was a good cook
[1:17:45] i didn't marry her because she was a
[1:17:46] good homemaker
[1:17:49] even if she burned my beans see mom it's
[1:17:51] ricoles i still loved her simple
[1:17:53] no matter what she did
[1:17:55] i loved her that's the way christ is
[1:17:58] christopher with his church iglesia so
[1:18:00] then it's not i do this

[1:18:05] and if i love him
[1:18:07] i don't want to do nothing else
[1:18:09] i just want to please him
[1:18:11] now if i want to please him

[1:18:16] a lot of homes would just discuss us i
[1:18:18] want you married couples to listen to
[1:18:20] you
[1:18:21] a lot of homes
[1:18:23] the problems that you have in your home
[1:18:39] you know how a woman places a husband
[1:18:43] by doing what her husband likes

[1:18:49] the potatoes just barely without
[1:19:07] whether you like it or not eat them or
[1:19:09] don't need them
[1:19:12] i'll tell that woman
[1:19:14] foolish woman
[1:19:19] they don't know how to please her
[1:19:20] husband
[1:19:33] how does the word of god
[1:19:48] i mean why don't you obey the word of
[1:19:50] god
[1:19:51] well i see him all day long you meet him
[1:19:53] at the door
[1:19:55] you're foolish

[1:23:53] [Music]
[1:24:56] jesus comes three times jesus
[1:24:59] i know the bible speaks about you
[1:25:03] but actually it speaks about three
[1:25:04] actually
[1:25:06] but one of them is hidden
[1:25:09] first primeramente
[1:25:37] but in between the first
[1:25:40] and the third
[1:25:42] he comes to take away his bride
[1:25:45] prophet of god calls it
[1:25:47] the secret coming of the lord
[1:25:51] it's called it's in the second coming
[1:25:54] now it's a secret coming yes
[1:25:57] and here yaki is where grace
[1:26:00] on de la gracia must really be with you
[1:26:04] grace gracia
[1:26:07] we'll give you the secret
[1:26:09] grace gracia
[1:26:12] will permit you
[1:26:14] to be in this cigarette
[1:26:18] the message is in three
[1:27:01] and i'll continue wednesday
[1:27:17] that in 1963
[1:27:21] when the seals were opened
[1:27:25] began the half hour of silence
[1:27:31] i believe that
[1:27:32] somebody don't believe that
[1:27:35] that's fine
[1:27:37] i will fight with no man
[1:27:40] amen
[1:27:42] but
[1:27:45] i believe
[1:27:47] according to the bible
[1:27:50] then when the seventh sail was opened
[1:27:55] there was silence obviously
[1:27:57] in the space of half an hour
[1:28:02] many many preachers muchos predicadores
[1:28:05] have tried
[1:28:07] to calculate
[1:28:09] or figure out
[1:28:12] how
[1:28:13] many
[1:28:14] years
[1:28:15] was that half hour of silence
[1:28:18] taken it
[1:28:19] by
[1:28:20] 360 days of bible prophecy to a year
[1:28:26] or
[1:28:50] and
[1:28:51] it seems like nothing happened in 77
[1:28:56] but
[1:28:57] he said in another scripture
[1:28:59] we are 17 years off
[1:29:06] so if you would take
[1:29:08] 1977
[1:29:14] to that roman calendar
[1:29:21] but you take half hour
[1:29:36] old
[1:29:38] to believe
[1:29:39] one thing that god said
[1:29:42] you got to believe all he said
[1:29:45] why i say it
[1:29:47] do you believe god
[1:29:48] then you say lord help my unbelief
[1:30:16] foreign
[1:30:29] let me
[1:30:31] i got four minutes
[1:30:33] let me read this
[1:30:36] half hour media
[1:30:39] let me tell you some of the calculations
[1:30:41] that they've given me some have said 21
[1:30:43] years
[1:30:45] some have told me 23 years old
[1:30:47] and so on and so on either neither
[1:30:49] whatever it is
[1:30:51] they're wrong they're wrong already just
[1:30:53] in mind
[1:30:56] all right
[1:30:58] but the calculations can be right
[1:31:12] i know
[1:31:13] this there's something here jose
[1:31:15] now this message of gray is going to
[1:31:17] take us a little deeper
[1:31:21] so if you don't want to hear this kind
[1:31:22] of teachings
[1:31:23] don't come to church when i preach
[1:31:26] this grace
[1:31:40] that's revelation 1. don't open your
[1:31:41] bible you should lead by memory
[1:31:44] but it says this he says when he opened
[1:31:46] the seventh seal
[1:31:48] there was silence in heaven
[1:31:52] never said silence on the earth
