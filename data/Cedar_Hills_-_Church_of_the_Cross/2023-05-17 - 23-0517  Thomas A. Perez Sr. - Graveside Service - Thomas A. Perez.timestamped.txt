[12:55] [Music]
[13:15] want to first of all read out of the
[13:16] book of First Corinthians the 15th
[13:18] chapter
[13:20] the first or the 12th verse that reads
[13:22] like this now if Christ
[13:25] be preached that he rose from the dead
[13:28] I'll say some among you that there is no
[13:31] resurrection of the Dead
[13:33] but if there be no resurrection of the
[13:35] dead then is Christ not risen
[13:39] but now is Christ risen from the dead
[13:41] and become the first fruits of them that
[13:43] slept
[13:44] for he must Reign till he hath put all
[13:48] enemies under his feet
[13:49] The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed
[13:52] is death
[13:53] behold I show you a mystery we shall not
[13:56] all sleep but we shall all be changed in
[14:00] a moment in the twinkling of an eye at
[14:03] the last trumpet for the trumpet shall
[14:05] sound in the dead shall be raised
[14:07] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[14:10] for this corruptable must put on
[14:13] incorruption and this Mortal must put on
[14:16] immortality
[14:17] so when this corruptable shot put on
[14:19] incorruption and this Mortal shall have
[14:22] put on immortality then shall be brought
[14:25] to pass the saying that is written
[14:28] death is swallowed up in Victory O Death
[14:31] where is thy sting oh great where is thy
[14:34] Victory but thanks be to God which
[14:37] giveth us the victory through our Lord
[14:39] Jesus Christ that's why we believe in a
[14:42] resurrection
[14:43] you know second Corinthians now chapter
[14:45] five and verse 1 and 2 says for we know
[14:48] that if our Earthly House of this
[14:50] Tabernacle be dissolved we have a
[14:53] building of God and house not made with
[14:56] hands
[14:57] Eternal in Heavens For in this we groan
[15:00] earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon
[15:03] with our house which is from heaven
[15:06] that's why Jesus said let not your
[15:08] hearts be troubled
[15:10] you believe in God believe also in me
[15:13] in my father's house are many mansions
[15:17] if it were not so I would have told you
[15:19] I go to prepare a place for you that
[15:22] and if I go to prepare a place for you I
[15:25] will come again and receive you unto
[15:27] myself
[15:28] at where I am
[15:30] there ye may be also
[15:32] brother Branham says this in the message
[15:34] Fellowship by Redemption
[15:36] a mansion
[15:38] he meant a body
[15:41] a Dwelling Place
[15:43] for the scripture verifies the same
[15:45] thing and says if this Earthly
[15:47] Tabernacle be dissolved we have one
[15:50] already waiting you see it mortal beings
[15:54] is the only one who lives in Mortal
[15:56] habitations
[15:57] Immortal beings live in Immortal
[16:00] habitations then the place that we go
[16:03] into until we return back
[16:05] is not a place of brick or mortar or
[16:09] clay or precious stones or Jewels it's a
[16:13] place of condition
[16:15] that we move out of this Dimension that
[16:17] we live into another dimension and it's
[16:20] a house a tabernacle a Dwelling Place
[16:23] Jesus said destroy this Temple and I'll
[16:26] raise it up in three days and they
[16:28] thought he was speaking of Solomon's
[16:30] Temple but he was speaking of his own
[16:33] body and he has gone to prepare a place
[16:35] for every believer at the very moment we
[16:39] step out of these mortal regions we
[16:41] don't go out into myth or some
[16:43] Supernatural Spirit we go into a
[16:46] tabernacle into a Dwelling Place
[16:50] we know we'll see our Papa again
[16:52] [Music]
[16:54] we always say this and I say papa well
[16:56] when you get there you you make sure you
[16:59] tell Mama we said hello
[17:02] give her a hug for us and we know it
[17:04] won't be long that we get to see them
[17:06] again that's the Blessed hope of the
[17:10] believer
[17:11] so as we bow Our Heads This Day
[17:14] and we approach our heavenly father
[17:17] we simply call upon him and say gracious
[17:20] loving father
[17:22] it is with all assurance that we plant
[17:24] the body of
[17:25] of the man that we call Pops
[17:28] our Earthly father
[17:30] and the only reason why we can have such
[17:32] an assurance is because
[17:34] 2000 years ago Lord you conquered death
[17:37] hell and the grave and you Rose
[17:40] victoriously and declared to every
[17:42] believer because I live you can live
[17:44] also
[17:46] words cannot describe the peace we feel
[17:48] in our hearts knowing that he fought the
[17:51] good fight he kept the faith he finished
[17:52] his course and we know that one of these
[17:55] mornings you will call and he will
[17:57] answer
[17:58] we commit this body to the ground from
[18:00] whence it came Earth to Earth dust to
[18:03] dust ashes to ashes
[18:05] and now O Lord we commit his spirit and
[18:07] soul to you The Giver of Life
[18:10] bless all our family Lord and our
[18:12] friends and loved ones that continue on
[18:14] this journey Comfort us with thy
[18:16] precious Holy Spirit and if anyone has
[18:19] gotten away from you may you pull them
[18:21] back to you Lord if anyone does not know
[18:24] you Lord may they come to Know You Lord
[18:25] we thank you for his life of service to
[18:28] you
[18:29] into your people and we ask all these
[18:32] things in the precious name of our Lord
[18:33] and Savior Jesus Christ amen

[25:25] a good example to his children that we
[25:27] see today so I I love this family
[25:29] they're very close to me many of the
[25:31] members I I have a lot of respect for
[25:33] and so I I wanted to say just a few
[25:37] short words is why I wanted to share
[25:39] that but uh I we are going to include
[25:41] our services by releasing some palomitas
[25:44] okay the family is going to do that
[25:47] we're going to say via con dios together
[25:50] when those are released and so we want
[25:52] to thank our our we want to take quite a
[25:55] few people I want to start with the
[25:57] Marine Corps League who's up there in
[25:58] the corner I want to show how much
[26:00] respect they have after they've already
[26:02] done fired they haven't moved and
[26:04] they're staying there out of respect to
[26:06] the family who's still holding the flags
[26:07] right and then we want to thank our
[26:09] members of the active duty military who
[26:13] traveled hours and hours just to be here
[26:15] for this particular service
[26:16] we want to thank the state police
[26:19] for their tremendous work and coming and
[26:23] stopping the traffic is for those of you
[26:25] for those of you who were on the
[26:26] interstate you saw how much that that
[26:29] helped us and kept us safe and of course
[26:31] all the friends or the relatives uh NMSU
[26:34] I want to also thank you thank them and
[26:37] the coach for having that little card I
[26:40] know that little card helped a lot or
[26:42] you'd be going back telling your doctor
[26:43] that you walked three miles so you know
[26:46] they helped us back and forth and that
[26:48] was a blessing so there was many many
[26:50] people that made this uh many many
[26:52] speakers many pastors too many to
[26:55] mentioned and but we the the family
[26:57] greatly appreciates everyone's uh
[27:00] kindness and and efforts that they were
[27:02] given so as we release the palomita and
[27:04] we all say
[27:06] that'll conclude our services and at
[27:09] that point we we wish you the best on
[27:12] your travels because I'm sure you'll be
[27:14] traveling back home okay are those who
[27:16] need on your travels and then the family
[27:19] will privately only only because of the
[27:22] the obstacles that we have over there
[27:24] are the only reason that that we're
[27:26] trying to keep you safe and so with that
[27:29] we conclude our services let's go ahead
[27:30] and have the family uh one more thing
[27:35] I think it would only be fitting that we
[27:38] uh that we depart with uh with our
