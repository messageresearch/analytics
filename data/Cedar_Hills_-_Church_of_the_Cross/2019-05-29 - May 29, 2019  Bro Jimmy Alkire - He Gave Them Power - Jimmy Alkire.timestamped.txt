[1:04:57] Jehovah's Witness they tell me brother
[1:05:02] Jimmy Mason I'm gonna give me a bit
[1:05:04] tangy the word Lord bless in your
[1:05:08] the correct word is Jehovah la palabra
[1:05:10] correct is here what the word Lord is
[1:05:13] the translation la palabra Senora like
[1:05:15] really here that is so wonderful to
[1:05:21] Kristen about what is Jehovah me cousin
[1:05:24] if he can hear here well illegal and by
[1:05:26] the way the word Jehovah is also a

[1:06:14] political what the official same is
[1:06:17] self-existing God in me would do so
[1:06:19] consistently that now is dwelling with
[1:06:22] his family
[1:06:23] k order a vehicle su Familia and it also
[1:06:25] means system is significant that God
[1:06:28] gave man give you live you know
