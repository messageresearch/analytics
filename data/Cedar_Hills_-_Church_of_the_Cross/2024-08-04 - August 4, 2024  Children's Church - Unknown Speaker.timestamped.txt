[29:42] you like the old Chinese laundryman used
[29:46] to come here to Arizona in California
[29:48] years ago he couldn't write one word of
[29:50] English he hardly knew it you take your
[29:52] laundry to him you know what did he do
[29:53] he had little pieces of paper nothing
[29:55] wrote on it at all he just tear that
[29:57] piece of paper and gave give you one
[29:58] piece when you come back that piece of
[30:01] paper had to match his piece of paper or
[30:03] you didn't get your arm
[30:05] read that's a whole lot better you can
[30:07] copy a name but you ain't going to fool
[30:09] him there cuz that piece of paper has to
[30:11] match exactly with his piece of paper
[30:14] that's the way God made his Covenant too
[30:16] our experience is not to match some
[30:18] Creed some Dogma some church
[30:20] denomination but it's the match God's
[30:22] word Jesus Christ
[30:25] [Music]

[32:37] rush and everybody came from all around
[32:41] to see if they could strike a fortune
[32:44] and get gold in
[32:46] California so I came down looking for

[43:42] ticket oh finally let me see what I got
[43:46] for you

[43:52] work I so excited

[44:15] I
[44:20] okay there you go Mr
[44:23] Jones oh thank you are you sure that's
[44:26] the one you

[44:47] yes we can do tap swipe or ENT card okay
[44:52] you never forget and then we don't use
[44:55] our machine cuz they charge too much
[44:56] okay
[44:59] okay I don't know if customers are
[45:02] getting in our shop cuz I don't know if
[45:06] everyone's going to get laundry come
[45:08] over here okay fine we got to tell them
[45:11] the reason we do
[45:14] that so I want you all to listen very
[45:17] close okay so when we tear the
[45:23] ticket there's no way to fake it if you
[45:27] try to bring me another ticket that does
[45:29] not
[45:30] match then it won't work and that's the
[45:33] way God's word
[45:36] is when we do things that we shouldn't
[45:38] be doing and we try to match it up with
[45:42] God's word it not fit so if I cut this
[45:47] piece there you see it not fit but not
[45:52] only does that happen but the devil too
[45:55] tries to he tries to tell you something
[45:59] and when God's word's in your heart it
[46:01] doesn't match
[46:03] up but when God's word is in your
[46:12] heart and this is you this is God's word
[46:16] and it come
[46:17] together it fits so perfect and there's
[46:21] no room for the devil to get
[46:23] in and that is why it's so so
[46:28] important to make sure that you always
[46:30] get what belongs to you the only way you
[46:33] can do it is when the word is in your
[46:36] heart when God's word is in your heart
[46:39] you can go and purchase whatever belongs
[46:42] to you and the devil cannot keep keep it
[46:45] away from
[46:48] you amen
