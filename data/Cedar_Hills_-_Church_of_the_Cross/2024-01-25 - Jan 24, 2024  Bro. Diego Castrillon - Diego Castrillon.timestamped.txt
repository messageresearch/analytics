[30:33] Christ I would like to invite you this
[30:42] evening you could please open up your
[30:44] scripture to Hebrews in chapter
[30:48] 10 and as as I begin to to tell
[30:53] you last year around the the month of
[30:56] November
[31:00] remember I had an invitation to go
[31:02] preach in El
[31:06] [Music]
[31:09] Paso I was praying and preparing for
[31:12] that for that
[31:17] service and as I was in prayer and
[31:23] fasting because I did not want it to be
[31:25] Diego Caston to go preach
[31:30] where Diego Caston puts his hand he
[31:33] makes a mess I make a
[31:39] mess so I was asking the Lord that it
[31:41] was him that he would be on the
[31:47] scene and I remember telling the Lord
[31:49] Lord minister to your people heal
[31:55] them when the Holy H Spirit speaks to
[31:58] me he spoke to
[32:03] me in my closet where I was
[32:08] praying and I was praying and the Holy
[32:10] Spirit told
[32:13] me speak to your
[32:16] pain tell it to go
[32:26] away about eight years I had this pain
[32:28] on my
[32:30] heels and eight years I suffered with
[32:35] that and I would see uh uh healings and
[32:38] miracles in many
[32:40] ways but I wouldn't pay attention to
[32:42] that
[32:45] pain and it would torment me for eight
[32:49] years and I hadn't realize
[32:54] that when the Holy Spirit tells me speak
[32:56] to that thing
[32:57] tell it to
[33:00] leave I I looked at my
[33:03] foot and I
[33:06] said in the name of Jesus Christ you're
[33:08] leaving and you don't come
[33:10] back and brothers God is my
[33:14] witness two three four
[33:20] seconds began to come and go and then it
[33:24] left and I learned something brother
[33:28] that when God
[33:30] speaks his word
[33:32] still it is
[33:36] effective any territory under any
[33:41] circumstance brother please
[33:45] come he had he had said a testimony to
[33:49] me what
[33:52] happened my my friend Noah he was in the
[33:55] in the kitchen
[33:57] he got a a
[34:00] headache after he left the
[34:05] house that same headache tried to come
[34:08] to my
[34:11] body and I began to think about brother
[34:15] Noah and I remembered what brother Diego
[34:22] said and I told my headache you do you
[34:25] do not belong here in the name of Jesus
[34:29] Christ and they tried to return just
[34:31] like brother Diego said his pain wanted
[34:33] to come back but it left hallelujah
[34:40] hallelujah now
[34:44] watch he did not say Lord Heal my
[34:47] pain he spoke to the
[34:50] pain and he said you do not
[34:53] belong because the word says
[34:57] by by his
[34:59] stripes we have all been
[35:03] healed brother Bram said he can no
[35:05] longer heal us because he already did
[35:09] it you only have to take the
[35:12] word and apply
[35:17] it if you could please
[35:20] stand we'll honor the word of the
[35:25] Lord
[35:28] in Hebrews chapter 10 verse
[35:30] 1 scripture
[35:36] says for the law having a shadow of good
[35:39] things to
[35:41] come and now pay attention to these
[35:47] words the good things to
[35:51] come read it from the
[35:55] beginning
[35:58] for the law having a shadow of good
[36:00] things to
[36:03] come and not the very
[36:06] image of the
[36:14] things can never with those sacrifices
[36:17] which they offered year by year
[36:18] continually make the comers there on to
[36:24] perfect Lord good evening
[36:30] Lord we play put ourselves
[36:34] aside so that we can sit in Heavenly
[36:39] places and take every Redemptive
[36:45] blessing and Lord Minister them unto
[36:47] your
[36:50] people Lord that this may be done for
[36:53] the honor and Glory of your
[36:55] name we thank you for your
[36:57] pres you could please take your
[37:02] seat now capture what the Apostle Paul
[37:05] is trying to
[37:06] say the
[37:11] law having a shadow of good things to
[37:15] come it says not the very
[37:19] image no the law is the shadow of good
[37:22] things to
[37:23] come now what does that mean brother
[37:25] Diego
[37:27] when we read about
[37:31] Moses and the tremendous things that
[37:33] Moses
[37:35] did he brought things into
[37:40] existence a Ministry that had the spoken
[37:44] work impressive things that were
[37:48] done but it was the
[37:53] shadow we see
[37:55] Abraham the father of the
[37:59] faith what faith this man
[38:02] had that he could take his
[38:05] son taken up to the Mount to
[38:09] sacrifice his faith was so great in
[38:13] God he produced a
[38:16] ram what a
[38:21] faith but but but that is the
[38:24] shadow what about Elijah
[38:29] oh we identify with
[38:32] that he made uh fire descend from
[38:41] heaven took hundreds of false prophets
[38:43] and cut their head
[38:45] off
[38:48] Elijah he did impressive
[38:53] things but that is the
[38:55] shadow
[38:58] that that's the Shadow the
[39:01] law is the
[39:03] shadow everything that you
[39:05] see is the shadow of
[39:08] what of the good
[39:11] things one day that
[39:13] shadow reached the
[39:16] point where it was no longer a
[39:19] shadow but the image came the Bible
[39:23] says God was made flesh
[39:27] the word was made
[39:30] flesh it was no longer
[39:33] the now the good things the good things
[39:36] to
[39:37] come were
[39:39] present yes brother it was no longer the
[39:43] shadow it was the
[39:45] image
[39:47] Colossians
[39:49] says Christ
[39:52] being the
[39:54] image of the Living God
[39:58] he was the
[39:59] image he was the
[40:02] good now when Jesus was
[40:05] here he died
[40:08] resurrected but he did not
[40:12] leave in the upper
[40:15] room when there was
[40:18] 120 in the day of
[40:21] Pentecost what happened with those
[40:24] goods what what did they leave what
[40:26] happen where are they Jesus died and
[40:30] he no those
[40:33] goods that had been
[40:35] promised they
[40:38] divided in 120
[40:41] people where are those
[40:44] goods I see
[40:48] them those goods are
[40:51] here you understand what
[40:54] God has placed in you
[40:58] when you receive the Holy
[41:00] Spirit you are
[41:02] receiving not the
[41:05] shadow although it was
[41:07] good there was Miracles there healings
[41:10] and and
[41:12] wonders but
[41:14] now it's not the
[41:17] shadow now it's the
[41:20] image now it's the
[41:22] image of the Living God hallelujah
[41:32] if there is
[41:35] something brother Bram says the
[41:39] best that God can give his
[41:48] children Good Wife there's my sweet my
[41:50] beloved
[41:52] wife 24 years my
[41:55] love it's been like 24
[41:59] minutes glory to the
[42:08] Lord after a wife what is it what did
[42:10] Brother brandham
[42:12] say what is the best thing God can give
[42:14] his
[42:15] children it's
[42:18] Revelation it is
[42:24] revelation when Peter makes the
[42:25] confession about
[42:27] Jesus Jesus responds and he says
[42:32] Peter I I tell you you are
[42:35] Peter and Upon This
[42:38] Rock I will build my
[42:40] church now brother Brandon
[42:43] said not the rock of
[42:46] Peter not the rock of
[42:49] Jesus the rock of
[42:52] Revelation now keep
[42:55] reading
[42:56] and the
[42:57] gates of
[42:59] hell and the Gates of
[43:04] Hell will not Prevail
[43:07] against against
[43:11] it now what is it to
[43:15] Prevail Prevail speaks to me about a
[43:19] conflict it speaks to me about a
[43:22] war and in a
[43:25] conflict
[43:27] when Jesus says they will not
[43:31] Prevail that means there is one that
[43:34] means there's one that will be superior
[43:37] there will be
[43:38] one that will
[43:40] overcome will not
[43:43] Prevail that's because there's two
[43:45] opponents and one one stri and the other
[43:49] strikes
[43:51] other I don't know how to box we have
[43:54] good boxers here
[44:00] they're
[44:01] boxers they see me and they
[44:04] laugh look like a girl
[44:07] brother that's how it
[44:09] is but that's what that's what it's like
[44:11] to
[44:12] fight but
[44:15] he that has the
[44:17] Revelation to
[44:20] Prevail you see
[44:23] why why we need revelation now I
[44:27] ask
[44:31] who who established this
[44:34] conflict on
[44:37] purpose who established this
[44:42] conflict let us go to Genesis 3:1
[44:54] 15 Genesis
[44:57] Genesis
[44:59] 3 it
[45:02] says now who's speaking here is
[45:09] God and I will put
[45:12] enmity and I will place
[45:14] conflict I will place
[45:17] conflict and
[45:20] fights between thee and the
[45:23] woman between thy seed
[45:27] and her
[45:30] seed and you may say what problem did we
[45:32] get ourselves
[45:36] into God established this
[45:40] conflict God
[45:42] established let me tell you something
[45:45] else the scriptures
[45:50] say one day the children of
[45:54] God they presented themselves before the
[46:00] Lord and the scripture says and Satan
[46:05] also he gets in in in all
[46:10] places now now watch the
[46:16] scene I'll try to make a drama so you
[46:18] can uh capture
[46:21] it because between lines you can see
[46:24] what what what happens what what happens
[46:28] next and the
[46:32] Lord as
[46:35] Satan where have you
[46:38] been in this
[46:41] conflict it is like a game of
[46:44] chess where the first one that
[46:47] moves obligates the
[46:50] other to then
[46:53] move where you want him to to be
[46:57] tell the game of chess is a
[47:01] strategy now God moves
[47:05] first and you he ask Satan where have
[47:07] you
[47:09] been and here comes
[47:12] Satan and he comes to show
[47:16] off I've been roaming the the
[47:20] Earth it belongs to me I won it from
[47:22] your
[47:24] son
[47:27] that's what it means I've been
[47:30] roaming he was boasting to
[47:33] God and he was the owner of the
[47:37] Earth but it
[47:41] wasn't now now Satan
[47:43] moved he began to to to boast to
[47:48] God and then God moves his
[47:51] piece he says Whoa
[47:54] Satan they don't all belong to
[47:58] you have you seen my servant
[48:04] job now
[48:06] wait
[48:09] wait did not know
[48:12] this was making sacrifice praising the
[48:16] Lord and here's
[48:18] God moving his
[48:24] peace Satan hates the children of God
[48:28] and God knows
[48:31] that but but but but God wanted to put a
[48:34] little bit more more spice on
[48:40] it have you considered my servant
[48:43] job he's
[48:45] perfect he's fearful of God he he's
[48:49] departed from
[48:52] EV that made the devil get more
[48:54] Furious
[48:56] that that's what God
[48:59] wanted to let loose hell over
[49:02] job it's something
[49:04] crazy what God is
[49:07] doing he's doing the best for his
[49:11] children Satan said well of
[49:15] course because you protect it there's a
[49:18] head from you don't let me get it go to
[49:23] him but just give me a chance
[49:27] and I will make him blaspheme against
[49:29] your
[49:31] name and that's where God wanted
[49:33] him he said
[49:36] go go don't touch his
[49:44] life and thanks to this
[49:49] trial you already know all that job had
[49:52] to go
[49:54] through because that is the
[49:56] Tri when the
[49:59] Revelation comes and made
[50:04] manifest it's not when you're at home
[50:07] watching
[50:08] television
[50:09] eating in the
[50:11] restaurant or on
[50:14] vacation it's when you're in hell when
[50:18] you're in the
[50:19] trial when
[50:21] Revelation comes to
[50:23] you that's when job
[50:26] in the middle of
[50:29] hell where he he he he maintained his
[50:34] integrity and he could
[50:36] recognize that his
[50:38] Redeemer
[50:41] lived he would raise him up from the
[50:47] dust and when job could
[50:52] say I had heard by ear
[50:58] but now my eyes have
[51:03] seen I imagine God being so
[51:07] proud what favor you did for me
[51:12] Satan because we go to the
[51:15] scripture we go to Hebrews chapter
[51:21] 10 verse 12 and verse
[51:24] 13
[51:30] I would like to run but I can't I want
[51:32] you to to
[51:42] capture but this man after he had
[51:44] offered one sacrifice for sins forever
[51:46] sat down on the right hand of God
[51:54] uh
[51:59] now look at this
[52:01] drama but
[52:03] Christ after he had
[52:07] offered one
[52:10] sacrifice for
[52:12] sins now these are
[52:15] symbols but we're making this drama so
[52:17] you can
[52:20] understand has
[52:22] sat at the right hand of God
[52:26] and from there on
[52:28] forward
[52:31] waiting he's not doing
[52:33] anything he's
[52:38] waiting expecting till his
[52:41] enemies be
[52:44] made his foot
[52:48] stolu the enemies of
[52:54] Christ but Christ is not doing anything
[52:56] because he's sitting
[52:58] down he's sitting down
[53:01] until all his
[53:04] enemies all his
[53:06] enemies all of his
[53:08] enemies all of his
[53:12] pain all the failures that you
[53:15] carry all the afflictions you
[53:18] have are Sons and Daughters of
[53:21] God all of your
[53:23] enemies are placed
[53:26] are made his foot
[53:28] stol you know the word foot stol
[53:30] is this is a foot
[53:34] stol is so that you can go up and
[53:39] then
[53:42] Satan ask permission to
[53:45] God I want to send a cancer to
[53:49] Diego are you
[53:52] sure yes I'm going to send it to him I'm
[53:54] going to kill him
[53:59] you think that's really a good idea yes
[54:02] give him to I want
[54:05] him go but do not touch his
[54:08] life and here's brother
[54:10] Diego resisting the
[54:13] spirit I will put him here a
[54:17] footo so that I can
[54:20] step take one more step up I'll go one
[54:24] more Step Up
[54:27] yes until all his
[54:30] enemies are
[54:33] made his foot
[54:35] stol his
[54:37] [Music]
[54:39] trials they're the best thing that God
[54:41] can give his
[54:42] children because the
[54:44] revelation of who you are in
[54:49] him it will take you to the
[54:51] St to
[54:54] understand
[54:56] that you are an heir of all good
[54:59] [Music]
[55:02] things God is is not a respector of
[55:08] person God is not a respector of
[55:11] person the scripture
[55:15] says believe it is in
[55:17] Luke Luke
[55:21] four and Jesus filled of the spirit
[55:33] was taken by the
[55:36] spirit to be tempted by the Devil by
[55:40] Satan what it says yes
[55:42] sir God is not a respector of
[55:47] person when you read the third
[55:51] Temptation and Satan tells
[55:54] Jesus
[55:56] all of these kingdoms they are
[56:00] mine you kneel down and worship me I
[56:03] will give them to
[56:06] you that was enough for Jesus Jesus
[56:11] said it is written
[56:13] Satan you shall not
[56:16] tempt your lord your
[56:23] God you shall not tempt
[56:28] Lord the Lord was
[56:30] there the first
[56:33] Lord he is Lord of lords it was there in
[56:37] that
[56:38] Temptation where
[56:40] Jesus could prove to the devil that he
[56:44] he was God his
[56:47] Lord and that he could not tempt him
[56:51] brother brandham
[56:53] said received 880,000
[56:59] BTS thank
[57:00] you thanks to that
[57:03] Temptation Jesus
[57:05] proved that he
[57:07] knew that he was the Son of
[57:10] God the
[57:19] Lord now imagine when
[57:23] Jesus
[57:27] he he says
[57:29] Peter oh
[57:31] Peter
[57:34] Satan has asked for
[57:37] you to sift you like
[57:41] wheat now I remember I I I imagine
[57:44] Peter oh
[57:48] teacher I imagine you told him
[57:51] no I'm your
[57:53] favorite the Revelation came to me of
[57:56] who you
[57:58] are Lord thank
[58:01] you I know you stood up for me thank
[58:07] you what did you tell him
[58:12] teacher I have prayed for
[58:15] you so that your faith will not fail you
[58:19] because I've given you
[58:21] up and when you are converted
[58:26] from the
[58:27] tri it's the trial Peter
[58:29] needed to be
[58:32] converted and
[58:35] then confirm your brothers
[58:41] amen how many
[58:44] people do not
[58:47] convert we know the key now my
[58:50] gener we know who we can
[58:53] send
[58:55] it's the
[58:56] best now you
[58:59] say what does that have to do with
[59:02] us
[59:05] all but because I imagine the
[59:09] drama in
[59:10] this this last
[59:12] time I
[59:15] imagine Satan where have you
[59:18] been I've been roaming the Earth been
[59:23] occupied
[59:25] have you seen my
[59:27] beloved I'm going to marry
[59:30] her you have you don't have much time
[59:34] left don't you see her so pure and so
[59:37] clean she's
[59:40] precious oh I can see the
[59:42] devil sound the
[59:44] trumpet get
[59:47] [Music]
[59:48] ready 100,000 million
[59:52] demons that's right
[59:55] and God says it's not
[59:58] enough you have a short time left
[1:00:02] s
[1:00:04] oh I'll go quickly to get to to go get
[1:00:08] you now understand that the best that
[1:00:12] God has given it is our
[1:00:15] trial that is our treas not the good
[1:00:20] they're
[1:00:21] good but the best thing that God has
[1:00:23] given us are
[1:00:25] trials because that's
[1:00:27] where where Revelation
[1:00:30] comes and that's where you can
[1:00:33] stand and call The
