[38:25] amen would you stand as we're gonna get
[38:28] we're going to get into the word we have
[38:29] a a little bit
[38:31] lengthy
[38:33] programs
[38:35] we're trying to we'll cut it down a
[38:38] little bit but we want to get right into
[38:40] the word
[38:42] quite a few people that are out sick
[38:44] this morning
[38:48] and be with them and give them their
[38:50] recovery
[38:55] they gave me some
[38:57] what was it
[38:59] that little thing
[39:01] it was for cottonmouth
[39:07] so I won't take it anymore
[39:11] so up in the middle of it
[39:13] you see me going like that yeah
[39:17] amen we're happy this morning
[39:21] because we understand by a prophet
[39:26] that Christmas is not a celebration
[39:30] celebration Christmas is a worship
[39:34] morning because we have come we have
[39:38] seen his star and we've come to work
[39:43] and to bring worship to the one and only
[39:46] potentate
[39:47] our king of kings and our Lord of lords
[39:54] this may seem like an odd scripture to
[39:58] read for Christmas is
[40:02] I think by the end of the sermon you'll
[40:05] understand why I I'm reading it
[40:10] so let's go to the Book of Exodus
[40:15] 13th chapter
[40:21] we were hoping my father was going to
[40:23] make it
[40:25] Pastor I don't know if maybe they're
[40:27] still on their way but
[40:30] when you have it you can say Amen
[40:32] the
[40:35] title of the message is the true
[40:37] worshiper number two is
[40:41] with a subtitled the Church of the
[40:43] firstborn
[40:45] how many here are the church part of
[40:47] that church of the first born
[40:51] you tell your neighbors a neighbor I'm
[40:53] part of that church
[40:55] yes part of the Church of the firstborn
[41:01] amen
[41:03] reads like this Exodus 13 verse 1.
[41:07] and the Lord speaking to Moses saying
[41:13] sanctify unto me all the firstborn
[41:17] that is
[41:19] wow we are the Church of the firstborn
[41:23] sanctify him unto me all the firstborns
[41:28] whatsoever openeth the womb
[41:32] among the children of Israel
[41:34] both of man and of beasts
[41:38] it is mine is
[41:41] let's go to verse 12. that thou shalt
[41:45] set apart unto the Lord
[41:47] all that openeth the Matrix
[41:55] and and
[41:57] every first link yes
[42:01] set apart unto the Lord all that openeth
[42:04] the Matrix
[42:06] and every first link that cometh of a
[42:10] beast
[42:16] the males shall be the Lords
[42:20] verse 15. and it came to pass when
[42:24] Pharaoh could would hardly let us go
[42:27] that the Lord slew all the firstborn in
[42:31] the land of Egypt
[42:32] both the firstborn of man and the
[42:35] firstborn of Beast therefore I
[42:38] sacrificed to the Lord all that openeth
[42:41] the Matrix being males but all the
[42:45] firstborn of my children
[42:48] I redeem is
[42:56] FICO
[43:07] once again the firstborn of my children
[43:11] I redeem or I buy back
[43:17] as blessings to the reading of his word
[43:19] you may be seated
[43:21] just for a few moments here
[43:25] in the scripture there is enough here to
[43:28] preach until as they say till kingdom
[43:32] come in
[43:35] when you see words such as first born
[43:46] these are things that are so relevant in
[43:49] understanding why we must be born again
[43:54] now we often think of the first born
[44:00] as the one who is born first
[44:03] yes or yes COC now I got to make sure
[44:07] this morning that that some of you are
[44:09] not in a food coma still yeah
[44:13] anybody's still in a food coma ate too
[44:15] much yesterday
[44:17] and then we went to bed late I'm sure
[44:22] see and then you've had a hard time
[44:25] getting up
[44:26] and you stayed in the shower
[44:30] and then you remembered it was a worship
[44:33] day
[44:36] notice this now we often think of the
[44:39] firstborn as the one who was born first
[44:41] is that right
[44:44] or what would be called the initial
[44:47] child
[44:48] and there is truth in that
[44:51] but there is much more to this subject
[44:54] than what meets the eye
[44:57] so as I was thinking and meditating upon
[45:01] this subject
[45:03] wondering why the Lord would have me
[45:06] preach this on Christmas
[45:10] I get this spot and I and I began to
[45:13] work with it
[45:16] so listen closely here
[45:19] if we talk about the first child that
[45:21] was ever born who was it
[45:27] somebody help me out here you look like
[45:31] a very intelligent crowd
[45:34] can happen today
[45:37] who was the first child that was ever
[45:39] born
[45:41] not man I'm talking to child right
[45:49] was Cain right in the Bible says that
[45:53] amen now now uh if Cain was the first
[45:57] and who was the second Segundo
[46:02] was able
[46:04] then my question then and this is where
[46:07] I'm getting into where I began to think
[46:09] about this
[46:11] that if the initial child was Kane
[46:16] then wouldn't the birthright belong to
[46:19] Caine
[46:25] um
[46:27] some are saying yes and some say no
[46:33] I'm gonna say it again if the initial
[46:36] child or the firstborn was Cain
[46:40] wouldn't the birthright belong to him
[46:44] you might say well the the law of the
[46:47] firstborn uh hadn't been established
[46:52] maybe it's true
[46:54] don't you think that
[46:58] satanas understood the significance of
[47:01] what it was to be a firstborn
[47:05] how many are with me this this day once
[47:09] again though do you not think that Satan
[47:11] understood what the significance was
[47:18] therefore wouldn't it make sense that
[47:21] the the spirit that anointed Cain
[47:26] would then tell him hey uh don't forget
[47:30] that you are the firstborn
[47:36] why then are you not receiving the
[47:39] benefits of being the firstborn
[47:43] if you can just go with me for a little
[47:45] while and just see who where what what I
[47:49] was meditating on and thinking of is
[47:53] and I I then began to think about the
[47:57] story
[47:59] and I and I and I and I remembered in
[48:02] the scriptures where it says
[48:04] Kane was very rothsanyo
[48:11] was there something that was given to
[48:14] Abel that
[48:15] Cain was expecting himself okay
[48:20] was there something that was given to
[48:21] Abel yeah
[48:26] did it have something to do with the
[48:29] blessing
[48:30] of the
[48:32] firstborne
[48:34] I had never stopped to think about that
[48:39] I mean we see that the birth the
[48:41] fighting going on with Jacob and Esau
[48:46] but I thought for a moment I said well
[48:48] well wouldn't Cain then be in the same
[48:51] situation
[48:54] looking for the blessing of being the
[48:57] first born
[48:59] and yet he saw that God accepted he
[49:04] accepted Abel's sacrifice but not his
[49:08] sacrifice
[49:09] I looked at that and I said my goodness
[49:12] I can see why he would be so upset
[49:18] this is where we would follow the trail
[49:21] of the firstborn
[49:24] what did Satan know
[49:29] that that he got them to get ahead of
[49:32] God's program
[49:35] that through the serpenter he got to the
[49:39] woman which was the betting ground
[49:48] he got to her first
[49:50] there for the firstborn child was Kane
[49:55] but although that Cain was Eve's first
[49:59] born
[50:02] he was not Adam's first born
[50:05] now this is why you have to look at it
[50:08] from from a few different angles
[50:11] and you talk about the firstborn well
[50:13] the firstborn of who
[50:17] watch as this this as we try to unfold
[50:20] this now
[50:22] when you really look at it then both of
[50:25] them were a first born
[50:29] all right sure see you look at that and
[50:32] but we see that Abel was of Adam
[50:36] and the Bible says that Cain was of that
[50:39] Wicked one
[50:41] but there was a Birthright
[50:44] the first male to open
[50:56] for without realizing it you you tend to
[51:00] We tend to overlook certain things
[51:03] but how many of them would say that Cain
[51:06] then then the birthright should have
[51:08] been his cuentos
[51:16] ah you guys are scared
[51:21] you disagree
[51:24] that's okay and and that that's why this
[51:27] thought came to me
[51:29] and I began to see this and then I I
[51:32] cannot preach something
[51:34] unless I go to the word
[51:37] I can't prove it by the word it doesn't
[51:40] mean no good
[51:41] then I have to take the thought and I
[51:44] gotta throw it away
[51:48] but when I look into this into the
[51:50] message of the hour thank God for a
[51:53] prophet
[51:54] and this is in the message earnestly
[51:57] contending for the faith
[51:59] and brother Brahm says but let's take
[52:02] the first two boys
[52:05] that was born on this Earth
[52:09] and then watch what he says
[52:11] Cain first
[52:16] he was supposed to have the birthright
[52:22] I didn't say this the prophet of God
[52:24] said this
[52:25] once again came first
[52:29] really he was supposed to have the
[52:33] birthright
[52:34] but he lost it just as Esau did
[52:40] not now it pertained to him because he
[52:45] was the first to open the womb if we
[52:49] would say the womb of Eve
[52:53] notice this now now the scriptures and
[52:56] we're gonna we're gonna back this up by
[52:58] scriptures
[52:59] this was intriguing to me
[53:02] because it was here the whole time
[53:06] but I had never looked at Cain and Abel
[53:11] Through The Eyes of the birthright
[53:15] maybe many some of you had and God bless
[53:18] you I'm not acting like this is the
[53:20] first one to ever think of this
[53:26] When I See This unfolding
[53:30] the birthright was supposed to be king
[53:35] but he lost it just as Esau
[53:40] so now when I look at Cain and Abel in
[53:43] regards to the birthright
[53:46] I want to know how Cain lost it
[53:54] are you with me now now come on Come
[53:57] With Me Now how did Kane lose the
[54:00] birthright
[54:02] you that are spiritual you'll catch it
[54:06] why he lost the birthright
[54:09] remember anything you do without faith
[54:13] is sin
[54:15] now I cannot go any farther until I
[54:19] realize
[54:21] that the birthright is connected to
[54:24] Redemption
[54:27] I can't even begin to understand what
[54:30] Birthright is
[54:32] if I don't put it together with the
[54:35] right to Redemption
[54:38] once again you got to get this birth
[54:41] right
[54:43] it's the right to Redemption
[54:46] now now notice this now biggest thing
[54:49] Satan understood that
[54:51] and that's why when that when when Adam
[54:55] he forfeited his rights
[54:59] through the hands the the dirty hands of
[55:02] Satan
[55:04] but say in wanting to do it his way
[55:10] to achieve the same thing
[55:13] he thought that he could that that he
[55:16] could just get it by placing Cain as the
[55:20] firstborn
[55:24] but watch what goes with the birthright
[55:35] a mom I want you to see this now as I
[55:39] began then going to the scripture
[55:43] I started making more sense the
[55:46] scripture that we have read for years
[55:56] and in process of time it came to pass
[55:59] that now you that are spiritual I want
[56:02] to see if you catch this question is
[56:05] that Cain brought of the fruit of the
[56:08] ground and offering unto the Lord
[56:14] I was talking to some of the young young
[56:16] people yesterday
[56:18] and I said let me see if you guys can
[56:20] catch this
[56:22] they got it
[56:26] Noah
[56:27] come on
[56:29] watch verse four he said and Abel he
[56:32] also brought of the firstlings of his
[56:34] flock
[56:37] and of the fat thereof is and the Lord
[56:42] had respect unto Abel and to his
[56:45] offering
[56:47] but unto Canaan to his offering he had
[56:50] not respect
[56:53] and Cain was very Roth and his
[56:57] countenance fell is
[57:01] now now go with me here now
[57:04] because automatically
[57:07] they must have thought
[57:10] he was the first born
[57:13] that he could do whatever he wanted
[57:16] he could offer whatever he wanted
[57:20] wow you with me now notices now we can
[57:25] see I'm the first born
[57:27] I want to want to offer and give my some
[57:30] fruits
[57:32] that's what I'm gonna do is
[57:36] but he lacked the Revelation
[57:39] revelation of what the firstborn should
[57:42] have
[57:44] because it wasn't just being born it was
[57:47] a first born
[57:50] and when Kane
[57:53] he never offered the first fruits
[57:57] he only offered fruit
[58:03] how many are with me you got to get this
[58:05] he didn't offer just he didn't offer the
[58:07] first fruits
[58:11] and the type of that was not perfect to
[58:15] what was coming yes
[58:17] notice notice this now but Abel had a
[58:21] revelation
[58:23] and by faith Abel offered unto God a
[58:27] more excellent sacrifice
[58:31] what did he offer the Bible says he
[58:35] brought of the first links
[58:40] watch this now that's when Cain realized
[58:46] it is impossible to please God
[58:49] church we can sit here Iglesia
[58:53] year after year
[58:55] but if we don't serve God by faith
[58:59] and then do we worship Him
[59:02] can never please God
[59:07] required
[59:10] God required an innocent life
[59:14] as a substitute
[59:16] in order for the worshiper to be covered
[59:21] but God didn't just require blood
[59:26] he required the first link
[59:30] hello everybody I'm going to say it
[59:32] again he didn't just he didn't just
[59:35] require a lamb
[59:37] the Revelation was that it was the first
[59:40] link
[59:42] and the one that would offer the first
[59:45] link
[59:46] had to be the firstborn
[59:49] you'll understand why I say that in a
[59:52] moment
[59:53] he didn't bring that
[59:56] so many times today
[59:59] we are called upon to give God first
[1:00:02] foreign
[1:00:28] amen this is our Christmas or a
[1:00:31] Christmas present it is
[1:00:34] is a Christmas message
[1:00:37] I don't see where you're going with this
[1:00:40] with Jesus and the and the Shepherds and
[1:00:45] uh
[1:00:46] what are you doing over here
[1:00:50] because you'll never understand
[1:00:53] the New Testament without understanding
[1:01:00] we many times don't give God the first
[1:01:02] which is
[1:01:04] that in itself shows whether we are part
[1:01:09] of the Church of the firstborn or not
[1:01:14] Hello everybody
[1:01:17] we come
[1:01:19] then he must but we don't give God first
[1:01:23] we give him leftovers
[1:01:30] hello everybody hola I'm not saying to
[1:01:33] everybody and all the time I'm just
[1:01:35] saying many times in our lives
[1:01:41] we give him left over time
[1:01:47] yes or no COC
[1:01:49] when we're down and down and we're tired
[1:01:52] oh Lord
[1:01:54] oh okay well I gotta go to bed
[1:01:59] we give him leftover strength
[1:02:04] we give him leftover offerings and
[1:02:06] leftover sacrifices
[1:02:10] but in verse 4 we found that Abel gave
[1:02:13] of the firstlings okay
[1:02:17] revelation
[1:02:31] he knew that even though he was not the
[1:02:34] first to open the womb
[1:02:38] but that the real Birthright
[1:02:42] belong to him through the revelations
[1:02:47] they never had that revelation of what a
[1:02:50] firstborn was
[1:02:53] God was still willing
[1:02:56] to give Cain another chance
[1:03:01] so we see then from here Genesis 4 we
[1:03:04] jump to Genesis 5.
[1:03:09] genealogy chapter
[1:03:12] and we find out that is
[1:03:15] not mentioned in the lineage of Adams hi
[1:03:21] and even in the genealogy in the book of
[1:03:25] lukeas Cain is missing too
[1:03:30] for to God
[1:03:32] Abel was the firstborn
[1:03:35] after his death
[1:03:38] was his replacement
[1:03:40] church this is true worship
[1:03:43] this is what it is to worship God in
[1:03:46] spirit and in truth
[1:03:49] for only a first born
[1:03:53] can recognize the importance
[1:03:56] of giving to God the first
[1:04:00] and only the firstborn is given a
[1:04:03] revelation
[1:04:06] which is a gift from God
[1:04:09] and that's why you see it all the time
[1:04:13] in a church
[1:04:15] why do they have and I don't have it
[1:04:18] I don't know how's your worship
[1:04:23] hello everybody how is your worship
[1:04:28] in the Bible
[1:04:31] the firstborn usually referred to the
[1:04:33] birth order
[1:04:36] but it wasn't always the case
[1:04:40] many times it referred to the
[1:04:46] ranko say it again look at it as the
[1:04:50] birth order
[1:04:54] also referred to the rank
[1:04:59] the firstborn possessed
[1:05:02] double inheritance
[1:05:07] how many Church on the firstborn do we
[1:05:09] have
[1:05:11] the firstborn
[1:05:13] the double portions
[1:05:16] he had the leadership
[1:05:18] he had the authority this is the
[1:05:22] firstborn
[1:05:23] that's why when they would see the older
[1:05:26] brother or the one that was was
[1:05:28] considered the firstborn
[1:05:31] he had great honor in the house
[1:05:36] and he would always receive the largest
[1:05:38] part of the inheritance
[1:05:41] he was the one who succeeded the father
[1:05:46] and everyone else would respect him he
[1:05:49] told us
[1:05:54] so the word term first born
[1:06:00] the preeminent in status
[1:06:04] or he is the closest in relationship to
[1:06:08] the father
[1:06:10] think about this
[1:06:12] who man considers to be the first born
[1:06:18] always who God considers the firstborn
[1:06:23] let's take let's take Abraham from for
[1:06:26] for instance
[1:06:28] the Muslims they say that Ishmael is
[1:06:32] Abraham's first born
[1:06:35] and you argue with them
[1:06:38] you might you might try to argue with
[1:06:41] them but they have a point
[1:06:44] the whole picture but they have a point
[1:06:48] according to the flesh
[1:06:51] yes that was the first that was his
[1:06:55] first child
[1:06:58] ah okay
[1:07:00] Abraham's first born
[1:07:02] and according to the law
[1:07:05] and the inheritance should it be
[1:07:09] Ismail
[1:07:15] according to the flesh
[1:07:17] absolutely absolutely and according to
[1:07:20] the birth order
[1:07:23] but the problem with that
[1:07:26] he came through the wrong room
[1:07:32] I want you to get these types and
[1:07:35] shadows
[1:07:37] notice this now Ishmael came Ismael but
[1:07:41] he came and opened the womb of a bonds
[1:07:44] woman
[1:07:46] this is where we can find ourselves
[1:07:49] today
[1:07:50] so many even if you're if you claim to
[1:07:53] be religious
[1:07:54] what are you opening the womb of a bonds
[1:07:57] woman or of a free woman
[1:08:01] are you are you first born according to
[1:08:04] the bonds woman it is
[1:08:07] first born according to the free woman
[1:08:12] gosh I pray that you get this now is
[1:08:22] but the promised seed was to come
[1:08:24] through the free woman perilous
[1:08:28] was the first to open the womb of Sarah
[1:08:31] the freeway
[1:08:33] think about David
[1:08:36] giving you these examples so you can get
[1:08:38] your mind around
[1:08:42] out of eight boys David was
[1:08:45] what number
[1:08:47] come on
[1:08:49] quietly read your Bible yeah
[1:08:53] I'm going to read your Bible
[1:08:55] okay of eight boys David was what number
[1:09:01] he was the eight he was the youngest
[1:09:05] that's right
[1:09:07] the birthright according to the flesh
[1:09:10] then again
[1:09:18] come on
[1:09:24] see there's there's entry level trivia
[1:09:27] and then there's
[1:09:28] higher level trivia
[1:09:30] we just went up a little bit
[1:09:33] was the oldest son of Jesse Jesse
[1:09:40] aliab exactly good job you got to give
[1:09:44] one to the brother here
[1:09:48] aliab was
[1:09:50] the one who should have gotten the
[1:09:52] birthright
[1:09:53] he was the oldest there of Jesse
[1:09:56] but watch What God Says of David
[1:10:01] Psalms chapter 89 and verse 20.
[1:10:06] this was written by Ethan the Ezra
[1:10:09] Heights
[1:10:12] I have found David my servant
[1:11:02] as we as we see relation
[1:11:31] what about Joseph Jose
[1:11:34] it was the perfect type of Christ
[1:11:38] said there was not one negative thing
[1:11:40] written about Joseph yet
[1:11:45] Joseph wasn't Jacob's first born
[1:11:49] is that right amen
[1:11:51] he wasn't his firstborn yes
[1:11:59] you know your Bible
[1:12:02] because Joseph was the first
[1:12:05] opened the womb of Rachel Gabriola
[1:12:10] I want you to catch these things
[1:12:15] every male that opened at the womb Shall
[1:12:18] be Called holy
[1:12:21] think about Isaac and Rebecca
[1:12:25] she was pregnant and and you talk about
[1:12:28] having morning sickness
[1:12:34] all day sickness
[1:12:39] of poor sisters that have to go through
[1:12:41] this
[1:12:43] she had sickness all day long
[1:12:47] so she got to a place that she couldn't
[1:12:50] take it anymore
[1:12:54] Lord what's going on inside of me
[1:12:59] I believe that every believer feels the
[1:13:02] same way
[1:13:03] what is going on inside of me it seems
[1:13:08] like there's a struggle day in and day
[1:13:10] out
[1:13:11] but what what happened when the
[1:13:14] Revelation came to Earth
[1:13:17] and the Lord revealed what was going on
[1:13:20] in her yes
[1:13:21] you have two nations in thy womb there
[1:13:25] is
[1:13:27] and two manner of people shall be
[1:13:30] separated from thy bowels
[1:13:33] and the one people shall be stronger
[1:13:36] than the other people
[1:13:39] Elders Shall Serve the youngeres
[1:13:44] wow
[1:13:46] here we are first born again
[1:13:48] who was the first born
[1:13:53] oh Isaac and Rebecca Rebecca
[1:13:57] saw was the firstborn absolutely
[1:14:01] but remember here
[1:14:03] the firstborn of my children
[1:14:10] this is the founding Pastor is
[1:14:14] he made it and we give one to our
[1:14:17] founding Pastor back there
[1:14:22] hello Pops
[1:14:25] it's good to have him here with us
[1:14:28] this is what he says
[1:14:30] in other words
[1:14:33] it's written in a book it's Redemption
[1:14:41] in a book of redemption
[1:14:43] now in this book of redemption
[1:14:46] he saw was here
[1:14:49] Esau was in this book is
[1:14:53] because
[1:14:55] that was first born
[1:15:01] according to the book of redemption
[1:15:08] but God
[1:15:10] then was obligated
[1:15:13] because of his law
[1:15:15] he was obligated to redeem Esau
[1:15:21] did you get that
[1:15:23] sir uh I think I lost you okay
[1:15:26] Esau was written in a book
[1:15:30] God by his law he was obligated then to
[1:15:36] redeem
[1:15:37] Isa was there in the book
[1:15:41] now watch what he says here
[1:15:44] he was obligated
[1:15:49] watch carefully
[1:15:51] and then what the Tommy says
[1:15:54] it went over your head
[1:15:57] you must have got the same response
[1:16:16] since they were in the mother's womb
[1:16:20] he had already declared to Rebecca
[1:16:24] he had declared to the church to the
[1:16:28] woman that the older one would serve the
[1:16:32] younger
[1:16:34] oh what a Twist here
[1:16:37] but God couldn't do it
[1:16:41] can't go against his words
[1:16:44] couldn't do it unless that man is
[1:16:57] this is what he says watch it's the look
[1:16:59] oh it gets delicate
[1:17:02] because a lot of people
[1:17:04] you don't realize
[1:17:07] don't sell your Birthright
[1:17:10] Amana you think I got the birthright did
[1:17:13] you sell your Birthright
[1:17:16] and then we'll seek repentance
[1:17:20] and we'll want to come back to God
[1:17:23] it says and then God will just laugh at
[1:17:26] you
[1:17:30] you'll never be able to get to him
[1:17:35] if you sell your Birthright
[1:17:39] so Rebecca knew that under the law of
[1:17:41] God
[1:17:44] that that firstborn got the blessing
[1:17:48] so you can just see a mother
[1:17:52] you know we always ask that question
[1:17:54] right
[1:17:55] who's your favorite foreign
[1:18:27] not anybody in here
[1:18:29] okay so who's your favorite
[1:18:33] better not say it huh
[1:18:39] gotta let that one goes
[1:18:43] she had gotten a revelation
[1:18:45] and you imagine a mother looking at her
[1:18:49] two sons and
[1:18:52] it wasn't just Jacob that was the
[1:18:53] supplantern
[1:18:56] he was working with him
[1:18:58] how do I get him the birthright
[1:19:04] All These Little Things oh they're
[1:19:07] they're great
[1:19:09] so she's planning along with Jacob on
[1:19:12] how they're going to steal the
[1:19:14] birthright
[1:19:18] he was the one that God had made the
[1:19:21] promise to yeah
[1:19:23] in your womb there's two Natures
[1:19:27] but the younger Shall Serve
[1:19:30] so here she is I gotta make it happen
[1:19:35] if we would stay so focused I gotta make
[1:19:38] it happen
[1:19:44] we are number one goal in life
[1:19:50] you haven't been in church very long so
[1:19:53] yeah you don't know yours
[1:19:58] nothing to do with how long you've been
[1:20:01] in church
[1:20:03] closes your relationship with God
[1:20:07] this is what it's about it's about
[1:20:10] getting the birthright
[1:20:13] get your hands on it
[1:20:15] don't you let it go for nothing
[1:20:18] don't sell it for a million billion
[1:20:21] dollars
[1:20:22] if you give it up for anything the world
[1:20:25] has to offer
[1:20:27] get a hold of this bird
[1:20:32] I've noticed this now
[1:20:35] why would she do such a thing
[1:20:38] because she had a revelation
[1:20:41] and she understood the importance of the
[1:20:44] birthright
[1:20:46] but you'll only see the importance
[1:20:48] through the promise
[1:20:51] this is why she favored Jacob over over
[1:20:54] Esau what is this
[1:21:01] for though Esau was the first to open
[1:21:04] her womb okay
[1:21:07] God's predestination could not fail the
[1:21:10] president
[1:21:12] sells his Birthright to his younger
[1:21:14] brother we know that is
[1:21:21] that's right because the birthright
[1:21:24] didn't mean nothing to him no no no
[1:21:27] significance
[1:21:33] did you get that Birthright meant
[1:21:35] nothing to him at that point
[1:21:38] then why did he become angry like Kane
[1:21:44] and wanted to go after Jacob and kill
[1:21:46] him
[1:21:48] he realized how important the birthright
[1:21:52] is
[1:21:56] so important
[1:21:58] nothing else should matter
[1:22:01] but all these testimonies and stories
[1:22:04] that we find
[1:22:06] only pointing to one that was coming
[1:22:11] and under the inspiration
[1:22:15] Isaiah began to prophesy here we go
[1:22:20] to prophesy and he says behold a virgin
[1:22:24] shall conceived
[1:22:28] oh I'm going to say this again in
[1:22:30] another way
[1:22:32] a virgin's womb shall be opened
[1:22:37] by Emmanuel foreign
[1:23:02] you finally I think you're awake now and
[1:23:04] I'm I'm starting to feel you pull a
[1:23:06] little bit okay
[1:23:08] and here we find out in Luke 2 4 and
[1:23:11] Joseph also went up From Galilee out of
[1:23:14] the city of Nazareth and to Judea unto
[1:23:16] the city of David which is called
[1:23:17] Bethlehem because he was the house of
[1:23:20] the house and lineage of David
[1:23:22] is
[1:23:31] to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife
[1:23:34] being great with child
[1:23:42] and so it was that while they were there
[1:23:45] the days were accomplished that she
[1:23:48] should be delivered
[1:23:53] here we go and she brought forth her
[1:23:58] first sonito
[1:24:08] oh brother Branham says in why it had to
[1:24:11] be Shepherds
[1:24:14] oh the story is so great
[1:24:18] can you tell your neighbor right now oh
[1:24:21] neighbors
[1:24:23] story is so great
[1:24:26] that it goes over the head of so many
[1:24:29] questions
[1:24:31] to think little Jehovah
[1:24:35] laying in a Manger
[1:24:38] he had to live like a baby
[1:24:41] little Jehovah borned in a stable
[1:24:45] little Jehovah playing with children on
[1:24:48] the streets
[1:24:50] little Jehovah the teenager
[1:24:54] little Jehovah the school boy
[1:24:58] and Jehovah the mighty
[1:25:03] oh yes you took all these places
[1:25:14] and you become all of this
[1:25:19] suffer the penalty of sins
[1:25:24] to give us eternal life
[1:25:27] in other words to redeem us
[1:25:30] what a gift to the world
[1:25:34] greatest gift God ever gave to man
[1:25:39] so great was the life of our Lord Jesus
[1:25:42] Christ
[1:25:44] that the whole Bible was written of him
[1:25:49] so great was the life of our Lord Jesus
[1:25:52] Christ
[1:25:54] that even his genealogy was written
[1:25:57] three times in the New Testament in
[1:26:03] can you imagine the first one
[1:26:07] let me tell you who he is
[1:26:09] this is the book of the generations of
[1:26:12] Jesus Christ
[1:26:16] all the way to Joseph and it finishes
[1:26:20] with whom was born Jesus
[1:26:25] Jesus who is called right Cristo and
[1:26:29] that wasn't enough yes so Luke starts to
[1:26:33] pen the genealogy
[1:26:37] now from Joseph
[1:26:40] all the way back the regresso forward
[1:26:52] and he finishes with which was the son
[1:26:55] of Adam it was the son of God
[1:26:59] but then John begins to
[1:27:02] pen his genealogy
[1:27:06] and he goes back before Adam
[1:27:10] he goes back to the very beginning
[1:27:14] he says in the beginning was the words
[1:27:24] he not only is the first born
[1:27:29] Hallelujah I'm gonna say it again he not
[1:27:32] only has the birthright
[1:27:35] he is the birthright
[1:27:38] come on church I'm going to say it again
[1:27:40] he not only has the birthright
[1:27:43] he is the birthright
[1:27:45] you receive him as your personal savior
[1:27:50] into his church
[1:27:54] which is the Church of the firstbornitos
[1:27:58] watch how important this is to us
[1:28:02] Luke 2 21-23 and we read this all the
[1:28:06] time when we dedicate babe Lucas
[1:28:12] and when eight days were accomplished
[1:28:14] for the circumcision of the child
[1:28:16] his name was called Jesus which was so
[1:28:18] named of the Angel before he was
[1:28:20] conceived in the womb
[1:28:24] Jesus
[1:28:29] and when the days of our purification
[1:28:31] according to the law of Moses were
[1:28:33] accomplished they brought him to
[1:28:34] Jerusalem to present him to the Lord
[1:28:50] Shall be Called holy to the Lord
[1:28:57] the Bible tells us in John 3 16 that he
[1:29:01] was the only begotten of the father
[1:29:05] and through him the birthright was now
[1:29:10] extended to you and I
[1:29:12] did yes or yes
[1:29:18] oh I gotta say that again through him
[1:29:20] the birthright was extended to you and I
[1:29:24] did
[1:29:29] you mean to tell me that the birthright
[1:29:31] could be extended to someone else
[1:29:35] Romans 8 29. romance
[1:29:39] whom he did foreign
[1:30:17] what is this Birthright
[1:30:19] that we say you got to get it
[1:30:22] somebody tell me your young people
[1:30:32] anybody help me out here
[1:30:38] it goes with it
[1:30:41] what is this birthday okay some parents
[1:30:43] want to help
[1:30:49] it's very simple Yes move it simply
[1:30:52] he says what is the birthright
[1:30:54] it's the right
[1:30:57] I'm telling you
[1:31:00] the holy spirit is your Birthright
[1:31:05] that's your god-given right
[1:31:12] that Holy Ghost ought to be more
[1:31:14] important than anything else in the
[1:31:16] world
[1:31:18] more important than your prestige
[1:31:22] then your life than your job
[1:31:25] everything else
[1:31:27] you should not seize until you got it
[1:31:32] then to receive the Holy Ghost is to
[1:31:35] receive your Birthright
[1:31:40] okay okay everybody in agreement with me
[1:31:45] let me ask you a question
[1:31:49] how do you receive salvation salvation
[1:31:55] thank you
[1:31:56] how do you receive the Holy Ghost Santo
[1:32:07] wow we got a lot of we got a lot of
[1:32:11] and there's there's all parts of the
[1:32:12] puzzle
[1:32:15] how do you receive your healing
[1:32:21] did you know
[1:32:22] that the same way you receive your
[1:32:25] healing is
[1:32:27] the same way you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:32:30] it's the same way you receive salvation
[1:32:32] Salvation yes or yes
[1:32:35] this is the problem today
[1:32:38] we come to the Altar and we raise our
[1:32:41] hands
[1:32:44] Lord give me the Holy Ghost
[1:32:47] we think that it just comes like that
[1:32:52] it's a Pentecostal idea
[1:32:54] there is an order away that God has
[1:32:57] placed
[1:32:59] you to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:33:01] for you to receive the birthright
[1:33:05] to do it
[1:33:08] people do not want to go that way
[1:33:13] I'm going to tell you what it is you
[1:33:16] want to know how to receive the holy
[1:33:17] ghosts
[1:33:20] your Birthright
[1:33:27] it's the same way
[1:33:29] go and see what brother Brandon has this
[1:33:31] is
[1:33:37] in the message at Thy word Lord
[1:33:41] you'll never
[1:33:43] be safe
[1:33:48] how many you have the Holy Ghost
[1:33:52] you believe it yeah how many of you are
[1:33:55] saved salvos
[1:33:59] this is this is the prophet of God now
[1:34:01] it is
[1:34:02] you'll never be safe
[1:34:06] I don't care how hard you try you'll
[1:34:10] never be safe
[1:34:11] and receive the Holy Ghost
[1:34:15] unless giving you the answer here
[1:34:19] and nobody wants this answer
[1:34:22] that's why Satan is so adamant of
[1:34:26] stopping preachers foreign
[1:36:00] and then he says isn't that right it's a
[1:36:03] question
[1:36:06] to believe the word
[1:36:08] the word of God and the man that's
[1:36:11] preaching it
[1:36:13] isn't that right
[1:36:15] you want to receive your healing
[1:36:18] it's the same process
[1:36:21] believe God's word by his stripes and
[1:36:23] you are healed
[1:36:25] and believe the one that's preaching it
[1:36:28] to you
[1:36:29] if I were to say by his stripes you're
[1:36:31] healed how many people are sick
[1:36:41] then stand to your feet
[1:36:46] and do you believe me as I'm telling you
[1:36:50] can receive your healing in Jesus name
[1:36:55] it's not hard noise not to believe who
[1:36:59] God has
[1:37:01] is
[1:37:11] our sister back here no sir Tina I'm
[1:37:14] sorry to put you on the spot
[1:37:17] your family's been talking to her for
[1:37:20] many years
[1:37:22] I came over the other day and we talked
[1:37:24] to her yeah
[1:37:26] believe me
[1:37:28] apparently she does
[1:37:31] maybe next week I think she's going to
[1:37:33] be getting baptized
[1:37:36] that's how simple salvation is
[1:37:40] the one he has sent to unto you
[1:37:43] want the birthright
[1:37:46] leave it from the lips
[1:37:48] of someone that is preaching
[1:37:52] that has the birthright
[1:37:55] we've got something to give the people
[1:38:00] we don't go out and preach and hope that
[1:38:02] something happens
[1:38:04] is
[1:38:18] oh my time is up already I just have
[1:38:22] this like like 10 minutes
[1:38:24] just just a little bit okay
[1:38:27] and then we'll go to the next part of
[1:38:29] this service
[1:38:31] just get a little comfortable
[1:38:35] foreign
[1:39:09] all right that's right the body of Jesus
[1:39:12] wasn't God and quickly that body had a
[1:39:14] beginning
[1:39:17] that body opened up the wounds
[1:39:22] because the seed must be planted in the
[1:39:25] Earth
[1:39:27] but watch
[1:39:29] it sounds like
[1:39:31] the firstborn of every creature
[1:39:35] it sounds like he is a created being
[1:39:40] but when you when you rightly divide the
[1:39:43] word
[1:39:45] when it's saying here that he's the
[1:39:47] firstborn it is
[1:39:51] that he has the authorities
[1:39:55] he has the Dominion in El dominio over
[1:39:59] every creature
[1:40:01] oh
[1:40:03] oh he's just the firstborn now he's he's
[1:40:06] just like in watch it oh no the word
[1:40:10] I'm gonna take away the Divine part of
[1:40:13] it all
[1:40:14] apart
[1:40:16] he is he has the authority
[1:40:21] over every creature or by him we're all
[1:40:26] things created
[1:40:29] invisible and invisible whether they be
[1:40:32] Thrones or dominions or principalities
[1:40:34] or Powers
[1:40:36] I'm coming around the corner he's going
[1:40:39] to finish this up and then and then
[1:40:40] we'll ask the choir yes
[1:40:45] all right
[1:40:48] they're coming into the real estate
[1:40:53] they're coming into the firstborn
[1:40:57] who is coming into the real
[1:41:02] the sons of God
[1:41:04] that's born of the spirit of God
[1:41:08] out of every denomination under Heaven

[1:41:15] 22-23 says
[1:41:18] he or come unto Mount Zion
[1:41:23] city of the Living God
