[47:09] please want to make myself a note and
[47:11] write the time down I want to stay
[47:13] within the a lotted am of time
[47:16] that and as we're looking for our
[47:20] scripture want to brother Caleb brother
[47:24] Tommy thank you for your confidence and
[47:25] this opportunity to stand behind the
[47:27] sacred
[47:31] pulpit and uh it is truly an
[47:35] honor I'm going to read this the the
[47:38] book of Titus uh chapter 2 verse 13
[47:41] first and then we're also going to read
[47:43] the book of First
[47:47] Thessalonians the fourth
[47:49] chapter vers 16 and
[47:54] 17
[47:56] the book of Titus
[47:59] first and thank God that they have it on
[48:01] the screen for
[48:03] me and as we're standing in reverence to
[48:05] the
[48:08] word Paul writes to Titus and he says
[48:12] looking for that blessed hope can
[48:14] somebody say blessed
[48:16] hope amen blessed
[48:23] hope and the Glorious appearance
[48:28] of the great
[48:29] God and our savior
[48:32] Jesus amen you may be seated thank you
[48:35] for your reverence unto the word thank
[48:37] you so
[48:39] much in this verse is where we find the
[48:42] title to our message blessed
[48:49] hope now we want to go to go first 1
[48:51] Thessalonians 4: 16 17
[48:54] please
[49:02] first Thessalonians there we go thank
[49:05] you you follow along if you have your
[49:07] scripture you can say
[49:11] amen and before I read this scripture
[49:13] let me ask this question if I may
[49:16] please a few three four months back I
[49:19] asked the young people in the music
[49:24] room how many books in the New
[49:31] Testament they're like oh I'll give you
[49:34] a clue there's 39 in the Old Testament
[49:38] so how many do we have in the new
[49:45] test can you answer that how
[49:50] many 27 do you agree okay we have an
[49:54] agreement now how how many Epistles do
[49:56] we have in the New
[50:00] Testament we just read from one of those
[50:03] Epistles amen we just read from one of
[50:06] those Epistles Paul writing to
[50:09] Titus someone else's
[50:13] mail yes we
[50:16] are we can learn something by reading
[50:18] somebody else's
[50:24] mail now if 21 Epistles the Apostle Paul
[50:27] receives credit for writing how
[50:37] many I hope we can learn a little bit
[50:39] something today or or take something
[50:41] take something with
[50:43] us and later on when you're having a
[50:44] conversation with somebody oh you know
[50:46] what brother Jacob said
[50:48] that 21
[50:51] epist and the Apostle Paul receives
[50:54] credit
[50:57] writing 133 of
[50:59] those so now he's writing to the
[51:01] Thessalonians wrote to them
[51:05] twice amen so chapter 4 verse 16 and
[51:10] 17 and 16 reads in this manner for the
[51:14] Lord himself shall descend from
[51:17] heaven with a
[51:20] shout with the voice of the
[51:24] archangel and with the Trump of
[51:28] God and the dead in Christ shall rise
[51:43] first verse 17
[51:49] please then we shall then we which are
[51:53] alive and remain come on shall be caught
[51:57] up together with them in the clouds to
[52:02] meet the Lord in the
[52:16] air and so shall we ever be with the
[52:19] Lord now I want to back up real quickly
[52:21] here before we continue to the book of
[52:23] this Titus
[52:27] and I'm going to reread it
[52:29] again please go back with me to the book
[52:31] of
[52:33] Titus verse
[52:37] 13 looking for that blessed
[52:45] hope okay we're looking for the Blessed
[52:51] hope and it's around the
[52:54] corner
[52:56] Christ is coming for his
[52:59] bride now we need to make emphasis on
[53:03] this the Blessed
[53:07] hope is one
[53:09] event is one
[53:12] event and the second part of
[53:16] it is the Glorious
[53:21] appearing we're going to have the
[53:23] Rapture of the church
[53:26] that's our blessed
[53:28] home we're going
[53:30] home we're going
[53:34] home brother Caleb now I know why you
[53:36] ask sometimes doesn't that exite
[53:40] you doesn't that excite
[53:43] you we're going

[54:48] night
[54:50] event that represents a spiritual
[54:54] truth
[54:55] you with me
[54:58] good we have three prime examples in the
[55:02] scriptures in the Book of Genesis 5
[55:05] verse
[55:16] 266 I think I wrote down the wrong
[55:18] scripture please forgive
[55:20] me let me just mention
[55:23] it that's okay
[55:27] we remember the story of
[55:30] Enoch amen amen a man that walked with
[55:37] God and what happened to
[55:40] him he is a type of the church he is a
[55:44] type of the
[55:45] Bride that she's going to walk with
[55:48] God and she's going to
[55:52] disappear she's going to find herself in
[55:55] immediately in that Dimension with
[56:00] God Enoch is a type of the
[56:06] Bride
[56:08] Elijah what happened to
[56:11] Elijah did he see
[56:14] death no no some of us will not see
[56:20] death I love what the Spanish Bible says
[56:22] I had to bring sor
[56:26] I'm so used to this Bible right
[56:30] here surely we shall not all sleep
[56:36] am that's what Paul told the
[56:39] Corinthians surely we shall not all
[56:43] sleep but we shall all be
[56:46] changed and a
[56:48] twinkling twinkling High Glory doesn't
[56:51] that excite
[56:52] you are you ready I'm ready I'm ready to

[57:40] going going home and again if you don't

[57:53] personal
[57:56] and if you've been serving God for 20 or
[57:58] 30 or 40 or 50
[58:01] years your walk with the Lord is not in

[58:14] third
[58:16] example can we read this one please in
[58:18] the Book of Revelations 4 verse 1 and
[58:21] two but the key verse is verse
[58:23] two
[58:32] here's John the
[58:34] Apostle also known as John the
[58:40] Theologian and we
[58:43] uh we tend to think sometimes
[58:47] that someone is alone while they're
[58:53] lonely
[58:55] but sometimes when you're
[58:58] alone God can talk to
[59:02] you John found himself alone in the
[59:04] island of
[59:08] patmas he was probably looking over the
[59:12] waters there's all my brothers at the
[59:15] synagogue praising and worshiping oh
[59:18] there's all the brothers
[59:20] Hills Hills but you know what God came
[59:24] down and revealed
[59:26] himself GL to God and this is what he
[59:31] writes are you with me amen here we go
[59:34] am after this I
[59:37] looked I looked and behold a door was
[59:42] opened in heaven and the first voice
[59:46] which I
[59:47] heard was as it were of a
[59:50] trumpet talking with me which said
[59:55] wo come up
[59:57] hither and I will show thee things which
[1:00:01] must be here
[1:00:21] after verse two please
[1:00:25] this is our key verse
[1:00:27] here and before I read this verse I I I
[1:00:30] need to I I need to explain something
[1:00:32] real
[1:00:34] quick in my English Bible and as you can
[1:00:38] see up on the
[1:00:42] screen it uses the word
[1:00:47] immediately and in Spanish right below
[1:00:49] it it
[1:00:53] says I went in
[1:00:57] spirit see the
[1:01:02] difference so now let me read it now
[1:01:05] here's the third example of the church
[1:01:06] being taken away you ready to be taken
[1:01:10] away to be ready because it's going to
[1:01:12] be of an
[1:01:15] eye and we used to sing another song
[1:01:17] when we were we were
[1:01:19] children and I'm sorry I got to go into
[1:01:21] Spanish
[1:01:23] again
[1:01:25] it's just like
[1:01:27] lightning just like the
[1:01:32] lightning that's the way the coming of
[1:01:34] the Lord will be and I was a little
[1:01:37] kid that's why I was as a little kid
[1:01:39] singing but now I understand
[1:01:43] it he's going to come so
[1:01:45] quickly you're not going to have time to
[1:01:47] run to Cedar
[1:01:50] Hills
[1:01:52] Caleb or call Brother Tommy
[1:01:56] me he's going to be like a
[1:01:59] lightning he going to take his church
[1:02:04] away think about it for a
[1:02:08] moment just like the
[1:02:10] lightning that's the coming of the Lord
[1:02:13] and
[1:02:15] immediately I was in the
[1:02:19] spirit and
[1:02:22] behold a throne was set in heaven
[1:02:26] on
[1:02:28] theone I want to focus on that word
[1:02:30] immediately just for a
[1:02:33] second Enoch was taken and immediately
[1:02:35] in the presence of the
[1:02:39] Lord Elijah was taken away in the Sherry
[1:02:41] did not see

[1:03:40] God is offering it to
[1:03:44] you so John the
[1:03:47] Theologian
[1:03:49] immediately another type of the church
[1:03:53] immediately being
[1:03:56] taken and finding herself in the
[1:03:58] dimension of
[1:04:01] God imagine there he is and
[1:04:05] immediately finds himself in the
[1:04:09] presence we will immediately find
[1:04:11] ourselves in the
[1:04:14] presence going to go from one dimension

[1:21:11] me trust
[1:21:13] me only he knows the patience that he
[1:21:16] has had with
[1:21:18] me and I see say this to relax myself is
[1:21:22] is
[1:21:25] it is something important to
[1:21:31] know it is a small testimony I want to
[1:21:34] give when I was
[1:21:37] young I lost my father when I was very
[1:21:41] young I I don't want to say I lost
[1:21:45] him he just went home when I was
[1:21:51] young he met brother brother Tommy
[1:21:57] Sor there in the 90s the
[1:22:02] 80s and I was telling this
[1:22:09] testimony and this testimony gives me
[1:22:11] life it fills me with
[1:22:15] joy because we can say with
[1:22:19] gladness hether to have the Lord helped
[1:22:21] us
[1:22:24] being my father
[1:22:28] sick he lost the
[1:22:31] the motion of half of his
[1:22:35] face which was a facial
[1:22:39] paralysis of course we were all
[1:22:41] worried we didn't know what to
[1:22:45] do so we went to church that
[1:22:51] time brother Tommy senior was was
[1:22:56] preaching but his way of preaching was
[1:22:58] so
[1:22:59] special and I believe that you all knew
[1:23:04] it he went it it happened the same thing
[1:23:07] that one time we
[1:23:10] went when he was
[1:23:17] preaching he didn't say very uh things
[1:23:20] in a in a big way
[1:23:23] and this is the the the part that I want
[1:23:25] to call your attention
[1:23:29] to that we call the words by the
[1:23:34] word we call things into existence by
[1:23:36] the
[1:23:37] word nobody told me about it nobody told
[1:23:41] me about it I was
[1:23:44] there I saw
[1:23:46] it when brother Tommy was
[1:23:50] preaching at half of the preaching
[1:23:54] he only raised his
[1:23:56] eyes and he saw a man that was in his
[1:24:01] wheelchair and he he was preaching and
[1:24:04] he was saying what can I say about faith
[1:24:06] what is
[1:24:07] faith is like if I say if like if I
[1:24:12] say rise up name of the Lord Jesus
[1:24:15] Christ and walk and the
[1:24:19] man after more being more than
[1:24:23] in a
[1:24:24] wheelchair he started
[1:24:27] walking it was half of the
[1:24:29] service that is the
[1:24:32] god I want to talk to you
[1:24:35] about being my father on the
[1:24:38] balcony and it looked like there wasn't
[1:24:41] any the doctors had
[1:24:44] said you have to take a
[1:24:48] process and because of your
[1:24:51] condition because he had
[1:24:53] diabetes they said you might be healed
[1:24:56] you might not be healed but that's what
[1:24:59] man said but God
[1:25:03] is in
[1:25:05] Mercy when brother tell me Wasing God in
[1:25:09] flesh God in
[1:25:11] flesh at half of the
[1:25:14] preaching he just turned to look at my
[1:25:16] father and he said demon let
[1:25:20] him in the name of Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:25:23] at an instant right away his face it was
[1:25:27] like if nothing
[1:25:30] happened my father couldn't even drink a
[1:25:32] bottle of
[1:25:34] water when he drank water the water
[1:25:38] would would come
[1:25:39] out that was a bad
[1:25:43] condition my my father said everything
[1:25:46] is all
[1:25:47] right and the greatest sign he said give
[1:25:50] me water he drank water and he finished
[1:25:54] the
[1:25:55] bottle glory to the name of the Lord
[1:25:58] Jesus Christ that
[1:26:00] God that God that we just read he was
[1:26:04] right in front the people of
[1:26:07] Israel the people of
[1:26:09] Israel they had come from a problem that
[1:26:13] they had
[1:26:14] had for more than 20
[1:26:16] years they were they were
[1:26:21] subjected
[1:26:22] under the Dominion of the
[1:26:25] Philistines and if you can read the the
[1:26:27] part that
[1:26:28] is you you can go home and read it
[1:26:31] you're going to
[1:26:34] find how they were
[1:26:36] afraid and they even said to the prophet
[1:26:41] cry and pray for
[1:26:44] us but they
[1:26:47] knew that they had left
[1:26:50] God then look at the important
[1:26:53] part a prophet Rises
[1:26:56] up bring it to the present time
[1:27:00] us we also have a prophet with
[1:27:03] God that raises up a stone that raises
[1:27:07] up re Revelation and and he draws a a
[1:27:11] path he draws a
[1:27:14] line between Mis and and Shan and he
[1:27:19] said the Lord has helped us so far
[1:27:23] ebenzer
[1:27:24] now the word
[1:27:27] until it marks the limit of a
[1:27:32] time is the final space of a time
[1:27:36] until the hither
[1:27:39] to and the question is since
[1:27:43] when that's when you and I come into the
[1:27:47] scene bring it to your personal
[1:27:51] life hether too had the Lord helped us
[1:27:54] until this day this time this
[1:27:59] space this
[1:28:02] moment this
[1:28:06] season has never left us
[1:28:09] alone the people of Israel they have
[1:28:11] forgotten they have
[1:28:15] forgotten great and glorious Wonders
[1:28:17] that the Lord has
[1:28:18] performed the Lord had fought their
[1:28:21] battle and at this
[1:28:24] time the people of Israel didn't
[1:28:27] even to do anything because God with a
[1:28:29] thunder he's scared he's
[1:28:33] scared and he defeated the
[1:28:35] Philistines now that same
[1:28:38] God with you
[1:28:40] tonight the same
[1:28:42] God that scared the
[1:28:45] Philistines is to
[1:28:47] defeat the Giants that you have in front
[1:28:49] of
[1:28:50] you just with the word St with the word
[1:28:54] this evening hither to it it means a
[1:28:58] limit of time now think about
[1:29:02] it how many how many things has the Lord
[1:29:05] has the Lord done for us he has done
[1:29:07] many things for
[1:29:09] us why are we
[1:29:11] here for your own
[1:29:13] strength for your own
[1:29:16] ability for how good you are
[1:29:20] never for the of the
[1:29:23] lord we haven't been
[1:29:25] consumed because his
[1:29:28] mercies are new every
[1:29:31] morning and great is his faithfulness
[1:29:34] how many can say
[1:29:36] Amen if the Lord is with us why should
[1:29:40] we
[1:29:42] fear but now we have it's our
[1:29:47] duty it's like the book of Lamentations
[1:29:49] 3:40 says we're going to read it
[1:29:53] together let us
[1:29:56] search Let us look
[1:29:59] upon upon our
[1:30:01] ways let us
[1:30:04] look let us
[1:30:06] search let us
[1:30:08] search and turn again to the
[1:30:10] Lord not to the
[1:30:13] man not to the
[1:30:15] person not to the church but to God to
[1:30:20] God the only one
[1:30:23] the only one who
[1:30:25] deserves all honor and Glory all
[1:30:29] praise honor
[1:30:32] power and
[1:30:35] Majesty glory to his
[1:30:38] name the Lord is
[1:30:41] worthy the word of God says
[1:30:45] Revelation 15 verse
[1:30:49] three great and marvelous
[1:30:52] thy
[1:30:53] Work Lord God
[1:30:59] Almighty doesn't it make you be
[1:31:03] happy doesn't it make you know that God
[1:31:06] is with
[1:31:07] you God is with
[1:31:09] you why are you
[1:31:11] suffering why are you
[1:31:14] worrying everything is in his
[1:31:17] hands the Bible says let us
[1:31:20] search and let us
[1:31:24] turn but there's a way to turn unto the
[1:31:27] Lord
[1:31:28] again there's a way you want to know it
[1:31:32] how many want to know the
[1:31:35] way it's not all of us how many want to
[1:31:37] know the
[1:31:39] way so now it's
[1:31:41] majority because if we don't have a
[1:31:43] majority here we cannot
[1:31:46] go but since we have a majority here
[1:31:49] let's go to the scripture
[1:31:52] so the Bible can tell
[1:31:53] us how we have to search for it and turn
[1:31:57] to the
[1:32:00] Lord 2 Chronicles chapter
[1:32:13] 7 three days
[1:32:15] ago I was talking to my
[1:32:18] brother my brother has been going
[1:32:20] through very difficult times and he was
[1:32:23] telling
[1:32:25] me while I'm waiting upon the
[1:32:28] Lord I said you're a
[1:32:31] liar because God is waiting for
[1:32:35] you but then we're making the word a
[1:32:38] liar the Bible
[1:32:40] says
[1:32:42] revelation behold I am I am at the door
[1:32:49] and I'm
[1:32:50] knocking
[1:32:53] I cannot be waiting on
[1:32:55] God God is waiting for
[1:32:58] me we're going to see how the Lord is
[1:33:01] waiting for
[1:33:03] us 2 Chronicles chapter
[1:33:14] 7 verse 14 If my people which are called
[1:33:18] by my name shall humble
[1:33:20] themselves
[1:33:22] if they shall humble
[1:33:25] themselves which are called by my name
[1:33:29] and
[1:33:31] pray and seek my
[1:33:33] face and turn from their Wicked
[1:33:36] Ways How many things are they four
[1:33:40] things who can tell me those things
[1:33:44] humbleness
[1:33:46] prayer write it down humbleness
[1:33:50] prayer stick my face and what does it
[1:33:54] say to
[1:33:56] turn probably you're already humble and
[1:33:59] glory to God for
[1:34:01] that but if you don't add
[1:34:04] the nothing's going to
[1:34:08] happen you can pray a lot and that's
[1:34:12] good GL God for your
[1:34:14] prayer but don't stop doing
[1:34:17] it but add the next
[1:34:20] ingredient look for
[1:34:23] If my people humble
[1:34:25] themselves and
[1:34:28] pray speak my
[1:34:32] face and turn from the wed
[1:34:35] way that the most important
[1:34:38] part God
[1:34:41] needs of attitude from
[1:34:48] us you cannot have the same attitude all
[1:34:50] your life
[1:34:52] either you love God you love your his
[1:34:55] people hither
[1:34:57] tother to
[1:35:03] to when it says had the Lord helped us

[1:35:35] is not good I'm not going to preach like
[1:35:39] that from now on he
[1:35:42] said that was the brother Tommy that I
[1:35:45] knew he said I want the husband and the
[1:35:50] wife to sitting together why because now

[1:40:56] power we're going to be closing with
[1:41:00] this book of
[1:41:05] Isaiah we're gonna see Isaiah chapter
[1:41:09] 12 and then we're goingon to see the
[1:41:11] other
[1:41:13] scripture Isaiah chapter
[1:41:16] 12 that is a commandment for
[1:41:19] us
[1:41:21] we already have his glory his
[1:41:25] miracles and what what is his glory for
[1:41:28] the
[1:41:29] Miracles we all have it
[1:41:33] here is it to hide it under
[1:41:36] something to keep it here where nobody
[1:41:40] can see
[1:41:42] it where nobody can can know about it

[1:42:00] it it's for you to
[1:42:02] tell to
[1:42:04] Proclaim his
[1:42:06] glory saved
[1:42:12] you go with the
[1:42:17] standard by
[1:42:19] Grace walk
[1:42:22] with the
[1:42:23] ban you were
[1:42:25] sick now you are
[1:42:27] healed for the glory of God I believe
[1:42:30] that all
[1:42:33] one we have suffered some
[1:42:37] sickness that sickness hasn't left with
[1:42:39] medicine it
[1:42:41] helps but God brings the
[1:42:45] healing and Isaiah 12
[1:42:48] says verse 4
[1:42:53] it
[1:42:54] says and in that day you shall
[1:42:57] say praise the
[1:43:01] Lord call upon his
[1:43:06] name declare his doing among the
[1:43:10] people is to make
[1:43:12] known to
[1:43:15] declare to tell the people his works and
[1:43:18] then it says make
[1:43:22] mention that his name is
[1:43:25] exalted if you don't know
[1:43:27] it put it to
[1:43:29] test then only to the name to the name
[1:43:35] of the Lord Jesus
[1:43:36] Christ Satan
[1:43:42] trembles take the sword by by the
[1:43:45] handle and see how
[1:43:49] Satan he might come with many
[1:43:52] things and you only
[1:43:55] need you only need to say I don't have
[1:43:57] anything but I'm an ambassador and I
[1:44:01] come in the name which is above all name
[1:44:06] the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:44:08] Christ the one who defeated you on
[1:44:11] Calvary and by that name you're going to
[1:44:15] leave in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:44:17] Christ that's his name
[1:44:23] exalted 1 Chronicles
[1:44:30] 2911 1 Chronicles
[1:44:34] 2911 as you find
[1:44:36] it the prophet
[1:44:39] says message Hebrews chapter
[1:44:43] 4 September 1st
[1:44:48] 1957 why did God lead the people of is
[1:44:50] Israel to Bitter
[1:44:53] Waters looks like he could have led him
[1:44:55] to a good
[1:44:57] water but he led him to Bitter
[1:45:01] Waters so he could prove their
[1:45:04] faith he likes to do
[1:45:09] it he likes to let tribulations come
[1:45:12] upon you to
[1:45:14] show that he can do it that he can do
[1:45:19] it
[1:45:21] tribulation that is in front of
[1:45:24] you he let it he lets it happen he lets
[1:45:29] itom but the prophet says in message
[1:45:34] Shalom my time my time is
[1:45:37] in I am
[1:45:39] his I am in his
[1:45:41] hand because he controls
[1:45:44] time I don't know the
[1:45:47] future but I know who controls the
[1:45:50] future
[1:45:51] and that's what's
[1:45:52] important then Isaiah
[1:45:56] says first Chronicles I'm
[1:46:04] sorry the word of the Lord reads like
[1:46:07] this David is praying please
[1:46:15] stand and we're going to be closing with

[1:59:23] [Music]
[1:59:26] I have a
[1:59:29] testimony all the way from
[1:59:31] Uganda Uganda says a few days back our
[1:59:35] daughter Deborah got her both knees
[1:59:44] dislocated and it was too painful for
[1:59:48] her the doctors told her the only option
[1:59:51] was to do surgery on both
[1:59:56] knees it was a shock to us and I
[1:59:59] informed buddy Thomas about it and and I
[2:00:01] sent our prayer request to our
[2:00:07] pastor to our pastor
[2:00:10] Caleb I informed him about the doctor's
[2:00:15] report and it will take to do the
[2:00:18] surgery
[2:00:20] meanwhile when we left the
[2:00:25] hospital they had promised to give us
[2:00:27] the final the final invoice to know the
[2:00:31] total cost or the estimate which was
[2:00:34] very
[2:00:40] expensive but somehow when my wife kept
[2:00:43] calling the doctor she couldn't pick the
[2:00:46] calls and even reply the messages yeah
[2:00:55] this made us think of trying another
[2:01:00] hospital we went to another hospital and
[2:01:03] met a prominent doctor in our
[2:01:09] country and he recommended surgery but
[2:01:12] it was too
[2:01:16] expensive it was on this day after
[2:01:18] reaching home I received a call from our
[2:01:20] pastor
[2:01:24] Caleb he had never called me since he
[2:01:27] received the information requesting for
[2:01:29] the
[2:01:32] prayer but when he called one thing he
[2:01:35] told me after narrating
[2:01:40] everything that we were going through he
[2:01:42] said brother
[2:01:43] Julius
[2:01:45] Julius time has come to believe in
[2:01:48] Divine Healing
[2:01:51] our God is the
[2:01:53] Healer this is what he told
[2:01:56] me the Lord has always used him to stand
[2:01:59] with us in many
[2:02:02] ways whether it needs money but this
[2:02:05] time surprisingly he he talked of other
[2:02:08] needs and for Deborah he mentioned
[2:02:10] nothing about financial help but rather
[2:02:13] Divine
[2:02:17] help
[2:02:20] just after talking to him I got a call
[2:02:23] from one of my
[2:02:27] friends and told me of some other
[2:02:30] Orthopedic
[2:02:34] Hospital we decided to go there when we
[2:02:37] were we were the first to meet the
[2:02:42] doctor and she assessed our daughter and
[2:02:45] for the first time we heard a statement
[2:02:48] from the doctor she will not need
[2:02:50] surgery
[2:02:55] now we will explore other options first
[2:02:58] until after six months she
[2:03:04] said oh you can't imagine the joy we
[2:03:07] felt in our
[2:03:10] hearts it was like an angel from the
[2:03:13] Lord talking to
[2:03:15] us this doctor we learned later she had
[2:03:18] come from India two days
[2:03:24] back coming back home I called Pastor
[2:03:27] Caleb to tell him what the Lord had done
[2:03:29] for
[2:03:33] us then he says well brother
[2:03:37] Julius I felt led of the Lord not to
[2:03:39] send money for the
[2:03:43] surgery I knew the Lord was going to do
[2:03:47] something and he says if you can believe
[2:03:52] me your daughter will not need
[2:03:57] surgery the Lord will make those bones
[2:03:59] grow
[2:04:02] right that settled
[2:04:05] it I have always believed the word from
[2:04:08] his
[2:04:10] servant that is the Lord's
[2:04:13] report we believe now for our
[2:04:17] daughter who do you say this
[2:04:20] is glory to God my heart is
[2:04:27] Overjoyed friends our God is so
[2:04:31] gracious the great
[2:04:33] physician he works in wondrous ways for
[2:04:37] his wonders to to to
[2:04:43] perform he didn't provide the money
[2:04:45] because he wanted to stop the surgery
[2:04:51] he made the doctors in the first
[2:04:53] hospital we went
[2:04:56] to not to pick up the
[2:04:59] calls because he wanted to stop the
[2:05:03] surgery he made the cost too
[2:05:07] high in the second
[2:05:10] hospital because he wanted to stop the
[2:05:14] surgery and we say right now that the
[2:05:18] same Lord
[2:05:19] Jesus is the same
[2:05:22] yesterday today and forever now their
[2:05:25] sister Deborah she's singing a
[2:05:28] song
[2:05:30] on and you'll see the the greatness of
[2:05:33] God what he
[2:05:35] does I thank God for saving me from the
[2:05:39] surgery of my knes because of your
