[1:35:44] program please enjoy the show as we
[1:35:46] portray the prophesied birth of our
[1:35:49] Savior Jesus and the star that continues
[1:35:52] to shine and lead us to him today Isaiah
[1:35:55] 7:14 therefore the Lord himself shall
[1:35:58] give you a sign behold a virgin shall
[1:36:00] conceive and bear a son and shall call
[1:36:03] his name Immanuel Isaiah 9:6 for unto us
[1:36:07] a child is born unto us a son is given
[1:36:10] and the government shall be upon his
[1:36:12] shoulder and his name shall be called
[1:36:14] wonderful counsellor the mighty God the
[1:36:17] everlasting father the Prince of Peace
[1:36:22] [Applause]
[1:36:35] about two thousand years ago in Nazareth
[1:36:38] lived a young lady named Mary Mary was
[1:36:42] to be married to Joseph a carpenter one
[1:36:47] night God sent his angel Gabriel to talk
[1:36:49] to Mary Gabriel tells Mary she is highly
[1:36:56] favored and blessed among women he tells
[1:37:03] her the Holy Ghost shall come upon you
[1:37:05] and you shall bear the Son of God his
[1:37:08] name shall be Jesus
[1:37:17] later an angel the Lord also came to
[1:37:21] Joseph in a dream to confirm what Mary
[1:37:23] had experienced close to the time that
[1:37:31] Jesus was to be born Mary and Joseph how
[1:37:34] to travel back to where Joseph was from
[1:37:35] to pay taxes so they packed up and set
[1:37:39] out for Bethlehem but when they got
[1:37:48] there everywhere was full and there was
[1:37:50] no room for them
[1:38:08] so they eventually find room in a manger
[1:38:11] and shortly after Mary gave birth to
[1:38:17] baby Jesus
[1:38:30] not far away were Shepherds watching
[1:38:33] over their flock that night and an angel
[1:38:39] came to them saying unto you a savior is
[1:38:43] born which is Christ the Lord you will
[1:38:45] find him wrapped in swaddling clothes
[1:38:48] lying in a manger
[1:39:18] suddenly there was a multitude of
[1:39:21] heavenly hosts praising God so the
[1:39:27] Shepherd's hurry to Bethlehem to see the
[1:39:30] baby
[1:39:30] and tell everyone what they had heard
[1:39:33] and seen meanwhile thousands of miles
[1:39:44] away were three astronomers they were
[1:39:52] very wise because they had been
[1:39:54] following a heavenly star that told of
[1:39:56] the birth of the new king they traveled
[1:40:00] far and wide for two whole years up
[1:40:05] mountains may be hot nights or cold
[1:40:16] nights through winds and storms maybe
[1:40:32] even pounding rings okay okay we got a
[1:40:40] little carried away
[1:40:45] when the wise men finally reached
[1:40:48] Bethlehem they round the streets looking
[1:40:50] for the newborn king but they found
[1:40:56] themselves standing before a different
[1:40:58] King King Herod Herod had no idea about
[1:41:11] this new king and he started to get
[1:41:13] worried that he would soon be replaced
[1:41:15] so he tried getting more information
[1:41:17] from the wise men but they were too well
[1:41:24] wise for that so Herod had an idea
[1:41:29] and he sought to destroy baby Jesus by
[1:41:34] getting rid of all the babies two years
[1:41:37] old and under finally the star appeared
[1:41:49] before the wise men signalling where the
[1:41:52] Messiah was and when they saw the star
[1:41:56] they rejoiced with exceeding great joy
[1:42:04] they each went over to Jesus with gifts
[1:42:08] to pay their respects to our God who had
[1:42:10] been born a man through virgin birth in
[1:42:12] order to save us all
