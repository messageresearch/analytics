[48:21] offerings roaming but here that they
[48:26] want to use that - - - for what they
[48:29] call the prosperity gospel keystroking
[48:31] but apparatus and race della prosperity
[48:34] for this thing away from the message of
[48:36] grace
[48:37] but that's why it is the duty of every
[48:41] believer Justice Elda Elda talk Cragen
[48:44] believe in this message of grace system
[48:47] exactly the Gracia to live it by the
[48:49] Holy Ghost say we're look we're let's
[48:51] Pete - son Tom now I'm gonna stop here
[48:53] for a moment and I'm gonna ask them to
[48:54] play this clip of brother branham where
[48:56] piranhas keep room for keeping you know
[48:58] let's be okay talking in Romero have it
[49:01] ready
[49:01] not in the least
[49:25] those Christian songs and things like
[49:28] that before the young people and getting
[49:30] out in the world like that throws a
[49:31] greatest stumbling block more at all the
[49:33] bootleg gorge and everything else trees
[49:35] in the country it's a disgrace that that
[49:39] that would be even be permitted the
[49:41] church are to rise up and not even
[49:43] permanent knows he has to be sung the
[49:45] people like that taking a talent that
[49:47] God give him any influence and with
[49:50] their lives speaking louder than what
[49:52] their words are how can people make such
[49:55] plays disease man does instead sing
[49:58] hymns and things like that it's a very
[50:00] height of hypocrisy and we find out that
[50:04] that goes among Christians believers and
[50:07] this young man's a lot a what I think
[50:10] about so I think that that God loves me
[50:13] so much too he'll let me get by with
[50:15] anything I said he never did do that he
[50:19] never would do it even Israel his nation
[50:22] even David a man after his own heart
[50:24] Greek every green any soul yielded to
[50:28] each one of us will do that we know that
[50:31] but he got lifted up so much in his
[50:33] heart now I want to speak this word to
[50:36] the full gospel businessman he got so
[50:40] lifted up in his heart until he thought
[50:43] he could take a ministers place he tried
[50:46] to become a minister which he wasn't
[50:49] called to be and I think that's many
[50:53] times at work sometimes man in these
[50:56] ranks on the business man's
[50:59] group say they get to a spot that God
[51:01] blesses them in their business and makes
[51:03] them prosperous and so forth to get to a
[51:05] place so they take the oughta preach the
[51:07] gospel also and that's wrong
[51:10] that is wrong you should always that a
[51:13] minister do that preaching calls is all
[51:15] Roberts once said it's hard enough to
[51:18] keep the thing clear by ministers let
[51:20] alone by man who's not called for that
[51:22] office
[51:24] you should have man there that knows
[51:26] that our our gain for the word this
[51:29] proves it that he we find out that this
[51:33] man made a great man a good man an
[51:35] honorable man but he tucked the the
[51:38] offering the sensor and what an to the
[51:41] altar of the Lord the burnt incense
[51:43] before the Lord which is only for a
[51:45] dedicated priest to do so but he thought
[51:49] being a God loved him so much and and he
[51:52] been so good to him and he could go do
[51:55] that anyhow and the priest run edge and
[51:57] he said you're not our game to that
[51:59] office god forbids that anyone should
[52:01] come in there only a Levi it's dedicated
[52:04] to that service you should never do that
[52:07] that's the way many times that what's
[52:10] God think has got the world today in
[52:12] such a confusion that man go out and try
[52:16] to take those places which you're not
[52:18] our day you to do it gets to a spot to
[52:22] where they they try to fulfill this
[52:24] office and they're not called for that
[52:27] place
[52:28] now we find outdoor good man blessed of
[52:32] God but if God blesses you you stay in
[52:36] the category that God has called you in
[52:39] if it's a housewife remain a housewife
[52:42] if it's in a business remain in that
[52:45] business reflecting God and whatever God
[52:49] has told you to let it be that because
[52:52] he wants you to be a real housewife to
[52:54] reflect your influence upon another
[52:57] person that would want to be a good
[53:00] housewife if you're a good businessman
[53:02] let your life so beat that it will
[53:04] reflect Jesus Christ in your business
[53:06] with honesty integrity and what things
[53:10] ik really means something because
[53:12] somebody is watching your life you're
[53:16] influencing somebody God has to have a
[53:19] Real Housewife God has to have a real
[53:22] teenage in school God has to have a real
[53:27] minister a real businessman somebody
[53:30] that will reflect him because there they
[53:32] see in you Christ no matter what the
[53:35] rest the world's got to do that has not
[53:37] one thing to do with your eyes we are
[53:39] responsible to God for our lives and for
[53:42] our experience with Christ now we find
[53:46] out that it is trying to take the
[53:50] minister's place and someone telling him
[53:53] he's out of place
[53:56] telling me shouldn't do that he's out of
[53:59] place he become anger I heard he was so
[54:03] anger until his face turned red see we
[54:08] must be able to stand and take
[54:11] correction some of them won't do it you
[54:15] can't yeah I have went to meetings and
[54:17] I've set in the auditoriums and you get
[54:20] up and some people are come in and sit
[54:22] down just for a few minutes if you say
[54:24] one word if they don't agree with gone
[54:27] we flying up all that you know what
[54:30] happened to his a kind of doing that
[54:32] earth are you sorry brother God smote
[54:36] him with leprosy the man died and his
[54:39] leprosy which is a type of sin he
[54:43] couldn't stand to be corrected by the
[54:45] world
[54:47] many times a day it's the same thing
[54:49] this year my denomination believes this
[54:51] not on Carol see take time to search the
[54:54] word God will never judge the world by
[54:57] denomination he'll judge it by his word
[54:59] in his words Christ in Christ is the
[55:03] word they're the same yesterday today
[55:06] and forever he brews 13:8
[55:08] [Music]
[55:19] that's why we believe that that the
[55:22] message that was brought to us by this
[55:24] prophet our prophet is the message of
[55:29] grace what a tremendous thing we find
[55:32] here it's not remain thank when we look
[55:34] at this emiram system but it is our duty
[55:37] then to live the message this message of

[57:59] it little place and feel it alone even
[58:01] if they put their arm around you you can
[58:02] feel it sometimes it doesn't feel right
[58:04] yeah air between us
[58:07] Janice is cnty to anybody alien episode
[58:09] I think we can all raise our hands and
[58:11] that thought after some time the person
[58:15] that feels convicted is president tiempo
[58:17] represent a case isn't a as he convicted
[58:19] even after the the time that passed I
[58:22] want this physically possible they were
[58:24] trying to convince themselves that they
[58:25] were the ones that were right anyways
[58:27] that ritand Akuma circuit was the tempo
[58:29] slow ambient ambien or quantity time
[58:34] pass why does time pass or capacity
[58:37] impose you've convinced yourself that
[58:38] you're right
[58:39] what cuz the convinced you stick the
[58:40] wrong stuff as time goes on there's any
[58:43] part of God in you against Jake your
[58:46] heart and piece of uh something needs to
[58:50] be honest to Corazon Campu here lo
[58:52] something has to be done I'll go things
[58:54] go on like this no I get K las cosas say
[58:56] I finally make the effort to to go and
[58:59] ask that person for forgiveness you know
[59:01] I say let's where's Lolita a second less
[59:04] persona that's not an easy thing right
[59:06] no I'll go fussy yes sir that's rough
[59:08] pseudo but then after you do it you're
[59:10] like it was so free the president
[59:13] Colossus isn't it done now a known see
[59:16] what else Navi though that's the enemy's
[59:18] tactics it's honest articles Ellen amigo
[59:20] but after you ask the person for
[59:22] forgiveness there's a physical appeal a
[59:23] persona por que la Patrona
[59:25] there is a sense of relief right I you
[59:27] said to leave it
[59:33] got it yeah Louisiana and they feel in
[59:36] their mind like they have taken
[59:37] responsibility for their actions
[59:39] he says the intervention Memphis get the
[59:40] model response Emily dies this affects
[59:42] the onus am I talking to anybody here

[59:55] persona is still broken
[59:57] oh yeah another talking about the
[1:00:01] message of grace this morning it's a
[1:00:04] good idea because we think many times

[1:00:07] forgiveness that that that that person
[1:00:09] that is broken that they're fixed all of
[1:00:11] us in someone's gaze represent like a

[1:00:15] healing process now can begin Noelle
[1:00:18] process was any other point in Pesaro
[1:00:20] order but there's another part of the
[1:00:22] responsibility that has not been taken
[1:00:24] care and I suppose I can most people
[1:00:28] fail they say well well I took
[1:00:30] responsibility of my action excuse not
[1:00:32] hit done day later and I asked for
