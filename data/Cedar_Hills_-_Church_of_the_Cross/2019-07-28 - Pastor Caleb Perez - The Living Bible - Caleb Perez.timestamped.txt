[1:25:56] version of judas iscariot love it is
[1:25:59] your sister's fight as they see it they
[1:26:00] love it sooner
[1:26:02] [Music]
[1:26:03] hello everybody
[1:26:07] but we'll sit there and listen to Elvis
[1:26:10] on the radio and listen to people that
[1:26:14] are artists musicians don't even serve
[1:26:18] the Lord see the minister okay because
[1:26:20] the modern version lets you listen to
[1:26:22] the better stuff reconnaissance your
[1:26:24] gnarly but because we think that because
[1:26:25] we come to charge it for good numbers
[1:26:27] that you've never come to church and
[1:26:28] we're just happy because we felt a
[1:26:30] tingle down our spines broken listen
[1:26:32] it's a shame we're big in that way Holy
[1:26:37] Ghost
[1:26:38] I think Ananas bizarre weather is music
[1:26:40] yes uh cuz I'm not ever
[1:26:42] come into your vessel make you a filthy
[1:26:46] dirty vessel mussels tell you the Holy
[1:26:50] Ghost will not stay in that vessel in
[1:26:52] the second version you're before the
[1:26:57] foundation of the world
[1:26:58] Antonella from the Sun del mundo listen
[1:27:00] to all kinds of garbage
[1:27:01] he said it's a 1947 version de la virgen
[1:27:05] de laurentiis guillotine come on
[1:27:07] what is the 2019 version good let me
[1:27:08] assume that does mean listen to all the
[1:27:11] rap you want as long as they say good
[1:27:12] words in it oh yeah dropkick one okay
[1:27:15] when you saved as deceit can be a stop
[1:27:17] my single question every wonder why we
[1:27:20] can't overcome Aloha Nostradamus but
[1:27:22] cannot play Moseman sad or reading the
[1:27:23] wrong version of the Bible it's a Linda
[1:27:25] Lynette honey and it's making you become
[1:27:28] the wrong version in logic a genius
[1:27:30] elements that's for me that's for all of
[1:27:32] us nobody here another fifty run denying
[1:27:36] in particular who brother branham in the
[1:27:41] message debate on tongues a lemon or
[1:27:44] venom there was not one word minced when
[1:27:47] they spoke in tongues this is not me who
[1:27:49] not palabra
[1:27:50] brother Branham says but when you try to
[1:27:52] clean broken through Thursday that the
[1:27:54] initial evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[1:27:57] speaking in tongues I'm Michael any
[1:27:58] there's a precipitous of Latin linguist
[1:28:00] he said why your version of Pentecost
[1:28:03] this is redundant pentakus has already
[1:28:05] been condemned I found another job
[1:28:08] oh because you'll have to put your
[1:28:12] version of Pentecost per ticket in Babel
[1:28:15] didn't skip on it too but it soon the
[1:28:16] Pentecost s impove in cuz you can't put
[1:28:19] it in acts 2 & 4 but can the look was
[1:28:21] Burnett and issues those because they
[1:28:23] hurt every man in his own language or
[1:28:26] you don't know hombres to length whereof
[1:28:28] he was born they don't they Lena and I
[1:28:30] babble in my fell it was confusion no
[1:28:32] one understood nothing
[1:28:34] they died confusion intense you see your
[1:28:36] Pentecostal version been super jump it
[1:28:38] because it's already back in Genesis
[1:28:40] again in Babel yes that's ok this is
[1:28:42] insane it isn't speaking in an unknown
[1:28:45] tongue no stop no nothing while it's
[1:28:47] gonna see that it's speaking under the
[1:28:49] inspiration it's not like what they
[1:28:51] calls you it's like if I receive the
[1:28:53] holy gold I see come on as you will it

[2:25:42] world's looking for today
[2:25:44] is for something genuine we dance we've
[2:25:48] shouted and told lies our neighbors we
[2:25:55] are spoken tongues like corn peas or JA
[2:25:58] cowhide and when I happened bust about
[2:26:02] the next man's doing unjustly we have
[2:26:08] made fun you've joined the church and
[2:26:11] made fun of somebody shouting in the
[2:26:14] spirit tau malice greed hatred all those
[2:26:20] things are in the church and you know
[2:26:23] what the world's hungry for the world
[2:26:26] wants to see something genuine that's
[2:26:30] what's the matter these conversions of
[2:26:32] the circle
[2:26:33] they're not real conversions it's
[2:26:37] interaction there's an intellectual
[2:26:40] knowledge of Christ but a born-again
[2:26:43] experience gives the real cry on America
[2:26:49] is people who have to be entertained
[2:26:51] they've got too much television in them
[2:26:54] they want entertainment they can't face
[2:26:57] the old-fashioned gospel they said we
[2:27:00] can go over here it isn't so rough we
[2:27:02] can do what we want you go ahead but my
[2:27:05] sheep hear mob
[2:27:11] you know that's true oh how God bless
[2:27:16] the church offer to you huh virtue as
[2:27:20] the hymn desert brood but you would not
[2:27:23] you listen to man leaders instead the
[2:27:26] Holy Spirit leaders units demand
[2:27:29] teachers instead of God's teacher the
[2:27:32] Holy Ghost who would teach you behavior
[2:27:34] make you behave yourself nice they keep
[2:27:37] you lady life make you the salt of the
[2:27:40] earth the salt creates a thirst and man
[2:27:45] appears to be like you if you'll really
[2:27:47] live the Christian life you can't do it
[2:27:50] in yourself you've got the head of
[2:27:51] Christ in you to do it
[2:27:53] the world is one with some genuine
[2:27:56] that's the reason they see people that
[2:27:59] claim to be something and going out
[2:28:01] acting like the rest of the world
[2:28:02] that's what calls communism to rise in
[2:28:05] Russia or a town the Catholic Church dr9
[2:28:09] claiming to be something and has no more
[2:28:12] accident done just like the world no
[2:28:14] more than any other Raj not only
[2:28:17] Catholic but Protestant just as bad and
[2:28:21] it's come down home to the Pentecostals
[2:28:24] I confessed in fashion and looking
[2:28:28] talking life's meaning making fun and
[2:28:31] different
[2:28:34] that's wrong but it's good for you the
[2:28:38] Jews but that's reason the way of Casey
[2:28:41] nothing genuine when the people comes to
[2:28:45] a place that they forget all the little
[2:28:46] differences and the love of God will
[2:28:49] shed abroad in our hearts by the real
[2:28:51] teacher the Holy Ghost you'll become
[2:28:53] salty and the world will be like you you
[2:28:57] create a creation around you you've seen
[2:29:00] people you couldn't stand to be around
[2:29:01] yet they were nice people they create
[2:29:04] that within themselves you've seen
[2:29:06] people you love to be with because they
[2:29:09] create that atmosphere around them your
[2:29:12] spirit your soul you can't hide it you
[2:29:15] can't make bleep that's what's the
[2:29:17] matter today there is too much make
