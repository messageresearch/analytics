========================================

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] you you [Music] they can only see a man but those predestinated seen God one saw a man the other saw God and it was God failed in the human being making both of a right but your faith in that what you don't see you believe it anything God fail in the human being he was in that flesh that flesh was his Veil the veil was ripped thing that God might be made manifest in the Old Testament God was hid when he was on his mercy seat on the mercy seat by a veil in the Old Testament God was in his temple but two people come in worship like this but remember there was a veil that hid God they know God was there they couldn't seem that pillar far never appeared anymore there did you notice there's not one time in the scripture from the time that pillar apart went in behind that Bailey never showed again to come from Jesus Christ cloud was veiled when he stood already set up I come from God and I go to God then Paul at his death burial and resurrection on his road to Damascus there was that pillar of fire what wasn't out from behind the veil floor even behind the veil now he's behind what skin veil they badger skins behind the veil and when that veil was rent on the day of crucifixion the veil that he was wrapped in was rent on the day of the crucifixion the whole mercy seat came into view now the Jews cannot understand how that God could have mercy upon a sinful foul people like we are but they couldn't see this one who was getting mercy because he was hid he was behind the mercy seat on the inside with badger skins hanging down covered him before it bit before if any man walked in behind that bale it was sudden death oh we're gonna get a lesson here in a matter you can't receive it the walk behind them skins even one of the priests nuns tried to do it one time and died don't go behind that veil the man that walked behind why there's no redemption yet and that is potentially it's just potential and anything potential is not the real thing in me just potentially it was Redemption seeing must covered not omitted remitted rather not remit 'add remitted is divorced and put away and so the blood of sheep and goats could not do that so Jehovah was hid behind a veil now back behind this veil or he was hid to enter into that a man drop dead to try to enter into it but since Pentecost since the crucifixion when that veil was rent from the top to the bottom for that generation Jesus was that God failed and when he died at Calvary God set fire and lightning and ripped that veil from top to the bottom that the whole mercy seat wasn't playing you but they were too blind to see it as Moses said here are a power set reading of Moses when Moses is read yet that they are still on their heart hold brother or sister that's what the Jews did when the veil was rent and from God in the pain to hang on the cross he wasn't playing you but they couldn't sit could it be possible to the Gentiles it hit the same thing Oh God when they've had the church ages of the son of God but when now the biggest denominations of these this veil of tradition that we've got since Pentecost when the church traditions has been whipped the things that the people said days of miracles is passing these things and God has tucked the bay off of it and brought it in plain you crucified again just exactly the unveil God plainview they should have seen him standing there yet he was too common he was an ordinary man they couldn't see it see there stood a man well they said this guy what scooter he come from but I remember when that spear stuck his body the spirit left him the temple of sacrifice blocks turned over and the Lightning went down to the temple in rent the veil Calvary and there were too blind to see had brought him an open view and still they don't see him there a blind God been healed in a human being you remember he returns and the pall add to that and the Peter in the prison as a pillar of fire remember then but in the last days he's supposed to return again but a pillar of fire is supposed to come back again to manifest the Son of Man the show the word why the traditions has been will be wiped away there's nothing going to bother it's going to be done anyhow God just chair them denominations and traditions down what kind of spirit will they do it like you did in the first place look what he done the days of Elijah the days of John don't you think to say that yourself you have Abraham to the Father cause God's able of these stones to rush Sunday for him do you think cause I belong to this not belong to that God tearing off the veil see the show who you watch the veil when it rents here now let me fly down now one time if the name walked through that veil it was sudden death yes death not to go through it Amen if you can't break that veil of tradition break through that wall of denomination to see God in his power it's dead once were it was death to go in now it's death to stay out the whole mercy seat set in plain view anybody can see it the veils rim glory to God old mercy seat comes into plain view how God could have mercy on foul sinners as us when he hid himself was a mystery and now I said planed you are in full view revealed by his word it's always the word constantly that is God it's a word that opens it up if those people to know the Word of God that day when Jesus died there to seen the mercy seat they would have seen who he was who has that then why did the BAE Arendt remember his death - going - nobody could see it Moses saw it in a farm it was a world of it was a man's back well here it is a bleeding back that same man what wasn't God wanted to show them the mercy seat God wanted to show him who he was so the veil of the temple from the hand of God above was ripped from top to the bottom and showed God it blamed you it was Jesus Christ hanging on the cross the mercy seat and what was it the people were too blind to see now it's repeated again the traditions how they'll all the day of Pentecost the word came and was in a form of son of God and they began to organize didn't I see a Roman the first thing he went to Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostals and so forth it's organized tradition - men don't know where he stands gourds of God he promised in the last days what he would do he would show his wordid playing view open before us to him open up if they'd only know the word that have known who Jesus was if a man only know the Word of God he had know the hour we're living and what's going on they just refused to listen to that word their traditions what caused those Jews to see that what God look like they could actually see because the thing was tore open it was tore open for a purpose what's history but I haven't gone far now how could it prosper how could it be blessed I don't care how many impersonations of Scott or anything else at all when Moses went out there's a mixed multitude went with you but what's it done for its Jehovah himself taking the Bale off of God show the difference between right and wrong which is Methodist Baptist Presbyterian who's riding God's Word is right that every man's word be aligned mind the truth God needs no interpreter he does his own interpretation he manifests it to make it gives the interpretation God unveiling yourself o ride in the midst of us we see these great hand telling these things you say got something on that tonight think of how to watch the hand of God what it does how it unfolds itself seeing people say oh that's nonsense that's fanaticism there there's nothing to that that's nonsense that's dlz but that's a devil that's fortune-telling yes this see the same thing they said about him Oh church and if this tape goes out can't you see ministers of the gospel where you're living case you see that our that we're in God showing himself setting aside look he took that temple veil and tore to pieces that they might see God in plain view and there was too blind to see it and he's done the same thing today putting his word right out in front what he promised ever promised in the word lien right divorce in plain view you know what the Gentile Church stuff the same thing the Jewish Church did too blind to see that's all it'll be on their hearts just as it was in that day notice best to stay away from it now you must go into it through this veil or you won't how God could have mercy on them but remember what it was that God is manifesting what was behind that veil watch what was behind the veil the word what did it they'll the word what was it is in the ark it was the word that that veil hid and Jesus was that word and he is that word and the veil of his flesh hidden and today the veil of tradition hides a word against and it's not so but it is so God's testifying of it blasting itself right out as bright as the Sun before everyone and if you ever see a man your heart it being merciful and tight Moses coming from the presence of God with the Word of God for that age now watch we're now in Exodus 19 don't miss this now that Exodus 19 Moses is coming from the presence of God or 22 21 20 19 20 21 Moses is coming from the presence of God he has been into the word the words been wrote and he in the presence of God with the word he had the word for that age there's a word for each age and Moses coming forth his face shouted so see the word was in him ready to be manifested give out to the people the true word God had wrote it and it was with Moses notice it was with Moses and was ready to be manifested he was the word to them he was a living word hid bailed himself Moses had to put a veil over his own face why he was that word amen until that work was made known Moses had to bail himself wherever the word is it's failed Moses have the word remember after the workers made manifest Moses and Moses again but while that word was in him to be give out he was God well he wasn't Moses no more he had the word of the Lord for that age nothing could touch him that was over had that word with him so therefore when he come to people turned their heads they couldn't understand they've been changed he was a different fella you come with that word and he put a veil the Bible said over his face for he had the word he was the word to them hello if Moses oh brother here's going to be an insult but of Moses as Paul said here in 2nd Corinthians the 3rd chapter if Moses had the bailius faced with that type of glory a phony see because that was natural glory that was a natural law and of Moses knowing that that law had to perish but the glory was so great that invited the people so they had to put a veil over his face how much more will it be spiritual blinded people that glory was to fade away but this story won't fade away see Moses had the carnal laws the condemnation no grace no that has condemned you but this we're speaking about that had no pardon that just told you what you us this gives you a way out and when that word is unveiled Oh what kind of face will it be he'll have to be veiled it's got to be they gonna notice so the Spirit is veiled in a human temple see he to speak the natural words with a natural veil now Paul speaking here and in this this sense the spirit word we are ministers not of the letter the law but able ministers are the spirit that the Spirit takes the letter and manifest it that was just slow you had to go look and say thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not lie thou shalt not do this there the other thing you had to look at that but this is spirit that comes up on the promise word for this age and brings forth and manifests about two tables of stone but the presence of the Living God not a mythical thought somebody made up or some Houdini a trick but the very promise of God revealed and made manifest right before us what sort of available that be back into the lose a key that was so great to even the people said they said when they see Jehovah come down this pillar and fire and begin to shake the earth and and the things he done then will about long far and even if anybody tried to go to that mountain perished it was so great even is feared the quake that if that firm he shook just the mountain this time he'll shake heaven earth what about this glory if that was failed by our natural veil this is there a veil by a spiritual day so don't try to look at the natural break into the spirit and see where you're at does it make sense to you it's a spiritual veil it's over the people think I'm Methodist I'm as good as anybody I'm badness I'm Pentecostal don't you realize if that thing is a traditional veil it's hiding God from you that's the things that keeps you from enjoying oh boy say I shout and jump up and down he said every word he believed every word but one thing it's the full Word of God the promise of this hour made manifest notice now as we go on got plenty here to speak of it I got about 20 pages but it of notes but I I just want to speak on them all see a hurry he is veiled by the natural veil before he could speak the word to the people now God has to Bailey step as he promised in human flesh God do you get it God has to Bailey self in human flesh and put a spiritual available room say well I'm this and I'm that in order to speak to the people when that's avail which is the traditional veil is tore apart then the that what they see while the days of miracles is passed a guy said to me the other day a little Baptist preacher out there come to me brother green and he said brother Branham here's one thing I got a kiss she said you're trying to make the people is down through the Ramada Inn when we hear the meeting I said you're trying to make the people believe in an apostolic age to live today like they were in their first all occasion said that apostolic aids ceased with the Apostles I said it did yeah I said who was a spokesman in the Apostolic age he said that Twelve Apostles in the upper room and I said then Paul was out I said the spokesman was Peter and Peter said on a day of Pentecost when they seen all this going on and holy goes where he said the promise isn't to you and to your children and to them it's far off even as many as the Lord our God shall ever call if he's still calling then the same thing is sure when did they have a Stalag age ceasing the Apostolic age ceases when God ceases to call never said a thing but picked up his hat and walked away it takes the word to do it it's a word Jesus told Satan it's written that's it it's written I said Peter said that it would never end as many as the Lord called this best thing was far now you say you stopped when no hard I said well sir Peter said that it was for everyone God would call for would receive the same apostolic blessing that's that's the word of the Lord see now the natural veil God the word veil in human flesh what was it God was bailing Moses God was in Moses failed in the presence of God was any he was so perfect for that word a mic actually had to Bailey's face and it was a vindicated prophet that unfolded the word and told him I shall not that I shall I shall not see to give his word to that generation he bailed himself in a human being or the word would have blinded even the called out see even the people that was out there they could not stand to see that in Exodus we find that they said let Moses speak not gone see why the pillar far don't appear too much God said how do that I'll raise him up a prophet hey I'll raise him up one and he came all right and he'll head be the word he said if they want to see what the word is and I'm Moses I appeared you are a burning bush so I'm gonna come down and set that pill on the fire they don't see that you've told the truth I'll appear here what the st. burning way I'll appear you're improved to the people I love vindicate your ministry that's what he told Moses here so many words noticed he said nah I'm gonna Matt I'm gonna glorify you before the people said now you told him and I met you out there in a burning bush now I'm going to come down same bar now I'm gonna let the people see that you never lied about it I mean scientifically proven even if you want to see I'm going to come right down a little go and when he begin to thunder once your all's started thunder the people said no no no don't let Jehovah speak will Perdue he'll die see he had to be bailed so God bailed himself in Moses and give Moses the word and Moses come down and spoke the word of the Lord and a veil over his face all right Jehovah failed in the form of a prophet calls it were absolutely and claude said he wouldn't speak to them any more like that he would only speak to him by a prophet that's only way he'd ever speak from then on that's the only way he's ever spoke that's right never any other way notice only moses had the word now there was a group came down there wasn't just the pharisees of the Sadducees or it wasn't a certain sector clan it was Moses he got one man he can't get two or three different minds he takes one man Moses had the word and Moses alone Joshua even didn't have it no one else had hey man Joshua was a general Joshua was a commander in the army Joshua was a believer a Christian but Moses was a prophet the word can't come to Joshua's got to come to Moses he was a major profit of the hour notice the word never did come to Joshua - Moses was gone no sir God deals with one at a time God is one

and from there I will introduce our pastor [Applause] [Applause] [Music] I greet you in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ my brothers and sisters I thank God for this opportunity he has given to me through our pastor courage to speak a few words of testimony to you first of all I want to thank God so much for the way he has kept you all during this time when the pandemic the coronavirus comedy 19 is affecting the whole world as we thank God by the way he has taken care of his bride as he promised she'll never here to take care of his own I found God first of all for the world that he has given to us in this day through our pastor carob and all the ministers that are around him this way we are always able to tune in online and I really want to thank God for those brothers behind the machines to see that we are able to receive these services online may God bless them so much it's such a blessing to us that we are able to hear the word mainly during this time when the world is in a crossroads when everything is outcome is confused up with thank God that we can still hear the voice of God in our day and when we hear the word of God that's where our strength is that's where our faith is we get encouraged then we know where we are at and we are not you know then Passard like the world is puzzled because he has revealed his will to us and we know where we are exactly at and I really found God for those ministers may God bless them so much they are such a blessing to us I want to give it God a testimony for the great things he has done many during this time though if I had time I would go right from the beginning but I want to say God has been such gracious to us here in Uganda right from the time the revival broke out the way God has used you brothers to stand behind a bride of Jesus Christ to support the work of the Lord I don't have words to explain it all I already robust economy that if I could borrow another leverage somewhere to be able to describe to explain to someone what God has done through you to the bread of Jesus Christ and what God is doing in this country I could but since we are still in this motor body we are limited but like the Prophet said one day the greatest statement that a monta man can speak to a mountain man is God bless you I'll say I'll start by saying god bless you for whatever you've done to the bride of Jesus Christ if I come to this time I'll say it's amazing it is supernatural the way God has really helped his children I remember one time when they had just announced the lockdown and I was hearing pastor Qaeda preaching in one of the series of parallel and he mentioned and said please pray for the brothers in Africa that God will multiply the food on the table oh my god I'll tell you God Hornet that prayer and when they you know when they looked down on the whole country and no moving out no up everybody was like oh god what are we going to do you know I hope only remain in God I'm sorry isn't God so brothers we know what to do in how we are going to go through it all but we trusted God in all I found God because down through the rock down you know when people are not working here it is very tricky yeah maybe in Uganda people always win a meal when they go out to work a day so if they don't work it is very hard but I found God that in such a time of trouble the scripture sounds for the six verse one has come to pass really God is our strength God is our refugee present halt in the time of trouble God has used you so much my brothers and sisters to be such a blessing to us I want to thank you so much for what you've done for the bride here during this time thank you for all the support that you have sent there's one time when one of the families brother poured me was a pastor and he was just shedding tears he didn't know what to do the family had spent days without any food but shortly after pastor Kariba calls me and says God has provided something and when I caught back his brother and told them that God has provided something they just broke into tears of joy and this is what God is doing for us I don't have enough words to explain it all but God bless my brothers and sisters for all that you have done and that you've always done for us may God bless you so much I will say that if I look the way board has reeled out with the bride during this time supporting her his current spiritually I only will say like the Prophet said one time you know everything can fall apart but God is Kingdom whenever fall apart the economy of the world is locked but God is economy's not locked God's kingdom is not locked I'll just finish my reading for you a quote here in the book preached by in 1962 that is the falling apart of the world a prophet saying so when this word falls apart we are born into a kingdom that cannot fall apart you believe the world is falling apart is systems falling apart do you believe that you believe the economical system is falling apart the political system is falling apart the National UN system is falling apart the church is falling apart the denominations are falling apart everything is falling apart but we got a kingdom that cannot be moved it is a tan kingdom of God it cannot be moved and that's why we belong I cannot say much more but God bless you for choosing you to be such a blessing to us and I can't forget to say God bless our founding pastor pastor Peres Sania for the love he had for Africa and that love has been displayed through you to us may God bless you so much let me just invite my sister Sharon and the sisters to guessing occurrence for you god bless you so much we love you pray for us we are praying for you god bless your bathroom my name is sister beggar to eat my dinner shoots chorus which
