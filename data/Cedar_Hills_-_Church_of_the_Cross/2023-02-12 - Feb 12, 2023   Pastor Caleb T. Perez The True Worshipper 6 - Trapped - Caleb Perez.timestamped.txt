[49:30] they fell upon the Earth
[49:34] and God knowed
[49:37] that there was going to be a battle
[49:41] oh my I'm grateful to God that he knew
[49:45] that there would be a battle tell your
[49:48] neighbor neighbor there was gonna be
[49:50] about
[49:51] they're gonna be a battle
[49:53] and nobody I don't care turn around and
[49:56] look at your neighbor
[49:57] there's not one of you that is exempt
[50:00] from this battle
[50:03] you can say well I didn't uh I didn't I
[50:07] I didn't uh want to or sign up for it
[50:11] everybody here says I was just born
[50:15] I didn't have nothing going on
[50:18] I was born into this world
[50:22] they automatically sign me up yeah
[50:34] watch this now once once again and all
[50:38] museums fell to the Earth
[50:41] God knew there was gonna be a battle
[50:44] can somebody tell me what started it all
[50:47] in heaven
[50:50] what was the root of all this this
[50:53] problem and that became this this Great
[50:55] War
[50:57] I mean sure you can answer a lot of
[50:59] different things but but give me
[51:01] something that brother Branham says
[51:05] what was that the root of this of this
[51:08] war
[51:09] somebody help me out
[51:12] very good I like that somebody's on the
[51:14] ballast
[51:16] now any of you ever been jealous before
[51:27] wow
[51:29] wow wow brother Jim wow
[51:34] okay let me see how many of you really
[51:36] are how many of you have ever been
[51:37] jealous
[51:42] ah look she thinks she's all hot and all
[51:44] that
[51:47] so so we go to the store and what are we
[51:50] looking for
[51:51] a dress that's just a little better than
[51:54] that one
[51:55] I don't care what color it is as long as
[51:58] it's better than hers
[52:06] foreign
[52:41] and he got jealous of who he said
[52:45] or the kin of Michael very good but then
[52:49] he brought it down the jealousy
[52:52] he brought it down to the Earth
[52:56] and now he transferred it into man
[53:03] hi buddy hola amigo
[53:10] gracias love you brother
[53:12] that's the way the devil does right
[53:14] very Sly and he just slides it in there
[53:19] the next thing you know you don't even
[53:21] know why you're jealous
[53:23] who cares
[53:26] nobody cares
[53:33] it's a little heavier
[53:37] nobody cares but he came down to earth
[53:39] and he transferred it into man
[53:45] then every war
[53:48] every battle
[53:50] every scuffle
[53:53] every Skirmish
[53:56] always has its roots in jealous
[54:02] think about it every war that's ever
[54:04] fought that was jealous
[54:08] every word that's fought there's a woman
[54:10] involved right
[54:15] think about that
[54:17] when I deal with people that are
[54:19] fighting in a in a family
[54:23] fighting in a church
[54:27] you always find that jealousy is at its
[54:31] core
[54:36] if it's in a family
[54:39] because they're on the wheel and I'm not
[54:42] on the wheel is
[54:47] and why is Mom and Dad leaving the car
[54:51] to them
[54:54] why are they leaving me the bank account
[54:57] it just goes on and on it's just after a
[55:00] while it's the same thing
[55:02] billions and billions of years later
[55:06] after they were created
[55:10] angels all of a sudden felt us a
[55:13] difference something different in Heaven
[55:15] Los Angeles
[55:19] jealousy had entered the Realms of
[55:22] heaven
[55:24] and now it was being transferred into
[55:28] man
[55:30] didn't always know how to handle this
[55:33] war hello
[55:35] and sometimes we don't know how to
[55:38] handle the war that we're in it
[55:42] seems like we're always reaching for
[55:45] something just trying to get a handle on
[55:47] this
[55:49] is hot and heavy
[55:52] you haven't noticed anybody here notice
[55:56] the war is hot and heavy
[55:59] but as the battle raged on
[56:04] God has always give always given his
[56:07] people
[56:09] those words
[56:12] and it doesn't matter how many times
[56:15] Satan changes things
[56:17] God doesn't have to change his word
[56:21] he gives us his word
[56:24] in order to fight the good fight of
[56:27] Faith
[56:30] trickery
[56:32] is
[56:34] that is that he he pulls you one way
[56:39] while doing something else
[56:43] right we know that smoke and mirrors
[56:46] we've talked about that
[56:47] but it's always that true
[57:01] he does that so that you don't recognize
[57:04] him and his imps
[57:11] and if he can get you to focus on the
[57:15] flesh
[57:18] you'll never know how to fight him in
[57:21] spirit
[57:23] and this is why we feel trapped
[57:29] come on now I want you to look around
[57:32] we're going to have a good time this
[57:34] morning
[57:35] I want you to look around
[57:37] and say is that your enemy amigo
[57:44] no
[57:46] okay
[57:48] but we say no this it was no and then we
[57:51] still fight with each other
[57:53] I'm trying to get I'm trying to get a
[57:55] handle on this
[57:57] neighbor again
[58:00] okay
[58:01] okay
[58:01] is that who you're fighting against
[58:04] personas
[58:07] but we know it in theory in theory but
[58:11] when it gets time and they boil your
[58:14] blood oh
[58:17] my God there's people that can get under
[58:19] our skin huh
[58:23] right
[58:26] [Music]
[58:54] have you gotten mad and you've lost it
[58:56] before
[59:00] we're gonna have to preach a message on
[59:02] anger
[59:06] but if they're honest that's good
[59:10] and through the word though he gives us
[59:13] the answer on on how what to focus on
[59:17] and how to deal with it
[59:19] Ephesians 6 11 and 12.
[59:22] we know all these things
[59:26] with doing something about it
[59:31] we can quote you this all day long
[59:35] but then when we're when we're during
[59:38] the week
[59:39] what happens
[59:41] oh man the devil's really beating me up
[59:44] in my head
[59:46] I can't I don't know what to do
[59:49] what is Ephesians 6 says put on the
[59:54] whole armor of God
[59:57] that ye may be able to stand against The
[1:00:01] Wiles of the Devils
[1:00:04] is the trickery
[1:00:09] for we wrestle not working that's not
[1:00:14] the way we were taught to read it right
[1:00:17] okay Reuben somebody help me out here
[1:00:21] you're going to tell us how to read this
[1:00:23] I want you to read this for everybody
[1:00:26] everybody knows how to read this
[1:00:28] scripture
[1:00:29] because we know it repeat it but then
[1:00:34] when it comes time to use
[1:00:36] we don't know where's it at
[1:00:39] where did I leave that thing
[1:00:41] go ahead
[1:00:45] um
[1:00:49] there's still
[1:00:51] for Reuben wrestle not against flesh and
[1:00:54] blood but against the principalities
[1:00:57] like all right hold on right there all
[1:00:58] right have you got that did you get that
[1:01:00] everybody got your name in there right
[1:01:03] so I have to say for Caleb wrestles not
[1:01:06] against flesh and blood
[1:01:10] so when Caleb wants to wrestle against
[1:01:12] flesh and blood
[1:01:15] Caleb's got to remember this scripture
[1:01:21] against Powers against the rulers of
[1:01:25] Darkness of this world against spiritual
[1:01:27] wickedness in the high places
[1:01:32] we want to learn this morning I'm going
[1:01:35] to help you like so so bad
[1:01:38] when our children do something wrong
[1:01:41] and I want you to get this because
[1:01:44] because we have these issues
[1:01:47] when our children do something wrong
[1:01:51] something we don't like
[1:01:53] we can become abusive in a hurry right
[1:02:00] foreign
[1:02:05] that's never happened to anybody no
[1:02:10] why are you all laughingness
[1:02:12] I'm not understanding what's going on
[1:02:15] here
[1:02:19] and the problem is sometimes we don't
[1:02:20] just do that we go through with it
[1:02:25] is your fight against you and your child
[1:02:30] watch why the problems in the home he
[1:02:33] said
[1:02:34] and we we make it as is as if our child
[1:02:39] is the problem
[1:02:42] when your child is your your your
[1:02:45] inheritance
[1:02:47] but we want to beat down on the
[1:02:50] inheritance
[1:02:52] all right come on now I'm gonna I'm
[1:02:54] bringing this thing to a balance too
[1:02:57] because then there are those on this
[1:02:59] side
[1:03:01] all right Johnny don't worry about it he
[1:03:03] didn't mean to do it
[1:03:06] and there's never a correction
[1:03:11] are you weird yeah if I were to I
[1:03:14] probably could
[1:03:15] divide you completely down the middle in
[1:03:17] church today
[1:03:20] you would have this side this side over
[1:03:22] here
[1:03:24] we don't believe in spanking our
[1:03:26] children
[1:03:29] this is a new generation
[1:03:32] excuse me
[1:03:34] and then there's the other side
[1:03:37] here the rot spoil the child yes
[1:03:44] and so you find that in the church
[1:03:46] and the problem is is that both can be
[1:03:50] right and both can be wrong
[1:03:53] as we've heard before there's there's
[1:03:55] these two little things in the back of
[1:03:57] us
[1:03:58] these two little bumps
[1:04:00] and that's used to be a attitude
[1:04:03] adjustment
[1:04:06] but but here's the thing why we can be
[1:04:10] wrong
[1:04:11] whether you would spare the rod or not
[1:04:14] the point is that the corrections
[1:04:18] we're trying to put it through as a as
[1:04:22] in Flesh and Blood
[1:04:25] we're trying to get that child to
[1:04:28] understand
[1:04:29] and we think the more that we bound on
[1:04:32] them
[1:04:34] the more that child's gonna come into
[1:04:36] obedience
[1:04:38] that's always the case
[1:04:41] often think about it if I'm bringing
[1:04:52] there's got to be uh there's something
[1:04:55] that I'm after
[1:04:57] and that correction is the correction
[1:05:01] I cannot bring that correction
[1:05:05] I think that it's about flesh and blood
[1:05:10] so I'm I'm naked about that we make it
[1:05:13] about that
[1:05:14] we look at them and then we we beat on
[1:05:19] them sometimes
[1:05:21] and then we take things away because
[1:05:23] we're mad
[1:05:25] but now how many of you you know
[1:05:31] you feel bad because you handled it
[1:05:33] wrong
[1:05:35] and we give it back what we took away
[1:05:39] because we're trying to make ourselves
[1:05:42] feel better
[1:05:43] how many families are following me
[1:05:48] there is no correction that was made
[1:05:50] there no no no
[1:05:53] correction the child is just more angry
[1:05:56] at you
[1:05:57] young people
[1:05:59] they'll Rebel more at you
[1:06:04] hello everybody hola you have little
[1:06:07] children enjoy them
[1:06:09] they got some problems wait till they
[1:06:11] get a little older
[1:06:13] get a mind on their own and like yeah
[1:06:20] I ain't gonna do that
[1:06:22] you think about it it's the world we
[1:06:24] live in right now now stop and think for
[1:06:26] a moment what have I done I've made them
[1:06:30] Rebel more
[1:06:32] I made the fight or the war between me
[1:06:35] and them
[1:06:37] I don't like what you're doing
[1:06:40] but why is it is that the way that we
[1:06:43] think of correcting it
[1:06:45] is not God's way because first of all
[1:06:49] for me to correct anything
[1:06:53] there is an enemy that has come in
[1:06:56] somewhere
[1:06:58] come on church I gotta know as a parent
[1:07:01] got these little imps they come in and
[1:07:04] they squeeze themselves
[1:07:09] you
[1:07:10] can come back with him
[1:07:14] you go to school and you come back with
[1:07:17] him you go to work I'm back with him
[1:07:22] those hitchhikers that's what we call
[1:07:24] them
[1:07:25] right we carry them with us and those
[1:07:29] imps have an anointing with us
[1:07:32] all we're trying to get at is but if I
[1:07:35] recognize when I see my child act up
[1:07:40] and I see the the powers that are
[1:07:43] anointing them
[1:07:45] the rulers of the Dark World
[1:07:49] spiritual wickedness
[1:07:52] I'm no longer attacking my child
[1:07:56] I'm attacking the spirit the powers that
[1:07:59] that have anointed them
[1:08:15] [Music]
[1:08:23] what's the balance here this is what
[1:08:26] we're trying to do
[1:08:28] hello
[1:08:31] then we many times
[1:08:34] because we've never dealt with those
[1:08:36] Spirits
[1:08:38] we've always just shoved things under
[1:08:41] the carpets
[1:09:14] but against fallen angels
[1:09:20] I put it in the other way he got a real
[1:09:23] fight against fallen angels
[1:09:25] and that's why Isaiah 14 says how art
[1:09:28] thou fallen from Heaven o Lucifer son of
[1:09:31] the morning
[1:09:35] how are thou cut down to the ground
[1:09:38] which did weaken the Nations
[1:09:54] brother Branham says on the questions
[1:09:56] and answers on Genesis
[1:10:01] two-thirds of the earth is in sin
[1:10:04] OS
[1:10:05] and more than that
[1:10:08] which two-thirds of the Angels which
[1:10:12] two-thirds of the Angels was kicked out
[1:10:15] and those demon spirits come into people
[1:10:23] and those Spirits those demons
[1:10:28] they come into people and they habitate
[1:10:32] their body
[1:10:34] see what I mean
[1:10:36] they're demons
[1:10:38] that once they was
[1:10:40] they once existed and they come into
[1:10:44] people
[1:10:47] and they give them a nature wow
[1:10:53] and then he says Jesus cast seven of
[1:10:55] them out of Mary Magdalene Jesus
[1:10:59] now did the question is this morning
[1:11:02] now did these
[1:11:04] visuals ever stop worshiping God
[1:11:12] that's a good question
[1:11:15] ah
[1:11:17] once again did these Fallen Angels ever
[1:11:20] stop worshiping God
[1:11:24] I don't believe that they ever stop
[1:11:29] because they were created for that very
[1:11:32] purpose
[1:11:34] but now their worship is perverted
[1:11:40] they continue worshiping God
[1:11:43] you're under a perverted worship
[1:11:46] and I can see what perverted their
[1:11:49] worship
[1:11:51] because they began to worship the
[1:11:54] creation
[1:11:57] along with the Creator
[1:12:00] they didn't stop worshiping the Creator
[1:12:04] but they started worshiping the creation
[1:12:07] along with it
[1:12:09] they began to worship Lucifer
[1:12:13] which is a creative
[1:12:17] so they began to create or worship the
[1:12:20] creation
[1:12:22] along with the Creator
[1:12:24] these angels have been worshiping God
[1:12:26] and we heard the other day
[1:12:29] billions and billions and Aeons of time
[1:12:31] foreign
[1:12:53] but God rejected them from the beginning
[1:12:57] this was all God's plan
[1:13:05] not only did Lucifer and his imps come
[1:13:08] to Earth
[1:13:10] but
[1:13:12] God knowing that the battle would be hot
[1:13:16] and heavy
[1:13:18] fortified man
[1:13:20] he fortified his children
[1:13:24] he didn't just leave him out there so
[1:13:26] that whatever could happen to them
[1:13:27] happened
[1:13:29] he never said I'll just figure it out on
[1:13:32] your own
[1:13:33] fortified
[1:13:36] by his word and no matter how much
[1:13:39] Saiyan changes his mask
[1:13:43] God don't have to change his words
[1:13:48] what a God we serve
[1:13:51] he's mindful of us
[1:13:53] he loves us Osama
[1:13:56] Ephesians 1 4. as he began to lay out
[1:14:00] the plan according
[1:14:04] okay
[1:14:06] okay brother Yandel
[1:14:10] I want you to read this for us
[1:14:19] according as he
[1:14:22] according as Yandel
[1:14:25] has
[1:14:27] chosen Us in him let's let's start that
[1:14:30] again according as he hath chosen who
[1:14:34] according as he has chosen
[1:14:37] right before the foundations of the
[1:14:41] world world that we shall be that that
[1:14:45] we that
[1:14:56] thank you brother Yandel
[1:14:58] what a tremendous thing
[1:15:02] brother Branham says in the believe it
[1:15:04] the seals and he says
[1:15:05] oh and what a plan he kept planting what
[1:15:09] a planet is according as he have chosen
[1:15:12] Caleb in him before the foundation of
[1:15:14] the world
[1:15:18] should be holy
[1:15:21] and Without Blame it's in Manchester
[1:15:24] before him in love
[1:15:26] watch brother Branham in questions and
[1:15:28] answers again
[1:15:30] God was created me William Branham
[1:15:34] now I gotta put my name again
[1:15:37] God created me Caleb Perez
[1:15:42] I was before the foundation of the world
[1:15:47] you put your name there already yeah
[1:15:51] I was before the foundation of the world
[1:15:56] being my spirit
[1:15:59] I wasn't conscious of anything as far as
[1:16:03] I know
[1:16:05] but I was there
[1:16:09] we're not conscious
[1:16:11] because we bypass our theophany
[1:16:15] but we were not conscious
[1:16:18] but Caleb was there
[1:16:22] put your name there
[1:16:24] it makes it makes it so personal
[1:16:28] oh he says I don't believe you're
[1:16:31] getting it
[1:16:33] come on now church I don't believe
[1:16:36] you're getting it
[1:16:37] now just for a minute
[1:16:40] Jesus told the disciples
[1:16:43] that he knew them before the foundation
[1:16:45] of the world
[1:16:48] and Paul said here that he chose us in
[1:16:53] him before the world began
[1:16:57] now there was some part of me
[1:17:00] and then he says
[1:17:06] there was some part of me
[1:17:09] and the rest of you all here
[1:17:13] in Christ Jesus Christ before the world
[1:17:17] ever began
[1:17:20] and here's to my analysis
[1:17:23] I think that the people today
[1:17:26] that are possessed with this Spirit
[1:17:30] or this Spirits a part of these Angelic
[1:17:35] beans here you go brother Jim apart
[1:17:37] a part of these Angelic beings
[1:17:43] that rotated off of God
[1:17:48] never fell in the beginning
[1:17:52] and resisted the devil's lie in heaven
[1:17:58] you resisted the devil's lies in heaven
[1:18:03] how are you today you're gonna resist
[1:18:07] the devil's lies
[1:18:10] the same God of Glory
[1:18:13] the same God that's here today
[1:18:17] that you also can resist the devil's
[1:18:20] lies today
[1:18:23] okay let's stay a little calm here I'm
[1:18:26] sorry I get a little excited here
[1:18:30] I wasn't conscious of anything as far as
[1:18:33] I know another
[1:18:36] but that's what the message came to do
[1:18:40] how many remember when brother Tommy
[1:18:42] spoke that message
[1:18:45] why did the message
[1:18:47] he said to remind us
[1:18:52] he said I was inconscious of this
[1:18:55] but when I opened up my conscience
[1:19:01] to the message
[1:19:04] Theory began to minister to me
[1:19:07] what did it do it showed me that I was
[1:19:12] there
[1:19:13] this is the message
[1:19:23] the rest of you
[1:19:25] we're all there
[1:19:27] you don't remember it but I'm reminding
[1:19:31] you right
[1:19:35] I'm reminding you where we were in this
[1:19:38] again
[1:19:39] there's a part of us our spirit
[1:19:43] connected to those Angelic beings
[1:19:48] that never fell in the beginning
[1:19:51] watching the message end time evangelism
[1:19:57] that you don't despise one of these
[1:19:59] little ones
[1:20:02] for their Angels
[1:20:05] hello oh they're angels
[1:20:10] you say oh those little ones are the
[1:20:13] children yeah
[1:20:15] tea
[1:20:18] that is
[1:20:21] when you did this unto one of these my
[1:20:23] little ones
[1:20:24] you did it unto me watch here they
[1:20:28] always behold my father's face
[1:20:31] remember
[1:20:34] and right away they the children they
[1:20:37] have an angel no he says if they have an
[1:20:39] angel
[1:20:40] when you're born
[1:20:43] it stays with you all through life
[1:20:48] not just when you're a little baby
[1:20:52] stays with you all through life
[1:20:58] I could I had time I would I'm going to
[1:21:03] get into that maybe in my next one
[1:21:05] maybe the next message but but but it's
[1:21:09] tremendous instrumental when a sister
[1:21:11] asked brother Brandon then
[1:21:14] well brother Brandon then if God gives
[1:21:16] us free more he gives us the will to
[1:21:19] choose
[1:21:20] is that the greatest thing on earth
[1:21:24] he says no he said no the greatest thing
[1:21:28] on earth
[1:21:29] God's Will and purpose
[1:21:34] but I'm not getting there not yet I
[1:21:36] don't know
[1:21:37] I see then God creating the spirit man
[1:21:40] in his own image
[1:21:42] and the spirit man was to have dominion
[1:21:45] over five categories
[1:21:51] and God says
[1:21:53] let us make
[1:21:57] oh I like that all right somebody's and
[1:22:00] God said
[1:22:07] yeah
[1:22:08] ah let us make Joe
[1:22:12] let us make Elijah yes
[1:22:15] who is making you
[1:22:17] alone
[1:22:19] and he gives them dominion over five
[1:22:21] things he says
[1:22:23] let Caleb have dominion
[1:22:27] we don't believe this huh
[1:22:33] where's we're afraid of a little
[1:22:34] chihuahua
[1:22:38] anybody do that
[1:22:41] you ever scare somebody at home that's
[1:22:43] the style open the door
[1:22:46] what do we say
[1:22:50] I wonder how expension looks like
[1:22:55] let them have dominion over the fish of
[1:22:57] the sea
[1:23:00] over the cattle over all the Earth every
[1:23:04] creeping thing
[1:23:05] now you have a bean that is a son of God
[1:23:12] not just an angel a servant
[1:23:16] a Son of God
[1:23:18] and God forms then a body
[1:23:22] flesh so that this Spirit man has a
[1:23:26] place to live
[1:23:29] but after the
[1:23:31] Fallen Angels start to get into man
[1:23:37] and they began to cause chaos inside of
[1:23:40] man
[1:23:42] not just on the earth no more but now
[1:23:46] the war is coming into the Earth
[1:23:50] watch this now
[1:23:52] inside of a man
[1:23:56] by a corrupt and Fallen nature
[1:24:00] and man began doing exactly what the
[1:24:03] Fallen Angels did yeah
[1:24:07] worshiping the creature
[1:24:10] more than the Creator
[1:24:12] and the things that man was supposed to
[1:24:15] have dominion over
[1:24:18] he finds himself prostrating before dumb
[1:24:23] dead Idols
[1:24:30] Idols that aren't alive
[1:24:34] are Idols that aren't alive people
[1:24:36] cannot walk or talk
[1:24:40] [Music]
[1:24:53] glorify them not as God I'm gonna I'm
[1:24:56] gonna read just in English
[1:24:58] neither were thankful but they became
[1:25:01] vain in their imaginations
[1:25:03] and their foolish heart was darkened
[1:25:06] how
[1:25:07] by fallen angels
[1:25:10] professing themselves to be wise they
[1:25:13] became they became full
[1:25:15] and they changed the glory of the
[1:25:17] uncorruptable god
[1:25:19] into an image made like corruptable man
[1:25:22] there's the Earth he was supposed to
[1:25:24] have dominion over here
[1:25:27] and to birds that's the fowl of the air
[1:25:30] he was to have dominion and four-footed
[1:25:32] beasts that's the cattle he's supposed
[1:25:34] to have and creeping things that
[1:25:36] creepeth upon the Earth there you go
[1:25:37] wherefore God also gave them up to
[1:25:40] uncleanness through the lust of their
[1:25:41] own Hearts to dishonor their own bodies
[1:25:44] between themselves who changed the truth
[1:25:47] of God into a lie
[1:25:50] and worship and serve the creature more
[1:25:54] than the Creator who is blessed forever
[1:25:57] amen
[1:25:58] do you see a church
[1:26:00] Fallen Angels coming into man
[1:26:05] it's not to get you to stop worshiping
[1:26:09] but it's to pervert your worship
[1:26:13] say that again it's he doesn't want he
[1:26:16] doesn't care if you worship God or not
[1:26:19] but he wants to pervert your worship
[1:26:22] that's what he's after they don't know
[1:26:25] anything else but to worship
[1:26:27] the Fallen Angels
[1:26:31] we are all Born To Worship
[1:26:36] not your neighbor that neighbor
[1:26:38] we're all born
[1:26:40] who worship
[1:26:44] or can I say we're all Born To Worship
[1:26:49] because if the same Holy Ghost foreign
[1:26:59] we're all Born To Worship
[1:27:02] You Will Worship
[1:27:05] I'll go
[1:27:08] I don't want nothing to do with God
[1:27:11] you're going to worship something
[1:27:15] hello
[1:27:16] this is what Michael is preaching Miguel
[1:27:22] hello
[1:27:24] you're going to worship something
[1:27:28] maybe it's your child
[1:27:34] oh my God that doesn't make sense to a
[1:27:35] lot of people huh
[1:27:38] maybe you'll worship your child this is
[1:27:42] the message show us the father and it's
[1:27:43] the face of this is
[1:27:48] maybe it's
[1:27:50] your car
[1:27:53] maybe you're home
[1:27:55] or your job
[1:27:59] maybe even your church Iglesia
[1:28:04] that will not work
[1:28:07] it isn't the church we worship
[1:28:11] it's God yes but there's something in
[1:28:15] the human heart
[1:28:17] that calls out
[1:28:20] foreign
[1:29:30] he came to his Altar and worshiped the
[1:29:33] Lord
[1:29:35] but one now listen closely because we're
[1:29:38] going to get to some good things here
[1:29:40] but one of the greatest mistakes
[1:29:44] that a person will make as a worshiper
[1:29:48] is when they start looking around
[1:29:52] and judging another worshipers
[1:29:59] watch the perversion
[1:30:01] come on now
[1:30:04] we're heading home I see the spirit
[1:30:07] start to change
[1:30:09] it changes the beat of the drum changes
[1:30:12] now we're gonna now we're getting in
[1:30:14] we're getting home now we're heading
[1:30:16] home
[1:30:17] when one worshiper starts looking around
[1:30:20] and judging in other words
[1:30:24] Fallen Angels at work
[1:30:30] it's hot and heavy
[1:30:32] what happens when one person starts
[1:30:34] looking around at other worshipers
[1:30:39] eyes off the one they should be
[1:30:42] worshiped
[1:30:43] no one they're supposed to be worshiping
[1:30:46] at the moment you take your eyes off of
[1:30:49] him jealousy
[1:30:55] this is all scriptural this is all the
[1:30:57] messages
[1:30:59] and then they begin to ask
[1:31:03] why did God accept their worship and not
[1:31:06] mine
[1:31:08] how did you know that unless you started
[1:31:10] looking around foreign
[1:31:34] right those Fallen Angels who have made
[1:31:38] their way into man
[1:31:41] become worshiper assassins
[1:31:46] [Music]
[1:31:48] oh church I don't know if you're getting
[1:31:50] this or not
[1:31:51] again they become worshiper assassins
[1:31:55] your War has come to Earth
[1:32:00] then what do you see on Earth
[1:32:03] tremendous is
[1:32:16] oh
[1:32:18] assassinations going on
[1:32:22] today yoy you see the assassination of
[1:32:26] many worships
[1:32:28] worship Killers
[1:32:32] people laughing at others
[1:32:38] making fun of me
[1:32:41] smearing name
[1:32:47] all in angels
[1:32:50] trying to kill the worship
[1:32:53] I was so blessed on Wednesday to be in
[1:32:56] the Bible study there with brother
[1:32:58] timings
[1:33:02] it was all so good
[1:33:04] tell you what I enjoyed myself so much
[1:33:06] me and my wife
[1:33:09] and there was a part of that Bible study
[1:33:11] is really got my attention
[1:33:16] and it was a question that was asked
[1:33:20] does Christ find you attractivo
[1:33:28] that one rocked my world
[1:33:31] oh where the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:33:35] Our bridegroom's coming for us
[1:33:38] does he even find you attractive
[1:33:42] I could go so many ways in that
[1:33:46] it was hitting on nagging wives
[1:33:51] rasongan
[1:33:56] do you find a nagging wife attractive
[1:33:58] attractiva
[1:34:02] why is this so quiet
[1:34:05] what happened everybody
[1:34:08] I ain't even gonna go down that road
[1:34:11] but does he find you attractive
[1:34:15] the type of worship we give God
[1:34:20] shows how attractive or unattractive we
[1:34:23] are
[1:34:25] and we show our worship
[1:34:28] not just so much by our voices
[1:34:31] but our lives
[1:34:34] our life speaks so loud
[1:34:38] rounds out our voices
[1:34:41] I'm a Christian that's drowned out many
[1:34:44] times yeah
[1:34:48] yes
[1:34:49] there are those that come to church to
[1:34:51] criticize
[1:34:53] that but it's true
[1:34:56] there are those that get online
[1:34:59] just to watch the services and criticize
[1:35:04] but they know nothing of the planet
[1:35:08] all I can say is how art thou Fallen
[1:35:12] Lucifer
[1:35:18] brother Caleb you calling them Devils
[1:35:20] no my fight's not against flesh
[1:35:24] go to church get it my fight's not
[1:35:28] against flesh and blood me Plato noise
[1:35:30] somebody speaks about me
[1:35:32] and I react to that my fight is against
[1:35:37] flesh and blood
[1:35:39] and that's unattractive to Christ
[1:35:42] but when somebody speaks about me
[1:35:45] and I say I don't care
[1:35:49] I love you I'm making the war against
[1:35:53] them
[1:35:54] I'm gonna love that Spirit right out of
[1:35:57] them
[1:35:59] then the brother can be free from that
[1:36:03] come on now we make it so personal all
[1:36:06] the time
[1:36:10] they get into that in a moment
[1:36:15] you're gonna have you're gonna answer
[1:36:17] the question not me oh
[1:36:38] hello everybody
[1:36:41] remember when Jesus was talking to the
[1:36:42] disciples
[1:36:44] telling them he was going to suffer
[1:36:47] he was going to be rejected he was going
[1:36:50] to be killed and then he would rise
[1:36:53] again on the third day
[1:36:54] and the first thing Peter did is the
[1:36:57] Bible says Peter rebuked Jesus
[1:37:02] the Bible says Peter rebuked Jesus Jesus
[1:37:07] the word made
[1:37:11] he rebukes them
[1:37:13] no not on my watch no he said no no it's
[1:37:16] not going to happen
[1:37:18] Jesus stops and says
[1:37:21] come on what does he say you know you
[1:37:26] what does he say what does the Bible say
[1:37:28] hey
[1:37:31] get the behind me Satan I still love him
[1:37:34] imagine if brother Caleb would say that
[1:37:36] to anyone in the church
[1:37:39] I ain't going to church
[1:37:43] he said again call me Satan Gary behind
[1:37:46] me saying
[1:37:50] that is though that which is of the
[1:37:52] flesh understandeth as that of the flesh
[1:37:55] but Jesus was never calling him saying
[1:38:00] but what was anointing Peter and looking
[1:38:03] here what was anointing him here what
[1:38:08] was he trying to do
[1:38:09] what he did in the beginning
[1:38:13] you keep the atonement from happening
[1:38:21] but I'll raise again
[1:38:24] oh Jesus not on my wife
[1:38:28] I already dealt with this back in the
[1:38:31] heavens
[1:38:32] you will not stop what I can't do
[1:38:36] you will not stop the purpose
[1:38:40] why I came to this earth foreign
[1:39:13] hours rulers
[1:39:16] I love him
[1:39:18] he made a way for us
[1:39:21] who is Jesus talking to Jesus it was
[1:39:25] Fallen Angels
[1:39:26] my brother Caleb hermano Caleb who are
[1:39:29] talking about you
[1:39:34] news flash I don't care
[1:39:39] yeah some people are online they're just

[1:39:44] I love you whoever you are
[1:39:46] I love you te amo that's it esta Lucas
[1:39:51] foreign
[1:40:21] that's for all of you that like to get
[1:40:23] on and care what everybody thinks

[1:40:53] wow
[1:40:55] sons of God
[1:40:57] Daughters of God caring about garbage
[1:41:01] like that because
[1:41:02] Fallen Angels just anointing people to
[1:41:05] take your joy and your peace and
[1:41:07] everything
[1:41:09] hold on you don't recognize
[1:41:12] the angels have come to Earth
[1:41:15] for you you're after your soul
[1:41:19] oh Lord help us this day
[1:41:22] well they were saying this and my
[1:41:24] question is
[1:41:25] why did you stay long enough to hear the
[1:41:28] whole thing
[1:41:33] oh come on you act like you don't know
[1:41:35] what I'm talking about
[1:41:37] and they said this about you and they
[1:41:38] said and I'm like
[1:41:40] why did you stay the whole time to hear
[1:41:43] everything
[1:41:44] because you have itching ears
[1:41:47] and the anointing that was on them
[1:41:51] greater than the anointing that was on
[1:41:53] you
[1:41:55] like it is
[1:42:07] and your anointing that you claim you
[1:42:10] have is not strong
[1:42:21] why am I
[1:42:24] oh my God yes
[1:42:27] yes well brother I cannot be deceived
[1:42:29] because
[1:42:30] I have the words
[1:42:33] clear to you today
[1:42:36] if we don't become the words
[1:42:40] you will be deceived
[1:42:43] I don't care how much word you have
[1:42:47] it you will not be deceived in some
[1:42:51] point or another
[1:42:55] remember the message that brother
[1:42:56] Branham ever say it's okay to talk bad
[1:42:58] about someone
[1:43:01] again nothing good to say about anything
[1:43:04] then you keep your mouth
[1:43:11] and somebody comes to you
[1:43:14] I got some good stuff because that's
[1:43:17] when somebody comes to you with a heavy
[1:43:20] heart
[1:43:21] and says
[1:43:24] Mana
[1:43:44] when somebody tells you something
[1:43:47] there's two things one of two things
[1:43:49] you're going to do
[1:43:50] you're either gonna expose them
[1:43:54] you're going to get on your knees and
[1:43:56] intercede
[1:44:00] that was quote brother Tim on Wednesday
[1:44:03] either you're gonna expose them
[1:44:06] it'll intercede for them
[1:44:08] and if you're intercede you say nothing
[1:44:11] about it
[1:44:13] get on your knees and you cry out to God
[1:44:19] Lord take away these angels

[1:51:19] you need to calm down
[1:51:21] right and here they have okay you need
[1:51:24] this and you need this is
[1:51:27] and yet
[1:51:28] many don't realize
[1:51:33] that we go through
[1:51:35] because we were not made
[1:51:38] to live under the stresses
[1:51:43] these bodies were not made to live under
[1:51:45] the stress
[1:51:48] watch what he says fix it okay they say
[1:51:51] stress is when your brain and body are
[1:51:52] knocked out of balance
[1:51:59] the stress response
[1:52:01] responde is what the body does
[1:52:05] to return itself back to order
[1:52:10] if it's an event that happens right away
[1:52:12] and it's over is this an event
[1:52:15] we've heard spider fly right
[1:52:18] if it happens right away and it's over
[1:52:21] you get back to normal right
[1:52:24] but when it's a constant struggle
[1:52:27] foreign
[1:53:15] how do we continue in maintain in this
[1:53:17] day and age we live in come on come on
[1:53:20] now our mind just never stops
[1:53:22] we go to sleep we wake up it's still
[1:53:25] going to sleep stressed out to the max
[1:53:28] struggling nature inside of us
[1:53:33] struggling nature yeah
[1:53:40] drive us to our deaths
[1:53:45] you're headed for disease
[1:53:49] no organisms
[1:53:53] can live in emergency mode
[1:53:58] or an extended period of time
[1:54:02] 95 of Who We Are
[1:54:06] by the time we're 35.
[1:54:09] is a memorized set of behaviors
[1:54:13] emotional reactions
[1:54:16] unconscious habits
[1:54:18] hardwired attitudes
[1:54:22] and perceptions function like a computer
[1:54:26] program
[1:54:28] when you start your day
[1:54:31] thinking of the past
[1:54:33] things that have already happened
[1:54:36] already living in the pastasado
[1:54:43] did you get that everyone if you start
[1:54:46] your day that way thinking of what I did
[1:54:48] wrong yes
[1:54:53] missing what he's doing right now
[1:54:57] The Familiar past they say this
[1:55:00] will be the predictable future
[1:55:05] becomes the problem
[1:55:08] I want you to keep pulling for another
[1:55:11] 10 minutes
[1:55:13] and the problem is
[1:55:15] people can't think greater than how they
[1:55:18] feel
[1:55:20] oh I like that I'm going to say that
[1:55:22] again people can't think greater than
[1:55:25] how they feel
[1:55:28] of course not they're stuck in the past
[1:55:31] their feelings have become the means of
[1:55:34] their thinking
[1:55:40] oh here we are now this is the last part
[1:55:43] of our message and then we'll and then
[1:55:44] we'll we'll call it but we're not going
[1:55:46] to have service this afternoon
[1:55:48] you just put up with me just for a
[1:55:50] moment
[1:55:52] when the plans were all drawed up
[1:55:55] Jesus was given Jesus before the
[1:55:59] foundation
[1:56:00] and the plans were all drawn up
[1:56:03] this is the way it's the unfolding of it
[1:56:05] is and right at that momentum
[1:56:12] I don't know about you but I like this
[1:56:14] right at that moment and that's the
[1:56:16] moment and it was all laid out
[1:56:18] the bride of Christ was given to him
[1:56:23] come on come on that didn't excite you
[1:56:27] okay
[1:56:33] somebody said say it again
[1:56:36] and the plan was folded was unfolded
[1:56:40] that moment and that's the momento the
[1:56:42] bride La Novia was given to Christo
[1:56:48] and every member there was a part of
[1:56:52] that Pride
[1:56:53] names were written in the books
[1:56:58] this is mine it's this meal I cannot and
[1:57:02] I will not lose her
[1:57:04] not one of them will be lost
[1:57:08] it was all drought up
[1:57:12] and died into the world
[1:57:15] he came and died
[1:57:17] so that he could redeem Caleb
[1:57:20] and Justified Caleb
[1:57:23] so that Caleb
[1:57:25] he never did it in the first place
[1:57:30] oh come on now here it is and this is
[1:57:32] the message
[1:57:34] I never did it in the first place
[1:57:37] when was the first place
[1:57:40] before the foundation of the world
[1:57:43] did not sin back there
[1:57:46] he didn't lose me back there
[1:57:49] and he ain't about to lose me today
[1:57:53] he ain't gonna lose you today
[1:57:56] because you never did it back then
[1:57:59] watch what he says now you never did it
[1:58:02] at the first place
[1:58:05] Caleb was trapped into it
[1:58:09] ah let me tell you again Caleb was
[1:58:12] trapped into this
[1:58:14] but we don't remember certain things
[1:58:17] but we never sinned in the first
[1:58:21] therefore we can't sin in the last place
[1:58:28] my mind just goes and goes watch this
[1:58:31] now you knew that was right quick
[1:58:35] when I saw that eagle that was in the
[1:58:38] cage
[1:58:40] that's when you realize that you were
[1:58:43] not a denominational
[1:58:47] you know there was something wrong
[1:58:50] there's something wrong with just
[1:58:52] sitting in church services

[2:06:52] Hermano
[2:07:02] Jacob and Esau
[2:07:04] Esau was just as religious as Jacob
[2:07:12] Moses and Nathan and Korra Moses God
[2:07:17] doesn't only speak to Moses
[2:07:19] an earthquake followed them up
[2:07:26] Elijah and the prophets of Baal Elias
[2:07:29] how long will ye hold between two
[2:07:32] opinions
[2:07:37] Israel and Moab
[2:07:40] their Prophet Balaam was just as
[2:07:43] fundamental in his worship as Moses
[2:07:47] both had seven altars seven Bullocks
[2:07:51] that's yet to pray to the same God
[2:07:54] yet they wanted to curse Israel
[2:07:59] because Israel had the True Blood
[2:08:03] they had wonders following them
[2:08:07] they had a brass serpent for divine
[2:08:10] healings

[2:10:16] he already saw the the end the beginning
[2:10:18] from the end
[2:10:20] and because of his foreign
