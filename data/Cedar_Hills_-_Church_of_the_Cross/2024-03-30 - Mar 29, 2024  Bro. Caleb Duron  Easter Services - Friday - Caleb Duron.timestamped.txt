[1:18:07] doubt that we are in the last
[1:18:12] days if you don't believe we're in the
[1:18:15] last
[1:18:16] days it's simply because you don't want

[1:18:23] days amen amen signs are all over the

[1:18:33] it and I want to just talk to you just
[1:18:36] for a few
[1:18:38] moments in having the
[1:18:42] confidence where it doesn't even it's
[1:18:45] not necessarily
[1:18:47] Faith because when you know
[1:18:50] something it doesn't take Faith to
[1:18:52] believe
[1:18:53] it if you already know
[1:18:57] it you understand what I'm saying I
[1:19:00] don't have to have faith to believe that
[1:19:01] brother Caleb PES is my
[1:19:06] friend or that he's my brother I know he
[1:19:10] is how many of you know that so I don't
[1:19:14] have to have faith to believe
[1:19:16] it because I know it and I'll explain as
[1:19:19] we get
[1:19:20] closer turn with me in your Bibles to
[1:19:23] Hebrews chapter 11
[1:19:27] verse
[1:19:29] one and thank you very much to the
[1:19:33] ministry brother K

[1:19:48] that happen all right well that's a good
[1:19:50] thing I'm

[1:19:54] Tommy
[1:19:57] thank you all for having me having the
[1:20:00] confidence to invite me
[1:20:02] again um I have confidence in him but

[1:20:09] in the room come on down and brother
[1:20:11] Caleb brother Tommy come and bring the
[1:20:12] holy spirit with you
[1:20:15] amen Hebrews 11
[1:20:18] verse1
[1:20:20] say now Faith is the substance of things
[1:20:25] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[1:20:38] Seen amen Heavenly
[1:20:42] Father we ask you lord to bless your
[1:20:45] word not just your word but the people
[1:20:48] who hear
[1:20:50] it and become doers of
[1:20:53] such
[1:20:55] we are under great
[1:20:59] anticipation for just not another
[1:21:03] Revival or church
[1:21:05] service but father we are under great
[1:21:10] anticipation for the
[1:21:14] resurrection amen not only Lord in the
[1:21:17] flesh but tonight in the
[1:21:20] spirit granted father we
[1:21:23] pray and help Lord to just be completely
[1:21:26] out of the
[1:21:28] way for your honor and For Your Glory in
[1:21:31] the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:21:33] Christ because there is none greater
[1:21:36] amen amen you may be
[1:21:39] seated so to to get a little uh into
[1:21:43] this I need to
[1:21:46] explain I want to help you
[1:21:50] understand the word
[1:21:52] hope and I just I don't want to I I want
[1:21:56] to just am I right am I right just let
[1:21:58] it flow that
[1:22:00] okay all right okay because I don't want
[1:22:04] to miss
[1:22:06] anything and I don't want you to miss
[1:22:09] anything now in the English
[1:22:13] translation the word hope is completely
[1:22:17] misused how many of you knew
[1:22:20] that there's a few scholars in
[1:22:23] here so let me
[1:22:25] explain the way the English in the
[1:22:27] English
[1:22:30] translation you're doing
[1:22:35] great uh we use it as a weak
[1:22:40] hope and because of the way we use
[1:22:44] it when brother brandham said things
[1:22:49] like faith hope
[1:22:52] charity the greatest of these was
[1:22:53] charity
[1:22:55] we sort of put in second place
[1:23:01] Faith uh subconsciously
[1:23:06] now and we definitely make hope kind of
[1:23:09] a
[1:23:11] weakling because of the way we use
[1:23:15] it you see because in the
[1:23:18] English it is it means to cherish a
[1:23:23] desire
[1:23:25] it means to
[1:23:28] want want or
[1:23:31] wish okay to want something to
[1:23:35] happen or to want something to be
[1:23:40] true are you with me so far so when I
[1:23:44] say I hope eler doesn't mess
[1:23:49] up that was funny yes yeah that was
[1:23:52] planned okay when I say that that that's
[1:23:56] like expressing that I don't have too
[1:23:58] much
[1:24:01] confidence are you with me now if I say
[1:24:04] I hope Johnny shows up to work
[1:24:09] today it's probably because I'm used to
[1:24:11] him not ever calling in and I mean not
[1:24:13] ever calling and just not showing
[1:24:16] up in other words I hope I wish I I I
[1:24:21] want this person to show
[1:24:23] up
[1:24:25] how many how many understands what I'm
[1:24:26] saying I hope they like
[1:24:29] me I hope they love
[1:24:32] me oh I got one for I hope it's not a
[1:24:34] long
[1:24:36] service I hope brother Caleb don't take
[1:24:38] too much
[1:24:40] time now you're getting it all right but
[1:24:43] in the
[1:24:46] Greek that almost sounds like gecko
[1:24:48] don't say that all right the word
[1:24:51] hope in the New Testament it
[1:24:55] uh from the word
[1:24:57] elpus it it it it means a high
[1:25:02] expectation trust uh and
[1:25:09] confidence all right it it means to
[1:25:14] anticipate with
[1:25:16] pleasure oh come on now right with
[1:25:20] pleasure I am
[1:25:23] anticipating this great move of
[1:25:26] God got me
[1:25:28] now and to
[1:25:31] welcome that which you're in
[1:25:32] anticipation
[1:25:34] for it is an
[1:25:36] expectation my favorite
[1:25:39] part with a
[1:25:43] guarantee all right come on SO in the
[1:25:48] New
[1:25:49] Testament when it says faith is the
[1:25:52] substance of things HED for
[1:25:55] see you see how we're doing
[1:25:58] that we have faith and I wish it's like
[1:26:02] I wish it
[1:26:03] happened we have faith but I'm not
[1:26:07] sure I know I can be
[1:26:09] healed I have faith but I'll go see the
[1:26:12] doctor
[1:26:14] Anyway come on come on now the way I'm
[1:26:17] showing it to
[1:26:19] you faith is the
[1:26:23] substance of things hoped
[1:26:27] for in other
[1:26:29] words that are
[1:26:34] [Applause]
[1:26:36] guaranteed faith is the substance of
[1:26:40] things that I am
[1:26:43] anticipating with
[1:26:45] pleasure with great
[1:26:48] anticipation and
[1:26:51] expectation in another words faith
[1:26:54] is the substance of things I
[1:26:58] know are going to
[1:27:01] happen or you can do better than that
[1:27:03] give
[1:27:06] God I'll praise
[1:27:09] it a light bul comes
[1:27:11] on we struggle over with Faith and Hope
[1:27:14] how they mix
[1:27:18] together but if we read it
[1:27:21] right and understand it
[1:27:27] then faith is now
[1:27:30] stronger with that kind of
[1:27:32] hope you understand what I'm saying
[1:27:35] before Faith was still kind of
[1:27:38] weak right we've come this
[1:27:42] far right but with a strong guarantee
[1:27:47] hope we have
[1:27:49] come we have come this far by
[1:27:55] faith and I have a
[1:27:58] hope that means I'm
[1:28:01] guaranteed make it all the
[1:28:07] way huh huh see so now I got to read you
[1:28:12] more hope
[1:28:13] scriptures because I wanted to just
[1:28:16] change the whole way we look at the word
[1:28:20] hope go with me to Romans
[1:28:23] 15
[1:28:24] now
[1:28:25] remember I want you to
[1:28:27] change not just having faith for the

[1:31:18] God you see when they worship in the
[1:31:22] temple the the the pillar of fire came
[1:31:26] in in the scripture says the pillars
[1:31:31] shook they were giving God the
[1:31:36] glory so I need us

[1:32:45] Gentiles
[1:32:47] well we're going to get it so why is
[1:32:50] that so
[1:32:51] important because the ones that were
[1:32:54] once not even
[1:32:57] allowed to even look at the
[1:33:01] Tabernacle we couldn't even look at the
[1:33:04] Tabernacle we couldn't even be near
[1:33:08] it let alone go into the holies of
[1:33:13] Hol but what they don't understand is
[1:33:16] that not only are we allowed in the
[1:33:18] holies of
[1:33:19] holies we are the holies of holies
[1:33:25] [Applause]
[1:33:27] they're looking for a third
[1:33:29] Temple and that's
[1:33:32] important but don't you know I am the
[1:33:35] Third
[1:33:37] Temple we are the Temple of the Holy
[1:33:41] Ghost changed we weren't allowed
[1:33:45] in but now we're
[1:33:47] there holding everything that God has
[1:33:50] revealed to
[1:33:52] us were rejects
[1:33:56] reject nobody wanted us but Jesus Christ
[1:34:01] spilled his
[1:34:03] blood so that you and I have a right to
[1:34:06] go
[1:34:07] in so again I
[1:34:16] say praise the
[1:34:20] Lord I I wasn't even allow out in
[1:34:26] there I was nothing to them not
[1:34:33] worshipper filthy
[1:34:36] dirty a
[1:34:37] [Music]
[1:34:39] pig they didn't even let the half breeds
[1:34:41] him half uh half
[1:34:45] mixed right Samaritan they couldn't even
[1:34:48] go but Jesus brother said was not just
[1:34:53] interested in the
[1:34:54] Jews he was interested in all of
[1:34:58] us reserved a place in his heart for all
[1:35:04] of
[1:35:05] us turn to your neighbor and say weer a
[1:35:08] spot for
[1:35:16] you nobody told me
[1:35:19] though but you know what's
[1:35:21] beautiful I don't need anybody to tell
[1:35:24] me because I
[1:35:28] know amen amen not because I believe by
[1:35:32] faith I don't know how to explain this
[1:35:34] to
[1:35:34] you I know who my father
[1:35:38] is it started off with
[1:35:40] faith and I had to
[1:35:43] believe but then when my spiritual
[1:35:46] Amnesia
[1:35:50] released
[1:35:52] remembered where I came came
[1:35:54] from and where I'm going back
[1:35:57] to I no longer have to believe
[1:36:01] it I know
[1:36:04] it see it is that
[1:36:07] beautiful I'm not doing away with faith

[1:36:19] Gentiles and all of you rejoice verse 12
[1:36:25] and again Isaiah saith there shall be a
[1:36:30] root of Jessie and he that shall rise to
[1:36:34] Reign Over the Gentiles in him shall the
[1:36:37] Gentiles
[1:36:46] trust that's
[1:36:51] why that's why we can sing
[1:36:54] sing the
[1:36:55] wondrous of
[1:36:57] Jesus sing his mercy and his
[1:37:02] gra because we know he didn't have to do

[1:58:42] Spanish how embarrassing was
[1:58:45] that oh that's all right brother pray

[1:58:48] any and I always regretted
[1:58:51] that I should have just opened my
[1:58:55] mouth anyway that's all right sorry all

[1:59:49] honest this could never
[1:59:52] never inherit
[1:59:56] heaven but then job
[1:59:58] said though these skin worms eat my
[2:00:02] fles yet in my
[2:00:05] flesh I shall
[2:00:09] see hey uh by the
[2:00:13] way the word

[2:00:22] also means
[2:00:25] guaranteed so shall my word go out of my
[2:00:31] mouth it shall not it is guaranteed
[2:00:35] not to come
[2:00:39] back it will it shall
[2:00:44] accomplish I
[2:00:46] guarantee it
[2:00:48] will it
[2:00:50] will accomplish
[2:00:53] everything God set it out to
[2:00:57] do do you believe this say amen
[2:01:04] amen oh
[2:01:10] 14 but oh but and if we suffer for
[2:01:15] righteousness sake happy are you and be
[2:01:19] not afraid of the terror neither be TR
[2:01:28] TR but sanctify the Lord God in your
[2:01:33] hearts and be ready always to give an an
[2:01:37] answer to every man that ask you a
[2:01:41] reason of the
[2:01:45] hope that is hold on that is in you with
[2:01:48] meekness and
[2:01:50] fear go ahead yeah
[2:02:13] 315 sounds so much prettier in
[2:02:16] Spanish brother green said when we get
[2:02:19] to heaven for whatever reason
[2:02:22] we're all going to speak in
[2:02:25] German however we're all going to sing
[2:02:27] in
[2:02:30] Spanish that's what he would say but do
[2:02:33] you see this you have to be
[2:02:37] ready to give an
[2:02:39] account for the
[2:02:42] guarantee that is in your
[2:02:44] heart yeah but sister you've cut your
[2:02:47] hair yeah but I said I was
[2:02:50] sorry
[2:02:52] I said oh sorry I said I was
[2:02:56] sorry and he forgave me but brother you
[2:03:01] were out
[2:03:02] drinking but I said I was
[2:03:06] sorry and he forgave
[2:03:08] me and well brother you have this past
[2:03:10] and sister you got that
[2:03:13] past but I returned and said I was
[2:03:18] sorry and I thanked him for his grace
[2:03:23] and he forgave me how do you know
[2:03:26] because he placed a
[2:03:28] guarantee where in my
[2:03:33] heart he put a stamp on
[2:03:36] it and it says
[2:03:38] Satan do not
[2:03:41] enter Holy Spirit
[2:03:46] only oh I don't look look look your mind
[2:03:50] can go crazy
[2:03:52] your flesh can really mess
[2:03:54] up but that seed that's been in
[2:03:58] you all this time can never
[2:04:07] sin I'm waiting go
[2:04:09] ahead some of you got it the rest of you
[2:04:13] not
[2:04:14] sure you know when I tell you that that
[2:04:17] you've never
[2:04:20] sinned do you realize that you're
[2:04:23] fighting your flesh right
[2:04:25] now because your flesh is reminding
[2:04:28] you about the acid trips you've been
[2:04:33] on or the weed you
[2:04:35] smoke don't get
[2:04:38] Qui come on I I'll pick one of you come
[2:04:41] up here don't act like you
[2:04:44] can't your flesh is fighting
[2:04:46] them but your spirit is
[2:04:49] saying I don't know what you're talking
[2:04:52] about because
[2:04:54] Jesus dropped the
[2:04:59] [Applause]
[2:05:01] charges he accused the
[2:05:04] devil of
[2:05:08] tampering messing around
[2:05:12] polluting the
[2:05:14] evidence so now you got to throw it
[2:05:18] out there's nothing here but Caleb did
[2:05:22] this this and
[2:05:23] this and Caleb donon also did this this
[2:05:26] and
[2:05:27] this but the Lord said
[2:05:36] where just put it right there but thank
[2:05:38] you that's another note for another time
[2:05:41] Jesus dropped the
[2:05:43] charges all the
[2:05:48] witnesses mysteriously
[2:05:50] disappear
[2:05:53] all your drug
[2:05:56] dealers are locked
[2:05:59] upas or converted
[2:06:06] or but the mic what
[2:06:09] happened he's like well yeah he's locked
[2:06:13] up you know what I
[2:06:15] mean so I have a
[2:06:17] reason I don't have to believe in what
[2:06:19] my flesh says
[2:06:22] and when I look in the
[2:06:23] mirror I see nothing but a lying
[2:06:27] vanity because in the
[2:06:30] mirror I'm getting uglier older and
[2:06:35] fatter
[2:06:38] older but that's a
[2:06:40] lie because I have another body waiting
[2:06:44] for
[2:06:46] [Applause]
[2:06:49] me my theop
[2:06:53] is calling me come up a little
[2:06:58] higher come up are you with me all right
[2:07:03] praise the Lord last
[2:07:06] one First
[2:07:08] Corinthians
[2:07:11] 15 chapter
[2:07:19] 15 somebody say praise the Lord
[2:07:23] somebody say I love you Lord somebody
[2:07:26] say thank you
[2:07:28] Lord maybe I should have said somebody
[2:07:31] saying Thank You
[2:07:36] Lord oh
[2:07:38] man you know I love
[2:07:42] him and I can't explain to you
[2:07:46] everything but I know that he loves
[2:07:48] me and that's all I really care about
[2:07:53] I know he's coming
[2:07:55] back because he told me he
[2:07:58] was
[2:08:00] uh uh 1513 all
[2:08:03] right but if there be no resurrection of
[2:08:07] the dead then Christ is not
[2:08:15] risen and if Christ be not risen then is
[2:08:19] our preaching vain your faith is also
[2:08:31] vain uh let's
[2:08:34] continue uh uh let's go 15 16 and 17 all
[2:08:40] right yay we are found false Witnesses
[2:08:43] of God because we have testified of God
[2:08:46] that he raised up Christ whom he raised
[2:08:48] not up if so be that the Dead rise
[2:09:06] not okay 16 for if the Dead uh rise not
[2:09:12] then is not Christ
[2:09:18] raised and if Christ be not rais
[2:09:22] your faith is in
[2:09:25] vain and are yet in your
[2:09:36] sins
[2:09:38] understand what is your sign of the
[2:09:42] Resurrection I don't have any time for
[2:09:43] quotes I'm just gonna is that all right
[2:09:47] is that all
[2:09:48] right he wants to move and I want to
[2:09:53] he's already
[2:09:56] moving then how do you know you're if
[2:10:00] you should
[2:10:01] die how do you know you're going to rise
[2:10:05] up you see because we're talking about a
[2:10:07] a physical
[2:10:12] raising mean real people breathing
[2:10:18] again because once I was dead dead in
[2:10:24] sin and I was spiritually
[2:10:30] resurrected other words Born
[2:10:35] Again In all the scriptures
[2:10:39] tesy that God is not coming back for
[2:10:42] your first
[2:10:46] birth he's coming back for your second
[2:10:49] birth it's in the Old
[2:10:52] Testament where does it say that brother
[2:10:55] real quick I can show you are you ready
[2:10:58] he told
[2:10:59] Nicodemus how are you a master of the
[2:11:01] message and you don't know oh I mean I'm
[2:11:03] sorry
[2:11:05] sorry how are you master of Israel and
[2:11:08] you don't know
[2:11:10] this nicod was must have been like
[2:11:12] racking his
[2:11:13] head what does it say
[2:11:16] that
[2:11:20] well he didn't take
[2:11:23] ish he took
[2:11:27] Isaac he didn't take
[2:11:29] Esau he took
[2:11:33] Jacob he didn't take
[2:11:36] manasse he blessed eph are you with
[2:11:41] me he didn't use
[2:11:44] Adam he used
[2:11:47] Jesus so God never did take the
[2:11:50] firstborn
[2:11:53] he always took the
[2:11:55] second you see it you must be born
[2:12:00] again it was there the whole time he
[2:12:04] didn't take your Stony
[2:12:08] heart he gave you a heart of
[2:12:13] Flesh he didn't take a bloody
[2:12:17] sacrifice he took away the
[2:12:20] sacrifice that took away the sins of the
[2:12:22] world are you with me now so you know
[2:12:27] that you have a hope for the
[2:12:30] resurrection how many believes
[2:12:32] it can I read something to

[2:14:29] Creed but because of perfect
