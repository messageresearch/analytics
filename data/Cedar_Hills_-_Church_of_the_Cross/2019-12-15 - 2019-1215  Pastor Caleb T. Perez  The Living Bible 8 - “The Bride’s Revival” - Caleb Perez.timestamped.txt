[33:52] the recipients entire amen amen
[34:06] makes this statement element around my
[34:08] sister Clara soon and he says LD say
[34:11] scripture has a compound meaning let's
[34:15] get to attending on significant Westone
[34:17] we all know that right we've got that
[34:19] many times scripture-less cateura as a
[34:21] compound meaning hidden significant
[34:23] other words there's more than one
[34:25] meaning to two to each Scripture KCK
[34:28] must k1 significance is key to this is
[34:30] not just one scripture all scripture has
[34:32] come a compound meaning to that and it's
[34:36] it's not just to know sollozzo should be
[34:38] three or four when instead of trace
[34:40] what a man all scripture has a compound
[34:43] meaning though Alaska to the TV
[34:44] significant complicit oh then he also
[34:46] says you know what I mean this a and a
[34:49] compound revelation you now revelation
[34:52] tambien combustor now I will make sure
[34:54] that you understand that before we go
[34:56] aunt is a ciggy cuts against a sink
[34:58] internist all scripture has a compound
[35:00] meaning to ask you to attend a
[35:02] significant Ocampo stone and a compound
[35:04] revelation in a revelation composter if
[35:07] we are the living bible see someone
[35:09] lobelia VV until then each of us are
[35:11] part of that compound nosotros somos but
[35:15] i believe that good morning we're all a
[35:17] part of that compound ness of the
[35:20] meaning and revelation of the word so so
[35:23] most part ii posted a significant
[35:25] revelation when we speak about revival
[35:28] when the blood was there i think many of
[35:31] us can say well ii-i've been in a
[35:33] revival which is why I'm gonna see it
[35:34] Moses town I mean how many here can say
[35:37] I've been in a revival before what does
[35:39] point acid aqui esta la una Y I mean
[35:41] yeah and our mind goes back and maybe at
[35:43] time maybe we had a revival at a camp
[35:46] meeting because unless the mental yeah
[35:47] hey I won't come pimento said we should
[35:49] maybe in special services we had a
[35:51] revival services specialist don't do
[35:53] Bobby banana and and we many times view
[35:56] it as well and an evangelist came by or
[35:59] evangelist was preaching time in put him
[36:01] on citizen pretty Callisto poor he's
[36:04] rich so powerful and and oh we we we all
[36:08] got excited and we were in revival mode
[36:10] EPA cotton tremendo that get toasty
[36:13] mozcon mojitos yet there is so much more
[36:15] to revival than just that there I'm
[36:17] assume us tonight
[36:19] mint okay so that's that's barely not
[36:21] not even just at the top of the of the
[36:23] the whipped cream on top of we'd say
[36:25] super they reviled pastel we talked
[36:28] about revival Alamos they have I mean
[36:30] there is so much more that that goes on
[36:33] yeah mucho mas guitar Qantas in there is
[36:35] something that begins from within it's
[36:38] that good to uh por dentro but I believe
[36:40] that when a revival once again is
[36:42] something that begins from within
[36:44] SN who can pierce up or then throw once
[36:47] again if we go to and we say we were in
[36:49] a revival t1 was these samosas to be
[36:51] Muslim I mean oh and I felt it and I
[36:53] felt this and that he sent es to UK Oh
[36:55] once again it starts from within not
[36:59] from without
[36:59] so means that the adentro know DF
[37:01] whether Isaiah the 57th chapter will be
[37:04] reading a few verses so make I pray that
[37:06] you have your Bibles ready espero que
[37:08] think as really as least us and what did
[37:11] I say I think went I see at the King say
[37:12] and it says this for thus say at the
[37:15] high and lofty one okay see
[37:17] they say allantois oubli me that
[37:20] inhabiteth eternity capital attorney Dan
[37:23] whose name is holy
[37:25] this one obvious Tonto I dwell in the
[37:27] high and holy place a little too
[37:30] recently that with him also that is of a
[37:32] contrite and humble spirit he canal
[37:35] camera and tallow you mill de espíritu
[37:38] to revive the spirit of the humble but I
[37:41] said we really split to they're also
[37:43] milled and to revive the heart of the
[37:46] contrite ones EBV Carol Corazon de los
[37:48] cabron
[37:48] now those what a thing that he looks
[37:50] after course I'll look Almeida you know
[37:52] when when we talk about this when the
[37:54] lamb was a stone many times we ask
[37:56] ourselves the question which is the same
[37:58] was a printe
[37:59] III need her or we say when am I gonna
[38:02] get a get revived is it cuando voy a ser
[38:04] mi vida yo and I believe that many here
[38:06] are revived in much of the KIAC rock is
[38:08] not ready how many believe that you've
[38:09] been revived but this can see already
[38:11] Dios but you know when we talk about
[38:13] that rock cuando la is a so why does our
[38:15] spirit and heart need to be revived for
[38:18] canisters pé-de-serra vivido when we go
[38:20] through life sk condo vamos por now
[38:23] there's so many things that happen to us
