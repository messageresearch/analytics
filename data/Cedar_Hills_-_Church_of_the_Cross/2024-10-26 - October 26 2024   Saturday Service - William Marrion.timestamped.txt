[16:43] [Music]
[16:49] amen can we give one to the
[16:52] Lord so sweet he's so
[16:56] wonderful at this time I'd like to
[16:58] introduce our
[17:01] Prophet William maram Bram Willi Bram
[17:05] we'll be continuing the message I have
[17:06] heard but now I
[17:10] see and I pray at the end of this we can
[17:13] all say that
[17:16] amen amen
[17:47] the 17th chapter and the 30th verse that
[17:52] he said in the last days that the son of
[17:55] man would reveal himself as he did just
[17:59] before Sodom and
[18:01] gomorah and the same conditions would
[18:04] exist you told about Moses about and I
[18:07] beg your pardon not about Moses uh but
[18:10] about Noah how that the people was
[18:12] eating drinking and so forth married and
[18:14] giv a
[18:16] marriage then he come around he said now
[18:18] as it was in the days of
[18:22] L so shall it be at the time when the
[18:27] son of man is being
[18:30] revealed now watch the son of man was
[18:33] revealed to Abraham's group as a man a
[18:38] prophet in a form of human flesh or
[18:42] ordinary man with dust on his
[18:44] clothes and Abraham called him
[18:48] Elohim now Jesus promises here that in
[18:52] the last days the son of man will be
[18:55] revealed again to that same type group
[18:59] The Royal Seed of Abraham just before
[19:02] the fire falls remember the church never
[19:06] received any more witness Abraham and
[19:08] then then the promised son that they
[19:10] were looking for was brought right away
[19:13] after that and the church is looking for
[19:15] the promised son he will come right
[19:17] after the days of this
[19:19] ministry be revealed from the heavens
[19:23] now we see it too plain it's got to be
[19:25] now the only thing there has to be is
[19:27] something Fates gets into a man God
[19:32] vindicate and tells him and shows him
[19:35] that that is the thing that happened and
[19:37] you your go to like Moses did he didn't
[19:39] want to deliver those children but God
[19:42] spoke to him in a burning bush he didn't
[19:45] want to go but he had to
[19:49] go Moses had heard of him being the
[19:52] great Jehova but then he could see he
[19:55] was in the form of a pillar of fire I've
[19:57] heard of thee but now now I see
[20:00] thee what was he seen in his word
[20:05] Vindicated God told Abraham that his
[20:08] people would sojourn in a Strange Land
[20:09] for 400 years but he' bring them out
[20:11] with a mighty hand and notice this
[20:14] Burning Bush gave Vindication to what
[20:16] the prophet Abraham had said would take
[20:19] place Moses said I heard of it but now I
[20:23] said now we've heard amen that in the
[20:27] last days that the son of man will come
[20:30] among his people and reveal himself to
[20:33] the people in the same way that he did
[20:35] at the just before the destruction of
[20:38] Sodom the son of man what did he do he
[20:42] know the secrets that was in Sarah's
[20:45] heart also give the promise to Abraham
[20:49] Abraham had heard God's voice he might
[20:53] have seen him in many different ways I
[20:55] don't know how I talked to him through
[20:57] dreams or through prophecies
[20:59] but this time he saw him I've heard of
[21:03] you now I see you and the church has
[21:08] heard of God they've read of him and
[21:11] what he did and the promises he made but
[21:15] now we see him with our
[21:18] eyes Hallelujah just the same as J I've
[21:22] heard of thee but now I see
[21:25] thee my what a difference Moses in that
[21:29] crisis cried out and we find out in
[21:33] Exodus the 14th chapter 13th to the 16th
[21:36] verse Moses and that great strain there
[21:39] with the children of Israel inspiration
[21:41] struck him and he said what he was
[21:43] supposed to say not knowing he said
[21:46] it see stand still and see the salvation
[21:50] of God God had never spoke to him yet
[21:52] see the inspiration struck him they said
[21:55] why did you bring us out here we are to
[21:57] have died in Egypt was because there's
[21:59] no Graves down there bring us out here
[22:01] and let us die we could lived in peace
[22:03] as slaves until we died but you brought
[22:05] us out here Moses a prophet knowing they
[22:08] had access to God was
[22:11] inspired and he said stand still and
[22:15] you'll see the salvation of God for the
[22:18] Egyptians you're looking at today you'll
[22:20] never see him again how did he know it
[22:23] was going to happen how did he know he
[22:26] didn't know what he spoke but his
[22:28] immediately after you spoke it God told
[22:29] him how to do it said Moses don't cry to
[22:32] me take your staff in your hand and
[22:34] stretch out over the sea and tell the
[22:36] children of Israel to walk amen the
[22:40] inspiration that's what it strikes you
[22:42] if you're sick that's what it strikes
[22:43] you if you're Afflicted something's
[22:45] revealed to
[22:47] you and you see that's been revealed you
[22:50] speak out I'm
[22:51] Healed then God tells you what to do
[22:54] rise up and start walking amen then it's
[22:57] all over when you can do it that way
[23:00] that's the way God does it then you see
[23:03] God manifested through yourself it was
[23:06] God that told him to do it now then all
[23:11] that was present all of Israel that was
[23:15] present saw that inspiration that struck
[23:18] Moses they seen God with their own eye
[23:21] blow that water back from one side to
[23:23] the other and that pillar of power let
[23:25] him right across the the sea he heard of
[23:28] God then they seen God Joshua was in an
[23:32] hour of crisis when the armies was
[23:35] routed and the sun was going down Joshua
[23:39] was a prophet and he knew that if them
[23:42] armies ever had a chance to unite again
[23:45] and come against him he would lose more
[23:47] man so in that hour of crisis when
[23:51] something had to be done there's only
[23:53] one thing if he could keep him running
[23:55] he'd rout him everyone down but there
[23:58] wasn't enough light to do it so Joshua
[24:01] stood raised his hand and said Son stand
[24:04] still and moon hang over aelon till I
[24:08] get to it this battle and the son stood
[24:11] still they heard Joshua speaking then
[24:14] they seen God with their own eyes in
[24:16] action Hallelujah sure see of course it
[24:22] was a paradox yeah to see something that
[24:25] seems to be impossible yet it's true but
[24:29] the sun Stood Still says the Bible I
[24:32] don't know what you people think it
[24:33] thinks the world's run now but anyhow
[24:35] the sun Stood Still perhaps Joshua never
[24:39] have tried to figure out how he was
[24:41] going to to do it how God was going to
[24:44] do it the only thing he said but son
[24:46] stand still he said it perhaps not
[24:48] knowing what he was saying because it
[24:51] was God that give it to him and he
[24:53] worked same thing in Mark 11:23 if you
[24:56] say to this mountain be moved and don't
[24:59] doubt in your heart but believe that
[25:00] what you said will come to pass you can
[25:02] have what you said but you can't stand
[25:04] there fumbling your mind and say you've
[25:07] got to be inspired to say
[25:09] it
[25:11] amen excuse the expression but that day
[25:14] sitting there that woods and God's my
[25:16] judge and I can fall dead on this pull
[25:18] pit that scripture stumped me all my
[25:20] life sitting there that morning in the
[25:22] woods I was thinking on that and that
[25:24] boy spoke to me he said that scripture
[25:27] is like all scriptures is true and I
[25:30] thought well how could it be and he said
[25:33] you're I said he said speak and it will
[25:36] be that way don't doubt it and I was
[25:39] talking to somebody sitting out in the
[25:41] woods no squirrels been there for three
[25:42] days there's no squirrels there and I
[25:45] sit in a sycamore Thicket squirrels
[25:47] don't even come anyone H squirrels know
[25:49] they're not Sycamore and I've been
[25:51] sitting there wind blowing real hard
[25:53] about 10:00 in the
[25:54] morning and I was thinking again and he
[25:57] said you're hunting
[25:59] and you need squirrels just the same as
[26:01] Abraham needed a
[26:04] ram I thought that's always told me the
[26:06] truth but this sounds funny I got up
[26:10] from where I was sitting looked all
[26:11] around where is that person that was
[26:13] talking to me nothing wind is blowing
[26:16] real hard I thought could I fell asleep
[26:19] and dream that no I wasn't asleep I set
[26:22] up against a tree there watching
[26:24] supposed to pick up brother the woods
[26:26] and brother sopan back there just a
[26:28] little bit around 10:00 in the morning
[26:30] Farmers all out there working Gathering
[26:32] their corn I heard it again say you are
[26:35] hunting and you need
[26:38] game how many do you
[26:40] need and I thought now I don't want to
[26:43] overdo this I'm just going to ask for
[26:45] three Three Squirrels I want young three
[26:49] red squirrels I want them he said then
[26:52] speak about it and I said I am going to
[26:55] get three young red squirrels
[26:59] he said which way will they
[27:02] come well I thought I went this
[27:05] far there's something talking to me here
[27:07] just same as you hear me talking God in
[27:10] heaven this Bible over my heart knows
[27:12] that that's
[27:15] true and he and I said well I picked out
[27:18] a ridiculous place an old dry limb
[27:21] hanging out there about 50 yards where
[27:23] my rifle was shot in I said the first
[27:25] one will be right there and there he was
[27:29] I rubbed my eyes and look back I turned
[27:31] my head and I thought I don't want to
[27:32] shoot a vision so I looked around again
[27:36] there set the
[27:37] squirrel I throw a shell up in my gun
[27:40] aimed up I see his blacke young red
[27:43] squirrel I thought I I maybe I'm
[27:47] sleeping I'll wake up in a few minutes
[27:49] see I'm dreaming about this well I level
[27:51] down shot the squirrel and it dropped
[27:53] off the limb I thought well don't know I
[27:58] thought should I go over look for it and
[28:00] I walked over there and there it laid I
[28:03] picked it up blood run out of it a
[28:04] vision don't bleed you know so I picked
[28:07] up and it was a
[28:09] squirrel I got real numb all over I
[28:12] looked around I said God that was you I
[28:15] said thank you for this now he said but
[28:17] you
[28:18] said do you doubt what you said
[28:23] wow you said you get
[28:25] three now where will the next one come
[28:27] from
[28:28] I thought well if I'm Dreaming I'm going
[28:30] to continue on so I I said I picked out
[28:33] an Old Post over there of a tree that's
[28:36] all wrapped up with this sh poison ivy
[28:41] you ever get a squirrel in that so I
[28:43] said the next one will come right out of
[28:45] that poison ivy and there set that young
[28:47] red squirel looking right at
[28:49] me I set my gun down rubbed my eyes turn
[28:53] around again I thought there he said
[28:54] turned his head
[28:56] sideways I sh the
[28:59] squirrel and then I started to go home
[29:02] but said you said three do you doubt
[29:05] what you
[29:07] said I said no Lord I don't doubt what I
[29:10] said for you're confirming this is one
[29:13] scripture that stump me not if I say but
[29:16] if you
[29:18] say not if Jesus said it but if you say
[29:21] it yourself now I thought somehow I
[29:24] broke into that channel and I know he's
[29:26] here because I'm almost beside myself
[29:28] I thought I'll make this one ridiculous
[29:30] sure enough I said there' be a red
[29:32] squirrel come down off that hill come
[29:34] right down this way and right by me and
[29:35] go out and sit on that limb and look
[29:37] down at that farmer here he come down
[29:39] the hill went right out and sat looked
[29:41] at the farmer and I shot him Satan said
[29:45] to me you know what the woods is just
[29:47] full of now I sat there till 12:00 and
[29:50] not another thing happened it goes to
[29:52] show that when
[29:55] God he's the very creator
[29:58] of heavens and earth Hallelujah listing
[30:01] in in Jeffersonville now there's a
[30:04] family named
[30:05] R brother woods and I went out to see

[30:35] happened a few days
[30:37] before and while I was sitting around

[31:01] only thing I know is just the same God
[31:04] when Abraham needed a ram he was Jehovah
[31:06] Gyra he could provide for himself I said
[31:10] I believe it's the same thing and little
[31:12] old hadie sitting back there said
[31:14] brother renom that's nothing but the
[31:18] truth she said the right thing when she
[31:21] said that the Holy Spirit dropped over
[31:23] into that channel again every one of
[31:25] them felt it I raised up I said sister
[31:28] hadie thus sayth the

[32:56] said if this doesn't happen then I'm a
[32:58] false prophet said what shall I ask I
[33:01] said it's up to you to make your
[33:03] decision I cannot make your decision she
[33:06] looked around the little
[33:08] woman and all at once she said brother
[33:11] brandom the greatest desire in my heart
[33:14] is the Salvation of my two boys I said I
[33:18] give you your boys in the name of Jesus
[33:20] Christ them snigger laughing fun making
[33:23] boys fell across her mother's lap and
[33:25] surrendered their life to God and was
[33:26] filled with the Holy Ghost right
[33:28] [Applause]
[33:30] there
[33:32] wow that is truth God has the authority
[33:36] to kill me before these people across
[33:38] the nation many of you here in in
[33:40] Jeffersonville I can hear the Tabernacle
[33:42] ring out now amen because we're sitting
[33:44] out there
[33:45] listening because it's a truth sir what
[33:49] is it it's when the God by his Sovereign
[33:54] Grace it happens outside of there it
[33:57] won't happen in that crucial moment
[34:01] think of the man and the people that I'm
[34:03] acquainted with God bypassing all the
[34:05] celebrities and everything to give a
[34:08] poor little old humble woman can't
[34:10] hardly sign her own name and he know
[34:13] that what she' asked for that's the
[34:15] greatest thing for her sister is now
[34:18] dead and her mother and father has to
[34:21] Die the money would have perished but
[34:23] the souls of her boy is eternal and that
[34:26] was an hour for them to catch it and
[34:28] just as soon as I said I give you your
[34:30] voice in the name of Jesus Christ there
[34:32] they call across your mother's La how
[34:34] many of your knows that to be true
[34:39] hallelu wow
[34:42] inspiration now I have heard of thee
[34:46] that thou could create
[34:48] squirrels I've heard of thee that thou
[34:50] could create a
[34:52] ram but now I see thee with my own eye
[34:59] a manifestation the vision made
[35:04] visable when God promised anything
[35:07] that's what he'll do
[35:10] notice when you have need perhaps like
[35:14] Joshua he had a need he never thought of
[35:17] the circumstances he spoke it and it was
[35:21] God you believe the son stood
[35:24] still so do I how did it do it don't try
[35:27] to figure it out but it did it Joshua
[35:31] did it and raised his hands that crucial
[35:33] moment he had access to God that's what
[35:37] happened it was
[35:39] timely the spirit of the Living God had
[35:41] seen the need of it and pushed upon
[35:44] Joshua to say it the same God seen the
[35:48] need of Abraham the same God seen the
[35:50] need of confirming this scripture to me
[35:53] that that scripture is true
[35:55] too the same God seen the need of those
[35:57] two predestinated boys and it was that
[36:00] moment he proved it and confirmed his
[36:02] word St Mark 14 we see a woman believed
[36:07] on him she had had need and se he had
[36:10] need for his feet to be washed she had
[36:14] only to be inspired to go into action I
[36:18] listen close to before we close she only
[36:21] had to be inspired to go into action
[36:23] because she' already heard about him she
[36:27] heard did he forgive a woman of her sins
[36:30] a
[36:31] harlot and said which one of he is
[36:35] without sin cast the first stone she'd
[36:37] heard about him but now she seen
[36:41] him she was inspired to Ser him that's
[36:45] the only thing you have to be let the
[36:46] Holy Spirit tell you that you're a
[36:48] sinner let the Holy Spirit tell you
[36:50] you're wrong let the Holy Spirit proved
[36:53] you by the scriptures that you're
[36:55] scripturally wrong and what because
[36:57] it'll only stir through one straight
[37:00] channel of every scripture of God it
[37:02] won't bypass for nothing if you do it'll
[37:04] never do you any good because the Holy
[37:06] Spirit can Inspire to you but if the
[37:08] soul isn't right with God as we've been
[37:09] through this week it's no good anyhow
[37:12] remember false anointed ones will rise
[37:14] in the last days not false Jesus is
[37:17] false Christ anointed ones and will
[37:20] deceive the very elected if it were
[37:24] possible notice she had a certain
[37:27] service to do for him she had heard of
[37:29] him now she's seen him with her eyes she
[37:32] had a service to do and she had nothing
[37:35] to do it
[37:36] with so she rushed forward anyhow to do
[37:40] the
[37:41] service God fished the water and
[37:44] towels to wash his feet she had heard of
[37:48] a living God all of her life but now
[37:50] she's seen him with her eyes she knew it
[37:54] was him and inspiration struck her said
[37:58] this is the
[38:01] messenger he needed a
[38:03] service she had nothing to serve him by
[38:06] his feet was dirty but she rushed
[38:08] forward anyhow to do him a service
[38:10] because she was inspired to do it oh
[38:13] backsliding church member denominational
[38:16] man or woman can't you see the need
[38:18] Jesus has
[38:19] tonight inspiration can only strike you
[38:22] this is the hour to do
[38:25] it but you seen with her eyes the others
[38:29] there were even mocking him they didn't
[38:31] believe his
[38:33] message frankly the host the pastor
[38:36] Hosto Simon had got him down there to
[38:39] make fun out of him they didn't believe
[38:40] he was a prophet so then when it seemed
[38:43] like the devil worked it just right in
[38:45] for him to say this he said in himself
[38:48] if this man was a
[38:50] prophet he would know what kind of a
[38:52] woman that was at his feet if he was a
[38:56] prophet see it wasn't even revealed to
[38:59] him who he
[39:01] was there couldn't be any inspiration
[39:03] strike him because there's nothing there
[39:04] to strike
[39:07] to but it was struck to
[39:09] her her eyes had seen Beyond his
[39:13] criticism she believed he
[39:16] was see the word of the prophets she
[39:21] know that that was all the words of the
[39:24] prophets was Vindicated in him she had
[39:26] heard he was on Earth but now she
[39:28] seesing watch what she done she seen the
[39:31] word made flesh the Messiah the
[39:35] Emanuel when she gave vent to her
[39:37] pulsation of faith of revelation of who
[39:40] he was in the time she was living that
[39:43] he was God's lamb for such Sinners as
[39:46] she was she went forth to serve his
[39:49] needs without knowing how she would do
[39:52] it wow that's where a genuine healing
[39:56] comes when is revealed to you that he
[40:00] was wounded for your transgressions
[40:01] bruised for your iniquity and with his
[40:04] stripes you were heal when it's inspired
[40:07] to you to see his pres here of St Mark
[40:11] 11 or St Luke 1730 that he's going to
[40:14] reveal himself in the last days among
[40:16] his people in human flesh like he did
[40:18] before Sodom when you see that and
[40:21] something strikes
[40:23] you the doctor might say the Cancer's
[40:25] still there the patient might say I I I
[40:29] uh uh I don't know how I'm going to walk
[40:30] but I'm going to walk
[40:32] anyhow we don't know how it's going to
[40:34] do she went farward to serve him because
[40:38] inspiration struck him struck her that
[40:40] that was the hour that was the messenger
[40:43] that was the Messiah who was the heal
[40:46] and she believed it and he needed a
[40:49] service unto him and she went farward
[40:51] without anything showing that she could
[40:53] do it she just went up on her
[40:55] inspiration
[40:57] watch God broke up The Fountains of the
[40:59] tear glands in her eyes the same eyes
[41:03] that had hurt hairs that hurt him the
[41:05] eyes that seen it broke up with joy then
[41:08] that Earth god-given long hair with them
[41:11] tears flowing down God furnish her
[41:14] towels with her hair and with her tears
[41:17] she served his needs the need of the
[41:20] Living God she had heard about but now
[41:23] she's seen him she could do him a
[41:26] service oh sinner why don't you do
[41:28] likewise as you see the needs now that
[41:31] he needs you your service now you see
[41:34] the one who once you heard about in the
[41:37] Bible we seen him last night come in
[41:39] here and what he done we see him meeting
[41:42] after meeting and sometimes we set this
[41:44] as cold and indiffer say yes I know the
[41:46] scripture says it oh I've seen it done
[41:48] see we have no enthusiasm it don't seem
[41:51] to strike us right they don't seem to be
[41:53] something like if you was um a pouring
[41:56] uh taking a match and strien it if the
[41:59] match hasn't got the sulur right on the
[42:01] head of the match it cannot strike and
[42:03] you can rake and rake and rake but if
[42:06] some chemical has killed the sulfur on
[42:08] there it will not strike there'll be no
[42:10] light but if that chemical the sulfur to
[42:13] strike against the metal will still on
[42:16] there when it strikes it'll light and
[42:19] when the true genuine Vindication of the
[42:22] scriptures of this life Day message and
[42:24] you see the presence of Jesus Christ
[42:26] that you would heard what he done in his
[42:29] life and here the scripture say he's the
[42:31] same yesterday today and forever and
[42:33] just before the Sodom condition is fired
[42:37] over with the wrath of God see Jesus
[42:40] return amongst his people formed in
[42:42] human flesh and do the same thing he
[42:44] done my or our souls to
[42:47] Glory it ought to do something to
[42:52] us why it's dropping on that you heard
[42:55] in the Bible what he did how the woman
[42:57] touched His Garment he turned around and
[43:00] told her what her trouble was and her
[43:01] faith made her
[43:02] whole now he promised that he would do
[43:05] that same thing again just before the
[43:08] world would be burnt and the world would
[43:10] be in a Sodom condition the New
[43:12] Testament the prophet the god Prophet
[43:16] the prophet of prophets the God of all
[43:19] the prophets the fullness of the godhead
[43:23] bodily God manifested In the Flesh the
[43:26] creator of genis
[43:29] hallelujah it's his word he said it
[43:32] would happen and we see Sodom condition
[43:36] we see the world in that condition now
[43:39] we see him come down and do exactly what
[43:41] he said he would do now we've heard of
[43:44] him now we see
[43:46] him I've heard of you with my ears now I
[43:50] see you with my eyes amen amen
[43:53] hallelujah I seen with my own eyes
[43:58] what an hour it should be what a time it
[44:01] should be the confirmation of his word
[44:04] always when the word is confirmed that's
[44:08] God speaking in his word making himself
[44:11] visible that you can
[44:15] see now here's a little old prostitute
[44:18] off the street she falls at the altar
[44:21] before Jesus and she washed his feet
[44:25] with with the tears and WIP with her
[44:27] hair God honored he said wherever this
[44:30] gospel is being
[44:31] preached let this be stole for a
[44:34] memorial to
[44:35] her why look how filthy she was but
[44:38] something
[44:40] struck she seen the word of the promise
[44:44] from Garden of Eden This Woman's seed
[44:46] shall bruise the Serpent's head she seen
[44:49] the Messiah that had been born of a
[44:51] virgin she heard us was to be born of a
[44:53] virgin but they heard that man was on
[44:55] Earth she heard that there was a young
[44:57] Rabbi Prophet who healed the sick she
[45:01] believed that and here she come down the
[45:03] street walking around looking around and
[45:05] she looked over there and seen that
[45:06] great party going on she slipped up to
[45:08] the fence and looked
[45:09] to and there he
[45:12] was there he was something said that's
[45:17] him that's all she need to be inspired
[45:20] see what happened she seen the word of
[45:23] God made
[45:25] flesh she heard heard with her ear now
[45:28] she saw with her eyes now everybody
[45:31] knows that we have a promise of the
[45:33] church condition in the last day the
[45:37] church in its present condition can
[45:38] never fulfill the Commandments of
[45:41] God the Great Commission can never call
[45:44] a bride out which one would do it amen
[45:48] the Pentecostals I should say not no n
[45:51] the rest of them that's a shuck that's
[45:53] on the wheat they come out look just
[45:55] exactly like the wheat but there was no
[45:57] wheat to it it opens up but the grain
[45:59] comes out of that they organize they
[46:01] killing themselves there's where they di
[46:03] there
[46:04] stalks but the wheat has come up through
[46:07] there and now it's begin to farm in the
[46:09] bride
[46:10] Farm the carnal wheat that fell into the
[46:12] ground through the Dark Ages it had to
[46:15] die that critic saying why would a god
[46:18] of Mercy could open up the Red Sea stand
[46:20] up that poor Christians be eat up with
[46:22] lies and burnt and everything instead of
[46:24] just like he laughed about it the poor
[46:26] ignorant
[46:27] did he not know except the cornal wheat
[46:29] fall into the ground it had to die
[46:31] through those Dark Ages like any other
[46:33] cornal wheat has to go beneath the Earth
[46:35] and be buried to bring forth in the
[46:37] First Reformation them two blades of
[46:39] Luther the stall it had come forth in
[46:42] the west out to bring forth the pil and
[46:45] the toss was the great missionary age
[46:47] had to come forth into the Pentecostal
[46:49] for the restoration of the gifts almost
[46:51] to deceive the very elect it looks like
[46:53] a wheat grain open it up there's no
[46:55] wheat there at all it's only shook but
[46:57] back in there then they begin to form
[46:59] the Oneness organization the Trinity
[47:00] organization the tunist organization the
[47:03] Church of God organization and all that
[47:04] organizing just death exactly and now
[47:08] what happens but it's a shelter for the
[47:10] wheat it's been growing through it all
[47:12] the time now it's beginning to pull away
[47:15] the wheat's begin to be seen this is not
[47:18] a Pentecostal age this is a latter age
[47:21] this is a bright age this is the evening
[47:24] lifeall this is when Malachi 4 must be
[47:27] fulfilled the follow God's pattern this
[47:29] is Luke 17:30 to be fulfilled this is
[47:32] the of Jeremiah and all the rest of them
[47:34] that Joel has spoke of these days this
[47:37] is that
[47:38] dayall I have heard Lord it was coming
[47:42] but now I see it with my eyes no many
[47:45] how many false impersonators r that
[47:47] jambers and jambers with all their
[47:49] gimmicks come do everything that Moses
[47:51] did never shut him Aon at all they know
[47:55] word like job they they know who their
[47:57] inspiration come from they know it was
[48:00] thus sayith the Lord and the same Bible
[48:03] spoke of them said they come in the last
[48:05] days impersonators amen those religious
[48:08] denominations when something started who
[48:10] started first Moses or
[48:12] them if they had started first first
[48:15] Moses been the inter the mimic now we
[48:18] got all kinds of discerners and
[48:19] everything else it's trying to draw your
[48:22] mind from the genuine thing of God which
[48:24] God has proven to be the truth by
[48:26] scripture Hallelujah we heard of it with
[48:29] our ears amen now we see it with our
[48:32] eyes amen
[48:35] hallah amen you believe it yes
[48:39] sir all our hearts
[48:43] inspiration and in that day when the son
[48:46] of man is being
[48:48] revealed the son of man Jesus Christ
[48:51] made manifest amongst his people a man
[48:55] walked down there before Abraham and his
[48:57] group just an ordinary looking man dust
[49:01] on his
[49:02] clothes had his back turned to the
[49:05] tent he said where is your wife Sarah
[49:08] not s a r r a s a r a h a b r a h a m
[49:12] not a r
[49:14] m called his
[49:17] name amen say where is it say she's in a
[49:20] tent behind you said I'm go to visit you
[49:22] according to the time of life and she
[49:24] laughed up her sleeve said why did she
[49:25] laugh
[49:28] now he promised them people was the one
[49:32] that was looking for a promised
[49:35] son now I don't care how much the people
[49:37] act in these denominations that they're
[49:39] looking for Christ their actions prove
[49:42] they're
[49:43] not right your actions speaks louder
[49:46] than your words all going think about
[49:49] making denominational members but
[49:52] there's some people one here and there
[49:54] that's looking for the coming of
[49:58] they're watching for those only those
[50:01] will he reveal himself to only those
[50:04] will understand just the elected
[50:07] understood who he was just think there's
[50:09] about maybe three million people Jews on
[50:11] Earth it wasn't onethird of them every
[50:13] know he was there till he's done come
[50:15] and
[50:16] gone but he revealed himself to those
[50:19] who were waiting John the Baptist and uh
[50:23] the apostles that have been called by
[50:25] John and so forth
[50:27] and blind an in the
[50:29] temple Simeon the priest that was
[50:32] revealed to him by the holy ghost that
[50:34] he's going to see the Christ all those
[50:36] great religious leaders theologians and
[50:38] things blind as they could be only can
[50:41] the rain raise the seed if the seed's
[50:43] already there and as you was a germ
[50:46] first in your father and he didn't know
[50:49] you yet you were in your father but
[50:52] through a beding ground of your mother
[50:54] you were made manifest in his life
[50:56] likness and then he could talk to you
[50:58] God the great God if you've got eternal
[51:01] life then the germ of eternal life was
[51:04] in God at the beginning and you were
[51:06] there you were in his thinking your name
[51:08] and all and he by for knowledge ordained
[51:12] you to see
[51:13] this and you that was not ordain will
[51:16] never see
[51:17] it but remember in the name of the Lord
[51:21] Jesus the hour is
[51:24] your won't you believe it
[51:27] am give your lives to him I have to stop
[51:30] it's after nine let's bow our
[51:33] heads I have heard Lord Of
[51:37] Thee
[51:39] now I see
[51:45] thee Lord Jesus bless this people as
[51:49] they
[51:50] wait now I'm going to ask you a question
[51:56] I'm going to let the Holy Spirit I trust
[51:59] that he will search out your
[52:06] mind
[52:07] try try your soul and see if you really
[52:12] believe and if you find there's a little
[52:14] bit of Doubt there will you raise your
[52:16] hand say Lord Jesus let me see you I've
[52:21] heard of you but I've never really seen
[52:23] you let me see you I'll believe
[52:27] all right it's fine is there some here
[52:31] that doesn't know him as your savior
[52:33] raise your hand say if I I'm a sinner
[52:35] but if I if you if you just let me see
[52:37] you Lord Jesus Manifest this word that
[52:39] they're talking about I know that that's
[52:41] how job seen you I know that's how
[52:43] Abraham saw you I know that's how all
[52:45] the rest of them saw you because it was
[52:47] a your promised word being Vindicated
[52:50] I've heard all kinds of things and
[52:51] gimmicks and everything but I understand
[52:54] that there's a Last Day message in the
[52:56] land that was spoke of by an Angel on
[52:58] the river in
[53:00] 1933 I heard the healing Services going
[53:03] forth and I know when that takes place
[53:05] it can't stay in that same old
[53:06] denominational rut it wasn't sent for
[53:09] that never did stay
[53:12] there what if Moses would come say let's
[53:14] build an ark like Noah did float out of
[53:18] Egypt down the river oh
[53:22] no no he had a message from God he was a
[53:27] manifestation that Prophet arising on
[53:29] the scene ought to approve to Israel
[53:32] right there they hadn't had a prophet
[53:34] for 400
[53:37] years they hadn't had a prophet and here
[53:40] a prophet Rises on the sca they ought to
[53:43] know that something's going to happen
[53:45] Israel again hadn't had a prophet for
[53:47] hundreds of years and here come Jesus on
[53:49] the scene and the woman at the well said
[53:51] sir I perceive that you are a prophet
[53:54] now we haven't had one for 400 years
[53:56] because because he know what was in her
[53:58] heart
[53:59] see now we promised the church age to
[54:02] reformers and we've had him but he
[54:05] promised in Malachi 4 he'd keep his
[54:07] pattern in the last days what would take
[54:09] place to turn the hearts of the children
[54:12] back to the faith of the apostolic
[54:14] father for that very purpose and the
[54:18] church is so broke up in denominations
[54:20] and isms it's so tore a pieces to it's
[54:24] dead it's been a carrier and then he

[56:50] those magazines and things a year before
[56:52] it happened scien is stumped on it there
[56:55] was the Lord Jesus Christ crown and with
[56:57] that white wig on as he seen in the
[56:59] Bible revelations 1 and Daniel Supreme
[57:02] judge of heaven and earth right there
[57:04] when science can't even see it
[57:06] themselves in the observatory out there
[57:09] in the University of Arizona down
[57:11] through Mexico there're searching have
[57:13] been for the last two years and there it
[57:15] was told you it's going to happen before

[57:29] do it just watch and see if we're not
[57:32] living in the closing hours of history
