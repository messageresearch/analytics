Christmas John 13 34 a new commandment I give [Applause] God bless you um God placed on my heart a inspiration for a poem last weekend and I just wanted to share with you a little bit of the testimony behind it um but I'll thank you and when I was 21 I made this decision to give my heart to God and when I did I fell in love with God the message his people and I couldn't get enough of the word I would read message book after message book and it was a new life for me I had lived a very worldly life behind my parents back so when I came to know God and this message it was life transforming for me these past few years I felt myself dying due to many things in life but we truly make a choice in life we have to make that choice and God has an appointed time for us during our prayer last Saturday I was founding myself with the church calendar and as I looked at it it read the day I died and that was a revelation that hit me and on Saturday as our pastor led us in prayer he said we first need to empty ourselves out of everything and as I knelt down I told God this is the day I die and I went through everything that so easily beset me I made the decision just as the eagle has to in its 40th year it makes the decision to go up to the mountain and pound his beak on the Rock to take off all the build up on its Beak from years so it can live again and I had to make that choice too I had to go to The Rock The Rock of Ages and die out to myself so he can live in me again last Sunday we visited in Silver City and brother Eli Castillo was preaching and we went to see our family and that's when God inspired this poem to me so I I hope it blesses you it's 25 years too long to Tarry don't turn from side to side take one step at a time but what if starting down at the bottom looking up seems too long of a weight just take the step you'll be closer for each step I take is mine it's possession each and every step each step was different there were victories laughter and joy days and steps sometimes even seemed filled with losses tears weary and even falling down but I have an appointed time a time where I receive my victory victory in God the footsteps of the righteous are ordained do not stop walking press toward the high Mark forget the things of the past for God is our victory thank you God bless you all so I heard for the brand I'm singing this song actually this past week and I kept listening to it and I fell in love with it because it reminded me of that dream that brother Enzo had of my grandma that she told us if you could just look past the curtain of time you would see that all of this is so small on it and that's been that's been a real good help to me lately so I pray that this song blesses you all foreign [Music] I'm so homesick and blue

lies [Music] where the evils of this Earth can no longer touch me Lord let me look past the curtain of time let me look past the curtain of Sorrow and fear let me view that bright sunny cloud [Music]

title the message you either fly or you're gonna cry you see huh so you you got wings tell Henry to show you how to fly yeah but now let's let's really get serious let us start with Saint Mark 1542 yeah when you hear it you can say Amen and now when the evening was come on because it was the preparation so the this is the evening message it's the time to get prepared and if you go to Saint John Juan it says it was a time for the Feast of the Passover and if you do not get prepared then the Lord will pass you over because it was a preparation that is the day before the Sabbath preparations there will be no Sabbath for eign what is preparation yes preparation to set in order to get ready to train in trainer in life we get prepared for many things you get prepared for to go to work you get prepared to go to school you well there's so many things prepared repairs I remember a couple of years ago they had told me to go official a funeral and it was nothing but Catholics around me I had no backing from nobody because it was Sabrina anyway uh four days what rodeos before she passed away they put her in hospice and she told me that she wanted me to officiate her funeral so when the day came when she passed away and it says the service will be in Holy Cross Catholic Church and the prison was officiating was stressed you know in a white robe and the big cross and all the things ornaments that those priests put on themselves when they took the body to the cemetery I said at least I'm gonna officiate here it's not so much because I've officiated a lot of funerals it's because it's a best time to throw them he's not even the devil wants me before anyway when we got to the cemetery I said well at least I'm going to speak here they have problems and another Catholic priest got down a big heavy set priest this one was not dressed in white he was dressed in black Grande is about a mile long because and he got there and talked and when he was through you know he starts you know how they sprinkle on the caskets oh my God I was burning I wanted to get in you know and I when he was true directors got right away to finish everything we know el director the the services a good thing that my nephew give me sobrino he said wait a minute yeah my uncle wants to speak foreign everyone from the church was backing him up backing me up I got up there and I knew a lot of these Catholic not all of them but I appeared and the problem is when Moses came down from the mountains he had to put a veil over his face glory of God shining because he had been with God for 40 days and 40 nights the scripture says uh with a community there is a no man that has honor in his own home yeah oh no oh I knew him when he would get drunk back then they they seen your past life what you used to do okay it's like brother Dennis says they will throw you under the bus I was prepared and I told those people and I was preaching to them like I'm preaching to you right now I said I said but my niece told me for me to pay off officiate the funeral promise did you change the plane for this you know is this community but we get prepared you buy insurance for your car you buy insurance for your house you buy insurance to put you in the grave compress I'm giving you insurance to take you out of the grace but you know what you tell them what scriptural well and then it goes one year and comes out the other entrepreneur let me ask a question how many of you were in the Boy Scouts Boy Scout s don't you know nothing about Boy Scouts ah yeah we're still here though the Boy Scouts had a little badge here they said be prepared right but nobody prepared more than the Apache Indians Los Indios Apache because the United States Cavalry on one side is a Mexican Army on the other side we're always after them when a boy was born they dried the naval chord uh foreign nurses and then later they went to a higher Mountain it is preparing them for Wars the enemy was after them in the winter time they have to take a bath on the Cold Stream not only for cleanliness but to harm their bodies and then the final one final because and they had to take water in their mouth and not follow it and they made them run up a hill and come back and with the water still in their mouths look we have our mouth dry and and we drink that we would drink that water you know why because we breathe through out I wake up with my throat dry in the morning I hear you snoring from the other room foreign Daniel 9 2 Danielle nuevos in the first year of his Reign I Daniel understood by books the number of years el numero thank God Emilio then we had the best book in this church too bad that he's very sick right now we inform our arita but he was an open book around the world foreign I could venture to say is the way the world is going all the politics and all the evil while Mundo and La political malignant I would venture to say that we don't have two more years to go adventurous that's not God says the Lord I'm just you know by studying and by seeing World politics and everything bro foreign to get prepared this is a message of preparations Saint Matthew 24 3 Mateo and as he said upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world is verse 14 and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end to come is this the word has been preached [Applause] in the times of of Wesley Wesley they had an open door open door hearing the word for a lot of things yes but that's not the gospel is that is just Christian you know what they how they believe the world uh I told her Jehovah witnessed I told him that God had healed me from cancer they don't believe Divina I would quit and go find me a one because the Bible says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever tell me one thing or another number so then entonces there was another Open Door via there was another Open Door John was in the Isle of Patmos and the Lord said I cannot tell you what I need to tell because you're still down there in the earth in a Partners all with all the snakes and the Scorpions and lizards scorpions anyway don't say you know when you be preached all over the world and there'll be rumors of wars and Wars in 1906 the Holy Ghost came the Revival lasted three years but the people refused it and God sent the plague Espanol the Spanish blue Millions died Millions Brothers I believe we are in the preparation of the last destruction this world will ever know hello God doesn't call a man to judgment without first warning him because before a coming judgment there is a preparation mate preparation God cannot send destruction until people get into the spirit of the last days it has to be a spirit of destruction and God not send a prophet is because the the Revival in Azusa Lester from 1906 to 1909 and in 19090s when the prophet was born and brothers is a sign of preparation as we have been one what is going to happen and I say to you people this morning and it it is where is it going to come from you either reply or you're gonna cry what is going to happen from the book of naom I think I never said from this book chapter one foreign in the Bible the most famous river that you face is getting brighter and brighter this is even the lakes are all getting dry and uh flower of Lebanon language and the hills melt s and the ear is burned and his presence who can stand before his indignation and who can abide by the pureness of his anger his pure is long we're gonna find out where the heat is going to fry those that are not prepared that's why you come to church and those tremendous messages that the pastor has brought us yes tremendous we all should be prepared my brother now who's real sick he told us in Silver City youth that we're in Silver City you heard this is there should not be no foolish virgins in this congregations like he said but it's better to be a foolish person then brother Branham says I'm not saying that none of the summer you're a foolish versions should be glad there is an atomic bomb atomic why did he say that you don't have to go through that great tribulations amen amen oh we're gonna find out where that heat is coming from you give me your utmost attention the sun deposit 342 watts of energy what's the energy into every square meter of the Earth where does the sun's heat go why is it the whole Earth heart [Music] because most of the sun's head is deposited into the Tropics of the Earth this is because the Earth rotational axis is almost perfect perpendicular means perpendicular significa upright rectal vertical vertical trade-off or direction to the plane of Earth's orbit around the sun alplano Del orbital Del Sol I know I'm gonna lose some of you here okay but if it was a movie in the theater you wouldn't lose one second of it take the cobwebs out of your mind your brain is more important than anything else is the polar latitude the latitude receive far less sunlight receiving menus loose Del Sol get off of you look at this butterfly they received far less sunlight than the equal receiving men always wonder why the equator is so hot and the poles are so cold it is they were exactly perpendicular perpendicular to the orbit plane around the Sun alplano orbital Del Sol there a spring primavera Verano the climate in January would be the same as in July all over the years says the road tasty foreign A Day In Summer under latitude in Latitude polar receive most almost as much solar as the tropics tropicos and you don't have to tell me I experienced that when I was stationed two years in Alaska yeah is I have never so from because and last year very poor because of the Heat but people hardly go out no more so they will know and uh my brothers Danny and Tommy is we were so poor is we have no toys to play with we even played with my sister Ruth and my other sisters in the wintertime there were no televisions you know what we would play my mother had those you know those are like rings of aluminum that they fused for her embroidery you know what I'm talking about and we put bottles inside the house Xboxes or Xbox cell phones they're well not even a regular phone regular about five five six years ago I went for uh my daughter Wendy she was living in curc and in the Black Range the alternator gave out at night there was no cell phone we walked 13 miles to San Lorenzo San Lorenzo and in the that station in San Lorenzo yeah in San Lorenzo there was a phone those ones that you're gonna put Carlos at the border of time um you know foreign by the grace of God I said exactly one dollars and I call my wife two o'clock in the morning and she called my son-in-law and he came for us to San Lorenzo yeah my daughter couldn't be able to walk I'm gonna have to leave her there and walk myself but the Earth is getting hard as an oven but follow me closely notice how many would have passed through that time none of you when the Lord will pick up his right hey you will not prepared Sinister preparado if you wanna eat you're gonna have to join that Confederation of churches and you say I'll never join the Catholic Church is you're the guy you got small children and your children crying for food they're hungry and they'll give you food if you no nothing let me read something here then he hits something here Daniel 3 19. Daniel dress versus then was Nebuchadnezzar full of Fury a form of his visit was changed against cataract massage and a bad Eagle therefore his faith and commanded that they should hit the furnace one seven times more than it was but the king had already put his seal on Earth also those Holy Rollers whose boss around here is everyone that is a witness for God will have to go through fiery trials and no matter how hard it is if you are not right with God you will go to a harder place the closer you get to God foreign how can you burn fire with fire is the Holy Ghost Empire they want to throw you in the oven how can they burn fire with spiders no no we'll burn that religion out of them you will never possess the question Drake message they possessed the gates so they would not bound bow down yes hit the furnace seven times these young ministers in this congregation many times yeah just don't preach the historical God no predictions you can preach on Daniel in the Lion's denial and these Hebrew children in in the furnace yes that's okay then lifts up your face but I'm gonna bring it now to our time are you living at the same the same Spirits don't die those Spirits are still here let me tell you what brothers the time is coming again [Music] thank you is in the heat in the this world is an oven it is seven times though [Music] you read the news it's nothing but bad news do you ever read good news civilization civilization has traveled from the East to the West California this in California in California all the rubbish Austin was dumped in California and brothers this has become the says foreign and carbon dioxide carbon dioxide absorb the heat absorbent emitted from the surface and because atmospheric temperature decreases with altitude temperatures decreases the Heat and mission of the atmosphere is a much lower temperature than the surface so the earth and the atmosphere they keep heating up until the heat trapped by carbon dioxide foreign that is one of the causes of this climate change the Earth itself acts like a huge magnetism Grande the North Pole of a magnet the sixth the North Pole of the earth and the scientists are afraid that the magnetic field of the earth will reverse its direction in versa the Earth creates a magnetic field magnetic that Shields most of the habited parts of our planet from the church particles they come mostly from the Sun but without our planet's magnetic fields we know the Earth will be subject to more Cosmic radiation Cosmetics could not call power grid is would increase no the increase would knock out them and it will scramble the communication system is and what is all this yes it will affect the birds and the peace and there will be no Bees the the births and bees they rely on the Earth's magnetic fields how would a birds know like the hummingbirds they go in the winter to Mexico and come over here to the United States and they know when to turn go back how they know they need the magnetic field to navigate so I say so how did this come about there was no cold no Seasons In The Times They were more advanced in science technology but we know that history repeats itself God destroyed them in the times of Norah were destroyed the people in the world not destroyed like we but it just clings the atomic bombs and through the Earth out of orbit is [Music] which the Earth rotates rotation if they didn't mind oh which is the Earth rotates and the Earth started to Incline God had to intervene in order to give the humanity a second chance the inclination foreign neither perpendicular or horizontal perpendicular or horizontal it is the angle between the Earth's rotational axis and its orbital axis is the angle of zero the excess points in the same direction but the Earth foreign [Music] because it's losing its speed at the rate that it's going around the Sun how many of you like to play with seven days yeah children nowadays colors they don't know when we were kids we played with but now they got so much junk yeah oh man how many of you have ever played with tops we are Ruby and the girls and Andrea you pay me Andrea I'm proud of you I'm proud of you yesterday no well you got an excuse can I is a sixth grade teacher he would make a circle on in the dirt no subtle noons didn't have not even a penny in our pockets you take change and throw it in the circle and we all had our top and whoever would hit one of the the coins they would jump out of the out of the circle Nathan doesn't want us to keep going as long as you you like me you want me to keep going I wasn't very good I couldn't take one coin I was never good my sister Ruth was better than me my sister was a queen marbles you could get a marble out of the circle hit that marble foreign would fly out everywhere I wasn't even good for that brother mercy of me the wobble uh the Earth because it is wobbling is getting closer and closer to the Sun it is getting closer to the Sun the second soul the angle does not change too much it causes to be directed more toward the sun on one side of the orbit and the other pole on the other side it is we have four seasons on the earth and because of that guilt it caused the planet Venus we tilted three degrees he kills three degrees there's 88 planets and all of them except orbit around the Sun is the only planet is me and you yeah Venus benches is the morning star is wake up and be prepared I asked the question once when is the darkest at night the majority said at midnight Laura did you see the full moon last night full moon last night to you people the blood moon again because it's gonna happen Norris Venus Venus is the Morning Star is that happen in the morning as we turn the corner what would happen if the Earth was 45 or 90 degrees Wanted full of Greece my sister happy you live in Washington and she's hearing right now Washington Seattle Washington would be in the Arctic Circle article and notice in the North Pole yes which is much colder is is a midnight sun in Paris France in summer Rivers in Paris Francia I experience I used to play third base for the Army baseball team foreign why does the Earth rotate on its axis rotations and stays that way because of gravity gravity is gravities will keep you on the ground I Don't Need No song lyrics to raise my hands when they're gonna sing and I know many of you song leaders say that you know why I don't and I think gravity lift up my hands but the song leaders they have to tell them to some of you that not even with a crane can lift up your hands downstairs they tell you still Danny they don't lift up their hands I don't need for them to tell me you know they necessity it seems like your hands are anchored to do that is foreign foreign foreign flows through an electric wire electrical it creates a magnetic field magnetico the greater the electric current is the stronger the magnetic field in a similar way human electricity in the brain and nervous system the electricity create human magnetic fields as a compost magnetico sumanos so Andrea when the battery on your cell phone is dying you don't have to plug it into your electric outlet nothing I can to follow Allah just hook it to your body implementation and it'll charge that's why they call it a cell phone yourself uh only it'll take 70 hours you know it'll take 70 hours amen man he creates enough electricity to charge an iPhone in 70 hours because everything we we do is controlled by electrical signals running out of your bodies and because the Earth is still dead the world is out of Taylor El Mundo stuff Revelation 16 8 apocalypse is he says Ocho and the fourth angel poured all his bile upon the Sun and power was given unto him to sports men with fire El cuarto Angel de Ramos of Del Sol Hombres con fuego and men were scored with great heat and blessed him the name of God which is power over those plagues and they repented not to give him glory place that they will rot in their flesh and foreign Thessalonians give me the privilege of staying as long as I want to but I don't want to abuse of the Privileges [Music] but this is more important than the other food of course I know that we need it let you know right there there will be no service this evening so can you give me a little extra Tempo okay because I I wanna I wanna close this because you have to be prepared you know Muertos but
