[37:50] [Music]
[37:52] amen the Lord Jesus Christ bless
[37:55] you
[37:58] we're GNA open
[37:59] our our Bibles in the Book of Amos
[38:02] chapter
[38:11] 3 drink some water because it's
[38:23] hot last time we were speaking on there
[38:25] is a man here that can turn turn on the
[38:29] light I want to keep myself in that line
[38:32] a little
[38:34] bit until the Lord guides
[38:40] me and the Bible says reads like
[38:49] this Prophet surely the Lord God will do
[38:53] nothing but he revealed his secret unto
[38:56] his servants the
[38:58] prophets let us
[39:00] pray beloved God and Heavenly
[39:03] Father we thank you in this
[39:08] evening we place ourselves in your
[39:12] hands waiting upon you to help
[39:15] us like I've said
[39:18] before we don't have our own
[39:22] message because it is your word and your
[39:25] message and we're going to speak on
[39:28] it asking that it might be a blessing
[39:30] for your
[39:32] children and also to
[39:35] me because I'm the most needed one among
[39:38] all of
[39:40] us we ask this in the name of the Lord
[39:42] Jesus Christ amen amen may be
[39:51] seated I'm going to set my time
[39:54] here um
[39:58] we were speaking about
[40:01] light what I don't want is to do a shock
[40:05] uh electric
[40:10] shock because we need to know how to
[40:12] conduct the
[40:14] lines how many of you have you had an
[40:17] electric shock at your house
[40:21] okay and you're just like
[40:24] startled um
[40:27] but if you
[40:30] notice uh outside of your
[40:32] house there's some uh some control
[40:35] something to control it and if there is
[40:38] a a an electric
[40:44] shock uh those lines are going to go
[40:49] off to prevent a
[40:54] fire so wor
[40:58] testing and maybe I'm going to mention
[41:00] some
[41:03] things that are probably blow your
[41:06] mind but don't get
[41:11] scared because here we have the control
[41:14] that is the word of
[41:16] God and he can set everything in its
[41:23] position so we spoke about the natural
[41:25] part
[41:29] but today I want to speak about the
[41:30] spiritual
[41:32] part and the word of God tells
[41:36] us that God does not do
[41:39] anything without
[41:42] first revealing it to his servant the
[41:48] prophet if there is any
[41:52] person that wants to know the secret of
[41:55] God
[41:56] so the first thing you have to
[41:59] do is to listen to the voice of a
[42:04] prophet how many love hearing the voice
[42:07] of a
[42:09] prophet according to the
[42:13] message the prophet of God
[42:17] says that the first thing that existed
[42:20] in
[42:22] eternity when he was the self exist
[42:25] existent one
[42:27] that existed by
[42:29] himself he was
[42:32] thinking he had in his
[42:35] thoughts to
[42:37] express
[42:40] something the first thing he
[42:44] expressed was let there be
[42:51] light when he expressed that thought or
[42:53] that
[42:54] word because before the
[42:57] word first it was a
[43:00] thought so
[43:02] then when it was
[43:05] spoken the logus came to to pass or the
[43:10] prophet
[43:11] said it was a little
[43:14] light that started spinning
[43:16] around the prophet
[43:19] says that was his
[43:23] son the logus
[43:26] was his
[43:29] son now when he was with the
[43:32] logos then he
[43:35] said let us make
[43:39] man according to our
[43:42] likeness and her
[43:45] likeness so
[43:48] then he made a spirit
[43:52] man to the image of
[43:55] God
[43:57] created he male and
[44:00] female we're good so far
[44:03] right so
[44:07] then when that Spirit
[44:10] man prophet of God
[44:17] says that he would lead all the natural
[44:22] things but it took
[44:25] man made
[44:27] flesh to
[44:30] rule upon all these
[44:33] things they asked the prophet brother
[44:37] Bram what is the
[44:40] difference between Genesis
[44:43] 126 and Genesis
[44:47] 27 and he answers and
[44:49] says they're the
[44:53] same but one is a spiritual
[44:58] and the other one is a natural
[45:01] being but the man that
[45:04] sinned was a natural
[45:06] man he wasn't a spiritual
[45:13] man so then we start seeing how the
[45:15] light starts
[45:18] condescending the prophet calls it and
[45:22] says God revealing himself
[45:27] through
[45:29] time through these
[45:33] beings but it came there was a
[45:38] point where God was already
[45:41] perfect it was the father was the
[45:46] son and his
[45:50] spirit so God was already
[45:54] perfect so when man
[46:03] sinned we're g to we're going to we're
[46:06] going to stop here a little
[46:10] bit and we're going to say it was God
[46:14] the
[46:20] logos the spirit according to the image
[46:23] and likeness of
[46:24] God
[46:26] how many can see the logus
[46:29] there that was
[46:33] there that's when go when God said let
[46:36] us it wasn't any
[46:42] man it was a man in
[46:46] position of what God had given him to
[46:49] rule
[46:51] upon that's how the scripture
[46:54] says let him rule upon the the the fall
[46:58] of the Earth the
[47:00] fish that is the right
[47:03] man but when this man
[47:07] fell we've heard this many
[47:09] times this man
[47:12] fell when God called
[47:18] man he wasn't calling him because he was
[47:21] uh playing hide and
[47:24] seek
[47:27] or because he didn't know where he
[47:30] was because God doesn't miss a
[47:35] thing you can hide
[47:40] anywhere you can be in the
[47:44] most but God knows the condition that
[47:46] you're
[47:49] in that's why when he said
[47:52] Adam
[47:54] Adam
[47:56] where are
[48:02] thou because Adam was playing their
[48:05] hiding the Tre it's because he was
[48:07] calling
[48:11] Adam because the position that he had
[48:15] left he he was in his right
[48:18] position he said
[48:20] Adam I'm going to go a little
[48:23] fast he said Adam
[48:26] the prophet of God
[48:29] says Adam had the rulership upon all the
[48:34] world
[48:38] Man became man or God upon the
[48:42] earth I want you to see
[48:45] men look at yourself and say me the god
[48:49] of the
[48:50] earth that's why last
[48:53] time I I I com I did a little
[48:58] comment that many want to have the
[49:01] power to move
[49:05] mountains to heal the sick oh that's
[49:12] good but the position that God is
[49:14] calling you
[49:18] to is for you to have the position of
[49:23] ruling on the position that has given
[49:27] you what is that
[49:30] position we're going to see what the
[49:33] prophet
[49:38] say to be a
[49:41] son a daughter of
[49:45] God that's why the thing that God has to
[49:48] restore is
[49:51] man because if
[49:54] man
[49:58] is reconciled with
[50:02] God now the man is in his
[50:06] position to be able to
[50:09] speak and bring
[50:11] words into
[50:14] existence
[50:16] otherwise you will not be able to do it
[50:22] look
[50:24] man
[50:27] I couldn't
[50:29] understand why
[50:31] Sarah would call Abraham his her
[50:36] Lord because
[50:38] Abraham was the god for
[50:42] SAR we saw it this morning
[50:46] right Moses was the
[50:48] god for
[50:51] who for for
[50:54] Aaron
[50:57] So when you say when when you
[51:01] pray when you say
[51:04] Lord who is your
[51:10] lord man in his
[51:12] position is a
[51:16] God and I I I'm not afraid to say
[51:20] it and I know that many
[51:23] people they struggle with with
[51:27] this because the order of God is the
[51:29] next
[51:31] the first we have
[51:35] his he said I will not do anything
[51:37] without first revealing it to
[51:41] him and then after he has the
[51:46] prophet I'm gonna read as the
[51:54] prophet and message
[51:57] adoption uh n
[52:03] page can I read it because that way you
[52:06] can believe it
[52:07] more uh the prophet reads like
[52:16] this how that God has set some in the
[52:18] church through the labor
[52:21] pains through
[52:24] what the sisters can tell us a little
[52:26] bit about this it's not
[52:31] easy it's not easy to bring to
[52:35] manifestation a gift of
[52:38] God the prophet of God
[52:42] says God never takes his gifts to
[52:46] Heaven he always leaves them on the
[52:50] earth for the benefit of his
[52:53] children he says
[52:58] oh they get tremendous
[53:03] sometimes when a church is groaning
[53:05] under the persecution of the outside
[53:08] world Believing on the Lord
[53:15] Jesus that the prophet of the Holy Ghost
[53:18] is just as real to us as it was to
[53:22] Pentecost how they groan and cry under
[53:25] labor
[53:26] pains but when they are
[53:29] born how many of you have been
[53:32] born check
[53:35] yourself I'm not going to ask you I'm
[53:38] not going to ask you to raise your hand
[53:40] but you have to be consci
[53:42] this if there is something that the
[53:44] devil wants to
[53:46] finish is the spiritual
[53:49] homes because he
[53:52] knows that there is growth in there of
[53:55] his
[53:56] children now you young
[54:00] people be vigilant to this but when they
[54:04] are
[54:07] born and positionally Born Into the
[54:09] kingdom of
[54:14] God then the Holy Ghost has set in the
[54:17] church some
[54:21] Apostles some
[54:23] prophets some
[54:26] teachers some
[54:29] pastors some
[54:32] evangelists and then he has given into
[54:35] there speaking with
[54:37] Tong interpretation of
[54:40] Tong
[54:42] wisdom Gifts of
[54:44] healing all kinds of
[54:48] Miracles so where is
[54:52] this if you want to see Miracles and
[54:54] signs
[54:57] mind then you have to get into that
[55:00] body you cannot reject
[55:03] it if you
[55:05] rejected you will never be able to see
[55:07] those
[55:10] things you say brother but they have
[55:12] prayed for
[55:15] me brother I've been in the most holy
[55:17] church
[55:19] here and I've been up and down and
[55:21] nothing
[55:23] happens it's because you haven't
[55:26] recognize what God has given
[55:31] you God has placed
[55:37] Apostles the devil doesn't like
[55:40] that because that is his
[55:43] competition because the devil also has
[55:48] Apostles if
[55:50] you're the devil has Apostles
[55:54] too
[55:56] he has false
[56:00] Christ because this is a battle this is
[56:04] a of one Kingdom against the other
[56:08] Kingdom we have been
[56:11] hearing the restoration of the
[56:14] Kingdom this is a
[56:16] battle and you have to hold
[56:21] your you have to to know what you have
[56:24] believed in
[56:26] because if
[56:28] not the devil is going to play dirty
[56:32] to never let the
[56:34] devil come and tell
[56:36] you that you don't need those
[56:41] things don't open up your mind to
[56:44] that the prophet says in
[56:48] here this has never
[56:50] changed it will never
[56:53] change
[56:55] the prophet
[56:58] says after you are here inside
[57:03] where in that
[57:10] body today we had a good lunch right
[57:13] raise your hand all those that had a
[57:14] good
[57:15] lunch I I don't think I think some of
[57:18] you
[57:20] didn't but the natural
[57:23] body
[57:26] the word of God tells us that the word
[57:28] the nature itself teach us this Natural
[57:33] Body teaches us many
[57:37] things when you
[57:39] eat when you pray for your
[57:43] food so that food goes to the
[57:46] body and in that
[57:48] body here
[57:51] inside there is some gastric fluid
[57:55] how many of you know about
[58:00] that that gastric
[58:02] fluid what it
[58:05] does is that it takes the
[58:08] food and it melts
[58:12] them breaks it down on such a point that
[58:15] they become liquid so
[58:18] then when they become
[58:23] liquid then the body starts processing
[58:28] them within the same organs that we have
[58:33] inside and that's when you start
[58:40] like that's
[58:44] when but when you're going through those
[58:46] that gastric
[58:48] fluid
[58:52] brother it's because you're going
[58:53] through the body
[58:56] to bring
[58:58] benefit of of
[59:02] Health if you eat
[59:08] meat so then the body is going to take
[59:10] the minerals or the substances of that
[59:13] meat and it's going to take it from
[59:15] there what it
[59:17] needs for that body to M maintain
[59:22] itself now
[59:25] the prophet of God
[59:30] says going to go to page 50 of this
[59:34] message and the prophet of God
[59:42] says sure it
[59:45] is the holy spirit
[59:48] says I have uh put
[59:52] trials I tested him in this
[59:56] I tested him in that
[59:57] way I have knock him down knock
[1:00:01] down if you have felt yourself knocked
[1:00:04] down don't don't think it's the
[1:00:09] devil the holy spirit is
[1:00:12] saying I have knocked him
[1:00:17] down I have put him in
[1:00:21] sickness I have stricken him
[1:00:26] I have step upon
[1:00:30] him I let the devil do anything he
[1:00:34] can but he will lift up
[1:00:41] again
[1:00:45] see he would rise up
[1:00:48] again I have gotten him sick I have done
[1:00:51] this to
[1:00:52] him I put him in the hospital
[1:00:57] I took him outside and did this to him I
[1:00:59] do that other
[1:01:03] thing I put his wife against
[1:01:07] him has it happened to you
[1:01:12] brother what do you say oh the devil
[1:01:17] no don't get SC for
[1:01:21] that it
[1:01:23] says
[1:01:25] I turn his neighbors against
[1:01:29] him don't raise up your hand but who has
[1:01:31] a neighbor that that is like
[1:01:34] that I turn everything
[1:01:37] around but that didn't change a bit of
[1:01:42] why because you are in your
[1:01:45] position that God has called you
[1:01:50] to you're not moved by a
[1:01:53] goip in your
[1:02:00] position because when God said let there
[1:02:02] be
[1:02:03] light there you
[1:02:07] were what is light
[1:02:09] for when you turn on the
[1:02:13] light well we don't have cockroaches
[1:02:15] here but you're going to see them or do
[1:02:18] we do we have
[1:02:20] them well I haven't seen them
[1:02:23] here
[1:02:25] when you turn on the
[1:02:29] light you're going to start seeing all
[1:02:31] the animals
[1:02:37] running but when the light of God is
[1:02:41] spoken to bring into
[1:02:43] manifest the children of
[1:02:47] God when God said let there be
[1:02:51] light so then the logus appeared
[1:02:54] and there you
[1:02:59] were and it it
[1:03:03] appeared and when light came
[1:03:06] pass according to John chapter one in
[1:03:09] the
[1:03:10] beginning was the
[1:03:13] word the word was the
[1:03:17] word and the Word was made
[1:03:21] flesh and dwelt amongst us
[1:03:25] and I
[1:03:26] ask when did that
[1:03:30] change it hasn't
[1:03:34] changed God is still making himself
[1:03:37] flesh through his
[1:03:43] children that word did not stay there
[1:03:46] 2,000 years
[1:03:47] ago that word
[1:03:50] continued and it it still Advanced more
[1:03:56] and because of that
[1:03:58] word you are here
[1:04:02] now because by the word of
[1:04:06] God all things
[1:04:09] subsist that hasn't
[1:04:12] changed
[1:04:14] then the first thing that God does when
[1:04:17] you're
[1:04:18] born he puts you under a
[1:04:23] Ministry we saw it this
[1:04:27] morning so then the Holy
[1:04:31] Spirit he's
[1:04:33] there
[1:04:35] controlling taking control of that
[1:04:40] body when you need
[1:04:44] something then the Holy Spirit he is the
[1:04:49] leader he says oh such sister so and so
[1:04:53] needs something
[1:04:54] okay okay I'm going to send the
[1:04:58] pastor going to send the
[1:05:01] teacher she's a little
[1:05:04] confused I'm gonna send the teacher so
[1:05:07] she can understand that she's my
[1:05:11] daughter and I'm her
[1:05:23] God
[1:05:29] if there is someone that is getting out
[1:05:31] of line a little and he's getting into
[1:05:35] sin so then he says we're goingon to
[1:05:37] send the
[1:05:39] Evangelist because he is the one that
[1:05:41] knows his
[1:05:45] needs the prophet
[1:05:53] says
[1:05:56] though he kills
[1:05:58] me in him will I
[1:06:02] wait the Propet say I killed his
[1:06:07] family I took this away from
[1:06:09] him I did all of
[1:06:14] this he rose up
[1:06:19] immediately though he killed me even
[1:06:21] though I will serve
[1:06:23] him
[1:06:28] you're probably struggling with some
[1:06:34] situations this is something very
[1:06:35] personal I don't like to talk a lot
[1:06:38] about
[1:06:40] this but I got
[1:06:43] home and I asked my
[1:06:46] wife have you talked with
[1:06:49] God she said
[1:06:52] yes and he asked her again have you
[1:06:54] talked with
[1:06:55] God and she said yes
[1:06:58] have I said what did he say to
[1:07:03] you he said what do you mean she said
[1:07:07] what because when I say that I speak to
[1:07:09] God With
[1:07:12] God it's because there was a
[1:07:19] conversation don't think that in your
[1:07:21] mind it's like like speaking to a
[1:07:26] wall okay I already said
[1:07:29] that
[1:07:32] no I was going through Highway
[1:07:37] 70 the Lord said this to my
[1:07:41] heart he said there is a lot of
[1:07:48] tiredness and I say I don't
[1:07:52] understand
[1:07:55] you know when God speaks things
[1:07:56] sometimes you don't even
[1:07:57] understand so I said Lord what do you
[1:08:01] mean he said there's a lot of
[1:08:06] tiredness and I didn't ask anything
[1:08:11] else but when I got
[1:08:13] home and I saw those two
[1:08:16] pictures and I stood in front of
[1:08:20] them I said Lord I believe
[1:08:22] you I believe your
[1:08:26] prophet and I believe there's a
[1:08:30] Ministry why are people
[1:08:35] tired he said it's because they're
[1:08:37] counting my coming as
[1:08:40] slackness and people get
[1:08:47] tired and it threw me
[1:08:50] off I said
[1:08:52] Lord
[1:08:55] I said Lord yes I'm
[1:08:58] tired I said I'm tired
[1:09:02] Lord sometimes I feel that I
[1:09:06] cannot I would like to give you more but
[1:09:08] I
[1:09:10] can but he gave me a scripture that
[1:09:14] says those that wait upon the
[1:09:20] Lord shall renew their strength
[1:09:25] please
[1:09:30] stand wouldn't have any more time to
[1:09:33] read the
[1:09:33] scriptures
[1:09:36] but let me tell you
[1:09:47] something don't get
[1:09:52] tired just get a hold of the little you
[1:09:55] you
[1:09:56] have this is the
[1:09:59] truth do not get
[1:10:01] discouraged or if you're
[1:10:03] tired I understand because I have been
[1:10:10] there I've been at the point of saying
[1:10:12] lord I can't do it
[1:10:15] anymore but you know what the problem is
[1:10:18] I said I
[1:10:20] can't I can't go back
[1:10:24] I've tried so many
[1:10:26] times but I haven't been able
[1:10:29] to you know what I
[1:10:32] see comes to my mind Lord where am I
[1:10:35] going where shall we go
[1:10:42] Lord a beer is not going to give me the
[1:10:45] satisfaction that I have in
[1:10:48] you
[1:10:52] dance is not going to give me what I
[1:10:55] need
[1:10:59] vices are not going to give me what you
[1:11:01] give
[1:11:06] me do not change this for
[1:11:10] anything if God called you to be a Son
[1:11:13] of
[1:11:14] God do not lower yourself down to be
[1:11:18] king take with pride this word with PR
[1:11:23] and stand
[1:11:27] still and say
[1:11:30] Lord whatever

[1:12:09] thankful because God redeemed
[1:12:13] man to redeem
[1:12:21] man and I'm thinking
[1:12:25] on these men that are over
[1:12:27] there that that are
[1:12:34] abroad and I remember those
[1:12:37] words that the prophet heard and they
[1:12:40] said brother
