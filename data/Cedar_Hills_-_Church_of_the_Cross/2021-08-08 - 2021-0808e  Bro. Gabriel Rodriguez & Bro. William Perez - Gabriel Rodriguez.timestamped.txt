[35:42] [Music]
[35:54] [Music]
[36:04] so how's the youth doing we had a great
[36:07] camp this past weekend
[36:09] you guys still fired
[36:12] [Music]
[36:25] i'm just here tonight to share a little
[36:27] bit of a testimony
[36:30] testimony just take a little bit of your
[36:33] time but
[36:36] so you know
[36:39] i was actually talking with uh brother
[36:41] moses when he was like
[36:43] [Music]
[36:47] and he said he was like because tommy jr
[36:50] told him that he's giving a testimony
[36:52] next
[37:00] [Music]
[37:06] and i don't know about you guys but i'm
[37:07] in the same situation
[37:13] you guys can be seated
[37:16] i think i did that at the children's
[37:18] church like eight years ago too
[37:20] and
[37:24] but uh you know oftentimes i was
[37:26] thinking i was like
[37:28] like what's my testimony if i haven't
[37:30] gone out and
[37:31] god hasn't brought me out of all these
[37:34] things
[37:39] but i think it's better to look at it as
[37:41] how much greater is it that god kept us
[37:43] from all those things
[37:50] and even though i didn't go through all
[37:52] these things
[37:56] i still have a lot of things that god
[37:58] has done for me in my life
[38:00] i wanna just possibly say to you
[38:03] and so uh first i'd like to start with
[38:05] something that happened about
[38:07] it was january of last year
[38:13] we're there working at the hospital and
[38:15] we're getting close to our inspection
[38:20] [Music]
[38:22] and uh so there were these uh switch
[38:26] gears
[38:26] they were about 480 volts
[38:32] and as part of the inspection we had to
[38:34] go and uh cover up these pipes that had
[38:36] the wire coming in from outside
[38:45] and when this first happened i kind of
[38:47] just like brushed it off because i
[38:48] didn't think anything of it
[38:54] but i think i gotta give god glory for
[38:56] everything that he has done
[39:01] and so uh they asked me they were like
[39:03] hey we need you to go
[39:04] cover these pipes up in this gear
[39:11] and so in the switch gear you have the
[39:13] pipes on the floor
[39:14] [Music]
[39:18] and the gear goes on top of the pipes
[39:20] and it has all these metals
[39:22] [Music]
[39:24] and so the wires come and they'll get
[39:26] terminated
[39:27] [Music]
[39:38] so we go and we tested it made sure it
[39:40] was off we
[39:44] and i was like all right i'm good to go
[39:46] i could i could stick my arms in there
[39:48] i'll be fine
[39:54] so then i was there working and your
[39:56] arm's literally right there by the metal
[39:58] that's got
[39:59] 277 and 408 volts
[40:06] and uh so they're working for a couple
[40:08] minutes
[40:11] then my superintendent he's a older
[40:13] white man
[40:14] he walks in
[40:17] [Music]
[40:19] and he talks like sam elliott he was
[40:21] like what are you doing
[40:27] and so i was on i was working on the
[40:29] ground so i kind of sit up and i was
[40:31] like
[40:33] [Music]
[40:36] what do you mean i'm working like what
[40:38] do you want me to throw 100
[40:41] and then as soon as i sat up and got
[40:42] away he went and he pushed me onto the
[40:44] floor
[40:45] out of the way
[40:49] and he was like this is hot
[40:55] and me i was being ignorant
[40:59] i was like no it's not we tested it
[41:03] and then he grabs a meter and he goes to
[41:05] test it
[41:07] [Music]
[41:10] and from bus to bus he had about 480
[41:14] volts
[41:16] and they say 120 stings you
[41:21] enter 277
[41:24] [Music]
[41:27] and then 480 i mean that's something
[41:29] someone will lose their life over
[41:43] i wasn't afraid i didn't even know but
[41:45] god was still taking care of me
[41:51] [Applause]
[41:58] [Music]
[42:09] okay all right so
[42:12] i look at it this time
[42:35] [Music]
[42:37] and so i decided to go up to idaho
[42:42] idaho and uh when i told brother caleb
[42:46] he was kind of like what
[42:50] okay but i already had it made up so i
[42:53] went
[42:53] but you're like i guess he also if we i
[43:06] [Music]
[43:10] and i freaked out i mean
[43:13] it was just like brother diego said
[43:18] that most of it wasn't even cove it was
[43:20] just my fear
[43:26] there i was couldn't it happened because
[43:28] i couldn't smell or taste some food that
[43:30] my mom was made
[43:35] then through all that i mean it's like
[43:38] quarantining it seems like it just makes
[43:40] you sick
[43:44] just having to be there stuck in your
[43:46] house
[43:49] but and then so even through all of that
[43:53] even though
[43:54] i probably overstepped my boundaries
[43:59] it was only me and my brother sam that i
[44:02] got copied
[44:06] and in our whole house he still kept the
[44:09] rest of my family safe
[44:14] and even in that sickness nothing
[44:15] serious happened to me or my brother
[44:19] [Music]
[44:21] and then after all that uh i went to
[44:24] our my brother caleb's house our past
[44:30] and i went to wash his cars and he was
[44:31] just asking me how i was doing
[44:37] [Music]
[44:58] it put like a doubt in my mind as to who
[45:01] i was as a
[45:02] son of god
[45:09] then even now thinking about me even
[45:11] thinking that it's
[45:14] [Music]
[45:16] ridiculous
[45:21] and he was able to pull that seed out
[45:23] because that's not a seed of the son of
[45:24] god
[45:30] and i just thank god for my pastor
[45:34] he's there that in those times that i
[45:36] needed him he was able to
[45:38] put me back into shape
[45:46] then fast forward to about four months
[45:49] ago
[45:54] i decided to make another smart decision
[45:57] [Music]
[46:09] it's electrical work i'll get a job
[46:12] anywhere
[46:23] [Music]
[46:36] but in that time i actually got to do a
[46:38] lot of things i wouldn't have been able
[46:40] to do with the job
[46:59] and it's crazy because five months
[47:00] without a job
[47:05] and maybe i didn't have everything i
[47:08] wanted
[47:15] and uh so i want to give a big thanks to
[47:17] my parents first off for the roof over
[47:19] my head
[47:22] um
[47:26] and there were a lot of brothers here
[47:28] that gave me work
[47:29] yeah brother juliana
[47:48] that was another thing when i was
[47:49] working for my pastor
[48:03] [Applause]
[48:04] the best job
[48:15] [Music]
[48:29] i had everything i needed and i still
[48:31] didn't have an actual job
[48:36] then after that work with brother caleb
[48:38] kind of finished up
[48:42] i got back and i talked to him and i
[48:44] told him that
[48:45] i needed to get a different job
[48:57] and he told me he was like no just be
[49:00] patient
[49:13] he told me that wasn't the right reason
[49:18] then that same week
[49:22] i actually got a call for an interview
[49:26] at the job that i'm currently uh
[49:38] my main thing i told them was i need to
[49:40] be in church
[50:10] and so uh just for you used
[50:14] this one it's like it's easy to get
[50:17] in a rush and think you need to be at a
[50:20] certain point
[50:21] in your life
[50:36] and being patient doesn't mean to take
[50:38] forever to do something
[50:41] [Music]
[50:55] [Music]
[51:03] and that's my testimony for y'all and
[51:06] i just pray that it blessed you
[51:32] amen god bless brother gabe this is
[51:47] this evening
[51:59] amen i had a little
[52:02] little thought this this evening for
[52:04] this evening
[52:08] and i pray that the lord or helps me out
[52:13] and uh too so i can pray that i can
[52:17] express it the way that he gave it to me
[52:18] amen
[52:21] amen let's uh turn into our scriptures
[52:26] we're going to turn into the book of
[52:28] first peter
[52:32] and we're going to start with the
[52:35] chapter 2.

[52:51] wonderful
[52:52] wonderful service we had this morning

[53:24] all guile

[1:00:34] we're all all winners here

[1:00:43] and in reality in reality
[1:00:47] there's and i'm going to put myself
[1:00:49] there
[1:00:52] there are so many things that i'm not
[1:00:54] good at i cause
[1:00:57] that if somebody would say that hey
[1:00:59] you're really good at that
[1:01:03] they would be lying because i know i'm
[1:01:06] not good at certain things
[1:01:35] you can ask my wife i try my best
[1:01:40] but there but there are so many lies
[1:01:43] about
[1:01:44] about how how good you are
[1:01:49] and in reality
[1:02:17] and every hand will say oh i'd love to
[1:02:19] serve the lord
[1:02:22] but how many of us fail at times
[1:02:30] you know what i thank god that we have
[1:02:32] the pastor
[1:02:46] i'd rather have somebody like that
[1:02:50] then somebody's saying oh it's okay
[1:02:54] you're you're good the grace of god will
[1:02:57] will
[1:02:58] will will straighten you out la gracias
[1:03:04] you know i don't want anybody like that
[1:03:07] in my life you're not
[1:03:08] gonna see me because that's not gonna
[1:03:10] help us out
[1:03:12] that's not gonna help you that's not
[1:03:13] gonna help me out no level
[1:03:42] because i'm not a big
[1:03:52] right but i love to speak
[1:03:55] on animals
[1:04:08] and if anybody gets a little hungry i'm
[1:04:10] sorry
[1:04:23] you know it starts its life off
[1:04:26] way up in the mountains
[1:04:29] [Music]
[1:04:31] it starts itself up in the in the in a
[1:04:34] tiny stream
[1:04:38] and it starts itself up with not even
[1:04:40] knowing who his parents are
[1:04:46] it doesn't even know who his mom is or
[1:04:48] doesn't even know whose daddy is
[1:04:54] that there is something inside of them
[1:04:57] that sustains them you know i laugh
[1:05:00] sometimes as
[1:05:01] as you hear these documentaries on on
[1:05:04] animals
[1:05:06] is
[1:05:21] has made them the way that they are
[1:05:23] today
[1:05:27] and it's it's funny for me to hear that
[1:05:31] because we know that that's not the
[1:05:34] truth
[1:05:37] we know that there is something that has
[1:05:39] been placed inside of it by god almighty
[1:05:46] so here is this little little salmon
[1:05:50] salmon starts off as an egg in pieces
[1:05:54] starts growing and growing
[1:05:58] and one day as it's going down the river
[1:06:01] india
[1:06:02] el it finds itself in
[1:06:05] that it was born in fresh water
[1:06:09] and aguas fresca and it finds itself now
[1:06:12] in salt water
[1:06:15] it finds itself in the ocean
[1:06:19] and here he is surrounded by all these
[1:06:21] other salmon
[1:06:25] and here they go on living their life
[1:06:29] they're they're they're growing
[1:06:32] crescendo
[1:06:33] and they travel anywhere from two
[1:06:36] thousand to three thousand miles
[1:06:38] uh away from where they were born
[1:06:45] remember in the ocean if you ever if
[1:06:47] you've ever been underneath the ocean
[1:06:51] you know just fyi just in case you
[1:06:53] didn't know information
[1:06:55] you can't see very far no underneath
[1:06:58] water no puerto
[1:07:00] so it's not like us where we can you
[1:07:02] know get on top of a mountain and say
[1:07:04] hey oh there's south there's north
[1:07:06] there's east northwest
[1:07:11] they're underneath water
[1:07:17] so here they are and they spend about
[1:07:19] four years of their life
[1:07:23] but something something inside of
[1:07:28] them after about four years
[1:07:31] this was the cuatro ano there's there's
[1:07:34] a
[1:07:34] there's a calling inside of them
[1:07:38] and it starts to it starts to um as they
[1:07:41] mature and as they get to adult size
[1:07:49] they long to go home
[1:07:53] it's something that god puts inside of
[1:07:56] them
[1:07:59] let's go to proverbs 27 17.
[1:08:05] and this is really this is this is so
[1:08:07] awesome how god works
[1:08:12] and this is a very uh uh
[1:08:15] familiar scripture this is a scripture
[1:08:19] that
[1:08:19] uh that was uh when we had our our men's
[1:08:23] meetings and all that
[1:08:27] we would start off with
[1:08:30] it says iron sharpener
[1:08:34] so a man sharpeneth the countenance
[1:08:51] because they've just they discovered
[1:08:53] years ago
[1:08:56] the question was how do these fish
[1:09:02] get back home it was such a mystery
[1:09:06] era you talk about millions and millions
[1:09:09] of fish
[1:09:13] that have been out in the ocean
[1:09:16] that are two three four thousand miles
[1:09:18] from where they were born
[1:09:23] after all this time traveling in the
[1:09:26] ocean
[1:09:29] how do they know how to get back
[1:09:46] [Music]
[1:10:03] and it shows them where to go
[1:10:07] it tells them to go east or to go west
[1:10:14] but that's not the amazing thing
[1:10:18] remember there's thousands of rivers
[1:10:21] that pour into the ocean
[1:10:27] hundreds of thousands of rivers
[1:10:31] so here's this salmon navigating
[1:10:36] but god has given him an incredible
[1:10:38] sense of smell
[1:10:42] um
[1:11:08] so what does that mean guest
[1:11:10] significance well he
[1:11:12] gets to the point
[1:11:15] where he finds the river in cuentral rio
[1:11:18] remember he's going from sea salt
[1:11:21] back to fresh water
[1:11:37] [Music]
[1:11:52] that's oh but it doesn't stop there
[1:11:58] that's not where the end is just because
[1:12:02] god has shown you where to go
[1:12:05] and we read the scripture i walk by
[1:12:07] faith and not by sight
[1:12:11] and we know where to go we're on the
[1:12:14] right path
[1:12:16] there's still a one eye obstacles that
[1:12:20] are gonna face us
[1:12:33] but thank god we're on the right river
[1:12:38] amen amen so you can tell the devil
[1:12:42] when he brings you stuff in your life
[1:12:46] i'm saying that you're not gonna make it
[1:12:59] he starts smelling a little bit more
[1:13:15] i'm not on the i'm not where i should be
[1:13:19] thank god i'm not where i used to be
[1:13:22] but i'm on the right path
[1:13:28] that that uh that smell is familiar
[1:13:33] it is something that that is in my
[1:13:36] memory that i
[1:13:37] that i know i'm on the right path
[1:13:42] so during this time durant's
[1:13:47] the largest uh fresh water migration
[1:13:50] route of any salmon
[1:13:56] salmon is on the yukon river it's yukon
[1:14:00] and the migration that that they've
[1:14:03] recorded the longest migration
[1:14:08] from the time that they leave the ocean
[1:14:10] to the time that they get
[1:14:11] on the river
[1:14:16] is 1900 miles
[1:14:21] so imagine imagine you're three thousand
[1:14:24] miles
[1:14:26] in the ocean and now you've come to the
[1:14:30] river
[1:14:32] but you've still got 1900 miles left
[1:14:38] now this this
[1:15:00] [Music]
[1:15:20] that's the time when the eagles come out
[1:15:36] and it's not just a few you know
[1:15:39] but there's hundreds of thousands sienas
[1:15:43] that go down these rivers
[1:15:47] the biggest one that they've seen
[1:15:51] along this particular river rio
[1:15:54] particular
[1:15:55] over five million salmon
[1:16:00] so here they are as they're swimming
[1:16:18] goodness there's a waterfall
[1:16:23] they said wow he said wow it was sure
[1:16:27] easy
[1:16:28] when we were coming down the mountain
[1:16:32] into
[1:16:46] you see when you when you go when you go
[1:16:49] with the flow
[1:16:52] in the korean you think that you have
[1:16:55] no problems it's
[1:17:01] what easy know the pastor said the
[1:17:04] ministry
[1:17:04] said that serving the lord was hard
[1:17:13] you're still going with the flow
[1:17:28] that cries
[1:17:56] anybody been
[1:18:00] and here they go akivan they've measured
[1:18:03] the salmon
[1:18:04] and medidon salmon that has
[1:18:07] jumped almost 10 feet over a waterfall
[1:18:10] avrincado
[1:18:33] [Music]
[1:18:37] wow so here he is
[1:18:41] but not only does he have to face the
[1:18:44] falls
[1:18:48] not only does he have to jump over the
[1:18:50] waterfall
[1:18:52] but
[1:18:53] [Music]
[1:19:06] and here is that salmon just going up
[1:19:11] battling every day now i want you to
[1:19:14] know
[1:19:15] something and i
[1:19:18] and i really love what brother caleb
[1:19:20] said this morning
[1:19:23] and he said many times that so many
[1:19:26] times that we have just
[1:19:28] just meat just coming out of our teeth
[1:19:33] so much word that has that has been
[1:19:35] brought forth
[1:19:38] there's so much uh there's so much word
[1:19:40] that that we have heard
[1:19:43] and yet this salmon
[1:19:46] as soon as he stops or as soon as he
[1:19:49] enters into fresh water
[1:19:53] he eats no more yeah
[1:19:56] he lives off of what he has eaten
[1:20:02] and that sustains him for the journey
[1:20:06] i want to ask you youth i want to ask
[1:20:08] you adults
[1:20:09] this evening has whatever the
[1:20:14] what the word the word that has been
[1:20:16] brought
[1:20:30] no i need more oh necesito

[1:20:36] we have received enough
[1:20:39] there is so much word already
[1:20:43] so much life that has been given to
[1:20:59] life but yet we ask for more
[1:21:03] but here are these salmon is there going
[1:21:06] up the stream
[1:21:09] they don't eat anymore they live off
[1:21:36] [Music]
[1:21:55] the smell is not familiar
[1:21:59] you know the devil tries to bring you
[1:22:01] something in your life
[1:22:04] tries to bring you through a crossroad
[1:22:08] hey this this route is better
[1:22:11] it might take you another route
[1:22:14] but there has to be something inside of
[1:22:16] us
[1:22:18] when we when we start going around
[1:22:22] when we start comparing it to what what
[1:22:24] the word has given us
[1:22:27] [Music]
[1:22:28] that doesn't smell very well
[1:22:32] that doesn't that doesn't smell like
[1:22:35] home
[1:22:35] no well
[1:22:50] imagine 1900 miles navigating rivers and
[1:22:54] streams
[1:22:58] until one day
[1:23:01] one day they come here
[1:23:18] this is exactly
[1:23:44] through all these waterfalls
[1:23:48] through all these things that are that
[1:23:49] are coming against them
[1:23:53] the time for them is what they
[1:23:57] struggled
[1:24:00] what they live
[1:24:07] to get to that place
[1:24:10] so that they could die but uh
[1:24:17] you know we talk about so much of living

[1:29:26] but how many can truly say that that
[1:29:28] they want to die out to themselves
[1:29:32] amen amen
[1:29:36] read a quote from brother
[1:29:50] out in the ocean you can find them
[1:29:55] it says what we call humpies the salmon
[1:30:01] when they come up there when they go
[1:30:03] before that run comes
[1:30:17] salt water but they're actually
[1:30:19] freshwater fish
[1:30:23] here they come right up there and spawn
[1:30:26] about every four years
[1:30:31] and die as soon as
[1:31:00] uh
[1:31:24] [Applause]
[1:31:26] there's nothing that you can do about it
[1:31:42] but the law of nature makes them
[1:31:47] knowing that they go up there and spawn
[1:31:49] in the hole
[1:31:55] and spawn in the hole and die imorie
[1:31:58] brother branham says you just can't beat
