that are out on a trip take care of them God bless those that are on hookup this morning certainly is very good to uh to be able to voice the word this morning to the Saints of the Living God Santos we want to start a new series though we could have stayed on that series of the worshiper for from now until to the coming of the lord we feel led of the Lord to go this route for maybe a few a few messages or more we'll see what the Lord has we appreciate those that went to to uh El Paso that would that would uh that uh that supported the the people brother Adolfo and his congregation there companies each one of your brother brother Noah Reyes in his family God bless you it's good to good to have you in our midst Reyes [Applause] amen and my and my Primos and primas amen and all the visitors God bless you and well let's get into the word yeah anybody in a hurry this morning okay all right well we won't have we won't have service this afternoon but but uh let's get and we'll go as far as the Holy Spirit leads us amen the first message on God's Great economy and let's put a subtitle to that the three pools and at first it may seem like what's the correlation between the economy and the three pools and you'll see as it as it unfolds has everything to do with it amen so you can open your Bibles to the book of First Timothy the first chapter and the fourth verse and you have it you can say amen and we're going to go slow today this is not going to be a message that's going to make you jump and Shout but it'll it'll be a message that will that will settle your heart amen is that okay okay because sometimes we want to be on the horse all the time just take your we just take our time today first Timothy 1 4 says neither give he to Fables an endless genealogies which minister questions rather than Godly edifying which is in faith so do presentes since I want to read another version and it says this is nor to give heat to myths genealogies foreign which produced questionings rather than God's economy which is in faith yes and Faith so that's what we're after today is Understanding God's economy you may be seated in the economy of God there are secrets that have been hid from the beginning of time secrets that must be revealed in order for the economy of God to function correctly this is the only way for us to meet the challenges of the day the challenges of the hour there has to be an Administration administration of the economy of God that is suitable for this time and this is what is called the fullness of times keep your Bible's handy because we've got quite a bit of verses to go through today Ephesians the first chapter in The Ninth and the tenth verse nueve having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself mismo that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him let me read you another version of this so you can get this and with a view to an Administration that is suitable to the fullness of times once again an Administration that is suitable un Administration to the fullness of times when we talk about the economy the first thing that most people think about is ES money right how is the economy going to understand we think about money talk about the economy of God first thing we think about is going to talk about tithing and offering well that's a that's that's a part of it but the economy of God is so much greater than what we think so then one must understand our pastor he preaches the message the anatomy of economy and you understand the anatomy of economies let's for one moment break down these two words anatomy and economy and that way we can broaden our thoughts as to what God really is telling us today the very word anatomy the very word anatomy is the study of the structure or internal workings of something I want you to get this so can we just and we'll just repeat it in English the study of the structure make sure you didn't leave me hanging this morning the study of the structure or internal workings of something okay that's what the anatomy is so we are going to study the the structure or the internal workings of the economy of God now economy then if they can put that up economy is a system of interrelated production and consumption activities can you repeat that just production and consumption right the economy is based on these two things once again production and consumption activities that ultimately determine the allocation of resources within a group the production and consumption of goods and services as a whole fulfill the needs of those living and operating within it is and an operation is gracias okay so now we're talking about God's Great economy and each one of us when we are functioning correctly in the body of Christ we are a consumer is and we are a producer this is very important to get this is because a lot of times we are so used to consuming gimme gimme gimme Lord give me give me Lord I need this Lord I see that we are not just here to be consumers we are here to be producers but in order to consume there has got to be resources that you can tap into step in the grace in the great economy of God he has resources that we must tap into now we don't want to just be consumers we many times we we find that even in ourselves and everyone can examine himself when we consume but produce nothing our economy is out of balance yes or yes COC we're into balancing our economy now it's it's it's a subject that is so vital in nowadays in the day that we live what the anatomy of economy does it places things in its rightful place so that the economy can operate efficiently we're going to find out how the economy of God must operate not only with us on a personal level but how it is to operate in the Body of Christ you see it's sad to say but people in general don't worry about their spiritual economy of their spiritual economies unless they're natural economy uh gets bad I'm going to say that again we don't really worry about our spiritual economy spiritual until our natural economy turns back when we when we stick our hands on our wall and we don't have uh two dimes then it's like oh Lord what's going on why are we always judging our economy by how much money we have I can't do this and I don't have no money no more No usually because you're robbing God yeah they're like I knew he was gonna go there stick around we're gonna go to a lot of places that's what we're trying to do this morning we're trying to take inventory because there seems to be an imbalance in our lives and there's something inside of us that is crying out I want to be part of God's Great economy yet we're so focused on our own personal economy so in order to understand the anatomy of economy and to study it is this is what second Paul was saying in second Timothy yesterday the second chapter in the 15th verse it's a study to show thyself approved unto God study to show yourself approved oh I'm studying oh Lord really loves me I gotta raise at work I got more money than I know what to do with thank God I've studied it out and I'm doing really good right now but it says a Workman that need is not be ashamed you've got a study study to rightly divide the word of Truth amen I'm going to say it again you have to study are you with me everybody with me I wanna I want you to get this this morning so what are we studying it's the time that we study the anatomy of economies we must learn to to dissect the parts dissect the parts the parts las partes and know how to rightly divide the parts and find the function of each parte now we come to church and turn around and look at your neighbor come to church and and you see them all the time and you say oh well that's brother so-and-so but if you ask that if you can rightly divide how many of you know everything that your brother or sister know how to do well then why aren't we studying it we can study the Bible we can study the message but when do we find time to study each other we are the fourth Bible okay we're we're coming into the economy of God even if you believe that you are part of God's Great economy are you sure about it you're not part of this part keep your hand up all right part of God's Great economy how many believe that your neighbor is part of God's Great economy neighbors are part of the Great economy but we're not studying the economy then we know our goods and bads and in betweens but sometimes we don't even know what we're supposed to be doing now we're talking about God's Great economy we claim them to be the body of Christ under our brother and sister are part of that body investors but there comes a time that even though the body of Christ is one unit it has many parts yeah I want to know what each part the part that each one plays I want to know how to better help other parts can one part be missing and the body still operates sure see somebody that maybe they they don't have a leg they're still alive they function somebody may be missing an eye or an ear whatever it might be and they can still live but they don't function at their Optimum because they're lacking a part that was originally intended to be a part of this body okay then let's see where we're gonna go from here John the fourth chapter and the seventh and then 9th through 11. Juan capitulo cuatro versus when we talk about the economy of God I'm talking about every piece I'm talking about every position I'm talking about every office I'm talking about every member that is a part of the body of Christ okay John chapter 4 and verse 9 verse 7 first we've been reading this the whole time on our other subject but we can't get away from it here's the woman at the well again probably the subject that brother Branham hit on more than anything else there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water okay now now she was in a condition her economy maybe wasn't so good because she couldn't even come and get water with the rest of the women because of choices bad choices she had made in life verse 9 then the woman of Samaria saith the woman of Samaria unto him how was it that thou being a Jew you asked drink of me now verse 10 Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knew is the gift of God that's what he is and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink that would have asked him and he would have given the Living Water now this is the part that I want to get to win and we've hit on this before but it goes with the message today the woman saith unto him sir thou has nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that Living Water she's looking at him she's stereotyping him she's putting him with the other men in her life she's telling them you have nothing to draw with in other words no one had ever been able to pull out of her she really was yeah are you with me nobody had ever been able to draw out of her and prove and show that she was a daughter every man in her life before that had failed to draw those things but none of them were Jesus watch what the word draw means things that is used to draw with but draw also means to withdraw money from a bank or Source but draw also means to attract someone in order to bring them to a place or an event now which one do we want to use let's use all of them because you came today because something was drawing you to an event this is an event this morning this is not just church this is an event why did you come because something is drawing you something is telling you you gotta come and have fellowship with your brothers I have something for you so something is drawing us this morning maybe your economy is drawing you is remember they had consumed her they had taken everything out they had stolen things from her you can read in between the lines but not one of them could produce anything for her they were consuming but not producing watch watch as the as the Lord unfolds this today by saying you have nothing to draw with he was putting Jesus in a certain category Jesus and we do that all the time I'm burnt out with church I'm disappointed I don't want to go to church anymore all these excuses because your economy is valency COC you're missing something you're missing a a relationship with Jesus Christ well that church did this to me yeah brother and sister in the church yesterday you have nothing to draw with and then you ask of me give me the drink what is it they have income in contact with Jesus Christ and he's talking to her but as he's talking to her she's contacting her spirit okay now I want to ask you a question have you ever talked to each other but but contact each other's spirits amigo Good Hunter what else do you know so yesterday a year the young people had a had a good good meeting I need a so in this meeting yesterday for the young people get one of the microphones look at this somebody and in this in this meeting our young people were asked the question is can you just real quick to say just you brother asked the question that you asked them I am so we asked them the question is and a lot of people will say well I am I'm a barber I'm a student I'm this or that but we had them not tell us what they do but who they are okay not what you do no Lucas you might be a construction worker that's what you do it's not who you are I I know you're part of your identity is is what you go with I understand that yes but I want to go deeper than just that's who he is so they started getting the point and they'd stand up and it was like popcorn going off we'll hand it out to one of them let's see what they were saying I I anybody want to know what the young people were saying yes I am a servant of the most high God and worship is what I'm all about and that's what I'd be yes so that's what I'd be yes who else I'm a daughter of the most high King and I'm a psalmist for his people and I live to praise His name and that's what I'd be about that's what I'd be about yes which other one sister Genesis I'm Genesis and I was there oh I'm Genesis and I was there from the beginning even her name says it all huh come on give me a couple more of the brothers here on mouthpiece for God and I'm about to be storing a feature like I'd be so eternal life come on give me another one [Music] I will praise the Lord and give him all my wish that's what I'd be about that's who you be that's who she be one more I am proud I am who I am that Jesus Christ paid the penalty of death for us come across for us all right that's who I'd be we are the purchase of his blood he's contacting her spirit which is something that we should learn to do you gotta contact the spirit it is not about just where you're going on vacation and what you've been doing lately you know nothing about them all we know know is what each other what each one of us likes to do for entertainment hello everybody we can tell you where everybody's been around but what about the real you and the real me sit down and have a conversation with each other contact each other's spirits and get to know one another why are we doing that because our economy is out of balance we don't even know what parts are are there I want to know this morning that's what he's trying to show us people love to consume consume consume and never want to produce anything and our economy is out of whack the economy is like a computer it consists of two basic systems hardware and software Hardware so you can understand the economy Wellington they're like onomia but let's focus here on the hardware for a moment the hardware of the economy it's divided into two basic types are you ready inputs and outputs inputs in the economy are called resources yeah yeah all right again are usually called products goods or services and under inputs people always want to know what they're going to received why do I get out of it ask anybody for a favor nowadays what am I going to get out of it satisfaction that you help somebody what about your output yeah is your input and your output is it balanced oh I think this is a good subject what does the lord gave it to us what products are you producing what's goods or services are you producing it's like when when people receive the Holy Ghost I got the Holy Ghost it's not just to say I got the holy ghosts it's not to say I got the Holy Ghost so now I'm going to heaven that's not the purpose of why it was given the holy ghost coming into you is the input yes but now it wants to produce a product it's the output what is it what's coming forth God ah let's let's find out what's coming forth from our lives because we're always looking at it at somebody else I ain't even gonna get into that you receive the holy ghosts Jesus said the same works that I do that means shall you do also and Greater Works than these shall you do but you cannot I mean you gotta Focus first of all and you gotta find out who you are you'll never know who your neighbor is not your brother's sister until first you find out who you are what part of the economy you're playing I remember when my mother passed away yeah she was a prayer Warrior she would be in the closet at two three in the morning she's gone now who's going to take her place because the body still needs people prayer warriors hello well we don't need preachers no more the body still needs preachers to get into that in a moment not throwing at anybody I'm not against any brothers trying to do is there's more to the economy of God than we are that we are saying notice this now in the body of Christ there's a perfect economy and when you receive input it causes you to is become somebody else's inputs are you with me all right now what are you doing with what you are what the input is and only those that can understand they realize that they are part of this great economy they're the only ones that can function correctly in the body second Timothy 3 7 says ever learning is my God it's hot up here stepping on we need a little Danny going on is it hot out there kind of we were we were in Africa Islam was in Africa there was all these Kings sitting in front and there was this man is that was behind one of the Kings it was so hot that day he had this big old umbrella huge and he's behind the king his King holding that yes and he you should have seen him he was like this is he was trying to keep it together this was two hours in yeah yeah I was tired just looking at him I almost felt like going up and helping him and then all of a sudden I guess he forgot for a moment that that he was doing this for his kingdom but all of a sudden he gets you can tell the light bulb turns on people are watching six hours later he's still like a rock not even moving I said man what a lesson talk about digging deep that's what we got to do we gotta dig a Little Deeper I know this is not ever learning the Bible says learning and learning and hearing and learning that's why we can read the whole Bible over and over and over again listen to every message of the brother Branham over and over again we are ever learning ever receiving input is but never coming to the knowledge of the truth never able to produce that's my question to people I want to be able to produce but for me to do that you gotta know all my resources I gotta know all the resources that God has in his economy when somebody says I accept the prophet but not not not a passage that's valency am I because he never took pastors away from his economy works together I received the pastor but I I don't receive the evangelists I don't want that the Apostle or or the prophet or the oh okay I'll have the pastor your economy is unbalanced economies are we understanding this this morning we're unbalanced God's economy there are people that will fulfill every word oh here we come and we find that we're ever learning never able to produce the out the right output appropia watch the prophet in the message the India report report closely because this tells you this gives you pieces Christ had the spirit medida that was Christo the whole ocean all right he said that was Christ the whole ocean this little gift that's in your servant here is brother is just a little drop out of the ocean that's in the entire ocean is in the little spoon it's in each little drop is but not as much here we go now and so our Ministries and so our Ministries ministerios come on are the chemicals that's made up que component in the great economy of God this is what he's this is what the prophet is saying so then how can the chemists produce what he wants to produce if he don't have all the chemicals our Ministries are these chemicals of the economy of God now we got to be able to have this got to have the apostles that's the chemical that's an anointing you got to get this for later on that's an anointing that's an office a pastor Pastor is another that's another anointing that's an office it is another chemical when you put a couple of chemicals different chemicals together I'm going to say it again when you put a couple of different chemicals what is going to come foreign foreign yes but there's still chemicals here oh yeah I love brother Branham yes that's the fountain where the message came from a fountain is separated and it brought a chemical of Apostles not a chemical of pastors it came from one rockete what is it producing there's more that still needs to be produced I'm not stuck back there this is the present now you've got to deal with what we have we have been given the resources that are needed David could not build the temple because of all the blood he had shared but his son built the temple but Solomon or let me let me take that back but David pero David left all the resources so that Solomon could build the temporary I'm gonna say it again we have been left the chemicals that it's gonna take to finish the job I don't know if you believe me or not but that's what I believe you have the resources but we gotta know and let God put it together the way he wanted God will use those chemicals the way he wants but all together it's more of it than it was in the one esmas fullness of the god the fullness of God in his church Iglesia I'm going to say it again the fullness of God in his church that is God's economy is the stoppers can I go for a little bit I tried the message and it didn't work because you don't have the right mixture I'm going to say it again you don't have the right mixture is oh you're gonna find out you do that's not too late I'm gonna do my own thing God bless you again but you'll be like you'll find out what your output is not what the economy of God you see do you see now why even the economies in the home are not operating at its best optimo because the chemicals don't mix right that man don't tell me what to do is I'm My Own persona wow you're tough what are they good job hello everybody the economy is in the homes there's no respect between the husband and the wife no respect from the children to the husbands worse and worse and what is the family producing is you fill in the blanks you know what you're what your family is producing families let's turn the corner in order to really understand the anatomy of economy one must understand the purpose of the three pools what is the pool it's to draw is come on now you're the woman at the well yeah you have nothing to draw with nothing you knew the gift of God that was before you could be asking of me for a drink of water after a while it was give me of that water yes there's a purpose of understanding the economy understanding the three pools you ready to go with me on this at least Sunday school we're learning here this morning the three pools are three stages of ministry you're writing notes down you should know this already but three pools is three stages of ministry how many know that Noah had three pools yeah okay Moses three pools Jesus Jesus three pools brother Branham three pools and we know you can continue on but let's let's just focus on this for a moment we know that Moses have three pools and and in the book of Deuteronomy the 18th chapter and the 15th verse says this day 1815. it says the Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet Prophet from the midst of thee of thy brethren yo of thy Brethren remember that part of thy Brethren like Revelations don't worship me like unto me unto him brother Brown says Jesus was the word and he he was the prophet that Moses spoke now we also understand that all scripture is compounded so in order to understand this Prophet you've got to understand Moses yes or yes I think I'm losing you if you're sleepy you need to go home make memes get up but just be real real quiet and you can leave okay you didn't have a good night you just never know but just be very quiet okay you want to stay there praise the Lord I'm not trying to be funny I'm saying it I really mean that yeah in order to understand this Prophet you have to understand Moses and when God calls a man he equips the man to do the job even though the man doesn't see all that he's equipped with mismo he gives him all the resources that he'll need to do the job God gives him his Spirit he gives him his word he gives him gifts and signs and wonders he gives him the ministry that will help him and all the people that are he goes to deliver them and he goes to put all those signs and wonders into actions he was testing it out over here now it's time to go let's say it's go time okay become friends Pharaoh this is the 10 Flags yes putting into action all the signs and wonders that the Lord said his last message was then to get the people behind the blood we know that the death angels and they would receive Mercy now Moses is on his road to the promised land if you want to read it you can just mark it down and read it at home Exodus chapter 4 verse 1 through 9. Moses and the Lord's telling him the first sign and the second sign but we find out in this scripture that the voice of the foreign come on come on nobody oh come on it's before the burning bush what does he do after that yeah the hand right fix his hand in his bosom pulls it out and it's leprous puts it back in and it's clean it's Olympia all right now then he says that then and the Bible says if they will not hear the voice of the first signs or that of the latter signal then take the water and pour it on the ground and it'll become blood okay now we're seeing all these things the problem is this this is what I'm telling you about about God's economy gotta know where you are dwelling where you live today this is important now it is important if you have to pinch yourself pinch yourself this is understanding now the economy of God because if we don't go far enough we stay stuck at a certain stage of ministry God is doing in our time under the first pool or the voice of the first signal the rod was turned into a serpent and when the action came it was time to throw it down it became a serpent he said praise God but all of a sudden something else happens the thing about it is it can be imitated okay come on now I need I need you get you to get it get give me your undivided attention under the first pool it can be imitated and that's where people want to stay yeah you'll find out in a moment why is but when the reality came his Rod swallowed up the two other rods or serpents and now those serpents we're now in Moses oh there's something good now now watch us now under the second part was the cleansing of the heart now you're gonna begin to see a prophet like unto Moses when he stuck his hand in his heart and he pulls it out it is now a Lapras hand leprosy is a type of sin and the same way the prophet of the age was when he could discern the heart pull out the sin is uh-oh are you with me going on now I want you to come with me here now so let's stop for a moment because we want you to really get this too the very day when the messenger when he begins to declare his message then he says this is in the message anointed ones at the end times he said the first poll was healing and everybody wants to stay in the first pool but it can be imitated e the second pool was prophesied but the third pool was the opening of the word the Mysteries were to be revealed no more he said there is no more higher order to reveal the word Prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the words okay and remember the third pool was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth [Applause] that's been sealed in the word and then he says do you see it okay oh I asked the Lord for a good job is that the biggest thing you've asked foreign [Applause] are you satisfied there that's that is 20 years later I remember the Lord healed me from this praise the Lord have you grown from that because the greatest healing foreign come on now we we got to go a little farther yeah okay watch what he says do you see it we have to understand God's Great economy you have to know the message you have to know the output and the output is the responsibility it's not responsibility that the input is giving you okay no I think a couple of people got it local do people not want to go any further because it took a sacrifice to get where you're at but people don't want to go any farther because they're not willing to pay a greater sacrifice come on church I want you to get this though it's too easy just sitting there and hearing a message but when the message comes inside begins to give you a responsibility your part is in the body of Christ are you willing to pay a greater price come on it's a challenge this morning well I believe the devil believes I'm a Believer brother the Devil is a Believer too the Bible says that Satan believes that God is one too and he trembles it's not enough just to say I'm a Believer come on come on go with me on this we got to go a little farther now yeah we take and we keep the first pool his body we're always going to need healing but I also want pools because I want the leprosy of my heart to be taken away pull out the leprosy so that when the hand goes in again church what do you want but I want the third now too because I don't want just things that are imitated imitate number one number two yeah but you cannot imitate the word you can't say and cannot imitate the third pool why it is the Revelation it is the unfolding the complete unfolding of the economy of God seven Thunders uttered what was it thundering I don't know are you paying attention I'm not wow and people will say ah don't get into the Thunders that that's somewhere sometime later I like the way our founding Pastor would say when they would say oh the Thunder's revealed or not he would say they are revealing and this is little at a time it's an unfolding but not somewhere where it was written but he said I would ride it in the hearts of the Believers unfolding a little at a time that's great economy of God and I have like 10 minutes in 15 20 30 minutes yes don't get all sad on me right away foreign okay let's keep let's keep going on this now the three pools of brother Branham he said they were symbolized in Little Birds I don't know if you have that or not but little birds or is that right amen and under this first pool his hand would change colors you could tell if it was a bacterial or viral infection right right it was the it was the first it was praying for the sick and as long as it's first pool everybody loves you brother Branham prophet of them look at this Jesus Jesus as long as he was healing their sins oh Jesus of Nazareth he is the king yes let's take the clothes and just put it on the floor it didn't even take one week later that the same ones that had put their clothes down and was hailing King of the Jews they were the same ones that were saying crucified blasphemy under first pool everybody Church guns people love them love the brother but then from the little birds that came into doves and then people began to get a little nervous because under second pool economy of God is under second pool Spirit would lead him and now he knew the intents of the Earth in such in such a place this is going on and this is where you're from and this is this is who you're married to is you work over here and and what was he doing to discern the hearts but you have a hidden leprosy in your heart the moment he began to to open up the heart corazones that's right yes people began leaving why because they had sin in their hearts they didn't want that to be opened up they were happy with healing of their bodies I don't want no one to know about this oh that man knows too many things they stopped going and all of a sudden there weren't as many followers um when the lamb pulls back the seals where's the lamb pulling the seals back from they don't understand he found a man from Kentucky he could sit in his throne from there began to speak the Sills these Revelations began to come back we love you brother Brandon yeah but all of a sudden they began to hear things that they had never heard before this is the first seal is the sixth what was he doing it was a land open in the field but now ahora as in the times of Jesus when Jesus said unless you eat my flesh I don't know about that he's putting too much on himself he was good under one or two pools now he wants us to eat his flesh and drink it they couldn't go to the third because they were too carnal nobody else we can never go any farther with God as long as we stay in our carnal conditions not only did the people leave but 70 of his disciples all because no my church don't teach that the rabbi didn't teach us that Christian teachers wonderful but God was an oldies the economy of God was how he would dispense or distribute himself amongst human beings the economy of God produce the man the god man but from that one man you would come for sons and daughters that the economy of God would grow come on hot let me tell you we've got to know we are in that economy when you get them to the third pool there's there's so much fighting about all these things that third pool that's brother Branham another say we have the third pool and you have people over here and then you have people over here and there's no balance the economy is out of balance Glory oh you have this fighting believes it like this is no when the seal is broken open it starts the war it starts a scriptural War oh prove it to me I'll prove it to you well I've got this quote this quote as much as we don't like it it's got to be like that there's a purpose behind that I am now I'm not saying for you to go out and start fighting with everybody but you stand for the word and that's why our founding Pastor would say this is when I hear people saying oh we got the third pool he said ask them a simple question what part of the third floor that's simple because the third pool has three parts forget this parties right so which part is it I think I better stop huh all right let me just go just for a little bit more thank you for hearing me on three parts of the third pool and here you have people struggling brother Brown says something happened yesterday okay come on these are the three parts this is God's economy what happened yesterday right when the when the seventh seal was open third pool reports of that seven seal or the third three parts of the third pool together okay what happened yesterday that's right it was the opening of six Hills the book of redemption it was the whole plan the whole plan was opened under six Hills write these things so you don't forget them you gotta know these things when the when the first part it happened yesterday what was it once again it was it was six seals that were unfolded this was the book or the Plan of Redemption you got that we got the plan look look and everybody's happy with the plans and they don't want to go any farther oh come on now I'm trying to bring you up a little higher I want to bring you up a little higher this morning so under the first part it's the book or the Plan of Redemption and it's laid out for you and I yes we've got that and then that's what happened yesterday six seals were unfolded something then happened today that was yesterday yes something happened today what happened today the scene was said we heard a good message right on Sunday my brother was talking about the scene because when the seventh seal was open it was silence silencio nothing moves not a symbolo just a scene nothing going on they would give away the secrets heavy then was close oh I won't be able to get to my other part but I'm gonna set it up for the next part so heaven was close why was Heaven closed because all the activity was on Earth that's what happened today the scene was set and now there was a people that came on the scene the actors of the seventh seals you could Now call Jesus on the scene how did they know how to call Jesus on the scene because a prophet had already come to show us [Applause] why am I here we go just a few more okay and then I'll let you go then something came in an unknown time what was the question when seven Thunders uttered and he saw like letters right is that it was spelling out something he said but I couldn't see what it was spelling out watch this now so something happened yesterday it doesn't happen today something came in the same way in the time of Daniel that the dispensation of the Gentiles it started with unknown tongues the dispensation of the Gentiles also finishes with unknown terms oh my what part then how does your economy look right now economia you happy under first you're okay under second pool is but today we live the economy of God is finished that would be the fullness of times so he identified it I can skip this but uh but but young people now make sure you elderly people don't say nothing so that just so you you all learn you know are you ready so he identified the third pool five identifications so Anton says young people name me one of them anybody Oh I thought we were message Believers here we got a work to do he identified the third pool identification what were those identifications go ahead and tell them Noah oh come on you all have to know this is nobody's gonna give me not even one answer Ola are you young who's that who said that all right he's Young all right he's young at heart we'll give it to him I bless you my brother good to see you all right we're finishing up I'm finishing up much there's too much here we'll we'll go next week and then you won't see me for the next 20 days okay all right throw that in there but I do I do I do ask that you all would would I need a few few weeks after next Sunday I'm going to take a few weeks off and and I asked to pray for us all right yeah we got to take a little bit of time and digest everything that's gone on but until then we're going to keep on going so the first thing young people was squirrels brought into it yeah you're gonna remember this is Grandpa Pedro would say the weakest ink David better than the best memory is we got squirrels coming into existence speaking the word creation creation number two numero dos but the brother gave you the first one Nobody Knows the second come on right there it out okay somebody help them the dead fish es he brought back a dead fish the healing of creation did you get that look up Thomas say it was the healing of creation number three was how do you write salvation salvation number four this is identifying is what did somebody say job thanks a lot guys you blew my cover all right I gotta give it to you though storm in Colorado and number five meet us tumor now when we look at this you have to know in this case of air which pole that you're living in we're finishing for today yeah I'm just going to finish with these last few Saints you've got to know what pool you're living under in order to know if you have the right economy but as you meet the challenges if you're coming to church and just want to see Miracle after Miracles you're staying in the first pool looking for a miracle for this God would rather heal you than do a miracle because healing test your faith [Music] if you want the Lord to cleanse your heart from all unrighteousness Bueno in the second pool he has searched the hearts but if you want to be reserved you've got to resurrect spiritually before there is a physical resolution and if you want a resurrection in your life this is the economy of God and where it is today your economic status by what is pulling you foreign at the two that's what determines it is does your economy permit you to create oh come on I'm finishing now and you create there's the people brother Jesus said Greater Works than this shall you do okay do the first words and then when you can do that then you can go to Greater World jumping right to the Greater Works come up higher this morning I want to end with this the economy of God I pray that it has been a blessing to you but I just want to just add this part brother William Feud come is the complete revealing of the word but not just the revealing remember what what I said in in El Paso those of you that heard the message when the word is being revealed says now now watch for this the word is being revealed that means that something's coming the message has been revealed the Mysteries have been opened what was coming perfect I want to be part of that economy or in the days of the voice of the Seven Things the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets in the days of the voice of the seventh Angels the great economy of God I don't know about you but we're going home and there is a kingdom yes that'll wipe out all these worldly kingdoms Jesus Christ will reign in that Kingdom we are his bride we will reign with him that cannot and will not fail that's what he came to bring now he says this is the time that is the time was not at hand previously as we as we finish you've been sitting for a little bit for your time in the wisdom and the economy of God this Mighty Revelation is though fully known to God it could not come forth thus we immediately learn the principles the revelation of God for each age can only come in that age only specific time look at the history of Israel Israel the revelation of God to Moses and even more specific came as the people Cried unto God and Jesus himself he came at the fullness of time he being the complete revelation of the godhead and in this age the revelation of God will come in its due time it will not alter neither will it be premature think on this he did well he El fin oi so I asked we have set a foundation fundamental for this message in this subjects I see people in lives and the Lord shows things my heart hurts because I see homes that are not balance balance I see relationships that are at balance they have a wrong economy they've left out the most important things so now just where you're at I either understand you say brother I'm just a little time of being in Balance I'm a little tired brother of not having the right economy in my home if you say me and my wife brother we need help this is we're out of balance the first thing you got to get yourself right and then go on to the marriage so I challenge everyone that's here whoever needs whoever needs a touch from the Lord whoever needs to be to be drawn or or pulled into the economy raise your hand if you feel that you have gone away from God and you feel the pull this morning then let us the Holy Spirit goes Goes Forth let it began
