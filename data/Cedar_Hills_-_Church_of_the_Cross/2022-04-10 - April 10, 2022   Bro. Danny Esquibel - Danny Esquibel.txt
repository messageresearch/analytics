[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen are you proud to say that you're one of them they were gathered in the upper room all praying in his name they were baptized the holy ghost came out for service came now what he did for [Music] i'm them glad that i can say i'm one of them [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] amen it's certainly good to have our pastor back this morning [Applause] [Music] amen [Music] but uh he kept us in prayer [Music] away i want to read here in matthew 21 god bless all the visitors god bless those online amen man today i brought you a giant prince [Music] and it says that when they drew nye unto jerusalem and were come to beth page onto the mount of olives then sent jesus to disciples [Music] saying unto them go into the village over against you and straightway you will find an ass tied and a cult with her loose them and bring them unto me young [Music] and if any man say ought unto you you shall say the lord hath need of them and straightway he will send them all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying tell ye the daughter of zion behold thy king cometh unto thee meek and sitting upon an ass and a cult in the fall of a nest [Music] and as you're being seated we're going to continue to read and then bless may the lord add his blessings to the reading of the word now it says right so we want to find out how meek he actually came where everything has been completely watered down right so we automatically get the definition of me and we we tend to put it into the terms of today right real timing though right real uh don't say a word about anything don't make any riffraff [Music] don't agree with anybody you know just just try not to say anything too previous no more [Music] you tell anybody anything and whoa i i got rights here right and it says that he came meek upon a donkey and the disciples went and did as jesus commanded them and brought the ass and the colt and put the punt put on them their clothes and they sent him thereon and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and straw them in the way and the multitude that went before and that followed christ saying hosanna the son of david blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest and when he had come into jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this and in the highest and when he was coming to jerusalem all the city was saying who is this and the multitude said that this is jesus the prophet of nazareth of galilee i think they put victory in there but that's good i mean but it's his triumphant entry right now we want to find out and has he had a triumphant entry in you and we see here that he came in a meek and lonely way so this is what was called his triumphant entry and jesus in the next verse verse 12 and jesus went into the church of god no no the church of god right right okay so let's just bear with me there and jesus went into the temple of god so we find out right here that coming to church just isn't going to get the job done you might come to church every service and this morning i'm going to piggyback a little bit yes i'm it doesn't matter how much church we come to import the bible says here that jesus was going to the temple jesus and the bible says it is in the temple the temple of the lord the house of prayer is right okay so it's getting a little further down two why did he need two he needed a dog okay so so sorry why two porquedos right so you ride one you lead the did other have baggage that like if you're hunting or you know you're outfitting you have you're riding one and you're carrying all your supplies right what was it that he needed two four i don't i come not to bring free but knowing but i come to bring a sword right and so the true definition of me if you read in matthew 5 five five verses it says blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth and so right away oh i gotta be real meek so i can inherit the earth are they [Music] does that sound like many of that he can enter into [Music] you're not whoa right say yes i come in the name of the lord no there's a difference and he who comes in the name of the lord and when the lord himself with the lord himself there's a difference one is blessed oh there's many that go to africa oh he was just going afraid there's many that go around the world and they go in the name of the lord they preach they teach in sin but there's no difference from him who comes in the name of he and that he entered into the temple he made a triumphant entry into the temple he's not coming into the church he's coming into the temple now how many temples of the lord do we have here this morning right we should be the temple as brother jerry preached a temple was structured and what did he come for those predestinated seed that god seen before the foundation of the world esperanza it had to be on the earth who kept it in darkness yeah [Music] when the s-o-n shines no wonder the gospel is that's good news but never a news never a news lieutenant news never news was there news like this news that he who made the promise has confirmed the promise that he's alive forevermore and have the keys of both death in hell was shook away all the gloom was shook away there shall be light again across the earth right so he had many victories victorious right how many believe that but he hasn't had his greatest victory he hasn't had the greatest victory yet jesus greatest victory is [Music] you need to be reconciled back to god and what needs to happen is that your nature must be changed we have preachers you know it's just coming to always [Applause] you gotta no the light la luz many today we try to find out as brother henry was talking henry and it says listen lay aside every week lay aside every week [Music] those are just the attributes but incredible separate yourself from maybe somebody unbelief right what our problem is today is that we like to walk as brother henry said we like to walk in darkness and we like to walk in the light he knows [Music] [Music] [Music] yes no they were tearing the pasta is forgive there's only one in darkness jesus i was uh i thought to myself where in the world wow where is it drawing its life from it doesn't matter how long it's been in darkness or why it's been kept in darkness open and maybe you find yourself in a church condition today uh go on and on right acetylene it's like gases or mixtures like brother abraham knows what i'm talking about right outside you got hydrogen you got h2 carbon dioxide you got all these i used to work in a welding store but you're carrying around a good mechanical can of gasoline and you have the mechanics mechanics but that's might be just as well you might be just carrying a gas a can of water right you say oh i got gasoline he brings you the spark park it makes an explosion what is it it's the very word up in you it'll wake it up now maybe you're dead this morning well i'm not dead as brother ronnie said right sister rosita running this is a problem i'm going to go on a diet oh yeah yeah i'm going to lose all we had brother henry i'm going to lose all this weight no no no no you are but right and i always say like i say it again point out the unbeliever to me i know which one is right all right so we all know which one's the unbeliever which one's the make-believer and which one is the the true believers and we heard wednesday we're here last yeah wednesday you might find yourself in all these conditions this morning romans 8 11. maybe you're in those conditions but maybe you might be waiting down with scents gizelle says maybe you might be in darkness maybe you might be a good church member but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead from the dead it wasn't the one [Music] [Music] he raised up christ out of history four o'clock oh they didn't make you like they made me no not physically but [Applause] the kindle the kindle bring a spark park that you're not carrying around is see my fuego oh but when this holy ghost comes and it takes that place it makes that fire burn more intensely now here's the one for you people to make more rapid rapido to quicken means to make more rapping it makes you faster right remember there's nothing like driving a car right you're going down the interstate there's a semi behind it right and i see people like my wife she likes to do this and i'm a backseat driver okay okay okay and and get next to a semi yeah and i'm a nervous wreck as it is i'm i'm people always tell me they look at me and they say man you're so calm easy i'm like all right and get around this time we got the power there's nothing like getting in a car and being able to just it opens up the carburetor yeah it blows [Music] no i like to hear my turbo accelerate of active growth into development man i gotta read the i wrote it down but i'm i'm my brother jimmy all right bro can't even read my own can't even write me my own way only i can't even understand my own writing but thank god for the smartphone i got it right here i got the definition and then it has a parenthesis a curve you're going one [Music] more brightly more intense than the sun it's a light that lion's your path and i said here to reach the stage of gestation at which fetal motion is felt that's what quickening does let me read that again to reach the stage of gestation at which fetal motion is felt there was a woman carrying a baby that baby had not moved [Applause] [Applause] to become more rapid growth rapidly maybe right now you're dead you say oh i'm gonna okay this [Music] maybe you what's the matter que pasa we didn't read our lines we're not ready for live action you want to know what it's going to take to go on the rapture so oh my gosh we're a bunch of lazy voca but you find yourself in that condition to be quickened means to be it's for him to say [Music] one of this and i don't know if maybe brother tommy jr remembers water before you say this one time this brother [Music] [Music] so this brother made me really really mad and yes the brother's here today if you were if you were wondering i know he wouldn't mind tommy jr [Music] what's the problem what do you need what what is it come on dad almost done it all right well yeah i didn't mention the brother's name no no no no [Music] okay well then what what are you you're going to preach wednesday or i said i better not escape well i just told you i just told you at the end right and so i said well let me let me go make it right with the brother right so is that going to be next week it's going to be next month why are you putting so much pressure on me let me feel it i feel good in me right i just i just want to fill out my emotions and then you go hit the bag [Music] get back to me in two minutes right it don't take a lot of time it takes one that is [Music] [Music] the lord told me the other day right this person was giving a testimony and they felt that their the blessing that the lord had given them by my grace is he that comes in the name of the lord no that's his grace it says his grace gracia but one of these days that grace will end time will be no more yes so today if you've heard his voice it's time to wake up is [Music] and it doesn't matter how long we've been in darkness when his word comes and that word pricks your heart and he comes into the temple then we have a blessed hope that we can be made alive with the same life that was in him now this morning i solemnly invite you this morning [Music] it doesn't matter what it is that you have to make right you know yourself i don't know [Music] [Music] and i want to bring to you this morning the good news is [Music] if you want to come forward if you just want to raise your hand whatever you want to do is [Music] i invite you now [Music] lord and by your word a true word that you have sent to us a word that was brought to us by a prophet lord and then listen apostles father that took that word lord and they brought it to us and made it alive to us the lord
