[4:29] second lesson on the book of hebrews
[4:35] let's open with the word of prayer

[4:42] celestial indeed it is an honor and a
[4:45] privilege
[4:49] to address
[4:50] your bride
[4:54] lord this
[4:55] i am venturing into this subject
[5:02] it's a a book that's real deep
[5:07] and lord
[5:09] it's a it's a book
[5:10] that hardly nobody
[5:12] goes deep into it
[5:20] and i know lord that if you if it wasn't

[5:32] i i wouldn't know what to speak
[5:36] but i want to thank you dear lord
[5:41] that you found favor in myself
[5:46] i've been the list of the ministers in
[5:48] this church
[6:11] and i want to confess to everybody
[6:13] that's online
[6:16] via internet
[6:18] that i am learning
[6:20] just like you guys
[6:25] as we're going to find out
[6:28] so i solicit your prayers
[6:49] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[6:54] amen amen amen
[6:58] so as i greet everybody who is online
[7:15] and we're still on verse 1
[7:20] and it reads this way
[7:25] god who has sounded right times in in
[7:27] diverse manners
[7:29] taking time passed unto the fathers by
[7:32] the prophets
[7:42] as in this last day spoken to us by his
[7:45] son
[7:50] whom he had opponent heir of all things
[7:52] by whom also he made the world
[8:21] now i'm gonna
[8:22] ask you a question so you can chew on it
[8:31] isn't he using a prophet isn't william
[8:34] branham our prophet
[8:36] prophet noah's william branham
[8:51] i got you thinking already
[9:06] myself myself
[9:11] he spoke
[9:12] to the prophet by by the prophets
[9:20] but brethren says that translation is
[9:22] not correct
[9:34] prophets
[9:48] he spoke by a prophet
[9:52] from prophet my question is which
[9:55] prophet was he talking about
[10:01] prophet
[10:13] and the whole multitude of the people
[10:15] were praying without at the time of
[10:17] incense
[10:29] and there appeared unto him an angel of
[10:31] the lord standing on the right side of
[10:34] the altar of incense
[10:40] and when zechariah saw him he was
[10:43] troubled and fear fell
[10:53] but the angel said unto him fear not
[10:55] zechariah for thy prayer is heard and
[10:58] thy wife elizabeth shall bear thee a son
[11:03] and thou shalt call his name john
[11:11] elizabeth
[11:16] and thou shalt have joy and gladness and
[11:19] man shall rejoice at his birth
[11:29] for he shall be great in the sight of
[11:31] the lord and shall drink neither wine
[11:34] nor strong drink and he shall be filled
[11:37] with the holy ghost even from his
[11:39] mother's womb
[11:51] and many of the children of israel shall
[11:54] he turn to the lord their god
[12:02] and he shall go before him in the spirit
[12:05] and power of elijah to turn the hearts
[12:09] of the fathers to the children and the
[12:11] disobedient to the wisdom of the just to
[12:14] make ready a people preferred for the
[12:17] lord
[12:31] [Music]
[12:32] so john got the father's ready entonces
[12:36] juan
[12:40] for jesus
[12:42] to to for jesus to welcome the children
[12:45] in the fold
[12:47] jesus
[12:50] christ
[13:18] behold i will send you elijah the
[13:21] prophet before the coming of the great
[13:23] and dreadful day of the lord
[13:31] notice this scripture
[13:35] i know you've read it a thousand times
[13:39] but did you understand it
[13:43] and he shall turn the heart of the
[13:46] fathers to the children
[13:54] and the heart of the children to their
[13:56] fathers
[14:00] it's two things right here
[14:04] first turn the heart of the followers to
[14:06] the children
[14:10] but in the last days
[14:12] the children turned the heart of the
[14:14] children to their fathers
[14:21] now this prophet and which the spirit of
[14:24] elijah falls
[14:25] as a prophet of
[14:27] spirit to the least will prepare the
[14:31] children to welcome back jesus
[14:38] jesus so turning the hearts of the
[14:41] fathers to the children convicted
[15:11] and that he might make known the riches
[15:13] of his glory on the vessels of mercy
[15:16] which he hid of four preferred unto
[15:20] glory
[15:38] not of the jews only but also of the
[15:41] gentiles
[15:50] notice that these vessels of mercy
[16:06] are you prepared
[16:09] are you prepared
[16:10] preparado
[16:12] that's why we come to
[16:13] our services
[16:15] amnesty
[16:17] you know we hear we hear those
[16:19] tremendous uh teachings by
[16:35] and this ministry of john had to do
[16:39] with the fathers of those elect ones
[16:48] something
[17:26] and they called it
[17:30] righteousness the
[17:33] the word of god was of no effect to them
[17:39] but john the baptist with the spirit of
[17:42] elijah
[17:44] connelly spirit
[18:13] venom said
[18:14] it is a memorandum that they were
[18:16] stronger than the gates of hell
[18:22] and it cut at the hearts of men
[18:40] was about to
[18:54] that spirit was taken by jesus as a
[18:57] spirit of what tomorrow for jesus
[18:59] because john
[19:00] had to decrease
[19:04] while jesus had to increase
[19:37] essos disciple they later became the
[19:41] apostles
[19:45] and they in turn
[19:47] internal they became the fathers of the
[19:50] church
[19:54] but since the fathers fell asleep
[20:01] the church has drifted once more
[20:29] and
[20:30] paul
[20:31] was a messenger to ephesus
[20:37] and to ask the gentiles
[20:41] but they didn't like him
[20:45] the jew didn't
[21:28] episode
[21:30] has in that spirit heal all the churches
[21:37] people are so relaxed
[21:40] oh because they think that they
[22:35] i was uh
[22:37] talking to the pastor some time
[22:53] well let me read it then i'll explain it
[22:58] but of the times and the seasons
[23:00] brethren you have no need there i write
[23:03] unto you
[23:11] why
[23:12] should i get here
[23:15] and keep
[23:16] teaching on the times in the seasons
[23:32] if we don't know about the times that
[23:49] that just keeps on going
[23:56] [Music]
[23:59] and that's the second time
[24:03] because they told the lord
[24:07] will you restore the kingdom at this
[24:10] time
[24:13] and the lord said yes
[24:16] it is not for you to know the times in
[24:18] the season
[24:29] for yourselves know perfectly that the
[24:31] day of the lord so cometh as a thief in
[24:34] the night
[24:41] maybe next uh
[24:43] bible study i'll explain that because
[24:45] it'll take a lot of time
[24:53] when they shall save peace and security
[24:56] then sudden destruction come upon them
[24:59] is prevail upon a woman with child and
[25:02] they shall not escape
[25:06] destruction
[25:12] in
[25:22] when all the nations got together and
[25:24] they say russia and united states
[25:27] [Music]
[25:40] they talk about this oh
[25:42] and they pass but there are a bunch of
[25:44] liars they like one to another
[25:51] picture yourself
[25:56] [Music]
[26:23] it was talking about the future
[26:28] that's that's why
[26:30] they didn't need to know about the times
[26:32] in the season in the time of paul when
[26:35] he said it to the people
[26:45] so
[26:46] it wasn't for the thessalonians
[27:02] when they think their peace and safety
[27:05] peace and security
[27:09] that the only security
[27:12] is like
[27:15] a people that is prepared
[27:18] for
[27:56] they lost their first love entonces
[28:00] supreme
[28:14] is
[28:27] is
[28:54] that the churches would be in this
[28:56] condition
[29:22] which was the original pentecostal
[29:24] doctrine
[29:38] until
[29:42] let me stop here for a moment
[29:46] jesus came in four offices jesus and
[29:50] cuatro officios son of abraham
[29:54] son of man
[29:56] son of god
[29:58] son of david
[30:00] now i'm going to give you another
[30:02] question so you can chew on it
[30:06] i
[30:48] is
[30:51] [Music]
[31:15] and she said yeah but the dogs hit the
[31:17] crumbs that fall from
[31:19] those comments
[31:22] she said lord
[31:26] when she said lord
[31:29] brother says that awoke the holy spirit
[31:36] and she got what you wanted
[31:41] and we know of course
[31:43] she appeared as the son
[31:56] it
[32:01] because lord is
[32:03] the son of god
[32:08] revelation 3 20 apocalypse
[32:14] behold i stand at the door and knock
[32:17] if many men hear my voice and open the
[32:19] door i will come into him and will stop
[32:23] with him and he with me
[32:38] the son of man or the son of
[33:22] because
[33:35] those mysterious is
[33:49] that
[33:50] is the same holy spirit
[33:55] back into human flesh
[34:00] parallels
[34:03] parallel
[34:12] the lord was there with abraham
[34:18] he was
[34:19] a human being
[34:22] and it has to come again
[34:32] when god was manifest manifested in a
[34:34] human being
[34:38] in lady austria in laodicea they put him
[34:42] out
[34:45] he was
[34:46] in the office of son of god establish
[34:52] and a grief from the church
[34:58] so he had to reveal himself again
[35:15] he listed and thou hears the sound
[35:17] thereof but cannot tell whence it cometh
[35:20] and whether it goes so is everyone that
[35:23] is born of the spirit
[35:27] starting with verse 8.
[35:43] and said unto him how can these things
[35:45] be responded
[35:50] jesus answered unto him are thou a
[35:52] master of israel and no it's not these
[35:55] things respond jesus
[36:03] i say unto thee we speak that we do know
[36:07] and testify that we have seen and ye
[36:10] receive not our witnesses
[36:21] if i have told you earthly things and
[36:23] you believe not how shall you believe if
[36:27] i tell you of heavenly things
[36:38] not us here they can say aki and i'm
[36:41] gonna give you this so you can chew on
[36:43] it
[36:49] and no man has ascended up to heaven
[36:52] well
[37:06] which is in heaven
[37:18] how could the solomon
[37:23] [Music]
[37:46] or standing on the earth
[37:54] i want you to see how
[37:57] privileged you and i are
[37:59] okay
[38:29] we had to lay in the presence of the sun
[38:39] to get
[38:41] ripened
[38:44] what for but
[38:46] we were just a blade of grass
[38:54] it was green like in the times of luther
[38:59] justification justification but the plan
[39:02] grew bigger to sanctification
[39:08] and by laying in the presence of the
[39:11] s-o-n
[39:12] it
[39:27] and iglesia so what does the sun do
[39:32] it bakes and
[39:34] all the green
[39:36] greenness of us
[39:42] amen
[39:44] and makes you a mature christian
[39:47] christian
[39:48] to the world and mundo
[39:51] the bible
[39:54] is a mysterious book es libro mysterioso
[39:58] the bible is god in word form
[40:05] he can only be interpreted by himself
[40:13] the human mind lamented humana is not
[40:17] capable to interpret the mind of god
[40:25] so if he is the only one who can
[40:28] interpret this book sierra estos is
[40:36] to whom
[40:52] that he could hide himself in the
[40:55] scriptures
[40:59] to the smartest theologians
[41:03] intelligence tied himself to the
[41:05] denominators
[41:09] he hit himself
[41:11] in every age
[41:14] he hit himself in the times of noah
[41:18] no
[41:30] and the world was made by him
[41:46] and his
[42:09] this is the book of god
[42:14] it is not a book of men
[42:18] this book exposes
[42:21] hear me
[42:24] hear me real good
[42:26] all you who are online
[42:55] abraham for instance
[43:00] do you think that he would have wrote a
[43:04] book of himself
[43:09] of his own cowardliness nest
[43:14] and that healy lied to the king
[43:18] already
[43:19] never would have he wrote a book like
[43:21] that
[43:23] how about jacob the deceiver
[44:52] those
[44:54] characters in the bible
[44:58] they would write only the good things
[45:03] then i asked the question
[45:06] who wrote the good the bad and the ugly
[45:09] guinness
[45:13] notice he can say hebrews
[45:16] 1-1
[45:25] in the in the greek it says god who had
[45:28] long long ago or some sundry times and
[45:32] in
[45:33] different manners spoke in thai past
[45:36] unto the fathers by the prophets
[45:47] i couldn't understand this
[45:49] this
[45:51] this scripture
[45:56] but notice
[45:57] has in this last day spoken unto us by
[46:01] his son
[46:06] so if brother branham is our prophet
[46:12] then how he doesn't say that now he does
[46:16] it doesn't speak
[46:17] by the prophets but by his son
[46:23] oh thank you lord gracias
[46:26] when
[46:39] you gotta know how it is written in the
[46:42] scriptures
[46:46] he spoke
[46:48] by the prophets
[46:51] prophet and the old times
[46:54] antigua
[47:09] no poor but in peru
[47:13] he spoke by the prophets in the old
[47:15] times
[47:20] he could have spoken in
[47:22] novella
[48:04] it's not a man's book
[48:07] it's our book of god
[48:10] is there a scripture for it
[48:13] let's let's turn to
[48:15] second timothy three vamos and
[48:18] thompson's
[48:27] is
[49:09] so then it is not a book of men's
[49:11] writing
[49:19] amen amen
[49:21] wow thank you lord gracias
[49:24] so in this latest last days
[49:28] because
[50:09] you could make a mistake
[50:52] because the picture is clear now
[51:01] there was christ
[51:04] and the devil knew that that from the
[51:08] garden of eden
[51:13] what did the devil hear
[51:16] diablo
[51:18] that first judgment seat is
[51:42] and the lord god said unto the serpent
[51:44] because thou has done this thou are
[51:46] cursed above all cattle and above every
[51:49] beast of the field upon thy belly shall
[51:52] thou go and thus shall thou eat all the
[51:55] days of thy life
[52:00] [Music]
[52:17] us
[52:19] i always thought that the belly was the
[52:21] stomach
[52:29] like in the belly of an airplane
[52:45] in miracle terms and terminology the
[52:49] medicals you know what the belly is
[52:53] from the breast there's a picture all
[52:56] the way to the womb
[53:20] i hope none in this congregation goes
[53:22] barely wise
[54:06] you might be breathing dust from the
[54:08] sahara
[54:57] what is
[54:59] your cars made of the ques echo sucaro
[55:03] of what is your tablets and your phones
[55:07] made of the question
[55:12] satan
[55:13] is the god of the earth noise
[55:20] and where do the materials to make the
[55:23] planes and the trains and the cars come
[55:26] from
[55:31] they come from the earth
[55:33] [Music]
[55:43] and do you love
[55:45] your car
[55:47] and your phones and your tablets more
[55:49] than the word of god
[55:54] only you can answer that question
[55:58] even the lord told john
[56:27] get away from
[56:41] you never know where the dust that you
[56:43] breathe comes from us
[56:52] constantly washed for that seed
[56:55] constantly
[57:38] he said i'm gonna
[57:53] was appointed to be that seed
[57:59] it was a type of the resurrection
[58:04] so he wandered his side
[58:19] in the last days by his son that he is
[58:21] appointed heir of all things
[58:27] but
[58:28] when it came to be the year
[58:40] my time is passing so i'm gonna meet him
[58:44] so
[58:46] give me a hebrews one for
[58:52] and we'll finish with this there's so
[58:54] much but we'll finish with it
[58:57] being made so much better than the
[58:59] angels as he has by inheritance
[59:02] inheritance of
[59:04] obtain a more excellent name than they
[59:07] echo superior
[59:15] if you keep reading
[59:26] are they not all ministering spirits
[59:28] sent forth to minister for them who
[59:31] shall be heirs of salvation
[59:41] it's talking about the angels establish
[59:44] that
[1:00:10] though ordinarily
[1:00:12] we
[1:00:19] it is evident from the scriptures
[1:00:24] that the angels are in the company of
[1:00:27] the children of god
[1:00:33] much of the time
[1:00:37] if we realize
[1:01:09] ministers beat us
[1:01:10] that they these angels christos angeles
[1:01:16] they are right beside you in church
[1:01:21] don't they

[1:01:29] angels of god in kemp notice
[1:01:34] they never live hey
