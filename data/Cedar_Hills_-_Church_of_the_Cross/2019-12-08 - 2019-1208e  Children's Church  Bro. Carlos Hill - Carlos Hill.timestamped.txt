[14:49] Malachi see Malachi Malachi's but did
[14:56] you know that there's a young man in the
[14:58] Bible that God used it was this guy's
[15:01] age he was just this guy's age thanks
[15:06] Malachi have a seat
[15:08] his name was Josiah and Josiah and
[15:15] Josiah the reason that God used him is
[15:20] because the children of Israel now who
[15:22] knows who the children of Israel was
[15:25] they were God's chosen people but you
[15:28] see the problem see I've been to
[15:31] Jerusalem a whole bunch of times back in
[15:33] the past not being in and out of there
[15:34] all the time I teleport in and out I
[15:36] come and go but this one time I went
[15:42] back and the children of Israel had a
[15:45] real bad habit of disobey
[15:49] they always thought that they had a
[15:52] better idea than God did but you know
[15:55] what
[15:55] this one time I teleported back man I
[15:59] popped out just like I did a minute of
[16:01] going sometimes you just never know
[16:02] where you gonna land the takeoffs are
[16:05] great but it's the landing that's a
[16:06] little bit rough sometimes I popped out
[16:10] that time in the middle of one of them
[16:12] streets and right into a Pigpen what I
[16:16] come to and I was not to snout with a
[16:19] 400-pound pig and a smell lord of mercy
[16:25] you ever smelt a smelly smell that
[16:28] smells smelly
[16:29] well this is one of them smells it's
[16:32] that kind of smell that you smell that
[16:34] you're like Oh Lord
[16:36] that ain't never coming out well two
[16:40] days later I got the smell out okay I'll
[16:42] give you the recipe later on it's some
[16:45] duct tape and all kinds of good stuff
[16:46] anyway I walked out into Jerusalem and I
[16:52] started walking the streets and I tell
[16:55] you what I could not recognize Jerusalem
[16:57] to save my life it was a mess all the
[17:02] temples of the Lord were all torn down
[17:05] there was idols everywhere there were
[17:09] people running up and down the streets
[17:10] acting crazy it was not the Jerusalem
[17:13] that I knew and I said what in the world
[17:17] is going on here
[17:18] about the kid must find somebody but you
[17:25] know what it was under the rule of a
[17:27] king called Amon and he was a bad bad
[17:30] man he liked worship idols and crazy
[17:34] things and they were doing all kinds of
[17:36] weird stuff pretty soon the people of
[17:39] the town said you know what we've had
[17:41] enough and they killed him because they
[17:46] were tired of living that way and they
[17:49] were desperate they were so sad and
[17:51] desperate because because they were
[17:53] gently was the world was just a mess but
[17:57] you know what happened a Manhattan
[18:00] he had a little Sun and the people were
[18:04] so desperate they said you know what we
[18:07] ain't putting in another adult in there
[18:09] cuz adults are gonna mess this thing all
[18:11] up I know what do they got Josiah and he
[18:17] was 8 years old and they said Josiah
[18:22] you're gonna be the king that Josiah was
[18:26] like what me I barely knew how to tie my
[18:32] shoes but you know what Josiah knew
[18:38] Josiah even though that he hadn't been
[18:42] raised a Christian
[18:44] Josiah knew that there was a better way
[18:47] Joe solder knew that somewhere in his
[18:51] heart there was a better way to live
[18:53] than what those people were living like
[18:56] and so Josiah sat down in the Kings
[18:59] chair but I do know there's a better way
[19:04] he said and so he got the high priest
[19:07] and he pulled him in he says well mr.
[19:10] high priest you lost I just learned that
[19:15] a diamond shoes and the priest said well
[19:19] Josiah what do you want to do well I
[19:22] guess I guess we better find a better
[19:25] way and Josiah knew that the best way to
[19:30] go
[19:31] well that was God's Way that's what
[19:34] Josiah knew so Josiah said all of his
[19:38] mighty men and he called him in he said
[19:40] fellas look ok I said he said he said
[19:47] fellas look here's what we got to do we
[19:51] have got to find the book you see
[19:57] because your sign knew that there was
[20:00] power in the words of the book he knew
[20:05] there was power in those words so Josiah
[20:09] this book and I know what you're
[20:12] thinking
[20:15] the book was called the book of the law
[20:19] and that book was a book that had been
[20:24] written by Moses it was given to Moses
[20:27] by God and God said and john-john Josiah
[20:32] said I gotta find this book because I
[20:35] know that if I can find this book that I
[20:39] can undo all the mess that my
[20:42] forefathers made in the town so he said
[20:46] everybody out and we went he went down
[20:49] to the business and he went down to the
[20:50] business of cleaning house and he said
[20:53] that said all this idolatry stops and he
[20:57] got out his hammer and he went out there
[20:59] and he started smashing idols and he
[21:01] smashed the idols so bad that they were
[21:04] powder he mashed him he got him all down
[21:08] broke all the idols and tore down all
[21:10] the temples and in the middle of the
[21:13] city in the middle of the city of
[21:16] Jerusalem is a big giant building called
[21:20] the temple of the Lord it's a huge
[21:24] beautiful building and it's built for
[21:27] the worship of God but you see the idol
[21:30] worshippers they went in there and they
[21:32] destroyed it and they tore it down and
[21:34] they filled it full of trash and they
[21:35] made a mess out of it
[21:37] well Josiah said you know what first
[21:40] thing I got to do first thing I got to
[21:42] do is clean up the house I got to clean
[21:44] up the house of the Lord that's what he
[21:46] said
[21:46] so he got all the janitors and he got
[21:49] his painters and his carpenters and he's
[21:51] in all of these guys and he said guys we
[21:54] got to go down and we got to clean up
[21:56] the house of the Lord that's the first
[21:57] step so he went in and they started
[22:05] painting the walls you ever painted
[22:07] before man it gets everywhere doesn't it
[22:10] and you get on your nose and it's in
[22:12] your hair and I've ruined a good pair of
[22:15] shoes doing that they painted and they
[22:21] fixed everything and as they were moving
[22:24] the junk
[22:25] from inside the temple what do you think
[22:28] they found they found the book of the
[22:34] law and they ran to Josiah said Josiah
[22:38] look what we found
[22:39] look look what we found and Josiah said
[22:42] praise be the Lord and he said now
[22:48] here's what I want you to do mr. high
[22:50] priest I want you to read me this book
[22:53] read it to me I need to study it I need
[22:56] to get inside of it and figure out
[22:58] what's going on in my kingdom I got to
[23:00] find out what's going on I need answers
[23:02] and I know they're in that book so the
[23:05] high priest sits down to business and
[23:07] they start reading and they start
[23:09] reading and it says thou shalt not and
[23:12] remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy
[23:14] and the high priest is reading it -
[23:17] Josiah and Josiah realized that the way
[23:20] that they were livin was so bad then he
[23:25] had jumped up on his feet and he ripped
[23:28] his clothes and he threw himself on the
[23:33] floor before the Lord and he said Lord I
[23:35] am so sorry we did wrong we lived wrong
[23:42] we acted wrong we behaved in a bad way
[23:46] but lord I promise you lord
[23:49] I promise you that I'll fix it that's
[23:52] what he said
[23:53] he said I promise you that I said about
[23:59] the business of fixing it but you see
[24:01] the Lord was angry he was mad because
[24:04] the Israelites they had been living so
[24:07] bad it was bad I mean they were
[24:10] spray-painting walls it was bad
[24:13] they were driving cars on the wrong side
[24:15] of the road and the one way and running
[24:18] the stoplights and the whole bit it was
[24:20] bad yeah it was there was there was an
[24:22] anarchy in there was dogs and cats
[24:26] hanging out together
[24:29] and they had goldfish and betta fish in
[24:31] the same tank yeah yeah I mean did you
[24:34] just don't do things like that God was
[24:39] mad he was real mad he said no I'm on a
[24:42] judge Judah I'm gonna judge that country
[24:45] but you know what your sign because you
[24:48] read that word and because you
[24:51] recognized what you guys did wrong I'm
[24:55] gonna spare Israel for your sake Josiah
[24:58] and I'm gonna give you all another
[25:00] chance to fix it and Josiah did for the
[25:05] next years of his reign he sat about the
[25:08] business of fixing all the things and
[25:10] under Josiah's reign people got to know
[25:14] the name of God all over again because
[25:18] they had forgot the name of God could
[25:22] you imagine could you imagine you forget
[25:26] the name of God could you ever forget
[25:28] that name that's a hard name to forget
[25:32] right it's God how do you forget that
[25:37] but they forgot they couldn't remember
[25:40] what it was like to serve God anymore so
[25:45] Josiah said the first thing we got to do
[25:47] is have ourselves a Sabbath and they had
[25:50] a Sabbath and they kept it and that was
[25:53] the first Sabbath that they had kept in
[25:55] like a hundred million years okay wasn't
[25:59] that long but still it's a long time so
[26:04] Josiah fixed it and God used this boy
[26:09] who started as king he started out at
[26:14] eight years old so when y'all think I
[26:20] don't know nothing about God maybe God
[26:24] don't even know me think about your sire
[26:28] because God knows every one of you he
[26:35] knows every little hair on your head or
[26:37] in my case there's no hair
[26:39] he knows a man
[26:41] he knows everything about you he knows
[26:45] how many times that you take a breath
[26:47] when you sleep at night
[26:49] he knows how many times that you blink
[26:53] your eyes
[26:56] he knows how many times did you think
[26:59] good thoughts and you think bad thoughts
[27:03] and he knows them so when you guys think
[27:08] where do I fit in in God's plan just
[27:11] know that he's waiting for you he's got
[27:13] it all set up for you and one of these
[27:15] days maybe he'll use you like a Josiah
[27:17] and he'll have you fix the nation and
[27:21] he'll have you do some great things
[27:23] maybe you'll be the next preachers the
[27:25] song leaders for ladies you'll you'll be
[27:28] the next Sunday School teachers and then
[27:31] you'll be able to teach the people like
[27:33] you holy cow right mind blown I'll tell
[27:39] you what Josiah fixed the nation of
[27:45] Israel he fixed it started out
[27:48] eight-year-old boy fixed the whole
[27:52] country imagine all right guys how many
[27:59] like that story awesome you guys can go
[28:02] back to your seats thank you for being
[28:06] wonderful listeners
[28:18] great job guys so how many want to be
[28:21] like a Josiah yeah how many of you guys
[28:25] want to be a Josiah how many you want to
[28:27] be just somebody just somebody that God
[28:29] just uses just a little bit and maybe
[28:31] maybe God doesn't use you to do a whole
[28:34] big old nation and stopping world thing
[28:37] maybe he just needs you to be kind to
[28:39] one another maybe he just needs you to
[28:42] say couldn't worry mom good morning dad
[28:45] maybe that's all he needed because
[28:47] sometimes moms and dads have a rough day
[28:50] too right
[28:51] sometimes they have a bad day sometimes
[28:54] maybe just a hug fixes a whole lot of
[28:56] stuff really does right well guys I want
