[34:15] hey man can you give one to the lord
[34:18] [Music]
[34:20] amen you may be seated
[34:22] this time i'm going to ask our sister
[34:24] denise to come forth for testimony and
[34:26] special to the lord
[34:42] i actually have a couple of testimonies
[34:44] that i wrote down
[34:48] i'll read them really quickly i wrote
[34:50] them because i didn't want my nerves to
[34:52] take over and it didn't make sense
[34:57] [Music]
[35:00] so my first testimony is
[35:04] this past sunday i i wasn't feeling very
[35:06] well este
[35:10] and i had been like that for a few days
[35:12] before yeah
[35:15] but sunday was the worst
[35:18] el domingo
[35:20] and i thought something was wrong with
[35:21] me
[35:25] i had um burning in my chest
[35:41] and i'd also get some stomach cramping
[35:43] from time to time
[35:46] i felt very weak
[35:49] and at one point as i was getting ready
[35:51] for service
[35:56] i laid on the couch just praying that
[35:58] god would help me to make it to church
[36:06] and
[36:07] my husband came to me and and he said
[36:21] and he began to blow dry my hair for me
[36:24] hello
[36:38] and i decided to cry because i was
[36:40] determined to make it to church
[36:47] and obviously my family was also
[36:49] determined to get me here
[36:54] so when we came when we got to church
[36:59] i put a request to be prayed for you
[37:03] for me because i felt like i needed
[37:05] extra prayers
[37:12] [Music]
[37:15] he said that the requests would be taken
[37:17] care of during the second service
[37:19] on me i was there
[37:31] after service my siblings and i and our
[37:33] families
[37:34] the suede
[37:45] uh we had fellowship at my parents house
[37:47] at
[38:00] you're going to service right you're
[38:02] going to feel better you watch
[38:08] sorry i got all pumped because there's
[38:11] no other other place i'd rather be than
[38:13] here feeling the way that i was feeling
[38:30] out
[38:33] so during the second service right
[38:35] before brother diego called me up
[38:42] i began feeling some relief in the areas
[38:45] that i had pain
[38:51] i felt a calm and sweet presence with me
[38:54] the entire time
[39:00] that i was being prayed for
[39:04] for me and i knew that i had been
[39:07] thoroughly healed
[39:12] i'm very thankful to lord for healing me
[39:17] and for placing the ministry that came
[39:19] up to pray for me along with all the
[39:21] prayers from everybody
[39:28] and
[39:29] and i thank you all from the bottom of
[39:30] my heart
[39:35] so my second testimony isn't that long
[39:38] testimonial
[39:40] last friday i had a doctor appointment
[39:47] and during that appointment the doctor
[39:49] saw what he called a fibroid
[40:08] and so normally i would have gotten you
[40:10] know scared and
[40:12] cried
[40:16] all worried
[40:19] but i've been through this before around
[40:21] this time last year by
[40:30] and i wasn't going to let fear
[40:32] in knowing that something good is about
[40:34] to happen to me you know
[40:41] so the doctor set me up another
[40:43] appointment for monday this past monday
[40:44] morning
[40:48] to do
[40:50] the same thing that we had already done
[40:52] on friday
[40:57] and so i got my appointment card
[41:19] so i called my husband to share the news
[41:24] and of course he's real consoling so he
[41:27] told me that everything was gonna you
[41:28] know i already knew el es muy
[41:30] consoladori
[41:32] mediocre sorry i didn't make sense
[41:35] he told me that something that i already
[41:38] knew
[41:39] okay
[41:42] that everything was going to be okay
[41:47] and so sunday when i was when i came to
[41:50] the front to be prayed for me
[41:53] for me i also wanted prayer for that for
[41:56] my exam on monday
[42:00] my prayer was just that i would go and
[42:02] the doctor wouldn't see anything this
[42:03] time
[42:12] so i showed up on monday and began the
[42:14] exam
[42:35] we can move forward with your procedure
[42:44] and deep down inside i was like jumping
[42:47] for joy but of course i didn't want to
[42:48] scare him
[42:54] so i just looked at him and i said okay
[42:55] sounds good to me
[43:08] and i just want to sing the song
[43:11] to give thanks to god for everything
[43:13] that he does for me and i've asked
[43:14] brother seth to to help me with it
[43:21] for me god bless you
[43:28] okay

[50:18] i give sister denise a lot of credit for
[50:21] getting up here and she almost preached
[50:23] my message
[50:29] but what's funny is how we can go to a
[50:32] game or watch a nfl game on tv

[50:49] and then they look at us like
[50:51] this guy's crazy

[51:41] if you see me running around here and
[51:43] acting like a chicken with his head cut
[51:44] off
[51:46] just leave me alone
[51:48] because this 2020 year
[51:51] year that we should give the lord
[51:53] everything we have yes

[52:01] day
[52:14] when we had all our services for that

[52:46] the same el mismo he's the same
[52:51] yesterday
[52:53] today
[52:55] right now
[52:56] and forever
[53:04] about 15 minutes ago the pastor calls
[53:05] and says you got to speak tonight
[53:11] not a problem no problem there shouldn't
[53:13] be a problem right no idea
[53:15] we can talk about a lot of other things
[53:21] to someone at the grocery store
[53:24] when it comes time to talk about his
[53:26] words
[53:28] why should be why should we not be ready
[53:32] hey man i don't have a whole lot of time
[53:35] but i'm going to give a i went and give
[53:37] you a little update on my aunt becky
[53:49] and
[53:50] she was a little groggy couldn't eat
[53:52] very much
[53:56] and i i saw her about a month ago
[54:02] she looks at me and i said do you know
[54:04] my name
[54:05] is minombre
[54:07] she stared at me with a deep deep like
[54:10] lost
[54:13] she goes i know you're my nephew

[1:07:18] there's the trail of the serpent
[1:07:21] in this message brother branham's talk
[1:07:26] and he's talking about how that trail of
[1:07:28] the serpent goes through our lives marks
[1:07:31] us
[1:07:36] and when it marks us
[1:07:38] a memorial rises up
[1:07:40] monuments
[1:07:53] and we look back at that time and we say
[1:07:56] from that time
[1:08:00] i was this way because of that
[1:08:04] this happened to me
[1:08:07] and because this happened to me

[1:08:43] and everybody has their story
[1:08:47] and everybody can tie into that and say
[1:08:49] well from this time

[1:10:16] started to ask me
[1:10:20] when did i meet you
[1:10:22] was that a point in time
[1:10:26] and i started to think and think and
[1:10:28] think about it
[1:10:34] [Applause]
[1:11:00] [Applause]
[1:11:07] [Applause]
[1:11:25] and
[1:11:26] i just remember being on this trip

[1:11:32] his meetings
[1:11:36] we were invited i went with with uncle
[1:11:53] you know you i was treated like i really
[1:11:56] felt like the people treated me like
[1:11:57] royalties
[1:12:02] they would be like gosh he's so blessed
[1:12:05] he is
[1:12:21] i went out on the balcony and i
[1:12:24] began to
[1:12:26] promise the lord
[1:12:31] i began to tell him
[1:12:34] from this
[1:12:41] and that was when that that was the time
[1:12:44] that god gave me jesus
[1:12:46] and he's here tonight
[1:13:07] you see we have great examples
[1:13:10] you see abraham in the bible
[1:13:14] he was 99.
[1:13:39] [Applause]
[1:13:45] asking too much of god
[1:13:49] how do we know that that abraham didn't
[1:13:51] suffer with anxiety
[1:13:57] he didn't suffer of depression
[1:14:14] [Applause]
[1:14:24] [Applause]
[1:14:26] moses
[1:14:28] brother brother branham calls him he was
[1:14:30] a runaway prophet
[1:14:33] a runaway prophet
[1:14:38] established but one day but
[1:14:54] it was that
[1:14:55] [Applause]
[1:15:06] [Applause]
[1:15:35] i remember i made a statement one time
[1:15:39] i said i'm not a preacher
[1:15:42] well you know what
[1:15:45] i'm tired of complexes
[1:16:00] [Applause]
[1:16:19] everything
[1:16:21] every little thing
[1:16:24] that has met god
[1:16:26] that has met god
[1:16:30] it's been changed
[1:16:33] the same way
[1:16:36] that there's a mark of the beast
[1:16:43] that goes through and marks your your
[1:16:45] life
[1:17:56] and death came there
[1:18:00] and if you could grab a hold of anything
[1:18:02] tonight
[1:18:05] remember
[1:18:07] everything that meets god
[1:18:10] it
[1:18:38] holy
[1:19:03] so i can't wait till we have these
[1:19:05] week-long meetings again
[1:19:10] [Applause]
[1:19:17] is
[1:19:51] [Music]
[1:20:04] [Applause]
[1:20:14] [Music]
[1:20:16] and
[1:20:38] [Applause]
[1:20:51] [Applause]
[1:20:58] you know because as soon as i heard our
[1:21:00] pastor say
[1:21:03] he said this year he goes
[1:21:05] he said we're on the offense estamos en
[1:21:08] la fencilla that's the first word that
[1:21:10] came to my mind
[1:21:12] when you
[1:21:15] the first thing that many people do
[1:21:19] is going to the defense is isi
[1:21:22] i don't know about you
[1:21:25] but all i could do is tell you what god
[1:21:27] has done in my life
[1:21:31] but as soon as our pastor said we gotta
[1:21:34] be on the offense
[1:21:39] through our daily lives
[1:21:55] look at you scared in this daniel we're
[1:21:56] so afraid of the devil
[1:22:00] but it's time to take god's word
[1:22:05] but do something with his word
[1:22:08] this word wasn't
[1:22:10] [Applause]
[1:22:15] [Music]
[1:22:22] because you look at an ambush
[1:22:25] what is an ambush
[1:22:27] it's when
[1:22:29] they hide behind things
[1:22:35] they hide behind says
[1:22:50] but what is the human nature of that
[1:23:02] retreat
[1:23:04] right
[1:23:05] how many are used to retreating here
[1:23:09] come on
[1:23:10] ask yourself today
[1:23:12] how many are used to retreating
[1:23:16] every time saying throw something at you
[1:23:18] yeah
[1:24:28] what is god's word
[1:24:30] what is god's word
[1:24:33] we hear it every service
[1:24:36] from behind this pokemon
[1:24:38] god knows what he's doing
[1:24:41] sometimes his word cuts us
[1:24:44] but keep on fighting
[1:24:47] because what's happening
[1:24:49] it was given his word was given
[1:24:53] to strengthen us
[1:24:55] to nourish us
[1:25:36] you're fighting forward
[1:25:52] our prophet preached the message
[1:25:55] a conflict between god
[1:25:59] and satan
[1:26:03] but realize what this conflict is
[1:26:34] he's
[1:27:09] [Applause]
[1:27:16] is
[1:27:44] that's why the king when he was choosing
[1:27:46] this man
[1:27:48] he said i want that one
[1:27:51] that's all bloody and beaten
[1:27:54] i want him by myself
[1:27:56] because he's going to fight for mercury
[1:28:40] [Applause]
[1:29:22] that's why in chapter three of joshua
[1:29:25] he says look at he's a meeting
[1:29:30] he said you go this measurement
[1:29:33] on this measurement
[1:29:35] he says because you have not come this
[1:29:38] way before
[1:29:41] this is what i have
[1:29:43] you'll see i've gone that way before
[1:29:46] it's already been paid for us
[1:29:49] i know you feel beat up
[1:29:52] but the world sees you as a hero
[1:29:56] they see you as a pillar
[1:30:00] do you believe that church
[1:30:02] at your feet
[1:30:03] the word's been spoken
[1:30:16] that god has planted himself in your
[1:30:18] heart
[1:30:32] no matter
[1:30:46] you go
[1:30:58] the bible says what you want
[1:31:29] promises to you you know he says that's
[1:31:31] promising
[1:31:32] that proves that he's alive
[1:31:35] and that he is doing well
