worries they'll always be here they'll always be with us they'll always walk with us but we choose life today we choose good today we choose to praise you from our lips lord god and we raise our hands

that will set forth the captives free lord that will make those that are sick healthy again lord jesus we call upon your presence and we love you lord we give you all the glory and the honor for you are worthy lord in the name of the lord jesus christ amen [Applause] uh shalom my precious brother our beloved founder of siddha he is church of the cross i took this opportunity to appreciate you and let you know how much we do value you just because of what you felt for africa it has been out of the vision of brother branham that equipped you to have a feeling for africa i would really want to say that there was no way out that i would ever know you and you'd ever know me if our prophet never had a feeling for africa and i also know that it was not our prophet willing to be coming to africa but the lord jesus himself wanted to come to africa i have read his quote where many times brother branham wanted to come to east africa even to uganda but the religious order of his day and the law of his day would not permit him to come and yet the spirit was willing in this regard every every man would get to have a feeling that there were souls that were entangled in the land of africa that would one day need to hear the omega voice of our lord jesus this would make evil men and willing men risks their lives to travel to the jungles of africa i am particularly giving my voice to you because of how much we have been touched by the love of your sons and they assure shape many sides that they have always struggled with brother caleb and brother tommy jr i have always tried so much to think of them how they would risk their lives to travel and come to uganda and most of all dare their lives [Music] to reach this part of our country that has been named a place of rebellion in history many people have been murdered maine different kind of atrocities until our land which is actually land is in the world map as an area that has been constantly in war and the people that are on good looks so fierce and hard to stay with and indeed even from within uganda many missionaries have always been stopped from reaching our locality but this did not make any sense no matter how perhaps they may have also been told the area is hard it didn't make any sense to your two sons brother caleb and tommy and the team that travel with to them live or die they had to reach even in dark they had to travel they wouldn't know where they were going but they were determined i truly see the spirit of caleb in caleb that great army in the days of joshua that little spirit that stuck and quieted all the negative testimonies that were rising against the promise truly brother caleb while i talk to dad i don't leave you in this regard i truly know that like we have always said this time ground you didn't just come because there is a feeling for africa but you came because god had already appointed you for this time brother thomas junior our dad i want to say this i don't know how long you're going to spend yet living with us but even if you go be assured that we love you we cherish you we feel like i told brother caleb i would be very glad to shake a hand with such a man of this kind i believe brother tommy brother caleb is a reflection of your own ministry the nature of their balance that they have always had men who don't drug walls around them they are not always for the doctrines that they uphold they don't help you because you are right with their own doctrine they want to build the unity the faith that we have regardless of factions and kinds of pool here and there i believe that was what our lord jesus christ was when he came in the land of israel he was not to pull punches with samaritans and the jews he was to unite them though he failed according to the prophecy they desired no unity at all but his attitude was to to make them be united same thing when brother branham came he could not have disregards to those anti-denominations in rural peruse through their ranks and would appear to lead point people to christ then he made the statement that that was his very purpose was to make men have good standing and relationship with christ i'm sure everyone who is well built in the like faith we think so i witnessed this in the ministry your brother told me and brother caleb something that keeps me warm keeps me [Music] always looking unto the end of god's program i failed to give my appreciation to you before you leave us any day that you believe us my words will remain as an appreciation from a jolly land in which [Music] the hills church of the cross have invested a lot of funds in different times in circumstances that they have never even thought they would be involved in they came in with the purpose of doing the translation but they have ended up doing quite more than those and they do willingly they have become part of us particularly me as brother barcelo i have become a very family my brother caleb and brother tommy in many ways they have done so when the crisis came the pandemic came in they had to send in a lot of help to help here and there surely like i told brother caleb this happened at the time when god had already given the way out and the way out here is you came in not that you really have a lot of fans you came in i told brother caleb because there was a crisis ahead of time it would be very difficult you know our poor status we are poor material yes but god has given us the spiritual and as long as we're in the body we do have a feeling when we are hungry when we are thirsty when we are naked when we are afflicted by diseases we still have the feeling attached our physical bodies and someone standing to help us and clothe us and help us here and there would it be possible especially at this time that the world is shut things are not moving would it be possible for us to survive quite well though we don't have all that we want to have but they have done what is recommendable that a child god can do to a fellow brother and sister i want to say as i conclude your vision for africa a continent that was described by those who try to understand about it as a dark continent that continent according to them is that they didn't know much about it until explorers came and when they knew they found their people there and the people have black colors but they have the very soul the spirit and the blood that brother braham said we can transfuse our own blood and we still look alike many tried to put them to look like animals but brother branham refused it oh this is the place your heart has always been and finally your son had to come to accomplish with great love happiness joy and real yearning to see you i now send my voice to you and i say actually land greets you we cherish every effort that you have always put through your sons and the members in your congregation to our land may you live long may you see the glory of the lord and to my brother caleb just being a great opportunity to meet you that i can help the potential doctor your dad may you be well may the hands of the lord never depart from you may he enlighten your heart may deal with you more than he has ever dealt with god bless you all this is brother basil of pio from gulu northern uganda amen [Applause] [Music] amen we just stand to our feet i don't know about you but i believe we got to give another one to the lord wow that's the god that we serve amen oh i believe that he has all the glory and all the power and we're here to serve him this morning how many will worship him with me in

we have placed mr and that's the reason why we're here of this world that can make us happy that if we obtain this person that we will be a happier people that if i get married i'll be a happier person that if i find my other better half way i said at home that i will be the happiest person the happiest young person that if i obtained this certain career person i will be the happiest person but i came to tell you at least nothing in this world that can make you as god can do it [Applause] i'm just going to speak to you about my life i can't give you anything more me vida only my life i was in church around 12 years it is and since the time i started coming to church i started serving [Music] and it comes to a point in la vida in life cristiano the same thing happens oh i can make it on my own a month goes by a year goes by two years go by and one starts figuring it out that i cannot do it on my own that you need of god the word of god and the only thing that will come out of that system those are those animals haven't you ever seen a cistern the rope that's the way we would take out water [Music] and at times we would then bring out animals because the water is no longer flowing the word of god has to flow the word god has to operate the only way that it can flow when you start moving and that's what we have to know [Music] [Music] that's what the devil wants us to think that we we enjoy life at maximo to the maximum amen that we will do what we want to do we want to satisfy this body all these things you can do in the lord allah brothers glory of yours glory to god listen um um in the message the forgotten beatitude element see how this eagle would smash your head to make it all possible to be able to come out of that cage the only thing is that she would beat herself up we try and try and do what we want to do but we beat ourselves up am i the only one broke in here oh yes then i'm in the correct place white brother why do we come to the brokenness because we have to get to the place to understand asaver so we could start you know what i need and you give it to me espores that's why he permits it to depend on him that we will learn to depend on god amen amen brothers it or okay they say this is he says like this is and i thought that was the most horrible pitiful sight listen brothers i want you to notice something here there are many deceptions in life and we will be deceived but notice one thing that it will always be through a person he says like this si yes men and women who were born to be sons and daughters of he's god bless you [Music] and share the word of god with you as well the bride looks very beautiful this morning can we get a clap offering to our lord i'm gonna be narrating there in the in second kings chapter seven and there was a time when in the northern part of israel [Music] in sumeria and las vegas they were surrounded by syria uh stuck in problems but when we're stuck for a long time and spent 40 years in the wilderness so he could let go of all his knowledge but our god brothers we're serving this morning we have fellowship one with another demos and fellowship means two fellows on the ships these are prophets so we're together brother we cannot afford to be left behind but what happens is we get stuck in what he did we don't see what he wants to do now local amen so if you can turn with me to second king seven and this is where i want to focus in verse three when you have you could say and there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gates and they said one to another why say we here but until we die why would why should we stay in our place where we're stuck the backstory of this of the reading and they were trying to reserve everything they had when these four leopard men were there the enemy had already left syria had already left syria but they were still stuck the samaritans were happy there but they were safe they wanted to be safe but they weren't willing to come out of the city because they were seeing the enemies out there why would we go and many times that's how we i is let me do everything and then i want to die let me get everything out first then i'll advance la puerta god so [Applause] that i am not from this place you we will always be we want to do it right but many times we don't feel ready we want to surrender we want our new birth but we feel like we need more time to make a decision and they ask you say i'm still in church well you can be spiritually dying not only are we tired king seven yes we will enter into the city then the famine in this in the city we shall die there and if we sit here either you die taking a step we this across the world in the twilights to go into the camp of the syrians and where they were there come to the outermost part of the camp of syria behold there let go of what you have it doesn't make you happy either way i'd like to close with john 12 27. we'll be receiving our brother titus and what shall i say father father save me from this hour but for this cause esto came i hey unto this hour for this cause i came to this yeah god bless you amen can we give them a cop offering today it's a good day to have drugs just keep praying for us we keep praying so good too see everybody from around here um just good to see everybody we feel the love from every one of you [Music] it says like this is 40 years old was i when moses the servant of the lord sent me from caddish barnea to spy out the land and reconoce brought him word again as it was in my heart nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt [Music] surely the land where on thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance and my shoulders forever because thou hast holy followed the the lord has kept me alive kept the lord spoke his word unto moses four score and five years old yet i am as strong this day yes i was in the day that moses sent me we ask it in to give the land out to each tribe give every tribe their portion now that's chapter 13 now i can imagine he started to wonder what was going to happen to this hebron mountain comments you know god has spoken to him 40 years before that through moses when he got had gone out to spy out the lamb he saw that was what god wanted foreign not only that but moses had spoken with him he had promised it to caleb he had served this mountain will belong to you and your children it was god's promise so he had waited i can imagine him waiting with with anxiousness in his heart that was the thing that was the vision that he was waiting on so when they started crossing over jordan it's one thing to conquer someone like taking i'm sure he was happy when they conquered jericho over more and more so i can imagine him being a little nervous when he heard that joshua was pretty much done doing what god had asked him to do unconquered now aura as i look at caleb miranda he's not done yet el no es a terminado [Applause] he didn't care what the other young men were doing [Music] [Applause] so this is what caught my attention [Applause] now i want you to to go with me to verse 10. yes caleb is speaking here he recalls the promises of god and then he says he does this and now behold out of the end and you know what the word behold means it means pay close attention listen behold out of yen the lord hath kept me alive now this is this is what i see in caleb there's promises that god has made oh can [Applause] she was caught in adultery and they brought penis [Music] [Applause] they brought her to jesus jesus says he said that we should stone this woman to death [Music] but mercy rewrote she should have been the lord talks about how the levite went through the priests went through el senor none of them could help him but then came a good samaritan are you glad i am that person is the devil it was a good samaritan i don't plan alive now this is the time this is the time the devil tried to kill me the devil tried to bring me down many years is [Applause] i want to tell you something [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the day that the pillar of power was photographed in houston in houston and he says and now that pillar of fire that's in the picture the night that it is taken was in at houston at the sam houston coliseum houston we've been having about eight thousand at music hall at the music hall up and went over there that night with about 32 000. but they had asked me for a baptism to hold a debate with him on divine healing so there was this baptist minister that wanted to debate with the prophet i don't believe in fussing with with people you know the gospel wasn't made to fuss about oh when i was first ordained in the baptist church i thought i was the defender of the faith and sword so i found out no man and jesus come to me except my father draws him and says so see you argue with people they're set in their ways or they wouldn't be arguing personas so he wanted me to take one night to debating the houston chronicle i believe was the name of the paper they wrote it up and he put a paid ad in there what we was made out of them we was afraid to force that we were afraid to force the gospel by the word change the gospel by the word of god to that we were afraid to face the gospel by the word of god and i said i do not argue argument i just got so many nights to be here and i've got two more nights left and there's tens of thousands of people here to be prayed for why would i waste a night just on some critic let him go go ahead they can run past jesus said let them alone jesus the blind needs the blind if it wasn't for a caleb this debate would not have happened and the pillar of fire pilar de fuego would not have been photographed on that day no virus [Applause] let me take this mountain [Applause] let me do let me he could have asked for something else [Music] [Applause] he was [Music] el esta el zapata he says brother branham it is salman branham if you don't want to do it let me do it someone said let me do it let me do it of course you know how the papers can play it for was photographed that god took with his prophet started with a caleb started [Music] i want to go back to where piglet was that day when he was asking for his mountain and he says he said god has kept me alive for this if i couldn't have taken it all those other years
