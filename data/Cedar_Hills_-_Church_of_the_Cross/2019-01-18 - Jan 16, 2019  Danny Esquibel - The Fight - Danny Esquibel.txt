God bless you my brother so how many are happy tonight understand content those in everywhere I mean so if we're gonna open up our Bibles Martinez says be yes to Haggai and you know they a hill chapter 1 verse 3 capital uno ver so trace then the word of the Lord by Haggai then came the word of the Lord by haggai the prophet saying entonces vino palabra show up for middle Profeta a hail diciendo is it time for you O ye to dwell in your health filled houses and this house like waste a Sparrow's tiempo para nosotros the avatar in which discusses artists honest yes the caster's yes now therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts which is here Leto here what they lost ejército consider your ways may that be in a manners will be seated she bones to Mecca siento and we read on verse 6 believe myself say ye have so much and bring in little samurai's mucho the Kohei spoken ye eat but you have not enough to eat you have not enough commands in all societies you drink Vidia are not filled with drink a base is no inoculate satisficers he clove you was with this but there is none warm in no scale entice and he that earliest wages earnest way just to put into a bag with holes yet raha horn and receivers or not in Socorro PO thus saith the Lord of Hosts I see at each other like a hairy toes consider your ways may that's all there is just caminos so we find out here the most quaint a key that Haggai yeah a hail we just heard that the word of the Lord came to the prophet a man a couple of and you'll be nonprofit oh we want to remember that get a more record that is because the word the Lord comes to the prophet but Killip allowed us you're bein a prophet that he doesn't come to the preacher no you know take a look you don't come to the teacher who you know nice he comes to the Prophet being a prophet the Bible says that we let me say that the Lord Himself kills in your amusement will do nothing more than that except he reveal it to his servants the prophets primero so sheer blows profit so we find out here knows almost quaint a key the condition of the people here la condición de la gente key and in my Bible you evilly it's got some commentaries in a gross commentary second and it says hey guys purpose is clear they say a kegel el propósito a huge stava Claro the exiles who returned to Jerusalem after their captivity go succeed on TV that in Babylonia in Babylonia have failed to complete the temple IBM Fidel and completed a temple Haggai calls these citizens to repentance into action I killed your boys you almost have a Pentimento yes so they found themselves that they were come out of slavery saying paternal Carians a little less clever dude and they began to start off with a great fire Iike Monsanto corn gram flagel they were gonna rebuild the temple even under the conspirators and they started out with a great fire eco means a new : girls wiggle and then little with a little fizzle yeah it gonna picking your feast oh that happens to us a lot of times right by some motel business let me start out the new year go my son was annoying wine yeah we're on sighs yes tumbles in putting while I'm gonna do this more I wasn't a boy yeah I never start to do this better welcome in Sarah's head his tummy hole we start out with a real big fire coming someone's come grams Fraggle and all of a sudden it turns into a fizzle he their punter they would be on pequeña feast on and in the commentary it says in the commentary releasing the profit highlights a Profeta lamarka the indifference of the people in differential hinting citing the return deck exiles in Australia's recreational sex yellow and their fellow countrymen is compañeros de la Fiera for putting their own interests ahead of the Lord and the temple or corners who protein that is and discussing your temple the Bible says the viennese know ye not no no survey that ye are the Temple of the Lord give also 2000 temple tenure so what temple are we building for Hills is get them placed on mostly if you can't operate many times we put our own interests Mucha bases prominence appropriate interests before the Lord's interest antecedent in Europe that's why the Prophet says what is the profit aleikum consider your ways consider two Caminos many times muchas veces we give more time there must impose to the world al mundo then we do to God que no que de la musique ample you consider your ways o Sierra whose Caminos one brother Caleb called me when I Monica let me a medium or a week and a half ago Monday as soon as the money million so that you got it the following
