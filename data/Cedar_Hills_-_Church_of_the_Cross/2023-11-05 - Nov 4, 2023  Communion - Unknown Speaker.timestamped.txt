[5:58] here
[6:13] good evening to each and every one of
[6:15] you may the Lord Jesus Christ bless
[6:21] you I want to tell you that I am with
[6:23] fear and
[6:26] trembling I am happy emotional
[6:32] Joy because when we speak
[6:35] about we speak about the Lord's
[6:38] Supper the words of the Lord come to
[6:42] me when he said in one of the
[6:47] gospels how much time have I desired for
[6:51] this how long have I desired for this
[6:54] time how
[6:58] long how long have I desired for this
[7:00] time for which time which
[7:04] moment for the moment to have
[7:08] communion if we open up our our
[7:14] Bibles in St John Chapter
[7:19] 13 starting with verse
[7:25] 3435 we're going to find some scriptures
[7:28] that I know we know by memory
[7:32] and we have read them many
[7:34] times but we the question is have we
[7:37] understood
[7:41] it what makes this
[7:45] event so
[7:48] great
[7:51] communion it's the the sacredness the
[7:56] solemnity it's what brother Brenham
[7:58] taught us
[8:00] uh according to
[8:04] communion when in the church it's
[8:06] announced that we are going to have
[8:10] communion it's a time as
[8:14] Believers we have to prepare
[8:17] ourselves the scriptures tell
[8:20] us I'm going to ask you if you can
[8:24] stand we're going to speak for a few
[8:27] moments
[8:28] minutes
[8:34] [Music]
[8:37] I want you to notice in what situation
[8:41] Jesus said these
[8:43] words Jesus was not in a
[8:48] Revival he was not in a church or a
[8:53] synagogue Jesus was in the upper
[8:57] room where only his disciples were with
[9:01] him where his friends were with
[9:07] him and this is where when Jesus said
[9:10] these
[9:13] words after they had
[9:19] communion a new commandment I give unto
[9:24] you Jesus never said I I'm I'm going to
[9:27] ask you for a favor
[9:32] uh here I am that if you want
[9:37] to Jesus says a new commandment I give
[9:43] you I give unto you that you love one
[9:47] another as I have loved
[9:51] you that ye also love one
[9:58] another that the Lord Jesus add the
[10:00] blessing to the reading of the lord of
[10:02] the word you may be be seated I know you
[10:04] didn't cap capture I'm going to read it
[10:09] again what Jesus gave
[10:12] us to
[10:19] Diego to Tom perz Jesus gave a new
[10:24] commandment because I was
[10:27] there were you there
[10:33] a new commandment I give unto
[10:36] you that you
[10:38] love one
[10:41] another not just any
[10:46] way don't love each other the way you
[10:48] want
[10:51] to inspiration and
[10:54] Revelation as
[10:56] I Jesus
[10:59] the
[11:00] master as
[11:02] I have loved
[11:05] you as
[11:07] I with my
[11:09] love as I have loved
[11:12] you love each
[11:14] other one
[11:18] another that's why
[11:22] this could not be pronounced in another
[11:26] condition I want you to see your brother
[11:30] I see my precious brother
[11:32] here and I feel
[11:35] honored that it is my
[11:38] duty to to love this
[11:42] brother to love my
[11:45] sister not until she offends
[11:49] me but with
[11:52] love that
[11:55] surpasses all
[11:57] understanding
[12:02] I want you to notice in the way that the
[12:04] Lord has invited
[12:06] us how we should love each
[12:11] other one thing that Satan cannot
[12:19] do he is the best
[12:23] preacher someone wants to be the best
[12:26] preacher uh they already beat you
[12:31] the best preacher is
[12:33] Satan that we all know
[12:35] that in his first
[12:39] sermon he deceived a third part of
[12:43] Heaven someone can do
[12:47] that Satan can imitate every
[12:51] gift he can come here
[12:54] see like no one
[12:57] else he can can manifest all the
[13:01] gifts he can come here and sit
[13:04] here it's that I'm I'm I've been here 20
[13:07] years they already beat
[13:10] you s Satan has 6,000 years but there's
[13:16] something that Satan cannot
[13:23] imitate love one
[13:25] another as
[13:27] I I have loved
[13:31] you the disciples didn't
[13:34] understand but after three
[13:38] days when they saw that
[13:41] body everything that he
[13:44] suffered when he they heard the the
[13:46] shouts the The Cry of
[13:49] pain they did not
[13:53] understand when they saw that PR blood
[13:56] that was shed all over the walls
[14:02] love as
[14:03] I have loved
[14:06] you and there is no greater
[14:11] love that puts his life down for his
[14:20] friends first Corinthians
[14:24] 11 and 29 and 30
[14:33] the Apostle Paul captures the
[14:40] Revelation solemn uh
[14:44] event and notice how he presents
[14:50] it and in verse 29 he
[14:54] says for he that
[14:57] eateth
[15:06] unworthily without Discerning not
[15:09] Discerning the Lord's
[15:12] body eateth and drinketh Damnation to
[15:19] himself I know that some of you did not
[15:21] capture
[15:23] it for he that
[15:26] eateth and drinketh
[15:30] unworthily for
[15:32] them that are going to
[15:35] eat or are going to drink
[15:39] unworthily who are they Paul
[15:46] says not Discerning the Lord's body the
[15:50] Lord's
[15:53] body without Discerning the body of the
[15:57] Lord
[15:59] what body is he speaking about brother
[16:02] Diego the body that was hanged on a
[16:08] cross of the
[16:12] Lord he himself
[16:18] placed God bless you brother
[16:21] greeting others
[16:23] prophets others
[16:26] pastors and teachers
[16:34] doern the body of the
[16:41] [Music]
[16:42] Lord they drink
[16:47] unworthily I want you to see your
[16:49] brother that's to the side your sister
[16:51] that's to the
[16:53] side you know who you're
[16:57] seeing
[16:59] I'm not seeing my precious
[17:02] sister everything that was in
[17:05] God he placed it in
[17:08] Christ and everything that was in
[17:11] Christ he emptied it
[17:14] out in his
[17:16] church
[17:19] then here's my sister
[17:22] Jen but I'm seeing
[17:27] Christ he that
[17:30] without
[17:34] Discerning that if someone would speak
[17:39] badly if someone
[17:42] judges if someone points
[17:45] the if someone steals from her if
[17:49] someone defrauds
[17:50] her
[17:53] judgment he eats and
[17:57] drinks
[18:00] the body of the Lord
[18:06] Jesus why you should
[18:09] never
[18:11] think a bad
[18:14] thought of your
[18:17] sister I
[18:20] ask would you be would you be uh are you
[18:25] able to
[18:27] think
[18:29] of bad about Christ in his
[18:34] presence why do you think bad against
[18:37] your brother or
[18:39] sister why do you offend them and
[18:44] that
[18:48] verse for this cause
[18:52] many are
[18:55] sick
[18:57] weak and many
[19:01] sleep in another version they are
[19:04] dead
[19:07] see why the body of the Lord is the
[19:12] sickest don't don't blame your
[19:15] brother or the pastor or the Deacon or
[19:18] the
[19:20] minister you have discerned the body of
[19:22] the
[19:24] Lord then why are you
[19:27] sick and if you're
[19:30] sick and you have discerned the body of
[19:32] the
[19:34] Lord know that God has placed gifts in
[19:38] the
[19:39] church but when you speak against those
[19:43] gifts I'm speaking about all the
[19:47] gifts
[19:49] Ministries spiritual
[19:51] gifts and let me tell you brother
[19:57] Bram brother Bram says that each and
[19:59] every one of us has a
[20:02] gift and when you speak against that
[20:06] gift you dishonor
[20:11] him and the and the Bible says that God
[20:14] dishonors the person that dishonors
[20:19] him now before we enter into this solemn
[20:26] act if you have not discerned the body
[20:29] of the Lord
[20:36] yet if you have spoken something bad
[20:39] about someone here your brother or your
[20:42] sister or you have maybe SC been
[20:46] scandalized or is
[20:50] offended because someone maybe said
[20:53] something or you heard
[20:55] something or someone did something to
[21:00] you and you took a root of
[21:07] bitterness and you think that you can
[21:10] take the Lord's
[21:13] Supper
[21:19] you should fix
[21:21] it because if
[21:23] not brother Bram
[21:27] says of ananas and Safa will
[21:36] return that wine that we're going to
[21:38] drink has been prepared and consecrated
[21:41] to
[21:44] God it's bread that has been prepared
[21:46] and consecrated to
[21:49] God and you that have been
[21:54] warned that your duty as a Christian
[21:58] is to
[21:59] love
[22:02] love your brother your
[22:06] sister if you see them or them sick it
[22:09] should hurt you because you have to love
[22:13] them not as you want
[22:16] to but he has shown us how to
[22:21] love and how did he show us how to love
[22:24] brother
[22:25] Diego he was hung on a cross
[22:29] because he loved
[22:30] me as he loved
[22:33] me I have to tolerate and
[22:38] support until my brother reaches
[22:42] maturity I want to at this
[22:45] hour before we read the last
[22:49] part I have prayed to
[22:52] God and I have said Lord forgive our
[22:56] sins
[22:58] forgive our
[23:00] unbelief us to manifest you to the
[23:06] world and when I see each and every one
[23:09] in
[23:11] prayer Lord is there something that I
[23:15] have in in here and
[23:18] then because I'm going to have
[23:22] communion and Paul he warns
[23:26] us
[23:28] because as judgment you can eat
[23:32] or it's better that you discern first of
[23:37] all if you don't find yourself
[23:40] worthy it's
[23:43] better I don't say
[23:46] anything but if you don't take
[23:49] it you are then
[23:53] guilty but if you drink it
[23:56] unworthily
[23:58] also you're
[24:00] guilty because we are Christians
[24:04] brother there is enough power on the
[24:08] cross so that the sin
[24:12] question would be finished in each and
[24:14] every one of
[24:17] us and if there's something that we
[24:19] should do from this
[24:23] forward instead of wasting our time in
[24:27] dirty filthy things of the
[24:29] world is start to ask
[24:34] God will teach us how to love each
[24:39] other I said
[24:42] Lord I love
[24:45] everyone but I want today
[24:51] brother before we read the scripture to
[24:54] enter into
[24:56] communion
[24:58] because the Bible says confess your
[24:59] faults one to
[25:01] another Lord I I have
[25:05] nothing maybe but maybe I've done
[25:08] something that someone has been
[25:13] offended I always we always see our
[25:16] side but what if you have also
[25:20] offended if there's someone here that I
[25:22] have
[25:24] offended if there's someone that I owe
[25:26] money to
[25:30] there someone that I've done something
[25:31] against or I owe something
[25:34] to or if you saw me in a in a different
[25:37] place or with an incorrect
[25:41] person with all my with all my heart I
[25:45] want brother Diego I saw
[25:49] you I I I would I I would be happy if
[25:53] you would do that maybe I I don't I
[25:55] don't remember
[25:56] is is there someone here that offended
[25:59] with
[26:00] me stand to your feet tell
[26:04] me we'll pray
[26:07] together and we'll take communion
[26:11] together I want you to
[26:14] meditate for the next few
[26:21] minutes you have to
[26:24] fix you have to
[26:26] confess and you have to fix
[26:30] it this is not a another
[26:34] communion not even a beautiful Ser
[26:38] Ser Christ speaking to his
[26:55] people if I owe something to
[26:58] somebody I would be happy if you would
[27:00] stand to your feet I will not be
[27:04] ashamed if you have to fix something do
[27:07] it
[27:26] now
[27:32] the scripture
[27:38] says
[27:41] firstan 11 verse
[27:46] 23 for I have received of the
[27:50] Lord that which also I delivered
[27:55] un that the Lord Jesus the Same night in
[27:58] which he was
[27:59] betrayed with
[28:02] bread and when he had given thanks he
[28:05] break
[28:06] it and said take eat this is my
[28:10] body which is broken for
[28:13] you this do in remembrance of
[28:18] me after the same manner to also he took
[28:21] the
[28:22] cup when he had s
[28:25] saying this cup
[28:29] is the New Testament in my
[28:32] blood this do ye as often as you drink
[28:35] it in remembrance of
[28:41] me for as often as you eat this bread
[28:44] and drink this
[28:48] cup you do show the Lord's
[28:51] death we're going to
[28:54] pray Lord good evening

[29:11] solemn
[29:14] event which is to have communion with
[29:17] you take this Lord's
[29:20] Supper what makes it
[29:24] holy is because you are there
[29:28] that's why
[29:29] Lord I ask
[29:31] Lord that you will search
[29:34] us and that you will prick our
[29:38] hearts so that we could obey your
[29:43] word and if there's something we want to
[29:45] do from this day
[29:49] forward it's to learn and and and learn
[29:53] how to love one
[29:55] another as you have loved
[30:03] us now we can see this act
[30:06] Lord we prepare our
[30:09] hearts judge us
[30:12] lord judge us
[30:15] Lord I I make this humble
[30:19] prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus
[30:23] Christ that in this
[30:26] communion when your people
[30:30] participated your Prophet taught us that
[30:32] there's healing in
[30:34] it there's healing
[30:36] in when we discern the
[30:39] body bring healing to your
[30:42] body not only to the physical body but
[30:45] also the mystical
[30:47] body We Worship You
[30:49] Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus
[30:56] Christ
