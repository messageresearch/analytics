but he's got to stay right how many are happy to be in the house of the Lord a little bit nervous today uh tonight's going to be a little personal and it's been a little while since I've been up here but I don't know if brother Marcus is here robt uh they really inspired me on Saturday talking about Second Chances third chances you I want to want to thank our pastor for the confidence that he always has in us even when we don't have confidence in ourselves he's got that long that eye that can look so much further down than we can I just feel bad for him because he's always got a deal with us again thank God for second third fourth fifth 10th chance where would we be without him and I say that like I said it's going to be a little little personal tonight on some things that that that I've been going through personally it has been a struggle you say oh as a minister brother Jerry you struggle absolutely because Satan can sneak in matter who we are how long we've been in the message how tremendous we preach Who We Are Who I think I am Satan will sneak in if we're not careful again like I said I want to thank the pastor for for the confidence but let's read the scripture so you can be seated Mark 49 and it reads and we'll start off with and it reads and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lust of other things entering in choke the word and it becometh unfruitful Matthew 13 and then we'll be we'll be turning to Psalms 150 right after that Matthew 13:7 and it reads s some fell among thorns and the Thorns sprung up and choked them I'm I'm making emphasis on the word choke there keep that in mind okay but Psalms 156 says let everything that ha breath praise the Lord may be seated again so it's it's like I said it's good to be behind the this sacred desk as touching as serious as it is the nervous part is not speaking to the people to be in front of the people at work I get to do that I get to brief the government lieutenants Colonels I get to brief them a little part of on security that's a piece of cake to Stand Here amongst God's to voice the word of God gives me a little bit of butterflies but only because of the seriousness of it I have to understand I'm responsible for every single word that comes out of my mouth that's why I have to preach where I live I have to preach and the experiences that I've gone through and I only hope that my stumbles are stepping stones for each and every one of you that's the purpose behind the pulpit of the ministry of our pastor all we have to do is look at him we want an example we look at him you see how he's so giving to the people willing to give of his time of himself all for for our benefit thank you Pastor like I said got to give flowers when flowers are do and i' their [Applause] alive we understand in today's society I always start off like that but I always start off that way we look at people and they're so troubled today heard that over over and over but but watch this the thing I appreciate so much about this ministry so much about our pastor is he's willing to roll up his sleeves and he's willing to go through the mud and take you out our folling pastor would say people think that the bride is going to have a white spotless dress and of course in a sense yes but he would always say now my dress it's filthy but not because of of me but because I've had to go down to the mud to take the people out and that's all I see from this ministry people that are willing give of themselves even maybe it doesn't look right for to some people but reputation that doesn't it in a sense doesn't matter to them the main purpose is to get the people saved brother Jimmy is is well I heard him so I mean that's another one brother Emilio brother Tommy I mean this the ministry that we have they're wonderful and now I understand why we always say we are a blessed people so many of us need help in one way or another we do good in certain areas and and and not so good on other areas we're weak in certain areas or I'm weak in certain areas and so something I went through it started off as a good deed like I said it's going to be a little personal tonight so I spoke to the pastor probably a few times and I told him my desire is I want to be in the mission field with with with the group so bad and I look back because hindsight's 2020 and and young people take note of this okay I wish I would have set myself up so I'm not so dependent to have to be on up there be site I'm limited at where I can go I'm I'm I have to be there because there there's for certain reasons so I look back and I say I wish I would have made the moves you see like like people like like brother B that goes on all the missionary trips smart brother Mar Chavez SM man that had Vision I like man I'm so blind I was so blind growing up I was like I wish I would have done that so I asked the pastor Pastor help me pray and absolutely how me pray that something can open up so that I can do something to break me away so that I can go on these trips with him sounds pretty good huh but time went on I talked to him two times three times and he prays like said but we have to realize the decisions that we make it's not going to things aren't going to just change overnight I'm thinking well maybe I can just turn God on like a light switch Lord I need this I expected it tomorrow the mistake I made was I started to think I said well it's not happening well maybe you know start off real real really easy like whatever whatever you know God will open up a way but it started to grow and I started to think more and I'm like well maybe maybe I don't belong out there maybe it doesn't matter he's got his team anyway you see how he came in he's he's got he's got his team he doesn't need me so then I started to grow even more maybe I don't have anything to offer HOH that's trouble right there the second that I started to think Satan started to come in so I started to feel helpless I started to retract myself so I have to apologize behind the pulpit to everybody the little bit that I have to offer you I have withheld it from you that's why I've been absent for the past maybe a year [Music] so so I I want to apologize to you all apologize to my pastor that's the head the husband to the church me being the female part me withholding that's not a good thing not a good thing at all I started to feel helpless I felt like well what do I do now the pastor doesn't care about me nobody cares about me I'll just isolate myself anyways it will just be me and my family the thing that I didn't realize I started to see my wife get Restless I started to see it ffect her and she would tell me what's going on with you nothing just don't worry about it good I still believe the message I believe the message now more than ever before I still study the word as a matter of fact I received this message during that time but it was fruitless it would not bring fruit because it was being choked out things started to creep into my life and it started to make me unfruitful so brother Jimmy I have to apologize to you he would he would get with me do you want to interpret no no not today not today you want to interpret no no brother Jimmy no I can't I want to apologize to you brother Jimmy as Welly to all the interpreters for withholding if like I said if I have anything to give never want to do that I'm sorry from the bottom of my heart I'm sorry started to creep in now you start to feel hopeless you start to feel helpless now even though you know the way out you don't know how you get out watch this there's a scientific term that's called learned helplessness learned helplessness is a state experienced in humans in response to enduring enduring negative stimuli learn helpless zaps the desire to escape even when an exit route is presented people who feel helpless May believe nothing that they can do will improve their situation so they stop trying I found myself in the situation I said I believe the word I was hiding behind religion this word is not religion the way I was using it I believe brother BR I believe the prophet but I was it was unfruitful so I'll wait I'm going to wait for the Lord I'm going to wait on him I waited 16 years for my sons and I can wait now the exit route was presented to me why wouldn't I take it learned helplessness so I have a question are the message churches are they falling victim to learn helplessness I had to answer the question for myself you answer the question for yourself so all these starts started floting through not being needed no one cares that's not the truth I started to get bitter I started to stay away from our pastor that was the biggest mistake I made right there where I started to not avoid him in a sense because I didn't have anything wrong with him I felt something inside of me so I would hide from him and then also I knew the second that I'm in front of him but little bit of comic belief sorry I don't want to be serious like I said but I did start to get bitter and the cares of this world young people you know this you've been out long enough we start to choke the holy ghost out of you we'll start to choke the holy ghost out of you we will be in church singing and preaching jumping and shouting but there's no fruit behind it so I I I studied this a little bit and I came across the word helpless and and I started to study a little bit there's something that brother Diego had mentioned he mentioned the word Python and this is where I want to start my message py you ever known how a python works you want to know how he hunts is a the python doesn't go to the prey the python hangs around in the trees and he's waiting for the prey to come to it when the prey gets close enough he shoots out and he's got fangs he doesn't have no Venom but he shoots out and he and he grabs you with his teeth he's got hooked hooked teeth and the reason he does that is to pull you in when he's got you in his grasp he starts to coil you he starts to coil around you and he kills not by Venom he kills by Suffocation but watch this watch the put the definitions of Suffocation up there okay and so when you're thinking about this don't just think about the animal should think about the characteristics of that animal because that that's the spirit of python has the same characteristics watch watch him the state or process of dying from being deprived of eror or unable to breathe difficulty in breathing watch number three a feeling of being trapped or oppressed Webster also had to stop the respiration as of by strangling or asphixiation to deprive of oxygen to make uncomfortable by want to Fresh Air to impede or stop the de development of so so think about his characteristics okay number one if you get near him he'll grab you and and and once he grabs you they say the the the hold of of a large snake like that once he starts to coil you you better be careful but I I don't want to get ahead of myself that's a little bit further down but he but he grabs a hold of you and in between breaths right when you breathe you exhale it's relax but what he does is in between the breaths he squee tighter there's no rest every every breath he squeezes more starts to squeeze the very life out of you spiritually speaking he starts to squeeze everything out of you you can repeat the message by word but you have no rest because he's coiled you he's gotten a hold of you and that's not that's a very difficult situation to be in because his whole goal he doesn't kill you softly or slow very rapidly it's a very slow death it's it's it's death by can you imagine having the life squeezed out of you imagine okay take this in a spiritual sense we're talking physically but the natural types of spiritual that's what this Spirit comes to do we know that Spirits are tormentors he doesn't want to kill you right away what he wants to do he wants to recruit you he he consumes your whole life your whole life consists of your family your life consists of your church so he wants to consume all of you so as he starts to recruit other people then the squeeze starts to squeeze someone else then you start to plant seeds and somebody else then you got two people that that they're thinking the same now you got three people that are thinking the same people maybe even behind the pulpit that will preach with an agenda that's Spirit of python that's to squeeze the people to take the very life instead of having the Breath of Life instead of the rest squeezing you tormenting you so there's a sense of helplessness when you're in his grasps there's no way out but there's one way out do this do this what is this right here I want you to hold on to this okay this is your pinky right hook your pinky and I'll tell you later why watch this I went hunting with my brother and I thank God for my brother he pulled me out when I don't want to hear too many things he never he's never left me he pulled me out he told me something while I was hunting struck my soul I was telling about this message we were talking about the word and I was telling him about helpless and this and that and he says yes helpless or help less oh my goodness that's exactly what I was doing I was in the very coils and I didn't even know so I helped Less in interpretation help Less in the ministry help the pastor less I was helpless and I didn't know it the grasp he started to coil me and that's forgive me the night before I had a dream I don't dream very often this dream was very Vivid very real telling brother Diego it was so awkward it's hard for me to explain all I know is that I was like traveling we were hunting and I passed through and I saw this great machinery and I thought oh the Machinery that's against the bride there was these great devices I saw this big giant obese man huge taskmasters came to me and I was just it's like I was traveling the scene would change until I came to one and I when I confronted him he was in the form of a man but the only way I can explain it he was like smoke like a shadow I would see him travel through the dirt so when I I saw him I braced myself he was very aggressive looking all could see he had like like spikes in his head long fingers and he attacked me and and those it didn't scare me but when he started to lash his tongue out at me super long tongue he started to lash it at me and I thought to myself I braced myself and he he's lashing it at me but there was like a protection like a cover like a glass in front of me and his tongue would just move he couldn't get to me and I thought to myself if he touches me with that tongue I'm finished when I said that the scene changed I saw a picture of the tongue and I thought in the dream I thought oh it's like a tail or like a story in other words it's like a story I knew the way out when I said that when I exposed him I got back to camp and the sun was coming up so vivid so real but a dream has never scared me like that before I was asleep and I could feel the hair standing up on my body things don't scare me very very easily and I don't dream so I know it was something but I knew if he touched me I was done watch this the pastor when he preached this last message I felt he was preaching into my soul everything that he was preaching I told him I had to go and thank him I felt like he was preaching to me we heard brother Bernie the tape of brother Bernie lening for power oh my goodness what what a message and I came to this conclusion I know at the at the bottom line ye must be born again I have to be born again well brother you born again oh where the three stages of Grace justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost you cross the River Jordan in the in the the pyramid you you you get inside the pyramid are you born again yet potentially not yet have to climb that stature of a perfect go all the way to the top and and Brother Jimmy's favorite favorite um subject on adoption you have I forgot to tell about brother Jimmy brother jimmyy forgive me but effective immediately if if if you'll have me interpret I'll I'll help again thank you but you you follow me I know it's a little slow maybe it's a little it's a little a little boring but like I just I want to do what our pastor does and what our following Pastor would do I have to be an open book I never want to preach at you I'm only preaching what's happened to me like said I'm hoping it helps you so ye must be born again why is it so important to be born again Watch brother Bram put the the approach to God what does brother Bram say about a person that that that hasn't been born again brother Bram says he's a brute watch watch this watch this quote look at the maniaca see when Jesus when he met Jesus Remember When Jesus he had to meet Jesus but he's got to stay right like the song says he was restored to restored to his mind his right mind and a man without his right man mind no matter how much intellect he has he's still not sane yet a man without knowing Christ is nothing more hardly in himself than a brute he will for passions and lust he throw the baby out of a mother's arms and Rish her because of his own beastly lust that's right certainly he will with the definition of Brute I know we know what they are but just brute a savagely violent person or an animal an animal is opposed to a human being love or relating to beasts or beast so the beast at the beginning is the beast at the end we know that he injected himself in Genesis into the human race and this is for you young people go and study it out if the curse of the serpent was to go on his belly what was it before it was something before the curse was a snake he was something before in Genesis he says that that Enoch was the seventh from Adam in the genealogy if you add it makes him eight I believe in the book of Jude it says the Cain which was of the wicked one was Adam Wicked God's son who was he from study it out and I guarantee you it'll lead you to the right answer but a beast so I got this thought and I ran by the pastor because I don't want to be off my Rock ER Revelation 17 I see a woman riding on top of a beast if I know my symbols I see a church riding on a power remember there's lusting for power and then there's a power of lust this woman was even drunk with the blood of the Saints so I I understand the seven heads and 10 horns and the dictators and all this I I understand that bringing it down to us to the microcosm I see a church I see a woman without the new birth will be guided by human impulse this Beast this flesh we heard about the serpent in the harbor brother Jimmy without the new birth you will make decisions you will act and think through this guy human or through beastly impulses impuls amen amen maybe that's a little a little rough but like I said I this is for me it's not for nobody else I don't want to be guilty of that I don't want to be responsible for the blood of the Saints by going and spraying and infecting someone else then you become the very the very python for somebody else you begin to kill the people now if we kill if I kill brother Tommy's influence Tommy what does that make me that's Beast if I talk about my my brother dieo brother brother rer anybody if I act that way it only shows what I'm being Guided by and it's not the Holy Ghost it's Beast amen amen so without knowing Christ it's a brute it's a beast and it's unfruitful driven by these carnal impulses I see the Roman system inside the people you see Nebuchadnezzar's dream the head of gold is the beginning it ends with iron and Clay on the toes the following pasture with say it says iron is Rome Clay is the people that Spirit would be inside the people it's the system it's the Beast and then there's an image to the Beast anything that's set up like the Beast is an image to the Beast any anybody a person one person can be a denomination because all they has to do is start from one person I don't want to be that person so the seed the serpent seed Bible says if that is not wiped out of us it will lead us down that path this woman will be carried by by this Beast she'll be driven by this Beast time do I have brother supp to be my thank keeper got watch I'll hurry so the last time brother brother Kay preached preached into my soul and I found out that I needed to be more sincere watch the way a founding Pastor used sincere one time he used the word sincere and he used it free of Tangles watch watch Tangles put up definition of Tangles to become entangled a matted Twisted Mass a complicated or confused state of condition watch the synonyms entangle entwine interwine and twist twist not or coil who coils you the python he suffocates you right watch this I'm getting to this I'll get to this because then I won't finish other snakes bite you but he wants to consume you he wants to torment you he don't he wants to take the very breath put the exposition of the seven Church ages the Ephesian Church age we won't read it says see how it started out in in the early church it was called Deeds and they become a Doctrine they become the standard they become unbending way it finally took over and God was pushed aside oh it started so small so quietly so inoffensively it looked so good it seemed so sound then it caught a hold like a python it squeezed out the very [Music] breath and killed all spirituality there was in the church that's how powerful the spirit is the spirit of python they have a lot of information on the internet I didn't read any of it because they all talk about yes squeezing and stff like we understand that but watch this his whole thing is to torment watch this I'll get into my into this part I want to get here here's the key I want you to take away from this message if the python is successful to wrap around your hands you're finished taking into the spiritual right let me repeat it like this if he coils around the fold Ministries influence in your life you're done you know brother Bram when he shot the snake in that in that in that Vision he shot it on the side and it into a puddle of water he got away right we'll meet him again only he didn't stay a small snake he didn't stay in a small puddle of water he says that old dragon that serpent the devil called Satan also known as Leviathan how many know what a leviathan is he's just a GI a giant sea serpent but watch this if he if he coils your hand you're done so why in the world would you want to do away with a fightful Ministry it said it said in these countries where there's these large snakes the thing is this let me see if I have that article how do survive a constrictor says watch this don't let it wrap you up keep your arms and your hands free try to get the coils off quickly control the head if you have a friend with you have them grab the head you grab the tail and start to unwind him start to uncoil him if it's just you he says I guess it's a war now do whatever you need to do to get free know the more that you struggle the tighter it squeezes that's the Instinct of the animal if you have a knife how many have a knife how many have a sword we don't have a knif we have a sword if you have a sword get it out quickly get it out quickly to get them off of you don't wait the longer you wait the less chance of survival so he quel around me but he missed I'll tell you what he missed you know what he missed what's this again he missed the pinky the pinky also known as the little finger small little finger huh the thumb and the pointer and the and the middle finger the finger the pinky looks so insignificant did you know that 50% of the hand strength is in the pinky grab some do me a favor grab the the the bench in front of you not grab with the pinky 50% of the hand strength is in the pastor say it the way it is it's in him right now especially in the same time the former and the latter rain are raining together right now the strength is in him if you the further you get away from him you're getting away from the strength he missed the pinky and when he missed the pinky his tail met the Pinky and it hooked him and with the strength of the hand I was able to uncoil him to get him off of me take him off quickly Church run if you're in his grasp or in his coil I don't care who you are it doesn't matter if you're a minister run to the pinky use the pinky HCK the tail do away with the story don't let it come to your ears get off of you quickly the smallest finger oh why is he the smallest finger is it because he's small in stature because oh no no no no the Way Up Is Down and because of his humble nature the pastor is the Beast of Burden there's also a power he has power and he's a beast of burden for you and I carrying all our loads yes Jesus Christ died for our sin thank God that there's men that are willing roll up their sleeves and get me out of the mud I thank God for those people where would I be without them the former and the lot of rain together right now sewing and the reaping not right now said that power right now in the end time amen do you believe that job 41 if you can put it up please Jo 411 can thou draw out Leviathan with a hook or his tongue with a cord which thou let us down amen can you draw him out started off as a little snake harmless but he's turned into a leviathan r now the scripture says that Yahweh was the one that was going to defeat him only God himself can defeat him but where is God today is God the god of the universe it's God but in his people amen amen do you believe that do you honestly believe that what this Leviathan and python excuse me so now he's a big serpent the very word Leviathan means giant it means bth it means goath watch this Psalms 741 why withdraws thou thy hand even the right hand pluck it out of thy bosom for God is my king of old working salvation in the midst of the earth th did divide the Sea by thy strength you know where his strength is right now thou breakast the heads of the Dragons Waters thou breakast the heads of leviathans in pieces and gave us him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness how you you hooked them you got them out of you you hooked them with a pinky I I want you to do one thing for me pinky insignificant huh there's something called a pinky promise you know a pinky promise seems like something for children did you know the pinky promise was very serious I believe the pinky promise was used by the Chinese Mafia I believe and what they would do is they would pinky promise and anyone that would break the pinky promise would have the pinky chopped off that's where it came from so it's it like a little child thing no no no very serious so now as the wife of the church and the head of the church the husband to the church I have to pinky promise you can't break a pinky promise that I will stay with him that I will back him up that I will not let people speak evil of him that I will will be obedient but obedience without tangle obedience without ulterior motives behind it obedience without gu in my mouth obedience without saying and Wan thing and doing another that is not obedience obedience is free of coils free of Tangles hook him and I did that because they always say in a relationship it's 50/50 right we know it's 100 100 you but humor me for this wife the wife has to come and meet with the husband he takes a step towards you you take a step towards him he takes a step towards you promise don't forget don't forget that as the musicians come I'm done oh I want [Applause] to let me just read this uh a a dream that brother Lorenzo had had cleared through our pastor just just Place something soft watch watch his dream he titles the dream pythons and he says I found myself among some homes of brothers and sisters I couldn't say whose specific homes but I knew that they were brothers and sisters from our church as I was walking outside I saw a python snake curled up outside one of the brother's homes and it scared me to see the size of the snake the snake was with its eyes open but just curled up as if it was waiting for something remember how they hunt they hunt through his signature so the revivals are great absolutely pythons are hunting Be watchful that's it but he was waiting for something remember how they hunt don't get near it get as far away from it as possible like that man that that was looking for he needed to go on a journey and he picked the man that says I hug the wall I stay away from the Cliff as far as possible he says but it scared me to see this so I quickly went to a place to call the husband because the husband was not home I grabbed the husband by the hand and pulled him and told him to hurry and come quickly with me because I needed to show him what was at his home we we we then both hurried to his home and I showed the husband where the python was curled up the husband was concerned and I was going to pick up the python to throw it out of the house when all of a sudden now this is I was here okay the wife entered the home and the husband was upset telling the wife that needed to throw this python out of their home when all of a sudden the wife got upset went up to the snake and picked it up picked up the snake by its head and brought the snake to her lips and started to kiss the snake as she was kissing a harmless puppy the wife said why do you want to throw him out if he's so pretty and cute then she began to rub the nose rub her nose to the nose of the snake I saw the husband get upset said but in order not to argue with the wife he just let them walk out of his house I saw the husband leave his house then I turned back around to see the wife and the Python and the wife started to hug the wife started to hug the python watch this the python started to hug her back curling himself around her the wife even giggled as it looked like they were playing around with each other when all of a sudden the playfulness started startled the wife as the python got rough with her began to to the python began to start choking the wife from the top of her head all the way down to her ankles as he was curled up on her from head to toe then an angel came by my right side and said you see my senses were heightened and I knew what he meant he meant when the python gets into that position then it's too late I was saddened by this and I walked out of the home and I saw two more homes that sisters didn't know if they were there were SS were playing with Pythons outside of their homes treating them as harmless puppies I didn't know if there were more homes that were having the same problem because it saddened me so much to see that my brothers and sisters had no idea what they were playing with so I shut my eyes because I didn't want to see anymore and when I shut my eyes Here Comes This I heard a familiar voice it was one of our ministers shout out I killed one of them pythons I said glory to God somebody's getting it you know there's an opportunity for anybody that feels helpless I you do you feel hopeless you feel like you're too far gone sometimes this can take any form now okay not just drugs and alcohol it can be finances it can be a religious spirit it can take on so many forms but I counsel you pinky promise Pinky Promise tonight promise that you'll stay your word that you'll stay don't get F far away from him get closer to him you know the purpose of this python Spirit yeah he wants to get all of us his main goal is after the shepherd because he knows if he can get the shepherd we're done so God bless you tonight I just hope any one little thing can help you open my heart to you all I just want to say again thank you and I love you God bless you [Music] amen thank you brother Jerry for the word this evening we give another one to the
