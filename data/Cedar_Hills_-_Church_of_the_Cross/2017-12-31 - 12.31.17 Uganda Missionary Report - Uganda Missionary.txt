she was growing up and down down I'm Sandow and our pastor gets into it right away little symmetric wave oh I think our pastures is Hassim African in him okay okay looking at for Selena s Park Africa no it was uh it was it was a blessing to see them to see them worship the way they were in love in this universe kumail's Lauren you know I I their worship is is so sincere and so precious other citizens in Saratov ratio so it feels like like every time they're worshipping in it it doesn't matter what song they sing no less equal consumer of butter sake you know Rondo they just they I mean they can just say a sentence and make a song out of it well that's it almost no spell out a supernatural moon wouldn't come to this allowed us one of my favorite songs was uh you know Jesus they say

real mental Acosta when they started talking about the Devils on local man of Louisville Diablo they started talking about the devil and they're like the devil is a loser man a loser man kill the other a lot in keep Elias and I mean they can if you let them they would just be there for hours just worshipping the Lord was the catalyst to Iran por hora see other angle Senor it feels like they
