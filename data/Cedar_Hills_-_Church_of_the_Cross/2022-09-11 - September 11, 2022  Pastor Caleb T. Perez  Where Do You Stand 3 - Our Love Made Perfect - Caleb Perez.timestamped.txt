[51:57] he wants us to stay as little children
[52:01] but how many want to go on to perfection
[52:06] i want to go on to perfection or
[52:08] maturity
[52:10] so let's open our bibles if we can to
[52:13] the book of first john the fourth
[52:15] chapter primera de juan capitulo
[52:37] and it reads like this
[52:40] and we have known
[52:43] and believed the love
[52:45] that god hath to us
[52:52] how many have experienced that
[52:53] experiment
[52:54] let me see your hands you gotta i want
[52:56] to see if you know the the love that god
[52:59] hath
[53:00] to you and to us
[53:04] god
[53:05] is
[53:06] love
[53:08] can we all say that together
[53:10] god
[53:11] is love
[53:13] and he that dwelleth in love
[53:16] dwelleth in god
[53:18] and god in him
[53:23] now here's here's where we're getting
[53:24] the the subtitle of our message
[53:27] herein is our love
[53:30] made perfect
[53:33] how many would like your love to be made
[53:35] perfect
[53:38] that we may have boldness
[53:45] [Music]
[53:54] [Music]
[54:06] he that feareth is not made perfect
[54:21] [Music]
[54:35] for he that loveth not his brother whom
[54:37] he hath seen
[54:40] how can he love god whom he hath not
[54:42] seen como peda maradios que no abis and
[54:44] this commandment have we from him
[54:49] that he who loveth god
[54:53] love
[54:53] his brother
[54:55] also am i am a tambien
[54:57] god add his blessings to the reading of
[54:59] his word you may be seated
[55:03] i pray that this can be a help to you
[55:05] this this morning
[55:09] i believe that when we speak of love
[55:13] it is probably one of the most
[55:15] misunderstood or misused words in all
[55:17] the human vocabulary vocabularies
[55:22] it has been used so loosely
[55:26] that the real meaning of love has been
[55:29] lost
[55:32] to many people
[55:34] it's simply that fuzzy little feeling
[55:37] you get in your in your stomach
[55:42] when you get around a certain person
[55:46] you hear people say oh he or she
[55:49] completes me
[55:54] let me see anybody ever heard that
[55:57] how many of you have ever said that
[55:59] pontos landicho
[56:02] you ain't going to tell me huh
[56:05] and all that is
[56:06] simply what you would call
[56:09] movie love
[56:10] it
[56:12] did you get that
[56:13] i'm going to say it again it's just
[56:15] movie love it's
[56:16] right we've watched too many movies
[56:20] and it has watered down love so much
[56:24] that many people are not even capable of
[56:26] loving
[56:27] them
[56:41] in the greek one of them is called
[56:43] phileo love and el gregos
[56:46] that's the love that you would have for
[56:48] your wife
[56:53] is the love it is divine love is
[57:07] and yet we put it all together if it's
[57:10] as if it's all the
[57:24] of
[57:36] [Applause]
[58:07] of those types two types of love
[58:10] and i'm almost sure and this is what i
[58:13] want to make sure we hit home today
[58:17] and i'm almost sure
[58:20] that many of us has been deceived
[58:26] i'm here this morning because i don't
[58:28] want to be deceived
[58:30] how many can say i don't want to be
[58:32] deceived preacher
[58:47] and thinking that it's agape love or
[58:50] divine love
[58:53] love is intellectual
[58:57] agape love comes from the heart
[59:02] godly love doesn't question
[59:07] human love questions everything
[59:11] human love reasons
[59:14] but godly love does not reason
[59:26] it just produces faith
[59:30] when you really
[59:44] that produces
[1:00:11] then you're loving him with a filio or
[1:00:14] human love
[1:00:17] did you get that
[1:00:19] i'm going to say it again
[1:00:21] there are many that have been deceived
[1:00:25] thinking that they love god
[1:00:28] which i don't doubt that they do okay
[1:00:31] but they're trying to love god with the
[1:00:33] human love
[1:00:36] and you can't love him that way
[1:00:40] when you love him like that
[1:00:42] your love has not been perfected yet
[1:00:46] how many are going to go on this trip
[1:00:48] with me this morning
[1:00:50] wants me to ask the question
[1:00:53] how much of you really
[1:00:55] love the lord jesus christ
[1:00:59] if you really love the lord jesus
[1:01:02] christ now my question is
[1:01:04] on what level do you love him
[1:01:17] it's important that we answer these
[1:01:19] questions
[1:01:22] because we cannot be deceived
[1:01:25] thinking that we love god with agape
[1:01:30] agape and yet we hate our brother or
[1:01:32] sister
[1:01:35] then your love is only a human love
[1:01:39] and you are deceived
[1:01:42] many of us has been deceived he says
[1:01:46] revelations the 12th chapter and the
[1:01:48] ninth verse
[1:01:51] and i want to put all this together
[1:01:54] and it reads like this and the great
[1:01:56] dragon was cast out
[1:01:59] that old serpent
[1:02:02] called the devil
[1:02:04] and
[1:02:17] many of us has
[1:02:30] the whole world
[1:02:36] by making them think that they have
[1:02:38] agape love
[1:02:40] spencer
[1:02:41] and all they really have is affiliates
[1:02:46] think about that for a moment okay
[1:02:49] because we want to know we want to check
[1:02:51] ourselves this morning
[1:02:54] when we live by filio love instead of
[1:02:56] agape
[1:02:58] faith
[1:02:59] is not produced on that level
[1:03:02] understand that's why there's so much
[1:03:04] lack of faith today
[1:03:07] because there's too much deception
[1:03:11] oh i love i i love the lord oh you i'm
[1:03:13] one senior you love me he
[1:03:29] it would be so very close the bible says
[1:03:34] that it would deceive the very elect if
[1:03:37] it were possible
[1:03:40] thank god this morning that we know that
[1:03:42] it is not possible for the elect to be
[1:03:45] deceived
[1:03:48] has deceived the whole world
[1:03:52] but he has not deceived the elect
[1:03:56] satan then is deceiving today
[1:04:00] satan cannot love
[1:04:04] he puts a front as if he does love
[1:04:09] he doesn't come at you saying giving a
[1:04:12] hate speech
[1:04:15] no he comes and says let us all love one
[1:04:18] another
[1:04:20] he uses the same word
[1:04:24] and let's
[1:04:52] or one would go against what he's trying
[1:04:55] to do
[1:04:58] then you see the real nature of satan
[1:05:03] of lies
[1:05:05] who spews hatred
[1:05:09] mark 13 6 make sure you have your bibles
[1:05:12] because we're going to read quite a few
[1:05:13] scriptures here marco treste says
[1:05:16] 13 6 when you have it you can say amen
[1:05:19] says
[1:05:32] you got it
[1:05:34] all right
[1:05:35] for many shall come in my name
[1:05:38] is saying i am christ
[1:05:42] and shall deceive
[1:05:44] many
[1:05:47] i'm almost sure
[1:05:50] that many of us
[1:05:52] has been deceived
[1:05:56] they have a gopher love
[1:05:58] simply
[1:06:02] many would come in his name he says
[1:06:05] say i am christ
[1:06:11] why would there be such a deception
[1:06:15] we live in a day and age where there is
[1:06:16] more deception than there has ever been
[1:06:19] in the history of mankind
[1:06:23] why is it a deception
[1:06:26] because many are saying i am the christ
[1:06:30] i am
[1:06:33] christ is the anointed one
[1:06:36] and he is the very expression of god's
[1:06:39] love
[1:06:42] we read in first john four lamos
[1:06:48] and therefore god was in christ
[1:06:52] reconciling the world to himself
[1:06:56] love
[1:06:57] is not a feeling
[1:07:10] of the lord jesus christ
[1:07:25] there's no such a thing as agape love in
[1:07:27] your life
[1:07:30] do you love him
[1:07:32] on that level
[1:07:35] it's a question you gotta answer the
[1:07:36] question
[1:07:39] do you love him on the level that
[1:07:40] abraham did
[1:07:43] once again i quote our founding pastor
[1:07:50] there is a test
[1:07:53] i know you've loved me here yo
[1:07:56] i know you've loved me here
[1:07:59] i know you've done this for me
[1:08:02] i know you've done that yeah
[1:08:04] but i want to make sure
[1:08:07] that what you have is worthy of the
[1:08:11] promises
[1:08:13] all your qualities will be determined
[1:08:18] everything in you
[1:08:21] your whole disposition
[1:09:06] he wants you to love him on that level
[1:09:10] first timothy
[1:09:11] chapter 2 and verse 14.
[1:09:18] primera timothy
[1:09:26] but the woman being deceived
[1:09:29] was in the transgression
[1:09:33] what a type
[1:09:34] que tipo it was not jesus that was
[1:09:36] deceived nor jesus
[1:09:38] it was us the church that was deceived
[1:09:42] of a woman
[1:09:45] you know the other day i mean
[1:09:58] he is
[1:09:59] 80 or 81 years old
[1:10:03] and i began to tell him
[1:10:06] where the giants came from
[1:10:08] he looked at me
[1:10:10] as i was explaining to him
[1:10:14] i said now don't just take my word for
[1:10:15] it
[1:10:18] i want you to to know it by the
[1:10:20] scripture
[1:10:22] that what i'm telling you is not some
[1:10:23] man made something that we made up
[1:10:28] when i finished with him explaining
[1:10:32] the seed of cain and so forth
[1:10:36] serpent seed and i explained that to him
[1:10:41] he says
[1:10:42] and just to know it's been there the
[1:10:45] whole time
[1:10:48] why hadn't i seen it
[1:10:52] 80 years and i had never even heard this
[1:10:55] before ochenta ano
[1:11:07] it shows it when he wants when he
[1:11:09] chooses to reveal it to you when
[1:11:13] when the woman this is genesis chapter 3
[1:11:15] verse 6.
[1:11:18] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[1:11:20] good for food
[1:11:24] and that it
[1:11:32] you know that that's why it's such a
[1:11:33] surface thing when they when they say oh
[1:11:35] eve ate an apple
[1:11:37] table
[1:11:53] a lot of things but i want you to get
[1:11:54] this now
[1:11:56] it was a tree to be desired
[1:12:00] to make one wise
[1:12:04] he took of the fruit thereof
[1:12:06] and did
[1:12:16] not to see what really happened in the
[1:12:18] garden of eden
[1:12:33] it makes you realize that you're naked
[1:12:37] we should be passing out the apples
[1:12:38] today
[1:12:41] so many without their clothes
[1:12:44] maybe it's time to pass the apples
[1:12:47] but it was never about apples
[1:12:51] notice this now a treat to be desired to
[1:12:54] make one wise
[1:12:58] he took of the fruit and did eat and
[1:12:59] gave also one to her husband with her
[1:13:43] the serpent showed her something that
[1:13:44] she had never experienced
[1:13:49] the door was opened the door of desire
[1:13:51] la puerta forever
[1:13:54] that's why the bible says it was a tree
[1:13:56] to be desired to make one wise
[1:14:01] if we jump to verse 9 it says and the
[1:14:03] lord called god called unto adam
[1:14:09] and said unto him where art
[1:14:12] where are you standing
[1:14:15] come on that's that's the title of the
[1:14:17] message where do you stand this morning
[1:14:21] there's so many things that are pulling
[1:14:22] you
[1:14:24] know and here with us and here with
[1:14:38] and he said i heard thy voice in the
[1:14:40] garden
[1:14:53] it means perfect love is not present
[1:14:57] what happened to this perfect love
[1:15:00] perfecto
[1:15:02] by a perfect man that was in a perfect
[1:15:04] garden
[1:15:07] i was afraid because i was naked
[1:15:11] and i hear myself
[1:15:14] and he said
[1:15:16] who told thee
[1:15:20] hast thou eaten of the tree whereof i
[1:15:22] command thee that thou should is not
[1:15:24] easy
[1:15:29] that if he could control your desires
[1:15:34] he can control you
[1:15:36] come
[1:15:58] where do you think the greeks and the
[1:16:00] romans got their stories about their
[1:16:02] gods
[1:16:17] was the greek god of passion and
[1:16:19] fertility
[1:16:22] the god of love and sex
[1:16:26] means
[1:16:27] desire eros
[1:16:29] now i'm going to go back to what i said
[1:16:31] in the beginning
[1:16:45] with having filio
[1:17:13] erotic love attraction
[1:17:37] i pray you get these things write them
[1:17:39] down and you can study it when you get
[1:17:40] home
[1:17:43] for we ourselves
[1:17:45] also were sometimes foolish
[1:17:48] disobedient
[1:17:50] deceived
[1:17:52] serving divers lusts
[1:17:54] and pleasures
[1:17:56] living in malice and envy hateful and
[1:17:59] hating one another
[1:18:09] malicious
[1:18:31] i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
[1:18:33] thy conception
[1:18:38] in sorrow thou shalt bring forth
[1:18:40] children
[1:18:44] and thy desire
[1:18:48] shall be to thy husband
[1:18:51] and he shall rule over thee
[1:18:54] that's not a very popular scripture
[1:18:56] nowadays
[1:18:59] but what a thing it is when god tells
[1:19:01] the woman
[1:19:04] your desire shall be
[1:19:06] to
[1:19:21] her desire would be to her husband
[1:19:25] but watch the book of song of solomon's
[1:19:28] chapter 7 in verse 10.
[1:19:33] i am my beloved and his desire
[1:19:38] is toward me
[1:19:44] in other words
[1:19:46] her desire
[1:20:17] i want you to
[1:20:18] see this on another level

[1:21:37] our eyes are wondering our hearts are
[1:21:39] wondering

[1:22:05] that you must as i have to do it all the
[1:22:07] time
[1:22:21] is
[1:22:33] but better is the sight of the eyes than
[1:22:35] the wandering of the desire

[1:22:42] that is going on today

[1:41:45] i said now what if the same little woman
[1:41:48] that little prostitute
[1:41:50] would come up to jesus
[1:41:53] throw her arms around him and say jesus
[1:41:55] i love you
[1:41:58] jesus
[1:42:11] but with the lord jesus
[1:42:25] it's a higher
[1:42:32] many of us have had loved ones that have
[1:42:34] passed away
[1:42:37] even though we know that
[1:42:39] that the next
[1:42:41] the next stage or or event is
[1:42:43] the dead in christ will rise
[1:42:48] but let me ask you a question
[1:42:50] are you more excited to see your loved
[1:42:52] ones
[1:43:01] come on now
[1:43:03] i'm trying to see
[1:43:05] get you to see something here okay
[1:43:08] our
[1:43:09] [Music]
[1:43:19] trying to show our love to god with the
[1:43:21] same filial life
[1:43:35] i think you're tired i might as well
[1:43:37] quit okay
[1:43:40] i'll quit now
[1:43:42] i've had enough
[1:43:43] preacher yeah yeah
[1:43:46] well let's go just a little farther then
[1:43:50] it isn't jesus christ that we love the
[1:43:52] most senior jesus
[1:43:55] that's what he's after this morning
[1:43:58] the church
[1:44:00] they love me more see me
[1:44:02] and they love their families
[1:44:04] familiar
[1:44:07] do you love him more than anything else
[1:44:11] if we don't say no it's time that we
[1:44:14] doesn't
[1:44:21] when we love each other
[1:44:25] we love
[1:44:26] creation more than the creators
[1:44:32] of
[1:44:34] i show my love to god by by loving my
[1:44:37] husband loving my wife absolutely
[1:44:43] who gave you your husband
[1:44:46] he gave us your children
[1:45:00] you'll love
[1:45:30] before you can have faith
[1:45:33] so if you say you got faith
[1:45:36] and don't divinely love god
[1:45:40] your faith is in vain
[1:46:25] when i was your age
[1:46:27] i don't know what you're thinking
[1:46:30] i was your age you didn't answer that a
[1:46:32] little bit i was about to get married
[1:46:37] i was coming from colorado de nia de
[1:46:40] colorado couldn't wait to see my bride
[1:46:44] i'm going to get married
[1:46:47] all the way it is yeah yeah don't let me
[1:46:49] get in an accident
[1:47:06] lord bless them
[1:47:09] what a thing
[1:47:10] but do we love him
[1:47:14] how many can say i love him more than
[1:47:16] anything i love him more than life
[1:47:19] itself
[1:47:26] you're a free moral agent it is
[1:47:28] delivered
[1:47:29] you act on whatever you desire to act
[1:47:32] upon
[1:47:34] what's your
[1:47:47] whatever your soul is charmed for lo que
[1:47:50] tengai en su alma that's what you'll eat
[1:47:55] and since our soul is the nature of the
[1:47:57] spirit
[1:48:00] whatever nature we have dictates what
[1:48:02] our desires
[1:48:16] let me see how many how many have that
[1:48:18] desire
[1:48:20] there's a desire to want more of god
[1:48:24] there has to be more of god somewhere
[1:48:26] foreign
[1:48:56] to satisfy the desires that's in the
[1:48:58] body
[1:49:26] say it again
[1:49:40] desire over here and over here
[1:49:44] back and forth
[1:49:47] and then we hear him say
[1:49:50] i'm almost sure
[1:49:52] many of us have
[1:50:08] you can tell who is on
[1:50:10] your throne
[1:50:13] amen by your desire
[1:50:16] you can tell who is on the throne of
[1:50:17] your heart
[1:50:21] god deals
[1:50:23] with that subconsciously
[1:50:26] stop for a moment okay and i'm coming
[1:50:29] around the corner and and then we'll be
[1:50:30] stopping here
[1:50:33] god deals with the
[1:50:36] subconscious how many knows that we have
[1:50:38] a conscience and a subconscious mind
[1:50:43] and the way that our subconscious works
[1:50:48] is that it stirs you from within
[1:50:53] up here you're trying to think of
[1:50:54] something in your head
[1:50:57] but way down in the soul there's
[1:50:59] something else that's
[1:51:01] moving
[1:51:04] over
[1:51:18] i believe
[1:51:35] you were conscious about believing god
[1:51:37] and hearing his word
[1:51:40] but it had never come down to the
[1:51:41] subconscious
[1:51:44] i think now notice this now
[1:51:47] if they
[1:51:48] believe down here
[1:51:51] this is for all of us if you believe
[1:51:53] down here
[1:51:55] the way that you believe up here
[1:51:58] things would be different las cosas
[1:52:07] instead we walk around with a mental
[1:52:09] conception
[1:52:12] glory to god i'm healed
[1:52:14] but in your soul it's not saying the
[1:52:16] same thing
[1:52:20] think about this why we don't get when
[1:52:22] we ask the lord many times we ask a
[1:52:23] mistake
[1:52:27] healing to take place
[1:52:43] your soul
[1:52:45] it all has to be in cooperation with god
[1:52:49] with the channel of god
[1:52:52] and then the blessing can flow right to
[1:52:54] you
[1:53:09] we're so caught up with the conscious
[1:53:11] mind
[1:53:13] what we've seen what we say
[1:53:17] we have no idea
[1:53:19] what the subconscious mind is thinking
[1:53:21] okay
[1:53:38] and therefore
[1:53:51] see what our subconscious has been
[1:53:52] thinking
[1:53:56] wow
[1:53:57] we're talking about our love being made
[1:53:59] perfect
[1:54:02] jesus said have faith in god jesus
[1:54:05] you say to this mountain be moved it
[1:54:21] conscious and the subconscious and the
[1:54:22] harmony
[1:54:27] with god's word
[1:54:29] watch what will happen
[1:54:32] we've got to be in perfect harmony
[1:54:48] when i look in the mirror do i see
[1:54:49] myself in complete maturity
[1:54:56] love produces faith
[1:55:00] faith cometh by hearing
[1:55:07] why do you think
[1:55:10] you know sometimes they call it
[1:55:12] entertainment
[1:55:15] everywhere you go it's all about
[1:55:16] entertainment
[1:55:18] but in all reality it's not
[1:55:20] entertainment
[1:55:23] it's containment
[1:55:26] it's about controlling us
[1:55:28] what the world tries to do
[1:55:44] over and
[1:55:51] it becomes recorded then after a certain
[1:55:54] amount of time
[1:55:57] it becomes it becomes recorded in your
[1:55:59] subconscious
[1:56:02] and the more that your conscious mind
[1:56:04] hears something
[1:56:09] then it feeds it to your subconscious
[1:56:11] mind
[1:56:40] hello
[1:56:40] everybody hola say it again once it
[1:56:42] drops to your subconscious
[1:56:46] it becomes part of who you are
[1:56:49] how do you think
[1:56:50] how you act
[1:56:52] and that in turn will determine your
[1:56:54] destination
[1:56:58] you're safe as long as it's just in your
[1:57:00] conscious mind
[1:57:02] because you can forget what's in your
[1:57:04] conscious mind
[1:57:07] but once it's transferred into
[1:57:17] proverbs 23 7 says for as he thinketh in
[1:57:20] his heart
[1:57:27] you hear a bunch of gossip over and over
[1:57:29] and over again
[1:57:31] how you think in your heart
[1:57:34] and then you wonder why do i have these
[1:57:36] dreams
[1:57:52] and whoever can get the most information
[1:57:53] in your heart controls
[1:57:56] information
[1:57:57] that's why the greatest battle ever
[1:57:59] fought is there in the minds
[1:58:03] you work on this conscious mind by
[1:58:05] repeating repetitive things over and
[1:58:07] over
[1:58:10] the conscious mind makes the transfer
[1:58:12] into the heart
[1:58:16] that's why the battle goes on
[1:58:19] and we wonder why
[1:58:20] when we've done so many things for years
[1:58:23] and years and years
[1:58:29] we want to change
[1:58:46] they're on fire for the lord it's an
[1:58:48] infuego and what happens
[1:58:50] they go back to the same thing
[1:58:52] regressing
[1:58:53] what happened que paso
[1:58:56] they weren't able to wipe the
[1:58:58] subconscious
[1:59:31] [Music]
[1:59:43] you're conscious of it
[1:59:46] those things are building a kingdom
[1:59:48] inside of it
[1:59:51] but when it's been wiped clean
[1:59:54] olympia by the blood of the lamb
[2:00:08] that desire is no longer for
[2:00:13] [Applause]
[2:00:46] hello brother will would you come to the
[2:00:47] piano or else i ain't gonna see this

[2:02:02] with a failure love

[2:02:18] again
[2:02:20] this is how we know we've loved god with
[2:02:22] a filial love estas
[2:02:26] because
[2:02:28] we get upset at god
[2:02:44] video love como se es que llamas con
[2:02:46] amor filio because when things go bad in
[2:02:48] our lives
[2:02:51] we want to blame god
[2:02:54] [Music]
[2:02:56] why could did you let this happen
[2:03:07] it stands there and knows that it's
[2:03:08] god's will

[2:03:13] through

[2:03:17] beyond any shadow of a doubt
[2:03:20] it is the love being perfected
[2:03:24] wiring of you and i
[2:03:27] that's why the capstone is the capstone
[2:03:29] of love
[2:03:31] corona is the piece of the ammonia
[2:03:33] even when we don't get what we think we
[2:03:34] want
[2:03:39] when we try to put the blame on god for
[2:03:41] something in our life
[2:03:45] you did it for them and not for me
[2:03:54] it

[2:16:25] and then little by little he blesses you
[2:16:29] and he gives you illegal and it seems
[2:16:32] like the more he gives us the more
[2:16:33] starchy we become
[2:16:36] nos
[2:16:39] and then we sometimes think we're a
[2:16:40] little too good to raise our hands and
[2:16:42] cry
[2:16:57] thanking him and telling him how much he
[2:16:59] means
[2:17:02] i love you lord jesus with all my heart
