[33:46] product for you if you want to sleep in

[38:21] school to be able to be a witness for
[38:23] someone and understand that it's not a
[38:26] shame to be a Christian
[38:28] and it's also very important for them to
[38:31] have a service in their own level
[38:33] and I also want all the children to be
[38:36] able to stay after the service like they
[38:38] did in Luke 34 didn't it burn we don't
[38:42] within our hearts

[43:56] in Israel has been absolutely remarkable
[43:59] we went to here let me say we went to
[44:02] Bethlehem where Jesus was born we also
[44:05] went to Nazareth where he was raised and
[44:07] that was absolutely amazing we were we
[44:09] had the privilege to put our hands on a
[44:11] whaling wall and um we actually prayed
[44:15] to Jesus there which was remarkable it
[44:17] was breathtaking and I can ask for a
[44:19] better experience
[44:22] yes
[44:26] that's it
[44:28] what's up bad and I what's going on
[44:31] wow we would like to know
[44:34] how was your experience here in Israel
[44:37] it was tremendous
[44:40] we had such a great time meeting the
[44:42] people we went to meet and some brothers
[44:45] and sisters here locally went to their
[44:48] church
[44:48] it was just a blessing to fellowship
[44:51] with them uh you heard Brother Joseph
[44:53] talking about the different places that
[44:55] we've gone we also went to mount
[44:57] Temptation today
[44:58] uh before coming here and then you see
[45:01] the Jordan River like they've been
[45:02] telling y'all there's so much other
[45:04] things that we're going to be seeing
[45:05] it's great it's wonderful it's a
[45:08] blessing and we hope that all of you
[45:10] guys enjoy all the pictures and
[45:13] videos I'd like to interview one more
[45:15] question and thank you brother Marcus
[45:17] yes Brother Carlos
[45:21] hello brother how are you good you good
[45:25] doing well sir doing well good can you
[45:28] can you tell the church
[45:30] how how your experience
[45:33] this hell was yours
[45:35] um I sure can my experience with that
[45:37] and I was uh
[45:39] nothing short of amazing it's it's what
[45:41] I would probably call a once in a
[45:42] lifetime opportunity
[45:44] um it's it's uh it's an opportunity to
[45:46] come to the Holy Land and and be here
[45:49] but not just visit a place like this but
[45:51] also have the opportunity to accompany
[45:53] my pastor and a lot of tremendous
[45:55] Brethren from our church I'm here and
[45:58] and it's been a remarkable opportunity
[46:00] it's been truly humbling
[46:03] um it has been something that is
[46:05] eye-opening and that I would recommend
[46:07] for anybody please try to make this trip
[46:10] it's it gives you a completely different
[46:12] perspective on the Bible you see the
[46:16] Bible through a totally different set of
[46:19] eyes and you understand the Bible in a
[46:21] way that that you cannot possibly grasp
[46:24] unless you come to this place so brother
[46:27] and I I think that's that's that's all
[46:29] I've got to say but it's been amazing
[46:30] and thank you for the opportunity thank
[46:32] you
[46:33] well that's it son thank you to see him
[46:36] and Reporting live from Israel where
[46:39] Jesus Christ comes first thank you thank
[46:41] you
[46:48] let me just say I better ask for
[46:49] forgiveness
[46:51] I did not know the Rio Grande was that
[46:52] impactful
[46:55] it looked like they were behind the
[46:57] Alamo
[47:04] let's see
[47:11] are we missing something
[47:13] did we cover it all
[47:15] I think we did why don't we read that
[47:18] scripture again
[47:20] Ephesians 4 25.
[47:24] you know there's so many bad things
[47:26] going on so much fake news
[47:29] we want to always focus on the good
[47:31] things
[47:32] and always remember
[47:34] that Jesus Christ is the winner and
[47:37] he'll always tell you the truth
[47:38] so if we want the truth we got to tell
[47:41] the truth we got to be the truth
[47:44] here why don't you read it off the board
[47:52] here
[47:55] well for reporting putting away lying
[48:00] speak every man truth with his neighbor
[48:04] before we all members one of another
[48:09] now let me ask the question who is it
[48:12] talking about
[48:14] in each other
[48:16] anybody
[48:18] hey don't do that
[48:21] it is talking about us now that we have
[48:23] heard the truth we can now say that we
[48:26] believe it and the word is speaking
[48:28] about us
[48:29] and that concludes our broadcast for
[48:31] tonight
