[Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] the bible he says in the appraising of his people humanitarian in the book of revelations amen let's get on to the lord jesus now why don't you turn and tell your neighbor turn and tell your neighbor i've been built by the hand of the lord amen glory gloria how many love the lord jesus tonight amen so our pastor called me and he says i want you to bring some fire and brimstone so if david one day all right we'll see if you're with me when i'm done let's open our scriptures real quick to deuteronomy 30 verse 14 verses when you have it you can say amen it says here but the word of the lord is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth and in thy heart and thou mayest do it verse 14 guys that's going to go to 15. see i have set before you this day life and good and the lord thy god shall bless thee in the land whether thou goes to possess it but if an indian heart turn away but shall be drawn away and worship other gods and serve them i denounce unto you this day that ye shall surely perish and that you shall not prolong your days upon the land no problem whether thou pass it over jordan to go to possess it on the vice passengers [Applause] that both thou and thy seed may live and you need to decide whom you're going to serve the bible says here as we just read before i have i have set before thee life and death that seems like a no-brainer right right nothing to think about right life but what are we going to choose tonight let's go over to first peter 5 chapter excuse me chapter 5 and we're going to read verse 6. starting with verse 6. and as you read in your bibles i'm going to be reading it to you from uh from uh another version alrighty so it's verse 6 versus says if you bow low in god's awesome presence he will eventually exalt you as you leave the timing in his hands and leave them there and leave them there for he always tenderly cares for you verse it says be well balanced and always alert because your enemy your brother i got it wrong be well balanced and alert because your enemy your sister says no no your enemy the church down the road [Applause] incessantly like a roaring lion looking for its prey to devour take a decisive stand against him and resist his every attack with strong vigorous faith now we just found out who our enemy is right is it your brother is it your sister no all right it's the devil now i want everybody to participate i oh how are we going to he's you must read your bible he lives in our house he is our compadre right but the bible says resist him you gotta resist christos or am i going to just let the day go by who's your enemy this morning right right who's our enemy now many false anointings shall arise muchos both anointings says many false christs and we're anointed every day you can be driving right but where is that anointing [Music] because we see jesus then when he was tempted of the devil here was jesus who was the world made flesh [Music] a plane no we don't break a plate right now we don't break a plate okay let's see if we don't break a plane may i drop this little thing here for you brother um if the devil can keep us separated he's got us shooting at one another so he's got an open target anywhere he wants to shoot he has an open target on blanco and what's the use of shooting equally so if you want to us but we want a blessing right and to get a blessing when a man has done you wrong and he has absolutely justly absolutely i mean he has done you wrong and you know that he's done you wrong he's done you evil you take him to prayer before god and take it away of just a selfish and don't take it in a way of just lord and not say well i'm supposed to do this but stand in the presence of our god our father praise our prayer should be and i don't see why he did it then let god go to talking to you and you'll see maybe what that man's been through the devil has twisted him up somewhere and caused him to do that [Music] no he's absolutely wrong okay before you leave before you leave the throne of god even if he's a rank sinner may let's see what that weapon can do it says now god knew this great warfare was coming on between right and wrong he wouldn't say i'll give him something here and a few years later given something different he said but if if they would have just stayed fortified then you'll take with the [Applause] but jesus said it is written in him back to the word what the bible says it was [Applause] determined [Applause] he gave you a bastard [Applause] is who knows how [Applause] it'll [Applause] foreign take decisive stand against him and resist his every attack with strong vigorous faith for you know that your believing brothers and sisters around the world are experiencing the same kind of trouble first peter chapter 5 verse 10. [Applause] take a decisive stand against him because you're brothers and sisters around the world are experiencing the same kind of trouble and then after your brief suffering the god of the god of all loving grace who has called you to share in his eternal glory his eternal glory christ [Music] he will set you firmly in place and build you up and he has all the power needed is [Applause] coming to you be sober [Applause] there my god [Applause] oh is john 6 35 17 and then this is in this passion version which i don't really like a lot of it but i like this and let's read it here in king
