to Hebrews 12 verse 1 and two and it reads like this wherefor seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God amen you may you all may be seated just going to be giving a a little report on our trip to Colombia we bring greetings from Brother Fabio and sister nudy from Brother Moses and sister chaoses CH from from all the youth that were that attended the camp they all send their greetings to each and every one of you the theme of the camp was looking unto Jesus and it was a great just a great blessing for me if you would put up the first picture of the youth group this there was around 45 youth that attended the camp and something that was really tremendous they had planned on uh doing a a bigger camp and things kind of fell through so they did it at the FAA of our brother Fabio and in that uh lot of the uh some of the youth decided that that they didn't want to go because it was a smaller Camp as you can see in the picture there's some tents they had to ttin it out but but the conditions for the ones that went it didn't matter what it was but they went to see Jesus they didn't complain about staying in tent they didn't complain about anything but they were there to see Jesus brother Moses was telling us about all the great testimonies that have come out of Thea about how many of the many of the brothers and sisters of Colombia had their first experience with the Lord there and for the youth that went that's what they wanted they wanted their experience with the Lord so that really impacted me because many times we want to we want to be a part of the big things I shouldn't say we but me we want to be a part of the big things but it's it's the small things there was maybe in total 60 people at the camp but we were all blessed beyond measure if you would uh put up the second picture it's of me and two of the brothers there the brother there on the left his name was uh brother Santiago he was a really awesome song me and him got along really well brother on the right that was brother M the Primo to brother Sammy and uh he was a very awesome guitar [Music] player uh probably one of the one of the best I've I've ever heard in my life honestly and uh so we got along very well all of course through music but just being able to share the word with them just being able to be with all these brothers and all the sisters there was just a really great blessing one of the one of the biggest impacts was on Sunday morning my my dad preached he preached on worship and on obedience and just to see the impact it had on the youth to it had an impact on me but after after he was done preaching he asked whoever needed something to come forth and it wasn't it's it was it was something so tremendous because it didn't it didn't uh the spirit of the Lord fell and it really didn't cause much emotion but what it did cause was a complete peace it was just a beautiful piece that went through the whole through the whole building that everybody felt it and it was just a peace and all we could do was just lift our hands praise the Lord some cried but it was just a complete peace I believe lives were changed and that's what we that's what the Lord what I believe the Lord had sent us to do of course it's nothing that we can do as human beings but it's the god that lives in each and every one us and he's the one that does the work amen we just have to let him use us let us be the vessel and I believe that lives were changed I know I can't come back the same it was it was truly a great blessing and if you would put up the last picture brothers and brother Fabio it was just a a pleasure to be able to talk with him to be with him to spend some time with him and I hope that this little report blesses you may God richly bless you amen God bless you this evening good to see all of you once again if we can open up our our Bibles to First Corinthians chapter 12 and verse 12 and once you have it if you can say amen amen amen it reads for as a body is one and ha many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ amen may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word I first I'd like to thank our pastor brother Caleb for the opportunity to to go on this trip may the Lord bless him there wherever he's at before leaving brother brother Caleb he he told me something that that really stuck with me he said there's no place will you where you will learn as much as in the missionary [Music] field and and that stuck with me throughout this trip and let me tell you that that's nothing but the truth there there's a few things I like to think uh speak about just about three things that that really stood out to me during this trip and the first thing is uh the the ministry of of our brother Fabio if they can put up that that first picture of that of the article it's it's a little bit small but a cousin of mine sent this to me while we were over there in in in Colombia and it's a it's it's an article of voice of restoration and this is uh I showed this to brother Fabio while I was over there and he told me it was it was one of the first times they went to Peru and then on this side you see brother brother Tommy senior as well so I thought that was so tremendous and and very fitting that you know while we were in Colombia they they found this article they were cleaning uh the her father-in-law's garage and um I just thought it was so fitting to to be in the land of of a man of brother Fabio to see the the beginnings of of of the ministry of a man of that [Music] kind while we were over there he he spoke to the young people and he he spoke to of us of of the first time the Lord spoke to him and it was it was there at at the at Thea at the farm and he was about five or six years old and you guys can start showing the pictures of the of the fina if you can just go through them while while I'm speaking and and he he was five or six years old he he was walking there uh around the FAA and brother faia told us he was meditating on on the death of his grandma and and he hears a voice that tells him what are you thinking what are you doing and he said he was so terrified to hear a voice just so powerful and so he he from then on he would go around the whole instead of that place where he wasid and so to see the beginnings of what God was going to do through a man to be a servant to the South American people to me that was it was something so special and he told us of the great blessings that that brother Ethan also mentioned it the blessings that people received there uh at that same FAA right throughout the years uh there was many that had their first first encounter with the Lord there uh ministers that they had their first initiation there marriages that came out of there I remember him telling the youth he said if you don't find a girlfriend here you'll never find a girlfriend so it's now or never keep your eyes open so that that was it was something just so special to me just to see the the life of of brother Fabio to see the beginnings of of where he was raised in that in that city of sesa it's not a city it's more of a little a little town and the second thing was was the youth and they can start putting the pictures of of the young people there but let me tell you they are they are something to admire they dedication to this Camp it it was impressive they were planning their own activities and lots of effort that they put into the camp something that caught my eye that you know it may be a small detail but I I thought it was it was really cool that when they were finished eating they would go and they would wash their own plate it's the small things just the the the lessons that you learn and that you that they teach the young people and they all went with expectation right those that wanted to be there they they received the blessing and you could tell the expectation that they went with not because they would tell you about it but in their actions right they went to receive and I believe that each and every one of them received something from the Lord and if you can put that next picture with with brother brother moel brother moo he's a he's a very good friend of mine when he uh when he greeted me for the first time the first time I had ever met him he said I feel like I've met I've known you my whole life and I told them and I told them I feel the same and let me tell you it's true right just having met another part of of the Bride of Jesus Christ and to know that they're part of the same body the same body that you are a part of and all we were doing was just meeting each other for the first time in the flesh right so I think God for allowing me to to make new friends and not only new friends but people that you'll spend eternity with yeah it was so nice just uh to speak to to moo and he he told me a little bit of his life story and and it's it's something so beautiful just to speak to people and to to see another side uh another part of the world that they're going through things that you may may be going through and the third thing the last thing that I that really caught my attention while while we were over there is that as as brother Caleb so put it so well he said you know we're we're not a team but we're one body and if you could put that last picture there with brother fa is the same picture that brother used but while we were while we were over there I I just saw how God was using the body in in in distinct ways whenever one was [Music] needed then they would step in and a lot of the times it wasn't the way that I expected but it was just how God wanted to use each one of us in at that time and it was just so wonderful to see God operate through through each gift and each one of the men that went and not only that but to see this part of the body here and go and Unite with the part of the body that's over there in Colombia working alongside with with brother Moses over there and and the youth leader there brother Diego I believe the the deacons that were present it was it was simply God working through his body here on Earth so it was it was something so tremendous to to see that and I just learned so much on this trip [Music] it was it was an experience of a lifetime I could say and in closing I I just like to thank all the people of Colombia that they were all so kind to us most especially brother Fabio and sister nudy brother Moses sister Chelsea they were so mindful of us the whole time I think I gained maybe 10 pounds while I was over there and I think I lost it because I got sick on the way back but nevertheless we thank God for allowing us to make it back Sav it's all worth it whether you know rain or it's uh sun or rain if you're sick or in health no whatever it is I think it's our purpose to serve the Lord we are one body and and we were made to serve so I hope this was of a blessing to you God bless you [Applause] amen may God richly bless you it's surely a privilege to be back here tonight I missed you all very much uh let us open up the scripture uh you all heard uh the scripture and the theme looking un Jesus but there was something that um my uncle will hit a little touched on and it's found in Acts chapter 2 verse 38 the Bible says then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remissions of sins and he shall give you the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call I started thinking about uh when I going on this trip you know it's kind of funny uh last time I spoke on a report and I did say you know whenever the Lord needs me I I'll be there you know and sure enough brother Caleb was I think he paid attention to that and he was like hey did I ever talk to you about going to colia he's like well he's how many days you got left you know you know and I'm like oh okay I think I have one day and uh you know let's let's do it let's do it you know you know let's work it out you know and in my heart I I just want to be obedient something that uh brother will touched on so heavily in the worship that you give to the Lord you know no excuses on my part the time I want to give to the Lord and uh I started thinking about this for the promis is unto you I as I talking to my boss and trying to explain to them why we're going to Colombia I start realizing like how long ago the friendship was was made and you can take it even further back than that that before the foundation of the world there was a special connection between our brother faio and our and our founding pastor and it starts making me think you know what drives these men to do what they do what moves them and the word I come down to is is is love am it was so beautiful to see and experience such great love I I surely did feel my grandfather down there and as we talked to brother fabiio we laughed a lot and he shared so many things and just reminds me of my grandpa and the love doesn't stop it continues you know um the love that he and sister nudy has shown us man they you know they want you to eat to all the Colombians you have very wonderful food especially the avocados maybe brother or sister Erica I uh I gave you the pictures in the wrong order but maybe you can the avocado wonderful right it's just out of this world and then they took us and fed us more and it's the love they show for you right and for me I'm like no let me like I I want to pay for that or let me do this you know and the great friend that I have in brother and brother Moses they're like no no no no you're our guest let me help you do something no just you've done enough and I and I remember what our pastor has told me say all you have to do all you have to worry about is have a good time because many times I'm worried about things not getting planned so I did have a very one wonderful time let's go to the first picture I wanted to show you the men there and that was one of the those are our special Brothers there I shared enjoyed very all of them my broken English they looked far past that oh I'm sorry there thank you brother Jim my my span yeah my Spanish too you know both both of them and uh so this was uh looking unto Jesus Mir looking onto Jesus and you see a young man there a young lady and they're there at the cross and I thought that was very fitting you know hopefully I didn't hurt the men there too much that I didn't kind of confuse the men too much because the first thing I talked about was that we need to look to Jesus and not look to Mary yet you know but many had a limited time you know so they had to do you know but you can tell that how much they love the Lord and how much they love to be around each other something that you don't have to force you know put them there in the camp and and naturally happens and I I I told them that I believe my purpose in life for the young people of God not so much just the young people that are here anyone that I can come encounter with if you go to the next few pictures um I did admire this it's a box of cell phones and uh well they uh they took all the cell phones from the youth they put them in this box so they had no choice but to fellowship if you go to the next photos here's where they were uh they were passing around um little object and wherever it would stop go and introduce themselves and so just little things like that like I I just love to be a part about part of it maybe kind of hard to see but the the person on my right it's like man that looks like Mark you know anyways I guess I just miss Mark a lot we kind of saw a little bit of everybody over there you know it's kind of thought we were in Columbia I guess we brought Les crues here but of course I come back and like I thought I left Colombia but I see a lot of Colombians here if you go to the next few pictures that was one of my I guess our team so uh I guess apparently uh some of the young people over there maybe not married they're around my age so when I was introducing myself to the team her sister Chelsea was interpreting me which is kind of funny right anyway so I was like well I'm telling I'm I'm 33 and they're like you're a youth right and I'm like I got kids you know wife you know and they're like oh but I I pray that it was a that I could have been a blessing to them just being in their midst uh they were such a blessing to me again just great love that I felt the the things that they were looking for I believe they received them and we wanted to give them every opportunity that they could have their own experience with the Lord and in turn I had my own experience with the Lord it was very wonderful wonderful that service on Sunday it just felt felt such a peace with the Lord you can go to the next few photos sure we're all done but there's there's just it Colombia is beautiful what a beautiful place thing that makes Colombia beautiful is the people that live there it's the children of God that God created the Earth for see brother Ethan and brother Noah and I just very proud of proud of the young people I went with you too Uncle will it's just a pleasure when you go with these men and even though I'm related to them I see brother Noah all the time you get to really have some good talks with them and I learned so much about brother Noah I think he's probably interpret for most of the message most of the people in the message but I'll leave you with this all right um because I think brother Noah kind of found this a little funny and a little shocked I actually knew some Spanish right he was kind of giggling a lot so but I just want to say give peace from the Lord oh give a give [Applause] an give a hand to the Lord God bless you God bless you all What a Wonder wonderful reports that uh God is still working no matter where you're at in the world there's no place that God cannot reach uh and his uh his uh his love is uh is so tremendous and thank brother Caleb for uh for the opportunity to go and uh just be a part of uh this camp that was uh that was in the beginning was supposed to be this really big a lot of people there and different things transpired but it was exactly how God wanted it to be you know we we don't look for for numbers you know it was uh to be in a in in a camp where there was I think there was like 46 youth but every one of those youth that were there they wanted to be there they strived to be there and for that it was uh it was it was wonderful I I was really really proud of brother Seth brother Noah eth you know as I get older it's it it's it's really weird it's really weird being the old guy it's weird because all through since I've been on the missionary field I've been uh one of the youngest if not the youngest everywhere we go so it's it it's it's it's it was a strange feeling for me but it was uh it it it's wonderful to be around such wonderful uh young men um it bring it makes you feel a little bit young you know but um we were uh we were speaking with brother Fabio as he was as you had heard he he was just sharing stories after stories of him and my dad um when they met and it was so important because I've I've known those stories my whole life to hear but to but to but for those stories for for my son for Ethan for Seth and uh and uh and Noah to to hear those stories as well it's it's V and it's important to to understand where we come from you know we see uh everyone wants to uh you know the young people it seems like sometimes they don't they they just want to uh they just want to focus on what's going on now but it's important to realize where we have come from I was speaking to the young people on Friday night I was just uh we were just talking by the uh talking there and as I was I was I was explaining to them I said we don't have to we don't have to uh reinvent the wheel so many so many times we we want to get new new doctrines or new new things and and I told him it's like U it's like a man going through a jungle and he has a he has a machete in his hand and he's he's there clearing the the branches he he's just clearing all the grass whatever whatever is in front of him he's clearing and I said that's what brother fabiio has done since he started he is he he has cleared the path our founding p uh Pastor has cleared the path that's not our job our job is not to have the machete in her hand and trying to to to make another path that is not what we have to do all that we have to do is take what the these men have sacrificed had had such a burden for for so many years and take it and run run with this message go down the path that they've created and that's all that we have to do we don't have to create another path we'd be outside of the will of God but it takes me to it takes me to this the Lord has been he he he uh he's been dealing with me uh on on this here you know we have brother Moses what are what what do the young people what do they what do they uh what do they need or what are what are they struggling with he said they're struggling to to find their purpose they're struggling to answer their why why am I here why am I a part of this why why why but if we took uh if we uh go in the Bible in the book of Isaiah 43:7 it simply reads like this even everyone that is called by my name for I have created him for my glory I have formed him yay I have made him Ephesians 1 5 and 6 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the of the glory of his grace wherein he ha made us accepted and the Beloved you know young people are are searching for for their why for their purpose in this life and it and it brings me to this I've never been good at math whatsoever I'm not like brother sayth brother sayth you you give him something and Bumm I I am definitely not even remotely in the h hemisphere where he's at Galaxy where he's at but but I want you to to to uh to focus on this just for a few minutes in order us for in order in order for us to be born we needed a few things right we needed two parents okay see everyone everyone in agreement we needed four grandparents we needed eight great grandparents we needed 16 second great grandparents we needed 64 fourth great grandparents we needed 128 fifth great grandparents we did 256 sixth great grandparents we needed 512 seventh great grandparents we needed 1,24 eth great [Music] grandparents we needed 248 nth great grandparents if you go back 12 Generations in order for you to be here today it took 4,094 of your ancestors for you to be here sitting in the today think about it think about the battles they went through think about the struggles that they all went through for you to have the opportunity in 2024 to be able to hear what God is doing in your in your time to be able to accept a message that is true that is right that is correct in this day 494 people and we wonder why what's our purpose why why am I here this does away with all your wise because God has a purpose he has a plan his plan is perfect imagine what they all went through I I hear stories of just my grandfather how they found him on the border my my my my grandpa Pedro they found him in the Border almost almost dead how he got Shipwrecked on off the coast of Norway that's just one of the stories for me to be here today we can't take things like that for granted we can't let a moment pass by and say well that that's that that's just life and and we don't care about care about things anymore but it's it's so important if we can look back a lot of people say well we don't you know I don't look at the past no I think we do need to look at the past because if we don't realize the mistakes that we've done in the past we are going to we are going to repeat them in the future if we don't look at the past and see where we've come from we never know where we're going we'll never know we'll never know what what what the previous generations did for us you know when we were out in colia you know there's there's there's something special for me whenever I go out in the missionary field I feel my dad like I like like it it's so strong I feel him just just saying go just keep on going keep on going that's what I told the young people on Sunday morning I said what the message that brother Favio everything that he's done for the for the country of colia everything that he's done for South America all he's done around the world it cannot stop with him it doesn't stop with him now you have now you have the Next Generation cannot stop with them and now it's the youth what are we going to do do are we just going to look at at or or or hear the stories of brother fabiio of brother Tommy said those were nice oh those are oh great stories and that's all as Generations go on that's all that they've become is just oh that was that was nice that was great it's all just become stories it's all become maybe mythical now oh there there's you can't do that anymore that can't be done oh those were in in those times we live in different times there's there there's the saying wow that's just the way that the times are now no it's not just the way the times are now you know times times don't change right the times don't change people change times don't change people change and what this with this trip has has made me realize even more is that the need to continue is even greater I look at my my sons I should say I look at myself and I said Lord can't stop with me can't stop with me I look at my I look at my sons I said I said guys can't stop with you can't the work that the work that brother faio my dad did it work that'll never be in vain it'll never be in vain why because there's a body there's a body here there's a body there in colia that is striving each and every day as hard as life gets as much as as as Satan wants to take down each person oh but there's a body you know you know when I was there there brother fabiio says he's thank you for giving us strength thank you for giving our young people strength I told Brother fa I said thank you for giving me strength because when I see a man that's that's that's that's 80 years old still going in front of his youth is just talking about how how great God is I said man I I've I've still got a lot to learn I've still got a lot to do by the grace of God we still have a lot to do we don't have a lot of time we don't have years and years and years to go what what what uh what has been preached are things that we need to get fast things that we need to understand quickly we don't have all the time in the world you know brother brother fa's he's one of the funniest people I've ever been around you know I I I always remember him and my dad you want to hear two guys just just crack up with each other it was them to me brother Fabi he's like the king of the onliners he's he has on liners everything you know he told us said you know the climate here Ina and says it's like Le what it's neither hot nor cold so man he just I mean it's one after another with with brother Fabio but you know it's things that we that we appreciate so much is the love of the Colombian people you know that the youth asked me what's it like in crues said well it's colia north and and the reason why it's that way because over 40 years ago there was two men that took God out his word and didn't care about what any what anyone else said about them they just just loved God they loved each other and that's why we can go down there total confidence knowing that that that's our that's our family that's that's whom we love because we because of two men that that really that paved the way for us amen so thank you once again for your prayers thank you thank you uh Pastor for the vision that you have for for the
