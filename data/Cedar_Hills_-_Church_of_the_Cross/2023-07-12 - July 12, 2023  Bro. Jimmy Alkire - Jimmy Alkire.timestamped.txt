[10:37] and we have a hard time recognizing is
[10:43] knowing when that Supernatural part of

[11:39] praise the Lord our subject today is the
[11:43] groaning creature is
[11:51] [Music]
[11:53] let's start in our scripture with verse
[11:56] uh starting at chapter 19.
[12:01] of Psalms
[12:04] and verse 7 through 12.
[12:08] what time it is I've already been up
[12:10] here three minutes amen
[12:16] Allah the Lord is perfect converting the
[12:19] soul
[12:20] the testimony of the Lord is sure making
[12:24] wives the simple the lady who was
[12:27] perfect
[12:35] the statues of the Lord are right
[12:36] rejoice in the heart
[12:39] amen
[12:42] the Commandments the heart Rejoice
[12:48] I don't want to talk about that
[12:51] makes the heart Rejoice maybe not your
[12:54] flesh but your heart
[12:58] Commandments of the Lord are pure
[13:00] enlightening the eyes
[13:04] the fear of the Lord is clean enduring
[13:07] forever the judgments of the Lord are
[13:10] true and righteous all together
[13:18] more to be desired are they than gold
[13:21] yay than much fine gold sweeter also
[13:24] than honey and the honeycomb established
[13:35] moreover by them your servant
[13:38] your servant warned and then keeping of
[13:41] them there is great rewards
[13:49] who can understand his errors
[13:55] who can understand in other words the
[13:57] mistakes you make
[14:00] I say you I'm talking about I'm talking
[14:03] about everybody right
[14:05] how many
[14:07] understand the mistakes you make us
[14:12] and why you make those mistakes
[14:15] and even though many times after you
[14:18] already know that it's wrong to do it
[14:22] and I'm not talking about adultery or or
[14:26] witchcraft or rock and roll music I'm
[14:30] just talking about just their everyday
[14:31] walk with God
[14:36] it's just these little things that make
[14:39] us get in the flesh is
[14:43] just not conscience of his presence
[14:48] no wonder we make mistakes
[14:51] how many make mistakes
[14:56] man a lot of young people don't make
[14:57] mistakes
[14:59] well maybe I better sit down
[15:05] yes hello amen
[15:07] watch this then this last part of the
[15:09] verse really gets me is
[15:14] cleanse
[15:16] thou me from Secret quotes
[15:20] by Secrets
[15:24] Lord there's things that I'm doing and I
[15:27] don't even realize that I'm doing them
[15:28] and they're they're wrong
[15:33] but they're hidden to me why I do them
[15:38] Lord Jesus we just thank you for your
[15:40] word Lord
[15:44] you bless your Holy Name Lord
[15:47] just to feel that presence
[15:50] yes your children have come and
[15:53] worshiped you and created that
[15:54] atmosphere where you can move and Speak
[15:57] Lord
[16:01] and move Lord Jesus we just thank you
[16:04] Lord
[16:05] God bless your children
[16:10] may there be brutal Hearts ready to
[16:12] receive it Lord
[16:15] we ask all these things in the precious
[16:18] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[16:22] you may be seated
[16:27] you know
[16:28] the Holy Spirit has been speaking really
[16:30] tremendous to us lately right
[16:33] ultimate and a few Services back when
[16:36] the our pastor under the anointing of
[16:39] the Holy Spirit
[16:42] he said wholeness is entering in the
[16:45] church
[16:48] well when he says colonist centers in
[16:50] church I'm not turning and looking at
[16:52] you
[16:56] I'm not looking at nobody else
[16:59] I'm looking at myself in the mirror of
[17:02] God's word
[17:04] and I believe all of us should do that
[17:08] and so I asked the Lord Lord show me
[17:10] something that will help your children
[17:12] to realize what is allowing this
[17:16] coldness to hit them
[17:22] when it hits you and you you seem like
[17:25] you're funny and then all of a sudden
[17:26] you just
[17:31] and you just get these weird thoughts
[17:33] and desires and things like when you go
[17:35] what in the world
[17:41] what's wrong with me
[17:46] you know make it as simple as simple as
[17:48] we can
[17:50] now let's go to our next scripture
[17:55] Psalms 37
[18:01] and we know this in many of us why don't
[18:03] we just read it together
[18:06] Psalms 37 4.
[18:10] now break it up Delight thyself also in
[18:14] the Lord
[18:21] and he shall give Thee the desires of
[18:24] thine heart yes
[18:26] petition is
[18:32] now notice how it says in Spanish it
[18:34] calls it petitions nothing
[18:41] oh if I Delight myself in the Lord and I
[18:44] praise the Lord and is
[18:47] the desires I have God's Gonna fulfill
[18:51] them
[18:53] well I can say yes to a certain degree
[18:59] but the whole key of this is if you
[19:02] delight yourself in the Lord
[19:07] he will give you the desires
[19:29] so how many want God to put those
[19:32] desires
[19:35] how many when you repented and got
[19:37] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[19:39] Jesus
[19:44] all of a sudden you started you know I
[19:47] don't think I should do this anymore
[19:51] you had a sense of morality
[19:55] you had a sense that does this please
[19:57] God or not
[20:00] you didn't have that before
[20:03] but you've been justified
[20:08] by the Precious Blood of the Lord Jesus
[20:12] but at the same time
[20:18] the desires of the flesh the pride of
[20:22] life
[20:24] the pride of the eyes the desires
[20:29] they're still new
[20:32] but this new desire has been born in you
[20:36] so now you have multiple kind of desires
[20:43] you know how
[20:46] Satan calls you off
[20:50] remember I got three points
[20:54] he short circuits the real desire
[20:58] foreign
[22:15] when the spirit of the world
[22:18] begins to attack you
[22:21] it finds no place in you anymore
[22:25] because that desire inside
[22:30] it's gonna shake it off
[22:35] the gym we know all this
[22:38] oh yeah we do
[22:53] amen praise the Lord Jesus
[22:55] now let's go to our next scripture in
[22:59] Isaiah 26.
[23:03] verses seven through nine
[23:07] ve amen
[23:10] how many love God's word
[23:15] the way of the just is uprightness
[23:21] thou almost upright
[23:25] just weigh the path of the justice
[23:31] the just shall live by faith
[23:36] you're living by faith
[23:40] El PESA he says
[23:43] he knows how much he can depend on us
[23:48] and he desires to depend on us and in
[23:51] totality and this is
[23:55] and the purpose that he created US
[23:58] foreign
[24:09] because in that way that you're walking
[24:15] there's so many things that come
[24:18] they want to deviate you from the past
[24:22] so he's constantly waiting he's
[24:25] constantly balancing you out
[24:29] how many are thankful for that
[24:32] I've only been at this a few years
[24:37] because sometimes the years really don't
[24:39] mean that much
[24:42] you could be here 40 50 years and still
[24:44] just barely you'd be getting to the New
[24:46] Birth
[24:50] hey you get the new birth that's the
[24:52] main thing right
[24:55] but the Lord's not coming for a baby
[24:58] girl
[25:00] coming for a mature
[25:04] if you're born you're saying
[25:07] but unless you come to Ocho
[25:25] yea in the way of thy judgments the Lord
[25:28] have we waited for thee meaning
[25:34] the desire of our soul is to thy name is
[25:44] oh my goodness oh the soul has one
[25:48] desire
[25:50] and that desire is done to thy name yes
[26:06] so
[26:17] has that desire unto his name
[26:21] and to the remembrance of him
[26:24] why remembering him
[26:27] because we are the foreign
[26:41] how are we not going to enjoy when we
[26:43] hear his name spoken
[26:46] under the anointing of the Holy ghosts
[26:51] that soul is shouting to you
[26:54] but when the enemy short circuits that
[26:58] desire
[27:02] never comes from here
[27:05] to here okay
[27:09] and you start getting cold you stay safe
[27:11] and then you feel bad
[27:13] I remember when I was a little baptist
[27:16] boy
[27:18] we had a custom
[27:21] we had a customer or tradition
[27:24] are rededicating your life
[27:27] the only thing is I did it every month
[27:33] because I didn't have no new birth
[27:35] I didn't really understand myself
[27:39] I didn't understand what God was trying
[27:42] to do with my soul
[27:45] I had never heard his name
[27:48] is
[28:01] that I was with him
[28:05] on the banner of Eternity
[28:08] when he asked me
[28:10] when he asked you
[28:13] what age would you like to live in yeah
[28:19] what age would you like to live in he
[28:23] goes this is the most glorious times
[28:28] the history of mankind and Historia
[28:35] amen amen
[28:38] now we're going to jump to Genesis 2 7.
[28:43] the surprise popcorn began
[28:56] okay
[28:58] Genesis 2 7 for me up there please there
[29:01] it is
[29:03] and I'm gonna stop
[29:07] every time there's something important
[29:10] even if it's one letter
[29:13] that's one cup
[29:15] because all those things
[29:18] means something significant but here's
[29:21] the way we read it
[29:23] the Lord God formed Man Out of the Dust
[29:25] of the ground
[29:28] and God within two's nostrils the Breath
[29:30] of Life
[29:36] push button instant Cream of Wheat
[29:42] la cremita
[29:44] or
[29:46] Novena yeah
[29:50] it all happened just instantaneous
[29:55] no no
[29:58] the prophet taught us to read the Bible
[30:03] and the Lord God brother Danny the Lord
[30:05] God someone says
[30:08] that's incredible stuff and the Lord God
[30:11] formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground
[30:14] foreign
[30:22] tempo
[30:32] so here's this man he's pointing out of
[30:34] the Dust of the ground
[30:37] first question is is he alive yet
[30:42] is he walking around yet
[30:47] anybody and even if you say something it
[30:50] seems like the wrong answer it's not
[30:51] yeah
[30:53] you just are learning how to read the
[30:56] Bible the way the message
[31:00] so time goes by and
[31:04] breathe into his nostrils the Breath of
[31:07] Life
[31:09] time went by
[31:11] there's a conjunction
[31:13] which means he's going to connect one
[31:16] thing with the other
[31:18] and when he connects this one thing with
[31:20] the others
[31:24] and he's not supposed the Breath of Life
[31:33] more time
[31:34] ask them
[31:36] okay okay and the first part of the
[31:39] verse where God formed him from the dust
[31:40] to the ground foreign
[31:52] okay
[31:54] I won't torture you too much I'm not
[31:56] trying to do that
[31:57] give us the quote out of the
[32:00] blasphemian's names
[32:06] now they take the scripture
[32:10] and God breathed breath into his
[32:12] nostrils and he became a living Souls
[32:18] no I want to ask you something
[32:21] if he was a man
[32:24] what kind of breath was he breathing
[32:28] before God breathes his breath of life
[32:35] see Ben what kind of breath
[32:39] he was breathing
[32:43] foreign
[33:13] man but then when God brother Brown says
[33:16] if you read this message
[33:25] like the Jehovah's Witnesses
[33:35] the breath you breathe every day just to
[33:37] live as a human
[33:39] man not that no esto he said it was the
[33:44] breath of eternal life came into him
[33:48] and what inside of his soul
[33:56] now he has one desire
[34:01] man
[34:02] let's go back to the quick let's go back
[34:04] to the quiz
[34:06] who was the first one to speak to him
[34:10] once his soul was quick
[34:15] anybody
[34:19] come on that's a that's the easiest one
[34:21] I've asked so far
[34:23] oh God yours oh yeah God would come
[34:26] walking in the garden
[34:29] and here's Adam
[34:31] he comes up out of the earth President
[34:33] says his toes or his roots
[34:41] he's like a tree
[34:44] he was a tree
[34:47] of Life yeah he puts his feet out of the
[34:51] ground he is
[34:53] walking around
[34:56] and then the voice of God comes walking
[34:58] in the garden
[35:00] in the call of the evening
[35:05] he had never heard anybody speaks
[35:09] I don't personally think he even knew
[35:16] he was The Man Child
[35:19] I won't go there
[35:22] right he was dementia
[35:25] so he hears God speak
[35:28] the holy spirit is in his soul
[35:32] he has one desire
[35:34] the only thing that he hears
[35:37] when God speaks to him
[35:41] every day on the call of the evening
[35:48] and that's the way it's got to be with
[35:50] you when you are born
[35:56] quickens your soul
[35:59] then your soul comes alive
[36:03] it's got to be God speaking to you first
[36:08] I feel for everything else
[36:14] got it
[36:16] okay who was the second one to talk to
[36:19] him
[36:24] Amos who's the second one Segundo
[36:30] you buddy again you remember if you say
[36:33] something it's not exactly you're not
[36:35] wrong
[36:38] you're wrong right
[36:41] because you desire to do what's right
[36:50] this is where even theologians in the
[36:52] message
[37:12] now in the creation he was the last one
[37:15] created on the sixth day
[37:21] because he was the crown
[37:24] and the crowning of the creation
[37:30] he was going to have dominion over the
[37:33] Earth who
[37:36] what species was created right before
[37:38] Adam was created in this in the first in
[37:41] the Six States especially foreign
[37:55] of the field
[37:58] beast of the field
[38:00] which includes that animal that we now
[38:03] call the surf
[38:05] remember he wasn't the serpent yet
[38:09] because Lucifer had not got into him yet
[38:14] this is
[38:20] lotenia
[38:44] he had a nature of the spirit of Soul
[38:47] spiritual Alma God said okay this guy
[38:51] thinks he's so sure
[38:55] I had things in the back of my mind
[39:01] this animal I made it specially just for
[39:04] him
[39:06] and I'm gonna alert him
[39:09] to get into this animal
[39:12] and turn him into a
[39:15] serpenters
[39:18] I can do like what brother Tommy said
[39:22] it comes to negotiate with this Beast
[39:27] you know if you just let me take control
[39:29] of you
[39:30] you see how Adam does all these
[39:33] tremendous things
[39:36] how he can speak in the Rocks moving
[39:41] you can do the same thing so yeah
[39:55] and he enthroned himself in that animal
[39:57] he said
[39:59] and Moses under the inspiration of the
[40:02] Holy Spirit
[40:04] looking back through before
[40:08] that's the serpents
[40:11] that's Lucifer
[40:13] Revelation says
[40:17] he's been working over 6 000 some odd
[40:20] years
[40:22] he's a professional at what he does
[40:26] amen amen and he approaches Adam
[40:32] is
[41:11] no she's in him
[41:14] it's that Beast it's a baby that's the
[41:17] missing link
[41:19] now the evolution starts going down from
[41:21] the highest order
[41:25] all the way back to the lowest order
[41:31] don't have time to go into but it's
[41:33] engine and read the whole chapter of
[41:34] Genesis amen
[41:39] so who was the second one to talk to him
[41:43] once he was going to try to make him
[41:45] fall um
[41:48] but before that
[41:50] Adam would go in and talk with God
[41:55] and I personally don't think that that
[41:57] animal could go with him when he went
[41:59] into that place
[42:04] is
[42:10] a big old giant of a pillow about 10
[42:13] feet tall
[42:14] [Music]
[42:17] he wanted to know what God said
[42:21] sometimes I don't like share a few
[42:23] things with him
[42:25] this atom is tremendous
[42:31] hey
[42:32] so they had they were bodies as brother
[42:35] Tommy would say
[42:40] but there was no wrong desire
[42:43] they say open correct there was nothing
[42:45] out of cater no Aviana

[52:10] God has given us the promise
[52:14] my whole desire
[52:18] is to be like him
[52:22] no these are the desires that distracted

[54:01] next guy is going to show up three
[54:02] seconds
[54:09] praise the Living God
[54:11] Romans 8 real quick
[54:22] for I reckon that the suffering of this
[54:25] present time are not worthy to be
[54:26] compared with the glory which shall be
[54:28] revealed in US
[54:41] why
[54:43] because the world don't understand us
[54:49] amen they're never going to understand
[54:51] us
[54:52] don't even expect them to this
[54:55] you'll be constantly disappointed sooner
[54:58] or later
[55:01] you can't even compare what you're going
[55:04] through right now
[55:07] with the glory that's being revealed in
[55:11] us
[55:14] next verse 19.
[55:17] for the earnest expectation of the
[55:21] creatures
[55:24] in Spanish it says creation
[55:28] and English it says
[55:35] yes and no see you know
[55:38] because the Christian refers to
[55:40] Something in its early development
[55:45] it's been formed estacion this creatures
[55:50] being formed
[55:52] oh yeah it's a creation
[55:55] but it's not complete
[55:57] it's a creature
[56:01] the earnest expectation it says in
[56:04] Spanish
[56:06] the burning desire of the creature
[56:13] the Greek word says
[56:15] with great anticipation Grand
[56:18] anticipation
[56:20] because that desire has come forth
[56:23] It's produced in the Tree of Life
[56:29] creature waited for the manifestation of
[56:32] the sons of God is
[56:43] it's already been so long yes
[56:46] well that is not what that means there
[56:49] no it's located
[56:50] in the Greek it means
[56:53] it's fully
[56:55] expecting it to happen
[56:59] looking forward to happen is
[57:03] it's gonna happen
[57:05] because that burning desires
[57:08] once that comes to life to you
[57:13] you'll never did the same again
[57:16] even if you want to go back
[57:22] even if you want to go back
[57:24] it's not gonna let you know
[57:29] they're gonna give you such a strong
[57:31] desire
[57:33] coldness won't even get close to you
[57:37] it's afraid it's going to turn into five
[57:42] next verse
[57:52] no
[58:07] foreign
[58:46] agamos make
[58:49] make memory in our image
[58:53] my time's up I can't I can't continue

[59:11] life
[59:13] you're gonna have to fight against
[59:15] planet in your whole life
[59:20] he'd just do that and leave you without
[59:22] help
[59:25] he says subject to penalty not
[59:27] willingness
[59:37] not a hope I hope this happened
[59:42] but the Hope was
[59:45] perfect sacrifices
[59:54] and they would raise to the life again
[59:59] that creature that began to form in this
[1:00:02] creation is
[1:00:05] Gonna Come into full view now
[1:00:09] foreign
[1:00:19] because the
[1:00:29] the creature itself
[1:00:31] point to yourself
[1:00:34] the creature itself
[1:00:38] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[1:00:41] corruption
[1:00:43] in the Glorious Liberty of the children
[1:00:48] oh my goodness oh for we know that the
[1:00:51] whole creation uses the word creation
[1:00:56] that means everything that God
[1:01:03] is the planets
