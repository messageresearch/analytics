[46:22] you speak espanol
[46:29] all right the only thing that the doctor
[46:31] in medicine can do is aid
[46:34] the only healer
[46:37] that there ever was in the history of
[46:38] the world
[46:40] is
[46:42] [Music]
[46:43] you must go to sunday school
[46:46] they teach you good
[46:48] praise god
[46:54] did you know that little billy
[46:56] little bill little bill
[46:58] no bill
[47:01] come on
[47:04] yeah you lucky i'm wearing a belt
[47:07] you supposed to be at example
[47:09] you teach them best best stuff
[47:11] yeah
[47:13] okay
[47:14] i'll give you a break
[47:15] okay
[47:18] how many here has the lord healed
[47:24] okay i guess you you you you never been
[47:27] sick you never been hurt
[47:29] you you
[47:32] okay
[47:34] we might go home because
[47:36] there's a lot of perfect people here
[47:39] we got
[47:40] maybe we did something bad
[47:44] you want me to tell you what happens
[47:46] every time you get sick
[47:48] every time you
[47:49] something kind of bad happens to you
[47:52] because god's trying to get your
[47:53] attention from something
[47:56] you see a headache
[47:58] and sickness only points to something
[48:01] yes
[48:02] you see the lord is gentleman god's a
[48:04] gentleman
[48:05] he won't force you to do nothing but he
[48:07] got ways of bringing you to your knees
[48:13] so make sure you put the first
[48:16] in first
[48:18] make sure you put god
[48:20] first and everything
[48:22] because if you forget
[48:24] he's going to remind you
[48:27] you know what's going to happen
[48:30] you have to put one of these on
[48:34] it's gonna hurt one and take it off
[48:39] so god's a healer right
[48:43] billy had a big gas right here
[48:48] let's see what happened
[48:52] sure everybody was there
[48:56] you know why
[48:58] the guy's a healer
[49:01] the only thing that medicine can do is
[49:02] aid the help of god but
[49:04] god
[49:06] is
[49:07] the cure
[49:14] so if you put
[49:16] all these things before god
[49:18] you can get in trouble
[49:24] yeah
[49:25] i know it
[49:27] you getting trouble up
[49:29] better put them first you get more
[49:31] trouble
[49:34] you understand what i'm saying little
[49:36] kids
[49:36] big kids
[49:38] weird kids

[50:26] you'll heal any you know any sickness
[50:29] that you'll ever have from right now to
[50:31] the end of your life
[50:32] the healing power already lies
[50:36] inside of you yes
