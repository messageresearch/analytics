[16:25] guys let's give each other a round of
[16:26] applause as Aaron as brother Aaron comes
[16:30] on out god bless you guys
[16:31] [Applause]
[16:47] how did you all get in my lab you have
[16:53] to have special access to get in my lab
[16:55] what's going on here
[16:57] I need some answers now how did you get
[17:02] in my lab anybody it was open I was in
[17:11] the back and I just heard this singing
[17:12] of some children so I thought I'd come
[17:15] in to see what it was all about so you
[17:16] see my time machine it broke out I was
[17:19] on my way to see a miracle being done
[17:22] but I did not make it so I guess what
[17:29] you all like to help me we're going to
[17:33] be some time travelers today is that
[17:35] okay who wants to time travel anybody
[17:41] we're going to see the first miracle
[17:44] that Jesus ever did who can tell me that
[17:48] miracle speak you're a very smart little
[17:55] lad very smart very wise yes yes okay so
[18:03] who can tell me what a miracle is Wow
[18:11] straight from the dictionary stand up
[18:14] and share speak into my mic tell
[18:20] everybody I supernatural work of God
[18:23] that's right and so what we're going to
[18:27] do is I could show you but I probably
[18:30] blow my face off because I'm not
[18:32] actually I went to Vista college I'm not
[18:35] really certified so we're going to go
[18:40] straight to the source is that okay so a
[18:44] miracle is something you're creating
[18:48] something that did not exist before and
[18:51] we're going to go to the very greatest
[18:53] source that I know of I've worked in the
[18:56] laboratory of God for many years and
[18:58] I've got this in gray
[18:59] miracles and I've tried to replicate
[19:04] them but they didn't go too well so my
[19:07] greatest experience is time traveling
[19:09] and as I go to the time travel I
[19:11] experience and I get to see and I meet
[19:13] new people and I'm able to go back and
[19:15] forth and I it's just a great time so
[19:18] what we're gonna do is we're going to go
[19:21] on my time machine I don't know if it's
[19:23] going to work or not it takes faith to
[19:25] activate it
[19:26] anybody have faith okay oh great because
[19:29] we're gonna need it all because my faith
[19:32] meter for some reason it didn't work and
[19:35] so we're going to put our faith in
[19:37] action and we're going to get in this
[19:39] great time machine and we're going to
[19:40] travel back to a wedding so we got to
[19:44] get dressed
[19:44] you all look okay but in that day they
[19:49] weren't dressed like your dress today
[19:50] they're probably laughing and we don't
[19:52] want that so we're going to go in our
[19:54] lab we're going to get dressed and
[19:57] you're going to go through the time of
[20:00] Jesus is that okay all right let me see
[20:05] if I can get this thing started here
[20:08] that's remember my password hmm was it
[20:16] stinky socks no was it blue blue red
[20:24] green no there's no green
[20:25] okay let's activate this thing blue blue
[20:32] come on and get nothing okay I got a
[20:42] better idea
[20:43] whoever wants to come in line up but in
[20:47] order to enter the time machine you have
[20:48] to tell me a miracle that Jesus has done
[20:50] for you is that okay oh okay so just
[20:58] share with us a little miracle that God
[21:00] has done for you and maybe this meter
[21:02] will start to raise up sound good okay
[21:05] face them IRA you don't have to look at
[21:07] me
[21:08] I'm ugly
[21:15] she forgot what a miracle his brother
[21:17] come tell her what a miracle is whether
[21:20] James
[21:21] mr. Webster himself come on tell her
[21:26] what a miracle is she needs your help
[21:32] okay like a testimony short thing it can
[21:40] be short long not too long because we
[21:42] got to get out pretty short oh just by
[21:49] you grabbing the mic it's all the speed
[21:51] you've got the word just say I love
[21:54] Jesus oh now this one doesn't working
[22:01] yeah what do we do when technology fails
[22:06] testing okay I want to thank Jesus
[22:10] because once my two sisters they had to
[22:15] get their tonsils out and it was really
[22:17] scary for me but I'm so glad that they
[22:20] got they got keep them safe
