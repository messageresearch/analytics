God bless you amen we have come to the the last day of the year and uh my goodness what a year it has been I'm sure that each one of you in all your trials and tribulations but you're here that's the most important thing but but you're here amen amen so we want to to uh get right into the word God bless those that are on on hookup the internet there God bless you this morning and uh we pray that God be with you and that you receive what you are looking for Amen to those that are here in the states and those that are abroad in so many different countries that are listening God bless you we want to this would be the sixth message on what think ye of Christ and I want to put a subtitle if I may who is this is so the scripture we've been reading Matthew the 22nd chapter the 41 through the through the 42nd verse if you when you have it you can say amen I don't think they put any breaks on this thing and hope it don't fall fly off hopefully we'll have the carpet installed here pretty soon so you bear with us amen it reads like this while the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked them saying what think ye of Christ amen as we bow our heads father almighty God lord we can read the text we can read the scriptures Lord but only you can give us the cont context Lord only you can give us the Revelation or the understanding of your word and so as we come into your word now we pray that you take complete control heal the hearts of those Lord that are that are sick hearts that are broken give joy to those Lord that needed need Joy this this day Lord whatever each one is coming asking of you Lord we pray that you would Grant it to them we'll always give you the honor and the glory it only pertains to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you you may be seated been a little while since I've been up here so somebody's got to help me real quick there was a triple or three-fold purpose by now you all should already know what threefold purpose of God the problem today is so many people that they they they pray to God and they they say they talk to God but how many people really really know God you cannot know him outside of his word so he had a triple purpose of to he wanted the people to know who he was it's a triple purpose of him revealing himself so somebody help me real quick what was the number one was to reveal himself in Christ right remember what we said God that all powerful all omniscient this great being called Elohim he he was too mysterious for for us to even fathom in our in our finite Minds so the first thing was he was going to reveal himself in Christ number two is to have preeminence in his bride and number three to restore the kingdom am so as I reflect on on this year and I'm sure each one of you in one form or another have reflected on it I can say wow what a year all the battles as I said all the ups and the Downs all the discouraging events that happened all our failures we can focus on all those things or we can just focus on one thing we are here and we have the victory yes or yes this it's been a a a a hard year but a Victorious year because you cannot have a victory L you have been in a battle believe that each one of us in one way or another we have been in a great battle and I choose to look at it as a Victorious year we can look at it as a year that we lost lost our founding pastor but I don't choose to look at it like that I choose to see it as that we were Witnesses of everything our founding pastor preached and lived for we were Witnesses of him leaving one Tabernacle and going into an eternal Tabernacle now now we have to choose the way we're going to see this year saw my wife's father go on to be with the Lord as well that was two fathers in one year and we say blessed be the name of the Lord we saw babies born here in the church tabernacled here in Earth God being faithful to his word god fulfilling promises that he gave we saw the Lord gather 1200 Pastors in Uganda we saw the light of the Gospel spread around the world we saw things that we had never seen before we saw this blessed message reach places that maybe it would not have reached we were Witnesses of revivals breaking out in different countries from Norway to Poland as the Norway of Poland we were Witnesses of God's Mighty works we saw many Souls come to the Lord both here and abroad we saw the healing saving grace of God in our midst and as great as this year has been I am looking forward to this new year because I believe there are greater victories that are that lay ahead let this year die with our failures with our indifferences with our mentality and may a new year be born I'm grateful to God for that let us do as Paul says in the book of Philippians the third chapter Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus and then I like what he said Here let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and this is where we want to start our message today once again let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if in anything ye otherwise minded God shall reveal even this unto you he's telling the Philippians here as many as be perfect now I want to know how many is he talking to today he's saying as many as be perfect well we got maybe half the church or three qus of the church and then somebody can look and say ha I know things about each one of you they're not perfect they make a lot of mistakes Paul here is saying as many as be perfect when people say no one's perfect how many have ever said that let me make sure we we hit home with this today how many have ever said oh nobody's perfect yeah I think we all are guilt guilty of that no one's perfect then this scripture is not for you oh I I don't think you got that Paul said let therefore as many as be perfect so if well nobody's perfect then this scripture is not for anyone it's just a scripture that we read and we say oh it sounds good no one's perfect anyways but then if that scripture is not for us then neither is this scripture Matthew 548 where Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect so why then do we use the phrase no one's perfect because of our insufficiencies notice this now this the phrase no one is perfect is an antichrist statement because we just read the Bible the Bible says Be Perfect the Bible says but as many as are perfect then if Christ is the word and we don't believe the word the only thing against Christ is the Antichrist Antichrist is a spirit and that Antichrist is against the word it's an antichrist it's anti- word once again listen closely that statement is an antichrist spirit that anoints people to say no one is perfect if you say no one is perfect you have never answered the question what think ye of Christ I abhor that statement I'm here to say it right to in the gates of hell I upore the statement no one's perfect I don't believe that statement why do I say this because that statement it's simply a feel sorry for yourself statement that's why people say nobody's perfect you're feeling sorry for yourself it is a self justification statement nobody's perfect that's how people justify their errors that's how they justify their sin their mistake nobody's perfect like if that gives us a reason to do what we do once again I abhor that statement and it's time this new year to get rid of that kind of mentality how many are are in this with me it's time to get rid of that mentality it's time to be perfect now now now let me stop for a moment because when we think of perfection we think of oh never make a mistake but the problem is is that we're always trying to perfect this guy out here that's why we don't see Perfection he he made a mistake oh she made a mistake you're looking at the carnal person but let's stop for a moment and see how this unfolds what think ye of Christ if I were to answer there's many answers we can give I want to clarify and I want to say this this morning he is the perfect one now listen closely here what do you think of Christ he is the perfect one and he is the Holy One period you believe that oh now we're getting something and if the perfect Holy One is dwelling in us then that makes us perfect and holy because the perfect and Holy One will not go come into a filthy vessel notice this as this unfolds don't tell me that you can have the Holy Ghost and not be perfect and holy hello everyone you're living in the glare of another age oh it's not us that's perfect by ourselves this is where we fail Lord how can I be perfect you can't without the holy ones you can't without answering the question what think you of Christ you can't answer those questions and therefore you cannot be perfect and holy without him it wasn't the Holy Mountain even though Peter says when I was on the Holy Mountain but it wasn't the Holy Mountain it was the Holy God that had descended onto the mountain that made it holy it's not the holy man but it's the holy God that lives in that man that makes him holy all right come on church now he's trying to change our mentality that no one's perfect amen and that's what Satan uses on the people every day you're not perfect you can't be perfect anybody deal with that let me see your hands we we all should raise our hands right because we feel that way I slipped up I'm not perfect I'm not worthy what makes us Worthy is not our own righteousness what makes us perfect what makes us Worthy is that we have a perfect sacrifice that gave his life for us and through the breaking of that blood cell bring on us another Another Life Life Is The Life of Christ in us that comes and makes us holy people it's not the outer man that we're trying to perfect the inner man that we're trying to prect if we try to clean up this person Reformation well this year I'm going to stop drinking I'm gonna stop smoking I'm going to stop looking at other women I'm going to stop looking at men I'm going to stop all the things that I do and it don't last very long New Year's resolutions a dime a dozen humans we want something better we want to start a new a new year right but it's not just about turning the page and trying to do something better it's about receiving the life that was let loose on Calvary that life has got to return upon the worshiper for the worshiper once Purge would have no more conscience or desire to sin in now now now now watch as we as this unfolds with me we're going somewhere today notice Matthew 21 and verse 10 and I pray as the Holy Spirit brings this out that he wraps it all together and it helps us this morning our last day of 2023 and when he was come into Jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this this is the question of the day who is this ask your neighbor the question who is this if you read the story you know what's going on here Jesus is coming into Jerusalem and there's a crowd of people around and they're cheering hosana in the highest they're they're laying Palms At His Feet and the majority of the people brother Bram says didn't even know who didn't even know who Jesus was only maybe 1% of the known world even knew or even had heard of Jesus and they asked the question who is this what's all this Ruckus going on this is a real question we have said time and time again listen closely nothing can happen to us unless God permits it how many believe that and if God permits it there's a reason for that happening are you with me how many really believe that notice this now W watch this there's a reason for it then why are we always as humans crying and complaining about everything we go through that doesn't show somebody that believes him that doesn't show somebody that trusts him completely we haven't answered the question who is this things happen in life why don't we answer the question who is this all we know is all the devil is after me is that all you see is the devil after you you don't see the one that permitted him to come after you oh come on now come on now th this is where we fail we're always looking up for me look at what I'm going through allows he he allows the enemy to attack us he allows the enemy to come after us because he's trying to form his character inside of us now now now watch this now we have to answer the question no matter what we're going going through in life who is this who is this that's in control the carnal mind cannot comprehend the things that God do God does the learned and educated mind can't figure God out in the Third Exodus he says oh the loving hand of God how sometimes it looks of the way that people suffer but still it's the tender hand of God leading his little children it's only the tender hand of Jehovah that is leading us to the tree of life that that's that's where we're de defeated go through rough stretches in life and we all do we're not always on the mountain we have our struggles we have our hardships but we cannot lose sight that Perfection should be part of our makeup I don't know if you I don't know if you believe me or not we have been deceived to think that everything we consider negative it's the devil's doing once again he can't do nothing unless God permits is it the devil that has brought you this far brother you don't know what I've been through this year you're here and it has it been the devil that has brought you safe thus far who is this that's the question we should be asking this morning who is this Hallelujah brother brandham says this if you don't see Christ in every verse in every scripture what do you have to do go back and read it again I'm I'm going somewhere this morning if I lose you now I'm GNA lose you for the rest of it you've got to see Christ in every scripture amen tell your neighbor neighbor we've got to see Christ in every scripture okay if not do what go back and read it again and if we can't see Christ in every part or aspect of our lives uhoh uh it it was okay huh as long as we were using this scripture you don't see Christ go back and read it again what about this fourth Bible what about this book If You Don't See Christ in every part of your life go back to the foundation go back to your heart find out who is in the control room uh oh come on now we got to se Christ in every aspect of our life the world is falling apart we've we've hit on that the homes are falling apart churches are falling apart people are falling apart they need and want someone to save them yes or yes come on now every one of us needs a savior we are all looking for a messiah we're all looking for help they were looking for messiah to come to rescue them from the Romans and while the world is crying for a messiah the answer is here the reason they don't recognize it they don't want him why it's not according to their taste I'm okay with brother amilio but not brother Caleb he's just not according to maybe I'm not according to their taste right notice what what what's going on here The Same Spirit in the time of Jesus the Same Spirit today it's not according to their taste the the world has had Solomons wise men the world has had their David's Mighty Warriors they've been under governments kingships priests judges God sent his laws gave them a covenant they knew they needed help from heaven and they got the Messiah that they were looking for and they still rejected him so it is today we pray for help we pray for divine intervention and when God sends it we reject it why because we don't answer the question who is this how many visitations do we need to find out who who is this that was brother emo that visited visited me who is it brother emo who is it look a little deeper we're stuck here stuck in what we can see but we don't realize that in here there's someone else it's him that's coming he's here for your for your benefit but we're blinded to it because it's not according to our taste listen to this here's Jesus entering into Jerusalem who's this F who's all this what's all this racket up all these crazy people actually believe that Jesus the is the Messiah it's those crazy people that believe that God sent a prophet it's those crazy people that really believe in a five-fold Ministry those of that's making a bunch of Racket they're going here and there and and they're making racket everywhere they go but they ask the question who is this and the crowd answer that's Jesus a prophet but yet though that he was sent to are the ones that understood and Could See Beyond the Veil that was that that that was covering it once again what does Satan fear the most he said this so many times somebody help me out what does Satan fear the most that that you're religious does he fear you coming to church he's the first one in church oh we we we we go to church we sooth our conscience we feel better we go home and we live the same way man don't fear that he's got you he got a wicked cycle go to church Soo your conscience go home the same way Satan just keeps you on that Loop kind of like a record player you remember those record maybe some of you young ones don't remember whatever records now don't they yeah but it would get stuck every now and then and it wouldn't stop and you're like and then again it's the way it is in our lives so many times get stuck into the same routine what does Satan fear the most then that's an easy answer he fears that the most the revelation of who you are in Christ not outside of Christ because outside of Christ we don't have a chance he fears once again he fears the revelation of who you are in Christ oh my what was God's original purpose to reveal himself in Christ and if we are in Christ we are the ones he's revealing himself to we hear this all the time oh this one left the messagebody you hear that oh this one left the message they don't the message they never found their position in Christ oh this one left the message church we can't leave the message you know why because we are the message how do you leave yourself it's impossible to leave the message when you are the message I said help us Lord notice this now and I and I hope this this helps you today because God is much wiser and so far ahead of Satan he does things that even leave Satan scratching his head how many of you know that go that Satan is God's servant couple of you now we're getting into some good stuff write this down he is God's servant and that includes all his Devils too how is it possible that the Book of Joel 2:25 that God would call those insects that ate his brid tree he called them my great Army which I sent amongst you wait a minute wait a minute let's stop for a moment right here this is where it starts getting good once again God calls these bugs these insects there was four but there is actually one in in four stages we know that but he he he he says and he calls them he he's he knows the beginning from the end and he he sees down to time how those insects those Roman bugs how they would eat the tree of the Bride tree down to a stomach yet he calls them my great Army not his great Army not that great Army he calls it my great Army which I sent among you it was all for a purpose that's why we have to understand the the purpose of God we've got to understand his plan everything we go through is for a reason there's a purpose behind it notice can you fathom that they are eating they're eating destroying his brid Tre and he still calls them my great Army this this blows our minds you would think you would think that in our minds oh God protecting us don't touch her that's mine yet he sends the Army and go ahead down to a stump I don't know if that gets you or not I'm having a hard time getting over this scripture but he knew that if him being the groom tree would be cut down hung on a cross yet from the roots the life that had been down in the ground was going to resurrect again that the only way to show that he was the resurrection and the life he had to send his great Army down to a stump so that life could resurrect in her notice this now and there's so much that there's so much entailed there but I want to get to this point here's those bugs now if we were to go back to to Genesis here's Adam and and and we we know what happens in the fall he was not deceived he knew what he was doing but he did it because the the spirit of Christ was in him save his wife when he fell that title deed that seed left him the seed where the life was it left him and as it leaves him saan trying to grab a hold of it but the reason he can't hold it says because his filthy dirty hands cannot handle life only God is the author of life he is the author of death his Filthy Hands could not hold on to it and it went back to the original owner waiting for man to come and claim what's his one more time now I'm going a little further now here's those here's those bugs here they are they began to eat the fruit the leaves the bark and now the last one is the caterpillar and now this tree is stripped to looks like nothing down to nothing and the caterpillar comes in for the Finish soon as it puts its filthy dirty mouth on that tree Bo the life he starts to try to suck the life but he could not handle the life so the life stayed in The Roots until the season God would call for it it would start to push up through the roots and he would restor that bride tree again the same way he he was restored at C how many love him is this now now watch now we say all this for because we're we're we're getting to something here it's beyond what Satan can figure out it's beyond what the what the what the the religious world can figure out it's beyond what churches can figure out but watch now you can see why she doesn't have to go through the Great Tribulation she doesn't have to be judged at the great white Throne she's already been judged along oh church I'm going to say it again she's already been judged she has already passed from Death unto life she's already Justified she's already sanctified already filled with the Holy Ghost she is already adopted you don't believe me this morning she's already perfected she's already glorified because she came from him what do you think of Christ this morning if you don't answer that question you'll never know who you are how can you know who you are if you don't know the source or from where you came from we came from him notice this now I'm gonna throw you another one Isaiah 44:28 this is all in God's great plan when you have it you say Amen thus saith of Cyrus he is my shepherd I'm giving you so much ammunition fire at the enemy look at what God did for us thus sayith the Lord to his anointed I'm sorry thus sayith this thus sayith of Cyrus he is my shepherd I'm sorry Cyrus God's Shepherd somebody help me with this this doesn't make a whole lot of sense that God would call a heathen King his Shepherd oh the Lord is my shepherd amen mine too but he's calling Cyrus his Shepherd and shall perform all my Pleasures even saying to Jerusalem Thou shalt be built and to the temple thy Foundation shall be laid who's going to do this God using Cyrus his Shepherd I'm not done yet Isaiah 45 now we're going to kick it up a notch are you ready now he's saying to Cyrus thus sayth the Lord to his anointed to his anointed to Cyrus whose right hand I have Holden what is our right hand power the power he has I'm the one that gave it to him he is Anointed the Hebrew word there is mashia which means Messiah he just called a heathen Pagan King his Messiah what think you of Christ now his Shepherd his anointed his Messiah how do you reconcile this you don't see Christ in every verse go back and read it again are you getting it Church everything in the Old Testament is speaking of and typing Christ even King Cyrus because the temple would not be built without Christ you want another one how is Jesus known as the scapegoat when he was the Lamb of God no that's right escape goat but isn't he the Lamb of God how could he be a goat how many are getting it I'm doing that to make you think a little a little bit then it's this is the point if he can call a heathen Pagan King his Shepherd an anointed one why do we have a problem believing that we can be his bride I I I don't get it a pig and yet oh no I I'm just not worthy no I'm just not good enough nobody is asking for your goodness our righteousness our Holiness is filthy rags in the eyes of God come on church I want you to get this this morning our own righteousness is like filthy rags I I go to church and I pay my ties and I pay my offerings and I do good to the to the orphans and the widows and it can still be filthy rags in the eyes of God I'm gonna show you why in a moment now watch this this is this this is just so wonderful to me why then why are we so afraid to call ourselves the bride of Christ we came from him we died with him we resurrected with him and now we are living and dwelling in him and he in us that's what he said in that day you'll know I am in the father father you you in me all right now why are we so timid and fearful of finding our place in Christ because you made mistakes because you don't feel worthy what the enemy tells you why are we afraid picking it up a notch now why are we afraid to profess that we are kings that we are priests that we are gods are Messiahs anointed ones in Christ not outside of Christ Christ the scripture tells us that whom the word comes to are they not Gods the difference between the Old Testament and New Testament Saints in the Old Testament their lives were a shadow a type of the coming Christ the coming Messiah but in the New Testament we are not a type of Christ we are the very Temple of Christ his very Throne is in the heart of man I don't know if we believe that or not come on I'm going to say it again that's the difference they typed Christ she is Christ there's no typing here it's the reality of what it is God help us to to make this a reality in our lives change our mentality the bride doesn't type Christ she is Christ oh my how much more confident and sure should we be I want to go into this New Year's confident and sure not proud like I'm big somebody some big somebody no when she knows who she is she's humbled by but it don't take away who she is it's time we answer the question what think he of Christ he says in the message what do you say who do you say this is men and women with any Christian status at all or interested in their Eternal destination man or woman any Christian status interested in their Eternal destination they have search the scriptures and see who he was search the scriptures and then you think you have eternal life search they ought to search the scriptures and see who he was that's passed in then the question he says wouldn't have been who is this they would have had the answer he is here we're either going to get stuck on the question who is it or we're coming to the Forefront and saying he's here I'm here you're here so then he's here oh come on come on I don't know if you believe that or not I'm not looking looking anymore to answer who is this I already know who this is I I'm here to say he is here turn around here oh we're going to find out here in a moment here watch this now when you find out who he was back then then you can Proclaim today he is here remember now and I want to jump over something real quick because I don't have a clock there no more but I don't know where I'm at but but it's the last service right no second to the last service but watch this now I want to see if they can put up that that quote on who do you say this is there you go see each had their own interpretation of the word that's the reason that Israel didn't recognize Moses that's that's the reason the world didn't recognize Noah that's the reason all the prophets wasn't recognized because they have their own interpretation of the word but God in every age has had his Messiah that's some good stuff right there I'm gonna say it again in every age or some Ages Every age he has had his Messiah to reject Noah's message was to reject God to reject Noah was to perish to reject Noah was to perish to reject Moses now was to perish they were the anointed Messiah for that age oh what think he of Christ he is the identified Christ of all the ages the word that was promised for that age and when Jesus came he was the fullness of that word God himself made into a man's structure I like that with bones and flesh the Eternal God coming down and came into a man's structure bones and flesh the anointed one and they should have seen that and Moses might not have even know it himself maybe you haven't haven't haven't noticed it yourself but he was the anoint anointed word of that day he was the anointed messenger so if he was the messenger of that hour then he was the Messiah of that hour he was the anointed one and Moses went down and took these same things and showed that he was the anointed Messiah that man picked up dust off the Earth threw it into the air flies and fleas flew out of that dust and covered the Earth what could create but God that was not just a Man Called Moses that was prist in Moses come on Church he's identified in all the ages nobody else could create but God here goes Moses once again takes water out of the river he poured it upon the bank and every drop of water throughout Egypt turned to blood what could do that what was it he was so completely surrendered to God he was so completely surrendered to God's anointed word until he was the Messiah but you see they trusted in their anointed churches rather than in Christ the word so when they saw the anointed word that it was against what their Church taught they said that's fanaticism this man is a devil be why because it was contrary to their church and if Christ would walk into many churches today he would be rejected the same way it's contrary to their way of thinking they ought to have known who he was they ought to have been able to answer the question who is this Christ the anointed word of the hour he says so the Oneness of God how many believe in the Oneness of God so the Oneness of God is the word anointed in you it's the word anointed in me and then we become Sons a messiah of the age no no nobody else you're going to go through the rest of Life moping and groping we're waiting for Jesus to come where have you been who is this amongst us but we can't see him that's why it takes Faith it's the substance of things hop for the evidence of Things Not Seen are you with me or you want me to stop than I think you guys have had I think you guys have had too much holidays too food and too much everything let me just go just for a little bit more so what should we be doing searching the scriptures so that we can know he's here can you tell your neighbor neighbor he's here he's here I I I don't doubt that he's here give me a church he says that's so completely Anointed with god Till every action and move is thus sayth the Lord and walk in that Shina glory and I'll show you a messiah anointed one of God standing upon the Earth if we fail to give this and get this to the Next Generation we have failed miserably if we do not manifest it through our flesh we must transfer this to our children and that's the way the message is you can sympathize with it and say yeah it's right but you've got to take it to yourself and become part of it then you and the message become one then the anointing is with you as it is with the others when we look at this and we see what he is doing in our midst he's not a god that is way out there he's a personal God he didn't come to redeem everybody he came to redeem those that were redeemable amen amen now now notice this now time hasn't changed people are designed the same but yet Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever the question he says isn't to them anymore listen closely the question isn't to them anymore no they asked who it is but in 1964 the question is who do you say that it is oh he's challenging their faith right that's them what do you say watch what he says what's this all about have you stopped to search the scriptures who do you think it this is is it mental telepathy is it some wild something out of the Wilderness like John was a wild man drowning people in water out there but Isaiah said that he would be the Forerunner and Malachi said he would be there just exactly so this Prophet finally arises on the scene forun his first coming but in this age we hear this voice from Heaven as John the Baptist ran my first coming so shall your message for run my second coming oh my we're getting down nitty-gritty now watch this as we see this unfolding in our midst they missed him in 1964 too oh there were a few that caught it because God always has his elect that catches it but let's bring it to 2023 who do you think this is it's easy to talk about history huh ah look at those unbelievers back then to the Holy Ghost in you will punctuate every word with an amen says something you say that's the truth because you're agreed with the word you're agreed with God you and God are one God is in you you're his son or his daughter and that makes you a messiah for him here's the thing now once again that makes you a messiah for him the anointed word living out in you let us this 2024 I don't want to walk into 2024 I don't want to stumble into 2024 I want to run into 2024 I want to meet the battle I want to meet our loved ones that have gone on to him we love the one we love the one we're waiting for I want to meet him coming is soon on just this and can I have like 15 minutes and then I'll just let me get this out because I it really means means a lot here I'm out Barber sheep hunting well it didn't start seemed like didn't start very well blew the transfer Cas or whatever on my truck then we get to the place down the road they cross in front of us they're going up this m the mountain we go after them I spp and fall and get my rifle in the scope happens Robert after that it's like the Hunts over um man what else well brother Ben brother Mark they were very nice you can use our my rifle there's nothing like when you have your own rifle you're comfortable you know what what you can do with that so we we a few times we had such a such a good uh we had a good strategy and here we see these they're at the very top of this Ridge and and well we think we're we're I don't claim to be a good Hunter but I mean I can hold my own at least we say well let's go around this mountain and by the time we get around we'll meet up with them it seems like that's the way we are in life we got all these great plans and how they're going to work out so here we go climbing this mountain around and what a climb and as we come around the corner looking and I don't see them no more there's no way they could have outsmarted me we all we always think like that no there ain't no way I've been in the message a long time no way I can be out well I'm looking over here this little Hill over here I see movement they're all covered all over this mountain right there and so we we slowly we're like each one is setting up there about 30 40 of them there 180 yards like oh yeah this is going to be easy Benny was on his belly on the floor Mark was on the tripod he was ready I was by the fence ready to go and right when we're ready okay the Sun comes right over the hill and all of us are like whoa where they at they're right there uhuh no we could not for the life of us what we didn't take into consideration was that God even gives the animals an opportunity to defend themselves nature tells us that we didn't get nothing they were right there you close your eyes and you can just see them oh so the next day we try again go this mountain right we see him again this time we're on right on the line of one Ranch to another and right below I kid you not talk to brother Mark and brother Ben there was four the largest barbery sheep I we have ever seen and there was aund of them at least Valley and we were looking at them like all right they're close but what do they do Ben he calls the right on them but it's on the other property what do you do you can see that nice big trophy on your wall and then you can see a little in the future every time I would look at that thing I would I would see you killed it on private property I said Brothers we know better I'd rather have a good night's sleep and have my conscience clear to go against the law what do we do we let them but through it all we were learning something showing us something it was such a wonderful time that I got some rest that I I needed more important than a barber sheep you see how God began to move and how he tested us and and see what are you gonna do I'll let this big old giant right in front of you up and I say no Lord I've got to be disciplined so much in life we lose the discipline our wants and in the midst of all that start coming down the mountain and I'm like wow it was a good time when all of a sudden I I kid you not I do not tell you a lie I'm walking in front of brother Ben and brother Mark and the faucet opens and the inspiration comes and then I knew why I went greater than the barber sheep hunt it was a moment with God and and this is what he quoted to me Matthew 7:22 through 23 M and he says this watch watch how important this is and this is the holy spirit he's quoting me this scripture many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity he asked me this question then why did I not know them why will they not be accepted when they did all these things in my name what a question I said Lord what are you getting at he said read it again Lord Lord this is the way I've always read it have we not prophesied in thy name Focus has always been in thy name where did they miss it I said Lord I I I I don't know and then he said asked me this question now now thinking remember I'm walking down the mountain hear him talking to me and he says was it the Acts of the Apostles I said no sir what was it it was the acts of the Holy Ghost in the apostles that did the work them as men but it was me in them did The Works he said now read it again Lord Lord have we boom I had missed the two-letter word this is where they missed it have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonders F Works he said do you see the key it is we they said we have done this in thy name and when they use we it is as filthy rags it was never me in them doing it Joel said that in the last days I pour out my spirit upon All Flesh yet not all flesh is saved so they did that because the anointing was here but they did it was never God in them doing it he said our your Holiness and righteousness is as filthy rags but my bride I dwell in her I have preeminence in her it is me that does the works through her you know what that makes you feel it makes you check your life and I'm walking down and I'm just start crying Lord have I ever said look what we have done Lord have we look what we have done over here look what we are doing Lord if I have ever used the phrase we or me or I Forgive Me Lord I don't want to get there on that day you say depart from me I didn't know you I said Lord please forgive me it makes us watch our words know who we are but we got to know who it is that is in us who is this ask yourself every day who is this is it just me oh Church there's so much so much but can I just for a moment here now can you put up the the the Tabernacle in the wilderness I just gave you the answer what do you see this is where we come to now and I'm finishing with this I I know I've been a little bit long this morning but but but let's finish with this okay who's who's brave enough to tell me what they see what is this what what do you see come on you know what you see anybody want to answer what do you see I see the Tabernacle in the wilderness I just told you put the picture of the Tabernacle what do you see I see the Tabernacle Moses built that nobody know that I'm finishing up now what else do you see they we're getting some good answers right because it makes you think beyond what your eyes are telling you look at that I see Christ what I see because you got to see Christ in every scripture I see Christ there I see this part this skin right here I see it hiding and I see Christ and what dwelt in Christ Jesus was the fullness of the godhead this we see Christ God revealing in Christ the Perfection of Heaven being displayed on Earth what else do I see I see the pattern yeah nobody sees that look closely I see the pattern I see an outer Court I see a holy place I see a holy of holies see a pattern Moses built what he had seen in heaven it was the pattern that's right what else do I see I see the new birth I see justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost what else do I see come on help me out here what else do we see here we see the type or the shadow that's not the real thing type or Shadow once again the Old Testament is a type or Shadow but we are not types and shadows why do I see here I see myself oh come on now you you got to you got to know who you are because I see the triun that's right brother Al I see the triun of man here Body Spirit Soul so I see myself there now I'm bringing it closer to home now watch now I see the Mighty God veiled in skins I see God in skin Walking In Christ but now I see Christ walking in his bride watch what he says here God has always had skin on him Moses saw him look like a man AB saw him he was looked like a man skin on him and God tonight in his church is veiled in his church with skin on it amen am I talking about anybody's skin here brother you don't know what I've done wrong that's the beauty of the Cross to redeem us he knew the mistakes we would make but he made a way of Escape he made a way to bring us back to Perfection he made a way to take the pattern and put the pattern and apply it to us what he says and God is veiled in his church in skin and now the glory of God that once came down in this little room now the glory of God is behind your skin God can you give one to the Lord Jesus Oh Church sister Grace would you come to the piano real quick I'm and I and I'm done now oh church this is what we're after this is my last part of it when I see this give me the picture please did the Shina Glory fall here fall here that why not it was a holy Place Why didn't it fall there it's it's a holy place it's called The Holy Place Church ages should need have fall in there no no because his goal his Triune purpose was not to find a holy place he was the Holy place it all speaks of him but watch this this is this is so beautiful to Peter who do men say that I the son of man am Christ son of the Living God blessed are you Simon bless and blood didn't reveal this my Father which is in heaven and Upon This Rock of Revelation I'll build my church how was this church built by the positioning of the stones or the members of his body when I see this and I see this there's a desire in me for something even further a deeper re a deeper relationship than this a deeper relationship than this this is what my desire I want to be one of those skins that hides him notice what it was called how many believe that Jesus is the king of kings who are those kings that he's King over I'm I'm finished already who are those kings that he is over then he is King of Kings okay he is L of l l is L the L what does that mean Lord of lords how many lords do we have here then he is Lord of lords how many holy people are there here not on your own Merit how many holy people then he is the holiest he is the holiest of all holies Santos oh come I don't know about you he is the king of kings the Lord of lords the holiest of all holies and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation you you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that ye should show forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light that's what he came to do the sixfold purpose the sixfold purpose one of them was to anoint the most holy this is our pastor our founding Pastor the sixfold purpose of Gabriel's visit was to anoint many said oh that's Jesus brother brandham says that's not Jesus he's already been anointed he said that's the tent or the Tabernacle that will be used in the Millennium now that's the anointing of God that comes upon this tent that's why he says of all the Visions I've had all of them have been fulfilled except the tent but the tent that's where the anointing comes from I'm sorry that's where the anointing comes and the tent is not canvas it's flesh and then he says it again it's flesh so then where do they get all these little ideas that it's a tent made of canvas God don't deal with canvas God deals with human beings with flesh touch me that a spirit doesn't have Flesh and Blood you see me who is this this morning sing it s Grace as you bow your heads and if you need something from the Lord this morning don't worry about your neighbor just just raise your hand struggling in
