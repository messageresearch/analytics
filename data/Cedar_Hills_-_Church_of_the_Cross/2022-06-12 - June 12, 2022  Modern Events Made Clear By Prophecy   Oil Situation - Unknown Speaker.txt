with an autoimmune disease and um of all the names they could give it um it's called graves disease great disease and um so i went um actually i wasn't told that i was diagnosed with this until um just back in april and um so the doctor was very shocked to see me he said i should be severely ill really sick or his words where i shouldn't be here anymore that um stops you dead in your tracks for a minute it makes you stop but um the lord knows what he's doing at all times and that's a testimony in itself to still be here because i serve a purpose testimonial [Music] not to let anybody anybody

this afternoon father to puerto rico we ask this in your precious and most holy name the lord jesus christ a man and a man you may be seated hey man so we have uh tonight it's it's following our lot to to jump into to yet another another topic in in in modern events and so we're going to we're going to we've divided it up into sort of three sections i'm going to cover it from the natural standpoint so and then and then brother ronnie we'll we'll finish it out with with the spiritual side of it [Music] and and what oil means to the believers so so without further ado we'll get started and and we're going to talk a little bit a little bit about oil in in terms of the natural like i said and everybody who drives the car or watches the news knows what the deal with oil lately is once again the prices of oil have just skyrocketed the the crude oil which is the the raw product is a product crew that that gasoline and diesel and all the different fuels are manufactured from gasoline is is up around like 130 dollars a barrel is and so forth and so on and of course gas prices are five and a half six dollars a gallon and now we've sort of devolved into uh the fact that diesel is becoming hard to find diesel fuel is getting very hard to find what they call diesel exhaust fluid um it's getting very hard to find and so there's there's a shortage a unescas which which takes us to to understand what's going on right now in terms of the natural oil situation you've got to go all the way back to 1973. the most regressive and there's there may be a a a few of the elders here in the church that can remember uh what happened in 1973 but basically what ended up happening was saudi arabia as a result of the united states back backing up israel israel in what's called the yom kippur war we stood with israel israel we supplied them with weapons liz and ammunition that they needed to fight the egyptian and syrian armies egyptian and syrian armies they came against israel so because we backed up saudi arabia in that war israel in that war saudi arabia said okay we're not going to sell you no more crude oil when that happened they put on the united states something called an embargo embargo and it threw our nation into chaos don't know if you've ever seen pictures but there's cars lying 20 30 cars deep at every gas station and either they would uh limit how much gas you got yes or they had no fuel whatsoever so that was the first time in the history of the world where a commodity like oil had ever been used as a weapon so now we're not talking about oil as fuel for your car already we're talking about oil as a weapon for control of a country estamos so when when this happened president nixon is is the president at that time and and he sends he sends his top cabinet members and they reach out to saudi arabia ivani uh and they tell saudi arabia look we got to make a deal with you we need your oil when this happens when this is to say it's a top secret thing that happens it was so top secret that it was not known about for 41 years saudi arabia decides that they're going to talk to this top cabinet up for grabs is is what's called our bonds a bond is the way that the united states estados unidos generates money to operate our government without bonds simbonus our government is broke so we negotiate a deal with saudi arabia and we tell them we will sell you our bonds you agree to not use oil as a weapon against the united states does not want to be recognized as helping the united states they don't want that stigma in the world so the agreement is that they'll form something called opec opec o-p-e-c it's the uh organization organization of arab petroleum the petroleum area exporting countries okay it's 13 member countries that make up guessing what they call a cartel cartel okay they control the price of oil globally okay so the deal happens with saudi arabia the oil in the united states starts to flow again everything's fantastic there are three major holders of our debt in the world china holds the largest portion china is japan holds 111 trillion dollars so we go along for 41 years everything's great everything's wonderful then the attack on september 11th happens after an investigation on what went down we discovered that two of the pilots that flew into the towers were from saudi arabia we're in terrorist warfare mode they called it up the president and they said okay you're gonna come after us we're gonna go ahead and call 117 billion dollars of your debt so you're talking about oil now black gold negro now is a weapon now it's weaponized now it's the way it is so that's that's oil as a weapon okay that's the 1970 throughout crisis [Music] that created a global cartel global that that tells the world you will pay so many dollars for oil and gas and it doesn't matter what we say and it doesn't matter what we do they control the price so in the middle of all of this we see the different things that happen with the administrations in our country and they're they're they're going back and forth in you know democrat republican back and forth and oil kind of bumps up and down over the la over the last few years when all of a sudden you see where we're at now and and we're we're effectively in a nationwide crisis but it's it's not a crisis of the fact that there's no oil you've got to understand that the price at the pump and all the scary news about oil shortages and stuff it's not because there's no oil noise for versus very few airplanes flew in the sky very few 18 wheelers were on the road in las vegas vacationers didn't go anywhere and we depleted the reserves that we had all of a sudden covet scare is over everybody jumps in planes everybody hits the road and there's no more reserves are extracted from the same exact product so when everybody jumped in airplanes and we have a supply chain crisis and a record number of 18 wheelers are on the road to produce a little bit of gas or a little bit of jet fuel and a little bit of diesel a little bit of jacket a little bit the the the combustion [Music] but it's not because there's no oil okay it's because the manufacturer is the [Music] they can set the price of whatever they want okay so that's sort of the maybe a little bit of the back story about how we got to the story with iran if you don't mind what what are what are can you give us an idea of some of the different things oil is used i don't know how many have have looked into it but there are so many things that are made out of oil [Music] you know i can look around in here in the in the building here and i can see so many all the things that are made out of oil petroleum real simple the paint the paint on the walls the fans the lights fans loses the projector screen [Music] there is a very very long list of things that are oil that can be used for i'm mucho muchas cosas thank you brother ron so oil is not just for your car it's in everything and so it's become what they call the lifeblood of our economy it's literally what makes our world move and we see the move that our current sitting president and when he comes into office he signs an executive order public health and so this is in 2021 but a few years before that the pope on may the 24th of 2015 he issues a document this document is called an encyclical encyclical and an encyclical encyclical to the catholic world is one of the most important things that a pope can issue is of the thoughts and intents of the pope his his his very thoughts and he entitles it bear in mind this is 2015. and laudato c literally interpreted to see literally and i'll just read this in english to save time in english it's the first part of it is praise be to you my lord in the words of this beautiful canticle saint francis of assisi reminds us that our common home is like a sister with whom we share our life and beautiful mother who opens her arms to embrace us praise be to you my lord through our sister mother earth who sustains and governs us and who produces various fruits with colored flowers and herbs okay the next part of it is this sister now cries out to us because of the harm sounds like scripture we know right whole earth because of the harm we have inflicted her by our irresponsible use an abuse of the goods with which god has in doubt so why why is this important because in 2021 like i said our president nuestra presidente signs an executive order that reads almost word for word for laodato if you compare the documents side by side the verbiage is almost exactly the same and the intent is almost exactly the same and it's to push the world away from is there the use of fossil fuels the combustible fossils towards other renewable energy sources of which there's really only one does anybody know what the push was towards holland electricity he pushed from fossil fuels and everybody goes hey that's great but when you look at electricity electricity electric cars cars electricals electric semi trucks electricals trying to make an electric airplane when you look at that it is the farthest thing from an environmentally friendly renewable resource mining lithium is unbelievably toxic producing the batteries that involve cobalt and lithium combination it's a chemical nightmare okay on top of that in sima de eston lithium batteries are dangerous they can't explode they can burn holes in your pocket you ever seen the videos of what happens when one of these guys overheats and to top it all off the power that charges the electric cars so it's it's the worst possible solution that you could come up with so why the push so there's a lot of things and and it spills over into the next time the the financial side of things that we're going to cover so what i what i'm going to do is i'm going to i'm going to leave it right there for now and i'm going to i'm going to turn it over to brother sam and and brother sam's going to take us through his portion um so studying on this topic of oil and current events [Music] my question was how is all this oil transported me preguntas and i come to find out that the main way that all this oil is transported is through what we call the pipeline and uh remember the natural types of spirituals i want to read to you what this pipeline is and i just want to talk about what a pipeline is and then we'll go into what it is today and what uh biden and then his administration are doing today is so this a crude oil pipeline is the most common mode of transport so it comes first with a high up front investment costs [Music] and it has a long term payoff there's three major types of pipelines classes and this is where where i put on my spiritual cap when i was reading all of this yeah me it gathers the oil right from the source so here we have a prophet with the direct channel to god the second system is called the transmission system is my transmission and now this system refines its processes it's a two-part system so it refines it and then after it refines it transports to its customers so here we have the prophet getting the the word is oil directly from its source he takes it he processes it and he speaks so the third part of the of this oil system is called a distribution distribution system now that's what they call a pipeline that runs directly to one's home and we have the fifo ministry here the name it takes this oil and it transports to the homes so we know what this pipeline is now we know how it's used but what i want to talk tonight about is the keystone pipeline and i'd like to open up this with a scripture mark 12 10. and it reads have he have ye not read this scripture the stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the coroner so we have biden and his administration today they had revoked a key permit for the u.s to stretch a 1200 mile project which would have been this pipeline permission now this pipeline was going to extend from alaska say alaska it's going to come all the way down through canada and it was going to end up in the united states now remember they rejected the keystone pipeline now i want to read a quote from brother branham [Music] anybody ever know that the pyramid never had the capstone put on it sure i've been there in egypt never had the capstone corona it was rejected the cornerstone that was the cornerstone that held this building when the ark is built then the keystone holds it together the cornerstone is what holds up the building is that right and the cornerstone in the pyramid capstone so here we see that the keystone and the cornerstone are the same thing and i was reading on this keystone pipeline just that at the moment that that biden and his administration decided to stop production of this keystone pipeline there had only been eight percent of this pipeline that was completed you have the alpha you have the omega omega you have the cornerstone you have the capstone now this nation rejected the cornerstone does anyone know when they rejected the cornerstone this nation cut themselves off from the oil exactly what they're doing today brother branham says in the message condemnation by representation and what did she do according to the vision she elected the wrong person what happened in 2020 i don't know how long it'll ever take it to run out but it will be someday she's been gone since 1956 when she condemned and turned away from the great revival hours that was 1956. shortly after just the year that brother bannon preached this message in 1960 the united states elected its first catholic president president that's president uh kennedy president kennedy the year 2020 that's what's going on a little bit we have biden that was elected into office and not by coincidence he's the second u.s catholic president president now this keystone was rejected did you notice it up there our angular and he mentioned something that was pretty interesting so this pipeline was to run from alaska through canada through and it was actually supposed to run through montana montana and if many of you don't know i'm sure you've seen it on the map but on the map the the state line of montana el estado de montana it's actually a silhouette of brother branhams but this pipeline is not going to run through there anymore brother brown and everything else but the hour is here when god will pour out his divine judgment so i'm thinking about this and then i'm thinking well where does that leave the bride because we could see we could see that the negative in all this and how it's affecting the world today but i don't believe that the bride will be left without but that doesn't mean that there's no oil petroleum there's still a reserve of oil they're sitting now spiritually who does that oil belong to oh respirator said in the kingdom of heaven will be likened unto ten virgins and let's fast forward a little bit they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with but in the spiritual the bride still has her pipeline i don't want to go too into it but in my dream uh the whole church was sitting just like how you're sitting now there was no space between everybody it was full and every person had their hand on the person next to them their forehead and they were just praying with all of their heart they were crying some of them were screaming and yelling but now next to them and i remember my dream i'm kind of floating over and i'm looking from the front and my eyes are going like this all the way down and it made just a big line he's implementing a grand linea and i shared this with with my pastor he said why do you think sometimes i have us put our hands on each other what is oil i was going to start off with reading a scripture but brothers damn right for me the oil is a type of the holy spirit now now for here from here on for the rest of this you're gonna have to put your spiritual caps on now okay now as brother carlos was saying carlos oil is known as crude oil petroleum or petroleum petroleum now petroleum comes from two latin words latinas from petra so this petroleum literally means rock oil is literally significant uh so so where does this come from where does the oil come from as we heard brother carlos it's a non-renewable energy source so oil is is made from living organisms that that uh scientists say that live millions and millions of years ago right difficulties in [Music] you know that that they have died and and they were gathered in this in this um in these like like cave kind of things and that's where you find this petroleum it's like in in uh in rock petroleum where it's sealed from the top and the bottom and this oil is gathered in these locations they're called reservoirs [Music] you know and uh don't have a lot of time to get into all the details of it but petroleum has been recovered by drilling petroleum that is the principal way the the main way that it is extracted you know and once it's been drilled [Music] and then they stick another pipe in there and shoot pressurized water into these into this rock and and they what they do is they call it what it's called fracking and as the square is [Music] so so what it does is it expands and it cracks the rock okay and it it opens up all these little channels for the oil to be able to seep into this channel so they extract the oil so that's a real real quick rough rough uh rough way how what oil is and how it's extracted now a couple of of uh events on this timeline of oil in in the year 1846 the first modern oil well in the world was drilled and south i don't remember how to say it caucasus region of the russian empire so that's one of the events and the and then another uh year in this timeline that i want to focus on was in 1909 the oil production in the united states surpassed that of the rest of the world the prediction the and the united states became the biggest producer of oil in the world now as the brother was saying after it's extracted that has to be refined your shampoo that we wash you wash your hair with shampoo toothpaste and now these are some of the daily products that we use every single day from the moment that we wake up the momentum you know these are the products that we use that are made out of oil you're deodorant and many many different things like brother carlos was saying now now i want you to i want you to keep that in mind okay that oil makes oil makes energy petroleum and energy produces power now a lot of people think energy and power are the same thing and although they're related it's not the same thing you know we'll get into that another time that that the energy produced from oil is the most stable the most reliable source of energy right now now and here this as the brothers were saying it's not that there's no oil petroleum brother carlos can correct me if i'm wrong it's that that's it's that the exploration is the exploration the drilling of the soil has been stopped and the the fracking it's been stopped the fracking location you know the you know like we said heard you know about the inflation and gas prices now the question is how does that affect us that's what we want to know right now that's just a little bit of the natural natural but spiritually speaking what does that have to do with us and that's what we want to know it's the modern events of oil but how do now again as as we said the oil is a type of the holy spirit and again it's made from plant life and animal life yes and i began to think about that and the plant life i was thinking about is like well working it's spiritual spiritual but brother branham says romano brown and lisa that there is one thing there's one sure thing that'll choke the holy spirit right out of your life that is a root of bitterness roots are are associated with plant life it's bitter against those that want to continue with the holy ghost but also brother branham says that denominations will also choke out the the holy spirit but brother ronnie we're not a denomination but one man and they're thinking and in their heart can be one man and although we are in the message we are in our mind uh denominational thinking spencer life now so that's you know just a real quick uh uh on the plant life but also animal life right and somebody might say well brother ronnie i'm not an animal running no no we're not an animal no no but but brother branham says that the human being was the highest form of now what separates the human being from from animal life is that the human being has has a soul you know but the thing about it is this like that the soul the soul has a fallen nature it's got the nature of the world just like just like how the natural types of spirituals how the oil was made naturally now now spiritually those plants of those animals in our life have to die they have to rot they have to decay you know it must be annihilated and must have a complete change yes you know and uh i just want to play something from our founding pastor here if they would the brothers would play it you know we sing the song it means you know how do you think give me oil in my land give me oil you know how you get all of the oil in my it don't come from me i'm sorry oil comes from the earth [Music] and it is the result of decaying of fossils and animals and bones and the only way you can get oil in your lap is when that serpent that's already been shot right next year he goes to the ground and out of that you get i o is it produces the oil from the inside it cleanses so now so now let's go back to that timeline for it real quick the tiempo 1846 the first modern oil well was drilled el primero uh but what does 1846 have to do with us now did you know that during that era during that time how the natural absolutely types of spiritual russia was receiving the baptism of the holy ghost prophet of god says it was the first time since the day of pentecost let me read it right here for you the baptism of the holy ghost fell to santo the first time since pentecost in russia 100 years ago this is the message jubilee year 1954. that's right that's history that's historia and they had the baptism of the holy spirit and it worked signs and wonders a hundred years ago and rejected it you'll give if you i'm sorry if you won't listen to god he'll give you over to a spirit that'll condemn you and be turned over to a reprobate mind he said that cambiado because it failed to receive the jubilee message of the baptism of the holy spirit they were turned over to a reprobate mine they believed the lie and and and are damned by it in the sight of god you know and as i was meditating on that that quote right there i'm driving on the way to work and the and i believe the holy spirit tells me this brothers western watch russia watch russia and we all know that the brother said it not too long ago he says it three times but the question is why as we heard as i read right now what the prophet said could it be could it be because they rejected the holy spirit and went into communism so that's my thoughts right and if we don't watch ins what what happened we are we can very easily end up in the same state as we as we heard brother sam say that the united states has rejected it and we reject it and where are we we just heard brother branham he says brutal hearted now that was 1946 and i believe that's what it has to do with us in 1909 how many know what happened in 1909 i i believe all of us know what happened in 1909 that was that was the year that brother branham was born so can you imagine can you see the type of people the united states becomes the biggest oil producer in the world and brother branham is born abraham now watch this vichy lester brother branham again armando brandon paragraph 44. okay so i won't have a lot of time to get into this so and now brother branham says and i was born april the 6th 1909 and so the morning that i was born mother said they opened the window and so when i was born my first beginning to cry now when i read this the holy spirit says santa you know but the holy spirit catches my attention on this one thing right here he said he says he says but those that were were listening they said oh he calleth for elias now as i keep on reading this here you can continue it says and when they open up the little window just at the break of day [Music] about five you know so so so you might not think that this has anything to do with it okay he said that pennsylvania we all know the story of the robin right how we got his red chest you know and i can see how jesus is on the cross and here are here these little robins are here trying to pull out the nails and he's there and they're trying to take him off the cross and and i i can see these little robins that they're too small they can't and as these little robins hear the voice of their creators you know they're there like they know they can't take them off because they're too small but they also hear perot oh you know so so i can see these little robins here this old robin these little robins have since that time have a commission and when this this young this baby begins to cry here comes the robin and the and these robins brother carlos they remember the cry they remembered their commission he says oh you see that little light that that's right there he's all it came through my window like a whirlwind now we know that's the type of the holy spirit right so this is what 1909 has to do with us and he says that whirlwind sits sat at the t at the bed and there it is yeah yes and then it leaves now watch now now this little robin knew that they couldn't take him off the cross but there would be a man that would take him lift him up out of history and they could take him off the cross this was all that god was old he poured it into christ and this was christ all that christ was christian he pours it into the church so this this was god's point this would be god pointed to
