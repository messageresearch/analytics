[3:31] [Music]
[3:32] Philippians 2 if there be therefore any
[3:36] consolation in Christ if any comfort of
[3:40] love if any fellowship of the Spirit if
[3:44] any bowels of Mercy fulfil my joy that
[3:48] edie like-minded having the same love
[3:52] being a water card of one mind let
[3:59] nothing be done through strife or
[4:01] vainglory but in lowliness of mind let
[4:05] each esteem the other better than
[4:08] themselves look not every man to his own
[4:12] things but every man also on the things
[4:16] of others
[4:18] let this mind be in you which also was
[4:21] in Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[4:26] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[4:29] with God but made himself of no
[4:33] reputation and took upon him the form of
[4:37] a servant and was made in the likeness
[4:42] of man and being found in passion of a
[4:47] man he humbled himself and became
[4:50] obedient to death even the death of the
[4:54] cross
[4:55] now if we shall turn now over to 2nd
[5:00] Corinthians the 3rd chapter we will
[5:03] begin with the sixth verse and reading
[5:08] this to the 18th and down to part of the
[5:13] 4th chapter who also has made us able
[5:17] ministers of the New Testament not of
[5:22] the letter but of the spirit for the
[5:26] letter killeth but the spirit giveth
[5:29] life but if the administration of death
[5:32] written and engraved in stones was
[5:35] glorious so that the surety of Israel
[5:38] could not stedfastly of all the face of
[5:41] Moses for the glory of his countenance
[5:44] which glory wants to be done away how
[5:48] shall not the administration of the
[5:50] Spirit be rather glorious for if the
[5:53] ministration of condemnation be bores
[5:57] much more does the administration of
[6:00] righteousness exceed in glory or even
[6:05] that which was made glorious has Old
[6:08] Glory in this respect by reasons all the
[6:12] glory that itself or if that which is
[6:16] not away was glorious much more have
[6:21] which remaineth is glorious in n that we
[6:26] have such a hope
[6:28] we must greatly
[6:31] - of speech used rate - a speech and not
[6:36] as Moses which put a veil over his face
[6:40] that the children of Israel cannot
[6:42] steadfastly look to the end of that wish
[6:45] was abolished but their minds were
[6:51] blinded or until this stage remained the
[6:55] same thing untaken away in the reading
[6:59] of the Old Testament which Bale is done
[7:01] away in Christ but even under this day
[7:06] when Moses is read the veil is upon
[7:09] their hearts never less when it shall be
[7:13] turned to the Lord the veil shall be
[7:16] taken away now the Lord is that spirit
[7:19] and where the Spirit of the Lord there
[7:24] is Liberty but we all with open face
[7:29] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[7:34] Lord has changed into the same image
[7:36] from glory unto glory even as by the
[7:40] Spirit of the Lord therefore seeing we
[7:43] have this ministry as we have received
[7:46] mercy we faint not but have renown see
[7:52] hidden things and the dishonest not
[7:57] walking in craftiness and handling the
[8:01] Word of God deceit Lee but by
[8:04] manifestation of the truth condemning
[8:09] ourselves to every man's conscience in
[8:14] the sight of God but if our gospel be
[8:17] hid it is hid to them which are lost
[8:21] may the Lord and His blessings to the
[8:24] reading of his word now by subject this
[8:29] morning I trust that God will reveal
[8:33] this and each time if you who take the
[8:37] tapes and listen hope and trust that
[8:42] that you have
[8:45] had a spiritual understanding a lot that
[8:49] God has been is trying to get over to
[8:53] the church without saying it right out
[8:55] think it some things sometimes we have
[8:59] to say things in such a way that it
[9:02] might pin down if I bring song to go out
[9:06] some to leave and some to ponder over
[9:13] but that's done purposely it must be
[9:16] done that way then it might be as I'm
[9:20] going to say you mean God would
[9:21] purposely do a thing like that he's
[9:24] certain he said one day when he had
[9:28] thousands around him he said except you
[9:33] eat of the flesh of the son of God son
[9:37] man and drink his blood and alive in you
[9:40] what kind of statement do you think the
[9:42] medical doctor or nurse or any fine
[9:45] intellectual person would think of in a
[9:47] statement like that bro man that had a
[9:49] ministry right he had why he would say
[9:51] eat the flesh that's cannibal to drink
[9:55] human blood it's a vampire in other
[9:58] words he wants us to be cannibals and
[10:00] vampires and the whole audience walked
[10:03] away from me and there was a ministerial
[10:07] association with a demon 70 that had
[10:09] been chosen and he turned to them and he
[10:12] said what would you think when you see
[10:17] the Son of Man ascending up from where
[10:20] he came from now he didn't explain that
[10:24] you never explained how Paul did that
[10:27] later on he just said it and then when
[10:31] this he said what will you say to these
[10:34] ministers when you see the Sun man
[10:36] ascending up from where he came from no
[10:39] doubt that man said not just at the
[10:41] moment or we eat with him we fish with
[10:45] him we sleep with him
[10:46] we know where he was born we see the
[10:49] crazy lady
[10:50] he was rocked in and how does this man
[10:54] this is a hard scene and the eye
[10:57] dated walk with unity or their lefty
[10:59] then he had 12 left he chose twelve in
[11:03] one of them was a deadly said so he
[11:06] turned to them and there's no one could
[11:09] explain what he had just said how are
[11:12] they going to eat his flesh and drink
[11:14] his blood and how did he come down when
[11:16] he was born I got her see they couldn't
[11:19] understand it
[11:19] and he turned to the apostles he said do
[11:24] you want to go also and that's why the
[11:27] Apostle Peter made a great statement
[11:28] Lord to whom would we go or we are
[11:33] satisfied we know surely that you and
[11:37] you don't have a word of life is nothing
[11:40] and we're set aside of that see they
[11:43] could not explain it they you can't
[11:46] explain faith is something that you
[11:49] believe and it's so solid that there's
[11:53] nothing else or take its place therefore
[11:56] they know that the word that was written
[11:58] from that age that they were living in
[12:01] the masai age that he fit that place
[12:05] exactly and what could they do to go
[12:09] back in that cold formal churches that
[12:11] have been coming out of said where would
[12:14] we go to see we are fully persuaded and
[12:19] you have the world line and they they
[12:24] couldn't explain it but they believed it
[12:27] see and Jesus said that to weed down his
[12:31] crown hey do you get the group together
[12:34] and out of all those people they only 11
[12:40] of a man understood Ashley who he was
[12:44] they know that he was gone and gone home
[12:48] now
[12:50] there my son Keith this morning is to
[12:53] reveal or unveil that God God as always
[13:00] in every age has hid behind a veil all
[13:06] ages but he's been God all the time
[13:11] but he's can be self heed from the world
[13:15] and reveals itself to his elected like
[13:19] the apostles of that day
[13:21] now that was God speaking in Christ now
[13:25] man as always it's been the nature man
[13:29] he's sought to see physically that God
[13:34] he's always wanted to see it man is made
[13:37] creatures of the backing they think of a
[13:40] the Indians worship the Sun and we find
[13:43] Africa of different forms of animals and
[13:46] so forth enough of the totem poles of
[13:49] Alaska and different farms that they
[13:52] think this God is in as Paul spoke there
[13:55] at Athens that time on Mars Hill and
[13:59] told them that they were superstitious
[14:01] concerning this unknown God and they
[14:03] know he was there but their right mind a
[14:06] lot knows there's got to be something
[14:08] somewhere and huh Joe wanted a tall team
[14:13] I want you to notice the deform that God
[14:15] chose to talk to Jovi God was bailed
[14:19] when he talked to Joel he was veiled in
[14:22] a whirlwind came down in a world you me
[14:29] the God still comes in a world
[14:33] there's several sitting here a number
[14:35] that was witness to the day when he came
[14:38] in a world we told us the day before
[14:41] brother banks would stand when he said
[14:42] to take up this rock throw it up in the
[14:44] air and say thus saith the Lord you will
[14:47] see it right away and then I picked up
[14:50] the rock up on top of the mountain do it
[14:52] up in the air and the course is coming
[14:54] down and start the whirlwind see the
[14:57] suction of it you have to do something
[15:00] to cause something to follow it Jesus
[15:04] talk of a piece of the bread he broke it
[15:05] then multiplied from that piece of the
[15:08] bread he took water poured it into a
[15:11] pitcher he lied you took salt put it in
[15:15] a Cruz cut out a stick throw it on the
[15:18] water it is something to sing on and
[15:22] picking out this
[15:24] and thought it in the air and coming
[15:27] down started the whirlwind the next day
[15:31] while there was a minister with us on a
[15:33] hunting trip
[15:34] he was standing close to he said the
[15:37] Lord get visions out like this brother
[15:40] brown eyes that yes but I used to come
[15:43] out your arrest and just send the vision
[15:47] keen and brother borders he's outside
[15:50] now he was along brother the bank's
[15:52] woods I'm thinking oh several ones up
[15:55] there eight or ten and brother the banks
[16:00] was watching for this right on the
[16:01] mountain right across from exactly about
[16:04] 1/2 mile were the seven angels that
[16:07] appeared at a lecture go therefore come
[16:10] back and told about the seven seals just
[16:14] about a half a mile from that and then
[16:16] the next stage when this was going on
[16:18] while the I said to brother this brother
[16:23] I said watch your trouble you've got an
[16:25] allergy in your eye the doctors just
[16:27] ride for a couple of years of stopping
[16:29] and he came to the city or go let's go
[16:31] eat your I'll and I've said before
[16:34] wearing the Lord Jesus is a larger pain
[16:37] and he just got this gun and I said
[16:40] you're a mother what she was and what
[16:43] was wrong with her and he said that's
[16:45] the truth brother Roy
[16:46] Roberson for the church sandy prison I
[16:49] guess all you know knowing he went to
[16:51] the bachelor in a norm hop it was going
[16:52] to take place above a hand on his
[16:54] shoulder I said brother listen be
[16:56] careful watch something fishing to
[16:59] happen
[17:00] I walk back to where I'm supposed to be
[17:02] standing and out of the air came a
[17:04] whirlwind down to a canyon from above
[17:07] that was so great totally the tour rocks
[17:09] a tortillas a through out of the top of
[17:12] the mountain in the two hundred yards
[17:13] out in and plat three times like that
[17:16] and the voice came from all of them
[17:19] standing there brother debates president
[17:22] now he boasted that was what she told me
[17:24] yes I said yes that's it he said huh
[17:27] what did it say I said it now that's
[17:28] just for me to know brother they see the
[17:31] calls it was it was a long people but it
[17:33] went ahead it happened just a little
[17:34] traveling awkward little few days
[17:36] later it hit the ocean and you see my
[17:39] hat around Farraday he said it was an
[17:40] adjustment of sign now we behind it
[17:43] thank God still panics and so then the
[17:52] head to head habit see this has to
[17:54] happen in the veins it's got to have it
[17:56] got have an enemy these what happened in
[17:59] Moses one hand desired to see God and
[18:03] God told me to stand on the rock and on
[18:10] the rock Moses stood in he's seen God
[18:13] passed by and his back look like the
[18:16] back of a man dog was in a whirlwind God
[18:22] wobbles is standing on the rock I guess
[18:25] y'all see the picture out there the day
[18:26] we stood by that same rock and here's
[18:28] that light the easel or died our destiny
[18:31] got a little more there now again notice
[18:35] Jehovah are the Old Testament is Jesus
[18:38] of the New Testament he is the same God
[18:42] just changing his form and someone said
[18:45] yeah a Baptist minister out in Tucson
[18:48] how can you say that Jesus and God would
[18:53] be the same person I said well it's very
[18:56] easy if you just let your own thinking
[18:58] get away and think the Bible terms of it
[19:01] they are the self same be God is a
[19:04] spirit Jesus is the body that he was
[19:06] Bailey I said like in my home to my wife
[19:12] I am her husband I have a young daughter
[19:15] Rebecca I am her father and I have a
[19:20] grandson and his name is Paul
[19:23] I am his grandfather I am husband father
[19:26] and grandfather and my wife has no
[19:31] claims on me as father or grandfather
[19:36] she has claims on me alone as husband
[19:40] and my daughter has old claims on me as
[19:44] husband or grandfather she is my child
[19:49] see but yet all these three persons is
[19:53] the same person hey that's God Father
[19:57] Son and Holy Ghost is just a
[19:59] dispensation clean God is saying the
[20:04] same God God changed himself Jesus his
[20:09] farm if you know shirt Philippians he
[20:11] said not fake it robbery but took the
[20:15] farm of man now the Greek word there for
[20:19] that form of a look at it all day
[20:21] yesterday trying to think out what it
[20:24] was a fine coming with this word of a
[20:28] mafia it's spelled E in mor Phe looking
[20:33] into Greek to find out what it Martha
[20:36] was I'm a pronounce that wrong but at
[20:40] least I spell it whether the tape is
[20:42] released their people stars will know
[20:45] what I mean by he one day my Pia that
[20:49] means that he changed his self he come
[20:54] down how the Greek word there means that
[20:57] something that could not be seen yet
[21:00] it's air and that is changed and I can
[21:03] catch it
[21:04] see like Elijah was a dolphin
[21:07] Ziza the servant couldn't see all those
[21:10] angels around there and God just changed
[21:14] not broke the Angels down but he changed
[21:18] the scene of the sermon and there I was
[21:23] the mountains full easels and barn
[21:25] horses of the bar chariots of the bar
[21:28] all around is prophet see they change
[21:32] the scene that the thing is already
[21:35] there so that what I'm trying to say
[21:39] that God that always was is here the
[21:45] only thing he done want to become man he
[21:48] changed his mask he he this 'martha he
[21:54] changed himself to what he was to what
[21:58] he is or is man
[22:02] another act like in a great drama as I
[22:08] was speaking this morning you kind of
[22:10] catching up on this of Shakespeare in a
[22:13] long time but when Shakespeare wrote the
[22:17] drama the Farah King James of England
[22:21] when he the character of Macbeth see
[22:26] Shakespeare did not believe in witches
[22:29] but in the plate for the King didn't
[22:34] believe in witches so he had to include
[22:36] witches see and now in order to do this
[22:39] they changed the cast Becky here and
[22:44] Carmen
[22:45] they acted that and in the school where
[22:48] she just graduated a few weeks ago now
[22:50] maybe one person played three or four
[22:53] parts and in order to do that he changed
[22:58] his mask sometimes he comes out he's
[23:01] this character and the next time he
[23:04] comes out he's another character but it
[23:07] is the same person all the time and
[23:11] that's God he changed you sell from from
[23:16] a pillar of fire they become a man then
[23:20] change himself from that back in the
[23:22] spirit again that he might dwell in man
[23:26] God acting in man what he really was
[23:32] Jesus Christ was God acting in man in a
[23:38] man in a man that's why he was he
[23:42] changed from the pillar of fire and then
[23:45] it come in which was a veil in the
[23:48] wilderness that hid God from Israel
[23:52] Moses seen the shape of his body but
[23:55] really he was hid all the time behind
[23:57] this pillar of fire which was the
[24:00] longest it went from God now we find
[24:04] here now since Pentecost
[24:07] God is not acting in man or act in eyes
[24:13] acting
[24:14] room and think he was acting in a man
[24:17] named Jesus now is acting through man
[24:20] that he has chosen for this purpose God
[24:24] in the form of man he changed himself
[24:28] from the form of of a god to a form of
[24:34] man he came in three names three sons
[24:37] names he came in the son name of the son
[24:41] of man the son of David and the son of
[24:47] God three sons names and I came first in
[24:52] the son of day a son of man because he
[24:58] was a prophet
[24:59] now Jehovah himself called Ezekiel and
[25:02] the prophets son of man
[25:05] what see us now Jesus never referred to
[25:08] himself as son of God he referred to
[25:10] himself as son of mainly because the
[25:15] Scriptures cannot be broken there can be
[25:18] nothing broken in the scriptures every
[25:21] word must be so that's the way that I
[25:25] believe it that's why it's got to be not
[25:28] because I believe it because it's a Word
[25:30] of God
[25:31] now if you notice in the beginning one
[25:35] word page one in the Bible in Genesis 1
[25:40] we find out that the whole all the
[25:45] sickness all the sorrow all the
[25:47] heartaches and everything that's ever
[25:48] happened to human beings came because
[25:51] one person disbelieve one word caused
[25:57] all this that's the first to the Bible
[25:59] in the last of the Bible revelations 22
[26:02] the same God said whosoever shall take
[26:06] one word out of this or add one word to
[26:09] it see it must be word by word just so
[26:15] area so therefore I just take the little
[26:18] thing like I'm going someone always
[26:20] going over to you about the women
[26:22] bobbing their hair not to me
[26:25] as long as she does that I don't care
[26:28] saintly she doesn't know how much she
[26:30] knows she's still wrong
[26:34] she wears shorts and these poles like it
[26:37] I don't care what she does how much she
[26:39] can sing how well she can preach
[26:40] whatever she could do what kind of life
[26:43] she is it's still that one words broke
[26:49] see it's got to be every word not a
[26:52] sentence a word one word so the Bible is
[26:58] no private interpretation it must be
[27:00] word by word the way it's written we
[27:05] must believe that and not only believe
[27:08] it but live it if we don't live it then
