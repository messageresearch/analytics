like to let you know that I was privileged and it was an honor this is be able to go with Pastor Caleb companies Caleb and the other ministers that went along with him truly it was a blessing for me and from the bottom of my heart I've always as brother will said the other day that there was 14 of us [Music] but we went as one and in the scripture in Acts 2 chapter 2 verse 1 yen is and when the day of Pentecost was fully come steps they were all with one Accord o in one place a I was reading the message of brother Branham is of questions and answers the Holy Ghost the El Espiritu Santo and this to me is exactly what happened there in Uganda yesterday and Uganda when the day of Pentecost was fully come Santo they were all in one mind is now I like that better um because you could be one in Una cuerdo record upon most any subject but their minds but here their minds was the same one mind and in the same place and to see the interaction with the different Brothers it was beautiful to see that each and every one of them it didn't matter who we are or where we came from we never went anywhere unless we made sure that we were all accounted foreign we no one was ever left behind we all went together and following the leading of the Holy Ghost thing everything that we did and it was so beautiful to see that one of the things that impacted me the most Una de las cosas that I will always remember I remember on Sunday morning we're going to go to Brothers Rogers church it was raining that morning and as we were getting ready to go turn on the road to go up to his church Iglesia the bus couldn't make it up the hill because of the rain so it so it couldn't make it because the dirt was slippery it was muddy so he just stopped Paro and without skipping a beat he seen it seemed he's saying that the nurse everyone they opened the door we all got out we got her salimos for things and we started walking up the hill towards the church and what was so beautiful to me was that they as we were walking up it appeared to be at least a hundred yards [Music] not more to where the church was and to see a group of people hermanus coming down to greet us and to need us singing and raising their hands and clapping cantando the alabandual senor they were just so happy to see us and there's there is something there as long as I live I will never forget yes we greeted one another saludamos we shook their hands they hugged us they turned around we all started walking up towards the church they continue to sing continue to clap the Palmar and all the way to the church and it never stopped until we got into the church to me that was so beautiful to see the love of the people something I've never experienced in all my life to see people so happy and I know this was the first time that I have gone and the the welcome and the warmth and the love that I felt is is is that is is that if they had seen me before yes and I was returning and it just goes to me it goes to show that we were all one we went as one solo hombre and they traded me no different than they treated the rest of the brothers that had been there before and to be in the service and to just to see the way they were they starting soon [Music] it was like no weather Iraq Unico you could feel the the pull from the people alone as I got up to speak you could just feel them just so loving sotos holding on to every word that we would speak because it just shows that they were hungry and they were happy to see us and truly from the depths of my heart out so blessed to be able to be there and another time something that impacted me so much was on Wednesday we were scheduled to go to mayague and because of circumstances so we worked good morning I don't know why we keep having problems with that video but uh God bless you brother Tim amen and uh you stand this morning disappointed in the PM good to see you why don't you turn around and smile at your neighbor it's good to see you this morning amen we have we have uh quite a few families that are out this morning your families that had gone to a wedding in in Fort Collins Fort Collins amen may God bless them take care of them but you have all the visitors that are here this morning turn this down a little bit somebody just get getting some rebounds up here amen and we have two very special ladies in our midst this morning great warriors Through The Years good by their husbands we're very happy to have sister Varela here amen [Applause] to find ladies amen that we we respect very much respect and we think the world of them amen we wanna we want to uh there's also a couple of babies that are born so we want to congratulate brother brother Enriquez Lorena their babies and uh brother Ariel and sister Sarai also their baby that was born good we are grateful to God for for life we want to jump right into the word now we we try not to go too long this morning amen and what wherever we leave off today we'll continue the next time John the fourth chapter and uh the uh let's do the 23rd and the 24th verse the scripture we've been reading for this series through worshiper number nine with the subtitled the mystery of worship how many know that worship is a mystery Mysterio no everybody know everybody's awake how many know that worship is a mystery but it's a mystery that has been unfolded and not everybody that says there are a worshiper are worshipers sorry amen the churches this morning are full of worshipers but let's see about the true worshiper the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth may God add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated thank you amen what a subject we continue to have here be grateful to God we were able to go to a wedding this week goes to Phoenix we must have Phoenix or of our niece amen may God bless them in their marriage earn and Jimmy amen when we talk about worship most people will use the word or the term worship with interchangeably with praise everybody when we talk about worship we say oh we're going to worship and let's go worship and praise the Lord and we interchange the word worship as I said with praise with giving Glory With Honor magnify to bless and all these things they are associated with worship but it doesn't mean that because you do these things that there is real worship doesn't mean just because you you praise or you do these things that you are giving true worship because worship is a mystery I want you to tell your neighbor that so that your neighbor knows very well neighbor worship is a mystery how many believe that Amen in in understanding or distinguishing between praise and worship I think it was best put When It Was Written like this praise is about God worship is to God you get that I'm going to say it again praise is about God is praise is opening up worship is entering you get that one all right I'm going to say it again praise is opening up worship is entering In Praise Is boldly declaring worship is humbly bowing and when you bring the word worship into the English language you can see up there it comes from two words and sip we also sip worth means or we are it means worth worth and sip or ship means the quality or condition so when you come to the word worship it is the quality of having worth so anything that we worship we are putting worth too okay and we worship the people today worship many things which one has their Idols which one has their churches each one has things that are more important in life but when the real believer comes to it they are the only ones that can give God the worth that he deserves amen this morning I'm gonna say it one more time and we are proclaiming in this dark world that he alone is worthy now only the the true worshiper can can ascribe that to him the Bible says in Psalms 29 2. give unto the Lord the glory do unto his name and Worship the Lord in the beauty of Holiness you can't talk about worship without mentioning praise for praise would be like the attribute or a part of worship that's why these two words are used so commonly together they are often used interchangeably at times but though one cannot have true worship without it producing praise one can praise without producing worship amen for instance if you take and we say we praise our children when they do something something good foreign that doesn't mean that we worship them yet on the other hand we cannot Worship the Lord without it producing praise now there's some there's a few words that I want to go over with you because it helps us to break it down and to understand what a true worshiper really is in the Hebrew there are a few words that we want to go over the first word if they put it up there is this word yado means to worship with extended hands giving thanks to God it is often a cry for help when we are in Desperate Straits and need a victory this is raising our hands is one of the most explosive and meaningful expressions of Praise can we raise our hands this morning this morning look at your neighbor say neighbor this is explosives what an expression of praise it is because it is also the international sign of surrender it is you gotta put some effort into it the Bible says in Psalms 134 2. stop your hands in the sanctuary bless the Lord one more time can we all lift our hands in the sanctuary because it says once again you've got to be tuned into his presence if we just say oh I'm in a prayer does us no good if we are not tuned into his presence it is the privilege I like this Barack is the privilege of blessing the Lord in other words each one of us has been given a privilege to be able to bless the Lord this morning that's why job could say and the lord taketh away yes but blessed be the name of the Lord the next word is it is to sing or to Lord's praise is because he doesn't just sing at church all day long good job brother keep it up there are over 300 mandates in the Bible that they tell us to sing God helps his children so that your children can remember he tells his children he says this is your children of What the Lord Has Done teach them in songs teach them in poems it is our blessing to be able to worship God in spirit and in truth habits the Praises of Israel how many know that once again God inhabits the Praises he inhabits the Praises and you tell your neighbor he inhabits the Praises in other words that's where he lives the word zamar la palabra then is to pluck the strings of an instrument and while you're plucking to sing praises it speaks of rejoicing it is translated into the New Testament as the word Ephesians 5 19 would you put it up there speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord amen what is verse 26. okay okay go to verse 19. huh nosis wow singing and making Melody just in your mouth no it says making melody in your heart the next one we find is same root as yada but it literally means an extension of the hands in adoration and then comes the word which means to shout or a dress with a loud voice here today all right we got a few of them anybody else want to do a Shabbat today and we do it all together oh okay now we'll make sure you're awake this morning I need a little Foundation this morning okay let's see the let's see a Shabbat from the from the young people one two three minutes they're awake all right it's to shout or address with a loud voice is even deeper than that it includes an attitude of gratitude for God's promises even while still in need let me this is a good one once again it is to have gratitude for God's promises even when you're still in need that's usually the time that we lose the worship the time I guess the Lord don't love me raise your voice and give God the Gratitude it's to be surrounded by the enemies and still maintain your faith in God even before the victory arrives are already Victorious yes how many believe that this morning amen amen then it means to dance or sometimes we have a we can dance good at home we don't like to dance Too Much at church oh that's all right no not in church no no that's where you should eyes where you go I'm gonna remember David when the ark came back to Israel did he just say oh well I'm glad you have the ark back okay we dance so much in the spirit that even his wife was a little ashamed of him but when you have Quran who's around you know he was looking at you I think we need some qurar once in a while then there is which means to clap your hands somebody can clap and give one to the Lord this morning that is and then you come to the the most well-known praise word that there is for praise can anyone tell me what it is hallelujah hallelujah amen Hallelujah it is the Premier word for praise in the Bible it transcends the languages of the world it no matter what what language or what nation we go to visit everybody knows what Hallelujah means Hallelujah means praise to the Lord it is not translated how many know that the word hallelujah is not translated it is transliterated it is the outcry of one is who is excited about God is oh come on some of you are still half asleep I'm going to say it again it is the outcry of one who was excited about God hallelujah means you're excited is there anyone that's excited this morning Hallelujah come on can we can I get another Hallelujah excited about God yet you find people after so many years in the message to lose their Hallelujah it's one of the worst things that could ever happen to a Believer when we're not excited about the things of God it's when we get cold and indifference notice this word hallelujah it is used only 24 times in the old testamentos all between Psalms 104 and Psalms 150. it is the ultimate exaltation you won't find the word hallelujah in the Old Testament but what you find is praise the Lord that means Hallelujah that is Hebrew Hallelujah and it is used four times in the New Testament all in Revelations chapter 19. and after these things I heard a great voice of many people in heaven saying Hallelujah Salvation and Glory salvation an honor and Power are commanded to praise the Lord ah all the inhabitants of the Earth are commanded to praise the lord we can praise the Lord in singing and shouting foreign that's right once again praise is the outward expression external worship is the inward Revelation praise does not require anything of us it is merely the truthful acknowledgmento of the righteous acts the losses of God Almighty and since he has done many wonderful Deeds he alone is worthy of Our Praise You See worship comes from a different place within us worship comes from a different place within us worship comes from within it should be reserved for God Alone worship is the art of surrendering and losing oneself in the Adoration of another praise can be a part of worship but worship goes beyond praise there's a lot of Praise that goes on in the churches but very little worship that really goes on Hallelujah I'm going to say it one more time there's a lot of Praise going on in the church there's a lot of movement and dancing brother Branham was asked the question what does it mean when he says when the Bible says that bodily exercise profit is external in English it's good a little bit it's when we're spooky though but people think that because they jump and Shout that they are worshiping that doesn't equal that is even though a worshiper can jump in shouts but not everybody that jumps and shouts is the worship are you with me we can express ourselves in different ways but the true test is what is on the inside it is the Revelation the revealing of the word that he has unveiled in the heart of the Believers that will determine the type of worshiper that you really are it is impossible it's impossible to worship God and someone or something else at the same time God will not share his worship with Noah try to live like the world and then try to live in church it doesn't it doesn't go together because sooner or later your Folly is going to be made known here Jesus in Luke 4 8 tell Satan Lucas it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God can we all said together and him only shout thou serve worship the father what about the Gentiles you'll get to us in a minute he worship and ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father now he's including me and you now worship the father in spirit father seeking such to worship God is a spirit now notice the true worshiper yes the worshiper who knows the truth you don't just go to church and get a oh that felt goodness I felt to tingle down my spine and all of a sudden you're a worshiper the true worshiper knows the truth receive the truth found himself in the truth you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free now Revelations chapter six if you can turn in your scriptures this is so tremendous when it comes to the worshipers and when he had opened the third seal I heard the third Beast what an invitation and when I came to see he says I beheld and lower Black Horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hands if you go back to the beginning of Revelations chapter 5 and read the chapter who is it that is speaking here somebody help me out who's speaking every time a seal is open you try to try but every time he opened one of the seals was opened there was a voice that said come and see the limitations who's the one that was making the invitations oh come on you're looking at me like you have no idea what I'm saying I ain't gonna preach no more until you give me the answer is me and you will read I gave you a clue start reading from chapter one the revelation okay ministers you can jump in anytime you like to when a lot of ministers some of you not oh oh honey I need somebody got it we can go on now look it says Revelation 6 1 right okay watching Revelation six one and it was my fault because I said Revelation 5 right foreign we're gonna have to have a study just on chapter six of Revelation was a lion exactly right and then came now and that was he's saying come and see and that was the there was a white horse right and so we go to the second one and so forth and we don't want to that's not our our subject today so much but every time a seal was pulled back or or broken open who's breaking open the seals but now we know that the lamb has come and sat on his throne and he's in this messenger yes through the messenger he's breaking the still open is that right amen now now we know that that's that should be ABCs but this is the part that I want to get so when he opened the third sale foreign it's a living creature a beast right but not therion no this is a living creature right and so when we when we see this and they each one as a seal is open creature is saying something but in the midst of all this oh I like this it is him speaking and I beheld in lower Black Horse and he that sat upon him had a pair of balances in his hands and so we see it's the same message come and see that Philip tells Nathaniel can anything good come out of Nazareth and Philip says well come and see Philippines and the same message these living creatures are giving the same message why he's about to uncover Satan and his plan but this is where it really gets interesting come and see means that you got to come and understand it for yourself you gotta know for yourself the greatest message you can ever tell anyone but watch now as it changes in verse six Revelation 6 6. Revelation says and I Heard a Voice this voice that begins to talk okay a measure of wheat for a penny he says and three measures of barley for a penny he says and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine wait a minute here this is good stuff as these living creatures are speaking there comes a voice from the midst of those living creatures hold on a minute or this gets any further yeah I'm here to tell you don't you touch the oil nor the wine is oh good one how many agree with brother with brother brother Diego who's speaking now it's the lamb in the midst of it all come on in the midst of it all the lamb Rises don't you hurt the oil nor the ones oh I like that now there's another voice coming forth he's in the middle of the four living creatures because the throne is in the middle oh yes it belongs to the lamb and this was so important is that the lamb couldn't have anyone speak first so Where is the hallelujahs where is the shouts understand where were you when the sons of God shouted for Joy when they were saying hallelujah okay so now the lamb our El Cordero says nobody's going to say this he said I gotta say it myself stands up and says don't hurt the oil nor the water my goodness watch as this voice comes forth selling I want you to notice in all of brother branham's Ministries he mentions oil and the wine a few times but he never explains the oil and the wine until he preaches the Sills I don't know about you but Jonah says this this excites me is I don't care about sports or anything else this is what makes me shout hallelujah notice this once again it wasn't until the seals that he begins to explain why because the lamb was now speaking from his throne the real perfect worship is a mystery and can only come here when the lamb breaks the Sills in other words there was worship before but I'm not like this worship this is when the lamb breaks open the seals and the real worshiper comes foreign Revelation 6 with Matthew it goes Perfecto the true worshipers worship the father father in spirit there's your oil there's your wine and this is what Jesus was talking about ah remember that well the hour is coming in now is but that hour was no longer coming that hour is no longer coming that hour is here you have an opportunity Church like no other human being I want you to get that this girl you have an opportunity this morning to worship God you say hallelujah like nobody's ever done it because the full truth and we can worship him on another level that when somebody says thank you best just to keep that one inside it begins to build up and you begin to shout hallelujah your Hallelujah Church the very foundations of Hell fundamentals take all of Heaven nobody has ever shouted Hallelujah like weeds but the question is are you shouting Hallelujah the hour has already Christ the anointed word of the hour and the prophet of the day is the word because the word he has the word porque he has the words and Jesus Christ in him makes him the anointed word of the hour Jesus Christ make us the Revelation I don't know if you're getting it the revelation of the whole thing what he says is because Jesus the word Jesus he is the word the anointed word the anointed Messiah is comfort and anointed people am I talking to anyone oh you ought to be shouting hallelujah oh come on is there anyone else that can shout hallelujah this morning Hallelujah it's the Revelation that Satan hates yes because it exposes his plan he hates Revelations and Genesis why is he so against Revelation because the entire Canon of God's word and God's Church solemnly built upon Revelation don't you hurt the oil nor the wine while the living creature saying come and see and says don't you hurt oh my what why would be we'd be afraid why are we afraid of anything why do we fear anything you know why because we haven't heard the lamb yet we've heard a lot of preachers I'm going to say it again we've heard a lot of preachers but we have not heard the Lambos the voice behind the voice oh come on now you you gotta say Amen this morning time to hear the Lambs we're the living creatures but now the lamb has spoken not the oil nor the wine watch what he says here in the message the third sale spirit and oil the oil is the spirit and the joy of the wine that spiritual life don't hurt that is [Music] remember the lamb speaking otherwise and this is this is in the third film otherwise Rome Roma don't you touch it it's mine it's Mio that belongs to me is what was it okay it wasn't a for beasts he's going to take his own that belongs to him he has redeemed it oh but don't hurt that oil and wine that's right listen to it now I like the way brother Brown says don't you heard it boy you understand boy you're gonna pay one of these days if you mess with it I don't mess with my children mess with the ones that I have put my holy ghost in I'm looking don't you mess with the ones that I am revealing myself and have the anointing emulation of the revelations don't mess with them you're gonna pay for it watch when he says as he goes on now the fourth cell watch he says now we gave an illustration oil and the wine was but let's review this again symbolizes the Holy Spirit like the foolish virgins with no oil but the wise virgins which is the holy spirit now watch as the lamb unfolds the mystery of worship it's not a mystery no more the lamb is now unfolding them oil symbolizes the Holy Spirit connectado you see why the lamb is saying what he's saying don't hurt the oil or the wine because that's where my worship comes from and you will not interfere with my words I don't know about you but that excites no one else boy sounds good you like that Nobody messes with my oil or wine boy so he sees him a little boy little boy could you say that the rest of the time I'm up here boy yeah boy what he says hey look at this thing that's what he called the end is his worship is only found in her there is no other group there is no other Church there is no one else on planet Earth no one else in heaven only in here the prophet of God says his worship is only found in Earth put your name is okay now put your name there come on guys come on sister his worship is only found in Solo and you put your name there is part of the bride of Christ mystery that's when Mysterio oh something that God said it's a mystery they can't understand it after a while God comes down and reveals it and then vindicates it and brother Branham continues between the sixth and the seventh seal says questions and answers on the Sills and they asked him after him preaching it is the oil we took as the symbol of the Holy Spirit Wine and oil is connected together in the Bible in worship the Wine El Vino the stimulation is you know when you get stimulated how many of you does the word of God still stimulate you oh what a shame when it doesn't work get it done amen why did you think that amen God get them in that what God deserves he serves our best come to church foreign and we're tired the wine is the stimulation and he's still revealing himself Church come on you know the other day we were in in prayer meeting Fair service here for the men there was a quote that was reading says a drunk man loves air a drunk man right that's right buddy now watch this now notice this now watch what he says drunk man loves everyone he don't care what anybody thinks okay you know the church is full of a lot of people that aren't never get that never get drunkenas we care about what everybody thinks I think if I jumped and shouted yeah you haven't got drunk yet hello everybody they don't care what anybody says shouldn't it be the same in the spiritual spiritual so if you don't think that no one loves you I'm not around the church all the time nobody cares you haven't got drunk yet sisters it won't matter what anybody says start to love everyone when's the last time you got stimulated when's the last time you revealed himself to you okay oh there should be some stimulation going on stimulation God should still stimulate let's get back to the word what stimulates the church oil and wine coming together juntos connected together why do we anoint the sick with oil symbolizes the pouring of the Holy Spirit God is the word in the beginning was the word the word the Word was God and the word became flesh and dwelt amongst us and it sits here in a natural form now yes the very word that had happened it now sits in its natural format Aki [Applause] I didn't know that till the other day is about to preach the seventh seal but uh questions and answers but did you notice how brother Branham starts the seventh seals I have read it recently he's talking about the Seven Silly and he says this is the eighth day he said what he says Eighth Day is eternal that right amen what he's about to bring a message he's already preached six seals they say you preach the Plan of Redemption but now the seventh seals which was the heart of the messenger it's now being broken to bring us higher into eternity to show the mystery of worship oh my God I can go into that for a while but I want to just continue to go let me see where I'm at I think I have about 15 minutes we're all doing good that must be in all right Satan can impersonate the first and second pool but the third pool he knows nothing about because it is the revealingo the perfect word it is the complete revealing of the perfect worship from his throne is saying not the oil nor the one what is the stimulation of Revelations the transference in the faith of Jesus Christ remember what brother Branham said now Rome Roma don't you touch that no Los tokes Rome is everywhere is that right amen Rome is not over there just in Italy has infiltrated everywhere the church is Iglesias in the politics political everywhere you turn they've got their hand in everything now watch us all I'm coming around this one corner watch he says Rome don't touch the old nor the wine they say please Paul is talking to the Believers in Rome that's the book of Romans right with me talking to the to the Believers in Rome it has infiltrated the whole world but watch this that purple curtain be careful with it be careful with it watch as we bring this over please Romans 1 7 through 9. Romanos make sure everybody gets that I want you to read this this is Paul to the Romans now once again Rome don't you touch the oil nor the wine it says to all that be in Rome oh first I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all remember watch this that he tells them please say that your faith is spoken of es predicada throughout the whole world we were on the other side of the world we were in Africa you know what the brothers are saying your faith to fear of a little church in Las Cruces your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world how could a little church help feed so many ways Church your faith is spoken up throughout the whole world and every believer that is part of the bride of Christ faith is your faith is spoken up or God is my wits who my serve and the word serve means to worship and my worship with my spirit in the gospel of his son without ceasing yes I make mention of you always in my prayers the Believers at Rome were surrounded by a city of pagans that sounds like today with all this woke culture and everything else we are surrounded by pagans from every side and what they had to deal with in Rome wait a minute I'm not just talking about pagans out there because we get to throw oh that's easy what about the ones that constantly it is what they had to deal with on a daily basis and still up all the gospels was only possible listen close because of the faith in Jesus Christ it's not possible any other way you gotta go and rub shoulders with the world every day hello everybody hola you gotta go deal with them on a constant basis but they had a faith and this faith that Paul is talking about the faith that the whole world was had spoken of is you know what that means they had a dynamic faith yeah it wasn't a faith they said I believe in God that's good yeah same beliefs too but this faith that was spoken was a dynamic an active yeah Dynamic active and vital Dynamic activity what made it such a faith because they were willing to share it they didn't just hold it to themselves they were willing to share it now we're getting into true worship this kind of church was not hindered by a culture that was dominated by pagans this church was not hindered by no one is because it had a dynamic faith in other words Dynamite where they would go even there was explosions oh let me give you a little testimony I don't even know how to say this
