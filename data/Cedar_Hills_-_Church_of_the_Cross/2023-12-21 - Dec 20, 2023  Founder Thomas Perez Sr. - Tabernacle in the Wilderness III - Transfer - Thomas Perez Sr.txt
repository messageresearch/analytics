her I am deeply thankful to God this morning I love love the Lord and I know you love the Lord and I I want to know him in the power of the Resurrection I'd like for you if you would now to not take any more time because I have a problem with time you see God is not in time time is in God so when we're in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus there's no time amen but we have a limit here amen if you would be so kind as to stand with us to honor God's word this morning and I'd like for you to open your Bibles to to the Book of Daniel chapter 7 verses 9 through 14 want to entitle this uh teaching whatever the Lord will give us this morning just one word transfer transfer it wrs this way in Daniel 7:9 I watched till Thrones were put in place and the Ancient of Days was seated His Garment was white as snow and the hair of his head was like pure wool his throne was a fiery flame its Wheels a burning fire a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him a thousand thousands ministered to him 10,000 times 10,000 stood before him the court was seated and the books were opened I watched then because of the sound of The pompus Words which the horn was speaking I watched till the till the Beast was slain and its body destroyed and given to the Burning [Music] Flame as for the rest of the Beast they had their Dominion taken away yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a Time I was watching in the night visions and behold one like the son of man coming with a Clouds Of Heaven he came to the Ancient of Days and they brought him near before him then to him I want you to watch closely here then to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom that all peoples Nations and languages should serve him his Dominion is an everlasting [Music] Dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom the one which shall will not be destroyed amen may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word let us pray father we have read a portion of thy holy word we report for service at this time we pray that your holy spirit will come upon your children I Surrender myself to thee this morning Lord take me Lord and use me as you would have bless your children heal the sick bind the Brokenhearted set at Liberty the captives for we come in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ bless us now in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen amen you may be seated in the Book of Genesis 128 it's showing us here how God blessed them and God said to them be fruitful and multiply and fill the Earth subdue it have dominion over the fish of the sea over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves on the Earth how many here believe and understand that Jesus Paid the price at Calvary I guess not everybody let's raise your hands if believe that amen we we must confess this I I believe that but even though he paid the price we still have a lot of problems is that right even though he paid the price the devil is still the devil he is the Bible calls him a roaring lion you ever heard a roaring lion amen and he is seeking whom he can devour and he will devour anything that is not inside the kingdom that's why it says that his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion that shall not be destroyed today we look at the Middle East and everybody is in expectation of whether we are going to war or we're not going to go to war but what we are seeing and being Witnesses of is nothing else but what is written in the Bible it's coming to what is called the Judgment of the Nations we don't look to these kingdoms we look to another kingdom now when the Lord told his disciples he said when they asked him teach us how to pray he said he said pray in this manner he said thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven so then the will of God is to be accomplished here on the earth when we receive the Lord as our our personal Savior and we receive the Holy Spirit we're receiving a shadow of a shadow of a shadow we receive what is called the earnest of it amen we receive that amen but as long as we don't hold the abstract title deed in our hands amen we don't have full possession of it we know that Adam lost he forfeited his his title did we all have read this and understand this I am I am moving into a cycle this morning because we're going from a shadow to a shadow to a shadow but we want to come into that Perfect Light Of God Amen so then when we receive the Lord amen we receive him as our savior the Bible says and the the the prophet tells us Satan's dirty hands could not keep this book in his hands and he says it went back to the original owner but it it won't do you a bit of good if it stays in the hands of the owner but the owner had given this to somebody and it had been lost and he had to bring it back the Original Seed had to be restored and in order for him to do it he had to come as a near Kinsman Redeemer but let me take the word near and just put Kinsman before it amen how many understand this so then I don't want to take too much time on this because you've heard all these things but we understand that in 1963 what body repeat after me 1963 amen God confirmed the contract he confirmed it and gave it to the seventh angel we know we know that the angel comes at the end of the age and at the end of the age was when this angel came and he came to rebuke lady because they thought they had everything but he said they were naked they they they needed oil they needed to be dressed to see that God was bringing the kingdom down to the Earth that's why the kingdom that God was given was an everlasting Kingdom amen how many understand that now the Bible tells us if you would turn in your Bibles I'm not going to read it I'm just going to be quoting these scriptures in in Revelations 31 now if you notice in Daniel 7 it says till Thrones were cast down now the Bible says here to him that overcometh will I grant him to sit in my throne and the prophet interprets that and says in my domain not everybody can sit in that Kingdom it says to the Overcomer now when it says Overcomer the Bible tells us the prophet shows us it says to overcome you must keep life inside of you not the light out here the light has to come inside of you that's the only way that you and I can overcome you cannot overcome by being a religious person you cannot overcome by memorizing the Bible the only way that you and I are going to make it out of here keep life inside of us and that life is the light of the man that's the life that he gave us amen now according to the word I'm going to turn it a little bit there's three Bibles but in actuality there's four Bibles that's right there's three steps in the journey but there are actually Four amen amen I I I remember when brother brandham was went amongst the Pentecostal people and and they put that old colored man to preach and he said why why do they put such an old man they should have put a young guy said he was about 90 some years old he said but you you you've heard all these preachers preach about these things down here on Earth he says but I'm going to take you before he said he went up to the heavenlies and he said he brought down that horizontal rainbow he said after a while Bob Willard was ching to him there ain't enough room for me up here brother Bram says if if if that made that old man do that what will it do a young man think about it when he brought him down we see the Bible and and it was written first in the skies it was called the zodiac then he brought down to the pyramid and then the word was put in book form it's called the Bible everybody reads the Bible everybody that goes to church reads the Bible that calls himself a Christian these words were written by the Holy Spirit but actually they were they were men of all wrote this Bible they were inspired by the Holy Spirit now we find also another thing if we want to break these Bibles the Zodiac the pyramid and the book which which we called the Bible how many have a Bible let's erase your bibl beautiful beautiful don't forget we're raising the Bible we're raising the standard let's see you raise the Zodiac you can't stop there raise the pyramid you can't it's in Egypt raise this everybody raise this we have this in book form we have another thing with us which is called tapes they didn't have magnetic tap but they had scripes and they would they would write everything that Paul was saying when the prophet was here it came on Magnetic Tape amen amen all right now I want you to notice carefully I don't want to stay too long and explain all these little details because I want to get to something I want you to be in expectation of something the prophet of God had three pools in his ministry amen the first pool the second Po and the third pole we could call him three stages amen we also notice that the that that seventh seal that third P had three parts to it he said something happened today or yesterday he said and another one today the other one came in an unknown language now this is what I want to get to when we saw these pictures that were placed here by brother we find six six of those ages now he said the seventh one had not been completely covered with Darkness he said there was a little light left in it we find that when the prophet came he preached to us six seals and those six seals was the book of redemption that Redemption was to show us the plan he said in the first seal this is the plan of God how many how many want to know God's plan you should be be very enthused about this plan this is what he has for you this is what he has for me I believe today that if we had not known his plan my wife would not be here with us according to his plan it let us see something that the human mind cannot comprehend beyond that when the churches preach when the churches preach when they continue to preach it it's easy to preach Jesus Christ of yesterday it's easy to it's easy to preach that now when when John was commissioned in the aisle of pedmas this were the instructions given to him write write all the things that you have seen the things which are and the things that shall be Hereafter it is easy when you have a mind and you can study to give history and explain everything in detail but toing bring him to the scene it takes something else it doesn't take your mind but it takes your surrendering and a recognition that he is the same yesterday today and forever I am not preaching a Christ of yesterday but a Christ of today and if he is with us then we must manifest it because if we don't manifest we are being Liars we really don't believe him today not yesterday I know what he did yesterday but I want to know what he is today in my life in your life that's the resurrected Christ in every detail except the Corporal body that's the expectation I want to get you to this we have seen teachers explain to you how a man can blow away this that's good that's good teaching we can see how balloons can go up but we want to see more than that this morning we want to see a Deliverance bringing it from a shadow to a shadow to a shadow until the perfect light with us but we must recognize it in our midst read your Bible and bring him out of here I say again read your Bible and bring him out of here bring him out of this take him out of here come and pray and I'm not saying for you not to pray because you must be prayed up come and pray and bring him out of [Applause] there fast until you ain't got no W left and I'm not saying you shouldn't fast CU some of you go out here saying you don't believe in praying and fasting I pray more and we pray more and fast more than people that are on their knes sometimes we're on trips I fast from my wife my children my friends I pray whether I'm driving I don't have to be kneeling down today Bible says we pray all the time pray without chasing I don't know how many hours at night you sleep I only sleep about two hours a night if you don't believe me as my wife always thinking always praying I'm not like this on these things because a great word has been prised in our hands we don't have just any chaffa things in our hands we have Jesus what am I going to do I have to do something because it's in my hand I have to give it to somebody but who's going to receive it not everybody receive it because they'll read their Bible but they won't read he said I know some of you and some of your preachers don't like for us to holler don't blame me I'm that way forgive me I was that way when I was 27 years old I'm 50 years old then I'm still that way if I get to be 90 years old I want to be like the colored man I want to do the same thing yes I was there till the Thrones were cast down and the books the book was open which book there was only one man here that opened up his heart to you and I one man one man opened up what was inside of him amen he cried when he went amongst the Pentecostals and he couldn't find he got his scripture he said I didn't know what I was going to preach but then he said he lifted up his eyes in hell I wonder what he saw in Hell well brother hell is down there no sir hell is here he lifted up his eyes in hell what did he see in hell terrible things he said then he began to cry and everybody began to cry why did he cry because of what he saw in heav amen now the book of redemption was opened so we could understand the Plan of Redemption amen now I want to I want to read a scripture in Revelations 10 I'm going to hurry as much as I can to save time because I I know I know myself amen Revelations 10 and it says that he saw an angel Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud a rainbow was on his head his face was like the sun his feet like pillars of fire he had a little book open in his hand he set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land cried with a loud voice when a lion roars when he cried out seven Thunders uttered their voices when the seven Thunders uttered their voices I was about to write he had to write because the commission was for him to write everything as he was about to write all of a sudden the angel said don't write this this takes my own personal touch I will write this no one else will write this I will write this in their hearts it won't be in this paper it will be in heart hearts of Flesh where he was going to write and let me tell you one thing no one can write it John is a type of the Bride the bride cannot write this finger the things that are for his people his will and your will you must find out his will for you to do what has commissioned what has been commissioned for you to do here let me tell you something about this light God told Moses build me a tabernacle according to the fashion that you have seen it now this Tabernacle we call it the Tabernacle in the wilderness in the desert of Si amen now the Tabernacle was fashioned in such a way that you would see the outer cord out here amen and that got what is called Cosmic light inside the that was a little room that was separated into two one was the Holy place that did not have Cosmic light but it had candle lamp Candlestick or he says lampstand that still wasn't the True Light but there was another Veil you know I knew this since I was in denomination but really I didn't know it I knew how to read it I I used to enjoy it but there was a veil and it's called the veil of self will can everybody say self will self will is you don't look to nobody self go like this self you th this behind this other veil was where the sh or Shina glory of God would come down only in this place no one was permitted in there only the high priest only once a year Moses was called by the pillar of fire amen and who went with Moses was J for six days the P fire the cloud was there but on the seventh day God Called Moses inside this cloud Joshua couldn't go in only Moses could go in anybody went in there it was death because it was a type of what was coming since the Garden of Eden when the sherim were placed there to guard the entrance amen poor interpreter I I'll Tire them out you tired my voice amen now we find that Moses was taken to this place but I want to read a scripture found in second Corinthians chapter three amen don't you love the Lord this is his word amen second Corinthians 3 praise God give my interpreter a breather here 36 remember that Tabernacle in the wilderness remember the seven Church ages Israel had seven Church ages amen who also made us sufficient as Ministers of the New Covenant go ahead not of the letter but of the spirit you have to watch it here because God when he expresses his thought then it is written want you to notice that let me say that again when God expresses his thought then it is written but then he hides it behind his word it has to be in the word because God is the word and he's in the word but as long as you see it written and you don't take this and eat it you'll always see it written in the Bible but it has to be written some place else to be made manifest to bring the original seed to his restoration Redemption you cannot have Redemption without restoration they go together redeem is to send back and to restore to place it in its original position that's why God said Adam Where Art Thou he knew where Adam was but Adam had left his position and as long as you are not in position he will say Jacob Jacob where thou Tony Tony where thou William Williams where thou but when you find your position he ain't looking no more he's there he's there are this is hard for the people to understand for the letter kills read the Bible all you want read these books all you want brother it'll kill you I want to say that again you read this it'll kill you but you got to die before you can live yes sir it'll kill you you do something wrong you're doing something wrong and this letter will kill you and some of you come to church you give your heart to the lord it's everything's okay but you begin to hear the word begins to kill you before you know it you don't want to come to church anymore why because the kill body doesn't stop right there it says that the spirit gives you life and if you want life to be in the Kingdom you let that letter kill you cuz you got to read the letter everybody has to read this letter this was a letter sent from God and it'll kill so many Desires in brother pis till the letter kill and the Bible says when when the worshiper is once cleansed he has no more desire of sin why because the spirit gives life not it's his spirit I know that he has changed my heart and my spirit it's my Same Spirit it hasn't changed in a sense but in another sense my spirit has been transferred has been changed it has been shown something it has nature the nature of the world nature of the holy spirit in my life that's what changes and the spirit makes you free that's Spirit not just because you you you you spoke in tongues and that's all right if you speak in tongues not because you prophesied not because you preached not because you're a good J no but until this letter kills the sacrifice must be killed we must die but we shouldn't stay dead that's why a lot of people read the message and they're dead they never get the life but when we are buried with him so resurrect we must come up we must resurrect with him for he is our savior he is our lord of every tongue of every nation of every language all right amen s in the ministry of death written and engraved on Stones was glorious so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of the glory of his countenance which Glory was passing away you think that Ministry was glorious watch this one how will the ministry of the spirit not be more glorious how many can see a glorious Ministry amen now remember Moses veiled his and and uh the things of God are still veiled maybe not out here let me tell you something even though the Revelation has been given there Still Remains a supernatural thing there there's a little Supernatural right there we we we preach here fine we got to preach here we also got to preach here but there's a supernatural thing here amen it's called Supernatural gospel let me quote to you what brother Brenham said he said witches and warlocks again brasas no more about the supernatural than most preachers they know more about it the supernatural frightens hear me ex me this ministry more glorious glor amen than that of Moses that's what the B that's what Paul wrote here how will the ministry of the spirit not be more glorious for in the ministry of condemnation had Glory the ministry of righteousness exceeds M more much more in glory much for even what was made glorious had no glory in this respect because of the glory that excels amen now watch this when the son of man came and I understand the son of man is the Lord Jesus Christ amen he came how many believe he came I believe he came he planted the Original Seed and he was going to use the voice because brother Bram says I am the voice of God to you but then we read it's the voice of many Waters and we heard brother Fabio bring to us the message whener came he was not by himself but the servants were with him let me let me tell you something when Elijah was commanded to go to the Widow's home the Bible says that God had already commanded the Widow had G his Commandments to the Widow but the Widow didn't know nothing about it yet we don't know that God had given the Commandments when God said let there be light the light has to come it might not come right away has to come because God gave the Commandment the woman God said there's a widow that shall sustain the like the Widow didn't know nothing about but when the prophet Drew near there was something about the prophet that got the attention of the Widow poor man I'll give him a drink of water but how selfish was that man how selfish that woman had enough food for one meal and for her son and then they were going to die right sometimes our wallets have money and we're asked for a little bit of money to help the kingdom said I ain't going to give no money that's right but if you were like the Widow that Elijah came to she would give him I want you to notice what these men said to her make me some bread make I mean the man was looking out for hisas but what was he really looking for that what what made the woman recognize that that man was God's anointed what made you recognize who your pastor is who made you recognize that brother Bram was the prophet I gave them the Revelation oh no you might have Spen to him but the revelation has to be commanded by God and that woman will receive that and when she receives them it's not a chffa revelation that's the problem today second hand Revelation amen but this woman when she got that this was the word of Elijah he says you bake me that cake and I I'll guarantee you that as long as there is famine in the land you will always have that Cru of oil you'll always have that meal offering I'm G say that again as long as long as you do as long as you give me first is that the way it works with you me first and then them no no no it's God first then your family you don't put your family over God God first God says give me God says give me a woman she has been commanded she didn't know it but in her heart a seed had been planted who put it there the almighty God Elijah I have commanded a widow woman to sustain thee no that she was widow she had not divorced her husband brother Bram says that her husband was waiting for her in glory where are those Ravens that will keep the voice of Elijah alive well I know what he'll do with that money you buy him a new car it's funny that you can drive a new car but the pastor can I drive a new car let me tell you a little story one day brother Bram got on this train and and uh no he didn't stay at the chafa easy8 or if you guys stay the at the e chaaa no brother didn't get on the train and how many know what the is he went pman and boy this preacher was there and he was burning up brother Larry Larry he was hot he wanted to preach the prophet of message and he says uh you know me yo yo I don't ride in pulman know pman no I sit down in a seat and and I take care of God's money brother Brenham goes that's fine brother I'm taking care of God's men you you you you yeah you won't clap to then let me cl for it that's right well isn't that right I can see but don't I got to stop here because I won't finish I got to finish right now that's fine that's fine I know come on that's fine you know we understand but I I also understand that there was many widows in in the time of Elijah but Elijah only came to one of cuz God had commanded her and she recognized God's Prophet first the prophet and then you and you won't run out let me tell you I am a witness of won't run out but you got to meet God's requir you think it was easy when God told me to give him my son and he went to Colorado he's been there two and a half years he started out with two people right now he's got Bible studies in Denver he's got Bible studies in Kenyon cityy City he goes into the prison he baptized for Les Sunday in the prison and in his church he baptized for more B he has meetings in Colorado Springs and he works days in a barber shop and the man at first the man says daddy take me home today he tells me Daddy everything's all right everything's all right d but you know what he takes he takes sacrifice you want something from God don't let them give it to you in a golden play sacrifice to God meet the requirement that God requires I guarantee you that there will always be oil and they'll get that meal offering there always be forgive me that I holler and sometimes it's hard to understand but I can help it on that way you can catch a little bit he's having a hard time hearing me with that fan up back here let me read a quote I'm finishing I'm going to read a quote from the unveiling of God how many believe that the Mighty God has been unveiled the mystery of God should be finished there shouldn't be no mystery left but why is there so much confusion among because the teachers like this Revelation amen not the people no the leaders they like this Revelation why do they say that in that church and who do they think they are it's not who we think we are who we are what we think I don't play with the devil no more I used to say well I'm nobody well you're nobody what are you doing here we are somebody we are a peuli people we are God's chosen people we are his chosen people we are his generation we are the kingdom because we have been transferred from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of his dear son and if you don't believe me and believe God but Jesus Christ says you believe in God believe also in me and where is he there's the problem look for him in the desert look for him in the secret chamber he's not there or is he he's veiled again amen When you pray pray like this likeing come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven these Thunders they thundered from the earth not from the not from heaven from the earth that old man he brought it back amen the horizontal rainbow brought it all the way down amen job where were you jod where were you brother Larry where were you Larry when he laid the foundations where were you I know where I was at when he placed the foundation I was in Egypt but he had already commanded the Widow to sustain him where were you can you declare to me where you were in Egypt yes in the world yes but he had already commanded Elijah said I am left alone said no no no no no no there's some others that I have commanded to feed thee there's others there we become part of him as you are the veil that veils him I don't care if it's a Mexican Veil it's a black veil it's a yellow Veil it's a red Veil it's the veil that keeps the people from seeing him amen amen as long as Christ is in you as Christ was of God because God was in him made him God and as Christ is in you the hope of glory you become part of Christ that's the anointing amen amen I want you to keep that that's the anointing he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he also let me repeat that again he that believeth in me works that I do shall he do also brother B said you can do No Greater Works than Jesus but it will be more there is more in the Kingdom amen watch this you become part of Christ as long as Christ is here in you let's the anointing then it's veiled to the unbeliever but you know he is in you I'm G say that again you know he in you you know he is in you do you know that that he is in you or or haven't you let him come in if he is in you you become the veil God is God isling Behind the Veil The Veil again in human flesh hides God the word from the unbeliever Christ in you Christ in you portion of God in you amen amen amen if you recognize this then this is a glorious Ministry and I'm going to finish with that why it's glorious how many want something from God this morning you want it from God I'm going to ask you I'm going to ask you a question have you received a prophet that's the first requirement how did you receive this prophet in whose name in a Blasphemous name in a Baptist name in the Apostolic Church name name in the name of a prophet that's the only way to receive it that's why they call us bramit we are not we are Christians but we have a leader amen amen I received a prophet in the name of a prophet and what do we receive a prophet's reward all that L you all that that you ever loved it shall be given to you brother says about he said Paul will answer for himself and what about irus he'll answer for his and he said this bite no they're not Brites what about Paul said Paul will answer for his he said I preach what Paul preach multitude and the wiow the wiow said we are resting amen amen but don't stop there he that receives a righteous [Music] man in the name oh to me this the sanctuary it ain't smoking brother it's bur name amen he that receives a righteous man in the name of the Baptist Church there's some people that would rather bring in Preachers out of there in here to preach to us no sir let them pass through a process then they can be then they can do it to be righteous he has to have on the breastplate he has to be array in fine linen amen he has to be consecrated to the service of the Lord you notice how the Levites were consecrated well this ministry is more glorious it's consecrated because the Throne of God has moved where is where is the say in heaven The Lord's Prayer is not right let thy will be done on Earth as it is in heav the will of God must be done on this Earth who's going to do it a righteous man and you receive a righteous man you'll also receive that righteous man's reward to finish I'm not going to finish this but to finish to finish this when ever when was ever in the history of the world world was the sons of God to be made manifest if not in this time manifestation is the same as Revelation they're going to be revealed he's going to reveal who is who amen who is who who do men say that I am well he says he's a preach some say he's an evangelist some say he's an apostle some say he's a teacher some say he's a pastor but whom do you say that I [Applause] am well we don't want to know who you are we want to know who Jesus is well you have to know where he's at brother B where is he he's hid behind flesh this is the veil that you want something from God let me quote to you what the prophet said he said I am so tired of hearing the voice of healing and all these crying out he said it says pray pray pray fast fast fast and brother Brenham says they holler for Jesus and they don't get anything why he said it's to be revealed in the Thunders you want something Jesus it's all right if you do if you met the requirement you'll know then you can say brother my house is falling apart listen I don't know what to do with my children anymore let me show you what happened to that seventh age according to the Bible it says that the sun
