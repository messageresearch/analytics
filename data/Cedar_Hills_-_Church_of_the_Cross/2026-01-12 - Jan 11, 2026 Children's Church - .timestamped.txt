[20:19] &gt;&gt; Wait, I don't think that's a bear.

[20:45] Trying to set the mood here, you know.
[20:51] Messed up my tent.
[20:55] Thanks, bro.
[21:13] There we go. Sorry, having some
[21:15] technical difficulties here.
[21:23] [sighs and gasps] Well, say good
[21:25] morning, but it's not morning time. You
[21:27] guys woke me up.
[21:30] You never wake up a bear from his nap.
[21:33] How are you guys doing this evening?
[21:36] Good.
[21:38] You sure?
[21:41] Yeah.
[21:42] Doing all right.
[21:45] Oh, who lit this fire? It's perfect.
[21:48] Nice and cold out here. You know what? I
[21:51] got an idea.
[21:53] How about you littles come over here and
[21:55] set up the fire where it's nice and
[21:56] warm.
[21:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. Let's go
[22:01] see how warm this fire is.
[22:08] Everybody take a seat. Okay. Crisscross
[22:10] applesauce.
[22:15] There you go. You guys can spread out a
[22:18] little bit. It's okay. Don't be too
[22:20] close to the fire. It's going to burn
[22:21] you.
[22:24] This is a real fire, you know.
[22:29] You know what? Oh, hey, little.
[22:33] I got something for you guys. Maybe not
[22:36] for everybody. I got some marshmallows.
[22:40] Who likes marshmallows?
[22:44] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[22:51] &gt;&gt; One for you.
[22:54] One for you.
[22:57] I might not have enough to go around for
[22:59] everybody, but
[23:02] yeah. Careful.
[23:12] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[23:24] this.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; Hey, be careful. You poke your eye out,
[23:30] kid.
[23:33] All right,
[23:36] &gt;&gt; one more marshmallow.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; Special little lady.
[23:43] &gt;&gt; All right, kids. Who's ready for story
[23:45] time?
[23:48] &gt;&gt; How many of you guys have been camping
[23:49] before?
[23:51] &gt;&gt; Raise your hands. Let me see.
[23:54] &gt;&gt; You've been camping? Yeah, you have.
[23:56] &gt;&gt; Cool. How many have ever read stories or
[23:58] told stories around the campfire?
[24:01] Yeah. Okay. I got a question. Who knows
[24:04] the difference between a fictional story
[24:08] and a non-fictional story?
[24:12] Sam, what does fiction mean?
[24:15] &gt;&gt; Fiction means not real. How many have
[24:17] heard stories that are not so real?
[24:20] Yeah, I've heard I've heard a lot of
[24:22] stories that are not real. like
[24:24] &gt;&gt; like I seen the biggest buck last
[24:26] weekend.
[24:30] &gt;&gt; And I almost had him,
[24:34] right? And then we heard real stories,
[24:37] right? How many have heard real stories
[24:39] before?
[24:41] I heard a ton of real stories this
[24:42] morning. Didn't you?
[24:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. There were some good ones, too,
[24:46] huh?
[24:48] So, I got a story for you guys.
[24:50] &gt;&gt; And it's no coincidence.
[24:54] &gt;&gt; It seems like God just does everything
[24:57] perfect, right?
[25:00] &gt;&gt; Hey, you're going to put out my fire
[25:01] with those marshmallows.
[25:05] &gt;&gt; All right, kiddos. I got this story for
[25:07] you.
[25:09] Joseph, the coat of many colors.
[25:13] Does that sound familiar?
[25:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah,
[25:17] &gt;&gt; brother Abraham.
[25:18] &gt;&gt; When did we hear that?
[25:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Abraham this morning.
[25:22] &gt;&gt; This morning, Brother Abraham shared
[25:24] that story with us.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; But we're going to make it a little more
[25:27] simpler for the little ones to
[25:28] understand. Deal. Okay. I need your
[25:32] guys' attention, though. You know, we
[25:34] got marshmallows. We got the fire going.
[25:36] It's nice and cozy.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; But now it's time to pay attention.
[25:40] Okay,
[25:42] &gt;&gt; let's do it.
[25:44] &gt;&gt; You got five. Cool.
[25:47] Long ago in the land of Canaan lived a
[25:50] man named Jacob. He had many animals. He
[25:54] also had many children. Of all his
[25:57] children, Jacob loved who the most?
[26:01] Joseph.
[26:03] To show his love, Jacob made a bright
[26:06] and colorful robe. You guys want to see
[26:09] the robe? Look, that's what it looks
[26:11] like right there.
[26:13] &gt;&gt; You see it? It looks different than the
[26:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it looks a little different.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; I didn't see that story.
[26:21] &gt;&gt; You didn't see that story?
[26:23] &gt;&gt; I didn't watch it.
[26:24] &gt;&gt; You've watched it?
[26:25] &gt;&gt; I watched it.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; You watched it, too?
[26:29] &gt;&gt; Joseph had how many older brothers?
[26:31] &gt;&gt; Um, like
[26:33] &gt;&gt; 12.
[26:34] &gt;&gt; Five.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; 11. There was 11 of them.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; A 20.
[26:41] &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay, I'm hearing all kinds of
[26:42] different answers.
[26:45] &gt;&gt; Hello, sir. Welcome to the party.
[26:49] &gt;&gt; Listen, when they found out that their
[26:51] father had given Joseph the special
[26:54] gift, they became jealous. They didn't
[26:57] like it.
[26:58] &gt;&gt; They wanted the coat for themselves.
[27:00] &gt;&gt; I don't.
[27:01] &gt;&gt; Later, Joseph had two dreams. Does
[27:04] anybody remember Joseph's dreams?
[27:06] &gt;&gt; Yes. I remember one.
[27:07] &gt;&gt; You remember one of the dreams? How many
[27:08] other
[27:09] &gt;&gt; you remember? Yeah, I do. I do.
[27:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; When he told his brothers about the
[27:15] dreams, they became even more upset.
[27:17] They were mad.
[27:19] &gt;&gt; Joseph said the dreams showed that his
[27:21] brothers would someday bow down to him.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; You think your dreams mean you will rule
[27:27] over us? That's what his brothers would
[27:28] say at him.
[27:30] Soon after Joseph's dreams, the brothers
[27:33] had to go to take care of the animals in
[27:35] the fields. They were gone for a long
[27:38] time. Jacob told Joseph, "Go and see if
[27:41] your brothers and the flock are well.
[27:44] Then come back and tell me what you've
[27:45] heard." When the brothers saw Joseph
[27:48] walking toward them, they saw he was
[27:51] wearing his special robe. They got angry
[27:54] all over again. When Joseph reached
[27:56] them, they ripped off his robe. They
[28:00] threw him into an empty pit and sat down
[28:04] to eat. Does that sound very nice?
[28:07] &gt;&gt; No.
[28:09] No. Could you imagine
[28:11] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine being a bully to your
[28:13] brother?
[28:14] &gt;&gt; Who here's a bully to their brother or
[28:16] sister?
[28:18] &gt;&gt; None of you guys bully, right? No.
[28:20] Nobody. You're not a bully, right?
[28:23] &gt;&gt; No.
[28:26] &gt;&gt; He's probably the biggest bully out of
[28:28] all my three.
[28:30] A group of traders passed by the flock.
[28:33] One brother said, "Let's sell our
[28:36] brother to the traitors."
[28:39] Oh, that's that's so wrong. We will get
[28:42] money and he will live. That's a wrong
[28:46] mentality to have towards your brother,
[28:47] right? That's not a good attitude.
[28:50] The brothers pulled Joseph out of the
[28:52] pit and they sold their brother to the
[28:55] traders for money.
[28:58] You hear that? They sold their brother
[29:01] to the traitors for money. 30 pieces,
[29:07] but what they tell their father? They
[29:10] killed a goat and they dipped his coat
[29:13] into the blood.
[29:16] &gt;&gt; And then they took the coat to their
[29:18] father.
[29:20] Uhhuh.
[29:21] He said, "It is my son's coat." Jacob
[29:24] cried. A wild animal must have killed
[29:27] him. Jacob wept and wept and he cried
[29:30] and he cried. He was so sad.
[29:34] &gt;&gt; Jacob's dad was so so sad.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Nothing could make him feel
[29:40] better. Meanwhile, Joseph had been sold
[29:44] as a slave in Egypt, but God was
[29:47] watching over him.
[29:50] A court official named Potafar bought
[29:55] Joseph and bought him in charge of all
[29:57] he owned. Then one day, Joseph was
[30:00] blamed for something he didn't do.
[30:06] In fact, Potafar was so angry he had
[30:10] Joseph thrown into Pharaoh's prison.
[30:13] Joseph shared a sale with two men who
[30:16] had been the Pharaoh's baker and the
[30:18] chief cup bearer. You guys want to see
[30:20] the picture?
[30:21] &gt;&gt; There's Joseph in prison with the two
[30:24] other prisoners.
[30:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Let me out. Let me out.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; During that time, the cup bearer had a
[30:33] dream. Joseph explained it to him. How
[30:36] many of you guys have dreams?
[30:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Do you guys have dreams?
[30:41] Do
[30:41] &gt;&gt; you guys you dream a lot?
[30:43] &gt;&gt; I I dream every night.
[30:45] &gt;&gt; You dream every night. Wow.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; What Joseph said came true. Soon Pharaoh
[30:52] forgave the cup bearer and returned him
[30:55] to his palace job.
[30:57] &gt;&gt; Hey guys, check this out. Check this
[30:59] out.
[31:00] Joseph spent two more years in jail.
[31:04] That's a long time.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; But God took care of him there. One
[31:09] night, Pharaoh had two dreams that
[31:12] troubled him. But there were no one in
[31:15] Egypt who could explain the dreams.
[31:19] Finally, the cup bearer remembered
[31:21] Joseph. He told Pharaoh a young man who
[31:25] was able to explain what dreams mean.
[31:31] Pharaoh sent for Joseph and had him
[31:34] listen to the dreams. Both dreams mean
[31:37] the same thing. Pharaoh. Joseph said,
[31:40] "God told you what will happen. There
[31:43] will be seven good years.
[31:46] Crops will grow and food will be
[31:48] plentiful. There'll be so much food.
[31:51] Then there will be seven bad years.
[31:56] Seven good years and then there will be
[31:58] seven bad years. The land will be dry
[32:01] and no food will grow. Everyone will be
[32:04] very hungry."
[32:07] Joseph suggested that Pharaoh select a
[32:10] wise man to collect food during the good
[32:12] years.
[32:15] The stored food would feed the people of
[32:17] Egypt during the bad years. Pharaoh
[32:21] liked the plan, so he put Joseph in
[32:23] charge. He ordered people to bow down to
[32:25] Joseph. Does that sound familiar?
[32:28] &gt;&gt; Pharaoh ordered people to bow down to
[32:30] Joseph. What does that sound like?
[32:33] &gt;&gt; King. like being a king.
[32:39] &gt;&gt; The dreams that he had, right? That made
[32:41] his brothers jealous of him.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; He ordered people to bow down to Joseph.
[32:48] Now only Pharaoh was greater among the
[32:50] people than Joseph.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the greatest person. That's
[32:56] right.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Everything happened just as if Jo
[33:04] just as Joseph has said it. During the
[33:07] next seven years, there was a wealth of
[33:09] crops. There was a lot of food. Who
[33:11] likes food?
[33:13] &gt;&gt; You guys like to eat? I love to eat.
[33:16] There is tons of food during these seven
[33:18] years. Yeah.
[33:21] &gt;&gt; During the next seven years, there was a
[33:22] wealth of crops. Joseph had the food
[33:25] gathered and stored.
[33:28] Then the seven years of plenty ended.
[33:32] During the next seven years, no food
[33:34] grew.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; That's That's terrible. But Joseph was
[33:39] smart.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; People cried from hunger in every
[33:43] country, but there was bread throughout
[33:45] Egypt.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; Go to Joseph, Pharaoh told his people,
[33:50] "Do what he says." Joseph opened the
[33:53] field and overflowing storehouses. He
[33:56] sold bread to people from all over the
[33:58] world. Back in Canaan, Jacob and his
[34:01] family needed food. He sent his sons to
[34:04] Egypt to buy bread. But Jacob kept his
[34:07] youngest brother, Benjamin, at home.
[34:11] He was afraid something bad might happen
[34:13] to him.
[34:17] The brothers finally came to Joseph
[34:21] and bowed down.
[34:23] They did not recognize him though. But
[34:26] Joseph recognized them.
[34:29] He pretended not to know them and asked
[34:31] who they were.
[34:33] We are honest men from Canaan. We are 12
[34:37] sons of one man. The youngest is with
[34:39] our father. One brother is no more. They
[34:42] said
[34:44] Joseph had a plan. He said
[34:47] they were spies and sent them to prison
[34:49] for three days. When they were allowed
[34:52] to go home, Joseph said they had to
[34:54] leave one brother, Simeon, in Egypt.
[34:57] Then they were to bring Benjamin back to
[35:01] prove they were telling the truth.
[35:03] Joseph had the money they used to buy a
[35:05] grain, but put inside the bags. On the
[35:08] way home, they found the money. They
[35:11] were sure they would get in trouble.
[35:19] When they got home, they told Joseph
[35:21] what happened. Jacob, Jacob, they told
[35:24] Jacob what happened. Jacob did not want
[35:26] to let Benjamin go back with them. But
[35:28] when the grain was gone, Jacob realized
[35:31] he had to let Benjamin go. He had no
[35:32] other option.
[35:35] The brothers returned to Joseph. When he
[35:37] saw Benjamin, Joseph had to leave the
[35:40] room.
[35:42] Want to see?
[35:45] He was happy and sad at the same time.
[35:48] They ate dinner.
[35:59] They ate dinner and Joseph had the sacks
[36:02] of grain prepared. The servants put the
[36:04] money in them like before, but this time
[36:08] he had them hide a silver cup in
[36:10] Benjamin's sack. The brothers started on
[36:13] their way home. Joseph sent guards to
[36:16] catch up with them and they told them
[36:18] that someone had stolen a silver cup.
[36:21] The brothers said, "We would never do
[36:23] that." Do you guys think that they were
[36:25] that they were lying?
[36:29] The guards searched the sacks. There was
[36:32] a silver cup. They took the brothers
[36:34] back to Joseph. The brothers fell to the
[36:37] ground before Joseph and begged him to
[36:40] let them go.
[36:42] What do you guys think happens next?
[36:49] &gt;&gt; What do you guys think happens next?
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Joseph agreed to let everyone go.
[36:59] Everyone except Benjamin. You're right.
[37:03] Since the cup was in his sack, he was to
[37:05] stay as Joseph's servant.
[37:08] The boy's father will die without him,
[37:10] cried the brothers. Joseph couldn't keep
[37:13] the secret any longer. He told them who
[37:15] he was.
[37:17] Do not worry. Check this out, guys. Do
[37:21] not worry, Joseph told his troubled
[37:23] brothers. It was God, not you,
[37:27] who sent me here. God made me Pharaoh's
[37:30] ruler over all the land to keep you
[37:33] alive.
[37:35] Joseph hugged Benjamin and wept. He
[37:38] kissed all of his brothers. He finally
[37:41] told them who he was. Could you imagine?
[37:44] Could you guys imagine? You have a
[37:46] brother and you sell him off and then
[37:50] that brother happens to become the king.
[37:54] Could you imagine that?
[37:58] And then you finally meet your brother
[38:00] again and you think, "Oh man, he's going
[38:02] to be so angry with me."
[38:05] &gt;&gt; But then that brother turns around and
[38:06] says, "I forgive you." Could you imagine
[38:08] that?
[38:12] &gt;&gt; Pharaoh told Joseph to move the whole
[38:15] family to Egypt. Pharaoh said, "I will
[38:18] give you the best land." Everyone in
[38:20] Jacob's family came to Egypt. Joseph
[38:23] greeted them. Jacob and Joseph were very
[38:26] happy to see each other again. And there
[38:28] they are again, reunited as brothers.
[38:32] Does that story sound familiar to you
[38:33] guys?
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah. What does it sound like?
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Tired.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; You're tired. You want to take a nap in
[38:43] the tent?
[38:47] &gt;&gt; What does that story sound like? It
[38:49] sounds so familiar to me.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; Anybody?
[38:54] Yeah, it's the same story this morning,
[38:56] but it sounds like someone else. I just
[38:57] can't put my finger on it.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; Maybe Jesus. Didn't Jesus have friends
[39:05] that betrayed him?
[39:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Didn't they Didn't he sell him
[39:13] off, too? Yeah.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Senpected
[39:19] him and he wanted Satan wanted to be
[39:21] more powerful. And finally, when Jesus
[39:23] was on the cross, what did he say? It
[39:24] sounds a lot like what Joseph said.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Forgive them. They don't know what
[39:31] &gt;&gt; forgive them for they know not what they
[39:33] do. Exactly. Joseph is a perfect type of
[39:36] Jesus. You guys are really having fun
[39:38] with those marshmallows.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; You want to take a nap? I want to take a
[39:43] nap, too. I'm tired. But that thing
[39:45] isn't really made for a grown man.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[39:51] Okay, everybody. I just want to thank
[39:53] you guys. Okay, you guys did a wonderful
[39:54] job listening to the story. Did you guys
[39:56] all learn?
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. What did you guys learn? Tell me.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; They learned marshmallows are good.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Joseph is a dreamer.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[40:19] Yeah.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah, sure. What's up, bro?
[40:24] &gt;&gt; I learned that we need to
[40:27] even though they tell you, even though
[40:29] they bullied you,
[40:31] &gt;&gt; right? Amen. That's the truth, bro.
[40:34] Forgive.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; We need to share forgiveness with
[40:36] everybody, no matter what.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; All righty. Thank you guys so much. You
[40:40] guys can go take your seats, okay? And
[40:42] be careful with your marshmallows. And
[40:44] be careful on the stairs. [applause]
[40:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah, we need to put this fire out.
[40:55] Can we have a son of God stop the sun
[40:56] again? Turn the lights back on.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; All righty, everybody. I just want to
[41:04] thank you so much for gathering around
[41:07] the campfire with me and hopefully we
[41:09] get to see each other again. Okay. God
[41:11] bless you guys. I'm going to go take a
[41:13] nap now.
[41:15] [applause]
[41:38] Amen. Let's give another hand for our
[41:39] brother Sam. Would y'all please stand,
[41:42] please?
[41:43] Hey, man. How many? Dang, you guys
[41:45] really taking a lot of marshmallows.
[41:47] Oh, okay. Let's sing that song. I'll fly
