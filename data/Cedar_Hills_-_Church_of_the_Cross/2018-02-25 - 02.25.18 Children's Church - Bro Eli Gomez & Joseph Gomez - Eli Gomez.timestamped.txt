[15:41] given me a the shield of salvation and
[15:44] thy gentleness has have made me whole
[15:47] great
[15:49] who knows what a hind is a hind is a
[15:58] type of deer that it can climb up any
[16:01] mountain that it comes across who has
[16:04] goals that they would like to accomplish
[16:05] today well with God he can accomplish
[16:12] those goals for you he can set you in
[16:15] your high places and the scripture is
[16:19] talking about how with God anything is
[16:21] possible for example Samson was just a
[16:27] normal dude but he surrendered to God he
[16:31] surrendered he said it he surrendered to
[16:34] God and need to mighty things he ripped
[16:36] a line in half and lifted up iron fence
[16:39] by himself the battle is the Lord
[16:43] belonged to the Lord or Moses Moses was
[16:49] just a man and he stuttered a lot and he
[16:52] was scared to talk to people but he
[16:54] surrendered to God and he delivered the
[16:57] children of Israel to destroyed the
[17:00] young the Egyptian army or David David
[17:07] was just a boy and brother Rigo said
[17:10] that brother branham said that he's just
[17:12] a boy but he he took down a giant
[17:18] that was talking bad about our Lord
[17:21] so don't think so don't think you have
[17:24] to battle alone no more cuz God is on
[17:26] your side and he holds the victory god
[17:28] bless you him glory
[17:48] can you stand up to your feet I haven't
[17:51] heard anything that great and all week
[17:53] and I'm just so excited that God is
[17:56] alive and he's powerful and he's great
[17:59] and he's in our midst and he's the
[18:01] greatest thing that we could ever hope
[18:02] for to be in our lives and in our hearts
[18:05] and he's here tonight how many just
[18:07] loved the Lord with all of your heart a
[18:09] man welcome to children's church welcome

[18:14] it's so good to see all of you so good
[18:17] to be in his house isn't it tonight well
[18:19] I guess I should introduce myself I'm
[18:22] kind of rude just coming up here not
[18:24] introducing myself god bless you
[18:26] everyone it's good to see all the little
[18:28] ones up front but I you may be seated my
[18:33] name is Professor Leviticus can everyone
[18:37] say professor Leviticus professor
[18:41] Leviticus and that is my name yes
[18:44] professor Leviticus and I am so excited
[18:47] to be here in first of all I guess I
[18:49] should I should mention before I get too
[18:51] far along how I came to be known as
[18:54] Professor Leviticus is an interesting
[18:57] story you see
[18:59] well my parents the name they gave me
[19:01] was Levi Alexander Cornelius okay and my
[19:06] first day at school so I come to school
[19:09] right then the teacher says come up and
[19:10] introduce yourselves everyone and
[19:12] everyone comes up and there was like a
[19:15] billy and a Jane and a Suzy right and I
[19:18] come up and I say my name is is Levi
[19:21] Alexander Cornelius and my teacher says
[19:25] I'm sorry come again and I say my name
[19:27] is Levi Alexander Cornelius and she says
[19:31] very well we shall call you Davidic is
[19:33] for sure
[19:34] take a seat so
[19:35] that is why I came to be known as the
[19:37] Vedic s and today I'm professor
[19:40] Leviticus and and I think it's important
[19:42] for me to tell you as well that I used
[19:44] to be a teacher in school and they would
[19:47] teach biology and the math and the
[19:49] English who goes to school everybody who
[19:53] went to school okay so you know what I
[19:56] mean when I say biology and and math and
[19:59] English right and and I was doing okay
[20:02] for some time but after a while I began
[20:04] to be discouraged who's been discouraged
[20:07] before about something anything you've
[20:09] been do so you know how I felt okay
[20:11] you know I've felt about being
[20:12] discouraged and the reason I was
[20:14] discouraged is that I began to tell the
[20:18] little children about biology about the
[20:22] trees and I was excited I love talking
[20:24] about trees and the rocks and the grass
[20:26] and and as I would look at my students
[20:28] everybody was falling asleep and I would
[20:31] say oh look at the beautiful trees and
[20:33] this tree is then the Elm and this is
[20:35] the the fir and this one and yawn and
[20:38] everybody was just yawning in my
[20:40] classroom and I would say the birds and
[20:43] all you're on and the bees Oh double
[20:46] yarn and they just get we're just
[20:48] getting border and border so I said what
[20:51] am I going to do yes thank you
[20:53] so somebody one day came to me and told
[20:56] me Leviticus I know what your problem is
[20:59] I said what is my problem and he said
[21:01] kids aren't excited about biology and
[21:04] about math and 2+2 in 10 times 10 and
[21:08] they get tired of it but you need to
[21:11] change what you're teaching you need to
[21:14] tell people about Jesus because Jesus is
[21:17] the most exciting thing in the whole
[21:19] wide world
[21:20] and I guarantee you Leviticus if you go
[21:22] around traveling the countryside and you
[21:24] find houses of God like this one like
[21:27] Cedar Hills Church of the Cross I
[21:28] guarantee you you go in there and you
[21:30] talk about Jesus people are gonna be on
[21:32] their feet people are gonna be excited
[21:35] because he's the greatest thing that
[21:36] ever happened to the
[21:38] and I said hmm it's a great idea
[21:42] so I began traveling the country and now
[21:45] I give my gospel journeys with Professor
[21:48] Leviticus so who's excited tonight about
[21:50] the gospel journey that God has for us
[21:53] amen so what I would like to do I would
[21:56] like to tell you first of all my thought
[22:00] tonight and what I'm going to be
[22:01] teaching from the gospel now who knows
[22:03] that the gospel is simply the good news
[22:05] this is the good news so the gospel
[22:08] tonight is lift Jesus higher lift Jesus
[22:13] higher higher lift him higher we need to
[22:18] lift them higher so two questions I want
[22:21] to answer for all of you tonight I know
[22:23] you have burning questions in your heart
[22:25] that's why you're here that's why you've
[22:27] come to receive from what the Lord has
[22:29] for you to know you have burning
[22:31] questions in your heart lift Jesus
[22:32] higher so two things I want to answer
[22:35] for us is number one how how do we lift
[22:39] Jesus higher number two is why I'm very
[22:45] thirsty forgive me why is it that we
[22:48] live Jesus higher so we know he must be
[22:51] lifted up Jesus himself says if I be
[22:54] lifted up I will draw all men unto me
[22:56] all men unto me and that's important
[22:59] today because everybody deserves a
[23:01] chance to see Jesus who agrees with me
[23:04] everybody deserves the chance we
[23:06] shouldn't harden to ourselves that's why
[23:08] our pastor is going across the ocean to
[23:12] share the gospel to lift Jesus higher
[23:14] that's why our prophet William Branham
[23:16] he traveled around the world seven times
[23:19] sharing the gospel so that he could be
[23:21] lifted up so I'm going to teach you
[23:23] children today how is it that we lift
[23:25] him up and very importantly why we lift
[23:29] up Jesus and who's ready to learn from
[23:33] the gospel tonight yes very good so I
[23:36] want you to stand to your feet I'm going
[23:39] to read the scripture first of all in
[23:41] this scripture it's going to help us
[23:44] understand how we lift him up now I did
[23:47] want to if they could put up a picture
[23:50] because I think somebody
[23:51] one day had a bright idea that they
[23:53] would lift Jesus higher and this is what
[23:56] they did
[23:57] isn't that amazing has anyone seen that
[24:00] statue that's Christ the Redeemer who
[24:02] has seen that statue anyone in the front
[24:05] have you seen that statue that's in
[24:07] Brazil so Christ the Redeemer somebody
[24:10] had a bright idea it's lift Jesus higher
[24:13] but I only I have a problem with that
[24:15] it's beautiful yes it's beautiful
[24:18] but that's not Jesus that's just the
[24:21] rock that's shaped like Jesus but it's
[24:24] not really Jesus and it doesn't do
[24:26] anybody good everybody that lives around
[24:28] that mountain probably one of the most
[24:30] sinful places in the world who's not
[24:33] doing anybody any good it's not how you
[24:35] lift Jesus higher so do we want to find
[24:38] out how we lift Jesus higher how he
[24:42] meant to be lifted higher okay then
[24:44] let's read the scripture I want you to
[24:45] turn with me to the Book of Isaiah who
[24:49] has their Bibles you bring your Bible
[24:51] with you
[24:52] it's your most important tool you need
[24:55] to bring your Bible with you so Isaiah
[24:57] chapter 12 Isaiah chapter 12 and we're
[25:02] gonna read verses 2 to 5 keep in mind
[25:05] lift Jesus higher one thing I forgot to
[25:07] mention very quickly one thing I forgot
[25:10] to mention we have a word of the day
[25:12] who likes words of the day with
[25:15] professor in Leviticus we always get a
[25:16] word of the day the word today is
[25:19] salvation
[25:20] repeat with me salvation louder
[25:24] salvation salvation okay so what I what
[25:28] I want you to do when you hear
[25:29] throughout the day throughout this short
[25:32] afternoon I'm not gonna be here all day
[25:33] I promise but throughout this afternoon
[25:36] I want you to when you hear the word of
[25:39] the day which is salvation take your
[25:41] seats really quickly really quickly take
[25:42] your seats
[25:43] so the word of the day is salvation when
[25:46] you hear salvation I need you to stand
[25:49] to your feet and I need you to say Amen
[25:52] thank you Jesus
[25:54] okay let's practice stand to your feet
[25:58] amen thank you Jesus oh well that's when
[26:01] you hear the word of the day let's sit
[26:03] down again we're going to practice
[26:04] practice run because it's important for
[26:07] the word of the day are you ready all
[26:10] right
[26:12] salamander okay you got to pay attention
[26:16] it's the only word of the day there's no
[26:19] other word
[26:19] okay you ready again are you ready
[26:25] Sacajawea no that's not the word of the
[26:29] day very good you're paying attention I
[26:30] love it I love when my class pays
[26:32] attention okay salvation a man thank you
[26:38] Jesus
[26:39] one more time one more time Salvage oh I
[26:45] almost got you all right one more time
[26:48] salvation salvation yes a man thank you
[26:53] Jesus all right good everybody's got it
[26:56] awesome job everyone remember where did
[26:59] the day's salvation amen thank you Jesus
[27:02] okay so we're in chapter 12 verse 2 and
[27:07] it starts off behold god is my salvation
[27:14] yes he is he's my salvation i will trust
[27:17] i will not be afraid for the lord
[27:21] jehovah my strength my song he also has
[27:25] become my salvation very good yes
[27:30] he's our i can see that you agree with
[27:33] me there's nothing greater he's my
[27:35] salvation yes amen and in that day shall
[27:40] ye say praise the Lord yes praise the
[27:46] Lord
[27:46] little Jonah knows what it's all about
[27:49] praise the Lord
[27:50] call upon his name declare his comings
[27:54] among the people declare his doings
[27:57] I apologize among the people make
[28:00] mention that his name is exalted seeing
[28:03] unto the Lord for he have done excellent
[28:06] things this is known in all of the earth
[28:08] so there's some clues in the scripture
[28:11] that we just read what is our theme lift
[28:13] Jesus
[28:14] higher lift him higher so how do we lift
[28:18] him higher well the truth is the answers
[28:22] are all in God's Word if he tells us
[28:24] lift him higher then there's a way to
[28:26] lift him higher so let's find it in the
[28:30] scriptures and in that day shall ye say
[28:33] praise the Lord now it ends that all the
[28:36] earth knows all the earth knows this now
[28:39] the only way all the earth is going to
[28:40] know this is if you and you and you and
[28:44] you somebody that knows him somebody
[28:46] that has received their salvation
[28:51] somebody that has received their
[28:53] salvation has told them the good news of
[28:56] the gospel so in here I find four ways
[28:59] who can count to four four ways one two
[29:03] three four four ways how we can lift
[29:06] Jesus higher it says praise the Lord we
[29:09] lift him higher in praise who comes to
[29:12] service just to sit on the Pew who comes
[29:15] to service to yarn Oh who comes to see
[29:19] somebody else your brother your sister
[29:21] no we come to worship Him and praise him
[29:26] so we lift him
[29:27] with praises then it says declare his
[29:32] doings among the people make mention
[29:35] that his name is exalted I skipped one
[29:39] sorry call upon his name how do we call
[29:42] upon his name in prayer we get down on
[29:45] our knees and we pray to God and that's
[29:47] how we lift him higher in our lives
[29:49] that's how we make him known in our
[29:51] lives call upon his name that's number
[29:54] two praise prayer number three declare
[29:57] his doings among the people make mention
[30:00] that his name is exalted what's he
[30:02] talking about
[30:03] that's the preaching of the gospel the
[30:06] gospel of salvation the gospel of
[30:10] salvation amen declare his doings among
[30:16] the people and that's exactly what we
[30:18] are doing today we're declaring what
[30:21] he's done what he's doing today what
[30:23] he's going to do number three preaching
[30:27] so we have praise prayer preaching
[30:28] number four sing unto the Lord for he
[30:33] hath onyx excellent things this is known
[30:36] in all the earth so who likes to sing so
[30:41] number four we praise him in song if the
[30:44] Lord is giving you music a song
[30:47] inspiration that is how you lift him
[30:49] higher lift him higher and higher so
[30:52] preaching praising praying and in song
[30:56] can we all do that that's easy enough
[30:59] yes yes he's called us all to do that
[31:03] because that is our salvation it is our
[31:07] salvation
[31:09] that's exactly how God becomes our
[31:12] salvation yes
[31:16] thank you lord alright next so I
[31:20] promised you that I would answer two
[31:21] questions is that right
[31:23] so now we know how to lift him up who's
[31:27] learned something today do you think so
[31:29] how we lift them up preaching praise
[31:31] prayer in song we know how we lift him
[31:34] up wherever you go not just in church
[31:36] but you want to praise him in school in
[31:40] work wherever you are you're going to
[31:42] praise the Lord by preaching by praising
[31:46] him by praying to him in song now the
[31:49] most important part today that I need to
[31:52] get you is how or is why why do we need
[31:55] to lift him up now we're gonna get a
[31:59] little bit serious just because this is
[32:02] important that we grab on to this and we
[32:04] take it with us because the why is so
[32:07] important if we go out to the world and
[32:10] we're praising and preaching it and
[32:13] we're doing all of that and we don't
[32:15] know we don't know why then eventually
[32:18] it's gonna get boring like biology right
[32:20] it's gonna get boring like math why is
[32:23] it that we do it why why did why does he
[32:26] need us to do it so I invite you whoever
[32:28] wants to come to come sit up here cuz
[32:31] I'm going to tell you a story
[32:32] who wants to come sit up here with me
[32:34] anybody come sit up here the little ones
[32:36] come up come sit up here with me because
[32:38] I want to tell you story and the reason
[32:40] I want you up here is because it gets
[32:42] pretty serious okay and it's important
[32:45] that you understand why is it that we
[32:50] need to lift Jesus up are you guys
[32:52] interested in learning why is it that we
[32:55] lift him up so it involves a story okay
[32:57] and I really enjoy telling stories and I
[33:00] hope you can see that I'm excited to
[33:02] tell you the story except this story is
[33:04] not one of those that gives you the the
[33:06] fuzzy Fillies the nice you know cuddly
[33:10] teddy bear type feelings and it's not
[33:12] one of those stories I'm really sorry
[33:13] but it's not one of those stories
[33:15] although it's one of the most the most
[33:19] important story that you all need to
[33:20] understand and know okay so you guys are
[33:22] ready to hear this story okay
[33:24] this story comes right from the gospel
[33:26] right from the Bible it's important that
[33:28] you understand that Winry
[33:29] this Bible I have a really big Bible
[33:32] there too but that one is very heavy so
[33:35] I'm not going to pick it up right now
[33:36] okay so it's important to know that when
[33:39] you read this and you read who knows
[33:41] that there's an Old Testament there's a
[33:42] New Testament yes when you read the Old
[33:44] Testament it's like foreshadowing
[33:47] who knows what foreshadowing is anyone
[33:49] first out it means that that it's like a
[33:51] sign like when you see a sign that says
[33:53] bump ahead then you slow down the car
[33:55] right well I don't think any of you
[33:56] drive right but but anyway so if you you
[34:00] don't have a she doesn't have a driver's
[34:02] license so I kind of figured that much
[34:04] but just just for illustration when you
[34:07] see the bump sign then you slow down
[34:09] because something's coming so the Old
[34:11] Testament is full of such things it
[34:13] tells us something's coming something
[34:15] great is coming just wait for it it's
[34:17] coming though and that's why I love to
[34:19] read God's Word it's so exciting to see
[34:21] so there's a story in the Old Testament
[34:23] and the story is about Moses who knows
[34:27] Moses yes he did he spit the Red Sea see
[34:31] this is why I love this did the children
[34:33] love the stories from the Bible they
[34:35] loved the Lord so he split the Red Sea
[34:37] and he delivered the children of Israel
[34:44] sure did yes he turned the river to
[34:48] blood yes he did he turned the stick
[34:53] into a snake very interesting this is
[34:55] where we're headed so he the children of
[34:58] Israel saw many signs and wonders many
[35:01] things had been done but they get in
[35:03] this journey they're on their way to the
[35:05] promised land and they get very tired
[35:07] and they need water and they're hot and
[35:11] they just can't take it anymore they're
[35:13] tired of traveling right and yes 40
[35:17] years see he knows it's 40 years they're
[35:19] traveling so who would be tired after
[35:21] traveling for 40 years anyone here would
[35:23] you be tired
[35:24] I would so be tired so so they're tired
[35:27] and they began to complain who complains
[35:31] here oh I hate this cereal oh this oh
[35:35] this shirt is horrible I don't want to
[35:38] wear it who complains oh I need new
[35:41] shoes these are ugly
[35:43] right we all complain so the children of
[35:47] Israel started to complain and they said
[35:49] Moses you brought us out here to die
[35:52] didn't you
[35:53] we're tired of this food you have us on
[35:56] the diet
[35:57] there's no Chicken McNugget I know but
[36:04] you know what I mean you know when you
[36:05] really like there's there's no whopper
[36:08] jr. and that they're very thirsty and
[36:13] they're very hungry and all they had was
[36:15] this light fluffy bread
[36:16] I mean God was so good that it fell from
[36:18] the sky every night but they were so
[36:20] tired of it they were didn't want any
[36:22] more they weren't he wanted something
[36:24] else so they begin to complain and they
[36:27] begin to be very bad people just
[36:29] complain so what does God do very true
[36:41] put up the picture for me he he sent
[36:45] fiery serpents in to the people snakes
[36:49] who's afraid of snakes they're horrible
[36:52] right snakes are horrible look at that
[36:54] thing yes yes he sent snakes in among
[36:57] them they're sitting and they're
[36:59] sleeping and here comes snakes and the
[37:00] snakes were biting them he said this is
[37:02] not a very fun story but I have to tell
[37:04] it to get to my point okay they they
[37:07] begin to fight them and the people begin
[37:10] to die they have to come to Moses and
[37:12] they said Moses we have sinned we're
[37:14] sorry
[37:14] so this serpent it was a type of their
[37:18] sinning they're complaining and God's
[37:21] remedy was Moses just put up a brazen
[37:24] serpent like this one in the picture
[37:26] put it up and anyone that looks at it
[37:28] all they have to do is look at it and
[37:30] they're going to be saved they're not
[37:31] going to die so he obeyed God it was up
[37:35] to the people to obey God to so he was
[37:37] testing their faith because how strange
[37:39] is that how is that going to save us
[37:41] from death how is that going to cure our
[37:43] snake bite but you see the very thing
[37:46] that Moses put up the very thing that
[37:48] was killing them they needed to see it
[37:51] they needed to see it powerless they
[37:54] needed to see it not living
[37:56] stripped of any power and they needed to
[37:58] see it raised up to give them courage
[38:00] and they needed to obey the voice of God
[38:02] so they looked and they lived and anyone
[38:07] that was bit all they had to do was look
[38:09] at the serpent that Moses had raised so
[38:12] remember I told you foresee how do we
[38:16] remember I told you
[38:17] foreshadowing so this is telling us
[38:19] simply telling us something great is
[38:21] coming who believes something great is
[38:23] coming their salvation that's funny
[38:27] salvation is coming so they needed
[38:31] saving they needed us out a savior this
[38:36] is foreshadowing so I want us to turn to
[38:39] the New Testament yes young lady god did
[38:45] God created this fiery serpents he sent
[38:48] him among the people because they were
[38:49] not being obedient they were complaining
[38:52] and it was a type of their sin and we
[38:56] know what sin is if we don't believe God
[38:58] we don't believe his word then we are
[39:00] sinning we are sinful we need to repent
[39:03] and that's all they did they repented
[39:05] they said Moses we know we sin we need a
[39:07] savior we need salvation we need it
[39:10] yes salvation we need it amen thank you
[39:14] Jesus yes so we need a savior so in John
[39:19] now this is this is where we're coming
[39:21] to this is why we need to lift him up
[39:24] who has their Bibles John chapter 3
[39:27] verse 14 if you're fine you're fine here
[39:31] you can yes you can get it if you want
[39:34] to follow along very good children John
[39:38] chapter 3 verse 14 through verse 15 now
[39:46] John chapter 3 verse 14 verse 15 this is
[39:52] why he must be lifted up this is Jesus
[39:58] talking and he says just like Moses and
[40:01] as Moses lifted up the serpent in the
[40:04] wilderness even so must the Son of Man
[40:08] be lifted up
[40:10] there's one other must in this chapter
[40:13] who knows what it is there's one other
[40:15] must in this chapter who knows what it
[40:18] is something that you have to do there's
[40:22] one other place in this chapter where he
[40:23] says you must you must be born again you
[40:28] must be born again so he's telling us
[40:30] for the second time he wants us to be
[40:34] born again no conditions you must you
[40:36] have to do it you have to become a new
[40:38] creature in Christ so he tells us here
[40:41] this is the way you the Son of Man must
[40:44] be lifted up he must be lifted up
[40:48] there's no way around it that whosoever
[40:51] who's whosoever who's he talking to in
[40:54] the air whosoever believeth in him
[40:57] should not perish but shall have eternal
[41:00] life that is salvation a man thank you
[41:06] Jesus yes that is salvation so Jesus
[41:11] Christ he came and yes thank you
[41:16] just like the brazen serpent he said I
[41:19] must be lifted up that whosoever
[41:21] believeth in me can you put the
[41:23] crucifixion should not perish so this is
[41:27] the thing we were all born come here
[41:30] come here Ruben to me come here to me so
[41:33] we were all born with this thing called
[41:35] this flesh right this is our flesh now
[41:38] we can't see the real Ruben he's in here
[41:40] somewhere he's hidden away but this is
[41:43] the Ruben that we can see and this is
[41:45] the one that we were born with right
[41:46] this is your flesh and that's how Jesus
[41:50] Christ came he came in the same type of
[41:52] body we have in the skin and even though
[41:57] Ruben wants to do many great things he
[41:59] wants to do good things he wants to be a
[42:00] good boy I know he does sometimes this
[42:03] guy is so bad he lies and he cheats and
[42:07] he steals and he doesn't do what's right
[42:10] and this Ruben in here he feels really
[42:12] bad I don't mean to tickle you I'm sorry
[42:14] he feels really bad in here okay so the
[42:19] very thing that's killing us this guy
[42:22] out here you
[42:24] knows you get older you can eat weeds
[42:26] burdensome he's heavy and he weighs on
[42:29] you every day but there's a way to
[42:31] salvation there's a way to Liberty the
[42:37] very thing that's killing us the very
[42:39] thing that's hurting us the sin all
[42:42] around us it's been raised high it's
[42:46] been lifted up and we can see it right
[42:48] there it's bruised it's being it's
[42:51] helpless the life is gone out of it and
[42:54] there's been a victory over this thing
[42:56] that's killing us the very reason he was
[42:59] raised up is because it's a cursed thing
[43:02] the Bible says anything that's cursed is
[43:04] hangs on a tree the reason being if you
[43:08] can understand me a curse is something
[43:10] that shouldn't have been the earth
[43:12] didn't want it the heaven didn't want it
[43:14] so it's been lifted up and for our eyes
[43:17] it gives us hope and it gives us peace
[43:20] that this - this flesh that God gave us
[43:25] that's we're born with it's cursed
[43:27] but there's a victory over it we can see
[43:30] that we can win and how do we know that
[43:32] he won he he won and that's why he's
[43:35] lifted up if we lift him up through
[43:37] preaching through praising through song
[43:39] then everyone else can see that there's
[43:41] hope and they're gonna come to know
[43:43] Jesus but how do we know he wants mom
[43:47] and dad how do we know he won because we
[43:50] see it there it's lifeless it's being
[43:52] it's bloody and it had to die but he
[43:55] raised it up he lifted him up for
[43:57] everyone to see that there's hope but
[43:59] how do we know that he won did he win he
[44:04] did save us this is the way he saved us
[44:06] because he gave his life for us he gave
[44:09] it for us for our salvation he gave it
[44:14] for us but my final question how do we
[44:18] know he won how do we know he won yes
[44:22] it's in the Bible how do we know he won
[44:25] it is in the Bible thank God it's in the
[44:30] Bible because it's there plain for all
[44:31] to see that on the third day he rose up
[44:34] from
[44:35] dad and he was perfect and he was no
[44:38] longer beaten he was no longer bruised
[44:40] he was perfect and he gave us eternal
[44:44] life he proved to us that there is
[44:47] victory over this flesh there is a way
[44:49] to defeat it there is a way to beat it
[44:51] and to rise up again in a perfect form
[44:55] and to live with him eternally that's
[44:59] true she says the devil lost and he won
[45:01] that is very true his rise up to your
[45:05] feet and give him thanks I think you
[45:06] little ones you can go have a seat now
[45:09] that is the greatest story that I think
[45:12] human ears could ever hear that he came
[45:15] to this world to give us our salvation
[45:18] he gave us our salvation there's a way
[45:23] to Liberty to be free and I thank him
[45:25] tonight that I love him with all of my
[45:27] heart because he provided a way who's
[45:32] ready to see he's ready to worship Him
[45:34] in song yes we've done a little bit of
[45:37] preaching we've done some praising
[45:39] there's been prayer and now we just need
[45:41] to sing a song to him because we want to
