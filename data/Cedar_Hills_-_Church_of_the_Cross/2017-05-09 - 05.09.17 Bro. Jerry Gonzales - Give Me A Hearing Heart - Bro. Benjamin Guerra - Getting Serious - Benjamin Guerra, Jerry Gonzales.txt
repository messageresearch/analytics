how it doesn't matter what the person's going to operate on opossums are always their totem of sanity they had that hearing Harlan it's a Corazon para future but now as us homo nosotros as we hear from a part where God will not condemn you do not rock on the not for what you do okay asses he will condemn us rock on tonight because he's provided away a proviso and we don't hate that way you know give ominous a lure so we'll get to the point okay why you got our Punto and as I was meditating on this summer eternal nectar he says it's like a diabetes como el diabetes diabetes diabetes what is diabetes Lilliana original reference here I know Aaron you guys have studied so much italiana Carrasco yellow but but you see with diabetes okay premier icon diabetes with bad habits Kamala vetoes bad

you'll you'll you'll get to the point of the gala point of where this is another quality details the moment in that I but it's type 2 diabetes is 90% of people's problems get ready start people does it fit for my Grande and it's with it whether the sugars are too elevated in the blood point enough to get somewhere and Levada in lithography because the spleen stops producing insulin opens up where

neck sorry you know the blood sugar is blood sugar is too high let's look at the tongue angrily took us the sewage so I B's diabetes so is it possible that we can be here it's possibly directly here in the word that we hear we channel up another case push on it just like those cells that are swimming in the sugar glucose it's complicated Nando in the flu sorta not occur they're swimming anybody cannot absorb the tunnel and open up wanna observe others they're swimming it's all over them Donna Donna Tartt are irrelevant but they cannot absorb it nowhere observe arezzo so continue this this road contravene under attack come you know it what happened que pasa they started it you get to the point where they you can even get limbs amputated where you got that Punta Cana contest wanna a

now from the periphery 'te because what happens your pasa you shut down PT legs from attack hasta las piernas okay you start to get pieces taken away from you they are so critical on a Qatar even to the point as al punto and and you diabetics notice it's very touching booth area of etiquette are even to the point where you can lose your sight after Punta Cana para su Vista even when I went to the

pochamma of or development a so we hear it that's good Ramos is about to stay in the brain for a second at a level oh no no it's got to drop down to the neck Ava hydrocortisone so so I read this it's for work I had to respond after the trabajo they had me do a little bit of training okay okay entering a mento and they had me hear something that's called TED Talks where we got the 3 rocky algo que si mama cat talk so some of you may may have have heard the talk seminar before a lot of katana in seminary or anybody but he talked about something that caught my attention el habla algo que mega Romeo attention and he said this this is now we have to find out our why the number came contact north report K we have a lot of and he used the example of at the company Apple a look store lock opening at the Apple and it says this he says Apple is there so innovating the so successful thinner than a mucho éxito but if you know you have diehard Mac people here the demos are gente que ellos Donna I don't know why what a lot a Mac I don't understand it non-gender but they that's all power to them popover is but so they have a niche of people that are diehards I moved on tickets or naam ke sonar are fifty miles so they don't stick to match no matter what the Cal connect a company a Mac watch watch what he explains real expla cocky he says everyone else's approach la la manera que hace la gente las compañías because this is this is what they say this is this is how they conduct their marketing okay I've become a veneer for Martin through compañías we make great computers and thermogram de computadora they're beautifully designed the more water there allows user-friendly possible sir Parvati Patil sir do you wanna buy one can a comprar una so that's the typical marketing it's a little addict attack okay para heavy accusin watch the way Apple desu ka la cumbre say Apple la compañía everything we do we believe in challenging the status quo todo caramel caramel in Greta in Redondo Oh SSO las casas that's a lot process we believe in thinking differently grammar tape entire and different differences and how how we challenge the status quo como arm over Thomas claim Thomas crisis ml of courses is by making beautifully designed computer gender on computadoras Nathaniel bonito say by the way they're easy to use it is moving fast we pass our and we just happen to make great computers see some example computadoras muy grande you wanna buy one get a comprar no but you see how they connect with the balsamic on mexicana per phone they target a certain niche Bagan una cosa - grupo de grupo so so it so Apple what they do Apple locusts and they sell what they believe when the local Korean not what they do no lo que hacen a huge difference when a gram difference he says people buy what why we do it not what we do la gente que comprar porque lo say no porque lo que hacemos I'll repeat or replicate people by people by why we do it la compra la gente comprar porque los mo na what we do no porque lo que hacemos you see the difference l have a friend here and he's and goes I'm sure he's heard brother branham you're totally good okay scoot roll them on over on because he draws to be circles I felt ridiculous he draws a big circle I told Vicki Rio Grande it was another circle inside a big circle Gotham City Lauren taka s grande a Fiat Rome and he draws a third circle inside the hollow and inside the middle one rental del medio that's where he puts why I want a pony porque why we do it porque los temas okay outside how por afuera is porque and then the last one is what we do if I woulda made look at this oh so inside there though on the Hawaiian electronic only shape or K he said that's tied to what's called the limbic sorry so the limbic brain it's an attack and adentro on the time mark on the narrow so he's basically telling you that in the soul the current allall monogatari and why we do things or chasm of why we believe certainty or case a cream associate of course and then outside the the bigger circle of whatever fickle oh my grandma is how pork pork a and what you know brother Brennan draws the soul spirit of the body come on and larvae critical cuerpo so I'm like I said I'm I'm sure the he's heard brother bandura good okay see scooch all profit the way he breaks it out overlooked speaker and he brought another good point here Utah hold on important when first off you spoke about the Wright brothers somebody know who the Wright brothers are lol oh right bracket tank antonio's Wright brothers the first ones to be head of scare what did you know that there was another man Samuel Pierpont Langley the auto or breakage amount Samuel Pierpont Langley Samuel Pierpont Langley Samuel Pierpont Langley was a very educated man I
