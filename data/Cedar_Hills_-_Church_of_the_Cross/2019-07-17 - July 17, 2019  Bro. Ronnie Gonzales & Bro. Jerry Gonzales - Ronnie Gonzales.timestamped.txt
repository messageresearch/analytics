[1:07:21] la palabra and you bear with me for a
[1:07:23] little bit okay he may support on put a
[1:07:25] moment I had a really rough time putting
[1:07:27] this together temperature I'll go
[1:07:29] difficult on the Panetta statement
[1:07:30] because there's things that happen in my
[1:07:32] life for causes and Movida because we
[1:07:33] have to preach our experience name was a
[1:07:35] political expediency so I found myself
[1:07:38] in that state doesn't mean Quentin
[1:07:39] Ernest estado and so brother Tommy says
[1:07:42] in the message he said Martha mas an
[1:07:44] estimate sorry he says you want to know
[1:07:45] how to get out of chaos the kiddies
[1:07:47] America most a little cows how many want

[1:08:14] tomorrow Tomas caters there's a little
[1:08:16] cows it's easy but he says only belief
