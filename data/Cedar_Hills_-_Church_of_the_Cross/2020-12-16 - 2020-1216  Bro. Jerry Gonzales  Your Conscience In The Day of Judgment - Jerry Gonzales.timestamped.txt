[22:09] after being in the hospital for 78 days
[22:12] they could not get her to breathe on her
[22:13] own
[22:14] they started talking about to me about
[22:17] sending her home with the tracheotomy
[22:19] so the machines could breathe for her at
[22:21] home
[22:22] you know as a mother watching your child
[22:25] just lay there
[22:26] with no way to help them it's the most
[22:29] helpless feeling i have ever felt
[22:31] and for me it brought me to the lowest i
[22:33] had ever felt my whole life
[22:36] there was not one thing i could do on my
[22:38] own all i could do was trust in the lord
[22:41] i had to put into action all that i
[22:43] claimed
[22:44] i prayed to the lord and asked for a
[22:46] miracle during this prayer i promised
[22:48] the lord that i would do something
[22:50] and that was a special he then showed me
[22:54] serenity in our pastor's hands being
[22:56] dedicated to the lord and i knew
[22:58] everything would be fine
[23:00] even though it has been 11 years i have
[23:02] not forgotten that promise
[23:04] god bless you
[23:12] [Music]

[33:59] and as i journey through life
[34:03] dark clouds of sorrow and stride
[34:08] sometimes they hinder my way
[34:11] they jar in my soul with dismay
[34:16] but this one thing i will say
[34:20] that not far off is that day
[34:25] when god so surely i pray

[35:03] suffers not in vain
[35:07] oh the world it slumbers away
[35:12] in sin it harbors all day
[35:16] to some the gospel of christ
[35:20] means but a passing of sight
[35:24] oh but to the children of god
[35:28] it means salvation in life
[35:33] the road to heavenly sod
[35:37] land of triumphant and tide
[35:41] oh my heart will shout
[35:45] to the lord of lords
[35:50] to the king of kings

[36:05] [Music]
[36:07] that the chosen lot in the will of
[36:10] god's offer not in vain
[36:14] [Music]
[36:17] bless you tonight
[36:22] privilege to be here tonight
[36:26] i want to thank everyone for the effort
[36:27] that they made to come
[36:32] happy to be in the house of the lord
[36:36] hey man so not to uh
[36:39] have you standing too much longer and
[36:44] let's turn everybody get situated here
[36:55] i want to thank our our pastor for the
[36:56] confidence that he has in us
[37:02] allowing us to speak here on this sacred
[37:04] desk
[37:16] we're going to read a very familiar
[37:20] scripture
[37:26] for the law having a shadow of good
[37:28] things to come
[37:30] and not the very image of the things can
[37:33] never with those sacrifices which they
[37:35] offered
[37:36] year by year continually make the comer
[37:39] there onto perfect
[37:43] sombra de los vienes venideros
[37:48] de las cosas
[38:03] uh let's go to verse 2 for then would
[38:05] they not have ceased to be offered
[38:08] because the worshiper once purged should
[38:10] not have
[38:12] had no conscience of sins
[38:16] versus
[38:34] you may be seated
[38:39] so just uh should you just bear with me
[38:42] tonight
[38:45] i i don't know where to where how to
[38:47] enter into this thing
[38:51] but uh luckily it's not us and it's uh
[38:53] it's the holy spirit and what he wants
[38:57] no spiritual
[39:04] and we're sure that that it'll be him
[39:06] speaking this evening
[39:11] we've done everything that we need to on
[39:12] our part
[39:17] we study we meditate almost
[39:22] ask the lord for guidance
[39:25] so now we're just waiting on him on what
[39:27] he what he wants to do
[39:33] but so so we're we're talking here in
[39:35] hebrews
[39:38] and and it says it says a word there
[39:40] that kind of stood out to me
[39:46] and and actually if i could put a title
[39:48] to this thought
[39:52] it's a it's your conscience and the day
[39:54] of judgment
[40:06] should have no more conscience of sins
[40:09] immediately
[40:11] and and the definition reads definition
[40:15] there is the sense or consciousness of
[40:18] the
[40:19] of moral goodness or blame worthiness
[40:38] character the character together with
[40:41] the feeling of obligation
[40:43] tensions and characters
[40:47] another definition of consciousness
[40:50] portrays
[41:04] the rightness or wrongness the acer
[41:07] vienne
[41:07] of one's behavior
[41:12] it took me to the word intentions
[41:14] anonymous
[41:17] what one intends to do okay
[41:32] whether good or bad whether ccs
[41:36] so just to put a little bit of basis on
[41:37] that's what we're gonna
[41:39] what we're gonna speak on tonight
[41:44] and this goes off of an experience that
[41:46] i had
[42:15] so just remember there's going to be
[42:16] some things in here
[42:20] that hit me first okay so
[42:23] so we're so we speak unconscious
[42:27] and you look at the society today
[42:31] specifically with uh with the election
[42:34] especially
[42:35] election so it looks like we're in the
[42:37] election months now
[42:41] it's messes there it's months
[42:44] and and it looks like like they you know
[42:47] they keep finding
[42:48] you know things that are that are wrong
[42:54] and you know things that are false as
[42:58] but you look at all the politicians
[43:01] politicos and and you hear them speak
[43:04] hablar and you have to wonder if they
[43:06] have a conscience
[43:10] because a lot of them they will just say
[43:12] a bold face lie
[43:16] and and they they speak to the people
[43:19] and like like if like if nothing it's
[43:22] nothing
[43:23] you know it's you so you ask do they
[43:26] have a conscience or not
[43:29] you know but there's a lot of times
[43:31] where the conscience has been seared
[43:36] and we never want to get to that point
[44:06] i mean they'll swear up and down um
[44:12] and they they speak evil of people
[44:15] for just anything
[44:18] and it seems like if you don't agree
[44:20] with their views
[44:28] you know it seems like there's they get
[44:30] like they
[44:31] they get like a hatred towards you
[44:47] you look at them speak about one another
[44:54] and there's a genuine hater
[44:57] you know you you hear you hear things in
[44:59] the media
[45:00] escuchas uh
[45:14] and it's a one-sided affair yes the
[45:28] have been censored for their views
[45:45] you can say something about a certain
[45:46] political party and i won't mention it
[45:48] behind them
[45:53] but you you put something down and
[45:55] they'll censor it
[46:23] and the other side they covered up a lot
[46:25] of things
[46:39] so this is and this is the thing that
[46:40] got me yesterday
[46:43] because it even comes down to the
[46:45] message of the hour
[46:49] malachi 4-5 i'm not speaking on the
[46:52] denomination
[47:04] william marion branham william marion
[47:05] branham and it seems like that
[47:08] thing has crept in there
[47:12] if you believe a certain way they put
[47:15] you in a certain group right away
[47:19] they put you in a certain category
[47:22] and even
[48:32] that means god came up with he thought
[48:34] of something else
[48:38] and that disqualifies him from being
[48:40] qualified
[48:42] because god knows the beginning from the
[48:44] end
[48:47] from the very beginning the principle so
[48:50] if they can put the first quote up for
[48:52] me
[48:52] father the hour has come it's a little
[48:54] long but i need to read it to give a
[48:56] little bit of foundation
[49:01] because there's some there's some things
[49:03] like i said i know because it hit me
[49:04] like i said
[49:10] they they sting a little bit but we're
[49:13] talking about the conscience
[49:33] so let us let us uh read the first quote
[49:36] if they have it i don't know if i give
[49:38] them enough time
[49:40] okay so it's a little bit lengthy but
[49:42] just bear with me okay
[49:45] okay so it says see micah was right on
[49:48] on the on that word
[49:53] that word had to be fulfilled yes
[50:38] there's nothing around there
[50:41] no blood no sangria see i can just walk
[50:44] any time i want to yes
[50:49] brother branham says i can take
[50:52] possession of that thing
[50:55] that whole denomination
[50:58] i can get the whole thing
[51:02] they don't even believe in the blood
[51:05] i so i can i can take the whole thing
[51:11] god said that's right
[51:14] you can do that i'll go down there and
[51:17] get in them
[51:18] fellows
[51:37] i'll blind their eyes from that from the
[51:39] word
[51:42] that's all i have to do and and can't
[51:44] see it yes ears and
[51:50] they can't hear it
[51:53] oh sorry i think i skipped here keep
[51:56] them from the worst so they can't see it
[51:58] you know god does that a lot of a lot of
[52:01] times
[52:30] then you'll get him up there in total
[52:33] and so one of these preachers
[52:38] did his and his great prestige become so
[52:41] isu
[52:44] what what would i say
[52:48] it becomes so degraded before the people
[52:54] that he walked up and smacked him in the
[52:58] face
[53:00] i hope we don't do that even spiritually
[53:02] speaking
[53:05] he said why which way went the spirit of
[53:09] god
[53:09] out of me
[53:53] as it was in the other days it's a lying
[53:56] spirit
[53:58] that's in false prophets they're telling
[54:02] you a lie
[54:04] if the spirit gets spiritual
[54:07] just says this all liberation of women
[54:14] and do all these other things
[54:18] and go out act like the world is
[54:43] so so i asked you know after reading
[54:45] this quote
[54:48] i asked myself so
[54:51] a lying spirit a spiritu mentiroso
[54:54] is not something that's not lined up
[54:56] with the word
[54:59] so that means one thing
[55:02] we better stay lined up with the words
[55:17] [Music]
[55:18] so that means
[55:37] is for for my job i i had to take a
[55:40] polygraph for what's called the light
[55:41] detector
[55:42] for me
[56:08] i wonder if there's a lot of times many
[56:10] times
[56:13] we hear something that comes behind the
[56:14] police
[56:29] our names come to our mind
[56:32] or maybe a lot of time many times we
[56:35] think oh it's the people out there
[56:39] it's the drunkard oh he's talking about
[56:42] the drunken
[56:44] the drug addict the the thief
[56:48] the murderer but what about those
[56:53] that say one thing and have different
[56:56] intentions in their heart
[57:00] what about those who secretly have odd
[57:02] against somebody
[57:04] else
[57:10] we have to love everybody
[57:26] yes because we can work around it
[57:32] and we could say yes i have love
[57:36] and you're saying the truth but not all
[57:52] and it's
[58:16] a lot more work than telling the truth
[58:20] so it causes certain reactions in our
[58:22] body gauze
[58:24] reactions it causes us to be like a
[58:26] neurotic people
[58:30] always trying to cover something up
[58:34] i don't
[58:48] your conscience and the day of judgment
[58:52] but judgment begins in the house of the
[58:54] lord
[58:56] that's the beauty of it because there'll
[58:59] come a time
[59:01] where there'll be that great white
[59:02] throne judgment
[59:16] work on getting these things out of us
[59:19] work on clearing our conscience
[59:23] because nobody has to judge you
[59:26] nobody has to judge me oh conscience
[59:58] come it's right now
[1:00:02] this is the whole story
[1:00:07] this is not a narrative drama by the
[1:00:09] politicians
[1:00:12] but this is the word
[1:00:39] the merciful man do with doeth good
[1:00:42] to his own soul
[1:00:48] but he that is cruel trouble with his
[1:00:50] own flesh
[1:01:04] i'll let you know where i'm going with
[1:01:05] this and like i said i'm not throwing at
[1:01:08] anybody
[1:01:10] but when i read the quote immediately i
[1:01:12] said
[1:01:16] well i'm not one that says that the
[1:01:18] signs don't follow
[1:01:22] and i don't say that he is not the same
[1:01:24] you know
[1:01:26] but i have to ask myself other questions
[1:01:31] i am not one who says signs and wonders
[1:01:34] don't follow
[1:01:49] i don't want to fail to discern the body
[1:02:05] but do i pick and choose in whom and
[1:02:07] where he is the same
[1:02:08] pero es coco es escojo
[1:02:12] es el mismo god forbid i ever dislocate
[1:02:14] the body oh
[1:02:16] there's no permit um
[1:02:33] what does brother branham say this
[1:02:34] hermano brenda a man without a new birth
[1:02:38] he's a beast okay isn't that what he
[1:02:41] says
[1:02:42] what does a beast do yeah a beast
[1:02:46] by nature his instincts to
[1:02:50] instinct he is to protect himself
[1:02:55] and his own so what does that show
[1:03:00] the mind of christ doesn't show that
[1:03:04] the mind of christ says the family of
[1:03:06] god
[1:03:10] a beast mentality or with
[1:03:14] me tonight
[1:03:51] do i sing a little louder and go a
[1:03:53] little crazier only
[1:03:55] when certain song leaders get up
[1:04:08] do i say amen a little louder and more
[1:04:10] often
[1:04:26] is without exemption
[1:04:29] he is the very best that we have yes and
[1:04:32] everybody should scream to the top of
[1:04:34] their lungs
[1:04:36] because i will say that is the angel to
[1:04:38] the church
[1:04:55] do i fall all over myself oh make me go
[1:04:58] i see mismo when i say
[1:05:00] hi to certain brothers hermanos but when
[1:05:04] someone you don't care for comes up
[1:05:23] do i want mercy for those people who i
[1:05:25] love and are in favor of
[1:05:27] misery
[1:05:34] those that
[1:05:49] or because frankly you just want to keep
[1:05:51] them down
[1:05:56] frankly speaking um
[1:05:59] are we just cruel estamos cruellas and
[1:06:16] this this hits me first
[1:06:21] inventory starts at home inventory and i
[1:06:23] have to ask myself
[1:06:26] have i been guilty of this is does my
[1:06:30] conscience bother me is there something
[1:06:33] inside of me
[1:06:35] there's telling me hey you need to fix
[1:06:38] this
[1:06:41] these things are wrong
[1:06:44] you ain't going nowhere nova so without
[1:06:47] fixing these things
[1:06:50] so i say this because of the experience
[1:06:52] i had
[1:06:54] an experience so so by god's grace
[1:06:57] for la gracia i'm in the process of
[1:07:00] getting a security clearance
[1:07:06] for my job it requires it
[1:07:10] and and the clearance is top secret
[1:07:20] so so in the process here in a process
[1:07:23] and i don't even know how long i've been
[1:07:24] going but i only said bro
[1:07:26] jerry
[1:07:32] in the process in the processor so they
[1:07:34] run through your life
[1:07:36] it was examined with a fine tooth comb
[1:07:39] the cercas so they're looking if you've
[1:07:42] ever been arrested
[1:07:47] do you have bankruptcy do you have a
[1:07:49] domestic violence
[1:08:13] and then on top of that you have to you
[1:08:14] have to meet with a private investigator
[1:08:22] and they talk first of all you have to
[1:08:24] fill out a giant packet
[1:08:29] of all the everywhere you've lived
[1:08:32] where your relatives are familiar what
[1:08:35] your blood type is just about get to
[1:08:37] casey quest and then you meet with the
[1:08:40] investigator
[1:08:43] they verify the information um
[1:08:47] they take your fingerprints thomann to
[1:09:19] do you know of any disputes that he's
[1:09:21] had
[1:09:23] um
[1:09:26] have the police ever been to his house
[1:09:30] what kind of person do you see him
[1:09:46] they contact some of the contacts i put
[1:09:48] in the package
[1:09:53] they're basically trying to get my
[1:09:54] background yes
[1:09:57] and our pastor was one of them so he
[1:09:58] knows
[1:10:28] what kind of person is he okay class is
[1:10:31] he is he
[1:10:32] straightforward yes
[1:10:36] so they want to know everything about
[1:10:38] you
[1:10:41] and after a while he despised
[1:11:10] on i had to go to denver
[1:11:15] by denver and go through what's called
[1:11:17] the polygraph of the light detectors
[1:11:22] and i don't know if anyone has ever had
[1:11:23] to go through one of those you know
[1:11:31] even though say you don't have anything
[1:11:33] negative against
[1:11:36] by nature those tests foreign
[1:11:43] so did you know that god had a light
[1:11:45] detector test in the old testament
[1:11:51] in the new testament
[1:12:06] ocho oh
[1:12:10] levi he said
[1:12:13] let your thumb and your urine belong to
[1:12:15] your godly man
[1:12:17] whom you proved at messiah and looked up
[1:12:20] that word it means testing
[1:12:22] with whom you contend it at the waters
[1:12:25] of meribah which means
[1:12:26] afflictions or
[1:12:34] so
[1:12:46] so so god had a lie detector test in the
[1:12:48] old testament
[1:12:57] you have to turn to it i'll just read it
[1:12:58] here because i'm sure they'll put it up
[1:13:02] you shall put in the breast breast piece
[1:13:05] of judgment
[1:13:06] the urem and the thumb and they shall be
[1:13:09] over aaron's heart
[1:13:11] when he goes in before the lord and
[1:13:14] aaron shall carry the judgment of the
[1:13:16] sons of israel
[1:13:17] over his heart before the lord
[1:13:19] continually ponders
[1:13:44] the old testament testament they had
[1:13:47] three ways of knowing a message
[1:13:51] the first way they find out
[1:13:54] it was either written on the law era
[1:13:56] escrito escrito
[1:13:58] the next thing was a prophet
[1:14:01] the next thing was the urum thomas
[1:14:04] now any teacher knows what the urem
[1:14:06] thumb was
[1:14:11] it was a light that flashed
[1:14:15] over the breastplate of aaron
[1:14:19] that they had hanging hanging in the
[1:14:21] temple
[1:14:23] now if a prophet prophesied
[1:14:26] and
[1:14:40] then if they see
[1:14:43] us if a dreamer dreamed the dreams
[1:14:48] and it didn't flash on the urim thomas
[1:14:53] it was wrong
[1:14:58] has been done away with in that sense
[1:15:06] but this is god's german thumbnail
[1:15:18] there was a a lie detector test in the
[1:15:20] old testament
[1:15:36] notice how brother branham uses euroman
[1:15:37] thomas
[1:15:40] he doesn't say and they say
[1:15:43] he always puts them together
[1:15:47] he always says so i want to define
[1:16:04] the message of the hour yes it's perfect
[1:16:07] because it's complete
[1:16:08] it's perfect so what is a show
[1:16:12] perfection brings the light of the
[1:16:14] gospel perfection
[1:16:16] the light of the world and
[1:16:32] won't go into his territory you know i
[1:16:34] entered into territory i just want to
[1:16:36] mention a little bit about it
[1:16:39] so there's a perfect there's an
[1:16:40] alignment
[1:16:43] jupiter and saturn saturn which will
[1:16:46] bring what
[1:16:59] if we can align ourselves
[1:18:38] where he was going
[1:19:34] if
[1:19:56] no one ever goes into judgment without
[1:19:59] thoroughly being warned
[1:20:17] let you get up there in time in the
[1:20:19] morning to go
[1:20:20] to get to church
[1:20:24] but notice exactly there's something
[1:20:26] going to follow this revival
[1:20:30] is
[1:21:26] now remember your conscience in the day
[1:21:27] of judgment
[1:21:30] as i was saying let us receive our
[1:21:33] judgment now
[1:21:38] i'm not going to judge you you're not
[1:21:40] your conscience
[1:21:48] [Music]
[1:21:49] so after all this i came up to the
[1:21:51] polygraph test
[1:21:54] and and watch this during the lie
[1:21:57] detector test
[1:22:00] number one this man is trained to watch
[1:22:02] deception
[1:22:08] um
[1:22:24] he's watching all this while you're
[1:22:26] sitting on a chair with a camera on it
[1:22:31] so there's there's a there's a chair
[1:22:33] you're you're sitting down with a camera
[1:22:34] on it
[1:22:35] is i wouldn't
[1:22:43] there are sensors on your hand that
[1:22:44] detect perspiration
[1:22:49] there's a blood pressure monitor to
[1:22:50] check your heart rate and your in your
[1:22:51] blood pressure
[1:23:02] there is a cable that picks up the
[1:23:03] movement across your chest
[1:23:13] the system is calibrated to your
[1:23:15] emotional state at the time the system
[1:23:18] has
[1:23:32] it's going to look bad on you
[1:23:35] because that means you're showing that
[1:23:37] you're trying to decieve
[1:23:42] so he he does they make and then they
[1:23:45] make you intentionally lie
[1:23:59] so he wants to see he wants to see your
[1:24:02] state when you're normal
[1:24:07] and when you lie and then he sits on the
[1:24:09] corner very nonchalant
[1:24:11] very uh very casual he very calm
[1:24:14] we calm
[1:24:56] unless it's something illegal yes he
[1:24:59] says i don't care what the answers are
[1:25:03] i just want to know if you're truthful
[1:25:08] he says the united states government
[1:25:12] they entrust a lot of top-secret
[1:25:15] information
[1:25:20] to people that are cleared
[1:25:23] so we have to be sure
[1:26:06] do you have any concern about those
[1:26:07] questions
[1:26:09] do you have anything that you would like
[1:26:10] to say at this time
[1:26:14] i'm going to give you the opportunities
[1:26:17] because once we're live in the forest
[1:26:32] and i want you to explain any concerns
[1:26:34] you have within you can
[1:26:48] the only thing i could
[1:27:30] so there we are so there i am
[1:27:33] i'm nervous he says it's okay
[1:27:38] now i'm going to ask you questions
[1:27:41] and maybe there'll be a pause between
[1:27:43] five and ten seconds
[1:27:52] and then if i ask you the question two
[1:27:53] or three times
[1:27:56] don't get nervous it's okay
[1:28:10] okay so then we go through the test the
[1:28:11] test run la prevalence
[1:28:30] [Music]
[1:28:54] it'll have an effect on your job
[1:29:00] you won't be able to receive your
[1:29:01] clearance
[1:29:04] so you don't have to take it it's okay
[1:29:08] so actually before we start you are you
[1:29:09] sure you want to proceed
[1:29:14] so the test begins ask me the question
[1:29:19] he tells me oh you did uh uh you
[1:29:21] breathed really hard right there huh oh
[1:29:27] he says don't move your foot because i
[1:29:28] can see the the movement on your foot
[1:29:30] don't move your foot
[1:29:34] then you ask questions someone
[1:29:53] [Music]
[1:30:01] but you got to remember the blood
[1:30:03] pressure monitor
[1:30:16] so he goes through that little period of
[1:30:18] time
[1:30:28] 5-10 seconds to see if you thought of
[1:30:29] anything
[1:30:32] to see if you
[1:30:43] and he says okay i'm going to ask you
[1:30:44] this question here oh let's wait
[1:31:27] i want to just do it again
[1:31:32] so like i said at that point this oh my
[1:31:35] goodness
[1:31:37] you're in full blown inventory mode
[1:31:38] right
[1:31:42] you're thinking of stuff
[1:32:10] is
[1:32:25] so in my mind i'm thinking like i said
[1:32:28] it doesn't even compare to the great
[1:32:29] wine
[1:32:32] blanco and he tells you right off the
[1:32:34] bat he says i'm looking for deception
[1:32:51] and then he asked me mr gonzalez
[1:33:18] i have to be truthful there are some
[1:33:19] that don't care for me
[1:33:33] like i said it's during that time you're
[1:33:36] under the magnifying glass
[1:33:37] yes
[1:33:46] you can lie no placement you can try
[1:34:03] i got that so so i the only thing i
[1:34:05] could do
[1:34:08] is bring this to a spiritual sense
[1:34:12] there are senses on your feet i i i
[1:34:15] uh
[1:35:00] around are sensors that monitor your
[1:35:03] heart
[1:35:03] sensors
[1:35:06] now remember we can trick all the rest
[1:35:13] oh brother because we can say oh my feet
[1:35:17] only take me to church my brother
[1:35:22] with my hands i do a lot of work
[1:35:26] and by
[1:35:54] the heart cannot be faked
[1:35:58] will always give you away
[1:36:02] because the human body was not made
[1:36:07] so during those questions
[1:36:11] you always i want you to catch this okay
[1:36:14] i want to get this in because my time is
[1:36:15] going
[1:36:18] during the questions when you ask the
[1:36:19] question
[1:36:22] and you waited five to ten seconds
[1:36:25] because he's looking for the initial
[1:36:26] response
[1:36:30] and he wants to see if the confession
[1:36:31] matches
[1:36:36] brother in the in the life i didn't give
[1:36:39] him these
[1:36:40] i didn't have enough time i apologize
[1:36:43] watch this year then the devil has
[1:36:47] another way
[1:36:48] el diablo remember he wants to see
[1:36:50] movement when during those five or ten
[1:36:52] seconds
[1:36:56] he wants to see this movement then the
[1:36:59] devil has another way
[1:37:03] we just have a movement
[1:37:34] i'll do i live a good life but the devil
[1:37:38] has perverted that pero el diablo
[1:37:40] he lets you think to satisfy your guilty
[1:37:46] certificate
[1:37:57] you can't get satisfaction by joining a
[1:37:59] church you don't put our statistically
[1:39:23] but don't settle for nothing less but no
[1:39:26] no no
[1:39:27] haciendas young people i want you to
[1:39:29] hear this
[1:39:31] because i'll tell you one thing there's
[1:39:34] no shortcuts
[1:39:37] there's no way of of purring this up
[1:39:43] watch us but don't settle for nothing
[1:39:46] less than an old-fashioned experience of
[1:39:49] the new birth
[1:39:52] [Music]
[1:40:06] when your soul and god unites together
[1:40:10] oh conjunction and you become one
[1:40:14] is so young people are lost
[1:40:17] you know that there's no shortcut for
[1:40:18] them no no no no
[1:40:48] the great thing is that we still have
[1:40:49] time
[1:40:52] right now we still have time we have
[1:40:55] very little time
[1:40:57] but there's still time and as long as we
[1:41:01] have time
[1:41:55] [Music]
[1:42:00] means the rise or fall of leaders
[1:42:06] is it a shift of some sort is coming yes
[1:42:10] so let it be for the good but
[1:42:41] nope we have an opportunity
[1:42:46] remember warning and then judgment
[1:42:49] what do you think the angel of the
[1:42:50] church has been trying to do with us all
[1:42:52] this time
[1:43:08] you know bringing us to where we need to
[1:43:09] be
[1:43:12] he leads me to green pastures
[1:43:17] so that's what he's trying to do so and
[1:43:20] i remember
[1:43:21] a dream that i believe it was
[1:43:50] so our confession of our mouth
[1:43:54] confession must match the confession of
[1:43:57] our hearts
[1:44:00] we're going to make it yes
[1:44:03] through the new birth yes
[1:44:11] just live
