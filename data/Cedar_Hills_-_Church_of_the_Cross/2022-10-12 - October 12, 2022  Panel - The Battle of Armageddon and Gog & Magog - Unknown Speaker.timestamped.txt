[29:00] so the Wednesday that we had a prayer
[29:04] service
[29:06] [Music]
[29:07] um
[29:11] we stayed home because
[29:13] um the kids had a really bad cough and
[29:19] I just didn't want to bring them out so
[29:21] you know
[29:24] um brother Diego had started saying that
[29:27] there was somebody with stomach problems
[29:29] uh
[29:32] [Music]
[29:35] and when I was 17 I the doctor said that
[29:38] I had ovarian cysts like all over
[29:46] EOS and when the time of the month would
[29:51] come for me it was very painful my
[29:53] stomach would swell really hard and I
[29:56] suffered with that for 10 years
[30:03] so when brother Diego started saying
[30:05] about the stomach I was having those
[30:07] issues that night
[30:14] but I thought well he's just saying the
[30:17] stomach he's not really saying anything
[30:18] about ovaries
[30:26] and just as I started to think that he
[30:29] mentioned about ovaries
[30:36] so I knew at that moment that I was
[30:38] healed and that God was going to heal me
[30:40] yes
[30:44] and so this month came around and I
[30:47] wasn't expecting any pain because I knew
[30:49] that God had healed me yes
[30:56] and well that's exactly what happened so
[30:59] I just want to thank the Lord yes
[31:03] for being so mindful and loving towards
[31:07] us
[31:09] God bless you
[31:11] [Applause]

[35:22] this opportunity as a panel gracias
[35:27] all these previous panels that have come

[35:30] this what a tremendous blessing they
[35:33] have big enough and ask that you just be
[35:36] with each and every one of us
[35:42] amen amen we're gonna start uh with the
[35:46] scripture real quick before we are
[35:48] seated
[35:50] and it's in the Book of Matthew
[35:54] chapter 24
[35:59] and verse six
[36:03] verses
[36:07] and it reads like this
[36:10] and ye shall hear of wars and rumors of
[36:13] wars
[36:14] see that ye be not troubled
[36:17] for all these things must come to pass
[36:20] but the end is not yet
[36:23] is
[36:37] thank you
[36:41] brother Jerry's gonna start us off this
[36:44] evening
[36:53] amen God bless
[36:55] evening
[36:59] it was uh
[37:01] a struggle to to get this ready for me
[37:04] anyway
[37:08] because you get so much information
[37:12] and then you wanna
[37:15] I guess you could say myself I want to
[37:17] lay it out and say well should I do it
[37:19] this way should I do it that way for me
[37:25] so I had no I had no way I was going to
[37:28] go this morning yes
[37:31] as of this morning I had no way you know
[37:35] so I'm sitting down and I'm drinking
[37:37] coffee and it is
[37:41] about 8 30 this morning
[37:44] and it just seemed to fall in place
[37:47] so it's not me
[37:50] it's never been me
[37:52] but it's always been God amen
[37:56] amen and if we read a a scripture
[38:00] when you read Revelations 12 apocalypses
[38:05] and I'll start with verse 7.
[38:11] and it says there was war in heaven
[38:14] Michael and his angels fought against
[38:16] the dragon and the dragon fought and his
[38:18] angels
[38:21] Miguel is
[38:27] and prevailed not
[38:29] neither was their place found any more
[38:31] in heaven
[38:39] and the Great Dragon was cast out that
[38:42] old serpent called the devil and Satan
[38:45] which deceiveth the whole world
[38:47] and he was cast out into the Earth
[38:50] and his angels were cast out with him
[39:06] so if we read here it says there was a
[39:09] war in heaven
[39:13] so there's always a difference between a
[39:16] war and a battle right
[39:19] because War I guess if you could
[39:22] describe War now
[39:24] definition
[39:26] it's usually two groups or two Nations
[39:29] or two militaries going to battle one
[39:32] another
[39:36] you know you know sometimes you have one
[39:39] country trying to take over another
[39:41] country
[39:44] but of course within that war
[39:49] there are certain battles is
[39:52] that help you win the war
[39:55] is
[39:57] and I believe this is no different
[40:01] the the war started in heaven with
[40:04] Michael and his angels
[40:09] and the dragon and his angels
[40:13] but but if you if you if you read a
[40:17] little bit before that
[40:20] so it says the red dragon was cast out
[40:25] and he took a third of the angels with
[40:28] him
[40:32] you know so so right there we're we're
[40:34] we should be already outnumbered right
[40:39] you know because you know a lot of times
[40:41] as God children we feel like we're the
[40:44] minority
[40:48] so anyway they they fought and and and
[40:51] and and and when they were cast down
[40:53] where were they cast down too
[40:59] either cast down into Eden as brother
[41:01] Branham says
[41:04] so they they cast down there the the
[41:06] serpent the devil
[41:10] is angels Los Angeles and you can I
[41:13] guess you can kind of say one of the
[41:15] first battles maybe he they they they
[41:17] encountered was
[41:25] and and I I would say it's not so much a
[41:28] physical where they where they bought
[41:29] and and you know
[41:33] but he got into her mind
[41:37] he got into her mind and and and and and
[41:39] he said and throw us and he changed a
[41:43] couple of words or what a word
[41:46] and she believed it so right there that
[41:49] battle was lost
[41:52] that was a spiritual battle that that he
[41:55] fought
[41:56] but you know in in in in in and
[41:58] throughout the Bible there there are
[42:00] many battles
[42:02] you know and and I and I look at this
[42:05] and and and as myself we have our own
[42:08] battles within us also
[42:12] and me you know should I do this should
[42:15] I do this
[42:16] or he wants me to do this or he wants me
[42:19] to do that
[42:21] so so we we encounter many battles
[42:25] muchos and of course if you go through
[42:28] through the Bible in the Old Testament a
[42:30] lot of these battles were visible
[42:37] I mean
[42:38] people got killed
[42:41] blood was shared it said
[42:44] not just not just blood of the Saints
[42:46] Rashad also
[42:48] so so it was I mean it was a literal
[42:52] fight
[42:54] you know and and if you look through the
[42:57] Bible of course you you have you know
[42:59] one of the one of the main battles you
[43:00] speak of is David and goliaths yeah
[43:09] and you had all these big old
[43:11] Philistines
[43:12] and you had one little man
[43:16] he was outnumbered
[43:21] you know and and and within this battle
[43:23] he he was not afraid
[43:27] you know he said I'll I'll take him on
[43:30] I looked at him and he said man this is
[43:35] you know I'll
[43:38] I'll do with him
[43:40] whatever I want
[43:42] but that's why in a lot of these battles
[43:47] it seems like we're alone
[43:51] you know all the trials we go through it
[43:52] seems like we're alone
[43:55] but but God has always said I will be
[43:58] there
[44:00] and he told David he David said by the
[44:04] by by he believed in God he
[44:08] he knew as long as he stood behind God's
[44:12] word
[44:15] that was nothing
[44:17] Goliath was nothing
[44:21] Goliath couldn't touch him
[44:24] as long as he believed on God's word
[44:27] you know and and that's why I say we're
[44:30] gonna there's a lot of physical battles
[44:34] because it started in heaven
[44:38] it came down to earth
[44:40] so we're going to have there there was a
[44:43] lot of blood Ramada
[44:47] you know like like when when when the
[44:50] Battle of Jericho
[44:52] you know the the same thing
[44:55] you know God came and told them this is
[44:58] what you're gonna do if yours
[45:01] because in every battle there there
[45:04] there is somebody in charge
[45:07] and this one was in the Battle of
[45:09] Jericho was a captain of the lord of the
[45:11] hosts
[45:15] you know like like in in any military
[45:17] battle you got your generals who are
[45:19] usually in charge
[45:23] and they lay out a plan
[45:26] they say all right this is what this is
[45:29] how we're gonna attack this one is
[45:33] and this is how they're gonna this is
[45:35] how we're gonna attack over here
[45:37] well in this one
[45:40] he told him how he was going to do it
[45:43] he says this is how you're gonna how
[45:46] you're going to attack and take over in
[45:49] Jericho because
[45:52] you're going to go every day and you're
[45:54] gonna go around
[45:58] and then you're gonna do it and then
[46:00] when you come to the seventh day
[46:03] you're gonna go around
[46:06] but you're going to go around seven
[46:08] times
[46:09] and as you're going around you're going
[46:12] to be
[46:13] raising I guess worshiping out oh they
[46:15] were they were to be loud even a sir I
[46:19] said much and if you follow God's plan
[46:21] you see
[46:23] there's nothing the devil can't stand in
[46:25] front of you
[46:27] you know like I said there's many
[46:30] battles
[46:31] physical battles physicals
[46:35] but then we're also going to have our
[46:37] spiritual battles
[46:40] because there was war in heaven
[46:44] because it came down to earth
[46:47] so that doesn't make us exempt and told
[46:49] us no no
[46:52] no no no it's almost acceptable of
[46:53] course all these battles is going to
[46:55] lead to one final battle
[46:58] when I uh when uh
[47:02] there's going to be one final battle
[47:05] but but we also like I said we have a
[47:09] spiritual battle
[47:11] because in in in Ephesians 6 and
[47:15] official says
[47:17] 10
[47:18] says yes
[47:21] finally my brethren be strong in the
[47:23] Lord and in the power of His might
[47:25] Hermanos Muse
[47:31] but on the whole armor of God
[47:35] that you may be able to stand against
[47:38] The Wiles of the devil is
[47:45] not against flesh and blood
[47:50] but against principalities
[47:53] against Powers
[47:55] against the rulers of Darkness of this
[47:58] world
[48:02] against spiritual weakness in high
[48:05] places
[48:09] so we are going to have our spiritual
[48:12] battles
[48:14] in this in this war in heaven
[48:18] the battle was for it was jealousy right
[48:24] because because Lucifer wanted what
[48:27] Michael had Lucifer
[48:30] Lucifer one and he wanted he wanted
[48:33] he wanted it all he was
[48:35] so that's that's where the spiritual
[48:37] comes in sometimes now uh this is
[48:41] we we sometimes Maybe
[48:47] we see certain things that the world has
[48:50] versus
[48:58] because sin is beautiful
[49:01] right sin is beautiful yes it makes a
[49:05] pretty picture
[49:07] and that's where it comes in spiritually
[49:10] because
[49:12] because God chose the heart
[49:16] and devil chose the mind
[49:20] right because he went he attacked Eve's
[49:23] mind in the beginning
[49:26] but it all started over jealousy
[49:32] but if we stand on God's word
[49:35] if we if we stick to God's word
[49:40] then then nothing can can harm us
[49:45] now he paints a pretty picture
[49:48] and he says oh look how good this is
[49:52] look how good that is
[49:54] how good this is oh you're just by
[49:57] yourself oh it is but but realize you
[50:01] are not by yourself
[50:03] we don't stand alone in this world
[50:07] we don't stand alone in these battles we
[50:10] go through
[50:12] I don't stand alone in anything we do
[50:15] but as long as we have God's word in
[50:18] front of us
[50:21] God's word in front of us
[50:25] we can conquer anything
[50:29] because in this in this in a lot of
[50:32] these battles
[50:36] there's one thing that that you can that
[50:39] you read in there is
[50:41] that you're never alone
[50:43] they didn't fight it
[50:45] they actually literally fought it
[50:49] but there was somebody else
[50:53] because because if you look if you look
[50:55] at the
[50:56] the battle with Gideon and
[51:00] he started off with with 32 000.
[51:06] that's what he got 32 000.
[51:11] and the Lord told them that's too much
[51:13] yes
[51:14] they must
[51:16] he says you know you need to knock it
[51:18] down they say
[51:19] caramenos so he told him he told him
[51:23] whoever is afraid and doesn't want to
[51:25] fight this is
[51:34] so you do the math that leaves them with
[51:36] ten thousand yeah
[51:39] the Lord said that's still too much
[51:44] and he's okay so he tells them okay
[51:47] until he said okay this is uh whoever
[51:50] drinks water
[51:52] and there was the ones that were
[51:54] drinking the water and there were some
[51:55] that were just
[51:57] drinking it like crazy
[52:02] basically they got this bottle and they
[52:04] just drank it all at once
[52:09] that we're drinking water yeah
[52:24] they're watching out for what's coming
[52:28] here so after that there was only 300
[52:31] left
[52:36] so you imagine as they get there
[52:39] there's 300 avian president and they
[52:42] look up
[52:43] and there's 150 000 that they have to go
[52:46] again
[52:49] those odds don't look very good yes
[52:53] but they stood on God's word
[52:57] on God's word and they believe that he
[52:59] would that he would be there fighting
[53:01] with them
[53:03] and fighting for them
[53:08] but then there were some battles that
[53:10] were lost
[53:14] right
[53:16] there were some battles were lost
[53:20] like when there was sin in the camp from
[53:23] the Avia picado in El Campo they lost
[53:25] that battle
[53:27] but then they had to go back and they
[53:29] had to clean out they had to search
[53:33] and they said why did we lose
[53:36] why wasn't the Lord with us
[53:40] and we got we ourselves we gotta we
[53:42] gotta check ourselves out you know
[53:45] we gotta check our house
[53:49] where is
[53:53] why can't I seem to get ahead
[53:56] they found the sin and they took it out
[54:00] I believe they they burned it right it
[54:03] was burned
[54:05] I think that's
[54:07] they burned it out
[54:09] and it's the same thing we got to get
[54:11] that sin in our lives and we got to burn
[54:13] it out
[54:16] we gotta stand on God's word
[54:20] because there's gonna be many battles
[54:24] there's going to be many fights muchas
[54:27] there's going to be many things
[54:30] but in these battles
[54:34] God is with us
[54:37] that's why in the Bible I believe it's
[54:39] 365 times
[54:44] there's a phrase that is used 360.
[54:51] Don't Be Afraid yes
[54:56] is that a coincidence that sits in there
[54:58] 365 days
[55:03] because he's telling you every single
[55:05] day don't be afraid
[55:09] well that's another message in itself
[55:11] but I
[55:14] I when I read that it caught me
[55:18] attention if we have him with us 365
[55:21] days every single day
[55:26] yes we have nothing to be afraid of
[55:30] you have nothing to be afraid of us
[55:34] these battles are going to be great
[55:38] the ultimate and final battle is going
[55:40] to be great
[55:43] but this is preparing us for what's to
[55:46] come
[55:48] and we gotta stand on God's word
[55:52] we gotta put God first in our lives
[56:01] foreign
[56:14] to this world
[56:17] but be transformed by the renewing of
[56:20] your mind
[56:22] that you may prove what is that good and
[56:25] acceptable and perfect
[56:27] will of God is
[56:49] transformados because also it says
[56:52] you got to be
[56:55] soberos
[56:56] of course you know when we say sober
[56:59] that you know a lot of people say oh
[57:01] well don't be drunk
[57:02] uh
[57:07] and then yeah that that's what it's used
[57:09] for yeah
[57:10] but it also can use to have your mind
[57:13] cleares
[57:15] have your mind focused and focalo
[57:18] because when when you're filled up with
[57:20] different other things
[57:22] or you're drunk on other things
[57:26] then you're not thinking clearly
[57:29] so you got to have a sober mind
[57:33] you got to have a clear mind
[57:36] um
[57:38] you know and here is
[57:41] what is God's plan for you yes
[57:45] amen amen
[57:48] that's
[57:49] that's what I have thank you
[57:52] amen thank you brother Jerry
[58:01] yeah
[58:03] we're doing battle up here with
[58:05] these brothers
[58:08] especially this brother here he did
[58:11] battle
[58:13] when we were younger
[58:16] but it's awesome to battle side by side
[58:24] I'm gonna ask a question
[58:28] and be
[58:29] honestos how many are afraid when you
[58:32] hear of Wars the war going on
[58:37] Ukraine right now
[58:39] when you hear of Wars does it scare you
[58:46] foreign
[59:13] man there's only two that are Joshua and
[59:16] Caleb are you one of them too man we got
[59:19] to believe that way right
[59:23] but what's scary about wars is
[59:28] your loved ones
[59:31] that are lost
[59:33] and when all this starts taking place
[59:37] they're not there
[59:40] that's what's scary
[59:44] so it's our duty to go out and get them
[59:46] right
[59:52] there's been several times in my life
[59:54] that I've had dreams
[59:58] and in these dreams
[1:00:02] you can just hear planes you know jets
[1:00:05] flying by
[1:00:07] aviones
[1:00:09] within yourself
[1:00:11] interested you know it it's it's on
[1:00:19] and you a couple times I've been in the
[1:00:22] house next thing I know I'm out I'm out
[1:00:23] in a in a field in pardes Campo
[1:00:29] and you look in the distance and you can
[1:00:31] see the armies coming
[1:00:35] you can see the enemy Elena
[1:00:40] and in several of my dreams I'm holding
[1:00:43] I'm holding a rifle
[1:00:45] is
[1:00:48] you know you're ready ready to fight
[1:00:53] but as they get closer
[1:00:57] and I turn away and look in the
[1:00:59] direction I'm heading
[1:01:03] the Lord says you gotta just get to that
[1:01:06] spot
[1:01:09] if you can reach that spot
[1:01:14] they can't touch you
[1:01:17] they can't harm you
[1:01:21] and in my dreams I always get there we
[1:01:24] get to that spot
[1:01:27] a couple times I even look around and
[1:01:29] there and there's
[1:01:31] no faces that I that I know people from
[1:01:33] inside the church
[1:01:40] but they're coming from different areas
[1:01:44] but we all meet in the same place
[1:01:49] and we talk and and hey we made it we
[1:01:51] made it yeah
[1:01:55] just just the little thing I wanted to
[1:01:57] share with you
[1:02:01] because we know it with with this
[1:02:03] subject
[1:02:06] Armageddon and Gog and
[1:02:08] magogi Magog
[1:02:11] like brother Jerry said we we battle
[1:02:13] daily
[1:02:16] you know
[1:02:18] there's events in life when we're born
[1:02:20] it's an event
[1:02:25] when you get married it's an event
[1:02:29] when you graduate from high school it's
[1:02:32] an event
[1:02:36] when some people get divorced
[1:02:39] personas
[1:02:41] it's an event
[1:02:43] why do people get
[1:02:45] divorcedentes brother Branham says in in
[1:02:49] the message invasion of the USA
[1:02:53] back in 1954
[1:02:57] he says that the United States had the
[1:03:00] highest divorce rate in the whole world
[1:03:10] the prayer tasa
[1:03:13] you know
[1:03:15] and then he he goes on to say why
[1:03:18] because
[1:03:20] the United States
[1:03:24] they get out of
[1:03:26] Womanhood
[1:03:28] is
[1:03:34] uh husbands
[1:03:37] want a different partner Los esposos
[1:03:42] a wife wants a different partner
[1:03:47] so on and so forth yes
[1:03:49] but like I was saying every everything
[1:03:52] is an event
[1:03:55] I wake up in the morning and I'm Jolly
[1:03:58] Old I'm dolly
[1:04:00] always happy in a good mood
[1:04:05] but when I was a teenager
[1:04:08] stay away from me
[1:04:11] we don't like to get up early
[1:04:14] immediately you're in a battle in your
[1:04:17] mind
[1:04:21] Elijah it's time to get up you got to go
[1:04:23] to school
[1:04:30] more so when you're young
[1:04:34] and when you're older
[1:04:39] why would that be for cases
[1:04:42] is that adversary he's after you guys
[1:04:45] after us all
[1:04:47] right
[1:04:49] it's a battle we have a battle every
[1:04:51] morning when we wake up
[1:04:55] but there's a way out
[1:04:58] right our pastor is preaching on that on
[1:05:01] Sunday
[1:05:05] what do we battle with in our minds
[1:05:09] you can go from A to Z what we battle
[1:05:12] with us
[1:05:15] that are married
[1:05:19] he can't say the wrong thing at home
[1:05:21] because Armageddon will go on inside the
[1:05:24] house

[1:05:30] we gotta watch out huh
[1:05:34] that doesn't happen at my house though
[1:05:37] where's my wife at
[1:05:42] but something so simple as to
[1:05:47] the bed not being made

[1:06:25] Persona and Magog is
[1:06:31] a place a country
[1:06:35] and we know what's going on in the world
[1:06:37] right now just today alone I heard
[1:06:41] on the news that
[1:06:45] if the president there Putin
[1:06:49] if he he's he's he's struggling in that
[1:06:53] battle right now the Russian
[1:06:57] and if he decides to use nuclear weapons
[1:07:05] they're they're they want to go in there
[1:07:07] and assassinate him
[1:07:11] you know that's
[1:07:12] that's what you know the military the
[1:07:15] this is uh

[1:08:03] the strongest military in the United
[1:08:06] States
[1:08:09] what no way
[1:08:12] as far as military the weapons the tanks
[1:08:18] Battleship uh
[1:08:20] the United States is the strongest when
[1:08:24] you think about it and say well
[1:08:27] how how are they gonna beat us
[1:08:36] you know how they're going to beat us
[1:08:38] because we're the ones
[1:08:41] we are the ones that are going to make
[1:08:44] this nation fall Nosotros
[1:08:49] we're bright right
[1:08:54] we will fall
[1:08:56] because
[1:08:58] of the things that go on foreign
[1:09:08] [Music]
[1:09:21] but he says Don't Fear Russia
[1:09:24] don't fear Russia
[1:09:27] clear ourselves
[1:09:30] we have to fear ourselves
[1:09:33] like in the times of Moses
[1:09:36] what happened when he came down
[1:09:40] just everything that was going on
[1:09:43] all the idols that were made
[1:09:47] we have Idols in our lives
[1:09:50] does anybody have an idol
[1:09:53] an idol can be anything
[1:09:56] from a car
[1:09:58] to money to
[1:10:03] you can go on and on
[1:10:11] so just quick real quickly just history
[1:10:14] on
[1:10:15] uh
[1:10:18] the president of Russia Presidente
[1:10:21] Russia he's he signed his own bill
[1:10:26] so how long does the president have in
[1:10:29] office
[1:10:33] how many terms
[1:10:38] depends on the country
[1:10:40] depends on the country
[1:10:42] well Putin signed in his own bill he
[1:10:45] signed off on it
[1:10:48] where he can
[1:10:50] be president for two more terms if
[1:10:53] elected president
[1:10:56] so he can be president until 2036.
[1:11:02] the president there he hates America
[1:11:06] he hates America holy America
[1:11:10] how did all these other countries gain
[1:11:13] all this knowledge on warfare
[1:11:17] spices
[1:11:20] again brother Branham says in the
[1:11:22] invasion of the USA it's from the United
[1:11:24] States
[1:11:27] we've gone down past presidents and and
[1:11:30] Military Chiefs and most possible
[1:11:33] presidents Secretary of Defense goes on
[1:11:36] and on continuously
[1:11:38] we gave them what we had
[1:11:46] they gained their knowledge from the
[1:11:48] United States
[1:11:50] and now they wanna
[1:11:52] use it against the United States but
[1:11:58] all this is going to take place that
[1:12:00] Henry will be bringing the Armageddon
[1:12:02] will go into more detail with Gog and
[1:12:05] Magog
[1:12:08] this happens at the end we always hear
[1:12:10] it's the end time it's the end time is
[1:12:12] it the end time
[1:12:15] right
[1:12:19] but will we be here for all this is
[1:12:25] we better not be here
[1:12:28] we better not be here
[1:12:31] when we have in battles in our minds
[1:12:35] fix them
[1:12:37] it's trust in the Lord
[1:12:39] sometimes you pray and you think he
[1:12:42] don't hear you
[1:12:44] we all do we're all human we think he
[1:12:47] doesn't hear us
[1:12:50] but he does hear us
[1:12:52] he does hear us if you have a sincere
[1:12:55] heart
[1:12:56] and you believe that he's there is it
[1:13:01] going to happen in five minutes
[1:13:03] no sometimes it takes it takes a while
[1:13:07] but just keep trusting and believing
[1:13:13] and those those battles in your mind
[1:13:17] they'll leave you
[1:13:20] they will leave you
[1:13:25] um I just have a couple more things here
[1:13:27] and then I'll switch over to to Will and
[1:13:30] particles
[1:13:34] how many have completed the whole
[1:13:36] stature of a perfect man perfect
[1:13:45] where are you at in that stature

[1:14:32] God likes to be worshiped he loves to be
[1:14:36] worshiped he loves to be worshiped but a
[1:14:40] lot of times we can't even raise our
[1:14:42] hands
[1:14:43] because we're scared someone's watching
[1:14:46] us
[1:14:47] [Music]
[1:14:48] when I see the the African Brothers

[1:16:48] they almost had to do it
[1:16:53] said that are you crazy
[1:16:56] we're preaching what we knew but they
[1:17:00] weren't ashamed
[1:17:01] what a shame to do it
[1:17:06] but are we ashamed
[1:17:10] we can't be ashamed to testify or to
[1:17:14] preach his word
[1:17:15] it's important
[1:17:18] it's so important that it could be us
[1:17:22] that one of us that brings that last one
[1:17:24] in is
[1:17:30] oh
[1:17:32] I just want to read a couple scriptures
[1:17:34] and I'll be done uh Joshua 24
[1:17:37] 15.

[1:17:47] the Lord
[1:17:48] choose you this day whom you whom ye
[1:17:51] will serve sorry
[1:17:55] is
[1:18:00] whether the gods which your father
[1:18:02] served that were on the other side of
[1:18:04] the flood or the gods of the amorites in
[1:18:07] whose land you dwells
[1:18:17] but as for me and my house we will serve
[1:18:20] the Lord

[1:18:52] finished my course I have kept faith
[1:19:01] amen God bless you
[1:19:03] Jerry brother
[1:19:05] Jonathan Jerry and one of Jonathan
[1:19:08] certainly this is uh uh a profound topic
[1:19:18] um
[1:19:19] and it's amazing what we see going on
[1:19:24] right now yes
[1:19:29] from what the prophets prophesied
[1:19:33] thousands and thousands of years ago
[1:19:39] it's being completed in our time
[1:19:45] no wonder this was the time that they
[1:19:48] that they looked for conrason is
[1:19:53] and the time that they wanted to be in
[1:19:57] yeah
[1:19:59] and how privileged we are to be in this
[1:20:03] time
[1:20:08] you know in
[1:20:11] to understand what Gog and Magog is
[1:20:18] you know it's uh sometimes it seems like
[1:20:22] like a fairy tale a versus
[1:20:26] sometimes it seems like
[1:20:28] we get so caught up in our minds of of
[1:20:31] of what this really is
[1:20:36] we hear these words we hear Armageddon
[1:20:39] is
[1:20:41] and it uh it seems like it's it's it's
[1:20:45] fables
[1:20:48] we think of Armageddon as as maybe
[1:20:52] something like
[1:20:53] like Lord of the Rings for example but
[1:20:56] foreign
[1:21:27] I want to make everyone understand that
[1:21:30] this evening
[1:21:33] we look at it and it might seem scary
[1:21:36] is
[1:21:50] and um
[1:21:53] we we see so many events happening right
[1:21:56] now
[1:21:59] and we gotta go
[1:22:02] back
[1:22:05] to where
[1:22:07] to where we've uh
[1:22:10] we see Gog on the vemos and we're going
[1:22:14] to go back in Into the Book of Genesis
[1:22:18] I'm going to start with the 10th chapter
[1:22:21] of yes and the second verse
[1:22:25] yes
[1:22:37] and it reads like this yes
[1:22:41] the sons of japheth
[1:22:44] Gomer
[1:22:45] and Magog
[1:22:47] and maddai and Javen and tubal and
[1:22:51] meshech and tirus
[1:23:08] now
[1:23:10] in the Bible that's that's the first
[1:23:12] that you hear of Magog and La Villa is
[1:23:15] Magog
[1:23:19] when you
[1:23:20] when you see this this uh this event is
[1:23:28] and as you study it even more
[1:23:34] it's unlike any event there has ever
[1:23:37] been yes
[1:23:42] Hollywood can try in and Spruce it up as
[1:23:47] best as they can Hollywood uh
[1:23:51] foreign
[1:24:14] we understand that
[1:24:17] Para
[1:24:26] when we when we uh look at the
[1:24:29] scriptures
[1:24:32] this is like I said uh uh a great event
[1:24:36] Grande
[1:24:39] and it reads like this chapter 38.
[1:24:48] and the word of the Lord came unto me
[1:24:50] saying son of man
[1:24:52] set thy face against Gog the land of
[1:24:55] Magog the chief Prince of meshech and
[1:24:58] tubal and prophesy against him
[1:25:14] and say thus saith the Lord God behold I
[1:25:19] am against thee oh God the chief Prince
[1:25:22] of meshech and tubal
[1:25:33] and I will turn thee back and put hooks
[1:25:36] into thy jaws and I will bring the
[1:25:39] fourth
[1:25:41] and all thine Army horses and Horsemen
[1:25:44] all of them closed with sorts with all
[1:25:48] sorts of armor even a great company with
[1:25:50] bucklers and shields all of them
[1:25:52] handling swords
[1:25:55] a
[1:25:59] how to
[1:26:01] refuse and those
[1:26:04] he had us it is
[1:26:22] Persia Ethiopia and Libya with them all
[1:26:26] of them with shield and helmet
[1:26:35] Gomer and all his bands the house of of
[1:26:39] tagarma of the north quarters and all
[1:26:43] his bands and many people with me
[1:26:48] casa de
[1:26:50] so
[1:26:54] confines
[1:26:57] tropas muchos Pueblos Contigo
[1:27:01] I don't know if the brothers have that
[1:27:02] map
[1:27:03] they they got it or not
[1:27:18] uh get the second map
[1:27:24] there we go
[1:27:25] hopefully we can that one was a little
[1:27:28] blurry but we can
[1:27:30] we can uh
[1:27:33] a little bit here alrighty
[1:27:36] so
[1:27:37] as
[1:27:39] as Ezekiel is is prophesying now
[1:27:45] keep in mind this is thousands and
[1:27:48] thousands of years ago
[1:27:51] but even even at thousands and thousands
[1:27:54] of years ago
[1:27:57] God's word remains perfect through time
[1:28:03] so we look at that first nation Persia
[1:28:06] Persia
[1:28:09] Persia is
[1:28:12] in in 1935 Persia and it means
[1:28:17] it changed its name to what's called
[1:28:19] Iran
[1:28:23] Iran and Iran is in the news constantly
[1:28:27] Iran
[1:28:29] it's a nation that not only hates
[1:28:33] uh hates America which
[1:28:39] to be honest it's we're really uh
[1:28:42] America itself is doing a great job of
[1:28:45] hating itself but
[1:28:53] it's also a nation that hates Israel
[1:28:58] it has said openly many times
[1:29:03] that it wants to wipe them off the map
[1:29:09] we know Iran as a country
[1:29:17] that is a that is an Islamic fundament
[1:29:21] that is the Islamic fundamentalist
[1:29:24] government yes Islamic
[1:29:32] the second Nation here
[1:29:35] the Bible says
[1:29:38] Ethiopia yes
[1:29:40] Ethiopia now it's not uh referring to
[1:29:45] the Ethiopia as we as we as we see it
[1:29:49] currently
[1:29:54] um but it's it's
[1:29:57] it's referring to Jose refere the area
[1:30:01] that we that we can see at see as
[1:30:04] Southern Egypt and Sudan Sudan
[1:30:12] keep in mind also
[1:30:15] Sudan is also an Islamic fundamental
[1:30:19] fundamentalist government
[1:30:22] and you're going to see a pattern in all
[1:30:24] of this foreign
[1:30:32] the third Nation Libya is to the west of
[1:30:35] Egypt
[1:30:39] it's strongly
[1:30:41] anti-america or anti-west ES
[1:30:43] anti-america anti-west anti-israel
[1:30:47] anti-israel and also an Islamic Nation
[1:30:50] Islamic
[1:30:53] number four numero cuatro we go to Gomer
[1:30:56] Gomer
[1:31:00] was also known as the Sumerians
[1:31:07] they originally lived north of the
[1:31:10] calcasus mountains
[1:31:20] in the southern part of what is
[1:31:23] modern-day Russia
[1:31:26] Moderno de Russia
[1:31:28] in ezekiel's time in El Tiempo de
[1:31:31] Ezekiel they had settled
[1:31:34] in what is now Central turkey
[1:31:41] Central okay number five numero Cinco
[1:31:45] we've got to garma
[1:31:50] that took the
[1:31:52] tagarma
[1:31:54] was identified by Josephus the
[1:31:59] josefas as the phrygians
[1:32:03] Como
[1:32:05] who uh or as a as as people who settled
[1:32:08] in what is called now what is called
[1:32:10] Eastern Turkey now yeah
[1:32:16] turkia
[1:32:17] we see turkey
[1:32:21] as as a nation right now that
[1:32:26] it's unlike these other nations
[1:32:28] mentioned before
[1:32:31] turkey is what they would maybe say
[1:32:35] their their Republic or democracy
[1:32:39] democracy they're part of NATO is
[1:32:44] but slowly but surely pero despacito
[1:32:47] they are leaning towards the way that
[1:32:51] these other countries are
[1:32:57] slowly leaning towards Islamic
[1:32:59] fundamentalism
[1:33:05] and I want you to see something really
[1:33:07] really interesting
[1:33:11] throughout the years Russia
[1:33:16] Russia and Iran Iran have never been
[1:33:20] friendly
[1:33:23] but as the saying goes
[1:33:28] the enemy
[1:33:30] of my enemy Elena is my friend es mi
[1:33:34] amigo anybody ever heard that uh the
[1:33:38] enemy of my enemy is
[1:33:41] my friend es mi amigo so here's brother
[1:33:44] Branham
[1:33:48] he says in the message the angel of the
[1:33:51] Lord
[1:33:54] now just remember this and watch it
[1:33:56] close
[1:33:58] we are in for the end times
[1:34:03] and I thought this was this is a really
[1:34:06] good sentence here really good statement
[1:34:09] yes
[1:34:11] it says watch geographically
[1:34:15] the healing
[1:34:18] geographicamente where
[1:34:21] your war is coming out
[1:34:27] just send you on that for just a minute
[1:34:29] it didn't say watch geographically where
[1:34:33] the war is coming out these noises
[1:34:40] it doesn't say watch
[1:34:42] geographically where the war is coming
[1:34:44] out
[1:34:46] but where your war is coming now see
[1:34:52] watch the Gog up there coming down
[1:34:58] so we understand now
[1:35:04] everybody understand
[1:35:07] he says watch the Gog up there coming
[1:35:10] down
[1:35:13] and I thought this was really really
[1:35:16] interesting
[1:35:19] down in Turkey
[1:35:22] and so
[1:35:25] ital the battles will not be settled in
[1:35:29] Korea Los batallas
[1:35:32] oh my goodness we just saw uh the other
[1:35:37] day or was it last week
[1:35:40] North Korea shot missiles over Japan
[1:35:43] Korea Del Norte uh
[1:35:46] in Japan I tell you everyone's getting
[1:35:49] on high alert
[1:35:52] but he says the battles will not be
[1:35:55] settled in Korea
[1:35:58] but over there in Palestine Palestine
[1:36:02] see we're near
[1:36:05] he says
[1:36:09] Billy Graham is going to have a meeting
[1:36:10] there in Washington Hermanos
[1:36:13] in Washington I was so happy for that is
[1:36:17] just a little afraid
[1:36:20] that we've sinned away our day of Grace
[1:36:30] I believe we're in for it
[1:36:33] I believe we're in for it
[1:36:39] when we come to a place where we join up
[1:36:44] and would throw aside the Bible and not
[1:36:48] even offer prayer
[1:36:53] nor nothing else to appease some ungodly
[1:36:56] nation that doesn't believe in God
[1:37:02] we're in for it
[1:37:05] that's right yes sir
[1:37:08] I said that from the beginning
[1:37:11] so how can you walk excuse me together
[1:37:14] except they be agreed
[1:37:19] that's true and when we throw off
[1:37:24] Christo alado we refused the cross
[1:37:30] and now we get a double cross
[1:37:34] um
[1:37:35] that's right that's what it is yes can
[1:37:39] you put up that picture of uh of
[1:37:42] the three men
[1:37:45] so
[1:37:46] in July 19th of this year and Julio de
[1:37:50] Julio there was this picture taken is
[1:37:56] to your to your right everyone know that
[1:38:00] President Putin
[1:38:02] Putin in the middle
[1:38:05] it's the president of Turkey
[1:38:09] and all the way to your left
[1:38:12] that's the leader of Iran Iran
[1:38:16] so imagine that
[1:38:19] coming to pass right before our very
[1:38:22] eyes
[1:38:25] a prophecy that was said thousands of
[1:38:28] years ago
[1:38:30] of these nations are rising
[1:38:35] now who is
[1:38:39] we've identified that as Russia
[1:38:45] amen amen
[1:38:54] the leader
[1:38:56] the leader in in the Book of Ezekiel
[1:39:02] when it's when it talks about the leader
[1:39:05] Gog
[1:39:06] it identifies him as the chief Prince of
[1:39:14] Principe or the ruler
[1:39:18] now we we understand
[1:39:22] through through history
[1:39:25] that Russia
[1:39:28] is a is a country
[1:39:32] or is it is a country that
[1:39:35] has that does not want anything to do
[1:39:38] with God
[1:39:41] they do not want anything to do with
[1:39:43] Israel
[1:39:44] Israel they are so against Israel in
[1:39:49] every way
[1:39:51] and this is and this is interesting and
[1:39:54] if you go back into
[1:39:56] um
[1:39:59] 38 Ezekiel 38 chapter 15.
[1:40:07] actually 14 I'm sorry therefore son of
[1:40:11] man prophesy and say unto God thus saith
[1:40:13] the Lord God and that day when my people
[1:40:16] of Israel dwelleth safely
[1:40:18] shalt thou know it foreign
[1:40:40] thou and many people with thee
[1:40:43] and all of them riding upon horses a
[1:40:47] great company and a mighty Army
[1:41:00] Grand multitude
[1:41:04] back in 1990
[1:41:07] or in the 90s
[1:41:11] um a
[1:41:12] a Soviet official
[1:41:15] official
[1:41:18] it was he was a spokesman
[1:41:21] he stated that
[1:41:23] in the early 90s
[1:41:26] principles that young people in the
[1:41:29] nation's schools
[1:41:32] are being required to learn Arabic yes
[1:41:38] as they're sick as their second language
[1:41:42] Segunda because his government had
[1:41:45] concluded
[1:41:47] that the future of their Nation
[1:41:51] lies with the Islamic nations of the
[1:41:54] world
[1:41:58] this was over 30 years ago
[1:42:02] and what has happened
[1:42:05] it has happened exactly
[1:42:08] as Ezekiel has had prophesied
[1:42:16] there's so much I'm
[1:42:19] I'm already over my time
[1:42:22] and I'm gonna
[1:42:24] I'm going to pass it over to brother
[1:42:26] Henry Henry
[1:42:34] you you live indigo
[1:42:36] sure is a subject that uh kind of keeps
[1:42:39] everybody kind of quiet
[1:42:44] because it's uh
[1:42:46] there's always been questions now with
[1:42:48] message believers
[1:42:51] [Music]
[1:42:53] message Believers is like well what's
[1:42:56] first
[1:42:57] Armageddon case
[1:43:03] what are we going to be here for this
[1:43:05] battle
[1:43:06] yes am I gonna make it
[1:43:09] and we make conclusions based on our
[1:43:12] fear yes
[1:43:16] and we leave the word to the side yeah
[1:43:20] we find comfort in it
[1:43:25] but uh but we just we just deal with our
[1:43:27] with our fears first seems like
[1:43:32] because those questions arise all the
[1:43:34] time
[1:43:36] well when is Armageddon going to happen
[1:43:39] [Music]
[1:43:40] well according to the politics and the
[1:43:43] systems of the world
[1:43:46] you already started
[1:43:49] so
[1:43:51] that brings questions in the mind of the
[1:43:54] believer
[1:43:56] so I'm gonna I'm gonna try to make it
[1:43:58] short today in my portion
[1:44:01] simply we're just going to call it
[1:44:03] Armageddon
[1:44:05] he must be born again
[1:44:11] you guys are looking at me like what are
[1:44:14] you talking about
[1:44:18] we think of Armageddon as as a battle
[1:44:21] that is just going to end the world
[1:44:25] is that the mind is this element is is
[1:44:28] that what we look at it oh of course
[1:44:32] it's gonna be is it going to be bad
[1:44:35] you're gonna be horrible really it's
[1:44:38] gonna it's gonna be a lot of Destruction
[1:44:41] and and if you look at these things as
[1:44:44] an American citizen
[1:44:48] you're missing it Lester Randall yeah
[1:44:52] we're in United States
[1:44:54] other nations look at this as something
[1:44:57] to to look forward to uh
[1:45:02] because they they want to see
[1:45:03] destruction on this nation and his
[1:45:05] people
[1:45:07] whereas
[1:45:09] when you start seeing all these enemies
[1:45:12] really
[1:45:13] coming up to understand
[1:45:16] when you realize that uh what's supposed
[1:45:19] to protect you is not that strong he
[1:45:22] consistency
[1:45:25] I mean really how strong how strong is
[1:45:28] yeah it is the as far as numbers goes
[1:45:30] and and and opinion
[1:45:33] this is the strongest army
[1:45:37] but who's leading it
[1:45:40] you see women that think that are men
[1:45:45] you get man to think they're women
[1:45:48] and they're the officials high-ranking
[1:45:51] officials of the Armed Forces
[1:45:56] where's the strength in that don't
[1:45:59] understand
[1:46:01] don't you think that our enemies know
[1:46:03] that
[1:46:04] is
[1:46:08] there respect for the power of United
[1:46:10] States
[1:46:14] no more no must because we had fallen
[1:46:18] into unbelief
[1:46:21] as a nation
[1:46:25] and there's no chance
[1:46:27] because the word needs to be fulfilled
[1:46:31] but just as that has to be fulfilled
[1:46:35] there's also a people
[1:46:39] there's also a call-out ones
[1:46:44] which is not just Americans not Suns
[1:46:48] that's what the mind is to change
[1:46:51] that behold I send you Elijah the
[1:46:54] prophet is
[1:46:56] not just for United States
[1:47:00] it's for the whole world as a matter of
[1:47:04] fact this is not Universal bride is
[1:47:06] universal so the mindset has to be
[1:47:08] different
[1:47:11] So speaking of Armageddon uh
[1:47:16] if you're a message believer
[1:47:20] are you a message believer you believe
[1:47:23] you're the bride
[1:47:25] you believe you're going to be here for
[1:47:27] all this mess
[1:47:29] is
[1:47:32] half of you are our bestest believer I'm
[1:47:34] right now
[1:47:36] I'm not a question in your confession
[1:47:39] Brothers
[1:47:40] but there's questions about that
[1:47:44] so you're not gonna be here
[1:47:47] so while we talk about it it's not for
[1:47:49] us
[1:47:53] let the Heat and burn up
[1:47:56] we don't have to be here
[1:47:58] we're the bride
[1:48:02] most Twitter
[1:48:06] where do we start brother Jerry
[1:48:08] and there was war in heaven
[1:48:11] [Music]
[1:48:12] Michael and his angels Miguel is
[1:48:17] Lucifer ideas
[1:48:20] and they kicked and they kicked him off
[1:48:22] heaven right
[1:48:25] was that the end of that war foreign
[1:48:55] let me ask you this
[1:48:59] um
[1:49:01] taking what brother Jerry said
[1:49:05] it's a war is
[1:49:08] and every war starts with the battle
[1:49:12] that was the first
[1:49:15] blows and
[1:49:20] and then who knows how many battles go
[1:49:22] on
[1:49:25] how many how many battles went on in the
[1:49:28] first World War uh that took place
[1:49:37] so this one war esta Guerra that started
[1:49:43] in heaven
[1:49:45] Michael and his Angel Miguel is Los
[1:49:48] Angeles
[1:49:49] bar against Lucifer and his angels
[1:49:55] um
[1:49:56] that's not over yet
[1:50:01] as a matter of fact
[1:50:03] let me just read this quote there's so
[1:50:05] much to read but let me just read this
[1:50:09] let me start with this quote says
[1:50:17] he says we're living in this great
[1:50:20] strange time
[1:50:23] we look at the papers
[1:50:27] noticias we see Armageddon coming up
[1:50:30] we see tanks
[1:50:32] atomic bombs atomicas we see the end of
[1:50:36] the Gentiles is at hand
[1:50:39] we see the world right
[1:50:42] is
[1:50:52] well we know that so
[1:50:55] and we we're preparing for it
[1:51:01] but then Brandon also says here in the
[1:51:03] port seal
[1:51:06] now the battle started in heaven
[1:51:11] it'll be finished on Earth
[1:51:19] well so I asked
[1:51:21] were you with Michael
[1:51:28] ayatras
[1:51:29] were you with it
[1:51:33] anybody do you I know we don't remember
[1:51:36] that well but you know were you with
[1:51:38] Michael
[1:51:40] at that time
[1:51:42] now on Sunday brother Caleb said um
[1:51:51] is he going to stand alone solo
[1:51:56] so again the bride you know this is not
[1:51:59] for us we're gone buddy
[1:52:03] don't pertain to us
[1:52:07] so is Michael Gonna Be Alone Miguel Vice
[1:52:11] star solo
[1:52:13] yo we start a fight and we're not gonna
[1:52:14] finish it is my question
[1:52:20] ask yourself
[1:52:22] your message believer
[1:52:25] you're you're you're you're a Christian
[1:52:28] Cristiano you you you know what's coming
[1:52:32] we have received the words of Prophecy
[1:52:35] we know yes
[1:52:38] but in reality we want to find the loop
[1:52:40] around it
[1:52:43] because we are dealing with our fears
[1:52:47] oh my God Russian is coming up what
[1:52:49] we're going to do
[1:52:50] was establishes come against our people
[1:52:53] oh yeah
[1:52:56] we fear war
[1:52:59] with your death
[1:53:01] if you're a torture
[1:53:04] but we forget that we were there with
[1:53:06] Michael Miguel
[1:53:10] how is that possible
[1:53:13] how can we call ourselves
[1:53:16] Believers
[1:53:19] yet we're afraid
[1:53:22] of an event
[1:53:25] that is about you and I okay
[1:53:29] Armageddon is not about Russia is
[1:53:32] [Music]
[1:53:36] not about the Romans
[1:53:41] is not about the enemies of the states
[1:53:46] or the enemies of of Israel
[1:53:50] but they'll be there
[1:53:52] but who else is going to be there Miguel
[1:53:58] but he's not alone they don't know it's
[1:54:00] the solo
[1:54:01] so if we can change the way we see
[1:54:04] things
[1:54:07] stop thinking as a carnal American
[1:54:12] o and start thinking through the
[1:54:15] revelation of the word
[1:54:19] then you start seeing things a little
[1:54:21] clearly
[1:54:24] anyway uh
[1:54:27] we want to talk about Armageddon
[1:54:31] because the scripture simply says
[1:54:35] Revelation 16 16.
[1:54:39] simply reads
[1:54:41] and he gathered them together
[1:54:49] into a place called in the Hebrew tongue
[1:54:52] Armageddon is
[1:54:58] so it's a place
[1:55:01] we always think War Emperor
[1:55:04] Atomic power or destruction destruction
[1:55:08] it's a place
[1:55:10] so let's put the word to the side
[1:55:13] let's start the place
[1:55:16] say that again let's study the place
[1:55:20] why is this place so important
[1:55:24] in the Hebrew tongue
[1:55:27] Armageddon
[1:55:29] it means the the hill or the city of
[1:55:33] megida significance
[1:55:35] the brothers just went to Israel they
[1:55:38] drove by it
[1:55:40] beautiful place
[1:55:44] and and it described as as a very
[1:55:47] interesting point on in history
[1:55:53] it is a valley
[1:55:56] that that sits about 50 miles north of
[1:56:00] Jerusalem
[1:56:02] and uh there are things there more
[1:56:05] important more important than our fears
[1:56:07] it is
[1:56:09] if the brothers can show me a picture
[1:56:11] picture of the valley Valley of uh
[1:56:16] it's also known as the value of
[1:56:19] Georgio
[1:56:21] that means your
[1:56:26] personal
[1:56:30] we can look at the other turn another
[1:56:33] picture
[1:56:43] we can put the other two pictures uh
[1:56:46] with with that one
[1:56:53] that Valley
[1:56:55] you can you can just leave those
[1:56:57] pictures there yeah that Valley is is
[1:57:01] known to be
[1:57:05] it's about 14 miles wide
[1:57:09] about 20 miles long come on
[1:57:16] and uh
[1:57:18] many events have taken place in here
[1:57:23] there was there have been some some bad
[1:57:25] events now that picture
[1:57:27] the professor that took these pictures
[1:57:31] he's standing in Mount Carmel
[1:57:34] in Monte Carmelo
[1:57:37] he claims that that's the location where
[1:57:40] Elijah built his altar this is
[1:57:51] and the view of the valley you can see
[1:57:52] the Valley from the south all the way uh
[1:57:54] to the from the south East I guess to
[1:57:58] the all the way to the northwest
[1:58:01] [Music]
[1:58:04] in this Valley
[1:58:07] it's not just appointed for for that
[1:58:09] event
[1:58:12] the event of the end of the world
[1:58:17] in this Valley
[1:58:19] there was many battles
[1:58:22] Saul and Jonathan died on that Valley
[1:58:28] Gideon
[1:58:29] beat the midianites
[1:58:34] in this Valley
[1:58:41] uh King the youngest king of uh that we
[1:58:45] found in the Bible
[1:58:49] die in this Valley as well
[1:58:53] many battles have been fought in this
[1:58:55] Valley
[1:58:59] but the most outstanding things to me
[1:59:03] it's that the ministry of Elijah is
[1:59:07] everything you read about Elijah
[1:59:10] [Music]
[1:59:14] have you ever read the story of Elijah
[1:59:16] out running uh the king asked questions
[1:59:22] he around the king's Chariot for eight
[1:59:25] miles across that Valley foreign
[1:59:54] [Music]
[2:00:01] the
[2:00:08] events of overcoming already set in
[2:00:11] place Los ceventus
[2:00:14] history has a count of 35 battles
[2:00:23] been been fought in this in this Valley
[2:00:26] the first one in 2350 BC is
[2:00:34] de Cristo the last one recorded in 1973
[2:00:40] and the expected fight of Armageddon is
[2:00:48] 35 battles
[2:00:50] but I want to bring something here real
[2:00:53] quick
[2:00:58] receives the name of just real yeah just
[2:01:02] real correct yeah
[2:01:05] do you know where the name comes from
[2:01:09] have you ever read the story of Hosea is
[2:01:13] the lord gave him a son
[2:01:16] and in this is
[2:01:20] you go to the book of Hosea first
[2:01:23] chapter
[2:01:30] the third verse
[2:01:48] the daughter of Ibrahim and which
[2:01:51] conceive and bear a son
[2:01:58] and the Lord said unto him
[2:02:02] call his name Israel for yet a little
[2:02:05] while and I will avenge the blood of
[2:02:07] Israel upon the house of Yahoo to see
[2:02:10] the kingdom of the House of Israel
[2:02:24] and he shall come to pass at that day
[2:02:30] that I will break the bow of Israel in
[2:02:33] the valley of Jezreel Israel
[2:02:38] yes
[2:02:41] yet the number of the children of Israel
[2:02:43] shall be as the son of the sea
[2:02:46] which cannot be measure or number
[2:02:48] and he shall come to pass that in the
[2:02:50] place where it was said unto them ye are
[2:02:53] not my people there it shall be said
[2:02:55] unto them ye are the sons of the Living
[2:02:57] God
[2:03:13] then shall the children of Judah the
[2:03:16] children of Israel be gathered together
[2:03:18] and appoint themselves one head
[2:03:21] and they shall come up out of the land
[2:03:23] for great shall beat the day of jezrael
[2:03:29] is
[2:03:36] a place
[2:03:38] that's the place
[2:03:43] so many things
[2:03:45] is not just a battle or or a atomic uh
[2:03:50] end of the world
[2:03:53] [Music]
[2:03:57] is a tremendous purpose in it
[2:04:02] first of all
[2:04:04] what started in heaven
[2:04:08] well there was no time
[2:04:10] where there was only but beings that
[2:04:14] were created to worship God
[2:04:16] Is
[2:04:19] War started in heaven
[2:04:22] the loser gots kicked out to earth
[2:04:29] now that kind of brings a question for
[2:04:31] ourselves
[2:04:33] why do we feel that we're kicked out to
[2:04:35] the Earth ourselves
[2:04:41] here we are
[2:04:43] well we have a purpose too
[2:04:46] but this is the only chance because this
[2:04:50] is the only time we're humans
[2:04:56] he ends an event that started in the in
[2:04:59] the Eternal Realms
[2:05:03] because evil was found in Lucifer
[2:05:07] in Lucifer he was sent down and bound
[2:05:11] into a area of time
[2:05:17] and in time
[2:05:19] we finish that war
[2:05:21] we finished that word we ended
[2:05:25] in in time
[2:05:28] that ESO cuts the possibilities of that
[2:05:32] Lucifer to ever become an angel
[2:05:35] is
[2:05:38] bound in time
[2:05:40] then starts a thousand years of peace
[2:05:45] now how is it bound
[2:05:49] a chain of circumstances
[2:05:52] so I ask you again
[2:05:54] are you going to be there by status
[2:05:58] Armageddon are you gonna be there
[2:06:01] only if you're born again
[2:06:04] is
[2:06:05] the new birth important is is
[2:06:10] the youth here I asked these men over
[2:06:12] here
[2:06:15] now he has the sisters over here because
[2:06:17] it's not important is the new birth
[2:06:18] important at all it's important how
[2:06:22] important is
[2:06:24] the Bible says the great and terrible
[2:06:27] day of the Lord
[2:06:31] you think is just that one day that
[2:06:34] there's a battle
[2:06:36] yeah let me ask you
[2:06:39] how much time is a day
[2:06:44] A Thousand Years millennials so it makes
[2:06:48] a difference
[2:06:49] when you're born again you understand
[2:06:52] Nuevo if you go and live a thousand
[2:06:54] years of Peace
[2:06:58] well where are you gonna be those a
[2:07:01] thousand years if you don't make it
[2:07:04] think about it
[2:07:07] what makes the difference
[2:07:12] the scripture says he must be born
[2:07:17] because yeah why why all this while this
[2:07:21] even matters
[2:07:24] well it doesn't matter if if you're not
[2:07:27] born of the spirit
[2:07:31] it doesn't have a purpose but
[2:07:36] that day
[2:07:40] but he's not alone
[2:07:44] but he's not alone
[2:07:49] we gotta end where we started back there
[2:07:51] then
[2:07:53] we'll have a thousand years of Peace
[2:07:56] how about that
