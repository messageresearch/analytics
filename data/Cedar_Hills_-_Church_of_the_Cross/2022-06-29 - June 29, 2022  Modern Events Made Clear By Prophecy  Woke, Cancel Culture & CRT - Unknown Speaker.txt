we'll be sure to give you all honor and all glory glory in Jesus name amen you may be seated tonight we're gonna we're gonna Broach uh about three subjects and I don't know if uh if you have uh if you uh know about them but it's it's things that are that are interwoven in our society so much that maybe maybe people don't know about them but the three subjects that we're going to deal with is uh and CRT which is critical race theory he said I think is so how many have ever heard of of Woe some some people have it okay well maybe we'll we we will let you know a little bit how many have heard of cancer culture and and how many have have heard of critical race Theory it's very it's those those three uh uh subjects are are are very very prominent in our in our uh in in everyday life without people understanding but we're we're the they're so vast that it would take us time but but we're going to do the best that we can tonight in the time of pro appropriate to it and so in it to start before I I hand it off to brother William I I do want to read uh Genesis the third chapter and and this is the beginning or on on the earth because you all you we we know that that Satan is the the author of perversion yes this is and so so so but but this is on the earth is where it began the woke and it says this in Genesis chapter 3 and verse 5. this is where we're going to to launch off at this moment amen God bless you this evening um this is uh like brother Tommy said this is a vast vast subject you know we we see um uh different things um concerning woke it's it's not only uh it's it's a daily bait on a daily basis we we are bombarded by this and I wanna I wanna uh there there's a there's a there's a pride flag that is that is out there and and we see it we see it everywhere not only do we see it on private uh uh private structures but we also see it on government public structures as well as uh as we were uh discussing this is brought to my attention I I actually spoke a little bit about this in uh in Uganda now in Uganda in Uganda when I mentioned the pride flag is they had zero idea what that meant so that that tells me is of the condition that we are in so if they can uh put up that uh that slide here so on the on the left here the is the is the pride flag Alice now we understand that that the that the rainbow that that we know of it consists of seven colors okay um the pride flag consists of six colors and it was very interesting to see which color has been omitted going back to Let's if we can turn into Matthew 5 48. and it reads like this be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect so we have Perfection okay so we go up and we see um on the stature of a perfect man we do see the seven colors now what's interesting is there was uh there was a um there was an author many years ago who saw this who saw this flag Miro esta Bandera or he saw these colors and he says it is customary by the way his name is Isaac Asimov Su number is Isaac Asimov it says it is customary to list Indigo and at least Indigo as a color lying between blue and violet but it has never seemed to me that Indigo que indigo is worth the Dignity of being considered a separate color the sequence and by the way indigo is the color what is the step of indigo okay Indigo exactly right you got patience please Virginia knowledge and for patience godliness brotherly kindness so godliness was the color indigo it has been omitted now here's here's the here's the definition of indigo definition and this will kind of create a basis of what we're of what we're uh of what we're going to be talking about here is hablendo Indigo conveys integrity and deep sincerity it is powerful and dignified the color the color of indigo El color indigo reflects great devotion represents wisdom and justice all right well according to what we know as woke the I guess the Battle Cry you can say is Justice or a lot of times Injustice now when we look at godliness why has godliness been omitted why has this been taken away well we understand with Matthew 5 48. ye therefore Perfecto even as your father which is in heaven is perfect and we get that so many times of perfection we hear that many times well there's no way we can be perfect and I say of course if you take something away that is supposed to be there you cannot be perfect but with it there we can be perfect brother Brandon would say he said he tried to find the meaning of godliness in in four or five dictionaries he says and he says that he went over with brother Jeffries there is and he says that they found it together and he puts it simply as this godliness means significa to be like God what a contrast the scripture that brother Tommy just heard when the serpent would say they shall be as God to be like God were they already like God see they were they they were perfect and when and what they were in their condition they were perfect foreign to be like God he says he says oh you say that you can't do that he says oh yes you can oh see us now what what we see nowadays and what you know I I wanted to ask brother Jim a question concerning about what uh the way that he grew up we understand our condition now since since brother Jim is our senior here how was it like when you were growing up well and the uh 70s and 80s the trendy term was that the term that was popular called Trend in English how would you say it in Spanish you were either you just said the same in Spanish because I don't even know if there's a word in Spanish word you were either hip or you weren't hip wait uh later on when when the spirit of homosexuality started to attack the young people more they started using the term guruvi um very innocent things in a sentence but the only thing was if you weren't hip uh you could never be groovy and you were out you weren't accepted the people at school and stuff and and this thing on bookism their approach is the same thing are you woke is and how it's tied together do you do you now understand that words have meanings that's why when brother Branham says the greatest thing you can tell your brother is God bless you guys but what they use what what Society uses words is they use them not for benefit they use them as weapons and when a person or a country or a society will take a word to use it as a weapon for Destruction think about think about the words that are used so as as as brother Jim was saying in his generation I like what John Wesley said he says what one generation tolerates the next generation will Embrace this was there a couple hundred years ago but my how it does come exactly into our time what the previous generation thought of as okay as as as something innocent it was tolerated in our generation in my children's generation oh my goodness how it has infiltrated into our into our children's Generations big time is that right brother Jerry yes if I can relate it that happened just a few years ago and it involved Timothy when he was playing football [Music] Americano and he had to go get a physical he took okay well organ mountain now I guess watch what you say you know you don't know who's watching but he went for a physical and and I went in there and and I told the lady I said he's here for a physical so they gave us an iPad so I told Timmy just fill out your information you know um old you are your name your address things like that yeah so then he brings me an iPad the iPad with a he had like a concerned look on his face this was probably about two thousand fifteen I would say right around there anyways he has a concerned look on his face and I'm like you know so I I get he goes dad what are they asking me here so I look at the iPad and it has you know you know you know normal applications you have the top male or female you know sex male or female applications so he you know of course he puts mail but then right below that it says [Music] and then it starts getting well what do you identify as and and I'm like and then it starts getting into do you have have you had homophobic thoughts do you think you're gay bienza is homosexual and and and I and I and right there I stopped I said you're not answering these questions no more yeah because we all we all know that they they have taken prayer out of the schools right you know they they they they fired a coach I believe was in Washington that he was praying that despite not necessarily with the team but off to to the side and they fired him you know because they don't want prayer in school they don't want God in school so so I I take this iPad back and I said we're not answering these questions we're here for a physical right so then right there I see they're starting to plant a seed in the young people they're trying to get them to question what they are questions you know us I I identify as a male right but then the question is well what do you identify as well how could they do that because but the way the way the people look at it or or look at it is if I had they don't know I can I I was born a male yeah we're born males we're born females but we can identify now as a female you know that this this is where they they this is where where the for society and and people that that that pushed the lbgqt P plus and whatever there are about a hundred gender identifications this is not this is not what I believe it's going to look at you but this is this is where they get this is where they get their entrance your sex is what you were born with your gender is what you identify as is so a person that was born a man can identify himself as a woman but let me tell you if you're born a man that's your sexual you are identified your gender is a man remember in the beginning God created man Amen to that oh my god brother tell me what would then constitute a woman it it all depends who if you're in office if you're a political official you cannot give that the definition of what a woman is one elected official that'll tell you what constitutes a woman now do you know why our children are so bombarded they go they go to public schools and they want to they want to make sure that from the eight from the age of two to seven that those seeds are planted inside of them asking kindergartens students comfortable in the gender you were born in is they can't even fight why do they know what a boy is what what a girl it is when the political system won't even tell you what a what a woman is when the system of politics we know what a woman is we know what a man is because of the message of the hours that identifies who we are in Christ but they don't know and they will not give you a straight answer why was she called a woman because she was taken out of man whoa man you aren't you do we really I mean Public Schools it's just I I mean we we brother brother will talked about the flag we we just came from Norway right yeah and people have gone out maybe vacationing during the month of June if you go out during the month of June you are going right into the brother Jimmy you said that brother Branham said when when he was here he said in 1962 40 of our government was already homosexuals this is 50 plus years later go ahead go ahead and just to finish that that thought though it's out everywhere but like like Bert Tommy said it's targeting the young children I mean perfect example is is is a movie that was released the last last weekend it's called light year but in that movie which is which young children would like to watch there is a scene where two young ladies call them ladies women female that they're kissing sister so so they're after the young people you know I I read something the other day that said that said the devil doesn't need to hide anymore because he's out in the open Pakistan and we still can't see him you know he's out everywhere say it again say it again it says the devil doesn't hide anymore because he's out in the open and we still cannot see him you know it it's everywhere you know and and I found this quote Oh Brother Branham and it says when they're the the messages when their eyes were opened they knew him of course we understand to be woke is to have your eyes open to be able to see what he says in the it says and I probably I won't read the whole thing because it's kind of lengthy but it says in the last days the setting of the world would be just like it was when the dent house was destroyed at Sodom and Gomorrah this is not not in Noah's time as the floor and if we re if you if you've all read about it you know what happened in Sodom and Gomorrah says brother Jerry basically what happened when those two angels went to lot's house I'll help you on that if you don't remember uh they come to this house and knock on the door and these men is they they didn't want women he offered his his daughters but they wanted the two angels Los Angeles we're in a physical form because that's incredible do you you do you do you realize how all these three things that we're we're speaking about are are so interconnected how they're interconnected they're interconnected because if somebody would be watching us right now they're going to put a label [Music] um and the label is going to be if you believe that God sent a prophet is right nobody's ever told you that all right you're a heretic right so right away with the label they cancel you you're irrelevant now is because you are not according to what our view system is anymore because let me tell you wokism foreign can I say it again it is a religion is and their writings are scripture is is and if you're against their church now you're labeled as against their church because they believe when they are woke they have been born again that is the culture whereby we live in is that's why there was a church age between Philadelphia and laurecia foreign but let me tell you we're Heretics to somebody there ain't gonna be everybody that that believes like you well Brothers didn't Paul say after the Wake called heresy worshiped by the god of my father that's right it's it's it's the scripture of of is and the day that we're living but I'm I am proud to be called the Malachi for five minutes [Applause] and uh from what uh from what brother was uh Tommy was saying there's a there's a little quote I found out uh today it says wokeness cancels anything or anyone that doesn't bow to his Ideology Now we we see woke not only in in what we call the world but it has become or it has come into our denominations our churches you see you see pastors ministers that are preaching on woke and my question how is that Christiano we preach a message of Grace and how is that Grace being woke Gracia canceled culture preaches this believe what we say to believe or else we will destroy your life Council culture plays God while Christianity or what we believe pursue Grace so I I think that is that is that is so relevant in our society right now is that this cancer culture is there's something about it that doesn't seek forgiveness forgiveness is not enough for them they have so much they have so much anger in this angry at what has happened even if it doesn't even if it even if it hasn't affected them directly you say are upset at what happened 100 200 years ago come up with a victim's mentality and if you don't agree with their mentality they will do everything they can to destroy your I think you said something about a a movie that says there's a movie which again is called light year light year and that's why I made the statement we we the devil doesn't need to hide because he's just out there plain and simple where we can see him but us as parents we have young children that I'm sure they've seen the the the the trailer to the movie oh yeah let's go see that movie Mom and Dad um where us as parents we should be protecting our children but yeah we'll go and take them to see this movie that's why the devil's out there but but he said ah you can't see me come on bring your children bring your children no as Christians we we got to take a stand for something parents we gotta protect our children and make the stand for them also because let them know that that that they are God's Property we are God's properties protect our children they might not know what's going on but we gotta stand as parents even as Grandparents because the children come up to the grandparents and say hey Papa can you take me to the movies but I for one will not will not do that because they're targeting the young children that's why it says in this in this quote it says as the days in Sodom and Gomorrah he promised there would be a great perversion in the land is that not going on right now is that not going on right now it's perversion version of the Mind the version of the heart but that's why your eye of the heart needs to be open to God's word and I want to say it again by our pastor and the parents that should be protecting the children are taking the children to watch it standing for the truth in their homes stay at the Lord and the thing about it that is one thing that God never forgave Israel for yes when they pass their children through the fires and that is very dangerous is there passing people through the fire if you believe that it's wrong to see this this movie it might not just be Disney but other movies don't take your children to watch it let's not saith the Lord Brother Tommy that takes me to that to that scripture when it says train your child in the ways of the Lord and when he is old he will not depart from it but Satan takes that as well so we see that training the children [Music] in the ways well when they are old they can't look back and they can't say well remember that time when when when my mom and dad they stood for what was right no they'll save remember the time when my mom and dad just let me do anything I wanted to do that's how Satan is so Sly yes not only does does God want to teach our children so that when these these things do come up it's their lives they are prepared they're they're prepared for this is they're prepared for this fight they know exactly what to do but instead no it was it was uh it was uh a few weeks ago ASE una semanas I was talking with my neighbor and she was telling me well I I changed jobs in school she had been a teacher for over 20 years she says I was a teacher in an elementary school elementary and they were were coming out with curriculum coneste Corso about critical race Theory critical about being transgendered and all that this is I can't teach that now this is someone that does that that she might believe in God she might not I don't know but she says I can't teach that so why stop being a teacher yeah I'm being forced teach this to seven and eight year olds is that I can't do that uh brother will explain to people a bit more what is critical race Theory well we find out that wokeness critical race Theory Isa it's based on the belief is that if if you're white is Blanco you have privilege you have what's called White Privilege so that means that whatever is available locate a job whatever it is you have all the rights to that because of your skin color it doesn't involve any other race but but the white race it says according to to woke thought leaders racism is the foundational basis racismo is for American Structures and the country was completely designed for white people to rule Blanco based on what many woke leaders believe and teachers whiteness and white supremacy now Reigns Supreme in all fats in all facets of our society yes now check this out even if you have no links to racism or white supremacy or the oppression of blacks you are complicit usted because she it's all it says all white people are the problem imagine that imaginese in a nutshell that's critical race Theory and that is what they're teaching is they they want they want to put a is an A oppressor and then and then exactly in the oppressed and bring it through the generations in the in the Civil War era or or during slavery period which was uh very bad period during our Empire as as a nation but bringing it to and still make sure that that person remains guilty right that's exactly right you know what I mean that's exactly right and what they're trying to do is take is take Vengeance they want their vengeance aora they're they're not waiting for anyone else to do it but they want their Vengeance now Romans 12 19 says and this is where we have to be very very diligent in what we believe he caught up in this very easily Romans 12 19 says dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give Place unto Wrath for it is written vengeance is mine I will repay saith the Lord but what's amazing is that this is being taught in church this is being taught in mainstream churches this isn't just some random guy on the street corner mega churches are teaching this you know Iglesias grandis that that they need to have their Vengeance now wow but yeah in in the the word uh of back to woke if even though they're all interlaced it it is uh it its Origins are in marxismo from Marxism it was transferred to post-modernismo the people's way of thinking became uh they they believed uh the marxists believed that the consciousness of the people had to be raised to see the difference between them and capitalism and whoever was in power at that time through what was called progress discourses was the prevailing thought of that day this is an example Christianity and 800 A.D in said a gay man was a depraved sinner morally corrupt uh in 1900 a gay man was considered insane it was a mental disorder in uh but in post-modernism 21st century liberalism liberalism became dominant and homosexuality became normal could I be the scripture yes description is very very clear on this is going to read it real quick we can go into this one and it's really going to get sticky horses but but and and you you forgive us in this sense but three lesbians uh initiated black lives matter that being being born an african-americano that's why they say I say they hijack all these terms if you're born hispanic white or African-American or whatever you can't have you can't it's it it it it is uh uh what's the term it's the way you were born it's it but they wanted to equivocate being lgbtq plus civil rights and it's not one and the same one is the way you were born the other is the choice all right okay so this this is why what you say is that in its Inception it it it it it it was a being woke is a it was was a good terms and again it's a religion and you got to go according to what is being expressed that that is but when scripture comes to us it doesn't use the word woke it uses the word awake and it says awake to righteousness for some have not the knowledge of God foreign you know now they're they're and you're gonna go we're going to another ball of a a thing that's going out that now that Roe versus Wade was overturned all right and now the sanctity of life there's no sanctity of life so many abortions Millions babies that have been aborted make the Holocaust look like like if it was just something casual yes people are just are just demonstrating everywhere because they want the woman's right to be able to abort and to be able to do this until the week that that baby is full term they could still terminate the pregnancy and people they stand for it but let me tell you we as the body of Believers believes in a new birth We Believe being justified by faith Sanctified in the experience with the Holy Ghost coming into the world and being born again but we believe that the spirit of God dwells inside of us the person of the Lord Jesus Christ lives inside of our hearts the greatest responsibility you have for your children they are they receive the new birth I would not do anything again amen they have no chance if they're not opportunity that's okay Ephesians 5 14 or for he said awake thou that sleepest is and arise from the dead Christ shall give the light now you think of where this woman's rights thing came from a recipients and back in brother branham's time in the temple of Branham the last time brother Brenham voted in an election he voted for Mr Nick Nixon [Music] and he said a horrible thing's been done here in the United States permitted women to vote and they elected the wrong man correct that that in itself they could hang me out to dry just with that one statement imagine Brothers saying that in in the early 1960s Same Spirit is this God degenerating is degenerating more until now the woman can choose to abort her baby a week before she's going to ask and this nation was warned against all this is and the condition is because they rejected God's problems the prophet of God speaks to us he says one of the finest papers in the field The Herald of his coming that's fast pray fast pray fast prayer found a trumpet you see it all the time and you see the society and it's just a unquote now yes but back to the quote we're going to have a great breaking of the day do they do that why why do they do that they want a Great Awakening they're crying believing that there will be Awakening is they're good people why is it what have they done they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride is they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done that's what's making them feel that way is something is supposed to happen they're looking for it way off in the future is when it's already happened right by you that's why our pastor says I'm not looking for it because we are not woke we have always been the righteousness not go to war paranoid but come to Awakening do not go to the guilty to be an overcomer more than an overtime and it puts every person on the same plane toys that's why we go to Africa because we love our our African our black brothers because we love our White Brothers to Mexico because we love our Brown Brothers one of these days we'll go over to Tokyo one of these days we we are there are some people here that are Native Americans [Music] um can I say this one last statement okay you see you hear all these beautiful races these beautiful colors reminds you what the prophet says why it's God's beautiful bouquet of flowers Las Flores De Flores God's beautiful flowers of every race every color it's a beautiful bouquet it goes what I don't know beautiful okay second current second Corinthians 5 17. it says therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature cuantos all things are passed away we don't have to worry about what happened years and years ago all things are passed away behold all things are become new I'll finish with it with this scripture Psalms 101 before mine eyes I hate the work of them that turns that turn aside it shall not cleave to me a forward heart shall depart from me I will not know a wicked person no Pandora and the forward the word forward in the Hebrew yes [Music] said it in Spanish it's a perverse it means perverse significa perverso amen let us pray one for the other and uh pray for our children and some people when they come home from school and they come home grouchy now you might know a little bit what the pressures are going through somebody tells them you know the church you go to is it's a it's it's it's not the real church and then they tell them you're not who you say you are but I love the message tells us where we come from what we're doing here where
