all I want to thank God for this for the privilege and honor just to give us that Breath of Life I thank God for that and I know you you probably already heard when my wife was sick last year you might say well why you're repeating again what she said for the devil's sake I'm telling him for the devil's sake I'm telling him I thank the Lord for the miracle that he did for her he healed her so much that she has so much energy now she won't stop but I thank the Lord for that for your prayers also I thank uh I want to thank our pastor brother Caleb for the confidence and for all your prayers we keep praying for him and the the ministry that are with him in Poland now amen it just uh for all this stuff that was been going on you know we say well nobody's perfect and I understand that but Paul said let's run to Perfection people say well people say well I I'm hanging by a thread you heard people say that before right I'm hanging by a thread just make sure it's by the Hem of His Garment God puts his trust in you puts his confidence you that's why in Psalms 23:4 it says though I walk through the valley of shadow of death I will fear no evil we we look at the story of of Peter now he was a rough guy he was a liar deceiver he like to curse he would he would swear and he chopped a man's ear off and I know he wasn't going for the ear he was going for his head actually as we see the story of Peter he was a very he had issues you know who doesn't have issues so one day he was with Jesus so they took him uh to the Courtyard the sandrian ccil to get judged he got arrested for that and Peter was there in the crowd now Peter went only a a not too far he went a little ways so he was in the crowd he was uh getting warmed up in the fire so in the crowd somebody said aren't you a follower of Jesus and Peter said no I'm not goes I'm not a follower I'm not I was never associated with him how many times have we denied Jesus now we know that Peter denied him three times how many times have I denied Jesus Maybe by my actions the life I live they say that your life speaks louder than words but you got to remember one thing we know that Peter was he was bad but Jesus still loved him when the angel was at the tomb of of of Jesus when Jesus was resurrected the angel told Mary Magdalene and the rest that were there you go tell my disciples you didn't name each disciple he said go tell my disciples and Peter he named Peter for a reason specifically he named him by his name I believe he wanted his he wanted uh his critics to to know that I still love Peter and and you look at this story and you see Jesus he tells Peter you know what Peter that's okay I will build my church upon the revelation of who I am and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail maybe you're going through trials right now but in 1 Peter 2:9 it says here but you you you're a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peul people not a weird people pecul 1 Peter 29 or 210 I'm sorry which in time past you were not a people you were once a sinner you were once a slave to sin you were not a people but it says here but now you are the people of God which have not obtain Mercy but now you have mercy and I believe that with all my heart in Micah [Music] 78 Rejoice well you said Daniel I have a lot of mistakes but your mistakes are not final your failure is not final you can tell your critics Rejoice against me all my enemies when I fall I shall rise again when I sit in darkness the Lord shall be a light unto me you might have made a mistake I made lots of mistakes I made tons of mistakes but you're not one you might have failed but you're not not a failure you might be down but you're not out I thank the Lord for his grace and his Mercy that we're still under under the blood but in time past we were not a people but now we are a people of God and I'm so happy that we're Malachi four people not just a prophecy but we are the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 I want to he read here in Isaiah 2816 therefore thus sayth the Lord the Lord God behold I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone and we know who's the the corner Cornerstone that's God the Lord Jesus Christ a tried Stone a precious Corner Stone a sure Foundation he that believeth shall not make make haste I'm gon to mistake that again he that believeth shall not make haste his fa faith will not panic your faith will not panic never turn your back on the enemy you will prevail against the gates of hell he will have a church without spot and wrinkle no blemish perfect in the eyes of God first Peter 2:7 now to you this stone is precious but to those who do not believe the stone The Village rejected has become the Cornerstone but I like this to you who believe this stone is precious to you that believe this word is precious to you that believe this message is precious to you that believe Mal is precious to you that believe the anointing is precious to you that believe God is precious now I'm going to say something personal here now this is for me now you got every man here here every husband can say that about their wies my wife Julet is precious to me she's been a great example I thank the Lord for that but God is precious for his healing power and you as we go through life when we become Christians our lives are marked and people notice that my life is marked when you act different people already know who you are they know you better than what you know yourself and that's what happened to Peter they knew he was a follower of Jesus Peter never rejected Jesus he never rejected Jes he knew he was the Lord Jesus Christ he was Christ the anointed Peter never rejected that part he only rejected him as a follower as associate how much do have we done that well I'm a message believer I uh I believe the message but our lives show different so I I say tonight look at at at uh at uh Shamar shamgar was a just a ordinary farmer he was getting whipped year after year and shamgar was getting tired the Philistines would come and still his heart all the time he looked at his wife she looked beat looked at his kids the same way they looked whipped they looked beat shamgar said I can't live like this anymore so one day his great great great great great great grandfather was sitting outside the tent mzc came up to him and he gave him meat and gave him milk and he told Abraham you told Abraham thy seed shall possess the gates of its enemies until Shamar didn't recognize who he was he would get whipped year after year so he looked at him goes you know what I got he got his Ox it's a long stick had a pointed in at the end he used the to poke the the cattle to to direct them to go forward so that's what he would he did he beat 600 of his enemies with that 600 Philistines and the word of God says one shall take a thousand 1,000 today 1,000 tomorrow one victory at a time one day at a time so the devil the devil being so stupid he only sent 600 of his enemies and we know that the devil knows the scriptures he didn't know that part that one shall take a thousand and that's the way shamgar defeated the enemy just with a stick that's what we got to do just by the word you got to recognize who you are where we come from and where we're going hallu Luke 10:19 behold I give unto you power to tread upon serpent you have the power God never allows pain in your in your life without a purpose blessed is he that overcomes he created you to be an overcomer it doesn't matter what you're going through right now there's something greater inside of you if if Peter had the key to unlock the the [Music] door on the day of Pentecost acts 238 repent and be baptized that's where we come in because in Luke 17 it says the kingdom of God is within you kingom we just don't have the key now we have the kingdom inside of us we go through things in life there is no explanation sometimes God will make you go through something that you fear the most so you can wipe that off your life something that you fear the most God will do it purposely just to get that fear out of you you're not a Survivor you are an overcomer there's a difference you are an overcomer we want to remind Satan this tonight he had 2,000 years he's had 2,000 years to stop this message he's had 2,000 years to stop this bride you can't do it so God knows you can meet the challenge of the age God has predestinated predestinated you to to this age God has always mindful you what is man that God is always mindful of you might say God is forgot about me you might say God is silent just for a little while he's testing your faith he wants to know where you're at but the shadow of the king is here tonight the devil's already defeated Bel is defeated doubt is defeated fear is defeated everything is defeated I would like to read something from Brother bam ins sign 1962 and when a man or a woman is dressed in full armor full armor of God it ain't power it's Authority the Devils will scream and breaks will death itself will not shutter and the graves will open you might say I lost a loved one why did I lose my parents why did I lose my son my daughter why did Death why did they die maybe there's a reason maybe God wants you to resurrect them but I'm going to read this in the exposition of the seven churches but thank God in the last age there will be a a group rise up and who is that group tonight the true Bride of the last day and she will listen to that Spirit she will rise up you are that group now here it is you get ready you all ready this is what brother B say now here it is you get ready he commissioned his church to cast them Devils out there you are in my name they shall cast out devils in my name you will cast out Devils it is written the word is is in the brigh and she does she does it in the name and she has th say you have th say the Lord the word will defeat Satan anywhere any time any place in any condition thank the Lord for his grace for redeeming us now we are more than conquerers we have the inheritance we're more than conquerors so we're we're dealing with a defeated enemy sickness is defeated death is defeated it's a testing time it's one good evidence to us that God is with us when we're tested for all children children of God are tested and tried so trials brings there's trials bring a purpose it makes you it starts forming your character if the devil tells you that you're nobody if that's the case why is he always after so whenever a thief breaks into a house he will never break into an empty house there's nothing valuable that's why the devil's always trying to get you because there's something valuable inside of you you know what drives a devil crazy when you ask God for something and he doesn't give it to you but you can still serve God the same way that's what drives him crazy David made this statement this day I am weak but you're still anointed king you might be weak you might be sick that doesn't matter you're still anointed say we're a seed not just any kind of seed but the Royal Seed of Abraham you can be weak you can be sick depressed anxiety but you still have the Royal Blood In You weakness and anointed they stand together as long as we're in the will of God nothing can stop this nothing can stop you you might be going through chaos but one remember one thing one victory at a time we do have the Victory and God is more than able to take full control of your situation how many love him tonight I just want to read this last part brother B says here on the token you apply it and say Lord I am going after my son and my daughter they might be out in the world I claim her Satan you turn her loose I am coming after her I apply my token you might say well she has a token yeah but he says you apply your token your holy spirit that lives within me and go catch your daughter I'm going after her with your anointing upon you and he'll do it amen amen God bless you God bless brother Daniel he was telling us up in the front he didn't know what he was going to preach about that's strange huh you please stand as we read a scripture God bless our brother Daniel may the Lord continue giving him more G to speak a little bit this evening i' like to bring a little bit of light on the faith of Isaac many times I've heard a little bit of the faith of Isaac but I wanted to bring a little bit of light on it this evening if we could turn to uh the Book of Genesis chapter 26 I like what brother Daniel said he said that we're not surviving but we are overcoming amen and in this little story we're going to read about Isaac he also had his difficulties uh God gave his father Abraham a big promise but he needed to have an experience of his own amen amen just like each and every one of us you might have a family member maybe your parents or grandparents that had an experience God but we need to have our own experience with God because without an experience you can be like Peter go from service to service and never be converted that's why Jesus told him that once you are converted then strengthen your brother that way you could take care of your brother and that's what we want that's what our pastor had asked of us he asked us are we our Brother's Keeper we will not be our Brother's Keeper if we have not had a conversion we're just going to be worried about our own business of our own things that we are doing let's go ahead and read Genesis 26 in verse one and there was a famine in the land beside the first famine that there was in the days of Abraham and Isaac went unto ailec King of the Philistines unto gerar amen God bless the reading of his word you may be seated here we have uh Isaac in the beginning of the scripture as he was uh confronting a crisis when there is a crisis the first thing that somebody would like to do maybe something uh serious arises maybe something like Co in Isaac's case what he wanted to do he wanted to leave he wanted to leave from where he was at and that's what one does when there's a crisis in the home one thinks I'm battling in work maybe things aren't going well for me my my brothers things are going well for them maybe he had a friend there maybe he had a friend that was calling him come over here I'm over here in Egypt and the River Nile is rolling flowing fully the Nile River is running strong there's water to for everything but here where where Isaac found himself the Bible says that there was a famine how many here can go without can go hungry I can't go without eating I know there's Brothers here that are good at that they God has blessed them in fast but my body it struggles with I can't go without eating and my wife can tell you and all you have to do is just look at me right and here was Isaac he began to pack his bag he was maybe in communication with his friend and there he was going towards Egypt can you imagine the son of the father of the faith in route to Egypt but when the Lord Lord had appeared to him he appeared to him and he told him in verse two and the Lord appeared unto him and said go not down into Egypt dwell in the land which I shall tell thee the first thing that comes to the mind is somebody when they want to leave they want to go on route to somewhere sometimes they don't even know where they want to go and we've seen it we weren't born yesterday we've seen it and the people come and maybe a little bit of pressure is applied and all of a sudden they're gone they might go to another place and then later on they come back same as as they had left but when one remains just like God wanted Isaac to remain in ger there is a key to remain there's a key to remain and to stay in one there's a scripture in ecclesiastics 7:14 in the day of prosperity be joyful but in the day of adversity consider God has also ha set the one over against another to the end that man should find nothing after him as us as humans we want to figure out our future you want to figure out well this is happening so I need to do this I got to prepare this and square away that but many times we have heard our pastor has told us that our future is already fixed that's why it says in ecclesiastics to rejoice in adversity take inventory see how your life is going let me tell you the Lord is not going to let you die of hunger because the Bible says that I've never seen a righteous forsaken or his seed begging for bread how many here this evening descendants of Abraham our future is already set it's fixed all we have to do is stay established stay in the faith we know that we go from Faith to Faith we're speaking of the faith of Isaac Isaac had so much faith just to have been with his father if you can imagine Isaac when the experience that Abraham had when God appeared to him this changed all of Abraham to go and do a sacrifice as he was going to do it's something crazy it's craziness can you imagine take your son and go sacrifice it's a craziness but that remained marked in Isaac it maybe traumatized him but that was a good trauma if I can say it that way he saw the faithfulness of his father he saw how faithful his father was to what he believed so much that he that he took him to an altar I don't know what I I don't have an idea what Isaac thought when he saw his father with a knife appear like this over him and God speaking to the angels look he's going to do it better go down and stop him can you imagine how fast that angel moved he already had his hand right here that's why it is important to instruct our children instruct them in the word maybe they might hear a little bit here and a little bit there and they might begin to stay that's all Isaac had he never had an experience with God Jehova never appeared to him so all he had to continue on forward was to see what his dad did that was his belief but after he found himself with God the scripture said that God appeared to him when one has an experience with God I know that each and every one of us here is different it doesn't matter if we're different nobody stays the same no one stays the same after that experience Peter Peter as brother Daniel said he had his issues but when Jesus went into the ship with them they wanted to pull the Nets but they couldn't because there was so much fish in them he stayed hooked himself he said what's going on here I fished my whole life there was no fish in the water that's how Isaac was so when God told Isaac where he needed to stay he began to work CU he had had experience with God he told him where to go and where to stay even if it was an ugliest place that was his place God was going to bless him there God was going to establish him there and he began to make the wells of his father they were actually already made they were covered the Philistines hated that family so much that they had come and filled those Wells with dirt and don't think it's just oh let me call this company and they could make a well company and make new well they had to dig it up themselves it's a lot of work to make a well but he began to work that's why God told him stay here I will that's why we go from Faith to Faith if something they don't give you it doesn't work out it doesn't work out just continue on forward he he found this well and he began to uncover it and when he got to the bottom the water began to come up forth the Philistines came they said what are you doing here this is our water can you imagine how much they had already worked they told them that's our water and they began to argue and ISAC he wasn't going to argue he just told his man get your tools and let's go he named that well esek because there there was enemy enity there was fight and contention and he was is the son of the father of the faith he wasn't going to go to the side and go fight with somebody over there just for a well when God had already told him he was going to bless him he took all his men and they left they went to another place they begin to dig and the same thing happened Philistines came and they said hey what are you still doing here this is our well in that well he also named it Isaac was a well Namer Abraham was an alter Namer it didn't matter where he was he always always made an altar it's for the enemy to know where he had been and where God had taken him out from and how God had blessed him with a strong Mighty hand that well he named it which means contention he wasn't going to be fighting the people of God are not fighting in our pastor just preached to us that seed doesn't fight seed but we can fight the contrary seed that the majority of the time it's in side of us we don't have to go that far we don't have to go look for fights out there the fight is here we have to take ourselves to the side that's what Isaac had to do he didn't want to fight he didn't he didn't care about their opinion he didn't care of his opinion if they came and told him hey that's my w but in this day we have an opinion if somebody comes and they say oh no it's not like that we get all bent out of shape and right away we want to fight we want to fight that's not the seed we want to fight with because our fight is against it's not against flesh and blood it's principalities and Spirits as our fight amen amen Abraham preached in Genesis 13 verse eight and Abraham said unto lot let there be no strife and I pray thee between me and thee and between my Herdman and thy Herdman for we are Brethren amen amen that's what that's what Abraham that's why Isaac just got up and left at the end they came to a well which they dug up that the Philistines didn't know nothing about what the Philistines hated not what they were doing it's what they were they they could not see the descendants of Abraham they couldn't support them because they wouldn't stay still like our brother Daniel mentioned Satan has had 2,000 years he couldn't he hasn't been able to stop us and he hasn't stopped us he can't so what is it that's going to take us to be able to take us to somewhere to to better and I don't know each and every one of your lives our pastor preached to us he preached to us about a love of that experience I read a quote where faith is a substance Peter didn't have the love John had in his heart John was an agency of the love of God can you imagine being the agent of love that someone that is low in in love that maybe is battling with whatever it is we're not going to begin to name anything because we don't want to enter into problems but what it has to say is that love conquers all things with love you can do [Music] anything brother bam says that John was the agency of love he had found himself with God and the philes the Philistines could not stop Abraham or his descendant it's because Isaac Isaac had an experience Jehovah appeared to him and he spoke to him he was the agency of love and he connected there he was he found himself low and then he filled himself up with love and then after that they couldn't stop him nothing could stop him the Bible says in chapter or verse 12 Isaac also had his problems but he stayed stable in one he stayed there where God told him and he started to plant in verse 12 then then Isaac swed in the land and received in the same year 100f and the Lord blessed him and man waxed great and went forward and grew until he became very great he blessed him so much that that he began to grow in that place the Philistines began to hate him even more then Envy be uh came en Envy started but it was already too late God had already blessed him he had stayed faithful and God began to bless him and the Bible says you continue reading chapter 26 that the king came first of all the king R ran him out of town because he had gotten so powerful and he said you better leave because you're now powerful more powerful than me better just get out of here but for the time of the Harvest 100 fold you that know how to add maybe he planted a field of 100 crop 100 acres it got it grew real fast and the Bible says that fear began to enter fear began to enter into the king all his subjects in the kingdom and the Bible says that the king came to visit him and he brought men with him and what the king wanted he came in peace and he sub subjected himself to him he said look we come in peace what we want isn't an alliance we want to be friends we want Union because we fear your God because we see how God is with you first he ran him out of town then afterwards he wanted to be his friend that's all the things are brother the devil he doesn't sleep and he's not dumb where he's losing ground wanted to get ahead but you know what ISAC he believed so much in what he was he's standing on that he didn't take bad for bad that wasn't his characteristic his characteristic was that of his father he was a Son of God he wasn't going to pay bad for bad because they stole his Wells his water they treated them bad that's what a Christian does he don't pay bad for bad we don't pay bad for bad we pay good the Bible says that he made a a party gave them to eat fed them and he blessed them and sent them on his road when one stays faithful when you stay faithful in the place that God has called you to God has great plans don't try to figure out the future future is not in US it's in the hands of God God bless [Applause] you amen praise the Lord can you praise the Lord tonight can you stand can you lift your hands unto the Lord the Lord is here and if you need anything from the Lord just lift your faith unto the Lord praise the [Music] Lord little girl was lying there the people all were weeping they just laughed at Jesus when she said she's only sleeping but as he took her by the hand she began to live again some began to praise the
