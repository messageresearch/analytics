how many came expected to hear from the lord this evening amen let us turn into our scriptures it's going to be found in james chapter four versus seven and eight in santiago capitulo cuatro verso and this is going to be a little bit of a recap of submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you draw night to god and he will draw nigh to you and then james five verse eight santiago cinco verso be also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the lord draweth nigh amen i want to thank our pastor and the ministry for this opportunity hey man so we had a great trip we had some great services some great preaching and we were we were blessed by brother on friday we were blessed by brother ben and brother will vienna ben and manuel tambien and we all know how they do it brother ben he's an awesome preacher and uh myself and brother danny we uh we uh we spoke on saturday morning i forget exactly who it was on saturday evening that gave their testimony and of course brother tommy junior on on saturday night romano tommy junior and as he always does he knocks it out of the park [Music] you know tommy has been such a great preacher for a long time he surely knows how to get everybody going the whole the crowd moving and he's he's awesome and of course uh that we had a couple of a few other brothers that gave a testimony on sunday morning testimonials uh domingo por la manana and uh he doesn't know this yet but i think i might be a little bit a little bit hurt with our pastor here no no because on sunday morning he preached twice domingo por la manana and this is like back to back services okay so i think brother caleb i think you owe us back to back one year too and of course as as we all know our pastor is phenomenal you know great preachings great services great food as always you know what i like from the brothers out there is man they're they're they're all i don't know any of the details i i honestly don't care to know any of the details of harmony a lot of respect towards each other and every time you you know they do something for you or you tell them thank you for whatever it is that they did they always say and they say i'm i'm here to serve you and it doesn't matter if it's the you know the preacher's wife the pastor's wife the the preachers the the the laity they all say that no importance so you want to know that something that's kind of funny i don't know how many i've been to mexico city but the traffic is insane so i mean that's it i i told brother raul that he almost gave me a heart attack like a hundred times over here i'm like i'm like i'm like hey wait wait wait wait and he's like just looks at me like this is normal here they get like inches away from the bumpers of you know of the vehicles in front of them or to the motorcycles they're like inches away and uh the funny thing was this though so when you get to the when you get to the streetlights and i saw this a few times okay so this is just like one occurrence that there's so much traffic and it's so crazy they drive so crazy out there that that even the dogs wait at the stoplight i was totally cracking up with with the brother because i was like man the dogs even you know have enough sense not to run out in traffic and we're coming to the red light he stops the cross traffic light turns green and there goes the dog you know so so a little bit to give again a little bit of a recap here what we spoke on so the theme of the subject was behold the bridegroom cometh and i i i honestly didn't you know the brother tommy jr has sent the text of what the theme was like a week in advance you know but i honestly didn't even think about it i was hoping i wasn't going to speak real in no series i always tell brother caleb give my give my time to somebody else but uh nonetheless you know it felt our lot to speak and wednesday night the lord gave me this thought right here and it might be a little bit different when we're normal we're we're normally uh used to speaking about because everybody knows that the lord jesus christ is coming amen that's what we're looking forward to right amen how there's not a lot of amen how many are waiting hey man how many are waiting for that bright group to come contoso you know so so here here was this angle that the i believe that the holy spirit gave me yesterday and i asked the brothers the question there and and uh when we've heard this year before and i asked them the question how many here that have been serving the lord for 50 years let's see raise your hands one uno like i know we've all been here saving the lord for a lot longer than that i've known most of you all all your lives days how many years brother no entertainers 20 years well he's becoming a church and he was about 20 years old right so i asked him we all know we all know that the word rapture means to be taken by force right how many know that the word rapture means to be taken by force significa but out of your 20 30 40 50 years that you've been serving the lord how many do they have to force to want to want to go see the lord necessity do you have to be forced i mean that's what that's what we serve the lord for right we we're we're waiting for an out of your 10 years have you been serving the lord how many don't want to see the lord how many is the lord going to have to force you to be raptured let's see with a show of hands how many how many have to be forced one uno two those okay so now so now here here here's where the thought that the lord gave me right here okay okay so uh you know i don't have time to go out into all the background i've been here yes so so so we see a magnet right a magnet is is attracted to to to steel to iron aluminum is a metal that cannot be uh there's no attraction there aluminium so that's what i told the brothers there and uh in mexico is is is there there has to be an attraction there right there has to be an attraction and and okay so you get the negative side you try to put it to the metal to the positive side and it's going to stick well okay so here we so here on the verse seven we have the resistance right the resistance first day we have the attraction okay so so now there so now as we i always seem like we always talk about mountains right statue of a perfect man perfecto so so we have to climb that mountain right faith virtue knowledge say the patience temperance et cetera et cetera et cetera right right see yes okay so so then i i asked i asked the question i asked i told him that and i asked the question then what was the attraction on the mountain right brother brandon preached the message what is the attraction on the mountain now throughout all the bible we can see where where the holy spirit where god comes down right people say oh god doesn't descend the god doesn't come down absolutely there's plenty of examples in the bible where when god descends he descends to the top of the mountain amen amen okay so each and every one of us we have to also climb that mountain that statue of a perfect man question i ain't talking about drawing a piece a pitch or something either to cause to move in a given position or or a approach [Music] to cause a person or thing to move towards and i told them all well you know before me and my wife got married there was an attraction there right uh and i hope everybody has an attraction you know with their wives and stuff like that right there was attraction there i told them all her fair skin her blue eyes her brunette her hair there was an attraction there was an attraction there well for me there was an attraction for me so after church i would go and go talk to her because there was an attraction i'd be seeing the people and i was there checking her out right now she's probably like oh my god not again but but there was an attraction there right i was attracted to her and then of course there was there of course there was a mutual attraction there i would say like this me and just just in type so londipo and her being the bride of christ there was there was an attraction to her right attraction and and we being the bride of christ we have to be dressed right there has to be an attraction and not just because we preach good or we're related to the minister that doesn't that doesn't mean that the lord's going to come for us right it doesn't mean that we attract the lord no significance are you following me there's an attraction there because there's a lot of men of out of medals that are not attracted by the magnets okay right but there has to be an attraction and i told him there so so is it that the lord and i'm not finished with this brother is it that the lord is coming on his own or is there something that's inside of the bride of christ that's going to be drawing him in him amen because remember the spirit and the bride they come there's got to be something just like in my wi-fi there was something for in her that would draw me that would pull me do that that's what that's why the prophet preaches that message what is the attraction so just just like how that magnet comes and there's like that invisible force that that pools you can't see the force of the magnet when it's coming to the metal just a circle but the force is there amen amen amen with that if we get a chance i'll finish again a little bit later not that i'm asking to preach okay give my time to somebody else hey man but that's just a small little recap my time is done but god bless you all vermont thank you brother ronnie for you know every time we go on a trip um yeah it's such a good feeling to come back home to know that we accomplish what god has called us for founding pastors always taught us so when when we know that we're doing what god called us to god then we could i could look at you today and say congratulations to you that stay here and and toil and pray for for us when we go out in the field and stand behind the cause is we we know that god has god that's the reason god blesses this church amen it was such a privilege for me amen this is my first missionary trip back to from since covid and and many times when they go without me it's it's like a dagger in my heart but you know as we began to minister to the people you know a lot of times we don't realize how hungry the people are out there el pueblo and and the children of god are such a needy people puerto so when you go they they understand that we're bringing forth god's word and they know we have a purpose and they began just to i have never seen any of you preach that way you know i told brother hector we have a greater calling you know i remember our founding pastor told me once he said you're not going by yourself solo he says but i'm going with you and i always remember that because many times we may be preaching the gospel but before we know it the gospel is being made alive and right in front of us you know it's really tremendous tremendous what god does you know towards the end when brother caleb finished on sunday you know we had a lot of healing going on on saturday but on sunday they brought a demon-possessed girl that was possessed when she came to the front domino and brother our pastor began to to to talk to mr you know and she wouldn't look at him at all she she would push her his hand away and he said look at my eyes you know and many times it's not as easy as people think munches vessels but once he got down to the root of the problem our pastor was saying as he was leaving out the doors he almost didn't recognize her he handed her a bookmark and with a smile she looked in his eyes and accepted it you know so even if we just go for one soul obama you know it it's worth it all vale la pena you know what i i believe that that that the ministry that god has placed here it's a unique ministry i don't believe we we go into the world to try to get churches and put them under our pastures but we are there to help the people you know and that's what god's called us foreign so when you see and we see the power of god come down many many for many people it becomes common yeah said the message that god gave our prophets it's continuing church and you're the vessels that god has used in this last days that's powerful espo so you you know many times we forget where god's brought us from we forget all the work that's being done out there we stepped into this church almost 20 years ago and so we go we we went to brother parker's church and just to see how hungry the people are very his vision was for the people to vision that was always his vision and to see this vision begin to be fulfilled i want to share something with you as i finish here i was preaching on the roar of the lion but god took me to joshua but i went to joshua 14. and the page was ripped out of my bible you know and and i know almost joshua 14 by heart didn't slow me down and it said there was no day like that before it or after it the children went into the promised land to spy out the land losing and there was 10 that brought back a bad report but joshua how great god is that it doesn't matter what happens if god promises you something and you stand behind the promise this caleb was already looking at the mountain del monte figuring out how he was going to take the mountain that's why they come back and here's joshua 40 years later or caleb forty years later akista caleb our founding pastor paved the way for us and we're just following him in his footsteps you know so all we could do is give all honor and glory to god's word you know we just preach and and and things happen brother hector hector you got to give your testimony to our church such a blessing that we had in his testimony god bless you i just want to thank our pastor for the opportunity that he gave each and every one of us to uh many love the lord jesus amen amen i just want to read a scripture real fast found in isaiah in 66 is this is thus saith the lord the heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool amen so as we heard we we had a great trip [Music] and i had a brother caleb had asked me he had called me and asked me if i'd wanted to go to mexico and uh it had been uh actually i had made a mistake when i was there i said it had been 16 years since i had been to mexico city but it had been 16 years since i was in chihuahua so i really hadn't been out uh since uh you know like with the with the team just have some ailments that would cause me not to be able to make it you [Music] don't know give blame to the devil but i don't know what anyways um i got there and i was feeling really bad and so you know i began to get thoughts in my head like you know so we give credit to the devil but sometimes we create those things right see devil's not a creator right so he takes our word and he creates off of it so the question was asked if you know when one of the ministers was preaching or during the prayer line the question was asked do you believe or speak and believe your own word right and so a lot of times we speak the wrong thing and the devil believes our word believes hater he knows god's a creator and so in a way so i i was feeling really really bad and uh brother caleb prayed for me and uh god was graceful enough to and gracious enough to to heal me [Music] um so i mean i ended up you know getting a little sick but uh the question would be asked to myself right and so as brother ben was just talking right now when i and and before you know let me let me get off the subject cause then uh he was telling me about he was giving me a little pre-preview of his testimony and he started talking about the grace of god and the love of god and the grace of god in his life and he said that you know all i can see is grace i said you know i see something too you do see yes i see tears in your future yes he was giving me the testimony i said i see tears in your future i prophesied right there at that moment and i believe my own words and sure enough i saw tears so so you know so that's brother abraham he said i'm an abraham or built kind of alike so you know i thought was it worth it so now if you see tears in my future oh that's used because we saw some sick people healed the most but that sickness in this body will always come back or it can come back right because we know that this body of flashes but to see the soul to see the soul of this young girl i said i would and then the lord i said lord senor i want a scripture lord for hiring to give me the strength and he gave me psalms 27. it says the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear see the lord is the strength of my life and of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies my foes came upon to eat up my flesh they stumbled and they fell here was and so yeah it was worth it i told the devil diablo i said you're gonna have to be one better than that because we're gonna finish the game and so i i right away i i you know i had some thoughts in my head and uh you know i have i'm i've been preaching now i think over about 32 years i think right i don't preach any other gospel i preached the message that was given to our apostles that he preached the message of our prophet william william and so i had thoughts that you know i could preach a two-hour message if you want me too but as i as i and i didn't expect to preach at all but right away on on the day that we were leaving i found out i was preaching the next day and so when i heard the theme but it's always like we're looking in the future and so everybody you know that everybody claims to believe the message they all claim to believe a prophet they all believe to have believed an apostle but you always find them like wandering wandering circles but and so it's like brother branham says that we're always looking to what god's done to what he's gonna do but what we fail to do is see what he's doing right now and so i was going to hit that the lord cometh and so where i went to this on the flea was behold the bridegroom cometh out to meet him and so god only has one place where he meets the worshiper god doesn't choose a lot of places to put his name if you don't come to my church you know god doesn't so it's always drawing himself back to himself so if somebody says well the holy ghost leads me saying the holy ghost is always going to lead you back to himself right so brother brown says that the holy ghost is not going to make somebody act one way and another person and so just to get to the end of it god has a meeting place and he has a law eating really and so today we got to find we got to realize that we're [Music] so there's a law that god has is tieni and i i i hit this i didn't know why i hit it but god has a law for everything and so we always tend to you know dive into the law of blessing and physical healing and medicine is physical right everybody wants god's blessings everybody wants to feel real good in their bodies they don't want to be right nobody wants them nobody wants to be sick or suffering and so we really go after those laws enthusiasm right and i'll pour out a blessing upon you that you can't contain this and everybody taps into that law christian or non-christian i used to work for a man in silver city a businessman he never went to church but he would pay his tithe and offerings to his church all i mean in in bundles is oh man you can get lost in the forest real fast because you'll i mean people will quote brother branham oh message of brother tommy right and they have a spiritual sickness in their heart and and so they try to fix that on their own man i wish i could give two examples because time would go real fast is brother gonna give a testimony no he's not not sunday or nothing no okay so he brought up this thing real quick two examples david david and samson right david david and samson they pretty much did the same kind of things [Music] right so they pretty much had like a heart a sickness in their hearts i just didn't want to steal a brother minus thunder that's why it's not when david found out he had something in his heart he ran straight to the prophet right he ran straight to the source where god had chosen to place his name he didn't have that opportunity to go so he did it in solitude by himself and he lost his life right so god has a place and that's that he has placed a ministry jesus and that's where that healing comes it comes in the place where god has put his name and that's where people don't want to go to the meeting place everybody wants to meet jesus man but they don't want to go to where jesus is at so and i say this for reasons like i said everything that we say and we hear a spirit behind them so being in the spiritual warfare it's called what what becomes the silent okay it's the silent okay right you see that at work you see a guy do something that's not the procedure for doing it right but you don't say nothing right so then it just becomes a silent okay okay but you know that it's wrong he knows it's wrong everybody knows when they do something wrong right so that person he he he's going to do something and then he like oh shoot that's not the reason to do it so then a little later it gets a little bigger thing and then before you know it the whole thing's all changed around but god wants to bring you back to his word regret which the bible says know ye not that you are the temple of the lord [Applause] basically what i'm going to talk about is what i saw happen in general it covers a lot in a few words by the grace of god like [Music] the word of the lord that came to joel hold on let me get it on my tablet the word of the lord that came into dwell have this been in your days or even in the days of your father's buenos dias plural tell your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children another generation what the palmer worm left the locust and that which the locusts have left half the cankle worm eaten and that which the cankerworm had left had the caterpillar eaten what i saw in these meetings is the totality of what this scripture declares well maybe some of you could answer and say right out of the gate yes if you're speaking about your natural fathers some of the families we have here have a privilege of a lineage in the message to me i was one born out of due season foreign religious background i was born i was raised in the baptist church but god called me out of there because they were bad people nope but because they only went so far with god so i can't answer that question like maybe some of you can contest but has this been in your days not as plural or the days of your fathers now now this scripture's compound which means it can mean two or more things so now if we apply this to the spiritual or spiritual has this been in your days i'm living in my day now just or has it been in the days of my father's day has it been in the days of juan francisco flaccio juan francisco my first who sent me to brother tommy amen amen i see all these different generations of people and how this message has been transferred from one to the other it comes me you know what i told the devil like thank you devil i needed a good cleaning out anyway yeah you said why would you get thanks to the devil well it's not that energy to fight against i wanted to be something be there something horrible i mean i wanted to be there so bad and everybody that went on the trip says well we know why because you were supposed to get the teaching in the morning before the regular services i i got to watch my pastor online as they give the teaching pastor but then i see this next part now that i've seen it was in the days of my father's and it's this testimony is incredible testimonials and you say yeah belgium because you're in it god god just gave me their privilege why did they sit there and ball like a little baby because just to know i have a little part in god's plan i couldn't handle that no no no i was just so thankful boy he's got a part of his testimony like like the brother said we got to hear the whole testimony of brother hatred let your children tell their children and their children then can tell another generation this message will never die now notice here's what as i take about another seven or eight minutes because i'm watching the clock what the palmer worm had left takes away the nine fruits of the spirit you can read in the bible it takes away the fruit of the tree and then that would with the locust stage [Music] many of you should know this one by heart the leaves on the tree represent okay let's say it together divine fellowship the wind of the holy ghost can blow in the presence and in the freshness of the holy spirit notice how he ate the fruit first the spirit of antichrist through the church ages then what the locusts ate canker worm eaten in english i know it doesn't translate the same in spanish it's a ugly name to begin with because what are we going to call this guy he goes why and he it's the lifeline that he's taking out yes the bark that's covered is the carbon is the religion just a a written thing on a piece of paper but it keeps the spirit of god in the words that use in la palabra to make that word produce what it says it'll produce is the nomination it's what breaks up the brotherhood it's separate from people now thousand denominations and they think the lord's coming for that a church like that you'll be it [Music] and that which the canker worm has left has the caterpillar eaten a caterpillar sucked it out and the organization take took it out una la sacca and the other one gets rid of it gets rid of it but what i saw on this trip in the generation of ronnie and jerry wrong is and he loves the lord yeah that's what i saw on this trip jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever end of the transformation that great prophet elijah to appear on the scene remember he had a compound the new message [Music] from the time of can you say that with me he will restore all the years brother danny how many years does that include just in 1965 no it includes from 1965 to the year of 2022. let me know foreign [Applause] amen amen how many enjoyed that let me enjoy god's
