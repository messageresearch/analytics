[35:15] really yeah okay amen I believe he does
[35:18] and we're just here to help God's
[35:20] children
[35:23] as you can see here
[35:28] it's a funny title isn't it
[35:34] rapturing question mark
[35:38] well are you doubting brother Jimmy
[35:40] we're gonna make the Rapture
[35:44] uh no nothing like that
[35:58] oh when the Rapture comes the Lord's
[36:01] Gonna Take Me by force this is
[36:08] but before that happens
[36:11] you have to take it by Foreign amen
[36:31] for by grace are ye saved through faith
[36:35] for Gracia soy salvos de la Fe
[36:39] and that not of yourselves
[36:43] it is a gift of God because
[36:47] that is
[36:51] thank you this fine evening Lord come
[36:55] before your children Lord
[37:00] and we have placed ourselves in your
[37:03] hands
[37:04] lordos you're in the audience and here
[37:07] in the Pulpit Lord
[37:09] we pray that you would close our mouths
[37:12] to anything that would not help your
[37:14] children Lord
[37:17] and that it would be your spirit
[37:19] quickening your word to each Heart Lord
[37:24] we ask all this in your precious Name
[37:27] Lord Jesus
[37:29] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[37:35] you're sitting and just go to our next
[37:37] scripture in Romans the seventh chapter
[37:43] and how many people
[37:46] uh I've read roman The Book of Romans
[37:53] you know
[37:54] all spend a lot of time in prison and
[37:58] [Music]
[38:00] some of the Epistles he wrote while he
[38:02] was in prisoners
[38:06] there's even times Mrs wrote with real
[38:09] big letters because he was just kind of
[38:11] maybe a candlelight uh I basis
[38:18] and he had problems with his eyes
[38:22] so here he is a physical prisoner
[38:25] physical
[38:29] in a physical prison
[38:31] um
[38:35] but how did he knows that God had chosen
[38:40] him
[38:41] to someday become the prisoner of Christ
[38:48] it shows you that you could be in a
[38:51] prison you could be in jail for whatever
[38:52] crime
[38:56] or you could be in jail and you're not
[38:59] even guilty of the crime but
[39:03] just because you're a prisoner inside of
[39:06] a jail something
[39:10] doesn't mean that you're gonna live
[39:13] right when you get out of jail no
[39:14] significance
[39:17] but when you become a prisoner to Christ
[39:22] you know what causes you to be a
[39:25] prisoner to Christ
[39:28] the chain
[39:49] for we know that the law is spiritual
[39:53] but I am carnal sold under sin is
[40:02] for that which I do I allow not
[40:06] or what I would that do I not
[40:10] but what I hate
[40:13] that I do foreign
[40:23] ah come on you've never how many have
[40:27] ever felt like you wanted to do
[40:29] something good
[40:32] that's according to the word
[40:36] and it just escapes you on how to do it
[40:38] is implemented that's all he's saying is
[40:44] so he could be in the physical prison
[40:46] here
[40:48] but he's had an experience with God
[40:51] experience
[40:57] and now he's in the process
[41:01] of becoming a prisoner to
[41:06] Christo even though he's in jail
[41:10] that's what Romans 7 is all about
[41:17] continuity but then I do that which I
[41:19] would not I consent unto the law
[41:22] that it is good is Buena
[41:28] and the next verse
[41:30] now then it is not
[41:32] no more me that do it but the sin that
[41:36] dwelleth in me
[41:40] and I want you to notice he says this
[41:43] sin this which is what is
[41:50] he said it dwelt in him
[41:53] well the question would be what part of
[41:55] him
[41:57] was still a sinner
[42:00] he had a new birth
[42:04] yeah oh yeah he was born again
[42:08] but in his makeup like you and me
[42:13] he has the white dog and the black dog
[42:16] he has this hybrid flesh
[42:20] he had a spirit
[42:22] that is permitted by God yes
[42:28] that's not perfect you know it's perfect
[42:31] that needs to be transformed
[42:33] and he's saying
[42:35] there's sin that still dwells in me
[42:39] he was trying to to me to figure out his
[42:43] own makeup
[42:50] he did he knew God had called him
[42:55] do you know that God has called you how
[42:57] many numbers
[43:00] how many of you have been born again
[43:03] young people born again
[43:06] but how many of you feel this way
[43:10] exactly the way exactly
[43:14] in a prison
[43:16] becoming a prisoner
[43:19] remember one time I preached in Camp
[43:21] Thunderbird many many years ago
[43:25] the Paradox of the prisoner and the
[43:29] soldier
[43:32] you know how the soldier will take the
[43:35] prisoners to prisoners
[43:40] but you know when God pero and yours
[43:43] there has to be something that takes his
[43:45] prisoner
[43:48] it's it's it's the prisoner now
[43:52] taking the soldier
[43:56] to the Battlefront
[43:59] I mean it's no longer the soldier taking
[44:01] the prisoner to jail
[44:05] now it's the prisoner taking the soldier
[44:09] and making him a love slave to Jesus
[44:12] Christ
[44:17] I'm a soldier and the prisoners
[44:22] for I know that in me you're saying me
[44:25] now he's beginning to understand
[44:28] there now you can begin to understand as
[44:31] you walk with God
[44:33] now I know that in me
[44:36] that is in my flesho is
[44:40] in
[44:47] Uganda I really enjoyed that that was
[44:49] good stuff
[44:54] yes because it's it's an expression that
[44:57] is survived from a previous time
[45:03] all the way to the present time
[45:07] it's something that lest there's a
[45:10] change
[45:12] it will always be the same way
[45:17] that is in my flesh
[45:21] continues to dwell no good thing
[45:26] no good thing we'll ever dwell
[45:32] notice the word dwell
[45:34] [Music]
[45:34] um
[45:44] sometimes you wish the devil would do
[45:46] that right
[45:49] get away okay
[46:06] I'm going to attack him some other way
[46:08] there's never no good thing that will
[46:11] ever dwell in this hybrid bless
[46:19] Jimmy already said that
[46:22] do we really have a reality of that Yeah
[46:26] because sometimes we think we're
[46:29] hanging
[46:33] better believe it that's me yeah so yeah
[46:35] yeah
[46:38] oh you never think that you never think
[46:40] that you're something else
[46:44] until you become a prisoner of Christ
[46:48] it's a little silly but where we're
[46:51] going yeah
[46:52] is something that's so special
[46:56] that God wants to show you tonight
[47:04] for to will is present
[47:08] how many have the will right now then
[47:11] you wanna serve them
[47:14] you want to fulfill your purpose in this
[47:17] life you
[47:20] want to do exactly what God called you
[47:23] to do
[47:25] and you have a will to do it
[47:29] for to will is is present with me
[47:34] but how to perform that which is good I
[47:39] find not for como hacer
[47:42] how many have ever felt that way
[47:45] raise your hands
[47:47] Manos
[47:49] young people
[47:51] a witness are you paralyzed okay
[47:58] it's not a formal dead church
[48:01] I'm sorry I'm not trying to suppose
[48:08] okay praise the Lord I'm forgiven let's
[48:11] go on Amen
[48:13] and now I would like to go to a quote
[48:16] out of adoption part two parties
[48:21] amen you can put that up there for me
[48:25] for me
[48:28] R2 paragraph 51 and 52.
[48:32] so that you can see how special you are
[48:35] on a god
[48:39] you're not just anybody persona
[48:43] you are a son and daughter
[48:48] now brother William starts off what do
[48:51] you think
[48:53] the writer of this book that's in it
[48:58] be manifested in the last days
[49:03] waiting and groaning for those sons of
[49:07] God
[49:10] to rise on the scene in the last days
[49:17] do you think the rising of those sons of
[49:20] God is
[49:26] so strong
[49:28] it would pull up more sons of God
[49:34] the rising impact
[49:38] of the sons of God
[49:40] now when it says those sons of God
[49:45] is not referring to all the sons of God
[49:50] it's referred me to a special classes
[49:54] special in a special time
[49:58] for a special purpose
[50:03] wow yeah
[50:06] amen praise God
[50:12] but those sons of God to rise on the
[50:14] scene in the last days
[50:18] with the power of the Holy Ghost
[50:24] oh now we know what sons of God is
[50:27] talking about
[50:29] and I don't believe it's talking about
[50:31] the end of laodice
[50:34] I think it's talking about the end of
[50:36] the Friday
[50:39] because when the brightens
[50:48] question mark
[51:02] he starts using that expression in 1953.
[51:08] and you'll see it all the way through
[51:10] the message
[51:13] then he uses the expression starting in
[51:16] 1955
[51:21] Grace
[51:22] gracias wow there's even rapturing Grace
[51:28] and then one time Universe in 1962
[51:33] this is the expression
[51:36] rapturing strings
[51:40] what
[51:43] oh
[51:44] is it going to be rap stream Faith by
[51:46] itself that takes us out of here
[51:50] and everybody thinks Rapture Rapture
[51:52] yeah
[52:12] by grace for Gracia amen
[52:19] rapturing strength that's the one that
[52:21] really gets my attention
[52:24] because he only uses it one time in the
[52:27] homework
[52:29] it's on my famous list of things that
[52:32] brother Branham only said one time
[52:38] it was just way over a hundred times
[52:41] tremendous things one time
[52:44] is that the holy spirit is waiting for
[52:47] two or three Witnesses
[52:57] now in your experience hence to
[52:59] experiencia have you experience Rapture
[53:01] in faith yes
[53:05] rapturing Grace gracias if you ever come
[53:09] to service and felt like you know
[53:12] I'm going to service might as well go
[53:15] one last time
[53:20] I'm a donkey and I cannot change
[53:25] I'm a donkey and I just can't change
[53:34] our human complexes

[58:19] times
[58:21] we can barely hear it
[58:24] because it's buried under so much stuff
[58:30] it even lost its original positions
[58:41] his soul is in the background now
[58:46] then there's his Spirit of natural human
[58:49] sinful spirit
[58:53] and then a sinful body
[58:57] and the human race
[59:00] that's such a hard time listening and
[59:03] hearing the voice of the souls
[59:09] God wants to bring your soul in a
[59:12] Rapture
[59:14] who is the original position I suppose
[59:17] it's your
[59:21] the way it was before the fall
[59:28] you know let's get into that
[59:31] let's go to the message
[59:33] the greatest battle ever fought
[59:39] okay
[59:43] can we go to the next part Brothers can
[59:46] you skip it or do it here
[59:50] paragraph 104.
[59:52] what was the matter
[59:55] problema you had to open the Channel
[59:57] first
[1:00:00] and if you read how many have read this
[1:00:02] message
[1:00:03] he's talking about the five senses of
[1:00:06] the body
[1:00:07] the five the five in inlets to the
[1:00:11] spirit
[1:00:12] and and then the Soul and the nature of
[1:00:15] the song
[1:00:18] but he says you've got to get this
[1:00:20] channel open first neces
[1:00:23] not channels no Canales there's a
[1:00:27] channel that connects to those channels
[1:00:31] and if that one is not correctly prayed
[1:00:35] Place
[1:00:37] freedom to access your senses
[1:00:43] to access your memories your affection
[1:00:46] your emotions
[1:00:49] it can do nothing for you
[1:00:52] what's this
[1:00:55] you've got to get the soldier soldado
[1:01:01] not a soldier
[1:01:03] you've got to get the soldiers
[1:01:07] the Holy Spirit
[1:01:10] visiting the Battlefront visitando El
[1:01:13] frente bataya places
[1:01:27] instead of finding this weak worldly
[1:01:29] experience
[1:01:32] he finds the nature of that Spirit
[1:01:40] yes
[1:02:03] I don't live in here anymore
[1:02:12] send your garbage and your lies to send
[1:02:16] somebody else
[1:02:20] he doesn't even have a chance to get in
[1:02:22] is
[1:02:26] not foreign
[1:02:31] [Music]
[1:02:47] is
[1:02:57] every one of the other channels
[1:03:03] just like an old
[1:03:06] boilera with the flu stops
[1:03:11] [Applause]
[1:03:12] and you'll blow the thing up
[1:03:19] now let's go on that same message
[1:03:23] to paragraph 71
[1:03:27] you guys got there it is
[1:03:30] so what does that mean to place the
[1:03:32] soldier at the
[1:03:34] Battlegrounds
[1:03:36] because he's not a good visitor
[1:03:39] as a matter of fact he he won't go there
[1:03:42] if he can't stay
[1:03:46] it doesn't have the characteristic of
[1:03:48] being a visitor characteristics
[1:03:51] it happens to be
[1:03:54] the one that wants to to live there
[1:03:59] how many of you want the Holy Spirit
[1:04:10] now Paul he was going through this
[1:04:14] because he had yet become a prisoner to
[1:04:16] Christ
[1:04:18] even though he had been a prisoner
[1:04:22] and as he was inspired by the Holy
[1:04:25] Spirit foreign
[1:04:43] I like watching you guys are awesome
[1:04:47] spectacular like looking at you right in
[1:04:49] the eyes
[1:05:00] it sounds worse in Spanish you're you're
[1:05:02] a nose you're nosy
[1:05:04] you're a busybody in other people's
[1:05:06] business
[1:05:09] don't put that one on me no no no no not
[1:05:12] that no amen
[1:05:14] senor
[1:05:17] yeah this is what I want
[1:05:24] okay paragraph 71 is this out of the
[1:05:27] message
[1:05:28] the greatest battle ever fought
[1:05:37] either that or I got the paragraph wrong
[1:05:43] see if I can
[1:05:51] be a little patient with me
[1:05:54] I'm losing time you got it okay
[1:05:58] paragraph 71 the greatest battle ever
[1:06:00] fought
[1:06:02] now I had if you was looking on my Note
[1:06:06] here
[1:06:08] I had a little map draw it out
[1:06:11] I had there not long ago and
[1:06:14] use it on the board
[1:06:17] the human being is made up just like a
[1:06:21] grain of wheat
[1:06:22] Estates
[1:06:27] question for you is a grain of wheat an
[1:06:30] original product of God yes
[1:06:37] so he's talking about the original order
[1:06:42] or makeup of this
[1:06:47] and now it's going to compare it to you
[1:06:50] and me
[1:06:51] just show us something is really nice
[1:06:54] but uh
[1:06:58] okay let's go down here
[1:07:01] the human being
[1:07:04] to stay right there the human being is
[1:07:06] made up just like a grain of wheat
[1:07:08] instead
[1:07:13] the physically you're the the seed of
[1:07:16] your father and mother music
[1:07:19] and the life comes from the Father
[1:07:23] the pope come from the mother
[1:07:26] and so the two together the egg and the
[1:07:29] blood comes
[1:07:33] together
[1:07:40] and in the blood cell is life is
[1:07:45] begins to develop making the child
[1:07:49] Now watch how he touches
[1:07:52] now any seed has a shell on the Outside
[1:07:59] Inside is the pope yeah inside of the
[1:08:03] pope is the germ of life
[1:08:06] well that's the way we're made
[1:08:14] and spirit yes that is the original
[1:08:18] makeup
[1:08:20] oh wait God made man
[1:08:23] it was not bad
[1:08:28] it became buddy
[1:08:36] I already formed it in the original
[1:08:39] series
[1:08:51] now you know why he didn't attack Adam
[1:08:57] he had to to take a part of the of man
[1:09:03] physically that was a byproducts
[1:09:08] but the woman was a part of his Spirit
[1:09:13] a part of Adam's spirit
[1:09:16] that was a part of God's life
[1:09:20] that wasn't a byproducted that was the
[1:09:24] daughter of God
[1:09:27] but it was the plan of God
[1:09:30] for him to trap
[1:09:33] satanas and obese
[1:09:37] called the surface
[1:09:39] so he could bring into judgment
[1:09:42] he wanted his attributes to be okay
[1:09:47] salvation to be a savior Healers
[1:09:57] or how could it if there was nobody sick
[1:10:02] how could there's nobody that was a
[1:10:05] sinner
[1:10:07] how could he deliver somebody that was
[1:10:09] never bound
[1:10:12] he had to permit this
[1:10:15] in order for his attributes to come out
[1:10:20] amen amen
[1:10:22] now I want to leave that quote there
[1:10:25] well let's finish this this part the
[1:10:27] outside the body is
[1:10:33] the conscience and so forth
[1:10:37] and the inside of the soul is
[1:10:41] a spirit
[1:10:43] and the spirit governs all others
[1:10:48] amen amen
[1:10:51] now let's go to the message and know if
[1:10:53] it's not
[1:10:56] how many have read the message
[1:11:01] amen
[1:11:19] okay
[1:11:21] this bit on our tablet
[1:11:27] that's the right one
[1:11:29] yes okay very well
[1:11:31] yeah now this outside man is the flesh
[1:11:36] that's what we look at
[1:11:39] what we see
[1:11:41] it has five energy to the body
[1:11:45] and any grammar school child as myself
[1:11:48] would know there is five senses that
[1:11:50] control the body
[1:11:51] is
[1:12:02] that's the only way you have to the body
[1:12:06] is see taste feel smell here is
[1:12:16] she tastes you now that is the evil one
[1:12:22] on the outside and El exterior
[1:12:27] now on the inside is the
[1:12:31] spiritual also National Body and Soul
[1:12:33] anymore
[1:12:35] oh brother doesn't change his mind
[1:12:40] made a mistake
[1:12:42] yeah right
[1:12:47] God Don't Make Mistakes
[1:12:49] instead of that is the spirit
[1:12:52] instead of a world in nature
[1:12:56] because it was not given from God
[1:13:00] but it was given permitted by God
[1:13:05] now you got that
[1:13:07] but every child that's born in the world
[1:13:16] and come into the world speaking life
[1:13:19] that person is
[1:13:24] the center to begin with
[1:13:27] and can we go to paragraph 127.
[1:13:32] amen
[1:13:35] now people can live in this
[1:13:39] now if I had the White Water I would put
[1:13:41] these two sets of circles
[1:13:51] and you know what Spirit places inside
[1:13:53] that one the original one is
[1:14:06] Marriott
[1:14:14] you can dance in the spirit they can
[1:14:16] shout in the spirit when retirement
[1:14:21] this can absolutely have the real spirit
[1:14:23] of God anointing on that
[1:14:27] Spirits foreign
[1:14:42] Espirito
[1:14:46] so that's not the spirit
[1:14:49] that's on the inside of the wheat is
[1:14:55] because
[1:15:01] Alma Spirit yes
[1:15:05] go to Psalms 51. you guys jump on the I
[1:15:09] know let me see what order I had it in
[1:15:11] here we go
[1:15:15] and how many have read this scripture
[1:15:17] over and over
[1:15:20] it's wonderful isn't it
[1:15:23] he ate in me a clean heart
[1:15:28] you know what clean heart there is in
[1:15:31] the Hebrew significance
[1:15:33] it says
[1:15:42] he has to put it back together right
[1:15:44] foreign
[1:16:58] when he was bringing you foreign
[1:17:59] they sell
[1:18:03] it would only need contacts
[1:18:06] with the original Creator
[1:18:09] original and then that spirit that was
[1:18:13] worldly
[1:18:14] let's go back to the description
[1:18:29] a clean heart
[1:18:31] oh God
[1:18:33] who
[1:18:50] is
[1:18:51] hate that spirit that was filthy

[1:19:19] Spirits
[1:19:22] no you don't know oh this is good it's
[1:19:26] just it's not what this is what Paul was
[1:19:27] finding out about himself
[1:19:30] and when you feel the way Paul feels
[1:19:35] I know what's right
[1:19:37] I know he should do this
[1:19:39] I know I've been taught correctly you
[1:19:42] say is
[1:19:43] and I read the scripture
[1:19:46] I just haven't been able to do this

[1:21:24] Spanish when you visit in Spanish it's
[1:21:27] you can see why people misunderstand
[1:21:29] nothing against the Spanish

[1:21:35] English
[1:21:36] and it doesn't say what it says in the
[1:21:39] original Greek original
