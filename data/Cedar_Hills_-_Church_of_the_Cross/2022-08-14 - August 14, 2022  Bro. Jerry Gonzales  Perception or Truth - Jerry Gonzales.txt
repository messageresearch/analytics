just to keep our pastor in the and tommy junior and uh i don't know who else is with him just keep him in your prayers as they travel back okay much longer starting with verse two principiando con verso dios and moses called unto all israel and said unto them you have been all that the lord did before you and said unto them ye have seen all that the lord did before your eyes in the land of egypt unto pharaoh and unto all servants and unto all his land israel the great temptations which thine eyes have seen the signs and those great miracles but watch verse 4 yet the lord hath not given you one heart to perceive and eyes to see and ears to hear unto this day and it reads i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy accessible to god which is your reasonable service yes sacrificial and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove remember that word prove what is that is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god transform us blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated again it's good to be in the house of the lord with you to be able to worship and to sing with you to be able to partake of his precious word participate but uh i wanted to bring a little thought this morning and it goes along with an experience that i've had that i've we'll we'll find out what it is yes but so our pastor preached on on a very tremendous subject last week and then so i just started a new job okay it's with a new company it's a new position [Music] and and and this i deal with a lot more people but one of the things i noticed in dealing with a lot more people ian and uh is the different views that different people have no telos diferentes preceptions i noticed that everybody thinks just even just a little bit different different every single person no matter if who they are no important persona they view things a little bit differently so i'm used to working with people that kind of have similar views than i do but in this in this new environment there's there's extreme views on both sides vistas the extremes and this can be any little point but it seems like they're able to prove their points they have a certain perspective of a subject and everybody has facts to back it up truth and i'm kind of like it kind of leaves me a little bit stunned but then i began to give them my facts i began to give them my truth verdad my perception my interpretation of whatever subject me the interpretation and it just seems like we go round and round it's back and forth whether something even a simple like brother william preached one time if you're a sports fan kobe bryant or michael jordan again like i said it's from one spectrum to the other from something so insignificant to something more important even things in in the in the job duties someone always has a better way of doing so it brought me to a thought that i've had entonces that everyone's perception it's a it's a thought that's out there yes everyone's perception is the reality everyone has certain beliefs and everyone sticks to their gun man we ran into that before and that's the question okay the reality is that facts they don't care about perception only important the bottom line is that facts are facts and even though everybody has a certain perception of facts facts are still facts los echos son no matter what what side of the spectrum we're on no important for how we're sitting so that's the things how do you change that and tosses you know that's the thing and i'm going to say this respectfully i don't understand how no entiendo como they want to push the tape ministry different countries differentes are obviously have have had different stimulus in their life estimulos and suvida so everybody's going to think differently everybody's going to formulate an idea an idea for example you're hearing me this morning for example right now your perception of me or me it's going to be different if i ask the sister here different thinking maybe maybe some are thinking yeah i know he's speaking the truth maybe other others are saying not so much so everybody's background plays a part in each individual person that hears a message reads the bible is going to get something different different because we're going to read a scripture and we're going to disagree on it and remember everybody loves to push their agenda everybody is always right more than a brother or yo especially in today's society especially today society is very educated and if they're not educated they have google i eat a youtube i can fix computers i can learn how to public speak you can you can figure out just about anything you can you can it'll help you with your homework levi are you hard to get something across to them [Applause] and the problem is an idea how things should be problematic each individual has his own perception of reality so it's mental impressions of something so let's define the word perception even though we know what it means we're on sunday school right so i know even uh bologna sandwiches are good even when you're hungry right [Music] so just bear with me for a little bit okay i promise we'll get into some good stuff here in a bit it's not what i say knows which means it's flawed from the beginning did you see something from by your eyes see if this alcocos your eyes will deceive you you hear something with your ears it will deceive you right it's a flawed system already incorrect because there's five senses but we have to be driven by that success which is faith which is revelation revolution revelation that it we're going to make it we're going to make it together but not just because you're together in a group but of one mind that's why it's important important to have a pastor the pastor is the head of the church that won't allow all these different perceptions because you'll bring the doctrine to the church this man subjects himself to the holy spirit and then and then the the female part of the wife part subject yourself to the holy spirit also and to the head [Music] and the definition of perception is the ability to see es or become aware of something or they start attento de algo through senses the state of being or process of becoming aware of the other definition of it okay here's some other ones a result of perceiving observation nobody check how you are are you guided by these senses if we are guided by the five senses we have a perception of the world so but if we're guided by the sixth sense by something else there's that the control tower control the holy spirit inside of you el espirito santos moving showing you how to be telling us how we should be the rights of the people or the people's perceptions the people's views vistas that's why they come out with all these things i hear a lot of these different views vistas different but one of the most outrageous views they will not define what a woman is the craziest thing is what is they will not put gender pronouns on somebody else so one of the big things right now is luna las cosas [Music] they or them entonces i'm like that's that's strange to me it's not even good grammar grammatical a singular person una persona singular following me okay before he said unto him come out of the man that one clean spirit actually um that was late i'm sorry i didn't i didn't give you this yeah hey that this is 9. and and i'll read 9. and he asked him what is thy name and he and he answered saying my name is legion for we are many. you see how the singular person vest is singular you see that spirit today he referred to himself in a plural sentence and i'll read this just because you're going to need this later and then verse 10 and he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country yes unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding established and all the devils we sought him saying send us into the swine that we may enter into them la sistema it's the spirit sl that's that's what we're after yes never after a person people are precious everybody has the right to hear the word went off the cliff and went into the water you know if you know your symbols in the bible you see symbols one of the symbols of water means people under the symbols so remember scripture has compound meaning it's not a history book no esun when you read the scriptures number one you better see jesus in every single daughter title number so the just the craziest thing i mean just the ideas so a woman now is not a woman so now it's a child bearing person a he's a jewish person yes yes and he's a sharp guy yes he means more to the conservative side conservatives but i'd like to hear him speak he says why are they taking the superpower away from the woman about that so i started to think now in this in a spiritual sense so what happens now when they try to do that in the church to be able to bring and assist the new birth well they try to do that the natural types of spiritual natural typical spiritual many times things that happen in the natural muchas versus la cosas a man me see where i'm at here oh where am i at half an hour okay all right a little bit of time all right so young people like i said i know we're in a mixed audience but there's certain things this is what we always tell you but you don't want to do certain things you don't want to go out into the world and find that's not supposed to almost what happened he marks the cell in your memory he burns a file in your mind so now say years later i owned another quest okay now i'm going to go to church and i'm going to serve god i'm going to get married i'm going to do this but all of a sudden you're at the store and a song comes out you started i and keep you from obtaining that birth that you need that's how he holds you back you'll say it's okay to go to church but remember what you did remember the duck it was the tree of knowledge of good and evil that was good you brought a certain understanding a little bit so how do we how do we get rid of this [Music] watch this the right mental attitude towards god when i look at brother abraham maybe i have a certain perspective of him but if i look at her now through the lens of the word that's not brother abraham that's the son i'm not speaking to nobody remember that's the goal the goal is to save the people to help the people what does our pastor always say to just show that he knows this or that hermanos don't let those emotional drivers mold you into something else because i'll get to my point here because i i don't want to run out of time just a little text if i could call it that um i want to speak for a moment of uh of two a moment or two on the word expectation we always get what we expect expectiva we always get what we expect maybe there's a bit of a hatred there for someone you don't even know why you're going to you expect that that's what you're going to get i expect that that's what i'm going to get is get what you look for entonces the mental attitude that you have remember this all right it's uh sorry brothers i forgot to tell you it's the quote and expectation so they can follow along you say when it says remember remember this and never forget it the right mental attitude towards any promise of god how does attitude effect watch this simply a perception attitude which by expectation expectation triggers certain reactions information received by a person information received a person any of the human senses stimulates sensations sensation which he or she interprets to generate an understanding it all depends on what we see today it all depends on what we want to see attitude towards the person now we say we're going to spend eternity eternity together can we say that with a straight face recta well it's hard brother he or she did this to me through the five senses and remember that system is from the beginning the principle is torsido watch this article and i'll read it really fast young people i want you to hear this okay this is just a person and i found it interesting is interesting not paraphrasing here so i don't know if this is true for everyone for me when i'm having a bad day sometimes i focus on on on everything that's bad muchas versus [Music] and when this happens he says it's a terrible thing i could be having a great day watch your and certain situations in my outlook chronic headaches insomnia insomnia anxiety you know that anxiety is a killer anxiety anxiety is affects many people today and last night like i said you talk about maybe this is why yeah i had an issue last night and i felt anxiety i'm not an anxious person i think a lot yo but i try not to let the anxiety the you know the tapping you ever seen you see people clinching their jaws moving anxious i'm worried about someone oh my god this is going to happen even things we have no control no need to one you ever come and you tell a young person something on the outside so the pastor gave us the formula formula he says so this person goes on in the article the first step in changing your perception imagining who you want to be el prime if i had the power to flip my life into chaos is and what the depression young yeah i see but he let me feel that for a reason not with not on our watch the message of the uh called illusory truth effect an illusory truth effect is that what that does or what that is is it's a it's a tactic it's used by marketers today and what it is is he constantly bombards you with information information maybe it's even false but what illusory truth effect does is i have the tendency to side with it now he actually gave pastor gave the formula take the recipe we just have to apply it for me to hear it but i have to apply said if you have that thought just because it was for you so it's the two extremes in the country that brings excuse me i'll get to my last part here so what is it to remain if we remain with our own perception yes this is an example of scriptures they're not stories they're here for our benefits watch this thought it's just an angle okay there was a there was an abomination done in the times of daniels in 168 bc he marched into the jewish temple he erected a statue of zeus watch the abomination just means something disgusting historians say that's that was the fulfillment of daniel 9 27. it is my goodness so i i think of that and i'm like wow what a what a story huh as the fulfillment of daniel says and he and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and for the overspreading of abomination he shall make it desolate even until the confirmation and that determines shall be poured upon the desolate yes so i started to think oh my my goodness fiancee he sacrificed the pig in god's altar sacrifice in the temple of god brought me to something and it says first corinthians 3 16 primer de corinthios 3 16 and it reads know ye not the ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you if any man defile the temple of god him shall god destroy for the temple of god is holy which temple is follow me here okay we are the temple of god so it is imperative to be born again why serve the lord cerebral preach the gospel go out and do the same thing again or whatever whatever issue again and then go back out and do the same thing what does brother brandon say about a pig faith without works is dead can you imagine taking a hug from its wallow this is the word hog you could take a hog out here and bring this hog in it scrub it with salt soda whatever you wanted to do do that painting of her toenails like women do on their fingers and mix up with he makes carlos with with clothes put it on a hardwood floor give it grape nuts and that hog would die yes [Music] could go i'm not calling whatever nature calls [Music] the nature that's inside of us what are we doing we're bringing a sacrifice do you think he has you young people sitting up in the front for nothing preparations are being made without their new birth changing of a nation we're otherwise that will bring us to what's called the cup of iniquity yes filling up that cup with inequity what is inequity yes to know that something's wrong and continue doing it sometimes we feel like it's those giants right watch this and i'll finish with this the amorites because he says the cup of the gentiles the amorites were known los amores and if the musicians want to come up um they were known as the lord of the mountains they were known for being in the mountains they were known for those it's a giant to somebody that's dealing with it depression is a giant depression maybe a person has a certain issue with something that's a giant in their life el camino does it do what keeps us from climbing of a statue of a perfect man we can finish up here watch brother branham or not hermano branham god talk to moses little by little just as you kill out this bunch i'll go ahead and put it up so they can read along with me please god talk to moses little by little just as you kill off this bunch of americans i'll let you move in and take over permit if you kill out this bunch of heavies i'll let you move in take over that's just all the farther you spread out brother well if you'll spread farther es you'll move your arm the souls of your foot trot i'll give it to you it was victory brother victoria and i'll tell you today i think we'll steal it off with one more quote israel in the church israel iglesia got to here i have to hit this one and the 10 went 10 out of the 12 said yes oh they are fearful people oh i see perception through senses right there goes ahead and tells they said moreover caleb still the people before moses and what does our caleb say what does he always tell us let us go up at once is the people for they are stronger than women and they brought us up an evil report of the land which they searched out the children of israel saying the land which we gave with god is a land eateth up inhabitants caleb and joshua said we can take it i don't know if that does anything for you to do it god promised god had promised them to do it he says i like that courage truth what is what is truth i'll end with this terminology the definition of truth the body of real things and facts actuality [Applause] amen let's all stand to our feet this morning how
