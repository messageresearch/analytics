TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and tonight the church age is called the philadelphian church age and the star are the the messenger angel messenger to that church age we believe solemnly with all of our heart to be john wesley the church h began at 1750 when the lutheran church age went out and lasted up to somewhere in 1900 around 1906 the westland church age now the age is the age of church age of brotherly love the great missionary age and the open door age and the reward was a pillar made a pillar and the revelation of three names the name of god the name of city of god god's new name is a revelation that was given to this church john wesley was the star of the age and um he was born on june the 17th 1703 an epworth rectory england father a preacher mother a consecrated saint although with 19 children to take care of she found much time during a busy day to teach her children bible lessons and bible stories and pray for them that's what made the boys what they were the great songwriter charles his brother who gave the world some of the most inspiring songs we've ever had john rose up early every morning or sixty years he got up every morning at four o'clock that's one thing that church has fallen from got up every morning at four o'clock and preached at five am for fifty years straight and sometimes he preached from two to four times a day it is said by people of england that he rode a horse 4500 english smiles every year to preach the gospel i know thy works behold i have set before then open door and no man can shut it for al has a little strength and has kept my word and is not denying my name now i watch the time coming now as the great missionary move that swept across the nations of brotherly love to take what they had nothing against it of literature whatever more into the different parts of the world now the church denomination had gone back to uh education works again the gone back after the great denomination had been set up jesus set an open door after the wesleyan age had come in and the methodist church had been established in the earth taken roots growing making a great church which it is today one of the greatest of among the protestant churches and that time the thing that took place then was jesus set an open door for the church before they entered into the lady of cnh oh here's what you have to watch now it's just in between the philadelphia and the lady ocean age lap over jesus is the door now if you'll turn with me to john 10 17 then said jesus unto them verily verily i say unto you i am the door of the sheeple let's back into the blessings how do we get into christ what is he the sheepfold now remember we're not talking against anybody that good people is a scatter god sheep is in all that places out there that is true that's right methodists baptists whatever they are they're god's people if they are born again of the spirit of god after that begin to come along the first thing you know they organized the old general council which one in now called the families of god amen see all that church that was left over i know that works behold i set before thee an open door and no man can shut it uh has a little strength and has not denied my name no man can be saved only through jesus christ not through any church in the organization any bishop pope just through jesus christ he has the key he's the only one the keys of what david the future coming millennium where he'll sit on the throne of david i have the keys of david i'll open this door and nobody can shut it nobody can open it with me and nobody can shut it to me for thou has a little strength you got just a little strength now what does that mean just like a man has been dead kind of shaking himself reviving up a little oh don't you see brother and what you've done he went right straight back to the thing that god hated break up brotherhood look at the assemblies of god some of the finest people in worlds in them assemblies of god look at that united pentecostal church just as fine as you ever met in your life look at the church of god and because of those organizations they fuss and squeal and fuss with one another co-owner of buzzers and rat then why it's a disgrace one thing god hates is sowing discard among brethren now trying sometimes organizations is what does it sows discord among brothers we should be standing there preaching saying we are brothers and no man shoved it or thou has a little strength and has kept my word all right and has not denied my name behold i will make them of the synagogue of satan which say they are jews which say they are spirit-filled christians say the synagogue the organization i'll make them it says they got the holy ghost organized organized up there they haven't got the revelation yet all right i'll say them and say they are jews are christians and are not but do lie behold i will make them come and worship before thy feet and to know that i have loved thee now we're going to watch out we're coming over into something that's very dangerous all of them live a good clean life sanctified and think it's got the holy ghost and your fellow speak in tongues you're something you'll laugh at and make fun of himself of the brother you sealed your doom when you did that you blasphemed the holy ghost which is unpardonable because thou has kept the word of my patience i also will keep thee that little remnant from the hour of temptation when the church is going to come to a place where you're going to have to get this organization or be you're going to you're going to have it brother that's all you're either going to be organized or take the mark of the beast that shall come upon the whole world to try them that dwell upon the earth behold i come quickly and hold fast to that which thou hast that no man take away thy crown a crown means that you have uh have a domain you are a king if you're crowned and we are sons of god when we're crowned with eternal life and our domain is the earth make you priests and kings unto god is that right so there you are he that overcometh well i make a pillar in the temple of my god pillar or pillar or foundation foundation in the temple of the house or the house of god the temple of my god or the house of my god it's a pillar the foundation everything went in the door jesus and he that overcometh well i make him a pillar in other words part of the foundation what will i give you i'll put it in the doctrine of the apostles and prophets and giving the revelation amen make him a healer make him a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out a pillar in the temple of my god and i will write up on him the name of my god [Music] now what's the name of god jesus if you don't jot this down we're getting a little late jesus ephesians 3 15 says uh in heaven and earth all's name jesus you see all right all right now all right and the name of the city of my god which is the new jerusalem which comes down out of heaven from my god i'll put on him if you see it's all the same name as you already called it i put on him the name of the city of my god the city he goes ahead and say which is the new jerusalem [Music] the new jerusalem i put on the new jerusalem now the bride or the church is the new jerusalem how many know is that amen the church itself is the new jerusalem which is all the same jesus
