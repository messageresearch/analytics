worthy to be praised and adored you know before i get going this morning i'd like to give a little testimony testimonial yeah yeah i'm gonna wrap for a testimonial testimonial testimony amen i was going out the other day there to where the brothers were elk hunting i got on the freeway going north on interstate 10. interstate 25 going north and uh i had i had passed i was probably uh probably not quite to fort selden but right in there it might have been a little bit after fort zelda i'm sorry for seldom and uh and this car is coming of course i'm going north and this car of course the traffic's coming south i look and see if my my brights are on hello lights so i'm thinking maybe the road you know how the road goes bouncy sometimes and the lights kind of go up and down and maybe that's what i'm seeing little farther up or something okay and about the time that i that i was watching the semi trailer to look of course forward there's a car coming the opposite way head on to me that they were they were trying to warn me and i see this car coming head-on all i can do is pull over as fat and i have that trailer and i pull over as fast as i can okay because i pulled over the car goes right past me looked in the rearview mirror i said lord just take care of whoever's back there but i think the lord is always watching us i don't know you never know but that's why we should always pray before we go anywhere i was right before that happened that's what i was doing i was as i was driving i was praying i thank the lord for his protection god bless those that are on hookup there's god bless each one of you that has made the effort to come this morning would you stand as you can see here with the parallel number 22. i'm about to rival the the series of of uh the continuity of the word i think i i preached 29 messages on the parallel we can preach that to the coming of the lord because everything in the old testament is parallel in the new testament everything that we see in the natural of israel parallels us today we'll go as far as long as the lord tells us to and then we'll go we'll follow his lead wherever he he wants to to take us amen i was telling the brothers the last few times i preached don't ask me why i'm so dry. parallel number 22 their clothes and shoes never wore out this is a blessing to you i had a i had i don't know how many messages that i had going and i was following this line and then i had another one and i went over here over here and finally this morning he he brought it all together and and he told me to go this way we want to be we want to be uh obedient to what the holy spirit tells us got to see our founding pastor yesterday he was he was very happy yesterday to see see me and of course i him i put on a tape of a message of brother branham for a little while to the whole thing just enjoying the word of god you know this and it was so good to to be there with him and i said well everybody misses you pops of course there's a greetings to every one of you god bless you this morning turn in our scripture deuteronomy the eighth chapter and the fourth verse and i'm gonna have to get a i'm gonna have to get my eyes checked this and get bifocals but then i can't see you very well what happens when you when you get a few years under your belt amen deuteronomy the eighth chapter and the third and the fourth verse and it says and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger iso he was okay that we would hunger a little bit and then fed thee with mana so so he uh he humbled thee that he might make thee know that man does not live by bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord doth man live neither did thy foot swell these 40 years old wow deuteronomy the 29th chapter now verse 5 you have it you can say amen i have led you 40 years in the wilderness your clothes are not waxing old upon you and thy shoe is not waxing old upon thy foot it this message is a blessing to you as it was a blessing to me as the lord gave it to me for 40 years i don't know about you but i have a hard time fathoming that you know sisters you know when you get a new pair of tires on the state compromise i should say and they tell you that it'll last they'll go 60 000 miles how many of you does your tires actually last 60 000 miles i don't know maybe you have maybe you drive better than i do he says he says mine might only last about twenty five thousand macs their shoes and their clothes they did not wear out for 40 years i don't know about you but that's amazing isn't that just a fairy tale that's amazing i can't even preach a few times in my shirts and the sweat starts to eat up my my my colors did they sweat in the wilderness for 40 years for 40 years how is that possible that they don't wear didn't wear out almost especially in the conditions that they faced especially how do you be in a battle and you don't even get a tear on your clothes i want to tell you this morning that that's the god that i serve yes i don't know about you but turn to your neighbor say neighbor that's the god that we serve you and i want you to notice and capture of course the parallel the spiritual parallel that is going on here why do our clothes and shoes wear out theirs did not wear out for 40 years our clothes wears out all the time buy a pair of shoes but my question is as we look into it on the spiritual aspect of things spiritual why is it that our patience seems to wear thin all the time i'm talking now i'm going i'm going parallel now into the spiritual aura why does it seem that we are wore out all the time their clothes and their shoes did not wear out for 40 years [Applause] and we seem to of all the things that we go through in life jobs and all that we seem to get wore out so fast and i say something is not being renewed in us because god said in his word they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength i don't know if that's including you or not this morning but i'm going to say their clothes did not wear out for 40 years spiritually speaking we should not wear out either would renew their strength imagine them in the wilderness maybe a strap might have maybe tried to tear he says somehow some way the lord renewed their sandal perez are we wearing the right kind of garments today for the occasion there's garments different garments for different occasions you don't wear flip-flops to hike up mount everest very long a winter jacket when you go scuba diving you don't wear shorts and muscle shirt when you go up in a rocket and neither does the bride wear just any kind of clothes for her weddings dress by the word are you with me there is a certain kind of clothes for every occasion [Applause] certain there are many that claim to be the bride of christ today but they're all dressed differently and many think that they are dressed in muchos piensan but let's see how we should be dressed today if we're dressed properly and we know that our clothes and our shoes will not wear out man i don't know about you but that excites me this this morning i mean it's got to be able to stand up to the worst conditions that humanity has ever seen our clothes have to be able to handle the pressures of the day and our clothes have to withstand the attacks of the enemies you see we were not made to withstand the pressure of this day man was not made to handle the pressures that there are a people that are able to withstand the attacks of the enemy today because she is the only one that is dressed for the right occasion first peter and i hope you have your bibles ready as we as we go into this study peter five five says this cinco cinco di it's gonna tell us how we should be dressed today when i look at myself i said my am i dressed okay for the occasion all right my brother you're dressed right for the occasion but let's find out now let's see what kind of clothes we have to have so that we don't they don't wear out be subject one to another and be clothed in humility my my my my i don't know how many people actually have that outfit in their closet are you with me you ever see people that like to wear the same color all the time look how many have humility in their closets come on think about that this morning but we're getting something we gotta be closed with humility humility humility is the humbleness of your mind you're not looking to be noticed by everybody may i never become so proud that i think that i don't need nobody i pray that he will accept me i know he's accepted me but i pray that there can always be grace to the humble this is why there's so many problems in the homes and in the church we are not clothed with humility husband doesn't want to back down el esposite everybody wants to be right solo's getting this time everybody wants to win the the argument no one's kidding everybody wants to win the debate but i'm here to tell you we don't want our clothes to wear out you know come on church we know that we we might leave church sometimes we might leave church and we feel good you know we hear that somebody said something about us what happens then the spirit becomes disturbed i want to do good to those that despitefully use me you know i said vienna is and many are tired and many are wounded and many are broken-hearted did i just talk about anybody is that anybody today come on now we we want to act like we're superman i got my holy ghost ain't nothing going to happen i'm going to say it again we are in a battle they're so tired with things all these things are going on what's happening and i look and i say don't wear out yo today [Applause] i don't know about you but that excites me you understand again their clothes and their shoes never wore out my what paul would say be not conformed but be transformed of your mind we've got to be renewed constantly and you see a lot of people today oh we're going to heaven they got their sights set on the destination it wasn't just about the destination but it was about the training that they received while on their journey through the desert to the promises and their clothes and their shoes never wore out you see all the hardships that they endured think about it for a moment god would allow them to experience a certain need then he would watch them as they try to figure out how to satisfy the need so can you imagine they all get together how do we get water almost well i don't know i don't know how deep the water is we ain't getting nowhere no thomas you can't we're about to die of thirst moses please speak to the lord we need water okay now they didn't even have a doctor brother branham says with them this element cause they only needed one prescription i am the lord that healed it all the time they didn't need to have a bunch of doctors with them he is still the lord our healer he would permit those things so that they could come to trust him doesn't that sound like us many times always trying to figure out your way of doing everything but i'm guilty of that you're hunting and i look up that mountain we were hunting one year and that was casano it was so bad establishment was mark and omar who else was with us biola was with us killed two elk down in the canyon and the next day we had to go back down and pull out another one yes we're all a bit queasy just thinking of it made us feel bad couldn't make it funny got the second one alfie [Music] that's it it gets tiring it's gonzalo we always look for an easier way of doing things you're in the middle of a canyon you're thinking like a helicopter just come yesterday and then at that moment you start thinking about maybe i should buy horses so i can have them all year long and never use them they're always trying to find some an easier way and there's nothing wrong with trying to find an easier way many times there are easier ways of doing things there is no easy there's no easy way or a different way of receiving the holy ghost i am the way jesus trust how much do we really trust him question we can ask ourselves three five and six tells us the lord with [Applause] but in all is children of israel think he shall direct thy they become servants to that master do you get that church look up i'm going to say it again if god has a way but i try to go another way that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are matthew 6 24 if you want to write it down matteo says no man he says he says i want everybody to repeat with me no man he said you that's me that's anybody no man i want you to get it again no man no man can serve two masters and he says you cannot serve god means wealth it's a miserly desire to gain hoard wealth my here we are and they're closed didn't wear out watch where we're going here hoarding wealth money as we've heard many times the greek word is phil arguria la palabra which means the love of money yes and the love of money is the root of all evil my father would tell me my father think about that for a moment because many times that becomes our master yes and when we are we have become or we have another master then we have to wear the garment of a servant come on i want you to get this this morning you get another master you know you gotta wear a different clothes wear different clothes the clothing of a servant watch where we're going with this now and the holy spirit said he told me this yesterday why they are still servants to so many things when by now they should be masters of them so i tell your garments are showing who your master is did you get that church i want you to get i want to drive it home this morning garments show who your master is we can try to say that we are this or that is had if you had holes in your clothes mama would get your jeans i think one time somebody got a patch with marijuana flower on it marijuana i guess they didn't know what it was maybe they did i don't know this is like you pay hundreds of dollars sometimes or or jeans whatever with with holes and they're just coming apart at the scene they're walking around and then i'm like you like it it's okay i'm not speaking against that okay but i'm like you know when i was young that was no no that's her heart i got this idea from one of the sisters she got all my jeans and she and she she she sewed the the crease she sewed it all the way down [Laughter] but it's easier to iron so leave it alone we were poor so we had to that's what we had so that's what we did that's what we were given when we look at that we once again he says tell my people why are they still servants to so many people so many things forgive me they should be masters of them you say brother i'm not a servant to nothing he said let me see how many of you have a temper and he told me to ask you why are you still servants to that temper i'm here to help you not to throw at you yes to look in the mirror myself first why are we still servants to that to to that temper and without realizing it we're dressed because our temper is our master and when we get upset at something we we lash out right away we have a temper going on why why is this going on because we are servants to he says tell them why they're still servants to their anger let me stop if you're really truthful how many of you have anger problems how we're amongst ourselves doing that to the lord say lord i confess i've got this cheaters i'm going to kick him into it gets kind of hard hot to raise your hand after a while why are they still servants to gossip or questions and we think we're all pretty nice and ready for the rapture ready for the for the for the wedding it is the condition is why they're still servants to their habits pregnant why are we still servants to our own thoughts and feelings oh church when will we become master of these things i don't i i ain't playing around i ain't playing church i'm not here just to pass the time i'm here to help you make it home i don't want anything else care about nothing else but i want to help you make it home when will we become master of these things you know when we began to dress ourselves with clothes and shoes that don't wear out instead we are closed in lugardo as servants and not as masters we are dressed as bridesmaids instead of as the bride we want to look at the bridesmaids they want to look good too right now they look nice they get dressed up they're still a bridesmaid and then ask us to dress in a white maid come on now in the beginning brother brahms says why is it that we come to a circumstance and we blow up right away no god ain't marrying servants hello i'm going to say it again god is not marrying servants was made yeah sons and daughters was made to be master of every circumstance and if we can't do that then we're playing church it's wrong somewhere i don't want one of you to be left behind the bride has made herself ready god help us and there's only one way now is what did god what what did god place absolutely perfect faith absoluta are you with me it says perfect faith perfecta is a master of every circumstance then if we don't have perfect faith or perfect trust because here we go again like they like like the children of israel here's the problem here's the issue get this done don't ask me how my clothes don't wear out but no they don't no perfect faith is a master of every circumstance first timothy 6 5 through 11. perverse disputing i'm going to read it just in english to save time perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godliness from such withdraw thyself you can you can repeat this now or translate it people want to measure how blessed they are how many possessions they have we we might have this or that does not mean that oh god is really blessing me he says i am in the perfect will of god look at what he's doing that's not the way to gauge it godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we carry nothing out amen and having food enragement or clothing let us there with let us be there with content you got food how many got food here we got natural food natural i think you're all looking okay got spiritual food many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition tell me that's not the truth because the more money you get equal hi that's not talking about anybody here because i know you all don't i don't know i do though okay i'm guilty probably after a while just every day there's a package at the door huh christmas every day watch what he says here for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith watch now they've aired from the faith which faith is what perfect faith is the master of all circumstances they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows but thou oh man of god oh i like that when i look in the mirror and it says thou come on come on put yourself there or the love of money is the root of all evil brother branham says keep away from that stuff i always know brother brown says weakness of ministers that usually takes them out of the harness of god is money ministers too we get it and that which fell among thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to perfection it doesn't say they don't bring no fruit noise it cannot drain because everything brings fourth of its kind does not bring forth fruit unto perfection a perfection my goodness do you see when we rely god's telling us don't have you can't have two masters because once you rely on someone right you become the servant to that and instead he wants us to rely on solely on him or when the love of money is what motivates us [Music] because now i want this and i want that and i have this and i got to have that or i'm not happy you're a million miles from the from the kingdom of god nothing wrong as humans i understand they're saying oh i would like that if god wants to add that to me and praise the lord but when i go in debt try to get that but watch it now that master is going to wear you out because now you're always on pins and needles you're always worried how am i going to make the payments how am i going to do this come on church we become servants we become servants to our debt we become servants to our lustful desires in the midst of it all god's saying i have a way you're thinking why aren't you following me i can't sleep at night because you're a servant whipping the left and right there people getting whipped you got to work two jobs three jobs three quarters unto you and this is just in english now take no thought for your life what ye shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body what ye shall put on i got clothes that you know nothing and the body and the raiment behold the fowls of the air for they so not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feeded them are you not much better than they wherefore if god so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you o ye of little faith and their clothes and their shoes therefore take no thought why you're gonna what you shall eat or what you shall drink verse 31 or whether or whether or where with all ye shall be clothed for all these things do the gentiles seek or your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness [Music] and all these other things shall be added to you let me tell you something when god adds you a new car you'll make sure that you always have what it what you need to pay a payment every month god gives you a new house he'll make sure that he provides shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof when i think of valley forge brother branham says george washington george washington two-thirds of men with no shoes bought to give us the economy that we have today that's why i was talking about last sunday economical they went after what their ideas were glory to god but they gave their lives the economy we have paracetamol and then america sells out what is american americans i have no idea when i started you know but that's okay there are no aspects to keep on going today money should never be our purchasing power el nino nunca is that not just the millionaires will have to give an account for the millions of dollars they've spent every single one of us for every penny he has put in our hands this morning money should never be our purchasing power from god for there is only one healer god what they accidentally dropped a coin he said now peter probably would have caught the fish in his mouth jesus said go and catch that fish look at his mouth what kind of money we need do you see what the holy ghost was telling us on wednesday by breaking bread and multiplying it how is that greater than what he's doing today the question is how many would have loved to have been there with jesus fed 5 000. i would have loved to have been there spent every bit of my time just sitting at his feet breaking and multiplying the bread element greater than what he's doing right now watch our mind this is why we're hearing on wednesday what's the mentality if i stood here this morning and this was a loaf of bread and i would get this and i'd rip it and right before your eyes the loaf would come whole again watch this now pikacy we're doing something that was done watch this now but somehow people think it lesser la gente pizza listen close listen to me this morning we think it lesser quest when we have prayed as a body of believers 20 000 i would have loved to have been there two thousand years ago but he placed us here today and we are seen with our own eyes multiply the bread multiplication multiply the fun multiplication [Applause] jesus is not just worried about our spiritual being even though that's the most important but millions are hearing the message every single day provided the radio program or the radio thousands of message books have been printed and this is just us yesterday that's all the other brothers around the world that are doing and doing for the kingdom so that we can say oh look what we're doing if i ever have that attitude i would not send another dime over there because that's not about look what our church is doing we think that way that's the most if i have just a little bit of time that i can get into something that i really want yeah watch this now i if it doesn't go down open our eyes and you'll see the same lord jesus working through his body people online standing sending him love offerings just help and send this this work is not it's not just ours it's part of the body of christ that is producing this one of you for what you have given and what you're giving and i want to tell you that our shoes and our clothes have not worn out we all have food on our tables we have men like brother anthony anthony i appreciate the lord i appreciate the lord for all of you but the lord put someone in his path to distribute and donate food he never hoarded it to himself he said where can we who can we give it to you he knew god had god knew that he had a heart for the people many here have been supplemented in their homes a little to somebody talking about money that's the easiest thing give up yourself give what you the experiences that you have received that god has brought you through yeah jesus and jesus went forth and saw a great multitude and he was moved with compassion 1414 of matthew compassion move with compassion toward them and he healed their sick illusion where we come around the corner one corner and when it was evening disciples came to him saying you got to know the people this is a desert place i'm going to tell you today i look around here in las cruces this is the desert and the time is now passed this is the disciples send the multitude away they may go into the villages and buy themselves this is the this is the next wave of it now how many are still with me and i have like like 15 20 minutes please please just just let me let me have just this to give it get it out and then and then i won't preach for a little while because i got another one right behind this one watch what jesus said they need not depart no no they said you don't know the people to go and figure it out and buy it on their no no no he says give ye them to eat i lie i take that personally give them to eat in other words what are you saying let them go figure it out on their own let them go no don't let them leave no they can't go and give them to eat and that's what he's telling us give them to eat my lambs both physically and spiritually spiritually this is the scripture that the lord gave me when i moved to las cruces my wife moved and i asked the lord for a confirmation mark 10 28 and peter said began to say unto him lo we have left all and have followed thee this is going to this scripture is going to wrap up the remaining part so listen closely and jesus answered and said verily i say unto you there's no man that hath left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospels that is probably every one of us in here yes sir yes but he shall receive a hundred-fold now in this time oh brother when i get to heaven this time houses you didn't think that you're gonna get by with all that and not have a little persecution it's not just about the destination it's about the training in the wilderness oh i like that with persecution come on now my family's clothes and shoes have never worn out what is that it's him fulfilling his word fulfilling his promises not just 25 years the day i was born it has been paid already my debt has been paid literally and spiritually literally christ had already paid the price for my salvation president when i was born my dad went to the to the accounting office my wife just had a baby on here to pay the account i don't know about you but that's how i started i see come and say you all started with my debt was already paid i love him how can i not preach come on no no mighty people cannot help his people fade away a greater way yesterday church we're gonna make it somehow some way is grace my life my clothes never wore out even if at times i had hand-me-downs from my cousin jean or tommy or whoever they were i was like on the list but my clothes never wore out somehow revelations 13 11 through 7. let's go 16. and i'm not going to get into a lot of this but but i want to just i want to just hit a highlight real quick and he causes all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand and in their forehead no let me just read it in english and that no man you can read the 17. and that no man might buy or sell. he that had the mark or you ever go register a vehicle roger or laura roger or laura or you put roger and laura roger if it's anne both of them have to be present right both of them have to sign yes watch how satan a spirit el where no man can buy or sell there's a prophet in the midst of this god the church will be enjoying a great three and a half years in glory in glory they won't have to go through that no tendran que pasa they won't have to go through what nothing that you can't buy or sell let me tell you something the bride of christ she knows how to buy and just study these at home read them give us of your oil our lamps are gone rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy me the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage door was shot [Applause] she is given precious praise god he doesn't leave anybody out and he's that they have no money without money in dinero and without price it's impressive what a promise he's inviting you come here how do you buy without money easy study currency and money a little bit and you'll get it but we need to afford something i owe him my life growing up i heard so many stories my father on the mission field and as a child i i knew nothing just the things i would hear about sacrifices that he had made sacrificing and every time he went out he it was a sacrifice yet we sacrificed along with him at the home sacrifice any of you sacrificed which was there many of you you moved where he you followed him wherever he would go sacrificed your families sacrifices god don't forget those things but that never stopped him from going out and preaching what an example that was to me i'd be familiar with all those that would see him he didn't take money because he didn't have any no and i didn't understand that until i until recently that it was a fulfillment of scripture if we can't find ourselves in the scripture we got to go back and read it or we got to get a closer look but i want you to to get this now we all sacrificed he would eat wherever they would feed him he would sleep wherever he could find a place or in his car he would give everything he had then i understood the scripture that the lord gave me you know i'm going to go back and just just paraphrase it real quick there is no man that hath left house and brethren and on and on it goes a hundredfold search that in the scriptures search a hundredfold what it really means that's what we have seen is a hundredfold of souls coming in and as i read this and i began to see the story of peter and john at the gate called beautiful pedro they said the same thing silver and gold we don't have but what we do have we give to you silver and gold we have none but what we do have this morning we do give to you as i was contemplating this yesterday the lord says look at the first commission you'll understand i pulled up matthew the tenth chapter if you want to read read it with me let's go from seven to ten and i'm just gonna read it in english and as ye go preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead cast out devils freely ye have received freely give provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purses nor script for your journey neither two coats neither shoes nor yet staves for the workman is worthy of his meat don't take extra coats or extra shoes or your clothes and your shoes will not wear out watch the first commission jesus in flesh with them jesus and right before jesus is about to be betrayed and then crucified hello crucifix he makes this declaration to his disciples watch this now he can say this is luke 22 now got to put this together now and i'm closing now luke 22. verse 35. once again the first commission he gave la primero don't take gold or silver or don't take coats or don't take shoes and now before he's about to give his life now he said unto them when i sent you without purse and script and shoes lacked anything else and they said yes brother abraham through all those times whether it was harder did you lack anything el monoracanos algo nothing adam that was the first commission he gave up there but as he was going to he was going to go away watch now what he says then said he unto them and likewise is scrip italian to it's the commission now go into i promise brother we'll get to the piano because man i took some time today we take it because we are the beneficiaries of a man that left it all our founding pastor preached the message lead us souls that have been one to christ he's added brethren to us that we never knew we are so blessed church we have each other here though sometimes we might get on each other's nerves a bit okay something that offends us oh it is brother daniel shared this with me and i want to just share it with you in the message the word became flesh and they that are the sons of god are led by the spirit of god then when the human element goes out in its power of the resurrection of the lord jesus christ will walk in his step and i'm going to say i'm going to say what i said earlier when you walk in his step understand the path has been made for you already your shoes don't wear out neither do your clothes that's when we will walk in his steps do you see what i mean then your thoughts enter then your thoughts will become words it should be in us already yes brother diego diego it's already in us yes i'm here to tell you it's not on the road no more it's already in us yes we haven't recognized it right brother we have not recognized the power
