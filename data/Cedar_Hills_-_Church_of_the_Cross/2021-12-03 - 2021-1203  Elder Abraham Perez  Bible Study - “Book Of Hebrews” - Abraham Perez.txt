[Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] do [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] good afternoon it's so good to see each and every one of you yes and i want to say i am very grateful knowing the time and i know especially for us all folks i was talking to nica yesterday you know it says look at us you know it might be cold and now uh wrist our eyes side is fading away amen can you imagine all the way from norway in norway and he said that he's been seeing our messages caleb since october of 2020 and the work that you do on the lord will not be just the lord will put it aside you will have a reward make a prayer to open our bible study biblical and uh we have a handkerchief here so if anybody has a need see and you said where there's two or three congregated in my name i will be there also yes and we are so thankful that you are with us and knowing that you are here we're asking for and pleading for your divine help we want to make a special prayer question for my granddaughter tableton her boys muchachos you know that she is kind of sick right now and we also want to pray for uh for sister cynthia who asked for prayer precious and heavenly father [Music] lord may you extend your hand of feeling and that disease of covert may your lord just we're not begging saying we're ordering him to get out of that body that belongs to the lord jesus christ lord and restore her to [Music] may you go to where she is and touch her at this moment and make her well he has lasagna we have a handkerchief here lord lord and as we place our hands on this handkerchief lord we're only doing what the apostle paul did and the anointing will go to where this sick person is her name is alejandra de la cruz all these for your honor and glory gloria and also be with us in this bible study biblical as we put our hands in we put our thing into your hands today in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen you may be seated well why not we are in uh our fourth uh bible study and if you will be so kind to open your bibles to chapter 2 verse 4 of the book of hebrews i think that's where we left out last time god also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own that's what we started last uh last time we had a bible study biblical says if god bore witness so when elijah was sitting on the hill from the elias established he said if i be a man of god let fire fall from heaven and consume this captain and his soldiers and you know what fire did fall from heaven because god bore witness testified that he was a man of god so your own life and such a supreme will bear witness that testimonial how you live every day of your life if you are a son or daughter of god you know that a tree is known by the fruit it bears so then i asked the question do you have the holy spirit can you stay the spirit santo do you know that the holy spirit maybe one thing that the holy spirit is what is the holy spirit uh okay it's also a seal you know so they see us standing here at church he use contempt people say well no just i mean it doesn't brother brown says that in in the bible there there were seven seals did he say there was no seals in the back of the boat for unto the angels has he not put in subjection the world to come whereas we speak to which angel did he give the world to control pero algesti because anybody answer me that question which angel quality he never said elijah you will have control over the whole world but watch paul magnifying christ hebrews 2 6 and 7 everyone says but one in a certain place testified saying what is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that dove visited thou made us him a little lower than the angel god crown as him with glory and honor and descent him over the works of thy hands los angeles who testifies it's it's a little different different and i don't you know to call you by name because we were used to like because we were at home studios we were we had everybody close by so it's a little different here and it used to be that that people were scared of me especially when i would come down especially mexico don't worry i won't go there not the place no no no i said i mean so and and i don't wanna you know because some somebody would get a uh embarrassed or says and so i just asked the question you know who testified savvy skin mindful of him and the son of man that visited a little lower than the angels and has crowned him with glory and honor thou mayest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands thou has put all things under his feet so you see that david was the one that testified thou has put all things in subjection so we're on the question which angel had control over the whole world established control you want to find out get in ayala 10 matthew 28 san mateo capital verse 17 and when they saw him they worshiped worship him but some doubted and jesus came and spoke unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth so who that's why david there was not one of these angels that we think oh but we're going to get into something good on that same question maybe not not today but we will kisanos what was it he died and his spirit left him [Music] and god was that pillar of fire idiots that led the children in the wilderness and when he died he turned back to that the logos had been made flesh and had been killed and rose again for our justification and then he became [Music] to the heart of his son christ jesus christ jesus to live and reign forever god was in christ which was the final resting place of the spirit but solomon built him a house peros acts chapter 7 verse 46 foreign who hung found favor before god and desire to find a tabernacle for the god of jacob this is how big the most high dwellers not in temples made with ants as say the prophet heaven is my throne and the earth is my fruits too what house will you build me saith the lord or what is the place of my rest casa [Music] for god was in the mercy who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crown with glory and honor coronado gloria that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man emilio why was god made a little lower brother moreno what why was he made a little more than the angel okay this is so he could taste dead you know wherefore when he cometh into the world he said sacrifice enough in thou it is not but a body has now prepared me this is so he could redeem you and i the brother friend says the homeless sin we saying the world is not my home i'm just the best invite you say no no i got a nice house why did god jesus christ when he come when he came yo if you know the book of hebrews you know we're going to hit that theophany hard later on did the patriarch abraham ever found what he was looking for the patrick hamas what was he looking for this doesn't develop says he searched for a city he said he found the city william william ayola william are you searching for a city he came to redeem the homeless to give us a home in heaven he gave us a home and because he gave he lived all the glory we're not liking the times of noah that lived almost a millennium we there used to be us a saying so tom says he became homeless eligible cersei no he came to you and me the sinners [Music] to become sin but you gotta say pecan so you can see it's not me i have nothing for you people you are not even but he who lives in me has a lot for you and a certain scribe came and said unto him master i will follow thee whether so ever thou goes and jesus said unto him the foxes have hoped and the birds of the air have nest but the son of man had no where to lay his head jesus those dears for it became him for whom our all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren my mom saying i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will i sing praise unto thee and again i will put my trust in him and again behold and the children which god had given me or as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil he was participating in participation and delivered them who through fear of death were all their lifetimes subject to bondage so he came to deliver them from bondage you might say i never was in band i tell you i was in bangladesh you were never a free man you stand up for nobody liberty you you weren't i don't know in this congregation you know it's a congregation but many were in bondage to liquor which they wanted to and the three stooges or the three musketeers we have to walk from hanover to santa rita maybe it was about two three mile commodore we were real poor we didn't have money to buy cigarettes so the only thing we occurred in our pockets were some matches uh we used to recycle the cigarettes because we were in bondage so then everybody is one way or another you were in bandit you never got liberty for freedom until you came to this message and not only because you came to the message [Music] amen hallelujah hallelujah so this poster paul is talking to the hebrews here you know he would go to this all these places lugares and boy he laid down the law el poniala notice they can say [Music] how many fear deaths and and a lot of people they lie with a straight face [Music] [Music] but you know that if a person is born again so then how can we die if we're still with the holy spirit and have eternal life see someone say i was going to speak to something and how can we die come on didn't jesus say nothing jesus lazarus is not dead how can you die and we do not understand enough there's still a little bit of fear because brethren says we don't we do not understand them we it even made the son of god say could this come yes yes says or verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of abraham los angeles [Music] he never became an angel he wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to god to make reconciliation for the sins of the people to make reconciliation for the sins of the people pueblo there was enmity between god and men avia an enemy and mistakenly no man send the angels or when it says angels it means prophet they couldn't take your place because they had to pray for themselves but then he sent the law it was a policeman that put us in jail but they couldn't bring us out but it could not make an atonement nobody expiate but he came down and became one of us for in that he himself has suffered being tempted he is able to stop how do you pronounce this factor or stop court disappear secure thank you secure them that are tempted to [Music] [Music] he was created an adult [Music] he wanted to see what you and i passed through but he said i will not leave you comfortably and jesus took that in order to make intercessions for us jesus [Music] that's the end of chapter two let me say if there's any questions or something that you wanna know more maybe i didn't explain to you satisfaction you know write me a note or anything so we can we can discuss it here you know and if you have read this book if you have noticed picado i do not know what happened you're not saying truthfully i don't know what happened on my book in in mid level of hebrews that i have in the liberal debrief tango it doesn't start with verse 1 it starts in verse 15. are your books are your books like that also you should give us you guys have read chapter three of hebrews brother branham does not start with verse one emmanuel not coming how many have a book that it does start with verse 1 is something wrong with the book did they forget to to explain the first 14 verses it starts in verse 15 he says tonight we start with chapters uh verse 15 of chapter three so george you know what some divine help here so let's see what the lord gave me on the first 14 verses oh we will have time tonight [Music] i don't know why verses one to fourteen were omitted brother branham says emmanuel brennan today we are just beginning to go get over into the cream estamos entrance so the cream is the contents of the milk now this is brother we're in chapter three okay so now we're going into the deep water if you're not doesn't the natural type the spiritual right yeah they do i even like leftovers i see it he says if you are not a good fat enough christian we're going into deep waters and uh let's see what the something i don't know if they just forgot to i don't know you know okay so i'll just leave it alone wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly colon consider the apostle and high priest of our profession christ jesus who are the holy brethren the book of acts 1 chapter 1 verse 14 and 15. these all continue with one accord in prayer and supplication with the woman and mary the mother of jesus and with his his brethren gintano notice for they were done in those days peter stood up in the midst of the disciples and said the number of names together were about a hundred and twenty especially philippians chapter 3 verse 13 billy pence's capital transversal because remember he said being with a holy brethren and the the calling but this one thing i do or getting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before hermanos perez of god in christ jesus christ give me three one again holy brethren partakers of the heavenly colon consider the apostle i asked the question you are or not good to learn there's one operand there you know brilliant okay notice they can say saint john 17 this word spake jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee as thou has given him power over all flesh that he to give eternal life to as many as thou has given him to and this is life eternal that they might not be the only true god and jesus christ which thou hast sent yesterday jesus christ back to 3-1 consider the apostle and high priest a we're going to get something good here seeing that we have a great high priest that is them to the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold first to our profession this is the pikachu the difference this is a big difference so then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens second corinthians 9 12 second corinthians for the administration of this service not only supplies the one of the saints but is abandoned also by many thanksgiving unto god but verse 13 really because of the proof given by this ministry they will glorify god for your obedience to your confession use doesn't bible doesn't say that right experiences they will glory glorify god for your obedience to obedience to your confession of the gospel of christ de cristo and for the liberality of your contribution to them contributions be a confession to the high priest what is confession the truth of the same kind look at that or of the same kind of classic years some time ago i was in somebody's house in silver city i i forgot already and one of the young guys says he told this other guy ladies that every seed produced of its own kind and they were obedient to the truth he said and for tonight i'll finish with this that when when you have him the time passes by first [Music] and did not produce the seed that he was supposed to produce so the lord said cursed is your inheritance no wonder the apostle paul said what was the phone on the side of paul pablo how many have given thoughts on that we've suffered from some spiritual thoughts in our walk with the to talk about and i'm just going to read you the scripture and it's going to get pulled it is going to get very deep in that one so just so you can see what we will be starting 17 san lucas capital decision 26 vessel 26 as it was in the days of noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man go ahead they did it they drank they married wife they were given in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all like also it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted and they built it when there's a lot of construction going on with the word of prayer lord jesus we just thank you tonight for such a grand privilege lord to be in your presence lord just to be your children lord be a part of your inheritance as your prophet said lord jesus never gave me my inheritance why i had my inheritance before the foundation of the world but jesus paid the price for my inheritance and our residence we just thank you for that lord we love you announce this missus and peace protect us as we go may your angels encamp around about us for we ask it all in the precious name of our lord and savior jesus christ amen amen god bless you be with you
