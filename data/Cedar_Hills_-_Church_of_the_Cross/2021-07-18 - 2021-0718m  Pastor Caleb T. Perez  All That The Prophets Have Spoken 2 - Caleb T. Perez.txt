========================================

[Music] [Music] so [Music] you [Music] more [Music] do [Music] do [Music] do [Music] [Music] a helpless man flying from birth the only one who saw his worth didn't pass in my he heard his cry [Music] he rubbed his eyes with a handful of clay then he said go washing the pool today and the blind man knew that's what he had to do you know along the way he couldn't help but trip and fall [Music] is faith when i can't see what's in front of me oh i'm gonna just believe he hears my prayer and we're not there the miracle promised by my father is waiting in the water i walked in darkness i won't lie just like that blind man sometimes i felt all alone like all hope was gone i know that his word is true and no matter what i'm going through he promised me that he would never leave [Music] if [Music] [Applause] is [Music] is waiting in the water [Music] i know he knows where i am and somehow [Music] is a step of faith when i can't see what's in front of me [Music] is waiting in the [Music] the water it's waiting in the water [Applause] now we notice now as we go into the sixth seal now may the heavenly father help us as we settle down now to this sixth seal now this twelfth verse of the sixth chapter and i beheld when he opened the sixth seal and roll there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became his blood and the stars of heaven fell onto earth even as a fig tree cast her untimely figs when she's shaken of a mighty wind and the heavens departed as a scroll when it's rolled together never a mountain every island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great man and the rich man and the chief captains and the mighty man and everybody and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that set up on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand if we find out now john said i'll be held when he opened the sixth seal that was a great earthquake then all nature was interrupted see but we find out here that nature tucker tumble yes all nature look what taking place the the earthquake the sun went black and the moon would give its light the stars shook and found while everything happened right at the time of the opening of this sixth seal that's why it takes place probably immediately after the announcing of those martyrs the martyrs have been finished now you see we're right close into that hour now we could be at any time because the church is just about ready to take its flight but remember when these things happen the bride won't be here just remember the bride's gone you don't have to go through any of it this is a time of tribulation purification of the uh of the church it's put up on her board go do it not the right it takes his sweetheart out of the way that's cersei done redeemed her see it's kind of a that's his own selection his own choice like any man who takes his bride now the earthquake compares scriptures of this great event that we will see that this great secret or mystery that was under the sixth seal of the book of redemption now remember these are hidden mysteries and the six seals all together is one great big book this six scrolls rolled together and unwinds the whole book of redemption that's how the whole earth was redeemed that's reason john wept because if no one could get that book all creation everything was gone she just simply turned back to the atoms and molecules and so forth and cosmic light and not even be creation person nothing else because adam lost the rights of that book he forfeited it when he listened to his wife and she listened to satan's reasons instead of the word of god it was far but then it couldn't go back into the dirty hands of satan who tempted her out of the way so therefore it went back to its original owner like for any see goes right back to its original owner and that was god the creator who made it and he holds it now here let's start out now and let's read uh saint matthew the 24th chapter i just like to give you something here i've just looked up defined now saint matthew from one to three well it's where we go to read first and jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to show him the building of the temple and he said unto them see not all these things verily i say unto you there shall not be one be left here one stone upon another that shall not be drawn down these three verses it took place actually on tuesday afternoon april the 4th 80 30. and the first two verses took place on the afternoon of the of april the fourth at 80 30 and the third verse taken place on tuesday evening of the same day see now notice here is there is three questions are asked by the jews here's the science three questions you asked what what um uh first verse was when shall these things be when there won't be one stone that flipped upon another what shall be the sign of thy coming second question and of the end of the world see these three questions see just exactly comparing what jesus said in matthew 24 and what the revelator here opened up in the sixth seal is just exactly and jesus was speaking of the tribulation theory this sixth seal is the tribulation period that's what takes place the bride has gone there's no living creature nothing there to say it it's just now god is not dealing with the church the more it's been gone he's dealing with israel this is the other side this is when israel received the message of the kingdom by the two prophets of revelation 11. remember israel is a nation god servant nation and when when when israel is brought in it'll be a national event and uh that's when they're supposed to be delivered now look lest we get to daniel 12 here just a minute and at that time michael shall stand up the great prince which stood for the children for for the children of thy people see that's jews and there shall be a trouble such never was since there was a nation even to that same time now compare that exactly what jesus said matthew 24. there shall be a time of trouble has never been since there was a nation look at this sixth seal see the same thing a time of trouble notice since there wasn't even to the same time and at that time five people now in this seven last part of the seventh year thou people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book the predestinated you see that's written in the lamb's book of life shall be delivered at that time and many of those asleep in the dust the earth shall await and some everlasting life and some of the evolution shame and contentment now and then shall the wise shine as the brightness of the permits and and they're going to turn many to righteous shall shine the stars forever and ever and i will give power unto my two witnesses that they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three score days cold and sackle these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks that stand before the god of the earth if any man hurt them father proceedeth out of their mouth divide their enemies and if any man shall hurt them he must in this manner be killed hey there it is they can speak what they want to and that happens [Music] hey amen brother god rides on the scene here they have powerless uh power to shut the heavens that it rain not in the days of their prophecy and have power over the waters to turn them to blood and to smite the earth with flags as off as they will what is it god can bring these things but the word they can do nature any way they want to here it is they are the one who brings on this sixth seal they uncover and open it up it's a power of god this interrupt nature see the sixth seal is completely an interruption of nature do you get it now there's your seal who does it it's the prophets the other side of the rapture and here he is with the commission from god despite the earth whatever he wants to do stop the heavens and he does what's the matter he's fixing to take the 144 thousand out for redemption out of the foot of redemption and that's under the seal of redemption and the sixth seal that's it my dear friend that's that sixth seal it's so mysterious and here is a word taking what he has given to me and blending it together and showing you so you know yourself it's the same [Music] amen that's thus saith the lord amen amen thank god for a prophet this morning no reason why we should be in the dark amen god

ministers we appreciate that and also we we want to keep in prayer i know that they they said they they prayed for him just keep him in prayer but that's that's my uncle danny daniel who was placed in hospice as they said he no they're going through a good one there in uganda after brother julius had had a stroke he's doing much better but now he's then his wife had a stroke was laying in bed for some days i think a couple weeks actually she wasn't it wasn't talking at first and they couldn't walk on her own at all but here's a picture a couple days ago he's up and walking now that's not just not coming we are grateful to god for that he's still performing miracles amen so we are grateful to god for that well we we are going to get into the word vamos anthrax started a new it is all that the prophets have spoken and uh we want to last week we hit on the cog will of prophecy and today we what we are going to hit on a prophet like unto moses and so we we're going to go as easy as we can is to get the young people to be able to know why they believe what they say is we believe that that we have a scriptural a word prophet that came in our day then we also must be scriptural people amen so uh there you go we got we got did you did you read last time okay did you read last night you two did okay so they they did so after this you'll just hand it to behind you okay and then when if we go all the way down then we'll come back over here in the same way there would just did you did eliza and lily did you all read last time you did okay so then when it goes down then we'll okay and then we'll come back around it and we'll we're going to ask that our young people they reach for us 37 sister sister zoe if you can get genesis 24 7. and then brother elijah you can go uh luke 16 28-31 and then we'll we'll go from there we're going to have some fine preaching this afternoon so this morning is sunday school okay so let's just see what god has for us and it's not just for the youth okay i got it let us all even if it's a refreshing course okay sister go ahead into them then he said unto them o fools and soul of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken all that who have spoken the prophets have spoken and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself amen may god add his blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated because we have so many scriptures to read this morning we probably won't be won't won't be interpreting all the scriptures spanish just take the scripture and you can read it as they're reading it is to these two disciples and once again he is he is trying to get them to identify him not by their sight no perseverance but he wants them to identify him through the scriptures now once again everybody understand that he is the word jesus christ is the word therefore everything that he says and does foreign exactly what it says he was and is the identified christ of these are scriptures that you you should know young people and always always repeat them and get to know them surely the lord god will do nothing some things alguna's vessels young people some things there is encuental gunas i'm sorry maybe you're you're not awake this morning okay the lord your god will do some things we'll do what he will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophet the who akin the popes los papas the cardinals who kin the prophets now we know that noah was a prophet amen but does anyone know the first time that the word prophet was used in the bible this is anyone can answer okay called i want to know a specific time that the word prophet that's why i said noah was a prophet and it was mentioned before this but the bible doesn't say prophet about noah brother branham says noah was a prophet where the very word prophet was used for the first time who said it and who were they who were they talking about lava a little bit before that antecitos queso was that's exactly right wow i think she deserves a clap this morning that's exactly right was when he had told king abimelech that that sarah was his sister and the king was going to marry her right so who's the one that called abraham a prophet in a dream and therefore genesis 2 7 who's got it mr i'm sorry genesis 20 verse 7 that's my fault now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live and if thou restore her not now know thou that thou shalt surely die down and that or is the mouthpiece of god here on earth one more time the lord god will do nothing he will not speak outside of his mouth and in the old testament the first one is nabi and it means to bubble up it describes one who is stirred up in spirits when the sense of bubbling up is applied one who pours forth the declaration of god sounds a lot like the story that brother branham talks about of that spring that keeps bubbling is that right there is it describes one who is a revealer of secrets once again the lord god will do nothing but he revealeth his secret to his servants the prophets a prophet is a prophetess a foreteller one who speaks for another when you break down the word it is one who speaks for god because many times you have people that think that they're that god's going to change his way of doing things but god does not change the way he does it it is his plan it is his system and does god ever change his mind about his word now watch this now he doesn't reveal to no one else but his spokesperson everybody wants to be the pastor of spokespeople and and uh you know i i i that doesn't honor me okay i don't feel like wow you know you hear it all the time well the pastor told me well good it's for you just keep it at that it's not right man [Music] well the pastor said okay really did he say it like that we always want to try to get the upper hand in a conversation with people well the pastor told me if i have anything to tell you i'll tell you myself did he send you to tell me that oh i mean i have people that hold grudges against me because somebody told them that i said something yo you appreciate let me get back to my message let's continue luke who's got 2427 lucas did i give that to anybody okay i'm sorry luke 16. who's got that lucas yes okay now now watch this now as he begins to read this how many know that the jews only listen to their prophets right it should be a good thing right people should listen to what the pastor has to tell them they should hear what the ministry what god gives the ministry to christians but look and look at this now and as long as somebody reads moses and the prophets they're okay with that but when the manifestation of what moses and the prophet said look at the story of the rich young ruler which we're about to read so much for well i'll just keep the commandments and be a good person he lifts up his eyes in hell and begins to have a conversation with father abraham go ahead brother verse 26 let's start with verse 27. then he said i pray thee therefore father that thou would have send me him to my father's house all right five people talking about sending lazarus right you send lazarus to his father's house go ahead right brethren that he may testify unto them thus they also come into this place of torment and what it what watch what what watch what abraham tells them abraham saith unto him they have moses and the prophets oh my that's the conversation that jesus is having with those on the road to him he started with moses and began to go expound all through the prophet and he had kept what moses and the prophet said he found himself so he knew that it wasn't just that he had kept moses and the prophet the one that moses and the prophets were speaking go ahead verse 30. and he said nay father abraham but if one went unto them from the dead they will repent and then he says and he said unto them if they hear not moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead if they hear not moses and the prophets that's why it says having ears they don't hear then having eyes they don't see november if the rich young ruler would have believed really moses and the prophets he would have had to believe jesus it's no different today that we claim to believe the scriptures only scriptural people will understand what shall i do to inherit eternal life what's the torah anybody you're close it is part of the bible what is it it was a scroll in those times it's pretty pretty good though the young girls the torah very good the torah is the first five books of the bible all right now now watch this now this is he had read the torah because he knew the commandments and had lived by them i see some of you some of the adults i didn't know but i ain't gonna tell nobody i didn't know that yeah i knew that write it down it's okay it's a refresher course he had lived and abided by the commandments he knew that there was something special about it he knew that he was a master a teacher but when he looked at him it didn't actually click that he was the one moses was talking about because they all pointed not to a prophet they all pointed to the prophet how many know that go back and read the old testament and everybody then beginning to speak or prophesy it was probably the greatest prophecy ever uttered by moses [Music] it was the greatest god-breathed utterance tremendous that moses had ever uttered if you stop for a moment this morning up and you think about what is the greatest thing you have ever uttered in your life what is the greatest thing you've ever uttered in your life think about it parents others what is the greatest thing that's ever come out of your of your mouth i'll give you a time think about it there's so many things that come to mind the greatest thing you can tell your brother and sister is god bless you there's a lot of tremendous things that can come out of our mouths there's a lot of maybe not so good things that have come out of our mouth but here is moses and he begins to to bubble up he's bubbling because something in him is happening he's about to speak on behalf of god and i can just imagine him as he begins to speak he begins to bubble over utterance he begins to utter something deuteronomy 18 15. the lord thy god will raise up unto thee a prophet hold him hold hold on hold on here he is okay this this is so this is so awesome oh from the midst of thee now of thy breath and this is the part that gets me like unto me oh that's why i say it's probably the greatest thing that he ever uttered i don't know i i i could just i could close my bible and say god bless you because it's a wonderful day with you and that's enough for me yes imagine that a man a man like you [Music] who said now here comes a spokesperson on the scene now he turns it around and says under inspiration he's going to raise up a prophet like me he's going to be a a man like me [Applause] i don't know about you but that gets me excited this morning he was that prophet that was just like moses what is so important about that is that the scripture is compounded would reveal jesus christ again at the end of the gentile dispensation he's not just speaking this because it sounds and this is gonna and he sees him coming and this is gonna happen and this is gonna happen sounds a lot like my life later he spoke these mighty inspired words greater than riches aj maybe we're going a little bit too high huh because we got to go down a little bit more who wants to answer what's that it is christ jesus christ right this is the messiah okay got to make sure that we get it if if we have to stop we'll stop now watch this now we know then that messiah was to be a prophet he's to be the god prophet he wasn't just a prophet no solo prophet he wasn't just the prophet he was the god prophet jesus jesus he was to be the god super prophet that's in the message we would see jesus once again tell your neighbor now i'm going to ask you another question so what was the sign of the messiah okay you you adults can answer too this is the discernment that was part of it who knows what the messiah sign was to be insane we're going to go out acts chapter 3 verse 20 through 24. i'm going to tell you again if i have ever told you anything i want to be a word pastor amen that's what uh that is my goal in life this is me meta me i want to be a worker scriptural pastor how many of you want to be a word bride what the skin is go ahead and read it when you're ready and he shall send jesus christ again go ahead which before was preached unto you whom the heaven must receive until the until the times of restitution of all things which god has spoken by the mouth of his holy prophets wait wait wait wait wait you know we missed a word sister that's okay but which god had spoken by the mouth of all his oh i like that word right oh double l oh yes spoken by the mouth some of his holy prophets he was speaking these things through through all the mouth of his holy prophets keep on going verse 22 and moses truly said unto the fathers a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you and it shall come to pass that every soul which will not hear that wait a minute here a moment this is why it's so important this is why we believe that that god sent a process this is why we believe it is ah brother caleb didn't say that this is the scripture but brother caleb is saying this now shall be destroyed from among the people verse 24 and all the prophets from samuel and spo and those that follow after as many as have spoken have likewise foretold the date they've all foretold of these days yes it is speaking of jesus christ but now in these last days my question is what form did he take in order to reveal himself again had he been a great pillar of fire that come down and showed them that so that that's what he was that he was a great pillar of fire they might have believed that say that again when out of the light steps forth a man it blinds them loci he could not do one thing in his life contrary to the scriptures so moses had already spoken the lord your god will raise up a prophet like unto me so he knew he couldn't go against the scriptures okay brother abraham you got we're going to give you ezekiel chapter three ezekiel capitol once again son of man yo the only time you read it deals with a prophet but there is only one viscera these others are sons of men but can somebody tell me your young people who is the son of man anybody jesus christ that's right he is the son of man but all the prophets that he sent us were sons of man you got it my brother okay we're just going to read the first part of these verses okay in ezekiel 3 we find it one two three four five times he said unto me son of man stop right there okay moreover he said unto me so ezekiel was ezekiel a son of man yes he was a prophet and he said unto me son of man okay verse 4 and he said unto me son of man verse 10 whatever he said unto me son of man verse 17 son of man i have made thee a watchman on unto the house of israel therefore hear the world at my mouth and give them warnings notice how god views this now do you think that god is so proud when he looks down and sees a son of man that he's going to use to speak the next one over here is deuteronomy 18 18 okay how many are with me this morning sometimes we're not used to just sitting down and listening we just want to go to church and just get on the horses go ahead and the lord said unto moses now this is god talking to one to one of his prophets go ahead see i have made the god to pharaoh wow and aaron this is the way god is viewing his spokesman i'm the for his day father that's right and aaron go ahead and aaron my brother shall be thy prophet that's right so aaron your brother that we the true word of god [Music] he was moses had to put a veil over his own face because he was that word moses had the word and after the word was he was god he has the word all right he had the word of the lord for that age and the true believer suspected and reverence god's prophets watch joshua's view of moses the revelation that joshua had towards god's anointing mr chavez you got it okay go ahead the servant of moses one of his young men answered and said my lord moses stop there we're not getting into the whole scripture i just want you to see this is the way that joshua is respected god servant god anointed we are preaching we go right now into the lord said and after moses said the lord your god shall raise up a prophet like unto me three verses later deuteronomy 18 18. god in the life of moses and jesus exodus 1 22 over here exodus did you read it yeah what's that that was your scripture okay you can get this next one exodus 1 22 exclusive brother angelo you're gonna have matthew 2 16 and then sister delilah you'll have jeremiah 31 15. okay let's go at birth a decree went forth to kill every male child born of the hebrews let's see it in the scriptures exodus 1 22. hold on a second we can't hear you let's put it as close is it working and pharaoh charged all his people saying every son that is born ye shall cast into the river and every daughter ye shall save a life watch how interlaced all these scriptures are miraculous when he saw that he was mocked of the wise man was exceeding and went forth and flew all the children that were in bethlehem and in the coast they're they're of from two years old and under according to the time which had delinquent diligently inquired of the wise men now it goes back again not only showing that scripture but now he's he's there's another scripture being quoted here drawing it all together go ahead verse 17 that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet saying and rama was there a voice heard limit and weeping and great morning rachel weeping for her children and would not be comforted because they are not and if you want to write this down you go back to jerome jeremiah 31 15. we won't read that one but it's exactly what was being spoken of here in the book of matthew and we understand moses number two moses was born in egypt and the children of israel were slaves in egypt i i think i read yours right exodus 3 verse 10. and then she's getting that the next hosea 1-1 and then mr abbey you're going to have matthew 2. 13-15 go ahead come now therefore and i will send thee unto pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt amen hosea one i'm sorry jose 11 1. when israel was a child and i loved him and called my son out of egypt my goodness matthew 2 13-15 and when they were departed behold the angel of the lord appeared to joseph in a dream saying arise and take the young child and his mother and flee into egypt and be thou there until i bring the word where he worried will seek the young child to destroy him but go to verse 15 now and was there until the death of herod that it

neighbor needs a little uplifting this morning okay he loves me his brother daniel martinez amen you got that watch now the religious world did not recognize him they were versed in the scriptures standing at the well why because they all knew from the moment she saw something was activated they knew the scriptures enough to know that that's what the silence is a prophet that could discern the he's gonna be a prophet because the scripture says it was a prophet he said i am he yo can you imagine when somebody well some say you're this i know but what did you say to her i know he's supposed to be a pro okay i know you're going to see it so you saw it i am wow we're looking for that every day i am [Applause] it's like and the vindicated because that fulfills the scriptures but but between

like 10 minutes would you 10 15 minutes and then we'll we'll close it down because we got service this afternoon okay who's who's got you got it matthew 23 1-3 then speak jesus to the multitude and to the disciples saying the scribes and the pharisees sit in moses see whoa whoa hold it can you imagine how pious they were getting there wrong wrong wrong they're bad what is the seed of moses moses is the place where judgment is passed down and they're sitting at the seed of moses trying to fulfill scripture that doesn't pertain to them all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe that and that's what jesus is telling him whatever they tell you look at you ladies that they want you to observe dude because they read out of out of the torah but and do but do not ye after their works where they say and do not that's right that's what jesus does whatever they tell you observe it look at this do the what they do because their life doesn't back up what they're speaking that do not live up to their standards james ii sister bethany james 2 13. santiago then you're going to be look for lego squad go ahead sister when you got it for he shall have judgment without mercy he has through no mercy and mercy which rejoices against judgment for he shall have judgment without mercy sitting in the seat of moses have no mercy and their judgment is there will not be mercy i want you to now notice the sequence of jesus now is the sequence of jesus how many are learning this morning getting all these and he came to nazareth where he had had been brought up and as his custom was he went to the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up too wow here's jesus you never sat down when he read the problem oh my i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna go into the mercy seat a little bit and then we'll stop and i'm gonna i'm gonna keep on reading this but but this is so tremendous he goes on the sabbath day and he's standing up to read the prophets and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah yes and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written was looking through it and he found where it was written and then he began to say the spirit deliverance to the capitol and all the eyes of them that were in the synagogue were fastened at him something was going on here he was doing things a little different watch this now the eyes were all fastened to believe all that the prophets have spoken jesus was to fulfill that later jesus in a different form and all bear witness that one went and wondered now watch now gotta get i'm sorry brother david i know this is worth a lot of money i'll take care of it they sit down judging everyone they sit there listen they tell everybody [Music] th this is important churches it's very important to understand because he as he began to say this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears and they wondered at the gracious words that proceeded out of his name how can such words come forward all gracious words once again who is the lamb of god jesus christ good job please everybody know that right jesus christ the lamb of god and as why now watch this now this is contrary to what the scribes and pharisees they were sitting on moses did not pertain to them for sitting on a seat that does not pertain i got to tell you this again that moses would return do not think that i will accuse you to the father there's one that accuses you in whom you trust huh we have moses and the prophets and the one that you trust there was the mighty god standing in full view mercy he died when his own as long as the sprinkled atonement was there but when the blood was removed amen amen as long as the blood is on the mercy showed that something come on now this this comes comes to us now when the church is raptured and he shall take the blood of the bullock i'm sorry leviticus leviticus 16 14 yesterday and he shall take the blood of the bullock and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat in the cloud of glory where does the sun rise the s-um where will the s-o-n rise in the east in the list where was the mercy seat city force the east is sufficient have mercy the blood had to lay on the altar and that's where you kneel and ask god for mercy and today and because they see the lamb getting off the mercies when that church is done there's no more mercy there no no you gotta go to the next yeah is can you see him can you see the lamb it wasn't william brandon no error william branham it wasn't just a prophet but when christ came and dwelt in that prophet it was more than more than just a prophet it gets too much god won't judge you and me you know who's go study on me you'll judge william brandon who's got william but only or you're included if you've accepted it and the altar brother branham says you say these ones were crying how much how much longer where everything lord i know had mercy these were the seven mercy seats on earth espera that he did not write as you stand to your feet so much to say but i pray that that you learned a little something this morning because there won't always to understand intender as he said in romans 9 23 and that he make might make known the riches of his glory [Music] gracias if we're speaking anything else to the to a dying world we're missing it gracious words should come forth are you bringing as many as we can first corinthians 4 1 therefore seen we have this ministry as we have received mercy is scripture already has spoken [Music] but is there anyone here that just says you know what i i really need to get a hold of the horns of the altar this morning i really need some mercy right now not to go out here and be the same kind of person when you really find your place there is where he writes in your heart when he writes that in your heart no one can erase that nothing i'm asking anyone it's your opportunity he said don't take away that from the church at alter where you kneel and you asked he's here today and he's giving you the opportunity on the opportunity to ask for mercy this morning is there anyone else wait a few minutes esperamos this is a scriptural church a scriptural bride that's all i
