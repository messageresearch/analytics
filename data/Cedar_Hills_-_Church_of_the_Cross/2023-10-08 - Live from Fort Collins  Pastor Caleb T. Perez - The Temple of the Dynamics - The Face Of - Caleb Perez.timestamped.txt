[40:54] much maybe you got to turn turn around
[40:56] and shake your neighbor's
[40:58] hand neighbor good to see
[41:01] you okay maybe you need a stretch a
[41:04] little
[41:07] bit let me tell you
[41:09] something when Solomon was dedicating
[41:12] the
[41:14] temple uh-uh nuh we got a couple that
[41:17] are
[41:19] happy said all the
[41:23] congregation all the musicians
[41:27] all worship together as one
[41:30] man so I want to make sure that you're
[41:33] ready for
[41:36] dedication so how many are
[41:38] happy how many are the Temple of the
[41:42] Dynamics it seems like we have a bunch
[41:45] of temples of the
[41:48] mechanics but it's time that we bring in
[41:51] the
[41:52] Dynamics because we are the temple
[41:55] brother bradam says of the
[41:59] Dynamics 1 Chronicles if you can be so
[42:02] kind 1 Chronicles 29 1
[42:07] through3 we'll probably just read uh 1
[42:10] and
[42:12] two when you have it you can say
[42:18] amen God bless those that are on
[42:22] hookup God bless all the ministry that
[42:24] is here
[42:27] certainly good to see each one of
[42:32] you furthermore David the king said unto
[42:35] all the
[42:36] congregation Solomon my son whom alone
[42:39] God hath chosen is yet young and tender
[42:42] and the work is great for the palace is
[42:46] not for man but for the Lord
[42:55] God
[43:02] now I have prepared with all my might
[43:05] for the house of God of my God the gold
[43:09] for things to be made of gold and the
[43:11] silver for things of silver the brass
[43:14] for things of brass the iron for things
[43:16] of iron and wood for things of wood onx
[43:19] stones and stones to be set glistering
[43:22] stones and of diverse colors and all
[43:25] manner of precious stones and marble
[43:27] Stone in
[43:52] abundance may God add His blessings to
[43:55] the reading of his word you may be
[43:59] seated what a desire that David
[44:03] had I remember when we first went to Los
[44:08] Cruses it was the thing that was that
[44:11] weighed so heavy upon
[44:15] me that we would have a place of
[44:19] worship now I remember the joys when we
[44:22] were able to build the
[44:25] church
[44:26] finally have our own
[44:29] place my the joy I as brother Titus was
[44:32] telling
[44:35] me I could I could hear the hear the joy
[44:38] in his
[44:41] voice but I I could feel it more than
[44:44] just hear
[44:46] it and so the desire that David had for
[44:50] the Ark of the
[44:53] Lord the desire to build a temple
[44:58] as we go back and just for a few moments
[45:00] I just want to I want to talk just a
[45:01] little bit about that
[45:05] Temple we know that David was not
[45:07] permitted to build
[45:10] it because of all the blood that was
[45:13] shed during his
[45:17] lifetime but as the Lord told him your
[45:19] son would would build the
[45:23] temple and and through the process of
[45:26] all
[45:27] this you know there was a woman that
[45:29] heard about uh this this great man this
[45:32] great king named
[45:36] Solon everybody knows she was a queen
[45:39] the Queen of Sheba
[45:42] right and she brought a a lot of
[45:47] gold you know sometimes we think about
[45:49] the queen that she brought just a little
[45:51] bag of gold and said here you go Solomon
[45:53] good
[45:54] job
[45:58] no no the Bible says it was a very great
[46:04] train very much
[46:07] gold and precious
[46:10] stones the Bible tells us that it was
[46:13] about 120
[46:16] talents which if you figure it out in
[46:19] today's
[46:24] worth she only brought bought him about
[46:26] $225 Million worth of
[46:32] gold tell your neighbor neighbor
[46:35] 225
[46:38] million that's a lot that's a lot
[46:43] 20 and so David had assembled a lot of
[46:46] gold and
[46:50] silver the Bible says that it was a
[46:52] 100,000 talant of gold
[46:59] that was going to be put into the into
[47:01] the
[47:04] temple would equal about $200 billion
[47:08] dollar worth of
[47:14] gold and a million talents of
[47:18] silver which is almost around 23
[47:24] billion and Al together there was this
[47:27] is not including anything else just the
[47:29] gold and the
[47:33] silver it would have been almost around
[47:37] $225 billion doll worth of silver and
[47:44] gold they said they they estimate King
[47:48] Solomon's value or his worth today his
[47:50] net
[47:54] worth
[47:56] would be about 2.1
[48:02] trillion you talk about being
[48:05] blessed it was a wonderful time for
[48:10] Israel and yet brother brandham preaches
[48:12] the message a greater than Solomon is
[48:18] here I think that that's many times
[48:20] where where we have a
[48:24] disconnect I don't think we understand
[48:26] really really what our value what our
[48:29] worth
[48:31] is and because we don't understand
[48:35] that we we just go along with the
[48:39] flow brother Brown says we live a
[48:41] million miles under our god-given
[48:48] privileges years later as we know the
[48:50] the temple was thrown
[48:54] down children of Israel taken into
[48:59] captivity but when they returned to
[49:02] build the
[49:04] temple and it was
[49:07] finished let's see what
[49:10] happened Hagi the second chapter if you
[49:13] can turn to
[49:18] it pray my my voice will hold up
[49:24] today
[49:37] and let's just read verse three to save
[49:38] some time
[49:45] here they gathered the people together
[49:48] and he asked them a
[49:52] question who was left among you that saw
[49:55] saw the house in her first
[50:02] Glory what a question
[50:04] huh is there anybody here he
[50:08] says that saw this house in its first
[50:13] Glory how do you see it
[50:17] now they had finished this Temple and it
[50:20] was called now zabel's
[50:24] Temple and he said is it not in your
[50:26] eyes in comparison of it as
[50:31] nothing after seeing all the gold and
[50:33] the silver that was put into the first
[50:38] temple how do you compare this next one
[50:41] with that first
[50:44] one and then after saying
[50:48] that hagy gives a seems like an unusual
[50:54] prophecy
[50:57] this is verse
[50:58] n it says the glory of this latter
[51:06] house shall be greater than of the
[51:11] former sayth the Lord of
[51:14] hosts and in this place will I give
[51:18] peace sayth the Lord of
[51:20] hosts as the temple was being
[51:24] rebuilt there was a group of Jews there
[51:27] in
[51:30] Jerusalem who were actually a little bit
[51:34] disappointed these older Jews who could
[51:36] recall the grandure of the first
[51:43] temple they regarded zerob Babel's
[51:46] Temple as a poor substitute of the
[51:54] original and in their minds it did not
[51:57] compare at all with Solomon's
[52:03] Temple it was true that zabel's Temple
[52:06] was built on a smaller
[52:12] scale with much fewer
[52:16] resources than Solomon's Temple had
[52:19] been and also Solomon's Temple had
[52:22] housed the Ark of the Covenant
[52:29] it had they had witnessed Fire come down
[52:32] from
[52:35] heaven it had been filled with a Shina
[52:39] glory and still hegi
[52:43] prophesied that this second
[52:47] temple would one day have a
[52:53] magnificence and it would out shine
[52:56] Solomon's
[53:00] Temple we're we're getting
[53:03] somewhere he says one when this one one
[53:06] of these
[53:07] days it's going to outshine the other
[53:12] Temple I know you saw the gold and you
[53:15] saw the
[53:17] silver but there's something goingon to
[53:20] happen that will make Solomon's
[53:24] Temple
[53:26] seem a little
[53:30] dull his words were fulfilled 500 years
[53:36] later when something
[53:40] happened that did not happen in the
[53:43] first
[53:45] temple he said the glory of the
[53:49] latter would be greater than the glory
[53:51] of the
[53:54] former 500 years
[53:57] later the Messiah Jesus
[54:02] Christ comes walking through the temple
[54:05] of
[54:07] zerubabel it was no longer the walls
[54:10] that was the that was the
[54:13] attraction come on church I'm going to
[54:15] say it again it was no longer the gold
[54:18] and the silver that was the
[54:22] attraction but now God almighty
[54:26] in the beginning was the
[54:30] word the word was with God and the Word
[54:34] was God and the word became
[54:37] flesh and dwelt amongst
[54:40] us and the body of that
[54:43] word came and walked right through the
[54:48] temple okay so now we're getting
[54:51] somewhere you see the first temple and
[54:54] the second temple
[54:57] as great as they
[54:58] were was not the great
[55:02] mystery it was not the great mystery
[55:04] that God had in the back part of his
[55:10] mind this is where many people fail
[55:14] today they look at the message and they
[55:16] said wow what a great
[55:19] message and they're always looking
[55:22] back as what God did back then
[55:26] or they're always looking
[55:28] forward to what God is going to do but
[55:32] very few
[55:34] realize and see what he's doing right
[55:38] now I'm going to tell you right now the
[55:42] glory of what's in this
[55:45] building is even
[55:48] greater than Solomon or zerob Babel's
[55:52] Temple come on do you believe that or
[55:55] not let me see your hands if you believe
[55:58] it there's more Glory going on right
[56:03] now that there ever has
[56:06] been in the history of of
[56:10] mankind because now the
[56:13] bride what had been
[56:16] promised people staying on now listen to
[56:20] this this is where the people go where
[56:22] people will go yeah yeah this
[56:26] they read the
[56:27] message and it's
[56:30] tremendous but there's a
[56:32] point brother Bram says where the
[56:37] attraction goes from the
[56:42] prophet oh come on now I'm going to say
[56:45] it again there's a
[56:48] point at which the
[56:51] attraction goes from the
[56:53] prophet to his prophecy
[56:57] now
[56:59] right uhoh H I'm going to say it again
[57:04] there's a point at which the
[57:07] attraction goes from the
[57:10] prophet to his
[57:12] prophecy in other words what I'm trying
[57:14] to tell
[57:15] you is that every prophecy has to have a
[57:23] face the devil don't care how much
[57:28] message you
[57:29] know he don't care how much scripture
[57:32] you
[57:34] know but you know what he
[57:37] cares he
[57:39] trembles when the scriptures has a
[57:43] [Applause]
[57:46] face I'm going to say it again he
[57:49] trembles when the scriptures get a
[57:53] face
[57:55] he
[57:56] trembles when
[57:58] prophecy has a
[58:00] face now my question to you is
[58:04] this what are you the face
[58:06] [Applause]
[58:09] of oh come on now I'm going to ask you
[58:12] again what are you the face
[58:18] of uh oh I can I can say God bless you
[58:21] and leave the platform right
[58:23] now and you go
[58:26] home
[58:28] wow right you want to paint yourself up
[58:30] real
[58:31] nice well maybe you're the face of Max
[58:36] Factor
[58:38] maxor uh oh they didn't like that one
[58:40] huh wrong
[58:43] exit come on now what are you the face
[58:46] of I'm coming to something here
[58:50] now this is so
[58:53] tremendous when we see see the
[58:56] first God wanted to reveal
[59:00] himself he couldn't do it as all great
[59:05] the Elohim the great Jehovah
[59:09] God who covered all Space and
[59:12] Time and
[59:14] Eternity he could
[59:16] not he was too
[59:20] great to reveal himself to the people
[59:25] it was too
[59:28] mysterious and so what does he
[59:31] do he
[59:32] realizes he needs a
[59:38] face oh come on say again he realizes he
[59:42] needs a
[59:51] face so then if he needed a face
[59:55] he needed a
[59:59] body First Corinthians chapter 6 verse
[1:00:03] 19 and
[1:00:08] 20
[1:00:10] what he needs a face
[1:00:13] what he needs a body
[1:00:16] what what a question what know ye not
[1:00:21] that your body
[1:00:32] this is where we get this is where we
[1:00:34] get caught
[1:00:36] up
[1:00:38] know oh this filthy flesh filthy flesh I
[1:00:42] try to do good and Evil's
[1:00:44] present I can't
[1:00:46] overcome this is no good for
[1:00:49] nothing wait wait a
[1:00:52] minute the Bible says
[1:00:55] says what oh know ye not that your
[1:01:01] body is the Temple of the Holy
[1:01:07] Ghost which is in
[1:01:09] you which ye have of
[1:01:12] God and ye are not your
[1:01:15] own for ye are bought with a
[1:01:19] price therefore glorify God in your just
[1:01:23] your spirit
[1:01:25] glorify God in your
[1:01:28] body and in your
[1:01:31] spirit which are
[1:01:33] Gods what makes this body so
[1:01:37] valuable we know it's not this this 16
[1:01:43] elements what makes it valuable is the
[1:01:45] soul that's on the
[1:01:49] inside you think that Solomon's Temple
[1:01:52] was was valuable
[1:01:56] brother brandham comes and under the
[1:02:01] inspiration he puts a value of your
[1:02:05] soul at 10 million
[1:02:11] worlds oh no come on come on and look at
[1:02:15] your neighbor say
[1:02:16] neighbor you're worth 10 million
[1:02:21] worlds no no you got to you either
[1:02:24] you're going to believe it or you're
[1:02:28] not I'm not trying to go deep I'm trying
[1:02:30] to go very simple for
[1:02:33] you how many temples do we have
[1:02:36] here temples of the Holy
[1:02:40] Ghost time however many times 10 million
[1:02:47] worlds this building what is inside is
[1:02:51] so
[1:02:53] valuable
[1:02:55] you were bought with such a
[1:02:58] price and you've been given such a
[1:03:02] value and yet we sometimes settle for
[1:03:13] nothing and we're sitting here say I'm a
[1:03:18] Christian I don't have no money for my
[1:03:23] rent
[1:03:27] Seed of Abraham
[1:03:31] huh come on you know what I'm talking
[1:03:34] about you can put anything
[1:03:36] there you know what you struggle with
[1:03:39] you know what what you always I don't
[1:03:41] know I don't know about this I don't
[1:03:42] know about
[1:03:44] that am I talking to anybody
[1:03:48] here oh I forgot that I have good
[1:03:53] value Lord
[1:04:00] Brother we have a value of 10 million
[1:04:08] worlds but I can't take a
[1:04:15] withdrawal oh no I might use it all
[1:04:20] up 10 million worlds
[1:04:25] oh you don't sound
[1:04:28] excited you think I'm you think I'm just
[1:04:30] doing a it's a fairy tale or
[1:04:33] what church you are worth
[1:04:36] that
[1:04:38] value you are the Temple of the Holy
[1:04:42] Ghost tell your neighbor again neighbor
[1:04:46] I am the Temple of the Holy
[1:04:53] Ghost
[1:04:54] if you are the Temple of the Holy
[1:04:58] Ghost then the temple now has a
[1:05:07] face hallelujah hallelujah I'm going to
[1:05:11] say it again the temple now has a
[1:05:16] face do you believe that the temple has
[1:05:20] a face
[1:05:22] now we're going to find out what face
[1:05:24] you
[1:05:29] are Genesis 1 1
[1:05:33] and2 I'm just putting a little little
[1:05:37] Foundation brother Titus says we're not
[1:05:39] in a hurry
[1:05:45] [Music]
[1:05:48] today in the beginning God created the
[1:05:51] Heaven and the
[1:05:53] Earth
[1:05:55] and the Earth was without form and void
[1:05:58] and darkness was upon the face of the
[1:06:09] deep you couldn't tell the face it was
[1:06:12] it it was not what is it looks kind of
[1:06:15] through a glass
[1:06:20] Darkly and the spirit of God then moved
[1:06:22] upon the the face of the
[1:06:28] waters now once again the spirit of God
[1:06:33] today is moving upon the face of the
[1:06:35] waters or of the
[1:06:41] people because Darkness has covered the
[1:06:43] Earth
[1:06:45] and gross Darkness has covered the
[1:06:49] people but God needs a a face today
[1:07:01] God needs a
[1:07:04] face he needs
[1:07:09] hands come on
[1:07:13] nowbody up there have any hands he needs
[1:07:17] hands he needs feet he needs
[1:07:22] eyes that's what we want want to find
[1:07:24] out
[1:07:26] today are you part of that
[1:07:30] body are we his
[1:07:37] face are we his
[1:07:42] body brother Braham says he said I am
[1:07:44] the vine and ye are the
[1:07:50] branches now the vine doesn't bear fruit
[1:07:55] the branch bears
[1:07:57] fruit and the only hands he has tonight
[1:08:01] is our
[1:08:05] hands the only eyes he has is is our
[1:08:11] eyes and here's he's here in the form of
[1:08:15] the pillar of
[1:08:18] fire the resurrected
[1:08:22] Christ now to be the face of
[1:08:26] something it it it's a tremendous
[1:08:29] thing to be the face of something is to
[1:08:32] be the
[1:08:36] feature it is the
[1:08:40] embodiment or recognize
[1:08:45] representation of the
[1:08:48] thing all right all right come on now it
[1:08:51] is the
[1:08:52] embodiment in other words it's got to
[1:08:54] come and it's got to dwell inside
[1:08:58] amen now just hold on with me
[1:09:02] okay I should have gone to bed early

[1:15:59] Revelation has a face
[1:16:03] now I'm going to say it again the
[1:16:05] Revelation has a
[1:16:07] face and that's what Sayan
[1:16:12] fears read the
[1:16:15] scriptures yeah search
[1:16:17] them in them you think you have eternal
[1:16:22] life but they are they that testify of
[1:16:26] me what is it because the
[1:16:29] scriptures are waiting for a
[1:16:32] face oh we're going to get to something
[1:16:35] good
[1:16:35] [Applause]
[1:16:38] here it's time to become the
[1:16:43] face of who and what we are
[1:16:48] representing I have a niece that's going
[1:16:50] to college there in in
[1:16:52] Arizona
[1:16:55] she said
[1:16:56] Uncle I walk in there with my dress my
[1:17:01] skirt she says and I dare
[1:17:05] them to ask me why I wear skirts and
[1:17:13] dresses oh come
[1:17:15] on we have it so hard because we got to
[1:17:18] wear dress and
[1:17:21] skirts she said Uncle I dare them to ask
[1:17:26] me all I could do was just
[1:17:31] go that's all I
[1:17:33] need not embarrassed because she knows
[1:17:37] she's the face of
[1:17:40] something she is the face of a
[1:17:44] lady you don't find very many ladies
[1:17:48] anymore who's the face of a
[1:17:52] lady
[1:17:53] who's the face of modesty
[1:17:59] anymore
[1:18:01] Jesus Oh I wanted that to settle really
[1:18:06] good God would walk and talk with Adam
[1:18:12] every single
[1:18:16] day finally an expressed
[1:18:20] son that God could talk face to
[1:18:25] face you see the attributes that were in
[1:18:28] him he couldn't have
[1:18:31] Fellowship until they were
[1:18:35] manifested then he could talk face to
[1:18:38] face watch
[1:18:41] now Adam was the face of a Son of
[1:18:46] God Son of God
[1:18:50] Adam but he also was the face
[1:18:55] of God of this
[1:19:00] earth oh come on now you know what
[1:19:04] happened that face was
[1:19:07] lost but he was the
[1:19:10] face of the God of this
[1:19:13] Earth imagine that how you doing
[1:19:17] father oh we're doing wonderful today
[1:19:19] was a wonderful
[1:19:21] day all
[1:19:24] happened the veil was taken
[1:19:28] away and the face of Adam
[1:19:31] changed and it was no longer someone in
[1:19:36] control it was no longer someone with
[1:19:40] Dominion no it was now a fallen Son of
[1:19:46] God his whole complex his whole his
[1:19:49] whole look
[1:19:51] changed
[1:19:53] and I can see God looking at
[1:19:56] him that's not the face of my
[1:20:00] son that's not the face of the God of
[1:20:03] this
[1:20:04] Earth and that's why he says
[1:20:07] Adam Adam where are you you're lost in
[1:20:11] the
[1:20:12] darkness and the spirit of God moved
[1:20:15] upon the face of the
[1:20:18] deep church that's what we need
[1:20:21] today the spirit of God to move upon the
[1:20:24] face of the
[1:20:27] waters we need faces to be
[1:20:32] restored representatives to be
[1:20:36] restored it's time we stop playing
[1:20:40] church and think it's okay because we
[1:20:43] jumped and
[1:20:45] shouted you can jump and shout and still
[1:20:48] have the same
[1:20:50] face but one time
[1:20:53] that you step into the holy of
[1:20:57] holies and he comes into the
[1:20:59] soul and he changes your
[1:21:02] heart your face

[1:21:12] tell when the when the presence of the
[1:21:15] Lord is moving around the
[1:21:18] building he said you can tell when it
[1:21:20] comes upon
[1:21:21] someone
[1:21:24] he says because their face
[1:21:26] changes something
[1:21:28] different oh I I see faces changing

[2:36:52] remember it is not just a natural
[2:36:57] event it is a supernatural
[2:37:02] event and it's not just a supernatural
[2:37:06] event it is a pronatural
[2:37:09] eventer
[2:37:13] natural is that right
[2:37:17] somebody help me you somebody help him
[2:37:19] prer
[2:37:20] natural people don't know what prer
[2:37:22] natural is
[2:37:24] H I got you
[2:37:28] today this is a natural event first of
[2:37:32] all meaning that it is occurring in the
[2:37:36] natural in the Physical
[2:37:39] Realm and can be witnessed by our
[2:37:41] natural
[2:37:44] senses but but it's also a supernatural
[2:37:48] event meaning there is no
[2:37:52] way that man could have ever
[2:37:55] orchestrated
[2:37:58] this all the events that
[2:38:01] happened for this event to take
[2:38:05] place this is the
[2:38:08] product of the physical and the
[2:38:12] spiritual the than the Earthly and the
[2:38:15] heavenly
[2:38:17] uniting together to make it a
[2:38:20] supernatural
[2:38:23] event but it's also a preternatural
[2:38:28] event meaning that it was marked
[2:38:32] out and
[2:38:34] determined
[2:38:36] beforehand before the before the
[2:38:38] foundation of the world was
[2:38:40] ever now you know preder

[2:40:05] group and then brother brandham

[2:40:12] warning Satan won't let that state that
[2:40:18] way everybody you got
[2:40:20] it you're a sweet
[2:40:23] group but Satan won't let it stay that
[2:40:26] way he'll shoot
[2:40:31] everything if he has to bring in
[2:40:34] someone to make his
[2:40:37] Target he'll bring some
[2:40:40] critic some
[2:40:42] unbeliever he'll sit him down
[2:40:46] cause him to fellowship with you under
[2:40:50] quietness and then he'll shoot that guy
[2:40:53] with some kind of
[2:40:56] poison and he'll start through the
[2:40:58] church with
[2:41:00] it don't you take sides with
[2:41:04] it don't you have nothing to do with
[2:41:07] anything
[2:41:08] else you stay right there loving one
[2:41:13] another but pray for that
[2:41:16] man that he'll be saved
[2:41:19] too or that woman whoever it
[2:41:22] is and stick one with
[2:41:26] another and stay with your
[2:41:32] [Applause]
[2:41:36] pastor ouch
[2:41:41] ouch we are the face of the message
[2:41:44] remember
[2:41:46] stay with your
[2:41:48] pastor he's the
[2:41:51] shepherd and give him
[2:41:55] respects he'll lead you
[2:41:58] through because he's ordained of God to
[2:42:00] do
[2:42:02] so do you remember
[2:42:05] that the enemy will
[2:42:07] come and when he
[2:42:09] does just cling that much closer
[2:42:14] together
[2:42:15] and the ones that the devil's using for
[2:42:18] an
[2:42:20] enemy he'll either get
[2:42:23] out or become one of
[2:42:26] you stay
[2:42:29] together that's one thing that my father
[2:42:31] always told
[2:42:33] us no matter what happens stay
[2:42:37] together you ain't going to make it by
[2:42:40] yourself stay together as you remain
[2:42:44] standing
[2:42:46] I want to just read the scripture here
[2:42:47] in Acts
[2:42:52] 7:44 I'm sorry let's go to verse
[2:42:58] 47 but Solomon built him in
[2:43:02] house how be it the most high dwelleth
[2:43:05] not in temples made with hands as saith
[2:43:08] the
[2:43:13] prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is
[2:43:15] my foottoo
[2:43:20] what house will ye build me sayith the
[2:43:26] Lord what is the place of my
[2:43:31] rest hath not my hand made all these
[2:43:36] things Hebrews
[2:43:39] 10:5 says wherefore when he cometh into
[2:43:42] the world he saith sacrifice and
[2:43:45] offerings thou wouldest not but a body
[2:43:49] hast thou prepared me which verse was
[2:44:03] that I believe brother Titus is a man of
[2:44:07] vision along with the people here have
[2:44:10] received this building this gift from
[2:44:12] the
[2:44:14] Lord
[2:44:16] so that the people can have a place out
[2:44:18] to get out of the rain and the
[2:44:22] snow where they can Worship the
[2:44:25] Lord this is a City of
[2:44:28] Refuge a lith house in a dark
[2:44:32] world where the dying can run
[2:44:36] to and the only way to stay
[2:44:41] successful is to stay with the
[2:44:44] word stay in line with the
[2:44:46] word and although David was not able to
[2:44:49] build the
[2:44:51] temple he gathered all the
[2:44:54] materials that would be needed in order
[2:44:56] for his son Solomon to construct the
[2:45:00] temple and Solomon never varied one
[2:45:06] bit from the pattern of the temple that
[2:45:09] Moses saw in
[2:45:12] heaven what a spiritual application he
[2:45:17] says that we never leave the
[2:45:21] scriptures stay with the
[2:45:24] pattern that's the reason I
[2:45:27] believe the first church was patterned
[2:45:30] after
[2:45:32] it the next one
[2:45:35] patterned every one will be patterned
[2:45:37] the same
[2:45:39] way that's where the spiritual Builders
[2:45:44] today that's why the bride building of
[2:45:49] Christ is not ready for the
[2:45:53] bridegroom because the builders rejected
[2:45:55] the
[2:45:58] Cornerstone the Chief Cornerstone that
[2:46:00] was laid on the day of
[2:46:03] Pentecost which is the baptism of this
[2:46:05] holy
[2:46:07] spirit that is the real church
[2:46:10] now not of mortar not of
[2:46:14] brick
[2:46:15] or stone which
[2:46:17] perisheth but the real church is built
[2:46:20] upon the revelation of the
[2:46:24] word and the will of
[2:46:27] God a great day the day of dedication
[2:46:30] has ared brother
[2:46:33] T and when they were come to dedicate
[2:46:36] the
[2:46:37] building the worshippers
[2:46:41] worshiped the building would have been a
[2:46:44] building in
[2:46:47] vain had it not been for the worshippers
[2:46:49] that came into the

[2:46:58] dedication so now I as we bow our
[2:47:03] heads what a beautiful thing when he
[2:47:05] says the bo but a body hast thou
[2:47:09] prepared showing that God was going to
[2:47:11] dwell in a
[2:47:13] body
[2:47:15] and when this
[2:47:16] body his body of 2,000 years
[2:47:20] ago had been made a
[2:47:23] sacrifice the correct lamb had been
[2:47:28] sacrificed there was coming forth
[2:47:32] then God came to his own
