want to agree to everyone that's online also and uh well before we get any further we'd like to introduce our we have a special guest here brother you all know him and ask brother brother Daniel would you would you just uh tell us a little bit about yourself and and uh whatever the Lord has put on persona I feel like I'm telling a little bit about myself to my family you all are absolutely precious it is we're going to talk about a little bit about um some of the Tate Ministry and and things that have to do with the tapes and um the first memory I have is a child is pulling myself up above a piece of furniture and looking down and seeing the reel-to-real tape goes and and I remembered when when the one side got small yeah that was my favorite part because that was the prayer line is it uh and in growing up we didn't we never went to church until I was about 18 years old and then my uncle Ronnie Evans was healed of cancer Ronnie Evans was another cancer and he gave a testimony at brother Mark condos church and then we started going to church to we we went to hear him speak and then after that we stayed at church and that church was a tape Church there was never a minister that ever spoke and I was there until uh moved to Jeffersonville yeah yesterday and it was in Jeffersonville for 17 years and now I'm back home in Tucson my grandfather many of you know him as Welch Evans um I gave the testimony to some of the youth about um him getting bit by the rattlesnake one of those so many stories that you all know my other grandfather was Carl wheeler who was a deacon of brother Brown's church [Music] so I had both sides of my family were with brother Branham from the early days and recently uh two weeks ago I was elected pastor of the Tucson Tabernacle um well I wanna I wanna tell them what I told you I got to be honest when he texts me I said I don't know whether to congratulate you but better I'll congratulate you because I believe that you're a man of God amen amen thank you for that brother I appreciate that in approaching this subject we approach we approach it with all humility it's not an easy subject many times uh to talk about it because there's there's such a back and forth going on with this uh throughout the whole world there there are many many questions concerning this in the ranks of the message should we then just listen to tapes or should we listen to the ministry and and I want to make this clear to to you that are here those that are on online via internet and those that will hear this later we're not here to try to take sides we're not here to try to pull you to one side or the other no Thomas I believe the prophet made it clear when he preached the message taking sides with Jesus and and and he Jesus is the word and so we understand that there's this big debates that go on we know through the years there are people can come up with a quote with the script but after a while we we come to a realization everything must line up from Genesis to Revelations or something is wrong so you know when when we when we look at this subject we realize this is that amidst it all can you still disagree with someone and still love them I I want to just just reiterate experience I had with the brother that that was trying to tell us that we should become a tape and I can tell you I bitterly disagreed with the brother that's many many times many people cannot do that yeah so when we as we approach this subject and I ask if you would turn your Bibles in your Bible First Corinthians the first chapter and the 12th and the 13th verse now reads like this and we're sorry that that our our overhead projector but that's all right we are not going to be stopped tonight First Corinthians 1 verse 12 and 13 says now this I say that every one of you saith I am of Paul and eye of Apollos and eye of cephas and I of Christ what a tremendous question the next verse is Christ divided we're talking about about the mystical body of the Lord Jesus Christ divided is that what we have come to in the message have we come to well you're on that side of the aisle or you're on that side of the aisle you come to the point really is Christ divided it is Paul crucified for you or were ye baptized in the name of Paul okay and that's the question we're asked today is Christ divided how do you think about that scripture well turn back one page and start with First Corinthians uh with the first verse now remember who's writing this letter this letter is written to a church that's having issues and Paul is going to address these issues in this letter is now remember Paul is a very educated man is a very very good writer as we already know yes and there are certain rules in writing that never change no matter what language that you're in yes if you study writing you know that there are these things called pronouns and pronouns are used to make the writing flow better to sound better yes so we use g in it we use those almost to make the conversation flow better conversation unless we're trying to make a point exception and then we will say the name over and over again to make a very specific point listen to what Paul wrote Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God and sustani is our brother unto the Church of God which is according to them that are Sanctified in Christ Jesus called to be Saints with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord both those and ours is senor Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ I thank my God always on your behalf for the grace of God which is given by given you by Jesus Christ he's making a point declaration that in everything you are in enriched by Him in all utterance and in all knowledge even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you a secret so that ye come behind in no gift waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ who shall also confirm you unto the end that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ God is faithful by whom you were called under Fellowship of his son Jesus Christ Our Lord now I beseech you Brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that ye speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same it had been declared under me of you my brethren by them which are the house of Chloe that there are contentions among you say foreign do you see how brother Paul laid the foundation that it is all about one man it's about Jesus Christ is Jesus Christ and then we mess it up and and we make it about the man right and then brother Caleb just read the scripture that he read and he and he addresses it this is the thing that we want to make sure that we get across we understand and realize there is no eighth messenger thing there's a lot of men that raise up and people raise them up and after a while a man they they they want to they want to put him in place of brother Brown we're here to tell you we believe there was only seven stars and we believe the messenger to our age foreign foreign we do understand that there are people that have been called to give out tracks videos CDs cities etc etc we've also done that but we do believe that God has called us in this day to preach the gospel okay you cannot separate the message from the messenger like you cannot separate and you you elevate the tree as our our pastor was saying a while ago and say what a great tree and deny the fruit or say what grapefruit but deny the tree but I want you to know that the fruit is the product of the tree we're not separate from from from what people think that that we try to separate ourselves all we say is that we are a product of the message was to produce there was no other time outside of this time were the sons of God were to be made and we are manifested Sons and Daughters by the message that brother William Miriam Branham brought to US foreign foreign and the question was how will you unlearn what you have learned think about that I said brother sister whoever wrote the question I'm not going to unlearn anything this this is the same message I was born listening to is I love it as much now as I ever had the difference is that God has called me into to a different office now and that is to preach this gospel yes so that's how I answered that question I know that good with you but yeah you know to to to let people know you know when when people get together to go against something else and their only agenda is the something else it's a false Unity it's not only that we didn't get together to put this table together no foreign and he would put his arm around and we know this about around the methodists and he'd always says they're my brothers you know and it's it's it's such a shame many times that if you don't if you don't if you don't go to church yeah and we flip it to the other side listen to tapes Christ is not divided I'm going to say it again Christ is very important that we that we that we that that should be the basis of everything that we are and all that we do and we know the message as it has come forth brother Henry you know this very well from our founding pastors and he would say if we cannot we we must make the message what it says it will do if everything else they say well brother Branham the messenger one and so the way that they view it brother Brandon passed on that would mean that the message also died also the message and the messenger are one and the same because now watch where that message is this is very important that we understand this is and and there's things that you'll hear over and over again but remember it is going out to different places and I will reiterate through the whole thing I talked to someone that just listens to tape they're my brothers I love them the same I don't look at them any less my brother is and I remember our founding pastors and he he made that that statement if you're called to hand out a track yes and then he says but I was called to preach the gospel I can't do anything else we see so many divisions and let me read to you a couple quotes from the prophet and they might have you raise your eyebrows when I read them we get things in our mind and we think we have an understanding but we have to be open to the word changing our thoughts in 1956 Jehovah Jireh 5604-29 in the ram says he said Margaret now we are not here to argue somebody's theology whether they're Methodist or Baptist Baptist or Presbyterian okay we've all heard that or baptize this way or that way or sprinkles don't pay no attention to that I'm here to say that Christ has risen from the dead that's the main thing is and I hope it's not in vain can I read another one oh read it 53 1018 Elijah Elias brother Brahm says this he said mono Branham you say well the method is sprinkle and we baptize so they says you ready that don't have nothing to do with it this isn't me speaking yeah this is the prophet yes the thing to do brother if in your heart you can't recognize that to be your brother you need a trip to God's altar to get right with them and I look at the prophet said that about the denominations all the way to baptism and how important baptism is to us we have the revelation of the godhead and we know that baptizing in the name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost is not baptizing in a name and yet the prophet himself and we divide ourselves over listening to a tables how far have we slipped back okay brother you go ahead no no that's good you know brother brother calebra you you mentioned it in a in a sermon when they when the when the the one is separated from the Trinity and and in that period and brother Brown says the problem was that they made an issue so once once one one we understand that the truth but but I think that what what we we have maybe not understood okay but in general because we're not non-denominational we are inter-denominational that's what brother Branham tells us because we've made things issues to the point that again authors won't talk to brothers because they've made issues of certain things because they said certain things are true once we make issues of it we make barriers and we can't go back and forth to each other remember that story where there was a brother he had given a a book of brother Branham to a certain man but remember when that man said I don't want this book because when I read it or it calls me a what is it you know what's and the reason I say that is because in the book of Second Kings the second chapter if you can turn to it this is talking about and and we understand the difference through the message of Elisha and Elijah Elijah and then you have Isha Elijah verse 13 he says he took up also the mantle of Elijah is that fell from him and I went back and stood by the bank of Jordan here's Elisha with the mantle of Elijah and it goes on in verse and he smites the waters and says where is the Lord God of Elijah I think about right now the Church of the Living God needs to take that mantle Smite the waters which is death because it's bringing a lot of death the way that people are on earth bring in a lot of death those that even claim the message but it's time that we say where is the god of Elijah where is the god of William Brands this is the point that I want you to get is that the very mental that means Elisha picked up or got from Elijah the very man the word man to there means responsibility responsibility now this is important because because brother Dan if somebody reads the message and they feel inspired to go do a certain things but when I read the message I don't know what it calls you you know but it tells me go and preach the gospel that's what I get out of it so in understanding this then I want to take the responsibility that the message has placed on me every individual individual should read the message and find out what the responsibility the the message the word of God puts on you want to know what what the responsibility responsibility when we see this responsibility you know it comes to this and I said this before foreign it's not how much responsibility we feel responsibility every True Believer every time you read the message of responses but the question now is this how much responsibility are we willing to take on I want the responsibility that's the question and so what do you get out when you read the message what does it do for you what is it prescribe you what passion that's a mystery each one of you must come to that but when we see this to understand the responsibility responsibility you know it it takes us to this because sometimes they they'll they'll use the phrase us tape church not against anyone that has it no Australia but when I look at this and I and I read the conduct order and it lays out the plan for us and it shows that there has to be holy ghost-filled men to fill the offices in the church how can a tape fill in office it shows you the requirements what you must do to be able to fill those different offices but there's got to be a holy ghost-filled people that will take God out of his words and come to their office fill that office Eternal sonship those two words don't go together when our lord Jesus was here he was teaching his disciples disciplos and he went to the place this pool of Bethesda Bethesda and he healed this this man that couldn't get into the water you know the story and he raised the dead he raised Lazarus from the dead he did many mighty Works Jesus did Jesus but there was one issue the people had to get to that man the flesh there was only one they had to get to Jesus and and he had to heal them but then we see in the book of Acts we see when the Holy Spirit came down in that same spirit that was in Christ entered into men okay that they went out and they did the exact same thing that Jesus did Jesus the gay called Beautiful he did Peter and John did this exact same thing that Jesus did Paul raised eunuchs from the dead when he fell from the rafters and died example after example after example of how the disciples did the same thing that Jesus did you see the scripture just got this you see the scripture at the beginning I am a Palace I am of Christ We only listen to Jesus because because in just what he said back there we don't want to listen to his disciples and the disciples were preaching the same thing that Jesus Spirit was upon them and if we deny that as they did here in First Corinthians it divides the body so that same spirit that was on Christ Came Upon most people it means and I want that same relationship that brother Branham had with Jesus Jesus and I want those same gifts to operate in the church that brother Branham showed us for the people's sake so that they may be here so that they may give their hearts you know everybody believes the visions of brother Branham feel it comes the time to do something about it everybody talks about the great visions that he has such wonderful where are you going to find Visions but when brother Branham does this he says now we're going to start off with the early church and just bring it for about five minutes down to what they did and then I can show you the vision that I that just let me interrupt you they're coming into a little bit I just want to make sure that they got this we're gonna go and uh we'll start off with the early church start off with the earlier and uh down to see what they did and then in ton says I can show you it's the early church okay go ahead wow how God works then I can show you the vision sure that I have for the future from the early church from the early church now at the beginning the church was inaugurated at Pentecost and they're the Holy Spirit fell upon them where Jesus had chosen 12. this is his vision or the future and what does he start telling us and there the Holy Spirit fell upon them where Jesus had chosen 12. this is what people is and especially maybe maybe people that claim the message this is the work where they get stuck at this is the vision of the future in the message taking sides with Jesus you know we went to to Norway this last year and and we were privileged by God you plant a church as we did it according to the plan and the offices that that brother Branham speaks one of the brothers says Nobody Does it like that and maybe maybe in the majority of message churches they don't do it that is immaterial from the early church and if people don't do it the way brother Branham laid it out well that's up to them but don't hinder US foreign foreign because when the Revelation that the seventh angel brought and he begins to to tell us about this Throne of God the throne started in heaven they came down to Jesus Christ from Jesus Christ he says now it has come into the heart of man in this this series of the Revelation so plainly you know this is how he sets up the Tabernacle and how there were guards there was three three uh tribes on each side but when he comes and he brings it to the New Testament what is El Toronto is this this is importante why it is so important to follow God's plan the vision that he had for the future the message the vision he had for the future is not future anymore the future is already has become the president now you want to add something there brother back to what I said brother braham's vision of the future brother Brandon brought a message Jesus brought a message and Jesus when the Holy Spirit came into the disciples the same spirit that was on Jesus was on them then and only then was it able to go around the world and know we send tapes around the world brother Branham said that you can't visit every country but you can sense but don't use that quote to say that we shouldn't preach the gospel let me read you a quote by the way what we're talking about today it's not new this question was way back in 1964. in fact it was August the 30th listen to this our question is that we're talking about today is it the tape Ministry is or is it the five-fold ministerial that perfects the bride the Perfection questions and answers brother Adams reading the question he says this is beloved about the scripture of Ephesians 4 11 through 13. [Music] let's see do we all get the perfecting of the Saints through the tapes or should we be here where the gifts of the Spirit are operating in different offices of the church same question and whoever wrote it says our hearts have believed all the word of the Lord Brother Branham tells tells he the names on the on the question and he tells who wrote the question and then he answers so the question is is it the tapes that perfect the bride or is it the five-fold ministry no no foreign thank the Lord he explains a little further they want to come to the church for the perfecting that we get Fellowship one with another here at church but the perfecting comes between us and God the blood of Christ is what perfects Us in the Holy Spirit in that question is [Applause] the other question that it then is asked would the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the Rapture before the Rapture Hunters before the Raptors before before the Rapture brother Brahms just simply says sure that's what's going on right now the bride of Christ certainly it is the message of the hour see the bride of Christ certainly it is the message of the hours the bride of Christ what is the message of the hours the bride of Christ it is the message of the hours the bride of Christ is consist of Apostles prophets prophetas teachers maestros evangelists is that right correct that's the bride of Christ the ministry of the hour the problem is the problem is is where those that believe in a five-fold get off because now they think they don't need no one else and they began to raise each other up and the next thing you know it our ministry in this church is better than the ministry and that church over there we're the only ones that have a fightful Ministries do you go to everybody else's church or what you still body glitter okay do you know what goes on in in in other churches God has been gracious absolutely think that we're the only ones there should always brother Brandon brother Daniel everyone should listen to that message over and over again respects respect us respect the law even if you disagree with him God bless him because he's trying to do something for them this is why it's so hard because there's many people that preach that have no business there are many that try to fill in office in the church do not do not fulfill the requirements that's what gets us in trouble when we get off the word out of the vision this is the vision for the future this is uh what we what we have said yes when we have heard the ministry of the hour it will be so this is what when people might say that Ephesians 4 11 and 12 has Faith that's why we went back to the tape and my our response is this that there are people that men that have failed yes God would even allow a man to fail so you get your eyes off the man and God will allow that as you heard our password but remember that the word of God is eternal and the word of God doesn't failure and so we we understand that the word of God that God has given to us when they say Ephesians this word of God that we preach here in this scriptures is the Eternal Word of God the thoughts of God printed but there are men that have failed say God will even permit that man brother Daniel in our first campaign and and you said me and brother Caleb looked at each other at the same time can can you can can you tell us about that that incident when how many have heard in listening to tapes how many have heard brother Branham say that these tapes are translated and sent around the world you've heard him say that um he spoke as a prophet spoke which means he may be prophesying but speaking he may be speaking in present tense but he's actually prophesying something that will happen years from now Isaiah did that when he said a virgin shall conceive is the city was under attack and he was under siege and he was talking to the king the king says you seek for a signal and Isaiah says behold the Lord will send you a sign so he and it didn't happen for 700 years so we've heard brother Branham say that these tapes are translated into so many different languages and sitting around the world when I worked the voice of God I worked with a man named he just passed away uh brother Jim the tape boy brother Jim what's his last name brother Jim McGuire McGuire brother random called him the tape boy he was the one that was making the tapes while brother Brandon was preaching so I'm listening to these sermons and I'm thinking brother Branham is sending these tapes all over the world and they're being translated and they're going to South Africa and all these other places so I asked for the gym I said how many tapes did you send overseas Ultramar he said I remember sending a package to Germany and I remember sending a few tapes to South Africa Africa I said that's it he says yeah I don't remember sending anymore I said how many were being translated he said oh none of them we never translated anything today oi we are seeing what the prophet spoke come to pass today we are seeing these translations go foreign and brother Brandon's Vision comes to pass the acholi people they think friends they thank the Lord all over the world I've been to many different places let me tell you they love brother branham's message as much as we do yes and we have all had a part including that message and I'm grateful anybody that comes against the Tate Ministry you're coming against something that is dear to my heart I have seen with my own eyes amen why it's very important to find your place in the body another question 1963. should evangelists continue on the field so when we ask when we hear that question well that goes to the Evangelista the Bible says are all Apostles so if you're not called to be an Evangelista he says in this hour of course certainly by all means don't change a thing this is the questions and answers on the sales change a thing Jesus is coming in the morning Preach Today like if it was going to be 10 years from today but live like it's gonna be at this hour it says don't get scrupled up now I think that's our problem today so many of us have gone scrupled up don't look at anyone else because we within our own selves oh yeah well we don't believe in that he said who said we don't believe in that candy okay I believe there is a Ministry it tapes around the world do it with all your heart foreign [Music] no brother Neville another man and many different Brothers but he's saying don't change nothing but if you're doing something wrong or doing evil repentance come back to God and continue on your evangelist Evangelistic Service as you always did and then he says just keep on he says see continue as you are then he says everybody understands everybody understands we are not against anyone else God bless them and I mean that from our hearts as the pastor of this church I want the church to know don't change a thing what our Prophet the example that he left add something there to that or either one of you let me just add a little bit you said don't change a thing to pull the ministry out of the message you have to change what brother Branham says you have to take out things that brother Branham said about preaching the gospels and as we said brother Brown's message is perfect I believe it was exactly what God wanted to say and to take out preaching the gospel you have to take out things that brother Brian brother Brandon brought the message and then he gave it to be preached that's a sore spot let me read your quote this one is uh and this is right before brother Brown passed away 65 11 21 what house will you build me in November to think that only brother Branham could preach the message let me let me tell you what brother Branham says speaking of brother Perry green pastor of the Tucson Tabernacle London but the green preaches the same thing and same message that I believe in hey he is left talking about your church yes sir all right making sure funny you should say that yeah yeah yeah okay go ahead he has left his home he left his people he left his church he left his home he left his people he left his church [Music] he was I believe he was a district superintendent or something one of them organizations and he give the whole thing up you gave the whole thing up when he heard this he left everything that was dear to him also to come to the desert just to support what God is giving to us now now I listen to what the prophet says about a pastor pastor I say I believe it's not only should be in our hearts it should be our duty to back him up everything that we can to attend the services to come here to worship and to make this place a place where God can reveal to us the things that he has for us one of many quotes that brother Branham said that these brothers preached the same message I do muchas why do I have to throw that part out of the message we shouldn't no evidence right you know the Apostle Paul believed in so much what he had instructed the people what God had showed him and he held it to to what he he was had been revealed so much that he even included himself when he made these words or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel and what we have preached let him be a curse there cannot come he cannot come and say one thing and then and and then we say we say something else but we understand through the scripture and through what brother Branham says he says now God fortified his army himself in the form of profits Apostles apostolis teachers maestros pastors pastors what did he do what was God doing listen did you ever what that offices of the church it's God's dress yes inside dress for seeing it before satanas ever gets to it yo to an office holder let me put you on the spot office holders it goes on first apostles they are gods for ordinations by predestination by foreign Cinco who wanted to preach I wasn't there I don't know you know but people sat around everything seemed to be dead I'm gonna say it again until last time somebody arose somebody began to wake up a star exploded and then another star is and the first thing to explode wasn't pastors first thing that explodes and then prophets teachers yeah they it exploded what was it putting forth it was the same he says as in the beginning when the Earth was in chaos it was in the darkness and it began to explode and the sun came out and the moon came out and the stars came out same thing happening in our time can you give one to the Lord Jesus what a tremendous thing I love brother Daniel go ahead and take it you I'm sure you have a lot of things that you can you can yeah friends it makes me so sad Amigos to see the division that comes into the churches to see churches split and divide over these things I do not believe that it pleases the Lord brother um brother Caleb just said he says what was produced from the rocket and we have to look at the fruit of things and when a spirit comes in and it's a divisive spirit I don't believe that it's from God when that Spirit comes in and tries to divide our churches I don't feel that that divisive spirit is from God this is not his way the prophet spoke he said come out of the denomination but then he said don't leave don't leave your church he said he said come out of the denominations that church can't save you he said if you are counting on the church to save you you are lost and it's the same thing for us if we're counting on a a Doctrine to save us is we're going to find it's gonna be a great disappointment at the end we should be together our Lord Jesus Christ was with his disciples coming down from the Last Supper he gets down into the valley right before the Garden of Gethsemane and he prays and he said Lord may they be one as we are good I know the word I study the word every day it's very hard for me to separate the father from the Son and yet he prayed that they would be one as he and the father if we see a division come into the church it can't be right it can't be friends he wants us together United amen let me read a quote here from the prophet and trying to do God a service without it being said foreign we see a lot of people when they when they divide they leave the church and they don't come back people think that I don't even believe in people going to church that's a million miles from the truth we must assemble ourselves together and that much more as we see the day approaching see we must come together in unity if I lived in a city and they had nothing there but a well-some church I don't want to call any name but just any church if they only believed one thing that is that was Jesus that Jesus was divine all the rest of us wrong I'd go to that church if I can't get a whole loaf of bread I'll take a slice I'll go listen Worship the Lord and show him that I'm doing my part I want him to know I'm alive thank you I want everybody to know what side I'm on I assemble with the Christians and their worship and serve the Lord when we don't go to this is me speaking when we don't go to church we may be able to get fed at home by the tapes but it's not all about me it's not all
