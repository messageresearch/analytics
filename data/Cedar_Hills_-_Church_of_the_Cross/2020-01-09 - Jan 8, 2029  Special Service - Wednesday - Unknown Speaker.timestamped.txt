[22:08] just go to the scripture and and you
[22:11] know the Lord has a plan for you you
[22:14] know he has something in store for you
[22:15] so it's in Jeremiah chapter 18 verse 3
[22:20] to 4 and it says then I went down to the
[22:25] potter's house and behold here aw a work
[22:29] on the wheels and the vessel that he
[22:32] made of clay was marred in the hand of
[22:34] the Potter so he was made so he made it
[22:38] again another vessel as seemed good to
[22:42] the Potter to make it again a man god
