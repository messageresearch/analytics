[45:08] then we're going to go to Ephesians
[45:11] chapter four
[45:13] two scriptures are identified
[45:16] even with the same
[45:28] and the seventh age
[46:03] 47 who are thou o gray Mountain before
[46:06] the rubber bed thou shall become a plane
[46:10] and he shall bring forth The Headstone
[46:13] thereof with shoutings Brian Grace Grace
[46:15] unto it
[46:21] was good Ephesians 4 7.
[46:25] very use scripture in the pulpits
[46:28] foreign
[46:32] the Lord says in that word in his word
[46:41] visions
[46:53] according to every one of us is giving
[46:55] Grace according to the measure of the
[46:57] gift of Christ
[47:08] that's our desire this morning
[47:13] Uno
[47:35] those that were assigned to foreign
[48:15] it was given Grace
[48:20] [Music]
[48:25] they live in disgrace
[48:29] yeah what portion of Grace was assigned
[48:33] to them
[48:36] ladies and Senor the Lord says
[48:41] according to the measure of the gift of
[48:43] God
[48:45] here's what we read that the gift of
[48:47] where manifestado was manifested in his
[48:51] third office
[48:56] form of the Holy Spirit do you say it's
[48:59] a spirit God is a spirit
[49:02] for God to be able to speak to us
[49:15] because the word comes to a prophet
[49:17] for he is the
[49:24] Holy Spirit and the William Brothers
[49:32] where he only has one Brides
[49:35] that is I
[49:43] to what Grace were you assigned to
[49:47] why
[49:48] not
[49:50] many believe in the father
[49:52] so others believe in the song
[49:55] in the Holy Spirit
[50:01] the grace upon Grace house
[50:10] the building Don de dios where God
[50:14] was going to Crown his body
[50:17] what's going to be in the United States
[50:19] of America it is
[50:26] in the dollars
[50:32] and we don't even know who we are
[50:51] became the most hated nation in the
[50:54] world
[50:56] America and even like that everybody
[50:58] wants to come to America
[51:00] where there's hate
[51:02] but it's not for them because they know
[51:07] the crown of the pyramid is here
[51:13] they knows more about God he'll really
[51:15] hears than a religious Now read the
[51:18] Bible every day
[51:24] foreign
[52:16] there's no Grace upon Grace
[52:32] where God has called you
[52:36] Wednesdays
[52:48] and even Grace reached them there
[52:51] has to be Grace Sovereign
[53:21] and for me
[53:32] you want to find yourself there or
[53:34] outside of it
[53:37] says
[53:39] if you don't see your image
[53:43] you're not going to go the place that
[53:45] you read it
[53:47] you have to be identified
[53:49] as Isaiah 53
[53:53] Los prophetas
[53:56] de la Gracia destinada
[54:03] which the prophets have inquired and
[54:06] searched diligently who preach of the
[54:08] great state unto you
[54:10] so Grace is not loose it has a
[54:12] destination
[54:19] if they ask where's brother calebel he's
[54:22] in Phoenix
[54:23] well what's the route for that
[54:26] destination LDS
[54:28] Highway
[54:30] I'm gonna go through I'm going to take
[54:33] the 10.
[54:34] if I want to go to work
[54:38] if you don't recognize your place
[54:40] you're not going to find your
[54:43] destination
[54:49] come to Sunday school
[54:53] is to look at the Players
[54:55] see how much is written about you
[54:58] because a Blackboard is foreign
[55:16] so the need to come to service
[55:26] prophesy of the grace that should come
[55:29] unto us
[55:31] this was not for the prophetamines
[55:38] because I already have her believe it
[55:45] foreign
[56:06] diligently
[56:13] your
[57:08] Eternal destination
[57:43] because maybe your faith is as crooked
[57:46] as the store
[57:53] here
[58:01] this is not my thinking this is
[58:04] the prophet laid it out
[58:07] he is The Interpreter of the word
[58:11] interest
[58:17] searching what
[58:22] the first thing you need to know is
[58:24] where this message came from foreign
[58:37] upon Grace
[58:45] is
[58:51] searching what what manner of time the
[58:54] spirit of Christ
[58:56] was
[58:57] which was in them did signify
[59:01] the scripture says
[59:08] captivity captive is
[59:11] gifts and Men
[59:17] as those of William
[59:52] of your salvation
[1:00:37] the Lord
[1:01:01] or you don't believe
[1:01:06] his presence in human flesh
[1:01:12] respect
[1:01:29] [Music]
[1:01:37] foreign
[1:01:55] [Music]
[1:01:57] with dignity
[1:01:59] [Applause]
[1:02:08] the identification stores
[1:02:22] to give you the Holy Spirit
[1:02:24] the tears of repentance
[1:02:42] but you didn't repent it
[1:02:47] is
[1:02:50] we got 48 years uh seen and hearing this
[1:02:55] again
[1:03:03] everyone
[1:03:19] and contagious
[1:03:24] does not receive the Holy Spirit just
[1:03:26] become a member in sin in the in the pew
[1:03:33] because the Holy Spirit should go with
[1:03:36] us everywhere
[1:03:42] you know when the Holy Spirit leaves you
[1:03:44] when you go to the wrong place
[1:03:53] and he starts again
[1:03:56] to do the first words
[1:04:04] discipline
[1:04:07] is
[1:04:16] we testify beforehand the sovereign
[1:04:32] foreign
[1:04:48] that's the job of a pastor
[1:04:52] is
[1:04:54] to bring to the people the knowledge and
[1:04:56] the revelation
[1:04:58] of who is the Holy Spirit
[1:05:09] but the Holy Spirit came in
[1:05:11] that's what William brand
[1:05:15] ministers and pastors and so forth
[1:05:19] you have the Holy Spirit
[1:05:22] to deliver it to the people
[1:05:25] and to maintain yourself
[1:05:29] that is ordained
[1:05:33] of the Bride
[1:05:36] that is
[1:05:44] but search for the bride
[1:05:48] because it's time of the of the a
[1:05:51] wedding of the Lamb
[1:05:54] so we have to search and dress the bride
[1:05:58] yes
[1:06:02] so to find one bride you have to bring a
[1:06:05] hunter is
[1:06:07] and you know God Only God knows who of
[1:06:10] the 100 is the one fantastic in fact
[1:06:13] oh it's easy to distinguish
[1:06:18] the person that is born again
[1:06:22] the one that claims to have been born
[1:06:24] again
[1:06:26] the one that says that has it all is
[1:06:29] lacking all
[1:06:35] hello
[1:06:40] this is the Lord
[1:06:41] unto whom it was revealed
[1:06:50] Administration
[1:07:01] they're not unto themselves but unto us
[1:07:03] they administer the things that are now
[1:07:05] reported unto you by them that have
[1:07:06] preached the gospel unto you with the
[1:07:08] Holy Ghost sent down from him
[1:07:12] foreign
[1:07:25] because Christ means the anointed man
[1:07:29] Christina
[1:07:35] Christ and Christine and Christina's
[1:07:43] aura
[1:07:47] and to know that this doesn't come by
[1:07:49] foreign
[1:08:09] important to you by them that preach the
[1:08:11] gospel unto you by the holy ghosts
[1:08:17] who's the one that brings the right
[1:08:19] announcement to you
[1:08:22] the dreams
[1:08:26] that brings to you the announcement of
[1:08:29] the Holy Spirit by the scriptures
[1:08:38] many are like like doing like poetry
[1:08:40] they just recite things people that
[1:08:43] memorize the Bible
[1:08:45] but they don't know what the church is
[1:08:54] Sent From Heaven Sent down from heaven
[1:09:00] so the Holy Spirit has to be sent
[1:09:03] who does he send it to um
[1:09:11] with the same responsibility
[1:09:14] and to say that saith the Lord
[1:09:21] you stay God Prophet Ministry you
[1:09:27] I feel like
[1:09:30] yo to it that's how the the verb it is
[1:09:33] is brought down
[1:09:36] personal pronouns
[1:09:39] otos
[1:09:41] Us
[1:09:44] and Them like those that are in Colombia
[1:09:47] like so the verb
[1:09:51] he comes down
[1:09:54] the Tower
[1:09:58] and the place where the Holy Spirit has
[1:10:00] been known
[1:10:04] what what is the Holy Ghost
[1:10:08] he said he is the word today
[1:10:14] foreign
[1:11:07] you as head of the household
[1:11:12] ERS
[1:11:18] you want to see the Holy Spirit come
[1:11:20] back to your home
[1:11:23] restore your family altar
[1:11:41] but what about the altar
[1:11:46] dios primero Sorry God first above
[1:11:50] course all things
[1:11:54] they asked me to preach
[1:11:56] forgive me
[1:11:58] but this is what God says
[1:12:03] your pastor
[1:12:06] why
[1:12:08] look at my mom
[1:12:10] what I like
[1:12:12] about this is that this is
[1:12:16] that the angels can do nothing being in
[1:12:19] heaven
[1:12:24] the Bible itself
[1:12:29] Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which
[1:12:31] thinks these things that the Angels
[1:12:33] desire to look
[1:12:36] and we reject we see it so normal
[1:12:42] oh I read it I believe
[1:12:44] oh it speaks
[1:12:47] until Christ lives
[1:12:56] but to have him it's life
[1:13:10] I didn't know that understand it had
[1:13:12] loins
[1:13:25] reproduces children
[1:13:41] our bodies we have loins outside and
[1:13:44] inside
[1:13:58] the loins
[1:14:47] running back
[1:14:56] because I want to go to this Starbucks
[1:15:06] coffee would you at home with your
[1:15:08] family
[1:15:09] and a prayer of Thanksgiving familiar
[1:15:13] that in the family
[1:15:15] but the holy spirit will visit us
[1:15:59] you could be a help to others
[1:16:16] God gave you a name
[1:16:18] is
[1:16:22] cat and that's how he remains
[1:16:27] because he never asked the Lord
[1:16:33] how many know that the the parents of
[1:16:36] Jesus in flesh know his name is
[1:16:41] Jesus and because the angel came and
[1:16:43] told him and you call him
[1:16:46] but now you look up names
[1:16:52] the ones that will dress this way
[1:16:54] name sounds good
[1:16:58] and you don't know that that name I mean
[1:17:00] dog or cat or something
[1:17:02] and then you wonder why my son is
[1:17:05] because he has and the nature of a dog
[1:17:08] because of his name
[1:17:10] because we are what our names are called
[1:17:13] for
[1:17:39] foreign
[1:18:08] and wait
[1:18:11] try
[1:18:13] one though
[1:18:16] but the grace that is to be brought unto
[1:18:19] you at the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:18:23] are you going to receive him
[1:18:27] that is
[1:18:28] the one who's gonna meet us in the air
[1:18:31] yeah
[1:18:32] if we don't dwell in your heart
[1:18:38] comes for his own
[1:18:40] he could put little christs
[1:19:43] the inspire
[1:20:01] [Music]
[1:20:03] a sermon
[1:20:07] Italian
[1:20:08] Philippines
[1:20:10] Philippians 1 7.
[1:20:12] I have enough for the rest of the year
[1:20:15] here
[1:20:18] this is the one that has a block of
[1:20:20] cheese you save it through the years
[1:20:23] it's so good I just want it all to
[1:20:25] myself
[1:20:28] one seven
[1:20:30] come on
[1:20:35] even as it is meat for me to think this
[1:20:37] is
[1:20:40] speaking of the messenger Paul
[1:20:44] no one will enter Heaven with this
[1:20:46] message
[1:20:48] if you don't enter through the message
[1:20:50] to Paul there's no entrepreneurs you
[1:20:52] don't enter with the message of William
[1:20:54] Brennan
[1:20:55] well through the message of Paul
[1:20:58] because if those that Paul went in
[1:21:01] mind
[1:21:05] word by word of what Paul said
[1:21:10] Glory
[1:21:19] because I have you in my heart in as
[1:21:21] much as both in my bonds
[1:21:28] and in the defense and confirmation of
[1:21:31] the Gospel
[1:21:37] all are partakers of my grace
[1:21:43] so who are we partakers from William
[1:21:45] with William Brennan or with Paul
[1:22:08] body of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:22:11] William Branham told us
[1:22:15] if those of Paul went in and foreign
[1:22:23] generation
[1:22:37] William Brothers
[1:22:50] amen
[1:22:53] so we have to enter to the word grace
[1:22:59] foreign
[1:23:13] language
[1:23:41] or Latino the Latin
[1:23:45] Gracia Gracia que significa
[1:23:49] benevolencia grazia
[1:23:51] que significa benevolence it means uh
[1:23:55] honoring benevolence favor
[1:23:59] or beneficial or benefit
[1:24:02] s
[1:24:05] we as Latin Americans or Latins we
[1:24:08] didn't have a physical Prophet um
[1:24:13] we had tape Libre and we had books
[1:24:21] when he fell in our hands his word
[1:24:27] he made us accepted
[1:24:29] and today by Grace we come here to
[1:24:34] believe
[1:24:35] what do you have believed
[1:24:41] it means benevolence
[1:24:44] all benefits for benefits the film
[1:24:49] beneficiaries
[1:24:51] and you made the effort to go to South
[1:24:54] America
[1:24:57] among them my prince
[1:25:03] one of the first ones
[1:25:11] there was a rumor in Venezuela there was
[1:25:13] a message there was a prophet
[1:25:15] but they never presented them
[1:25:21] they will speak more of a brother
[1:25:25] so we never knew who was the prophet
[1:25:29] I went to a meeting
[1:25:34] I said well the prophet says this this
[1:25:36] and that
[1:25:39] and they said well brother brothers he
[1:25:42] made a mistake
[1:25:48] my thought was if I was going to be
[1:25:50] following somebody that made a mistake
[1:25:51] so where do I start
[1:25:53] Ed I said well you follow the brothers
[1:25:56] then I'll follow William Branham and we
[1:26:00] split I say yeah and we never saw each
[1:26:04] other again
[1:26:07] we'll see each other in the white Throne
[1:26:10] because I don't know if I'll ever see
[1:26:11] you again
[1:26:13] no Grace
[1:26:48] how much is it going to be
[1:27:04] a need
[1:27:07] is
[1:27:08] the gift of God
[1:27:11] grace is the gift of God
[1:27:18] they will Elevate you to the
[1:27:20] supernatural
[1:27:42] because the mirror will inflate you
[1:27:47] make you look like the handsome
[1:27:53] and then that song that says a beautiful
[1:27:56] girl how I love it
[1:27:58] I said wait 30 years and look again
[1:28:03] and then she'll skirt herself and say
[1:28:05] well that wasn't me
[1:28:28] and partaker of his life
[1:28:51] because of his Amazing Grace
[1:29:07] of how to work with his people
[1:29:13] that's why a religious person
[1:29:17] and they see us as weird people
[1:29:21] you said well God is a man
[1:29:27] no the Bible says God is a man
[1:29:32] across
[1:30:02] your effect God was as a man in every
[1:30:06] sense of the word
[1:30:10] foreign
[1:31:21] as he describes himself here
[1:31:32] there was nothing that would stop him
[1:31:38] Saint John 14 16.
[1:31:49] I like to go slow
[1:31:51] for two reasons
[1:31:55] the doctor said if you go fast
[1:32:00] move then you know if you don't walk
[1:32:02] then you're not moving
[1:32:10] 14.
[1:32:21] so you had a time time I haven't
[1:32:23] preached so you're kind of forgetting
[1:32:24] where things are here it may
[1:32:27] um
[1:32:33] says when I was a young man I knew the
[1:32:36] the Bible
[1:32:38] now that I'm getting older
[1:32:41] I have to use my nose
[1:32:44] and then to think where I remember where
[1:32:47] I left him so I could bring him
[1:32:49] foreign
[1:33:00] even the spirit of Truth
[1:33:04] so the spirit truth
[1:33:08] is
[1:33:17] to all truth
[1:33:20] the Lord says
[1:33:26] even the spirit of Truth whom the world
[1:33:29] because
[1:33:48] two different things
[1:33:54] with them
[1:33:56] but this message is not in them
[1:34:35] we know that this was in the time of
[1:34:37] preparation
[1:34:38] of the restoration of the Temple
[1:34:44] time such as this day
[1:34:46] this message
[1:34:50] of a perfect man
[1:34:53] is
[1:34:59] a great Prince within his people
[1:35:05] who have placed the foundation of the
[1:35:07] building
[1:35:14] that's where he put the Perfection yeah
[1:35:19] and in that we are trusted
[1:35:25] the Perfection of the word of God
