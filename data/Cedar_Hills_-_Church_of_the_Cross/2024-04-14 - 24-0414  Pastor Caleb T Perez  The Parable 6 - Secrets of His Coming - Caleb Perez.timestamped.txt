[1:06:59] primera parte que ya hemos

[1:07:05] y luego miraremos donde el Señor nos
[1:07:11] guía este será el número se de la
[1:07:17] parábola quiero
[1:07:30] secos de su
[1:07:35] venida hace años el Señor me hizo una
[1:07:40] pregunta puedes mantener un
[1:07:45] secreto mi respuesta inmediatamente

[1:08:28] no voy a tirar mi tiempo
[1:08:30] eno pero hablemos de cosas que
[1:08:34] importan los secretos de su
[1:08:42] venida
[1:08:48] agua
[1:08:54] 1so
[1:09:08] thank Entonces llegándose los discípulos
[1:09:10] le dijeron por qué le hablas por
[1:09:16] parábolas y respondiéndole les dijo
[1:09:19] porque a vosotros es
[1:09:21] concedido leáo nuevamente
[1:09:25] tiene usted que poner su nombre
[1:09:28] ahí porque es es dado a
[1:09:35] juliá porque es dado a
[1:09:40] Julián conocer los misterios del reino

[1:09:44] cielos má a ellos no es
[1:09:48] concebido una vez más
[1:09:55] me es dado a mí saber y conocer el
[1:09:57] misterio los reinos reinos los
[1:10:03] cielos vamos a voltear a Marcos
[1:10:14] 4:33 si lo tienen Pueden decir amén
[1:10:25] y con muchas tales parábolas les hablaba
[1:10:28] la palabra conforme a lo que podían
[1:10:34] oír y sin parábola no les
[1:10:40] hablaba más discípulos en particular
[1:10:43] declaraba
[1:10:46] todo que el señor añ la bendición su
[1:10:48] palabra pueden tomar asiento
[1:10:58] la palabra
[1:11:01] parábola viene la palabra
[1:11:07] parole simplemente significa una
[1:11:09] historia
[1:11:11] terrenal con un significado
[1:11:17] celestial Esta es la base quiero
[1:11:19] asegurarme que tod reciban
[1:11:22] esto una vez más y quiero que lo rep
[1:11:26] una
[1:11:28] parábola es una historia
[1:11:33] terrenal con un significado
[1:11:35] celestial Ahora dígale a su vecino
[1:11:38] vecino una
[1:11:40] parábola es una historia
[1:11:44] terrenal con un significado
[1:11:47] Celestial Ya lo
[1:11:52] tenemos es la manera como la mayoría de
[1:11:54] gente aprende
[1:11:57] rápido pero también
[1:12:00] significa quitar una cosa tomar una cosa
[1:12:03] y luego tomar
[1:12:05] otra y
[1:12:11] compararlas en otras palabras usted no
[1:12:13] puede tomar una manzana y una
[1:12:15] naranja usted se puede dar cuenta
[1:12:17] inmediatamente que son
[1:12:18] diferentes pero es comparar
[1:12:21] algo como mi mano izquierda con mi mano
[1:12:24] derecha
[1:12:27] son Exactamente igual la una a la
[1:12:31] otra digo eso por una razón y lo van a
[1:12:35] entender mire alrededor y mire a su
[1:12:37] vecino mire otro
[1:12:42] lado y cada uno de ustedes tiene una
[1:12:45] historia Terrenal
[1:12:57] cuando miramos en el
[1:13:00] mund
[1:13:02] vamos una historia que
[1:13:05] contar si usted supiera lo que me
[1:13:09] pasó Oh Dj contar lo quece
[1:13:13] este todos tienen una historia para
[1:13:19] contar pero no toda historia
[1:13:28] correcto muchas
[1:13:32] historias pero no todas las historias
[1:13:34] tienen un significado
[1:13:36] celestial Cuál es el propósito de la
[1:13:42] palabra la Biblia dice que Jesús no
[1:13:44] hablaba sin
[1:13:46] parábola cada vez que Jesús
[1:13:50] hablaba decía el reino de los cielos es
[1:13:52] semejante a
[1:13:55] no decía el reino de
[1:13:58] Dios daba historia tras historia tras
[1:14:03] historia pero el significado celestial
[1:14:05] de esa
[1:14:08] historia era la que la gente no podía
[1:14:13] captar Escuchaban el la historia del
[1:14:18] Sembrador y el que vendió todo para
[1:14:21] comprar la
[1:14:22] tierra La perla de Gran precio
[1:14:28] yb vamos de acuerdo de la viña y las
[1:14:31] ovejas y todo
[1:14:35] esto había un significado celestial para
[1:14:38] cada una de esas
[1:14:41] historias y el propósito era traer las
[1:14:44] cosas
[1:14:46] espirituales traerlas juntas con las
[1:14:48] cosas
[1:14:50] naturales y eso es lo que creaba una
[1:14:53] parábola
[1:14:55] todo el propósito
[1:14:57] detrás era tomar la parte
[1:15:01] natural para entender que había una
[1:15:03] parte
[1:15:06] espiritual y es lo que escuchamos hace
[1:15:08] un rato lo
[1:15:10] sobrenatural usted tiene O sea ya sea
[1:15:12] natural o
[1:15:14] espiritual pero cuando usted lo
[1:15:17] junta se llama lo
[1:15:20] sobrenatural están conmigo todos
[1:15:27] Enton vamos a pasar la
[1:15:30] lista de Cuántas Biblias hay de las que
[1:15:33] el hermano bram
[1:15:36] habla algunos dicen tres otros
[1:15:40] cuatos ya estamos divididos y apenas
[1:15:43] estamos
[1:15:46] comenzando vale que llame a un amigo o
[1:15:50] algo Cuántos creen que hay cuatro
[1:15:52] Biblias
[1:15:56] Cuántos creen que hay tres
[1:16:00] Biblias ahora los que dijeron tres ya no
[1:16:03] quieren
[1:16:07] contestar inteligente mejor que
[1:16:11] no entendemos que hay cuatro
[1:16:16] bibl ayú a recordar Cuáles son
[1:16:20] estas la primera Biblia cómo se llama
[1:16:26] zodia
[1:16:28] cor escribió la Biblia en los cielos
[1:16:31] cor están conmigo
[1:16:36] todos luego la segunda Biblia dijo que
[1:16:40] era las
[1:16:43] pirámides ahora si usted toma la función
[1:16:46] de las pirámides y la manera como fueron
[1:16:49] construidas aquí está la
[1:16:52] parábola usted podía ponerla
[1:16:55] cara con el
[1:16:57] Zodiaco Y decía la misma
[1:17:03] cosa Ahora la tercera Biblia Qué
[1:17:09] es palabra escrita la santa
[1:17:13] Biblia ahora si toma la santa
[1:17:17] Biblia y la la pone junto a la
[1:17:20] pirámide y junto al zodiaco o la
[1:17:22] constelación
[1:17:25] va a decir la misma
[1:17:26] cosa Sí o
[1:17:29] sí Ahora llegamos a la cuarta
[1:17:32] Biblia y la cuarta Biblia
[1:17:37] es Me gusta
[1:17:41] esto la cuarta Biblia usted de apuntarse
[1:17:43] s
[1:17:44] mismo hermano br dice que de todas las
[1:17:49] Biblias hay mucha gente que la única
[1:17:52] Biblia que van a leer alguna vez es
[1:17:55] usted y yo es la única
[1:17:58] [Aplausos]
[1:17:59] Biblia él aún llama la
[1:18:02] madre El quinto
[1:18:05] evangelio así lo
[1:18:10] llama porque es la primera que empieza a
[1:18:12] tomar a sus hijos y
[1:18:16] enseñarles entonces cuando nuestras
[1:18:19] vidas se ponen cara a cara a lado lado
[1:18:23] con la santa Biblia con las Pires con el
[1:18:27] Zodiaco nuestra nuestra viv nuestra
[1:18:31] nuestra vida debería decir la misma
[1:18:35] cosa si no dice la misma cosa algo no
[1:18:38] está escrito
[1:18:39] bien están conmigo
[1:18:42] todos siento que está hablando bien va a
[1:18:46] ser
[1:18:47] bueno voy a hacerles una
[1:18:50] pregunta porque la manera como pensamos
[1:18:53] muchas veces
[1:18:57] somos influenciados en nuestras vidas
[1:18:58] por tantas
[1:19:02] cosas aún así deberíamos solamente ser
[1:19:05] influenciados por algunas
[1:19:07] cosas parece que usted envía a los hijos
[1:19:10] a la
[1:19:13] escuela y regresan y son una persona
[1:19:16] diferente a lo que fueron en la
[1:19:18] escuela De dónde sacaste
[1:19:20] eso de dónde salió ese espíritu
[1:19:26] y luego Usted tiene que tratar con eso
[1:19:28] tiene que volverlos a mandar escuela
[1:19:30] estoy entrando aquí
[1:19:32] algo Porque queremos poder decir
[1:19:37] esto
[1:19:44] mi una Biblia
[1:19:47] [Aplausos]
[1:19:50] caminante quiero mostrar algo aquí bien
[1:19:56] la
[1:19:58] comparación cuando yo me paro y veo esta
[1:20:04] Biblia y tantas cosas y me encuentro
[1:20:07] falto de muchas
[1:20:12] cosas queremos podernos ver en el
[1:20:16] espejo y la misma manera como Cristo nos
[1:20:19] Mira a
[1:20:21] nosotros él quiere poder ver su
[1:20:23] reflexión en usted
[1:20:26] Cuando miro a través de las
[1:20:30] escrituras tengo que compararme justo
[1:20:32] con las
[1:20:34] escrituras porque quiero
[1:20:36] ver si esto es
[1:20:42] eso
[1:20:45] her es esto eso o
[1:20:50] no un
[1:20:57] [Aplausos]
[1:20:59] dijo que el señor derramar su espíritu
[1:21:01] sobre toda
[1:21:06] carne finalmente días después alguien se
[1:21:09] paró y fue
[1:21:11] lleno dijo Esto es
[1:21:15] aquello queremos poder hacer la misma
[1:21:18] cosa porque hay tantas
[1:21:23] escrituras que la Biblia habla acerca
[1:21:25] del
[1:21:26] tiempo y quiero poder decir esto es
[1:21:31] eso están
[1:21:33] conmigo Eso es lo que estamos buscando
[1:21:40] hoy tenemos que poder tirar arrojar
[1:21:43] ideas que levantamos muchas
[1:21:45] [Aplausos]
[1:21:48] veces y tenemos que tirar muchas cosas
[1:21:51] de lo que pensamos
[1:21:55] el mundo no basa ningunas sus ideas en
[1:21:59] nada escuchan una buena idea y Oh yo
[1:22:02] pienso que es
[1:22:04] así pero después de un rato usted se da
[1:22:07] cuenta que esas ideas no llevan ninguna
[1:22:08] parte Pero déjeme hacerle una
[1:22:14] pregunta cuántos perfectos hay
[1:22:23] aquí decirles
[1:22:29] algo siempre recibo la misma
[1:22:32] respuesta es
[1:22:34] cierto estamos estamos en Polonia la
[1:22:38] misma algunos poquitos
[1:22:42] dijeron y otros dijeron que sí porque ya
[1:22:45] saben para dónde
[1:22:47] voy usted encuentra Exactamente lo
[1:22:51] mismo como como
[1:22:55] venado
[1:23:02] relado porque lo primero que pensamos es
[1:23:04] nuestra historia
[1:23:08] Terrenal ustedes saben que les est
[1:23:10] diciendo la verdad decimos estas
[1:23:14] cosas y la primera cosa que pensamos Oh
[1:23:17] la embarré el otro
[1:23:21] día pero cómo hacemos que los hijos de
[1:23:23] Dios
[1:23:26] Cómo logramos que ellos cambien esa
[1:23:29] mentalidad para eso es que estamos aquí
[1:23:31] en esta
[1:23:33] mañana quitemos tiremos las ideas que no
[1:23:36] importan y empecemos a
[1:23:39] comparar Esa es la verdadera
[1:23:42] parábola cuando puedo comparar mi vida
[1:23:45] con las
[1:23:46] escrituras cuando puedo tomar las
[1:23:49] escrituras Y compararlo con los
[1:23:52] cielos comparar
[1:23:56] Oh entonces ahora voy a llegar aú
[1:23:58] lugar emos algunas cosas a la
[1:24:02] borda si no
[1:24:07] entendemos es la parte Terrenal que es
[1:24:10] la que no nos
[1:24:13] agarra porque batallamos cada
[1:24:17] día la llama una una naturaleza que
[1:24:21] batalla y esa es la razón
[1:24:26] que no podemos alcanzar esa
[1:24:29] perfección en un mundo
[1:24:33] imperfecto estamos viviendo en un mundo
[1:24:37] imperfecto tratando de entender la
[1:24:43] perfección escuchamos la respuesta todo
[1:24:45] el
[1:24:47] tiempo no importa si Ed está iglesia
[1:24:49] mund
[1:24:55] respuesta que es dada por el
[1:24:58] mundo la gente del
[1:25:02] mundo vergüenza a nosotros también es la
[1:25:05] misma respuesta por nosotros
[1:25:08] mismos porque esta
[1:25:12] respuesta la usamos solamente para
[1:25:14] justificarnos a nosotros
[1:25:16] mismos Dios no necesita esto para
[1:25:19] justif él nos dio su palabra
[1:25:24] la más grande respuesta es
[1:25:27] qué nadie es
[1:25:30] perfecto usted hace un equívoco con que
[1:25:33] se
[1:25:34] cubre nadie es
[1:25:36] perfecto o todos hacen
[1:25:41] equívocos pero si usted está basando su
[1:25:44] perfección en
[1:25:45] eso usted le ha errado a la
[1:25:50] parábola Esta es toda la
[1:25:53] historia bibl la
[1:25:55] tiene de quién es esta
[1:26:00] historia est la historia de Dios
[1:26:03] revelándose sí mismo a
[1:26:06] Cristo manifestándose a sí mismo a
[1:26:08] través de su
[1:26:09] pueblo Entonces de quién es esta
[1:26:12] historia Esta es mi
[1:26:15] historia Por qué no no encajan nuestras
[1:26:21] historias estoy hablándole a alguien
[1:26:23] aquí
[1:26:26] esta historia
[1:26:27] encaja dijo el hermano
[1:26:30] bram encuéntrese usted en las
[1:26:35] escrituras si usted puede encontrar el
[1:26:37] carácter en
[1:26:39] escrituras entonces usted debe
[1:26:41] identificarse
[1:26:43] con solamente Mira el
[1:26:47] resultado Y usted va a saber cuál es su
[1:26:49] resultado
[1:26:55] estamos en la misma página
[1:26:57] ahora
[1:27:01] continuemos si estamos tratando de ser
[1:27:03] perfectos por nosotros
[1:27:05] mismos usted está correcto no somos
[1:27:10] perfectos pero si sabemos si conocemos
[1:27:12] que tenemos un sacrificio
[1:27:15] perfecto somos hechos perfectos por
[1:27:17] causa ese
[1:27:19] sacrificio entonces mientras sale la
[1:27:22] palabra
[1:27:28] cuando esa interpretación Perfecta de la
[1:27:31] palabra es dada a su
[1:27:36] conciencia ahora tenemos la perfecta
[1:27:38] interpretación de la palabra Dios envió
[1:27:41] su profeta y todos decimos Amén bien hay
[1:27:46] perfección es es una palabra
[1:27:50] perfecta alguien que me trata de decir
[1:27:52] que hay errores en el mensaje
[1:27:55] vaya y árele a otro árbol es
[1:27:58] perfecta pero el problema
[1:28:00] es no entienden la
[1:28:05] parábola observen nuestras vidas
[1:28:08] nuestras vidas
[1:28:10] naturales lo que hacemos lo que está
[1:28:12] aconteciendo aquí ya aconteció en los
[1:28:18] cielos todos estos grandes
[1:28:23] eventos tendría usted que estar viviendo
[1:28:25] bajo una roca para no ver qué está
[1:28:26] pasando Sí o
[1:28:30] sí él lo muestra los cielos
[1:28:36] primero y luego viene la tierra
[1:28:40] bien tienen que haber
[1:28:42] actores hay una escena que está
[1:28:46] puesta hebreos 111
[1:28:56] la parábola pone la lo espiritual y
[1:28:58] natural
[1:29:01] junto no importando queé tantos
[1:29:04] altibajos tenga
[1:29:05] [Música]
[1:29:08] usted un verdadero creyente
[1:29:11] tiene
[1:29:16] celal es pués la fe la sustancia las
[1:29:19] cosas que se esperan la demostración de
[1:29:20] las cosas que no se ven
[1:29:28] verso 3 Por fe entendemos haber sido
[1:29:30] compuestos los siglos por la palabra de
[1:29:33] Dios siendo hecho lo que se ve de lo que
[1:29:34] no se
[1:29:36] veía eso es lo que se trata la
[1:29:40] creación trayendo lo que no se ve del
[1:29:42] mundo
[1:29:44] espiritual al mundo natural o al mundo
[1:29:48] visible Entonces él usa las parábolas
[1:29:55] él usa el mundo
[1:29:57] visible para
[1:30:00] ilustrar
[1:30:02] el realo espiritual que no vemos que no
[1:30:04] podemos
[1:30:06] ver entonces una vez
[1:30:09] más el viste lo lo que no se
[1:30:14] ve con lo natural o lo físico que sí
[1:30:18] vemos piense
[1:30:21] esto hice la pregunta el otro día en la
[1:30:23] iglesia
[1:30:26] cuando Dios le dijo a Abraham que
[1:30:27] sacrificara a su
[1:30:29] hijo Cuántos hijos tenía Abraham es
[1:30:32] importante
[1:30:34] esto Cuántos hijos tenía
[1:30:38] Abraham estamos divididos otra
[1:30:41] vez nooses del
[1:30:46] mensaje Cuántos dicen que tenía un hijo
[1:30:50] Cuántos dos hijos
[1:30:54] bien estamos
[1:30:56] aprendiendo Gálatas
[1:31:06] 424 porque escrito está que Abraham tuvo
[1:31:08] dos
[1:31:09] hijos bien yo digo eso por una razón hay
[1:31:13] una razón por la cual lo digo de esta
[1:31:16] manera es como ha sido en el mensaje
[1:31:19] por tengo una
[1:31:22] cita Oh el hermano dijo esto maravilloso
[1:31:27] qué más dijo
[1:31:29] él qué más dijo Es todo lo que él
[1:31:35] dijo somos tan buenos para aislar citas
[1:31:39] y
[1:31:42] párrafos cuando yo era niño pensaba como
[1:31:46] niño cuando usted llega a ser un hombre
[1:31:48] Usted aprende
[1:31:52] entrara abrah tenía dos
[1:31:54] hijos uno por la
[1:31:57] sierva y el otro de la
[1:32:04] libre que de la sierva nació según la
[1:32:07] carne
[1:32:11] pero pero el de la libre nació por la
[1:32:16] promesa las cuales estas cosas una
[1:32:21] alegoría ahora tenemos una parábola y
[1:32:23] una alegoría
[1:32:26] el espíritu santo quiere que usted vea
[1:32:28] algo en esta
[1:32:29] mañana si usted aísla esa
[1:32:33] escritur usted siempre va a decir que
[1:32:35] Abraham tenía dos
[1:32:37] hijos y si usted se aisla Así
[1:32:42] mismo todo lo próximo que va a ha ver es
[1:32:45] que son solo usted va a ver sus fallas
[1:32:50] nos Qué es la primera cosa que la gente
[1:32:53] hace cuando no están viviendo bien o se
[1:32:56] aan Oh ya no vo a ir a la iglesia se
[1:32:59] aislan a sí
[1:33:00] mismo porque una
[1:33:04] alegoría siempre Mira hacia atrás al
[1:33:09] pasado y el pasado está bien si usted
[1:33:13] aprendió de
[1:33:15] él están
[1:33:18] conmigo hemos hecho tantas cosas que
[1:33:20] quizá no deos haber hecho es es nuestro
[1:33:21] pasado pero aprendimos nosotros eso es
[1:33:25] una
[1:33:27] alegoría Ahora cuando hablamos de la
[1:33:33] parábola la parábola sabe cuando usted
[1:33:35] es como una persona una mujer o un
[1:33:39] hombre o cuando una historia Realmente
[1:33:41] está siendo
[1:33:43] escrita por eso por eso es que digo
[1:33:47] esto hay eventos en la vida de Abraham
[1:33:50] que era simplemente él como hombre
[1:33:55] pero no todo lo que hizo Abraham era
[1:33:57] parte de la parábola era una
[1:34:02] alegoría ahora observe mientras que la
[1:34:04] parábola
[1:34:06] se Abraham tenía dos
[1:34:09] hijos por dice la
[1:34:12] Biblia escuela dominical
[1:34:19] Génesis 222
[1:34:26] toma ahora tu
[1:34:28] hijo Tu único
[1:34:39] hijo ahora estamos tomando escritura de
[1:34:41] acá de allá y estamos viendo un más
[1:34:44] grande verso 16
[1:34:48] dice y dijo por mí mismo he Jurado dice
[1:34:51] Jehová
[1:34:56] que por cuanto has hecho esto y no me
[1:34:57] has redado tu hijo Tu
[1:35:00] único pensé que tenía
[1:35:04] dos alegóricamente hablando
[1:35:07] sí parab parabólicamente hablando
[1:35:12] no
[1:35:17] parábola hebreos
[1:35:20] 11:17 Por fe ofreció a Abraham
[1:35:24] Isa cuando fue
[1:35:26] probado y ofrecía lo unigénito
[1:35:30] que hab recibido las
[1:35:34] promesas aquí está la
[1:35:36] parábola no todos la
[1:35:41] entienden no todos lo
[1:35:44] enti porque en la
[1:35:46] parábola están los secretos
[1:35:53] secreto en en algún
[1:35:58] lugar el libro de Jeremías dice que lo
[1:36:00] escondió en
[1:36:02] un hay cosas que están escondidas en
[1:36:05] nosotros que no
[1:36:08] sabemos pero las está
[1:36:12] revelando él nos da revelación dice el
[1:36:14] hermano
[1:36:15] AB mientras Así cuando él ve que
[1:36:18] necesitamos de la
[1:36:19] revelación la Biblia Entonces nos dice
[1:36:24] en Juan capítulo
[1:36:26] 5 escudriñad las escrituras
[1:36:32] 539 porque a vosotros os parece que en
[1:36:35] ellas tenéis la vida
[1:36:37] eterna todos leen la escritura es
[1:36:39] correcto y las que la
[1:36:43] leen y todos piensan que tienen vida
[1:36:48] eterna y ellas son las que dan
[1:36:50] testimonio
[1:36:55] porque sin conocer los pasajes secretos
[1:36:57] que están aquí levante su
[1:37:03] Biblia hay pasajes secretos en la
[1:37:06] Biblia que el mundo no conoce
[1:37:11] nada Ahora cuando un ministro en el
[1:37:16] mensaje cuando salen con una nueva idea
[1:37:18] una nueva
[1:37:19] doctrina nueva idea entre comillas
[1:37:23] que dice que no hay nada nuevo bajo el
[1:37:27] sol cuando salen con algo que nadie ha
[1:37:30] escuchado qu es la primera cosa que
[1:37:33] dicen tiene que leer entre las
[1:37:36] líneas Oh Eso está
[1:37:40] fácil lea entre las líneas porque usted
[1:37:43] no lee entre las líneas no usted está
[1:37:45] inventando
[1:37:50] cosas ahora si usted me puede mostrar
[1:37:52] que usted diciendo y usted tiene
[1:37:54] escritura y tiene
[1:37:56] mensaje y puede
[1:37:58] compararlo entonces lo voy a
[1:38:02] escuchar No lo escuchar por Solamente
[1:38:04] porque suena bien muchas cosas suenan
[1:38:06] bien a este a este
[1:38:10] hombre cuando usted entra al mero
[1:38:12] mero la parábola es para
[1:38:15] compararla observen
[1:38:17] esto observe lo que están diciendo
[1:38:20] acá 37
[1:38:31] porque no hará nada el señor Jehová sin
[1:38:34] que revele su secreto a su sivo los
[1:38:35] profetas es un
[1:38:39] secreto todos conmigo es un
[1:38:42] secreto Pero de ese
[1:38:46] secreto dentro de ese secreto hay
[1:38:52] secretos porque es la multiforma
[1:38:58] gracia multiforma quiere decir que tiene
[1:39:00] muchas otras
[1:39:02] partes cuando estamos hablando de
[1:39:06] esto cuando dijo hay puertas en
[1:39:10] puertas hay secretos en el
[1:39:15] secreto y no va a hacer nada sino que
[1:39:17] que lo revele a su siervo los
[1:39:20] profetas por eso es que me gustó cuando
[1:39:22] el her
[1:39:24] estamos hablando la palabra y
[1:39:25] dijo Oh es masivo esto masivo esto
[1:39:30] Dígale su vecino está masivo
[1:39:34] esto la palabra de Dios necesita estar
[1:39:36] en el
[1:39:38] corazón El problema es que la mayoría de
[1:39:40] la gente la tiene en la
[1:39:42] cabeza están tratando de de figurar todo
[1:39:45] Oh yo s lo yo le
[1:39:48] eso todavía está aquí
[1:39:53] baja
[1:39:55] corazón suelta el
[1:40:00] secreto suelta los secretos a usted y a
[1:40:03] mí eso es lo que es
[1:40:06] masivo piense de
[1:40:10] eso la gente de diferentes
[1:40:12] mundos lo perciben de diferentes
[1:40:15] maneras como si usted no tiene una
[1:40:18] vista viviría en otro mundo en el que
[1:40:21] estamos aquí estaría usted aquí
[1:40:25] pero sin vista estaría viviendo en otro
[1:40:27] mundo Igualmente como si usted no
[1:40:31] escuchara viviría en un mundo que no hay
[1:40:34] ruido ahora tome todo lo que estoy
[1:40:36] diciendo en lo
[1:40:38] espiritual Porque si somos cados
[1:40:40] espiritualmente vivimos en un mundo
[1:40:44] diferente y no podemos comprender o
[1:40:46] entender estas
[1:40:48] cosas esto
[1:40:54] revel otra vez la escritura dice
[1:41:00] esto Los Ángeles de Jehová encampar
[1:41:03] alrededor de ellos que le
[1:41:05] temen Cuántos de ustedes ven los ángeles
[1:41:08] de Jehová de
[1:41:12] Dios mi abuela una
[1:41:15] vez estaba sentada en la
[1:41:17] iglesia casi nadie vino a la
[1:41:20] iglesia y el ministro dice
[1:41:23] todas esas sillas
[1:41:25] vacías si usted solamente pudiera abrir
[1:41:28] sus
[1:41:29] ojos podría ver que hay un ángel sentado
[1:41:32] en cas silla y ella
[1:41:36] pensó ella pensó yo no veo
[1:41:40] Ángeles cuando de repente sus ojos
[1:41:43] espirituales
[1:41:45] abrieron vi Ángeles por todas

[2:10:25] pero acerca de los tiempos y los
[2:10:28] momentos empieza con un
[2:10:32] empero no tenéis hermanos necesidad que
[2:10:34] yo os
[2:10:37] escriba si el
[2:10:44] empero contrasta con algo que dijo
[2:10:48] previamente tengo que regresar al
[2:10:50] capítulo anterior
[2:10:52] es el verso el primer verso de este
[2:10:56] capítulo ni siquiera me pegó hasta que
[2:10:58] ya
[2:11:00] llegó y empezamos con hermano morten a
[2:11:02] leer
[2:11:03] esto primera Tesalonicenses
[2:11:06] 4
[2:11:08] [Música]
[2:11:11] 16 el 51 no tiene mucho sentido
[2:11:14] sol hasta que usted regrese el cuatro y
[2:11:18] tiene sentido total
[2:11:20] [Aplausos]
[2:11:23] porque el mismo señor con aclamación con
[2:11:25] voz de Arcángel y con voz de trompeta de
[2:11:28] Dios trompeta de
[2:11:30] Dios descenderá de los cielos y los
[2:11:32] muertos en Cristo resucitarán
[2:11:35] primero luego nosotros los que vivimos
[2:11:37] los que juntamente que seremos
[2:11:39] arrebatados en las nubes en las
[2:11:42] nubes para recibir al Señor en el
[2:11:46] aire Y así estaremos siempre con el
[2:11:48] señor
[2:11:51] por tanto consolado los unos a los otros
[2:11:53] con estas palabras confortos unos a los
[2:11:58] otros ahí puedo escuchar el pueblo en
[2:12:01] los tiempos de Pablo
[2:12:03] diciendo bien Te creemos
[2:12:08] Pablo cuando va a pasar la trompeta y la
[2:12:11] voz denos una sazón una etapa una
[2:12:15] temporada no les contestó de esa
[2:12:17] manera regresemos otra vez al capítulo C
[2:12:26] les pued les puedo escuchar decir Pablo
[2:12:28] cuando el tiempo para esto
[2:12:31] cuando vieron que no no lo
[2:12:34] captaron Enton dio pero
[2:12:38] pero acerca de los tiempos y de los
[2:12:43] momentos no tenéis hermano necesidad que
[2:12:46] yo
[2:12:47] escriba porque yo sé que van a tratar de
[2:12:49] figurar cuándo es
[2:12:53] pero Dios le dio un tiempo específico a
[2:12:55] los
[2:12:56] judíos pero no le dio tiempo específic
[2:12:59] los
[2:13:01] gentiles los tiempos y todo esto no le
[2:13:04] puedo
[2:13:05] decir no es Razo para que yo les diga
[2:13:09] esto y luego abre un
[2:13:13] pasaje ahora el pasaje ha sido
[2:13:17] abierto porque vosotros

[2:13:53] un buen tiempo arrepentirme Oh tan
[2:13:56] ciegos tan ciegos observen
[2:14:00] esto observen mientras Pablo empieza a
[2:14:03] mostrarles esto usted no puede aislar
[2:14:07] esto porque está está preguntándose como
[2:14:10] el resto del
[2:14:13] mundo eso significa que vendrá como un

[2:23:44] conferencia porque era tiempo para

[2:24:47] sellos estamos en otra conferencia
[2:24:51] Esa es la venida del hijo de
