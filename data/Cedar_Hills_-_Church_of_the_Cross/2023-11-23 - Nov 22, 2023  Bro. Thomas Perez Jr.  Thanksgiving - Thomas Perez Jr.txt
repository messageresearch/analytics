TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now she loves me too much I I love church I wish we had more then we get more church and you say I wish I I didn't have so much we're we're never we're never happy but I want you today to focus on what you do have I believe that you each and every one of you is here tonight because it's been a little while that God saved you you're looking at me like deers and headlights how many here has God saved does it still excite you does do do you still feel H H uh happy about it are you thankful how many in here has he given giving you the Holy Ghost not really sure how many in here has he given you the Holy Ghost are you happy that you've received God's life give God thanks for what you have received we in this congregation have have we eat very well naturally and spiritually but spiritually we we eat better than most people around the world do many people wish that they had just a little bit of what you have but the word of God does not miss it when it says this in everything give thanks should you pray for your food should you say thank you to the Cook they spent time and love to make sure you have the food ready I don't know if you're if we're like you or you're like us but we are going to put in a lot of money and time and energy just on one meal tomorrow okay all right well we are we put in a lot of time and energy you know and you got to make the turkey you got to make the gravy you got to make the stuffing got to make the mashed potatoes you got to make the pies nobody's hungry yet or or or or or if or or if uh if uh if you get blessed one one one year brother Caleb made made his prime rib what one one year we ate ribs we we like we like to shatter the the whole myth of everything but we but but we but we understand in all of this that it's so important to give God thanks the man complained and I always say this the man complained about having no shoes until he saw the man without any feet now I want you to to to to visualize yourself in 1620 there was a there was a boat with a bunch of pilgrims on them and they were crossing the Atlantic they they were fleeing uh religious persecution if they could see us now sometimes we'll come to church if we want to sometimes not but if they see us now they they came across in this big old ship no no no less that they took a months and months and months to get here but they were going to a land that they could have better hope in they knew that many would die many would starve to death many many people would would would would would not understand why they're going they went for one purpose and that was to maintain their way of life and the freedom to serve God the way they wanted to now what Journey would you take tonight what what kind of Journey Journey would you take if somebody told you you could not raise up your hands somebody told you you could you couldn't sing No More would you go just gently into the night and say well I I guess I won't do it no more or would you try to find a way that you could raise your hand would you find a way where you could say hallelujah would you find a way that you would have Liberty to serve the Lord any way you want to now that winter they were about ready to die without a shadow of a doubt there there that was not the first Thanksgiving in 1564 the Spanish came to a place that is called that is close to San Austine Florida and they then had their what was called the first Thanksgiving this was a new life in a new place and no one knew about it can you imagine to have that type of vision spend everything that you have leave your house leave your family to go to a place you've never been before knowing that you might die but it meant everything to you and to your family that's why the Bible says again in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you as we talk about Thanksgiving there are three types of givers the Flint the Flint the sponge and the honeycomb there are three types of givers again the Flint the sponge the honeycomb to get anything out of the Flint you have to have it then you mostly get chips and Sparks out of it to get water out of the sponge you have to squeeze it and the more you squeeze the more you get but the honeycomb is different it's simply overflows you don't have to beat it you don't have to squeeze it automatically it just oozes out when a person truly realizes what God has done for them in their day they're they want to be a honeycomb we ourselves live in a time that depends what our approach to anything is should we need a hammer to get anything out of people should we go and squeeze people or should we just let them give now I want I want to I want to read something here for you and I think that it will help you imen m s now you just deal with me tonight just deal with me just just a second all right I heard this the other day actually yeah it must have been yesterday one of the largest and strongest horses in the world is the Belgian draft horse one of them by themselves can pull 8,000 okay two of them can pull how many 16,000 somebody else want to back him up 16,000 going once twice okay sister they're back backing him up and even every one of us would say the same answer that's what I would say but if these two Belgian horses if they are raised together they learn how to pull together and learn how to be unified together they can pull 32,000 lb that's why the scripture says one can put 1,000 to flight to 10,000 to fly pulling in the same direction what would happen if everybody in our Church pulled in the same direction what would happen if we would pull in the same direction one group will pull this way another group will pull that way and as our pastor says if you want to go fast go by yourself but if you want to go far you got to travel together what concept is this it's the concept or the mathematics of God no wonder the psalmist would say this A thousand shall fall at my at thy side and 10,000 at thy right hand but it shall not come n thee so when you go into what is God in his mathematics this is something that we should understand very plainly in the Book of Revelation chapter 5 and verse 11 we want to do some simple math and it says and I beheld and heard the voice of many angels round about the [Applause] throne and the beasts and the elders and the number was 10,000 time 10,000 and thousands of thousands if you put the numbers to the scripture 1 + 1 equal 2 1 + 1 equal 2 but in the scripture if you you get what the Apostle John is is telling us that round about The Throne there was 10,000 time 10,000 thousands of thousands so there was 10 so there was 10 to the power of 13 what is that makes it conservatively there are aund thousand billion Angels now when you when you when you look at that number you find out that that there is there is a also when Satan takes a third of the angels and then you look around and you say well why is the world so heavy and and and so Lawless because if you take the sum of the numbers there is 10,000 demons for every Christian that's why you have such a battle but let me tell you what the scripture says greater is he that is in me than he that that is in the world so if we just take conservatively there's 50,000 Angels just in charge of you okay again there's 10,000 angels that are there just to make your life miserable make sure you don't come to church make sure that the clock doesn't doesn't doesn't sound make sure that the car doesn't start make sure that that nothing happens your your clothes aren't Iron you can't come to church but let me tell you there's 10,000 of them that are trying Every Which Way get down but conservatively there's 50,000 that every day they say you can do it come on on in everything give thanks don't don't Focus about what you don't have Focus about what you do have and I when I when I see the these I say what a great God we serve you know you know one day Elisha was looking and at Dothan and and and and there was there was a a there was the the city was encamped about with a bunch of soldiers tells his his his his servant look there's more with us than there is against us and he's looking around he's surrounded we look around every day and we're surrounded Lord open his eyes and when he opened up his eyes thousands and thousands and thousands of angels around on the mountain millions millions and millions no wonder the scripture says are they not ministering Spirits sent forth for them who shall be Heirs of Salvation so according to the math of God if one believer believes God he chases a thousand away pretty good huh but if two get together 10,000 are chased away if three Believers get together a 100,000 demons go back to the pits of hell if four Believers got together they chased a 100,000 forgive me a million if five Believers got together they chased 10 million if six Believers got together I don't know if you believe me tonight but that's right a 100 million would be chased back home and if seven Believers is there seven Believers here stand to your feet if you're a Believer 1 2 3 4 5 6 say oh we got more than seven if seven Believers got together taste a billion Devils Back to the you may be seated now that's how much power that there is the word of God is very rich whatsoever things Ye Ye are that are pure and lovely meditate on these things okay I I I ran into the the post that's not lovely uh the the brother didn't didn't say hello to me that's not lovely so I'm going to think about that the whole day whatever things are pure whatever things are lovely meditate on them the problem is my papa said problem Pap people don't have a CH to meditate because they have their their phone iPad IP computer television they don't have no time if you don't make time there's no time to come to church sometimes we drag into church right it's because brother you don't know I got a lot of business wait a minute there there comes a time when we create the atmosphere where the Holy Spirit outside of number one cannot operate well we need to be here 30 minutes before we don't but you know why we do need to be here 30 minutes before whatever things are pure whatever things are lovely it wouldn't be so wouldn't it be so good that instead of talking about somebody and immediately open the door and come into church if when I open up the church door I went straight to my seat and I started reading for God so loved the world behold I shall send unto you Elijah the prophet blessed is he that readeth and heareth the prophecy of this book John saw the bride wow who did he see John didn't see a bride me but doesn't become pure yet not lovely yet do you remember and I don't I don't want to be like like like brother brother has his own style but you know we heard a great a great message on Sunday he's very romantic I I think if I did that my wife wouldn't know who I was but I have been romantic with her a few times but everyone has their own style and that's great that's wonderful he he said that he had a brother said he had a bonon or however he said and I I said Well mine's vanilla Mine mine's she white chocolate we can get real real real uh real there and I I I don't but I but I want to take you to this yes cuz as much as I love it that's that's not me how she got together with me is because you know how they say who who who's crazier the the the crazy man or the one that got married to the crazy person all I know is that she's St Peter is not gonna have no problems recognizing Sister Laura ask as he opens up the doors who are you she'll come straight in if if you would know the day the time that you f first fell in love with Jesus hey it might have been a service like today you you you the preacher heard do you know that God loves you and you you yourself heard that for the first time oh somebody loves me and your head your heart melted with the love of God and so every time that we we we we go and and I and I and I you you you come into the newness of life and you look at the scripture and then and then you say oh I wish I could do this I I wish I could do this other thing and you can if you start meditating upon it now now people don't know what really what God is they they they have an a a a figment of their imagination and until it came to the time that brother brandham said I used to think that God hated me but that Jesus loved me until I found out that Jesus was the very Heart Of God so we start thinking about him and when you start thinking about him you start thinking about how great he is have you ever seen the mountains have you seen the organ mountains somebody had to create those have you seen the trees somebody had to put the seed there so that tree could Sprout out have you seen your brother or your sister L lately somebody had to preach the gospel to them in order for them to understand the the the reality of God but we found out that after a while we don't we don't we don't we don't meditate or we don't we don't get into the idea of what it is and our wife gets a little bit older you get a little bit older except that the majority of men think that they never get old I looked at myself in the mirror a while back and I said who's that old man looking at well it was me but we think we don't get old but every day we get old we get old here and we get newer there but we have to start thinking about it we start thinking about his word maybe I don't feel good but then all of us sudden says if this Earthly body be dissolved we have another one waiting for us I feel sick but there's another body body over there that's not sick I can't walk but there's a body over there that needs no help I can't smile but there's a body over there that you cannot stop it from smiling but it all depends of what you meditate about will tomorrow be better than today it all depends what you think it all depends of what how you prepare today now there are some things that you prepare today for tomorrow something and and and you say well you know you know things that let are left marinating yeah they get better is spaghetti better the next day is enchiladas better the next day there are certain things that are better the next day there are certain things but you think about it whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely meditate on them I've come to the understanding of this maybe not fully but to meditate on what God has given me and meditate on what what our future is because it doesn't matter what happens to this body but when we constantly think I'm nobody I'm just a just a run-of-the-mill there's nothing special about me I I love our pastor and our and our founding Pastor because they had no junk drawers they had no junk drawers each and every one of you were the best of God my dad would say I have the best church I have the best preachers I have the best family because if somebody doesn't believe it nobody will believe it you are the best of God and when you get down and the enemy tries to saturate your mind whatever things are pure whatever things are lovely I start thinking about these things it says the Bible says this therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature all things are passed away behold all things are become new but how is it you know I I can tell you the past of that person and that's what everybody remembers is the past you remember when Uncle when they they killed this dog that day forward they called him a dog killer just by killing one dog and the next time here comes the dog killer and he only did it one time you remember uncle in in in the in the mines and there at the Coby [Applause] mines there was a man that went that went down the mine he worked underground went through the tunnels by the time they found him he was in Sita from that day on he was known as he was known as the lost one yeah cuz everybody has a past even if you if you if you straighten up you know I had I had a I had a I had a customer and and he he he he liked to drink wine and his his nickname was Willie wine well I I never had the courage to to to tell him will he whine willine till one day I said is it all right if I call you willly wi he said you already because he wanted to bury his past but the only thing that can do away with your past is the blood of Jesus Christ but there are people in the church that are resurrectionists and every time they see you they bring it back to your memory remember when you used to do this remember when you used to do that but whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely think on these things our our our our pastor would say this it says that all things passed away behold all things are become new Happy Thanksgiving he's a new species of being he's a new race he's a new breed he's a super breed you know why he's Jesus people you know when you when you when you understand this It Isn't So Much what we gave up but it's what we have received it's what we take on Ruth in the Bible Ruth she was suffering and in famine actually Israel was suffering with famine that's how Naomi went to the to the land of Moab well when Ruth came back with naomii Ruth was in poverty this might this might make you say Amen she didn't give up her poverty she only took on boaz's riches Happy Thanksgiving and the poverty went away she didn't give up her loneliness she only took on the companionship of Boaz so then when we are in Christ it's not so much what we leave but it's what we take on become new so we come to church I'm I want to be a a better person take on Christ he's better than me he's good you know when Isaiah could not describe him anymore I'm gonna finish now when Isaiah could not describe him and he says he's the Mighty God he's the Everlasting father he's the Prince of Peace of his Kingdom there shall be no end when he could not give him anymore he just raised up and his hands and said this his name Shall be Called wonderful I was wondering today is he still wonderful me and my brothers in our family my mama passed away almost 28 years ago Jesus is still one our Papa passed away this this year in May you know why because we know where they went to do you trust me that if I take you through the fire do you trust my word do you think that whatever things are pure have you put on the word have the word have you become the word have you spoken the word has Life come out of your mouth then it's not what you have left it's what you have put on no wonder the scripture says put on the whole armor of God we are in a in a great place today but God wants to take this church to where it's never been I'm G to say it again God wants to take this church higher and higher places plain than I have but what does it require all of us together well you see we'll see what the ministry is doing we'll see what the trusty board's doing we'll see what the Deacon board's doing we'll see what the men are doing what everybody wants to do whatsoever things are pure if one can pull 8,000 pound can two 32,000 if one Believer by himself he can put a thousand enemies to fight en you imagine if seven men got together a billion demons would fight over themselves to get back to hell because every time that you wake up brother brother Elijah every time you wake up in the morning 20,000 demons are shaking in their boots because they know it's not going to go good for them today you know why cuz I'm going to be early to church and I'm going to think about oh Hallelujah I'm GNA and oh Hallelujah I can't wait to hear what the pastor's next message is praise the Lord I have put on the word I want to put on more words I I want to think the things of God and when I do I don't have time to talk about nobody if you want to talk about somebody talk about [Applause] him talk about him and you watch a billion demons cry like babies all the way back home because God wants to take you higher and higher plac but we have to to do it tell your neighbor we got to do it together you know Spanish say it in Spanish you know Chinese say it in Chinese now don't look at me because I look Chinese and I can speak Chinese all right I wish I could and I would talk to you in Chinese but I will tell you together there is nothing that can defeat this great Army of separate he'll pick us off one by one where did so and so go to I don't know oh we got to send somebody after him together if you feel bad against somebody get closer to him so you don't feel bad he's your buddy he is going to be the one to take you over the next hurdle that man right Happy Thanksgiving give thanks to the person that's next to you can can you just tell the person next to you I'm so happy you're my friend if if you're not next to somebody
