[29:49] James Version that was to produce an was
[29:51] Lorena Elena and he said no III don't
[29:54] know no say I said simply because of
[29:57] this simplemente cosas de esto because
[29:59] when the angel of the Lord spoke to
[30:01] brother branham or kick on the oculus
[30:02] your loyal Amano but he recited
[30:04] scripture Alerus it was key to us he

[30:17] James Version Study Bible it were from a
[30:19] place that was comparable considering
[30:21] Avila Reina Valera said if it's good
[30:22] enough for the Prophet that it's good
[30:24] enough for me she's to us not the one
[30:26] not profit that I went up and when you
[30:28] look into this understand mean I miss we
[30:30] realize that there are many many
[30:32] versions of Emma's game which has been
[30:34] of the Bible out there de la familia not
[30:36] just versions but translations
[30:38] no sir Roberts units paratime in and
[30:41] doesn't unit and one source says that
[30:44] there are currently over two hundred and
[30:46] thirty three English versions of the
[30:49] Bible on the market today and enough
[30:51] when Teresa caddos in today the
[30:52] tradition is Vandemark it away and that
[30:54] it has been translated into over 2,000
[30:57] languages yes he's a very shy it was
[30:59] middling why and how many more versions
[31:02] and translations are there what dozen
[31:04] others unity on tour since I in the
[31:06] churches unless unless yes as everybody
[31:08] seems to have their version of what the
[31:10] scriptures mean Komodo parece que tiene
[31:12] very happy that God sent a prophet
[31:15] what does that one think goes back very
[31:16] happy that God would send a prophet is
[31:18] my nonprofit so we didn't have to guess
[31:20] that to what it meant
[31:22] Nick Ramos we didn't have to put our own
[31:24] I understanding their ideas of what we
[31:26] think it means nothing it was kept on a
[31:28] little propane there lo que significa
[31:29] but just to get you to see something
[31:32] here no much better give me an angle
[31:34] it's some sometimes you of course or
[31:36] many times people say well I want the
[31:38] more modern version
[31:42] I know you do I want the easier to
[31:45] understand version Kenny Loggins you
[31:47] known this in tandem as fast I'm like
[31:49] there is no easier to understand version
[31:51] no I never assume content I must be only
[31:53] way too easy that makes it easier to
[31:55] understand is to go back to the source
[31:57] and then you come up and then Thomas
[31:59] Russell is he that you go back to a
[32:01] profit he don't profit and that profit
[32:02] brings a message yes a profit or a metal
[32:05] that hey all the scriptures and
[32:07] reconcile them together they taught us
[32:09] to wrestle at reckon still yeah when
[32:12] time so that you understand and know
[32:13] where I'm coming from solo but I can't

[2:10:23] things are in the church and you know
[2:10:26] what the world's hungry for the world
[2:10:29] wants to see something genuine that's
[2:10:33] what's the matter these conversions
[2:10:35] that's a circle
[2:10:36] they're not real conversions it's
[2:10:40] interaction there's an intellectual
[2:10:43] knowledge of Christ but a born-again
[2:10:47] experience gives the real crime aunt
[2:10:52] America is people who have to be
[2:10:54] entertained they've got too much
[2:10:56] television in them they weren't
[2:10:58] entertainment they then find the
[2:11:01] old-fashioned gospel they said we can go
[2:11:03] over here it isn't so rough we can do
[2:11:05] what we want to go ahead but I see fear
[2:11:10] in mob
[2:11:14] you know that's true Oh God
[2:11:18] least that's the church God offer do you
[2:11:22] Harbor truth as the hymn desert brood
[2:11:25] but you would not you listen to man
[2:11:28] leaders instead of the Holy Spirit
[2:11:30] leaders you listen to man teachers
[2:11:33] instead of gods teacher the Holy Ghost
[2:11:35] we would teach you behavior make you
[2:11:38] behave yourself nice may give you lady
[2:11:41] life make you the salt of the earth the
[2:11:44] salt creates a thirst and man appears to
[2:11:49] be like you if you really live the
[2:11:51] Christian life you can't do it in
[2:11:53] yourself you've got the head of Christ
[2:11:55] in you to do it the world is what with
[2:11:58] some genuine that's the reason they see
[2:12:01] people that claim to be something and
[2:12:03] going out acting like the rest the world
[2:12:05] that's what calls communism to rise in
[2:12:08] Russia or to town the Catholic Church
[2:12:12] dr9 claiming to be something and has no
[2:12:15] morning accident done just like the
[2:12:17] world no more than any other Lodge not
[2:12:19] only Catholic but Protestant just as bad
[2:12:23] and it's come down home to the
[2:12:26] Pentecostals acting dressed in fashion
[2:12:30] and looking talking spiced even making
[2:12:33] fun and different
[2:12:37] that's rough but it's good for you the
[2:12:41] truth but that's reason the world can't
[2:12:44] see nothing genuine when the people
[2:12:47] comes to a place that they forget all
[2:12:49] the little differences and the love of
[2:12:51] God will shed abroad in our hearts by
[2:12:53] the real teacher the Holy Ghost you'll
[2:12:56] become salty and the world will want to
[2:12:58] be like you you create a creation around
[2:13:02] you you've seen people you couldn't
[2:13:04] stand to be around yet they were nice
