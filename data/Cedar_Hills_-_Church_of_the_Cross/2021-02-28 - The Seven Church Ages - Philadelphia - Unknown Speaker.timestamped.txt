[0:08] the messenger angel messenger to that
[0:11] church age
[0:13] we believe solemnly with all of our
[0:14] heart to be john wesley
[0:18] the church h began at 1750 when the
[0:22] lutheran church age went out and lasted
[0:24] up to somewhere
[0:25] in 1900 around 1906
[0:30] the westland church age
[0:33] now the age is the
[0:36] age of church age of brotherly love
[0:40] the great missionary age and the
[0:44] open door age and the reward was a
[0:49] pillar
[0:50] made a pillar and the revelation of
[0:54] three names the name of god the name of
[0:58] city of god
[1:00] god's new name is a revelation that was
[1:03] given to this church
[1:05] john wesley was the star of the age
[1:09] and um he was born on june the 17th
[1:13] 1703 an epworth rectory
[1:17] england father a preacher
[1:21] mother a consecrated saint
[1:24] although with 19 children to take care
[1:27] of
[1:28] she found much time during a busy day
[1:33] to teach her children bible lessons
[1:37] and bible stories and pray for them
[1:42] that's what made the boys what they were
[1:44] the great songwriter
[1:46] charles his brother who gave the world
[1:50] some of the most inspiring songs
[1:52] we've ever had john rose up early every
[1:55] morning
[1:57] or sixty years he got up every morning
[1:59] at four o'clock
[2:02] that's one thing that church has fallen
[2:03] from got up every morning at four
[2:06] o'clock
[2:07] and preached at five am for
[2:10] fifty years straight and sometimes he
[2:13] preached from two to four times
[2:15] a day it is said by
[2:20] people of england that he rode a horse
[2:25] 4500 english smiles every year to preach
[2:29] the gospel
[2:31] i know thy works behold i
[2:34] have set before then open door and no
[2:38] man can shut it
[2:39] for al has a little strength and has
[2:41] kept my word and is not denying my name
[2:44] now i watch the time coming now as the
[2:48] great
[2:48] missionary move that swept across the
[2:50] nations of brotherly love
[2:52] to take what they had nothing against it
[2:55] of literature whatever more
[2:57] into the different parts of the world
[2:59] now the church
[3:01] denomination had gone back
[3:04] to uh education works again
[3:07] the gone back after the great
[3:09] denomination had been
[3:11] set up jesus set
[3:14] an open door after the wesleyan
[3:19] age had come in and the methodist church
[3:21] had been
[3:22] established in the earth taken roots
[3:26] growing
[3:26] making a great church which it is today
[3:28] one of the greatest of among the
[3:30] protestant churches
[3:31] and that time the thing that took place
[3:34] then was
[3:35] jesus set an open door for the church
[3:40] before they entered into the lady of cnh
[3:44] oh here's what you have to watch now
[3:47] it's just
[3:48] in between the philadelphia and the lady
[3:50] ocean age
[3:52] lap over jesus is the door
[3:57] now if you'll turn with me to john 10
[4:00] 17 then said jesus unto them verily
[4:03] verily i say unto you
[4:05] i am the door
[4:09] of the sheeple
[4:12] let's back into the blessings how do we
[4:14] get into christ
[4:16] what is he the sheepfold now remember
[4:19] we're not talking against anybody that
[4:22] good people is a
[4:23] scatter god sheep is in all that places
[4:26] out there
[4:27] that is true that's right methodists
[4:30] baptists whatever they are they're god's
[4:32] people
[4:32] if they are born again of the spirit of
[4:35] god after that begin to
[4:37] come along the first thing you know they
[4:39] organized the old general council which
[4:41] one in now called the
[4:42] families of god amen see
[4:45] all that church that was left over i
[4:48] know that works
[4:49] behold i set before thee an open door
[4:53] and no man can shut it uh has a little
[4:56] strength
[4:57] and has not denied my name
[5:00] no man can be saved only through jesus
[5:02] christ
[5:03] not through any church in the
[5:05] organization any bishop pope
[5:07] just through jesus christ he has the key
[5:10] he's the only one the keys of what david
[5:14] the future coming millennium where he'll
[5:16] sit on the throne of david
[5:18] i have the keys of david i'll open this
[5:21] door and nobody can shut it nobody can
[5:23] open it with me and nobody can shut it
[5:25] to me
[5:25] for thou has a little strength
[5:28] you got just a little strength now what
[5:31] does that mean
[5:32] just like a man has been dead kind of
[5:34] shaking himself
[5:36] reviving up a little oh don't you see
[5:39] brother and what you've done
[5:40] he went right straight back to the thing
[5:42] that god hated
[5:44] break up brotherhood look at the
[5:45] assemblies of god some of the finest
[5:47] people in worlds in them
[5:48] assemblies of god look at that united
[5:50] pentecostal church
[5:51] just as fine as you ever met in your
[5:53] life look at the church of god
[5:54] and because of those organizations they
[5:56] fuss and squeal and fuss with one
[5:58] another co-owner of buzzers and rat then
[6:00] why it's a disgrace one thing god
[6:04] hates is sowing discard among brethren
[6:06] now trying
[6:07] sometimes organizations is what does it
[6:09] sows discord among brothers
[6:11] we should be standing there preaching
[6:12] saying we are brothers
[6:15] and no man shoved it or thou has a
[6:18] little strength
[6:19] and has kept my word all right
[6:22] and has not denied my name behold i will
[6:26] make them
[6:27] of the synagogue of satan which say they
[6:29] are jews
[6:30] which say they are spirit-filled
[6:32] christians
[6:34] say the synagogue the organization i'll
[6:37] make them it says they got the holy
[6:39] ghost
[6:39] organized organized up there they
[6:41] haven't got the revelation yet

[7:06] sanctified and think it's got the holy
[7:08] ghost
[7:10] and your fellow speak in tongues you're
[7:11] something you'll laugh at and make fun
[7:13] of himself of the
[7:15] brother you sealed your doom when you
[7:18] did that
[7:19] you blasphemed the holy ghost which is
[7:21] unpardonable
[7:23] because thou has kept the word of my
[7:27] patience
[7:28] i also will keep thee that little
[7:31] remnant
[7:32] from the hour of temptation when the
