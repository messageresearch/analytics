[Music] [Music] o [Music] ah [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] w [Music] [Music] h [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this account is regarding a soldier boy and uh knowing that I had raised I'd been raised in quite a few of the Army Camps US Army Camps during the building of the Alaskan Highway now this was 1961 so I had not seen a US Army uniform but I I I in the foyer of the church or it wasn't the church it was the church Hall in Dawson Creek United Church Hall in Dawson Creek and I I looked through the people and I could see a staff sergeant on a tunic and so that caught my attention I thought that's nice to see you know and then I didn't see see it anymore then while we're in the service we've come to the end of the service it is Saturday evening uh and brother brandham has preached the service from that time and we've come to the end of the service and he begins to sing the whole congregation begin to saying I love him I love him right in the midst of that course at the first end of the course what's the matter soldier boy you're not good to commits to his [Music] sign the devil's lying to you boy you've only got a phobe he's lying to you he'll drive you insane if you believe him deny him renounce the devil I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to renounce the devil and accept Jesus Christ as your healer you'll go back and be a gentleman and a real real man do you do it raise up your hands to God and say praise God that's right oh amen now go back home and be well all in believing raise your hands and give me pra the amazing thing is I was there I was on the platform and so I immediately thought of this this tunic that I had seen and and young people were buying you know army uniforms and tunics and so on just wearing it as jackets so I didn't know but what it was that and uh so I began to look for soldja boy and others were looking also there were also some Canadian uh soldiers that had been attending the meeting one of them became a very very firm believer and uh we couldn't see any soldier boy at all brother brandham continues to talk to him and says you'll go home and be a real gentleman and be a real man deny the devil deny him and so it was a it was a startling moment really and the next day we were leaving or the following day we were leaving early in the morning on Monday morning brother brandham did not know where we were were taking him I was just taking him off the Alaskan Highway and we were going to go about 375 400 miles so we drove as far as Fort Nelson which is mile 300 and I said to brother brandham I said you know maybe by maybe we should have a bite to eat because by the time we get up to brother southwick's place which will be my 375 at that time I said you know Sister Lyla will probably be done her dishes at sister Southwick and he said I think that's a good idea so we just pulled off on an access road on the left side and stopped a little little stopping place it was like a little hotel when the US Army pushed the highway through do through Fort Dawson Creek and then Fort St John they passed the town and then the service stations Etc built alongside of the road and so we stopped in there but there was a restaurant just a little clapboard building probably two stories and uh we're having our uh we're going to have our lunch brother chrisberg was with us there was brother chrisberg brother brandham and myself and we sat in a booth that waitress had come and taken our order and just after that the door opened which was on the side of the building and in came two men and I recognized as one as being the soldier boy that I'd seen in the tunic unit the T tunic uniform I should say and uh I when I looked at him I said well fancy seeing you here I had been away from this area for about a year and a half and brother brandham he just looked up over his shoulder like this to see who it was I was talking to he thought maybe perhaps one of my old friends I don't know what he thought exactly but just then a a kind of a stout heavy or set man squeezed between him and came around and and thrust his hand down towards brother brandom and said brother br he said remember calling out the soldier boy and and brother brandham was a little startled because he hadn't expected that and he said uh uh he said he looked across the table he said do you remember brother Eddie I said yes you said you'll not commit suicide soldier boy that's the devil talking to you he said yeah that's what you said that's what you said and he's shaking brother brenham's hand he said well I brought him all the way from Fairbanks and we we tried to get him into a prayer line and we weren't able to get him into a prayer line he said this is him would you pray for him and uh oh sure and just that moment the waitress came and slid our soup in front of us and uh so brother Bram said well uh perhaps and that was one of my first real shocking moments I thought brother Brandon was going to stand and pray for him cast that devil out of him you know because that was how I had been brought up and brother brandham said well maybe we'll just eat our soup first and I thought eat our soup you know here here's a soldier boy trying to commit suicide so anyway they said well that'll be fine we need to get something to eat ourselves and they went down two three booths and sat in uh to have their dinner and then brother brandham entered into vision and he just looked over my head and uh began to talk about what had happened in the prayer line the day before he said I believe there was a blind woman that came through the service yesterday and I said well I I can't remember a blind woman and brother Chris Berg spoke up he said yeah I believe there was a blind woman and brother Bram he's he's not really acknowledging our conversation he just looking over my head and uh he said yes he said let's see yes he said oh I understand I say now he said there's a young German woman that has given up her place in the prayer line to lead the blind woman through and then he he looked at me he said you see brother Eddie it may be that she's praying right now and and he he said uh just a moment and he looks away for a moment he said yes she's a German woman just to help you believe he said I'll ask him and he'll give me her name and he just looked away he said yes her name is Sister fair in English we would say fair but in German we would say fair sister fair and then he just moved his head for a little bit he said you see perhaps she's praying just now he said she has a heart trouble she has an uh two or three organs in her body and he named them and said she's she may be praying just now I asked my father if he could find this woman and my father found her she was in a a city quite a bit south of Dawson Creek and it would have been about 500 miles from where we were sitting and I I just found myself in an unusual place and now with that soldier boy in his need brother brandham became under that burden so as soon as we were finished eating we got up to pay the bill and brother brandham he's standing right in front he wouldn't he wouldn't let anyone pay the bill so he's standing right in front of the cash desk and we're I'm standing right beside him and the soldier boy came in and he's right behind him and the soldier boy just tapped him on the shoulder he said brother brandham he said just two minutes just two minutes oh sure he said and uh and and the little thought F we all in a group there and we walked out the door and outside the door was a small sidewalk it went down here uh would be to the left as we came out and went down to the garbage cans and up to the right would be where the cars were parked on the gravel access road and so I and chrisberg and the little heavys set fellow who drove him down uh went up we we went up there but I faced myself so I could watch and see that brother brandham what he was doing because I was very very curious in my young heart I was about 26 27 and I'd been preaching for several years but I was just I there was no such a thing as knowing the message yet there's no such a thing I had no knowledge of Malachi 4 I had no knowledge of Revelation no knowledge of a messenger I only knew that brother Branham had a unique the unique uh part of his ministry was the angel of the Lord that was always there and I thought if that angel of the Lord is in attendance at these meetings regardless of what anyone has said about him or said about his Doctrine I would I would know by the presence of the Angel of the Lord that he would not honor something that was not correct or true and so as I was watching brother brandham I saw that he had his hat off and I knew that he was praying and then he slipped his hat back on and both of both he and the soldier boy turned around and they're walking very erect towards me the soldier boy was a bit quite a bit taller than brother brandham and I thought at that instant I thought now this could be a very charismatic moment and I'm not going going to be swept away by the you know the excitement or the emotion of the moment and that's what I had just had in my heart but the Soldier Boy's face was completely transformed formed he was he was just totally relaxed and he thrust his hand up into the air with his fist he said I'm free I'm free I'm free and they came up and the soldier said to me he said this man told me something that only I and my wife in this world know says and when he did it was gone so we stepped into our cars and we said our farewells and I guess I understand I took a picture of them and which I'm this is a unique part of this ministry and the unique part of my testimony is the Eternal aspect of God because here I had it on the platform now here we were 300 mil up the road and all I can really say is I was there on the platform I heard him call the solder boy out we have it on tape now I'm 300 miles away and you you have to understand where we were standing you probably could go a, or500 miles north and never see a human you could probably go at least five six 7 100 miles south and never see a human down the Rocky Mountain trench from where we were truly a needle in a Hast stack and that man had brought the soldier down for prayer from Fairbanks Alaska 1523 miles on a very difficult Journey actually believed he said I believed that we would find you and the soldier boy spoke up and he said that is correct this man actually believed we would find you today and to find two humans or three humans in that part of the world was is more than a needle in a hay stock it just had to be Sovereign almighty God and now he's saying his final words while they were down praying at the garbage cans this heavys set man was kind of nervously speaking he said uh he's tried to commit suicide three times he's been under the care of the army doctors and he said they can't figure out what's wrong with him he has he has a lovely Christian wife and two beautiful children and they just couldn't fig figure out what was wrong with him when we got in our cars brother bandam he just on the little access road and it was rough and brother brandom said to me he said brother ready he said uh you don't know this young man or I said no I don't really he said he's not a good friend of yours I said no I don't know him he said uh not likely you'll ever see him again and I I know I noticed that not likely you'll ever see him again and I said uh no I said he lives in Fairbanks Alaska I live in Victoria British Columbia not likely we'll ever see him again he said now just to help you believe he said if if you knew him if he was a good friend of yours I'd never tell you you but he said when we got to the end of the sidewalk he came to us there I knew exactly what he was talking about he came to us there and told him had a lovely Christian wife and two beautiful children I just heard that 2 three minutes before from his friend that drove him down and I wouldn't be telling this account to you or the world if he'd said he had a a Christian wife and three children but the man told me he had a lovely Christian wife and two children here's brother brandham telling me he has a lovely Christian wife and two children but he had been committing homosexual acts with young men and as soon as he said that he said as soon as that was uncovered Satan lost his power and I I learned a great Truth at that moment that all Satan has to be as exposed once he's exposed he's lost his power now here I come to a very unique part of this whole Ministry that one that was talking and speaking he came to us there that one who said what his problem was that God is timeless he's Eternal and it was 36 years later 36 years later a few years ago uh I was in my study and I came upstairs and my daughter Marilyn our our middle daughter her and her husband Mike had been down to Florida and and had been visiting a church and Pastor brother Bob Brown gave Marilyn a picture and said here give this to your dad I think it may be Northern Canada and he might know something about it so when I came upstairs from study my wife said Marilyn left a picture here for you brother Bob Brown sent it up so I went to the little telephone desk and I'm I'm holding the picture and it's the soldier boy and the man that brought him down from Fairbanks and brother brandom standing between them and I took the picture I couldn't remember taking the picture but I was the only other person except brother chrisberg who wouldn't know how to handle a [Music] camera and I was struck into silence and she and my wife said what is it I couldn't seem to to answer her she said again what is it what is it what is the picture I said it's the soldier boy I said I've got to call Brother Brown so I called him and got him on the phone right away I said brother Brown where did you get this picture he said well I had a young man here in the church he was kind of of a you know he wasn't really stable he didn't seem to be stable he was here and then he would be drifting someplace else I said is he still there no he said he's not here anymore he said and he was working in a with a construction company uh they were building a mall and some people were in there doing the floor and this young guy he was always wanting to witness the somebody so he was talking to this man about brother brandham and he said and the other other fellow said well I've had my picture taken with him and he brought him that picture and brother Bram had said to me not likely you'll ever see him again I tried to make contact with him but I could not I never have seen him since not since that day we in Fort Nelson British CL I and so I begin to realize the timelessness and how something an event will happen but it's not just a single event it just keeps unfolding and unfolding because it's an eternal God and that is the story of the soldier boy [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] on Sunday uh which was the next day after the soldier boy had been called out I was once again on the platform and uh they had a prayer line and uh in that prayer line came a woman well well known to us she was a very dear friend of my parents and I knew her very well her name was uh sister clun her husband they didn't have any children that I know of her husband was a very Stout man and I don't what he uh what he actually did for a living but I believe he worked in the agricultural Department from what we have found out s and so she came up and she just standing and brother brandham says now here is a lady and he begins to speak and uh he said you're very nervous uh he said and you have other complications other problems uh you have I think a spiritual problem as well and he begins to talk to her he said yes you are very nervous he said I see you standing by a window when the sun was setting and you're rubbing your hands and uh then he stops and he's speaking to her but he's also speaking to the congregation speaking to people like myself he's saying now uh and this it means so much to us now he said now who could do that what man could tell you where you were standing and what you were praying and he said and then you prayed that God would help you to get a prayer card and when that prayer card was given to you you were so happy very very happy that you'd received a prayer card and he he asked you know how how could a man know that he wanted the people to see that that was God and the Prophet The Prophet Ministry for a prophet is a spokesman for God it was not just a gift of discernment it was not that but a lot of my friends were tended to believe that it was just maybe a gift of word of knowledge or something it wasn't that he was in both worlds he was in another dimension and he told her where she was standing what her prayer was and how her reaction when she got the prayer card and then he said uh now he said we'll just talk to the lady and he said you have something else now this is what was so striking to to me he said you have something else that's on your heart you're praying for a friend a man that's dying with cancer and they do not live and I noticed he said they do not live because it was him and his wife he said they do not live here they live in Fort St John and I knew Fort St John was just 50 mil up the askan Highway what brother brandham did not know is we were going up the highway I was taking him early the next morning Monday morning up the highway and brother Brandon was preaching on show us the father I thought it was so remarkable he was actually showing the people the father he said who could tell you where you were standing when you prayed no one but almighty God and that you're praying for a friend and he said he's he's dying with cancer yes he said he's a a sinner and he's dying with cancer mentioned it twice and he said uh only believe just believe that seemed to be the key he said take that handkerchief that you have and give it to him and he'll be well I guess she never did get it to him this was the end of May he passed away July the 6th 1961 but of course I didn't know that we we we found that out many years later but the next day I'm in the car and you have to understand I had a lot of questions about brother brandham about his doctr about his ministry but there was one thing that I knew that is the Angel of the Lord was in attendance with him at the platform and now we were having a just a profound effect upon me and other ministers and he said he said as we drove down the highway we started coming to the town of Fort St John which laid up to the right hand of the highway and there was an entrance into Fort St John when the US Army cut just through the Farmland The Farmhouse was just up to the right maybe 100 150 yards and I had noticed that house so many times in my youth and childhood and just a big old white farmhouse and as brother brandom as we he slowed down for the speed limit and was just driving slowly he said there was a woman that came in the prayer line yesterday praying for a man from Fort St John oh I said brother brandham she's a very good friend of my parents her name is sister clunt and I know her well and and I knew her I was there on the on the platform and she was standing there and he was telling her these things now here we are driving and the house is just over here to my right and he said he just serious he he he he was in a different frame of mind you'd say and uh he just said as we were driving past the house was going by so he swung his arm this way and pointed behind my head he said the man is in that house well I was shocked I was startled but I didn't know that the man was in that house I didn't know his name or anything and we we continued on the road up to Fort Nelson and Beyond up to brother bud southw wi's Place brother Bud Southwick was just a new new Christian he had been saved in my church uh about a year before I was so anxious to acquaint him with spiritual things he was just uh he raised horses and he rode in h in the rodeos and things and so he didn't know anything he didn't know Genesis from Revelation he just didn't know the Bible so I wanted to acquaint him with what a prophet was I said when we went by that house I said brother Brandon pointed to it and said the man is in that house I said you know Sister Clint she was on the platform praying for him and and brother Southwick my friend he said oh I know him he's had his name is Ed Thomas I've known him ever since I've been about 8 years old and uh so now I had it on the platform on the highway and with brother South wake this was all within 24 hours it was like a just a divine intervention of God saying I will cause you to believe I will bring it right in front of you I will bring it it was so arranged I just could not doubt it I guess it was the grace of God to me that was anchoring my faith and I just couldn't there was one day and the next day and the next day and I do not know whether it was in that particular service where brother Brenham spoke and all of the service was not taped apparently but anyway I was standing and I'll never forget this I was standing on the platform right beside me on my right hand side was standing brother Paul Cornish the pastor in the church in Grand Prairie and he was he was just standing there was a very he was taller than I was he very dignified very scholarly and uh a man that didn't show a lot of emotion but he was standing there and brother brandham was facing not facing us he had his back to us and to the prayer line was going down the wall this time and up this way and uh while we were just standing there brother Venom I can't explain this this is so strange but he just lifted his head this way and cried out the boy be all right and a force went by me it was like a wind but it wasn't a wind it was just a power a force just went by me but I was conscious of it and and I was bewildered I don't what's happening the boy will be all right and Paul Cornish brother Paul Cornish collapses over and is in convulsing tears and I don't know what's happening here he's the voice the force so unusual while he's just talking to somebody in front of him and uh and and here's brother Paul Cornish what do you do when somebody's you know crying and convulsing I didn't know whether to pray with him or what to do then he straightened up after he collected himself he nudged me and he said brother ready he said you see down the prayer line towards the end said young lad that's standing there he said that's my son and he's up for a serious operation next week and to have to have those kind of things I I just became aware of another realm I became aware of Another Place Another Dimension this man was not just ministering to the people but it was like he was he was in contact with another world the boy will be all right and he just continues on and uh I I don't know anything of the lad what happened after that but I that was just a very very strange and very unusual event uh for me [Music] [Music] h [Music] oh [Music] I was in my home in Victoria British Columbia when I received a phone call from brother brandham and he was saying that I believe we're going to have a good hunt brother Eddie we're going to have a good hunt I had a dream or a vision and he began to tell me a little bit about it and uh said that he would give me the full details when we met so when we met in Dawson Creek he said I had this dream or Vision he said if it was a vision it'll happen exactly like that and in the vision he said there were two or three small fellows on the hunt I had arranged the hunt and there was only three of us including brother brandham brother Bud Southwick brother brandham and myself we were the three brother southwick's son Blaine was not a able to go on the hunt because he was in the far north in the Arctic on a survey crew and would not be able to be back for the hunt well uh so I thought well maybe it was just a dream I don't know but brother brandom said we saw I saw this large animal and its horns kind of went back on its head and I said oh that may be a caribou he said well I don't know I haven't seen a caribou before but he said this was a dark chocolate brown animal I said no I said Caribou are like Battleship Gray and he said well no this was chocolate brown and he wouldn't he wouldn't stray from that description at all it was a dark chocolate brown animal so then uh he said uh there was uh in this in this Vision or dream I saw one of the young men his hands were like this he said and they were spread out he said there was no hair on the arms on the hands he said I would say and he kind of stopped like that looked up he said probably about 18 18 years old now I would like to encourage the viewers to be real attentive to the detail because this Vision was 6 hours in the Fulfillment and uh he said one of my one of my buddies was in a a green checkered shirt well I had had a green checkered shirt and I had told my wife to before the hunt I said just throw that away because it had been tore and sewn several times around here on the pocket my husband was going hunting he had this pretty good shirt green checkered shirt but it had it was torn around the pocket and I had mended it several times and he said go and get me another shirt it was a nice shirt dokin soft nice hunting shirt and I said okay but I just didn't have time I didn't have a car I had the little girls you have to take a bus into town so I mended it again the best I could and I put it into his duffel bag and away he went when we got up to Dawson Creek I asked brother Venom if he would tell the vision to my father so he related the whole Vision that this dark chocolate brown animal and and he had gotten that animal and had gotten another uh a grizzly bear at the same time and for me that was a shock I thought I had lived in the north I had never gotten a grizzly bear myself and I thought that was outstanding and then we journeyed on the way up the Alaskan Highway to brother Bud southwick's place and when we drove into the yard here all the children came came out and including Blaine his son who was supposed to be in the Arctic and I said well your Blaine I thought you were away up and you wouldn't be able to go on this hunt well he said he just came back a couple of days ago and I asked brother Southwick will Blaine be able to come on the hunt well yeah he thought he better come on the hunt with us so suddenly now I saw that we were two or three little fellows on the trip and uh Blaine was fixing a little harness on the side of one of the buildings and I was standing there with him just the two of us and I asked him I said Blain how old are you he said 18 why I said well I was just curious to know now we had a young fellow and he was 18 years old and myself and when brother brandham was giving the Vision I asked him to tell brother Southwick and his family at the supper table tell him about the vision so he got to the dark chocolate brown animal I said brother bud I always thought that Caribou was a dark uh Battleship Gray well he said you know that is strange he said all every Caribou that I've seen on the north side of the highway the Alaskan Highway way has been a kind of a Battleship Gray and he used the same words he said and there are a bush caribou and all the Caribou on the south side and the west of the highway has been uh mountain caribou and they're kind of a dark chocolate brown color and I said well where are we going he said well we're going on the south side of the highway so things were coming together and I there was more weight to it being a vision than there being a dream and I the only thing was a young man with a chocolate or with a checkered shirt and when we got up to make our camp we made our camp and way down the valley it would be to my right we saw that on the skyline there were a few caribou and some Mountain shape and so brother Southwick said well tomorrow I think that we should probably go up there it was probably 2 three miles and uh so the next day we made our way up there and we got up on the Ridge and uh we ran into a few caribou and they scattered and one ran down this way and so I went on my we all split up and Blaine went One Direction and brother brandom and Bud went another Direction and I went One Direction and I found a young caribou and I I was needing meat and I shot that caribou and it was just dark chocolate brown and so Blaine came by and we dressed that Caribou out and then we went back and met together and then we climbed up on a Mountain Ridge and brother Brenham said on this in this Vision there was a great panoramic and he moved his arm this way and he said on this great panoramic and then he says my friend in the checkered shirt was way down this way towards camp and Camp was 2 three miles this Direction and he said he was waiting there and on the way there uh he said I got this large Caribou dark chocolate brown and he said on the way then we saw a grizzly bear on the mountain and God gave me that animal in one shot and I was just kind of speechless and uh then while the vision was being fulfilled we sat on this Ridge and I just looked at this beautiful panoramic I can say that I wasn't really conscious of every detail of the vision but it it was just we were caught up in the in the beauty of the moment and the great mountain peaks on this side on the left side and spurring off onto a ridges and we were ate our LUN on this one Ridge and brother brandham said what is that over there brother bud and he took his binoculars there was two great Caribou animals Bulls laying on a mountain glacier I think laying on a glacier because there was less bugs and there it's very nice and cool and they were laying there and kind of sleeping I I think and so brother Bud laid out a plan and he said well Blaine he said why don't you take brother Eddie and take the horses and go and get his meat and then Journey down this way to this Dry Creek bed and wait for us and we'll come down and meet you so I suggested that we wait till we see if they got this animal which in about another half hour they did and I came up over the Ridge and got this large uh Cariboo bull animal and so then we went and got my meat and we journeyed down here to this Dry Creek bed towards Camp which was strange that morning when we had just left the tent I fell into a creek and I got my my clothes wet and I said to the brothers just wait here and I will run home I'll run back to the tent which was a short very short distance and I I and I opened up my duffel bag and there was this green checkered shirt and when he got up hunting and had that little mishap in the water and had to go back to the tent and open up his bag and there was the green checkered shirt and he said I told Ruth to get me a new shirt and she didn't do it but I didn't know that it was all a part of the vision you just do things without even thinking that there's anything spiritual tied to it and I put it on and that's the shirt I had I had a green checkered shirt the vision and all of the details just it was not in my mind whatsoever I was cold and wet and I changed and and uh then I ran up to catch up with the other brothers and away we went so when we went down to this Dry Creek bed I had on that checkered chir we waited Blaine and I we waited for about half an hour two an hour and Blaine said if they're not here in about another half hour he said I'm going to go and find them and in the vision I was alone waiting for them in another half hour they still weren't there he said so I'm going to go and see if I can meet up with them because we didn't know what had happened we didn't know whether we missed them somehow or whatever so he leaves and now I'm waiting alone and I was waiting about another half hour and then I heard some voices and I just took a few steps to the trail and here came brother Bud carrying this big Caribou on his head on his shoulders rather we come all the way down that cck but I'm packing that Caribou cape in the head you know and he kept watching for this this grizzly well you know it was like looking on the side of that Hill up there only he want that bush on it you know just that Short Grass it was just no bear there that's all and all all at once we getting for near to where you guys was and I'd give give it up really you see a Grizzly you know finally we were sitting down resting again and he pointed up there on the side the hill and he said what what's that up there he knew what I didn't soon as I glimpsed up there I knew it was the bear so I said you know and it was a silver tip and it was about the same color as an old R milk cow I had and I said man M looks like my own mil yeah up went when he said he would shoot it you know to me it was like him shooting from here up to the top of that Cliff up there or better better than that I had no idea he he would shoot that far and I I I wouldn't have let anybody else shoot that far anyway you know they could have crippled something R all but but we had no time to to go around and come up from the back of that mountain it took us a day and so I said to him I said we'll have to let that bear go tonight come back after him tomorrow we can't get you can't get any closer this way he looking right down at us and oh he said I I can kill him here he said I doubted that really cuz I hadn't seen him you know shoot that much that carriable we right on top of that when he shot that boy when he shot that old bear just was coming he he pulled that gun up and it sna man my hair stood right up that was after the first shot yeah that bear was coming he fell oh he that big big popper over there from us like and right even with us like that too he fell in that short Shank to go there so I said you watch him and all go over and see all dead is so he did but he was dead as could be you fell and another thing he said he said that going to be too late we wouldn't skin that bear out that night well I never dreamt you know leaving the trophy overnight you old bear could have come along tore that all the pieces but that's the first thing we thought about you know leave it leave it till tomorrow every every word that he said come just as true as true could be the pth you know you never even thought about it at the time but you thinking of it afterward I ran up to brother brandham brother Bram was standing there I said I put my hand out to shake his hand I said congratulations brother brandom that's that's a lovely animal he said uh I got a bear too and I just tapped him on the shoulder I said oh you didn't get a bear the same day he said yeah I did and I I felt strange I said well where is it and Bud said well we're not able to carry it he said the hide would probably wear three weigh 300 lb and I said well and I felt real strange and Bud walked over to his saddle horse which which was right there and went into the saddle bag and brought out a little round tape with a push button on the side and I was kind of amused I had lived in the wilderness all my life and had hunted and never saw anybody carry a tape and then I thought well he's a guide now probably he's interested in you know the size of the horns Etc and he brought out this little steel tape and he put it right down at the base of the horns there a little Ridge there and he hooked the tape there and then the tape went into this curve and then around and every time he started to go around the bottom flicked out and then it so he started it again and followed it around trying to measure it correctly and it flicked out about the third time he says to a son Blaine hold that tape in there and so Blaine knelt down on one knee and spread his hands Out 18yearold Boy and then I I begin to feel real strange held his hands out and brother Bud pulled the tape around and brother brandham said in the vision he just heard a voice saying it's 42 Ines and that was it and I I put my head Blaine looked up while he was holding the tape brother Bud he held his head over the tape to make sure where the black line and the black line of 42 in fell at the last point of the horn and he said it's 42 in and I I just felt overwhelmed and brother brandham he did not look he just stood there ereck and I was right B on his shoulder and he just said he said there it is it was all over and the grizzly was laying up on the mountain and there there the horn was and the vision was over that took about 6 hours in total for the whole Vision a dark chocolate brown animal and uh I'm standing there in a green checkered chart and uh the vision was completely fulfilled and I can say to all who hear this is a true report everything is true absolutely true [Music]
