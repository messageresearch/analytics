[35:25] right okay I think we're okay waters are
[35:28] calm clear
[35:31] skies nice
[35:33] clouds might be raining pretty
[35:37] soon so my first lesson of the day is
[35:40] the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a
[35:44] net that a fisherman threw
[35:49] out and this is called The Gospel
[35:54] net and when you throw out the
[35:56] net pull that puppy
[35:59] in pull that Hush Puppy
[36:02] in you like that one huh you don't have
[36:05] to laugh at all my
[36:07] jokes so why don't you go stand over
[36:09] there and tell me what's in that net and
[36:11] let your your friends see what we caught
[36:15] today a shark you caught a shark yeah oh
[36:19] get rid of
[36:21] it the last one ate off my toe got Gang
[36:26] Green octopus
[36:28] an octopus an
[36:30] octopus yeah let's not throw that one
[36:33] okay those are good eating okay I like
[36:35] them raw a shark again a shark again hey
[36:39] no no no don't throw that one that one's
[36:41] a sand shark he'll bite their
[36:44] fingers this one we got a sea turtle now
[36:47] we got all kinds of Little Critters
[36:49] let's just throw them back in the water
[36:50] we don't want all of them a crab all we
[36:52] want to catch today is the fish why fish
[36:56] that's was sorry guys give giveways are
[36:58] over all about crab oh yeah that's
[37:02] pretty good eating too yeah keep that
[37:03] one in the back we'll keep I want this
[37:06] one yeah that's a little baby little
[37:08] baby gator just let it back in the water
[37:11] here
[37:13] okay oh here come the
[37:17] seagulls about Wiz they'll eat anything
[37:19] you throw them all about wizard yeah we
[37:22] got a
[37:23] lizard all right so we got a couple good
[37:26] fish here I
[37:28] all
[37:29] right very good so we caught a whole
[37:32] bunch of lizards whole bunch of snakes
[37:35] how about a humpback how'd you catch a
[37:37] humpback I don't know it's a baby
[37:40] humpback we're going to put you on the
[37:42] best pro fishing channel boy catches a
[37:45] humpback with a with a net wouldn't you
[37:48] ever think of that do the humpback yeah
[37:50] we'll keep the hump back okay it's not
[37:53] tasty all right so come over here let's
[37:56] take inventory so we caught some lizards
[38:00] okay but we better go we caught some
[38:02] snakes snakes are poisonous but they're
[38:05] not poison I think we got a little
[38:07] couple spiders spiders are scary and
[38:11] that's just the way it is when you throw
[38:12] out the net you never know what you're
[38:14] going to catch like lobsters and a f but
[38:17] the scripture
[38:19] says you take all the good and you let
[38:22] all the bad ones go why cuz that's the
[38:25] way the gospel works too all our job is
[38:28] as fishermen is we just throw it out we
[38:30] tell them that Jesus died for you and if
[38:33] they're good guess what what they're
[38:35] going to hang on in that
[38:37] net and if they're bad guess what what
[38:41] they're going to hang on in that
[38:43] net but when we see that it's not
[38:45] something we want it's just going to get
[38:48] thrown back in the water but the gospel
[38:51] catches everybody and that's what we're
[38:53] thankful
[38:54] for so did you see God in that
[38:58] hey
[39:02] see all right
[39:04] okay so I got another lesson for you
[39:08] what's the lesson come over
[39:11] here I like to do this every day when I
[39:14] come over here come around don't hit
[39:16] your head on that cloud look at look at
[39:19] those starfish that's so these
[39:24] starfish they get washed up on the shore
[39:26] every even
[39:27] evening and the thing is if we don't
[39:31] help them they're going to dry up here
[39:34] and they're going to die and there's
[39:36] thousands of them look at them
[39:38] all don't you guys see them
[39:42] yeah what I like to do is I get me one
[39:46] and I throw it back in the
[39:49] water go trying to stay here sometimes
[39:53] they don't know their own good and they
[39:55] want to stay on the shore
[39:58] help us throw them
[40:00] guys let's get them back in the ocean we
[40:03] don't want them to dry
[40:06] up if they
[40:09] do they're going to be dry crusty
[40:14] stars get out of here get out of here
[40:18] all right what what does it matter oh
[40:22] what does it matter there's too many of
[40:24] them well it does matter
[40:28] see they're all helping
[40:30] us like little ministers getting all the
[40:32] people back where they need to
[40:37] be all right why doesn't everybody grab
[40:39] a starfish and go sit down
[40:43] immediately like
[40:48] yesterday oh he got broke in the mix
[40:52] I'll take that
[40:54] one find one you like and you can take
[40:56] them home you don't have to feed
[40:59] them just make sure they don't end up in
[41:01] your mom's
[41:08] washer oh thank you he has a broken limb
[41:12] oh I'll hold on to him thank
[41:18] you so you asked me a an interesting
[41:21] question what did you ask me
[41:27] got it you said what's the use there's
[41:29] so many of them what does it matter
[41:33] what's use there's too many of them what
[41:35] does it matter well it matters to the
[41:37] one that's in your hand like
[41:40] this yeah yeah there might be a lot of
[41:44] them but if you just save one that's
[41:47] what's
[41:48] important so the very one that you're
[41:50] able to save it matters to that
[41:53] one why did you
[41:57] so let's get back in the
[42:07] [Music]
[42:09] boat did everybody get to save a
[42:12] starfish hold your starfish in the air
[42:15] Whoever has the gold star on the back of
[42:18] your starfish gets
[42:21] $100 actually there's not one that has
[42:25] one I just wanted to get you
[42:31] excited okay so our main
[42:35] lesson is that we saw God today Micah
[42:39] the lesson is that when you get God in
[42:42] here you can see him in everything you
[42:44] do oh if you're fishing okay if you're
[42:49] with your mom at the store okay or if
[42:52] you're at school okay walking your dog
[42:56] oh
[42:57] you can see God in everything okay but
[43:01] you got to get him in here first but you
[43:04] can see him and he's working through his
[43:06] people look around here look at your
[43:10] neighbor and say hello Jesus hello
[43:15] Jesus hello Jesus you see it is true God
[43:18] is a spirit but he has to live in human
[43:21] beings he has to operate through us so
[43:25] we see the the pastor
[43:27] okay when you see your grandfather okay
[43:30] when you see the Sunday school teacher
[43:33] okay that is Jesus speaking to you okay
[43:37] no you say amen amen can everybody say
[43:41] amen amen
[43:45] wow you're going to rock my boat that
[43:48] was a close one
[43:50] though all right I think we have a song
[43:53] to go with this yes we do let's hear
[43:57] that beautiful
[44:01] [Music]
[44:08] song the Greeks come one time and said
[44:11] sir we would see Jesus and they was
[44:14] granted that privilege and tonight Lord
[44:16] we want to see you too it's our heart's
[44:19] desire no one can ever hear of you
