[36:23] that will result from those things
[36:27] because we can do a lot of things but we
[36:29] can't pray too much
[36:34] so with that connesto um let's move on
[36:36] into the words
[36:47] and we sure have quite a a thing today
[36:52] telling brother henry the minute you
[36:54] start reading god's word
[36:59] it's like you just go to the store for
[37:01] for a uh or a loaf of bread yes
[37:05] but you go ahead and uh get your loaf of
[37:07] bread and butter
[37:09] pan and you then you get to get uh a
[37:12] meat
[37:12] lego carne and then you get avocado and
[37:15] then you get uh
[37:16] all the things and before you know it
[37:19] you got your basket full
[37:30] his blessings are abundant more than we
[37:32] can contain
[37:40] our scripture that we'll read to start
[37:42] with if you'll stand for the
[37:43] to honor the reading of god's word
[37:48] it is hebrews
[37:56] and god's word reads like this wherefore
[37:59] seeing
[38:00] we also are compassed about with so
[38:02] great a cloud of witnesses
[38:09] let us lay aside every weight
[38:13] and the sin which that so easily beset
[38:16] us
[38:31] who for the joy that was set before him
[38:34] endured the cross
[38:39] despising the shame and is set down at
[38:43] the right hand of the throne of god
[38:47] for considering him that endured such
[38:49] contradiction of sinners against himself
[38:54] lest we be wearied and faint in your
[38:57] minds
[39:26] just bring a little glass of water to
[39:28] somebody that might be thirsty
[39:32] you know time and days and days go by
[39:38] there's always somebody that brings me a
[39:39] little glass of water
[39:50] there's always somebody there to bring
[39:51] that to us
[39:54] and today with the lord jesus we would
[39:56] like to do that for you today
[40:02] so many of us are suffering
[40:05] i wouldn't even begin to know what to
[40:07] say
[40:09] but the only thing that i can say this
[40:11] morning is that god's word is true
[40:15] it is sufficient this morning for
[40:17] whatever we're going through in life
[40:21] i'm not interested this morning in
[40:23] religion
[40:25] and i've grown tired of man's words
[40:30] but i am interested this morning
[40:34] i'm convinced i'm concerned
[41:03] if you need power it's in his word
[41:07] if you need the holy ghost it's in his
[41:08] word
[41:11] if you need assurance it's in his word
[41:14] and when we receive god's word
[41:18] we get all of these things and so what
[41:21] more can we want today
[41:24] the last several months have brought the
[41:27] world to its knees under the weight of
[41:29] affliction
[41:46] there have been big changes
[41:49] in a short period of time and yet
[41:52] no change at the same time
[41:55] the research of infections
[41:58] has seemed to move the world backwards
[42:02] but in all those things you gotta find a
[42:05] little humor here and there i can go
[42:07] through i'll go to you more
[42:08] yeah i'd like to share with you
[42:09] something that's a little bit funny
[42:13] help us relax
[42:29] protest political unrest
[42:32] political people anxious for the 2020
[42:34] presidential elections
[42:38] in hopes that they'll get something
[42:40] better esperanto
[42:48] [Music]
[43:07] and all those people that didn't think
[43:09] homeschool was a good idea
[43:24] we've been spending the last several
[43:26] months in delay after delay
[43:31] all the world's powers are on delay
[43:35] and i'm not saying this to be funny you
[43:37] know
[43:38] but so those things aren't funny
[43:44] but this is the funny part the other day
[43:49] somebody people are totally stressed out
[43:51] right
[43:53] and i'll tell you what if you don't if
[43:54] you're not standing on the rock of ages
[43:56] you are
[43:57] going to be totally stressed out
[44:02] somebody that was real stressed out came
[44:03] up to me
[44:06] he told me
[44:20] i laughed
[44:31] the only thing that's predictable about
[44:33] our monsoon seasons in new mexico
[44:48] those of you that don't know what
[44:49] monsoons are because maybe you're not
[44:51] from here from the southwest of the
[44:52] united states
[44:56] monsoon season we're not like the rest
[44:58] of the world we don't get a lot of rain
[44:59] all the time
[45:02] we live once a year from the south
[45:06] from the gulf it comes in
[45:10] [Music]
[45:11] a the storm fronts and they carry with
[45:13] them what we call monsoonal rains
[45:17] [Music]
[45:19] and most of our rain comes at this time
[45:23] but if you try to predict that and don't
[45:26] ever make a bet on what monsoon is going
[45:27] to bring
[45:32] but in all this it has become clear es
[45:35] claro that we can't depend
[45:36] on ourselves but god has all matters
[45:40] under his
[45:43] control including your delayed amazon
[45:46] orders
[45:46] including amazon amen
[45:49] this message this morning is very simple
[45:51] estimate
[45:53] but it's something that's helped me we
[45:56] have
[45:56] been fighting for a long time
[46:29] all those things are the full armor we
[46:31] can't afford to take them off
[46:34] and i know we get tired but i've been
[46:38] inspired by the thought of endurance
[46:46] endurance and the life of a christian is
[46:48] essential
[46:52] we'll get into into that about why in a
[46:54] little bit vamos ave del porque
[46:56] but if you don't get anything else
[47:00] jesus said this jesus in matthew chapter
[47:03] 24
[47:04] verses 12 and 13.
[47:08] and because iniquity shall abound
[47:12] the love of many shall wax called mucho
[47:16] but he that shall endure unto the end
[47:19] perseverance the same shall be saved
[47:24] amen amen can you say amen to the lord
[47:26] jesus christ
[47:29] endurance is not something you ever
[47:31] associate good
[47:32] times
[47:37] you never hear somebody saying
[47:41] man i had to have a lot of endurance
[47:45] to drive my new car all day long
[47:48] oh my goodness the air conditioner on
[47:50] that thing is so cold i had to wear a
[47:52] sweater
[47:56] you never hear anybody say man it was a
[47:58] a real test of endurance to
[48:01] to finish that ribeye steak
[48:04] wanted
[48:13] you never hear anybody say it took a lot
[48:15] of endurance to
[48:16] to have a a binge night on on netflix
[48:25] to watch movies all night man i had to
[48:28] endure a lot for that
[48:31] never heard anybody say that two-week
[48:32] vacation took some endurance
[48:40] with all those hotels
[48:46] and the eating out and entertainment
[48:51] i just wanted it all to end
[48:54] endurance isn't something you think of
[48:56] in in terms of good
[48:58] el aguantes
[49:02] but there's a mystery in it but are you
[49:03] my stereotype because even though you
[49:05] don't think of it in terms of good
[49:06] but endurance is good
[49:13] endurance is a test of limits
[49:16] it's a struggle to finish something
[49:21] the endurance efforts
[49:26] they exhaust the body a complete
[49:34] endurance is usually tied to anything
[49:36] opposite of good
[49:39] part
[49:56] you don't endure
[50:10] you don't endure
[50:23] that is what god requires
[50:38] it takes away the weariness and
[50:40] faintness of our minds
[50:46] that's what we just read in hebrews
[50:50] because when we consider what our lord
[50:52] did to endure sin but
[50:56] it takes away the weariness
[50:59] and faintness of our mind
[51:04] endurance god
[51:25] there are 12 that describe god's
[51:27] endurance
[51:31] there's 12 of them that means for every
[51:34] day of the
[51:41] we're not going to get to all 12 of them
[51:42] today
[51:44] but we'll get as far as we can
[51:48] at least we're going to read them all
[51:50] these are so refreshing
[51:53] we pray that this refreshes you this
[51:54] morning
[51:57] there these are the examples
[52:00] of what we should do or do to endure
[52:43] his righteous judgment
[52:59] to take away our weariness and our
[53:01] faintness in our minds
[53:05] are you ready for the first one
[53:06] established let's turn to the
[53:09] to the book of psalms nine verse seven
[53:12] capital and this is the lord
[53:16] shall endure
[53:19] but the lord shall endure forever
[53:25] he had prepared his throne for judgment
[53:32] forever
[53:36] now as we just said this isn't always
[53:38] talking this isn't talking about
[53:39] something that's so good
[53:43] this isn't talking about god's eternal
[53:46] state and perfection
[53:51] this is talking about a struggle
[53:54] it's talking
[54:08] how would you like to fight right
[54:10] alongside
[54:12] the lord of hosts this morning
[54:17] question is how long will the lord
[54:18] endure
[54:34] because he cried it is
[54:50] but i do have a question for you
[54:53] then why does the lord endure
[54:57] as the bible says why does he struggle
[55:01] why does he still suffer because god's
[55:05] long suffering is salvation
[55:11] his will is that none would be lost
[55:16] because although he saved you
[55:22] [Applause]
[55:32] our
[55:50] how long will the lord endure in my life
[55:52] and in your life
[55:55] till it is finished oh my what an
[55:59] assurance we have this morning
[56:02] to know that i can't be lost
[56:06] because my god my lord
[56:10] he is still enduring for me
[56:14] still enduring for you this morning
[56:20] i need to endure
[56:23] example that he has given us
[56:27] we need to fight the good fight
[56:42] and we carry
[56:56] and now you fight the good fight
[56:59] right alongside the lord of hosts
[57:05] and you endure amen can you wave your
[57:08] hands and say thank you jesus
[57:22] and it says like this or his
[57:25] anger endureth forever
[57:33] did we read that right
[57:37] no no we did not read that
[57:41] we didn't read that right rewind
[57:46] for his anger endureth but a moment
[57:51] in his favor is life
[57:58] weeping may endure for a night
[58:02] but joy cometh in the morning
[58:06] oh my i want to live in his favor this
[58:09] morning
[58:11] or in his favor there is life
[58:15] i don't merit his favor but i thank him
[58:19] that his love projects to me pero
[58:46] his anger isn't like our anger is
[59:02] but
[59:16] forgot
[59:44] is
[59:54] one day with goddess is a thousand years
[59:58] have you ever picked up the phone
[1:00:01] and you call you said yama you want to
[1:00:03] get technical support
[1:00:05] technically you say uh please be on hold
[1:00:10] for a moment especially because we're
[1:00:12] experiencing high call volumes
[1:00:16] well sometimes god is very busy
[1:00:19] and we might get him in a blink of an
[1:00:23] eye
[1:00:26] and we might have to wait for 25 years
[1:00:30] but his anger only lasts a moment
[1:00:35] what a lesson we learned from that
[1:00:38] we get angry and the bible
[1:00:41] says to anger but to sin not
[1:00:46] but all too often our anger endures
[1:00:48] forever
[1:00:52] we just don't let things go you know we
[1:01:34] so why should ours endure forever
[1:01:51] if you think you've been in the holy of
[1:01:52] holies
[1:01:55] we got to stop playing the blame game
[1:02:00] let your anger have an expiration date
[1:03:13] believe me brothers and sisters i'm
[1:03:14] taking
[1:03:29] so that we can put on the mind of christ
[1:03:32] let's go to the next one the next one
[1:03:36] is the goodness of god like i said
[1:03:40] a lot of this goodness doesn't sound so
[1:03:42] good
[1:03:46] psalms 52 verse 1
[1:03:50] there's a note in my bible i don't know
[1:03:52] if it's there in yours
[1:03:55] but this is uh this is david this is
[1:03:58] david
[1:03:58] you're the chief musician
[1:04:04] this is the psalm of david when doug the
[1:04:07] edomite came to and told saul when
[1:05:18] and he also gave david goliath sword
[1:05:35] he didn't have any any room to bring
[1:05:37] weapons
[1:05:39] so when he went to the priest the priest
[1:05:40] gave him goliath's sword
[1:05:45] out of the rage when dog
[1:05:48] told saul of this
[1:05:52] saul ordered the soldiers
[1:05:57] to kill the priesthood to destroy them
[1:06:02] but this is what a soldier does a
[1:06:05] soldier when son when the trumpet gives
[1:06:07] an uncertain sound
[1:06:10] the bible says my sheep know my voice
[1:06:15] stranger's voice they will not
[1:07:42] that's a spirit that we see working in
[1:07:44] the world today
[1:07:47] it's a spirit of rage
[1:07:51] i've ever seen rage in my life
[1:08:20] oh we might say well we're gonna do this
[1:08:22] and we're gonna do that
[1:08:25] all these things we can do that's not a
[1:08:28] war strategy
[1:08:30] i'll tell you this if you're planning to
[1:08:33] do things in your own mind
[1:08:39] do we think we're going to win based on
[1:08:41] the good things that we do
[1:08:45] that is a recipe for defeat
[1:08:49] but if you want our strategy for victory
[1:08:51] this morning
[1:08:53] the goodness of god endureth continually
[1:08:59] as these chargers they gain their
[1:09:01] strength
[1:09:04] god's
[1:09:27] who's gonna fear guinness those two
[1:09:30] hundred thousand
[1:09:30] thousand demon chargers
[1:09:47] he'll they'll fear the name of the lord
[1:09:49] from the west
[1:09:51] and his glory from the rising of the sun
[1:09:55] glory when the enemy shall come in like
[1:09:57] a flood
[1:09:59] the spirit of the lord shall lift up a
[1:10:01] standard against him
[1:10:05] we lift up that standard today
[1:10:10] that's what doug wanted he wanted to do
[1:10:14] something
[1:10:26] that he wouldn't sell all that he had
[1:10:28] and would wouldn't give
[1:10:42] what
[1:11:52] he still holds both of them in his hand
[1:11:56] but it's his goodness that matters
[1:11:59] important doesn't matter how good we are
[1:12:04] his goodness that matters this morning
[1:12:17] we're complaining against his goodness
[1:12:19] when we do
[1:12:20] encounters
[1:12:30] and then everything give the king of
[1:12:32] kings all the praises
[1:12:36] my goodness the clock is going faster
[1:12:38] than i am
[1:12:41] that's okay i'm not going to keep you
[1:12:42] over an hour today
[1:12:45] but we want to get to another one
[1:12:54] i got to see what things we're going to
[1:12:55] get to
[1:12:58] okay psalms 20 psalms 72 17
[1:13:02] en salmo
[1:13:10] his name shall endure forever
[1:13:15] his name shall be continuing as long as
[1:13:18] the sun
[1:13:22] and men shall be blessed in him
[1:13:26] all nations shall call him blessed
[1:13:30] be
[1:13:39] scripturally his name is the lord jesus
[1:13:42] christ
[1:13:45] and this morning he is the same
[1:13:47] yesterday and today and forever
[1:13:48] yesterday
[1:13:51] we are healed in the name of the lord
[1:13:53] jesus christ
[1:13:56] we are saved it's almost
[1:14:12] we go from victory to victory
[1:14:16] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:14:19] his name shall be continued
[1:14:22] we are blessed with his name the bride
[1:14:26] doesn't do anything
[1:14:28] and her name is because she is in him
[1:14:32] and anything that we ask in the name of
[1:14:36] the lord jesus christ
[1:14:40] my name
[1:15:15] in the name of the lord jesus christ if
[1:15:18] that pertains to you this morning
[1:15:20] raise your hand and in the name of the
[1:15:22] lord christ
[1:15:23] it is already done just accept it and
[1:15:26] receive it in his name
[1:15:28] this is the gospel it is god's word
[1:15:32] it's power it has the holy ghost
[1:15:36] and what a
[1:15:56] oh my goodness praise the lord
[1:16:00] i've got about eight or ten more minutes
[1:16:42] but all the scriptures have a compound
[1:16:43] meaning
[1:16:46] real son
[1:17:01] the jews told him it took it took
[1:17:02] solomon 46 years
[1:17:04] old to build this temple
[1:17:08] and you're going to build it in three
[1:17:09] days
[1:17:12] and and the real son of david
[1:17:30] for god to tear himself
[1:17:35] from the very body that he created that
[1:17:37] had no sin
[1:17:42] and to
[1:17:56] let
[1:18:10] that's the eternal
[1:18:22] was exhausted
[1:18:35] he had physically and mentally reached
[1:18:37] his limit physically
[1:18:53] god's will
[1:18:56] begin to try to tear away god's language
[1:19:00] tried to tear away god's endurance
[1:19:04] god's will would be that none would be
[1:19:06] lost
[1:19:19] when he saw the scene in the vision
[1:19:22] he wept because no fan no man was found
[1:19:26] worthy
[1:19:29] at that moment jesus cried as a man
[1:19:32] jesus
[1:19:33] father
[1:19:38] and at that moment in this moment satan
[1:19:40] by all rights
[1:19:43] as a near kinsman
[1:19:46] had his hands ready to
[1:20:03] hermano mayor the lamb of god el
[1:20:05] corderon he stepped forth
[1:20:07] el salvador and he took the book
[1:20:10] and he said nevertheless
[1:20:13] nevertheless father father i don't rely
[1:20:16] on my own will
[1:20:18] no repository i'm not relying on my own
[1:20:21] will lord no repository
[1:20:23] that's what satan could never have
[1:20:27] that the real son of david has today
[1:20:44] he died more at gethsemane
[1:20:48] than when he then what he died on
[1:20:50] golgotha
[1:20:52] because there in gethsemane he died to
[1:20:56] his own will
[1:21:13] what a lesson there's so much more to
[1:21:16] say
[1:21:18] but maybe you feel torn today
[1:21:22] that's okay we get torn
[1:21:40] down and it'll be lost
[1:21:46] but like the real son of david
[1:21:49] if we rely on god's will
[1:21:53] even if our temple gets torn down
[1:21:59] even if our temple gets torn down
[1:22:03] we have the power within us
[1:22:07] to our lord jesus christ
[1:22:10] raise it back up again
[1:22:13] the same spirit that raised up jesus
[1:22:21] the same spirit spirit that raised up
[1:22:24] christ from the dead
[1:22:26] will also quicken your mortal body
[1:22:35] i can already feel the weariness leaving
[1:22:36] my mind
[1:23:04] take these scriptures and apply them
[1:23:07] let me let me read them to you because
[1:23:10] i'm be
[1:23:10] because i'm done but i i this would be
[1:23:13] good for you to go and

[1:23:59] now let me let me read you the
[1:24:01] scriptures that we didn't get too
