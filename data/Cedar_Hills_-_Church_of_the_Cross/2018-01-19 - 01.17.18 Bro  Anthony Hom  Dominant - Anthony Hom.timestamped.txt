[39:14] we use this blood as an excuse screw you
[39:16] someone's angry come on let's go sir I

[39:27] tonight but I want to say this about you
[39:28] are you really under the blood we
[39:30] element the stomach with a la sangre
[39:35] knowing that the old testament Servian
[39:38] who kill people to cementum is a type in
[39:40] a shadow of the new testament people
[39:42] swim better than with the cement we know
[39:44] that there are waters of separation oh
[39:45] sorry mascara i was a cephalus young I
[39:49] mean know of the waters the separation
[39:51] month or something unless I was a self
[39:52] honestly there was a perfect sacrifice
[39:53] that was made a v1 second if this was
[39:55] perfect looking for hecho a red heifer
[39:57] una vaca better Mecca and that red
[40:02] heifer was perfect yourself over time
[40:04] and up affect other random calls it a
[40:06] perfect sacrifice a type of Christ and
[40:09] my bromley same perfect with a
[40:11] sacrificial when people that crystal
[40:12] theirs was cedar wood a via Miletus he
[40:16] turned that was the cross cared on a
[40:18] cruise and scarlet he's reluctant type
[40:21] of his blood when people sangria
[40:23] those elements elemental they were
[40:25] burned 20 models and they were putting
[40:27] clean water if the Asus a nice wooden
[40:29] poisonous and I was and that blood yes a
[40:32] Sunday and that body yes sir well plan
[40:34] that cross yes the crews was put in
[40:36] clean water
[40:37] we're putting push this and I would
[40:39] anybody equal get I came into the
[40:41] congregation ever you can mean and
[40:43] throwing like um getting us you had to
[40:44] be sprinkled with these waters of
[40:46] separation encased Rochelle OpenSSL was
[40:49] astir policy oh and it's sprinkled them
[40:51] asean allowed them to come in helos a
[40:53] hurricane iran but the trouble is thrown
[40:56] a pro-level
[40:56] doesn't stop there nobody and many time
[40:59] which others we are comfortable double
[41:01] school go model and we are satisfy some
[41:04] most of the spectrum somebody puts the
[41:06] word together really pull it up a lot of
[41:08] an angle plus the body together face
[41:12] maybe our second official kisser
[41:14] and the preacher comes out and pedagogy
[41:16] honey sprinkles us on Wednesday p.m.
[41:19] Chinese sprinkles us on Sundays and
[41:21] miracles you'll do me are satisfy
[41:23] satisfy our consciences are clear you
[41:26] know trust consensus and him pete
[41:29] williams don't stop there you can be
[41:32] justified costa rica you can be baptized
[41:34] but you can be sanctified santificado
[41:37] but it doesn't stop there nor Obara
[41:40] there is something more like you need
[41:42] necesita is a type there's some people
[41:45] in those waters of separation there's
[41:48] nothing that you have to do for it
[41:57] the waters are blessed and i thank god
[42:05] for that you need to do
[42:19] I believe that Christianity because up
[42:29] to that point it doesn't require you to
[42:31] do any but you have a mental consent
[43:02] there's something else that's needed by
[43:04] Old Testament tells us type the
[43:07] mythology said if you had to take your
[43:09] own sacrifice they get the much who
[43:11] professed you be still you might have
[43:13] gone to water and that sacrifice a
[43:19] sacrifice to those elements were already
[43:22] consumed necessary mental called
[43:24] tomorrow's but there's something else
[43:25] you need take a sacrifice to make a
[43:31] sacrifice yourself you have to say to
[43:45] the priest on the sacrificial and you're
[44:02] confessed just like okay Lord Senor I
[44:05] know I've done wrong you're sick Easter
[44:07] man I know that I've stolen Loyalsock a
[44:10] true I know that I've killed lawyers to
[44:12] get my phone but Lord Jesus I know that
[44:14] that was wrong because was pro se kiss
[44:16] with women and I know that your law
[44:18] requires death yo sir case the later
[44:20] Karen worth it what we do wrong look at
[44:22] someone's mother requires death but get
[44:24] him what that is the penalty the wages
[44:28] of sin is death
[44:30] those Camino say that because his mother
[44:33] and his law requires death EULA later to
[44:35] kill him one thing but this sacrifice
[44:36] for us to sacrifice something that you
[44:38] have to do is that you can spit in it
[44:40] something that you have to know who's
[44:42] Lucas I know there's a pardon for you in
[44:45] a case of a Kaos a sparrow not oh and
[44:47] there's something you have to do to
[44:49] accept the pardon yellow container
[44:51] cassette but up but neither side is up
[44:53] push the pedal you know and you have to
[44:55] put your hands on that sacrifice who
[44:57] stepped any component Manos over in a
[44:58] second if you have to tell the Lord EVC
[45:01] lesson you I'm sorry Lord Jesus autumn
