[24:22] you know it
[24:24] i don't know why it's so hard to admit
[24:26] it
[24:27] when being honest is the only way to fix
[24:30] it
[24:31] there's no failure no fault there's no
[24:33] sin you don't already know
[24:36] so let the truth

[24:40] [Music]
[24:49] there's a sign on the door just come as
[24:51] you are but i doubt it
[24:56] cause if we live i thought it's true

[25:44] you know it
[25:45] i don't know why it's so hard to admit
[25:48] it
[25:48] when being honest is the only way to fix
[25:51] it
[25:52] there's no failure no fault there's no
[25:55] sin you don't already know
[25:58] so let the truth
[26:01] can i really stand here unashamed
[26:04] knowing that knowing that your love for
[26:07] me won't
[26:08] change god if that's really true then
[26:12] let
[26:13] the
[26:14] truth be
[26:15] told

[30:18] foreign
[30:22] [Music]
[30:48] [Music]
[30:59] is
[31:00] [Music]
[31:18] amen god bless you this morning
[31:22] we are always as we say
[31:25] we are very happy to be in the house of
[31:26] the lord
[31:30] and we know many
[31:44] we never want this to become common to
[31:47] us
[31:50] it's renewed every day
[31:53] amen we want to first of all give our
[31:55] condolences to
[31:56] our brother reece
[32:04] and then we also want to give our
[32:05] condolences to sister andrea
[32:09] andrea and her family on the passing of
[32:11] father
[32:17] [Music]
[32:33] [Music]
[32:39] you know
[32:49] but we'll get as far as the holy spirit
[32:50] tells us
[32:53] luke 24 25
[33:09] and it reads like this then he said unto
[33:11] them a false
[33:14] slaw of heart
[33:15] to believe all
[33:17] that the prophets have spoken
[33:25] i want you to notice here jesus doesn't
[33:27] call them fools for not believing all
[33:30] that god has spoken
[33:36] but
[33:51] you'll never understand
[33:52] the mechanics and the dynamics
[33:56] that is our subtitle today the mechanics
[33:59] and the dynamics
[34:02] one more scripture matthew 11.
[34:07] 12-13
[34:17] and it reads like this and from the days
[34:19] of john the baptist until now
[34:22] the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence
[34:25] and the violent
[34:26] they take it by foreign
[34:34] amen may god add his blessings to the
[34:36] reading of his word this morning
[34:40] i'm really hot and embarrassed you may
[34:41] be seated
[34:44] is it warm up here is it me
[34:46] it's warm huh
[34:50] okay you just turned them off
[34:52] all right well
[34:53] i understand we're gonna make everybody
[34:55] happy
[34:57] the other day we're so hot and most
[34:59] people
[35:24] sometimes look at that as a as a
[35:25] negative a negative words
[35:40] one that forces the issue
[35:55] it is somebody that is energetic
[35:58] okay do we have anybody here
[36:01] that's that is a forcer okay
[36:04] anybody here
[36:07] a lot of people aren't
[36:10] just kick back
[36:25] they take it by force
[36:28] those of you that know the scriptures
[36:31] you know that the word that they take it
[36:33] by force
[36:35] is the same greek word that means cut
[36:38] away
[36:51] what is this force that it is talking
[36:53] about
[36:56] it comes to our understanding of knowing
[36:58] that this force is the mechanics and the
[37:00] dynamics
[37:04] you can put up there the the two words
[37:06] mechanics but put mechanics first
[37:10] just for you to to as we settle into
[37:13] this message
[37:15] mechanics is the machinery or the
[37:17] working parts of something
[37:19] is
[37:26] because everything that there is it's
[37:28] always there is
[37:30] and we want to really hit the word the
[37:31] machinery
[37:34] interesting
[37:48] all
[38:00] it's the practicalities or details of
[38:03] something practical
[38:06] now the dynamics now on the other hand
[38:10] they go together you can't find that
[38:13] but the dynamics is the branch of
[38:15] mechanics
[38:26] or the dynamics then is also would be
[38:29] known as the
[38:30] forces
[38:32] which stimulate growth
[38:36] development
[38:37] or change
[38:39] within a system or process
[38:43] but you get that
[38:56] our whole future
[38:58] rests
[39:04] we many times we think about mechanics
[39:07] and dynamics which is the best
[39:09] mechanical dynamics and we we say it and
[39:11] we go through it and all
[39:13] the mechanics and the dynamics
[39:16] but but we have to really get what it is
[39:19] and what he's talking about
[39:22] because as human beings
[39:24] whenever we think about the mechanics of
[39:26] something
[39:28] we always think about all the parts
[39:32] the steps
[39:33] into making something
[39:36] into accomplishing something
[39:38] into fixing something
[39:40] we think about how people or things
[39:42] function
[39:44] and how we can better ourselves
[39:47] or our relationships
[39:49] by following steps
[39:52] for the plan that's laid out
[40:08] i don't know about you but i i fall into
[40:10] that category
[40:13] anybody you you you get you open up a
[40:15] box
[40:17] there's a lot of pieces
[40:19] and it seems like when you finish
[40:21] building it
[40:35] and next thing you know what the thing
[40:37] is falling apart
[40:41] that's what that was for oh
[40:44] if you walk into a bookstore
[40:46] do you like going to bookstores
[41:18] so you start to read it
[41:22] that's kind of hard
[41:24] if you see what if i just do five of
[41:25] them
[41:28] no it says seven steps this is yeti
[41:31] we read about a quarter of the book and
[41:33] i'll get to that later
[41:37] we lose interest
[41:41] 10 ways to improve all your
[41:43] relationships
[41:47] i don't have a good relationship with
[41:49] this member of my family
[41:51] familiar thank goodness
[41:53] nobody here feels that way
[42:00] five habits of highly successful
[42:02] people
[42:05] i don't know those are books i'm just
[42:07] you you understand what i'm doing
[42:10] 12 steps to financial freedom
[42:14] man
[42:26] a way of making ourselves more successes
[42:31] we all go through that
[42:32] anybody ever ever order books
[42:37] online
[42:38] in linea
[42:39] uh i i i i'm having a heart and i gotta
[42:42] believe in you as much you got to
[42:43] believe
[42:46] you come and you get these infomercials
[42:51] it is going to change your way of of
[42:54] your your way of life
[43:00] [Music]
[43:16] oh i got a few people the rest of you
[43:18] just
[43:18] whatever
[43:21] we spent a lot of money to change
[43:24] our status
[43:36] but but as we were hearing such a good
[43:39] message on on wednesday
[43:43] you know we don't want to put the work
[43:45] in to get us to that level
[43:50] and then when we get to that level
[43:51] there's there's we heard about
[44:06] so it's so true because it pertains to
[44:09] all of us
[44:12] you see that has become our tendency
[44:14] nowadays
[44:17] brian fix our finances
[44:20] to try and fix
[44:48] our characters
[45:01] that's why when we're trying to repair
[45:03] or fix some
[45:04] repair
[45:05] we must take this into consideration
[45:10] there is no such a thing as a broken
[45:12] marriage
[45:15] hello everybody
[45:18] there's no such a thing as a broken
[45:20] relationship
[45:22] what's broken are the people in the
[45:24] marriage
[45:27] hello everybody
[45:29] what's broken is not a relationship
[45:33] it's the people in the relationship
[45:36] yes sir yes you'll see do i got your
[45:38] attention this morning
[45:40] there's no such a thing as bad finances
[45:43] oh yeah my finances are are they're just
[45:45] bad
[45:47] the person handling the finances
[45:50] that needs the help
[45:52] you can get the person
[45:54] taken care of
[45:57] care of the other things
[45:59] now what are all these books and
[46:01] podcasts and shows and everything what
[46:03] are they for
[46:06] they're trying to take the undisciplined
[46:09] person
[46:12] and help them some way to become
[46:14] disciplined
[46:17] areas of their lives that are out of
[46:19] control
[46:24] whenever when there's when there's
[46:25] problems
[46:26] something's
[46:32] the more one sees how undisciplined we
[46:35] as human beings are in
[46:37] many areas of our life
[46:41] we have no mechanics much less dynamic
[46:45] mechanical mucho menos
[46:47] everybody wants
[46:49] not the mechanics
[46:52] everybody wants the dynamics
[47:38] how to watch movie after movies
[47:42] hello everybody
[47:45] we've taught them how to watch video
[47:47] games or play video games
[47:51] they know how to plan vacations
[47:54] how to make money
[47:56] how to cheat the system
[48:04] but how about how to pray
[48:10] how to give
[48:12] god
[48:12] the preeminence
[48:16] do we sit down with our children and
[48:18] teach them that
[48:21] how to make christ the word the center
[48:24] of our lives
[48:28] i'm hearing the young man brother aj
[48:31] he's singing that song which is
[48:46] what's broken is the person
[48:50] and why are they broken
[48:52] because the mechanics has not been
[48:55] properly placed or installed
[48:59] we don't know we've never taught them
[49:01] how to be a good husband or good wife
[49:04] when they get married
[49:06] how to respect each other
[49:09] how to help your fellow brothers
[49:11] how can you
[49:13] let me just stop there
[49:31] [Music]
[50:38] but i'm talking about the whole plan the
[50:39] process
[50:42] we face educational machines
[50:47] we face medical machines
[50:49] we face corporate machines
[50:52] and they're all
[51:03] there were people that were experts in
[51:06] mechanics in mechanica let's take for
[51:09] instance the pharisees
[51:14] described
[51:16] the herodians
[51:17] they were experts in the law
[51:23] [Music]
[51:34] however those
[52:02] 10 steps to make it to heaven
[52:05] and i guarantee you
[52:07] so many people would
[52:09] get mucha gente
[52:11] she doing okay
[52:19] i guarantee you
[52:21] it would have been
[52:22] 10 steps to make it to heaven
[52:30] 10 ways
[52:45] but then comes a man
[52:48] out of nowhere
[52:52] and challenges the machine
[52:57] challenges them to the coretta
[53:11] and that's what the prophets of all did
[53:15] they stomped out of the wilderness
[53:19] and did what no one in their right mind
[53:21] would do talent
[53:26] challenge the machine
[53:41] i don't want to say that because it'll
[53:43] mess something up
[53:45] i don't want to poke it because then
[53:47] it'll come after us
[53:50] they didn't think like that they just
[53:52] they just opened this prophets never
[53:54] thought that well
[54:21] i lay down my life
[54:24] and i raise my own life
[54:27] you can't do that unless the father
[54:28] permits that
[54:30] watch this is so tremendous why does
[54:32] this unfold
[54:34] it wasn't their mind
[54:50] he made the mistake of trying to mix
[54:52] everything together
[54:55] he said you see where the brother made
[54:56] the error
[54:59] as anyone else is to making an error
[55:03] started dealing with the up and ups
[56:00] we try
[56:14] now watch us now
[56:16] you see the mechanics of their time the
[56:18] law mechanic
[56:20] but they failed to recognize that there
[56:22] were dynamics that went with those
[56:24] mechanics
[56:28] how many knows that satan also works
[56:30] under mechanics and dynamics
[56:34] now watch yeah you can't belong to a
[56:36] system
[56:38] and be sealed with the system
[56:40] yellow connections
[56:54] right
[56:57] and ready
[56:58] to move
[57:00] the mechanics is already there the
[57:02] mechanical gesture or this big machine
[57:04] this is the big system right
[57:06] the machine the way it works
[57:08] they've already got the mechanical
[57:10] system at the end of an organization
[57:13] organization oh they say peace
[57:15] like the u.n
[57:17] the nations are united together
[57:21] the u.n is nothing but a big rubber
[57:23] balloon
[57:52] but there you
[58:20] then
[58:24] this is why jesus is telling those two
[58:26] disciples on the road to emmaus
[58:31] fools
[58:48] it was
[59:02] we've got to get the mechanics right
[59:05] first
[59:06] mechanic
[59:08] in order for the dynamics to work
[59:10] properly
[59:13] these mechanics is mechanicas is god's
[59:17] word
[59:18] and it only comes one way
[59:22] through
[59:23] his prophet
[59:27] matthew four three through four matteo
[59:29] cuatro
[59:34] and when the tempter came to him he said
[59:36] if thou be the son of god command that
[59:38] these stones be made bread
[59:41] joseph
[59:47] but he answered and said
[59:49] it is written
[59:51] man shall not live by bread alone
[59:54] but by every word
[59:56] that proceedeth out of the
[1:00:25] proud
[1:00:40] by
[1:00:54] this now
[1:00:56] we have to know this jeremiah 15 19.
[1:01:02] therefore thus saith the lord if thou
[1:01:04] return
[1:01:05] then will i bring thee again
[1:01:08] and thou shalt stand before me
[1:01:11] and if thou take forth the precious that
[1:01:14] means an honorable woman
[1:01:16] the precious from the vile the worthless
[1:01:21] thou shalt be
[1:01:22] as
[1:01:50] mouth of god
[1:01:53] here's where we're starting to establish
[1:01:55] the mechanics and the dynamics
[1:01:59] notice this now what came forth from the
[1:02:01] mouth of god was the spoken word
[1:02:25] [Applause]
[1:02:46] for
[1:03:15] shall in no wise pass from the law till
[1:03:17] all be fulfilled
[1:03:23] only written words have jots and tittles
[1:03:26] solo la palabrasigota
[1:03:42] they have absolute and complete
[1:03:45] authority
[1:03:46] absolutely
[1:03:48] matthew 4 jesus you don't have to turn
[1:03:50] to it
[1:03:52] but jesus tells satan three times
[1:04:11] this is the amazing part to me
[1:04:15] watch
[1:04:16] what jesus uses
[1:04:18] for his defense okay
[1:04:21] the same one get this church
[1:04:24] the same one that spoke from heaven
[1:04:28] now begins to quote the prophet
[1:04:33] who spoke from the earth
[1:04:37] i like that one that's good stuff here
[1:04:40] i'm going to say it again
[1:04:42] that had previously spoken from heaven
[1:04:46] begins to quote the prophets
[1:04:49] you were speaking from earth
[1:04:52] and even
[1:05:04] how is it that humans throughout the
[1:05:06] ages
[1:05:19] knowing that they were the ultimate
[1:05:21] those words were the ultimate
[1:05:22] authorities
[1:05:26] now the only way that a prophet's words
[1:05:28] have complete authority
[1:05:34] was
[1:06:02] now
[1:06:29] he can't say his own thoughts
[1:06:32] he can only speak what god reveals
[1:06:37] it's a thing that god does
[1:06:40] you can't say nothing else
[1:06:42] he says because those prophets they were
[1:06:44] born
[1:06:58] he will
[1:07:39] therefore i have made
[1:08:08] we've gone through this before in one of
[1:08:09] our other messages
[1:08:11] but we're getting into something
[1:08:13] oh
[1:08:14] what must i do okay
[1:08:17] see moses expressingly
[1:08:21] is fully human nature
[1:08:25] but watch
[1:08:27] he wanted to wait
[1:08:29] on thus saith the lord
[1:08:33] he should have known interview
[1:08:36] that the very
[1:08:56] [Applause]
[1:09:04] don't
[1:09:31] ah
[1:10:00] but i
[1:10:55] it was the mystery that god unfolds
[1:11:00] it's not a man
[1:11:02] it's god it's yours the angel was not
[1:11:05] the son of man
[1:11:07] he was the messenger from the son of god
[1:11:10] means the
[1:11:51] the reflector isn't the reflection
[1:11:53] either
[1:11:54] reflection there has to be something
[1:11:57] strike the reflector or the prophet
[1:12:02] to make it reflect
[1:12:05] so a prophet is a chosen vessel
[1:12:20] the image of christ the word
[1:12:26] you
[1:12:27] are reflected
[1:12:31] tell your neighbor that neighborhood
[1:12:51] [Music]
[1:13:58] he says god's perfect reflector in type
[1:14:08] when god was
[1:14:10] through with him
[1:14:12] he just
[1:14:21] when we look at mechanics and dynamics
[1:14:24] sometimes we just look at them as
[1:14:26] separate
[1:14:52] but watch what happens
[1:14:54] okay
[1:15:08] you
[1:15:22] jesus jesus christ
[1:15:25] they jump and shout they don't get
[1:15:26] nothing you don't receive another why
[1:15:28] they get an emotion
[1:15:30] oh that was a wonderful service
[1:15:33] and they lived the same way
[1:15:36] what
[1:17:00] here's where the problem is in the
[1:17:01] churches
[1:17:03] once again the dynamics the power the
[1:17:05] movement the excitement
[1:17:11] and therefore the mechanics are never
[1:17:12] established in a personal
[1:17:21] they're reflecting their own ideas
[1:17:24] well i think you're already off to work
[1:17:27] yes
[1:17:29] [Music]
[1:17:56] me
[1:18:09] did you just hear the voice of a man you
[1:19:05] get into the word
[1:19:10] oh we're getting good on getting good on
[1:19:12] this mechanics and dynamics
[1:19:17] that teaches you all this theology
[1:20:17] is the word the mechanic
[1:20:19] dynamics is the spirit
[1:20:21] makes the world live
[1:20:23] make it alive
[1:20:26] not enough just to have mechanics
[1:20:30] without dynamics
[1:20:32] dynamics without mechanics
[1:20:35] and it's not enough anymore
[1:20:38] to say i have dynamics and mechanics
[1:20:43] but now we are in the final leg
[1:20:47] we are in the home stretch
[1:20:52] mechanics
[1:20:55] we must now become
[1:20:58] right now
[1:21:26] but there has got to come
[1:21:28] one
[1:21:30] hallelujah hallelujah there has to come
[1:21:32] a real bride
[1:21:35] who
[1:21:37] this is not just any anybody
[1:21:40] there must
[1:21:50] oh my goodness
[1:21:52] but the dynamics of it
[1:22:08] until we come to the place
[1:22:12] and until we get there yes
[1:22:15] what good does it do to polish the hubs
[1:22:17] or the rims of the car they can vienna
[1:22:21] that's right
[1:22:38] i'm doing good this morning
[1:22:41] no matter how much the mechanics proved
[1:22:43] to be right
[1:22:49] there's got to be dynamics to make it
[1:22:50] work
[1:22:53] that's what easter proved
[1:22:58] he wasn't only the word
[1:23:02] but he was god himself
[1:23:18] in the grave
[1:23:30] [Music]
[1:24:00] he was not only
[1:24:28] they can only
[1:25:09] the spirit of him and the spiritual
[1:25:11] there and the flesh of him
[1:25:13] and put it together
[1:25:16] did you get it
[1:25:18] the spirit of him
[1:25:20] and the flesh of him
[1:25:21] and put it together
[1:25:37] you're just cranking around the pistons
[1:25:41] you got the spark there to fire it
[1:25:46] but you have no gasoline to fire it
[1:25:50] that's the resurrection
[1:26:02] we know this by heart
[1:26:04] this is
[1:26:18] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[1:26:27] then we which are alive and remain
[1:26:31] shall be caught up
[1:26:33] our passover
[1:26:46] shall we ever be with the lord
[1:26:57] now
[1:26:58] i'm going to throw you a little
[1:26:59] curveball here
[1:27:16] i'm not saying that it's not that
[1:27:17] horrendous let me understand what this
[1:27:19] is my point against anybody that says
[1:27:21] raptures to
[1:27:23] take by forces
[1:27:26] but i want to go a step further
[1:27:30] i'm not saying that she is
[1:27:32] not taken by
[1:27:34] foreign but my question is
[1:27:37] how is she taken by forces
[1:27:42] because if usually if somebody is taken
[1:27:44] by forces
[1:28:09] there was a force that caught us
[1:28:54] the
[1:29:11] [Applause]
[1:29:23] both
[1:29:26] i'm going to say it again until
[1:29:27] that shirt
[1:29:29] what church polyglycia
[1:29:32] i want to be part of that
[1:29:35] until that
[1:29:47] it's not good enough to have it
[1:29:57] [Music]
[1:30:31] that's the true power of the
[1:30:32] resurrection
[1:30:47] the dynamics of this church
[1:30:49] la ninamica destiglacia will be the
[1:30:51] refilling of the holy ghost
[1:30:56] that we have worked in a small measure
[1:31:28] we don't know how he's
[1:31:42] he calls
[1:31:43] his body the machine
[1:31:47] oh my goodness
[1:31:49] i'm sorry i got i got it
[1:31:53] [Applause]
[1:31:54] you crossed over and had some grapes
[1:32:03] i can't get too much wine up here
[1:32:07] for the minister to get too much wine
[1:32:10] and overdo
[1:32:50] because the force gets worse and worse
[1:33:06] this is
[1:33:18] we find out that the mechanics was so
[1:33:54] [Music]
[1:34:03] in mechanics
[1:34:06] the only way to worship him
[1:34:08] that there's the gate of worship
[1:34:12] worshiping in spirit and in truth
[1:34:16] mechanics and dynamics
[1:34:19] if the spirit dynamics
[1:34:22] got jesus from the dead
[1:34:25] then dwells in you
[1:34:27] it will also quicken them
[1:34:31] [Music]
[1:35:25] but i just want to go just for a little
[1:35:26] bit
[1:35:40] force
[1:35:44] is the physical power or strength
[1:35:48] possessed by a living being
[1:35:52] strength or power that is exerted upon
[1:35:55] an object
[1:35:58] intensity intensity power to influence
[1:36:02] the influence to affect or control
[1:36:05] mental or moral strength mental or
[1:36:08] stability
[1:36:37] that men that are led by the spirit of
[1:36:39] god
[1:36:42] they can't understand their own selves
[1:36:47] how many here are led by the spirit
[1:37:20] bring it all together they're driven by
[1:37:22] a force
[1:37:24] that sometimes they think
[1:37:27] why did i ever do that
[1:37:30] but it's god working in them
[1:37:46] yet they both work in the same church
[1:37:49] honestly
[1:37:53] and they're both an unseen foreign
[1:37:58] saiyan runs his kingdom by force
[1:39:19] [Music]
[1:39:25] why this why me
[1:39:27] and he says why christ because he said
[1:39:30] jorah
[1:39:31] but the prophet said
[1:39:38] watch this now
[1:39:40] the gentile age ushered in that way with
[1:39:43] a forced religion
[1:39:51] and it'll go out the same way
[1:40:02] you see that's what sickness is
[1:40:05] it's an unseen force it's not a force
[1:40:20] what it's doing
[1:40:33] the bible says lay your hands on the
[1:40:34] sick
[1:41:28] your unbelief will restore it again
[1:41:45] and the devil can only be
[1:41:47] one place at a time
[1:41:51] brother brown says his imps
[1:41:53] imps
[1:41:55] are little devils
[1:41:58] they
[1:42:24] doesn't mean that he is everywhere
[1:42:54] god's power
[1:43:03] [Music]
[1:43:08] he wants
[1:43:36] none
[1:43:51] what is the most vital power or force
[1:44:00] the most vital force
[1:44:03] on planet earth
[1:44:18] we
[1:44:29] his prayers
[1:44:34] come on you want 10 ways to have a
[1:44:36] successful life yes
[1:44:41] i can barely handle one way lord
[1:44:44] haruna
[1:44:45] i don't know about you but man you
[1:44:47] studies you got to remember all those
[1:44:49] things
[1:44:50] thank god for my wife
[1:44:52] did you take your vitamins today
[1:44:54] i didn't even know i had vitamins
[1:44:57] thank you for telling me reminding me
[1:45:13] that god ever gave put in the hand of
[1:45:15] mankind
[1:45:18] prayer
[1:45:19] they can even change the mind of god
[1:45:23] there's not another force on earth
[1:45:26] no matter what kind of gifts it is
[1:45:42] what is
[1:46:04] [Music]
[1:46:24] i love your neighbor i'll mess with you
[1:46:26] love your enemies
[1:46:31] the supernatural come on the scene
[1:46:34] when the holy spirit comes into your
[1:46:36] heart
[1:46:38] and produces the fruit of the spirit it
[1:46:40] produces fruit i never said fruits of
[1:46:42] the spirit well it's the fruit it's
[1:46:44] fruit of the spirit
[1:46:46] that's the force that satan can't handle
[1:46:50] jesus christ
[1:46:52] coming back on the worst
[1:47:05] it brings an excitement to that spirit
[1:47:10] that's why we as ministers
[1:47:13] we want to preach with all the forces
[1:47:19] and all the forces not how
[1:47:34] behind
[1:47:56] that's why our dominion is the dominion
[1:47:58] over sin
[1:48:02] it is enforced through the power
[1:48:04] of the police that is in the spirit of
[1:48:06] christ
[1:48:09] brother branham can you put up the
[1:48:11] the picture of brother branham with the
[1:48:13] halo
[1:48:43] he said brother branham you hold mono
[1:48:45] branham you'll probably be dead and gone
[1:48:52] before this picture
[1:48:55] comes into a force
[1:49:01] wow
[1:49:02] i read that and i said yes
[1:49:06] in a force right now
[1:49:10] because the testament
[1:49:26] but when it comes into a force
[1:49:32] mechanics and dynamics
[1:49:35] coming to the body of christ
[1:49:39] how in force
[1:49:54] are the only ones
[1:50:35] god
[1:50:43] but that's okay
[1:50:44] but i want i want to just get this last
[1:50:46] part
[1:50:48] we have a right to force the most claims
[1:51:03] so now we have a right to
[1:51:05] force and it was
[1:51:08] saying forces things
[1:51:10] force we now have a right to force it
[1:51:12] upon him
[1:51:14] and say give it back
[1:51:18] and he
[1:51:40] [Music]
[1:52:00] the lord
[1:52:14] the law
[1:53:09] it'll be in full force
[1:53:13] scan to your features
[1:53:15] [Applause]
[1:53:20] now get this last part
[1:53:25] we know the vision doesn't fail
[1:53:28] i want to bring this last part to you
[1:53:31] we know the vision does not fail
[1:53:34] and when there's a vision
[1:53:36] we can take the vision
[1:53:38] no
[1:53:51] if he gave me a vision brother brahm
[1:53:52] says
[1:53:55] and tell this woman something to do
[1:53:59] i believe then if i laid my hands upon
[1:54:01] her she'll get it
[1:54:05] but what if he didn't give you a vision
[1:54:11] what would the vision do
[1:54:15] the vision only gives us faith
[1:54:20] [Music]
[1:54:34] the unseen power of god
[1:54:37] if every one of you died
[1:54:42] you'd never see your yourself leave your
[1:54:45] body
[1:54:48] your
[1:54:50] [Music]
[1:55:02] the force that would
[1:55:16] it would
[1:55:44] i believe that she's going to get well
[1:55:47] because i saw the vision
[1:55:48] and my confidence is in the vision
[1:55:51] but what about the word
[1:55:55] lay hands on her
[1:55:57] it's the same thing when i miss my
[1:56:25] without the vision it's going to work
[1:56:26] the same thing
[1:56:28] as long as your faith is in that word
[1:56:31] some people are given great faith
[1:56:34] i don't have that kind of faith
[1:56:36] they're giving visions and giving them
[1:56:38] to give them favors
[1:56:48] [Music]
[1:56:54] when the perfect
[1:57:19] [Music]
[1:57:22] but can you just take the word
[1:57:27] can you just believe brother james
[1:57:32] say my wife is coming home
[1:57:36] you take that and
[1:57:50] with what you struggle with mariah
[1:57:52] lucha you believe that it won't bother
[1:57:54] you no more
[1:57:58] faith in that
[1:57:59] then your healing is right there
[1:58:01] we don't have to look anywhere else
[1:58:04] i don't need something
