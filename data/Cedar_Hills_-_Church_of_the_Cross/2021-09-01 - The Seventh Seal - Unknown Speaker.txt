========================================

notice now we're going to read in the bible in the the seventh seal that's found in revelations the eighth chapter and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of a half hour that's all we have now we're going to notice i remember after the fourth chapter of revelations the church is gone after the the uh four horse riders has went out the church is gone see and then they were satan and his angels was kicked out and then they come to the earth and the battle set in again because eve broke down the barrier from where she was uh isolated behind the word of god you believe in god's mathematics you don't you sure lost you'll sure get lost in the word if you start putting a four or six or or something besides system of mathematical words running an order you'll sure have in your cow picking grass on top of a tree somewhere you'll certainly run out because god does not his whole word does run completely in in mathematics yes perfect the most perfect there's no other literature written like it like it so perfect in that mathematics now the the eighth chapter only reveals the scene of uh the scene of the seventh seal where nothing else is revealed not nothing all the way back from genesis the seventh chapter the seven seals spoke of from the very beginning in genesis the seventh jesus christ and speaking himself told of the end time and when he got told all set six seals when he got to seven he stopped there it is it's a great thing and no where through the church age since in the early apostolic church has the protestant church ever had a prophet tell me who it was never but we are promised in the last day that to return to the church again for the benefit of straightening up all that has been missed undone left undone of course predicted here that the seventh angel's message would finish the mysteries of god amen now we've went through it all we see that it's perfectly in harmony with the scripture that's the reason now could you imagine when this person comes on the scene when he does remember it'll be so humble and thanks to the churches are missing a long ways if there be one among you who's spiritual or a prophet i the lord my god will make myself known to him and speak to him in visions through dreams and interpret dreams somebody have a dream the prophet will be able to interpret it and if if he has a vision he speaks it i'll make myself known to him through visions and dreams make myself doing and if what he says comes to pass then hear that prophet because i'm with him now we'll turn now to the eighth verse of the uh or the first verse i mean of eighth chapter revelation uh eight one we must remember that this seventh seal is the end of time of all things right the things written in the seventh seal book sealed up of the plan of redemption from before the foundational world it ever been ends it is the end it is the end of the struggling world is end of struggling nature it's the end of everything in there is the end of the trumpets it's the end of the vials it's the end of the earth it's it's even the end of time time runs out the bible said so it's the end of the vials and even in the ushering in of the millennium that's on the seventh seal it's just like firing a rocket into the air and that rocket explodes here and it goes up then it explodes again it puts out five stars one of those stars exploding blows out five stars from it and then one of them starts explodes goes out five stars submit see it fades on out now how is he going to do it that's what we don't know we don't know notice the breaking of this seal was so great that heaven was hushed by it in silence for the space of a hammock ah is it great what is it it was hushed heavens it was a thing move for a half hour when the seventh sealed mystery in the book of redemption broke over [Music] think of it but it's broke the lamb breaks you know what they were all about i mean they didn't know there was it just stopped why what is it i'm going to tell you my my revelation and now uh certain as i stand in the plant park tonight i had the revelation that revealed it's in a threefold manner sitting there when this left me something has come to me and said don't fear i didn't hear no voice like on the inside of me spoke i have to tell you the truth just exactly what happened something hit and said don't fear this is that third pull i was standing with a a little baby shoe when he told me saying make your first pull and when you do the fish will run after the lure so then watch your second pull said because it'll only be small fish he said then the third pawn will get it and there's three great things that goes with it and one unfolded today or yesterday the other one unfolded today and there's one thing that i cannot interpret because it's in an unknown language but stand right there and look right straight at it and this is the third poll coming up amen that's the reason all heaven was solid remember the seventh messenger was the seven messengers was the noted one to me the seventh angel it seemed more to me than any i see they were standing like this and i was standing here and i was watching those other see one first bunch of little purrs feathers all beat down you remember them and they all flew eastward and the second bunch were brighter bigger birds looked like doves pointed wings they flew eastward first pool second bull then the next was angels and it's i'm standing right there and this explosion left and i was looking this way towards the west and they come and just pick me up in there and i went out of my knowing and the one of them coming was the one that splits the streams to me was the one on my feet to left where i entered the constellation at but counting from the left to the right it would have been the seventh angel coming across now remember the seven messengers do you remember the pyramid of white rock now notice this that now when this taken place junior was standing in a field that had a had a big pyramid to it like that and there was something right on the rocks and i was revealing that to the people is that right junior about a year before it happened and notice the next thing now i took some kind of a bar and cut it off and on the inside was white rock that had nothing wrote on it and at that time i started to the west and i told them all i said don't go out west stay here and look on this until i returned went west for the blast returned back to the east with the holy spirit interpreted this unwritten word amen amen if that isn't personal thank you god almighty but i know that it was them seven thunders putting themselves right close together just banging seven different times and it unfolded into something else that i see then when i've seen that i look for the interpretation flew across there and i couldn't make it out that's exactly right the hour isn't quite yet far amen what happens is that those seven thunders he heard thunder and was forbidden to write that's what the mystery is laying behind those seven consecutive thunders rolling out now why let us prove it why it is the secret that no one knows about john was forbidding to write about it even even not a symbol about it why this is why there was no active in head active in heaven it might give away the secret do you see it now amen but here is seven straight thunders right in a row one two three four five six seven that perfect number then heavens couldn't write that heavens can't know about it nothing else because there's nothing to go on it's relaxing time it was so great till it's kept secret from the angels now why if satan should get a hold of it he might do great damage that's one thing he don't know if they made one move it might give something away so they just shut up quit harping everything stopped uh seven god's perfect number seven just right down the road seven thunders utter straight together like you're spelling out something notice at that time started right he said don't write it jesus never spoke of it john couldn't write it angels know nothing about it amen what is it it's the thing that jesus said even the angels of heaven didn't know nothing about it see he didn't know it himself amen he said only god would know it amen now what this great secret is that lays beneath this seal i do not know i don't know it i couldn't make it out i couldn't tell it just what it means what it's saying but i know that it was them seven thunders uttering themselves right close together just banging seven different times but it's moving into that cycle it's coming up close so the thing for you to do is to remember that i speak to you in the name of the lord amen hallelujah and here when the seventh seal when he opened it he also omitted it again see so we see that it is a complete mystery therefore the hour is not yet for this mystery to be known therefore we're this far and the rest of it will be known right around about the time that jesus appears on earth again for his bride or whatever takes place at that time now until that time let's just all pray live good straight christian lives looking forward for his coming now the vision plus the word plus the history plus the church ages and all blend together so i could truly say that to the best of my understanding and according to the word of god and the vision and the revelation the interpretation thereof is thus saith the lord now may the lord bless you all each one real richly as we stand now and sing this good old song of the church god bless you each one amen you
