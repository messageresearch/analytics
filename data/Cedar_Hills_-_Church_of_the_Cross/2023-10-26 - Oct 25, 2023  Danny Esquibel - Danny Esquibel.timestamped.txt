[39:23] Lord
[39:25] tonight
[39:27] how many are
[39:29] happy amen
[39:36] amen God bless
[39:39] you you ever heard the
[39:43] term he was shaking in his
[39:46] [Music]
[39:47] boots I'm literally shaking in my
[39:52] boots he's here
[39:55] amen amen let's read a scripture real
[39:58] quick we don't have you standing for too
[40:02] long and so what's going to be found in
[40:04] Leviticus 17 chapter
[40:10] 17 verse
[40:17] 14 for it is the life of All Flesh the
[40:21] blood of it is for the life thereof
[40:23] therefore I say unto the children of
[40:25] Israel ye shall eat the blood of no
[40:27] manner of Flesh for the life of All
[40:30] Flesh is the blood
[40:32] thereof whosoever eateth it shall be cut
[40:41] [Music]
[40:51] off amen you can be
[40:54] seated so we just
[40:57] read that the life of the
[41:01] flesh is the
[41:03] blood right that's the life of the flesh
[41:08] right so how many
[41:11] knows that you are at the mercy of the
[41:16] blood right so every single person
[41:19] that's sitting here
[41:21] tonight your body lives at the mercy of
[41:24] the blood
[41:28] all right so let's naturally speak
[41:31] amen so your
[41:34] blood provides
[41:37] nourishments to every
[41:40] cell of your body right now we can get
[41:44] into the medical terms which I have them
[41:46] all
[41:49] here right but uh I I ain't no
[41:52] doctor right I'm just I'm just a little
[41:56] a
[41:58] backwoodsman uneducated backwoodsman
[42:01] there all right so some of the words I
[42:04] would probably mess them
[42:08] up I I was reading them I I came into
[42:10] church a minute
[42:13] ago and I told my son I said how do you
[42:15] say this
[42:17] word and he told me and I forgot already
[42:21] what the word was all right so so I'm
[42:23] not going to get into the medical term
[42:27] but you ask me anything about a
[42:30] horse well I can tell you anything about
[42:33] him
[42:34] right I could be a veterinarian an equin
[42:39] veterinarian right but I'm not a medical
[42:43] doctor right so your blood provides
[42:45] nourishments to every cell of your
[42:50] body so you have red blood cells in your
[42:54] body and it flows through every every
[42:56] part of the
[42:59] body right so it provides for
[43:02] you so your blood
[43:06] tonight as you're sitting
[43:08] there it's providing for you
[43:12] life the life is in the blood
[43:16] amen the life the is the the blood is
[43:19] the flesh the is the life of the
[43:22] flesh so it's providing right now for
[43:25] you provid oxygen to your your
[43:30] bloodstream right it's it's applying
[43:32] it's it's applying amino
[43:36] acids nitrogen sodium potassium right
[43:41] right sister if you're looking at me and
[43:44] you're just staring at me I'm like okay
[43:46] make sure
[43:50] I'm so it's it's providing these these
[43:53] nourishments for your body
[43:57] everything that you
[44:00] need to operate inside of
[44:05] yourself or to live is provided to
[44:10] you through the
[44:12] blood okay that's pretty simple right so
[44:16] not only is your blood A
[44:21] supplier it also
[44:24] cleanses right so it's a
[44:27] cleanup it's kind of like being the
[44:30] Milkman and the garbage man all in the
[44:32] same
[44:33] truck
[44:35] right and the garbage man
[44:38] yeah it provides you what you
[44:41] need and then it just comes right behind
[44:43] and starts cleaning up all the toxins
[44:45] your
[44:46] body now what happens if you if you cut
[44:49] off the supply of blood to your one of
[44:51] your
[44:54] extremities
[44:58] right so you you how many have ever
[44:59] gotten their their blood pressure
[45:00] checked
[45:02] right right and they they start to
[45:04] squeeze on your arm
[45:06] right and all of a sudden you start
[45:08] feeling like a a a stinging feeling
[45:11] going through your body
[45:14] right well what what's
[45:16] happening what's happening to the
[45:19] body when the blood flow gets cut
[45:22] off right it starts to build up toxins
[45:25] right
[45:26] [Music]
[45:27] it starts causing
[45:29] pain and if you if you hold it there
[45:31] long
[45:32] enough you're probably gonna scream
[45:36] out right so no no matter how tough you
[45:39] are
[45:40] right so when the when the blood supply
[45:43] is cut off to the
[45:46] body there's
[45:48] pain right for many times we live in
[45:52] pain because we stop the flow of blood
[45:55] to the body
[45:59] right we we
[46:00] suffer through through
[46:02] toxins we allow toxins to build up
[46:05] inside the
[46:08] body without allowing the blood to flow
[46:11] through the
[46:14] body so it's a supplier it's a it's a
[46:17] supplier of
[46:19] Life the blood
[46:22] supplies it it
[46:24] cleanses right
[46:26] and it's also has
[46:29] power right the blood also has
[46:34] power so inside of you right
[46:38] now is a
[46:40] warrior running through the through
[46:43] through through your
[46:46] bloodstream because the the biggest uh
[46:49] uh threat to human
[46:54] beings a human being is is not
[46:58] war it's not an atomic
[47:01] bomb right it the the the greatest
[47:03] threat to you right now in your
[47:07] body is
[47:09] bacteria and
[47:12] viruses right that that's the biggest
[47:13] threat to you right
[47:16] now so as soon as your
[47:19] body because as you have these red blood
[47:24] cells there are also white blood cells
[47:26] in your
[47:28] body and as soon as your your your your
[47:32] body as soon as it detects a virus or a
[47:38] bacteria right away it goes to
[47:42] war it goes straight into
[47:45] battle right and it starts to call on
[47:48] these uh
[47:50] antibodies
[47:52] right antibodies right and so these
[47:56] antibodies and that's where I'm not
[47:58] going to get
[48:01] into because like I said I I'll mess it
[48:04] all
[48:06] up I I I used to laugh at my dad
[48:10] sometimes he would be talking right and
[48:13] then he would just say
[48:18] share and so that sounds like let's
[48:20] share
[48:23] something like what it talking about
[48:25] Shar
[48:28] and then and then I you mean a
[48:31] chair yeah that's what I just said a
[48:33] chair
[48:35] chair I'm like this guy who's never been
[48:37] close to
[48:41] Mexico and he's got that an accent
[48:45] on right and so I would probably do the
[48:47] same thing
[48:49] right so that's the
[48:51] natural okay so we got that out of the
[48:53] way right
[48:56] okay so now let's open up our
[48:59] scriptures to Mark 10:1
[49:08] 17 and it's a familiar scripture that
[49:10] we've all read and we read many
[49:15] times right it was Jesus and the Rich
[49:17] Young
[49:20] Ruler and when he had gone forth into
[49:22] the way there came one running and kned
[49:24] to him and asked him good Master what
[49:26] shall I do that I might inherit eternal
[49:34] life now notice right
[49:38] there notice right
[49:40] there that uh as we've heard many
[49:44] times there was nothing that he could
[49:48] do right but the scripture we're going
[49:50] to find out doesn't say
[49:53] that right right away we we we we get
[49:56] real religious right we oh oh you can't
[49:58] depend on yourself nothing that you
[49:59] could do
[50:02] done right but Jesus is going to answer
[50:05] it for
[50:06] him so there's something that can be
[50:09] done
[50:09] tonight now how many are seeking eternal
[50:13] life right so half of us here are
[50:16] seeking eternal
[50:17] [Music]
[50:19] life the other half have the cuff on
[50:23] their hand on their arm
[50:26] and it's got a lot of pressure on
[50:28] it so let let's just let off the
[50:30] pressure
[50:31] amen so how many here want eternal
[50:35] life okay
[50:38] so Jesus answered unto him why callest
[50:42] thou me good there is none good but one
[50:44] that is
[50:54] God thou knowest the Commandments do not
[50:57] commit adultery do not kill do not steal
[50:59] do not bear false witness defraud not
[51:01] honor thy father and
[51:05] [Music]
[51:13] mother and he answered and said unto him
[51:15] master all these have I observed from my
[51:22] youth then Jesus beholding him loved him
[51:27] so I want you to just get this is to me
[51:29] this is awesome
[51:31] here right look look at this version of
[51:33] of of the scripture
[51:35] here he tells Jesus uh these laws uh
[51:38] I've obeyed since my
[51:42] youth and it says here in
[51:45] 21 Jesus fixed his gaze upon the man
[51:48] with tender
[51:53] love he fixed his gaze on
[51:57] him
[52:00] right and that was Jesus beholding him
[52:02] loved him and he said unto him one thing
[52:05] thou
[52:08] lackest one thing thou
[52:10] lackest he was asking what must I do to
[52:13] inh inherit eternal
[52:17] life Jesus gave him part of the
[52:22] key right you know the Commandments
[52:26] okay I I've done that
[52:29] part one thing thou
[52:32] lackest what was that one thing that he
[52:36] lacked right okay one thing thou
[52:41] lackest go thy
[52:46] way you want eternal life
[52:52] tonight go thy way
[52:57] uh go thy way sell whatsoever thou
[53:01] Hast and give to the
[53:04] poor and thou shalt have treasure in
[53:09] heaven and
[53:11] come take up your
[53:14] cross follow
[53:16] me so he just gave
[53:19] him uh observe all the law so that one
[53:24] step
[53:27] right and then he says you lack one
[53:29] thing okay I I lack one thing tell me
[53:33] what that one thing
[53:35] is go thy way sell whatever thou
[53:39] Hast give to the
[53:41] poor so that you can have
[53:44] treasure right so it he was telling him
[53:48] now now now there's got to be a transfer
[53:50] of the
[53:52] heart right he said uh you got to lot of
[53:56] possessions but we're not going to get
[53:58] into the possessions just
[54:00] yet right away our
[54:03] minds he had a lot of
[54:05] possessions he had uh maybe he had the
[54:08] finest
[54:10] cars 4,500 foot
[54:14] home well history says that he was a
[54:17] land
[54:19] owner he was a land owner right so he
[54:22] owned a lot of
[54:24] land right and so we're not going to get
[54:26] in the possessions just
[54:28] yet but he said
[54:31] basically have a transfer of
[54:35] heart you need a
[54:38] heart now
[54:39] remember the life of the
[54:43] flesh is the blood and the
[54:47] heart is the main
[54:49] organ where the blood
[54:53] pumps so he's saying now have a
[54:58] transfer of
[54:59] heart the reason he said
[55:02] that so that you'll have treasure in
[55:06] heaven he already had treasure on
[55:09] Earth he had a great church to go
[55:13] to he had all the
[55:16] law he had maybe a lot of friends in
[55:20] church he had all these good
[55:23] things right but were your treasure
[55:25] where your heart
[55:27] is there your treasure
[55:30] is Jesus
[55:32] said transfer your
[55:36] treasure from Earth so that you'll have
[55:39] it in
[55:40] heaven so get a blood
[55:45] transfusion it was a transfer of
[55:48] heart not
[55:51] possessions so the greatest possession
[55:53] that you have
[55:56] right is is the
[55:59] possession of your
[56:02] nature right you say oh I got a lot of
[56:05] possessions I got I got a car I got a
[56:09] house I got a good job I got this and
[56:12] that no your greatest
[56:15] possession that you have right now is
[56:18] your
[56:20] nature you own
[56:22] that you're the owner the bank doesn't
[56:25] hold the note on that
[56:27] one the Bible says we were born in
[56:31] sin shaped in
[56:33] iniquity come to the world speaking
[56:37] Lies We own that
[56:40] nature
[56:42] right so that that that's the nature
[56:44] that that's that's what we
[56:47] own but there has to be a
[56:51] change a
[56:52] change Paul's going to tell us
[56:56] over in
[56:57] Philippians if we if we turn over to
[57:07] it it says over here in
[57:10] Philippians if there be therefore any
[57:13] consolation in Christ if any comfort of
[57:14] love if any Fellowship of the spirit if
[57:17] any Batts of
[57:23] Mercy
[57:36] fulfill the my joy that you be
[57:38] likeminded having the same love being of
[57:40] one Accord and one
[57:49] mind let nothing be done through Strife
[57:52] or vain Glory but in loneliness of Mind
[57:56] Let each
[57:58] esteem other better than
[58:09] themselves so it I'm gonna speak it
[58:12] plainly to
[58:14] you so Paul's saying so I'm asking you
[58:18] my
[58:20] friends that you be joined
[58:23] together in perfect
[58:26] Unity with one
[58:28] heart one
[58:30] passion and United in
[58:34] love walk
[58:36] together with one harmonious
[58:40] purpose and you will fill my heart with
[58:43] unbounded
[58:46] joy be free from
[58:50] Pride verse three let nothing be done
[58:52] through Strife or vain
[58:58] in verse
[58:59] five let this mind be in
[59:08] you let this mind be in
[59:12] you what must I do to inherit eternal
[59:16] life let this
[59:19] mind so the mind of a
[59:23] man is a
[59:26] possession right your
[59:29] mind is a
[59:31] possession but when there's a
[59:34] transfer of the heart he says let this
[59:38] mind be in
[59:40] you which was in Christ
[59:43] Jesus so he's saying and consider the
[59:46] example that
[59:49] Jesus the anointed one has set before
[59:53] us let his
[59:57] mindset
[59:58] become your
[1:00:01] motivation so God he has many
[1:00:06] possessions right right away we oh we
[1:00:09] can't have no
[1:00:11] possessions got to sell all that we
[1:00:13] have no it's a transfer of
[1:00:17] heart it's a changing of the
[1:00:20] mind he said let this mind be in
[1:00:23] you
[1:00:26] which was also in Christ
[1:00:29] Jesus that being in the form of
[1:00:33] God and man thought it not
[1:00:38] robbery to be equal with
[1:00:42] God so God he had a lot of
[1:00:46] possessions the greatest possession that
[1:00:48] he
[1:00:50] had was
[1:00:52] Elohim he was self-existing of
[1:00:57] himself so many times we say in the
[1:01:01] beginning God
[1:01:03] created no God did create nothing God
[1:01:07] did not create
[1:01:09] anything brother Bram says you got to
[1:01:12] watch the words
[1:01:14] now you got to watch these words these
[1:01:17] English
[1:01:18] words when they're
[1:01:21] translated God didn't create nothing he
[1:01:24] said in the
[1:01:26] beginning
[1:01:27] Elohim a possession that God
[1:01:31] had his greatest
[1:01:34] possession was self-existing of
[1:01:37] himself he created the
[1:01:40] world he created
[1:01:42] light he brought all these things into
[1:01:46] existence but he transferred his
[1:01:49] possession to become
[1:01:52] God he transferred it
[1:01:55] to become an object of
[1:01:58] worship it was a transferring of the
[1:02:02] heart I can be Elohim by
[1:02:06] myself what good does that do me if I
[1:02:10] have attributes inside of
[1:02:12] me that I want to
[1:02:15] express so I got to transfer that
[1:02:19] possession lack you lack one
[1:02:22] thing s all that thou
[1:02:25] has give to the
[1:02:28] poor transfer your
[1:02:30] treasure and take up your
[1:02:33] cross but God he had another
[1:02:37] possession he he he was God
[1:02:42] himself there with
[1:02:44] himself now he had angels to worship
[1:02:48] him he became God right and he gave up
[1:02:52] that possession
[1:02:55] we hear it many times imagine if I was
[1:02:59] God if I was God I would just do
[1:03:04] this I'd just do that right right we we
[1:03:08] all say that right don't don't look at
[1:03:10] me like a dear in the headlight
[1:03:12] right oh especially Hunters
[1:03:15] right man if I was God I would just put
[1:03:19] a big old 400 class
[1:03:22] right God send me
[1:03:26] right we do that
[1:03:29] right or just
[1:03:31] me all right so so
[1:03:34] God he became
[1:03:38] Christ he he went from
[1:03:42] Elohim gave up that
[1:03:45] possession became
[1:03:47] God and then now he becomes
[1:03:49] Christ so it looks like he's coming down
[1:03:52] the
[1:03:53] scale
[1:03:55] right and and so now he becomes
[1:03:58] Christ the Bible says it was God in
[1:04:04] Christ reconciling himself back to the
[1:04:09] world right to the world to
[1:04:12] himself God in
[1:04:14] Christ it was God in
[1:04:17] Christ Jesus the man so he became a God
[1:04:23] man
[1:04:24] what a
[1:04:26] possession right he became a God
[1:04:30] man that's a
[1:04:32] possession what a
[1:04:34] possession right but but we we're we're
[1:04:37] looking for eternal life
[1:04:39] though right we we're looking for
[1:04:41] another
[1:04:43] possession well I thought if I had God
[1:04:46] or Elohim I was I had eternal
[1:04:49] life right I I thought if I had the
[1:04:53] law I I had eternal life but he found
[1:04:57] out he lacked one thing what did he
[1:05:02] lack what was it that he
[1:05:04] lacked that one
[1:05:06] thing what must I do to inherit eternal
[1:05:11] life right so Jesus
[1:05:14] says we just read in Leviticus
[1:05:18] right now it was
[1:05:21] said do not eat the blood of the flesh
[1:05:26] right but Jesus told this Rich Young
[1:05:32] Ruler don't eat the blood of the flesh
[1:05:35] life of the flesh right and so he said
[1:05:38] do not eat
[1:05:40] it the scripture said
[1:05:42] that and so all of a
[1:05:45] sudden Jesus
[1:05:48] says I am the bread of
[1:05:50] life that came down from heaven right
[1:05:54] right so the Rich Young
[1:05:56] Ruler he he didn't he didn't stick
[1:05:59] around long
[1:06:02] enough right but Jesus
[1:06:05] said uh cuz there was a lot of people
[1:06:07] that stuck
[1:06:09] around they they stuck
[1:06:12] around but Jesus began to explain to
[1:06:16] them and he says I am the bread of life
[1:06:19] that came down from
[1:06:21] heaven and he who eats me
[1:06:24] e of this
[1:06:26] bread has everlasting
[1:06:29] life right what must I do to inherit
[1:06:32] eternal
[1:06:34] life what do I got to do to inherit
[1:06:36] eternal life
[1:06:39] tonight I got to have
[1:06:42] communion I have to have
[1:06:45] communion Jesus said unless you eat the
[1:06:51] flesh the son of man or drink his
[1:06:55] blood you have no life in
[1:06:59] you no
[1:07:01] life this Rich Young
[1:07:03] Ruler he was looking for
[1:07:06] life he wanted eternal life he had
[1:07:11] everything
[1:07:12] else but Jesus said eat my
[1:07:16] flesh and drink my
[1:07:19] blood so the Orthodox Jews that were
[1:07:22] following Jesus
[1:07:24] as soon as he said
[1:07:27] that no
[1:07:29] s no way what does he want us to do be
[1:07:36] cannibals what does he think we are
[1:07:40] vampires eat his flesh and drink his
[1:07:45] blood that's
[1:07:48] gruesome that's
[1:07:50] barbaric the Bible says drink can eat
[1:07:54] the Flesh of no
[1:07:57] blood we're out of
[1:07:59] here right and the Bible says
[1:08:03] that perceiving his
[1:08:06] disciples knowing what they were
[1:08:08] thinking inside of
[1:08:11] him this this message that we
[1:08:15] preach is hard so if you like to wear
[1:08:19] kids
[1:08:21] gloves kids gloves
[1:08:25] Don't Preach this
[1:08:27] message right because this message is
[1:08:30] for
[1:08:32] grown-ups it's hard you're going to say
[1:08:35] things that are
[1:08:37] hard and it's not to throw at
[1:08:40] nobody it's like brother Abraham said
[1:08:42] trying to help
[1:08:45] people brother Braham says if you see
[1:08:47] your child on the
[1:08:51] street you're not going to go over there
[1:08:53] all put come on
[1:08:56] me come on honey all right you're not
[1:08:58] going to do that right so Jesus
[1:09:02] said does this offend
[1:09:07] you does this one thing that was
[1:09:12] lacking one thing that you
[1:09:15] lacked to eat the
[1:09:17] Flesh of the son of man and drink his
[1:09:21] blood does this offend you
[1:09:25] it offended them they were
[1:09:28] offended so sometimes we're going to get
[1:09:32] offended right right but how many peers
[1:09:36] do we have in the crowd
[1:09:39] tonight
[1:09:41] Peters because he turned to them
[1:09:44] then because the 70 walked with him no
[1:09:47] more but he said to the
[1:09:50] 12 he says will you go also
[1:09:57] right and the one that gets so
[1:10:00] much talked about or FL or or or he he
[1:10:04] was he spoke before he
[1:10:09] thought Peter was
[1:10:12] this I want to see the
[1:10:15] day when we see
[1:10:17] Peter I want to see these bold
[1:10:21] people I talked about Peter
[1:10:25] I want to see that
[1:10:33] right Peter
[1:10:35] said to whom shall we
[1:10:39] go to whom shall we
[1:10:43] go only
[1:10:45] you have the
[1:10:48] words of eternal
[1:10:51] life Jesus said
[1:10:54] he who eats my
[1:10:57] flesh and drinks my
[1:11:00] blood he have eternal
[1:11:03] life what must I
[1:11:06] do you lack one thing to eat my flesh
[1:11:11] and drink my
[1:11:13] blood that is to say to let my
[1:11:18] life live in
[1:11:20] you it's got to be living in you
[1:11:24] my
[1:11:25] blood because the
[1:11:28] words that I speak unto
[1:11:30] you they are
[1:11:33] Spirit they are
[1:11:35] spirit and they are
[1:11:37] life they are life it's eternal
[1:11:42] life
[1:11:44] Jesus is to my
[1:11:47] spirit what my blood is to my
[1:11:51] body if my blood
[1:11:54] if it supplies
[1:11:56] me
[1:11:58] Jesus provides my
[1:12:01] spirit he provides my
[1:12:04] spirit he is
[1:12:06] everything that my
[1:12:08] spirit
[1:12:10] needs
[1:12:11] Jesus if my blood is a
[1:12:16] cleanser
[1:12:17] Jesus for my
[1:12:19] spirit is the
[1:12:22] cleer
[1:12:24] he cleanses my life the Bible says we
[1:12:29] are
[1:12:30] cleansed in the
[1:12:32] precious blood of
[1:12:34] Jesus we are cleansed
[1:12:37] tonight Jesus that one thing he
[1:12:42] lacked was the
[1:12:44] transfer of the Life of Christ Living
[1:12:49] inside of
[1:12:51] him you can go to church all your
[1:12:54] life you can give all you want give to
[1:12:58] the poor but
[1:13:00] unless the life of Jesus
[1:13:03] Christ the blood of
[1:13:06] God flows inside of you there is no
[1:13:10] transfer
[1:13:11] of there's no
[1:13:16] transfer so if so if my
[1:13:20] blood is a warrior
[1:13:25] if my
[1:13:26] blood is a
[1:13:29] warrior Jesus is the all
[1:13:32] time he's the all
[1:13:35] time
[1:13:38] Undisputed all
[1:13:40] time
[1:13:42] Undisputed
[1:13:44] Champion he's a great
[1:13:47] warrior The Greatest
[1:13:49] Warrior that can wipe out any
[1:13:52] sickness
[1:13:54] can wipe out any
[1:13:56] toxin and not like my own
[1:13:59] blood because if my
[1:14:02] antibody comes in contact with a
[1:14:06] virus because
[1:14:08] antibodies they have
[1:14:10] memories right and as soon as they see a
[1:14:13] virus when they recognize that
[1:14:16] virus they have a memory they say oh I
[1:14:20] know who you are I know where you're
[1:14:22] coming from
[1:14:24] I know your serial
[1:14:25] number and all of a sudden he goes and
[1:14:27] tells the other
[1:14:29] antibodies hurry up start
[1:14:33] creating start
[1:14:34] fighting let's go to
[1:14:37] battle right but if a
[1:14:40] virus enters into my
[1:14:43] body that's not recognized by these
[1:14:48] antibodies the Warriors they going to go
[1:14:51] tell the other ones okay there's this
[1:14:54] virus I don't know what it is never seen
[1:14:58] it before when you start making some
[1:15:00] some
[1:15:02] antibodies but there's a lapse of time
[1:15:04] in
[1:15:06] there there's a there's a little lapse
[1:15:08] of time and you can't create the
[1:15:11] antibodies fast
[1:15:12] enough you
[1:15:15] cannot because it's fighting an
[1:15:17] unrecognized
[1:15:20] enemy today you will not go
[1:15:24] nowhere without a pastor because there's
[1:15:28] a lapse of time
[1:15:30] there and you might
[1:15:33] know this book
[1:15:36] frontwards and backwards you might
[1:15:40] read brother brandham
[1:15:44] frontwards and
[1:15:45] backwards but there's a lapse of time in
[1:15:48] there there has to be an
[1:15:52] antibody injected into
[1:15:54] you that has already affected another
[1:15:58] person in order for it to get its memory
[1:16:02] back that
[1:16:04] memory is the mind of
[1:16:07] Christ that memory goes all the way
[1:16:11] back to
[1:16:13] Elohim self-existing of
[1:16:16] himself in the beginning eloh in the
[1:16:21] beginning eloh El it was Elohim and then
[1:16:26] God being one with his
[1:16:29] family transferring
[1:16:31] himself to Christ the God
[1:16:35] man the god man and the Bible says that
[1:16:40] this man
[1:16:42] Jesus this man every
[1:16:46] knee every knee shall
[1:16:49] bow to the name of Jesus all of
[1:16:55] Heaven
[1:16:56] name name has been
[1:17:01] transferred to
[1:17:03] Jesus God
[1:17:05] man God before the
[1:17:09] cross it was before the
[1:17:11] cross Jesus what did he do he he denied
[1:17:15] himself he he he he he died to he became
[1:17:19] a he he died a criminal's
[1:17:22] death he gave
[1:17:24] himself he gave his life he gave his
[1:17:28] life for
[1:17:30] us the reason I'm
[1:17:32] here is because there was a man there
[1:17:36] was a man that gave his life that had
[1:17:40] gotten a
[1:17:42] transfer he received a
[1:17:45] transfer that's why people when they say
[1:17:48] oh hear the
[1:17:50] tapes hear the tapes every one of them I
[1:17:54] I hear them all every day I hear a
[1:17:57] tape but but what about and people
[1:18:01] say well brother Bram is my my my
[1:18:04] pastor I'll do respect to brother
[1:18:07] Bram I'll do respect but there was
[1:18:10] another
[1:18:11] man there there was a man that was
[1:18:15] transferred I didn't get this on my
[1:18:18] own I didn't receive this on my
[1:18:21] own there had to be a transfer of
[1:18:26] heart I would be a
[1:18:30] disgrace if I didn't give my
[1:18:32] life that would been a
[1:18:35] disgrace to to my to my to brother Tommy
[1:18:39] that that would be a
[1:18:41] disgrace that he he gave his
[1:18:43] life that that he gave his life for me
[1:18:47] and then I would
[1:18:49] say I would
[1:18:51] say I don't have a message
[1:18:55] today in other words you're you're just
[1:18:58] like the Rich Young
[1:18:59] roer or I would be like the Rich Young
[1:19:02] roer because to have eternal life is to
[1:19:06] live for others so in other words the
[1:19:09] Rich Young
[1:19:10] laer he was saying he was saying living
[1:19:14] for others doesn't concern
[1:19:17] me taking up a cross and
[1:19:20] dying that that doesn't concern
[1:19:25] me let's think about it that that would
[1:19:28] be a
[1:19:30] disgrace that would be a
[1:19:32] disgrace i i people I I I don't
[1:19:35] understand how how how people say or or
[1:19:37] or ministers
[1:19:40] say I don't have a message
[1:19:43] today you don't have a message
[1:19:45] today what were you
[1:19:48] doing that now that's just me now now
[1:19:52] forgive me
[1:19:54] I love you right but but what are you
[1:19:57] doing I I can't think of one
[1:20:01] scripture in a morning that a message
[1:20:04] don't
[1:20:08] come I I didn't I didn't ask to be a
[1:20:11] minister I I I I didn't I didn't choose
[1:20:14] to that that I remember
[1:20:18] of according to the
[1:20:20] prophet I chose it
[1:20:23] right but I I don't have no remembrance
[1:20:25] of it right I I I didn't ask for this
[1:20:29] God just gave it to me all I know is
[1:20:33] that one day I was in sin I was walking
[1:20:37] one
[1:20:38] way and all of a
[1:20:41] sudden something
[1:20:43] happened where I I I just turned
[1:20:46] around H it had nothing to do with
[1:20:50] it it was God that was holding
[1:20:54] me and then he just turned me
[1:20:57] around I was the chiefest of
[1:21:00] Sinners I was I was the worst and
[1:21:02] violist among
[1:21:04] you but Come Ye
[1:21:06] Sinners Come Ye all you
[1:21:10] Sinners Jesus
[1:21:12] blood Jesus
[1:21:15] blood can cleans you it'll cleanse the
[1:21:19] viest of
[1:21:21] sinners it'll take you from the
[1:21:24] mud and pick you
[1:21:26] up and guess what it's going to it's
[1:21:30] going to uh express its life through
[1:21:34] you so unless you eat my
[1:21:37] flesh and drink my blood unless you have
[1:21:42] communion you have no life in
[1:21:45] you
[1:21:46] now there was a talking about
[1:21:50] Peter Peter said
[1:21:53] he said Thou Art the
[1:21:57] Christ Peter
[1:22:00] said when Jesus asked will you leave
[1:22:05] too Peter stepped
[1:22:08] up and he
[1:22:10] said where are we gonna
[1:22:12] go right and then Jesus
[1:22:15] said whom shall we go and then Jesus
[1:22:18] said
[1:22:19] uh if any man leave his father and
[1:22:21] mother and all his house and
[1:22:24] [Music]
[1:22:27] job and Peter said we we've left it all
[1:22:31] Lord
[1:22:33] right so
[1:22:35] Peter right he was in The Garden of
[1:22:38] Gethsemane and and they went to
[1:22:41] apprehend
[1:22:43] Jesus and Peter took out his sword and
[1:22:45] and cut
[1:22:47] him and you can type that however you
[1:22:49] want
[1:22:51] to what it's basically telling
[1:22:54] you is that Peter had something
[1:22:57] different about
[1:23:00] him and so one night think about
[1:23:05] this there's 12
[1:23:08] disciples 12 so just take 12 amongst you
[1:23:12] right 12 amongst right they're they're
[1:23:16] all in a
[1:23:17] boat and you know how how we are you
[1:23:21] know you know how we are
[1:23:24] or you know how I am
[1:23:25] right oh man went through such
[1:23:30] trial nobody has
[1:23:34] problem wow there nobody knows my
[1:23:37] trouble right so there was these 12
[1:23:41] men they were in a
[1:23:43] boat they were in the
[1:23:45] dark all 12 of
[1:23:48] them were in the
[1:23:50] dark it was dark for all all
[1:23:54] 12 the
[1:23:56] waves they were they were
[1:23:59] high the waves in our
[1:24:02] life they were hard for they were high
[1:24:04] for all 12 of
[1:24:10] them and then the ship began to
[1:24:14] rock it was it was rocking for all 12 of
[1:24:18] them and then all of a sudden all 12 of
[1:24:22] them
[1:24:23] saw the same thing they all saw the same
[1:24:27] vision they all saw the same
[1:24:30] thing but Peter was the only one that
[1:24:36] decided he said is that you
[1:24:39] Lord what about the other
[1:24:41] 12 it was one Peter he said is that you
[1:24:46] Lord if it's you B me to
[1:24:51] come they were all in the same
[1:24:53] boat they were in the same
[1:24:57] trial it was rough for all of
[1:24:59] them but Peter was the only one that
[1:25:03] night that walked on
[1:25:06] water he was the only one and they were
[1:25:10] in the same
[1:25:12] situation tonight we can be in the same
[1:25:16] building have the same message see the
[1:25:20] same vision but some of us aren't
[1:25:22] walking on
[1:25:25] water some of us aren't walking on
[1:25:28] water why because it takes a
[1:25:31] transfer it takes a changing of the
[1:25:34] Mind a change of the
[1:25:36] mind
[1:25:38] now it was given a Chinese scholar in
[1:25:42] closing it was he was he was given a
[1:25:45] copy of the New
[1:25:48] Testament how how many heard this no no
[1:25:53] this Chinese
[1:25:56] scholar
[1:25:58] chines he he he was given a copy of the
[1:26:00] New
[1:26:02] Testament right and and and he said hey
[1:26:04] would you would you read
[1:26:06] this read it out and uh uh he he had
[1:26:11] read the
[1:26:14] Quran he he had read the
[1:26:17] vas he he had read the all the sacred
[1:26:20] books and and so the man came back to
[1:26:25] him the true
[1:26:28] story and so the man comes back to
[1:26:31] him and he says did did you read the New
[1:26:36] Testament he said I did I read it all
[1:26:39] the way through so what was the most
[1:26:43] amazing thing that you you read in
[1:26:45] [Music]
[1:26:48] there and the man says Oh I thought he
[1:26:51] was going to say
[1:26:54] the the the most amazing thing that I
[1:26:57] read was that Jesus was born of a
[1:27:02] virgin right and I thought to myself
[1:27:05] well no no no maybe
[1:27:07] maybe maybe maybe he's gonna say that a
[1:27:12] man died and
[1:27:15] resurrected that that was the greatest
[1:27:18] thing that that that that maybe that he
[1:27:21] was going to say that he had ever
[1:27:25] read and he said so so what did you find
[1:27:27] out was the most amazing
[1:27:31] thing and and and he said over in
[1:27:33] Ephesians
[1:27:34] 2 he says I I I found the most amazing
[1:27:37] thing that I I've ever
[1:27:40] read if you can give me Ephesians
[1:27:48] 2 in
[1:27:51] closing
[1:27:52] I got to find it I I got I got to read
[1:27:54] it from my
[1:27:56] Bible sometimes I get too
[1:28:00] excited this excites
[1:28:03] me and then and then I end up saying
[1:28:11] share as I get
[1:28:13] excited and if I had one of the Sunday
[1:28:17] school's
[1:28:19] children is it in English
[1:28:23] like my my grandson says we're going to
[1:28:25] go visit certain
[1:28:28] people the kids speak
[1:28:35] Spanish he said the most amazing thing
[1:28:37] that I've ever
[1:28:39] read was and ye who ha he
[1:28:45] quickened who was dead in trespasses and
[1:28:51] sin where in times
[1:28:56] past you walked according to the course
[1:28:58] of the
[1:29:00] world according to the prince of the
[1:29:02] power of the
[1:29:05] air the spirit that now
[1:29:09] worketh in the children of
[1:29:13] Disobedience and he says but what what
[1:29:15] really got
[1:29:17] me was the end of that
[1:29:20] chapter he said now
[1:29:24] therefore ye are no more
[1:29:30] strangers and
[1:29:32] foreigners but fellow
[1:29:36] citizens and stay with the
[1:29:39] Saints and the
[1:29:41] household of God he said I've read the
[1:29:46] Quran I've read all the sacred
[1:29:49] books but I've never read
[1:29:52] where a man's
[1:29:54] God where a man's
[1:29:58] God makes the
[1:30:00] man his
[1:30:02] habitation so my question
[1:30:06] is does your
[1:30:08] God does your God does he live in
[1:30:13] you are you
[1:30:15] feasting on his
[1:30:18] flesh are you

[1:30:27] are you the
[1:30:31] inhabitation of
[1:30:32] Elohim of the
[1:30:34] one that gave
[1:30:37] himself to become the god
[1:30:39] man so that you in
[1:30:43] turn can become
[1:30:46] him let's stand to our feet
