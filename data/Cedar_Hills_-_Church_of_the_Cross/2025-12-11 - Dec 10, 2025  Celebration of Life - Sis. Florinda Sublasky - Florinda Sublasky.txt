[música] [música] [música] [música] [música] [música] [música] [música] [música] [música] [música] [música] [música] [música] [música] [música] [música] God bless you this morning, this evening. Forgive me. Stand to our feet. We're going to open up with the word of prayer. If you could buy your heads with me. Gracious Lord, we just want to come before you this time and [música] we just want to thank you for Lord, even though it's a hard time that [música] we're filling here, Lord, in the physical, Lord, we know that there's a a celebration that we can have of this beautiful godly Christian life here before us. And as we're here to celebrate the one of your daughters, Lord, one of your saints, Lord, we just want you to receive all the glory, knowing that all the things that came from her life, Lord, she served you with all your all her heart. And we just want to thank you, Lord, that those things showed. And we just want to thank you that we're able to once again gather here in your house of worship to give you the glory Lord and to give the honor. We just want to thank you as we commit ourselves into your hands. We may you just take full control of the service and take full control of the musicians and the ministers this evening and song leaders, Lord, and everything that is on the hearts of your children. Lord, we just pray for your sweet peace and comfort to fill this room. May you just bless those that have come from from far and those that are have travel from near. Lord, we just want to thank you as we give you the glory in all these things evening. We ask it in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. If you be seated at this time, we're going to have brother Jess Jenor come up and give the opening of the service. Good evening. For those who don't know me, I am Jasky. I'm Florki's son. On behalf of my family and my mother, I want to express our heartf thanks to each of you for being here to honor and to celebrate her life. Your presence is a testament to the life we are gathered to celebrate and it is a deep comfort to us. My mother was above all else a woman of steadfast faith. She placed God first and everything and that devotion was the foundation of our home. My mother's Christian faith was her compass. She lived with God at the center of her world and the light guided everything she did. Uh if I could describe my mother with one word, it would be rooted. She was rooted in her faith in Jesus Christ and rooted in the love for her family. Some of my fondest memories are of our home which always had an open door. It was a hub for fellowship filled with spiritual brothers and sisters. On many nights, we would stay up late uh into the night singing songs of praise. My mother's life wasn't about grand gestures or loud words. It was about a thousand small beautiful things. It was the warmth in her voice on the phone, the prayers she whispered over us, and the way her home smelled of something good. She lived out Corinthians 13. In our daily lives, she was patient, she was kind. She kept no record of wrongs. She was always protected, always trusted, always hoped, always persevered. Uh my mother was beloved by many. There was just something about her. A generosity of spirit, a quiet kindness, a profound humility that made everyone she met feel valued. She was and remains my guide and example. My mother had a special gift for making everyone feel seen and cherished. Her gentle spirit drew people in. She lived her faith through action. She deeply loved her church family here and often spoke of the kindness shown by her pastor CB Paris and his wife, associate pastor Tommy Fed and his wife and so many of you that are seated here today in this congregation. You brought her joy, fellowship and practical love especially in her later years. And for that our family is eternally grateful. I would be remiss if I did not offer a special heartfelt thank you to my sister Sarah. You were not just her daughter. You were her devoted caretaker, her companion, her earthly angel. The selfless love you showed her was a living testimony. And we are all so grateful. And mom would surely say God has a special place for you. Personally, I will miss the simple routines, the phone calls, the weekend visits. More broadly, her gentle ways impacted more people than I can count. Well, I cannot thank everyone who impacted her life. I know that God sees and will reward every act of love shown towards her. Another another verse that brings us great comfort today is Psalms 1161. Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his beautiful servants. While our hearts are aching with loss, we have the profound, unshakable hope that this is not the end. We do not say goodbye forever. We say we'll see you soon. Thank you, Mom, for everything, for your love, your guidance. and your example. You finished your course. We will miss you every single day, but we will hold you in our hearts until we see you again in heaven. We love you. Amen. Beautiful words. This time we're going to have Stepen Gig Jr. come forward to read the November 28th, 2025. surrounded by her family was a day that our beloved mother, grandmother, greatgrandmother and devoted servant of the Lord, such a gentle soul passed away peacefully and went home to be with the Lord Jesus. Born on July 4th, 1942 to Epetio and Isabel Garcia Lorinda lived a life full of love, faith, and generosity. She was the proud mother of four children. Sandra Castillo and husband Mark of Santa Clara. Sarah Sublaski of Las Cruis. Uh Jo Sublaski and wife Michelle of El Paso. Terry Gegos and husband Stepen of Santa Clara. Her family was her greatest joy and she cherished every moment spent with her children. 13 grandchildren and 12 greatgrandchildren. Florina had a passion for cooking and her kitchen was always a place of warmth and comfort for family and friends. Her meals brought people together and created lasting memories. Above all, Florinda dedicated her life to the Lord, living each day with unwavering faith and grace. Her legacy of love, kindness, and devotion will live on in the hearts of all who knew her. She will be deeply missed but forever remembered. She was preceded in death by her beloved husband Hesus Jose Sublas and her parents Epetaio and Isabel García and five siblings Anita Murío, Amalia Silva, Manuel García, Consuelo Martínez Saul García. Visitation was Wednesday, December 10th, 2025 from 5 to6 p.m. at Cedar Hills Church of the Cross for family only. The evening service will commence at 7 p.m. with Pastor Mark Castel and associate Pastor Tommy Pet Jr. The funeral service will take place on Thursday, December 11th at 10 a.m. with Pastor Caleb Bettis officiing. Intermit will take place at Masonic Cemetery where she will be laid to rest. Casket bears include Mark Castillo Jr. Steven Gaegos Jr. Joski Zachari Galegos, Nicolas Castillo and Gable Gegos. Honorary casket bears include Stephen Gego, Senor, Jessica, Karina, Jennifer, Hannah, Alissa, Bethany, Julian, Jesse, Joe, Jr. Tiffany, Amanda, Jasmine, Victoria Austines, Marcaste and Michelle Sublas. Amen. Praise the Lord. Now, it's uh hard to it's hard to say don't cry because she's gone. But it's also a wonderful thing that we can get around and celebrate a life well lived, a very beautiful life well lived. There are more good memories than there are bad memories. And uh when it come to my grandma Linda, I'm very appreciative of that. All the things the family and friends have to say and and the brothers and sisters of this church and the constant wonderful things I'm always hearing. It was uh brought great joy to my ears. So a personal thank you from me to the the church at Cedar Hills. We really really appreciate your brothers and your uh friendships and the uh support you gave especially to my grandma her last years. May God bless you and all your efforts. Amen. Amen. We're going to have a song at this time by the uh the grandchildren if we can come up and and give that song. Amen. A song that reminded us of our beloved grammar. We're going to sing más allá del.

Dios les bendiga a cada uno de ustedes en esta noche y damos gracias de parte de los Martínez a toda la gente que asistió a este servicio. Antes de cantar este canto, no más quiero expresar unas cosas de mi tía Florinda, es la última de los Garcías. Quiero decir que cuando ella estaba en vida por los años 90, la procuraba todo el tiempo y y la quise mucho y la quiero todavía porque era como una madre para mí. Cuando nos movimos de Texas, del sur de Texas para acá, ella fue una ayuda tremenda para nosotros y muchas veces no sabemos cómo expresar aquella gratitud. de ella, pero me recuerdo una vez que estábamos en Florida y llegamos de vacaciones, creo, llegamos a esa parte que se llama Pensicola, Florida y nos arrimamos al agua, estaba azul, agua bien hermosa y mi tía Florinda se bajó y se metió el agua. Me acuerdo que decía Carlos, dijo, "Voy a nadar por abajo del agua. Quiero decirte que si no salgo me sacas para afuera." Yo me regar y este y me recuerdo de eso. En otra ocasión también salió de una tienda o de la iglesia, no me recuerdo, y no más se subió al carro y se sentó y ese carro no era de ella, se parecía a Y volteó para atrás y miró al chóer ahí que se le quedaba viendo. Ah, qué viejo mugroso. Gracias y era el que cosas de esas me recuerdo de ella y la amé mucho a mi tía. Bueno, para para terminar vamos a cantar la tierra de mis ensueños. Hay una tierra llena de encantos. No iré a morar. Bella y fragante, el maestro [música] va a reinar. [música] Hay una tierra, aves que cantan trenos de amor y caminando por los jardines seo al Señor la [música] tierra de mis ensueños de oro. Aquella donde está, Señor, [música] la tierra donde mi alma adora y a mi rey y a [música] mi salvador. Viene mi tierra, [música] cielo brillante como el cristal. [música] Rayos muy claros y [música] soludos cure su faz. La tierra [música] es blanca como el armo. Qué grande ideal. Y sobre flores Jesús [música] descansa. Yo voy a cantar la tierra de mis ensños de oro. [música] Aquella donde está señor [música] la tierra donde mi alma adora a mi rey y a [música] mi salvador. Allá [música] en el cielo sus calles de oro preparan ya. Y sus vórticos encalanados prestos están. [música] Y un santo ángel muy precioso y con mucho afán. Prepara el libro donde [música] mi nombre escrito está. [música] La tierra de mis ensueños de oro. Aquí [música] donde está, Señor, la tierra donde mi alma adora y a mi rey [música] y a mi salvador. Haya en el [música] cielo sus calles de oro. Prepara allá y sus [música] pórticos encalanados de estar. y un santo ángel muy precioso y con [música] mucho afán. Prepara el libro donde mi [música] nombre escrito está. La tierra de mis ensueños de oro. Aquella donde [música] está, Señor, la tierra donde mi alma adora [música] a mi rey, a mi salvador. La Biblia dice que esto es muy cierto, que es la verdad, [música] que nada impuro es permitido entrar. [música] Es el sitio solo los santos [música] pueden llegar. Que Jesucristo sobre la puerta para entrar [música] a tierra de mis [música] ensucios de oro. Aquella [música] donde está, Señor, la tierra donde mi alma adora a mi rey, a mi [música] salvado. Dios bendiga. [aplausos] Beautiful. Thank you for that. God bless you. Amen. This time we're going to have Bethanig to give some words about our beautiful. Amen. I want to talk about my grandma, a woman who felt like pure love in human form. She was the sweetest, softest soul I've ever known. Honestly, she was a real life angel. Everything she did, she did with God in her heart. She lived for him every single second of every single day. And you could see that in the way she treated everyone around her. Even when people hurt her or didn't treat her right, she always chose love. That was just who she was. Some of my favorite memories of her are the simple ones. Like when she would make tortillas, she would hum a certain way. She would send me dozens at a time and I could eat half a dozen in one sitting with butter. Those little moments, they were her love language. I remember the comfort of her old apartment, how warm it felt, how peaceful it felt. I remember her whispering prayers over me every single night I slip there. That's a kind of love that stays with you forever. And I remember the aprot tree in her yard, the one my mom had planted when she was a little girl. I used to climb that tree to help grandma pick Apricot so she could make her delicious jam. There was something so beautiful about it. The way the tree held pieces of all of us. My mom planted it, grandma nurtured it, and I along with my siblings and cousins grew up climbing it. And I think about how many generations of us grew up around the same place, how much life and love we shared under its branches. It's a kind of nostalgia that feels like home. I didn't get to tell her goodbye and that hurts. But the last memory I have of her is one I hold so close, her smile. the one that couldide up a whole room and her laugh. Her laugh was so beautiful and contagious. I loved making her laugh. It felt like sunshine. Even in the middle of this pain, there's something that gives me peace. I know exactly where she is. I know her soul is an eternal life with Jesus. She's no longer suffering, no longer tired, no longer fighting. She's finally in the place she's been ready to go for a long time. A place filled with rest, love, and everything she lived her her whole life for. Knowing that brings comfort to my heart even when it hurts. Grandma, I pray every day that I become even half the woman you were. If I could carry even a piece of your kindness and your faith, then I know I'll be ok. I know you're with me. To my mom, I want to say something to you. I know this is the hardest thing you've ever walked through, but I want you to know that everything beautiful about grandma is in you. Her strength, her heart, her beauty, her gentleness, and her kindness. You carry all of that. Auntie Sarah, aunt Sandra, and Uncle Joe, you carry it, too. Every piece of gramma that made her so special lives on in each one of you. And the way you love, the way you show up for people, the way you hold this family together, she's in all of you. None of you were going through this alone. We're going to get through this together the way she would have wanted with love, with faith, and with the strength she taught us. Grandma, thank you for loving us so deeply. Thank you for your prayers, your warmth, and your light. We will carry you with us forever and until we see you again, I know you're resting peacefully in the arms of Jesus right where you always knew you were meant to be. [aplausos] Amen. Beautiful words, beautiful stories. Man, I remember that uh apricot tree. Think at one one time or another we all climbed up in it. If you didn't climb, you didn't get so we all climbed. Praise the Lord. [música] En este tritio a un palacio voy caminando aquí. [música] hasta llegar aí. Hermoso sitio tan santo y bello, ¿dónde moraré? por la eternidad. Cruzando el cruzando elevo hasta llegar allá a la mansión de luz para vivir con mi Jesús. Ahí no habrá dolor ni tanto para mí. [música] Ahí yo cantaré y estoy [música] feliz con mi Jesús. Qué dicha tan hermosa cuando encuentre a mi Jesús. Era un momento sin igual, el cual no se podrá comparar y a llegar allá. Me gozaré con él [música] y yo seré feliz, pues seré con [música] mi Jesús. Qué dicha tan hermosa. [música] Qué dicha tan hermosa cuando encuentre a mi Jesús, será un momento sin igual, el cual no se podrá comparar y a llegar allá. Me gozaré. con él y yo [música] seré feliz, pues con mi Jesús. [música] Praise the Lord. Let's stand to our feet this time. Let's sing that song, Amazing Grace, as we get ready to turn the service over to our brother Tommy [música] Bettis Jr. Amen. [música] Amazing grace. the sound that [música] like me. I once was L but now I'm was but now I see [música] it was great that God my heart and grace [música] my relief precious that grace of the Praise God. Praise [música] God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. [música] Thank you. Thank you very much. Praise God. Praise God. [música] [música] Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. But when weve been there, when we been there 100,000 years right [música] shining as a sun. We've known last days to sing. [música] del evangelio, no era una persona que hablaba de Jesús, es una persona que vivía Ella una dama para ella misma era dama que vivía para otros. Por eso es la vida eterna, es de vivir para otros. mientras que entramos escrituras de ella favoritas de capítulo 91 del libro de los Salmos, no voy a tomar mucho de su tiempo, hermano Mark, pero voy a tomar suficiente de ello para que sepas qué tipo de persona que estamos tratando. No hablamos de alguien no más que iba a la iglesia. No hablamos de alguien que no más que viene a la iglesia, hablamos de una cristiana. Dile a su vecino, hermana Florinda no era lo más iglesia, ella era cristiana. La Biblia nos habla en Salmos 91. El que habite aligo del Altísimo morará bajo de la sombra del omnipotente. Señor Jesús, vengo delante de ti en esta tarde feliz en esta noche para celebrar la vida de esa gran dama. Ella no era alguien que no más hablaba de ti. Ella vivía para ti. Señor Dios, pedimos que bendigas a la familia, todos los amigos las bendigas igualmente. Toda la familia de la iglesia y todos los que tenían el privilegio de conocerla. Est con nosotros. Consuélanos en esta noche en el nombre de Jesús. Amén. Pueden tomar sus asientos de parte de nuestra iglesia, nuestra familia. Queremos extender las condolescencias a la familia de hermana Florinda, a la hermana Sandra, a hermana Sara, al hermano Jo, hermana Terry y a toda la familia. Es una hermosa bastante bonita. que realmente representan a su madre muy bien. Hermanos y hermanas, ahora somos huérfanos. Todos nosotros que estamos en ese ser llamado club, que han perdido su padre y madre, somos huérfanos. Pero sabemos lo que Dios nos ha dado es la bendita esperanza de la resurrección. ¿Cuántos cristianos tenemos aquí? Nosotros mismos creyemos la muerte, el futuro y la resurrección de Jesucristo. razón que estamos sentados aquí en esta noche para celebrar esta vida es que creíamos que hace 2000 años atrás Jesucristo resucitó victoriosamente de la tumba y dijo esas palabras, "Porque yo vivo, vosotros viviréis. Por eso estamos aquí. Por eso nos entristamos como los que no tienen esperanza, porque creemos la muerte, sepultura y la resurrección de nuestro Señor Jesucristo. Otra vez fue mi privilegio, mi placer, mi honra para hablar a mi hermana Floranda y decirle que era mi hermana. No solamente mi hermana, pero mi amiga era tan amante a nosotros, amoroso. Ella amaba a nuestra familia, ella amaba la familia de ella. Ella amaba la familia de amó a su pastor, amaba el ministerio. Y esa dama era la personificación de su nombre, flor hermosa. Todo lo que ella tocaba se volvía oro. esa mujer, usted sabía que Jesús vivía en su vida, pudiese entrar en su casa y sentir la presencia del Señor. Quizás entrabas quizás poco carisbajo y ella te hace unas tortillitas. Yo no sé cuántos gustaron de su cocinar. Si usted comió la comida de ella, eran bien bendito. Si tuviste la oportunidad de estar en su presencia, cuando usted se iba de allí, usted se sintió animado. Esa era una persona que sabía la razón por cual que existía. Muchas veces que nuestra iglesia dice a veces, pero viene un tiempo. Cuando creemos a lo que Dios dice en su palabra, el cielo y la tierra pasarán, pero su palabra permanece eterno. Permanece eterno en el corazón de los creyentes. Quiero tener unos creyentes en esta noche que tomar a Dios por su palabra y creer su palabra. Ahora dile a su vecino, "Yo existo para ti. Existo para ti." Dile a su vecino, "Te amo". El mero atrás. Quiero decirles algo en esta noche. Yo existo para ustedes. Yo amo a ustedes. Vida eterna no es para que vives para ti mismo. Vida eterno es que tanto dinero tiene. La vida eterna es de vivir para alguien más. Si tuviéramos un ejemplo en nuestra iglesia de una persona que no vivía para ella misma, ella vivía para su familia, vivía para la familia de éramos tan orgullosos de ella. Muchos de los tiempos más grandiosos que hemos tenido, nos invitaría y me decía, "No me pides que te haga comida. Dígame lo que quieren comer. ¿Cuándo fue la última vez que algo así de alguien? Vamos a comer esto. Si te gusta a ti, está bien. Y si no, no. Ella decía, "Si no quieres mi dígame, yo hago algo más. No me preguntes que haga tortill para ti. Dile, ¿cuántas tortillas necesitas?" Cuando lo visitamos al último, nos miró mientras que estaba sentado en su asiento, casi ya no caminaba. Dice, "La próxima vez que viene quiero hacerles unos frijolitos y unas tortillitas. Había una razón que tan enfermo como yo estaba el viernes pasado, Dios me dio una pequeña ventana y me sentí mejor y me dijeron que no iba a durar mucho más ella. Yo y mi esposa fuimos al hospital, no por causa mía. para honrar a la mujer y la dama que ella es. Esta dama era dama digno del evangelio. Esa era una dama que haó la morada de Dios. Ella era tan orgullosa del trabajo que estábamos haciendo. ¿Y por qué no? para ser mejor para nuestro pueblo. Quiero que sepan de los siguientes minutos, lo que ha sido derramado o vaciado dentro de nosotros, la palabra que ella creía, que Dios mismo envió su hijo unigénito y su nombre es Jesucristo. Jesucristo envió a su ángel y su nombre es William Marian Branham. Es lo que hermana Florinda creía. Eso es lo que hacía vivir la manera que ella vivía. Eso hacía actuar como actuaba. Había hallado el escondedero de Dios. Cuando hay ese lugar donde su nombre está escrito por dentro de eso te pertenece. Es una posesión. Es algo que una iglesia no te lo puede dar, algo que la religión no te puede dar. La única forma de recibir la presencia de Dios todopoderoso. Tienes que tener un encuentro personal con él. Cuando tienes ese encuentro, jamás serás la misma persona. Una iglesia no te lo puede dar. Solamente la persona del Señor Jesús es el único que di, "Yo soy el camino. Anda la iglesia. Yo soy el camino, la verdad y la vida. Y nadie viene al Padre sino por mí. Cuando usted recibe la palabra, recibes esa porción que está dentro de ti. Esa porción no viene de un libro. Esa persona viene de la presencia del todopoderoso. Lo vuelvo a decir, esa persona, esa presencia no viene de un libro, viene de una relación. Es Dios tocando al ser humano y haciéndolo ella o él, él de él mismo. Uno de esos días me voy a mejorar, hermano. Usted va a ser lo que eres ahorita. Esos días voy a ir a la iglesia. vas a hacer lo que estás haciendo hoy. Uno de esos días cuando tengo el tiempo, nadie es prometido el día de mañana. Algunos salen de este lugar y jamás volvernos a ver. Yo oro que no es así. Algunos en la mañana no van a despertar. Déjeme decirte lo que pasó en el día 28 noviembre. Puedo decir lo que pasó el 28 de noviembre. Había un anuncio en el cielo. ¿No me creen? Había un anuncio en el cielo. Todavía no me crees. Esa es una celebración de cristiano. Déj lo que pasó el día 28 de noviembre. Había un gran anuncio en el cielo. Quisiera tener que Malaquías 45. Hay un gran anuncio en el cielo. El anuncio fue esto. Hermana Florinda llega a casa. No están tristes en este quizás están tristes aquí. Quizás su cuerpo aquí, pero ella ya no está aquí. Mañana lloraremos porque vamos a decir que ya ya se ya se fue de este cuerpo. Hermano Joía 28 cuerpo que entregó su espíritu ya no podía caminar. Ella me metió en un cuerpo nuevo. Quisiera tener gente que amar al Señor. Si estó dentro de otro cuerpo. Es la verdad, hermano. Déj decir lo que el apóstol Pablo dijo. Si ese cuerpo, si ese tabernáculo, esa habitación de mi morada se ha descuido, tenemos otro esperando. ¿Qué dice que la esperanza de la resurrección? Pues algo que todavía no lo podemos captar. Déjem decir lo que aconteció nuestro tiempo. Un hombre llamado William Maró más allá de la cortina del tiempo. que gritar aquí ahorita cruzado más allá de la cortina del y nos dijo lo que estaba al otro lado. Ese otro lado es más real de lo que es aquí. Pero en noviembre 28 coros comenzaron a liñarse en las calles. Usted no sabe lo que todos los corros comenzaron a alinearse en las calles y todos los músicos comenzaron a practicar y comenzaron a cantar. Porque en unos momentos uno de ellos iba a regresar al hogar. No fuimos hechos para este mundo. Uno de nuestros tros llegado del otro lado. No es un mito, no es una fantasía, es la palabra de Dios traído por nosotros, por Jesucristo, que dijo esas palabras, que no turben nuestros corazones. Familia, no deje que su corazón sea turbada. Mi tía y todos los santos que han ido antes. Regijo tien [risas] levantando y gritando los cantos de mientras que se alisten para ella. cualquier momento las puertas van a iban a abrir. ¿De dónde viene? Y ella viene. Ahí viene ahí por de la eternidad. Miraron la eternidad acercando la eternidad. Miraron a la eternidad aproximando a la eternidad. Y no estaban viendo un ser humano de tiempo. Estaban viendo un humano que había recibido la vida eterna. La eternidad miró a la eternidad y ellos se abrazaron porque ella había regresado al hogar. que en esta noche celebración que uno de nuestros que ha regresado al hogar [aplausos] sea de buen ánimo. Yo he vencido al mundo. En este mundo tendrás muchas tribulaciones, pero sea de buen ánimo. Hermana Florinda ha ido a su galardón. Ahora nos cae a nosotros para vivir la vida para poder alcanzar donde ella está. Yo existo por causa de ustedes. Ella existía para ustedes. Yo amo a usted. Ella los amó. Y lo más importante, el Jesús que moraba dentro de ella ama a cada uno de ustedes. Dios le bendiga. [aplausos] [aplausos] Dios bendiga, hermano Tomasito. Dios bendiga a cada uno de ustedes. En esta vida hay la suegra y el yerno. Yo soy el yerno y ahora tengo la libertad de hablar de mi suegra, pero para la honra y la gloria del Señor. Porque hubo una mujer que amó al Señor. Hacemos bromas sobre las suegras, pero después de hoy ya no puedo hacer más bromas, pero siempre tenía una actitud tan positiva cuando hacía estas bromas. Solo me daba una sonrisa y creo que está sonriendo ahorita, ya no tiene que lidiar conmigo. Estamos aquí esta tarde para darle gracias a Dios por una vida que caminó entre nosotros. No hay nada más grande en la vida que conocer a alguien. Eso es una bendición. que tiene a Dios en ellos porque anhela estar alrededor de ellos. Lo que ellos tienen usted también lo quiere. Y si lo que ellos tienen es eterno, ¿quién no quiere la eternidad aquí? Para eso estamosendo, si se pueden poner de pie conmigo para leer un verso, se encuentra en el libro de Romanos 14, verso 8. Mis condolencias esta tarde, la familia Sublas, familia García, sus hijos, los nietos, vicennietos. ha dejado un gran vacío, pero Jesús está aquí para llenar y para recordarle que esto no es el fin de la vida. Para ella solo está empezando. Ya no podía caminar. Decía, "Mi hijo, ora por mí para que pueda caminar." Y y yo decía, "Suegra, voy a orar por ti, pero tienes que hacer tu parte también. Tienes que caminar, tienes que levantarte." Bueno, ahorita no está caminando. Ella está corriendo allá en el cielo. Es una jovencita, su cabello fluyendo en el aire, está brincando con gozo y quizás está gritando, clamando. Estoy tan contento que di mi corazón al Señor porque fue la mejor decisión que pude hacer. Amén. Pues si vivimos para el Señor vivimos y si morimos para el Señor morimos. Así pues, sea que vivamos o que muramos del Señor somos. Dios les bendiga. Puede tomar su asiento. Las palabras que voy a hablar esta tarde es con este propósito en mente, es que tenemos una esperanza esta tarde y esa esperanza es Jesús. Si usted no conoce a Jesús, no tiene esperanza. Pero si conoce a Jesús, tiene esperanza. y tiene una ancla y no hay nada que lo puede separar del amor de Cristo. nada, no sea la muerte o la enfermedad o los problemas o problemas familiares o del trabajo, ni siquiera la enfermedad lo puede separar del amor de Cristo, porque profundo en usted tiene un ancla y esa ancla es Jesús y es la la roca inmovible que nunca puede ser movida. La hermana Florinda estaba anclada a esa roca. Usted, hermano, solo dice porque fue su suegra. Antes que fuera mi suegra era ya ella ya amaba a Jesús. Yo solo fue fui lo añadido. Alabado sea el Señor. El consuelo viene cuando escuchamos la palabra de Dios. La palabra de Dios es nuestro bálsamo. Cuando se siente deprimido, cuando se siente cansado y desanimado, se siente que nadie lo ama. Se ha sentido así, se siente triste que nadie lo ama, nadie no le importa a nadie, nadie me quiere abrazar. Nadie me ha llamado, estoy solo en este mundo. Y está Jesús a su lado esperando que hable con él. El mejor amigo que puede tener es Jesús. Cuando llega el fin de su vida, Dios no va a ver la propiedad que usted tiene o cuántos coches tiene. No le importa cuánto dinero tiene en el banco o los que los ponen debajo del colchón. A él no le importa. Él está enfocado es en usted y en mí. Es la vida de él. Si mi vida está viviendo en él, entonces vamos a casa. Así que tome las palabras de Dios de corazón. Hay tiempo de llorar y tiempo de estar contento, feliz. Es un tiempo de ser feliz. Habrá un tiempo que va a sentir tristeza en su corazón, pero tome gozo porque el gozo viene la mañana. Habrá una resurrección, se levantarán los santos. Cuando suene la trompeta, los muertos en Cristo van a resucitar muertos y habrá un rapto y iremos a casa. La pregunta es, ¿quiere irse a casa? Porque como humanos, parte de nosotros no se quiere ir, no quiere ver que muera o que o que se ponga enferma, queremos que Dios la sane. Es la parte humana, pero la parte espiritual dice está ella está mejor allá que lo que estuvo aquí. está más feliz allá que lo que estuvo aquí. Allá realmente está alabando al Señor más que lo estuvo cuando estaba aquí, porque esto es solo un un ensayo por lo que nos espera. El hermano Branham dice esto. Él es el bálsamo de Galat, el bálsamo del cielo que Dios dio a su hijo para inucularlo a él y traer la prueba, la prueba de qué? Que en Cristo hay vida. Es la mejor vida que puede tener. Es vivir por él. Es el mejor lugar donde estamos en la casa del Señor, donde se mueven nuestros medios, donde nos da consuelo, nos da fuerza y nos recuerda que no somos de aquí como seres humanos. Cuando estaba creciendo, miramos hacia el futuro para ser exitoso, porque somos seres humanos. Queremos ser exitosos en la vida. Cuando consigué mi primero coche y mi Ford Mustang nuevecito, yo me sentía exitoso, un coche nuevo, ah, soltero, con mucho cabello, viviendo en casa, tenía una buena vida. un nuevo corte. No quería que nadie comiera en mi carro. No, no hay tiempo que el carro huela a hamburguesa, pero pasó el tiempo y ese gozo también falleció. Después de un tiempo había papas fritas del carro, había basura ahí y las ventanas todas sucias. No me importaba. ¿Por qué? Porque ese gozo se había ido. Pero hay un gozo que nunca va a morir. Ese gozo está en Jesús en buenos tiempos, en malos tiempos. es digno de ser alabado. Aunque estuvo enferma, aunque estuvo en medicamento, aún amaba al Señor, aún podía alabar al Señor. Está contento por ello. Él murió para que tuviéramos vida. Este mundo se está cayendo en la oscuridad. No sé si han notado, pero este mundo se está cayendo en oscuridad, se está oscureciendo más y más y está llegando a un lugar que el hombre no sabe si es hombre o mujer, no sabe si es un creyente o no. Cuando primero escuchamos el mensaje, hubo un gozo en nuestro corazón que habíamos recibido algo que nos había conmovido, pero a través de las edades se cae cosas y y la iglesia llega llega a hacer un trabajo. Ahora, ¿quién va a predicar? Oh, hermano Tomasito. Oh, hermano, lo voy a ver de casa. Hemos perdido ese gozo, pero ella nunca lo perdió. Su deseo era estar en la casa del Señor, viviendo por alabándole y siempre sabiendo que estaba orando por mí. Qué bendición tener una suegra. Primeramente que lo ama. Las suegras tienen una reputación mala. La mayoría de ellas. La mía me amaba. Un día estaba planchando mi mi camiseta en casa porque mi mamá me enseñó cómo planchar y estoy planchando. Mi esposa estaba ocupada haciendo algo y entra mi suegra y yo me aseguré que ella me viera porque estaba en el pasillo y me moví así para que me viera. mirarme un poco estresado y ella entra y dice estas palabras famosas. Ay no, ahí no. El hombre no debe de planchar su camisa. Es lo único que tengo que escuchar, iglesia. Y ella viene conmigo, dice, "Dame esa plancha." Y te la di. Me hice a un lado y dicen, "No deben de planchar su camisa." Y me miró hacia mi esposa cuando ella lo dijo, pero mi esposa no la estaba viendo ella. Qué bueno fue. Y y me dice, "¿Traes más camisas, mi hijo?" Mi hijo, fue lo único que tuve que hacer. Fui a al ropero y traje como 15 de ella. Hubiera visto los ojos de y fueron así. Está bien, ponlos ahí. Cuando venía a mi casa y me me miraba planchando camisas, está pensando, hermano, siempre está planchando en casa. solo cuando sé que ella va a venir de pasada, porque yo sabía que me lo me iba me lo iba a hacer por mí. En el cielo ya no está planchando más. Ella está regocijando Señor. Estoy tan contento por eso. El hermano Branham dice, dice, "Hermano, hermana, este mundo está cayendo, grupando en la oscuridad que el pecado en el 1959. Si allá atrás se estaba cayendo, ¿se imagina hoy en qué condición estamos hoy? Gracias a Dios que nuestra visión no está puesta en pero está puesta en Jesucristo. Porque si tienes su vista puesta en el mundo, se va a caer en depresión. Pero no mire al mundo, mírase a Jesús. Él es el Salvador. Dice, "Se están cayendo en oscuridad y en el pecado." Pero no porque no hay bálsamo en Galatá. Es porque la gente rehusa tomarlo. La salvación es de usted, pero la tiene que tomar. El gozo es de usted, pero la tiene que tomar. La felicidad es de usted, pero la tiene que tomar. La vida es de usted, pero la tiene que tomar. No es porque no hay poder que los puede limpiar, es porque no lo quieren. No es porque no hay gracia en Dios. Dios es lleno de gracia. Estamos viviendo en la edad de gracia que Dios ha sido tan bondadoso con nosotros. Hemos llegado hasta aquí por la gracia de Dios. Y si su gracia nos ha traído hasta este lugar, su gracia nos va a llevar más lejos, iglesia. Es porque no la quieren, porque rehusan tomarla. Pero la hermana Florinda lo aceptó, tomó esa inaculación que le dio vida, que le dio esperanza y le recordó que después de esta vida la vida empieza. Cuando tenemos servicios fúnebres, no es para la persona en el ataú. No sé si no sabía eso, pero no es para ella. A ella no le importa lo que yo digo o qué himnos. No está aquí para decir qué bonito. No, este servicio es para usted y para mí. Es para recordarlo que un día vamos a estar aquí. Ay, hermano, no habla de la muerte. Para un cristiano, la muerte es una bienvenida. ¿Ha pensado de eso? Que la muerte al fin es mejor que la vida en el principio porque cuando llega al fin nos recuerda. Estamos regresando de donde venimos. Regresamos a la eternidad, iglesia. Ella ya está en eternidad. Un servicio fúnebre es para honrar a la familia, para dejarlos saber la amamos a ella. Es lo que ella hizo para mí, para nosotros. Ella planchó mi mi camo, me amó. Mi hijo, "Lo que quieres que te cocine, te lo te lo hago." Tenía esa libertad que podía llamarla a ella y ordenar algo y lo iba a recibir y no me cobraba. Alabado sea el Señor, porque lo hacía con amor. Es para recordarnos que un día vamos a respirar nuestro último aliento. Que Dios nos conceda que ese último aliento sean las palabras de Jesús. He llegado hasta aquí, Padre. He vivido para ti. No he sido perfecto, pero tu sangre me ha cubierto. Tu sangre me ha lavado todos mis peados y me puedo parar delante de ti sabiendo. He sido lavado en la preciosa sangre del Señor Jesucristo. Iglesia, aún hay poder en el nombre de Jesús. No sé si lo cree, pero aún hay. Si le pregunta el esta poder en el nombre de Jesús él va, él temblaría antes de contestar. ¿Por qué? Porque la Biblia dice, "Al nombre de Jesús, los diablos tiemblan. Y si ellos tiemblan en temor, ¿qué nos debemos temblar con gozo? Por las llagas de Jesús hemos sido sanados. Somos más que victoriosos. Tiene que vivir una vida derrotada. Ya puede ser victorioso cada día, aunque esté en silla de ruedas, puede ser victorioso porque nuestra esperanza no está aquí. Como dijo el hermano es más real allá que lo que es aquí. Porque un día este púlpito va a cesar de existir, va a regresar donde vine al suelo. Su coche nuevo va a estar todo mojoso y también mocoso, todo desgastado. Va a regresar de donde vino. Pero hay una cosa que permanece eterno y eso es Jesucristo, su vida en usted. Hay una escritura. Eclesiastés 7. Mejor es el fin del negocio que su principio. Cuando era más joven había una escritura que me me tenía en pregunta y era Salmo 117 dice, "Estimada es a los ojos de Jehová la muerte de su santo." Yo me preguntaba, ¿por qué Dios tiene gozo cuando morimos? ¿Qué está aconteciendo? ¿Cuántos están contentos cuando alguien se muere en su en su familia? Y yo me preguntaba, Dios está contento cuando alguien muere. Yo pensaba que era el Dios de la vida y me di cuenta a través del profeta que en el principio estuvimos con él. éramos como el hijo pródigo que salió de casa, pero un día regresamos a casa y cuando regresamos, qué gozo fue y y me di cuenta, ahora sé porque Dios está contento, porque todo este tiempo está viendo a sus hijos estar en pruebas, pasar por las pruebas en la vida, perder un amado. ha sentido su dolor, su dolor, su enfermedad, su su dolor, su soledad, pero a través de todo se ha parado en su palabra usted porque se paró en su palabra, él le va a dar la bienvenida a casa. Gloria a su nombre. Estoy preparándome para para cerrar aquí. El domingo pasado me levanté temprano en la mañana con las 3 de la mañana no podía dormir. Era el domingo después que había fallecido mi suegra y cuando no puedo dormir escucho una cinta o música. Porque ya no es divertido estar contando el cielo en el en la oscuridad. Entonces puse una cinta y dentro de 5 minutos me duermo. Y quizás piense, hermano, se durmió escuchando una cinta. Bueno, estaba en casa, me puedo dormir en casa. El pecado es dormir dormirse en la iglesia escuchando una cinta cuando alguien está predicando. Cuando estamos aquí vemos todo. Los que están revisando su celular, los que están viendo el reloj, vemos todo y no podía dormir. Entonces puse una cinta, pero quería escuchar un mensaje específico y quería escuchar ese mensaje ese día en el calvario. Puse y puse mis audífonos. No quería levantar a mi esposa. Empecé a escuchar al hermano Branham y esta parte captó mi atención. Él dice, "¿Qué será cuando lleguemos al cielo?" ¿Ha pensado sobre eso? Piensa que alguien lo va a saludar ahí cuando llegue o que van a ver, "Oh, aquí viene hermano Castillo. Aquí viene Tomás. Hola, ¿cómo está? A veces nos vemos por algún lugar nosotros y nos queremos invitar uno al otro. Los he visto antes. Estoy hablando con la familia, nos invitamos uno al otro. Y él dice, "Me pregunto, ¿cómo será cuando lleguemos al cielo y nos encontremos allá? Parece gran tiempo eterno. ¿Sabe qué significa eterno? Es es para siempre. Llegué a 62 años de edad, pero 62 no es para siempre. Porque a veces lo siento que no es para siempre, pero he aprendido no ver al espejo, al que está en el espejo, pero he aprendido a mirar más allá que el espejo. Mar Castillo de 21 años de edad es muy opuesto, tiene cabello, es eterno, sin arrugas, está contento porque en esta vida no somos eterno, ¿qué será cuando llegamos allá? Qué mal que la hermana no nos pudo mandar una foto, un mensaje quizás una foto con mira con Moisés y yo. Wow. Y aquí está Josué. Mira, mamá y papá. Aquí está. Aquí está David. Había perdido su gozo, pero no había perdido su salvación. Y le manda una foto para recordarle. Es real cómo se sentiría. se levanta y tiene un texto de la suegra, pero ahora ya no es la suegra, ahora es la hermana Florinda, porque en el cielo, desafortunadamente ya no hay suegras, solo hijos y hijas redimidos por la preciosa sangre del cuero. Y podemos mirar más allá de la continuidad y ser recordados que vale la pena. Vale la pena. Siga hacia adelante, quizás estéreciendo, pero uno por uno. Los de antaño están yendo a casa. Se se han notado eso. Los que empezaron esta jornada, uno por uno se están yendo. La nueva generación se levantó. No fue la antigua generación que entró a la tierra prometida, fue la nueva generación que cruzó a la tierra prometida, pero tenían que pelear para llegar. Así como nosotros tenemos que pelear. Y para ser victorioso, la única manera es pararse en la palabra de Dios. Ahí dice, seremos a su semejanza. Cuando dice Pablo, ya no soy yo el que vive, es Cristo el que vive en mí. Cuando lleguemos ahí será Cristo en usted. Esa parte eterna de él estará en nosotros en aquel día. Que Dios nos ayude esta tarde para seguir hacia adelante y decir, "Gracias, Señor, que en mi vida pude conocer a la hermana Florinda, pude comer de su comida. Chile colorado. El chile colorado y tortillas. Yo pude comer eso, pude hablar con ella, pude reírme, pude sentarme en lugares celestiales aquí, pero un día voy a vivir con ella y para siempre. Que Dios nos ayude esta tarde, iglesia para seguir hacia adelante. Como recordatorio, esto no es el fin, es el principio. Dios nos ayude seguir adelante y pararnos en su palabra. Que Dios les dé consuelo cuando se sienta triste, pero también que les recuerde que el gozo viene en la mañana. de parte de la familia Sublaski, gracias por estar aquí, gracias por ser parte de su vida. Ore por la familia porque aún tenemos que llegar ahí nosotros. Ore uno por el otro porque aún tenemos que llegar nosotros. Y si no los vemos aquí, que un día los veamos en la mañana, el otro lado del río Jordán. [aplausos] Amen. Will, can we sing that song through it all key of D?

We're going to give just a couple of uh announcements at this time to conclude this evening service. De parte de la familia queremos darle gracias a los que pudieron venir. Si mi abuela pudiera ver todos los rostros que están aquí, espero que sí, de alguna forma. No sé cómo lo hace el Señor, pero yo sé que ella estaría contenta. Tengo que confesar. Tomé parte. algo de lo que me recordó mi padre. Me encantaba lavar los trastes cuando venía mi abuelita. Mi mi hermana odiaba eso porque siempre me me salía por nunca tener que lavar los trastes, pero sé cómo hacerlo. Mi otra abuela se aseguró que yo sabía cómo, que no me podía zafar de ella. Pero memorias muy preciosas. Muy agradecidos por la vida que ella vivió, como mi prima Betany mencionó un pedacito de de ella en cada uno de los de los hijos. Abuela vive a través de su familia. Estamos muy agradecidos con ello. Este año no quiero decir que es un año extraño, que yo sé que Dios sabe lo que él está haciendo, pero dos veces ya este año he visto a mis padres, los dos, ambos de mis padres, perder a sus padres solo aquí, no para siempre. Cuando pienso de mi abuela, mis abuelas, algo dentro de mí, entiendo dónde ellas están. Estoy 100% convencido que yo sé dónde ellas están. Tendremos nuestros momentos cuando lloremos. Vamos a derramar lágrimas. Pero debe de haber un gran gozo en saber dónde vamos a ver a nuestros amados, dónde ellos están. Recuerde, no la queremos perder, hay que no perderlo. Ver a mis padres, si puedo compartir esto por un momento, ver a mis padres perder a sus padres. me dio una nueva perspectiva. Ustedes jóvenes y cada uno que es joven de corazón, no tenga temor decirle a sus padres que los ama. Dígales ahora, no se espere hasta que esté en su lecho de muerte, hasta que haya remordimiento en su vida. Usamos la palabra amor demasiado. Amamos todo. Oh, amo a los Denver Broncos. Lakers. Amo a los Lakers. Amo las tortillas de mi abuela. Amo la comida, amamos todo. Pero cuando le dice a sus padres que los ama, lo deben sentir. Esa palabra no debe ser tan usada de de una forma tan mala, que cuando le dice alguien que lo ama, dice, "No, está bien, es algo es otra cosa que amas. Dígale a sus padres que los ama ahora y y con con significado. No, no se espere. Dios bendiga a la familia esta tarde. Vamos a concluir el servicio para dar unos recordatorios. No se les olvide que hay servicio mañana aquí en la mañana a las 10 de la mañana y el entierro va a ser directamente después y todos saben que es el día de mañana. Gracias a todos que hicieron el esfuerzo de estar aquí. Los apreciamos. Afortunadamente tenemos que encontrarnos en condiciones como tales, pero el apoyo de de la iglesia, amigos hermosos, familias heros, que Dios les bendiga por hacer el esfuerzo de estar aquí. Amén. Mientras se ponen de pie conmigo, [música] vamos a hacer una oración para despedir. Después de despedir, [música] queremos darle a los hermanos, hermanas la oportunidad. [música] Si quiere pasar por enfrente, saludar a la familia mientras sale, puede hacerlo. Si pueden seguir la confianza de de los diáconos, [música] por favor, t eso en mente. [música] Despedirle la parte de atrás hacia hacia enfrente rostros. para orar. Bondado el Señor. Señor, te damos gracias de nuevo.
