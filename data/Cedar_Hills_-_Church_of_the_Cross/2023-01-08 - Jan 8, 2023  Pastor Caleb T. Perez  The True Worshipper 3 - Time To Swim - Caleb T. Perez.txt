of the Lord and we so we want to jump into the word today we pray it is a blessing and a help to you uh the title that the true worshiper number three with a subtitle time to swim time to swim now now what did you say brother Jimmy the other day amen he said he said when you that we better put our goggles on because we're going to dive into the ocean of God's love [Music] amen so let's I'm gonna want to go swimming yeah no I may don't know how to swim maybe you don't know how to swim in the natural but we'll we'll help you in the spirit it's okay to do doggy paddle sometimes as long as you get until you get comfortable so let's get into the word and I I I I sure had a wonderful time with the young people last night and uh we we I was I was so impressed by how open they are and they're not ashamed they just yeah I mess up I messed up but I need help is we were glad that to be able to come together amen now as we enter into this the true worshiper let's go to the book of First The Book of John Juan the fourth chapter and the 23rd and the 24th verse we know this by heart cuatro entitles excuse me I hope my voice holds up to all right but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him the father he is seeking true worshipers that is the spirit the Bible says they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth and this is some people have the spirit and no truth and some people have the truth but no Spirit through worshipers worship the father in spirit and in truth may God add His blessings to the reign of his word you may be seated Worship in spirit in truth and we know that in Worship in spirit and in truth in is a place and brother Branham preaches the message God's only provided place of worship and then he preaches God's chosen place of worship keep that in mind as we're talking about the true worshiper is foreign everybody together amen now right after we read this is and John was told to take the little book from the hand of the Angel right and he was told to take it and to eat all of it right gotta eat it all eat The Complete Book the complete word but notice that the way the continuity of the scriptures are continues that right after he eats the little book right after he eats the word something is given to him now now I I want you to to put yourself in that in that scenario because as soon as we can eat the whole word there's something that is given to us let's find out then in the very next chapter and we've read this already but we want to we want to we want to keep going here yes the very next chapter Revelations 11 1 and here's he's writing and he says there was given me is me John is that right I can't agreement here it there was giving me he had just ate the book but now there was given me this is not just to a church member John is typing the bride quantity not yet not everybody receives this but he says there was given me and my brother Jerry brought this for me there was giving me a read like unto a road stood saying rise measure the temple and the Altar and them that worship therein yeah good morning all right we've got a measuring stick now we know this is this is a type of something now there are three things that are needed for true and perfect worship anybody want to help me out this morning three things true and perfect worship it's the things that need to be measured you need a temple neces you need an altar and you need a worshiper you have those three things man the worship that can come forth is amazing father is seeking he's taking those to worshipers those that have recognized the temple those that have recognized the altars they've recognized themselves as the worshipers as we get into this message let's take a hard look at our lives this morning and let's see how much we have really grown God wants growth yes or yes God wants us to produce fruit and not just fruit but more fruit and much fruit now let me see here brother brother Nate you know come here and help me would you would you come here and help me now now this is why when we all know this maybe in your homes you did it another way here here brother Nate and I'm sure maybe at your house do they measure you and how do they do it measuring tape no say so so if you don't have a measuring tape how do you do you kind of go up against the wall right and then uh and then you you kind of just put a little Mark on the wall so if you go down a little bit just now this was this was Nate maybe last year Pakistan there was a Mark that was put and then you come back today and we put a little Mark here check it out look at this this is where you are this is where you were last year did you grow you can see this let's do our yearly checkup and see if if uh if we have grown from last year how many of you if you remember where you were last year about this time think about it for a moment where were you about this time last year the questions we can we can that can come up is is uh do we speak the same way as we did last year uh do we still uh backbiting and gossiping and uh and cussing is we're in church I'm supposed to be asking these questions but we want to know if we have grown at all do we complement each other just try to pull each other down smear one another do we give God more thanks now than we did last year or do we still complain about everything come on have you grown at all in these areas do we read more pray more meditate more meditamos as our worship been expanded to other areas of our life do we see Christ when we look into the mirror do we react better to things or do we still fly off the handles do we find ourselves thinking more on the things of God or the things of the world do you think on how you can help others or is your focus just on yourself am I more available when God wants to use me I don't know let's back up to the wall church and let's see where we were from last year to this year and only you cannot answer the question have I grown any and on and on we can go but I give you these things just to to get you uh to get you to think about it's time that we measure ourselves it's measuring time today and the word is used to measure the worshiper I was thinking the other day I said could it be possible that God could use a Ministry Revival fires around the world foreign [Music] and the problem lies in the fact that people have a hard time leaving their everybody I'm going to say it again we have a hard time leaving our comfort zone we have become soft as church goers we become soft hello are you still with me this morning maybe you don't like what I'm preaching but that's okay we don't get more than what we have we we don't get more than what we have because we have become too comfortable the fire is only comfortable when you're seeing it from a distance and you're being warped by that fire but the day you get into the fire and the Fire gets into you is the day that you are no longer comfortable because there's a purpose why fire comes Revival fires are for that purpose what is the fire what does it do okay it annihilates it kills it destroys and that's what people don't want is because it makes you uncomfortable we talk about the Holy Ghost but we want the fire at a distance the Holy Ghost didn't come to be at a distance from here came to dwell inside of your heart but I heard every unclean thing then why are we so comfortable nowadays fire makes way for a new creation I'm going to say it again church fire makes way for a new creation fire that was re that was started there in Uganda not just for the ugandans the fire is for you that are foreign the only man of William you're not in all the way maybe your leg is sticking out she says maybe your arm or your head is sticking out what time this morning that we get all the way in what's the Lord telling us this morning get out of your comfort zone oh man we're in our Tempur-Pedic beds and the Lord says Ah come and pray come and talk to me a little while wow we're too comfortable hello everybody get out of our comfort zone if you're comfortable with our featherbedness we're too comfortable with our little groups that we hang out with foreign Hallelujah yeah yeah the hunters hang out with the hunters it's our comfort zone but the Lord is stirring the nest telling us get out of your comfort zone with having your friends and who you like to hang out with we all we all have friends but when that becomes the very purpose of Our Lives let's get out of our comfort zone this year if you want to join me or we can't even pray 30 minutes on our knees let me see anybody here you get on your knees and you and you think is 15 minutes into our prayer oh oh and then we get up after 30 minutes what's going on we're out of conditions get a little calluses on our knees and then we'll be able to get in conditions five ten minutes into our into the message we're listening [Music] we get so sleepy we're not in conditions we're too comfortable well I can't go to Services children are crying and they don't feel good they're fussy our parents didn't ask us if we wanted to go to church did your father say are you feeling good today let's go to church no no sorry we're going to church that's what we do in our homes serving the lord is the center of our Lives we grew up that way we didn't grow up comfortable we were poor as can be we seem to have nothing but we had a passion to serve them passion to help people that was the center of our lives but not no more comfortable today no bring them I don't know why the passion in your children you know what it means to serve God all the time no we are so soft oh my goodness Lord help us that's how our fire stayed lit I said How's your fire this morning let's see how your passion is for the things of God so I'm challenging myself as much as I'm challenging you this year let's do something for the Lord that we have never done before anybody got any tasters this morning it's time that we shock our system all right and choke how many of you ever get in the shower and man it's so comfortable you get there in the shower oh man you just you just want to stay there you want to stay there in the shower you don't want to get out then somebody in your family says you're wasting water leave me alone but how many of you right before you get out do you turn it full cold Turn It full black little shock your system oh my God that's what we need to do this year we need to shock our system a little bit let's do something that'll take us out of our comfort zone let us worship like we have never worshiped if you're used to getting up late get up a little earlier [Applause] seek the Lord see if you don't start hearing from God I'm not talking about doing something one time going back to our old selves our old habits talking about a new creation being formed inside of us a new creation that's coming forth I'm talking about a new creation being formed in us this body can't handle it no more sooner or later this body is gonna have to release it any takers shock us to our core just about dying just to die we're talking about dying to live because if the old creation the old nature doesn't die that is always your default settings and that's the one that always says well I'm only human when maybe you should find your Eternal part you don't have to always say I'm only human understanding amen I'll stop that's enough today so that's enough today we'll go a new creature in Christ Jesus Christ says I don't know that old man anymore old man is crucified with Christopher these things are not just as a repackaged Caleb or whoever your name whatever your name is no that guy will always pop his head up we want to enter this new year as a new creation all right then let's let's take this you want to shout in church shout character systems we're gonna shock our system or not you feel like running why don't you run I'm embarrassed the fire never gets embarrassed Let the Fire do what it's supposed to and it don't get embarrassed hello everybody you want to shout shout you want to cry cry but it's all about getting out of our comfort zone the heroes of the faith they didn't have it comfortable no son or daughter of God have it comfortable they were fed to the Lions the Bible says they were tortured foreign the world was not deserving of such people they were the people whom the world could never measure such a character how do you measure that how do you measure someone that has given their all to the Lord no matter what they go through raise their hands and say blessed be the name of the Lord have a measuring sticks all they can do is call you weird they're weird the world was not worthy but because they got out of their Comforts the Bible says they subdued kingdoms [Applause] the raising of our deaths Hallelujah get excited here we're so soft when we don't get what we want God doesn't love me no more yeah we become weak in our mind and in our spirit to Worship the Lord in spirit and Truth people don't even know what being in the spirit is anymore they don't even know what truth is what has to happen we Must Die daily let there be a change of Hearts a change of Desire once again Revelations 11 1 says there was given me a read like this measure the temple and measure the altar measure the worship foreign measure the temple measure the altar measure the worshipers watch this now there was a story that brother Morton told me thank you for that brother Morton he said a certain politician from Norway Politico de Norway had come to the United States and was invited to a presidential breakfast with then it was President Clinton during the time that he was being impeached and everyone in the room was told as the president entered would you all stand as the president comes in he said that there was a certain woman that was there yeah she said I will not stand I'm ashamed of this President as the president entered everyone stood except for that woman he said that Billy Graham got up Billy Graham he was asked to pray and he began his prayer like this Lord senor we are all sinners afterwards the woman that didn't stand sir this is still ashamed of the president but now I'm more ashamed of myself because we forget at many times foreign [Music] she hadn't grown like she had thought she had no idea maybe that's what we should do when someone starts talking about someone else nobody should get out of their comfort zone Lord we are all sinners oh that would put everything back in check right away because you all know you are talking about one or the other shame I have to even talk about these things but you all know many times you leave the conversation it's like I should have said I should have stood up and um because they probably won't invite you into their little group well there there they put out the fire they put out the party no because you don't like what is being told we don't fit in the groups come on yeah You're Gonna Love Me Or Hate Me when it's all said the true worshiper time to grow up in Christ brother I have so many issues yeah she will no matter if it's your health or finances or Spirits we all deal with issues we go through rough times and we say brother I feel like my back's up against the wallsendo what's the problem is it problema uh I I I don't understand your backs up against the walls how he measures he measures You by how you handle the situation but if we still handle it the same way we're still we're here we didn't grow no Christmas so God sends another test and we handle it the same way oh let's see how we started the year people say oh it's been a bad year already yeah your back's up against the wall the Lord spoke and says it's going to be a rough one when the hardships we can go on a big old list of what is going on right now in the church right but in the midst of it all I see a perfect worship coming oh look church if I could just if I I tell you what I what the Lord is doing and what he's showing is so amazing I see a people still worshiping God I see people that are that are going through a hardship right now and still in the middle of it all they're shaking themselves they've been shook to the course brother in the midst of this feel that peace in the midst of it [Applause] shut up I hear others say nevertheless not my will but thine be done perfect worship I heard something the other day that made me cry it hit me so it just hit me just right you know usually if you get in an accident anybody ever been in an accident you ever go by the place where you had the accident that's rough you see those times in or the place and you and it just you cringe but I heard something the other day that got me a few months ago my wife was in an accident and the other day Abby was giving me a ride to pick up my vehicle and Hadley was with us and as we passed the intersection where they had had the accident I just heard adley from the back seat that's the place that Jesus protected me Jesus [Music] [Applause] and when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did and the children crying in the temple and saying Hosanna to the son of David they were so displeased I'm just going to read it in English to save time you then Spanish can read verse 16. and said unto him here is thou what these say and Jesus saith unto them yea have you never read that out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou has perfected praise church when the real true worship is being given to God it's the religious people are so displaced this this think they're better than everyone else why because they can give praise to God in the middle of adversity because they can give praise to God when their backs up against the walls all satan is trying to do is steal the worship oh I've had a wonderful day you might as well say praise the devil see this is feeling good today hello everybody I'm talking about true worshipers oh I'm having a rough time oh but when we can say this is the day it's the time things could have gone way out of hand but he protected it's hard to do is it's not an easy thing let's not go fast you don't do it from your mouth because from your mouth you say sometimes why Lords of your heart depths of a True Believer that is Blessed Be Your holy name out of the mouth of babes thou has perfected the praise the problem then comes to this is that we use certain measuring stick for ourselves we use a different measuring stick for our children okay here's here's here's here's the dad in the family ah blankety blank blank blank then goes to his children and say don't talk like that okay you serious one measuring stick for you it's okay to do it we use a different measuring stick for the people in the church we use a different measuring stick for the world and after a while we have a lot of measuring sticks we measure everyone in the church by what we think but sometimes we don't even have a right measuring stick so we measure someone by what somebody else says there's a lot of measuring sticks we measure by the culture and Society we live in we measure by our family upbringings foreign having a lot of measuring sticks Abomination to God we're using so many different sticks believe me I got to preach this to myself first this is the biggest problem that people have is they're worried what everybody else is saying and thinks about them they're worried about every measuring stick go to the scripture real quick and let's find out the Bible says about having a lot of measuring sticks Deuteronomy 25 14 through 16. this is a commandment s shall not have in thine house divers measures a great small Thou shalt not have in your house divers measures no no no maybe I'll use this one we use a smaller measuring stick oh we feel like giants huh yes or yes you use a small measuring stick and then for everybody else yeah yeah yeah I knew it this is hello everybody hello hola todos Thou shalt not have in thine house diver's measures if you're going to measure the temple if you're going to measure the altar if you're going to measure the worshiper a measuring stick must be used but Thou shalt have verse 15. but Thou shalt have a perfect have that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the Lord thy God giveth him for all that do such things and all that do unrighteously are an Abomination unto the Lord's weights both of them are like Abominations I've got a lot of money in the bank now I got a nice house nice car God is really blessing me wrong measuring stickers you don't measure how much you're blessed by how much you have I went to church and woo I gotta tingle down my spine I got it now wrong measuring sticks hello everybody hola todos you don't come to my church you're going to hell no yes wrong measuring sticks if you don't dress and act like me wrong wrong using the wrong measuring sticks it's time to throw out all the measuring sticks of our house and use one measuring stick that is the word of God it is the message of the hours you want to see if you've grown or not oh God at his word message that has been brought to us say foreign listen to this Ephesians 4 13. till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature fullness of Christ brother Branham says in the message perseverance do you believe that the church is shaping into conditions Luther had a wide broad way it's hot up here Luther had a wide broad way just accept Christ I said Crystal just shall live by faith too tall let me see what I can see Luther had a measuring there we go there we go hey start let's go on this side so everybody can see Luther had oh see hey hello there okay we're back on you didn't like that one uh okay that's okay we're gonna we're gonna sit Luther had a measuring the just shall live and those that stayed with that as far as they got hasta you know but if the lutherans would have kept going the measuring stick was was raisedia oh we're getting to something here if he would if they would have kept going they would have got to the where the Pentecostals were understands oh yeah see and if the Pentecostals would have kept going they would have come to the message of the hours which is the ultimate the ultimate measuring steps we're going to get to something here now watch what he says come more in the minority then on down it talks about the the the methodism and the Pentecostals he said but you see it was God's program the Holy Spirit hones it into that condition now watch he says now to the life in the body is a Vindication of the Rapture that the Rapture is at hand when you see the headship and the body becoming one okay in the fullness of the measure of his manifestations that shows that the body is about ready to be received to the headshots now I'm going to turn a corner now about 15 minutes is that okay because we're going to get something good right now here we go let's then turn to Ezekiel oh Uncle Juan loves Ezekiel 47. afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house and behold Waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastwards for the Forefront of the house stood toward the east and the waters came down from under the right side of the house at the south side of the altar is I'm gonna go to verse three and when the man that had the line in his hand we could stay there for a long time but the man that had the line in his hands he had the measuring stick immense oh I like that he went forth Eastward yes didn't he go Eastward to preach the seals what was he doing taking the line this is something good coming up and he measured a thousand cubits imidio and he brought me through the waters the waters were to the ankles got that okay he's taking him the man with a line he's taking us the just shall live by faith that's where it started the bride should be on to grow again the people stepped into the waters they were Justified they were happy there yes praise God I gave my heart to the Lord justification this is good yes how many like when you go someplace and you go to the ocean and you just put your feet in the water oh this is nice and then all of a sudden the problem happens we get comfortable there they say watch what he says piggy say look at this day and then he measured a thousand and brought me through the waters the waters were to the knees again he measured a thousand and brought me through the waters they were to the loins and afterwards he measured a thousand and it was a river yeah that I could not pass over for the waters were risen Waters to swim a river that could not be passed how deep was that River doesn't tell us how deep this is the Crux of the message now tell us how deep no no this is because how deep is the dependent on you and me watch why I say this this man with the line in his hands is measuring distance he's taking us from here to there it's an exodus from here to there that's what the message has done it is it is stretching the lines you know how to follow now just just so you have this information he's going in increments of a thousand cubits and in today's measurements that would be about 1500 feet but in biblical terms a mile was 2 000 cubits this is biblical now it was 2 000 cubits so if he took them he took Ezekiel one thousand one thousand one thousand million one thousand million that's four thousand cubits how much would that be in the Bible terms two miles that's absolutely but notice here now in efficiency in the Bible under thumbs up there was a limit how far you could go on the Sabbath and you could only go 2 000 cubits you could only go one mile yeah think about this now think about how tremendous this is but the Bible says in Matthew 5 41. let's do this now Matthew 5 41. whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile two thousand cubits go with him Twain back Hallelujah go with him the two miles because in the two miles foreign Atlanta don't be happy because you've made a few a mile or so we're called to go all the way we're not called just to live justification or to go to the knees and sanctification we are called to go all the way a river that cannot be measured a river that we can swim you got to take off the floaties now we have been dallying about little here and there but it's time to jump in now but my feet I can't feel the bottom because you're swimming now whoa walk by faith or defense and not by side in Upper Vista walk by faith and not by feelings watch this now he can say this I was looking at this and I said wow wow I see the four stages the three stages of Grace which actually there's a fourth one that's the fourth four thousand cubits now notice this now Waters were to the ankles with Luther the knees with Wesley yes but now it's become a river that's unpassable no one can pass over it unless you're called to do it a people that have been chosen because now it is not a portion of the word now it is the word in its fullness but in the days of the voice of the seven things he shall begin to sound the mystery should be over finished now it grows from the feet modern events made clear by prophecy it grows went all the way up to the thighs but now it's in the hair fixing to go this is manifesting manifestado in full in full measure the Bride As the groom this great river that will be flowing from the temple isn't just something that's coming it's something that's here yeah come on church I'm I'm turning the corner here something that is here when I see this watch the compoundness of scripture oh brother that that Ezekiel 47 is talking about the Millennium and so forth let me tell you what the prophet said Ezekiel 47 yes he says this is am I talking to anybody here and the wheat bread is broken off by Ezekiel 4. Hallelujah I'm gonna say it again the power spoken of by Ezekiel 47 that's the Holy Ghost When I See This I see I I praise the Lord because these Waters that issued out foreign and there shall be be a great multitude of fish because these Waters shall come hither they shall be healed and everything shall live whether wither the river cometh that's the reason we long to come together church when we come on the body Together We come as a group of Believers sometimes we come in the door around we feel like being here we all get tired I get it that's all we understand or see we're missing out what a true worshiper is perfect the Bible says not forsaking the assembling of ourselves Gathering Place why is it so important because our worship is so much greater when we come as a body of Believers in the last day this is John 7. in the last day the great day of peace Jesus stood in Christ Jesus any man thirst is let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly the word belly is the Matrix the womb out of their womb shall flow rivers of Living Waters where's the water coming from so this is people year after year oh I barely made it to church oh my gosh by Tuesday I'm bone dry while Martin second hello everybody Oh by Wednesday hum to forget it I'm just dragging I need to recharge you don't have the fountain in you because I don't need to come so that it fills me the fountain is from within um when you receive the holy ghost from The Fountains then you're not looking everywhere to get filled oh it flows from within a river unreal it cannot be measured what is it it's the true worshiper oh church I hope that you get this and I'm finishing now get this now brother will would you come to the piano or I will not stop because I got a lot still but just come anyways let me tell you something Fountain gotta be flowing inside of you be inside already this is why I'm telling you this and I'm going to prove it by the scriptures when the prophet came when the prophet gave us the message he gave us a message and that message measured the distance how far we've got to walk we have to walk and he did a thousand cubits and he's inviting but don't stay there measured another thousand immediately once again the man with the line measure distance as your distance come on now we measure the distance but it's up to you and I better stand to me how deep we want to go into that River because that when it's all said and done together as a body we can measure the depth of that River you say brother can you prove it by the scriptures Ephesians 3 17 and I'm closing with this that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith foreign [Music] all right when I look back there and I see brother Jerry and sister Faith I start to see depth and peace come on Church when I look at brother Mandola Mandola and they say you got cancer again you know what he said God already healed me from prostate cancer God already healed me from a heart attack and he's more than able to heal me again why do I see I see death I see the measurement of the words what a measurement is going on oh we'll say though you slay me I'll Trust you wait until you get in that position if you still say the same thing yeah measure yourself we come together to see what God has done for him brought him from and her from him from him don't say that and I see the scripture being fulfilled we may be able to comprehend with all the saints what's the breath and the length and the depth and the heights know the love of Christ passive knowledge with all the fullness of God brother Branham says this is I don't care I mean I mean lutherans are fine Baptists are fine all these things all right but let's put it right down every word of God is true God said it's perfect whatsoever things you desire I believe that's the truth says let me lay my measuring stick down on my soul and spread it across God's word thank God it's the truth is and you'll
