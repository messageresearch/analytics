[29:16] hand and when I would go to
[29:19] school I'm
[29:24] right-handed I was trying to learn how
[29:26] to write with my left
[29:30] class I would hide my right hand under
[29:32] my
[29:35] desk when I go to
[29:39] lunch I would also hide my right hand
[29:41] under the
[29:44] table I taught myself how to eat my left
[29:50] hand and I remember one day getting home
[29:52] from school or or one
[29:56] morning
[29:58] talking to my mother she was a woman of
[30:03] faith and I had constantly for months
[30:05] been telling her mom take me to the
[30:09] doctor so they can burn them off or cut
[30:11] them
[30:13] off she was over there turning the pot
[30:15] she was always cooking for 19
[30:18] people and and she stopped for a
[30:22] second and she looked at
[30:24] me and she
[30:26] said go into your
[30:28] room get on your
[30:30] knees pray to
[30:32] God and he's going to take them
[30:36] off they're not
[30:39] here I never had to go to the
[30:42] doctor I went to the doctor of doctors

[42:32] Eden amen let's if you can be so kind

[42:39] chapter and this is the scripture we are
[42:43] using in this
[42:47] series you have it you can say
[42:52] Amen verse 41 2241 it reads like this
[42:56] while the Pharisees were gathered
[42:57] together Jesus asked
[43:02] them saying what think ye of
[43:08] Christ one more scripture before we sit
[43:10] down second First Corinthians the 2
[43:15] chapter and the 16th
[43:18] verse have it you can say

[43:39] it all right for who hath known the mind
[43:43] of the
[43:45] Lord that he may instruct
[43:48] him but we have the mind of
[43:53] Christ am I talking to anyone here today
[43:57] said but we have the mind of
[44:00] Christ can can you repeat that with me
[44:03] but we have the mind of Christ tell your
[44:06] neighbor neighbor we have the mind of
[44:09] Christ very important to understand this
[44:12] this morning we have the mind of
[44:15] Christ if we don't have it well it's
[44:17] time to get it
[44:19] right amen God may God add His blessings
[44:22] to the reading of his word you may be
[44:25] seated
[44:27] without the mind of
[44:29] Christ we will never answer the
[44:34] question what think ye of Christ we can
[44:38] give
[44:39] answers but we'll never answer the
[44:41] question within
[44:44] ourselves what we think of
[44:47] Christ the little scripture as we have
[44:50] we had had uh had uh
[44:53] quoted the other day
[44:57] this little scripture tonight it says
[44:59] holds a decision for
[45:04] people what think ye of
[45:07] Christ and then he says your decision on
[45:10] what that scripture
[45:14] asked that question will seal your
[45:17] Eternal
[45:21] destination in other words if we don't
[45:24] answer that question
[45:28] not beat around the bush let's just say
[45:31] it like it
[45:32] is without answering it we ain't G to
[45:35] make
[45:38] it yeah amen I think some of you are
[45:41] still have as
[45:43] sleep all right make sure you get awake
[45:49] okay
[45:52] neighbor
[45:54] nebor
[45:56] good to see you
[45:58] neighbor the battle today is hot and
[46:03] heavy and the crisis is
[46:07] everywhere you would have to be blind
[46:09] not to see the
[46:12] crisis in every
[46:16] aspect every place you
[46:20] look I don't care if it is
[46:24] politics I don't care if it's
[46:27] doesn't matter if it is Family
[46:29] Life there is a crisis going on
[46:34] everywhere there is not one thing or one
[46:37] place where there is not a crisis going
[46:41] on can I get a witness
[46:44] today there's a crisis
[46:46] everywhere you look at people people are
[46:49] in
[46:51] crisis don't know how to deal with
[46:53] things that they that they're going
[46:55] through
[46:57] and as you see these things and they
[47:00] they they are not approaching they have
[47:01] approached
[47:05] already and our understanding of the
[47:09] word is always dependent on the on the
[47:13] mind that we
[47:15] have we can answer a lot of
[47:19] questions but the question is are we
[47:21] using the mind of Christ or are we using
[47:23] our own
[47:24] mind
[47:27] that mind will determine how we handle
[47:30] the pressures of the crisis we are going
[47:35] through if you don't have the right
[47:37] mentality the right frame of mind the
[47:40] right
[47:42] mind you cannot handle the pressures of
[47:44] the crisis that are going on in the
[47:47] world you go
[47:49] crazy more you you turn the TV on and
[47:52] you look at the news the the worse it is
[47:56] and we ask the question is how much
[47:58] worse can it
[48:00] get I remember asking these questions 20
[48:04] 30 years
[48:06] ago we were like it can't get any
[48:10] worse and boy have I been
[48:15] wrong crisis
[48:17] everywhere everywhere we turn the
[48:20] headlines are
[48:22] crisis the world in crisis
[48:26] the nations in
[48:28] crisis the church in
[48:30] crisis the family unit in
[48:33] crisis marriages in
[48:37] crisis the individual in
[48:40] crisis and if there ever was a crisis it
[48:43] is
[48:45] now and you would think that we would we
[48:47] would run to the
[48:49] word you think that people would run to
[48:54] Christ but instead yeah they they they
[48:56] have gotten into this into this
[48:59] realm and they think they're
[49:02] okay but as the pressure continues to
[49:05] come upon
[49:08] us it gets harder and harder even to
[49:11] maintain your
[49:14] thoughts brother bradam says in the
[49:16] message the second coming of the
[49:19] Lord now notice then just before
[49:24] that he prophesied here and
[49:27] said the walls of Jerusalem will be Trot
[49:31] down by the
[49:34] Gentiles until the Gentile dispensation
[49:37] would be
[49:40] finished the muhammadans have took it
[49:44] over we realize that and I want you to
[49:48] look at the crisis tonight he
[49:51] says how Ishmael and Isaac are still at
[49:55] his each other's
[49:58] neck right at Jerusalem where it's
[50:01] predicted they would
[50:05] be that was
[50:08] 1957 now
[50:11] 2023 Isaac and ishma are still at each
[50:14] other's
[50:16] neck when we when we see this
[50:20] crisis I want to go to another another
[50:23] another message that he speaks of God
[50:26] keeps his
[50:28] word and how timely it
[50:31] is and he says our thought this
[50:36] afternoon is dealing with
[50:39] Israel in a time
[50:41] of and then he says such as the church
[50:45] is going through
[50:48] today all things come to a place of
[50:53] Crisis before it hit hit the
[50:56] climax diseases usually go through the
[51:01] crisis and after the crisis then you may
[51:04] get
[51:06] well it turn one way or the
[51:10] other you'll either die or you'll get
[51:14] well but when we see these
[51:17] crisis we see what Israel where they're
[51:21] at we cannot lose sight of what the
[51:23] prophet of God said
[51:27] that Israel and the church they
[51:30] parallel they have not stopped
[51:34] paralleling this morning they have not
[51:36] stopped
[51:38] paralleling Israel and the church
[51:40] continue to parallel each
[51:43] other in seeing this when you see Israel
[51:47] at
[51:48] War then you see a church at War
[51:52] also yes yes when you see a crisis in
[51:56] Israel you see a crisis in the
[51:59] church and we don't ever want to talk
[52:01] about those
[52:02] things we want to act like everything is
[52:06] okay but we have to face the
[52:09] crisis we have to be ready and we have
[52:13] to have the right
[52:15] mind in order to deal with the crisis
[52:19] correct the word
[52:22] crisis was created to describe
[52:27] things that we cannot
[52:30] understand or things that are out of our
[52:34] control whenever things are out of our
[52:36] control oh I'm in a
[52:39] crisis what is the person person
[52:42] saying I have no control over this no
[52:46] more we go to the
[52:48] doctor we wait for the
[52:51] results and it's sometimes things out of
[52:53] our control
[52:57] but when you when you let's define the
[52:59] word crisis
[53:01] now it says it's a time of intense
[53:08] difficulty it is trouble or
[53:12] danger it's a time when a difficult or
[53:16] important decision must be
[53:20] made a crisis is therefore the
[53:24] moment
[53:26] when a situation will either turn for
[53:28] the better or for the
[53:31] worse now once
[53:33] again homes are in
[53:37] crisis because they can turn for the
[53:39] better or for the worse at any
[53:43] time people are in
[53:45] crisis because they can turn from better
[53:48] or worse at any
[53:50] time you don't know who's going to lose
[53:53] it at any
[53:54] time
[53:55] you'll see somebody oh this very they're
[53:57] very nice
[53:59] people and the next thing you know it
[54:01] they
[54:02] turn what happened crisis
[54:05] happened now notice this now it comes
[54:08] from the Greek
[54:11] wordis and it means something of a
[54:14] decisive
[54:17] moment because when you're in a crisis
[54:19] it's it's a moment of
[54:24] decision
[54:25] am I going to seek what the will of God
[54:28] is am I going to seek what the purpose
[54:31] is for me going through
[54:34] this or am I just gonna say why is this
[54:37] happening to
[54:39] me it's sad to say but we as humans are
[54:43] programmed
[54:46] already to automatically say when we're
[54:49] in
[54:51] crisis Lord
[54:53] why Lord
[54:55] Jesus why are you punishing
[54:58] me and they don't
[55:01] realize that God has sent the
[55:04] crisis because in the crisis is where
[55:07] you're going to find
[55:10] Christ are you with me I'm I'm going to
[55:14] say it again we are pre-programmed
[55:18] already I don't understand why you're
[55:20] punishing me
[55:22] Lord you need to put on a different
[55:26] mind because under our carnal mind we'll
[55:29] never understand the
[55:33] purpose but under or with the mind of
[55:37] Christ we'll begin to answer the
[55:41] question what think ye of
[55:44] Christ because when you answer the
[55:46] question why you think of
[55:49] Christ it'll answer the question of what
[55:52] you think of
[55:54] yourself
[55:56] the Bride In Christ is not two different
[56:01] entities in all reality crisis is the
[56:05] moment of
[56:07] decision and it's how we view the
[56:11] situation and our decision of how to
[56:14] proceed from that
[56:18] point you see you see we look at it
[56:21] crisis always as a
[56:23] negative
[56:25] but did you know
[56:27] that the Japanese
[56:30] language they have no word for
[56:35] chrisis they didn't make a word for
[56:38] Christ why because they don't teach that
[56:40] to their
[56:44] people are you with
[56:46] me but the word that's closest to them
[56:49] that they use for
[56:53] crisis they use the word
[56:59] opportunity what a what a different
[57:05] mindset not the word crisis as
[57:10] negative but when something happens it's
[57:12] it's it's an
[57:16] opportunity now can we can we this
[57:18] morning permit that the that the Lord
[57:20] would would help us change our
[57:23] mentality
[57:25] how many want to make sure that we have
[57:26] the mind of Christ
[57:29] on we never understand the the
[57:33] message we can't understand the
[57:36] scriptures without having the mind of
[57:39] Christ once again the scripture says we
[57:42] have the mind of
[57:45] Christ Christ is Crisis comes in many
[57:50] forms the death of a loved
[57:52] one I know I'm speaking to to to to
[57:55] everyone
[57:57] here failed
[57:59] Health losing a job or a
[58:04] business drug addiction on and on you go
[58:07] you can go just fill in the
[58:10] blanks and it not only affects the
[58:12] person involved that's directly
[58:16] involved but it it affects everyone that
[58:19] is around that
[58:22] person everyone that's connect
[58:26] you get somebody that that that that
[58:27] that's into drug that has maybe drug
[58:29] abuse or alcohol or whatever it
[58:33] is the family around is the one that
[58:36] that takes the load takes the
[58:40] hit what do people
[58:42] do they need
[58:44] relief and the only relief that they
[58:47] have if you don't turn to
[58:50] Christ is alcohol drugs and porography
[58:56] everything else you want to fill in the
[58:58] blank all these things are just a
[59:01] temporary
[59:04] fix because we can't see any further
[59:08] than the
[59:10] crisis we get so caught up with the
[59:13] crisis that we can't see Christ in it
[59:17] all finding Christ in the
[59:21] crisis Paul had a different
[59:23] mentality Paul said all things work
[59:27] together for
[59:30] good now this is different now this is a
[59:33] different mind
[59:35] frame all things work together for
[59:39] good to them that are the
[59:43] called according to his
[59:47] purpose now we're going to get
[59:50] somewhere we love to quote
[59:53] scriptures about
[59:56] blessings
[59:57] amen we love scriptures that say oh you
[1:00:02] are worth so
[1:00:07] much God forne
[1:00:09] you you are you are now a Son of
[1:00:14] God you're a daughter of God oh we love
[1:00:17] those
[1:00:19] scriptures but why don't we take a hold
[1:00:21] of scriptures like in the world you
[1:00:24] shall have
[1:00:29] tribulation hello everybody what do we
[1:00:32] do with those
[1:00:34] scriptures amen I believe that and we
[1:00:37] but we don't want to read it all the
[1:00:39] time right imagine every morning we'd
[1:00:41] wake up and say in the world you will
[1:00:43] have
[1:00:46] tribulation you know what that would
[1:00:48] help us
[1:00:49] do change our
[1:00:52] mindset but not just change the mindset
[1:00:54] but change the
[1:00:56] mind in this world we will have
[1:01:00] tribulation in this world we will have
[1:01:04] crisis and we can't get away from
[1:01:07] that but then he goes on and says but be
[1:01:09] of good
[1:01:11] cheer for I have all overcome the
[1:01:15] world come on church we will have
[1:01:20] tribulation he already overcame the
[1:01:23] world
[1:01:24] we really think that because we are
[1:01:28] believers and we follow this great
[1:01:31] message we actually think that we're
[1:01:33] immune to
[1:01:36] crisis that we're immune to
[1:01:40] tribulations let's deprogram
[1:01:45] that I'm going to say it again we're
[1:01:48] he's reprogramming us this
[1:01:50] morning we're here for a
[1:01:52] purpose we're not here just to hear a
[1:01:55] good message and say good job
[1:01:58] Pastor I don't care about
[1:02:01] that though I appreciate it when you say
[1:02:04] it but we're after
[1:02:06] something changing of a mind this
[1:02:09] morning God wants to do something so
[1:02:12] great with
[1:02:14] us he cannot do it when we have our own
[1:02:18] mind we got to put on the mind of Christ
[1:02:22] now now let me see your hands if you're
[1:02:24] with me
[1:02:25] today you want to change the mindset you
[1:02:29] want to change the
[1:02:30] mind okay then don't think like that no
[1:02:33] more nothing can happen to me because
[1:02:35] I'm a

[1:02:48] life be ready for
[1:02:50] crisis be a good cheer though for I
[1:02:54] already overcame the
[1:02:56] world now notice this as we as we get
[1:02:59] into this
[1:03:03] subject you will have
[1:03:06] crisis for it's through the
[1:03:10] crisis that our character is
[1:03:14] formed and our faith is
[1:03:19] perfected it will not come any other
[1:03:22] way we're all always trying to find the
[1:03:25] easy
[1:03:29] route yes or yes we're always trying to
[1:03:32] find the easy way around
[1:03:34] things but only through the
[1:03:38] crisis is our character
[1:03:41] formed because it's through the
[1:03:44] crisis that we fight the good
[1:03:49] fight what have we ever
[1:03:52] learned when time times are
[1:04:00] good help me this

[1:04:43] soul there got to be something that is
[1:04:47] anchored this guy will go back and
[1:04:50] forth this guy can question everything

[1:04:59] word I cannot question
[1:05:02] God I can just say Lord give me strength
[1:05:05] to go through this
[1:05:07] crisis be of good share brother Bram

[1:05:25] Crisis and then brother Bram says he
[1:05:27] will not only
[1:05:30] answer but he will make
[1:05:33] manifest in the time of
[1:05:37] Crisis if uhoh he will make
[1:05:41] manifest in the time of
[1:05:44] Crisis if the people assemble
[1:05:50] together where are we going to assemble
[1:05:53] together in church
[1:05:55] here we can be sitting in the same
[1:05:58] church and it's a church to some it's a
[1:06:01] lodge to someone
[1:06:05] else did I say that out
[1:06:09] loud watch this now if the people
[1:06:12] assemble together and there is a meeting
[1:06:16] place where we assemble together and
[1:06:20] that meeting place is in
[1:06:23] Christ let's follow this for a
[1:06:25] moment manifestation in the time of
[1:06:29] Crisis then everything that needs to be
[1:06:33] manifest can only be manifested in a
[1:06:36] time of
[1:06:39] Crisis yes or yes you're looking at me
[1:06:42] like you don't know what I'm talking
[1:06:46] about watch watch our carnal man gets in
[1:06:49] the
[1:06:52] way oh no I don't want to go through
[1:06:54] through those things you don't want to
[1:06:55] be a
[1:06:59] Christian some of you looking at me
[1:07:02] like man this is what I signed up
[1:07:06] for you need the mind of
[1:07:09] Christ those Martyrs that gave their
[1:07:13] life it was an honor to give their
[1:07:17] life are you with me it was an honor to
[1:07:20] do things for the
[1:07:22] Lord
[1:07:26] suffer whom the world was not
[1:07:30] worthy how many of you are in the middle
[1:07:32] of a
[1:07:43] crisis I thought we weren't going to
[1:07:45] play
[1:07:47] Church we're playing
[1:07:49] church I already told you if Israel
[1:07:53] parallel
[1:07:56] and Israel is in
[1:07:59] crisis church is in
[1:08:01] crisis and if you don't think you're in
[1:08:03] a crisis right
[1:08:05] now you are lying to
[1:08:09] yourself
[1:08:11] right you want me to be honest with you
[1:08:13] or you want me to be one of those one of
[1:08:15] those preachers that just put the sugar
[1:08:17] on it and
[1:08:19] just let me see how many how many here
[1:08:22] are truthful are in
[1:08:25] crisis I I have to raise both of my
[1:08:28] hands I'm in a constant crisis all the
[1:08:36] time it's okay you don't have to ask to
[1:08:38] me to
[1:08:41] God turning a blind eye towards
[1:08:45] it and the enem is telling you no you're
[1:08:47] not in the
[1:08:48] crisis everything is fine you don't
[1:08:52] understand what crisis
[1:08:56] okay we're going to play church or we're
[1:08:58] going to be
[1:08:59] serious not to not for the Cale but but
[1:09:02] but
[1:09:05] toist the key is not whether we will
[1:09:08] have
[1:09:11] crisis but what are we built

[1:10:00] battle brother brand I'm in the message
[1:10:03] adoption I feel that you want me to do
[1:10:06] it this
[1:10:08] way to the Lord that it's your Divine
[1:10:12] will it's in your

[1:10:34] prayer oh you have trained us so long
[1:10:39] Lord come on now we've all been through
[1:10:42] crisis I don't care who it is we have
[1:10:45] been through many
[1:10:47] crisis you have trained us so long
[1:10:51] Lord chis after
[1:10:54] crisis but now father give us our
[1:10:58] ranks put us out there to what we're
[1:11:01] supposed to
[1:11:04] do so that we can be about our father's
[1:11:08] business do you see the purpose of a
[1:11:12] crisis it's God sending the
[1:11:16] crisis telling you it's
[1:11:20] me oh come on Church
[1:11:24] he's sending the crisis to say it's
[1:11:28] me is there such a thing as a crisis for
[1:11:39] God exactly it depends on what mind you
[1:11:42] have
[1:11:43] on listen listen closely to this
[1:11:47] now a crisis is the only way or the only
[1:11:52] thing that will produce
[1:11:54] a
[1:11:58] promotion give us our
[1:12:00] ranks give us a
[1:12:02] promotion then come through the crisis
[1:12:07] with uh oh my think about this for a
[1:12:11] moment think about this there's a
[1:12:12] promotion he wants to give
[1:12:15] you crisis produces
[1:12:21] promotion imagine
[1:12:24] God caused a national
[1:12:29] crisis he caused a national crisis in
[1:12:32] the greatest country at that
[1:12:36] time he destroyed the very economy of
[1:12:41] Egypt just so that a young man can could
[1:12:44] Ascend to the
[1:12:47] throne no I I don't think you believe
[1:12:52] that
[1:12:54] took a young man out of
[1:12:57] prison sent them through seven years of
[1:12:59] plenty and then seven years of of
[1:13:03] famine in
[1:13:05] theis he went to the
[1:13:07] throne became the number two man in all
[1:13:10] of
[1:13:12] Egypt he got a
[1:13:15] promotion his brothers hated him they
[1:13:19] were tried to kill him and then they
[1:13:21] sold him off was in prison wrongly
[1:13:26] accused and then he got a
[1:13:30] promotion I don't know about
[1:13:33] you but Joseph was the answer to the
[1:13:38] crisis he had the answer to the crisis
[1:13:41] in
[1:13:43] Egypt who Do You Think You Are the
[1:13:46] answer to the
[1:13:48] crisis what's the
[1:13:50] problem sounds good huh until you're
[1:13:53] going to the the
[1:13:54] crisis until you're sitting in
[1:13:58] prison how did this
[1:14:00] happen many of us are sitting in our own
[1:14:03] little
[1:14:04] prison wondering why am I in this
[1:14:08] condition you don't have to be in that
[1:14:11] condition you're in your condition
[1:14:13] because you have not
[1:14:16] recognized Christ is the answer in the
[1:14:21] crisis church I hope that this this is
[1:14:23] making sense to

[1:15:01] stirred that's the problem with so many
[1:15:05] people are you with me that's the
[1:15:07] problem with so many
[1:15:11] people I'm not enthusiastic about
[1:15:20] nothing I feel like I have no purpose

[1:15:29] crisis but in that crisis he's trying to
[1:15:32] manifest something in
[1:15:34] you he's stirring
[1:15:38] something inside of
[1:15:40] you because when that gift begins to

[1:17:55] answers to our
[1:17:57] prayers because God will not give you
[1:18:00] the answer to your
[1:18:02] prayer just because you asked
[1:18:05] him he won't answer you according to
[1:18:08] what you ask

[1:18:13] you can manage or what you can
[1:18:18] take a million
[1:18:21] dollars can't even manage
[1:18:23] $100 and give God a 10 from
[1:18:39] there many are going through what is
[1:18:41] called the god
[1:18:43] crisis anybody ever heard that term God
[1:18:49] crisis
[1:18:51] God they call that when a crisis of
[1:18:58] faith is a painful experience in a
[1:19:01] Christian's
[1:19:04] life when he or she begins to
[1:19:08] doubt what they have claimed to
[1:19:11] believe and it causes grief and
[1:19:15] confusion as well as a sense of
[1:19:18] disconnection from
[1:19:21] God I know that here
[1:19:24] today there are people that feel a
[1:19:27] disconnection from
[1:19:30] God but you've come to the right
[1:19:34] place come on now
[1:19:36] church if I were to ask how many of you
[1:19:39] feel
[1:19:40] disconnected in one way or
[1:19:43] another we got some hands we got a few
[1:19:46] hands you feel disconnected why going
[1:19:49] through a
[1:19:50] crisis we don't know what to do don't
[1:19:52] know where to
[1:19:54] we
[1:19:57] [Music]
[1:19:59] should that's why when I started getting
[1:20:01] those phone
[1:20:03] calls brother there there's going to be
[1:20:05] a great falling away in the
[1:20:09] message and I'm like what are you
[1:20:11] talking about oh brother Billy Paul
[1:20:14] passed
[1:20:15] away yeah there's going to be a great
[1:20:17] falling
[1:20:18] away and I'm like well if they fall away
[1:20:20] is because they have not been taught
[1:20:22] correctly
[1:20:25] [Applause]
[1:20:29] where in the message did Brother bam
[1:20:31] ever say brother Billy would not die
[1:20:33] that's
[1:20:36] right it's exactly the same way
[1:20:41] church it's it's exactly the same
[1:20:43] problem that Jesus
[1:20:45] had with his
[1:20:49] disciples right they were quarreling one
[1:20:51] with the other
[1:20:53] here Peter and John huh about what about
[1:20:57] that guy he was pretty sassy about it
[1:21:00] what about
[1:21:01] that lays on your
[1:21:04] bosom sure he called him a brown noser
[1:21:07] whatever
[1:21:11] you and Jesus comes to John and says
[1:21:14] looks at Peter and
[1:21:16] saysed what is it to
[1:21:20] you he terries I
[1:21:24] you know what they did the Bible says
[1:21:26] they they went telling everybody guess
[1:21:29] what I got I got the
[1:21:32] news John's not going to
[1:21:36] die yes or yes everybody was like No And
[1:21:41] then they they went and told their
[1:21:42] friends and they told their friends and
[1:21:45] next thing the Bible says it went out
[1:21:48] abroad and the word abroad there is not
[1:21:51] just in Israel they went to all the
[1:21:54] countries went around the
[1:21:57] world's not going to
[1:22:00] die it's exactly what we have done with
[1:22:02] the
[1:22:04] message he was told this and what's the
[1:22:11] problem this is what I'm talking about
[1:22:14] when our mind is not
[1:22:16] correct we'll take anything that is
[1:22:19] said twist it misconstrue it
[1:22:24] and then we want to go tell others about
[1:22:28] it what do you
[1:22:30] mean when did he say he wasn't going to
[1:22:34] die and yet some years later John is on
[1:22:38] the aisle
[1:22:40] of and he's taken in the
[1:22:43] spirit and he sees the coming of the
[1:22:47] Lord and then after that he passes
[1:22:51] on he fulfilled what Jesus
[1:22:55] said but they had misconstrued
[1:22:58] it come on trick are you with me this
[1:23:01] morning let's let's let's be serious
[1:23:04] about this people in Cris is
[1:23:08] everywhere and I'm talking to every one
[1:23:10] of
[1:23:11] us from the pastor to the

[1:23:51] church I don't have to pull no
[1:23:55] punches I was placed here for that
[1:23:59] purpose it's a critical moment right
[1:24:03] now where some can turn for the
[1:24:08] good or turn for the
[1:24:12] worst come on you you better know where
[1:24:15] you're
[1:24:16] standing I'm going to say it again you
[1:24:18] better know where you're
[1:24:20] standing because in this crisis
[1:24:24] you're either going to go one way or the
[1:24:27] other it's
[1:24:29] critical a crisis comes to
[1:24:32] show who is in the
[1:24:35] heart who is in the control
[1:24:37] room who is the real
[1:24:40] believer notice this now in the message
[1:24:43] seven compound names of
[1:24:45] Jehovah compound name Jehovah Martha and
[1:24:48] Mary Mar leaving the
[1:24:51] church and
[1:24:53] they had believed on
[1:24:55] Jesus and Jesus walked
[1:24:59] away left them in the crisis
[1:25:03] brother he left them in the
[1:25:06] crisis the boy was sick that was
[1:25:12] horrible they sent for him and he went
[1:25:16] further they sent again for him he still
[1:25:20] didn't come and after all hopes was
[1:25:26] gone Lazarus dies in The
[1:25:30] Crisis what he said he can go one way or
[1:25:32] the
[1:25:34] other way but it was never a crisis for
[1:25:41] Jesus I'm G to say it again it was never
[1:25:43] a crisis for
[1:25:46] Jesus my
[1:25:51] goodness I'm gonna tell you again it's
[1:25:53] never a crisis for
[1:25:58] Jesus it's at The Darkest Hour when all
[1:26:02] hopes are
[1:26:04] gone that Jesus came and as the thong
[1:26:08] says he was four days
[1:26:13] late and he was right on
[1:26:15] time
[1:26:17] hallelujah
[1:26:20] amen watch the mentality in the
[1:26:24] crisis
[1:26:26] Jesus too late he's
[1:26:29] dead no he's not no
[1:26:34] no no he's dead no put him in the
[1:26:38] already in the Tomb no he
[1:26:41] sleep he was dead to them because they
[1:26:44] couldn't do anything about
[1:26:47] it he was asleep to Jesus because he
[1:26:50] could do something about
[1:26:53] up and that's what he
[1:26:55] did when we see this that's when we come
[1:26:59] to these
[1:27:01] crisis and when we come and we're at
[1:27:04] that point where we don't know what to
[1:27:06] do we're
[1:27:08] turn brother Bram says Sovereign Grace
[1:27:11] Steeps
[1:27:12] in can you give one to the Lord for his
[1:27:21] sovereign we don't need more
[1:27:24] power we need more faith to use
[1:27:28] that now watch in the message I have
[1:27:31] heard but now I
[1:27:33] see now
[1:27:35] sometimes there's what we're looking
[1:27:38] for these great pulsations of
[1:27:44] Faith yeah it's it's heart to
[1:27:47] heart boom it it it's he sending faith
[1:27:52] the Revelation
[1:27:54] boom he's sending it to the to the body
[1:27:57] boom boom he says these great pulsations
[1:28:01] of
[1:28:03] Faith they come right in the time of
[1:28:12] Crisis it's usually crisis that drives
[1:28:15] us into
[1:28:17] this it was a crisis that drove job into
[1:28:21] it
[1:28:23] end of his life and his children dead
[1:28:25] the camels and so
[1:28:27] forth all the goods
[1:28:30] destroyed gone and his own life was
[1:28:33] broke out from the crown of his head to
[1:28:34] the SES of his feet with
[1:28:38] boils it was a
[1:28:40] crisis and then he pressed or that
[1:28:43] pressed
[1:28:46] his and there's where the inspiration
[1:28:49] struck
[1:28:51] him amen
[1:28:54] amen now in this
[1:28:57] hour this great crisis is
[1:29:03] on when we know that this nation is
[1:29:08] shaking not only the
[1:29:10] nation but the world is
[1:29:14] shaking it's at the end
[1:29:17] time there is not an another thing that
[1:29:20] I know to happen
[1:29:24] but the Rapture the coming of the Lord
[1:29:27] Jesus
[1:29:29] Christ it's already ready my question is
[1:29:32] are you looking for
[1:29:35] it or does the crisis have you so
[1:29:39] bound that you can't see
[1:29:43] Christ now I'm GNA turn the corner here
[1:29:45] okay you still with me or you I can wait
[1:29:48] till next Sunday to finish it
[1:29:53] then let's turn this corner because this
[1:29:55] this is where we want to get
[1:29:57] to once again we have to have the right
[1:30:00] mind in order to handle the
[1:30:05] crisis the problem
[1:30:07] is is that we've got to be
[1:30:11] reprogrammed not with our own
[1:30:15] ideas not with the ideas of the
[1:30:17] professor in the
[1:30:19] University ideas of this motiv
[1:30:24] speakers something greater than
[1:30:27] this and go let's go back to Matthew the
[1:30:30] 22nd
[1:30:33] chapter and please follow me on this
[1:30:35] because this
[1:30:37] is the the message really that that we
[1:30:41] it settles in
[1:30:43] now and we read that what think you of
[1:30:46] Christ whose son is he that's verse
[1:30:50] 42 this is what got me
[1:30:54] here because without
[1:30:58] realizing these men that were so smart
[1:31:01] and so wise in the in the
[1:31:04] law and here comes
[1:31:06] Jesus first thing he
[1:31:09] does he challenges their
[1:31:16] think say that
[1:31:18] again what he's doing to each one of us
[1:31:23] today challenging your
[1:31:26] thinking what think ye of
[1:31:30] Christ the only way to think you have a
[1:31:32] have to have a
[1:31:35] mind and your answer depends on which
[1:31:37] mind you have
[1:31:40] right what think he of Christ he's gonna
[1:31:44] show them right
[1:31:46] away thinking is
[1:31:50] caral yeah that's right he's proving
[1:31:53] this to them and right in their
[1:31:56] faces what think he of Christ whose son
[1:31:59] is
[1:31:59] he that's son of David yeah through the
[1:32:03] carinal
[1:32:05] lineage watch where the answer comes now
[1:32:09] he said then how does David in spirit
[1:32:13] now in other words you've answered it
[1:32:15] according to the
[1:32:17] flesh but then how does David in spirit
[1:32:20] call him Lord
[1:32:24] the Lord said unto my
[1:32:26] Lord verse 45 if David then call him
[1:32:30] Lord how is he his
[1:32:33] son the more that I thought about that
[1:32:35] the more blown away I
[1:32:39] was Christ the
[1:32:41] word is challenging their
[1:32:45] thinking he's showing them that their
[1:32:48] thinking is carnal and not spiritual
[1:32:52] for that which is born of the flesh is
[1:32:56] flesh but that which is born of the
[1:32:59] spirit is
[1:33:00] Spirit this morning he's challenging our
[1:33:04] Thinking by hearing people talk you can
[1:33:08] tell whether they're using their mind or
[1:33:10] the mind of
[1:33:12] Christ the greatest well I
[1:33:20] think
[1:33:25] I'm
[1:33:26] sorry but I'm going to say it
[1:33:29] again he challenging
[1:33:33] our because if we were spiritual
[1:33:37] minded we don't answer well I
[1:33:41] think nobody cares what I
[1:33:45] think brother Caleb
[1:33:47] thinks but now Christ I want to know
[1:33:51] what Christ thinks about
[1:33:53] it now if brother Caleb has the mind of
[1:33:57] Christ then I can't help you under well
[1:33:59] I
[1:34:01] think I get that all the time brother
[1:34:03] Caleb what do you think about
[1:34:08] this I don't
[1:34:10] know if I give them what I
[1:34:13] think I haven't
[1:34:15] help but when the inspiration can
[1:34:19] come his mind comes on the scene
[1:34:22] and he says and and I say well this is
[1:34:24] what the word
[1:34:26] says this is what all the thing changes
[1:34:30] now the atmosphere
[1:34:33] changes the answer
[1:34:36] changes why it's no more a carnal way of
[1:34:40] thinking it is him
[1:34:42] now this is this this got me so
[1:34:47] good and I want to make sure that I can
[1:34:49] convey this to you what time is it
[1:34:52] I can have about 15 20 minutes still 30
[1:34:55] minutes or so somewhere in
[1:34:57] there watch this
[1:35:02] now because Jesus knew their
[1:35:06] hearts he would catch their
[1:35:10] thoughts and the first thing he would
[1:35:12] say is don't think that
[1:35:14] way how many read that in the
[1:35:18] Bible what do you think of Christ he
[1:35:20] already knew the
[1:35:23] answer he knew where they were going
[1:35:26] follow me closely right now Jesus would
[1:35:28] say don't think that
[1:35:30] way you've been
[1:35:32] programmed by
[1:35:34] religion to think a certain way you may
[1:35:37] be been programmed to believe or to
[1:35:39] think that there are three
[1:35:42] Gods you may programmed to believe
[1:35:45] different things that you
[1:35:47] believe Jesus would come back and say
[1:35:49] but don't think that
[1:35:52] yes or yes you read your
[1:35:54] Bible imagine the religious
[1:35:58] people looking at
[1:36:00] Jesus and
[1:36:03] say who is this
[1:36:07] guy trying to come and destroy the law
[1:36:10] and the
[1:36:13] prophets religion
[1:36:16] that but when Jesus catches
[1:36:20] it Matthew
[1:36:23] 57 first thing he tells
[1:36:27] them think
[1:36:31] not I don't even have to go any
[1:36:33] further I don't have to go any further
[1:36:36] than that think not you're using your
[1:36:39] carnal
[1:36:41] brain stop stop what do you think well I
[1:36:46] think are you with me or
[1:36:49] not come on now this is what Jesus is
[1:36:51] telling them think not stop thinking
[1:36:55] that
[1:36:56] way that I am come to destroy the law or
[1:36:59] the
[1:37:01] prophet I am not come to destroy but to
[1:37:05] fulfill now you're putting on the mind
[1:37:08] of
[1:37:09] Christ he's re trying to reprogram their
[1:37:13] thinking he can't tell them to think
[1:37:16] not unless he gives them something
[1:37:19] better to think about
[1:37:22] oh I'm going to say that
[1:37:25] again he cannot tell them don't think
[1:37:27] like
[1:37:29] that he doesn't give them something
[1:37:31] better to think
[1:37:32] about think that I come to destroy the
[1:37:36] law fill
[1:37:38] it I came to magnify
[1:37:40] it now you're thinking the right
[1:37:44] way now well the pastor he he plays
[1:37:47] favoritism in
[1:37:49] church wow
[1:37:52] think
[1:37:57] not oh come
[1:37:59] on I I believe the
[1:38:02] pastor
[1:38:05] but
[1:38:11] not I don't know if I lost some of you
[1:38:13] or
[1:38:14] what here's Jesus Matthew
[1:38:18] 10:34 Jesus the prince of peace
[1:38:22] there he goes
[1:38:23] again think
[1:38:30] not think
[1:38:32] not that I am come to send peace on the
[1:38:36] earth oh I'm gonna be a Christian and
[1:38:38] we're g to be so
[1:38:41] peaceful think
[1:38:48] not I help us
[1:38:54] I came not to
[1:38:57] send but a
[1:39:02] sword I didn't come to send peace I came
[1:39:04] to send a
[1:39:06] sword I am come to set a man at variance
[1:39:09] against his father and the daughter
[1:39:10] against her mother and the
[1:39:11] daughter-in-law against her
[1:39:16] mother-in-law uh what does this do come
[1:39:18] on it causes the crisis
[1:39:22] it causes crisis in the
[1:39:24] home you go to that church but don't
[1:39:27] talk to me no more Cris is in the home
[1:39:31] Jesus said I have come to send a
[1:39:33] sword and I've come to set at
[1:39:37] variance a man's foes shall be they of
[1:39:40] his own
[1:39:44] household a
[1:39:47] crisis he that loveth father and mother
[1:39:49] more than me is not worthy of
[1:39:54] me he that love his son or daughter more
[1:39:57] than me is not worthy of
[1:40:02] me he that taketh not his cross and
[1:40:04] followeth after me is not worthy of
[1:40:08] me he that findeth his life shall lose
[1:40:11] it and he that loseth his life for my
[1:40:14] sake shall find
[1:40:16] it I thought everything was going to be
[1:40:18] fine when I became a Christian
[1:40:22] they would all be and
[1:40:24] Roses I I wouldn't have no
[1:40:28] problems sorry you were
[1:40:31] misinformed but now you're in a battle
[1:40:33] so you might as well
[1:40:37] fight I didn't come to send peace to the
[1:40:39] Earth but a
[1:40:41] sword in other words if you want peace
[1:40:44] Pi up the
[1:40:47] sword Hallelujah and that sword is the
[1:40:50] word
[1:40:52] and with that sword you drive out all
[1:40:54] the squatters that are living in your
[1:40:59] land there a lot of squatters on our
[1:41:01] land right
[1:41:04] now when we're looking at things we're
[1:41:06] not supposed to there's a squatter on
[1:41:08] your
[1:41:11] land when we're thinking a certain way
[1:41:13] there's a squatter
[1:41:15] in take out the
[1:41:18] sword dve them out of your
[1:41:22] it's the problem we don't use the
[1:41:25] word god do everything for
[1:41:28] me he's already done it all but take him
[1:41:32] at his word
[1:41:36] now this is we see this we see the
[1:41:40] reality of Christ in the
[1:41:45] crisis for the word of God is
[1:41:48] quick sharper than any two edges
[1:41:52] are you getting
[1:41:56] it you can't have peace without
[1:42:00] CH that sounds
[1:42:02] like like it doesn't go
[1:42:05] together he's in a
[1:42:08] crisis of
[1:42:11] course because when we understand
[1:42:13] this Jesus said in John
[1:42:18] 16:33 these things I have spoken unto
[1:42:23] you that in me in me you might have
[1:42:29] peace that's why I can be in the
[1:42:32] crisis but if I am in
[1:42:34] Christ I'm at
[1:42:37] peace I didn't come just to send peace
[1:42:41] you want peace he's he's inviting you in
[1:42:45] me that's the meeting
[1:42:48] place in Christ is the the
[1:42:52] peace watch what he says that in me you
[1:42:55] might have
[1:42:56] peace in the
[1:42:59] world you will have
[1:43:01] tribulation but if you want
[1:43:04] peace come in me be of good cheer I have
[1:43:08] overcome the
[1:43:09] world watch how it
[1:43:11] changes this next one Luke 12:40 blew me
[1:43:17] away be therefore ready also
[1:43:23] for the son of man
[1:43:26] cometh at an hour when you think
[1:43:33] not we say usually the son of man comes
[1:43:39] at an hour when we least expect
[1:43:42] it my question
[1:43:45] is is he gonna come when we least expect
[1:43:49] him the bride of Christ isn't least
[1:43:53] expecting
[1:43:57] him we are expecting
[1:44:00] him oh come on now the son of man will
[1:44:03] come when you least expect
[1:44:06] it said the son of man will
[1:44:10] come at an hour when you think
[1:44:14] not words at an hour when you're no
[1:44:16] longer using your own
[1:44:19] thoughts you think
[1:44:21] not that the son of man
[1:44:24] comes comes on the scene to do what to
[1:44:28] take us to make us to mold
[1:44:30] us to prepare us that's what the
[1:44:34] ministry of the son of man
[1:44:36] did it was to get a bride
[1:44:40] prepared so that we could be in
[1:44:43] expectation of the
[1:44:47] groom I don't know about you but he's
[1:44:50] not coming in an hour that I least
[1:44:52] expected he's coming the moment that I
[1:44:56] stop thinking my own
[1:45:02] thoughts I don't know if you get that or
[1:45:05] not stop thinking I had to stop thinking
[1:45:08] my thoughts a long time
[1:45:10] ago let this mind be in
[1:45:14] you was also in Christ
[1:45:17] Jesus the moment we put the put on the
[1:45:19] mind of Christ
[1:45:22] that's the hour he
[1:45:24] comes you want healing who needs healing
[1:45:29] today let me see raise your hand if you
[1:45:32] be
[1:45:33] afraid it don't matter if it's spiritual
[1:45:35] if it's
[1:45:38] physical you need
[1:45:40] healing think
[1:45:47] notah what else am I going to tell you
[1:45:49] think not
[1:45:51] well the doctor said there's no
[1:45:56] cure you're thinking is being
[1:46:01] influenced who needs salvation
[1:46:04] today don't think not just receive him
[1:46:08] doesn't need you to think of how how
[1:46:10] it's going to
[1:46:12] happen you're in the middle of a
[1:46:15] crisis but I already overcame
[1:46:19] world the mind of Christ comes it flows
[1:46:21] through the
[1:46:23] channel that's where the
[1:46:26] anointing through that mind comes the
[1:46:28] word
[1:46:30] flowing but there's no
[1:46:33] cure but he was wounded
[1:46:37] for oh come
[1:46:39] on think not this way but in his mind he
[1:46:44] was wounded for
[1:46:46] my transgression he was bred for my
[1:46:49] iniquities the chastisement of his peace
[1:46:52] was upon
[1:46:53] me by his stripes I Caleb Bettis am
[1:47:01] healed we could have the purest
[1:47:04] intentions we can have the purest
[1:47:07] intention and somebody will mistreat
[1:47:12] us why' you look at me like
[1:47:15] that
[1:47:17] like me how did I look at you
[1:47:22] kind of
[1:47:27] like
[1:47:29] sry I don't think about
[1:47:35] forgiving listen to
[1:47:37] this I went to the Lincoln
[1:47:43] Memorial this this is
[1:47:45] all needful for this
[1:47:48] message and I I I saw some quotes of
[1:47:52] Abraham Lincoln that I that really
[1:47:54] struck
[1:47:58] me how many of you know why the Civil
[1:48:00] War was
[1:48:08] fought the majority of the people would
[1:48:10] say it was fought for
[1:48:13] slavery
[1:48:18] slavery fighting over the issue
[1:48:21] right TR to one side trying to abolish
[1:48:23] slavery and the other side
[1:48:26] was maintain
[1:48:28] that and though that was one of the
[1:48:31] great
[1:48:34] issues that Mo motivated both
[1:48:38] sides that was never the focal point of
[1:48:43] Abra because this this is this is the
[1:48:47] message Abraham Lincoln said this abah
[1:48:50] you know I dislike
[1:48:53] slavery and you fully admit the abstract
[1:48:57] wrong of
[1:49:01] it but my
[1:49:03] enemies pretend that I am now carrying
[1:49:06] on the
[1:49:08] war for the sole purpose of
[1:49:12] abolition to abolish the
[1:49:15] slavery he says but so long as I am
[1:49:19] president
[1:49:21] it shall be carried on for the sole
[1:49:25] purpose of restoring the
[1:49:29] union oh Church get get the spiritual
[1:49:33] application of
[1:49:34] this I would save the
[1:49:38] union he said my Paramount
[1:49:42] object in this
[1:49:45] struggle is to save the
[1:49:48] union and it is not to to save or
[1:49:51] destroy
[1:49:54] slavery if I could save the
[1:49:57] union without freeing any
[1:50:00] slaves I would do it if I could save it
[1:50:03] by freeing all the
[1:50:06] slaves I would do it if I could save it
[1:50:09] by freeing some and leaving others
[1:50:13] alone I would also do
[1:50:16] that it wasn't about that issue
[1:50:21] it was about the
[1:50:23] Unity come on church it was about the
[1:50:26] unity it was about the
[1:50:29] union and when we when we understand
[1:50:32] this and we see what was the purpose of
[1:50:36] sending a
[1:50:38] Prophet come on CH what's the
[1:50:41] purpose we sit around say look I don't
[1:50:45] believe it like you I don't believe it
[1:50:46] like you I want to ask everyone who
[1:50:49] claims the message
[1:50:52] was the purpose of this message being
[1:50:54] brought to
[1:50:56] us was it to start a civil war amongst
[1:51:01] Brothers was it to fight over doctrinal
[1:51:05] points was it to prove that my way of
[1:51:08] thinking is better than
[1:51:11] yours and that I have more quotes than
[1:51:14] you was it to start a
[1:51:18] fight between those that hear tapes and
[1:51:20] those that want to hear the fold
[1:51:25] Ministry what was the purpose of all
[1:51:28] these
[1:51:29] Visions so that we could fight about the
[1:51:32] tent
[1:51:34] Ministry the return or the
[1:51:37] Thunders but they're revealed or
[1:51:39] not no no no no no we have made issues
[1:51:44] of those
[1:51:45] things and by doing so we have divided
[1:51:50] the
[1:51:52] Brotherhood what was the
[1:51:54] purpose the message and the
[1:51:58] messenger one and the same being one and
[1:52:01] the same what was the purpose of this
[1:52:04] message brought to
[1:52:06] us as the eagle stirreth her
[1:52:09] nest my
[1:52:11] Min is a
[1:52:14] Ministry trying to unite the body of
[1:52:18] Christ yes not to unite denomination to
[1:52:22] another
[1:52:25] denomination but unite brothers and
[1:52:29] sisters as one group of
[1:52:33] people one in
[1:52:36] purpose one in
[1:52:38] heart one in
[1:52:40] unity in order to see the coming of the
[1:52:45] Lord oh church church what are we doing
[1:52:47] with
[1:52:48] this we Have Made issues of
[1:52:51] everything in the message turning
[1:52:56] northward because the church cannot go
[1:52:58] with an arm in one
[1:53:01] place a head
[1:53:03] another foot
[1:53:05] another you got to have
[1:53:09] prophesying and a noise of coming
[1:53:14] together that's all I can tell you till
[1:53:18] the whole body of the Lord Jesus
[1:53:22] Christ stands up as one great unit of
[1:53:26] God then we'll leave this
[1:53:29] mountain and we'll go over and possess
[1:53:32] the promised
[1:53:35] land I'm your brother and I'm only
[1:53:39] fighting for that one
[1:53:41] purpose to unite the Church of the
[1:53:43] Living
[1:53:45] God one heart and one
[1:53:48] Accord the purpose of the ministry of
[1:53:51] the seventh
[1:53:53] angel to open and reveal the
[1:53:57] Mysteries that under that
[1:53:59] Revelation the complete revelation of
[1:54:02] the whole
[1:54:03] thing it would restore the
[1:54:08] Union what is he doing what is the
[1:54:10] message doing we seem like we get
[1:54:13] farther and farther away from each
[1:54:16] other what what message are we following
[1:54:21] shame on
[1:54:24] [Music]
[1:54:26] us it was to bring the bride the body
[1:54:32] together and then to unite the head
[1:54:35] which is
[1:54:38] Christ to make
[1:54:41] one if that's not what's going on in our
[1:54:45] lives missed the whole essence of the
[1:54:48] message
[1:54:51] that's why he preaches uniting time and
[1:54:55] sign he preach the invisible
[1:54:59] Union why that was the
[1:55:02] purpose was for the
[1:55:05] you when I see this and I and I'm gonna
[1:55:08] I'm gonna just pass over a few things
[1:55:10] there's so much
[1:55:14] here I want to
[1:55:17] just if I open up this one I will be
[1:55:20] here for a
[1:55:26] long it's not what was said that was
[1:55:31] wrong it's that the way we interpreted

[1:55:56] history of

[1:56:03] time we're in the midst of the greatest
[1:56:09] manifestation of all

[1:56:23] church we're in the middle of it and the

[2:38:19] scriptural reference to
[2:38:23] that and this church is based upon what
[2:38:26] the scripture
[2:38:29] says St Mark the 10th chapter in the
[2:38:32] 13th verse
[2:38:34] says and to 16 and they said and they
[2:38:37] brought young children to him that he
[2:38:40] should touch them and his disciples
[2:38:42] rebuke those that brought them but when
[2:38:45] Jesus saw it he was much displeased and
[2:38:48] said unto them suffer the little
[2:38:50] children to come unto me and forbid them
[2:38:53] not for of such is the kingdom of
[2:39:10] God verily I say unto you whosoever
[2:39:13] shall receive the kingdom of God as
[2:39:15] little child he shall enter
[2:39:22] therein and he took them up in his arms
[2:39:27] put his hands upon them and blessed
[2:39:34] them we we simply say they
[2:39:39] are God's gift to
[2:39:43] you J
