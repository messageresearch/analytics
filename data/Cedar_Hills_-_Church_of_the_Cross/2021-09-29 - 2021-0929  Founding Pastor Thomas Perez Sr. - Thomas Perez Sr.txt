[Music] i pray as i pray every every time i bring well i guess that's all right but if you really come with a desire to know more about him i'm here this morning because i want [Music] preached it many times but never did i see it the way i saw it last night and it said the lord god said behold the man is become as one of us verse 22 of the third chapter of genesis [Music] notice that it seems to speak to a trinity here to know berlin and now i want you to really get this and if you can just clear your minds your spirits of everything right now and just just if you have it here you hear what the spirit said to the church this morning he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life [Music] in genesis 1 26 henry says he says god said let us make in our image after our likeness it seems like he's speaking again god reveals himself in three offices of pcos three persons of the godhead in genesis 1 26 he is talking with his son god the spirit cannot be seen the bible says that the only begotten which was in the bosom of the father had declared him this is let so that was the image that man was going to be made out of essence the spirit father the spirit overshadowed the seed which is the word [Music] [Music] [Music] life okay you have to stop for a minute and think the thing is the holy spirit reveal that to you [Music] when the man received this part of god [Music] the man was that tree of life because the tree [Music] there was no such a thing as death or sickness [Music] [Applause] that's a beautiful thing today the world we live in it's full of sickness and sorrow and death [Music] i went to the rest home yesterday here in silver city we are casable in the silver city i said what a demon field [Music] but healing for christ lived in this manner i know it's hard for a lot of people to try to put this together as far as seeing a man like a tree that's why many people have a hard time understanding serpenty more scripture and show you and all the lord willing how the man is like a tree now disobey god [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] so god [Music] and now the holy spirit in the heart of the believers to finish the work [Music] in genesis 3 if we can carefully and maybe i can find myself a little bit not to do much preaching but maybe teaching so to help you we find that [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] he has the authority in his hands watch a man with authority that's why girls are dangerous if they have no characters love watch how the sheriffs walk through town and the state police i got authority to give [Music] once the authority comes a man gets [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] everything was subject to the man because god placed dominion when i was when the lord was given this passage last life because he has the man has the authority in his hands and he has to afford [Music] because the [Music] god's [Music] [Music] the life is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] because when god [Music] and that's how he made [Music] until you [Music] [Applause] that was [Music] [Applause] he knew exactly what he was doing [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] exactly what satan [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] no [Music] let us consider this street [Music] [Music] [Music] oh and of course you know his father was with brother graham since 1946.
