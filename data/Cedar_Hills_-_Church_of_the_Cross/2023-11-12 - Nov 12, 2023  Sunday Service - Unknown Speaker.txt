to keep our um our pastor and those that are traveling with him and that God would bless them take care of them and um but we're here amen amen so not to keep you standing too much longer let's go ahead and read the scripture in first John 4 very wellknown scripture and read give you a little bit of time to find it ready and it says beloved who's he talking about right there beloved I guess not everybody one more time beloved who's he speaking to believe not every Spirit but try the spirit Spirits where the there of God because many false prophets are gone into the world verse two hereby know ye remember those words know ye the spirit of God every spirit that confessed that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God and this is that Spirit of antichrist wherefore ye have heard it heard that it should come and even now already is in the world but ye a ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world of the world therefore they speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of God one more time we are of God watch keep this this line in in in uh in your in your mind okay he that knoweth God heareth us he that is not of God Hearth not us hereby know know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error you may be seated and as always we want to we want to thank the pastor for for having the confidence to to let us speak surely he knows it seems like he knows us better than we know ourselves because in with in everyday life there's many things that we battle with and uh you know the the title there they put it up the hidden gospel with a subtitle fear not so many things that we go through in life many battles that we go through daily it seems like many times many ups and downs many times we're on the mountain many times we're in the valley and and look all around you and it seems like there's a total collapse of everything we're not okay total collapse of the nation total collapse of the economy total collapse of the dollar total collapse of morals total collapse of values it's completely falling apart the world is already fallen apart amen amen and it's a fearful thing right does it does it worry you does it worry you to see all the sickness around you do we get scared or do we fear oh the pandemic still coming on still going on there seems like there is a new variant every other month they're already talking about the next one coming what do we do what do we do as a people and and I also wanted to apologize for the last time I spoke before I proceed I I spoke a little bit about Ai and I got a lot of feedback a lot of people were worried about that a lot of people they got scared of that and I felt bad because that wasn't my intention my intention is not to put fear in you my sole intention is just to make us all aware of what's going on to let us know that we have to get closer to God now fear is known as a as a negative term and it is but the scripture also says the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom how does that work I thought I thought we weren't supposed to fear brother Brandon mentions the word fear about over 1300 times in the message I I I forget I I know there's instances of fear in the Bible and they're talking about it being about 365 in certain instances 30 that that 365 days right one instance for each day of the year but then he tells you not to fear to fear the lord to fear God how does that work I thought that wasn't we weren't supposed to fear the pastor gets up on on Wednesday after brother Ron's message mention some pretty heavy stuff on things that are going on how many got scared how many got worried you don't have to answer it within yourself you know have so just just follow me a little bit okay now the Lord wants he wants that fear of the Lord so referring back to Wednesday he'll put a little scare in you I'm not talking about fear I'm I'm I'm not speaking of fear on this instance but sometimes he has to put a little bit of scare in US is why does he do that sometimes he has to get our attention sometimes he has to get my attention brother Jerry is very thickheaded Jer right brother Jerry you know you know this brother Jerry gonzale is very thickheaded he doesn't like a lot he doesn't like people telling him what to do many times so but but we know that we go around life and everyone tells us what to do the the the pastors here as a head for to the church if you work for somebody you have to listen to to them so I I got to get this little tough boy mentality brother that's not the case but sometimes he has to put a little bit of just a little bit scare you just a little bit because you know you know that to be scared in the natural body is actually something that could be helpful what happens when something frightens you it scares you oh there's a dangerous person or situation oh that dog could bite me oh it scares me so it what it does is your body has a natural reaction comes a little bit of adrenaline adrenaline into you why does it do that because it makes us alert it brings you to an em a response a fight or flight right you get scared and your body you react right away you're going to encounter the issue or you're going to run away so the Lord puts a little bit of fear in you so that we can fight off Satan's traps run away from that situation and run to that strong tower that's that's in the natural so now I'm not talking about fear that's different but he likes say he likes to scare you just a little bit keep us on our toes how many understand that what exactly is fear then we're going to going to turn the flip the coin on the other side now we know fear is a spirit right brother dieo brother Diego told us fear is it's a he's a little demon and he goes around and he feeds off of fear off of your fear but let me let me get to this first here what what is fear exactly an unpleasant put the definition up brothers please just so you can get a visual of it it's an unpleasant often strong emotion caused by anticipation or awareness of danger an instance of this emotion a state marked by this emotion anxious concern reason for alarm or like the one we just talked about a uh profound reverence the other day the Lord the way I got this thought we were going to bed the other night probably about two weeks ago and my wife told me I heard something so I got up kind of you know frantic I got up but it was weird because fear entered into my body I never felt it like that but I got up and I was like nervous I was even almost shaking it was debilitating and then all of a sudden just went away and the word fear came to me okay I didn't think anything of it but then I heard I was talking to a brother the other day and he told me I've been studying something I told yeah me too I let him speak first yeah he says I've been studying the word fear I was okay that's kind of that's that's strange is that right brother Daniel me and Daniel were like kind of okay so I didn't think nothing of it and then the other day when we had a service we came up to the altar I believe it's just alcia when she spoke with no more fear okay so so it hit me again okay so I'm like there's something here right me and the stick skull I mean I mean yeah me and the thick skull okay so so then we spoke about brother Caleb talked about on Wednesday after the preaching I said I was in the back I if he mentions the word fear I know it's you Lord after the other 10 times that that so sure enough he mentions the word fear says okay Lord I'll I'll I'll look into it and I'll give the people my experience help the people not to scare anybody it's it's not for that if we speak anything is to help you it's to make you alert you get you thinking you get you running to the things of the Lord because the problem is if you get a scared in the body that's okay the problem starts when it starts to tap into the spirit now watch this put put up the the The List Brothers of the see to be frightened or scared in the flesh will cause you to be alert right we see the SE taste here smell touch we know senses of the body put the one for the spirit this is where it gets tricky conscious reason imagination memory I I put imagination twice I what the the other one was but yeah I put imagination twice sorry but you you get the you get the picture right so you see fear now start to creep in start to hit your spirit now your conscience is uh I remember this I remember I did that so that conscience is always always has you worried watching your back reason you're always always reasoning with everything but this is this is the one here that will get you imagination when fear hits you in your spirit and it Taps into imagination you start to make things up in your mind we we're in the dark oh maybe there's a the boogeyman's goingon to get me you start to think that way right you know us Hispanics growing up a little bit of little bit of a of not it's not a joke but just to kind of relax you a little so you're all there on the bed and your and your legs hanging there on the bed and you're like whenever something's under the bed scares you right imagination so I know that's like I said just a little bit of of a joke for you to relax you but you have to be careful with that I have to be careful with that because if it starts to hit my imagination then I start to think that I have something that I don't oh maybe I have a a cough maybe maybe all this I get a pain on the side oh maybe maybe it's cancer I don't know maybe it's a sickness I don't know it begins to work in your mind to the point where it starts to affect your body because when you're in constant state of fear when you're anxious when you're worried you know those are also types of fear those are synonymous words for fear and Satan uses those tools to keep the Believers bound why because then the spirit goes into the body constantly worried upset fussing all these things brother brand say those things cause cancer he said because those when you're when you have that and it hits your body it starts to pump what's called cortisol into your body I don't know that cortisol it's it's a hormone in your body so when you're in this constant state of fight or flight caused by fear caused by worry by stress by anxiety this this hormone is constantly pumping in your body but what it does starts to cause inflammation register in your body certain it inflames certain cells in your body and it makes you more prone to for them that they turn into cancer cells right you know brother Caleb told me this information I couldn't find it but I I thought it goes with this he says I don't know how many years back they took the breathing rate of a human is compared to today and they say the breathing rate has increased why fire flight they said to be frighting for a moment is okay for but when it has become the norm in our lives when we live in those conditions then we I wonder why we're sick you're you're stressed out you're tired we're exhausted why because we're constantly fight or fight mode and the the thing is this a lot of times we fight with one another we run from the things of the Lord instead of running to him we're we're we run away from him then we wonder why we're sick we wonder why we're in constant fear that can still be uprooted but the problem the real problem is when fear starts to creep into the soul and it manifests itself in the form of doubt now many times there's certain things I have done to make myself sick and because I don't change my habits then I start to doubt God Lord why don't you help me when I created the problem I start to doubt him remember in the soul there's only one of two things in there only one of two things can exist and that is Faith or doubt fear not fear watch the acronym of fear brother Daniel gave me this you want to put it up Brothers just to get a visual the acronym the acronym of fear right f e a r it's false evidence appearing real and that the truth ain't that what happens in the spirit imagination and it starts to trigger what do we do you know I heard the news the other day and it it hurt me you know when when when we heard about brother Diego and I'll tell you why because if there's somebody that has been by my side when my mother was sick in hospital anytime I'm just mentioning a certain time in Co he was there he was there for many were there but but but the way the way he was there I I want to give him a little bit of flower okay throughout our journey okay and I want to appreciate everybody that took part of my wife's baby shower baby yesterday was beautiful I want to thank each and every one of you that had a hand in it everybody you you blessed us greatly you know how many times that I hear the people say oh those are our babies all in this together and I appreciate that I really really appreciate that because you feel the love of the people because this has been a journey and you have worried fear has hit me many times many times like I said I've imagined things even to the point where where where the thought tries to come in says oh my gosh you have twins coming at 46 years old worry so you you know you think of these things right I want to be an open book okay you know I'm not going to sit here and tell you that I that that I got any answers to anything but it worried me part of the inspiration of this message was when I called brother Diego I call him brother dieo how are you I'm checking on you just to just to know I want you to know that I'm there for you the way you've been by my side I want to stand by your side but he got the news and I thought he was going to be done anybody knows I talks to brother Diego he's very upbeat very happy I was watching his noticing his voice it didn't skip a beat uh you want to know how it is to combat fear you want to know how to combat it you don't you want to know what that looks like if you stand look at him he did not skip a beat what's inside of him gotten a hold of something that's why when fear should have hit him he says fear I will be your fear now I talk to him and I was amazed that someone could act that way in the face of the news he's gotten but brother what what are you going to tell the cancer what did you tell him people say oh brother Diego you have a problem because you have cancer no no no you you you have it misplaced now cancer has a problem because cancer is death and it is written in the Bible that's right I will be your death thank you brother but I saw another tremendous scene when they brought him to pray for him in the front I saw the pastor and the ministry put hands on him then I see him turn around and see brother Fabio then he begins to pray for brother fa but it didn't stop there I saw brother Fabi turned around and he began to pray for brother why because there's no fear in this men because they have found him you know the greatest fear of a human is is the fear of the unknown what happens after we die I'm sick what's going to happen I don't have money how am I going to pay the bills oh nobody loves me imagination but when you find him you find him there is no fear it's the hidden gospel it's hidden it was God above us but people were scared because he would speak and the mountains were shame they were scared so the Moses you will be God to the people an identification right there he had to put Flesh on it God seeing that He sent Jesus Christ created a body dwelt in Jesus and he showed us he made the way he eradicated fear took over everything death hell and the grave that's the only reason we're able to talk about this or talk like this because of him it's no man it's him we just have to find him where is he today God above us God With Us was crucified began to fear again because he left what do we do don't fear I'll send you another comforter I'll send you another comforter send back his Spirit where is the spirit today God Came In the Flesh in Jesus Christ the scripture says God was manifested In the Flesh in Jesus Christ scripture that we read in John says now that Jesus is coming flesh has Jesus come in your flesh that's where it's hidden hidden gospel the word many people read the Bible and it's hidden from the wise and The Prudent but I got this title from Brother Tommy he preaches not the hidden word we know that he preaches the hidden gospel it's hidden in those that make the word do what it said he was going to [Applause] do amen the hidden gospel is hidden in you and I but it's no longer hidden amen amen you follow me a little bit Hebrews 1:1 God who in sunnd Dr times and diverse matters spake in times passed by the fathers by the prophets in these last days spoken unto us by his son amen we know that God had one son and that was Jesus Christ but now Jesus Christ had many sons in so where is he speaking when we didn't know him when there was fear maybe he spoke by the prophets back then in this last time he spoke he's speaking to us by the sun Jesus Christ come in your flesh amen amen that make sense a little bit try to find this act 17 2022 we'll just do to save time 7 uh 23 for as I passed by and beheld your devotions I found an altar with the inscription to the unknown God whom therefore ye ignorantly worship Him declare I unto you to the unknown God is he still unknown today I'll tell you one thing if he's unknown in our lives it's no wonder why we're scared no wonder we have fear remember the human he fears what he doesn't know but if we find him search the scriptures in them you for in them um you think you have eternal life and and we heard think not is well I thought I had it or you think you have it no your thinking faculty is that that's the only ways we got to find him the only way you're going to find him is in his word Daniel says I I he knew the time by the reading of books these books only or reading the books reading the message remember the message and the message messenger are one you know that's the beauty of this message Paul says to the inscription of the unknown God but thanks be to God that we have a prophet he used to be unknown but this Prophet lifted him up out of History he tied up the Loose Ends the mystery should be finished right it say should because it's is the mystery still in you it's subed to each one each one has to answer that but this message of the hour he came to put a face to the name amen oh Moses you will be God to the people the great God came in Jesus Christ the holy spirit in people is showing you where he was hidden today under the dispensation of the Holy Ghost we know that he transferred his kingdom it's in the heart of the believer is it in the heart of Jerry is it in your heart is it in your hearten amen you know what what do we do many times we we we go around I'm have all right but but but watch this many times we think that we can that it's our works that get us there watch this great conqueror we we've heard of Alexander the Great right one of the greatest conquerors this world but when he found his end know that on his deathbed he had three wishes and and the first one was that only his Physicians carry his dead body number two the path leading to to his grave be adorned with precious stones of gold and the third one and the most strange of them all that both his hands opened both hands be open and that they be left dangling outside his cof so his generals asked him why such strange requests and he replied he wanted to show that by making Physicians carry his body people understood that no doctor could be death he desired the path to his grave be adorned with Treasures to show people that although he spent most of his life chasing Riches of the world he had to leave them all behind and thirdly he wanted both his hands open and out of the coffin to show he would be leaving this world World empty-handed just like he when he was born imagine such a great conqueror met his end but when doctors stop when your money can do no good for you no longer when science stops that's where God takes over right and it's something with this message it's not the unknown anymore even to the point where brother Bram was saying don't fear cancer he exposed it why because it would no longer be unknown fear of the human is the unknown amen amen so excuse me so that's that's the thing we have to get there we have to understand what is it that he's requiring of us he's requiring of us to believe he's requiring of us to stand on his word he's requiring of us to push out all unbelief and doubt why because we heard on Wednesday eternity is imperfect well it's imperfect where in us well this flesh Ain perfect this guy but what's inside of us so if we can begin to perfect him as we begin to get together and unite more it begins to push out the imperfectness in our body perfect love castes all fear away there's no room for cancer brother it cannot it cannot be in that environment that's the problem is we have to get that environment so that none of this hatred fear despair uh anxiety an depression depression stress and my my big one worry to where those things have no room eternity begins to push out the hickey and each one of us first it begins to push the imperfections out amen amen before we can gather all together and be in one Accord and be in one Accord for real the differences have to be pushed out have to be pushed out of this body talking about nobody else the imperfections of this guy right so Alexander the Great great man great conqueror but he was not the mighty conqueror I know of another one that without money he conquered death nothing could stop him he went and he took the keys from Satan conquered death and hell and it didn't only stop there he imparted it to you and I that's the difference between Muhammad and all these other ones we there's an empty grave he didn't keep it to himself he made it known to each and every one of so that it would no longer be the hidden gospel so that you would be the gospel you are the good news have to be good news to one another and and finishing here Revelations 10 BC alypsis yes 104 what start four yes and when the seven Thunders uttered their voices I was about to write I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and then probably the most famous scripture in Malachi 45 watch this but in the days of the voice they didn't say the day of the Angel no it is in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery or the unknown should be finished as he had declared to Servants of prophets watch this though this got me here sound when he begins to sound uh yes he sounded son yes he sounded but watch watch sound I sound okay one of the one of the definitions of sound to put into words voice voice right Voice uttered by those seven Thunders watch this and put it up brother so they can read it watch the second one I mean told him I didn't tell him about that one but watch this put into words sound this blew me away sound was to make known the hidden gospel no more to make known and to Proclaim haven't these messages been coming forth from behind this Pulpit have they not been thundering they would always ask and brother Fabio he would preach this many times also brother Tommy and brother ber and they would always say are the Thunders revealed he said yes or no right see you know he says they are revealing the the all I know is that Thunder is the voice of God and all I see is thundering from behind this Pulpit the messages that our pastor has been bringing forth and the ministry they're thundering to me that's all I see is thunder a preparation it's making him know who he is and where he is today and he's thundering today from his throne but his throne was moved to the heart of the believer where is he going to thunder from it's only this it's a dual authentication thou are the Christ th Peter it goes both ways it's she's coming back to him we have to realize the only form of eternal life is God so now if God was manifest In the Flesh Jesus Jesus has come into your flesh and dwells in our flesh that's the only form of eternal life that there is at that day you'll know I am in the father I in you know the scripture how many are still afraid are you still afraid of what's going on out there is there darkness and gloom despair well Eureka we found him you don't have to fear no more there's no there's no need of fear anymore why there's no room for it you may get fright a little bit but don't ever let that fear don't let it take over you push it out push it out by the word the word will always push it out There's No Vacancy for him there's no room for that little Spirit brother Diego there's no room push him out feed him if you feed him and you open your mind to him he gets stronger or it's only an illusion that he's stronger because he has no power amen amen mus come you have fear who has fear who has worry who has anxiety don't feel bad look I'm the I was probably the spokesman for worry always worry always worried about this one always worried about that one what about this what about that brother but I want to give you the opportunity this morning if you have fear or if you have one of the forms of fear lot of people say I'm not afraid of anything but are you anxious do you have depression are you worried I'll tell you this morning you overcame all of that for us he overcame it all for us he is the way he is the truth and he's a life and he's here for you he's here for me don't run away from him don't fight him run too to him run to that strong tower young people I know we always single young people out oh you guys are different and different times yeah but you don't live under that environment you're in a different place you guys you have the message of the hour you're not the same as the world the world is scared the world has fear the world is depressed you don't live there fight it fight it with the word do everything you can you fight it but you can't fight it yourself when you find him when you actually encounter him I'm not talking about we all can read the Bible we come to church and we believe the pastor you haven't found him yet you got to have an experience within yourself that's why God above us people wanted flesh right God had to come in the flesh in Jesus Christ sent his Spirit back didn't stay in spirit form Came In You and I the hidden gospel no longer hidden no longer hidden so there's no reason to fear fear of the unknown should not exist in Malachi 4 amen amen you believe that just a little bit to help you that's my goal I've been there still struggle we fight on we fight on for for each other don't leave no one behind we can't leave no one behind that's unknown that's fear there's something wrong there if we leave our brother and sister behind there's something wrong there you're leaving room for fear you're opening up a door for fear or one of one of his manifestations don't fear don't fear Church it'll scare you it's only to make you alert to the things of God it'll scare you a little bit keep it on your toes get back to the word oh what happened I'm over I'm kind of straining off a little bit get back to the word the only thing I know the only way to combat this is by his word thank you bless [Applause] you reach out and
