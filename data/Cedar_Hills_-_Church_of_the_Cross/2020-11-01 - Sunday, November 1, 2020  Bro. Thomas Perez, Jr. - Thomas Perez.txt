tells us many great great things that god did by the power by by by what he did through the prophet moses some of the greatest stories that you'll ever see but i want to bring it to you tonight in a little ways that you will know that god is with us we have so many infallible words and so many signs that god has given us that at this time in our journey it would actually be a sin to disbelieve god's words [Applause] in the apostolic assembly and truth or consequences new mexico a man that had been in a wheelchair for 18 years comes to my papa's church and he was prayed for and immediately he jumped out he got out of his wheelchair and he rolled it outside now i simply believe that that's god just implemented and [Applause] and this is coming out of one condition into another condition and the lord yesterday tell your neighbor how your neighbor and the lord your neighbor and the lord and the lord healed you and the lord saved you and the lord delivered you and the lord yes how many here have been healed wow there's so out of a bad system pillar and gediya in a column you know i i i i love the lord jesus you almost jesus the first time i saw the pillar of fire now i was 18 years old and i remember my father my father they're praying on the platform i had gone there with my my uncle mike and we flew into the services and when we got there it was my father's turn to preach that they were bringing in people that were on crutches people that that looked like they were paralytics and he he would get their crutches and put it to the sides but i remember that his wife received the holy ghost that night and my father he he preached the message that night tv the holy ghost i tell you in that meeting and i remember you could see the pillar of fire literally going all over the building known but named william merriam brothers that was identified by the pillar of fire typically but he said one thing jesus said one thing in his word a little while something happened to me 18 years old me and miss annual you could see it in such a magnitude until a great man of god that was with brother branham that he had never seen the supernatural outside of the ministry of brother branham till that night i tell you people tonight i tell you that there's a story that says this all the residents in this town were ducks and every sunday the ducks would waddle out of their houses and they would waddle down main street hasta la cayo principal to their church astrolessia they waddle into the sanctuary and they sat in their proper pews correct [Music] i don't know where you were but i was around maybe maybe right there in that pew no in the pews i was in church going to hell that no without went before them even unto the helios not behind them not a trust they just not on the side of them no as to lago before them today wouldn't you like well don't you love it when god tells you you he that you are his no here you find out a great prophet named moses this was a great man of god and up to the age of 40 years old the great minds of egypt those grandest men the great intelligence of egypt a military strategist eventually you're going to go to some church eventually you're eventually going to go to church to go to a wedding or and you've been looking around you see what you can get but all of a sudden your eye changes something that the world cannot for you god had to take him to the back side of the desert you're going to come to church one day and we're saying okay i already know how this works what's this going to sing for another 15 minutes and we're going to go home hour 45 minutes two hours and that's all i can get out of it that has kept you where you have been right now that had never been done before and you're going to see what i'm going to what i'm going to bring you right if you want to look at your work today i have nothing for you only god can give it to you but one day he's working with the sheep and he sees a burning bush that's on fire well it might not be out of the ordinary but it looks back a minute later it's still on fire and it has not been consumed yet now he's got to either go check it out but as he already starts in his mind why did i kill that egyptian why did i did that hurt me something in my heart something told me that what they were doing to us wasn't right one day you're gonna most christians are just just cannot handle a face to face you ever spoken to the devil before diablo face to face have you ever spoken to god before faith have you ever told your problems face to face did you trust those problems that they no longer belong to you have you ever told your condition that's the trauma condition to go back to where it came from have you ever told your bad thoughts as these are just pencils they don't belong to you anymore have you ever told your bad habits that back to where you came because have you ever told the enemy go back to the pits of hell where you've been you know why because one day you're gonna come face to face with study i was going to go and join either the marines or some one of the branches of the military and i and i just said i i just want out i don't care where you know to do because i gotta work for you i need you necesito in so many words hear the word heard the word of the lord something that had been quickened into me when i was a child i've been a preacher since i've been five years old i know nothing else what to do i don't want to know what else to do i love god with all my heart i haven't heard his voice i have seen him face to face he has become a living reality to me [Applause] my father i i carry him his picture in my bible yo cargo el photo my father i remember brother caleb about about ready to finish and if you know my father he's sitting down guess who just walked in i don't know and he showed me his picture of my mama he says there she goes they say i have and she left the building that meeting is going to go down in history as one of the greatest meetings you'll ever see yesterday they bring a little girl they had already dismissed they had brought they brought a little girl that was blind and i and i'm there by my father caleb
