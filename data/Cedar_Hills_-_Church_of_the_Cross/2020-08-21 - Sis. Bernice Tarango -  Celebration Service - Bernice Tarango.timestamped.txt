[32:31] of this tabernacle were dissolved we

[32:36] and house not made with hands eternal in
[32:39] the heavens
[32:41] another translation says for we know
[32:44] that when this earthly tent we live
[32:46] in is taken down that is when we die
[32:51] and leave this earthly body we will have
[32:54] a house in heaven an eternal body made
[32:57] for us
[32:58] by god himself and not by human
[33:02] hands i want us to buy our heads in
[33:05] prayer
[33:06] as we approach the author of this
[33:08] scripture that he give us our daily
[33:10] potion
[33:11] we thank you lord jesus for the bottom
[33:13] of our heart
[33:14] for the opportunity to come to address
[33:17] your children tonight
[33:19] on behalf of sister bernice and father
[33:23] we trust that the words that will be
[33:25] spoken tonight
[33:27] may they bring comfort may they bring
[33:29] faith
[33:30] and may they bring power to the hearts
[33:33] of those that will be
[33:34] receiving them lord we ask that as we
[33:37] surrender
[33:38] to you may you receive the words that
[33:41] have been spoken tonight
[33:43] and may the words of our mouth be
[33:45] acceptable in
[33:46] thy sight oh lord today is what we ask
[33:49] in jesus name we pray amen amen you may
[33:53] be seated
[33:57] first of all we would like to explain
[33:59] express our condolences to
[34:02] sister debbie and sister dar and to
[34:04] brother joey
[34:06] and uh to the grandchildren to the
[34:09] tarango and the
[34:10] de la garcia family and to the friends
[34:13] and the loved ones and
[34:14] and all the the church family that has
[34:17] united here tonight
[34:18] uh to to honor sister
[34:22] bernice we're grateful that in life that
[34:26] we
[34:26] got to know her between me and her i
[34:30] i would call her bernie and
[34:33] it was we we're we're trusting
[34:36] in the lord that what he brings to to us
[34:40] at this time he brings to us his word
[34:44] the bible says that heavens and earth
[34:46] would pass away but that his word
[34:48] would never pass away his word is
[34:51] eternal
[34:52] if it wasn't for this pandemic that we
[34:55] are
[34:56] envisioning today this place would be
[34:59] jam-packed there wouldn't be enough room
[35:01] to fit here because that's
[35:03] the way we all felt about sister bernice
[35:07] and a great great lady in life
[35:10] and always a great christian in life
[35:15] she might not have preached the message
[35:17] from behind this
[35:18] desk but her life did preach volumes
[35:21] of what she believed and where she stood
[35:24] at
[35:25] and to all you that have come to to
[35:27] honor her her
[35:28] her life and and honor her memory and to
[35:32] to to to see the type of person that
[35:36] she not was but is we
[35:39] we understand then we get our trust
[35:42] and our faith from the sacred scriptures
[35:46] i like to at times
[35:50] try to figure out or try to find out
[35:52] what each
[35:53] person's name means and in the biblical
[35:56] names the meaning of the name bernice is
[35:59] one that brings victory
[36:03] we trust
[36:06] that tonight it won't be words that will
[36:10] be
[36:10] vain or repetitious or
[36:14] words that that will bring you just
[36:16] emotion
[36:17] but something that will anchor in your
[36:19] heart that
[36:20] her life will bring you a victory in
[36:23] your life
[36:25] we trust the sacred scriptures
[36:28] that are the the sufficient strength
[36:31] that we need tonight
[36:33] the bible speaks to us for we know
[36:36] and i trust that everybody here knows
[36:39] this
[36:40] we we are here tonight not in a funeral
[36:43] service
[36:44] we are in a going-home celebration
[36:48] i i prayed to the lord that night that
[36:51] they they said that
[36:53] she might be going or didn't look very
[36:56] well
[36:58] but i prayed and i said lord may her
[37:00] mama and me my mama meet her at the gate
[37:04] we do know that when we get go out of
[37:07] this presence
[37:09] we go into another place we do know that
[37:12] for the christian there is no death
[37:17] i don't know how many christians we have
[37:18] here tonight and i know that that
[37:20] that it's difficult to say amen through
[37:23] our masks
[37:24] but i'll say amen for you and with you
[37:27] so that we could
[37:28] understanding and know the the the
[37:30] simplicity of the gospel
[37:32] there is no death to christians
[37:36] the bible says that he that believeth in
[37:38] me though he were dead yet shall he live
[37:41] and brother branham uses the scripture
[37:43] in the message believeth thou
[37:45] this many many times and i i look into
[37:49] the word of god or or sometimes you
[37:51] would would use this
[37:53] the word of god says for we know
[37:57] i i know that many times we sometimes
[38:00] don't know
[38:01] and but we should know the questions to
[38:03] these three questions where do i come
[38:05] from
[38:06] what am i doing here where am i going
[38:10] we should know if we know where we come
[38:12] from we should know where we're going
[38:14] if we know where we come from and we
[38:16] know what we're doing
[38:17] where we're going we should know what
[38:20] we're doing here
[38:21] it is a purpose for us to be here today
[38:24] is not a day to even though it's a sad
[38:27] day
[38:28] even though there will be days that we
[38:29] cry even though there will be days that
[38:32] it seems like there will be no let up in
[38:34] and days that
[38:35] will bring you to a place that you say
[38:38] oh i can't go on any further
[38:40] but once the seed of god that remains
[38:43] inside of our soul
[38:45] kicks in it starts off for we know
[38:50] now i know that right now what god has
[38:53] been doing and has done in your life
[38:55] that whatever he started in your life he
[38:58] is faithful to finish it
[39:00] i do i do understand that where sister
[39:03] bernice
[39:03] is going i do understand where what we
[39:07] should be doing here
[39:08] i don't believe that the word of god was
[39:11] given for us so that we could sit down
[39:13] and take it easy i believe that the word
[39:15] of god comes with purpose
[39:17] i believe it comes with power i believe
[39:19] it comes with authority
[39:20] it comes with responsibility it comes so
[39:23] that the word of god
[39:25] will make a difference from my life to
[39:27] your life
[39:30] we know we know
[39:34] that if our earthly house or this tent
[39:37] were dissolved
[39:39] we have another one waiting for us can
[39:42] you imagine that uh
[39:43] on that day that that she passed on that
[39:47] that they tell me that she her eyes
[39:50] got real big and the biggest smile went
[39:53] across her face
[39:55] knowing that if this body be dissolved
[39:59] we have another one waiting can you
[40:01] imagine a person that's sick and that
[40:04] that that is has suffered for so long
[40:07] looking for what awaits her what awaits
[40:11] us on the other side
[40:13] brother branham would tell us and would
[40:14] describe to us
[40:16] the scene of what was happening on the
[40:18] other side
[40:19] brother branham would tell us about the
[40:21] people the reaction when they would see
[40:23] him
[40:24] on the other side brother branham would
[40:26] tell would
[40:27] would tell us about the testimony that
[40:29] they had
[40:30] about him how he preached to them on
[40:33] this side that propelled them to the
[40:35] other side
[40:37] is a way to god
[40:41] jesus christ spoke speaks to us and says
[40:44] i
[40:44] am the way the truth and the life and no
[40:46] man can come to the father but by me
[40:50] sister bernice found that way she found
[40:53] that path
[40:54] she found that life she found the truth
[40:58] and the truth made her free
[41:02] they said that as she was going days
[41:06] before
[41:06] she was already planning this trip she
[41:09] told our pastor you want to go with me
[41:12] on this trip i'm going to go see my mama
[41:15] they say that she recognized and was
[41:18] talking to people on the other side
[41:20] as she's on this side there is a place
[41:23] and i want everybody to understand this
[41:26] tonight
[41:27] there is a place that is more real than
[41:30] this place there is a place
[41:34] that is eternal there is a place that
[41:37] awaits us
[41:39] there is a glory that we have never
[41:41] experienced before
[41:43] even as tremendous as we say we are
[41:48] but that glory wants to
[41:51] come like a a coat or wants to come
[41:55] like a body and wants to dress us within
[41:58] without
[41:59] and upon that we might know what we
[42:03] are we see ourselves here today and
[42:07] i i see myself many times and as we get
[42:10] older and we get
[42:11] we get more wrinkles that just shows us
[42:14] that that we're going someplace
[42:17] but we know that if this building
[42:24] if this tent
[42:28] you can't even imagine the joy
[42:31] we can't even imagine the joy when god
[42:34] starts calling you
[42:36] me not till my time
[42:39] but me is it my time and when she could
[42:43] no
[42:43] longer walk no more all of a sudden on
[42:46] that side
[42:47] a foot stepped over into the glory land
[42:53] we know that if this body be dissolved
[42:57] we have another one waiting for us
[43:00] that's the joy of the christian that's
[43:03] the joy
[43:04] of the people that have understood what
[43:08] we have received in this last time
[43:10] what we received in our time was the
[43:13] eternal thoughts of god translated
[43:17] through the mouth of a prophet
[43:19] believed in the hearts of believer and
[43:21] acted upon
[43:23] here on this earth what a wonderful
[43:26] thing
[43:27] it is to know where i come from
[43:30] brother branham speaks to us many many
[43:33] things
[43:35] and i do want you to know that every
[43:37] time we have a great
[43:38] service we get a little bit of
[43:41] jubilation in our heart you know what
[43:43] that jubilation is
[43:45] it's where our our representation is
[43:47] just getting getting started
[43:49] you just started every time you raise up
[43:51] your hands every time you glorify
[43:54] you god there is your representation
[43:56] there's your angel on the other side
[43:58] doing the same thing
[44:00] you know why because he knows that
[44:03] there it this is just a little bit of
[44:05] time that we're going to stay here
[44:08] we we ourselves understand and i
[44:11] was talking to my my wife one day
[44:15] and i i said you know it's been 24 years
[44:18] that my mama passed
[44:20] away and i i said
[44:23] it seems like a long time
[44:26] but but for them it's not long it's just
[44:29] like
[44:30] oh there you are
[44:35] sometimes we get get afraid of death
[44:40] and we say this virus might get us and
[44:42] we might die
[44:44] we are all going to die of something
[44:49] the question is is what condition are we
[44:52] going to be in when we die
[44:56] in understanding this then you
[44:59] understand
[45:00] the word of god and brother branham
[45:03] would speak to us
[45:04] but you've got to use faith in god to
[45:07] make it work
[45:10] see so you got your own resurrection
[45:14] inside of you
[45:18] now now this is enough to make the dead
[45:21] raise
[45:23] do you know that jesus never attended a
[45:25] funeral
[45:29] i'm going to say it again you know that
[45:31] jesus never attended a funeral
[45:34] you know why he is the resurrection
[45:38] and the life that's why today we don't
[45:42] celebrate a funeral
[45:44] it's we celebrate a going-home time
[45:48] this is a time when we dismiss ourselves
[45:51] and she dismisses herself from us
[45:54] and enters into that place where she was
[45:57] destined to be
[45:59] so you got your own resurrection inside
[46:01] of you
[46:02] your resurrection lays inside of you
[46:06] in your spirit now when jesus
[46:09] died on the cross his soul descended
[46:12] into hell
[46:13] and preached to the souls that were
[46:15] imprisoned that repented not
[46:17] in the long-suffering days of noah
[46:20] his body went to the grave but before he
[46:23] died
[46:24] he committed his spirit into the hands
[46:26] of god
[46:27] into thy hands command my spirit
[46:30] so you see his spirit went to god his
[46:34] soul went to hell
[46:35] his body went to the grave now
[46:38] that spirit that was in him
[46:42] was the spirit of god the bible says
[46:46] if the same spirit that raised christ
[46:49] from the dead
[46:50] dwell in you he that raised christ from
[46:53] the dead
[46:54] will also quicken your mortal bodies
[46:59] now christ could not come back until
[47:03] three days
[47:04] was fulfilled you know there was
[47:07] scriptures
[47:08] as you have heard our pastor say that
[47:11] kept him in the grave
[47:14] there were scriptures that kept him in
[47:16] the grave until everything would be
[47:17] fulfilled
[47:19] there are things that have to still be
[47:21] fulfilled
[47:22] until we see our sister bernice again
[47:25] but again
[47:26] it won't be long brother joey it'll be
[47:28] like
[47:29] oh hi
[47:33] nice to see you
[47:37] there must have been a great
[47:38] announcement that day she died
[47:41] that she went to be with the lord
[47:46] we don't know but if i were to say this
[47:51] i would say the angels started
[47:54] gathering around and and they started
[47:57] harmonizing
[48:00] and i would say that the trumpeteer
[48:02] started playing
[48:04] and i would say that the band started
[48:07] making music and i believe that a strong
[48:11] angel
[48:11] stood up and said sister bernice is
[48:14] coming home
[48:21] why do we believe such a thing
[48:24] because we've had a prophet go to the
[48:27] other side
[48:28] and tell us children we can now go over
[48:31] it is safe to go over
[48:34] [Music]
[48:36] for the nominal believer that believes
[48:38] in their church they don't have that
[48:40] assuredness for a per
[48:43] person that that reads but does nothing
[48:46] about what they read they don't have
[48:48] that assuredness
[48:50] for a preacher like myself that might
[48:53] believe god in one thing but maybe not
[48:56] in the other
[48:59] does not have that assurance
[49:02] but when you have the assurance like i
[49:05] have and like you have
[49:08] we can say but we know
[49:12] but we know but we know
[49:15] but we know if sister bernice was
[49:17] hearing body i'd say but we know
[49:21] that if this earthly body be dissolved
[49:24] we have another one waiting
[49:30] why do we believe such a thing
[49:35] because our soul has had contact with
[49:38] the other side
[49:41] and when our soul gets contacted to the
[49:44] other side
[49:44] it anoints us it inspires us
[49:51] and it gives us something in our heart
[49:55] that is a guarantee
[49:58] gives us as our pastor says the title
[50:01] deed
[50:05] when you got a title d to a piece of
[50:07] property
[50:10] that property is yours
[50:13] when you have the abstract title deed of
[50:16] it that has been
[50:17] checked on it to make sure there's no
[50:19] liens
[50:21] that property is yours and that's what
[50:24] we've done
[50:25] tonight we've checked on this property
[50:29] of god this piece of ground
[50:31] that god had let us have for 52 years
[50:36] and during this time the abstract title
[50:39] deed of her life was taken all the way
[50:41] back
[50:49] and when it was taken all the way back
[50:51] they found out
[50:52] there was no liens on her
[50:56] you know why one day i was guilty
[51:00] of all the charges
[51:03] doomed with sin and disgrace
[51:07] but then a man by his grace
[51:10] stood up and he said i dropped the
[51:13] charges
[51:16] you can't imagine what it is when a man
[51:19] or a woman
[51:20] get a hold of god and you find out that
[51:23] what you did
[51:25] it's not counted to you no more
[51:30] your life before over here might have
[51:33] been a mess
[51:34] i'm talking about hours not hers hours
[51:37] might have been a mess over here but
[51:39] jesus dropped the charges over here
[51:42] i was guilty i was guilty i was gonna go
[51:45] to hell
[51:46] i didn't have a hope i didn't have a
[51:47] resurrection but all of a sudden
[51:50] i received the life of god the seed of
[51:53] god inside of me
[51:54] now resurrection lays within me
[52:01] that's eternal life
[52:04] he said i have power to lay my life down
[52:09] i have power to take it back up again
[52:14] i got power to lay my life down
[52:18] i have power to take it back up again
[52:21] again i have power to lay my life down
[52:24] that's what jesus said i also have power
[52:28] to resurrect myself out of the grave
[52:34] now the prophet of god says this to us
[52:41] now each one of you have power
[52:45] the same way
[52:51] i'm going to tell you again this is a
[52:52] going home celebration
[52:54] again this is a going home celebration
[52:58] this is not a time to mourn even though
[53:00] we will mourn and have already mourned
[53:02] and we'll mourn every every time ours
[53:05] but the bible says
[53:06] that we don't suffer or we don't grieve
[53:08] as people
[53:09] that have no hope we know whom we have
[53:13] believed
[53:14] in we will cry as humans but as
[53:17] people of god and people of promise
[53:21] we say grave where is your sting
[53:25] oh death where is your sting all grave
[53:29] where is your victory
[53:32] you know why each one of us
[53:35] has the same power
[53:40] you know i saw
[53:44] something one day and the lady told the
[53:47] man
[53:48] if there's nothing outside out in the
[53:50] solar system
[53:51] that's a whole lot of wasted space
[53:56] i'd like to say tonight that if brother
[53:58] branham came to bring this
[54:00] message which he did and it came from
[54:02] the back part of the mind of god
[54:04] the eternal thoughts transmitted to us
[54:07] and we don't do nothing about it
[54:09] what a waste of a message
[54:12] but i do not believe that god wastes
[54:15] anything
[54:16] i believe that the word has got to
[54:19] produce
[54:20] the effect and the effect of it is what
[54:23] paul
[54:23] speaks to us that i may know him in the
[54:26] power of his resurrection
[54:29] why is it he understood this scripture
[54:33] if christ be preached that he rose not
[54:38] or that he rose from the dead i'll
[54:41] say some among you that there is no
[54:43] resurrection of the dead
[54:46] but if there be no resurrection of the
[54:49] dead
[54:50] then is christ not risen
[54:53] and if christ be not risen then is our
[54:57] preaching in vain
[54:59] and your faith is also vain yea
[55:02] you are foul false witnesses of god
[55:04] because we have
[55:05] testified of god that he raised up
[55:08] christ
[55:08] whom he raised not up if so be that the
[55:13] dead rise not
[55:15] for if the dead rise not then it's
[55:19] then is not christ race
[55:22] this is where we put ourselves today
[55:25] sister bernice
[55:26] is right here if she doesn't raise up
[55:30] christ didn't raise up
[55:36] again if she doesn't raise up
[55:39] christ didn't raise up but the only
[55:42] reason that she's going to raise is
[55:44] because
[55:44] christ raised up from the dead but how
[55:47] is it that
[55:48] many people say that he rose not from
[55:50] the dead
[55:51] why because they don't understand the
[55:54] understanding of the scriptures
[55:56] and if christ be not raised your faith
[55:59] is vain
[56:00] ye are yet in your sins then they also
[56:04] which are
[56:04] falling asleep in christ are perished
[56:08] but then he says but now is christ
[56:11] risen this is this this is what the
[56:14] apostle paul tells us all the
[56:16] all the time and he says this and this
[56:18] is the way i always read it
[56:20] that christ raised the third day
[56:22] according to my gospel he would say this
[56:25] how is it that in understanding
[56:29] the power of the resurrection that you
[56:32] must understand
[56:34] where we must understand where we are
[56:37] at in that resurrection when i look at
[56:41] myself
[56:42] and things that i might i might do
[56:44] things that i might not be pleasing to
[56:46] god
[56:47] i shake my head i get disappointed
[56:51] and i think about what he did for me
[56:54] the greatest thing that he did and this
[56:57] is something that i can never ever take
[57:00] out of my mind and about my spirit and
[57:02] out of my soul
[57:04] is how that the god of glory descended
[57:08] to my estate
[57:11] and the spirit that had no flesh
[57:15] took on flesh and he stepped
[57:19] the eternal step into time
[57:23] and when he stepped into time he started
[57:26] suffering like you and i
[57:28] in understanding those things he said
[57:31] yet a little while and the world will
[57:33] see me no more but you shall see me
[57:35] for i will be with you even in you until
[57:37] the end of the age what
[57:38] had happened eternity now steps inside
[57:42] of the believer
[57:46] again eternity now steps inside of the
[57:50] believer
[57:50] how is that for god so loved the world
[57:55] that he gave his only begotten son that
[57:58] whosoever believeth in him
[57:59] should not perish but have everlasting
[58:02] or eternal life
[58:03] that eternal life is deposited into the
[58:07] heart and the soul
[58:08] of the person that believes god's word
[58:11] and when it does
[58:12] it anchors there
[58:15] when i want to do something bad it pulls
[58:18] me
[58:21] now if you can go ahead and do it
[58:22] there's nothing that's holding you
[58:23] there's no representation
[58:25] but when i want to do good paul says
[58:27] evil is present
[58:28] and it keeps on pulling me and it keeps
[58:30] on pulling me you know why
[58:32] there is something that makes you rise
[58:35] up from your condition
[58:38] do you know that the word of god and the
[58:41] spirit of god
[58:42] inside of the believer will make you
[58:45] rise above sin
[58:50] you don't have to sin the word of god
[58:53] picks you up into another level
[58:57] picks you up into another place
[59:00] and it takes you into heavenly places in
[59:02] christ jesus
[59:04] and when it does then death becomes just
[59:07] a vehicle
[59:08] to take me to take you to the presence
[59:11] of god
[59:12] and when death comes around and it's
[59:15] your time to go home
[59:16] you hitch him up and you say come on
[59:19] death
[59:20] take me to where i gotta go to now
[59:23] you know why because death to a believer
[59:28] doesn't mean nothing it's just a vehicle
[59:31] to take us where we should be
[59:33] i look at myself
[59:36] and i look at people around us
[59:40] and i say each one of you have the same
[59:43] power the same way
[59:45] because you are sons and daughters of
[59:48] god
[59:49] and the very spirit that's in you this
[59:52] morning
[59:52] the holy spirit that's in you this
[59:55] morning that
[59:56] same holy spirit will raise you up
[1:00:03] we think it's going to be a different
[1:00:06] thing
[1:00:06] than what we possess
[1:00:10] there is enough power when we are born
[1:00:14] again inside of you to go and create
[1:00:17] a new world
[1:00:21] you say how is it listen there are
[1:00:24] people over here that are going to be
[1:00:25] drinking and they're going to be doing
[1:00:27] drugs and they're going to be doing all
[1:00:28] kinds of
[1:00:29] immoral things i don't do that i live in
[1:00:32] another world
[1:00:35] i don't belong to this cosmos i don't
[1:00:39] belong to this place
[1:00:41] i live here i'm passing through why is
[1:00:43] it that so many of us
[1:00:44] christians get stuck and we think we're
[1:00:46] going to be here forever
[1:00:48] when the bible says that we're pilgrims
[1:00:51] and strangers we're just
[1:00:52] what is a pilgrim and a stranger he's
[1:00:54] just passing through
[1:00:57] now i know we need to live i know we
[1:01:00] need to make
[1:01:01] a living i know we need to do this or
[1:01:03] that
[1:01:04] but in in ourselves we're just passing
[1:01:07] through
[1:01:08] here you find the richest man in the
[1:01:11] bible
[1:01:12] abraham and he was still passing through
[1:01:17] you find a man that had need of nothing
[1:01:19] and he was still passing through he was
[1:01:21] still looking
[1:01:22] for a city what was the city
[1:01:26] going to be he said the city was going
[1:01:28] to be
[1:01:29] whose builder and maker was god
[1:01:32] and he started looking for it started
[1:01:35] looking
[1:01:36] it seemed like he didn't find what he
[1:01:40] was looking for
[1:01:42] but the promise was that in your seed
[1:01:46] shall all the nations of the earth be
[1:01:48] blessed
[1:01:50] where is the promise then it's in your
[1:01:53] seed
[1:01:54] where is your healing at it's in your
[1:01:56] seed
[1:01:57] where is your deliverance is in your
[1:01:59] seed where is your restoration of your
[1:02:02] family
[1:02:02] it's in your seed where is the
[1:02:05] resurrection
[1:02:06] that'll pick you up one of these days
[1:02:08] it's in your seed
[1:02:11] it's got the power in itself to pick you
[1:02:15] up
[1:02:15] and present you alive before him
[1:02:19] what happens abraham had a son
[1:02:23] named isaac and according to the flesh
[1:02:25] that was the promise
[1:02:27] according to the spirit that was not the
[1:02:29] promise
[1:02:30] so he was still looking until a man
[1:02:33] until a man
[1:02:34] named jesus christ said i'm the son of
[1:02:36] abraham i am the royal
[1:02:38] seed of abraham now you and i being
[1:02:41] counted dead
[1:02:43] to sin we become abraham's seed and then
[1:02:46] are now heirs according to the promise
[1:02:50] and what is the promise we know
[1:02:59] sister bernice she's around here
[1:03:04] she's around here it's just been her
[1:03:07] body just
[1:03:08] was let let loose that spirit
[1:03:11] just just let loose release that body
[1:03:14] but she's around here
[1:03:16] sister bernice for we know
[1:03:21] you that maybe we have come to church
[1:03:26] i'm about ready to to to finish now
[1:03:29] then we come to church time and in time
[1:03:31] out and nothing ever changes
[1:03:34] and we might come and we might read
[1:03:37] something
[1:03:38] and we might feel good for a moment but
[1:03:40] nothing really ever changes
[1:03:44] you get to the point of understanding
[1:03:47] of we know
[1:03:51] it's the same thing in the beginning
[1:03:53] when god said let us make man
[1:03:56] and when your representative meets you
[1:03:58] face to face and you see him
[1:04:00] you so you say we know
[1:04:05] again again again let us make man in the
[1:04:08] in
[1:04:08] in our image and when you're represented
[1:04:11] if your angel
[1:04:13] comes to you and you see him we know
[1:04:16] we know without a shadow of a doubt that
[1:04:19] if this earthly tabernacle
[1:04:21] this tent where we dwell in be dissolved
[1:04:26] we have another one
[1:04:30] you know death to a christian
[1:04:34] is not death death to a christian is the
[1:04:38] vehicle
[1:04:38] to take you into the presence of god
[1:04:41] come on take me
[1:04:43] that's where i need to be one of these
[1:04:47] days
[1:04:49] one of these days brother branham would
[1:04:52] speak to us you have the power in you
[1:04:55] now to do that
[1:04:56] but that power that you have in you now
[1:05:00] could make a new world
[1:05:05] imagine children screaming
[1:05:09] wife screaming husband screaming
[1:05:12] everybody out of control
[1:05:16] you know when the devil messes with me
[1:05:18] at night i said so now you want to hear
[1:05:20] him don't you
[1:05:22] and i put on the tape of brother branham
[1:05:25] he runs for his life
[1:05:30] you know why that's the voice of god
[1:05:34] so he runs for his life but i want you
[1:05:37] to notice that when any time
[1:05:39] you get into a bind just look to see
[1:05:42] what's inside of you
[1:05:44] and when you look to see what's inside
[1:05:46] of you
[1:05:47] that's the greatest treasure that has
[1:05:49] been hidden
[1:05:50] it's now hidden in earthen vessels those
[1:05:53] people that have believed and have taken
[1:05:56] god at his word
[1:05:57] and say to the dust i will not surrender
[1:06:01] to the dust they may take my body
[1:06:05] but they'll never take my spirit they
[1:06:08] might take my body to the grave
[1:06:11] but they'll never take my soul they'll
[1:06:14] never
[1:06:14] take that part of god that he has placed
[1:06:17] inside of me by the baptism
[1:06:19] of the holy ghost
[1:06:22] assuredness
[1:06:26] let me tell you very few people
[1:06:29] can say this let us say this tonight
[1:06:37] indeed
[1:06:41] indeed the abstract title
[1:06:44] deed was traced back
[1:06:51] and today sister bernice
[1:06:56] going to your brand new home tomorrow
[1:06:59] after we place you down in the ground
[1:07:03] you'll be taking that flight what a day
[1:07:06] of liberation
[1:07:10] if you could see where she's going you
[1:07:12] wouldn't be sad
[1:07:14] i know you're going to be sad because
[1:07:16] you're her family and your friend and
[1:07:17] you're
[1:07:18] the loved ones but if you could see with
[1:07:20] your spiritual eyes where she's going
[1:07:22] you would feel sad for yourself
[1:07:26] oh she's there no no more wheelchair
[1:07:30] no more cancer this is a day of sweet
[1:07:34] release
[1:07:36] this is a day that i've been waiting for
[1:07:38] my whole life
[1:07:41] is when the title deed has been cleared
[1:07:47] and when it's cleared oh praise his name
[1:07:52] glory to the land of lamb of god that
[1:07:55] takes away the sin of the world
[1:08:00] for we know
[1:08:04] we know this is the difference between
[1:08:07] religion
[1:08:08] and relationship this is different
[1:08:11] between
[1:08:11] church and knowing god and the power of
[1:08:14] his resurrection
[1:08:15] this is the difference between knowing a
[1:08:17] creed and a dogma
[1:08:19] and knowing him and to know him as life
[1:08:27] so as we're in our bodies sad to see her
[1:08:31] go
[1:08:34] i know a few people that are happy to
[1:08:37] welcome her home
[1:08:40] and the angels lined up and the choir
[1:08:44] started singing
[1:08:45] and the announcement says sister bernice
[1:08:48] is coming home
[1:08:50] and everyone in heaven stood up welcome
[1:08:53] home
[1:08:58] this is a going-home celebration
[1:09:02] you know why brother branham and i will
[1:09:05] finish
[1:09:07] i am sure lord if this little church
[1:09:09] this morning could look past the curtain
[1:09:12] not an affliction among them mr dyer
[1:09:15] brother joey mr debbie
[1:09:18] brothers and sisters not an affliction
[1:09:20] among them
[1:09:21] there never could be not a sickness
[1:09:25] nothing but perfection
[1:09:30] and it's just one breath
[1:09:34] between here and there
[1:09:38] from old age to youth
[1:09:42] from time to eternity
[1:09:45] from a weary of tomorrow and a sorrow of
[1:09:49] yesterday
[1:09:50] till the present time of eternity
[1:09:53] in perfection
[1:09:57] sister bernice if i could echo the words
[1:10:01] of our lord jesus christ welcome home

[1:30:12] for a lady that didn't like pictures
[1:30:16] my goodness she had a lot of pictures
[1:30:19] amen
[1:30:20] we uh we uh had offered um
[1:30:23] uh everyone who felt it in their heart
[1:30:27] to say something
[1:30:28] uh there was a few of you that uh a few
[1:30:30] of us that
[1:30:31] sent out a recording so we want to play
[1:30:34] those at this time
[1:30:49] this is brother william ellis i'd just
[1:30:52] like to
[1:30:53] first offer my condolences to the
[1:30:55] tarango
[1:30:56] de la carsa perez family
[1:31:00] for their loss that they have had and
[1:31:03] she was a very special
[1:31:06] young lady as i can remember she was
[1:31:09] always wanting to sing in church and she
[1:31:12] loved church
[1:31:14] she loved to help with the choir
[1:31:18] and i remember when they lost their
[1:31:22] their father at such a very young age
[1:31:25] and through that they still held on
[1:31:28] strong
[1:31:30] a word that they believed and then
[1:31:33] we went and accepted the message
[1:31:36] and since then she's been a message
[1:31:39] believer
[1:31:40] she's embraced it with all of her heart
[1:31:44] and i know that she's had a hard time in
[1:31:47] life
[1:31:48] i know she suffered the last two years
[1:31:52] but she was left as a single mom and
[1:31:55] even like that
[1:31:57] she raised her kids in the admonition of
[1:31:59] god
[1:32:01] she loved the lord with all her heart
[1:32:06] and the children should be very proud of
[1:32:09] their mother
[1:32:10] for being such a lady
[1:32:13] and bringing them to this message
[1:32:17] and uh just to let you know that soon
[1:32:20] and very soon we're going to be able to
[1:32:23] to meet up with her again either will be
[1:32:26] taken up in the rapture or we'll have to
[1:32:28] go by way of the grave
[1:32:30] but don't fear the grave
[1:32:34] because it's just a stepping stone
[1:32:38] to go to a different dimension and
[1:32:41] she's there and she's no longer in pain
[1:32:45] and we're just so happy that we had a
[1:32:48] chance to
[1:32:50] know sister bernice such a special
[1:32:53] special lady
[1:32:54] thank you

[1:38:02] married i loved to text her we became
[1:38:04] good friends
[1:38:06] sitting at her house till two in the
[1:38:07] morning drinking coffee
[1:38:09] she always made you feel so loved and at
[1:38:11] home
[1:38:12] one time david and i were there pretty
[1:38:14] late it ended in us spending the night
[1:38:17] she insisted we just stayed it was so
[1:38:19] late and that in the morning she would
[1:38:20] make us breakfast
[1:38:22] so she threw joey out of his bed and no
[1:38:24] doubt
[1:38:25] in the morning she was there making
[1:38:27] breakfast no matter what she always made
[1:38:30] you feel like that
[1:38:31] she would try and serve you even in her
[1:38:32] wheelchair she would
[1:38:34] try and get you something to drink and
[1:38:36] that's just who she was she always made
[1:38:38] you feel like you were one of her own
[1:38:41] another time when i was before i got
[1:38:44] married
[1:38:45] she had invited my parents over for
[1:38:47] dinner and
[1:38:48] doodle and i had gotten in an argument
[1:38:50] before we got there and i knew i didn't
[1:38:52] want to get down because
[1:38:53] bernice was going to joke and laugh
[1:38:55] about it so i stayed in the car for a
[1:38:57] little bit
[1:38:58] well within two minutes there she was
[1:39:01] calling my phone
[1:39:02] saying girl are you gonna get down are

[1:43:38] [Applause]
[1:43:45] you know mom never
[1:43:49] wanted anything fancy
[1:43:53] those two words were never in the same
[1:43:55] sentence together
[1:43:57] she always kept it simple
[1:44:01] everything she did was just simple
[1:44:04] i remember meeting her for the first
[1:44:07] time
[1:44:09] and getting to know her i was 16 years
[1:44:11] old
[1:44:13] and
[1:44:16] and she had the same part down her
[1:44:19] middle of her
[1:44:20] head and 24 years later she still had
[1:44:25] the same part
[1:44:27] when she saw something good she didn't
[1:44:29] want to change it
[1:44:32] she always wanted to be happy she always
[1:44:35] she said
[1:44:36] make sure make sure that in my funeral
[1:44:42] she said i don't want to have anybody
[1:44:44] crying
[1:44:46] please don't play those slow songs
[1:44:50] i don't want depressing songs in my
[1:44:52] funeral
[1:44:53] i want fast songs i want songs of joy
[1:44:59] i want i want people to be happy i want
[1:45:01] people to know
[1:45:03] that that where i'm going
[1:45:06] it's not a sad depressing place
[1:45:10] but a place of just happiness
[1:45:14] you know in in life
[1:45:19] we are blessed if we have one great
[1:45:21] mother
[1:45:23] so blessed
[1:45:26] but god saw it fit in my life
[1:45:30] to bless me with two beautiful mothers
[1:45:37] she wasn't my mother-in-law not for a
[1:45:40] minute
[1:45:41] she was my mom she was my mom
[1:45:45] is what i would call her
[1:45:49] and she she made three beautiful
[1:45:52] children
[1:45:53] that i love so dearly
[1:45:57] and i'm thankful for the decision
[1:46:00] the choice she made years ago
[1:46:04] to leave a place in phoenix
[1:46:09] and to follow a man that she barely knew
[1:46:14] and that was my father to have enough
[1:46:18] revelation
[1:46:19] to go to a place where god would bless
[1:46:23] her
[1:46:25] knowing the hardships that she had in
[1:46:26] life did she have it easy
[1:46:29] not not even close did she have a lot of
[1:46:33] things on this earth
[1:46:36] as far as material wise nothing
[1:46:42] but what she had was something so much
[1:46:44] greater
[1:46:46] she had a love for people and every
[1:46:50] everyone i talked to they say the same
[1:46:53] thing
[1:46:54] over and over when they made bernie
[1:46:58] when god made burning he sure broke the
[1:47:01] mold
[1:47:03] and i i say that is that is for sure
[1:47:07] he sure did but i'm so appreciative
[1:47:12] of what stan she has made for the gospel
[1:47:16] a stand where it doesn't matter who was
[1:47:18] against her
[1:47:19] whether it was family whether it was
[1:47:21] anybody whoever it might have been
[1:47:26] but she made a stand for the gospel
[1:47:29] and my what a stand that was
[1:47:32] and seeing the last few days of her life
[1:47:38] you know it was something when when my
[1:47:39] brother tommy said
[1:47:41] what her name meant victory
[1:47:49] we were at the bedside before she passed
[1:47:52] away
[1:47:54] my wife was on the right hand side i was
[1:47:56] on the left hand side
[1:47:58] joey was on near the feet dar was on the
[1:48:02] other side
[1:48:03] of her feet and as
[1:48:06] she gave her last breaths
[1:48:11] you know in in life you don't get to see
[1:48:14] you don't get to see this i might not
[1:48:17] ever see
[1:48:18] this ever again in my life
[1:48:23] but from someone who was battling
[1:48:27] with everything that she had
[1:48:30] someone who was fighting fighting to get
[1:48:33] to heaven
[1:48:35] i tell you the look of her for the last
[1:48:38] couple days after she got out of the
[1:48:40] hospital was she was just
[1:48:41] fighting over and over
[1:48:45] and to see her face
[1:48:49] her body
[1:48:52] turn from fighting
[1:48:59] to eyes that were were shut
[1:49:03] most of the day but that opened
[1:49:07] so wide i tell you it wasn't it wasn't
[1:49:10] something that i
[1:49:11] that i uh that i just thought of or
[1:49:16] or made up but the room
[1:49:20] just filled with light
[1:49:23] as she opened her eyes they got so large
[1:49:31] and the lady that was fighting finally
[1:49:33] gave
[1:49:34] a smile that oh my goodness
[1:49:40] talking about lighting it it didn't
[1:49:42] light up a room
[1:49:44] it lit up your life it lit up your soul
[1:49:49] to see someone so
[1:49:54] so sure of where she was going
[1:49:59] of where she was at of who she saw
