thank you for our pastor thank you for every person that is here tonight those that are online those that may be in the fellowship hall those that may hear this later may they receive exactly what they came forward amen if you can turn to your bible to the book of esther i am not going to spend or take much of your time today i i do want to to tell you what god has given us the book of esther chapter 4 and verse 13 through 14. and you're going to read it in your scofield bibles in the in the in the king james version but to save time i'm going to read it right from the new american standard bible reporter then mordecai told them to reply to esther do not imagine that you in the king's palace can escape any more than all the jews for if you remain silent at this time relief and deliverance will arise for the jews from another place and you and your father's house will perish and who knows whether you have not obtained royalty for such a time as this and i want the lord if he would be so kind with us tonight to add his blessings and you you find i i i would would you you find out the story of how she became queen and you find out and you can translate your whole life on how you became royalty we are all in here according to scripture we are kings and priests we are called mrs lord jesus christ we are in in his kingdom we are a we are we are royalty we are the queen and there is only one king of kings and lord of lords when you hear a word like we heard this morning like we were heard last sunday and when you hear them on sundays you hear the minister and you hear brother abraham you hear the different other ministries you speak to us that's not just information for us something that has to change our lives something that's got to change our way of thinking and everything that we understand we have come to the place that we are all royalties we have come to this to this wonderful message this message has given us the capacity to understand all mysteries and he keeps on going and he keeps on going and he keeps on going step it is a ladder it is a step to god it is a stairway to heaven so we know all about what we are supposed to do but each step brings new responsibilities each step brings a new responsibility into our lives and when you find yourself and you are come to the place of understanding you find yourself that you are now in the house of the king and you think that you've that we have accomplished what we have set out for and we are royalty some people might might look at me chosen unelected people in pueblo i see i see a a royal priesthood i see you at a place where where you are sitting now in heavenly places in christ at times we forget where god rescued us when you understand where you came from and it does not have that same quickening in you you know what more than all the jews because there's a sentence for your life there's a person that wants to kill you there's a there's a warrant out to kill you there's but jesus christ comes to us and he says the devil comes to kill to steal and to destroy but i have come that you might have life and not more abundantly i'm very proud to call him my father i'm very proud to call my brother my pastor i'm very proud to call brother william my brother happy to be there brother i'm [Applause] that there is a decree that was given and the degree that was given is that anybody that was a jew was going to be put to death at a certain time we ourselves have got to know that the time that we are living in that is a meant for destruction during all taste the this when the bride of jesus christ gather more now than ever before you know why we were born for this time boom there is two options to be able to give people aidos and that is life or death yes we choose to give you life we want you to then go and give life to somebody else deliverance whether you have not obtained royalty for such a time as this this is the most terrible time of all ages to live in but according to scripture this is the greatest time to live according to the world we're in a pandemic according to christ this is an opportunity according to the world it is all corrupting chaos but according to christ i have elected you in you know if you would have asked any sage and any prophet of the old testament which time they wanted to live brother jacob they would all have chosen this time you know you you you read in the bible where they were son of sander they they were killed they cannot be made what the perfect interpretation is the perfect interpretation of the
