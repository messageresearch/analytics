[2:52] and uh now we're going to try tonight by
[2:55] the grace of god to take
[2:57] this fourth seal and um
[3:01] see what the holy spirit will have to
[3:03] say to us in it
[3:05] now i'm going to read that uh revelation
[3:08] is the sixth chapter
[3:10] and beginning with the seventh verse
[3:14] seventh and eighth there's always two
[3:15] verses the first is the announcement
[3:18] and the second verse is what he saw
[3:21] and when he had opened the fourth seal i
[3:25] heard the voice of the force
[3:27] forth be say come and see and i'll look
[3:31] and behold a pale
[3:32] horse and his name that set on him
[3:37] that said was
[3:40] was death and hell followed him and
[3:44] power was given unto them
[3:47] over the four parts of the earth to kill
[3:49] with the sword
[3:50] and with hunger and with death and with
[3:53] beasts of the
[3:54] earth and um the fourth
[3:57] beast the living creature like an eagle
[4:00] said to john come see what the
[4:04] fourth mystery of the
[4:08] plan of redemption has been hid in this
[4:10] book
[4:11] and he said come and see the fourth
[4:13] mystery
[4:14] of the book of redemption that's been
[4:17] hidden in this book come
[4:18] see and john
[4:21] went to sea and he saw a
[4:24] pale horse and
[4:28] again the same writer upon this pale
[4:31] horse
[4:32] now he has a name
[4:36] called death now notice
[4:40] none of the other rider none of the
[4:42] other horses
[4:44] or no time that this rider ever ruled
[4:46] they didn't have that man had no name
[4:50] but now he is called death
[4:54] it's not mentioned he's revealed now
[4:58] what he is his death but now when comes
[5:02] forth the eagle age
[5:04] that's the one that god always likens
[5:07] his prophets to eagles
[5:08] he calls himself an eagle the eagle goes
[5:11] so high
[5:12] ain't nothing else can touch him not
[5:15] only is he up there but he's built for
[5:16] that position
[5:17] when he gets up right you see where he's
[5:19] at 68
[5:21] million protestants as we talk from
[5:24] from uh smucker's uh uh glorious reform
[5:28] the or the mortality of rome last night
[5:32] we find that
[5:33] up to the 1500 mark i believe it was or
[5:36] 18 i don't remember exactly now
[5:38] but it was 68
[5:41] million put to death to protest
[5:45] the first roman church
[5:48] oh no wonder he could in person now
[5:51] himself
[5:52] in the persified uh name of
[5:55] and call death he sure was
[5:59] now god only knows how many he
[6:03] calls to spiritually die by his
[6:06] anti-bible word teaching
[6:09] this is the one he put 68 million to the
[6:11] sword and killed
[6:13] and probably literally billions
[6:17] died spiritually on his false teaching
[6:21] no wonder you think the name of death
[6:24] the fourth stage
[6:25] of his ministry is called the beast
[6:30] and in this fourth horse if you'll
[6:33] notice
[6:34] all the first one was white
[6:37] and then the next one was red and the
[6:40] next one was black
[6:42] and the fourth one all of these other
[6:45] three was representing it because pale
[6:48] is red and and uh white
[6:51] and still mixed together see it
[6:54] it is all mixed in this one horse
[6:58] i want you to notice the four of them
[7:00] notice the off
[7:02] mark of four of the spiritual
[7:04] mathematics
[7:06] god is threes this is four
[7:10] he's in four here first antichrist
[7:13] white second false prophet
[7:17] red third biker of heavens and earth
[7:21] and purgatory black for the beast pale
[7:24] horse
[7:25] satan be kicked out of heaven if you
[7:27] want to read that
[7:28] revelations 12 and 13.
[7:32] satan being kicked out of heaven then in
[7:34] revelation 13 1
[7:35] 8 he is incarnate in the person of the
[7:39] beast
[7:41] he spurs the antichrist yes it's the
[7:44] teaching called
[7:45] nicole radia then he becomes from that
[7:49] to a false prophet
[7:51] if he's an antichrist antichrist is
[7:54] against
[7:55] anything that's against god's word is
[7:57] against god because the word
[7:59] is god and then when he come to crowning
[8:02] time
[8:03] then he become the false prophet of his
[8:05] antichrist teaching
[8:08] yep and he gets a sword because he
[8:10] unites his powers together
[8:12] then you don't have to ask nobody he's
[8:15] governor of state
[8:16] he is governor of heaven receives a
[8:19] triple crown
[8:20] mixes a separate idea called pregatory
[8:22] we fight and put it all down to the
[8:23] bible count his numeral numbers and
[8:25] everything
[8:26] else yuri's playing right back there is
[8:28] number four not number three number four
[8:30] see now let's turn revelations 12. let's
[8:33] just read this just a little bit because
[8:34] we
[8:35] will have time to do it and uh let's
[8:38] read uh
[8:38] revelations the 12th chapter
[8:41] and the 13th verse and when the dragon
[8:45] saw
[8:46] that he was cast out into the earth
[8:49] he persecuted the woman which brought
[8:52] forth
[8:53] the man child now i see he was cast out
[8:56] of the earth and becomes incarnate as
[8:59] the antichrist spirit become incarnate
[9:02] into a man
[9:03] that man changes from one thing to
[9:05] another
[9:06] from an antichrist spirit to a false
[9:08] prophet and then the beast comes into
[9:10] him
[9:11] now we find out here that this satan
[9:14] after being kicked out of heaven
[9:16] incarnates himself in the beast and now
[9:19] he
[9:19] is a beast antichrist
[9:22] false prophet and now beast and given
[9:26] the name of
[9:26] death and hell followers
[9:29] fully satan only strong oh my
[9:33] on the earth the satan representative
[9:37] on the earth that he now
[9:40] is head of the kingdoms of the world
[9:45] the very same kingdoms that he offered
[9:47] to the lord jesus and
[9:49] matthew 4. satan now becomes a full
[9:54] king all right notice now he'd be given
[9:57] a heart of a beast at that time
[9:58] and satan will incarnate himself because
[10:01] when the church goes up
[10:03] satan's cast out it's done
[10:06] man all this accusing is done see as
[10:09] long
[10:09] as as long as the intercessor
[10:13] is still on the throne satan can stand
[10:16] there and accuse
[10:18] because he is the attorney of the other
[10:21] side
[10:23] he is the opponent of christ but when
[10:25] our lord appears here
[10:27] on earth he'll be riding on over so
[10:31] white horse and you'll be completely
[10:34] fully the emmanuel the word of god
[10:38] incarnate in a man how much different
[10:42] there is
[10:43] that's the difference though
[10:46] notice the enterprise is on a pale horse
[10:50] mixed color
[10:51] a horse is a beast that represents a
[10:54] power
[10:54] his power is all mixed up what it's
[10:57] politics
[10:59] um it's national powers
[11:02] it's uh religious powers it's demon
[11:06] powers
[11:07] it's all kinds of powers mixed together
[11:10] a mixed pale horse was he's got all
[11:13] kinds of powers
[11:14] but when jesus comes it's on a one
[11:17] solid course the word
[11:21] amen
[11:26] fourth stage of the rider watch the
[11:28] fourth stage of this rider is called
[11:30] death death means eternal
[11:33] separation from god
[11:37] that's what death means to be eternal
[11:40] separated from god separation from god
[11:43] is dead
[11:44] eternal death and this fellow is called
[11:47] death so keep away from me amen
[11:53] there you are friend here's a fourth
[11:54] seal open
[11:56] and the riders of the four horses is
[11:58] revealed to the best of my knowledge

[33:09] if any man love the world the love of
[33:12] the father
[33:13] is not in him
[33:22] noah for all that it's in the world
[33:26] the lust of the flesh and the last of
[33:28] the eyes
[33:29] and the pride of life is not of the
[33:32] father
[33:33] but is of the world
[33:48] and the world passes away in the lost
[33:50] thereof but he
[33:52] that do the will of god abide us forever
[34:03] little children it is the last time and
[34:06] as you have heard that

[34:10] many antichrists
[34:12] whereby we know that it is the last
[34:15] time hitos
[34:33] but they were not of us or if they had
[34:35] been of us
[34:36] they would no doubt have continued with
[34:39] us but they went out
[34:41] that they might be made manifest that
[34:43] they were not
[34:44] all about salieron de nosotros
[35:02] but you have an ancient from the holy
[35:05] one
[35:06] and you know all things
[35:13] now to get the message daniel 5 verse 24
[35:18] daniel cinco
[35:22] then was the part of a hand sent
[35:26] from him and this writing was written
[35:49] this is the interpretation of the thing
[35:51] man
[35:52] god has numbered thy kingdom and
[35:54] finished it
[35:56] yes
[36:18] thy kingdom is divided and given to the
[36:21] myths and
[36:22] persians perez
