[46:33] I bless you this morning
[46:36] a privilege and an honor to be here
[46:40] stand behind this sacred desk
[46:44] something that we never never take
[46:46] lightly
[46:48] it's something that's very serious to me
[46:52] and to all anybody that gets up behind
[46:57] because we get to handle God's precious
[46:59] word
[47:03] and the thing is we're responsible for
[47:05] every word that comes out of our mouth
[47:10] so God bless all the visitors
[47:15] those that are watching us through the
[47:17] internet God bless you stand in the
[47:19] internet
[47:20] anyone that hears us in the future the
[47:22] pastor God bless you Lord
[47:26] as always we want to thank him for the
[47:28] confidence
[47:30] confidence that he has in us
[47:34] speak behind behind his desk here
[47:36] whenever
[47:52] not to have you standing much longer let
[47:54] us turn to a very very well-known
[47:56] scripture
[48:01] probably the most well-known scripture
[48:04] in Malachi 4 5.
[48:07] and uh just want each and every one of
[48:10] you to know
[48:12] that that we we're here to help you
[48:15] if there's something said that that's
[48:18] misunderstood
[48:21] please forgive me that's not the
[48:23] intention
[48:24] but we have to put out what God gives us
[48:28] you know there's sometimes I tell the
[48:30] pastor I'd like to preach a message you
[48:33] know that's a little you know flowery
[48:34] message you know really pumped up and
[48:36] really happy uh
[48:41] for some reason I I don't get I don't
[48:44] get the thoughts that way
[48:48] in obedience we put out what God gives
[48:51] us
[48:53] Ephesians
[48:55] 4 10 Ephesus Capital cuatro versus DS
[49:01] either descended is the same also that
[49:03] the center of high far above heaven that
[49:06] he may fill all things
[49:14] I apologize
[49:17] but watch the Formula here
[49:21] verse 11 is the formula El person says
[49:24] the formula to combat para combatir what
[49:27] was going to be
[49:29] thrown out at the same time by Satan
[49:31] foreign
[50:29] okay
[50:30] till we all come into the unity of the
[50:32] faith oh
[50:37] we all come into the separation
[50:41] yeah the scripture says God says
[50:44] God in print form is saying deals
[50:49] still okay we all come to the unity of
[50:53] the faith
[50:54] and of the knowledge of the Son of God
[50:58] unto a perfect man perfect until the
[51:01] measure of the stature of the fullness
[51:03] of Christ
[51:10] that we henceforth no more children
[51:18] in other words you're not confused
[51:21] he gave the formula formula but the
[51:24] formula
[51:26] so that is so that you are not in
[51:29] confusion in this day
[51:33] and carried about with every wind of
[51:35] Doctrine Jesus
[52:27] so we want to open this up a little bit
[52:30] so we saw the formula being with a
[52:33] formula that the formula was supposed to
[52:35] do is supposed to do
[52:38] and we see the product at the end
[52:41] so you see in today's society
[52:45] you look around today
[52:48] and there is so much information out
[52:50] right now
[52:53] right now it doesn't matter you have all
[52:57] information in your hand information
[53:00] right everybody's got a cell phone
[53:04] poor cell phone we're always talking
[53:06] about the cell phone
[53:09] so you have all the information that you
[53:11] could possibly need in your very hands
[53:16] you want to figure out how to build
[53:18] something
[53:20] you need information to do the certain
[53:22] things
[53:27] if you if someone tells you about a
[53:29] subject about a certain things
[53:32] we're all experts expertos because
[53:35] Google is the expert porque Google is
[53:37] Google has all the information that you
[53:40] could possibly need and want Google
[53:41] information
[53:44] even in the message
[53:46] we have the table
[53:48] application on the table we have so many
[53:51] articles
[53:52] we have the Bible the name was La Biblia
[53:55] we have everything that you could
[53:56] possibly need
[53:59] information overload the information
[54:03] so let me ask you a question
[54:07] why is it that people are more confused
[54:09] today
[54:11] than ever before que antes you know
[54:14] brother Henry mentioned some things in
[54:16] his message
[54:19] I thought you're going to go into it a
[54:21] little bit I'm like oh no
[54:24] that's okay
[54:27] so we're more confused than ever before
[54:29] for some reason
[54:33] how is that possible
[54:36] having the very thing in your hands
[54:40] you know
[54:42] this so this is this is the thing that
[54:44] that gets me
[54:47] and I found
[54:50] that has nothing to do with the
[54:52] information
[54:53] because information that you hear the
[54:56] information it's subjective
[54:59] it's subjective and what that means
[55:02] everybody listens to information
[55:06] and everybody gets something different
[55:08] out of it
[55:10] so what you have is a bunch of a
[55:12] different interpretations
[55:15] no matter what it is
[55:17] everyone will have a different thing
[55:21] or a different thoughts
[55:24] of what they heard
[55:26] for example for example you're hearing
[55:28] me this morning and I've mentioned this
[55:30] before
[55:32] right now you're formulating in your
[55:34] minds right now
[55:37] whether I know what I'm talking about
[55:40] full of beans and potatoes foreign
[56:25] yes he used the vessels to write it
[56:29] but we have to understand that
[56:32] this is God in print forms
[56:35] okay we're in agreement with that is
[56:38] part of the template
[56:40] and the temple is telling me
[56:44] that this faithful ministry that's been
[56:46] given is
[56:49] takes from the tapes
[56:52] takes from the prophet
[56:54] and together in unity
[56:57] it's it was givenado to combat the
[57:02] confusion of this day
[57:04] because confusion you can just think of
[57:07] confusion
[57:10] confusion is just running in chaos and
[57:12] not knowing what to do
[57:15] that's part of it it says
[57:20] introducing new and right
[57:39] The Serpent and Eve
[57:41] what did the serpent do
[57:44] we know that the serpent was just he was
[57:47] just an animal
[57:48] we know that Satan anointed this animal
[57:53] to come and bring Eve
[57:57] brand new information
[58:02] he confused her just enough
[58:08] wait a minute he quoted the template
[58:14] and then just a little bit of deviation
[58:20] look at and look at what he told her
[58:23] you'll be like
[58:25] did he tell her something negative or
[58:29] you're going to be destroyed you're
[58:30] going to be this one
[58:32] no no he deviated just enough
[58:38] to get up from under the head
[58:42] to bring this information
[58:45] to cause the fall
[58:48] amen amen confusion
[58:54] so today
[58:57] information the information watch these
[59:00] facts okay
[59:01] I shouldn't call them facts because
[59:03] that's what buzzword today
[59:07] but watch watch this in the 1900s
[59:13] they say a man by the name of David
[59:16] Schilling um
[59:18] he said human knowledge
[59:22] in the 1900s
[59:24] it would it would double every hundred
[59:27] years okay
[59:31] by the 1945s by 1945 pero foreign
[1:01:03] all the information has just grown
[1:01:05] exponentially throughout the years
[1:01:08] it's now doubling every 12 hours
[1:01:12] it's not even every 24 hours
[1:01:16] on top of that is they're just it's been
[1:01:20] around for a while
[1:01:22] but they just Let it Loose a little bit
[1:01:26] Congress got so scared
[1:01:29] that they had to dial it back artificial
[1:01:37] AI they're saying is so dangerous
[1:01:42] according to Elon Musk the Cordova Elon
[1:01:45] Musk I don't know how credible he is
[1:01:48] put it out there okay
[1:01:50] it's saying that AI is
[1:01:54] artificial intelligence
[1:01:56] is more dangerous than all the nuclear
[1:01:59] bombs put together
[1:02:03] so information is doubling every 12
[1:02:05] hours say foreign
[1:03:06] say Google write me a 10-page report on
[1:03:09] I forget what the information was
[1:03:14] in seconds
[1:03:16] we had a 10-page report
[1:03:20] how long does it take a human to write a
[1:03:23] report
[1:03:31] how many have been to and Walmart has
[1:03:34] been putting this in for a little bit
[1:03:37] self checkouts
[1:03:41] how many have been to First slide lately
[1:03:47] and then Marco first slide
[1:03:50] so they're doing away with the with the
[1:03:52] human tellers hey us is
[1:03:55] now you can go at any time you want
[1:03:59] make a deposit or withdrawal
[1:04:03] anytime you want yeah
[1:04:06] you don't need to speak to a human
[1:04:08] anymore
[1:04:11] they're saying that the implications of
[1:04:13] this AI is
[1:04:16] going to take Millions upon millions of
[1:04:19] jobs
[1:04:22] so brother Henry by choice or no choice
[1:04:26] we may all be poor here pretty soon
[1:04:30] we may not have a choice
[1:04:34] there's a big shake-up in our industry
[1:04:38] I do a lot with the in the technology
[1:04:41] field
[1:04:42] is
[1:04:45] and we're seeing more and more
[1:04:47] automation what's called automation come
[1:04:49] in yes
[1:04:52] now our automation means you're just
[1:04:54] taking the human element out
[1:04:57] significance
[1:04:59] they're writing certain programs and
[1:05:01] applications
[1:05:07] so that's how it looks right now
[1:05:10] what does it look like what is it going
[1:05:13] to look like in five years
[1:05:16] women
[1:05:21] all of us may be out of a job uh
[1:05:30] this is how bad it is okay
[1:05:33] I promise you this is not all doom and
[1:05:35] gloom I promise you
[1:05:37] I promise you this is not all doom and
[1:05:39] gloom is
[1:05:42] Hollywood is like shaking up
[1:05:47] how many know the Hollywood the
[1:05:49] screenwriters are on strike
[1:05:52] in Hollywood
[1:05:55] how many know that the the actors are
[1:05:57] all upset
[1:06:00] because
[1:06:07] you don't need a human to write a script
[1:06:09] anymore
[1:06:12] artificial intelligence is doing that
[1:06:15] for them
[1:06:17] the actors don't need to act anymore
[1:06:20] those actors are being replaced by AI
[1:06:25] they can even make them look younger
[1:06:27] yeah
[1:06:28] they're not needed anymore
[1:06:31] there's something called
[1:06:36] that's also Ai
[1:06:39] and what this is
[1:06:42] mimicking presidents
[1:06:44] closed captioning not available
[1:07:18] interesting huh interesting
[1:07:23] why does Satan use this tool
[1:07:27] all of a sudden there's UFOs or aliens
[1:07:30] are real now oh
[1:07:34] Mexican Congress just following two
[1:07:36] little Corp mummified corpses
[1:07:44] aliens are real now
[1:07:46] obviously the government's covering up
[1:07:48] this great Scandal government
[1:07:52] oh the Chinese are spinos on us by the
[1:07:55] way oh hello
[1:07:58] why does he do all this
[1:08:01] Satan knows and at the same time
[1:08:06] he was going to vomit all this
[1:08:09] information
[1:08:10] to keep you and I but
[1:08:14] scared
[1:08:15] to keep us thinking because if you can
[1:08:19] hear information is
[1:08:24] that's all he needs
[1:08:26] to get you to stop
[1:08:31] remember the the mind of the spirit
[1:08:35] all he needs to do is conceive something
[1:08:37] in your mind
[1:08:38] all he has to do is confuse you just a
[1:08:41] little bit
[1:08:45] question the message question the
[1:08:48] prophet question
[1:08:50] the formula that he gave
[1:08:53] but that formula was given today
[1:08:56] to combat the confusion
[1:09:00] so God has to equip his men now
[1:09:04] the information is
[1:09:10] then God's men have to grow faster
[1:09:19] the Saints only copying with God
[1:09:23] I wonder how fast the world is moving
[1:09:28] in Poland and Africa
[1:09:32] it has to grow faster
[1:10:13] if I bring something because I want to
[1:10:15] get to brother AJ you know what he
[1:10:17] messed for some reason I don't know
[1:10:21] if I bring the words
[1:10:24] I can bring the word
[1:10:27] for word
[1:10:29] but I've defeated the purpose of the
[1:10:32] world
[1:11:28] he said anybody
[1:11:31] without the Holy Ghost
[1:11:34] guess
[1:11:37] is
[1:11:43] so that's how a man would
[1:11:46] ravage a woman
[1:11:50] you know there's a lot of people that
[1:11:52] don't understand
[1:11:53] I was asked the question I didn't know
[1:11:55] how to answer it
[1:11:57] says how can a just God
[1:12:01] how could he let these things happen
[1:12:05] how can he let the deaths of these
[1:12:07] children
[1:12:09] it seems like the good people are always
[1:12:11] the ones that die right they're saying
[1:12:14] it's not that it's not God allowing that
[1:12:17] is
[1:12:18] it's like just take this concept
[1:12:22] now they say
[1:12:24] the cold doesn't
[1:12:27] existed they say that
[1:12:30] it's just the absence of heat
[1:12:33] just like Darkness doesn't exist they
[1:12:36] say
[1:12:37] amen
[1:13:33] foreign
[1:13:45] now keep this keep keep your eyes on
[1:13:48] this church
[1:13:51] the devil is putting up propaganda
[1:13:54] and it's not it's not with scripture
[1:13:58] but with the template
[1:14:01] it's to confuse the mind of the
[1:14:03] unlearned they're not spiritual people
[1:14:10] and we are living in the most glorious
[1:14:12] day yes
[1:14:15] that any people has ever lived
[1:14:20] yet in the darkest days
[1:14:23] or the unbelievers
[1:14:26] unbelievers
[1:14:28] and the most confusing times
[1:14:32] for they those who don't know
[1:14:35] it is remarkable yes the day that we're
[1:14:39] living
[1:14:40] what a joy it is
[1:14:52] confused don't know
[1:14:54] I just gave you the template
[1:14:57] now today
[1:14:59] we're approaching in this dark evil time
[1:15:09] if it doesn't Confucian
[1:15:20] that's the purpose like I said watch
[1:15:22] confusion okay
[1:15:24] I know that we all know what it means
[1:15:27] but watch
[1:15:29] the definitions of confusion definition
[1:15:32] an act of instance of confusing
[1:15:36] the quality or state of being confused
[1:15:41] watch this one here
[1:15:44] um a confused mass or a mixture
[1:15:48] now keep that put that one in your
[1:15:50] pocket because I'm gonna I'm gonna come
[1:15:51] back to that is
[1:15:57] a lack of understanding or uncertainty
[1:16:02] the state of being bewildered
[1:16:06] right when you're unclear or something
[1:16:09] some of the synonyms
[1:16:14] perplexed
[1:16:25] is to find yourself in difficulty all of
[1:16:29] difficulties
[1:16:31] so what has caused this confusion
[1:16:36] have we done it to ourselves many times
[1:16:41] we have it in our hands
[1:16:44] and it takes you back to to pilate
[1:16:50] I understand that Jesus had to be
[1:16:52] crucified he had to you Jesus
[1:16:55] what's this point okay
[1:16:57] highly had the opportunity to stop the
[1:17:01] crucifixion
[1:17:03] so he had the truth the very truth in
[1:17:07] his hands
[1:17:09] it was right before him
[1:17:14] I washed my hands of it
[1:17:17] oh my goodness my goodness oh if I say
[1:17:21] it again the truth was in his hands
[1:17:24] he had the ability to stop
[1:17:28] I know we all play our part it had to
[1:17:30] happen I know that Jose
[1:17:33] never wash our hands of it today
[1:17:37] brother
[1:17:39] he says I indict this generation
[1:17:43] for the second crucifixion
[1:17:46] my goodness oh bye yeah remember that
[1:17:48] one too because I'm going to come back
[1:17:49] to that is
[1:17:58] um
[1:18:03] guard your your hearts especially your
[1:18:06] young people Everyone is
[1:18:08] guard your heart
[1:18:11] the scripture says in proverbs 4 23 you
[1:18:14] don't need to turn to it
[1:18:17] this is let them not depart from their
[1:18:20] eyes
[1:18:25] it starts off
[1:18:27] um
[1:18:30] you don't have to turn to all the square
[1:18:31] phrase it here my son attend to my words
[1:18:34] not my words
[1:18:37] his words
[1:18:42] let them not depart from the lies
[1:18:45] keep them in the midst of your hearts
[1:18:50] oh they are live for Quezon Vida unto
[1:18:53] those that find them
[1:18:55] and health to all the flesh
[1:18:59] keep thine heart with all diligence
[1:19:11] see the goal of saying like I said
[1:19:18] he wants to keep you confused
[1:19:22] but let's let's get a little bit deeper
[1:19:24] here I'm going to get into my message
[1:19:25] now okay
[1:19:28] just put our spiritual thinking caps on
[1:19:31] here
[1:19:33] and if you're new like I said I I
[1:19:35] apologize
[1:19:39] um like so I'll do my best to try to try
[1:19:42] to break it down a little bit okay
[1:19:46] A couple of months ago um I was asleep
[1:19:50] it was about two two three in the
[1:19:51] morning I can't remember
[1:19:54] and I happened to wake up and I looked
[1:19:56] to my left
[1:20:01] the walls to my left there
[1:20:06] and for a split second is
[1:20:13] foreign
[1:20:28] so I started obviously I went to the
[1:20:30] prophet to the message
[1:20:32] and I started I started out the message
[1:20:35] the handwriting on the walls
[1:20:39] and as I'm reading there
[1:20:41] for some reason the word Babylon
[1:20:45] baby
[1:20:48] didn't think anything at first
[1:20:51] we know that the king about Cesar
[1:20:55] he was the Babylonian King at that time
[1:20:57] when the hand running on the walking
[1:20:58] around
[1:21:02] but we see but watch this King
[1:21:05] we know that Babylon had gone and
[1:21:08] conquered Jerusalem
[1:21:11] taking the vessels
[1:21:13] taking some of the people
[1:21:16] that's how Daniel and the three Hebrew
[1:21:18] children were founded
[1:21:22] so we see belshasar
[1:21:25] at one time he had this big party
[1:21:28] um
[1:21:30] a thousand noblemen
[1:21:35] all these important people right
[1:21:37] he said he had a party of all his Lords
[1:21:40] of a thousand people
[1:21:45] and he must have wanted to show off or
[1:21:47] something
[1:21:49] because we brought out he brought out
[1:21:52] the vessels right
[1:21:54] in front of his wives or concubines and
[1:21:57] Fantasies
[1:21:59] drinking wine out of it is
[1:22:06] [Music]
[1:22:59] so I started reading it
[1:23:04] like I said I started to understand oh
[1:23:07] okay
[1:23:08] Babylon Babylonia what does Babylon mean
[1:23:12] we know the brother balances Babylon
[1:23:15] this is confusion
[1:23:18] the actual definition means the gates of
[1:23:20] God
[1:23:22] definition
[1:23:27] we'll start off as Gates of God
[1:23:31] ends up as confusion
[1:23:33] when there's mixture in there when I mix
[1:23:37] my Humanity
[1:23:39] it's it's confusion as Confucian it's
[1:23:42] Babylon it's Babylonia so I started to
[1:23:45] see that this that this King this
[1:23:46] Babylonian King comes
[1:23:52] he worship a god a lot of the Moon
[1:23:56] how many how many knows what the name of
[1:23:58] that God was
[1:24:02] think in terms of spiritual speaking
[1:24:04] bring it bring it down to to us today
[1:24:07] but it is
[1:24:11] the name of that God was sin no science
[1:24:21] so I see that the prophecy that came to
[1:24:24] belshas
[1:24:26] because he had done these things
[1:24:29] he said you will fall this night
[1:24:33] he said the Persians and the medes will
[1:24:36] come take over the kids
[1:24:40] there's something there okay
[1:24:43] Babylon Babylonian confusion I saw what
[1:24:47] he did with the vessels
[1:24:48] [Music]
[1:24:49] is showing off
[1:24:52] maybe there was with the wives and the
[1:24:54] concubines
[1:24:56] maybe they're with churches
[1:25:01] and he said especado
[1:25:33] oh
[1:26:02] is he not a vessel
[1:26:06] Brothers oh
[1:26:11] if I remain in that if I categorize
[1:26:15] certain ones are and certain ones
[1:26:27] watch Persia
[1:26:31] if I have
[1:26:34] excuse me I hope my voice holds up
[1:26:38] handwriting on the wall
[1:26:40] you can look at that phrase
[1:26:42] oh there's handwriting on the wall oh
[1:26:47] you can use it in a present tense
[1:26:51] or handwriting on the wall
[1:26:54] the handwriting on the wall there is
[1:26:58] currently on the wall right now
[1:27:03] and if we deviate from the template that
[1:27:05] said Unity is
[1:27:08] and we bring a division
[1:27:11] a division is usually annotated Maybe by
[1:27:14] a wall
[1:27:17] if we put walls
[1:27:20] then you have just supplied
[1:27:23] a canvas
[1:28:24] has come in
[1:28:46] just like this country
[1:28:48] Republican are you democrat it is
[1:28:55] is it tapes or is it if I fold it is
[1:29:14] forgive me for for yelling
[1:30:08] this man that that picked these wild
[1:30:11] gourds
[1:30:15] and they made a porridge out of it
[1:30:18] and the prophet saw that yeah I said
[1:30:22] that's poison in the pot
[1:30:25] I don't want to do that so what did he
[1:30:29] do he says I sprinkled a little bit of
[1:30:31] meal offerings
[1:30:33] sprinkle a little bit of the word
[1:30:35] he went back to the temple a little bit
[1:30:42] no harm came to them
[1:30:48] Babylonia I don't want to be and found
[1:30:51] in Babylon
[1:30:52] Babylonia I don't want to provide a wall
[1:30:56] to let the hand write on it
[1:30:59] was judgment
[1:31:02] I don't want you know quiero you know
[1:31:05] Persia percia was renamed in 1935
[1:31:10] it was renamed to Iran
[1:31:13] Iran and I looked up what the word Iran
[1:31:16] means
[1:31:18] and it means Noble it means a lot of
[1:31:20] things but one of the words
[1:31:23] see how we mask itself
[1:31:27] a lot of times it will mask itself
[1:31:29] I don't want to do that
[1:31:40] I want to bring it clean as clean as
[1:31:42] possible
[1:31:44] I don't want confusion
[1:31:46] it says
[1:31:56] excuse me
[1:31:58] guard your heart
[1:32:00] is a Corazon
[1:32:04] you know we see
[1:32:06] vemos
[1:32:09] Babylon started Babylonia brother Brown
[1:32:12] says let me see if I can find the quote
[1:32:14] I got my notes all mixed up
[1:32:18] a little too excited there sorry sorry
[1:32:20] brother Noah
[1:32:29] the hour has come
[1:32:32] oh no say that for last I'm sorry
[1:32:37] but that's that's
[1:32:39] see that's the whole thing okay
[1:32:42] now we see arabemos
[1:32:45] anyone without the Holy Ghost again I'll
[1:32:47] come back to that uh
[1:32:50] anyone without the Holy Ghost he says
[1:32:56] start off in the beginning yeah
[1:32:59] in the form of a man
[1:33:02] in the form of a beast
[1:33:09] so we we saw what happened and the
[1:33:12] product which came
[1:33:15] how the two lines were crossed come on
[1:33:17] man
[1:33:21] it's a hybrid product
[1:33:24] and they say they say it came over in
[1:33:27] the ark he said okay
[1:33:35] well it crossed over through Hampton
[1:33:37] because he saw the nakedness of his
[1:33:38] father who knows he said
[1:33:41] and there's different interpretations
[1:33:43] for that yeah
[1:33:45] the reality of it is this
[1:33:49] they crossed over and all of them
[1:33:52] because they were all hybrids
[1:33:55] says you see Babylon in the beginning
[1:33:57] there is
[1:34:10] we see why the new birth is so important
[1:34:15] the new birth is absolutely it's
[1:34:19] imperative and known as Minto ES
[1:34:21] imperative it's absolutely necessary
[1:34:24] it's absolutely necessary that's the
[1:34:26] only way you're not going to be confused
[1:34:28] you're going to hear you're going to
[1:34:30] take the template usted
[1:34:32] and it's going to change you to the
[1:34:34] stature as the scripture says
[1:34:37] and it's going to make you be born again
[1:34:41] because your desires are different
