[58:33] it's once again a release from your
[58:36] gifts
[58:38] by the power of California
[58:42] something has released you
[58:54] there is therefore now no condemnation
[58:58] to them that are in Christ Jesus
[59:02] that walk not after the flesh
[59:05] but after the spirit
[59:08] he dipped his finger in his own blood
[59:12] and he writes pardoned on you
[59:16] so that's what repentance really is
[59:20] it's to be walking one way
[59:23] and then turning around and you start
[59:27] walking together
[59:30] now you know you have really good yeah
[59:35] when a man or a woman is released

[1:00:02] [Music]
[1:00:04] therefore being justified by faith
[1:00:10] we have peace with God
[1:00:14] [Music]
[1:00:15] through our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:23] you know the word of God
[1:00:27] [Music]
[1:00:29] there are people that receive the words
[1:00:37] they received the word Upon A Stony
[1:00:39] Place
[1:00:41] Ginger but since they don't have any
[1:00:43] Roots
[1:00:44] the enemy comes and puts that word of
[1:00:47] Salvation
[1:00:50] and why is it because they have not put
[1:00:54] on the helmet
[1:00:57] because let me read your scripture in
[1:01:00] Ephesians chapter two
[1:01:03] verse
[1:01:05] and the scripture says and you
[1:01:13] we're dead in trespasses
[1:01:17] the message is called accept God's gifts
[1:01:24] every sinner here
[1:01:27] inside out Monday
[1:01:30] wherever you are now already your sins
[1:01:33] any devio as far as God is concerned
[1:01:37] is forgiving you now
[1:01:43] he calls together his friends and
[1:01:46] neighbors
[1:01:48] saying unto them
[1:01:51] Rejoice with me
[1:01:53] before I found my sheep which was lost
[1:01:58] the Lord says I say unto you that
[1:02:04] likewise
[1:02:05] Joy shall be found in heaven
[1:02:09] over one sinner that repenteth
[1:02:12] [Music]
[1:02:14] brothers and sisters
[1:02:20] Our God moans us
[1:02:23] and if he doesn't like it
[1:02:28] he brings us
[1:02:30] and Moses again
[1:02:33] he makes us
[1:02:37] so that he can make us
[1:02:41] and I thank the Lord for that um
[1:02:47] and I believe
[1:02:49] he can show you that as well
[1:02:53] and just as he has redeemed me
[1:03:01] that not only have preached
[1:03:04] the message
[1:03:06] but have lived it with their lives
