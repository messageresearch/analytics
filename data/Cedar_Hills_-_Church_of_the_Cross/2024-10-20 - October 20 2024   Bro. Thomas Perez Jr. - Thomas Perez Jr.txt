that's one thing you can't teach people is faithfulness and we're grateful to them and to all of you amen amen now I was telling brother Jim and I hope that I I didn't forget anything uh but uh brother Jerry we want to remember him in prayer he's at home sick amen so remember him I I don't think I've ever been this excited to preach a message in my whole life and I've been preaching for 55 years that's a good I've uh it been thankful to the Lord for the messages that have been coming from behind this the messages from our pastor as you look into the book of Hebrews the 11th chapter this is just the just the saying I'm not going to go to 11 when you look into the book of he of of Hebrews the 11th chapter and then you you hear the Apostle Paul says what more can I say for the time does not permit me to and then Wednesday and then and then last Sunday by our Elder you know you just don't get fed any better than this we're grateful to the Lord amen I I I will not keep you very long this morning uh give me an hour of your undivided attention and then I I'll let you go amen am I was telling brother Jim and maybe this is just an levity uh I have 43 pages I probably could stay an hour in each page but but we're not going to do that Ephesians the 4th chapter and the third verse and I want to entitle the message this morning the weight of Glory Ephesians the 4th chapter in the third verse says this endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace you may be seated may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word and we're we're grateful to be here in the house of the Lord we'll let everybody get situated and then God bless you once again again I want to entitle our message this morning the weight of glory and I want to put a subtitle of Let Jesus be your witness amen uh about two Wednesdays ago I had the opportunity to go to to hear uh brother brother Tim brother timis and uh I do want to say he is one of the finest teachers that you'll ever hear in Malachi 4 and I was so grateful to be there with with him and and and the people God bless them this morning and and and this this transmission will go around the whole world but we're grateful that God has given the message that he's given us today we don't look for another message we don't look for another messenger we don't we don't look for another Doctrine or belief we already believe that Elijah the prophet Has Come For Us in this day and he came to bring us the word of life and the message of restoration and so upon the basis of what we believe I am more proud today than any day of our life because I have accepted the word of God and it does not matter what comes against us the message is the truth I don't move from the this message the message is the is what will take me home so while people are out there discussing the message I want you to live the message I want you to be the message they're trying to tell you that you as the message do not exist they're trying to tell you that you as the message are not important they're telling you that your existence here this morning does not matter they're telling you that your name does not matter and I would have to say maybe my name don't matter but my name written in the Lamb's Book of Life and so I take upon the basis of what I what I believe there are many people that have criticized what we believe now you know you know the we had a dear sister of ours that lives in in Texas and she called me S it's sister Carol Carol and sister Carol and brother Ira are one of our great pillars in our church Carol and we love them with all of our hearts but she said that one of her brothers had called her and told her that brother brandom or the message was a devil I said thanks be to God God for that because they called Jesus be all he told you was that you what you believe is the truth if they called my Lord and Savior a devil how much more are they going to call us well we told her we don't fight we don't go and and and try to change anybody's mind but if he ever wanted to come and talk to somebody we are willing to talk to him about anything in this whole message of what we believe to this day no one's called what is this that we believe we believe that the Eternal thoughts of God I want you to get this this morning because you you you we we we live our lives according to what people say about us if somebody tells us oh you're very handsome then you act handsome you dress better you comb your hair you take a shower you know why somebody called me handsome if somebody calls you ugly what do you do well you don't take a shower you don't brush your teeth anyways I'm ugly but all of those things is it does not matter what people call you it matters what God calls you and God calls you to be one of his elected chosen is predestinated he knew you before the foundation of the world so now we got to act like thatall you know for years we we've said this and people have said this now they they they they they have upgraded us from a cult to a sect and there's many people around the world that will call us a cult well that that's their opinion you know it's like the man that came to my barber shop one day and he told me this you know I don't believe the Bible because scientists have proed have said that the Bible was written by men my answer to him was this you do know that scientists are men anybody that tells you what you believe is wrong they're also with people of opinion but I don't care what people's opinions are I only care what God has got to tell me now there's only one message that has ever hit the face of the world that will reveal to you who you are in Christ they'll tell you what you mean to their Church so they make you sign a register to your church now you are a member of that church but I didn't sign my name to be a member of a church Jesus Christ with his own blood T my name into his church Hallelujah amen praise God all right let's see who you believe this morning this is the weight of Glory I want to say what brother Caleb said it's not if we feel the responsibility of the hour it's how much of that responsibility are we willing to take on everybody FS the responsibility everybody says we must do this or that but when it comes time for us to do it we'll let somebody else do it somebody else can preach the message somebody else can pray somebody else can live the life me I'm happy in our Pew let me tell you what brother Tim told us the other day and this really stuck with me people that go to church hear the message and do nothing about it are idolators where does it come from being idol being an idol this is what this is what has happened to the message brother brandham lived a life he lived a life worthy of the Gospel I follow the message I read my Bible I'm not taking on any responsibility now I listen to brother brandham every single day I don't don't wait for Sundays or Wednesdays to listen to brother brand I hear him every day that's where we get our Fountain that's where we get our food that's our Fountain that's our life but I am not like people that just stay home because people that just stay home say I don't want to be responsible I'm not responsible to nobody and in the process that nobody is responsible to them or for them it's easy just to I'll uh hear a tape and I could be in my sweats and I can just just be there and and kicking back drinking a cup of coffee and I'm not making fun of that what I'm telling you is this what the message makes us do it makes us take done the weight of Glory oh come on don't make don't make me pull it out of you this morning it makes you take on a responsibility now I would rather have thousands to say to me at the Judgment we heard you preach and you heard our feelings than to have one lost soul say I heard you preach but you didn't tell me the truth you've heard the truth from behind this death it has been the whole truth and nothing but the [Applause] truth but when you don't live the life of the truth it turns us to make us a different image than the image of God and when we turn into a different image than the image of God it cuses us to be idolators let that just soak in a little bit anyways brother brother Tommy senior he lived the life the ministry lives the life I can do anything I want to you have not taken on the weight of Glory it causes us to take responsibility we misre represent God when we wear his name but not his character character and let that one soak in give me give me the the the the stature of a perfect man if you would okay this is brother brandham now and he says this and this is a message on teaching that ties the man in that's going to be Redeemed by the blood of the Lord Jesus and is going to be in that church age that Eternal Church age at the end of the seals okay we had a we had a panel of of uh of uh tutors and governors and I am so proud of our young men that willingly of their own time have gone and have gone deep into the message they want to make sure that they get what they need if the Lord perish is coming and I I I as we we broach the subject this this subject of what is the Holy Ghost brother brandom and my papa said this you cannot come and receive the Holy Spirit unless you know what it is and you cannot receive it if you know what it is unless you believe it's given to you and it's for you and then you cannot know if you've got it or not unless you know what results brings the message will bring results in your life I told the young lady last night quit quit quit listening to the devil you know he's lying you know you know you know every time you know how you know that the devil's lying it's every time he opens up his mouth he doesn't even have to say nothing Brother Carlos as soon as he goes you know he's lying cuz he's the father of Lies amen this is the is the is the is the essence of the message is that we've got to know where we're standing Upon This Rock I told the young lady you haven't had that episode like this in a while then what's going to happen you want to have another one no then quit Happ quit having them if you have them it's because you like them people live in sin because they like it oh no the devil made me do it that is a Lie from the pits of Hell he's telling you when you fall he's telling you I made you do it the devil didn't make you do it you decided on your own the devil sleep SS he even he even snores what happens is you go and wake him up how important is it for each and every one of us to take responsibility tell your neighbor it's it's important you can you can even shout it from one side to the other brother Abraham I really need an amen just about right now oh there you go is there is there another is there another one okay we really need to take responsibility of somebody told me back there they were going to say a really really big amen amen amen that was decent good good good but everybody needs to take responsibility this is a proverb after this I'm going to go right into it for one want of a nail the shoe was lost for want of a shoe the horse was lost for want of a horse the rider was lost for want of a writer the message was lost for want of a message the battle was lost for want of a battle the kingdom was lost and all for the want of a horse you nail I'm brother I'm just an insignificant nail it doesn't really matter what I do take that proverb to heart because there is something for each and every one of you to do but the thing about it is this if I can't be the right arm I don't want to be anything we asked a man one time would you would did you do would you want to come to church his answer to us was this and this is a man that's not converted he said if I could be the pastor I'd go to your church [Laughter] for nobody nobody's interested to be a finger and do you know what the greatest the biggest organ in in your body is the skin it's the biggest organ in your body and nobody wants to be the skin if I can't be the finger if I can't be an eye if I can't be the arm if I can't be the head I don't want to be part of nothing you still don't know what the weight of Glory is you see how it's starting to but and say you start see seeing it come down that's what is called the shakina glory of God and it comes down and it's you you feel sometimes a little a nered because now you're taking responsibility if I believe the message I'm responsible to tell him but I don't tell him because I don't live the life and when I don't live the life I can't tell him about life but if I live the life I will tell him what I possess the weight that I feel the responsibility is mine to transfer you life that's the weight of Glory now the Jews believed that the Tabernacle contained the presence of God in the Torah God is also sometimes described as a cloud or a pillar of fire this was a symbol of God's presence among his people some Jews believe that shakina refer to the female qualities of God there is no message there is no leader in this world that can prove to you a cloud and a pillar of fire except us that have received the message of the okay Benny hen don't have that Ben Oral Roberts don't have that Tommy Osburn doesn't have that there is no tell oh I I wish I had some message believe here this morning there is nobody on television that can even claim that the pillar of fire has come to them there is nobody that can claim that this that they have this oh no no no I wish I had some M four five Believers I wish I had people that really believe the message of the hour I wish I had some people that would shout and say I am a believer GL hallelujah praise God oh come on come on go to anybody on tv nobody has the pillar of fire they talk about it but nobody has a photograph with the pillar of fire nobody has the weight of Glory I wish I had somebody that would believe the word of God and would say I love jesusall right here oh people have a lot of Theology and they'll explain to you about all kinds of things things that don't matter the only thing that should matter in your life is where my name is written at I was chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world before there was a world before there was an atom before there was anything I existed in the thought of God so then when he said let us make man he put upon me the [Music] weight when God said let us make men he put upon me he put upon you the weight the responsibility of [Music] [Applause] Glory I wish some of you would have gotten a good night sleep last night You' understood this a little bit better but that's all right it says this the word says this cast your burden on the Lord Jesus tells tells his his disciples take take my yoke take my yoke it's easy and my burden is light but what do we rather do take on the burdens and the cares of the world that's what the Apostle Paul says seeing that we are surrounded by a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin that so easily besets us and let us run the race [Applause] is this not the fast that I have chosen to loose the bonds of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens to let the oppressed Go free and that you break every yoke come to me all you that labor and are heavy lad I will give you rest Isaiah 41 for I the Lord your God will hold your right hand saying saying to you fear not I will help you therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he cares for you bear one another's burdens and fulfill the law of Christ Deuteronomy the 25th chapter tells us thiss you shall not have in your bag differing weights what ver was that 25 what 16 2513 you shall have not have in your bag differing weight you a heavy and a light you shall not have in your house differing measures a large and a small you shall have a perfect and just weight a perfect and just measure that your days may be lengthened in the land which the Lord your God has given you it's called the weight of Glory again it's called the weight of Glory tell your neighbor it's called the of Glory now Ephesians the 4th chapter and the 11th through the 13th verse he speaks about God's dress and he speaking about the fful ministry which brother brandham says is God's dress tell somebody God's dress now brother Bram we're going to start off early off with the early church and bring it for about five minutes now down to what they did and then I can show you the vision that I have for the future everybody paying attention now we are now living in his future we are now living in his future this is the vision he said that I have for the future we are now living in his future what we are doing today is not future this is Brother bram's future and he sees you in his [Applause] future now we be in this is Brother brand BR like you was a little boy my business is just to chop the wood no my business is just to chop the wood not pack it in let John pack it in I don't care if snow falls on it let him get out and get it no no it's your [Music] duty that's the weight are you feeling it does it feel heavy my burden's light it's not it's not it's not heavy it's not a burden my burden's light and that's the way and and then he says no it's your duty as a child of that home to see that the wood don't get wet just the deacons should be here early what time do you get here on Sunday morning 8:30 8:30 deacons 8:15 would be great if we saw some people that believe the message that would come at 8:30 in the morning and would be breaking down the doors let me in it is my duty to bring the wood in no I I I'll just I'll just come in at at 3 minutes till 10 10 uh 10:30 anyway anyways it's Frank's job to open the church it's Ben's job to sing it's brother Will's job to play the piano but brother will wasn't here this morning so brother Elijah played last night and brother Sammy played today you know why they have received the weight of Glory [Applause] oh I can't I I I don't I'm not going to sing loud because I don't have a mic because I don't even have the good mic and anyways they just give Tommy Jr the great mic that's why if they say well Frank should have went and got the water Frank it ain't my business but if Frank didn't get the water it's your business to take care that there is water that's all now that's just the way it runs and that's the way it runs in God family too if some of other of them say the other not long ago said quit preaching the way you are my goodness you're going to ruin every friend you got everything like that said let it alone I know it's wrong but my it ain't our business whose business is that thing if it's wrong somebody has got to do it [Applause] uh it's it's uh it's brother so and so it's his it's his duty to say Amen but but he wasn't here so nobody said amen whose business is my show me the picture of the cloud the magazine all right this is the picture that Life Magazine took and when they took it when they took the picture of the cloud everybody say well that's that that that's cloud of mystery until the prophet the angel of the Lord told him turn it right to the right show me it when he turns the cloud to the right see if that's not hofman's head or not that cloud came down in the desert of Arizona you wa too excited man I wish I had some Believers right now you way too excited that cloud happened in the desert of Arizona that was the weight of [Applause] Glory but it still had did not have a body yet so nobody knew how heavy it was nobody knew how much responsibility to take but there was one man that in January had received the sword of the Kingo Canyon hallu what had we received what had he received he received the word the full manifested word and he said it fell into my my hand what fell into his hand the weight the responsibility it was the opening of the word it was the third pool which was the opening of the word it was the responsibility that the word brought he's on Pulpit Rock he's not on his couch he's not in his couch you're a witness he's not in his couch listening to something he's out there finding his responsibility he's on his knees where at pit Rock when on the pit Rock he received the weight of majesty it wasn't the sword of a king it was the sword of the king it was the weight of [Applause] Glory but nobody knew how heavy it was yet not because it was just the head first pool was little birds I hope you get it I'm I've got about 15 minutes was little birds little birds we're happy to see the little birds right we're emotional did you see the birds second pool was doves were bigger Birds was doves in other words for you to understand it they were baptisms of the Holy Ghost they were bigger Birds they were baptisms of the Holy Ghost but the third pool was not little birds was not doves it was [Applause] Angel brother brandham and brother brandham this is the eighth question why hair no why why hair why why why why why hair ha and it says because of the angels of First Corinthians and then he tells them now I Praise You Brethren that you remember me in all things and keeping of the ordinances as I delivered unto you but I would have you to know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God what he's telling you is the weight of glory and he says this every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonors Christ but but every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered dishonors her head now then he says it would be rather it be be be shaven than than if she cut her hair for if the woman be not covered let her be shorn you are the only ones that have had the privilege to see the hair come down this is the weight of glory and it was supposed to come upon the woman the church the responsibility the head is Christ but the hair is the glory that he has given to his church it is the way of Glory [Applause] glor up until this time you didn't know what it was because you were in your churches and especially like in the Apostolic Church they use the veil because that was their covering but when the message of the hour came they said now your hair is your covering now for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for for as much as he is the glory and the image of God but the woman is the glory and the image of man so when he comes he turns the picture to the right this is why this picture has caused so much controversy there's people that say it didn't happen well to people that have not taken the responsibility yeah it has not happened but to who them that have taken the responsibility don't tell me I was there amen me too come on anybody else here it's called the weight of Glory this is why people don't know what they believe from one day to another because they have no identification now this is where brother this is Brother brand now in Germany once I saw a picture and it always struck with me a German painter has painted the picture that's called the Cloudland and when you see it brother Brown says off at a distance it's the horriblest looking Gloom you ever seen just clouds matted together people telling you it has not happened it's just clouds matted together when you're looking at it from a long distance in other words you have no responsibility and the weight of Glory has not rest upon you but when you get real close to it it changes it's angel's wings beating together that's why when we're here in the house of the Lord and you're raising up your hand and you're singing the songs of Di and you say I love the Lord Jesus what are you saying I have received the weight of Glory it is Angels it is angels that are beating their wings together so that's what Gloom is sometimes you look at it long distance it's gloomy and dark but take God at his word be certain that he's God move up close to it find out it's just Angels wings now find any Theologian you want in the Bible and all you're going to find is you're going to find a lot of blah blah blah blah blah blah blah I'm going to tell you I'm going to tell you who who's wrong and why I'm right and now he's a French model and everybody said did you see that French model and he's the ugliest person in the world and then you see a muscular guy that won the Olympics 1976 as a man now he says he's a chick oh forgive me now he says he's a he's a woman so now they asked the other guys how did you feel getting beat by a woman so now you can identify as anything you want to identify I like in Baton Rouge Louisiana when we went and and I'm not I'm not advocating guns man wrote my AK now he identifies as a 22 people can identify themselves as anything there there people that have married their cats and everybody says because we're now in this woke Society woke it's in this stupid Society it's how can a man be more than a man and then all of a sudden he's a woman are you with me how can a Christian say I am a Christian sit in here and hear the word of God and don't know from one day to another if they're a child of God or not the reason is they have not received the weight of Glory because one time that you receive it it makes you responsible amen it's so sad when you have interviews with people and you ask them why did you do this well everybody in the church is doing it you know they're doing it why can't I is that your your your compass or or are you saying this should you say this I don't do it because I've taken on the responsibility I have a position in this church nobody gave it to me God gave it to me and when God gave it to me I didn't have to take the weight of Glory what am I going to do give what I've got to do my responsibility brother brandom in the message what is the vision he says now what is the sear what is a vision it's another dimension I don't want to sound sacrilegious I believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe in baptis BM after baptism after baptism but if you never get a new birth you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost 24 hours a day still go to hell you know why you haven't taken on the weight of Glory that's the greatest hardest thing in a church is to talk to people that have never been born again oh they know what brother brandham says but when the but when the weight comes I can't do that no no I can't do that I I I can't do that you know why it causes you to act different Frank doesn't bring the water in Joe John doesn't bring the wood in guess who's who's who we have to do Brother Sam yes who has to bring it in you got to bring it in right now it's a higher Dimension but everybody would rather see a few doves what a service we had Holy Ghost came in we jumped and we shouted we saying oh woo everybody went wo oh Hallelujah and everybody cried and they did everything and we had a great time what a baptism of the Holy Ghost and then you go home and you live anywhere you want because there's no weight of Glory but doves could not pick him up here that's right it required angels and brother brandom says and they picked me up oh I heard a great message it still takes for you to do something about it this opens up a whole another can of worms but you come into the mercy seat and there's two two cherubin and one is one is Michael and the other one is the devil and it depends how you come in depending on the anointing that you have you're going to get the image of one or the image of the other you either become an image of God or you become an idolator you either become the stature of the perfect man or you become a statue that's right and so many Malachi 4 five believers they just statu oh brother Brandon's going to do it oh brother and you know when brother Brandon comes back and you know what all this and I tell people this I'm not going to go back and forth with what what what you believe of the future I'm just telling you that I'm living right now in brother bram's [Applause] future so we become idolators and we don't know who to serve I tell you one thing Angels picked him up and if angels picked him up into the constellation then it's going to require angels to take you from the Earthly to the Heavenly in the waight of Glory all right I know you didn't get it but that's all right that's all right maybe some of you got it this is the weight of Glory what is the weight of Glory called you called for you it says this ye have heard it said of them of old time Thou shalt not kill but I say unto you you have said of the them of old time Thou shalt not commit adultery but I say unto you it has been said but I say unto you it has been said but I say unto you you have heard it said of old time an eye for an eye and a tooth for a truth but I say unto you you have heard that it have been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thy enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you I didn't say that Jesus said this but what does it require for you to live that angels have got to pick you up have got to put you in the constellation and when you're in the constellation one of those angels He said look to me what was that that was his angel that was the Heavenly that picked up the Earthly and put on the weight of Glory Hallelujah what does he tell him to do now you got to go back east and you've got to tell the people one two 3 four five six seven steals what is all of that so the you could know more than everybody else so that you could be endued with power from on high that you can be dressed upon within upon without every way around you would be the glory of God and when he looked God looked he said he looked upon him he was so inspired to see him the way he looked and the form of him he was so inspired that he would be the perfect Masterpiece of a redeemer Jesus the Redeemer so God in order to be smitten himself because to pay his own penalty God and Christ became one so God could be smoked in the image and that's why Isaiah said we did esteem him smitten and Afflicted of yet he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed then he says this The Perfect Image the God man God in had changed from the supernatural to the vision and the vision was projected into the image and the image was smitten so the supernatural could taste the feeling of death he could not do it in Moses he could not do it in any other Prophet because he could not but in this masterpiece he was the fullness of the godhead body he could not just project Moses he could project his entire being that's why we have not received a message a message just any message we've received the Eternal thoughts of God that have been transferred to the hearts of The Believer by the Angels lifting us up to Heavenly places and when he said I saw him he looked to me he said then I could never be the same you know why he had received the weight of we have been so we have been so privilege to have two of the greatest pastors that this message has ever produced if you have another Pastor God bless you feel feel the way about your pastor I say my wife's the most beautiful woman in the world man you should feel the same way if your wife's not the most beautiful woman in the world then then you're going to be looking at somebody else two of the greatest pastors this message has ever produced founding Pastor past the way but before he left he transferred the weight of Glory to our pastor what is our p Pastor trying to do for us is to give us the weight of Glory the responsibility so that together we can go home but it will take for you to live a life surrendered and let the Angels lift you up lift you up to another dimension to another plane to another place where what happens there where you receive the weight Paul says in this body I don't know out of this body I can't say but I saw one whether in this body or outside of this body but I saw one in my vision I saw one was taken up to the third heaven what did he receive in February 28 he received the glory the Dominion the power the Majesty the weight of Glory [Applause] GL what are you supposed to receive today oh brother you know you know I come whenever I I want that's fine there's no responsibility no no no resp you imagine if you went home and you did whatever you want when you get married you say I'm going to get married because I can do whatever I want oh no I come I come to church and when I come to church I do my duty and and when I leave I call the one I'm responsible to and I tell her I tell her hun I'm on my way back home do you know I have never ever had my own bedroom you when we were kids me and me and brother Caleb shared the room when it was cold we'd cuddle up together he's a heater right he's a heater oh man he's a snuggle bunny snug bu oh I loved it when was young then I got married and I couldn't cuddle with him no more but then I got married to Sister Laura and I still don't have my own room but she cuddles nice this is God's love affair what do you receive when you receive you hear you hear you hear Brother Caleb here with all of his heart he don't watch TV all all all Saturday pick you up a microwave dinner he goes into the throne room of God the weight the glory picks him up and looks makes him look around say what are you seeing I see a wheel in the middle of a wheel I see the Shina glory of God I see your word action now go give it to [Applause] them what does he give us to finish the weight of Glory you have heard it said before that you could do whatever you want to and you could still be a Christian but not if you have the weight that's right you know if people see papers outside they don't pick it up if you go to the bathrooms you don't clean up after yourself because we have a janitor are you serious is that the way you do at church at your house if I see a paper on the parking lot brother Fel will get it that's a bad attitude right am you you go to church here this is your home I have one husband that's our pastor he gives us the hidden me the hidden man of God he's the angel of the church he's he is the Messenger to the church what should I do something needs to be done I don't need for for for a board to get together even though all respect to our board but if I need I see something that needs to be done I do it you know why I've received the weight maybe you didn't like that last part all right but this is what I like to do at home I clean up after myself some of it I got a lady that takes care of me like you never that's her M Ministry I love her with all my heart but that's why you us together have got to put on the weight and the weight Glory tell your neighbor I'm responsible for you no really tell them oh really really
