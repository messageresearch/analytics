[30:55] there thank you
[31:01] amen so we're gonna we're gonna open up
[31:03] our scriptures this evening
[31:06] and to the book of First Corinthians
[31:10] and we're going to start with the 15th
[31:12] uh chapter
[31:14] and the 12th verse
[31:18] and it reads like this
[31:22] now if Christ be preached
[31:26] that he rose from the dead house says
[31:29] some among you that there is no
[31:32] resurrection of the Dead
[31:43] Resurrection May the Lord has blessings
[31:46] to the reading of the words
[31:50] you know as I was uh as I was
[31:55] um in the last month or so or a couple
[31:59] months
[32:02] we uh we have heard on the news
[32:06] noticias about a Revival uh
[32:11] in college
[32:14] and we we've we've seen it Lemos Visto
[32:18] that it was something that was just
[32:20] started out as a as maybe uh uh uh
[32:24] someone going up there and uh and and
[32:26] confessing uh their uh their wrongs
[32:36] and we see that it uh it continued
[32:42] not just for a week or two weeks
[32:46] I think it was well over a month maybe a
[32:49] couple of months romance
[32:52] many people from all over the world came
[32:58] to see what was going on
[33:03] um many many evangelicals even even
[33:07] notated
[33:11] that truly this is a Revival from the
[33:15] Lord
[33:20] there's no doubt to say that it was a
[33:22] Revival
[33:25] there's no I'm not here to
[33:28] say anything negative about it
[33:33] but you
[33:35] you have to see
[33:37] where the leading of the spirit is
[33:39] taking it
[33:45] and we're going back
[33:48] and seen uh these certain revivals uh
[33:53] that have that have hit the U.S regress
[34:00] it takes me it takes me to a movie that
[34:03] just came out called Jesus Revolution
[34:08] Jesus and if they can put the picture up
[34:12] there
[34:16] on April 8th of 1966
[34:21] Time Magazine came out with a with a
[34:24] with a magazine or with that with the
[34:26] issue that that month
[34:29] is
[34:31] and the question of it was is
[34:34] dead
[34:39] how we don't believe in a coincidence
[34:44] but less than four months prior to this
[34:48] is
[34:51] less or about four months prior to this
[34:55] our Prophet brother Branham had passed
[34:58] away
[35:03] four months later Is God dead
[35:09] what a thing that was after
[35:13] almost three decades
[35:17] of nothing but the presence of God
[35:21] flowing through this country how
[35:29] fast
[35:31] and how uh
[35:34] and if you look at what happened
[35:39] how fast that
[35:42] that left
[35:45] four months after the prophet is passed
[35:48] away is
[35:55] but something was
[35:56] occurring during this time
[36:00] that I think is
[36:03] is pretty significant
[36:07] now I'm not talking about what had
[36:10] happened during the Jesus revolution of
[36:12] the 60s and 70s
[36:17] which was the hippie Revolution
[36:22] when the hippies were started coming and
[36:24] they started they started uh getting
[36:28] into into Christianity
[36:34] but I'm not talking about that type of
[36:36] movement
[36:39] there was something that started to
[36:42] happen
[36:44] in the in the mid to late 60s
[36:50] that caused in night in June 21st of
[36:55] 1971.
[36:59] for Time Magazine
[37:02] to Proclaim once again five years later
[37:05] time
[37:09] Jesus revolution revolution De Jesus but
[37:13] what happened between this period of
[37:15] five years
[37:19] that took place
[37:22] I believe that during these five years
[37:28] is why we are here today is
[37:33] amen amen there was a young man
[37:37] Hoven who had just gotten out of the
[37:40] Navy
[37:45] there is a man in 1966
[37:50] that had a one-year-old son
[37:55] and was living in
[37:57] East L.A is
[38:02] it would bring in a revolution
[38:07] that impacted us so fiercely you knows
[38:14] that in 1971
[38:18] the year that our pastor was born
[38:23] it caused something of a Jesus
[38:25] revolution in in our time Jesus
[38:31] now if Christ be preached that he rose
[38:34] from the dead
[38:38] how say some among you that there is no
[38:41] resurrection of the Dead commodities
[38:48] we look at Paul as he's writing to the
[38:50] Corinthians
[38:55] Paul is writing this to a to a to a
[38:59] people
[39:02] where Resurrection
[39:05] Resurrection was not something that was
[39:08] familiar to them
[39:10] even though
[39:13] even though they had heard the message
[39:17] they had heard what Paul had was
[39:20] preaching
[39:22] they were trying to grasp what is the
[39:26] meaning of Resurrection
[39:31] in Corinth in it was a port city
[39:37] at that time it was under the rule of
[39:40] the Roman Empire
[39:44] and the worship
[39:47] they had two Patron deities
[39:51] there was Poseidon
[39:54] who was god of the sea yes
[40:00] which was the goddess of central love
[40:05] Corinth was a definition of what's
[40:07] called a Party Town
[40:11] Pueblo de Fiesta and here is Paul akista
[40:16] Pablo trying to make them understand
[40:21] that there was a Christ
[40:24] that there was a savior Salvador that
[40:28] did something for them
[40:30] not only did he die no Solomon Not only
[40:33] was he buried
[40:35] but that he resurrected
[40:40] verse 13 but if there be no resurrection
[40:43] of the dead of the dead then is Christ
[40:45] not risen
[40:47] resurrection
[40:50] and if Christ be not risen then is our
[40:53] preaching Vain and your faith is also
[40:56] vain is
[41:03] and we are found false Witnesses of God
[41:06] because we have testified of God that he
[41:09] raised up Christ whom he raised not up
[41:12] if so be that the dead rise not is
[41:24] for if the dead rise not then is not
[41:27] Christ raised
[41:31] and if Christ be not raised your faith
[41:35] is vain ye are yet in your sins
[41:43] then they also which are fallen asleep
[41:46] in Christ are perished
[41:51] if in this life only we have hope in
[41:55] Christ we are of all men most Miserables
[42:07] but now as Christ risen from the dead
[42:10] and become the firstfruits of them
[42:12] that's left
[42:20] this was something unfamiliar to the
[42:23] Corinthians
[42:26] this was something unfamiliar to them
[42:31] they couldn't grasp
[42:34] ayos
[42:35] how a deity of of God
[42:40] was able to resurrect from the dead
[42:45] their belief was when you're dead you're
[42:48] dead
[42:50] and that is
[42:52] and what a belief that is
[42:58] but the question this evening
[43:01] Is God dead is
[43:05] and your response to that is
[43:09] will say something
[43:11] because if you believe that God is dead
[43:15] or that there is no God okay no ideos it
[43:19] will take
[43:20] it will make you replace your body as
[43:24] your soul replies
[43:28] Su Alma let me repeat that again I'm
[43:31] sorry I said it incorrectly hello
[43:35] it will take your soul
[43:39] and it will make
[43:41] to make your body a
[43:44] pass
[43:48] because if there is no soul
[43:51] you're just left with material
[43:57] if you just if you just have the
[43:59] material
[44:01] you make your body
[44:05] to be the ultimate and the eternal
[44:10] eterno
[44:11] your body becomes your soulma
[44:17] if there is no God
[44:19] or if God is dead
[44:22] and what happens when there is no God is
[44:27] Man will always
[44:29] come to a point
[44:33] where they will make themselves great
[44:37] for they will make themselves in charge
[44:41] when there is no God
[44:44] because now they feel that they are the
[44:46] highest being
[44:50] that there is no there's nothing or no
[44:53] one that is greater than them
[44:56] and this is what happens
[45:05] this no also
[45:08] verse one that in the last days
[45:11] perilous times shall come
[45:19] for men shall be lovers of their own
[45:22] selves
[45:24] and I thought that was tremendous
[45:28] men shall be lovers of their own selves
[45:34] men shall say that there is no God
[45:37] no idea and that God is dead
[45:41] and they will say or they will become
[45:44] lovers of their own selves
[45:49] and we find that so much in our in our
[45:52] culture in our society today
[45:57] where we find women
[46:02] that uh that that are pro-abortion is
[46:07] they will say this is my body
[46:15] and what have they done
[46:18] they've become lovers of their own
[46:21] selves
[46:23] and yes they can say God is dead
[46:27] because if God was not dead
[46:31] you hear many times
[46:34] Well if there was a god there wouldn't
[46:36] be this all this suffering
[46:40] if there was a god
[46:42] children wouldn't get sick
[46:47] children wouldn't die
[46:50] and all this suffering would not happen
[46:54] if there was a
[46:57] godos and even if there was a God
[47:01] we know for sure he is dead
[47:06] what a question that is this evening
[47:11] what a question that is to ask ourselves
[47:15] even though we come to church
[47:18] even though we sing praises to the Lord
[47:24] and we do all these things yes
[47:29] we have to look ourselves in them in the
[47:31] mirror
[47:34] and we have to ask ourselves
[47:37] is the world seen God through us
[47:43] because if the world cannot see God
[47:46] through you
[47:49] then then to the world
[47:52] God is dead
[48:02] we have to be a reflection of God
[48:05] reflection de dios
[48:08] Is God dead is
[48:19] I want to thank our pastor for sending
[48:21] me this and
[48:26] um
[48:27] in the in the uh the message lifting
[48:30] lifting him up out of history
[48:35] and I can see amram night after night
[48:40] no matter how tired
[48:44] that proved his faith in that God is
[48:48] now if you don't know who amram
[48:52] and Joshua there were the parents of
[48:55] Moses
[48:59] says but today the people
[49:02] if they don't get everything they ask
[49:04] for
[49:07] the first time they pray
[49:10] they seem to think that he's dead
[49:19] what a
[49:21] what a place
[49:30] yes God God is dead
[49:34] I didn't get that healing that I wanted
[49:38] look what happened at my job
[49:41] look what happened to my family
[49:44] if if I don't if they don't get
[49:47] everything they want brother Branham
[49:48] says
[49:50] seem to think that he's dead
[49:54] he says what we need is men and women
[49:57] today this is
[50:03] men and women who are determined to hold
[50:06] on
[50:09] till they see a God that really lives
[50:14] you know you might not see
[50:20] you
[50:24] mean
[50:25] but he is saying if you hold on
[50:30] you're gonna realize that you serve a
[50:35] living God
[50:39] okay
[50:42] till they see a God that really lives
[50:46] comes into action
[50:49] that will not take no for an answer
[50:53] they are determined to stay with it
[50:57] they are sick and the doctor has said
[51:01] they can't get well
[51:04] I had something within them tells them
[51:07] they're going to be well
[51:13] hold on
[51:15] no matter what takes place
[51:18] have you joined the churches of the
[51:20] denominational denominational world
[51:27] after you have sapped all your strength
[51:30] from walking from place to place
[51:33] and
[51:35] you still can't find relief
[51:38] there is still a God that answers
[51:41] prayers and saves from sins
[51:46] we're going to skip to verse to uh to
[51:49] paragraph 57.
[51:51] it says
[51:53] or 56 I'm sorry could they say and we
[51:56] see him night after night
[51:58] as amram climbed the steps
[52:03] and Joshua would come up to him and say
[52:06] amram dear
[52:10] you've been up here praying all night
[52:13] why don't you just tell some of the boys
[52:16] where you're working and let them pray a
[52:18] while
[52:21] honey what if they don't do it
[52:26] somebody has got to do it
[52:29] somebody has got to pray through
[52:33] that's the ver that's the way every
[52:36] Christian ought to feel tonight
[52:39] not waiting for somebody else
[52:42] well I'm waiting for Brother Diego to
[52:44] pray tonight
[52:48] vamos

[53:01] that's the way every Christian ought to
[53:04] feel tonight
[53:06] not waiting for somebody else
[53:08] but take the front
[53:12] selves and go through
[53:16] we believe the Bible to be a history
[53:21] it's also a prophetic book that tells
[53:24] that the same God shall rise in the last
[53:28] days
[53:32] and it's time for him to come unseen yes
[53:48] that Moses had prophesied or not Moses
[53:52] pardon me Abraham had given a promise by
[53:54] this God of history now
[54:02] this is this is pretty amazing
[54:05] here is amram praying Orlando
[54:10] and God had an answer to prayer
[54:14] for 400 years
[54:21] [Applause]
[54:23] four months later after birth after
[54:26] brother Brandon passes away is God dead
[54:28] what promises
[54:33] they couldn't see anything that was
[54:35] happening
[54:37] they said there's something wrong
[54:42] and that was four months
[54:44] is
[54:50] 400 years

[55:17] we've had a silent God for a long time
[55:28] has come avenido
[55:31] where he's going to rise on the scene
[55:39] I don't know if you get that this
[55:40] evening

[57:00] he knew
[57:04] that something was going
[57:06] to
[57:08] contest somebody that was raised up
[57:12] to take them out of their conditions
[57:17] while he was deep and concentrated

[58:56] after 400 years
[59:04] what a great thing that was
[59:08] what about our day
[59:11] I told you about a man this is from a
[59:15] little mining town in Southern New
[59:16] Mexico
[59:21] who in 1969
[59:28] he was
[59:29] ordained in Bakersfield California
[59:32] in Bakersfield California and in 1972
[59:37] a year after this Jesus Revolution
[59:40] magazine came out Jesus
[59:46] God started a revolution through him
[59:50] what had we been waiting foreign
[1:00:18] nothing's happened
[1:00:20] well maybe next year let's go to 67.
[1:00:24] let's go to Easter again
[1:00:27] nothing happened and years and years
[1:00:30] happened
[1:00:32] nothing has happened
[1:00:36] but at that time
[1:00:37] there was God was yes
[1:01:10] aren't you proud to be part of that
[1:01:12] Jesus Revolution
[1:01:16] so when you see these revolutions
[1:01:20] and these stories
[1:01:27] [Applause]
[1:01:30] I know what you're talking about
[1:01:34] I'm going to close with this
[1:01:41] there's a great lesson about success and
[1:01:43] Leadership
[1:01:44] [Music]
[1:01:47] from studying the way
[1:01:50] that Buffalo and cows respond to storms
[1:01:58] a man is a man is saying this story
[1:02:04] in Colorado where I grew up
[1:02:09] because we are famous for the Rocky
[1:02:11] Mountains
[1:02:13] says what people don't realize
[1:02:16] is that the state is divided almost
[1:02:19] exactly in half is
[1:02:23] and to the eastern part of the state
[1:02:25] there are there's the great Kansas
[1:02:28] Plains
[1:02:31] Kansas it says because of this unique
[1:02:34] landscape uh
[1:02:39] the landscape
[1:02:40] or this is we are one of the few places
[1:02:43] in the world where Buffalo and cows are
[1:02:46] in close proximity to each other
[1:02:52] he says when the storms come they all
[1:02:55] they almost always come from the west
[1:02:57] and roll out towards the east
[1:03:05] he said when the cows sense the storm
[1:03:08] coming from the West Las Vegas
[1:03:13] they start to run toward the East
[1:03:18] the only problem with that is
[1:03:21] that the cow is slow
[1:03:25] so the storm catches up to the cow
[1:03:28] pretty fast
[1:03:31] and without realizing it
[1:03:35] the cow tries to outrun the storm uh
[1:03:51] this is maximizing the amount of pain
[1:03:54] and time
[1:03:56] is
[1:03:59] frustration they experience from the
[1:04:01] storms
[1:04:07] he says the buffalo on the other hand
[1:04:10] is very unique for the animal kingdom
[1:04:13] animal
[1:04:15] this is a buffalo wait for this they
[1:04:17] wait for the storm is
[1:04:20] to cross right over the peak
[1:04:24] of the Mountaintop
[1:04:27] and as the storm rolls over the ridge
[1:04:33] the Buffalo turned
[1:04:36] and charged directly into the storm
[1:04:41] instead of running East
[1:04:44] away from the storm Alejandro they run
[1:04:48] West
[1:04:53] by running at the storm
[1:04:56] they run straight through it
[1:05:01] minimizing the amount of pain
[1:05:06] and time and frustration
[1:05:09] they experienced from that storm
[1:05:13] notice now how it's the exact same storm
[1:05:22] which direction are we heading today
[1:05:27] it's easy to say
[1:05:30] there's a storm
[1:05:32] I'm going to head right into it brother
[1:05:37] but it's much harder this is to see the
[1:05:41] storm
[1:05:42] and head straight into it
[1:05:45] words are easy
[1:05:48] words
[1:05:52] are actions
[1:05:55] is that that's what shows our character
[1:06:00] that's what shows who we are
[1:06:02] and that's what shows if God is dead
[1:06:07] it's alive
[1:06:13] may God bless you this evening
[1:06:16] [Applause]
[1:06:29] thank you
[1:06:34] fine evening
[1:06:38] my water Masterpiece
[1:06:40] hey can you give another one to the Lord
[1:06:47] what a beautiful message
[1:06:50] many times we we leave and we put God
[1:06:54] into history
[1:06:56] you know we we put them as things that
[1:06:59] happened in the past
[1:07:03] you know but we have to believe one
[1:07:05] thing
[1:07:06] that God works through us
[1:07:09] that he lives inside of us
[1:07:12] if that is so if he does live inside of
[1:07:15] us
[1:07:16] then that same life that he has
[1:07:20] that same life has got to be inside of
[1:07:22] us
[1:07:23] you know that that's why our prophet he
[1:07:26] preached the message identified
[1:07:30] and in that message he ties all history
[1:07:34] up to himself
[1:07:37] I was identified
[1:07:42] I was identified
[1:08:45] this is our
[1:08:48] this is what God called US foreign
[1:10:13] they had no shoes
[1:10:17] yes with two feet of snow
[1:10:20] and they did not know what to do
[1:10:23] but he said we're gonna pray
[1:10:26] we're gonna pray till God answers
[1:10:35] and he prayed to God
[1:10:38] all night foreign
[1:10:57] he said
[1:11:01] he had to have prayed
[1:11:04] Spears
[1:11:41] and that's why we are here today church
[1:11:43] that's why we could preach a message
[1:11:45] like this
[1:11:47] we could freely preach who God is
[1:11:49] foreign
[1:12:39] El Campo
[1:12:41] let us turn to the book of Samuel first
[1:12:43] Samuel Thomas
[1:12:47] amen his word
[1:12:52] is amazing
[1:12:54] brother will what a beautiful message
[1:12:59] first Samuel one first Samuel 15 1.
[1:13:04] I want to paint you a picture today
[1:13:10] Samuel also said to Saul
[1:13:14] the Lord sent me to anointing to be king
[1:13:17] over his people
[1:13:22] over Israel
[1:13:25] now therefore hearken unto the voice of
[1:13:29] the words of the Lord
[1:13:32] of hosts
[1:13:36] I remember that that which
[1:13:40] to Israel how he laid wait for him in
[1:13:44] the way when he camped from up from me
[1:13:47] from Egypt Israel
[1:14:03] and utterly destroy all that they have
[1:14:06] and spare them not slay both men and
[1:14:10] women if infant and suckling ox and
[1:14:14] sheep camel and ass
[1:14:18] is
[1:14:30] and I want you to take the spiritual
[1:14:32] aspect of this church
[1:14:35] what did God have against amalekites yes
[1:14:39] he's telling Saul here
[1:15:05] I'm sorry if I'm excited here but we're
[1:15:08] going to get somewhere here Church
[1:15:12] judges 2 verse 10. versus those yes and
[1:15:16] also all the generations were gathered
[1:15:18] unto his fathers and there arose another
[1:15:21] generation after them which knew not the
[1:15:24] Lord nor yet The Works which he had done
[1:15:27] for Israel is
[1:15:39] Rael verse
[1:15:42] and also will not henceforth drive out
[1:15:45] any from from before them of all Nations
[1:15:48] which Joshua left when he died
[1:16:01] that through them
[1:16:03] I may prove Israel
[1:16:05] whether they be kept in the way of the
[1:16:07] Lord to walk therein as their fathers
[1:16:10] did keep it or not
[1:16:25] therefore the Lord left those Nations
[1:16:28] without driving them out hastily neither
[1:16:32] delivered he them unto the hand of
[1:16:34] Joshua is
[1:16:42] [Music]
[1:16:43] but why what did God have against the
[1:16:47] malachites
[1:16:49] you go now to Joshua Caleb
[1:16:53] remember what they did
[1:16:55] Caleb said give me this mountain
[1:16:59] but what happened
[1:17:01] that was the land of the malachite
[1:17:05] that's where anik and the Three Sons
[1:17:07] those three Giants lived
[1:17:10] but God gave that to calebos everywhere
[1:17:15] were your feet shall tread upon
[1:17:18] but something happened as we just read
[1:17:22] our Rose degeneration
[1:17:28] so sin came in because now what happened
[1:17:32] God said okay
[1:17:34] he said you're not going to kill them
[1:17:37] I'm gonna let you drive them out
[1:17:40] so
[1:18:04] who was the first one that confronted
[1:18:06] Israel
[1:18:08] Israel when they crossed the Red Sea
[1:18:12] malachite
[1:18:13] every time that Israel
[1:18:16] got to a place of rest
[1:18:23] but the reason that God had something
[1:18:26] against
[1:18:28] they had no respect
[1:18:30] they had no respect of the god of Israel
[1:18:35] so now came the opportunity
[1:18:39] God gave them the opportunity
[1:18:49] once again
[1:18:54] Samuel got wind of it so Samuels here
[1:19:00] yours
[1:19:59] we fail many times muchas so what
[1:20:03] happened God said I'm fed up with this
[1:20:05] because he said yes you guys rejected my
[1:20:08] Kings
[1:20:09] you rejected my Prophet
[1:20:12] you chose the king let's go here already
[1:20:14] and this is what happens
[1:20:17] when you reject God's plan
[1:20:21] he said I'm done with this
[1:20:23] he said I'm finished
[1:20:26] he said my spirit you call me
[1:20:28] spiritually
[1:20:31] Samuel Samuel you go and tell Saul
[1:20:35] that my spirit is drawn from him give me
[1:20:38] Speedway
[1:20:39] and we get to chapter 17 or chapter 16.
[1:20:45] and the Lord said unto Samuel
[1:20:50] 16 1. how long will that mourn over
[1:20:53] solve
[1:20:54] seen I have rejected
[1:20:56] him from reigning over Israel
[1:21:01] sixteen one first person Israel
[1:21:12] this is the part church this is that we
[1:21:15] failed to see if I almost aware many
[1:21:17] times we have something against the
[1:21:20] pastor
[1:21:21] something against the ministry
[1:21:24] because the word of God comes forward
[1:21:27] but you don't see this part
[1:21:32] are you mourning for the people
[1:21:36] why are you crying for
[1:22:08] [Music]
[1:22:30] and Samuel took the Horn of oil
[1:22:34] and anointed him in the midst of his
[1:22:37] brother and this is David he's doing
[1:22:38] this too and the spirit of the Lord Came
[1:22:41] Upon David
[1:22:43] from that day someone forward
[1:22:54] Samuel Rose
[1:23:01] so when did the Spirit come upon David
[1:23:05] from that day
[1:23:07] how many of us have had that
[1:23:10] from that day God our property God says
[1:23:16] that David was anointed
[1:23:23] they even knew that he was King David he
[1:23:27] knew that he was something special
[1:23:29] the prophet God said
[1:23:31] David killed the lion
[1:23:34] he killed the bear he knew that God was
[1:23:38] alive
[1:23:40] before that day
[1:23:42] but that day was something different
[1:23:46] the problem
[1:23:50] David something happened
[1:23:53] he said Samuel didn't just pour a couple
[1:23:55] of drops on itself
[1:23:59] poured that whole horde of oil on it
[1:24:03] that was a king
[1:24:05] that God had thrown
[1:24:08] that was the mouthpiece that's right
[1:24:13] no you go back in history
[1:24:16] you see many of these great prophets
[1:24:21] many of these great Saints
[1:24:23] when God moved down the street
[1:24:26] they raised the standards
[1:24:30] they raised it up they said this is what
[1:24:34] God is doing
[1:24:36] that's what gave the people yes
[1:24:43] because what did Abraham do yeah
[1:24:46] he told his wife he says I'm going up
[1:24:50] there
[1:24:51] he says I'm not coming out you know
[1:24:53] until God answers
[1:25:07] and he was afraid to go annoyed
[1:25:13] the scripture says that God told him you
[1:25:15] go
[1:25:16] through this again
[1:25:18] Saul doesn't need to know what's
[1:25:20] happening
[1:25:22] you annoyed David
[1:25:24] but you go do a sacrifice before
[1:25:29] you go
[1:25:32] here's David now he's anointed Prophet
[1:25:37] God said he in his heart
[1:25:42] but when he goes
[1:25:45] and you find him
[1:25:48] with his brothers Hermanos now here now
[1:25:51] look at it from a different point of
[1:25:53] view here
[1:25:55] now look at it as God raising the
[1:25:59] standards everything
[1:26:05] is
[1:26:09] [Music]
[1:26:54] oh there's this great Giant Goliath
[1:26:58] and he's the one that's out there
[1:27:01] he says why are you guys
[1:27:03] so dismayed
[1:27:10] are y'all sad
[1:27:12] see here he goes raising the standard
[1:27:17] because here we go back to the malachite
[1:27:21] you heard them make the challenge
[1:27:25] David says how dare this on circumcised
[1:27:36] um
[1:27:39] defy the armies of the Living God
[1:27:42] how dare him
[1:27:46] so he looked at his brother
[1:27:48] what are you doing
[1:27:58] and hearing of the word of God
[1:28:05] that word begins to get into action
[1:28:08] how dare you come on they file the
[1:28:12] armies
[1:28:16] and his brothers something must have
[1:28:19] happened
[1:28:23] we're the armies of the Living God
[1:28:26] crazy
[1:28:28] it was crazy
[1:28:31] David calm down
[1:28:34] you're just a righty little kid
[1:28:37] he said no but they are defiling
[1:28:41] how did he go to Goliath
[1:28:45] foreign
[1:29:16] that's what they used to beat him with
[1:29:18] loss
[1:29:22] I wonder why he would say dogs he knew
