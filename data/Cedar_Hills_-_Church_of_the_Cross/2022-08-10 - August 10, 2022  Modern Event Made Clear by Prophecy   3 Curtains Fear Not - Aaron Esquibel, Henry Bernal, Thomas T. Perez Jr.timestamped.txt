[40:15] uh we're grateful to the lord for for
[40:18] all that that he has done for us
[40:22] grateful
[40:41] a subject matter in all of this as
[40:43] you're going to see it
[40:48] uh but do not fear and we're gonna we'll
[40:51] we'll end up into why we do not fear
[40:55] uh
[40:57] and so
[40:58] so the greatness of god and what he has
[41:01] done for us
[41:04] we're gonna go from
[41:29] [Music]
[41:32] there's many many many curtains
[41:35] that we're going to find out
[41:38] and uh we we've seen
[41:40] the news lately
[41:43] and and uh we're we're not uh we're not
[41:46] shy of what what is going on
[41:51] we see how the the it's the revival of
[41:54] it seems like the iron curtain
[41:59] and uh and and it's also looks like the
[42:02] bamboo curtain they're they're rattling
[42:04] sabers there in uh they're by taiwan
[42:12] they make their noises
[42:31] as you have heard our our pastor
[42:33] speaking uh i i don't know how many
[42:35] people have you uh uh uh have have heard
[42:38] the message
[42:42] he's spoken
[42:55] parallel number number
[43:10] you'll find out exactly
[43:12] what what all of this is about
[43:15] exactly
[43:17] and i do want to start off with this
[43:21] uh
[43:22] uh my my my father uh
[43:24] he uh
[43:25] he uh a
[43:28] great great man of god that saw
[43:30] further than than than the time that he
[43:33] lives in my father
[43:37] but he he said this in the met in
[43:41] a positive examination of a christian
[43:43] life part two examination
[43:48] and he uh it was with the subtitle the
[43:51] antichrist and the antichrist
[43:57] don't fear he says the iron curtain
[44:02] but fear the purple curtains
[44:06] and
[44:15] and so we're going to go into a little
[44:17] bit upon the threads of it
[44:21] the reason that i read joelle chapter 1
[44:24] and verse 4
[44:28] is that we're seeing what these insects
[44:31] have eaten
[44:34] and as the prophet of god says this
[44:37] cankerworm
[44:42] itself into the bark
[44:48] he began to
[44:59] and so that is what the ministry of the
[45:01] seventh angel was the minister of the
[45:04] septim was to restore back all the
[45:06] things that were lost
[45:10] if we really understand of why why god
[45:12] had to send brother branham
[45:15] the church had gotten away so far from
[45:18] scripture
[45:21] because they did not would not believe
[45:24] it
[45:25] because the catholic church believed
[45:29] that the bible
[45:33] of the catholic church
[45:36] but they also believe that they have the
[45:38] power to change scripture
[45:42] this was the great debate of brother
[45:44] branham against the these people yes
[45:49] is that the word of god
[45:51] it is unchangeable
[45:55] it does it is god in print forms
[46:13] that's a that's why there was so many
[46:15] other books added to scripture
[46:19] as in what is called the catholic bible
[46:23] and when we talk about tonight about
[46:25] catholics
[46:30] [Music]
[46:43] and that's very very important
[46:46] you know this is what i love about
[46:48] brother branham's his attitude
[46:51] and the way he was
[46:53] when they when they gave him an audience
[46:55] with the pope
[46:58] he uh
[46:59] he said well you're gonna walk in
[47:02] here
[47:03] then we gotta cut the cuffs off your
[47:05] trousers
[47:07] and then you gotta kneel down and kiss
[47:09] his finger
[47:12] i won't i'll call him reverend
[47:16] i'll call him sir
[47:18] but i will not kneel down to anyone
[47:20] except to god
[47:27] would have left the vatican in a huff
[47:29] and they would have just ran away
[47:33] not brother branham
[47:35] he had a healing service
[47:51] has them balanced
[47:53] go ahead because i won't stop
[47:55] it's all right
[47:56] keep going
[47:58] so uh
[48:00] we're living in some interesting times
[48:03] as we're all aware of
[48:06] and as we were uh studying this topic of
[48:08] curtains
[48:14] i just began to think you know
[48:16] real basic
[48:19] what is a curtain
[48:22] you know it's as simple as you can make
[48:24] it's santan
[48:26] it's a covering
[48:28] it keeps something hid
[48:32] so for example behind this curtain
[48:36] there could be a
[48:37] cage lion back there they said
[48:42] but the whole point of it is
[48:45] you don't know what's behind that no
[48:54] [Music]
[48:59] it's not necessarily
[49:01] the curtain itself is implemented la
[49:03] cortina it's what lies behind that
[49:08] and i'm so glad that we have a prophet
[49:13] who was a master at pulling the curtain
[49:24] you see this curtain called the iron
[49:26] curtain vest is
[49:57] and so real quick you know what is a
[49:59] curtain in the natural
[50:02] natural
[50:04] you know it dates back
[50:05] all the way to like
[50:08] i from what i read it was egyptian times
[50:10] but um
[50:17] an early civilization they would get the
[50:18] hides of animals
[50:23] animals you know i picture maybe an ox
[50:30] got a big high that you'd be able to
[50:31] cover a doorway with
[50:33] a quest
[50:36] and what it would do is it keep out the
[50:37] cool draft you look at it
[50:54] but what got me as i was just kind of
[50:55] looking into the history of curtains
[51:00] we went from a natural
[51:02] uh skin that came from blood
[51:09] and now these days we've moved on to a
[51:11] more modern fabric
[51:17] and i'm quoting this from the site it
[51:18] says easier to work with
[51:22] so people can choose just about any
[51:24] style they want
[51:28] they're easier to clean
[51:32] and with proper care
[51:35] your curtains are going to look their
[51:36] best for a longer time loss
[51:48] you know what was man trying to do after
[51:49] the fall
[51:54] he tried to go find whatever he could
[51:56] find to cover himself
[52:00] you know just a quick covering it looked
[52:02] good
[52:15] makes you look better for a little while
[52:20] hides all your stuff
[52:24] everything comes out on wash day though
[52:26] right
[52:29] and that's what this covering was yes
[52:33] it went from a sacrifice of blood
[52:36] and the reason i say that is because we
[52:38] know that god covered adam and eve
[52:46] and as
[52:46] civilization has moved on
[52:50] without growing that i'm almost uh
[52:54] can i see the most popular something
[52:55] more modern
[52:58] nobody wants the blood anymore
[53:02] and so you know that's kind of the lines
[53:04] i was thinking
[53:07] and then so i started thinking on uh
[53:09] you know the spiritual
[53:12] the
[53:12] piano
[53:14] and brother branham just to put it i'm
[53:16] not going to read the whole quote but he
[53:17] just says everyone who's born into this
[53:19] world
[53:23] he always wants to look beyond that
[53:24] curtain
[53:28] now this curtain i'm talking about now
[53:30] yes
[53:32] it's a lot like this bamboo iron and
[53:34] purple
[53:37] bamboo
[53:38] it's more of a i guess a metaphor esque
[53:43] it wouldn't i'm not talking about a
[53:44] literal bamboo curtain
[53:49] bamboo in this curtain of time
[53:53] behind there
[54:17] but in the book of revelations
[54:20] this generate this age that we're living
[54:23] in
[54:27] they're poor blind
[54:29] miserables
[54:32] naked
[54:34] so in other words
[54:36] even if they want to see it
[54:39] it's not revealed to them
[54:42] and so is it with this this question
[54:45] that so many people want answers
[54:50] it takes a profit
[55:02] and so
[55:03] you know it's this question came to mind
[55:06] you know the whole world
[55:08] the bible will give you the answers to
[55:10] those questions by the way
[55:14] so my question is why you know the
[55:16] bible's probably the number one selling
[55:17] book in the world
[55:30] then why is it that the whole world
[55:31] reads this bible entonces
[55:36] we read malachi 4 5.
[55:40] why is it i'm just going to talk to this
[55:41] crowd why is it that only we see that
[55:43] elijah the prophet
[55:58] and so as we go into these other these
[56:00] curtains
[56:03] just have that spiritual mentality
[56:07] and we're not really focusing on the
[56:09] curtain itself
[56:12] though we'll hit good points on that
[56:14] uh
[56:22] for i would not brethren that he should
[56:25] be ignorant of this mystery
[56:27] hermanos
[56:28] is
[56:36] romans 11 25
[56:38] lest you should be wise in your own
[56:40] conceit
[56:42] that blindness in part is happening to
[56:44] israel
[56:46] until the fullness of the gentiles be
[56:48] coming
[56:56] juan
[57:11] every every every
[57:13] thing that happens the bible says
[57:15] there's nothing new under the sun
[57:20] there's things that that
[57:22] that it seems like they go away for a
[57:23] while but yet they come back and but
[57:26] they all have a
[57:27] everything and every doctrine and
[57:29] everything
[57:32] has its its origin in the book of
[57:34] genesis
[57:36] and so you can find out that all these
[57:38] all these things
[57:41] started where what what what what what's
[57:43] the origin
[57:44] many of these of these curtains and in
[57:46] these these things
[57:49] there is a
[57:50] god god bless everybody
[58:05] and right away we get the idea of what
[58:08] it is
[58:11] and then uh it was bad
[58:14] so well is it really bad oh it's
[58:17] if i ask you as an audience
[58:24] purple curtain what's your answer is it
[58:26] bad la cortina
[58:30] it's not
[58:31] no
[58:34] so the question is
[58:37] we're taught fear not
[58:39] estamos
[58:41] you're not not the mice yeah no he just
[58:43] read a quote
[58:47] quoting brothers and i fear the purple
[59:00] you know he said i'm going to read real
[59:02] quick here brother branham
[59:05] 1961
[59:08] and i mean he's speaking today but it's
[59:10] 1961
[59:14] because it rates like this
[59:16] we see
[59:32] we see one rising yonder in china called
[59:34] the bamboo curtain
[59:39] then we see one rice called the purple
[59:41] curtain
[59:59] does say hermano branham cdc
[1:00:02] uh form an image of the beast
[1:00:05] former unimaginable exactly exactamente
[1:00:08] you don't fear communism
[1:00:10] but he says you fear catholicism
[1:00:54] he said
[1:00:55] it would come in with flatteries like a
[1:00:57] lamb
[1:01:02] but watch it
[1:01:04] because behind us that wolf is a sneaker
[1:01:08] so you watch it yesterday
[1:01:14] and the word says it has to come to pass
[1:01:19] so there's a fear
[1:01:21] that needs to be that we need to be
[1:01:22] aware not be afraid
[1:01:29] because without really reverence or
[1:01:30] respect
[1:01:32] or reverend it could very easily
[1:01:37] one person or a church or a family or a
[1:01:40] community be led by a spirit
[1:01:42] person
[1:01:46] that uh is at a purple curtain
[1:01:50] so well so so what as we said is the
[1:01:53] purple curtain really is it that bad
[1:01:55] commodity
[1:02:02] i guess not
[1:02:03] no
[1:02:04] seems like it but as you can see we talk
[1:02:06] about it like it's a bad deal
[1:02:11] well of course it's a bad deal
[1:02:12] cs it is a deceiving thing yes
[1:02:16] it it it will take you
[1:02:33] the roman empire
[1:02:35] imperial romana every
[1:02:37] bad empire that existed
[1:02:42] couldn't do anything of themselves
[1:02:46] until they first saw the lord do
[1:02:48] something with his people
[1:02:52] so let's just go now
[1:02:54] purple
[1:02:58] is a color that sits between red and
[1:03:09] you know it leans more on the bluish
[1:03:11] side
[1:03:14] but let's go to the book of exodus 26
[1:03:18] is that then a unifying color it is a
[1:03:20] unifying color
[1:03:23] that's the spirit of today
[1:03:25] it's inclusion everything is inclusion
[1:03:27] yeah
[1:03:42] is
[1:03:46] if we look at it is the highest form of
[1:03:47] mediocrity that once can see but it
[1:03:50] makes it look like that that's the way
[1:03:52] it is
[1:03:55] you ever want you ever want to get your
[1:03:56] congressman really really uh
[1:04:00] backpedaling just ask him what a woman
[1:04:05] [Music]
[1:04:07] go ahead so
[1:04:09] book of exodus
[1:04:25] 26
[1:04:26] first verse
[1:04:28] versus says moreover thou shalt make the
[1:04:30] tabernacle with 10 curtains of fine
[1:04:32] twine linen
[1:04:36] cortinas
[1:04:38] and blue
[1:04:38] [Music]
[1:04:46] of cunning work shall thou make them
[1:04:51] primo primo rosa look what this spirit
[1:04:53] how far back it's got to be able to get
[1:04:55] strength
[1:04:59] let's go to verse 6.
[1:05:03] well verse
[1:05:04] verse five and verse six verses
[1:05:07] so 50 loops shall i make on one curtain
[1:05:09] and 50 loop shall i make in the edge of
[1:05:11] the curtain that is in the coupling of
[1:05:12] the second
[1:05:14] see
[1:05:15] and the loops may take hold one of
[1:05:17] another cincuenta lasadas
[1:05:20] primera
[1:05:35] touches of gold and couple the curtains
[1:05:37] together with the tatches and it shall
[1:05:39] be one tabernacle
[1:05:45] [Music]
[1:06:03] no that's what we're saying about this
[1:06:04] purple curtain what he wants to do
[1:06:10] it was actually a holy thing
[1:06:13] it was it was a serious thing
[1:06:17] it was it was the makeup of the
[1:06:18] tabernacle
[1:06:21] because after you if you were to follow
[1:06:23] and i'll encourage you to go and read
[1:06:25] the instructions of the tabernacle
[1:06:27] it is
[1:06:41] tell him it tells him in the second and
[1:06:43] this book of ii samuel
[1:06:46] de secondo de samuel said that the king
[1:06:49] said unto nathan the prophet
[1:06:54] 2nd samuel 7 2
[1:06:56] second samuel
[1:06:59] see now i dwell in a house of cedar
[1:07:02] but the ark of god dwelleth within
[1:07:05] curtains
[1:07:13] now notice that this purple curtain is
[1:07:15] really referred towards the end and from
[1:07:17] some time
[1:07:18] this way
[1:07:24] which i find it interesting
[1:07:27] that when you speak of a tabernacle
[1:07:31] um
[1:07:34] there's not a tabernacle or an
[1:07:36] expression of a tabernacle
[1:07:40] greater than jesus christ
[1:07:43] you're saying he is
[1:07:46] a curtain or seeker
[1:07:50] because that's what that's what when
[1:07:52] people become and this is where as
[1:07:54] you're hearing brother henry henry
[1:07:56] taking it from a metaphor of a natural
[1:07:59] to when the person becomes like jesus
[1:08:02] was the tenth of god
[1:08:07] we're coming right to that
[1:08:09] so this is what david says here talking
[1:08:11] to samuel eslo
[1:08:14] well along the way
[1:08:17] israel you know how israel went israel
[1:08:20] is
[1:08:21] israel then the prophet jeremiah
[1:08:24] entonces
[1:08:26] he's talking establando the lord's
[1:08:29] speaking to him
[1:08:32] and jeremiah speaks to the people
[1:08:33] jeremiah
[1:08:38] and he says my tabernacle is spoiled
[1:08:43] all my courts are broken
[1:08:47] but children are gone forth of me
[1:09:04] my
[1:09:06] so look how i start going from something
[1:09:08] that the lord had established
[1:09:14] to
[1:09:15] move away from god through unbelief
[1:09:32] bless the lord all my soul
[1:09:36] oh lord my god
[1:09:38] what a privilege church thou art very
[1:09:41] great
[1:09:44] our clothes with honor and majesty
[1:09:52] who covers thyself with light as with a
[1:09:56] garment
[1:09:59] who stretches out the heavens like a
[1:10:01] curse
[1:10:05] now no wonder why the lord said this man
[1:10:08] is of my own heart
[1:10:13] he started seeing the change yo el
[1:10:16] cambio how
[1:10:18] i believe moved on in this curtain now
[1:10:20] he's looking how the glory of the
[1:10:22] tabernacle now looks like curtains
[1:10:28] as we're going to come close
[1:10:34] if you notice what brother branham
[1:10:36] speaks two messages that are just
[1:10:41] sound like the same but are not the same
[1:10:44] questions
[1:10:47] it's the mighty god unveiled before
[1:10:50] and then
[1:10:52] in philadelphia he preaches the
[1:10:54] unveiling of god
[1:11:52] so when you come and he starts to show
[1:11:53] you these things
[1:11:56] we start to realize that he said you
[1:11:58] don't have to fear communism
[1:12:05] it's a
[1:12:06] cool
[1:12:34] [Music]
[1:12:36] i know the colors are a little weird but
[1:12:37] we try to get the black out
[1:12:41] but let's see if i can show this a
[1:12:42] little bit
[1:12:46] everything that you see here in this big
[1:12:48] clump of color here that's that's russia
[1:12:53] this is italy yes italia this is the
[1:12:55] western european countries right this is
[1:13:00] europa when when russia wanted to put a
[1:13:02] curtain
[1:13:09] what's black that's what the curtain has
[1:13:10] been placed
[1:13:13] so i was sharing with the brothers there
[1:13:15] that you know how as as the map of
[1:13:18] montana has the the pro
[1:13:20] profile of brother brian i'm looking
[1:13:22] towards hollywood for judge
[1:13:28] california then there's also a profile
[1:13:31] they're looking down to the european
[1:13:33] countries
[1:13:43] they did that they drew their own
[1:13:50] i didn't put those lines there that's
[1:13:51] how this is described as as does the
[1:13:53] iron curtain
[1:13:54] where it's been placed
[1:13:58] this curtain was still up when brother
[1:14:00] branham comes yes
[1:14:07] and there was russian soldiers on that
[1:14:10] what you call that curtain
[1:14:22] okay
[1:14:23] this is what the man on the other side
[1:14:25] of the curtain said that
[1:14:36] the little boy to this side of that girl
[1:14:45] [Applause]
[1:14:50] go ahead go ahead
[1:14:52] so does everybody know what we're
[1:14:53] talking about when we say iron curtain
[1:15:23] iron curtain that's what we're referring
[1:15:25] to
[1:15:27] referendum and it's important to know
[1:15:28] it's important
[1:15:30] that uh communism
[1:15:33] it's an anti-god
[1:15:36] system
[1:15:53] and so i was reading what brother
[1:15:54] branham said
[1:15:57] it might have been in 1954
[1:16:01] don't quote me on the year but he said a
[1:16:03] hundred years ago he says the holy
[1:16:06] spirit fell in russia
[1:16:09] just like it did at the day of pentecost
[1:16:13] so 100 years before that
[1:16:17] and he said but what happened is they
[1:16:19] turned it away look at passover
[1:16:22] they didn't want nothing to do with it
[1:16:24] so what happened
[1:16:26] they became very he i believe he says
[1:16:29] they were like brutes
[1:16:32] very
[1:16:36] and that spirit of communism took over
[1:16:41] and you know that was just an
[1:16:43] interesting fact there
[1:16:46] it goes
[1:17:07] you know so that's uh
[1:17:09] that's the purpose behind this curtain
[1:17:11] of uh russia
[1:17:14] is
[1:17:42] [Music]
[1:18:21] let's go a little further than that i
[1:18:23] was
[1:18:32] was a tabernacle with where god would
[1:18:35] tabernacle himself
[1:18:41] that was the
[1:18:43] also the beginning of
[1:18:46] the
[1:18:47] how this purple curtain starts to grow
[1:18:49] strength
[1:18:55] all right
[1:18:56] so
[1:18:56] let's let's let's talk about what were
[1:18:58] we talking about let's talk about
[1:19:00] not the cat not the catholic people
[1:19:02] catholicism
[1:19:05] universal catholic
[1:19:09] absolutely we went and researched it and
[1:19:10] that's exactly what it means
[1:19:12] yeah it's sacramento it's universal and
[1:19:14] and there's a lot of things that we can
[1:19:16] say you know
[1:19:19] so in this purple
[1:19:22] robe or or this this purple curtain
[1:19:26] covering
[1:19:26] [Music]
[1:19:29] well i want to know why why catholics
[1:19:31] will put purple on anyway
[1:20:14] this was
[1:20:15] a significant part of christian history
[1:20:21] because
[1:20:22] the emperor constantine had just
[1:20:24] legalized christianity
[1:20:30] a few years before isa nismo
[1:20:32] now christians were not no longer
[1:20:34] persecuted
[1:20:37] they were able to make more formal
[1:20:40] doctrinal rules and regulate regulate
[1:20:42] christian practices
[1:20:53] the form of christianity approved and
[1:20:56] nicea became the official religion of
[1:20:58] the roman empire
[1:21:02] [Music]
[1:21:07] so this purple it says here we're not
[1:21:09] going to read all this but we're just
[1:21:10] going to mention this here
[1:21:13] this purple here brings some aspects
[1:21:17] and he said we first must remember
[1:21:21] that during his passion
[1:21:24] jesus was dressed in a purple robe jesus
[1:21:35] and it was the most expensive color
[1:21:37] available in the roman empire
[1:21:48] that when they they clothed him with
[1:21:50] purple says the scripture
[1:21:54] and they plattered
[1:22:00] but they did this just to mock them
[1:22:04] and after they did that
[1:22:06] they removed that purple rose
[1:22:16] and we're recognizing he is the highest
[1:22:19] person to be honored so we gave him the
[1:22:21] highest most expensive
[1:22:23] roman covering which is a purple
[1:22:26] mascara
[1:22:31] so this tabernacle
[1:22:34] this this in a curtain of light in a
[1:22:36] cortina
[1:22:50] what this religion had started
[1:22:53] when took over christianism
[1:22:57] so this is this is this is when pagan
[1:23:00] rome is
[1:23:17] and
[1:23:18] start forcing it ever since
[1:23:22] it's it's i mean if we go if we go
[1:23:24] through through uh catholicism
[1:23:29] and the meanings of it is significant
[1:23:31] they claim as you said
[1:23:34] the catholicism was started as a result
[1:23:36] of jesus of nazareth
[1:23:41] a jewish man whom christians believe is
[1:23:43] the son of god
[1:24:01] of the church
[1:24:04] and how they follow
[1:24:06] of course it has all the history on it
[1:24:08] but we're not going to read it we're
[1:24:09] just going to just mention how how
[1:24:12] how evil it has become once i must
[1:24:14] mention
[1:24:20] many of the churches began because of
[1:24:22] disagreements over belief and practice
[1:24:24] foreign
[1:24:32] think that the reforms didn't go far
[1:24:34] enough
[1:24:38] so they still believe that this needs to
[1:24:40] be enforced to be reformed completely
[1:24:46] so they said that uh
[1:24:48] the aspect of catholics and other
[1:24:50] christians
[1:24:53] christians they believe in god that god
[1:24:55] knows everything
[1:25:10] rose
[1:25:24] they're the highest
[1:25:34] when they speak about jesus
[1:25:38] not speaking about
[1:25:52] on
[1:25:54] it then became jesus and mary
[1:25:57] jesus
[1:25:58] this is this is this is a a a talk that
[1:26:01] i had with a with a gentleman one time
[1:26:06] he
[1:26:21] the scripture that paul paul comes back
[1:26:25] this is what this is what our pastor
[1:26:27] said on sundays
[1:26:30] one revelation
[1:26:32] there cannot be a second revolution
[1:26:38] [Music]
[1:27:30] highest form
[1:27:32] paganism
[1:27:34] where they have the right to take away
[1:27:36] from the world
[1:27:38] the apostle paul would say
[1:27:40] later this year
[1:27:43] or an angel
[1:28:40] absolutely
[1:28:52] [Music]
[1:29:04] and
[1:29:05] roman catholic church
[1:29:07] romana
[1:29:12] is a visible society of baptized
[1:29:15] christians
[1:29:16] [Music]
[1:29:18] professing the same faith under the
[1:29:20] authority of the invisible head christ
[1:29:33] the pope and the bishops in communion
[1:29:35] with him
[1:29:47] because
[1:29:48] bring it this is not what we want
[1:29:58] i like to continue to follow more what
[1:30:00] david was going how he knows that
[1:30:02] he changed but he followed the lord
[1:30:17] and he's asking brother bosswork
[1:30:20] he said now the father didn't know what
[1:30:22] he would what he would be speaking of
[1:30:24] the sun
[1:30:27] when he was born
[1:30:29] he might be a gangster a gangster he
[1:30:31] said
[1:30:38] [Music]
[1:30:40] he can turn his kingdom and his things
[1:30:42] his work over that boy
[1:30:44] do not
[1:31:01] and the tutor which you know in our case
[1:31:03] is the holy spirit
[1:31:06] that takes the word
[1:31:08] to the father
[1:31:09] and gives report of what he do
[1:31:14] if
[1:31:28] a purple robe was put on him
[1:31:33] and there was a law of adoption
[1:31:38] look how significant and how serious and
[1:31:41] sacred
[1:31:42] purple meant
[1:32:03] she make it herself covering of tapestry
[1:32:05] her clothing is silk and purple
[1:32:09] is the purple
[1:32:11] her husband is known in the case when
[1:32:13] he's seated among the elders of the land
[1:32:16] [Music]
[1:32:22] verse 25 gives us the definition of
[1:32:24] purple versus
[1:32:49] [Music]
[1:32:53] you know they could never progress
[1:32:55] or be successful unless they took it
[1:32:57] from the scriptures
[1:33:01] impossible
[1:33:05] now concerning the and i'm not going to
[1:33:08] say no more
[1:33:10] but i want to bring one point that is
[1:33:12] very interesting
[1:33:16] is very much attached to
[1:33:18] uh terrorism
[1:33:33] anybody nobody
[1:33:47] you know that outside of catholics
[1:33:50] the worship of mary
[1:33:55] equally worship
[1:33:59] under other names
[1:34:01] are the
[1:34:02] muslims muslims
[1:34:05] one of the main and most
[1:34:07] uh reversed doctrines of that they hold
[1:34:13] is is
[1:34:14] is mary it's very similar how they
[1:34:17] pronounce it
[1:34:20] the mother of of us is the the mother
[1:34:24] the the diocese which translated is
[1:34:26] jesus translator
[1:34:28] significa
[1:34:30] which is
[1:34:58] was actually trained by jesuit priests
[1:35:04] in order to come against the
[1:35:07] uh
[1:35:08] the
[1:35:08] israelites
[1:35:14] they sent jude a jesuit priest to train
[1:35:17] mohammed
[1:35:23] the inclusion because the principles of
[1:35:25] faith are
[1:35:27] pretty much i mean they're so similar
[1:35:31] it's just some some terms and and and
[1:35:33] name changes as far as the principles
[1:35:35] they're they're saying
[1:35:39] now whoever whoever gets it from here on
[1:35:41] the king of the of the south
[1:35:46] goes in the other way
[1:35:47] yes sir
[1:35:51] oh
[1:35:52] tell us something
[1:35:53] you know i don't know if you're having
[1:35:55] as much fun as we are
[1:35:58] but
[1:35:59] but it it it is our time is uh is we're
[1:36:03] already at an hour yes
[1:36:05] we're gonna we're gonna start wrapping
[1:36:07] wrapping this
[1:36:08] up
[1:36:21] because i kind of concentrated with the
[1:36:23] purple is that how he's moved and
[1:36:25] changed
[1:36:28] go ahead because i'll start
[1:36:32] i'm gonna just mention a couple things
[1:36:34] because i know you have something from
[1:36:35] the problem
[1:36:44] because we think of the
[1:36:45] purple curtain on the bamboo curtain as
[1:36:48] things of the past
[1:37:02] reported that a new iron current was
[1:37:04] descending between moscow and the west
[1:37:11] he says that russian economy uh sweeping
[1:37:14] sanctions imposed in the west have
[1:37:16] brought down a new iron curtain to the
[1:37:18] russian economy
[1:37:22] now it's hitting every facet now you
[1:37:23] ever see how it goes yeah freezing tens
[1:37:25] of billions of dollars
[1:37:28] now that's the threat
[1:37:44] it was not that people with those social
[1:37:46] educational or professional ties to the
[1:37:48] united states and western europe
[1:37:53] europa these are russians that have ties
[1:37:56] with united states and western europe
[1:38:00] america europa are trying to break
[1:38:03] through the digital iron curtain
[1:38:06] virtual private network
[1:38:10] virtual private networks
[1:38:13] virtual
[1:38:23] and then other sites that are russian
[1:38:25] jack it's the yandex or yandell some
[1:38:28] i wanna
[1:38:39] it goes back to how this guy wound up in
[1:38:40] russia regardless of covering himself i
[1:38:42] remember four years ago
[1:38:44] well it's all coming up this is this is
[1:38:46] recent stuff
[1:38:51] that the bamboo curtain
[1:38:53] bamboo
[1:38:53] used to most often be referred as the
[1:38:56] enclosed borders and economy
[1:39:00] though it began to open in 2010
[1:39:04] the bamboo current
[1:39:06] has since
[1:39:08] picados
[1:39:09] giving way of the sentences giving way
[1:39:12] to the business model called the bamboo
[1:39:14] network
[1:39:21] the bamboo
[1:39:22] bamboo there's chinese people all over
[1:39:24] the world
[1:39:39] that fell off
[1:39:41] a few years ago they there was someone
[1:39:43] it was a spy plane that was that was
[1:39:45] brought down
[1:39:49] maybe it's
[1:39:50] a joke and it doesn't doesn't doesn't
[1:40:13] and it sounds funny but it's the it's
[1:40:15] it's the case
[1:40:26] do you know that the beginning of that
[1:40:28] curtain started when the chinese
[1:40:30] asked the western countries
[1:40:34] [Music]
[1:40:48] and it started with a ping-pong game
[1:40:52] what was it called ping-pong diplomacy
[1:40:57] diplomacy
[1:40:59] so at the state of the union address
[1:41:02] the the
[1:41:12] so a specialist in color
[1:41:15] says color sends a message
[1:41:28] so does purple mean when it comes to
[1:41:30] politics
[1:41:43] it carries some meanings from both
[1:41:45] colors
[1:41:48] you're communicating the trustworthiness
[1:41:49] from the blue
[1:41:51] candle
[1:41:53] as well as some red the power
[1:41:57] the power
[1:41:58] the in charge side of red
[1:42:00] color
[1:42:03] and this this person from washington dc
[1:42:06] is the person of the washington dc it
[1:42:08] says they're unifying
[1:42:11] that's the message of purple
[1:42:23] [Music]
[1:42:45] i don't think any of these panels have
[1:42:46] ever been done
[1:42:52] so real quick recap we have
[1:42:54] russia iron curtain cortina
[1:42:57] anti-god encounter
[1:42:59] we have uh rome thermos roma
[1:43:02] anti-christ spirit christos spiritual
[1:43:04] safe to say that's a religious spirit
[1:43:06] there is start off with
[1:43:22] want to fill you in on an ancient
[1:43:24] chinese secret
[1:43:28] it's by soon
[1:43:32] he was a chinese general
[1:43:36] and what he says
[1:43:38] the supreme art of war
[1:43:42] the highest form of war
[1:43:45] it's not to fire shots
[1:43:48] it's not to go conquer your enemy
[1:44:13] and that's exactly what china has
[1:44:16] taken on with the united states
[1:44:27] we do all our manufacturing over there
[1:44:29] as our as brother tommy was just saying
[1:44:32] uh
[1:44:41] real quick so china's gotten too big too
[1:44:43] fast in other words
[1:44:46] they have three million three hundred
[1:44:48] and fifty five
[1:44:49] tres mionas through uh
[1:44:52] thousand
[1:44:53] military numbers
[1:44:56] just to give you a reference we're at
[1:44:57] two million two hundred thirty three
[1:45:00] fifty
[1:45:26] robots
[1:45:28] robots tunnels
[1:45:31] and then uh as far as medications
[1:45:35] i know our pastors spoke on this
[1:45:38] but they make eighty percent of
[1:45:40] america's pharmaceutical drug supply
[1:45:45] that's our
[1:45:46] sorry
[1:45:47] that's our antibiotics antibiotics our
[1:45:51] over-the-counter pain medications
[1:45:55] important heart meds like coumadin
[1:46:00] all manufactured in china those
[1:46:02] manufactured
[1:46:03] so what's the deal with that
[1:46:07] well think back when the pandemic first
[1:46:08] broke out
[1:46:41] so all these uh going back to that quote
[1:46:44] of uh
[1:46:45] the highest form of warfare
[1:46:49] if china decided tomorrow hey we're
[1:46:51] cutting you off of your medications
[1:46:56] we're cutting you off all these uh major
[1:46:58] exports that we sent to you all
[1:47:03] that's a
[1:47:05] that's a weapon of war is
[1:47:12] [Music]
[1:47:33] again it's a communistic red china is
[1:47:36] communistic
[1:47:40] and
[1:47:42] yeah that's what we have as far as those
[1:47:44] go
[1:47:47] one last and you can take
[1:48:24] that's good
[1:48:32] and behold the veil of the temple was
[1:48:35] rhett and twain from the top to the
[1:48:37] bottom and the earth did quake and the
[1:48:39] rocks rent
[1:48:42] and that was when
[1:48:43] the bale or the
[1:48:58] the prophet of god
