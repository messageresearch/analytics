the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready it is of a great importance to us I took took took a liberty to to to take go to the sacred scripture the Bible tells us then Joshua called 12 men whom he had prepared for the children of Israel out of every tribe of man and Josh was said unto them pass over before the Ark of the Lord your God into the midst of Jordan and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel that this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean ye by these Stones then he shall answer them that the Waters of Jordan were cut off before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord when it passed over Jordan the Waters of Jordan were cut off and these Stones shall be a memorial unto the children of Israel forever 60 years does not happen overnight 60 years is is a legacy it is done by people that believe God's word growing up first place we ever come was any anything ever happened in the Pettis family we always went to uncle Ross and at Ruth's house it was just a simple place we'll see you there everyone knew where there was at and we're thankful to the life that God has given them and has showed upon us their life is a memorial to us and anybody ever want to know what 60 years looks like and what the Triumph of life is is you see a living example here today as my papa got sick the the greatness of their lives was to Simply serve and they took care of and have take care of my my Our Father throughout all these years that he's been sick they've taken such great care of him who can replace those things who can imitate those things well we have shining examples of whom to follow when Joshua asks the people they were asked to take up a stone and make a memorial this today is a memorial not of not of of yesterday but a great thing of what God is doing today is it possible in this last time that people can live together for 60 years and the answer is yes does it has a cost it has cost but the pot the Bible's promises to each and every one of us is the truth and the way the way that Jesus Christ said I I am the way the truth and the life and no man cometh to the father but by me and this marriage and these two lovely people that to me are greater today what a what a stunning beauty of a lady what a handsome man this is what God does this is a memorial to the faithfulness of almighty God as my grandfather would always would tell me and look at me and as he would celebrate

couple words um growing up I was at my Aunt Ruth and Uncle Ross's house more than my own house my mom growing as up as a kid would uh restrain us from the refrigerator because we did everything in one day right Matt so I had to go to Matt Ruth and you could have at it you didn't have to ask you'd open the fridge and get whatever you wanted the good stuff but when my parents passed away I can remember at Ruth and uncle Ross coming to my house and telling me and I asked him I said is it okay if you be my my mom and dad now and they said of course so my Aunt Ruth and uncle Ross are like my

definitely the glue that keeps our family together may the Lord continue to bless your marriage for many many years to come I admire the love you have for each other it's a beautiful thing thank you for being a great example as Christians you both definitely definitely live for others and I see Jesus Christ in you I love and appreciate you more than you could ever know love your daughter Pam [Applause] foreign we're going to reveal what's hidden behind the seventh seal you know the mystery uh-huh from Hanover yes it's me you all of you she was the only done in Arnold good to see you she was the only valid Victorian in our family not Tommy not me but her wow and as smart as you were you chose this guy to marry me don't you read the Bible the Bible says because you're gonna go you're still Thin Beautiful the only thing was the color of your hair that changed but it was just such a beautiful girl and you'll go in so easy when that time comes myself is going to be a tight squeeze and you don't you know the Bible it says narrow is the gate yeah so how are you going to make it but it's a double barrel shotgun I can tell you because you're my buddy I don't know how that happened but anyway my sister Ruth once up we were talking and she said you're supposed to be a teacher and don't you know that an angel came down and took a picture of us between the ages of 1825 when we looked the best now I remember one time I was out of state in this church they invited me to preach that Sunday morning after we were through or I was through took me to the fellowship hall and gave us you know we ate there and had Fellowship and one Minister while we were reading came up and said brother lung he said today me and my wife are are celebrating 47 years of marriage it is what do you mean but don't worry there is a place in heaven for Abused woman so so then she tells me he said don't you know that the angel came down and took a picture of him when you got married now I'm gonna make you feel good this guy tell me this guy lived in Los Angeles he could have gone to Hollywood and make some movies this guy was a handsome guy is I've been using pictures of him he got a lot of hair handsome guy that's so then well look look at him now so then Ruth said you know what land I don't care how big he gets I got more to love it that's right human body so then Russ comes in the picture and says you know what that angel came by and when I got married he took a picture of me but what about you what about you when the angel came down and this ascended up again the Lord asked the angel what about the picture of my son Abraham I said serve forgive me he's so ugly he had no good sights so I didn't I didn't take a picture of him anyway he's trying to relax you because um we joke and get together and we love each other but still what is the mystery under the seven seal that how in the world someone from Hanover met somebody from your face the poor guy did not have nobody to play with only with rattlesnakes and jack rabbits you know but I remember he and your father tell me I I think I don't know if they went to San Pedro to speak you guys didn't know Los Angeles you know and they found an old beat-up car and just side of the road somewhere and I know they stole it or paid one of the guys in skid rows about 25 so here they come in little car he was taking once in a while to San Diego to the naval base and the car died on the stop sign and guess who was behind the car it was a funeral procession see that director gonna get that junk of the roof and then rusted will we can move it so he hit the the funeral director and some guys from the other cars and helped push that Sherman tank that thing was so heavy that old remember you call it the Mexican Mercedes-Benz [Music] so the morticians said you know what one of these days you and your friend are gonna die with that car not too long part of the prophecy came right the year they will go I don't know about one or two in the morning back to San Diego and as they were driving down the freeway to San Diego the car exploded exploded and caught on fire they got down it started hitchhiking and the car just burned in the middle of the freeway so that we got good stories don't we anyway I still love you I still love I love you people remind me about the woman that made out a room for the prophet the prophet would press from his cave and they said we're gonna make a room for him remember and God bless her she they always open the doors and we used to have beautiful Bible studies remember in your house and what stopped us was a pandemic you know it's tough to so to finish because we could stay a long time but and to finish um you would go when somebody would go and he said you were kind of lonely so he invited you once I think to Santa Fe Springs to my brother David's house and uh you got to start getting along real well with them and one time Mary remember Arnold Mary had arms like Papa I remember and my brother David walked on eggshells around my my sister-in-law Mary nobody she could beat anybody in the house and we knew it so we you know and and you and she made some red chili and you said oh Mary this chili is so hot and she said shut up and eat it you're gonna Spanish girls to be your wife you're gonna have to eat Mexican food you know and he did and there he still is you know because of that anyway me and my brother were wrong you know my father had more discernment because Mary thy answered tummy is that Mary adopted him he went through the and he was adopted which all of us have to be and she adopted it loved him so much that she put a big picture of US during the living room but my father had more discernment than gentami ha is that day you got married Russ you won the lottery how many inches how many inches the promised land over 2 million came out and only two made it into the promised land from the the first generation Joshua and Caleb and you're one in a million one in a million two and I love you so much you know and you've still my friend and I love both of you God bless you [Applause] amen I I truly they made a one of the greatest honors of my life Ministry to be able to be up here and uh to uh be able to give a renewal of vows to such a wonderful couple and you both look beautiful and it's a pleasure to be called your nephew yeah I deem it a great privilege and and also to be called your pastor um it's a pleasure and a privilege for me you know I as I was as I was uh as we get into the to the vows uh just look up and I found out that of everyone that gets married only one percent ever reached 60 years that's six decades together 700 720 months together 3120 weeks 21 915 days 525 960 hours 31 557 600 minutes and one billion 893 million four hundred and fifty six seconds what a ride what a span of time I always remember uncle Ross and he was a great cook one day he decided he was going to make chicken so he put the chicken in the crock pot forgot to put water in there when they got back they opened up the crock pot and how they didn't burn down the house but I hear it was this little black charcoal chicken left wow the symbol of the diamond has represented the 60th wedding anniversary it is the hardest naturally occurring substance on planet Earth diamonds represent the endearing strength of a marriage that has bonded two people together for this long prophet of God says in the message what is the attraction on the mountain that's about the way it is today in the religious crowds when it really comes down to the word in Christ there's only about one percent that really believe about a feat you see to hear and to be part of this 60 years together uh as you all have accomplished this I uh I had a hat on I would take it off and I would tip my hat to you all he says the great Forerunner that has gone before us making a way he came from Spirit the great Fountains of the rainbow of God who had no beginning or no end he was forever God this ray of light went forth it was a ray of love that's the main one he says it's red the next colors that follows blue and on and on and on after that all these seven perfect colors that come from the diamond seven perfect colors which is the seven spirits of God that went for forth from that great fountain or that great Diamond that Jesus spoke of that great Diamond was chipped to reflect these colors and God was made flesh and dwelt amongst us that he might reflect his goodness and his Mercy Among Us by gifts and signs and wonders that whole big rainbow had become in a theophany made in the image of a man yet he wasn't a man he didn't have flesh yet he was a theophany and that was God he had to be wounded for our transgression Bruce for our iniquities he is the big diamond and when you cut a diamond did you ever notice you cut it in a three cornered shape and the sun against that will reflect seven colors and looking red through red looks white did you know that red through red that's the blood the red blood looking God looking at a red sinner through his red blood turns him white he is in the heart you see and so now in that I said God chipped cut bruised to reflect in these Rays as it hits It's the Great word of God it reflects what God really is and so in understanding this and you've reached the diamond wow let's go into the vows and so the first question I want to ask do you wish to continue to live with this lady by all means I do is there anything you want to tell her well I was thinking of what the Elder told me thank you always tell her that after all these years you still make my liver clever and my bladder clatter his liver quiver and his bladder bladder keep it going that's good stuff make sure I write
