[1:43] [Music]
[1:45] ephesus was not a deceived church
[1:48] it failed itself but not continuing in
[1:51] perfect love

[2:03] paradise promise to the overcomers
[2:06] of the saints of ephesus in the church
[2:09] age
[2:10] given to the tree of life now we see
[2:13] this at the beginning pentecost
[2:16] walking around the same great god the
[2:18] same great signs
[2:20] were to take place all down through
[2:22] these ages because he
[2:24] walked amongst each age blessing one
[2:28] his people that's the symbol in his
[2:31] name i want you to watch this
[2:35] as we go through the church this church
[2:37] had jesus name
[2:39] and this church lost it now the first
[2:42] verse
[2:43] what's he doing he's saluting them
[2:45] [Music]
[2:46] haunted on to the angel of the church of
[2:50] ephesus the john
[2:51] write these things said he that holds
[2:54] seven
[2:55] stars in his right hand who walk up in
[2:57] the midst of the seven
[2:59] golden candlesticks it's a salute
[3:02] now the second verse and the third verse
[3:06] he commands them i
[3:09] know thy works and our labors and uh
[3:12] patience
[3:13] how the thou cannot bear them which are
[3:16] evil
[3:17] and thou hast tried them which say they
[3:19] are apostles
[3:20] and are not and have found them liars
[3:23] amen see that apostasy had
[3:26] already begun to set in this first age
[3:31] false teachers rise up people who are
[3:34] teaching wrong
[3:35] contrary to the scripture trying to
[3:38] bring in
[3:39] something or add something just don't
[3:41] meddle with god's word just
[3:42] no matter who it hurts or what it hurts
[3:44] just say it anyhow just the way it's
[3:46] rolled there that's the way man we don't
[3:48] need any
[3:48] great something else we don't need any
[3:51] priest or anything to interpret it to us
[3:53] god the holy spirit is the interpreter
[3:56] he gives interpretation see how the
[3:58] church began to get formal during that
[4:00] time
[4:01] they began to kind of break down the
[4:03] people under the inspiration of the holy
[4:05] ghost
[4:06] begin to cause people to come and make
[4:08] fun of them
[4:10] well i have people to make fun of you
[4:12] because you love the lord jesus
[4:14] is a blessing just to have the says
[4:17] they're only when they're cursing you
[4:19] they're bringing god's blessings down
[4:21] on you it backfires on
[4:24] and so is the new person there amen
[4:27] it'll make you do things that you didn't
[4:29] think you'd do
[4:30] stand on the corner be the tambourine or
[4:32] say glory to the god hallelujah praise
[4:34] god
[4:36] well you act like a maniac that's what
[4:38] it done to the apostles
[4:40] that's what i've done to the virgin mary
[4:41] she act like she was drunk
[4:44] she was a mess in society but it takes a
[4:47] mess for life to come out of
[4:49] hey man unless anything dies in rocks
[4:52] life can't come from it unless a man
[4:55] dies and rocks than his own thoughts
[4:58] christ can't get into his heart that's
[5:00] the way the church was born first
[5:03] man how many believes that god is
[5:05] infinite
[5:07] then he cannot change if that was his
[5:11] idea of the church at the beginning
[5:13] that's the kind of church you'll have at
[5:14] the end
[5:16] he cannot change how you go to
[5:19] substitute
[5:20] shaking a hand or sprinkling or or some
[5:22] other things that didn't happen right
[5:24] there
[5:25] paul went over and found people shouting
[5:27] having a big time
[5:28] bunch of badness glorifying god he said
[5:31] that's 19. he said have you received the
[5:33] holy ghost that you believe
[5:34] they said we don't want to be in the
[5:36] holy ghost said how was your time
[5:38] he said we've been baptized for the same
[5:39] man baptized
[5:41] jesus john the baptist said it won't
[5:43] work anymore he got to be baptized over
[5:45] again
[5:46] so he baptized them over again in the
[5:48] name of the lord jesus christ
[5:50] laid his hands upon him and they had the
[5:52] same kind of results that they had
[5:54] at the beginning the holy ghost fell on
[5:58] him
[5:59] they began to speak in tongues and
[6:00] prophesied
[6:02] now as i said to begin before we start
[6:04] off on this again
[6:05] every revival produces a pair of twins
[6:10] one is a spiritual man the other is the
[6:13] natural man of the earth
[6:14] i know thy works and i labor and i'm
[6:17] patient
[6:18] how that cannot bear them which are evil
[6:22] and thou hast tried them which say that
[6:24] they are
[6:25] apostles and are not and has found them
[6:28] liars he found them to be liars
[6:32] how they know that they work with the
[6:34] word
[6:35] now if a man says that this bible says
[6:38] in hebrews 13 8
[6:39] jesus christ the same yesterday and for
[6:41] every man said all the days the miracles
[6:43] just passed then that man's a liar
[6:47] now the third first noun
[6:50] all right second and third first now the
[6:52] third verse
[6:54] and is born and had patience
[6:57] and for my namesake
[7:00] has labored and has not
[7:03] fainted or my name did you know what
[7:06] they had patience
[7:08] labored for what
[7:09] [Music]
[7:11] his name if you have to do something you
[7:13] can't do in jesus name let alone
[7:16] i'm going to talk about the complaint
[7:19] now
[7:19] in the fourth chapter the fourth verse
[7:22] brothers
[7:23] nevertheless i am somewhat against thee
[7:25] because
[7:26] thou has left thy first love
[7:29] you left that love that you once had for
[7:31] them good old-fashioned holy ghost
[7:33] needing
[7:34] and you're beginning to kind of slide
[7:36] backwards into that farm won't come in
[7:38] with
[7:39] a father and a nonsense
[7:43] see if god had that against
[7:46] this church he's got it against
[7:48] sacrifice
[7:49] yeah amen because you left your first
[7:52] love
[7:53] i've got it against you but where's that
[7:55] first love you want to have
[7:58] where's that joy i used to have because
[8:01] david once cried oh lord restore to me
[8:03] the joy of my salvation
[8:05] words i'm all night prayer meetings and
[8:07] tears on your cheeks
[8:09] my goodness the bible is even justine
[8:11] young cockwebs on it
[8:12] the fifth first warning remember
[8:18] and repent see
[8:21] remember therefore from witch tower and
[8:23] fall and where did you come from from
[8:25] pentecost you fell down to where you are
[8:27] now
[8:27] backsliding and repent and do thy first
[8:30] words go back to pentecost again
[8:32] or else i will come unto thee quickly
[8:35] and will remove the
[8:36] candlestick out of h.i.s
[8:39] see who it is don't you his please
[8:41] accept our repent
[8:44] you got a pastor that really tells you
[8:45] the truth of your honor
[8:48] worship god realizing that you're going
[8:51] to be lost if you don't
[8:52] see you bring a reproach up upon the
[8:56] cause of christ
[8:58] isn't that right don't we do it the
[9:00] bootleggers ain't hurt in the church
[9:02] [Music]
[9:04] isn't that it is the prostitutes hurting
[9:07] the church
[9:08] it's the people who profess to be
[9:09] christians who hurt the church
[9:13] but this thou has they had something in
[9:16] it
[9:17] now what could they have that thou
[9:21] hatest the deeds of the nickelodeons
[9:23] which
[9:24] i also hate nickelodeon come from the
[9:28] word
[9:28] in our cko nikko which means to
[9:32] conquer or to overthrow
[9:35] nickel ladies overthrow or
[9:39] conquer the laity what caused that then
[9:43] the nickelodeon bring in a bunch of man
[9:46] to twist up the scripture make a
[9:48] denomination
[9:48] can't let god move in right there
[9:51] we want to be right oh
[9:54] my it's a serious saying brother we've
[9:57] got to get this thing right
[10:00] we'll never be able to have a church
[10:02] until god gets a foundation laying on
[10:06] he'll never build his church upon a
[10:08] bunch of nonsense
[10:09] and he has to come on his word or he
[10:11] won't come at all
[10:12] amen right on his word
[10:16] now let's see if
[10:18] [Music]
[10:24] [Music]
[10:28] god hates an organization people say i
[10:32] see them speaking down
[10:33] that still don't mean they got the holy
[10:35] ghost all right
[10:36] i hear him shout that still don't mean
[10:39] they got the holy ghost
[10:40] the holy ghost is alive amen he that has
[10:44] an ear
[10:44] let him hear what the spirit sayeth unto
[10:46] the churches to him that overcometh i
[10:49] will give to eat of the tree of life
[10:51] which is in the midst of the paradise of
[10:54] god
[10:56] now look friends here's the way you
[10:59] overcome
[11:00] first you have to overcome then you can
[11:02] eat the fruit
[11:03] amen he was a tree of life what did he
[11:07] say how did he fix it
[11:08] repeat every one of you and be baptized
[11:11] in the name of jesus christ for the
[11:12] release of your sins
[11:14] and you shall receive the gift of the
[11:16] holy ghost
[11:18] an eternal prescription it's for you and
[11:21] your children
[11:22] this will last all down to every
[11:23] churches give it to everyone
[11:26] that's where you got so many dead
[11:27] churches so there any good members
[11:30] you're an antidote and taking so much
[11:32] away from it so the prescription itself
[11:34] at all it won't even heal nothing
[11:37] shaking hands and joining churches and
[11:39] sprinkles
[11:41] that's not the description that's dead
[11:44] if you want life
[11:44] won't the holy ghost follow what god
[11:46] said do you take the prescription
[11:48] that's exactly what he said don't add to
[11:50] it or take away from it then here comes
[11:52] the revelation right over he said
[11:54] whoever will take away or add to the
[11:56] same will be taking his part out of the
[11:58] book of mines
[11:59] oh my that's the main doctor oh i'm
[12:02] loving don't you
