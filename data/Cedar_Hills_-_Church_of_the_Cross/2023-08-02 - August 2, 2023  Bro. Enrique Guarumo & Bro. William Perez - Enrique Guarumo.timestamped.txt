[32:00] sir I'm going to give glory to God
[32:07] let us pray Brothers
[32:10] to give thanks to God
[32:14] we should be thankful to God
[32:17] as this word says it says
[32:21] to be thankful for everything
[32:26] foreign
[32:28] let's pray
[32:47] knowing that we are unworthy people
[32:51] but by your grace you have reached us
[32:54] yes
[32:55] and you have provided the very best for
[32:58] us and that is your word
[33:01] and now Heavenly Father
[33:05] we pray that you forgive our sins and
[33:08] our failures
[33:12] it says there as if someone has sent
[33:15] confidence
[33:16] we have confidence therefore in God
[33:26] that you will help us tonight
[34:08] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[34:10] ask
[34:13] let's open our Bibles to Genesis chapter
[34:16] 22. uh
[34:22] considering there are many pictures many
[34:24] ministers they preached the bridge
[34:28] they have spoken about this chapter
[34:32] is speaking about Abraham
[34:36] is
[34:38] always a blessing when we hear it yeah
[34:48] believing God
[35:00] here we're going to see a few different
[35:02] things
[35:06] to really see if we were really
[35:08] believing God or not
[35:12] verse 1 says
[35:21] and it came to pass after these things
[35:23] that God did tempt Abram Abraham and
[35:26] said unto him Abraham he said behold
[35:29] here I am
[35:35] almost
[35:42] and he said take now your son your only
[35:45] son Isaac whom you love and get into the
[35:48] land of Moriah and offer him there for a
[35:51] burnt offering upon one of the mountains
[35:53] which I will tell you of yeah
[36:07] and Abraham rose up early in the morning
[36:09] and saddled his ass and took two of the
[36:12] young men with him and Isaac his son and
[36:14] split the wood for the burnt offering
[36:16] and Rose up and went to the place which
[36:18] God had told him
[36:25] and then on the third day Abraham lifted
[36:27] up his eyes and saw the place so far off
[36:30] and this is
[36:38] and Abraham said unto his his young men
[36:42] abide you here with the ass and I and
[36:45] the lad will go Yonder and worship and
[36:48] come again to you
[36:50] you may be seated brother
[36:56] uh
[36:59] it's a situation a very difficult time
[37:02] here that Abraham's going
[37:04] and Abraham has to make a decision
[37:10] the prophet said he believed God
[37:14] when God requires something from us
[37:19] and he wants us to believe him uh
[37:32] he's speaking about doctors and so many
[37:34] things that are happening
[37:36] tomorrow
[37:44] [Music]
[37:48] many times
[37:51] we come into those circumstances
[37:54] because we go to the doctor yeah
[38:05] then the battle starts in our mind
[38:23] let's go
[38:25] uh
[38:30] Abraham the prophet said didn't say
[38:32] anything to his wife Sarah
[38:35] the prophet said if he would have told
[38:37] her
[38:40] she would have screamed she would have
[38:42] cried out
[38:56] actually there's many things personally
[38:59] as ministers
[39:02] when God speaks to his servants
[39:07] sometimes the servant has to do that do
[39:10] it without saying anything
[39:13] and sometimes he doesn't have to give
[39:15] explanations
[39:17] because if you give explanations
[39:21] then other consequences come uh
[39:26] uh
[39:27] I want to emphasize on something
[39:32] when Abraham started that trip to go to
[39:35] this mountain because you
[39:44] said that Abraham put the wood on top of
[39:48] Isaac
[39:50] Abraham took the fire in his hands
[39:56] but his son Isaac was asking him a
[39:59] question
[40:02] whereas then the sacrifice okay
[40:08] it's really easy to start a Christian
[40:10] Life
[40:15] and
[40:19] You Begin walking in your walk
[40:25] then you start thinking what's going to
[40:27] happen later
[40:36] when they got to that place
[40:41] Abraham tells his servants okay
[40:44] Muchachos
[40:48] right here you can stay here now
[40:52] and I'm gonna go to this mountain
[40:55] I'm Gonna Worship
[41:00] and we're going to return we're going to
[41:02] come back
[41:05] but Abraham knew in his heart
[41:09] what God was expecting of him
[41:23] he said that Abraham asked God he says
[41:29] he says Lord you know I love my son
[41:33] how many of you love your children
[41:37] raise your hands up
[41:42] put yourself in on that thing in that
[41:44] place
[41:46] if God would come and tell you you know
[41:50] I want you to sacrifice your son to me
[41:54] why am I
[41:57] honorable no no maybe not
[42:01] um
[42:06] maybe the Lord tells me put myself
[42:10] to sacrifice him you think about it
[42:14] just to think about it
[42:17] no no no that's not God
[42:22] but Abraham believed God
[42:31] and we will come back
[42:36] his faith was being proved right okay
[42:43] are there many Christians today and many
[42:46] give glory to God for that
[42:49] there's a time in your life
[42:53] that your faith has to be tried
[43:02] the
[43:06] first thing he does is he tries them
[43:14] don't think it's because you surrender
[43:16] the Lord God's going to give you a house
[43:17] he's going to give you a card
[43:19] no no
[43:21] God will test you
[43:36] and I am a person that hardly ever
[43:38] complains about anything it don't says
[43:44] I was praying and I said to the Lord is
[43:48] good Lord you don't have to heal me
[43:51] but then in your grace Lord
[43:55] It's good to you okay
[43:58] that I I will be healed
[44:01] Lord It's that's fine with me
[44:06] if I'm gonna be like this yes
[44:09] also everything's okay everything okay
[44:13] sometimes we think
[44:17] sometimes we think that God has to do
[44:19] these things
[44:21] we think that he has to but foreign
[45:04] thing I can't do nothing for you
[45:08] but God it's the same
[45:11] because God is the god of laws
[45:18] [Applause]
[45:22] because the prophet said this in the
[45:24] message
[45:27] he wanted to heal a lot of people it is
[45:34] and he said the Holy Spirit came and
[45:36] rebuked him for that reason
[45:39] because he had compassion enough
[45:45] but the Holy Spirit told him I did not
[45:47] send you for that
[45:53] all we think oh God has to do such and
[45:56] such a thing
[45:59] that's what he said I don't do anything
[46:05] when he shows me then I'll do it
[46:12] continuing the scene of Abraham and his
[46:14] son
[46:16] what gets my attention is
[46:27] yeah
[46:29] you cannot answer oh yeah he's the
[46:32] clock's not moving okay
[46:39] brothers when they got to that place is
[46:45] there Isaac was
[46:49] the prophet said he was about 15 years
[46:51] old maybe between 15 and 18 years old
[46:59] here I'm gonna speak about something
[47:02] okay
[47:04] when they got to that place
[47:08] Abraham knew what he was going to do and
[47:13] can you imagine
[47:15] here here's the word
[47:17] here's we have the fire
[47:23] Isaac was very restless
[47:26] that his question was
[47:31] where's the sacrifice
[47:35] and then Abraham looks at his son
[47:38] and he said he said Isaac
[47:42] put your hands together
[47:47] maybe he takes a little cord out of his
[47:50] pocket
[47:51] and he begins to tie him down
[47:57] and Isaac looking at his father
[48:02] dad what are you gonna do
[48:06] where is
[48:07] oh you are the sacrifice
[48:17] maybe we could get one of one of the
[48:19] young guys to help
[48:21] oh they would run they would run out of
[48:24] here I said no no not me not me
[48:32] then I asked myself the question
[48:39] God requires something of us
[48:42] and we don't do it
[48:49] I said God
[48:53] what attitude did Isaac have okay
[48:59] he didn't refuse his father
[49:03] and he he led his father time
[49:07] it's very easy brother
[49:12] to sit in the Judgment seat is
[49:20] I don't need such and such things
[49:25] but we don't understand what we have but
[49:28] behind what we have today
[49:34] there are persons and people that had to
[49:36] sacrifice or to stay for me for you and
[49:40] for me
[49:42] maybe you don't see it that way
[50:03] because they were believing
[50:07] EE
[50:09] akimo is
[50:14] this may have been a few times I've been
[50:17] able to hear it
[50:18] here
[50:20] it's such a tremendous history
[50:29] such a high position
[50:32] being a judge of the Republic of
[50:35] Colombia
[50:37] and you're having all of that foreign
[51:00] preachers
[51:30] salvation is going to come
[51:35] many times we make light of that
[51:39] is
[51:47] to be able to obey God
[51:54] through his word
[51:58] many times myself
[52:02] I have a lot of dreams
[52:05] I heard we don't talk about them but I
[52:07] have many dreams
[52:09] I
[52:15] was in a place where there was a lot of
[52:17] machinery
[52:37] he said go and bring that tree one of
[52:41] these workers
[52:44] and time went by and they didn't come
[52:46] with what he had told them
[52:49] this man in the dream tells me what
[52:51] happened with these men that I told to
[52:53] go do that
[52:54] he goes well I'm going to go when I got
[52:57] there
[52:59] what they were doing
[53:02] what they were not told to do
[53:05] oh my God I said oh my god oh
[53:12] and then I went and told the boss
[53:14] they're doing such and such a thing and
[53:16] he goes oh my goodness
[53:18] he was an elderly
[53:23] because that's the reason why we don't
[53:26] Advance
[53:29] because your men that are doing things
[53:32] that haven't been they haven't been sent
[53:33] to do those things I said Lord
[53:38] I woke up and I said Lord
[53:43] is
[53:48] disturbing somebody else's walk uh
[53:54] and I began to pray to the Lord and I
[53:56] said Lord forgive me
[54:00] if I'm a person that's keeping somebody
[54:03] else back from advancing
[54:15] you need in this message
[54:23] foreign
[54:57] it's the same with me
[54:59] it is
[55:02] they don't believe that's why they
[55:04] cannot receive
[55:05] the benefit of his word
[55:11] when I said Lord
[55:16] all the promises you have in the Bible
[55:20] why they don't they don't all work
[55:23] then
[55:49] what are you gonna tell them
[55:51] I said no no I'm not
[55:54] I am not going to die
[56:01] it's not easy
[56:05] he says every soul that sins
[56:08] that soul will die
[56:11] but your soul
[56:14] if you're a believer of God
[56:31] any devil
[56:36] yes
[56:37] I'm studying the message adoption right
[56:40] now
[56:41] I'm going to reach up in the prophet
[56:43] says
[56:45] the prophet says the following do you
[56:47] see
[57:01] a minute
[57:24] to say
[57:29] is
[57:41] but in this time
[57:45] God came and explained it
[57:49] he says now your name
[57:52] your name is the same
[57:56] as his
[58:01] out
[58:27] three times
[58:30] your name your name my name
[58:33] my name is the same is his
[58:39] look here Satan
[58:43] I am Enrique
[58:48] say and here it says
[58:50] my name is
[59:00] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[59:04] Enrique or Jimmy is gonna cast you out
[59:09] what do you think happened
[59:12] it happened just like that
[59:14] the pain left
[59:18] okay
[59:25] like we heard the messages put your name
[59:35] the devil can't challenge
[59:38] if he challenges
[59:40] he knows what he's coming up against
[59:45] foreign
[1:00:17] I know that the devil believes
[1:00:21] our subject is
[1:00:24] the devil believes
[1:00:28] but he cannot obey
[1:00:35] numbers
[1:00:36] in my name they shall cast out devils
[1:00:42] and the prophet of God says
[1:00:48] his name is the best thing that he could
[1:00:51] have given to his children
[1:00:54] that you will be able to believe him
[1:01:04] and it was so hot there
[1:01:07] you know it hadn't rained
[1:01:11] the house we were at didn't have water
[1:01:15] we went to town and there was no water
[1:01:21] we come there
[1:01:26] you try to sometimes be real humble
[1:01:32] maybe you'll hear me
[1:01:39] sometimes when God speaks
[1:01:41] it comes with inspiration
[1:01:44] you have to learn
[1:01:49] sometimes God speaks things
[1:01:59] when you're going to speak it you don't
[1:02:01] feel the same
[1:02:16] and I asked him do you believe in God
[1:02:21] I said in five minutes it's gonna rain
[1:02:40] I mean I'm happy
[1:02:42] I said Lord
[1:02:46] you can believe God
[1:02:49] you're not looking at the circumstances
[1:02:51] yeah
[1:02:57] when the doctor tells you you can't eat
[1:03:00] anything solid or you do you're gonna
[1:03:02] die
[1:03:07] he probably said he went home and he was
[1:03:10] reading his Bible
[1:03:15] he read that they shall lay their hands
[1:03:18] on the sick and they shall recovery
[1:03:23] here with Isaiah by his stripes we were
[1:03:26] healed
[1:03:30] we had never had a prayer
[1:03:34] the prophet came out with his Bible
[1:03:38] he said Dad can we pray yeah
[1:03:44] and then he said God is looking at me he
[1:03:47] was all surprised his word says
[1:03:51] that I am already healed
[1:04:10] you know the history how he began to
[1:04:12] feel worse but he said no God just heal
[1:04:15] me anyway
[1:04:17] brother when you believe God
[1:04:21] Abraham believed God
[1:04:24] he was not looking at his body
[1:04:27] he was almost like
[1:04:32] he was looking at what God had told him
[1:04:37] tells you he has already healed you
[1:04:40] it's your decision
[1:04:42] to believe him or not
[1:04:45] you can stand your feet
[1:04:53] remember
[1:04:56] scratch
[1:05:04] [Applause]
[1:05:13] amen

[1:07:44] which when they had taken up they used
[1:07:46] helps under girding the ship and fearing
[1:07:50] lest they should fall into the
[1:07:51] quicksands straight sail and so we're
[1:07:54] driven Yuna Wes
[1:08:08] and we've been exceedingly tossed with
[1:08:10] the Tempest the next day they lie in the
[1:08:13] ship
[1:08:18] and the third day we cast out with our
[1:08:21] own hands the tackling of the ship is
[1:08:27] and when neither Sun nor stars and many
[1:08:30] days appeared and no small Tempest lay
[1:08:33] on us
[1:08:34] all hope that we should be saved was
[1:08:37] then taken away
[1:08:46] amen may the Lord His blessings to the
[1:08:48] reading of the word you may be seated
[1:08:52] we want to bring uh bring greetings

[1:09:46] than it is here in the in the desert
[1:09:50] but even a little bit of of lower
[1:09:54] degrees was was nice
[1:09:58] you know we had a tremendous subject
[1:10:02] of of the meetings
[1:10:05] was Prayer Changes Things

[1:10:12] familiar with prayer

[1:10:21] change things amen
[1:10:24] we just heard a beautiful message about
[1:10:26] about that is
[1:10:30] you know we had a similar event happen
[1:10:32] on Sunday morning
[1:10:35] brother and brother Enrique I talked

[1:10:56] Breeze to come in and just just cool it
[1:10:58] down in here
[1:11:03] well there was there was there was
[1:11:06] people outside of the tent there
[1:11:09] was some uh some Electronics outside
[1:11:12] there
[1:11:18] like the
[1:11:20] faucet of of heavens of just just came
[1:11:23] open
[1:11:26] for about 30 40 minutes like you've
[1:11:29] never seen before
[1:11:32] so after after uh after service yeah
[1:11:37] disposal service
[1:11:38] I told him I said I know that the
[1:11:42] scripture for the services
[1:11:45] that the effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:11:48] righteous man availeth
[1:11:54] mucho man it was too much
[1:11:59] but you know it's it's the way that God
[1:12:02] works sometimes
[1:12:05] you know we don't we don't realize
[1:12:09] sometimes what God is doing in our lives
[1:12:12] amen
[1:12:15] man there's so many times we we feel
[1:12:18] that our life is insignificant which is
[1:12:23] we're so we're we we feel sometimes
[1:12:28] that our lives ain't worth
[1:12:32] mucho but look at all
[1:12:36] you know in this story
[1:12:40] Paul was being sent being sent to
[1:12:43] Romeo Aroma it was being said to trial
[1:12:48] and he found himself in a predicament
[1:12:51] he's saying
[1:12:53] found himself on a boat
[1:12:56] let's go back to acts 27
[1:13:01] and I tell you he was in the storm of
[1:13:04] his life
[1:13:07] so many times when we're in the storm of
[1:13:09] our lives
[1:13:12] our our prayer or the way that we
[1:13:16] approach God
[1:13:18] sometimes it says Lord take us out of
[1:13:22] this storm
[1:13:25] take me out of this situation
[1:13:28] whatever it may be just take me okay
[1:13:32] I can't go through it
[1:13:35] I don't want to go through it
[1:13:37] but here's Paul as he's going through
[1:13:40] this
[1:13:49] but after long abstinence Paul stood
[1:13:52] forth in the midst of them and said sirs
[1:13:55] ye should have hearkened unto me and not
[1:13:57] have loose from Crete and to have gained
[1:14:00] this harm and loss this is
[1:14:14] and now I exhort to you
[1:14:18] to be of good cheer
[1:14:20] for there shall be no loss of any man's
[1:14:22] life amongst you but of the ship
[1:14:25] was
[1:14:32] for there stood by me this night the
[1:14:34] angel of God whose I am and whom I serve
[1:14:38] only
[1:14:44] saying fear not Paul siendo Pablo no
[1:14:47] temas thou must be brought before Caesar
[1:14:51] is
[1:14:52] you know Paul didn't say
[1:15:00] I know you're going to take our you're
[1:15:02] going to stop this storm
[1:15:04] you're gonna you're gonna take me back
[1:15:08] and everything is going to be fine
[1:15:12] no the angel didn't do that for Paul
[1:15:16] he said
[1:15:19] so what you were sent for I don't know
[1:15:22] if we stand he says I'm going to take
[1:15:24] you through this storm
[1:15:26] so that what your destination is
[1:15:31] what's going to happen there will be
[1:15:33] accomplished
[1:15:36] God many times
[1:15:38] doesn't take us out of our condition
[1:15:42] but what he does
[1:15:44] he takes us through our conditions
[1:15:49] something that's very very important
[1:15:52] when we look
[1:15:55] in the book of Isaiah
[1:15:58] chapter 43.
[1:16:08] it says but now thus saith the Lord that
[1:16:11] created Theo Jacob
[1:16:13] and he that formed the O Israel
[1:16:16] fear not for I have redeemed Thee I have
[1:16:20] called thee by name and thou art mine I
[1:16:22] see this is
[1:16:30] what now passes through the waters
[1:16:35] I will be with thee yesterday Contigo
[1:16:38] and through the rivers
[1:16:41] they shall not overflow
[1:16:45] when thou walkest through the fire when
[1:16:49] the buses
[1:16:51] thou shall not be burned
[1:16:54] neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee
[1:16:58] what an amazing scripture that is this
[1:17:01] evening
[1:17:03] when we know that God
[1:17:06] is taking us through something
[1:17:10] we won't be
[1:17:12] overflowns you won't be burned
[1:17:16] we'll pass through the waters
[1:17:19] and through it all yeah he is with us
[1:17:24] how many have served the Lord for 10
[1:17:27] years
[1:17:30] how many have served the Lord for 20
[1:17:31] years
[1:17:33] 30 years 40 years
[1:17:37] 50 years
[1:17:39] 60 years
[1:17:41] imagine that
[1:17:43] 60 years and I can still see my uncle
[1:17:47] Abraham
[1:17:50] he's been through a lot of storms
[1:17:54] he's been through a lot of fires
[1:17:57] but never once
[1:18:00] has God not been with him he owes myself
[1:18:04] amen amen you could say the same thing
[1:18:07] about you
[1:18:08] the different parts where you came from
[1:18:12] everything that God has brought you
[1:18:14] through
[1:18:16] you can say Lord I know it's difficult
[1:18:19] this time
[1:18:21] oh Lord but thank you so much for being
[1:18:24] with me
[1:18:26] it takes me to a to a little too little
[1:18:30] story
[1:18:31] you know there is there's this little
[1:18:34] there's this little bird
[1:18:36] that the Bible speaks
[1:18:39] quite a bit about
[1:18:45] how many times we think of eagles and we
[1:18:48] want everybody wants oh Eagles are
[1:18:50] amazing yes let me check this out nobody
[1:18:52] wants to be an eagle yeah
[1:18:55] but you know what better sometimes we
[1:18:58] feel like a sparrows
[1:19:02] insignificant insignificant not very
[1:19:05] pretty Bonito
[1:19:07] bony legs
[1:19:15] just

[1:19:24] I'm just out of kilter
[1:19:29] I'm just out of alignment I'm just out
[1:19:32] of shape

[1:20:03] beautiful songs
[1:20:08] but there is one song that the that the
[1:20:11] thrush sparrows sing that is amazing
[1:20:17] it says the only time the thrush Sparrow
[1:20:20] is known to sing her most beautiful song
[1:20:26] is
[1:20:29] [Music]
[1:20:30] when it's in a terrible
[1:20:34] dangerous storm
[1:20:39] it sings its most glorious
[1:20:42] beautiful song
[1:20:46] when it's wounded or hurt real bad

[1:26:20] neighbor
[1:26:21] we are more value
[1:26:25] than many sparrows
[1:26:29] um
[1:26:30] that is that is that is so good it says
[1:26:35] that is just so amazing to us this is
[1:26:39] you know we we don't even realize
[1:26:42] sometimes
[1:26:44] how significant okay significant we are
[1:26:49] to God
[1:26:51] but I want you to know this is something
[1:26:58] there there was a there was a woman
[1:27:01] her name was Sevilla Martin
[1:27:04] she was uh she was Canadian Canada she
[1:27:10] she went to visit some friends
[1:27:12] up in New York are you in New York
[1:27:16] they got to be pretty pretty close
[1:27:18] friends
[1:27:21] one day as she was visiting with her
[1:27:23] husband the
[1:27:27] the the wife had been bedridden for
[1:27:30] about 20 years
[1:27:35] the husband was he was crippled and he
[1:27:38] was on a wheelchairs
[1:27:43] one day they asked
[1:27:47] what is your secret
[1:27:50] why
[1:27:52] through all that you've been through
[1:27:57] why do you why are you so happy and
[1:28:01] content okay
[1:28:04] well Mrs Doolittle that's what what what
[1:28:08] her name was
[1:28:11] simply said this
[1:28:14] is I
[1:28:16] is on The Sparrows
[1:28:20] and I know he watches me
[1:28:24] she was gripped with so much emotion
[1:28:28] that she couldn't contain herself
[1:28:31] she went into the next room
[1:28:34] and she began to write the songs why
[1:28:40] should I feel discouraged animal
[1:28:45] why
[1:28:46] should the Shadows come from
[1:28:58] why should my heart be lonely
[1:29:04] and long for heaven and home
[1:29:08] when Jesus is my portion Jesus says my
[1:29:13] constant friend is
[1:29:16] His Eyes On The Sparrows
[1:29:19] and I know he watches me
[1:29:23] I Sing Because I'm happy
[1:29:26] I sing I'm free
[1:29:29] for his eyes
[1:29:33] and I know you'll say he watches me
[1:29:37] imagine
[1:29:39] that song
[1:29:41] over a hundred years ago
[1:29:48] for a day like today
[1:29:56] the old testamento
[1:30:00] there was no worshiper that could
[1:30:02] approach god with empty hands
[1:30:08] because the Old Testament worship
[1:30:12] it involved sacrifices gifts and
[1:30:15] offerings
[1:30:17] regardless your friend he had no gift
[1:30:20] there was no worship
[1:30:24] God made no provision for freeloaders in
[1:30:27] his economy
[1:30:33] if they were in poverty
[1:30:36] they could trap but they could bring in
[1:30:39] a turtle dove
[1:30:41] [Music]
[1:30:42] um
[1:30:44] for the sacrifice
[1:30:47] or they could bring in a sparrow
[1:30:52] but they could not worship empty-handed
[1:30:58] this this evening
[1:31:01] I asked each and every one of you
[1:31:04] what do you have in your kitchen
[1:31:08] what is in your hand for worship
[1:31:13] so many times
[1:31:15] we come empty-handed
[1:31:21] we can't come with our hands empty
[1:31:24] but even if we come yeah it's something
[1:31:28] that is just worth a couple of cents
[1:31:32] God still accepts that sacrifice
[1:31:36] something that's insignificant
