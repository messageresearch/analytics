[47:26] [Music]
[47:35] brother caleb and you're going to have
[47:36] this brother priest of the young people
[47:41] but he did a wonderful job
[47:45] and i
[47:46] i loved the enthusiasm
[47:50] a man
[47:52] i thought about about him and if caleb
[47:56] was choosing a man to go up and fight
[47:58] one of these giants
[48:04] and he sees the biggest giant up there
[48:05] and he says i think i'll send better
[48:07] vidal
[48:12] and then maybe brother vidal's brethren
[48:14] said
[48:16] he says
[48:56] a familiar scripture chapter 14.
[49:12] a
[49:16] as the lord commanded moses so the
[49:19] children of israel did and they divided
[49:21] the land
[49:30] then the children of judah came under
[49:32] joshua and
[49:33] gilgal and caleb the son of jefun the
[49:37] king canozite said unto him
[49:39] thou knowest the thing that the lord
[49:41] said unto moses the man of god
[49:43] concerning me
[49:54] foreign
[49:59] 40 years old was i when moses the
[50:01] servant of the lord sent me from
[50:03] cadesparnia to spy out the land and i
[50:06] brought him word again as it was in my
[50:08] heart
[50:20] nevertheless my brethren that went up
[50:22] with me made the heart of the people
[50:25] melt but i
[50:27] wholly followed the lord my god
[50:38] and moses swear on that day saying
[50:41] surely the land wherein thy feet have
[50:43] troddened shall be thine inheritance and
[50:46] thy children's forever because thou hast
[50:49] wholly followed the lord my god the lord
[50:51] that my god and
[51:05] and now behold the lord hath kept me
[51:07] alive as he said these forty and five
[51:10] years even since the lord spake this
[51:13] word unto moses while the children of
[51:15] israel wandered in the wilderness and
[51:17] now lo i am this day for score and five
[51:20] years
[51:32] is
[51:39] as yet i am as strong this day as i was
[51:42] in the day that moses sent me
[51:44] as my strength was then even so is my
[51:47] strength now for war or to go out and to
[51:51] come in today
[52:02] now therefore give me this mountain
[52:05] where the lord spake in that day for
[52:07] thou heard us in that day how the
[52:09] anakins were there
[52:11] and that their and that the cities were
[52:13] great and fenced if so the lord will be
[52:16] with me then i shall be able to drive
[52:19] them out as the lord said name
[52:37] remember friends
[52:39] caleb had to ask for that mountain was
[52:42] given to him
[52:56] and joshua blessed him and gave unto
[52:58] caleb the son of jeffoon hebron for
[53:01] inheritance
[53:08] hebrew therefore became the inheritance
[53:10] of caleb the son of jefun the kingzide
[53:13] unto this day because that he wholly
[53:15] followed the lord god of israel
[53:32] was a great man among the anakins and
[53:34] the land had rest from war was
[53:51] as we go through this morning
[54:03] friends many times brother caleb has
[54:05] asked me to give testimonies about the
[54:07] prophet brother branham
[54:14] and i enjoyed doing that my family was
[54:16] close friends with brother branham
[54:19] [Music]
[54:20] amigos
[54:37] and i've heard many many stories about
[54:39] this prophet of god
[54:44] and the mighty things that god did
[54:46] through him in his ministry
[55:06] when i was working for voice of god the
[55:08] power went out one day
[55:14] so we didn't have anything to do so we
[55:16] all gathered into one room
[55:30] joseph asked brother billy he said billy
[55:32] tell us something about daddy
[55:36] [Music]
[55:41] brother billy
[55:43] he said he said you know he says i was
[55:46] the closest
[55:54] he said i traveled around the world with
[55:57] him i was with him in every service
[56:04] he said
[56:05] daddy would tell me things as we
[56:07] traveled as we talked that no one else
[56:09] knew
[56:32] and i think about brother branham and i
[56:34] think about what brother carlos was
[56:36] saying last night and what is the
[56:38] greatest thing
[56:55] is it the power to speak storms
[57:10] and friends the reason that brother
[57:12] branham's ministry was so great is
[57:14] because he had that love
[57:22] and he gets so much criticism people
[57:24] dissect everything that he said
[57:29] and we try to find fault in it
[57:33] let me tell you something if half of
[57:35] what brother branham preached wasn't
[57:37] wasn't right about the seals or the ages
[57:39] or anything like that
[57:47] i would still believe him
[57:50] because that man has the spirit of
[57:52] christ
[57:58] but
[58:01] what he said is right
[58:05] though
[58:08] brother branham was an example to all of
[58:11] us
[58:15] and we may not be able to speak storms
[58:18] away
[58:23] [Music]
[58:48] and we've
[59:16] there's also failures
[59:29] he said joshua and caleb when
[59:43] they said oh we look like grasshoppers
[59:45] on side of them
[59:49] joshua and caleb said we can do it
[59:51] that's right
[59:58] god promised we could do it
[1:00:02] god said we could do it
[1:00:06] god promised our fathers that we were
[1:00:08] going to that land
[1:00:21] and they look like giants and everything
[1:00:23] else
[1:00:28] he quit looking at giants and started
[1:00:30] looking at god's word
[1:00:36] and when men and women quit looking at
[1:00:38] their sickness and diseases
[1:00:53] amen all things are subject to jesus
[1:00:56] christ
[1:00:59] and all things are subject to your
[1:01:02] prayer
[1:01:07] when you ask in his name and
[1:01:14] this is 45 years before
[1:01:17] joshua gave that mountain to caleb
[1:01:25] and god instructed moses he said
[1:01:28] to send two spies over into this
[1:01:32] promised land
[1:01:36] foreign these spies they went over
[1:01:39] jordan and they went to these mountains
[1:01:42] to this hill country
[1:01:49] and they saw that it was a good land
[1:01:54] but they saw that there were giants
[1:01:56] there were mighty warriors on that side
[1:02:02] and they saw that there were cities like
[1:02:04] jericho that had giant walls around them
[1:02:11] and they said how could we
[1:02:13] take this land
[1:02:18] it's impossible it's impossible so they
[1:02:21] came back over these twelve men
[1:02:25] and they gave a report to the people
[1:02:28] [Music]
[1:02:30] and they said let's let's read the
[1:02:32] scriptures in numbers
[1:02:38] let's go to numbers
[1:02:44] 1432
[1:02:56] i came over
[1:02:57] and they said this
[1:03:00] and there we saw giants the son of anak
[1:03:05] which come up the giants
[1:03:07] and we were in our own sight
[1:03:10] grasshoppers and so
[1:03:12] we were in their sight
[1:03:26] so they came over
[1:03:28] to
[1:03:28] saturn and they tell the people because
[1:03:32] we felt like we were weak
[1:03:35] we were grasshoppers in their sights
[1:03:42] nosotros
[1:03:55] because god
[1:03:56] is us
[1:03:59] and it got the people stirred up and it
[1:04:01] got the people discouraged
[1:04:06] and they said we can't do it
[1:04:10] and it angered god
[1:04:14] it angered god so much that he said you
[1:04:18] will die in this land
[1:04:23] you will not go over into this promised
[1:04:26] land
[1:04:28] because you're afraid because you don't
[1:04:30] have faith in me
[1:04:32] and me am i not able to do this
[1:04:37] am i not able to conquer those giants
[1:04:48] but the people did not have faith
[1:04:51] in god and they failed
[1:05:05] is
[1:05:18] the greatest battle ever fought it's the
[1:05:20] battle
[1:05:48] and god
[1:06:00] and these
[1:06:02] men
[1:06:12] [Music]
[1:06:13] and then god's word held true that for
[1:06:16] 40 years these these men and these women
[1:06:19] wandered in the wilderness all of these
[1:06:21] children of israel
[1:06:27] and they died wandering in the
[1:06:29] wilderness
[1:06:34] and then god raised up another
[1:06:37] generation
[1:06:41] this generation wasn't with the prophet
[1:06:44] moses when he turned the nile red to
[1:06:47] blood
[1:06:55] this generation was not with the prophet
[1:06:58] when the red sea parted
[1:07:03] this generation was not in egypt when
[1:07:06] the plagues came
[1:07:11] this generation was not
[1:07:22] [Music]
[1:07:40] and this generation had far more faith
[1:07:43] in that generation
[1:07:48] where is that generation today
[1:07:53] [Music]
[1:07:56] [Applause]
[1:08:20] that will go over
[1:08:41] they were afraid of these giants
[1:08:45] gigantes
[1:08:47] but you know
[1:08:48] they thought that they were grasshoppers
[1:08:50] hey
[1:09:03] [Music]
[1:09:31] when we see giants godzilla's
[1:09:33] grasshoppers
[1:09:38] isaiah 40 verse 21
[1:09:44] have ye not known
[1:09:46] have ye not heard
[1:09:49] has it not been told you from the
[1:09:51] beginning
[1:09:52] have you not understand understood from
[1:09:54] the foundations of the earth
[1:10:10] it is he that sitteth upon the circle of
[1:10:12] the earth and the inhabitants thereof
[1:10:15] are as grasshoppers
[1:10:18] that stretches out the heavens as a
[1:10:20] curtain and spread of them as a tent to
[1:10:22] dwell in
[1:10:41] and whatever those obstacles are
[1:10:43] it may be fear it may be sin
[1:10:49] [Music]
[1:10:51] and it seems like
[1:10:54] we see a giant
[1:11:04] [Music]
[1:11:06] and to them that have no might he
[1:11:09] increases strength
[1:11:18] we don't have to have strength in
[1:11:19] ourselves it's god's strength that will
[1:11:22] carry us through it
[1:11:28] at night i i've seen some of the some of
[1:11:31] the young people and i've been watching
[1:11:32] and i see some of the bugs flying around
[1:11:42] [Music]
[1:11:46] and maybe as our brother said it may be
[1:11:48] a boy or maybe a girl
[1:11:52] um may be
[1:11:55] it may be drinking it may be partying it
[1:11:58] may be it may be even spending too much
[1:12:00] time on social media he says
[1:12:04] [Music]
[1:12:14] god said that those giants are
[1:12:17] grasshoppers
[1:12:28] [Music]
[1:12:48] you're like a million times bigger than
[1:12:51] it is
[1:12:55] squash it a blaster
[1:12:59] and that's the same thing that you can
[1:13:01] do is
[1:13:15] joshua
[1:13:16] chapter
[1:13:21] [Music]
[1:13:26] the people again
[1:13:28] come to this jordan river to take the
[1:13:31] land that god had promised to them
[1:13:34] [Music]
[1:13:40] joshua sends two spies over josue
[1:13:45] they go over and they go to a place the
[1:13:47] greatest city of them all called jericho
[1:13:55] they get into the city and they see the
[1:13:58] giant walls
[1:14:11] [Music]
[1:14:12] a hard life
[1:14:27] into the worst life that she could have
[1:14:29] lived
[1:14:33] sinful life
[1:14:36] but
[1:14:37] she had heard
[1:14:53] she had hope that maybe my
[1:15:08] the
[1:15:09] professor was named dr kurt richter from
[1:15:11] harvard university a professor
[1:15:13] a professor record
[1:15:16] the harvard the harvard
[1:15:18] harbor and he did an experiment with
[1:15:20] rats
[1:15:23] and what he did is he took these rats
[1:15:25] and he put them in a bucket half full of
[1:15:27] water and he dropped them in and he saw
[1:15:30] how long that they would swim
[1:15:50] so then dr richter said i'll try
[1:15:53] something different
[1:15:59] and he takes a bunch of rats
[1:16:02] and uh previous time the rats have
[1:16:04] lasted about at the most 15 minutes
[1:16:07] before they drowned
[1:16:13] and he puts this new bunch of rats
[1:16:18] and they start swimming around
[1:16:21] after about 10 to 15 minutes they
[1:16:23] started to sink
[1:16:27] and then just before they drowned he
[1:16:29] picked them up and pulled them out
[1:16:35] [Music]
[1:16:44] before
[1:16:46] they had drowned in 15 minutes
[1:16:51] what do you think happened now
[1:16:54] how long do you think they swam
[1:16:59] 60 hours
[1:17:12] they had hoped that something was going
[1:17:13] to pluck them out of that situation
[1:17:19] even a rat has hope right now
[1:17:24] and here is rahab and she hears the drum
[1:17:28] beat
[1:17:37] but then friends
[1:17:39] what happens if you just don't have the
[1:17:41] faith
[1:18:06] brother daniel and i got to go hunting
[1:18:08] with brother caleb last year and brother
[1:18:10] sammy
[1:18:17] and we didn't find any deer and the
[1:18:19] pastor had to go back and prepare for
[1:18:21] service
[1:18:22] [Music]
[1:18:30] so brother sam and brother daniel and i
[1:18:33] we went out into the field early in the
[1:18:36] morning
[1:18:52] brother caleb had showed us
[1:18:57] there was a high mountain off in the
[1:18:58] distance
[1:19:02] i said let's go up there so we can glass
[1:19:04] and find the gear
[1:19:05] [Music]
[1:19:18] i said okay well brother daniel let's
[1:19:20] just go up to this place right here can
[1:19:22] we can we make it up to there
[1:19:27] what does he got he says yeah he says
[1:19:30] okay i'll go there
[1:19:33] so we go walking up to that place and
[1:19:35] brother daniel is huffing and puffing
[1:19:43] my brother had changed
[1:19:46] he was mean
[1:19:54] and we stopped and i said now remember
[1:19:56] talk to your friends this way sometimes
[1:20:02] your brother dana what's the matter
[1:20:14] go back to where you left your sense of
[1:20:16] humor and pick it up
[1:20:41] and that's friends sometimes
[1:20:43] we need a friend to take us through
[1:20:56] she lived a bad life and she had
[1:21:06] she had sinned too far she thought that
[1:21:09] maybe she had send away her day of grace
[1:21:26] and she said maybe i'll swim just a
[1:21:27] little bit longer
[1:21:30] and she she brought those in
[1:21:33] and she she said that
[1:21:35] she said everybody
[1:21:38] melts at the sound of your coming
[1:21:42] [Music]
[1:21:52] and you know the story that that the men
[1:21:55] that the spies they gave her the token
[1:22:02] and they went back with the report to
[1:22:04] joshua
[1:22:07] let me tell you our dear friend rahab
[1:22:10] the sinner
[1:22:20] she's not called that anymore by the way
[1:22:24] that is she she changed right there she
[1:22:26] had no more sin after that she served
[1:22:29] the lord
[1:22:32] and she married one of the finest men in
[1:22:34] the world
[1:22:36] [Music]
[1:22:50] she was in the lineage of the lord jesus
[1:22:52] christ
[1:22:55] i cannot wait to meet that sister
[1:23:01] and these two spies they come back to
[1:23:03] joshua
[1:23:18] these are the same anakin anakims that
[1:23:20] were on the mountains
[1:23:24] i'm not talking about anakin skywalker
[1:23:26] darth vader
[1:23:30] i'm talking about great warriors against
[1:23:32] god's
[1:23:50] what changed between those first 12 that
[1:23:52] went over and these two
[1:23:58] it was a different generation
[1:24:07] joshua i think it'd be good
[1:24:09] if we read a scripture
[1:24:13] i believe it's joshua chapter 1 verse 8.
[1:24:19] let me find it here
[1:24:31] joshua gives instructions to his people
[1:24:35] and he says this
[1:24:38] he says
[1:24:38] this book of the law shall not depart
[1:24:41] out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate
[1:24:43] therein day and night that thou mayest
[1:24:46] observe therein for
[1:24:47] for then thou shalt make thy way
[1:24:50] prosperous and then shalt thou have
[1:24:52] success good success
[1:25:10] be strong and of good courage be not
[1:25:12] afraid neither be thou dismayed for the
[1:25:14] lord thy god is with thee whether so
[1:25:17] ever though us
[1:25:20] is
[1:25:50] and as the people were going over he
[1:25:52] instructed he said keep your eye on that
[1:25:56] arc
[1:26:01] you said because you have not gone this
[1:26:03] way before
[1:26:07] and
[1:26:08] the children of israel they came in and
[1:26:10] they ran through the land
[1:26:15] every amalekite every every anakin every
[1:26:19] giant that stood before him
[1:26:33] they came
[1:26:35] to this river called jordan vigneron
[1:26:38] ester rio llamas
[1:26:40] the river was swollen
[1:26:45] and they had to get over to jericho
[1:26:52] the river parted on both sides
[1:26:57] just like it did for for moses at the
[1:27:00] red sea
[1:27:04] joshua tells his people he said 12 of
[1:27:07] you pick up 12 stones and carry them
[1:27:14] and bring those stones to this city
[1:27:16] called
[1:27:30] and he said pile these stones here
[1:27:32] and bring your children back to this
[1:27:35] place
[1:27:40] and when they ask what are these stones
[1:27:44] said you tell
[1:28:04] [Music]
[1:28:26] caleb stands before joshua
[1:28:31] that's the scripture that we have read
[1:28:32] earlier
[1:28:36] and he said
[1:28:38] he said joshua
[1:28:41] he said the lord has kept me alive these
[1:28:43] 85 years
[1:28:48] he said i'm as good of a man now as i
[1:28:50] was dead
[1:28:54] i don't necessarily think that his body
[1:28:58] was as good as it was when he was
[1:29:00] 40 years old
[1:29:06] but it didn't matter
[1:29:13] and you know it must have bothered
[1:29:16] busted bothered caleb for this 45 years
[1:29:18] of what they did back there in cadiz
[1:29:20] barnea
[1:29:36] he said god gave it to us
[1:29:40] it's an inheritance of ours
[1:29:44] it may be the holy spirit
[1:29:47] it's mine
[1:29:48] i can have it
[1:30:16] he couldn't have friends he couldn't
[1:30:18] have one foot in the message
[1:30:26] he couldn't do that
[1:30:29] god required a 100
[1:30:32] dedication
[1:30:48] and friends i i know in this building
[1:30:50] we've had we've we've had
[1:30:52] some people came to the altar
[1:30:57] we had a prayer line
[1:31:00] preparing for this battle reparando
[1:31:04] god doesn't want his people going into
[1:31:06] battle sick
[1:31:09] there's always something on their mind
[1:31:13] but friends have you made
[1:31:16] the commitment amigos
[1:31:21] have you made the decision
[1:31:25] to go over jordan
[1:31:42] evil
[1:31:44] this is the most important friends this
[1:31:46] isn't just a youth camp
[1:31:50] this isn't just listening to a minister
[1:31:52] up up on the pulpit preaching
[1:31:56] predicated
[1:32:10] the person wearing your shoes right now
[1:32:15] have you made this decision
[1:32:19] you made the decision all right
[1:32:32] as we want to go over jordan okay then
[1:32:35] we'll think about this next generation
[1:33:16] or are you one of the spies that went
[1:33:18] over so i can't do it
[1:33:54] and i will go over jordan i will take
[1:33:56] that mountain that you gave me

[1:37:57] will
[1:38:00] and lord jesus that you would give us
[1:38:02] the strength to take these mountains
[1:38:05] that lay before us
