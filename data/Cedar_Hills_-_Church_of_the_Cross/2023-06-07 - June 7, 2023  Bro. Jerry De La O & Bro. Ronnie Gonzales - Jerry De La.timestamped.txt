[21:52] let's try it again amen all together
[21:55] let's start from the top
[21:58] I spent in vanity and pride
[22:08] [Music]
[22:20] [Music]
[22:22] there was great and Grace was
[22:28] part and there was multiplied to me and
[22:34] there my burden still found

[24:24] amen God bless us
[24:27] you this evening
[24:29] what a good song service amen
[24:33] we should be ready for anything now
[24:35] right
[24:40] I don't know why but I'm a little
[24:42] nervous today
[24:45] but God is good right
[24:50] amen all the time God is good
[24:55] thank the pastor for the confidence
[24:58] to speak to you
[25:01] the bride of Christ this evening amen
[25:07] you know we
[25:09] I always
[25:11] always want to know who's preaching
[25:15] but one of the last times I asked
[25:17] brother Caleb who is preaching
[25:22] I found myself up here
[25:26] today at the barbershop is
[25:30] he must have read my mind
[25:35] because I didn't ask him
[25:37] but he called me a few minutes later
[25:42] but no matter what right amen we should
[25:46] always be ready
[25:48] you know maybe just a small thought
[25:51] maybe whatever but but we should always
[25:53] be ready
[25:56] and myself I have no excuse
[26:00] because I haven't been up here in a
[26:02] while
[26:04] so I should be ready amen
[26:08] but in the end it's not me
[26:11] it's not my word no it's me it's God's
[26:15] word
[26:16] I could say a lot of things
[26:18] and they probably won't mean much
[26:22] but if I let God use me
[26:26] and let the Lord Jesus Christ speak to
[26:28] you tonight
[26:31] just so I won't have you standing too
[26:33] long
[26:40] starting with verse 11.
[26:50] and it reads
[26:52] put on the whole armor of God
[26:55] that you may be able to stand against
[26:56] The Wiles of the devil it is
[27:04] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[27:07] blood
[27:08] but against principalities against
[27:10] powers
[27:12] against the rulers of Darkness of this
[27:14] world against spiritual wickedness in
[27:17] high places foreign
[27:31] wherefore taken to you a little part of
[27:34] the armor of God
[27:40] wherefore taken to you
[27:45] the Armor of God
[27:47] they don't read I don't read that right
[27:51] it says word for you taken to wherefore
[27:55] taken to you the whole Army of God
[27:59] that you may be able to withstand the
[28:02] evil day that we stand in the evil day
[28:05] and having done all to stand
[28:13] there for having your loins gird about
[28:15] with truth
[28:16] and having on the breastplate blessed
[28:19] breast plate of righteousness
[28:25] and your feet shot with the preparation
[28:28] of the gospel of peace
[28:32] above all take the shield of faith
[28:36] where you shall be able to quench all
[28:38] the fiery darts of the wicked
[28:44] and take the helmet of salvation
[28:49] and the sword of the spirit
[28:52] which is the word of God
[28:54] may the Lord
[29:02] now if I put my focus I would like to
[29:04] focus on verse 17.
[29:09] and 17 instructs us to put on the whole
[29:13] armor of God
[29:17] not just a little bit
[29:19] you know when when you're in the
[29:22] military
[29:23] and you're getting ready for battle
[29:27] you know you you put on a uniform
[29:30] and you put on certain gears
[29:35] you know a lot of them we're the the
[29:37] bulletproof vests
[29:40] they have their boots that they that
[29:42] they put on
[29:44] but as they get ready to to go on to
[29:47] that Battlefield
[29:50] I guess you could say one of the last
[29:52] things they put on is is there is their
[29:53] helmet
[29:56] because it provides a certain protection
[30:00] and we and we know
[30:27] and you know your covers you know comes
[30:29] down here
[30:31] maybe you have a little round so you can
[30:34] hear
[30:36] it's covering your head
[30:39] but it's a protection but it's not
[30:42] protection but it also can be used to
[30:44] identify somebody
[30:46] identification well you know if you know
[30:48] me you know I like football
[30:51] of course my team ain't doing too good
[30:54] but that's a different story
[30:57] but when you're on that that football
[30:59] field
[31:02] you have that helmet on
[31:05] it identifies
[31:08] who your teammates are yeah
[31:14] it identifies who's for you
[31:17] and then it also identifies who's
[31:20] against you
[31:22] but that's the way the devil works
[31:26] because he's studying you right now
[31:29] he's studying you and I right now
[31:32] if you have that helmet of salvation
[31:37] he's going to know your son and daughter
[31:39] of God
[31:41] but what we all know Salvation is a gift
[31:44] right
[31:47] salvation is the gift of God
[31:50] it comes free
[31:53] maybe we don't have to work towards it
[31:59] it comes free
[32:01] but is it really free
[32:05] because it comes with a cost
[32:08] the salvation of God comes with a cause
[32:13] we have to be willing to pay a price
[32:20] Amigos it might cost us certain things
[32:24] it might even cost us our family
[32:26] sometimes
[32:28] but we got to be a separate people this
[32:31] evening
[32:33] because the Salvation is is can we lose
[32:37] it
[32:38] I don't think you can lose it
[32:41] but the devil can get you to doubt
[32:45] the devil can get you to doubt
[32:53] and one of those things that that is on
[32:56] the battlefield
[32:58] or one thing we can use
[33:01] is to renew our minds
[33:06] the outcome of those battles determine
[33:08] the course of our lives
[33:11] in
[33:13] Romans 1 and Romans 12 1 and 2 and
[33:17] Romanos
[33:18] it instructs us it tells us
[33:25] it tells us I beseech you therefore
[33:29] brethrenos Oswego that by the mercies of
[33:32] God
[33:33] that you present your bodies a Living
[33:36] Sacrifice the presentation purpose and
[33:38] sacrifices
[33:42] which is your reasonable service
[34:04] an acceptable perfect will of God
[34:06] perfecta
[34:10] and how do we renew our minds
[34:13] of course we we got to accept and
[34:16] believe God's word
[34:19] but God's word is going to wipe out
[34:22] anything contrary to God's word
[34:27] in our mind we can't have what's
[34:30] contrary to God's word
[34:33] it must be replaced it must replace the
[34:36] world's views
[34:43] we must allow God's truth
[34:48] to continually wash away the world's
[34:51] filth
[34:53] Associates
[34:55] and confusion
[34:58] from our minds and we see all this going
[35:01] on in the world today
[35:04] there is so much filth in garbage out
[35:07] there
[35:10] against the young people now
[35:14] but not even the young people it's
[35:16] targeting the children
[35:20] you know the the the big thing in the
[35:22] world right now
[35:24] is is the transgender
[35:28] and if you walk into Target
[35:32] the the big backlash now is that they're
[35:35] targeting clothes
[35:37] for for that type of
[35:42] personas but they even have them for the
[35:44] young children
[35:47] so there's this world is nothing but
[35:49] fields
[35:51] and we cannot let that set in our minds
[35:55] because Jesus died on the cross
[35:58] he died for our sins
[36:05] he gave us our salvation
[36:08] and we must keep it in our minds
[36:12] we must battle every day
[36:16] we must the devil's going to come and
[36:18] try to get you to doubt God's word
[36:22] but I can tell you now by his stripes
[36:26] today by his stripes
[36:29] we are already healed
[36:31] it it didn't it didn't happen I didn't
[36:34] get healed today yeah
[36:37] was healed two thousand years ago
[36:40] I didn't give my salvation today
[36:43] I was like my salvation was 2 000 years
[36:46] ago
[36:48] we didn't just get saved today
[36:51] but today we accepted it
[36:54] so the day you accepted your salvation
[36:58] that's when it came into you being
[37:01] upstairs but it happened on the cross
[37:04] Jesus died for our sins Jesus
[37:08] if if right now I shouldn't be here
[37:32] because we must reject doubts that arise
[37:35] from circumstances
[37:43] God rewards our faith
[37:46] with the helmet of salvation firmly and
[37:49] peace in place
[37:52] and we can choose to believe
[37:56] what appears
[37:58] impossible impossible
[38:02] I thought it was impossible that God
[38:03] thought of me
[38:06] I thought it impossible that God could
[38:08] save a man like me
[38:11] I didn't know God's word
[38:14] I didn't know the message
[38:16] I didn't go to church I thought it was
[38:20] impossible that he could save me
[38:23] but it's not impossible
[38:25] when God knows
[38:29] from the foundation of the world
[38:37] knew you were going to be here this day
[38:40] he knew and I you and I were gonna be
[38:43] here
[38:44] and that's what the devil don't like yes
[38:47] he's gonna try and plant that seed of
[38:50] doubt in you and I
[38:52] mean
[38:53] he's gonna battle you for your salvation
[38:56] daily
[38:58] I can't battle you for different things
[39:01] daily
[39:18] maybe to a fault
[39:20] I love sports
[39:22] and I always want to know what's going
[39:24] on
[39:26] but but when I get up at 5 30 in the
[39:29] morning
[39:30] because I get up in the shower
[39:32] and I'll go and I'll make me a cup of
[39:35] coffee
[39:36] and my first thing is to pray
[39:40] but as soon as I sit down to pray
[39:44] there comes a thought turn on Sports
[39:47] Center
[39:50] because he doesn't want you to start out
[39:52] your day thinking of God
[39:56] he doesn't want you to start out the day
[39:59] with the blessings of God
[40:01] he wants to try and stop you every
[40:04] single day
[40:07] that's why we got to get God's we can
[40:09] read God's word
[40:11] we can read the messages
[40:14] we can read the Bible
[40:16] but if we're just reading it
[40:41] because normally if you get
[40:58] you got to protect your heart
[41:02] from the things of this world
[41:09] and you're gonna have things come around
[41:11] you
[41:14] and sometimes things are going to fall
[41:16] apart
[41:20] things are going to fall apart
[41:24] but remember
[41:26] the victory is already won LA Victorious
[41:31] the Battle Is Over
[41:34] Victory is already won
[41:36] there's victory in the camp I have
[41:39] Victorian campamento because he died on
[41:41] the cross
[41:42] but not did he just died
[41:45] he resurrected and if I believe in him
[41:49] and I believe on his word
[41:52] and I have resurrected with him
[41:55] and I can do anything in Christ Jesus
[41:59] we can do anything in Christ
[42:03] we can defeat any Devils
[42:07] you can defeat anything that comes our
[42:10] way
[42:11] we can defeat doubt
[42:14] we can defeat
[42:17] satanas but remember it's going to come
[42:19] with a cause
[42:21] are we willing to pay the cost this
[42:24] evening
[42:28] we gotta find put all our hope in him
[42:32] and as I finish can can we can you pull
[42:35] up Psalm 73 25.
[42:40] all our hope is in Christ Jesus this
[42:43] evening
[42:46] who might have
[42:48] whom have I in heaven
[42:53] and there is none upon Earth
[42:57] that I desire desire besides
[43:06] whom I have in heaven
[43:08] who do we have in heaven but the Lord
[43:12] that's all we need is we know and rely
[43:16] on him this evening
[43:18] the devil's going to come and he's going
[43:20] to try and knock us down
[43:23] he's going to try and stop us to to to
[43:26] realize who we are
[43:29] young people he's going to battle you
[43:32] every single day
[43:34] he's going to try and stop you
[43:37] because he knows when you realize you're
[43:41] a child of God
[43:43] then he really can't stop you and this
[43:46] is
[43:53] going to keep our mind filled with the
[43:56] word of God
[43:58] you gotta keep our hearts filled with
[44:00] the word of God
[44:02] because he wants to destroy you this
[44:04] evening
[44:06] he doesn't want you to seek God's word
[44:10] he doesn't want you to seek God's
[44:12] salvation
[44:14] because he thinks he can get you
[44:17] but there's Victory this evening
[44:21] there's victory in the Lord Jesus Christ
[44:24] and anything is possible
[44:27] as long as you believe on him
[44:33] [Applause]
[44:53] and God bless you
[44:56] let's play like a fifth time that's
[44:57] happened to me
[44:59] so I woke up to the front my jacket
[45:01] pocket gets caught on that
[45:04] maybe I should start walking a little
[45:06] further away from that right
[45:09] amen God bless you
[45:12] good to see each and every one of you
[45:14] if you would all stand to your feet as
[45:16] we read the words
[45:22] let's turn to uh John chapter 14. in
[45:30] Verse 18
[45:33] and it says
[45:35] I will not leave you comfortless
[45:38] I will come to you know
[45:43] a little while and the world seeth me no
[45:46] more
[45:48] but yes you see me
[45:51] because I live you live also because
[46:01] verse 20.
[46:03] at that day you shall know that I am in
[46:06] my father
[46:08] and ye and me
[46:09] and I and you know Padres
[46:20] amen well I had no idea what brother
[46:23] Jerry was going to preach on
[46:24] Mr Jerry well we're in the same spirit
[46:30] and I believe today because
[46:33] seen hearing what he had said
[46:36] I believe that godska has great things
[46:38] in store for us this evening
[46:42] if we're willing to accept that what he
[46:44] has for us
[46:47] you know brother Jerry we're going to
[46:49] talk a little bit about sports today too
[46:52] I'm not as big of a fan sports fan as
[46:54] Jerry but um you want to talk a little
[46:57] bit about it
[47:00] and you know for about a year now I've
[47:02] been watching baseball
[47:06] and uh I never liked baseball never even
[47:09] gave it a chance
[47:11] I thought it was the most boring sport
[47:14] that there was
[47:18] you know so one day we're uh was working
[47:20] with brother Jerry
[47:22] brothers
[47:24] and the Dodgers were going to play those
[47:27] Dodgers
[47:28] and I was like you know what I'm gonna
[47:31] check to see what this is all about he
[47:32] went away
[47:42] I saw a few uh pictures and I'm like Ah
[47:46] that's boring
[47:50] did you see the picture here he's just
[47:52] rubbing the ball I'm like oh yeah last
[47:55] time I just throw that balls
[47:59] you know so I gave it a chance that I I
[48:02] liked it
[48:04] and I actually I like it even more now
[48:06] because they just they made some real
[48:08] changes
[48:11] one of the changes was that now there's
[48:14] a a pitcher Squad
[48:18] and this picture at this clock it's it's
[48:21] one 15 seconds I believe it is so the
[48:23] game's a lot faster now
[48:28] it's a lot more exciting now yes and a
[48:32] lot shorter
[48:34] amen so so now the the picture just
[48:37] can't be there rubbing the ball and
[48:39] doing whatever he's doing frustrating
[48:40] the batter is
[48:45] I think that's what it was I think I
[48:48] think uh brother Jerry can correct me if
[48:49] I'm wrong I think there was this one
[48:51] picture I think he's like 45 seconds he
[48:53] would just sit there just rubbing the
[48:54] ball wait you know before he even
[48:55] pitched the first one
[49:00] you know so again frustrating the batter
[49:05] but yeah you know uh you know and uh and
[49:08] uh
[49:10] somebody was knocking in the back door
[49:12] again
[49:15] um so so the baseball field for those
[49:18] that don't know it's called a diamond
[49:20] is
[49:22] you know so we have your home plate the
[49:25] memos
[49:27] and I think I'm you know pretty much
[49:30] everybody knows this right
[49:32] but for just in case there's somebody
[49:34] that might not know it
[49:37] see there's a there's a first base
[49:39] second base third base and then back
[49:41] home
[49:45] you know so so you know as as we heard
[49:49] from our founding Pastor how he preached
[49:50] the message
[50:08] brother Branham says now
[50:11] you can even get to first base
[50:17] unless you believe the word
[50:20] so you're at home
[50:23] you don't believe the word of God
[50:27] you're struck out before you even get
[50:29] the chance to bet yeah
[50:31] so the first thing we got to do as
[50:34] Believers
[50:36] we have to believe that this is this is
[50:39] the word of God and it's nothing but the
[50:41] truth is
[50:44] no matter what anybody says about it
[50:46] this is the truth
[50:50] this is God in print form
[50:54] and it's the truth yes so now so now
[50:58] everybody believe that that this is the
[51:00] this is the word of God
[51:03] if you believe that okay
[51:08] now you're ready to bet
[51:10] now you're able to listen to get on to
[51:13] first base
[51:16] now now as brother Jerry was saying this
[51:20] is Jerry there was there's uh this so
[51:23] this ball game here is
[51:25] it's the Saints Los Santos versus the
[51:30] devil Diablo and the devil has his team
[51:33] also
[51:34] you know so so before before let's say
[51:38] uh brother brother Isaac gets up to bed
[51:44] well their sane has one of his little
[51:46] minions right that he goes and he hangs
[51:48] around us
[51:51] that's why the angel of the Lord Camp
[51:54] about those that fear you because we
[51:55] have an opposition daily
[52:01] daily at the audio daily each and every
[52:05] one of us there's no escaping that at
[52:06] the area
[52:09] so so there he is he's kind of scoping
[52:11] you out
[52:13] brother Paul and monopol he struggles
[52:17] with this a little bit
[52:19] brother Isaac call you in school
[52:23] I see you struggle just a little bit
[52:25] with this
[52:29] oh the devil sees us and she struggles
[52:33] with that just just a little bit so
[52:38] the minion goes to the pitcher which is
[52:41] another devil
[52:43] and he gives us all the weaknesses
[52:47] he's got a list of all the saints with
[52:50] all your weaknesses
[52:53] everything that you struggle with
[52:56] Okay so
[52:59] so uh
[53:00] snap again away from the public behind
[53:02] us
[53:03] so before he's gonna pitch
[53:10] brother Angelo's gonna brother Angela's
[53:13] up to bat Manu Angelo is okay so what
[53:16] does the devil do inside his hat the
[53:18] picture
[53:20] he has he has a piece of paper here
[53:23] okay so so last time in school he
[53:26] struggled with this
[53:28] so before he pitches takes off his hat
[53:31] and this is
[53:35] Angela struggles with a with a fastball
[53:37] Angelo
[53:42] he struggles with the changeup
[53:46] sister Ruthie you struggle with the
[53:48] changeup
[53:50] struggle with the slider
[53:54] for those that don't know those are
[53:56] different those are different types of
[53:57] pitches
[53:59] there's a bunch of different ones these
[54:02] are just a few that I know
[54:04] so so the the pitcher knows all your
[54:08] weaknesses were not your weekend says
[54:10] our weaknesses where we struggle with
[54:13] that
[54:15] Joe you struggle with the Sinker so he's
[54:18] gonna throw a sinker at you
[54:21] so
[54:23] so now so that that's just at home plate
[54:25] this is before we even swing yes
[54:30] so so but but then but then the good
[54:33] thing is that there's a coach
[54:35] and and there's a what's called a
[54:38] batters coach also
[54:41] so he teaches the the batter don't swing
[54:43] at just any
[54:47] pitches
[54:49] okay so so this picture he likes to
[54:52] throw this and he knows your weakness
[54:53] don't swing at that
[55:00] so we hit it boom it's a grounder
[55:04] so now we can go to first base because
[55:06] first of all we believe the word of God
[55:08] now we now we can run to first base
[55:11] which is recognizing the Lord Jesus
[55:13] Christ Brothers
[55:18] recognizing that we're in dire need of
[55:20] Salvation
[55:22] there is no salvation outside of Jesus
[55:25] Christ
[55:27] we got to recognize that he paid the
[55:29] price for me for you and for all of us
[55:35] he paid the price to redeem us
[55:39] to take us out of the pawn shop
[55:43] and so that we can get to second base
[55:48] so now so now
[55:50] so now the only way that that brother
[55:54] Angelo can make it to second base
[55:58] now he's depending on brother Noah
[56:01] depended oh but but the pitcher knows
[56:06] he struggles with the force him
[56:11] he also struggles with the change
[56:16] but don't worry because we got a coach
[56:21] amen so so so so so so so Angelo needs
[56:24] to get to second base and it's dependent
[56:26] on brother Noah
[56:30] now now now now we know we know this
[56:34] that that our our leader determines our
[56:38] Eternal destination right
[56:42] destination right so but are also are
[56:46] also our attitude towards our brother
[56:48] also determines our his destination
[56:56] and the message the Great Commission
[57:00] and what about a brother that's made a
[57:02] mistake
[57:04] oh I see he's wrong
[57:07] sometimes he's accused wrong when he's
[57:09] not wrong
[57:12] but if he is wrong
[57:15] well if we take him to the throne of God
[57:21] your shoulder to shoulder with him
[57:24] knowing that he's Immortal
[57:28] and maybe his destination rest is
[57:34] Upon Our attitude towards him
[57:38] when we come back from the Throne of God
[57:42] we'll realize that everyone guilty
[57:47] and we all need help from one another
[57:52] way to do it is
[57:56] so now brother Angelo's destination is
[57:59] resting on brother Noah what he's going
[58:01] to hit
[58:05] that that's that's if he's not if if
[58:08] they don't get him out yes
[58:10] and second base is recognizing who the
[58:13] prophet is
[58:15] we recognize that Jesus Paid the price
[58:18] for us Jesus
[58:32] with a message of restoration
[58:35] and he begins to I I this is one of my
[58:39] favorite quotes right here
[58:41] and blasphemous names brother Branham
[58:43] says he's repeating the the dream of
[58:46] sister Shepard is
[58:49] so brother Branham is in work overalls
[58:52] in
[58:59] so he's got a bucket of most Crystal
[59:02] Clear pure water
[59:07] so he begins to pour into this rock box
[59:10] right
[59:13] so he's beginning to pour out the
[59:16] message
[59:21] everything that's in that rock Box all
[59:23] the trash begins to boil out
[59:29] and and that's that's what happens to us
[59:32] right when the message comes forth it
[59:34] begins to take out all our garbage
[59:36] everything that we're out of a leperous
[59:38] hand that was we heard on Sunday right
[59:44] he begins to Output right
[59:49] what was poured into him
[59:52] he's a dispenser right
[59:55] [Music]
[59:57] we can recognize all what God God sent
[1:00:00] us a mighty message of restoration
[1:00:05] now now now brother Ethan he's up to bat
[1:00:09] yeah
[1:00:10] now Angelo's destination and brother and
[1:00:13] brother Noah's is also depending on what
[1:00:15] Ethan's gonna back
[1:00:20] where so the goal is home right
[1:00:24] that's our goal is as a as a group of
[1:00:29] ministers as a body of ministers
[1:00:32] that's our goal is our goal is to be
[1:00:36] able to live the faith of the people
[1:00:43] amen that's the goal of the faithful
[1:00:45] ministry right it is
[1:00:52] man
[1:01:14] but there's a danger now
[1:01:17] there's a short stop right
[1:01:23] now now the shortstop is probably
[1:01:26] responsible for the most double plays
[1:01:28] there is
[1:01:35] because most right most batters are
[1:01:37] right-handed they throw the ball that
[1:01:39] way
[1:01:44] so that that's the place where where
[1:01:46] they're gonna strike you out the fastest
[1:01:48] or to get you out the fastest
[1:01:50] second and third man
[1:01:57] man so brother so brother Ethan hits it
[1:02:00] boom it's a it's a pop life
[1:02:04] Angelo's running to third one
[1:02:07] no one's running to seconds
[1:02:10] running the first
[1:02:13] and they're all safe now
[1:02:17] what happens in third base
[1:02:21] he says I will send you another
[1:02:23] comforter right because
[1:02:26] and from there and from Sister
[1:02:29] Shepherd's dream is
[1:02:31] Shepherd from The Prophet Del profeta
[1:02:34] dumps out the rock the water into the
[1:02:36] Rock Box
[1:02:38] all the trash comes out
[1:02:41] now now from that rock box
[1:02:44] comes five streams of the most Crystal
[1:02:46] Clear pure water
[1:02:50] but where's this going to
[1:02:53] it's on top of the mountains
[1:02:56] he's dumping the water from the top
[1:02:59] it's five streams all the way down
[1:03:04] who's the beneficiary
[1:03:10] for what for the for your Perfection for
[1:03:14] my perfection
[1:03:16] again for the unity of the Body for the
[1:03:19] edification
[1:03:21] do we come to the unity of the faith
[1:03:25] again from Faith to Faith
[1:03:29] as I said our goal as a Ministry is
[1:03:34] to lift up
[1:03:42] again another one of my favorite quotes
[1:03:47] because what's what's the purpose here
[1:03:50] the purpose is to get Angelo home
[1:03:55] that's the purpose
[1:03:58] that's our purpose as a Ministry
[1:04:01] to get everyone home
[1:04:04] we want to get Angelo home we want to
[1:04:08] get Ruthie home you want to get Ethan
[1:04:11] home
[1:04:12] we want to get you home that's our
[1:04:28] no if I can just sacrifice just to you
[1:04:31] him who is in scoring position
[1:04:36] just sacrifice just a little bit so he
[1:04:38] can run home
[1:04:40] because the team with the most points
[1:04:42] wins
[1:04:44] is that the goal to come home
[1:04:50] why what happens at home yeah now Angela
[1:04:54] can recognize who he is
[1:04:57] he's seen Jesus Christ you recognize the
[1:05:00] sacrifice that Jesus Christ made
[1:05:04] he's accepted a prophet acceptable
[1:05:07] prophet he is a center of faithful
[1:05:09] Ministry
[1:05:10] that faithful Ministry is pointing them
[1:05:13] to me to who he is
[1:05:16] the goal to reach that to get for him to
[1:05:19] reach to recognize who he is
[1:05:23] that's the goal to get him home but he
[1:05:25] must recognize who he is
[1:05:33] brother Branham says
[1:05:36] we're not building an organization
[1:05:40] and I'm going to say tell you Church
[1:05:43] building an organization
[1:05:46] organization he says I'm not here
[1:05:50] but I'm going to say we're not here
[1:05:54] to build an organization
[1:05:59] to build an organization
[1:06:09] Christ sent us
[1:06:13] huh
[1:06:15] to build individuals
[1:06:19] not not not not just just the boys or
[1:06:22] the or the menones to build individuals
[1:06:27] Hermanas to build to build individuals
[1:06:30] for my individuals to the stature of
[1:06:32] Jesus Christ
[1:06:47] it might be the powerhouse
[1:06:52] oh I feel it now and the dwelling place
[1:06:55] of the Spirit
[1:06:58] by his word build up the individuals
[1:07:05] not build an organization to a greater
[1:07:08] denomination
[1:07:10] but build the individual to a son and a
[1:07:14] daughter
[1:07:19] sorry
[1:07:21] that's the goal that's our goal as a
[1:07:24] Ministry is
[1:07:26] Sons and Daughters what West what our
[1:07:28] goal should be
[1:07:30] to build up individuals
[1:07:36] to recognize who we are God put his
[1:07:39] power his power in his church yes
[1:07:45] Christ poured himself into the church
[1:07:48] that's why he says
[1:07:52] I'm not looking at a fat day no more
[1:07:55] bro Tommy would always say about about
[1:07:57] his father
[1:07:59] yeah oh it says all at that day
[1:08:04] what day is that
[1:08:06] he says I recognize that that day is
[1:08:15] that day is this day
[1:08:23] for it's the whole planet that's the
[1:08:26] whole thing is one plan of redention
[1:08:28] coming down
[1:08:32] coming back to living
[1:08:35] coming back to living
[1:08:38] and dwell with immoral and commune
[1:08:46] as he did at the beginning
[1:08:49] so what's the deal to come back home
[1:08:53] the restoration of Eden the restoration
[1:08:56] we were with him and we can only do it
[1:08:59] when we recognize who we are
[1:09:03] it's great to recognize the sacrifice
[1:09:06] that he did it is
[1:09:09] prayed to recognize our prophets
[1:09:12] it's great you recognize the ministry
[1:09:15] we must know who we are
[1:09:19] going nowhere
[1:09:29] I have no idea how long they've been
[1:09:30] going for it tomorrow
[1:09:35] sometimes we feel like cowards right
[1:09:36] this is
[1:09:40] because maybe some maybe one time we you
[1:09:43] struck us out
[1:09:45] but if he struck you out
[1:09:48] don't worry it's okay you're gonna be up
[1:09:52] too bad again
[1:09:54] don't don't get stuck
[1:09:57] don't get stuck that he struck you out
[1:10:02] you struggled with something and it's
[1:10:04] okay
[1:10:05] we all struggle with a certain thing
[1:10:09] but we have coaches
[1:10:11] we have a coach
[1:10:13] there's a coach at first base also
[1:10:17] don't worry don't worry you struck out
[1:10:20] it's okay
[1:10:23] with our help we don't make it home
[1:10:28] that's that's our goal that's our
[1:10:30] purposes so that you can make it home
[1:10:34] who's the most famous
[1:10:36] baseball player ever again
[1:10:40] all this even the sisters
[1:10:44] Babe Ruth right Babe Ruth he's got a
[1:10:47] he's by part of probably the by far the
[1:10:49] most famous uh baseball player there is
[1:10:55] brother Jerry what's he famous for
[1:10:58] he's the Home Run King right and Ray de
[1:11:02] los home runs the Colossus of clouds
[1:11:06] the Great Bambino El Gran Bambino
[1:11:10] Terror
[1:11:22] what was he what was he known for for
[1:11:24] his home runs right
[1:11:26] home runs but did you know Babe Ruth
[1:11:30] struck out 1 000 pero Babe Ruth
[1:11:36] 1330 times
[1:11:39] can you believe that he struck out 1 330
[1:11:43] times
[1:11:45] he's not known for his strikeouts
[1:11:49] almost double the amount of home runs
[1:11:51] that he had
[1:11:53] and it's all right you strike out once
[1:11:56] you strike out twice it's all right
[1:11:58] he's not known for his foreign
[1:12:19] this evening if you struck out
[1:12:28] you know but this is this is the one of
[1:12:31] the things that I like about Babe Ruth's
[1:12:33] stats
[1:12:37] the 714 home runs that's awesome
[1:12:44] but did you know that he had twice as
[1:12:47] many RBIs
[1:12:52] breakoutsadas
[1:12:54] was an RBI
[1:13:09] so Church
[1:13:10] Iglesia if you play something soft
[1:13:13] brother will go
[1:13:17] now that was the Holy Spirit
[1:13:19] I had no idea what brother Jerry was
[1:13:22] going to
[1:13:24] preacheri the unity of the spirit of
[1:13:26] what we're talking about
[1:13:29] you just got told this morning that he
[1:13:31] was going to preacher
[1:13:35] it's the same
[1:13:37] spiritu and that spirit is here this
[1:13:39] evening
[1:13:42] you struck out
[1:13:45] we got lots of coaches here
[1:13:48] we have a lot of brothers that can help
[1:13:51] you that can instruct you then
[1:13:57] if you feel in your heart
[1:14:00] and you want to come up to the front
[1:14:02] where the ministers can pray for you
[1:14:03] that's fine
[1:14:09] if you fill in your heart
[1:14:14] if you can believe the vessel he is here
[1:14:17] tonight
[1:14:29] you might say brother Ronnie he says I
[1:14:33] have Jesus in my heart thank God Jesus
[1:14:35] he's there brother
[1:14:40] he was also on the ship with the
[1:14:41] disciples
[1:14:45] while the storm was raging
[1:14:50] Jesus on the boat didn't change the
[1:14:52] storm Jesus
[1:14:55] and maybe this evening maybe you're in a
[1:14:58] storm
[1:15:00] maybe the devil keeps on striking you
[1:15:02] out he says
[1:15:04] maybe he's throwing things your way
[1:15:07] maybe your ship is rocking back and
[1:15:10] forth
[1:15:12] you're struggling
[1:15:14] maybe you're lonely
[1:15:17] fastball that he throws you yes
[1:15:22] maybe you're anxious
[1:15:26] you're alone solo and the devil keeps on
[1:15:29] throwing that ball at you
[1:15:32] and you're throwing the Sinker at you
[1:15:36] and maybe we've sunk down so much that
[1:15:39] we don't think that there's hope for us
[1:15:45] but as long as there's a man of God
[1:15:47] which there is
[1:15:51] we will go down in the mud and take you
[1:15:54] out
[1:15:57] Jesus on the ship didn't change the
[1:16:00] outcome of it Jesus
[1:16:04] it's not until Jesus speaks
[1:16:07] when you have when you make it home
[1:16:10] you recognize who you are
[1:16:13] you recognize that you also have the
[1:16:16] power of the spoken word
[1:16:19] all you need to do is Wake Jesus up
[1:16:23] Jesus and speak the word yeah
[1:16:27] that's what changed the outcome of the
[1:16:29] storm is
[1:16:31] not Jesus being on the ship
[1:16:37] but him speaking the word
