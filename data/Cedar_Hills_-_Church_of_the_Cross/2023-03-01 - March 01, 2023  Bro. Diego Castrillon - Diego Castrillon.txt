Matthew 5 verse 8. I invite you if you can stand to your feet let us honor the word of the Lord the scripture says Matthew 5 verse 8. I'm sure that most of us have read this at least a hundred times we know it by memory he said blessed are the pure in heart and I'm going to read it again are the pure in hearts for they shall see God let us pray Lord good evening Lord we are here surrendered with our hearts Open Lord we trust [Music] senior activated that you inspired through thy precious son the Lord Jesus these words gave us the inspiration break the bread and that we may be able to leave from this place better Lord we praise you and the numbers in the name of the Lord Jesus is our prayer go ahead and take your seat is to a people that one day gave their hearts to the Lord okay people that say we are Christians because we want to be like Christ and not only do you want to be like this but we want to see God I am a Christian because I want to see God I want to see him that saved me that died on the cross foreign [Music] [Music] these are the words of Jesus that they are who are going to see Jesus are they that are pure in heart now the word pure get a holy son those who have a holy the word holy this is brother Branham says set aside for service it means consecrated Sanctified holy has been dedicated blessed are the pure in Hearts those who have dedicated their heart to the Lord let us turn to Isaiah 57. so that we can put our context here Isaiah 57 15. I was thinking about speaking on faith I wanted to continue that line of Faith but the Lord at this evening had put this on my heart and I pray that it can be a help for everyone so here is a prophet Isaiah Isaiah 57 15. now listen to these words and how it is it says stand to your feet that now you can doubt it peroci El Presidente now now if the president it says the president of the United States that has all the armies of the United States he says to stand to your feet You're Gonna Stand to your face eternity listen I inhabit now who is saying this is telling you that we're here now I want to know where he abides whose name is Holy I dwell in the high and holy place in holiness in EPA he wanted to know that that one Israel to know and we see it here in Leviticus 11 verse 45. Leviticus 11 45 says I want to run but I can't I I gave glory to God he has control yes important that is the most important thing is Leviticus 11 45. for I am the Lord that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt listen God is talking to his children the people of Israel to be your God ye shall therefore be holy foreign [Applause] God is your prophet Isaiah that one day God became flesh that all that God was that he poured it into a Tabernacle Jesus called Jesus Christ Jesus the scripture says blessings this place has been consecrated this piece of land you and I could be here this is the first place was first consecrated because there has to be a holy spirit this place is we have to come in holiness if we come to preach the ministers we are a special class we are some greater than others a class that God has chosen foreign [Music] that's why there has to be Holiness brother Branham says power Brothers the Bible says we should go from Victory to victory in the Rota sometimes the question is for they shall see God come on How could somebody come and sing if you were not consecrated it is the ministers it is a privilege when Jesus I say when he made that beautiful prayer it is a padre and he says father foreign for them foreign my older brother the first thing they're going to say is now when you enter through those doors foreign the scripture says immoral I dwell and the Brokenhearted the hearts that are criticizing and murmuring in the Brokenhearted through those doors because I came to see God foreign Iglesia that's why I don't talk in church that's why I don't get my phone to make phone calls in the church because this is my living room here people come here to receive you don't hear that people want to see God when you come back with a broken heart with a pure heart you shall see God how can you sit in this views and have something against your brother something against your sister when it has been preached on that what an embarrassment I'm gonna finish I don't know what brother Caleb had in his heart or a head in his heart ahead in his heart when he tried to challenge Moses the servant of God and when you read the Bible and you're going to see that that the the words of quora brings us Moses we are also holy qures because Cora knew that God moved in holiness but you know what scares me about Korra okay that he had the capacity they not only to resist Moses but but to deceive 150 people are with them you see what happens when you say I'm not in agreement with them I'm not here to be in agreement I am here because I believe the words I I come here because I believe God I come here because I believe you and my brothers and sisters [Music] to preach ERS [Music] the one of Moses the spirits don't die he criticized he was jealous it's the same thing the spirits don't die but the thing did not stay there Moses he stood for Moses for for quora yeah [Music] children solamente Murio and only those that were murmuring died the the children of corridoro salmos and you read it there in the Psalms and such beautiful Psalms and with the gifts that the children of Korah had because the children of course never stood they never stood and backed up that murmuring it's their brothers we have lowered the bar of Holiness with what we have we cannot do it you have to be sure now I tell you guitar [Music] editor maybe they can edit this later God through the gift that he has given me I can see the heart of the people because that is the way we can help them it is a man so so humble ingredients I'm not making the man great I thank the Lord for our pastors because the Lord let me see his heart that loves the people foreign Titus foreign [Music] listen unto the pure all things all things it doesn't say a few things it says all things unto the pure all things are pure you understand and to the pure all things are pure all things are pure because there's no malice because we don't have nothing negative in our hearts because we believe that you are the sons and daughters of God and because we respect you how are we going to say something again how can we say something that is going to hurt you all things are pure para loss but keep on reading math foreign God gave me this this morning the lord gave me a vision and in this vision is I had to be in my position and I'm speaking this because I was in the military and I had to be in my position and I tried and I tried and I couldn't enter into my position and I was afraid is my studies my training I had to be a position I I wasn't there the uh Air Force but if I'm not in possession I don't have authority foreign and I know that by this vision that there are people that are not in their position today is the time if you got out of your position get back in position brother Brandon says that when the church begins to March it is when the body begins to move I invite you to close your eyes you have called me to holiness Lord that is what I have to do Holiness unto the Lord Lord forgive me your prophet Isaiah he had committed many errors Lord but you forgave him because he confessed his sin your word says that if we were to confess our sins and we were to separate ourselves that we shall reach Mercy Lord deceiving I pray for your children Lord that this this message may it help us enter into our position The Authority that I was given thy children thing that may be sufficient and that we can face the devil and all of his friends Lord bless our pastor the minister the musicians the trustees the Deacons all the people that are here that we will be
