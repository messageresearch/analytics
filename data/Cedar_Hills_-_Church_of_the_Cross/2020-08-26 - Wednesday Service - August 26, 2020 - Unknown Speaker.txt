god is he alive in you instead oh my my i am so privileged to have this opportunity so soon again to share with you about privilege the inoculation of how god remember what is the inoculation of god what is it yes it's the holy ghost but tonight we want to see how jesus paid the price for all this como jesus we're going to see how the resurrection to be able to deliver on what he had told them so that he could breathe upon them and say receive the holy ghost i don't want to get ahead of myself but it's such a privilege and honor i thank our pastor let me look at the clock at 7 30 on the dot so pray for me that i i stay obedient turn in our bibles to acts chapter 2. and we're going to go to verse 23 verse 23 and we're going to read to verse 27 amen amen him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of god you have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain whom god has raised up having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible that he should be held of it for david speaks concerning him i foresaw the lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that i should not be moved therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad more also moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope so i say to your flesh tonight amen amen so we don't have to get all worked up when we get attacked by the devil oh we do i have but as we mature in the lord it just gets to the point the other day i told satan when he came to bother me i asked him don't you have anything better to do than to try to bother god's children but i guess he'll do it until the resurrection comes verse 27 because you will not leave my soul in hell look how personal this got to jesus you're not going to leave my soul in hell neither will you allow your holy one to seek corruption now let's jump to verse 31 to save on a little bit of time but read read this whole thing at home he's seen this before spoke of the resurrection of christ that his soul was not left in hell neither his flesh did seek corruption this jesus has god raised up where for of we are witnesses for the privilege to speak to your children lord thank you lord jesus now bless us and bless our efforts to bring forth your word lord and may it be you speaking to your children in the name of the lord jesus christ this jesus has god raised up whereof we are all witnesses it's the same verse still in acts 2 how many of you are witnesses what is the status on testigos we have as some of our colored brothers might say can i have a witness what to have a witness you have to be a witness but uh praise the lord jesus christ but watch this next verse and maybe this won't make a total sense right now i thought i understood this verse but as i dug into this on the inoculation of god and immunity i come to find out that the prophet spoke spoke about inoculate inoculation almost a hundred times that is he investors he spoke about it in every way you could think from every angle you could imagine diablo first of all he said when god was going to send this inoculation normally an inoculation they'll use a guinea pig a rat in the laboratory to test him first to see if it's going to work on the rats because why from the time that jesus went down to be baptized to john and the heavens were opened and god said this is my son in especially in order to treat or prevent a disease and then brother bram said as jesus went along in his everyday life jesus as he came up to matthew four and he had received the spirit yeah received the inoculation was going to be tested against the very satan himself and the inoculation health but by true it over and over again then that day came when he was nailed on calvary brother god was testing the inoculation he was testing whether there could truly come an immunity first of the soul where it would resist every evil spirit every thought of unbelief every attribute of fl flesh and it held the inoculation of god was speaking to you and me of love amen and it's here tonight yes do you believe that tonight you know i can get going and then i'll never get to some of this other good stuff here to me it's good not because it's me but because it's the bible let's go to acts chapter 13. verses 32 to 35. this is another scripture that i kind of sort of thought that i understood but you know what the holy spirit just stopped me i forgot to read verse 33 of the chapter see i'm just human how many make mistakes every day if you could call this a mistake real quick just put your finger right there just go back to chapter two regress therefore being by the right hand of god exalted comma of the father the promise of the holy ghost i thought that that has was something that had already happened by the time that jesus got to the right hand of the father but as i begin to study the inoculation i understood by the scriptures and the messages that jesus even though he spoke of the holy ghost john chapters 4 through 17 how many have read those chapters about the holy ghost he spoke of what would happen when the holy ghost would come but did you know that in order for him to fulfill on what he had spoken he had to overcome death hell and the graves and resurrect and now he had to go to the father he had to ascend to the father if you read the scripture the way it's in its context let's read it again therefore being by the right hand of god exalted notice in spanish it just says it's a it's an exalted but in spanish in english it says being in espanol he had overcome and now he had the right to remain there aviator therefore being by the right hand of god exalted and having received the of the father the promise of the holy ghost he has now shed this forth which you see which means 7 30 8 30 and if i can do it faster i will to breathe upon them he did not breathe upon them before he was glorified glorification but after he was glorified and he came back first there's no book like the book of john that explains explicit every little detail of what happened from the time jesus rose from the dead until the time he went to heaven to play it on marcus this you say you can go to luke 24. and i will just quote to you verse 49 where he said now tarry ye there in the city he is glorified we're going to get to that in just a minute and you may say this scripture that i'm giving you the protocol doesn't have anything to do with what happened after the resurrection thank the lord for correcting me on that because i would have left that piece out and i said i was going to read it and then and we declare to you glad tidings how that the promise which was made to the fathers god has fulfilled the same to us to us their children and in that he has raised up jesus again as it is written in the second psalm you are my son this day have i begotten thee and as concerning that he raised him up from the dead now no more to return to corruption he said on this wise i will give you the sure mercies of david wherefore he says also in another psalm you shall not allow your holy one to seek corruption how is it that in the previous verse it says that he would not return to corruption but in the next verse that repeats acts chapter 2. and the psalms that his soul would not be left in hell that there appears to be a contradiction a contradiction because what could have been corrupted in jesus christ i'm not gonna allow my holy one to stay in the grave more than 72 hours three days and three nights amen because his body would begin to corrupt why would god say that if there wasn't a possibility of a cell in his body to corrupt and this is delicate stuff how is it that in our soul we have the holy ghost the name of the spirit the inoculation of the holy spirit but yet in our flesh because of the fall we have corruption and i'm not referring see contrary to the puppy belief of many contrary even in the message that think they understand the virgin birth and i'm not throwing it i used to see it the same way but i had a man by the name of thomas perez it could come [Music] the scripture says that they their pharisees they they rebuked him he says you not yet being 50 years old and you say before abraham was i am it is well he was only 30 years old and he looked like he was 50. he aged one day he leaned up on a rock and he had a headache in the book the prince of the house of david in the liberal so what does it mean then significa here in this verse that he would not return to corruption and i'm going to leave that there right now because you're going to have a lot of questions on that one i'm not going to just leave it there we'll get to it eventually what we're going to find out that it's talking exactly about the same thing that happened when jesus arose from the dead and mary wanted to touch him he said don't touch me and brother tommy says in the message hinder me not he says 1997. he says don't hinder me don't meet us don't i have not yet ascended to my father yes indeed and then he makes this statement jesus was still in the office of a son there was a genealogy you could trace to him yet become the glorified god glorificator don't hinder me and if i don't become transformed and we're not going to finish it tonight i can tell you i've got i've still got a half an hour and i could just run through it but i'm not going to do that but i'm just giving you a picture of where we're going jesus knew jesus that in his humanity there was a capability that he could see corruption that's a then he's our big brother not just in the spiritual sense but in a natural sense now with that said we need this scripture right here for right now and now i want to go back to the last quote we got into the other night the last one and let me get it here i think they've got it up there i gave them the notes it's out of the message god's provided way of i'm going to start at about the middle of paragraph 42 is to not read the whole thing the bible predicts that in the last days i'm in the brother i'm in the paragraph yes let me see where are we at i'm a little further down it's there but it's a lot harder for me to pick it out here than it is just to pick it out on my phone so i'll use my phone the bible predicts that in the last days there would be a germ warfare [Music] how much kind of teachers have we got to be brethren to get the church in order to be in that condition in [Music] significa not when you're born again oh yeah we how many know we start at the bottom of the pyramid justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost is amen amen and then it's baptism after baptism all the way to the top of the pyramids where the great seal is on the ground that's the ball brother this is what we're reading here is the goal to reach that goal that we've got to reach that goal i like the way he goes in the next paragraph my arms are sore now somewhere the doctors has punched needles in the doctor to try to inoculate me from yellow fever and so forth i told them i didn't need it but they wouldn't listen to me but i'll tell you what god's going to do god's got a serum and it's called the holy ghost when that serum goes in what the pastor said about the antibacterial antibodies of the the ointment that mary bought that was worth one year's wage i don't have time for it maybe someday the lord will let me go into that how tremendous it's a bomb it's an anointing it's something so precious and when that inoculation goes in it's the holy ghost hallelujah and i remember one time during the 37th flood everybody had to take typhoid shots anybody ever had the typhoid shot okay i've got that shot then go ahead he said you did you well did it make you sick i said no no no it sure didn't no he said when did you get your shots and i said i get one about every hour brother and we finished with this but i wanted you to get this if we can't have faith for divine healing and if he lives in you to such a point that he saturates your soul and your body from the inside out kill every fiber of your being [Music] uh oh now they're going to give us 40 percent that we can have in here i mean you heard the news that means we can have 120. oh glory to god oh brother that's not five feet brother or one son that's only three and a half feet long you see you see where will you see yes we should try the social distance still as long as it's possible once we hit 50 it's going to get real hard to do social differences but if we are walking with god and we are doing what we wash our hands and sanitize our hands so many times a day i can't even i can't even remember how many times i'll walk in the garage and take off my shoes before i go in go back out and spray them and wipe them off go in the when something or infringe on the rights of anybody else we are just going to go up a little higher god knew this was coming he allowed it it's his foreknowledge how many believe that went to screen brother i can't believe that this is the devil yeah it was also the devil when lucifer got in the serpent with god and brought lucifer to judgment for the sin that began in heaven because sin never started on earth and god said god is saying of you and me these sicknesses to judgment then [Applause] i was in a ministerial meeting with brother tommy and this is not in the notes every so many feet going across this water i take a step and then i'll take a step to another pastor he said can you follow me then he said okay same scene but the he says and now when i step where he tells me to step well put my paddle he goes can you still follow goes now we're standing on the edge of this river and there are no rocks in the water you know he goes as the lord tells me to step well i mean i i i was shocked that was my first minister's meeting i had just moved to silver prior to that and i was called i was all beat up i was in a trauma just i remember one of the first messages i ever heard was trauma and i was in such a trauma trauma comes when you get a blow after blowing and it causes a bruise and you you go into a trauma and then i don't know how many a week or two went by and he asked me to preach he asked me [Music] i would rather listen to your the ministers that are already here i i i i just don't feel like i'm in too good of shape he says you just do what i ask you to do and everything will be okay i did eloise and here we are in 2020. worshiping the living god how many are happy tonight amen amen let's go to our next quote in the message he cares amen and i want to go back i'm going to go down here yeah let's just start at 105. what makes disease come to the human body because bengal how many no and the pastor had mentioned this to me the other day that your immune system generally speaking is in your gut again and if you have problems there then there's problems with your immune system and actually with a little bit of study i found out that over 70 of the cells that make up the immune system the components are in the guts and i've had a lot of problems there that's why it's tremendous to me how god stopped this thing that hit us because i don't have the best immune system in the world because you don't think it's always had problems in the gut but i also believe that i will restore all things in your restoration so let's take care of our gut gastronomica believe me i've changed my eating though what i eat and how much i ate and i just pray that the lord really changes me and it's not just for a little while momentum feels so much better than even before that stupid plague hit us god is so good how about how do you feel that god has healed you i am told by precious doctor friend of mine that i wouldn't want to call his name right now but his very fine brother reading to me recently out of the medical journal a book in his office where he keeps all these fine books and the latest stuff on medicine it is weakness you notice anybody that's real you say your body runs down you take a cold right quick what is it yes it is the weakness of your body that produces a mucus out of your glands it is amen and in that the cold germ beds itself and you got a cold yeah but if that body was strong it would throw he was immune from disease oh my when he created adam he was immune he was immune from any disease that took a man away from god and it's still talk taking it let's talk about adam abdemus now the scripture says in first corinthians 15 45 we won't turn there my time is rapidly fleeing that the first man the first adam the first man adam was made why was it alive because he was inoculated he had the holy spirit you say yes yes before the fall he had the holy spirit but that holy spirit had such a control of him now this is before the fall and none of the cells of his body had been corrupt he had been formed out of the dust of the earth sickness could not get in him even if it tried left because he had a perfectly formed body out of the dust of the earth and he had a living soul well i'm 66. i think was just anti-seize so if i make it to 80 i'll be doing awesome if i make a cast idiot the lord cherished i can just see brother benjamin say i'm just tired of this old pest house and hear our founding pastor say oh i'm so tired of this testimony that adam was glorified he had a spirit in him that was glorified but if he would have been glorified in other words his spiritual body is a celestial body is malcolm x and broadband says it in plain english but what he was separated from the theophany he was placed in human flesh these are things that we can study more and more now let's read verse 54 of the same chapter so when this corruptable shall have put on incorruption [Music] well that's that's an easy one right it's fascinating jesus christ our savior christopher salvador when he prayed for the lepers when he touched the lepers that was a contagious disease what and as long as god wanted him on earth there was nothing satan could do about it was there any story in the book of acts that showed somebody was immune to a sickness or to a poison and it was a storm came up and the angel of the lord stood there and told him you won't lose one man and then when they got to lance they were standing at this fire and the scripture says a viper jumped up and did i haven't found it [Music] in the late 1890s have you ever wondered how brother brennan got to know ff bosworth in chicago illinois in chicago illinois and they were very radical you got together some of the things you would you would question they didn't believe in doctors we believe in doctors they had these rooms they still have some there in in chicago are you in chicago they have some in washington and they call them healing rooms and many people person after person was healed that two minutes down to two minutes and brother ben said alexander dalby died one day though alexander died one day alexander muriel and i was born the next day and exactly according to the prophecy that dali prophesied 40 years later the lord sent him to south africa africa and the bubonic plague was killing people by the hundreds they didn't have what we have today brother david look at the name of zoe all the help these machines these respirators they didn't have any of that and people were laying in the streets and brother leki goes to those that are in charge and says i you're signing your own death warrant he says he said the world if that plague touches me it will die [Applause] in christ jesus christ so you want to go and help bury the dead with no protection well let's do the test first there's a dead body there gross right i'll go and they put it on his hands and put it on his hands and they watched it died his followers oh my that's getting awful white up here it's getting very milky looking here how is it that they didn't even have the revelation he follows oh no you know that that last video that night after that the pastor played that or the day i can't remember it was day or night [Music] i called brother caleb and i said do you have that little video legend i go nothing against brother henry he did the best he could no no henry diego speaking and he was speaking on top of him and it was just just barely understandable i don't know how many of you understood that and that same night or the same day when he sent it to me i watched it very carefully for two times and i noticed him every day that when he got to the part because he says why they were those demons were having a meeting [Music] allergies [Music] then there was the famous kovit there lugos ezra pastor mentioned the other day he was not a very big guy but the big daddy of a moth under the name are presented themselves as cove what else filthy lie of the devil that's why i talk to different people and they would have symptoms and they want to go to the doctor he but the most tremendous thing about that vision what i feared the most was that the people would lose our leadership sorry i've already gone over time five minutes but this is not brother jimmy now jimmy no no this isn't brother jimmy how could we lose our leadership when we let that spirit of fear get on us and we're looking around us we're looking behind us [Music] to not return to corruption or not seek corruption another time when you see it it is going to do something to you but i'll by the message of the hour leading his home just the enemy trying to block us from that supernatural dimension [Music] [Music] he said you'll die but death will be such a short thing that he'll quicken change your body the glorification will come love glorification people say well if it's going to come then i'll just wait for it no no no no then you hear what our pastor said sunday where you take one step towards the theophany that theophany i'll take a step towards you yes we'll hit you but before you can drop to the ground and satan thought he was going to block us god bless you bendigo [Applause] amen amen god bless god bless his word amen [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] i [Music] [Music] yes oh [Music] year [Music]
