[0:06] shalom
[0:08] my precious
[0:10] brother
[0:13] our
[0:15] beloved
[0:17] founder of shida his church of the cross
[0:23] i took this opportunity to
[0:27] appreciate you
[0:29] and let you know how much we do value
[0:32] you
[0:34] just because of what
[0:36] you felt
[0:37] for africa it has been
[0:40] out of
[0:42] the vision of brother branham
[0:46] that equipped you to have a feeling
[0:50] for africa
[0:52] i would really want to say that
[0:56] there was no way out
[0:59] that i would ever know you and you would
[1:02] ever know me
[1:06] if our prophet
[1:10] never had a feeling for africa
[1:13] and i also know that it was not our
[1:16] prophet
[1:19] willing to be coming to africa but the
[1:22] lord jesus himself wanted to come to
[1:24] africa
[1:26] i have read his quote
[1:29] where many times
[1:32] brother branham
[1:35] wanted to come to east africa even to
[1:38] uganda
[1:40] but the religious order of his day
[1:43] and the law
[1:45] of his day would not permit him
[1:49] to come
[1:50] [Music]
[1:52] and yet the spirit was willing
[1:58] in this regard
[2:03] every every man would get to have a
[2:05] feeling that
[2:08] there were souls
[2:11] that were entangled in the land of
[2:13] africa
[2:15] that would one day need to hear
[2:18] the omega voice of our lord jesus
[2:23] this would make
[2:24] evil men
[2:26] and willing men
[2:28] risk their lives
[2:31] to travel to the jungles of
[2:34] africa i am particularly
[2:37] giving my voice to you because of how
[2:40] much
[2:42] we have been touched by
[2:45] the love of your sons
[2:48] and associates ministers that they have
[2:51] always struggled with
[2:53] brother caleb
[2:55] and brother tommy jr
[2:59] i have always
[3:01] tried so much to think of them
[3:05] how they would risk
[3:08] their lives
[3:09] [Music]
[3:10] to travel and come to uganda and most of
[3:13] all
[3:15] dare their
[3:16] lives to reach
[3:20] this part of our country that has been
[3:23] named
[3:24] [Music]
[3:25] a place of rebellion in history
[3:30] many people have been murdered maine
[3:34] different kind of atrocities until
[3:38] our land which is actually land
[3:42] is in the world map as
[3:46] an area that has been
[3:49] constantly in war and
[3:51] the people their own good look so fierce
[3:54] and
[3:56] hard
[3:57] to stay
[3:58] with and indeed even from within uganda
[4:03] many missionaries have always been
[4:05] stopped from reaching
[4:06] our locality
[4:10] but this
[4:11] did not make any sense no matter how
[4:15] perhaps they may have also been told the
[4:17] area is hard it didn't make any sense
[4:21] to your two sons brother caleb and tommy
[4:24] and the team that travel with
[4:27] them leave or die
[4:30] they had to reach
[4:32] even in dark
[4:33] they had to travel they wouldn't know
[4:35] where they were going but they were
[4:36] determined
[4:38] i truly see the spirit of caleb in caleb
[4:42] that great army in the days of joshua
[4:47] that little spirit that sparked and
[4:50] quieted
[4:52] all the negative testimonies
[4:56] that were rising against
[4:59] the promise
[5:01] truly brother caleb
[5:03] while i talked to dad
[5:06] i don't
[5:07] leave you in this regard
[5:10] i truly know that
[5:13] like we have always said
[5:14] this time ground
[5:17] you didn't just come because there is a
[5:19] feeling for africa but you came
[5:22] because god had already appointed
[5:26] you for this time
[5:30] brother thomas
[5:33] junior our dad
[5:35] i want to say this
[5:39] i don't know how long you're going to
[5:41] spend yet living with us
[5:44] but even if you go
[5:47] be assured that
[5:49] we love you
[5:50] we cherish you
[5:53] we feel like i told brother caleb
[5:57] i would be very glad to shake her hand
[5:59] with such a man of this
[6:01] kind
[6:04] i believe brother tommy brother caleb is
[6:07] a reflection of your own ministry
[6:11] the nature of the balance that they have
[6:13] always had
[6:14] men who don't draw
[6:17] walls around them
[6:19] they are not
[6:22] always for the doctrines that they
[6:24] uphold
[6:26] they don't help you because
[6:28] you are right with their own doctrine
[6:33] they want to build the unity
[6:37] in the face that we have regardless of
[6:40] factions and
[6:42] kinds of pool here and there
[6:46] i believe that was what our lord jesus
[6:48] christ was when he came in the land of
[6:50] israel
[6:52] it was not to pull punches with
[6:55] samaritans and the jews
[6:58] he was to unite them though he failed
[7:00] according to the prophecy
[7:03] they desired
[7:04] no unity at all
[7:07] but his attitude was to
[7:10] to make them be united
[7:13] same thing when brother branham came he
[7:15] would not
[7:16] have
[7:17] disregards to lose and the denominations
[7:20] he would always peruse through their
[7:22] ranks
[7:24] and would appear believe
[7:26] point people to christ
[7:29] and he made the statement that that was
[7:31] his
[7:33] very purpose
[7:34] was to make men have good standing and
[7:37] relationship with christ
[7:40] i'm sure everyone
[7:42] who is built
[7:44] in the like faith would think so
[7:47] i witnessed this in the ministry of
[7:49] brother toby and brother caleb
[7:53] something that
[7:55] keeps me warm
[7:56] keeps me
[7:59] always looking unto the end
[8:03] of god's program
[8:06] i failed to give
[8:08] my appreciation to you
[8:10] before you leave us
[8:13] any day that you will leave us
[8:16] my words
[8:18] will remain
[8:21] as
[8:23] an appreciation from our jolly land in
[8:26] which
[8:28] suda hills church of the cross have
[8:30] invested a lot of funds
[8:32] in different times in circumstances that
[8:35] they have never even thought they would
[8:36] be involved in
[8:39] they came in with the purpose of doing
[8:41] the translation but they have ended up
[8:43] doing quite more than those
[8:46] and they do willingly
[8:48] they have become part of us particularly
[8:51] me
[8:52] as brother barcelo pio
[8:56] i have become
[8:58] the very family
[9:00] of brother caleb and brother tommy
[9:03] in many ways they have done so
[9:06] when the crisis
[9:08] came
[9:10] the pandemic came in
[9:13] they had to send in a lot of help
[9:16] to help here and there
[9:19] surely like i told brother caleb
[9:22] this
[9:24] happened
[9:25] at the time when god had already given
[9:29] a way out
[9:31] and the way out here is
[9:34] you came in not that you really have a
[9:36] lot of fans
[9:37] you came in
[9:39] i told brother caleb
[9:41] because there was a crisis ahead of time
[9:44] and it would be very difficult you know
[9:46] our poor status
[9:49] we are poor material yes but
[9:51] god has given us
[9:53] the spiritual wealth
[9:56] and as long as we are in the body
[9:59] we do have a feeling when we are hungry
[10:02] when we are thirsty when we are naked
[10:05] when we are afflicted by diseases
[10:08] we still have the feeling that touch our
[10:10] physical bodies
[10:12] and someone would stand in to help us
[10:14] and clothe us and help us here and there
[10:17] would it be possible
[10:21] especially at this time
[10:23] that the world is shut
[10:26] things are not moving would it be
[10:27] possible for us to survive quite
[10:30] well though we don't have all that we
[10:33] want to have but they have done what is
[10:36] recommendable
[10:39] that a child god can do to a fellow
[10:41] brother and sister
[10:44] i want to say as i conclude
[10:47] your vision
[10:49] for africa
[10:52] a continent that was described by
[10:56] those who try to understand about it as
[10:59] a dark continent
[11:01] that continent according to them is that
[11:04] they didn't know much about it until
[11:06] explorers came
[11:09] and when they knew they found their
[11:11] people there
[11:14] and the people
[11:15] have black colors
[11:17] but they have the very soul the spirit
[11:21] and the blood
[11:22] that brother ram said we can transfuse
[11:25] our own blood and we still look alike
[11:28] many tried to put them to look like
[11:30] animals but brother branham refused it
[11:35] oh
[11:37] this is the place your heart has always
[11:40] been
[11:42] and
[11:43] finally
[11:46] your son had to come to accomplish
[11:50] with great love happiness joy
[11:53] and
[11:54] real re-yearning
[11:56] to see you
[11:58] i now send my voice to you and i say
[12:01] actually greets you
[12:04] we cherish
[12:06] every effort
[12:08] that you have always put
[12:11] through your sons and the members in
[12:12] your congregation
[12:15] to our land
[12:17] may
[12:19] you live long
[12:22] may you see
[12:23] the glory of the lord
[12:27] and to my brother caleb
[12:29] just been a great opportunity to meet
[12:32] you

[12:34] your dad

[12:38] may the hands of the lord never depart
[12:41] from you
[12:42] may he enlighten your heart
[12:45] may deal with you more than he has ever
