[21:34] I was asked to speak in front of you all
[21:36] today
[21:37] um
[21:41] and um
[21:43] Lord knows how much I like talking to
[21:45] people
[21:48] I'm a little shaky it's because I'm
[21:50] probably a little nervous but just
[21:54] work with me please
[21:58] all right now before I get into uh the
[22:01] details about this trip and uh how it
[22:03] personally uh I experienced it is
[22:10] I'm going to start us off with the
[22:12] scripture if you all good we stand yeah
[22:22] thank you
[22:26] and then you guys can say man if you
[22:28] haven't when this is
[22:31] so it reads yeah see he came unto his
[22:35] own
[22:36] and his own receipts
[22:46] now let's start off a couple days prior
[22:49] to this trip
[22:53] I remember when I was asked to go on
[22:55] this trip
[22:58] I was a bit nervous to give my answer
[23:01] yes or no
[23:05] if I'm being completely honest with you
[23:10] I thought to myself Joe you just moved
[23:13] here you opened said
[23:16] what makes you think that you're ready
[23:18] to go on such a big trip like this
[23:23] and that was just a reoccurring thought
[23:26] that happened for days in my head is
[23:32] so I took time and I prayed about it
[23:38] and I told myself Joe your pastor
[23:41] himself asks you if you would like to
[23:43] accompany them on this trip is
[23:49] I thought to myself the Lord wants to
[23:52] strengthen my faith
[23:56] he has opened doors that you've never
[23:59] would have thought would have been open
[24:04] and only the Lord knows how much I've
[24:07] told my parents
[24:12] how much I wanted to travel the world
[24:14] one day and see the beauty that God has
[24:17] created
[24:23] and little did I know that he was taking
[24:26] me to Jerusalem where my Lord and Savior
[24:28] Jesus
[24:35] now let's move on to take off
[24:41] I've only been on about three or four
[24:43] flights my whole life
[24:48] so I don't know much about what to do on
[24:51] a plane but I do know this
[24:56] aren't you supposed to sit down for the
[24:59] majority of the plane flights
[25:05] I have never heard about anybody
[25:07] standing up socializing while the plane
[25:09] is moving
[25:16] and honestly I was a bit confused I
[25:19] didn't really understand it India
[25:23] until I realized that everything that
[25:25] these men are doing they're doing for
[25:27] God
[25:32] like ours like our Pastor said um
[25:37] they stop whatever they are doing no
[25:39] matter where they are to go into prayer
[25:41] yes
[25:47] and I'm sitting there in a plane with
[25:49] about a handful of Americans
[25:54] the rescues and then some
[25:57] others so English at this point it was
[26:01] nowhere to be heard
[26:06] and I personally sat in the way back of
[26:10] the plane away from everybody
[26:15] however I did sit next to this young
[26:18] lady out in her mid-20s
[26:26] and yes she was Jewish so of course time
[26:29] went on in about the five hour mark we
[26:32] decided to introduce ourselves
[26:38] uh we began to talk about the Casual
[26:40] stuff you know like hi my name is Joe
[26:42] what's your name stuff like that
[26:48] and then the conversation kind of took a
[26:51] different direction
[26:53] conversations
[26:55] she asked me why are you going to
[26:57] Jerusalem who are you with
[27:01] so I told her who I was with and I began
[27:04] to explain my faith and our beliefs
[27:11] yes and I was I was I was going in I I
[27:15] started to say the name Jesus
[27:20] and she gave me this weird look she was
[27:23] almost a bit confused on why I was
[27:25] mentioning
[27:31] and she stopped me in my mid-sentence
[27:34] she said wait wait wait you think Jesus
[27:36] was the Messiah
[27:38] [Music]
[27:43] so of course I said yes too
[27:49] and she began to tell me that they
[27:51] believed that Jesus was just a man to
[27:54] them and
[28:01] John 1 11 came to me and I realized
[28:06] he came to his own
[28:09] and his own received him
[28:12] it was clear I I seen the bill that she
[28:15] had over her eyes
[28:19] so I I thought I was led to tell her
[28:23] about Moses and Elijah
[28:27] and I had mentioned the 144 000 Jews and
[28:30] I was going into depth about everything
[28:32] is
[28:37] and I could see her face start to light
[28:40] up
[28:44] with almost this hopeful feeling
[28:48] and I thought to myself
[28:52] maybe I'm speaking to one of those 144
[28:56] 000 Jews that would give their life to
[28:57] Jesus is
[29:04] so after a long flight we finally
[29:06] arrived this was
[29:09] and I'm sure the other brothers will
[29:11] talk about a few things that we did here
[29:13] and there and places we went
[29:17] in
[29:20] but I'm just going to focus on one thing
[29:23] and this is the garden
[29:27] and I believe I have a picture so you
[29:30] guys could see I don't know if they want
[29:32] to put it up here
[29:34] it's the first three pictures that I
[29:37] Monday
[29:42] so this is the garden tomb yes
[29:47] and let me tell you this place was
[29:49] something special
[29:53] the presence of the holy spirit that I
[29:56] felt La presents
[29:59] it was on fire in Fuego I remember
[30:04] before we went in recuerdo centrar the
[30:07] tour guide had told us
[30:10] before you guys came in this place was
[30:13] packed
[30:18] but you guys came at just the right
[30:22] momento perfecto it was pure Stillness
[30:26] it was beautiful
[30:29] all you can hear was the gust of winds
[30:32] moving in the trees and the birds
[30:33] chirping above you could ask
[30:38] and I was speaking with sister Ruth
[30:43] and she said Joe the Lord is speaking
[30:46] can you hear him
[30:51] she said come little bride I have
[30:54] something to show you
[30:57] and man when she said that
[31:00] the Waterworks just started flowing out
[31:03] of my eyes
[31:07] I truly believe he made a way for the
[31:09] bride that evening
[31:14] he wanted it quiet he needed to show us
[31:17] something
[31:21] and when it was our turn to enter
[31:22] history
[31:25] my aunt and my uncle Caleb actually
[31:28] entered first
[31:31] and as soon as they came out I heard her
[31:34] say
[31:36] I have good news he's not in here he is
[31:39] risen
[31:43] and as I went in
[31:45] I can
[31:48] confirmar Matthew 28 6 Mateo
[31:53] he's not here but he is risen as he said
[31:56] come see the place where the Lord
[32:04] and overall there's so much that I could
[32:06] talk about and go into detail about each
[32:09] and every site we've seen right
[32:15] each had their own filling each location
[32:18] moved you in a different way
[32:24] and in some areas where the other
[32:26] religions believe Jesus was buried or
[32:29] crucified
[32:36] you didn't really feel anything
[32:42] it really comes down to letting the holy
[32:45] spirit guide you and speak to you Mora
[32:54] and to be able to witness the amount of
[32:57] childlike love
[32:58] uh
[33:04] and what I mean by that is is the
[33:07] innocence and and the joy okay
[33:13] that my pastor brother Morton and fellow
[33:17] brothers and sisters had
[33:20] Mis Hermanos Hermanas it's it's
[33:22] Indescribable to try to describe it is
[33:27] it was like an instant Connection in
[33:30] some locations
[33:35] and because I can't really put it into
[33:37] words I have a few videos and pictures
[33:39] that I'd like to show you guys videos
[33:46] and uh I want to give all the glory to
[33:49] the Lord and I want to thank my uncle
[33:50] Caleb for giving me this opportunity
[33:57] I hope God blessed you guys with this
[34:01] pictures photos
[34:09] there we go
[34:28] and then on the I sent another set of
[34:32] videos of where
[34:34] um
[34:36] my uncle Caleb was actually racing
[34:38] brother Morton and that's kind of the
[34:40] child of love I was part of the video
[34:42] Sunday I don't know if you can see them
[34:49] and also greetings from the
[34:51] church out there yeah
[34:55] [Music]
[35:17] that's about it boys
[35:21] thank you brother Joe
[35:23] I can't
[35:25] remember
[35:26] go ahead buddy go ahead all right guys
[35:48] the last video that you've seen there
[35:52] can you put that back up there and just
[35:54] freeze it
[35:58] the one of them singing
[36:02] sorry not that one you can stop it but
[36:06] there was a they were singing the same
[36:08] song brother Joe in Cantonese
[36:12] and Grace just to give you a picture of
[36:15] how it is in Jerusalem but uh that is
[36:20] they were singing in the street okay
[36:24] not ashamed of the Gospel
[36:28] not ashamed to be singing of Jesus
[36:33] in a place that they didn't receive
[36:35] Jesus as the Messiah
[36:37] Jesus but as they began to sing in the
[36:41] street
[36:43] people began to come around them
[36:48] and they were so fascinated
[36:52] and they were listening they were taking
[36:55] pictures
[36:58] and to me Jerusalem is probably one of
[37:02] the most peaceful cities I've been in
[37:04] this world
[37:09] um you you think you're you're
[37:12] living in a Christian
[37:15] atmosphere
[37:20] you don't see a pair of pants walking
[37:22] down the street
[37:26] you may here and there but it you see
[37:29] nothing but long skirts
[37:34] totally different places
[37:37] you know so when we talk about this trip
[37:41] you know we
[37:44] we didn't go to find
[37:48] Christo you know we we accepted him as
[37:50] our savior a long time ago
[37:54] but I believe each one of us is at a
[37:57] different stage in our life
[38:02] reflect on this trip
[38:08] many things within me
[38:11] I believe I needed this trip
[38:16] you know because it's it's an eye-opener
[38:19] you know we started the trip on the
[38:22] plane and you you see all these Jews
[38:27] and the first thing that comes to your
[38:29] mind is
[38:31] that these people are don't listen to
[38:34] nobody
[38:37] these people are so indisciplined isn't
[38:40] it done in disciplinators you know and
[38:43] I'll try to be honest with you
[38:46] those are the thoughts that are coming
[38:48] to your mind
[38:50] but then as ours because this is a 10
[38:54] hour fight it's just um
[38:56] and you began to see dang these these
[39:00] guys are serious about what they do you
[39:02] know
[39:05] the flight attendant or actually the the
[39:09] pilots getting on on the microphone
[39:14] saying you guys gotta sit down
[39:18] that's got to put your seatbelts on
[39:21] and they do not care of anything that
[39:25] said
[39:27] they couldn't even
[39:29] deliver food to us
[39:32] can we give us our drinks
[39:34] but they were not ashamed of who they
[39:37] were
[39:39] so when you go to the scripture that he
[39:42] read
[39:44] he came to his own
[39:48] and his own received him
[39:51] you know I always just looked at the
[39:53] second part that's all I cared about yes
[39:57] which is verse 12 but as many as
[39:59] received him
[40:03] which is us
[40:05] you know but you see the type of people
[40:08] there's a reason why they act this way
[40:10] to me it means that people is
[40:16] I don't know if you remember when we're
[40:19] reading a panel was chapter 83 in the
[40:21] Book of Psalms
[40:26] you go all the way back in in as far
[40:30] into the Bible as you can
[40:34] and it tells you about verse of chapter
[40:37] 83.
[40:41] these people
[40:42] that they were God's people
[40:45] they were his people
[40:48] he gave them promise after promise
[40:52] but this whole world
[40:56] has been coming against them
[41:00] Time After Time thousands and thousands
[41:03] of years
[41:15] they believe that they're God's people
[41:18] so we as Christians when you see that
[41:23] that's why I had to stand up it lights a
[41:26] fire within you yes
[41:30] if they believe that
[41:33] how much more should we believe
[41:37] being God's elect right
[41:40] how much more should our lives reflect
[41:43] Christ
[41:47] you know they they they're waiting for a
[41:50] messiah to come
[41:52] because they were blinded
[41:56] to the Messiah coming
[42:01] but they're still his chosen people
[42:04] because God and does God get their
[42:08] prayers she deals receives I believe he
[42:12] he sure does your girl can see you know
[42:14] we one of the things that we we did when
[42:17] we're down there
[42:19] we had the pleasure to to go to the
[42:23] Wailing Walls
[42:28] I believe this is the only remains of of
[42:31] the original wall of the temple is
[42:38] they go
[42:40] and they prey on that wallet
[42:46] because they believe
[42:48] just like the word says they would go
[42:51] and they would face the temple
[42:56] I tell you when your hands touch that
[42:58] wall to prayer
[43:00] you talk about the presence of almighty
[43:03] God
[43:05] you know because they believe so much in
[43:07] God
[43:09] you know they believe the light that is
[43:11] given to them
[43:14] us as Believers when we touch that wall
[43:17] Church
[43:21] talking about an experience
[43:24] you know it was such an experience
[43:29] you know some some of the things that
[43:31] some of the things that that we see in
[43:33] there
[43:35] was not what
[43:37] what I expected
[43:40] you know many
[43:42] we've preached this gospel many times
[43:46] but when you can see with your plain
[43:49] eyes things that we've preached on
[43:51] things that we've heard
[43:55] you know when when we pulled up to to
[43:59] the Jordan River where John the Baptist
[44:02] baptized Jesus
[44:06] not what I expected
[44:09] I expected this beautiful place yes
[44:15] okay so see if you can freeze that right
[44:18] there so this is this is the Jordan
[44:20] River where they say that
[44:22] Jesus was baptized
[44:26] Jesus it's a muddy Little River right
[44:29] there is is it is 30.
[44:35] you see all those green trees
[44:38] that's just right there by the river
[44:42] you look across the river
[44:47] you look this way of the river
[44:50] you're in the middle of the desert
[44:53] you know and and you see like
[44:56] what was Jesus doing out there
[45:00] so then you can you try and you like the
[45:03] scriptures start to make sense
[45:07] he went into the desert
[45:10] you know and you you could see many
[45:13] times how he would take his disciples
[45:15] they would be in the middle of nowhere
[45:24] we went to mount Temptation I don't know
[45:26] if they have those when was
[45:28] the middle of the desert you know it
[45:32] says high high mountain in the middle of
[45:34] nowhere is it
[45:38] you see how high and that's a good
[45:40] picture right there because you could
[45:42] understand
[45:44] where he was tempted
[45:47] it was hot
[45:51] he had fasted for 40 days
[45:54] just to walk up there we're out of
[45:57] breath
[46:01] we are being babies that we're
[46:04] dehydrated
[46:06] we were so
[46:09] Miserables and then you go and you see
[46:12] you see Mira
[46:15] how he was tempted
[46:19] we're
[46:20] Miserables I could imagine how Jesus
[46:25] feltia Jesus you know so
[46:28] you see these you see many things that
[46:31] were
[46:31] were not what what we are our our minds
[46:35] would think that we're gonna see is
[46:42] but then we would go local iwamos to the
[46:46] Garland Gethsemane
[46:49] you know that that was
[46:51] that was probably the top three of the
[46:54] places that we went yeah you know we
[47:00] we're walking down the garden
[47:06] because when you when you look from the
[47:09] Eastern Gate
[47:14] this is like in the valley
[47:18] you're going to kind of look down where
[47:22] the Garland Gethsemane was that is
[47:27] and then it goes up to the top where
[47:29] Mount Olive's the Mount Olive is
[47:34] so in your head you could you go and you
[47:37] start imagining
[47:43] and he came to the garden
[47:47] and you could imagine
[47:49] the agony that he was in
[47:53] and to me the presence was
[47:56] was more than bearable when we were
[47:59] there
[48:03] and it's told right there there are
[48:06] olive trees
[48:08] everywhere you go in in
[48:11] Israel you see nothing but all of trees
[48:16] how old those are on the size of the
[48:19] trunks you steps
[48:25] you know but to me that the presence
[48:28] that that we experience there's
[48:31] something that you know you can't words
[48:34] words can't explain
[48:39] that still is in that place
[48:43] just like anything else everything's
[48:46] commercialized
[48:49] every place that they knew something
[48:52] happened with Jesus or or where Jesus
[48:55] was something took place
[49:00] they established some type of church
[49:02] there yes
[49:06] but that still didn't take the presence
[49:09] that was that was there
[49:13] you know and then I know our pastor
[49:15] talked about the eastern the Eastern
[49:18] Gate
[49:20] you know but as we were standing on the
[49:23] Eastern Gate
[49:26] and our pastor began to play a couple of
[49:29] messages that brother Branham was was
[49:32] talking about on
[49:33] about the Eastern Gate
[49:40] you know and and the presence of God was
[49:43] was um
[49:46] you know I don't know how how to how to
[49:49] explain it
[49:52] you know probably because he had
[49:55] preached the message to us
[49:59] you know on how that Eastern Gate was
[50:02] sealed up come on
[50:05] but just to see it in
[50:09] Persona you know what and as the voice
[50:11] of of our Prophet was was uttered there
[50:15] is
[50:18] you know how how he he was he was crying
[50:21] out
[50:23] yeah I will meet you okay
[50:26] and I believe that he's going to meet us
[50:28] in the morning there
[50:30] in the Eastern Gate
[50:33] you know you know those you know the
[50:36] experience for me no experience you know
[50:39] it it made me really
[50:42] check my life
[50:47] to make sure
[50:49] am I really giving God every
[50:52] thing that I should be giving him
[51:00] God gave us an opportunity to go to
[51:03] Jerusalem
[51:06] and you you think on how these Jews
[51:10] dedicate their lives completely to him
[51:16] you know and then you hear you hear the
[51:19] prophet says
[51:23] have I done all that he's called me to
[51:24] do
[51:27] you know it makes it makes this this the
[51:31] Bible it makes it not just a history
[51:33] lesson
[51:38] but it makes it something to life to us
[51:43] you know I I believe you know I wasn't
[51:46] like Joe you're okay
[51:48] I wasn't invited but I said I'm going
[51:52] with the pastor
[51:55] I invited myself
[51:59] so you know
[52:01] I think they scrapped my pictures that I
[52:03] had up there yeah
[52:06] because the pictures that I had up there
[52:09] were
[52:10] all the faces Grace was making on this
[52:13] trip
[52:16] everybody's that was sleeping we got
[52:18] some good photos I guess those questions
[52:26] but you know this trip was sure was
[52:29] was a blessing to me and my wife and yes
[52:34] to experience it with with these these
[52:38] three youth that went with us was
[52:43] very very proud
[52:46] very proud of them
[52:48] you know seeing that you know and and
[52:51] it's
[52:52] it's who you go with it depending on Ken
[52:55] bus you know we
[52:58] we went with our brothers you know
[53:00] Martin brother Marcus and their families
[53:04] you know we we sure had a we sure had a
[53:07] blast and you know
[53:10] you know I believe our pastor needed a
[53:13] you know this more than anything
[53:17] I believe he he was totally
[53:21] you know in
[53:23] in relaxed mode
[53:27] you know but one of the one of the
[53:30] things as I turned over to Brother
[53:31] Carlos one of the things
[53:35] that just breaks your heart
[53:38] because when we went to the church in
[53:40] Jerusalem
[53:41] you know as the pastor was he was
[53:43] talking to brother Caleb Memphis
[53:47] you know and he told how he had no
[53:51] Fellowship
[53:54] but we don't realize
[53:57] you know we're
[53:59] where they're like the foreigners there
[54:01] in a place that that's full of Jews
[54:07] they can't have a church service freely
[54:10] and have meetings like we can Services
[54:15] it's almost like they're under
[54:17] persecution they get it's a hard time
[54:24] and your heart goes out to to a church
[54:27] like that is
[54:30] because we could come here and worship
[54:33] freely
[54:36] and many times we take advantage this is
[54:40] you know take advantage of just being
[54:43] able to come to church services
[54:48] you know but I truly was
[54:52] truly was blessed our time brother Joe
[54:54] yeah you started
[54:56] I said you know on this trip you go to
[55:00] many places
[55:03] but you know when you're sitting in
[55:06] front of the Wailing Wall
[55:10] you're sitting in front of the Eastern
[55:12] Gate it's just
[55:17] we have the best conversations
[55:23] that we've had in a long time
[55:28] and it wasn't with each other
[55:31] [Music]
[55:33] that is with God talking
[55:36] you know those
[55:38] you know when you're you're in silence
[55:40] you're you're at that Eastern Gate
[55:46] and you could God begins to talk to you
[55:50] in those comments
[55:51] then you appreciate it
[55:54] you can say I appreciate you Pastor
[56:00] about how they sell that Eastern Gate
[56:05] and how that Moses and Elijah would come
[56:10] and those Jews you you could see how how
[56:15] stubborn they are used yeah
[56:20] and how that they'll kill Moses and
[56:22] Elijah
[56:24] but then when they resurrect
[56:29] that's going to be a that's going to be
[56:31] a finale day
[56:34] because the same message that we have
[56:37] heard
[56:39] I believe with all my heart those Jews
[56:42] will here
[56:44] but I'm going through your mind while
[56:46] you're you're in Israel you're hearing
[56:48] the message in your head you're like
[56:53] you're all this is real
[56:55] everything we've heard all our lives
[56:58] this is the real thing
[57:01] you know and then when you feel the
[57:03] presence of God
[57:05] then you can raise your hand your head
[57:08] up
[57:09] and then you can say I'm a Child of God
[57:12] you see how highly God has favored us
[57:23] that
[57:26] there would be hope for us
[57:29] because if he wouldn't have blinded them
[57:32] there would have been no hope for us
[57:36] and that's why we live today that's why
[57:39] we serve him
[57:41] but you know it was an experience I know
[57:44] Brother Carlos is going to come up here
[57:45] foreign
[57:55] thank you brother Ben this is my Round
[57:57] of Applause
[58:02] yeah I like like the guys have said I
[58:05] mean it's it's something that I believe
[58:07] that
[58:09] I believe that every believer should do
[58:11] in their life and and I never could
[58:13] understand how they're there was people
[58:16] that would go back four and five and six
[58:18] times
[58:27] yeah and and so uh you know you we went
[58:31] we went I think we were there eight or
[58:33] nine days
[58:35] and we went hard like sun up the sun
[58:39] down we went to everything we could get
[58:42] to is
[58:46] and I think we hit maybe 30 of the stuff
[58:49] that that there is to to to see and and
[58:51] experience and and go through and all
[58:53] that stuff
[58:58] yeah it's vast it's it's it's just so uh
[59:04] it's 66 books of the Bible in in one
[59:06] place
[59:08] any other any other way it's it's a
[59:10] synthesis
[59:14] it it
[59:16] takes the Bible
[59:19] and it brings it to a level
[59:23] that you cannot comprehend unless you go
[59:27] there
[59:30] God's word becomes alive in a way
[59:36] that is Indescribable
[59:40] I can show you pictures I can tell you
[59:43] about it
[59:46] but to understand what God did in that
[59:49] place
[59:52] and to see it firsthand is is
[59:57] I I can't even I can't there's no words
[1:00:01] so we're gonna start off with this slide
[1:00:06] and I love you very much sister Lorraine
[1:00:07] and sister Grace and
[1:00:09] spirits but they are modeling the latest
[1:00:15] in in Muslim fashion
[1:00:20] this is at the temple Mountain
[1:00:24] which is completely controlled by the
[1:00:27] Muslims
[1:00:30] and the ladies have to cover from head
[1:00:33] to toe
[1:00:35] um
[1:00:38] I don't know Lorraine was about 95
[1:00:41] degrees that day
[1:00:44] it's about 95 degrees and and it's like
[1:00:48] the middle of the day
[1:00:51] and those things are like like thick
[1:00:53] burlap heavy things
[1:00:58] so all we heard was okay everybody hurry
[1:01:01] up we're gonna go through this part
[1:01:02] really really fast
[1:01:07] oh so we went through this area kind of
[1:01:10] quick um
[1:01:13] so and that you can skip that slide and
[1:01:15] go to the next slide
[1:01:17] and I'm hoping uh that some of this is
[1:01:20] is will play as a video so guys I don't
[1:01:22] know if you can try to play that video
[1:01:30] I can
[1:01:34] maybe maybe not
[1:01:37] anyway
[1:01:38] um so this was it at Nazareth when we
[1:01:41] were at Nazareth
[1:01:44] are our guide this lady here
[1:01:47] um
[1:01:48] that lady right there was she was
[1:01:50] amazing because she was
[1:01:52] she was going through each thing as we
[1:01:55] were experiencing Nazareth in
[1:01:59] Eva's Nazareth is Tiny
[1:02:02] it was a city of like 300 people
[1:02:06] it's about the size of a good sized dirt
[1:02:09] lot I mean it's not it's not real big
[1:02:11] but the Tierra
[1:02:13] Grande but this is the this is is is is
[1:02:16] kind of a model of of where Jesus was
[1:02:19] was was teaching
[1:02:23] Jesus and she's showing how that Jesus
[1:02:26] had gone into the the temple there
[1:02:29] Jesus
[1:02:32] and he had picked up the scroll yeah
[1:02:36] and he read
[1:02:39] and he said this day
[1:02:41] this scripture is fulfilled is
[1:02:44] completed and when she read that and
[1:02:47] when she said that
[1:02:49] holy cow
[1:02:51] like it was it it brought that portion
[1:02:54] of scripture
[1:02:56] to to to life
[1:02:59] and you can imagine Jesus Christ
[1:03:02] standing right there
[1:03:08] and reading that
[1:03:11] and the crazy part was
[1:03:16] it meant nothing to nobody in that room
[1:03:18] no significance
[1:03:21] and and to me that was one of the things
[1:03:23] that
[1:03:24] was so incredible
[1:03:29] is we went to the Eastern Gate
[1:03:32] oriente and we had
[1:03:35] the most incredible experience with the
[1:03:37] Lord there Louis experience
[1:03:41] and we were the only ones
[1:03:45] to this day is
[1:03:48] the blindness
[1:03:50] doesn't just cover the Jews
[1:03:54] it covers all of the denominations
[1:03:59] because we were the only ones
[1:04:02] with the prophet
[1:04:05] that told us what would happen at that
[1:04:07] Eastern Gate
[1:04:10] and taught us what the significance of
[1:04:13] that Eastern Gate meant is
[1:04:16] there was not another Soul around
[1:04:21] but if you went to the Church of the
[1:04:23] Holy sepulchers
[1:04:28] thousands of people were there
[1:04:42] inside the city walls tens of thousands
[1:04:45] of people going around hustling bustling
[1:04:47] doing their things
[1:04:49] [Music]
[1:04:52] crying at different little churches that
[1:04:54] were around the way
[1:04:58] robbing the rock where they say that
[1:05:00] Golgotha was inside the Church of the
[1:05:02] Holy Sepulcher uh
[1:05:17] nobody Nadia
[1:05:19] so that was that to me was incredible I
[1:05:22] think they got it to work
[1:05:23] scriptures
[1:05:28] [Music]
[1:05:34] [Music]
[1:05:38] until a little later after Jesus started
[1:05:40] preaching and telling them some stories
[1:05:42] something happened and it went so amazed
[1:05:45] anymore
[1:05:45] and so um what did he say you might
[1:05:49] wonder so we have to go back a little
[1:05:52] bit to see historical background of
[1:05:55] where he was so he was in Nazareth
[1:05:57] Nazareth was a Jewish City or about
[1:06:00] maybe 300 people
[1:06:03] look so small
[1:06:06] um and so Israel had been ruled over by
[1:06:10] Foreign Foreigners for years and he had
[1:06:12] hundreds of years and right now the
[1:06:14] world and Romans and life was hard taxis
[1:06:19] were high and it was just they were
[1:06:22] waiting for messiah to come and to set
[1:06:24] them free to chase out the foreigners
[1:06:26] and everything would be happy and happy
[1:06:29] ending and there was Jesus he said meet
[1:06:32] the Messiah and they started telling
[1:06:34] them the stories about Naaman
[1:06:38] and
[1:06:40] about the Widow who didn't have any food
[1:06:44] and God helped her but it's my story now
[1:06:47] well actually
[1:06:49] the the stories he picked well
[1:06:52] foreigners that's right
[1:06:54] and people didn't like that what do you
[1:06:57] mean you're the Messiah and you came for
[1:06:59] the foreigners the ones who are
[1:07:01] oppressing us surely this cannot be
[1:07:04] right that must be a false prophet
[1:07:06] and they decided that they're going to
[1:07:08] kick him out and throw him off the cliff
[1:07:10] and so they actually took him out of the
[1:07:13] synagogue ready to throw him off and
[1:07:15] Tyler says Jesus just walk through
[1:07:17] between them and let's left Nazareth and
[1:07:20] he never returned here again he lived in
[1:07:23] I don't know how many of you guys caught
[1:07:25] that um
[1:07:27] but basically what she said was
[1:07:30] Jesus was saying really awesome things
[1:07:32] in that in that synagogue
[1:07:37] until he started kind of getting into
[1:07:39] more doctrinal points
[1:07:43] and because all of his examples that he
[1:07:45] was using
[1:07:48] we're all Gentiles and foreigners
[1:07:52] and the minute that he started talking
[1:07:54] about those people
[1:07:57] they said there's no way this could be
[1:07:59] the Messiah
[1:08:01] because it was only supposed to come to
[1:08:04] the Jews
[1:08:06] and they kicked him out of the synagogue
[1:08:09] so we when you hear things like that it
[1:08:13] blows your mind is
[1:08:17] uh so so uh next next slide is is this
[1:08:22] is Brother Morton is a
[1:08:24] I I love brother Morton that that man is
[1:08:27] he is so much fun he's amazing but he
[1:08:31] set us up he totally set us up from the
[1:08:33] get-go principle
[1:08:36] right
[1:08:38] so he told us okay I'm gonna take you
[1:08:40] guys to where they say that Jesus was
[1:08:43] crucified and buried
[1:08:47] and then I'm going to take you to where
[1:08:50] he actually was crucified
[1:08:55] and this is where they say yes
[1:08:59] please call the Church of the Holy
[1:09:01] Sepulcher is
[1:09:05] and then like like Ben said
[1:09:09] every place that they consider a holy
[1:09:11] spot or something where Jesus did
[1:09:13] something
[1:09:19] built church and edification Iglesia at
[1:09:22] a little church
[1:09:23] really really big church
[1:09:26] and there's gold everywhere and it's
[1:09:28] ornate and it's all this wow just
[1:09:31] amazing wild you know oh wow it's
[1:09:33] amazing
[1:09:37] and the place where
[1:09:40] you know that Jesus was buried
[1:09:43] Jesus and the place where you know that
[1:09:47] Jesus was crucified
[1:09:51] they built a bus station
[1:09:53] foreign
[1:10:06] next slide
[1:10:09] this is in Jericho when we went to
[1:10:12] Jericho he is
[1:10:15] Jericho's one of the ugliest places I've
[1:10:17] ever seen
[1:10:21] and I'm sure at some point
[1:10:24] it might have been a really pretty place
[1:10:27] but by the time I got there
[1:10:33] it was really really ugly boys
[1:10:35] so we get on this tram and and we're
[1:10:38] because the the mount temptation is
[1:10:40] there outside of Jericho
[1:10:43] and you can start kind of climbing up
[1:10:47] and that's the old walls that's the base
[1:10:50] of the old walls of Jericho right there
[1:10:51] yes
[1:10:54] that Joshua brought down
[1:10:56] so that was pretty that was pretty
[1:10:58] awesome next slide when we have some
[1:11:00] Bros uh oh
[1:11:03] um okay so this is the Al-Aqsa mosque
[1:11:08] and so this is one side of the Temple
[1:11:11] Mount is
[1:11:12] [Music]
[1:11:14] then on the other side of the Dome of
[1:11:16] the Rock
[1:11:20] and this is where they say that Muhammad
[1:11:24] was was
[1:11:26] transported to from Mecca
[1:11:30] and this
[1:11:32] is where he supposedly LED Jesus and
[1:11:36] Abraham and Moses
[1:11:40] in prayer
[1:11:41] and then he crossed the courtyard to the
[1:11:44] Dome of the
[1:11:47] rocks
[1:11:49] and that's where the that's where the
[1:11:52] Muslims believed that he was transported
[1:11:53] up you have an experience with God
[1:11:59] and that's so that's the significance of
[1:12:02] the two mosques that are inside the
[1:12:03] Temple mount
[1:12:06] but it's that Dome of the Rock what do I
[1:12:09] say is
[1:12:11] that that really you get there
[1:12:15] and that's the Abomination
[1:12:18] that's the one that sits on the holy of

[1:23:08] in in Israel in Israel Israel is like
[1:23:11] this Israelis I see it's just Hills and
[1:23:14] Valleys Hills and Valleys Hills

[1:23:18] you find stairs there
[1:23:20] right across from the Wailing Wall
[1:23:24] they call it the Wailing stairs

[1:23:35] straight to climb out of that area you
[1:23:44] they build these Terraces
[1:23:48] and they pack the dirt behind the rock
[1:23:50] behind the rocks on the little Terrace
[1:23:52] and have a place to farm
[1:23:56] and when you realize that as Jesus
[1:23:59] walked this little path right here
[1:24:06] Israel is completely
[1:24:17] so in this path you'll find little
[1:24:20] pockets of dirt in this uh
[1:24:24] [Music]
[1:24:25] and and when the the farmers would would
[1:24:29] plant their little their little Terraces
[1:24:32] right here
[1:24:37] they would throw the seed
[1:24:41] and some of that seed would fall on good
[1:24:43] ground
[1:24:47] and some of that seed would fall on the
[1:24:49] rocks
[1:24:51] and some of that seed would fall in the
[1:24:54] little pockets over here and spring up
[1:24:58] and from this right here
[1:25:02] came Matthew 13 the parable of the sower
[1:25:08] from this
[1:25:11] from Jesus Christ walking up and down
[1:25:14] this path
[1:25:16] he extracted the parable of the sower
[1:25:22] and and changed so many lives with that
