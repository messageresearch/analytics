Casey lokah samasta here still seems big today toy yes I mean a grand ahoy then we haven't done much today it doesn't know Messiah was Dante OE so what I'm getting at it is that we are looking for greater things until we reach the coming of the Lord that is our goal that is what we press towards amen he said mister damn it I said mister can read and that's what Paul would say forgetting those things which are behind so many here addressed want to forget those things that that may be things that that may be that that we're not so proud of last year what does keynote addresses Casa de las

of his message is that he is that the Lord has given him he's a man would you stand in your feet now as as we read the scripture this morning he's upon the people there let's get to desta mañana and this would be rapturing condition number five at this area condition the Raptor numeral sing with the subtitle the supernatural materializing kanoon cannot connect Ahmad a loss or a natural material

that makes it easy for you to understand this morning you know trailers in more case they're fast asleep an extreme faith is the ability its Lobby lead on to materialize the spoken word but I'm not

there until a pencil mean he wanted to become material it can yes there's the material and what did he do because the case then he spoke a word of Lola Falana and the world was materialized allowed as a materialist and that's the whole picture yes the story from Genesis to Revelation in Genesis that rebelliously on is nothing wrong it's Elohim Elohim materializing what they really said oh he can be touched so he can be felt para que puedo calorie sentido how many got that this morning but to look up that he was before he was God he was a lower here scared yo said I know him but he wanted to materialize a materialist I saw that he could be touched so he could feel myself I'll follow and because you know him materialize vertical Elohim same material is very he became the supernatural God

competiveness or being above or beyond what is natural tester sobre o Messiah Lucas natural unexplainable by natural law inexplicably portal a natural a phenomena phenomena abnormal of normally something attributed to God I'll go three wheelers how many know that that the Bible that we read is a supernatural book but the son Kaylee many people is a physical book that you can pick up but you're not a believer we know that it is a supernatural book a final contestant liberal story because by believing what's written there Kippur career locust ie it will produce the supernatural we all I believe that we're here because we have seen that in our lives so estamos aquí lo hemos visto husband and because when when we believe it cuando la coneja more then it produces supernatural result you see this will tell so tonight and whenever the supernatural is done Nikolas or an attractive man what happens they okay but there's always a mixed multitude later I'm going to mix that goes with

mixed up you get pretty nervous you get make believers my no you get unbelievers right those that are just along for the ride see what they can get out of it are there key points that the amen that's what we see is dokodemo and throughout history yet there is delays there has always been a people that have believed the supernatural I mean look at race or lost or in that other people said no we

not reason with the word but they believe God no matter what can endure no important people that God has placed gifts in there's a quest of honesty and they have become the gift to their generation you gotta say that don't know so he an arrestee no no I wanna as we get this message going meet there's the exponent mo system in second I told them leave the clock up they can stare because I'm going through all these pages today but I support their penis toy who cares what the clock has to say but watch now as we see him unfolding because the composite as a villain throughout the scripture we find people that that supernatural events happen to prevent us can be passed on a spirit and not just through them but through them para prophecy here comes a woman that we all know very well the Lucky seven he is known as the queen of the south or the Queen of Sheba was como la reina del Cielo she had heard something she had heard that there was a man a king that that had a gift of discernment al you know didn't break it any other sternum in and so she one day she decides I'm gonna go and I'm gonna see this king you know yesterday and the first thing is she I can just see her as she is there in the palace you pull away like under your reign she finally sees this king walk in you know go bacon raintree intra and as she looks at him I mean the scale of a she's studying him up

just church-going people I said come on mundo knows me ridiculous yeah she said I'm going to see and this is tremendous tremendo I'm going to see where that God is because now once again brother Bram says she is looking at at this man they say Monroe brand it was a yellow star Mira and austere man no my sister no he said but but I'm going to see where that God is I want to see if I can recognize where he's at you know seven because this is just a man porque no mas the namibian he goes on he says I see there's a man is you okay you know buddy but I I want to know where are your kiddos now there's where that supernatural God is does this test is your soul in the Torah so she watched the man it does it to be here alone man this is brother Branham and the message Queen of Sheba you gotta get this to know where we're going today once again I want to know where that supernatural God is give us a real don't discuss your story at today so she watched the man the healer lumbering I'm gonna say it again because you gotta get this is a warning well let icy low I want to know where that supernatural God is this is your story nobody watched the man be he drew hombre what a revelation kid River let's see what most people would say I want to know where that supernatural God is am I looking up to the heavens you mean honest yes yellow we're trying to see something that that's out of the ordinary I look at stuff we're not this little radio veteran dress that brother BAM says so she watched that man it was he lost him bro yes yep he walks like a man they say come inna come on throw him break he talks like a man I would like a moon hombre he looks like a man and Mia come on hombre he's a man it's been humbling but she's still searching Lando he does all these think he is a man hey listen hombre mmm-hmm yeah you look like a man let me know I'm talking like a man I would like come on hombre you you're a man it's okay so she's looking at the King and saying yeah he's a man that mean unless the real ACC so nombre and then I can see maybe her thinking you know when Pierce up in China I didn't come all this way to see a man no he needed Italian I must arrest nombre but now say para all of a sudden they repent they something happens that she sees something more than a man we walk on this angle K via Moscow numbering the super lost ovary come on now Church the super the Soviet had come in contact with the natural contact Okolona Koran and the supernatural began to happen Natali del Conte Sara and all of a sudden is a reputable gift is activated its active other and what she hears okay oh yeah is not something that a man would know nurse that book you number he must have it what that man begins to tell her Delambre lip yes I they see you nobody knew what was in her heart nothing severe Lucas tonic quite a small gift began to come for me besides what it produced was a something supernatural look at the roof of and go soda and I she heard it hello Joe he said Wow Wow oh this is something that is not natural okay no is this is something that is supernatural look it's over in it where is it coming from they don't envy any and when this man stood there brother Brown says the spirit of discernment come upon him all of them began to tell her her secrets Salamone Priscilla so second God just poured it down upon Solomon told her every secret that she wanted to know there you go the toaster kept okay okay I saw something that was supernatural yeah me don't get out go soda he saw something real you know algerie and she saw a paradox you don't paradox that what is a paradox a something that is incredible but it's true I'm focusing clip it over there that one a person today cuando not person I always find the real way in control or it has an effect on them didn't even affect whether they want to admit or not it has an effect on them look in the mirror lo lo tiene I wonder by themselves cuando yes I asked although they began to think or ponder about these things yes I'm is a pencil Minotaur there's no denying it when you do see the supernatural no I come on a girl rockin the well sorta network what will you take God at His Word para tomar este año since people are will you reason it away the world is full of people that reason it away I something happens it could've been that there was something else no no we can't prove it so then it's nuts it's not real no plane was provided there there has to be a reason behind it Teaneck not rest on the trances let me tell you something take him is that when God begins to show himself and don't you some case that most artists there's a short space of time I ain't import Otis but that a person has to either accept it kill a person aloha septa and believe it he cried long before the mind takes over at this gala meant a cell or had reasons either way on that little space a time a window of opportunity you know how many here have ever taken God at His Word but this again tomorrow sisupala and not even permitted your mind to reason with it in other helices lamenting here I believe that we all at one point or another can say that and we hear the word he was up eleven when we do we have we have that window of opportunity what therefore system in either I believe it to be God's Word this is Lucas that if I do it will produce the supernatural populace or dinner or I can reason it away errotica Suraiya and be left with nothing he cannot see another now I think we all have have gone through that o Samos pasado pray I was talking with brother ends or the other day hablar con le mano and so uh it's concerning I was I was telling him about how not to think talk ante come on opens that it sounds like a strange idea he said what has anybody here ever mastered the art of not thinking I'm not my struggle are today nobody let me see anybody I'll get III the Lord has been dealing with this with me for some time and economy go there and that's what he told me yes to look at how not to think come on open that and I and I and I and I hear that your ego and I'm dealing with that easy there your cornice and then once again the art of how not to think come on okay because you go through this the the book stores bile at the end I much of the end everything was it was how to change your mentality let's go look up again how do you think this way oh like a million or a billionaire oh it's a power you're not is almost a how did you think this way things like a wealthy man or a person una persona Rica but never do you find in the in the in the bookstores no kind really the art of not thinking who think when Tom Lehrer PSLRA come on open sorry and as the Holy Spirit began to deal with me on this I was telling this to the brother this yeah you're a little man and I said I bring it up for this reason that a stone is it possible to keep your mind clear elemental not add your own thoughts to what God have already said in Edina look at your jealousy whoever we hear his word condo emo SuperLab no believe it period we don't have to reason but then it was can we don't have to try to figure it out we don't have to see well when is he gonna happen though I put this we don't have to think at all nothing it was gifting in our soul we have to just believe it is already done okay yes there's nothing for me to think about there's nothing for me to say well well this is what I think we're not your questions that's why the people are in the condition but it was killa hint this time because everybody has an idea of what they see but okay means we don't need everybody's idea I'm not busy waiting on the brother Caleb's idea honey definitely that and we simply need the mind of Christ to be present in our members me I don't believe and know that we can we can achieve you care it's a very big part of not thinking elected an open Saturn now I don't know if you believe me or not but that's what the Holy Spirit has been dealing know she systemic repairs I don't need you to think about it what this is he took it be Amadeus for you to accept it and believe it don't step because hey what can say is not something you can explain yes I look at where split good day this what will materialize in a world at the same token the la misma reasoning la misma signora stone are we will keep the supernatural from unfolding comment in there there's some Wilma

be like brother Marc get a second well Amanda Marc I do see he's awesome unless tremendo he's probably looking at me saying what are you talking about he's a minister blast he tells me he gets up he
