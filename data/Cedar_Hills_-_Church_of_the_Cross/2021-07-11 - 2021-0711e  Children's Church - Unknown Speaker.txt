b-i-b-i-e yes that's the book for me i stand up oh that's the way that that's the intestine can you guys hear me now [Music] now oh man you're happy to be here hope everybody's doing well this afternoon first of all i would like to thank the lord for giving me my life and for the pastor of letting me of him having the confidence so i can preach now how many enjoyed the service this morning well i was at sunday school but i've heard about it and i'm pretty sure everybody was blessed you can please turn your bibles open your bibles to luke 8 5. a sower went out to sow his seed and as he sowed some fell upon his wayside and it treaded down the fowls of the air and devoured it some fell upon a rock and as soon as it sprung up it withered away because it lacked moisture and some fell among thorns and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it and others fell on the good ground and sprang up and bare fruits and hundreds full and when he said these things he cried he that has ears let them hear we're gonna jump to number 11. now the parable is the seed is the word of god you may be seated now this afternoon i would like to talk about the sea and the title of my message is the seed that got planted in my heart now i'm sure you guys have heard many stories about seeds like jack and the beanstalk the good and the bad seed even the bible talks about the seed called the mustard seed which is the smallest seeds of them all now this seed is so powerful that it has everything you need but before i tell you that let me tell you a little something that happened to me one day i planted a seed of a plum tree i dug a hole the seed in butter in it and water it and i waited and guess what was happening nothing i waited months and months and months and guess what was happening nothing until one day i was playing my backyard and this itty-bitty bitty green stem pop out from the ground and i said oh what a funny-looking weed until that funny-looking weed soon started to grow branches and leaves and fruits until one and and i thank god for my mother that watered it because i only watered it once but i was expecting big fruits and i stayed without taking care of that seed now that we know that this seed is the word of god what are we going to do with it shall we receive it and throw it away sure should we plant it and never water it or should we treasure it in our hearts and take good care of it i think that the last option is the best because again brother brown said that it is equipped with everything you need for example are you having a bad day at school what does the seed say i can do all things in christ that strengthens me are you sick what does a seat say by his stripes we are healed are you feeling lonely what does the seat say fear not where i am with you don't be dismayed for i am your god how could we let this beautiful seed die if we don't water it of course it'll die but how can we water it but i thank god for the prophet of this eighth that he left instructions on us of how to take care of god now let's see what brother branham says in the message god revealing himself to the people he says the word is a seed that the sower sowed in the ground and every seed will bring forth its own kind if you need a salvation the seeds here if you need healing use the seed of the word and the word of god is a seed put it in your heart don't dig it up every morning and see if it's sprouted put it there and leave it because it's god's business to bring forth the harvest you just leave it there water by faith and praise god every day thanking god for it now don't only water it once a week when we come to church let's water it every day to see how big it'll grow it's a play it's okay to play video games or watch tv or do your favorite activity but we can find that time during the day where you can find where you can play where you can find yourself in prayer and read your bible and that's how the seed will grow to be at the perfect statue of the man god bless you hallelujah good to see you all once again how's everybody doing it's been a long time since i've seen you guys i'm sure i'm glad to be back well today we're going to do
