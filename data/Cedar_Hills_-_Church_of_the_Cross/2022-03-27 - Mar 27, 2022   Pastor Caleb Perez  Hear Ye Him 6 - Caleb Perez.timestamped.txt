[55:30] is
[55:36] and behold there appeared unto them
[55:38] moses and elias talking with him

[56:13] voice out of the cloud which said this
[56:16] is my beloved son in whom i am well
[56:19] pleased hear ye
[56:24] lost
[56:31] amen revelation is the fourth chapter

[57:49] that it would find a good ground lord
[57:52] when when

[58:13] we find that that these scriptures are
[58:15] rehearsals
[58:18] they are previews
[58:22] as we all said we like previews
[58:27] we get anxious sometimes
[58:30] sometimes we want to see it right away
[58:33] anybody ever happened to yeah i can't
[58:35] wait till that one comes out
[58:39] like they say usually the the the
[58:43] anxiousness
[58:46] is usually greater than the actual
[58:48] viewing of

[59:05] in matthew the 17th chapter
[59:11] tremendous rehearsal
[59:13] it's a preview
[59:16] of what was coming
[59:18] then we see that john what a blessed
[59:21] disciple he he was
[59:26] because he kind of gets a double fold of
[59:29] it right
[59:44] then later on in his life
[59:46] he ends up being thrown into uh
[59:50] put on the isle of patmos
[59:54] and then he gets to continue watching
[59:56] and seeing this how it's going to unfold
[59:58] all the way
[1:00:07] but now he gets to see all the seven
[1:00:09] church ages and how it goes all the way
[1:00:11] to the end
[1:00:32] so then the bride must be
[1:00:34] a very special person
[1:00:39] why
[1:00:40] because she is
[1:00:42] is beloved
[1:00:44] so
[1:00:45] how many of your type is was john typing
[1:00:50] i i i say he was talking he was typing
[1:00:52] me
[1:01:10] why is the lord having me preach this
[1:01:12] message at this time
[1:01:16] because many times there are still
[1:01:18] people that that doubt
[1:01:21] they doubt their
[1:01:36] i mean i want to be part of it
[1:01:38] i want to do my part
[1:01:41] i don't know i got too many problems too
[1:01:42] many issues i i don't know if i'm if i'm
[1:01:44] a part of it or not
[1:01:48] so when you see a preview or a trailer
[1:01:53] the the first thing that you want to
[1:01:55] know is what
[1:01:58] you're going to talk back to me today
[1:02:03] upcoming attractions and
[1:02:05] what's the first thing that you ask when
[1:02:07] you when you see that
[1:02:13] the title okay
[1:02:15] what else
[1:02:17] ah that's right uh maina who's in it
[1:02:21] yeah that'll determine a lot of times
[1:02:23] whether
[1:02:24] we're gonna watch it or not
[1:02:27] no i don't like that that actor
[1:02:30] i'm not gonna see that one
[1:02:46] oh i kind of like them maybe i will see
[1:02:49] it
[1:02:51] and ultimately
[1:02:52] what is the movie about
[1:02:55] it
[1:02:56] i mean what i mean is it worth i mean
[1:02:59] storyline that's a good one
[1:03:03] and and so when we finally get to see
[1:03:06] this drama or the movie or the play or
[1:03:08] whatever it is
[1:03:12] there's one thing that is always
[1:03:14] certain
[1:03:17] you know what that is
[1:03:19] there's one thing i'm going to say again
[1:03:21] that is always
[1:03:22] certain
[1:03:28] well that's certain too
[1:03:30] that that's a good answer right rotten
[1:03:33] tomatoes are good tomatoes
[1:03:37] oh i gotta add that one to the list
[1:03:39] critic there is always guys gotta go
[1:03:41] through the hall of critics
[1:03:55] that the characters that you saw in the
[1:03:57] trailer or the preview
[1:04:02] are the exact characters that are in the
[1:04:04] movies
[1:04:07] does not
[1:04:11] that's right i change that one for a
[1:04:13] little bit
[1:04:14] one more time
[1:04:16] make sure you you're awake this morning
[1:04:18] we are awake this morning
[1:04:20] all right make sure we're awake because
[1:04:21] we want to we want to really drive this
[1:04:23] home today
[1:04:36] and then you know in the trailer and
[1:04:37] then when the movie comes
[1:04:41] brother sam walks out
[1:04:43] imagine you going to the go
[1:04:47] that's not what i paid for
[1:04:50] that's not what the rehearsal was about
[1:04:59] it doesn't make no sense right nothing
[1:05:01] isn't no false advertising i want my
[1:05:04] refund
[1:05:27] notice this now this is this is what we
[1:05:29] want to we want you to focus on today

[1:05:50] brother's here everybody else is like no
[1:05:52] no it don't interest me
[1:05:55] everybody wants their 15 minutes of fame
[1:05:59] i think i could do better than them
[1:06:07] that would be wonderful
[1:06:11] the crazy thing about it is that
[1:06:13] we would we would be okay being any
[1:06:16] character
[1:06:23] we would be happy with with being the
[1:06:25] one that that is dressed all messed up
[1:06:30] ugly
[1:06:31] [Music]
[1:06:45] notice this now pikacy
[1:06:48] some of you don't know this much there's
[1:06:50] no saving
[1:06:51] but i was in a movie
[1:06:55] i know you'll say
[1:06:57] i know you're wanting to you're wanting
[1:06:58] to know all
[1:07:05] and i took a road trip with my
[1:07:06] brother-in-law ray
[1:07:10] and we stopped in
[1:07:14] universal studios
[1:07:16] universal studios and there
[1:07:18] yeah i made a movie
[1:07:21] i know you'll see you guys want a copy
[1:07:24] of it but

[1:07:32] pilot in the family
[1:07:35] your brother was a pilot too
[1:07:37] and in that movie and that was who i was
[1:07:40] i was a pilot
[1:07:43] i was in this movie and and uh
[1:07:46] you know i i uh
[1:07:48] i was with a lot of celebrities

[1:07:58] i know you don't you don't now you're
[1:08:00] saying no the brother's not telling the
[1:08:02] truth it is true
[1:08:04] i was with jaws
[1:08:06] yes
[1:08:07] i was uh with um
[1:08:10] john wayne
[1:08:13] wayne he was already dead and i was
[1:08:14] still with him in the mood
[1:08:18] i had those flying saucers of the war of
[1:08:20] the worlds after me
[1:08:25] [Music]
[1:08:27] and so many countless other celebrities
[1:08:29] i don't even remember who they were
[1:08:33] but i'm going to give you the whole the
[1:08:34] the gist of this movie was was granny's
[1:08:38] bag
[1:08:41] and everybody was wanting to get a hold
[1:08:43] of granny's bag
[1:08:46] so one would get it and then
[1:08:49] cowboys and indian the indians came
[1:08:52] they were riding off and then they
[1:08:54] threw granny's bag
[1:08:57] granny's bag and kept running with it
[1:09:01] after a while granny's bag got thrown up
[1:09:04] in the air
[1:09:18] wow
[1:09:19] wow
[1:09:20] now let me go into my message
[1:09:26] i'm going to leave him hanging out
[1:09:29] because everybody doing it all they want
[1:09:31] to know is what was in the bag
[1:10:00] imagine
[1:10:01] the surprise as time went on
[1:10:06] that the lord showed me that
[1:10:08] i would be in another great drama
[1:10:12] it was the greatest honor
[1:10:15] of my life
[1:10:17] that i could be in a
[1:10:18] great drama the greatest drama that has
[1:10:21] ever has ever been told
[1:10:25] not a fairy tale not a man-made drama
[1:10:31] [Music]
[1:10:42] and that god would be so mindful
[1:10:45] that he would permit me to be
[1:10:47] in this great drama
[1:10:50] but not only me
[1:10:53] every one of you that is here this
[1:10:55] morning
[1:10:57] god has allowed you in and has permitted
[1:11:00] you to be part of that great drama
[1:11:03] now the tremendous thing is what i what
[1:11:06] i started with
[1:11:09] is that john and
[1:11:10] and these these these other disciples
[1:11:12] they they saw the rehearsal of it
[1:11:18] and the ones that they saw
[1:11:21] notice this now
[1:11:22] the ones that they saw
[1:11:25] cannot be different than those that
[1:11:27] actually came today
[1:11:32] that's right if if the preview showed
[1:11:35] who it was back then
[1:11:51] i don't know if that excites you but
[1:11:53] that excites me
[1:11:55] i think we should give one to the lord
[1:11:57] jesus this morning
[1:11:59] because he has allowed us to be part of
[1:12:02] this great this great drama
[1:12:06] when
[1:12:19] i'll say again oh what a script oh
[1:12:22] what a plan
[1:12:26] now for there to be a storyline
[1:12:30] this is important now
[1:12:32] for there to be a storyline
[1:12:43] i want you to get a hold of that this
[1:12:45] morning
[1:12:46] one more time
[1:12:47] you cannot have a storyline
[1:12:53] comes and draws the finite together
[1:12:58] what story line do we have of elohim
[1:13:02] when he existed of himself
[1:13:07] do we see a storyline
[1:13:09] historically oh there's a storyline all
[1:13:11] right
[1:13:12] but because in our state or our
[1:13:15] condition
[1:13:42] watch has the how the great spirit
[1:13:46] the great fountain
[1:13:49] the great
[1:13:51] elohim coming and putting on flesh
[1:13:55] changing his mask
[1:13:57] and then he would choose mere mortal men
[1:14:03] to follow him
[1:14:05] and be a part of his great drama
[1:14:09] drama then one day he takes these three
[1:14:12] of them
[1:14:14] and he takes them up a mountain and is
[1:14:16] transfigured before them
[1:14:20] we remember brother tim when he preached
[1:14:22] that message in in in december
[1:14:39] if you have it up there revelations
[1:14:40] chapter 4 of the message
[1:14:45] no the message not not but let me just
[1:14:47] go on because he taken peter james and
[1:14:50] john
[1:14:51] pedro up into the mountains
[1:14:54] apart
[1:15:08] oh amen amen
[1:15:11] how many can say amen this morning
[1:15:14] oh they were brought into
[1:15:16] into view of watching the kingdom of god
[1:15:33] and god takes one of them as we heard a
[1:15:35] while ago
[1:15:50] the next quote if you would
[1:15:52] jesus loved john jesus
[1:15:55] john was a man of love
[1:15:58] and they were asking he said what will
[1:15:59] happen to this man
[1:16:02] what's going to be his estate
[1:16:34] [Music]
[1:16:58] though he lived on earth
[1:17:15] the next the next clip
[1:17:18] and after the rest of them was dead and
[1:17:21] gone
[1:17:24] john lived to see the coming of the lord
[1:17:27] rehearsed in power
[1:17:43] is issued
[1:17:46] john saw every bit of it
[1:17:50] how many here are still the type of of
[1:17:52] john or john was the type of of the
[1:17:53] bride
[1:17:56] john saw every bit of it
[1:18:00] how many of you see
[1:18:02] every bit of it
[1:18:07] wait wait wait wait wait
[1:18:09] there's a disconnect here
[1:18:25] oh
[1:18:27] something's wrong somewhere
[1:18:30] because if john is typing the bride
[1:18:33] john saw every bit of it
[1:18:52] how is it possible
[1:18:54] somebody might say well brother ah i
[1:18:56] didn't i haven't seen every bit of it
[1:18:59] but don't you want to see every bit of
[1:19:00] it
[1:19:02] how else are you gonna know the part
[1:19:04] that you play
[1:19:07] we're already at the end
[1:19:10] we don't have a lot of time to sit here
[1:19:12] and say well
[1:19:13] maybe the lord just show it to me like
[1:19:14] that
[1:19:17] he already showed it
[1:19:20] god sent a mighty prophet
[1:19:23] through that great message
[1:19:27] all these mysteries would be unfolded
[1:19:31] you and i could see every bit of it
[1:19:43] hello everybody
[1:19:45] come on we gotta know where we're at by
[1:19:47] now
[1:20:03] ah
[1:20:05] life i beat and be won
[1:20:10] that's right
[1:20:11] we should be live already right i'm
[1:20:12] gonna stand
[1:20:15] hallelujah
[1:20:23] notice this now though we want to keep
[1:20:24] on going here but i want you to those
[1:20:26] are things that i want you to think
[1:20:28] about
[1:20:30] he saw every bit of it and the
[1:20:32] millennium over the millennium the
[1:20:34] kingdom age started
[1:20:36] millennials so he keeps his word
[1:20:40] doesn't he is the question
[1:20:42] does christ keep his word yes he does
[1:20:45] once again john saw the kingdom of god
[1:20:48] come in power
[1:20:52] the resurrection
[1:20:54] he saw the rapture
[1:20:56] he saw the ushering in the millennium
[1:21:22] there had to already be a film about it
[1:21:28] that's right
[1:21:29] i'm gonna say it again the only way that
[1:21:32] god could have showed john this
[1:21:34] is
[1:21:36] john had to get in the spirit
[1:21:39] to already see the the film that was
[1:21:42] already that was already made
[1:21:46] how's god going to show him a film that
[1:21:47] hasn't been made yet
[1:21:50] but he's showing him the rehearsal the
[1:21:52] preview of it all
[1:21:57] and so if you've seen the rehearsal
[1:22:00] there's nothing to be afraid of anymore
[1:22:02] right now
[1:22:04] that's right
[1:22:06] we heard brother abraham on friday
[1:22:30] we're afraid it's because we haven't
[1:22:32] seen the preview of it
[1:22:34] you already know what's going to happen
[1:22:36] up here
[1:22:42] is to practice in preparation for a
[1:22:44] public performance
[1:22:48] it's to train and prepare by means of
[1:22:51] rehearsals
[1:22:54] to retell or recite or repeat
[1:23:01] practice
[1:23:02] makes perfect
[1:23:28] here's the disconnect sometimes
[1:23:31] they say practice
[1:23:44] and we get some good messages
[1:24:40] why are we so worried about what
[1:24:42] everybody else is doing or saying
[1:24:46] keep your nose let's keep our nose on
[1:24:48] our face
[1:24:52] business nosy
[1:24:55] hello everybody
[1:24:57] i'm sorry i didn't mean to get off on
[1:24:58] that accident let me get back on the
[1:25:00] right
[1:25:01] okay
[1:25:03] don't worry about somebody else's part
[1:25:06] they have a script that is made just for
[1:25:08] them
[1:25:10] each
[1:25:23] or rehearse your own life
[1:25:29] just plainly ask you a question
[1:25:32] how many of you have seen the rehearsal
[1:25:34] of the resurrection
[1:25:40] this is what the holy spirit is trying
[1:25:42] to get to us
[1:25:45] how many have seen all the marvel movies
[1:25:47] marvel movies
[1:26:07] because it shows us
[1:26:08] the priorities in our life
[1:26:11] are wrong
[1:26:13] he does not have preeminence
[1:26:17] that's right hello everybody
[1:26:19] it doesn't have preeminence
[1:26:22] we can tell you every movie that has
[1:26:23] come out of hollywood
[1:26:26] but when the question is asked how many
[1:26:28] have seen the rehearsal
[1:26:31] how many have seen the rehearsal of the
[1:26:33] resurrection
[1:26:36] [Music]
[1:26:46] brother branham that says the rapture
[1:27:12] when's the last time you saw the
[1:27:13] rehearsal of the millennium

[1:51:15] god around the world
[1:52:00] of
[1:52:06] who finds themselves in this preview
[1:52:11] and you see what god has done
[1:52:15] he's put it right back in the lap of the
[1:52:18] people
[1:52:21] i've been thinking about this for a
[1:52:22] moment
[1:52:23] because here he is
[1:52:25] oh he would take the hand
[1:52:28] vibration let me see what's going on a
[1:52:29] germ something going on
[1:52:32] we saw that
[1:52:33] then he began to discern the hearts
[1:52:38] now that's leaving now
[1:52:41] coming up into another higher ministry
[1:52:50] because first it was well let me see
[1:52:52] i've got to go and i got to see you see
[1:52:53] if brother brandon can pray for me
[1:53:08] [Applause]
[1:53:24] under this
[1:53:36] okay who finds themselves in that
[1:53:38] premium
[1:53:49] but i cannot say it until he speaks to
[1:53:51] me you know
[1:54:00] [Music]
[1:54:06] because
[1:54:17] now a little later if i get a chance
[1:54:18] this is watchmen water of the night
[1:54:22] i'm going to tell you something that
[1:54:23] recently happened he says bringing in
[1:54:24] the new ministry
[1:54:27] he says where i'll just speak the word
[1:54:31] and it puts it right back into the lap
[1:54:32] of the people again
[1:54:46] give me like 15 minutes and i'll finish
[1:54:48] up
[1:55:00] we all know that jesus now listen
[1:55:01] closely to this
[1:55:03] we all know that jesus
[1:55:05] all his words
[1:55:07] were written
[1:55:08] in red
[1:55:13] letter bible that's what it shows
[1:55:16] they've even
[1:55:18] and that's the new testament but they've
[1:55:20] also made a red letter old testament
[1:55:25] and so when we when we see him
[1:55:29] he says
[1:55:31] to be able to speak it
[1:55:35] the problem is is that many times we
[1:55:36] don't even believe our own our own words
[1:55:40] we were up there yes on wednesday
[1:55:43] we're talking about different things
[1:55:56] if your words were written down
[1:56:11] would our words be written in red or
[1:56:14] black
[1:56:16] jesus
[1:56:19] words were written
[1:56:23] think about it for a moment
[1:56:26] but even you say well that was him in
[1:56:28] his car in his corporal body here on
[1:56:29] earth
[1:56:31] but when he spoke to oh
[1:56:34] he was not in that body
[1:56:37] yet his words when he said i am jesus
[1:56:40] whom thou persecuted
[1:56:52] but this is the kicker
[1:56:59] [Music]
[1:57:03] yes sir
[1:57:04] the bible said it is he that testifies
[1:57:08] that sayeth
[1:57:19] it was the angel that was testifying
[1:57:32] [Music]
[1:57:32] [Applause]
[1:57:36] then
[1:57:44] [Applause]
[1:57:48] and the preview has already come
[1:58:01] [Applause]
[1:58:18] yes
[1:58:32] her words are written in red
[1:58:37] that's when she says
[1:58:39] i forgive you
[1:58:43] that's in
[1:58:45] rojo
[1:58:47] when she says
[1:58:50] i love you
[1:58:56] i give you grace
[1:59:12] so the bible says the spirit the
[1:59:14] relation
[1:59:25] you might say brother you say that a lot
[1:59:27] every time this is
[1:59:39] because the fifo ministry is part of the
[1:59:41] script
[1:59:53] you're going to need it one of these
[1:59:54] days you're going to run across somebody
[1:59:55] that's going to
[2:00:10] will the bride have a ministry
[2:00:14] it'll be made up of apostles and
[2:00:16] prophets teachers evangelists pastors
[2:00:17] it's going on now
[2:00:21] what kind of spirit would want to change
[2:00:22] that scripture
[2:00:41] but if there is a false ministry there's
[2:00:43] got to be a true ministry
[2:00:48] and that ministry doesn't preach their
[2:00:49] own message
[2:01:03] but what happens to people now listen
[2:01:05] closer
[2:01:20] let's see who we
[2:01:28] that's not
[2:01:29] our
[2:01:34] script going to say it again that's not
[2:01:36] our script
[2:01:40] the gentile dispensation started with
[2:01:42] the
[2:01:42] worship of a holy man
[2:01:47] and it'll end with the worship of a holy
[2:01:48] man
[2:01:51] who was that holy man that they were
[2:01:52] worshiping
[2:01:54] daniel the prophet
[2:01:58] that's right
[2:02:03] they love to use this quote
[2:02:06] god only deals with one man
[2:02:09] he don't deal with many men
[2:02:12] many men have many ideas
[2:02:14] and i say amen to them amen
[2:02:19] that's what he said and i say amen to
[2:02:21] them
[2:02:22] but who is that one man
[2:02:26] who is that one man oh this man is the
[2:02:28] one man now
[2:02:31] wow
[2:02:34] that's not the script today
[2:02:37] brother branham never pointed anyone to
[2:02:39] himself
[2:02:42] the people always to jesus christ
[2:02:58] hear these words
[2:03:00] jesus of nazareth
[2:03:03] approved of god
[2:03:05] what else do i need than that
[2:03:09] jesus said if i be lifted up because
[2:03:12] i
[2:03:39] i'm gonna go ahead and read it
[2:04:07] down since genesis
[2:04:09] heaviest thing the beginning el
[2:04:10] principio surely somewhere
[2:04:13] god has a man amen
[2:04:17] that he can lay his hand on now
[2:04:22] what brother branham said and i say
[2:04:27] that's right for he
[2:04:30] he's more than one man now
[2:04:34] is
[2:04:37] [Applause]
[2:04:51] because we're coming down to the
[2:04:53] gathering time the harvest time
[2:04:59] now this is not for any other reason but
[2:05:01] brother jacobs told us this yes
[2:05:04] and all honoring
[2:05:13] [Music]
[2:05:32] oh he said she said i didn't see three
[2:05:36] men
[2:05:37] i saw one man
[2:05:41] hallelujah
[2:05:43] that's all
[2:05:44] she saw
[2:05:59] then we won't have to be looking to see
[2:06:00] who would be the the next guy we can
[2:06:02] lift up
[2:06:05] notices now the only way that we can
[2:06:08] walk as one man
[2:06:11] the recognition that everyone has their
[2:06:13] own offices
[2:06:26] everyone has their own jurisdiction
[2:06:32] and we are we are taught don't get out
[2:06:34] of your jurisdiction
[2:06:39] in a local assembly
[2:06:41] there's one man
[2:06:55] there should only be one man the highest
[2:06:56] authority is the husband
[2:06:58] he is the father of the holy spirit
[2:07:02] but what about worldwide
[2:07:05] that's easy
[2:07:06] if i go visit brother fabio
[2:07:09] yeah that's the one man there yes
[2:07:12] what do i do
[2:07:13] i submit to that
[2:07:14] office
[2:07:17] and then when brother father says
[2:07:19] whatever you like whatever the lord
[2:07:20] gives you you preach whatever god means
[2:07:23] give me the okay
[2:07:40] i don't know where it's at but i'm going
[2:07:41] to try to say it without
[2:07:46] let's see i can say it
[2:07:52] has
[2:08:04] that's what he would say everywhere we
[2:08:06] would go
[2:08:21] you say 16 men are going to africa
[2:08:26] one man is gone
[2:08:30] and you all are part of that one man
[2:08:35] [Music]
[2:08:49] the body and the drama work together
[2:08:54] you're each once said in god's economy
[2:09:01] come on this is the way it works
[2:09:15] yes
[2:09:27] all the time and communes with god that
[2:09:29] doesn't mean that there's only one
[2:09:30] person that fast okay
[2:09:33] but we're watching god's economy
[2:09:35] one more time one fast all the time and
[2:09:37] communes with god
[2:09:39] we don't need to fast and do to do all
[2:09:40] that stuff
[2:09:43] but there's somebody in the body that
[2:09:44] doesn't
[2:09:57] because of the one that's fasting
[2:10:03] i like that man that's good stuff to me
[2:10:06] that's why he can cast out devils
[2:10:09] somebody in the body is
[2:10:26] what makes god omnipresent
[2:10:29] he knows all things
[2:10:32] so he doesn't have to be everywhere
[2:10:36] wait a minute wait a minute wait a
[2:10:37] minute this is good stuff and i'm
[2:10:39] finishing up with this
[2:10:53] how is he
