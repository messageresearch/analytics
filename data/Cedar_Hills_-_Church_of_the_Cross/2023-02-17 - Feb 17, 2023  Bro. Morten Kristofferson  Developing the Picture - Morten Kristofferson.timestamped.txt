[47:48] God bless you everyone
[47:52] apples pretty many people
[47:55] is
[47:58] but it's a great privilege for me to be
[48:01] here again
[48:06] I feel like yeah being at home
[48:10] with my family
[48:13] and I I truly
[48:16] well my um
[48:18] I wish I also had my wife
[48:22] and and all our people in Norway with me
[48:26] but
[48:30] um
[48:31] I'm happy to have two sons with me
[48:37] my son brother Marcus and my son-in-law
[48:40] brother Freddie
[48:45] so so that's a great blessing for me
[48:50] so I I want to
[48:54] thank brother Caleb
[48:57] Thomas and all the brothers for
[49:03] such a wonderful reception
[49:08] and make us feel at home
[49:12] and feel relaxed and
[49:17] um
[49:19] I I had a little uh
[49:22] a little bit a very important
[49:24] conversation with with brother your
[49:26] elder brother Abraham
[49:28] conversation
[49:32] right before the service
[49:35] and I appreciate that so much and
[49:42] I told him I'm I'm here just to learn
[49:45] from you
[49:49] I'm you know I'm a young man yeah
[49:55] so I have to learn because this thing
[49:58] will keep happening there and since
[50:04] I I Was Here For the First Time December
[50:07] 2021 you started
[50:10] I will say so many things have happened
[50:17] since I I was walking up in the forest
[50:23] there in Norway
[50:26] Floresta in Norway and asking for God's
[50:29] leading
[50:32] and when he finally answered my my
[50:37] prayers
[50:39] I I got more blessed than I could ever
[50:43] think of because
[50:48] I believe everything was in God's
[50:50] perfect timing
[50:54] and that's an important thing yes
[50:57] because God he has a program
[51:00] and he has a timing for that problem
[51:04] so he puts all the pieces in the right
[51:08] place
[51:10] and the right timing
[51:13] so um
[51:15] so many thing I would like to say but um
[51:22] I will
[51:24] spend all together a couple of weeks
[51:25] here
[51:28] so we will probably have some more time
[51:30] together
[51:33] but I wanted to know that um
[51:36] I see you quite often
[51:40] not just once in a while
[51:43] but uh at least twice a week
[51:48] but you don't see me
[51:51] [Laughter]
[51:54] but um
[51:55] we we feel like like brother Abraham
[51:58] said we we have to speak the same
[52:00] language
[52:04] so that's so important it's not
[52:07] important
[52:08] I I see brother Adolfo Mata here and uh
[52:11] may God bless you brother
[52:15] I met brother Adolfo for the first time
[52:18] in Colombia in 2018
[52:26] and the year after I had the great
[52:29] privilege of staying in so
[52:48] I have
[52:51] I have a simple message to share with
[52:53] you today and
[52:58] um
[52:59] I call it the second part is
[53:03] because it's the second part of the
[53:06] message I spoke here in December 2021
[53:09] because
[53:15] well some people they think I'm a little
[53:18] bit slow
[53:21] but I believe it's superb
[53:24] I I tried my best to find something else
[53:27] to preach but those things they came to
[53:29] me again and again
[53:35] so I I better believe that there is a
[53:38] purpose
[53:42] so um
[53:49] so let's read from
[53:51] from The Book of Romans
[53:55] and um
[53:58] it's chapter 8 verse 29 to 30.
[54:06] and I I want to thank brother Caleb and
[54:10] brother Thomas for for the confidence
[54:15] stand behind this uh
[54:19] this puppets
[54:24] so um
[54:26] it's not actually an easy easy thing to
[54:29] do but uh
[54:33] we trust in the Lord
[54:37] that he can bring something to us
[54:43] so let's read Romans 8 29 30.
[54:49] in Jesus name Jesus
[54:55] for whom he did for now he also did
[54:59] predestinate
[55:01] to be conformed to the image of his son
[55:06] that he might be the firstborn among
[55:09] many bretons
[55:20] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[55:24] he also called and whom he called them
[55:27] he also Justified and whom he justified
[55:30] them he also glorified
[55:40] I am the father we thank you so much for
[55:43] his mercy and Grace gracias thank you
[55:46] for taking care of us
[55:48] thank you for leading and guiding us
[55:52] and thank you for letting us be a part
[55:56] of this wonderful Revelation for this
[55:59] hour
[56:02] and that you predestinated us before the
[56:06] foundation of the world
[56:10] and as brother Branham once said
[56:14] there is a purpose with every one of us
[56:17] here tonight
[56:20] so father I ask you that you may bless
[56:24] all my brothers and sisters
[56:33] in the name of Jesus Christ
[56:36] amen amen you might be seated
[56:46] so the thing I was thinking about was to
[56:50] be confirmed to the image
[56:56] what kind of image
[56:59] it
[57:01] it's the image of his son is
[57:07] so um
[57:10] he says something really interesting
[57:12] here this is
[57:15] that our own life is just a pattern
[57:20] foreign
[57:30] and not the real thing
[57:32] so when we see each other here we
[57:36] actually we we don't see the real thing
[57:41] we see the negative side
[57:47] but the real thing is the picture he
[57:50] took of you and me way back
[57:55] when he said let us make man in our
[57:59] image
[58:03] right so when God created man
[58:07] it was in his image
[58:10] in the image of God created him
[58:15] male and female created
[58:21] so when brother Branham speaks about
[58:23] this picture
[58:26] he says that this
[58:28] is the main thing is importante
[58:33] and then he says in the resurrection
[58:36] those gases and acids and things
[58:43] comes right back into the place
[58:47] and develops this picture again
[58:55] so the the question is when was this
[58:58] picture taken
[59:02] not when you was 16.
[59:07] or 18 or 20 years
[59:11] at your best
[59:13] when was it taken
[59:16] before there was a foundation of the
[59:19] world
[59:22] and it was put in God's Great pile
[59:31] and God's Great Fire
[59:33] de dios
[59:36] and then
[59:37] only thing it did was featured itself
[59:41] here for you to make your choice
[59:49] then then you become a servant of God
[59:55] him for knowing it
[1:00:06] as we have been through it
[1:00:13] but there is something
[1:00:15] when we talk about it
[1:00:20] a picture
[1:00:23] must not only be taken
[1:00:28] but it most must also be developedics
[1:00:35] all right
[1:00:36] you know I I used to be a photographer
[1:00:39] photographer and I took so many pictures
[1:00:43] muchas photos but pretty often I didn't
[1:00:47] develop the film bro you know obviously
[1:00:53] so I I just took the film out of the
[1:00:57] camera of the camera and put it in a
[1:00:59] little bag
[1:01:02] and I took care of that little bag with
[1:01:06] with films
[1:01:11] and I still have that little bag with
[1:01:14] maybe it's like 20 films
[1:01:20] and we have been moving from place to
[1:01:23] place during many years
[1:01:26] and I I have taken that thing back with
[1:01:29] me to all those places
[1:01:33] but until this day I don't know what
[1:01:36] kind of pictures they are on those
[1:01:38] things
[1:01:43] because I I never developed a few
[1:01:46] foreign
[1:02:21] so
[1:02:22] what I'm talking about now is
[1:02:25] old-fashioned photography is
[1:02:40] this is
[1:02:51] to put this back in the Tiffany we come
[1:02:54] from foreign
[1:03:08] thank you
[1:03:09] it takes death muerte
[1:03:14] so listen to this is
[1:03:20] so he gets the Eternal spiritual
[1:03:24] eterno his attribute displayed in that
[1:03:28] body
[1:03:31] then like any picture in its negative
[1:03:35] form so this is
[1:03:39] [Music]
[1:03:43] there it is developed Aji is
[1:03:47] it comes out to the perfect picture
[1:03:53] and we go into the dark rooms
[1:03:57] but to come out after the negative has
[1:04:01] been a perfect picture
[1:04:08] in the image of Christ
[1:04:13] we go into the dark gray in tamus
[1:04:18] into the dark room for developing
[1:04:22] it takes death
[1:04:27] and then he says
[1:04:29] just like it takes death
[1:04:32] to yourself
[1:04:35] to develop the picture of the image of
[1:04:38] Christ
[1:04:41] The Life of Christ in you
[1:04:46] you have to dump your own up
[1:04:55] so that Christ can come in
[1:04:59] you have to die to yourself
[1:05:04] exactly
[1:05:10] something very important here now
[1:05:15] anything if there is a negative
[1:05:20] there's got to be a positive
[1:05:24] before there can be a negative
[1:05:29] therefore if it if this is a negative
[1:05:34] there's got to be a positive somewhere
[1:05:39] so we heard that we are living in a
[1:05:44] negative form here this is
[1:05:48] that means it must be a positive of you
[1:05:51] and me somewhere significance
[1:05:54] but the question is how can I find that
[1:05:58] that real me
[1:06:04] because the one I see in the mirror
[1:06:06] every morning is not the real meaning
[1:06:11] and and the more I look at him the more
[1:06:14] happy I am that this is not the real me
[1:06:21] because I'm living in a dying body
[1:06:27] so but the question is where is the
[1:06:29] positive style positivo the only way to
[1:06:33] find out
[1:06:41] and have it turned into a positive
[1:06:48] that cannot be done the digital way
[1:07:01] exactly
[1:07:04] Sacramento
[1:07:08] but this is to be developed is a kind of
[1:07:12] scary scary process is
[1:07:17] because Brothers
[1:07:20] someday that death shall develop the
[1:07:24] picture from the negative to the person
[1:07:29] and when we go through that terrible
[1:07:34] acid of death
[1:07:39] then we will know as we are known and
[1:07:44] see face to face
[1:07:51] aren't we looking forward to that
[1:07:55] but to get to that experience
[1:07:59] we have to go through something
[1:08:03] terrible and we don't like
[1:08:10] we don't like that herbal acid
[1:08:14] but I have been a photographer
[1:08:17] so I know in order to develop pictures
[1:08:24] I have to go into a dark room
[1:08:27] and I'm using acid is yeah
[1:08:32] so we we can't
[1:08:35] bypass that is
[1:08:39] but the process is for a purpose
[1:08:43] and if we could only understand
[1:08:48] if we could always believe
[1:08:52] that when we are going through things
[1:08:56] and find ourselves in a dark room you
[1:08:59] know
[1:09:01] there is
[1:09:06] but it's the test for you and me
[1:09:10] because when everything go well
[1:09:15] we are in the light
[1:09:18] and we have a good time
[1:09:21] enough money
[1:09:23] and not too many bills to pay
[1:09:27] it's easy
[1:09:30] but we are not
[1:09:33] here to have an easy life
[1:09:39] we are here to be our Commerce
[1:09:44] because the Lord wants to prove
[1:09:47] something
[1:09:48] that those
[1:09:50] key predestinated
[1:09:54] they are not here just to live a life
[1:09:58] and put on clothes
[1:10:00] and go to the word
[1:10:03] and eat food
[1:10:05] and and drive cars
[1:10:08] but they are here to overcome things
[1:10:15] things because that can only be overcome
[1:10:18] by
[1:10:20] faith is
[1:10:32] that easy and that difficult I see the
[1:10:35] facilities
[1:10:36] it depends on how you see it depends
[1:10:41] if you if you try to understand all
[1:10:43] those things it will become very
[1:10:45] different
[1:10:48] but when you come into the dimension of
[1:10:52] faith
[1:10:55] you can rest
[1:10:58] and God will do it
[1:11:01] but we must first come into that
[1:11:06] dimensions
[1:11:10] [Music]
[1:11:23] because this word is a Living Word okay
[1:11:28] so
[1:11:30] before we can develop
[1:11:33] a picture
[1:11:35] we must take the picture and
[1:11:39] what is the real meaning of Photography
[1:11:47] the word photography means
[1:11:56] and the scripture tells us that God is
[1:11:59] alive
[1:12:02] and in him is no Darkness
[1:12:08] but he is
[1:12:14] so we are not children of Darkness
[1:12:21] you see
[1:12:26] because he was drawing by light foreign
[1:12:44] but then
[1:12:45] he let us come to this earth is
[1:12:56] and to be conformed to the image of who
[1:13:00] it is
[1:13:06] who is the first born
[1:13:09] you see
[1:13:15] so um
[1:13:16] without light
[1:13:18] there will be no pictures
[1:13:24] but the question is
[1:13:26] do we really want to be developed in
[1:13:34] I I hear many amen here that kid
[1:13:40] so the next question is
[1:13:43] are we willing to die is
[1:13:48] hooray
[1:13:54] that's really serious yeah
[1:13:58] and um
[1:14:00] the theme for for for
[1:14:03] those meetings the day I died
[1:14:09] and I was thinking
[1:14:12] when did I die yes
[1:14:16] and I said to brother Caleb I feel like
[1:14:23] and that's the truth yes we have to die
[1:14:27] everywhere
[1:14:29] that's the processo
[1:14:36] so
[1:14:37] Glory
[1:14:39] the the process of death is is pretty
[1:14:43] painful isn't it
[1:14:45] we don't like it
[1:14:48] according to our human flesh we we try
[1:14:52] to
[1:14:53] find ways
[1:14:57] to bypass the sovereign
[1:15:11] but we have to understand that
[1:15:16] God he
[1:15:19] is the same yesterday
[1:15:26] and if we for example if we go
[1:15:29] back to
[1:15:31] Hebrews 11.
[1:15:34] and read about our brothers and sisters
[1:15:38] you can easily see that they spent
[1:15:42] uh a pretty great part of their life in
[1:15:46] the dark room
[1:15:47] tomorrow
[1:15:50] developing pictures
[1:15:53] you see Ben
[1:15:55] and the fact is
[1:15:57] in this momentum they are waiting for us
[1:16:02] that we
[1:16:04] May fulfill you know the same blood and
[1:16:08] mismo processo because they cannot be
[1:16:12] perfected without you know
[1:16:16] because they are already developed
[1:16:22] still not fully developed
[1:16:25] completely until
[1:16:27] entiende
[1:16:39] yeah
[1:16:41] so
[1:16:44] just to
[1:16:45] explain the developing processes
[1:16:51] and and just to uh not go too much into
[1:16:54] details
[1:16:57] but the first thing
[1:16:59] we do when when we have a potential
[1:17:03] picture is it
[1:17:07] it it looks like just a white paper
[1:17:13] Blanco and and you take the negative
[1:17:18] and you are projecting light
[1:17:21] through the negative it's the projector
[1:17:24] lose
[1:17:24] into that
[1:17:26] white paper and they say papel Blanco
[1:17:29] and you can still see nothing on that
[1:17:31] paper
[1:17:32] you have to believe
[1:17:34] that there is something yeah
[1:17:42] and in the dark room it is dark
[1:17:45] but there is it's a little lighter
[1:17:50] with red light is
[1:17:52] it's a red color
[1:17:55] Rojo so wherever you look if you look at
[1:17:58] yourself pants and whatever in the dark
[1:18:00] rooms
[1:18:02] it has a red color
[1:18:05] because that red color it covers
[1:18:08] everything
[1:18:12] you see
[1:18:14] and it's only under that color
[1:18:19] that the picture can be developedics
[1:18:24] and that's the color of the blood is it
[1:18:26] color de la Sangre
[1:18:30] only under the blood is
[1:18:35] we cannot make it by ourselves
[1:18:41] but just hit ourselves our whole life
[1:18:44] and everything under the blood because
[1:18:48] the developing process can start it was
[1:18:56] so don't try to bypass it is
[1:19:04] so when you turn on the light
[1:19:08] and you make an exposure exposition
[1:19:13] or a certain amount of time
[1:19:17] and then you take this paper
[1:19:22] and put it into the acido
[1:19:27] it's a developing liquidity
[1:19:32] and when you have put the paper there
[1:19:35] you
[1:19:37] you can't do nothing more
[1:19:40] you can just step back and and just just
[1:19:43] watch it
[1:19:46] it's a kind of magic momentum
[1:19:51] when you see the picture coming forward
[1:19:55] little by little
[1:20:00] and and then little ballet you you can
[1:20:03] understand the picture
[1:20:06] you are recognizing things
[1:20:09] but you have to wait until the process
[1:20:14] is is fulfilled because
[1:20:19] and don't run right out of the diagram
[1:20:22] into the light to look at the picture
[1:20:26] because you you have to go through the
[1:20:29] whole process
[1:20:31] so when when the picture has come
[1:20:34] forward
[1:20:36] then you take the picture out of the
[1:20:39] developer
[1:20:42] and you put it into water
[1:20:47] Travis
[1:20:58] you see yeah
[1:21:01] very important it's more important don't
[1:21:04] skip the washing by the water no no no
[1:21:09] because it must be worse
[1:21:14] under the red color Rojo
[1:21:21] and the last stage here
[1:21:25] is when you take the picture out of the
[1:21:27] water
[1:21:29] and put it into the preservation
[1:21:33] liquidity
[1:21:35] [Music]
[1:21:39] the preservation preservative that makes
[1:21:42] the picture last forever
[1:21:49] understand it must be preserved
[1:21:53] and then it will last
[1:22:03] you can look at the pictures
[1:22:06] and just for a few seconds it looks nice
[1:22:11] but because it is still not preserved
[1:22:16] it
[1:22:21] is completely black Negro
[1:22:25] [Music]
[1:22:29] no no
[1:22:31] exactly right brother
[1:22:36] and you know what sorry
[1:22:40] he was the first one El for primero to
[1:22:43] invent digital technology
[1:22:49] because he was so smart
[1:22:53] and he tried to sell this technology to
[1:22:56] Jesus Jesus
[1:22:59] he tried to have Jesus skipping the
[1:23:02] processed
[1:23:05] [Applause]
[1:23:07] yeah
[1:23:09] just skip the death process
[1:23:13] the pain okay
[1:23:16] just worship me
[1:23:19] and you will become a king right away
[1:23:23] it's not easy
[1:23:26] you don't have to go to the cross and
[1:23:29] mess with water and blood and all that
[1:23:32] stuff
[1:23:33] going into darkness
[1:23:38] and Satan he knew is if he would have
[1:23:42] success with this yes and selling his
[1:23:45] smart idea to Jesus
[1:23:49] he knew something
[1:23:53] we would never ever
[1:24:00] that's the reason is he tried to sell
[1:24:04] this smart idea Jesus
[1:24:10] Jesus
[1:24:12] aura
[1:24:43] you see Ben understand yeah
[1:24:49] so
[1:24:52] you know seven
[1:24:56] I have really enjoyed listening to
[1:25:00] to the sermon here on Sundays about
[1:25:03] worship is
[1:25:12] truth and spirits
[1:25:17] and and I come to the conclusion Bingo
[1:25:20] you are a conclusion that the only way
[1:25:22] to
[1:25:24] to worship the the way that pleases God
[1:25:28] because
[1:25:31] I must bring a sacrifice
[1:25:36] but as sacrifice is not just enough
[1:25:40] noise
[1:25:53] [Music]
[1:25:55] but
[1:25:56] but can he developed something from his
[1:25:59] own mind
[1:26:02] it was his own idea
[1:26:06] and we it was a good idea yeah so he
[1:26:10] brought from something really beautiful
[1:26:13] but that beautiful sacrifice is not my
[1:26:18] God
[1:26:22] but Abel also developed something
[1:26:27] and that was
[1:26:30] to
[1:26:35] God's word
[1:26:37] it was according to a revelation
[1:26:42] that it had to be blood
[1:26:47] you see Ben
[1:26:50] so that sacrifice was not so beautiful
[1:26:53] this is
[1:26:55] but it was that sacrifice the Lord
[1:26:58] accepted
[1:27:04] and because of that sacrifice you and I
[1:27:06] we are here today
[1:27:10] as worshipers
[1:27:12] because Abel he had the revelation of
[1:27:15] what happened in the garden
[1:27:18] and he also had the Revelation that that
[1:27:21] this sacrifice it was also this this
[1:27:25] lamb was pointing it I mean perfect
[1:27:28] is
[1:27:33] but his brother can he had no
[1:27:36] Revelations
[1:27:37] but he was a smart man
[1:27:40] and he was a very good worship
[1:27:57] the only thing that God can accept
[1:28:02] is worth
[1:28:04] the death must take place
[1:28:08] but from that death life comes up
[1:28:12] because it is so
[1:28:15] why are we so afraid of this terrible
[1:28:18] assets
[1:28:21] it's painful yes
[1:28:24] but it brings from something
[1:28:27] wonderful
[1:28:29] that is 100 according to God's will
[1:28:34] because
[1:28:36] it's perfect
[1:28:39] and that's the image of Christ
[1:28:42] amen amen
[1:28:46] yeah
[1:28:48] so
[1:28:53] here is something okay I'll go really
[1:28:56] beautiful
[1:28:59] that brother Branham he says this is and
[1:29:02] he's praying here
[1:29:04] and he says Dear God
[1:29:06] the Great and Mighty God is
[1:29:11] formed All Things by the power of His
[1:29:14] spirit
[1:29:17] and brought Jesus Christ
[1:29:19] his only begotten son
[1:29:22] you freely died for these Sinners
[1:29:29] just for the and yes
[1:29:35] to reconcile us back to reconciliation
[1:29:39] of the regression into His Marvelous
[1:29:42] Fellowship into maraville companies that
[1:29:47] we have again with God
[1:29:53] that we have again
[1:29:55] it means that it had to be something
[1:29:58] before significance
[1:30:00] and now it happens again
[1:30:04] the same thing again oh
[1:30:10] [Music]
[1:30:11] like the brothers they're saying now we
[1:30:14] are going into the nitty-gritty
[1:30:20] yes or yes COC
[1:30:32] let me say that again
[1:30:34] to reconsile us back into this marvelous
[1:30:38] Fellowship reconciliers
[1:30:42] that we have again with God
[1:30:47] as we are taught in the Blessed word
[1:30:54] that we have fellowship with him
[1:30:58] before the foundation of the world
[1:31:06] but we couldn't remember it
[1:31:09] until this message came
[1:31:13] and as as a broker I think it was
[1:31:16] brother Thomas he said the purpose with
[1:31:18] this message is
[1:31:21] to make us remember
[1:31:25] what happened back there
[1:31:28] and understand by Revelation who we are
[1:31:31] Revelation
[1:31:33] you see then
[1:31:36] and then we are willingly going through
[1:31:40] the death process foreign
[1:32:22] how do we know
[1:32:25] that that wasn't at the same time
[1:32:29] that the lamb was slain
[1:32:33] that when God in his great thinking
[1:32:39] shouting and rejoicing in our ways and
[1:32:43] tradition s
[1:32:46] wow
[1:32:52] that's something
[1:32:56] really that
[1:33:03] when we really let that think
[1:33:08] and start
[1:33:11] understanding
[1:33:13] does great plans
[1:33:16] that Marvel's great plan is
[1:33:21] [Music]
[1:33:34] having Fellowship again
[1:33:38] rejoicing again
[1:33:44] it's not for the first time
[1:33:52] and I can tell you something
[1:33:55] this will never end yes
[1:33:59] it will last forever
[1:34:04] processo
[1:34:12] and the Lord he let me go through a
[1:34:14] little process here a few days ago
[1:34:21] and when we find ourselves in that dark
[1:34:23] room
[1:34:25] we are getting so self-pity you know
[1:34:31] in my life
[1:34:35] I I found myself on a plane
[1:34:39] but before that
[1:34:41] moment something happened
[1:34:44] algo Paso
[1:34:47] I was on my way to Las Cruces you were
[1:34:50] at the Camino a Las Cruces but my flight
[1:34:52] was canceled
[1:34:54] I was supposed to go to Dallas first
[1:34:58] but it was canceled and I got a message
[1:35:02] and I was so happy you can go to uh
[1:35:04] Phoenix
[1:35:09] yeah I buy that
[1:35:12] but then I got another message
[1:35:15] we are sorry to tell you that your
[1:35:17] flight to Phoenix is campus
[1:35:22] and now it starts becoming real serious
[1:35:24] for me
[1:35:26] then I got a new message
[1:35:30] flight to Los Angeles
[1:35:37] I can tell you I got up half past three
[1:35:40] in the morning in LA in in hospital
[1:35:46] and my flight to London was two hours
[1:35:50] delayed
[1:35:55] and then
[1:36:03] and they they let me go from London
[1:36:08] icelandia and Greenland
[1:36:11] Greenland and Canada
[1:36:15] and then to Los Angeles
[1:36:18] for me it was
[1:36:19] I felt like I I was on my way to the
[1:36:23] Moon
[1:36:27] foreign
[1:37:02] senor
[1:37:09] I I think Lord this is the last time I'm
[1:37:13] going to the Euros
[1:37:16] yeah I I'm not made for this
[1:37:20] it's too much for me
[1:37:25] so when I arrived Los Angeles Los
[1:37:29] Angeles
[1:37:30] at the immigration I think it was at
[1:37:32] least 1 000 people in front of me
[1:37:38] so I thought I would have plenty of time
[1:37:41] to have some food
[1:37:45] I had to go like
[1:37:49] and when I finally come to the desk the
[1:37:54] police officer when did you get so mad
[1:37:56] on me immigration because I was so tired
[1:38:00] that I could hardly tell my name is
[1:38:05] foreign
[1:38:21] I'm not sure I would survive Jonah says
[1:38:26] so
[1:38:28] finally I have my departure from Los
[1:38:30] Angeles Sarco De Los Angeles
[1:38:35] and I I got to El Paso by midnight
[1:38:39] and and I had
[1:38:42] a reserved a place to stay
[1:38:46] but it was already more than one o'clock
[1:38:49] until I put my head on the pillow
[1:38:54] I was completely posted
[1:38:58] but you guess what
[1:39:01] three o'clock in the morning
[1:39:03] the telephone range
[1:39:07] and it was a lady from Norway
[1:39:10] and and she wanted to sell me some
[1:39:12] omega-3s
[1:39:17] and I felt like
[1:39:21] Am I Dreaming or what's going on
[1:39:34] but I have a little bit brother Henry
[1:39:37] upstairs before the service
[1:39:42] and he understood something that I
[1:39:45] didn't understand through the death
[1:39:47] process
[1:39:52] he said
[1:39:53] oh this is easy
[1:39:56] you had to go to okay reverse to the
[1:39:59] west
[1:40:00] and then you have to return and go to
[1:40:03] the east
[1:40:05] should bring the gospel
[1:40:08] in Las Cruces well it makes sense for me
[1:40:14] hahaha
[1:40:15] because the gospel had to go that way
[1:40:19] all the way
[1:40:27] so
[1:40:29] finally I came to myself
[1:40:33] a little bit un poco
[1:40:37] but when I look back when the mirror
[1:40:39] well it was not that bad because
[1:40:43] I could make it and now I feel good
[1:40:47] I'm through it
[1:40:50] and every test is like that is a c if it
[1:40:54] just go through it
[1:40:58] to being developed
[1:41:00] and when we look back foreign
[1:41:07] when you find yourself
[1:41:09] in that dark room
[1:41:12] just be sure to have that bread all
[1:41:15] around
[1:41:22] [Music]
[1:41:25] and and I can tell you something
[1:41:28] You Are Not Alone
[1:41:33] because there is an angel there
[1:41:38] all the time
[1:41:42] if we could only believe that so
[1:41:47] it would be easier
[1:41:51] to always believe that God's angel is
[1:41:59] the only way we can believe it is by
[1:42:04] faith is
[1:42:06] is yeah
[1:42:08] and and that's the thing with the whole
[1:42:11] process yes
[1:42:12] with our journey
[1:42:15] um
[1:42:18] [Music]
[1:42:27] we have a desire of understanding of
[1:42:31] things
[1:42:33] and especially when when things are
[1:42:36] going on especially
[1:42:38] and sometimes we
[1:42:42] maybe the people are some people are
[1:42:44] offending us you know because
[1:42:47] and we try to understand why why did he
[1:42:50] say that
[1:42:51] why did he do that is that right this is
[1:42:55] a correct we so many questions are
[1:42:58] coming
[1:43:00] but all those things
[1:43:02] and easily mess up the whole thing
[1:43:05] because
[1:43:07] our calling is not to understand of
[1:43:10] foreign
[1:43:36] you say
[1:43:38] because I I grew up democracy at the
[1:43:41] countryside
[1:43:43] and and it was Farms all around
[1:43:50] and and I I saw
[1:43:53] farmers
[1:43:55] who were not
[1:43:58] Believers
[1:44:01] still they came to a point where they
[1:44:04] had to believe
[1:44:06] that was when they took the seed yes
[1:44:16] and the kid couldn't see nothing bernada
[1:44:19] the day after
[1:44:21] like
[1:44:23] a week later
[1:44:28] that they had to believe
[1:44:30] because from that scene they they they
[1:44:33] had their income
[1:44:40] you see men but in order to to get their
[1:44:45] income
[1:44:49] that the seeds
[1:44:53] would bring something
[1:44:56] and would be multiplied
[1:44:59] into something big in alcohol
[1:45:03] think of that you didn't say this only
[1:45:06] even even an unbelievable
[1:45:11] What About Us
[1:45:14] who
[1:45:16] has a privilege
[1:45:18] of believing this message
[1:45:24] so next time my brother and sister
[1:45:27] I I want to encourage
[1:45:30] animal that you find yourself in the
[1:45:33] dark room yes

[1:45:38] tomorrow morning
[1:45:46] and you willingly go through the
[1:45:50] processed
[1:45:56] so we we don't have to be afraid
[1:46:00] but we have God's promises
[1:46:05] and this flesh will never ever believe
[1:46:08] it yes
[1:46:11] so what we see is not the believer
[1:46:14] but the believer is inside us
[1:46:18] just make sure that you feed the beliefs
[1:46:25] with the Living Word of God
[1:46:28] every day you see Ben
[1:46:34] so what will then happen take the
