[41:32] is
[41:57] i'm originally from guadalajara mexico
[42:00] [Music]
[42:05] i was born in the year 1974 many years
[42:07] ago
[42:11] and in my infancy
[42:14] possibly in during my my teenage years
[42:19] i remember when they would do the
[42:20] conventions in guadalajara
[42:23] phoenix
[42:24] university i would see the ministry of
[42:25] phoenix and silver city
[42:28] many ministries
[42:33] [Music]
[42:45] [Music]
[42:55] during that time
[43:11] i can say that we were part of that that
[43:13] seed that was planted back then
[43:18] how god raised up a man
[43:22] and did a great impact in our lives
[43:49] during our teenage years
[43:51] that impacted our lives
[43:57] every time a brother thomas palestinian
[43:58] would go tommy junior would accompany
[44:00] him
[44:02] brother jimmy and sometimes
[44:06] our
[44:35] maybe you're a lot more familiar than i
[44:36] am
[44:40] when you preach the atomic bomb of god
[44:47] they caused a revolution
[45:00] preaching on inheritance
[45:16] but the way
[45:29] to know our brother caleb
[46:12] for standing
[46:37] at that time he was still in silver city
[46:52] that should be the name of the lord
[47:08] this i asked if you would stand to your
[47:10] feet
[47:14] let us read the scriptures
[47:34] the word of god reads
[47:51] said jesus unto his disciples if any man
[47:53] will come after me let him deny himself
[47:56] and take up his cross and follow me
[48:08] for whosoever will save his life shall
[48:10] lose it and whosoever will lose his life
[48:12] for my sake shall find it
[48:25] for what is a man profited if he shall
[48:28] gain the whole world and lose his own
[48:30] soul or what shall a man give in
[48:32] exchange for his soul
[48:36] brothers
[48:39] close your eyes
[48:41] let us pray to god this morning
[48:44] beloved heavenly father
[49:03] thank you lord for giving us the
[49:04] opportunity
[49:06] to
[49:06] speak a little bit on my word
[49:12] now that you would take complete supreme
[49:13] control of our lips
[49:16] and also our ears
[49:19] i also asked for my interpreter
[49:23] bless him while he speaks
[49:27] so the people can hear in their own
[49:28] language
[49:31] and they can also be blessed
[49:35] to you will be the honor of the glory
[49:37] after the service
[49:39] thank you for all your blessings
[49:41] we love you
[49:42] mr
[49:54] this morning i have a small thought uh
[49:56] this
[49:58] i was inspired
[50:01] [Music]
[50:03] i was hearing a tape or brother a
[50:04] brother bernie garcia
[50:08] and from there i got to start
[50:22] the word controversial comes from the
[50:23] word controversy
[50:38] there's a problem about something
[50:41] then we can say when a person
[50:43] controversial than a controversial
[50:45] person
[50:49] someone that provokes a debate
[50:57] [Music]
[51:20] automatically is converted
[51:23] they're made into a controversial person
[51:31] because the religious system we have
[51:32] today on the earth
[51:34] it has its
[51:48] everything
[52:03] they think that they're successful in a
[52:04] way organization they're organizations
[52:08] the way that they function
[52:11] by the grace of god
[52:14] the prophet is not that way
[52:29] or an agreement with them
[52:42] because at this time we believe that the
[52:43] holy ghost is
[52:55] for many people it causes problems
[53:09] where are you from how do you identify
[53:10] yourself
[53:12] i'm a christian you say
[53:22] automatically that creates controversy
[53:24] is
[53:36] an image of how the religious world
[53:38] should act
[53:40] when you identify
[54:21] because it wasn't given to them
[54:34] we go against the current of the
[54:36] religious realm by the grace of god
[54:41] he has permitted us to know the gospel
[54:44] in a supernatural way
[54:50] that
[55:19] the rain was not known at that time it
[55:21] wouldn't rain
[55:26] how is it that your message says we're
[55:28] going to die by a flood
[55:30] there's going to be a great flood
[56:00] we're
[56:11] even when the lord jesus christ was here
[56:14] he had
[56:28] the god of
[56:42] because they went against
[57:24] the
[57:38] it was a controversial
[58:34] that accepts the
[59:00] if anyone wants to follow me
[59:15] now that's controversial brother
[59:30] what are the conditions
[1:00:03] and if i'm a young person to have my own
[1:00:05] cell phone
[1:00:06] car my own car
[1:00:08] those are my rights
[1:00:11] i'll leave that there
[1:00:39] to serve the lord
[1:01:09] yeah why do you dress this way or do you
[1:01:10] have very big muscles maybe or yes
[1:01:14] oh that closes features so you can show
[1:01:16] off your fingers
[1:01:17] oh you're you're back
[1:01:30] the one that tells you more is the
[1:01:31] mirror
[1:02:18] it is
[1:03:00] given you to kill responsibility your
[1:03:03] responsibility
[1:03:04] take your cross
[1:03:11] take it with you
[1:03:12] establishment you deny yourself why
[1:03:41] against the current
[1:03:56] at work
[1:04:24] we'll lose it
[1:04:28] and whosoever will lose his life for
[1:04:30] myself shall find it
[1:04:34] this causes more controversy
[1:04:37] all the world wants to save their life
[1:04:39] what do you mean we're going to lose it
[1:04:44] i want to save my own life
[1:04:46] but if i want to save it
[1:04:48] it says i'm going to lose it
[1:04:52] but if you lose
[1:05:17] and he speaks on a character in the
[1:05:18] message of leadership
[1:05:34] going out
[1:05:38] and he he came and he
[1:05:40] bounced off to the lord
[1:05:44] he says good master he tells him
[1:05:48] what shall i do to inherit eternal life
[1:05:51] watch what he asks him
[1:05:54] good master
[1:05:56] what shall i do to inherit eternal life
[1:06:00] jesus is the man that's that's bowed
[1:06:02] down for him
[1:06:44] good master master
[1:06:47] all these things
[1:06:49] all these things i have done
[1:06:51] since i was a young man
[1:06:57] he was a man that knew the
[1:06:58] word he was a special man
[1:07:05] jesus
[1:07:06] looking at him he said jesus loved him
[1:07:08] says
[1:07:10] well
[1:07:41] tells him he said okay it's okay
[1:07:49] so all that you have
[1:07:51] give it to the poor
[1:07:54] and you have the treasure in heaven
[1:07:58] come and follow me commando
[1:08:00] taking up your cross
[1:08:03] the scripture says
[1:08:07] that he went away very afflicted or sad
[1:08:09] because of these words
[1:08:12] because he had much possessions
[1:08:17] it catches my attention the qualities
[1:08:18] and the characteristics of this man
[1:08:21] a tremendous man since his youth special
[1:08:24] very special
[1:08:27] principal he was a principal a prince or
[1:08:30] a
[1:08:31] like an important person
[1:08:35] and this time we could say maybe
[1:08:50] a certain ruler
[1:09:04] reputation
[1:09:18] with knowledge of the scripture
[1:09:22] educated in the word of god and obedient
[1:09:28] but one thing that he lacked he didn't
[1:09:30] have nothing
[1:09:31] he did not have eternal life all these
[1:09:34] qualities
[1:09:37] maybe each one of us would have said
[1:09:38] with those qualities
[1:09:43] look at the way he the way he uh
[1:09:45] uh the way he is
[1:10:00] is a
[1:10:15] the prophet tells us in the message
[1:10:16] leadership
[1:10:19] that this young this uh the rich ruler
[1:10:25] yes it's the one with that that's that's
[1:10:27] with a rich man and with lazarus
[1:10:42] every day
[1:11:11] was just poor it's not unfair he was
[1:11:13] sick
[1:11:16] he said he had boils all over his body
[1:11:21] he said the scripture says that even the
[1:11:23] dogs would come
[1:11:24] in
[1:11:38] with much influence you know yeah and
[1:11:40] another one over here
[1:11:43] like like a like a wanderer
[1:11:47] sick
[1:11:49] or in our sight or eyes
[1:11:52] so look at this poor man
[1:11:54] and look at this great man over here
[1:11:56] man
[1:12:02] it was controversial
[1:12:05] the scripture says that this man died
[1:12:14] the prophet says that this this person
[1:12:15] this rich man
[1:12:19] what am i going to do
[1:12:33] i'm going to put all these things into
[1:12:35] the storehouses
[1:12:40] and when i live all these years i could
[1:12:42] say
[1:12:44] oh just for your soul rest rejoice
[1:12:48] i have much goods
[1:13:01] what are they going to do with all
[1:13:02] you've accumulated
[1:13:04] the prophet says
[1:13:09] this man was the same man with the rich
[1:13:11] man in lazarus
[1:13:15] when he was in
[1:13:16] hell he was being tormented
[1:13:20] and he got to see
[1:13:22] allah he got to see lazarus who is
[1:13:24] hermano
[1:13:28] you you don't think it's just a parable
[1:13:30] if you
[1:13:58] abraham
[1:14:00] being refreshed
[1:14:08] he was a son of abraham
[1:14:11] a tremendous man brother
[1:16:04] certain
[1:16:19] just to put an example
[1:16:26] when a person has a genuine encounter
[1:16:28] with the lord
[1:16:32] your life changes completely
[1:16:37] intellectual but when you have an
[1:16:38] intellectual encounter
[1:16:42] it also that also has its fruits
[1:16:47] and you yourself are going to identify
[1:16:48] with those fruits
[1:16:52] mental conception intellectually
[1:16:56] maybe you're not going to say it
[1:16:59] but you're going to feel it
[1:17:11] why because you want to be better than
[1:17:12] someone else
[1:17:41] he's not humble
[1:17:57] elevated person
[1:18:00] of a formal person
[1:18:05] so so formal and so so
[1:18:10] he thinks that no one can teach him
[1:18:13] maybe he doesn't say it
[1:18:16] but when whoever extends up behind the
[1:18:17] pulpit
[1:18:20] what is the brother gonna teach me today
[1:18:41] there's people that get irritated very
[1:18:42] quickly
[1:18:45] you can't tell him anything
[1:18:48] because he's it's not his fault
[1:18:52] always
[1:19:21] they're not a mass nothing else
[1:19:23] the grace of god
[1:19:28] he has a tendency to to care for others
[1:19:32] he celebrates
[1:19:35] it's allegra and he he's joyful
[1:19:39] when somebody achieves something
[1:19:47] this person is a
[1:19:48] servant
[1:19:50] he's humble
[1:19:52] and he's ready
[1:19:55] he's ready to learn from everyone
[1:19:59] [Applause]
[1:20:02] a genuine
[1:20:44] the scripture
[1:20:58] uh
[1:21:12] is
[1:22:49] there's no juvenile delinquency
[1:23:04] father delinquency
[1:23:17] because that puts it on us yes
[1:23:32] what is my position what is my position
[1:23:36] if you're a housewife
[1:23:39] god has called you but
[1:23:41] you help your family
[1:23:44] you put your stand before your husband
[1:23:45] great
[1:23:46] take care
[1:23:58] that's your position
[1:24:14] is
[1:24:59] to try to get everyone in
[1:25:02] everyone that i can get i'm trying to
[1:25:03] get them in
[1:25:08] this life
[1:25:10] you only have a short
[1:26:18] we're people that cause problems
[1:26:36] he's had so many sayings
[1:26:40] that they had a much significance in my
[1:26:42] language
[1:26:45] one of the things that he would say
[1:26:47] it's better
[1:27:02] so that's why my notes
[1:27:07] every time someone speaks that way
[1:27:10] it's by experience
[1:27:12] the experience of god has given them
[1:27:14] with this all close brothers
[1:27:44] yes
[1:27:46] and these messengers
[1:27:48] and they all had a purpose

[1:32:24] brothers
[1:32:52] the same thing jesus said it is finished
[1:32:57] it is finished
[1:32:58] it's done what does he say that's what
[1:33:00] it says
[1:33:01] the voice
[1:33:03] of the days of the voice
[1:33:05] of the seventh angel and that convincing

[2:03:48] verse 21 and when eight days were
[2:03:50] accomplished for the circumcising of the
[2:03:52] child
[2:03:53] his name was called
[2:03:54] jesus which was so named to the angel
[2:03:57] before he was conceived in the womb
[2:04:00] and when the days of her purification
[2:04:01] according to the law of moses were
[2:04:03] accomplished they brought him to
[2:04:05] jerusalem

[2:04:16] as they put him into
[2:04:18] when jesus was here they would put him
[2:04:20] these children into his arms
[2:04:25] jesus the lord had given
[2:04:27] the life of these babies
[2:04:31] now the parents were coming back to
[2:04:33] give the life of the baby back
[2:04:35] to jesus
[2:04:39] when they come back with their baby and
[2:04:41] they say thank you lord for the life of
[2:04:43] my child
[2:04:47] i want their life to be a blessing
[2:04:52] granted as we pray for little

[2:08:20] privilege to be in the house of the lord
[2:08:21] this morning
[2:08:25] and now we're
[2:08:27] to that
[2:08:30] particular time
[2:08:36] sharon and brother marcos
[2:08:38] marcos i'm going to ask you to come
[2:08:47] we don't do things like we do in like
[2:08:49] they do in the world
[2:08:52] we uh we don't we we don't date
[2:08:55] ah no
[2:08:59] we uh record
[2:09:02] and that
[2:09:30] so
[2:09:40] a while back as our pastor was was doing
[2:09:42] a
[2:09:44] presentation or or 25-year something
[2:09:47] something of that nature
[2:09:52] or just an anniversary
[2:09:54] by by uh brother titus
[2:09:58] and
[2:10:02] it was something that was so
[2:10:04] so outstanding to me
[2:10:07] and she says i prayed for you before i
[2:10:11] even knew you
[2:10:19] and so we we are trusting in the lord
[2:10:21] today
[2:10:23] the book of colossians tells us
[2:10:27] that their hearts might be comforted
[2:10:30] being knit together in love
[2:10:37] and unto all riches of the full
[2:10:39] assurance of understanding
[2:10:50] and of the father and of christ
[2:10:54] in whom are here all the treasures of
[2:10:56] wisdom and knowledge
[2:11:01] as ye have therefore received christ
[2:11:04] jesus the lord
[2:11:07] so walking in him asian
[2:11:10] rooted and built up in him and
[2:11:14] and established in the faith
[2:11:17] as ye have been taught
[2:11:20] abounding therein with thanksgiving
[2:11:25] the prophet of god
[2:11:27] told us this
[2:11:30] now the church now is engaged to christ
[2:11:33] for the wedding
[2:11:36] the wedding has never been performed yet
[2:11:41] it will be at the wedding supper of the
[2:11:42] lamb
[2:11:44] so we see that the church is now engaged
[2:11:50] like a man engaged to his wife
[2:11:55] what does he do while they're engaged
[2:11:59] he's just bestowing all kinds of things
[2:12:04] sending her presents
[2:12:06] making her feel good
[2:12:09] well that's what christ is doing to his
[2:12:11] church
[2:12:14] he's sending us gifts
[2:12:16] of the spirit
[2:12:19] how can we you be engaged engaged
[2:12:23] then when you're denying these gifts
[2:12:25] exist
[2:12:29] it's the very love tokens
[2:12:33] it's god's token to the church
[2:12:38] jesus said these signs shall follow them
[2:12:40] that belief
[2:12:44] so we're grateful
[2:12:59] my grandmother would say my grandmother
[2:13:01] would say
[2:13:05] every part has its own lid
[2:13:08] so we're grateful to the lord for that
[2:13:13] happy i pray that that the lord will
[2:13:15] give you what me and my wife have
[2:13:18] experienced
[2:13:23] we will celebrate 38 years this year
