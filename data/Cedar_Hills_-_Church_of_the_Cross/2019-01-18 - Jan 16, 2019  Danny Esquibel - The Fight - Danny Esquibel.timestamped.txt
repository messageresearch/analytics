[28:06] says be yes to Haggai and you know they
[28:11] a hill chapter 1 verse 3 capital uno ver
[28:21] so trace then the word of the Lord by
[28:25] Haggai then came the word of the Lord by
[28:28] haggai the prophet saying entonces vino
[28:31] palabra show up for middle Profeta
[28:33] a hail diciendo is it time for you O ye
[28:36] to dwell in your health filled houses
[28:39] and this house like waste a Sparrow's
[28:43] tiempo para nosotros the avatar in which
[28:46] discusses artists honest yes the
[28:49] caster's yes
[28:50] now therefore thus saith the Lord of
[28:53] hosts which is here Leto here what they
[28:55] lost ejército
[28:56] consider your ways may that be in a
[28:59] manners will be seated she bones to
[29:02] Mecca siento and we read on verse 6
[29:05] believe myself say ye have so much and
[29:08] bring in little
[29:10] samurai's mucho the Kohei spoken ye eat

[29:41] of Hosts I see at each other like a
[29:43] hairy toes consider your ways may that's
[29:46] all there is just caminos so we find out
[29:48] here the most quaint a key that Haggai
[29:50] yeah a hail we just heard that the word
[29:52] of the Lord came to the prophet a man a
[29:54] couple of and you'll be nonprofit oh we
[29:57] want to remember that get a more record
[29:59] that is because the word the Lord comes
[30:01] to the prophet but Killip allowed us
[30:02] you're bein a prophet that he doesn't
[30:04] come to the preacher no you know take a
[30:06] look you don't come to the teacher who
[30:07] you know nice he comes to the Prophet
[30:10] being a prophet the Bible says that we
[30:12] let me say that the Lord Himself kills
[30:14] in your amusement will do nothing more
[30:16] than that except he reveal it to his
[30:18] servants the prophets
[30:20] primero so sheer blows profit so we find
[30:22] out here knows almost quaint a key the
[30:24] condition of the people here la
[30:26] condición de la gente key and in my
[30:28] Bible you evilly it's got some
[30:30] commentaries in a gross commentary
[30:32] second and it says hey guys purpose is
[30:34] clear
[30:34] they say a kegel el propósito a huge
[30:37] stava Claro the exiles who returned to
[30:39] Jerusalem after their captivity go
[30:42] succeed on TV that in Babylonia in
[30:46] Babylonia have failed to complete the
[30:48] temple IBM Fidel and completed a temple
[30:51] Haggai calls these citizens to
[30:53] repentance into action
[30:54] I killed your boys you almost have a
[30:56] Pentimento yes so they found themselves
[30:58] that they were come out of slavery
[31:00] saying paternal Carians a little less
[31:02] clever dude and they began to start off
[31:04] with a great fire Iike Monsanto corn
[31:06] gram flagel they were gonna rebuild the
[31:09] temple even under the conspirators and
[31:11] they started out with a great fire eco
[31:13] means a new : girls wiggle and then
[31:15] little with a little fizzle yeah it
[31:17] gonna picking your feast oh that happens
[31:19] to us a lot of times right by some motel
[31:21] business let me start out the new year
[31:24] go my son was annoying wine yeah we're
[31:25] on sighs yes tumbles in putting while
[31:27] I'm gonna do this more I wasn't a boy
[31:29] yeah I never start
[31:30] to do this better welcome in Sarah's
[31:32] head his tummy hole we start out with a
[31:33] real big fire coming someone's come
[31:35] grams Fraggle and all of a sudden it
[31:37] turns into a fizzle he their punter they
[31:41] would be on pequeña feast on and in the
[31:43] commentary it says in the commentary
[31:45] releasing the profit highlights a
[31:47] Profeta
[31:47] lamarka the indifference of the people
[31:50] in differential hinting citing the
[31:54] return deck exiles in Australia's
[31:57] recreational sex yellow and their fellow
[31:59] countrymen is compañeros de la Fiera for
[32:03] putting their own interests ahead of the
[32:06] Lord and the temple or corners who
[32:08] protein that is and discussing your
[32:10] temple the Bible says the viennese know
[32:13] ye not no no survey that ye are the
[32:16] Temple of the Lord give also 2000 temple
[32:18] tenure so what temple are we building
[32:21] for Hills is get them placed on mostly
[32:23] if you can't operate many times we put
[32:25] our own interests Mucha bases prominence
[32:28] appropriate interests before the Lord's
[32:30] interest antecedent in Europe that's why
[32:32] the Prophet says what is the profit
[32:34] aleikum consider your ways consider two
[32:38] Caminos many times muchas veces we give
