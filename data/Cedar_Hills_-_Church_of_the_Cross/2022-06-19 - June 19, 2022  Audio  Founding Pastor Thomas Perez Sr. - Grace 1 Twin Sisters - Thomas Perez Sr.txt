========================================

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen good morning buenos dias it's certainly good to be in the house of the lord this morning welcome each one that is with us this morning and we pray that you feel at home in the house of the lord we are grateful to god for all that he has done for us and truly it is amazing grace gracia for the last weeks or so my thought has been the grace of god and last wednesday miraculous pasado i was going to start teaching on the grace of god and i was a little troubled wednesday a lot of hassle and been moving and what have you trying to find a home and what have you done and that wednesday was when brother alex burunda came to my home in the evening now i had told certain people in this church that i was going to preach on the grace of god because i knew and i know that it's a holy spirit leading yo when you can have that kind of fellowship and the other one doesn't know from the other by lip what you're going to do and leave it to the holy spirit what a grand thing it is i like to there there is no possible way ninguna manera posible that i can finish and maybe when i say i finished i pray that i could just at least open up a little bit of what grace is and i'm going to restrict myself restriction and mimism it's almost 10 30. i'm going to restrict myself to an hour and 15 minutes and i'd like to maybe wednesday continue this thought i'd like for you to open your bibles with me to the prophet zechariah chapter four to you that don't know how to handle your bible very good zechariah second to the last book of the old testament before the gospel of saint matthew yes that's the book of zechariah now in zechariah 4 zacharias cuatro and verse 6 versiclos says we're going to read six and seven says amen if you have it say amen then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the lord unto zero babel saying not by might zechariah 4 6 not by might nor by power but my but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who art thou o great mountain before zerubbabel thou shall become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it now turn in your bibles to the book of revelation chapter 12 apocalypses and we'll read verse 1 and there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars there was a time when this third minister met this man down the street and he asked him the question do you know grace gracia and of course if somebody would know would say it on here i said would you know grace i said i know gracie matthew but that's not the grace we're speaking about he said grace who gracia he said the grace of god i believe creo that the message of grace is one of the most misunderstood messages in the world the people have taken grace and have made a disgrace out of it and in grace in la gracia you find and we find schools of thought and control escuelas de pensamiento you hear people speak in like manner and they say i'm saved by grace this is so established too many people to do anything they want to but i i have a picture of the great mountain which is in the form of a pyramid we find that the top part of it is the headstone and the prophet of god teaches us he says that grace and love are twin sisters this is there was a song when i was growing up it went something like this love and marriage go together like a horse and carriage you can have one without the other one so love elamor and grace amen amen so then uh i believe when we we speak about the grace it's quite a context let me define to you first because i do not want to run through this message and i want to teach it now we know that teaching positions the church whatever i can teach you the word grace means mercy or cl and clemency the unmerited love amor sin mercer and favor if a war of god the diors toward man to honor to dignify in other words if we have his grace we have the unmerited love and favor of god that's why sometimes they call them reverend or sirs is this the time or the lady the chosen or the elected lady called the woman she's called a lady because she's honored she is dignified god has found favor in her eyes it's unmerited means that there's nothing you can do so if you stop right there sit at the gym you can go home and say praise god there's nothing i can do i'm gonna sit back i'm gonna relax but this is love foreign and they're twin sisters amen amen so then says let us come down to the bottom and let's talk vamos let us not try to put an act there are days ideas when we feel discouraged uh the amen and the reason for it is because we read the word when you take these books and you take the bible and you read it it makes you rejoice at times and there are times when we read the bible and we read the spoken word it won't make us rejoice but there are times when we are reading a book or hearing a table that we want to turn it off right away and the reason for it because it's heavy there are things there is that we are doing wrong and it hits us nos vega and when you get up you might take a little walk on the pocono that's why people are very nervous i i wonder i wonder sometimes what makes us so nervous we sometimes can't we're at home and it's the same thing all over again it's because i'll go hey there there's something bothering them so they make a joke out of it and that's that's that's fine but but what we're trying to get to i'm trying to help you locate your problem under the message of grace we feel discouraged but we are not fulfilling that we are very ungrateful uh and to what we have received we do not appreciate no we walk sometimes thinking we are any people don't worship the way i worship so who it's to pretend to be something that we're not it's a fraud pretense and the church in general has gone into what is called a sham of what the word of god has for us go to church iglesia to soothe a conscience but they will never let their conscience show them. there comes a time when a you don't need for nobody to tell you when you're doing wrong god is greater than your conscience god is in his word so you pick up the bible you pick up a book you begin to read that's greater than your conscience is yourself it is amen and uh we hear people praise god there's nothing i can do god did it all for me that's right pero [Music] will have your life sanctified typical grace gracia we'll show you how to do it that's his grace if you did something wrong and nobody ever told you you did wrong you never knew you did nothing wrong that's because nobody loved you especially the children that do wrong hyacinth amen feeling discouraged it's good to feel discouraged it's good to feel uneasy it's good to have tension because if you didn't have any tension in life everything would be all right amen amen at times our bases we don't know what we have no look tenemos we really don't know what we have no s and people say well everything's all right and i hope you can put on your seat belts this morning because it's it's something winning how many like to jump and shout out but a lot of times muchas versus we jump and shout drink louder and higher than we live we go into what is called you can have a person come to church jump and shout okay because the people that don't like to jump and shout out we'll use this leverage and the people that like to jump and shout out we'll go to the other side so then when we are in church and the spirit of god descends everybody feels it then [Applause] is well i want to have his presence let me quote to you the prophet he says when the spirit of god comes down does not make you shout out uh so then one thing una cosa is to feel his presence and the other thing is to have his presence in his presence when you have his presence let you have been dignified you you have his favor not that you married it but that he gave it to you you know what happens when god does that to you it humbles you you mia it humbles you to a to a place that you know that it's not because i did this for that now probably on the remark that i just made in and when everybody's coming this way and you have to turn and go this way it gets too hard and the church i understand that i okay and you use this can know this bible from cover to cover i can know these spoken word books from cover to cover and because i know them i am not safe because my father was a preacher i am not safe because i was raised in a christian home the world corinthians we go along this message is going to get a little deeper and a little deeper we're burning placing the soul our feet on in on the river and then we'll go to the shoulders and then we will pass the river that you have to swim so you follow me if you want to understand a little bit about the grace of god it says though i speak with the tongues of man and of angels and have not charity i am become a sounding breath or a tinkling symbol you see if you speak with tongues that's fine nothing wrong against speaking in terms of language but you can speak in tongues and and you can uh you can speak with the tongues of man and of angels but you don't have love you're nothing no es nada that's the bible now watch verse 2. though i have the gift of prophecy is you know i can have the gift of prophecy let me let me interpret that for you or try to open that up a little bit for you prophecy is not just a man that brings prophecy to the church we all should prophesy prophecy is to preach the word also and a woman can preach and though we can have a tongue or a gap you know how people have a lot of gap yet i know some woman that cannot preach any man but why don't they do it because they have an understanding amen amen but though i have the gift of prophecy and i can understand all mysteries mysterious you enumerate the mysteries in the bible and the the major the greatest mysteries are 11 of them you find them in uh sirs is this the time so it tells me here that i i can understand all mysteries and all knowledge i can prophesy i can do all these things i can teach you seven thunders whatever is revealed of them i can teach you about a little bit about the seven seals the six seals one more i'm nothing yet that's the bible so then it puts me on the alert that i am not saved because i know this i am i know that satan can even take the gift and impersonate it amen satan can take that but there's one thing he cannot impersonate the word of god that's why paul said i die daily we speak hablamos about repentance and people say well praise god i i repented a long time ago oh for thoughts that come to our mind sometimes we we we are as christians we begin to think bad about somebody else and we forget to repent about them then we wonder why instead of going forward sliding back but you come across a message and the message says and told everywhere i won't say the rest on that until later now when we believe the first thing that we must do is to believe god is clear how how many believe everything god said raise your hand now put them down thank you gracias i want me yo sometimes i find myself obviously that i think i believe but i don't know i might go to your home and pretend to you that i believe everything you pretend there are some things in the world you say you foreign when said this god said that the question that's why you find people will get baptized we'll follow god after a while they don't want to do it anymore it's not because they believe god [Music] you might think that because you do this in church that you are doing the right thing no we're not no that god wants you doing this but if you don't know it the devil will entertain you right here because he can impersonate any gift card this world is what is called satan's iden do you know that this world now belongs to him do you know that you and i are intruders right now or squatters do you know that this is his son do you know that he gained it by beating god's son so then it's his interest he controls all this el control so then we were all his property you were his property the the redemptive de gracia when you let let me let me emphasize that a little bit emphasis you you and i if you understand correctly you and i you you see somebody that doesn't know the lord coming down the street that has been taken over and controlled by by a power there that's why jesus christ said this christo render to caesar what's caesar's says no he'll tell you it's mine it is saint said if you bow to me i will give you all this. jesus christ says he says he knew el sabia that he was coming in power and then later this pues he was going to going to inherit it you go out of the doors of your home [Applause] you have [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] let's [Music] but let me walk out without my contract all hell breaks loose but we never like to take the woman with us grace let me stay here it's only the grace of god that keeps us whole it's only his grace it's only the grace of god that keeps us from the world how many of you ever have felt like you're going insane even in sanos i have you'll see not one time no no no many times [Applause] when we think sometimes we are oh sometimes we think we really got the world in our hands oh we're some big mighty people that you know we are the best amen amen amen now grace gracia you cannot buy it no you can't buy it you can't sell it you cannot give it to anybody to whom god wisheth to reveal himself is not how much we know it's not how much we understand if you feel different that's you yes but let me the reason i say that how many watch my questions there are easy questions how many of you questions have at one time or another done something in your life that you feel that there's no more redemption for you raise let me ask you a question now why are you here in church then iglesia if there be no redemption for you you would never come back to hear the word of god but the reason or the the means that you are back in church is because somewhere along the line for el camino you have you have amazing grace has come your way amen let me tell you a little story and then i'm going to say this story then i'm going to read a couple of scriptures then i'm going to relate something else and then i'm going to stop i'm just foundation this morning how many of you have really really read the prodigal you better read it if you haven't read it how many of you don't know believe creation that the prodigal son was the sinner where some of you aren't being sincere and i've been preaching for almost 21 years it's only been a month brother perez yes sir i'm sincere let me tell you something about the prodigal son was yes son equal of the father the father he left his father's state the let me ask you a question how many of you have left at one time or another your father's statement is well he belonged to the father but he went where and misused everything he had malu i can get what is all the fathers and fine here and contrary to misuse what he gave me and i can justify myself i have misused everything on my father and then i find myself going down now before i say the other i want to read a scripture for you that's found in the book of the galatians chapter 3. i want you carefully in it and pay attention now hey i want you to know this paul speaking here to the galatians oh foolish galatians oh galatase incense if i could say this i could i could put it this way oh english it's bewitched and bruh bewitched that you should not obey the truth why does it say that do you mean that those people didn't go to church anymore didn't hear the word of god anymore yes sir but they began to turn away from the truth can you hear something else over here and before you know it you will say well i don't have to do that you're talking about this i don't have to do that well i can do a little bit of this i can do a little bit of this who has been with you obey the truth all those they have separated themselves from the truth because all there are truths jesus christ whom shall you don't understand the message of the house they've crucified him again how do they crucify him they crucified the effect of the world because then it comes to where the word has why don't people see forget about it let's be watched to you what is because you find people today and then i'm going to show you why i want to go into a scripture i'm going to read something i'll go and i want to stop because i've only got about 20 minutes watch this amen watch verse 2 this is this only would i learn of you receive you the spirit by the works of the lord or by the hearing of faith how did you receive the spirit they like drums piano organ trumpets guitars you name it a lot of noise there are some iotros that don't like it some resent coming to a church that they they should just have piano in the organ well to me it has a balance a lot of people will feel god when the spirit of christ comes down it's different now i believe in showering well if you get me wrong well there's nothing i can do to my here we find do nothing you don't have to do nothing you know why i was saved because he loved me well then brother perez why do you work so much why do you go and preach here and there with people because let me tell you something when i married my wife because i called my esposa i didn't marry her because she was a good cook i didn't marry her because she was a good homemaker even if she burned my beans see mom it's ricoles i still loved her simple no matter what she did i loved her that's the way christ is christopher with his church iglesia so then it's not i do this it's because i love him and if i love him i don't want to do nothing else i just want to please him now if i want to please him we got to find out how to please him a lot of homes would just discuss us i want you married couples to listen to you a lot of homes the problems that you have in your home you know how a woman places a husband by doing what her husband likes if her husband likes the potatoes just barely without whether you like it or not eat them or don't need them i'll tell that woman foolish woman they don't know how to please her husband how does the word of god i mean why don't you obey the word of god well i see him all day long you meet him at the door you're foolish [Music] waiting for her to the what is missing in your life i cannot excite myself the way i could 10 15 years ago yes you see jody the way he is i was twice that the ministry called me the fireball preacher [Music] [Music] jesus comes three times jesus i know the bible speaks about you but actually it speaks about three actually but one of them is hidden first primeramente but in between the first and the third he comes to take away his bride prophet of god calls it the secret coming of the lord it's called it's in the second coming now it's a secret coming yes and here yaki is where grace on de la gracia must really be with you grace gracia we'll give you the secret grace gracia will permit you to be in this cigarette the message is in three and i'll continue wednesday that in 1963 when the seals were opened began the half hour of silence i believe that somebody don't believe that that's fine i will fight with no man amen but i believe according to the bible then when the seventh sail was opened there was silence obviously in the space of half an hour many many preachers muchos predicadores have tried to calculate or figure out how many years was that half hour of silence taken it by 360 days of bible prophecy to a year or and it seems like nothing happened in 77 but he said in another scripture we are 17 years off so if you would take 1977 to that roman calendar but you take half hour old to believe one thing that god said you got to believe all he said why i say it do you believe god then you say lord help my unbelief foreign let me i got four minutes let me read this half hour media let me tell you some of the calculations that they've given me some have said 21 years some have told me 23 years old and so on and so on either neither whatever it is they're wrong they're wrong already just in mind all right but the calculations can be right i know this there's something here jose now this message of gray is going to take us a little deeper so if you don't want to hear this kind of teachings don't come to church when i preach this grace that's revelation 1. don't open your bible you should lead by memory but it says this he says when he opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven never said silence on the earth uh let me say something there are people in heaven that must come down in order for us to know the voice of archangel we will is shall bring foreign is romans 10 romano the year sex saves but the righteousness which is a faith speaketh on his wife this year say not in thine heart shall ascend into heaven to bring christ down from above somebody had to die so that he could go not jesus christ oh [Music]
