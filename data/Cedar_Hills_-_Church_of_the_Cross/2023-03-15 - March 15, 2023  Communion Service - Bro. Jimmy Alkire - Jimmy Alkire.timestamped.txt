[17:02] for you and me
[17:05] you're so kind let's open our Bibles to
[17:08] the 14th chapter of Genesis
[17:16] starting with verse 14.
[17:20] amen
[17:24] foreign
[17:28] and we're going to entitle this
[17:30] Abraham's
[17:32] Faithful Men amen
[17:39] and when Abram heard that his brother
[17:42] was taken captive he armed his trained
[17:46] servants
[17:47] born in his house
[17:50] 318 and pursued them until then
[18:02] and he divided himself against them and
[18:05] he and his servants by right and smote
[18:07] them and pursued them to Oba which is on
[18:11] the left a hand of Damascus
[18:21] and he brought back all the goods and
[18:24] brought again his brother-in-law and his
[18:27] goods and the women also and the people
[18:32] [Music]
[18:37] and the king of Sodom went out to meet
[18:39] him after his return from the slaughter
[18:41] of lomer
[18:44] and the kings that were with him at the
[18:48] valley of Shaving which is the King's
[18:51] Dale
[18:52] when the world
[19:03] and Melchizedek of Salem brought forth
[19:07] Bread and Wine
[19:09] and he was the priest of the most high
[19:12] God
[19:18] and blessed him and said Blessed Be
[19:21] Abraham of the most high god possessor
[19:23] of Heaven and Earth is
[19:30] and blessed be the most high God whom
[19:33] which have delivered thine enemies into
[19:36] thy hand and he gave him ties of all
[19:41] Amigos
[19:45] and let us pray
[19:48] we just thank you Lord for this portion
[19:50] of your word Lord
[19:54] and we see faithful Abram Abram here
[20:00] we know our Prophet when he speaks of
[20:03] this he he calls it him Abraham
[20:09] yes when his name was already changed
[20:12] when here his name was Abram
[20:17] but the prophet was seeing the final
[20:20] product of what Abraham
[20:25] we thank you now Lord Jesus for your
[20:28] words
[20:29] in the precious name of our Lord and
[20:31] Savior Jesus Christ
[20:34] amen you may be seated
[20:37] and uh
[20:39] if you could go ahead and give me that
[20:41] first quote up there
[20:46] I'll read it here you'll have it up on
[20:49] yeah they've got it up here
[20:53] we are in a battle now
[20:56] how many believe we are in a battle
[20:59] we're after our fallen brother
[21:04] how many are after your Fallen Brothers
[21:08] how many when you see a brother or
[21:10] sister struggling and maybe they seem
[21:12] like they're lagging behind us
[21:17] yeah your heart goes out to them
[21:21] you know this is the Simplicity and what
[21:25] the message says
[21:28] and this is what I have tonight
[21:31] because notice until
[21:33] Abraham
[21:35] he he he just he didn't need to be bad
[21:40] to go to battle
[21:42] he didn't need an invitation to go to
[21:45] battle
[21:46] as soon as he heard that his brother had
[21:50] been taken prisoners
[22:17] the children
[22:20] you know I believe that please the Lord
[22:23] so much
[22:27] that he decided to come down and serve
[22:30] communion
[22:35] it moved the heart of God
[22:38] to see his elect man Abraham
[22:44] didn't need a big Revelation
[22:46] Revelation they need to be persuaded
[22:51] how many of us need to be persuaded
[22:53] sometimes to do something for somebody
[22:58] or if we don't get invited we're not
[23:01] going to go you know
[23:05] estacita
[23:29] we're after our fallen brother
[23:33] that God before the foundation of the
[23:36] world
[23:38] son predestinated unto eternal life
[23:42] and the things that the world has got
[23:45] him caught up in a whirlwind
[23:49] and he is out in societies and classes
[23:54] him and his wife Elizabeth walking up
[23:57] and down the streets
[23:59] smoking drinking carousing um
[24:04] trying to find peace
[24:07] how many of you at one time were trying
[24:10] to find peace
[24:12] we don't come here tonight to find peace
[24:16] we come to celebrate that we have the
[24:20] peace
[24:23] that has been shed by the Holy Ghost
[24:26] and we're so thankful
[24:45] I make sure that I have my life centered
[24:49] on Christ
[24:51] but it's not my worthiness to begin with
[24:55] that's not your worthiness to begin with
[24:59] the worthiness of the spirit of God
[25:04] bleeding words
[25:09] this word is bleeding out life is
[25:14] can you believe tonight in this little
[25:17] simple thing that we're going to do
[25:22] we won't even have to pray for the sick
[25:26] and people will be healed
[25:31] people maybe have had a spirit follow
[25:33] them all their lives
[25:37] tries to make them think they're not a
[25:39] son or daughter
[25:42] when they know in their heart they're a
[25:45] son and daughter
[25:47] and as we as particular Jesus
[25:58] paragraph 69.
[26:01] and when the battle is finally ended
[26:06] we'll meet Mel kiss the dick again
[26:11] how many believe that we know that
[26:14] Melchizedek later on became Jesus Christ
[26:19] but we're not up here to teach tonight
[26:23] to stimulate your faith
[26:26] that when this battle is finally over
[26:29] when is
[26:35] bless God
[26:37] blessed Abraham
[26:40] and gave him a blessing and he give him
[26:44] Bread and Wine
[26:46] the communion when the battle is over
[26:51] we'll meet him
[26:54] my my
[26:56] I love the way the Bible in English says
[26:59] and he brought forth
[27:04] I believe personally he just created it
[27:09] don't ask Abraham foreign
[27:23] right brought forth simply produce
[27:27] praise the Lord Jesus Christ
[27:30] we just love him so much
[27:33] you know we're about to take a trip to
[27:36] Africa
[27:38] Africa and I think it's just the
[27:41] inspiration of the Holy Ghost leading
[27:43] our pastors
[27:46] and what are we going after okay
[27:54] to try to have more than somebody else
[27:58] we're after our fallen brother and
[28:02] as we do what God leads us to do
[28:07] so please our creator okay
[28:11] when the battle's over we come back
[28:15] come back with all the goods
[28:19] with all the women we come back with all
[28:22] the churches
[28:23] and maybe God will just be so beautiful
[28:28] and he'll come down
[28:31] well
[28:48] I've got
[28:49] 10 minutes left maybe you may be five
[28:52] I want to keep it bye yes
[28:56] praise the Lord Jesus Christ
[28:58] after the battle let's turn to Luke 22
[29:01] it's almost
[29:05] and we're going to read verses 11
[29:09] through 18.
[29:13] amen
[29:19] and our time will be up here
[29:32] I want you to notice if
[29:36] Jesus was so concerned
[29:42] that he wanted the special place
[29:47] to partake of the communion with his
[29:50] disciples
[29:54] verse 11 and you shall say unto the Good
[29:57] Men of the house
[29:59] the master said unto thee where is the
[30:02] gas chamber amen
[30:05] amen go ahead they say is
[30:17] where I shall eat the Passover with my
[30:22] disciples
[30:26] how many believe he's going to eat the
[30:29] Passover with you tonight
[30:32] Holy Spirit
[30:37] fellowshipping with God
[30:39] through these elements
[30:42] and he shall show you a large upper room
[30:45] furnished
[30:49] what a coincidence that it's an upper
[30:52] room
[30:55] I don't think that's a coincidence
[30:58] I just think he was making something to
[31:02] foreshadow when the Holy Spirit you will
[31:06] descend in the upper room yeah
[31:14] I believe that
[31:17] and they went and found and he had said
[31:19] unto them and they made ready the
[31:21] Passover
[31:25] and when the hour was come he sat down
[31:28] and the 12 up now he calls them apostles
[31:32] and The Twelve Apostles with him
[31:36] apostolis
[31:41] he was declaring now that they're no
[31:43] longer just going to be disciples
[31:47] because we see the discipline
[32:12] and he said unto them
[32:15] with desire I have desired to eat the
[32:19] Passover with you before I suffer
[32:24] he has such a strong desire
[32:28] he wanted a special place
[32:31] he wanted
[32:36] an upper room
[32:38] because he has
[32:42] foreign
[32:52] go ahead and give us that last quote
[32:57] in our time is gone
[33:01] amen
[33:04] yeah
[33:07] out of the message
[33:10] the communion preached in 1957 81.
[33:18] and this thing Melchizedek said
[33:21] yesterday
[33:23] I will take no more fruit of the vine
[33:26] until I drink it Anew with you in my
[33:29] father's Kingdom
[33:34] after the battle is over
[33:38] when the victory is won
[33:41] then we'll take it Anew in his kingdom
[33:45] when the last battle is
[33:48] how do we not know this is going to be
[33:51] the last battle
[33:54] when that last sword has killed the last
[33:57] evil of the world
[34:01] and the great Church of the Living God
[34:04] triumphs
[34:09] Christ will meet them in the air
[34:13] with Bread and Wine again
[34:18] and take the communion
[34:21] and for eternity
[34:23] in the presence of uh
[34:29] will he serve it again and he's going to
[34:32] provide him
[34:34] he's not going to ask us for a better
[34:36] wife
