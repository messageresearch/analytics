every one of us we're grateful to your word we're and we we want to delve right into into our topic tonight and our topic tonight is the three curtains and uh we will go right into them you that you that know what they are well we'll know exactly where where we're at in the book of joel the second chapter and the fourth verse and uh we're happy to be here with brother aaron and brother henry content henry aaron as they come to we all come to put our portion in the book of joel chapter 2 verse 4 that which the palmerworm hath left at the locust eaton and that which the locust had left at the cankerworm meeting and that which the cankerworm has left at the caterpillar heaton joelle i'm sorry i'm sorry [Music] amen so uh we're grateful to the lord for for all that that he has done for us grateful a subject matter in all of this as you're going to see it uh but do not fear and we're gonna we'll we'll end up into why we do not fear uh and so so the greatness of god and what he has done for us we're gonna go from [Music] there's many many many curtains that we're going to find out and uh we we've seen the news lately and and uh we're we're not uh we're not shy of what what is going on we see how the the it's the revival of it seems like the iron curtain and uh and and it's also looks like the bamboo curtain they're they're rattling sabers there in uh they're by taiwan they make their noises as you have heard our our pastor speaking uh i i don't know how many people have you uh uh uh have have heard the message he's spoken parallel number number you'll find out exactly what what all of this is about exactly and i do want to start off with this uh uh my my my father uh he uh he uh a great great man of god that saw further than than than the time that he lives in my father but he he said this in the met in a positive examination of a christian life part two examination and he uh it was with the subtitle the antichrist and the antichrist don't fear he says the iron curtain but fear the purple curtains and and so we're going to go into a little bit upon the threads of it the reason that i read joelle chapter 1 and verse 4 is that we're seeing what these insects have eaten and as the prophet of god says this cankerworm itself into the bark he began to and so that is what the ministry of the seventh angel was the minister of the septim was to restore back all the things that were lost if we really understand of why why god had to send brother branham the church had gotten away so far from scripture because they did not would not believe it because the catholic church believed that the bible of the catholic church but they also believe that they have the power to change scripture this was the great debate of brother branham against the these people yes is that the word of god it is unchangeable it does it is god in print forms that's a that's why there was so many other books added to scripture as in what is called the catholic bible and when we talk about tonight about catholics [Music] and that's very very important you know this is what i love about brother branham's his attitude and the way he was when they when they gave him an audience with the pope he uh he said well you're gonna walk in here then we gotta cut the cuffs off your trousers and then you gotta kneel down and kiss his finger i won't i'll call him reverend i'll call him sir but i will not kneel down to anyone except to god would have left the vatican in a huff and they would have just ran away not brother branham he had a healing service has them balanced go ahead because i won't stop it's all right keep going so uh we're living in some interesting times as we're all aware of and as we were uh studying this topic of curtains i just began to think you know real basic what is a curtain you know it's as simple as you can make it's santan it's a covering it keeps something hid so for example behind this curtain there could be a cage lion back there they said but the whole point of it is you don't know what's behind that no [Music] it's not necessarily the curtain itself is implemented la cortina it's what lies behind that and i'm so glad that we have a prophet who was a master at pulling the curtain you see this curtain called the iron curtain vest is and so real quick you know what is a curtain in the natural natural you know it dates back all the way to like i from what i read it was egyptian times but um an early civilization they would get the hides of animals animals you know i picture maybe an ox got a big high that you'd be able to cover a doorway with a quest and what it would do is it keep out the cool draft you look at it but what got me as i was just kind of looking into the history of curtains we went from a natural uh skin that came from blood and now these days we've moved on to a more modern fabric and i'm quoting this from the site it says easier to work with so people can choose just about any style they want they're easier to clean and with proper care your curtains are going to look their best for a longer time loss you know what was man trying to do after the fall he tried to go find whatever he could find to cover himself you know just a quick covering it looked good makes you look better for a little while hides all your stuff everything comes out on wash day though right and that's what this covering was yes it went from a sacrifice of blood and the reason i say that is because we know that god covered adam and eve and as civilization has moved on without growing that i'm almost uh can i see the most popular something more modern nobody wants the blood anymore and so you know that's kind of the lines i was thinking and then so i started thinking on uh you know the spiritual the piano and brother branham just to put it i'm not going to read the whole quote but he just says everyone who's born into this world he always wants to look beyond that curtain now this curtain i'm talking about now yes it's a lot like this bamboo iron and purple bamboo it's more of a i guess a metaphor esque it wouldn't i'm not talking about a literal bamboo curtain bamboo in this curtain of time behind there but in the book of revelations this generate this age that we're living in they're poor blind miserables naked so in other words even if they want to see it it's not revealed to them and so is it with this this question that so many people want answers it takes a profit and so you know it's this question came to mind you know the whole world the bible will give you the answers to those questions by the way so my question is why you know the bible's probably the number one selling book in the world then why is it that the whole world reads this bible entonces we read malachi 4 5. why is it i'm just going to talk to this crowd why is it that only we see that elijah the prophet and so as we go into these other these curtains just have that spiritual mentality and we're not really focusing on the curtain itself though we'll hit good points on that uh for i would not brethren that he should be ignorant of this mystery hermanos is romans 11 25 lest you should be wise in your own conceit that blindness in part is happening to israel until the fullness of the gentiles be coming juan every every every thing that happens the bible says there's nothing new under the sun there's things that that that it seems like they go away for a while but yet they come back and but they all have a everything and every doctrine and everything has its its origin in the book of genesis and so you can find out that all these all these things started where what what what what what's the origin many of these of these curtains and in these these things there is a god god bless everybody and right away we get the idea of what it is and then uh it was bad so well is it really bad oh it's if i ask you as an audience purple curtain what's your answer is it bad la cortina it's not no so the question is we're taught fear not estamos you're not not the mice yeah no he just read a quote quoting brothers and i fear the purple you know he said i'm going to read real quick here brother branham 1961 and i mean he's speaking today but it's 1961 because it rates like this we see we see one rising yonder in china called the bamboo curtain then we see one rice called the purple curtain does say hermano branham cdc uh form an image of the beast former unimaginable exactly exactamente you don't fear communism but he says you fear catholicism he said it would come in with flatteries like a lamb but watch it because behind us that wolf is a sneaker so you watch it yesterday and the word says it has to come to pass so there's a fear that needs to be that we need to be aware not be afraid because without really reverence or respect or reverend it could very easily one person or a church or a family or a community be led by a spirit person that uh is at a purple curtain so well so so what as we said is the purple curtain really is it that bad commodity i guess not no seems like it but as you can see we talk about it like it's a bad deal well of course it's a bad deal cs it is a deceiving thing yes it it it will take you the roman empire imperial romana every bad empire that existed couldn't do anything of themselves until they first saw the lord do something with his people so let's just go now purple is a color that sits between red and you know it leans more on the bluish side but let's go to the book of exodus 26 is that then a unifying color it is a unifying color that's the spirit of today it's inclusion everything is inclusion yeah is if we look at it is the highest form of mediocrity that once can see but it makes it look like that that's the way it is you ever want you ever want to get your congressman really really uh backpedaling just ask him what a woman [Music] go ahead so book of exodus 26 first verse versus says moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with 10 curtains of fine twine linen cortinas and blue [Music] of cunning work shall thou make them primo primo rosa look what this spirit how far back it's got to be able to get strength let's go to verse 6. well verse verse five and verse six verses so 50 loops shall i make on one curtain and 50 loop shall i make in the edge of the curtain that is in the coupling of the second see and the loops may take hold one of another cincuenta lasadas primera touches of gold and couple the curtains together with the tatches and it shall be one tabernacle [Music] no that's what we're saying about this purple curtain what he wants to do it was actually a holy thing it was it was a serious thing it was it was the makeup of the tabernacle because after you if you were to follow and i'll encourage you to go and read the instructions of the tabernacle it is tell him it tells him in the second and this book of ii samuel de secondo de samuel said that the king said unto nathan the prophet 2nd samuel 7 2 second samuel see now i dwell in a house of cedar but the ark of god dwelleth within curtains now notice that this purple curtain is really referred towards the end and from some time this way which i find it interesting that when you speak of a tabernacle um there's not a tabernacle or an expression of a tabernacle greater than jesus christ you're saying he is a curtain or seeker because that's what that's what when people become and this is where as you're hearing brother henry henry taking it from a metaphor of a natural to when the person becomes like jesus was the tenth of god we're coming right to that so this is what david says here talking to samuel eslo well along the way israel you know how israel went israel is israel then the prophet jeremiah entonces he's talking establando the lord's speaking to him and jeremiah speaks to the people jeremiah and he says my tabernacle is spoiled all my courts are broken but children are gone forth of me my so look how i start going from something that the lord had established to move away from god through unbelief bless the lord all my soul oh lord my god what a privilege church thou art very great our clothes with honor and majesty who covers thyself with light as with a garment who stretches out the heavens like a curse now no wonder why the lord said this man is of my own heart he started seeing the change yo el cambio how i believe moved on in this curtain now he's looking how the glory of the tabernacle now looks like curtains as we're going to come close if you notice what brother branham speaks two messages that are just sound like the same but are not the same questions it's the mighty god unveiled before and then in philadelphia he preaches the unveiling of god so when you come and he starts to show you these things we start to realize that he said you don't have to fear communism it's a cool [Music] i know the colors are a little weird but we try to get the black out but let's see if i can show this a little bit everything that you see here in this big clump of color here that's that's russia this is italy yes italia this is the western european countries right this is europa when when russia wanted to put a curtain what's black that's what the curtain has been placed so i was sharing with the brothers there that you know how as as the map of montana has the the pro profile of brother brian i'm looking towards hollywood for judge california then there's also a profile they're looking down to the european countries they did that they drew their own i didn't put those lines there that's how this is described as as does the iron curtain where it's been placed this curtain was still up when brother branham comes yes and there was russian soldiers on that what you call that curtain okay this is what the man on the other side of the curtain said that the little boy to this side of that girl [Applause] go ahead go ahead so does everybody know what we're talking about when we say iron curtain iron curtain that's what we're referring to referendum and it's important to know it's important that uh communism it's an anti-god system and so i was reading what brother branham said it might have been in 1954 don't quote me on the year but he said a hundred years ago he says the holy spirit fell in russia just like it did at the day of pentecost so 100 years before that and he said but what happened is they turned it away look at passover they didn't want nothing to do with it so what happened they became very he i believe he says they were like brutes very and that spirit of communism took over and you know that was just an interesting fact there it goes you know so that's uh that's the purpose behind this curtain of uh russia is [Music] let's go a little further than that i was was a tabernacle with where god would tabernacle himself that was the also the beginning of the how this purple curtain starts to grow strength all right so let's let's let's talk about what were we talking about let's talk about not the cat not the catholic people catholicism universal catholic absolutely we went and researched it and that's exactly what it means yeah it's sacramento it's universal and and there's a lot of things that we can say you know so in this purple robe or or this this purple curtain covering [Music] well i want to know why why catholics will put purple on anyway this was a significant part of christian history because the emperor constantine had just legalized christianity a few years before isa nismo now christians were not no longer persecuted they were able to make more formal doctrinal rules and regulate regulate christian practices the form of christianity approved and nicea became the official religion of the roman empire [Music] so this purple it says here we're not going to read all this but we're just going to mention this here this purple here brings some aspects and he said we first must remember that during his passion jesus was dressed in a purple robe jesus and it was the most expensive color available in the roman empire that when they they clothed him with purple says the scripture and they plattered but they did this just to mock them and after they did that they removed that purple rose and we're recognizing he is the highest person to be honored so we gave him the highest most expensive roman covering which is a purple mascara so this tabernacle this this in a curtain of light in a cortina what this religion had started when took over christianism so this is this is this is when pagan rome is and start forcing it ever since it's it's i mean if we go if we go through through uh catholicism and the meanings of it is significant they claim as you said the catholicism was started as a result of jesus of nazareth a jewish man whom christians believe is the son of god of the church and how they follow of course it has all the history on it but we're not going to read it we're just going to just mention how how how evil it has become once i must mention many of the churches began because of disagreements over belief and practice foreign think that the reforms didn't go far enough so they still believe that this needs to be enforced to be reformed completely so they said that uh the aspect of catholics and other christians christians they believe in god that god knows everything rose they're the highest when they speak about jesus not speaking about on it then became jesus and mary jesus this is this is this is a a a talk that i had with a with a gentleman one time he the scripture that paul paul comes back this is what this is what our pastor said on sundays one revelation there cannot be a second revolution [Music] highest form paganism where they have the right to take away from the world the apostle paul would say later this year or an angel absolutely [Music] and roman catholic church romana is a visible society of baptized christians [Music] professing the same faith under the authority of the invisible head christ the pope and the bishops in communion with him because bring it this is not what we want i like to continue to follow more what david was going how he knows that he changed but he followed the lord and he's asking brother bosswork he said now the father didn't know what he would what he would be speaking of the sun when he was born he might be a gangster a gangster he said [Music] he can turn his kingdom and his things his work over that boy do not and the tutor which you know in our case is the holy spirit that takes the word to the father and gives report of what he do if a purple robe was put on him and there was a law of adoption look how significant and how serious and sacred purple meant she make it herself covering of tapestry her clothing is silk and purple is the purple her husband is known in the case when he's seated among the elders of the land [Music] verse 25 gives us the definition of purple versus [Music] you know they could never progress or be successful unless they took it from the scriptures impossible now concerning the and i'm not going to say no more but i want to bring one point that is very interesting is very much attached to uh terrorism anybody nobody you know that outside of catholics the worship of mary equally worship under other names are the muslims muslims one of the main and most uh reversed doctrines of that they hold is is is mary it's very similar how they pronounce it the mother of of us is the the mother the the diocese which translated is jesus translator significa which is was actually trained by jesuit priests in order to come against the uh the israelites they sent jude a jesuit priest to train mohammed the inclusion because the principles of faith are pretty much i mean they're so similar it's just some some terms and and and name changes as far as the principles they're they're saying now whoever whoever gets it from here on the king of the of the south goes in the other way yes sir oh tell us something you know i don't know if you're having as much fun as we are but but it it it is our time is uh is we're already at an hour yes we're gonna we're gonna start wrapping wrapping this up because i kind of concentrated with the purple is that how he's moved and changed go ahead because i'll start i'm gonna just mention a couple things because i know you have something from the problem because we think of the purple curtain on the bamboo curtain as things of the past reported that a new iron current was descending between moscow and the west he says that russian economy uh sweeping sanctions imposed in the west have brought down a new iron curtain to the russian economy now it's hitting every facet now you ever see how it goes yeah freezing tens of billions of dollars now that's the threat it was not that people with those social educational or professional ties to the united states and western europe europa these are russians that have ties with united states and western europe america europa are trying to break through the digital iron curtain virtual private network virtual private networks virtual and then other sites that are russian jack it's the yandex or yandell some i wanna it goes back to how this guy wound up in russia regardless of covering himself i remember four years ago well it's all coming up this is this is recent stuff that the bamboo curtain bamboo used to most often be referred as the enclosed borders and economy though it began to open in 2010 the bamboo current has since picados giving way of the sentences giving way to the business model called the bamboo network the bamboo bamboo there's chinese people all over the world that fell off a few years ago they there was someone it was a spy plane that was that was brought down maybe it's a joke and it doesn't doesn't doesn't and it sounds funny but it's the it's it's the case do you know that the beginning of that curtain started when the chinese asked the western countries [Music] and it started with a ping-pong game what was it called ping-pong diplomacy diplomacy so at the state of the union address the the so a specialist in color says color sends a message so does purple mean when it comes to politics it carries some meanings from both colors you're communicating the trustworthiness from the blue candle as well as some red the power the power the in charge side of red color and this this person from washington dc is the person of the washington dc it says they're unifying that's the message of purple [Music] i don't think any of these panels have ever been done so real quick recap we have russia iron curtain cortina anti-god encounter we have uh rome thermos roma anti-christ spirit christos spiritual safe to say that's a religious spirit there is start off with want to fill you in on an ancient chinese secret it's by soon he was a chinese general and what he says the supreme art of war the highest form of war it's not to fire shots it's not to go conquer your enemy and that's exactly what china has taken on with the united states we do all our manufacturing over there as our as brother tommy was just saying uh real quick so china's gotten too big too fast in other words they have three million three hundred and fifty five tres mionas through uh thousand military numbers just to give you a reference we're at two million two hundred thirty three fifty robots robots tunnels and then uh as far as medications i know our pastors spoke on this but they make eighty percent of america's pharmaceutical drug supply that's our sorry that's our antibiotics antibiotics our over-the-counter pain medications important heart meds like coumadin all manufactured in china those manufactured so what's the deal with that well think back when the pandemic first broke out so all these uh going back to that quote of uh the highest form of warfare if china decided tomorrow hey we're cutting you off of your medications we're cutting you off all these uh major exports that we sent to you all that's a that's a weapon of war is [Music] again it's a communistic red china is communistic and yeah that's what we have as far as those go one last and you can take that's good and behold the veil of the temple was rhett and twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent and that was when the bale or the the prophet of god and you if you do anything for the lord you better hurry up and go up and do it you're getting old and there that morning yes i still [Applause] god all right amen would you stand to your feet tonight can you give one to the lord truly we're blessed tonight on my water panel i
