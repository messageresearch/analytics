[37:19] something happened to me 18 years old
[37:23] me and miss annual you could see it in
[37:25] such a magnitude
[37:28] until a great man of god that was with
[37:30] brother branham
[37:34] that he had never seen the supernatural
[37:36] outside of the ministry of brother
[37:38] branham
[37:42] till that night
[37:44] i tell you people tonight
[37:48] i tell you that
[38:26] there's a story that says this
[38:30] all the residents in this town were
[38:32] ducks
[38:35] and every sunday
[38:37] the ducks would waddle out of their
[38:39] houses
[38:43] and they would waddle down main street
[38:47] hasta la cayo principal to their church
[38:49] astrolessia they waddle into the
[38:51] sanctuary
[38:54] and they sat in their proper pews
[38:58] correct
[39:39] [Music]
[40:09] i don't know where you were but i was
[40:10] around maybe maybe right there in that
[40:12] pew no
[40:15] in the pews
[40:18] i was in church
[40:20] going to hell
[40:36] that
[41:18] no without
[41:32] went before them even unto the helios
[41:37] not behind them not a trust they just
[41:42] not on the side of them no as to lago
[41:46] before them today
[41:48] wouldn't you like well don't you love it
[41:50] when god tells you you he that you are
[41:53] his no
[41:57] here you find out a great prophet named
[41:59] moses
[42:14] this was a great man of god
[42:18] and up to the age of 40 years old
[42:22] the great minds of egypt those grandest
[42:25] men
[42:26] the great intelligence of egypt
[42:39] a military strategist
[43:36] eventually you're going to go to some
[43:38] church eventually
[43:46] you're eventually going to go to church
[43:48] to go to a wedding
[43:52] or
[44:05] and you've been looking around
[44:09] you see what you can get
[44:13] but all of a sudden
[44:15] your eye changes
[44:18] something that the world cannot for you
[44:46] god had to take him to the back side of
[44:48] the desert
[45:10] you're going to come to church one day
[45:14] and we're saying okay i already know how
[45:15] this works what's this
[45:30] going to sing for another 15 minutes
[45:34] and we're going to go home
[45:36] hour 45 minutes
[45:40] two hours
[45:42] and that's all i can get out of it
[45:55] that has kept you where you have been
[45:57] right now
[46:25] that had never been done before
[46:32] and you're going to see what i'm going
[46:34] to what i'm going to bring you right if
[46:36] you want to look at your work today i
[46:37] have nothing for you
[46:40] only god can give it to you
[46:42] but one day he's working
[46:46] with the sheep
[46:48] and he sees a burning bush
[46:52] that's on fire
[46:54] well it might not be out of the ordinary
[46:59] but it looks back a minute later
[47:02] it's still on fire
[47:05] and it has not been consumed yet
[47:09] now he's got to either go check it
[47:12] out
[47:13] but as he already starts in his mind
[47:18] why did i kill that egyptian
[47:21] why did i did that hurt me
[47:25] something in my heart
