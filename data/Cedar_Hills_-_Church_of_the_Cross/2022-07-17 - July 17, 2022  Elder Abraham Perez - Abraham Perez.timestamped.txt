[40:20] what age would you choose
[40:32] no no would you like to be from 50 to
[40:35] 75. is
[41:03] intelligence wisdom
[41:10] that's what you treasure so much after
[41:12] so many years
[41:14] what does a person of 25 years know
[41:17] establishments
[41:20] [Laughter]
[41:29] [Music]
[41:44] [Music]
[41:49] these are the generations of the heavens
[41:51] and of the earth when they were created
[41:54] in the day that the lord god made the
[41:56] earth and the heavens
[42:06] and every planet of the field before it
[42:08] was in the earth and every earth of the
[42:10] field before it grew for the lord god
[42:12] had not caused it to rain upon the earth
[42:31] from the earth and water the whole face
[42:33] of the ground
[42:40] and the lord got four men of the dust of
[42:42] the ground and breathed into his
[42:44] nostrils the breath of life and man
[42:46] became a living soul entonces
[42:56] his blessing to the arena the word you
[42:58] may be seen
[43:03] the days of thunder los diaz
[43:07] all the mystery of the gospel oh el
[43:10] mysterio
[43:45] and closed the heavens for three and a
[43:48] half years
[43:51] and under that
[44:04] screaming for his life
[44:08] the anointing had left him
[44:13] he he under the thread of a woman called
[44:16] jezebel
[44:18] um
[44:25] give me
[44:26] genesis 2
[44:28] 6 again
[44:30] hennessey says the nuevo
[44:34] but there were not a mist from the earth
[44:36] and watered the whole face of the ground
[44:43] all these years that i've been
[44:45] ministering
[44:49] my favorite book
[44:53] is genesis as genesis and revelation e
[44:57] apocalypses brother baron says those are
[44:59] the two books that
[45:01] satan hates the
[45:06] and you follow my messages most of them
[45:09] are genesis
[45:10] revelations
[45:12] messages on the genesis is the
[45:14] apocalypse you want to know the
[45:15] beginning and the year
[45:59] the face of the ground
[46:04] did it water the ground
[46:09] listen so you can learn
[47:21] he could only use the dust
[47:26] now we're going to find out oh my
[47:28] goodness hallelujah i only learned this
[47:32] less saturday when i was studying for my
[47:34] message
[49:00] is
[49:32] [Music]
[49:42] my tutors were the two best teachers in
[49:44] these messages
[50:00] so then
[50:02] this is the mystery of the gospel
[50:08] like many ministers have said much
[50:34] now to him there is a power to establish
[50:38] you according
[50:51] paul did not the apostle paul did not
[50:53] say the gospel of jesus christ
[50:58] he said this is my gospel
[51:02] so am i preaching this morning my god
[51:20] the gospel is good news
[51:24] the word doesn't give you good news this
[51:27] morning
[51:30] so who is bringing yeah
[51:48] because even
[52:00] of jesus christ according to the
[52:02] revelation of the mystery which was kept
[52:05] secret since the world begins
[52:29] is made manifest
[52:45] nations for the obedience of the
[52:47] revelation of faith
[52:55] this
[52:56] generation is
[53:11] corinthians 4. remember
[53:17] that a man saw account of us as of the
[53:20] ministers of christ and stewards
[53:22] of the mysteries of god
[53:43] moreover it is required in stewards that
[53:46] a man be found faithful
[53:53] verse 5
[53:56] therefore just nothing before this time
[53:59] until the lord come who both will bring
[54:02] to light the hidden things of darkness
[54:06] and will make manifest the councils of
[54:08] the hearts and the he shall shout there
[54:11] shall every man have praise of god
[54:37] thunderings remember the title of the
[54:39] message the days of thunder
[54:45] and all the peoples of the thunderings
[54:47] and the lightnings and the noise of the
[54:49] trumpet
[54:50] and the mountain smoking and when the
[54:53] people saw it they removed and stood off
[54:57] todd
[55:09] and they said unto moses speak thou with
[55:12] us and we will hear but let not god
[55:14] speak with us lest we die
[55:17] he says
[55:26] and moses said unto the people fear not
[55:29] for god has come to prove you and that
[55:32] his fear may be before your faces
[55:47] and the people stood up far off and
[55:50] moses drew near unto the thick darkness
[55:53] where god was entonces
[56:15] and brother branham went to that cloud
[56:20] or into the thick darkness
[56:25] and you say how can god
[56:27] abide in darkness
[56:40] it's not darkness like you go into a
[56:42] dark room at your house
[56:47] but it says that god was in the thick
[56:50] darkness
[56:54] brother says
[56:56] he was
[57:15] amen amen
[57:22] revelation
[57:24] 6 1. apocalypse says uno
[57:31] and i saw when the lamb opened one of
[57:34] the seals and heard the see where the
[57:36] noise of thunder
[57:38] one
[57:51] notice that the seals open with the
[57:54] thunder
[57:58] so if the seven seals open with the
[58:01] thunder
[58:05] and brothers said that the sails were in
[58:07] the book of genesis
[58:12] should they also be open with the
[58:15] thunder hey
[58:19] and what is
[58:34] it was
[59:03] notice when the first hill was open
[59:10] the bible says
[59:14] or the sun open it
[59:30] light
[59:32] it wasn't the sun
[59:35] it was the father who opened the seal
[59:40] and the evening
[59:42] in the morning were the first seal
[1:00:04] amen amen
[1:00:06] sixth there were six days of creation
[1:00:12] so then there
[1:00:35] is
[1:00:54] the enemy came preaching another
[1:00:56] doctrine
[1:01:00] wasn't her husband her pastor
[1:01:04] superstore and he held the word of
[1:01:08] god did she go to another place to hear
[1:01:12] another minister preach a different
[1:01:15] doctrine
[1:01:19] and she believed the lie of the devil
[1:01:48] and what does the bible say
[1:01:53] [Music]
[1:02:01] [Applause]
[1:02:19] abraham search for a city abraham
[1:02:24] the prophets in job prophesy
[1:02:30] of somebody that was coming
[1:02:35] and man became more wicked
[1:02:40] and he grieved god
[1:02:44] said he had made men
[1:03:11] so where was the water going to come
[1:03:14] from you
[1:03:56] a sweet
[1:04:10] and then
[1:04:54] and the animals knew better what that
[1:04:55] thunder was than men
[1:05:00] the people heard that thunder he says
[1:05:06] they were scared
[1:05:21] and one by one that they go entering
[1:05:22] into the ark the voice of god is
[1:05:25] thundering not only this morning it's
[1:05:27] thundering
[1:05:29] all the time
[1:05:34] and the humanitarian
[1:06:14] the animals enter into the arctic
[1:06:45] and god saw the wickedness of man idiots
[1:06:50] so when the atomic bombs hit entonces
[1:06:58] it hit the cold atmosphere
[1:07:03] and produce the first clouds
[1:07:07] and then they dumped all the water here
[1:07:10] on earth
[1:07:26] i was in the arizona desert
[1:07:29] arizona when a blessed like a thunder
[1:07:33] shook the whole earth
[1:07:38] the thunder was the voice of god
[1:08:36] under
[1:08:39] it says in the book of first
[1:08:41] thessalonians and premiere
[1:08:43] senses
[1:08:46] let's read it
[1:08:48] and i didn't give it to you but now that

[1:09:01] 416.
[1:09:15] he went to the cloud like moses
[1:09:32] here
[1:09:34] for the lord himself shall descend from
[1:09:37] heaven
[1:09:46] is
[1:10:17] and
[1:10:18] i'm not going to mention names no women
[1:10:21] are numbers
[1:10:22] but in those early days
[1:10:28] as mean the
[1:10:43] and dude
[1:10:45] the first one not because he already
[1:10:47] came but do the voice of archangel and
[1:10:50] the trumpet of god
[1:11:04] the pastor there from lima peru called
[1:11:06] me
[1:11:06] and i will say which one
[1:11:09] i'm not going to tell you android is not
[1:11:22] how many churches are the messenger in
[1:11:23] lima peru
[1:11:38] because each one has their own doctrine
[1:11:43] and one of the doctrines
[1:11:45] is
[1:11:57] it's going to be a tent and he has to
[1:11:58] give the voice to the archangel and then
[1:12:00] the trumpet of god
[1:12:17] and that day i'll have to answer the god
[1:12:19] for what i'm preaching to you today
[1:12:34] standing behind this pulpit
[1:12:38] all the honoring glory goes to god
[1:12:42] how do you stay in my position
[1:12:46] i don't go from house to house
[1:13:18] he said i want you to teach me this
[1:13:20] verse what the message says because
[1:13:22] there's many voices going around talking
[1:13:24] about this very same scripture
[1:14:02] he says i wish i had the voice of the
[1:14:04] archangel now
[1:14:07] and the voice of the archangel
[1:14:11] is the voice of resurrection
[1:14:53] elisha said i want a double portion of
[1:14:55] your spirit
[1:14:59] if you see me when i go then you will
[1:15:01] receive it
[1:15:05] when elijah was lifted up
[1:15:18] [Music]
[1:15:45] one portion was manifest when brother
[1:15:47] branham was here
[1:15:49] the resurrection
[1:15:52] but here's the the thing right here
[1:15:56] remember it has two parts
[1:16:00] when brother branham was here who's tell
[1:16:02] this you
[1:16:03] you and
[1:16:32] you were dead in that system
[1:16:36] then when the message came
[1:16:39] that's when the thunder came
[1:16:44] come out from amongst my people
[1:17:09] and with the trumpet of god
[1:17:28] to gather the people
[1:17:31] [Music]
[1:17:34] yeah there's going to be a war with
[1:17:35] satan yes
[1:17:40] but to be able to gather the people
[1:17:43] all you people that are here
[1:17:47] you come from different countries
[1:17:51] different states different
[1:17:54] so what drew you to las cruces
[1:18:10] it was your brother-in-law mike thomas
[1:18:12] perez girl ex-pastor no he's still
[1:18:15] fester
[1:18:19] superstore he's still festering
[1:18:22] in caleb perez
[1:19:07] once i got here you know this is stan
[1:19:09] lucky
[1:19:11] because you gotta be obedient to the
[1:19:13] world
[1:19:34] never said to
[1:20:02] it's only a film of moisture
[1:20:08] condensed on surface is droplets
[1:20:15] but god hit a plane
[1:21:12] light and water loose hour and water is
[1:21:16] a solvent it is
[1:21:20] a liquid that dissolves
[1:21:26] or can
[1:21:39] so water is two parts hydrogen and one
[1:21:41] part oxygen
[1:21:46] what was the second part
[1:21:48] one part oxygen
[1:21:51] hydrogen is the simplest element
[1:21:57] it is the most flammable and plentiful
[1:22:00] guest in the universe
[1:22:07] that is
[1:22:22] a giant bowl of hydrogen and helium
[1:22:31] and in the sun's core
[1:22:34] centro del sol
[1:22:36] hydrogen atoms combine to form helium
[1:22:40] guesses
[1:22:47] this process is called fusion
[1:23:01] the reaction increased two atoms of
[1:23:04] hydrogen
[1:23:17] so it's the process of fusion
[1:23:24] of the radiant energy
[1:23:29] that sustains life here on earth
[1:23:42] and because hydrogen is so much lighter
[1:23:45] than air
[1:23:49] it rises fast and is quickly ejected
[1:23:52] from the atmosphere
[1:23:59] that's why hydrogen is
[1:24:14] united
[1:25:10] into
[1:25:24] god of the earth
[1:25:28] and satan be became
[1:25:32] not only god of earth
[1:25:36] but god of the
[1:25:38] heavens and men in those days did not
[1:25:41] have the holy ghost
[1:25:46] but they were moved by it
[1:25:50] moved by faith
[1:26:21] he say a libra to the time of the end
[1:26:26] and then that day the wise will
[1:26:28] understand
[1:26:31] and you are the wise
[1:26:33] because you are here this morning
[1:26:36] you have given your life to
[1:26:39] jesus
[1:26:41] jesus
[1:26:46] there was an atmosphere over the years
[1:26:48] of darkness
[1:26:53] the prayers
[1:26:56] could not come up
[1:27:01] there was no atonement no via expiation
[1:27:05] and when jesus was baptized
[1:27:10] in the jordan river in rio jordan the
[1:27:13] heavens were opened
[1:27:27] and then he told peter
[1:27:44] moses
[1:27:58] god had been manifested in the flesh
[1:28:04] and peter pedro he got the revelation of
[1:28:08] the name
[1:28:11] you are the christ
[1:28:13] you are the christ
[1:28:15] christian son of the living god
[1:28:19] because flesh and blood has not revealed
[1:28:21] this
[1:28:24] and the lord said yes
[1:28:26] to you i will give you the kiss to the
[1:28:29] king
[1:28:32] and peter opened the door to the heavens
[1:28:38] he was given the keys
[1:28:52] if there is no sacrifice on the altar
[1:28:54] you
[1:29:07] where is your sacrifice
[1:29:10] now he's talking to each and every one
[1:29:12] of us
[1:29:15] if there is no sacrifice on the altar
[1:29:21] then your prayers cannot be
[1:29:48] after this jesus knowing that all things
[1:29:50] were now accomplished
[1:29:52] that the scripture might be fulfilled
[1:29:54] says i thirst
[1:29:58] what's worse was it
[1:30:00] 1928
[1:30:02] versus
[1:30:16] now there was set a vessel full of
[1:30:18] vinegar
[1:30:19] and they filled the sponge with vinegar
[1:30:22] and
[1:30:24] in it was hot up and it was putting to
[1:30:27] his mouth
[1:30:32] in
[1:30:42] when jesus therefore had received the
[1:30:44] vinegar he said it is finished and he
[1:30:48] bought his head and gave up the ghost
[1:30:50] jesus
[1:30:57] can you imagine what they gave
[1:31:15] and instead of hearing
[1:31:17] the
[1:31:18] wine
[1:31:20] that's what
[1:31:22] the revolution that they had yes
[1:31:25] they gave him vinegar
[1:32:11] imagine
[1:32:14] they did not understand
[1:32:18] because he was thirsty
[1:32:21] and gave vinegar with hospital
[1:32:47] you've said you've seen that since
[1:32:50] genesis
[1:33:49] father oh we can write straight and we
[1:33:51] could preach about revelation
[1:33:59] of course because of his position
[1:34:14] henry henry we
[1:34:18] couldn't understand
[1:34:20] because he was
[1:34:21] far ahead of all of us
[1:34:27] that's why god chose him to be an
[1:34:29] apostle president
[1:34:45] and when he had so said he showed unto
[1:34:48] them his hands and his side
[1:34:50] then were the disciples glad when they
[1:34:52] saw the lord
[1:35:02] then said jesus to them again peace be
[1:35:05] unto you as my father has sent me even
[1:35:08] so then are you entonces jesus
[1:35:12] pasta
[1:35:21] and when he had said this he breathed on
[1:35:24] them and saith unto them
[1:35:27] [Music]
[1:35:55] he said receiving the holy ghost
[1:36:00] they receive the holy ghost right then
[1:36:03] and then
[1:36:08] mismo
[1:36:10] and i looked at the ministry you'll be a
[1:36:13] minister
[1:36:14] and i said
[1:36:17] what kind of spirit did he receive get
[1:36:19] people that are spiritual
[1:36:21] because after jesus said that especially
[1:36:26] peter denied the lord three times
[1:36:31] and he cursed
[1:36:37] cursed bad words came out of his mouth
[1:36:39] how am i doing the man with the holy
[1:36:41] ghost do that
[1:36:43] commercial american spiritual son to put
[1:36:44] them all deceased when jesus said
[1:36:46] receiving the holy ghost
[1:36:50] was
[1:37:01] and ye will receive the promise
[1:37:32] amen it's good yeah
[1:37:35] amen
[1:37:36] when jesus uh
[1:37:39] arose and appeared to his disciples
[1:37:44] and and said receive the holy ghost
[1:37:51] because ten days later
[1:37:56] on the day of pentecost
[1:37:58] the abstract came down
[1:38:13] then later in the first church age this
[1:38:15] place
[1:38:17] it started fine coming
[1:38:19] in but they began to drift from the
[1:38:21] world
[1:38:24] and then the rebuke came
[1:38:28] because
[1:38:50] coming to this message in malachi
[1:38:53] foreign
[1:39:08] the way to heaven is we're going to
[1:39:10] build a tower that goes to heaven
[1:39:16] why are there over a hundred churches in
[1:39:18] lima peru
[1:39:21] peru
[1:39:22] they have their own tower of beverages
[1:40:00] [Music]
[1:40:05] they want to reach god with vinegar
[1:40:11] they want to go get to god with the
[1:40:13] vinegar because it will be like
[1:40:16] but what is vinegar good for
[1:40:29] see what happens
[1:40:32] he's in vinegar a wine they never
[1:41:14] now
[1:41:18] well you could have said that to me when
[1:41:20] my wife was alive
[1:41:25] but actually we stay tuned together
[1:41:30] sister ruth and mana ruth

[1:41:46] the last time i preached in phoenix
[1:41:51] uh we were at the table brother alvaro
[1:41:54] and brother ernie burunda and other
[1:41:56] brothers
[1:42:25] there's a place in
[1:42:26] heaven for the abused woman
[1:42:33] because look at all the abuse living
[1:42:35] with you for 47 years
[1:42:40] old
[1:43:12] when you have your wife or your husband
[1:43:15] take care of each other and when you
[1:43:17] have your continuous responses
[1:43:29] because it's going to happen to you like
[1:43:30] it did the founding pastor of my so
[1:43:32] after our wives passed away
[1:43:34] breathe in love
[1:43:36] take care of them
[1:43:41] the husbands take care of the wife
[1:43:44] they want to reach god with vinegar
[1:43:48] the wrong wine
[1:43:50] and i'll
[1:43:59] and the third day there was a marriage
