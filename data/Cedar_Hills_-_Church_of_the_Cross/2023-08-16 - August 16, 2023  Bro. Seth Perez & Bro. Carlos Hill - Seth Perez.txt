Service let us pray before we get going dear gracious Lord heavenly father father you know the Gracia what a privilege it is to be in your house and something that we shouldn't take very lightly Lord this should mean something to us something that shouldn't be routine and lord always fill us with your Holy Spirit Jesus name we pray amen amen let us turn into a scripture found in Luke 21 verse Uno the word of God reads this way and he looked up and saw the rich man casting their gifts into the treasury as he's a layer in mirando a Los ricoso friends Villagio and he saw also a certain poor Widow casting in thither to mites Blancas and he said of a truth I say unto you that this poor widow have cast in more than they are all these have of their abundance cast in in unto the offerings of God but she of her penury have cast in all the living that she had friends may God have his blessings to the reading of the word and you may be seated thank the Lord for for his mercy and his grace which surrounds us every day every time we come to church you know we come very rich yeah rich we become rich spiritually speaking and sometimes day after day maybe service after service we're so comfortable and communist service that maybe we slack off a little bit you know we become as these rich men these rich men that have a lot of goods a lot of money and you come into service sometimes like you walk in and you like you own The Joint investors but but you want again puffed up ready for service and and you you know you're gonna hear some good singing we might raise our hand a little bit we got a nice new suit God is good oh he's blessed me with some great clothes we're going to hear some good preaching maybe I'll worship a little bit and then you know I'm after church yeah we're gonna go get some lunch I might go and have a nice big steak and it's like that day after day you know yeah well what else are they going to say they're going to say the same thing they said you know but something caught me about this poor widow woman it's always when we don't have certain things that we kind of get a little closer to God where is your heart we sometimes are not like the poor widow woman and we can come and give something to the Lord but we don't have any feeling or meaning or value behind us our heart is far away from our gifts way far away and I speak to myself what haven't I given to the Lord is there more to give this widow woman is it was the smallest of the coins that she dropped into the offering bag and let me tell you how small it was Blancas were equivalent to a penny Penny what can he do with a penny I'm sorry brother Ron sorry what could you do with a penny what would you do with the penny what value does that mean to you it was the offering that she gave is the tithing was already paid and that was owed to God already but she wanted to give something more she had a burning desire in her heart that has felt the Lord pull on their hearts but I do all this for the church didn't you see me coming early I went upstairs to the audio department isn't it enough and then the pastor may ask hey I need you to do this is foreign not just half of what she had let me let me rephrase not just ten percent that's the one just half of you yeah the Lord himself is here he wants all of you he wants you to know it's okay to drop it is all that you have is because again Lord Jesus said he saw the rich and all the money that they dropped but that didn't move him he had a talent disciples to [Music] so to Viviana and what an amazing level of sacrifice it's known as our human cells yes we don't want to sacrifice we're fearful we don't want to give and when we do your heart's not in it sometimes when we prepare a gift we put no thought or value and don't realize who were you giving to you know it's because we're selfish we're selfish I'm selfish you can put your name there if you want we want to receive before we even before we give yeah and there's several reasons yeah you're selfish some people believe it's logical to put themselves first primero whenever possible to ensure their survival and thriving you have a fear of losing control you sometimes you don't even know you're selfish sometimes you fear abandonment sometimes you want to be manipulative manipulative manipulators you have the wrong mindset sometimes we're only conscious of my needs is sometimes we confuse we need an Awakening the Necessities so let's go vamos you confused your wants for your knee you learned this when you're young you got to know what you need what you can afford how do you prioritize in your life a need is something you must have is something you wish a need represents necessity represents your desire uh your need is essential to survival Necessities your want is essential your need is going to remain constant over time your wants change constantly your need may result in an onset of disease or even sorry let me back that up your need if it's not fulfilled may result in an onset of disease or even death do neces your want if it's not fulfilled may result in disappointment the term needs is defined as an inter the individual's basic requirement that must be fulfilled in order to survive Una I'll go individual and then the individual's needs while his wants are unlimited something that needs to be quenchedo needs represent the Necessities once indicate desires so really quick quiz um Remos it depends where you live at right sometimes we'll sacrifice everything for this thing but I need this I can't even add oh no no no mathematics oh shoot I gotta look up something on Google Google I can't live without it how did they live out without this before even it was even Bennett do you need this do you need water do you desire it sometimes your body gets really mad at you this is my muscles are cramping I need some water you know the other thing we are not content with what we have and then we complain well we don't have they're looking well brother Moses has a nicer tie than I oh yeah Lord how come you don't give me that foreign [Applause] yeah you want to be distracted come on distracted and you start having wandering eyes but I like that shiny thing is I'm gonna have to wrap my daughter out you have a thousand toys and your sister has another toy and you forget all your toys just for one thing that you didn't want in the first place how childish we are okay guess Satan wants to provide all your wants assistance he's after your need to be your need [Applause] he wants you to sacrifice what will he give for this huh okay you're a little addicted I love it let me show you something new but I want to be your needs but it's what he says but let me tell you what the Bible says let me tell you what it says in Philippians 4 19. but my God my God shall supply all your needs not your needs but that doesn't make sense I want somebody to provide all my needs well maybe physically you need water and food necesitas but spiritually it's the place that he designed [Applause] everything else tries to take it sometimes we try to fill it up with others it doesn't work this is hermano I have him achieve what I wanted to in life if I choose the Lord right now I won't be able to get that and I'm scared I'm super scared God Will Supply your need he will supply your need but you gotta know him as my provider you got addicted that is yours yes but this is mine these Earthly possessions are mines and that's our problem is you know that widow woman yeah it's a view that she must have known he was Jehovah she must have known that he was the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob uh [Applause] and he wants your heart how is it that God's jealous isn't that weird I heard the brother preaching is to be a Christian Cristiano means to be like Jesus Jesus and Jesus they're they're jealous Jesus says celoso who's jealous here today we're jealous we covet uh we want other things not the Lord but your God is a jealous you know he's fiercely protective protectivo or Vigilant or vigilante of one's rights or possessions you're jealous of the things you don't have um and the Lord the Lord your God is jealous for you yes even before you even gave your heart to the Lord and maybe you still come to church service after service and you still haven't done it maybe you've given God only 20 percent uh but he's jealous he demands faithfulness is an exclusive worship thou shall have no other gods before me but we make this to God no I don't worship it not only wants your heart he wants your mind you probably heard this before he wants your strength he wants your time oh Lord I just went to I went to work I got 10 minutes for you Lord I'm so worn out Lord maybe if you were uh give me more money I don't have to work what a sickly attitude he's asking you to surrender all to him he's asking give your heart is why because he gave the very best for you I think the best gift that you can received is when someone gives you the itself when I was a kid we just want toys but when someone gives you their time you know what that is you know how our pastor is a sacrifice for them it's a sacrifice for their family and I know that because now I'm on both sides of the coin but I want to encourage you today give him your heart you hear it all the time you hear it all the times but if you heard anything today if you heard his voice just crack the door a little bit sometimes we're scared to open that door and Jesus is there knocking and he's knocking he wants to get in Estates and he's a gentleman yes but it's your job to unlock the door grab the knob and Dios as Brother Carlos comes forward you know the I've noticed the more you give to the Lord the more you're blessed and for me money's a bad Master my family knows that I am height but I've tried to do better because I see the need of all those that desire the Lord but the more you give him more you're blessed the little boy gave Five Loaves and two fish is Elijah's Widow gave him to eat first though it was hard and she was gonna die she had food he must gave him my old tattered garments my filthy rags say I don't have much today and that is good yes once again you don't need all those worldly possessions give them your garments that lives beautiful myself [Applause] don't be scared we're here with you open your heart foreign amen amen I I was all right just let him keep on going he was he was getting rolling there I was that's tremendous God bless Brothers amen amen so we're brother Seth was talking about opening your heart hermano says and and it just so happened that we're gonna we're gonna talk a little bit tonight about someone who who wanted to open their hearts so if you'll turn with me in your Bibles tonight we're gonna go to a book of John chapter three we'll start with with uh with verse three it's uh this is a well-known scripture is and when you have it you could just saying Tiempo Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God respond Jesus how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born and I want you to notice that Jesus doesn't even really acknowledge nicodemus's question Jesus he doesn't stop his thought to address nicodemus's comments verse 5 says Jesus Jesus verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of the water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God and there's where we wanna we wanna start there and and and we notice here Aquino tamus and then the Lord forgive me for not having you stand to read the words and may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of that word but notice how much because he didn't want people to see him come talk to Jesus but that's not even the important part we know that that Nicodemus he he really couldn't grasp what it was that Jesus was talking about Jesus but but the first thing that that we tend to do when we read this scripture is is we assume that Nicodemus maybe ask the silly questions any anybody who knows a little bit about biology knows you can't enter the second time into your mother's womb is we we take that that statement is and we take the question and we put it to the side it was so so lost but I want you to know something I want to ask a question is it possible it's possibly is it possible it's possible to enter again into my mother's womb Madre because what if I told you that it's not only possible but it is an absolute necessity is so then the question becomes well brother what is it what in the world are you talking about because he said you can't do it we've accepted the fact that in that physically it can't be done but then I'm going to answer the question like the chief used to respwest he used to answer a question with another question so you go and you go get advice and you said Chief what do I do it is and the first thing he would say is let me ask you a question so I'm going to ask you a question the question then becomes then who is my mother says that becomes the question of the day to ask because if it's a necessity to enter once again and physically I can't enter back into my mother's name is so we find here and we find we find Jesus in The Book of Matthew Jesus verse 46 and and this here if you read this chapter uh he's Jesus he's he's laying down the law here Jesus he's got a multitude of people in front of him and and he's he's really he's really hammering him and and the people they're getting restless and then they they kind of can't take it anymore but they noticed Mary and some of the brothers coming up to where Jesus and because they can't handle what Jesus is putting out Jesus the scripture tells us while he yet talk to the people it says his mother and his brothers he stood without Desiring to speak to him then one in the middle of his sermon once said unto him and thy brother and standing without and Desiring to speak with but watch the way Jesus responds when they tell him Behold thy mother Wonder Jesus catches that Jesus because if he would have acknowledged it a certain way he said behold now Madre [Music] so we return back to the original question if it's necessary to enter again CS neces because now we've changed now we're looking at the scene from a different angles we can no longer look at it from a carnal standpoint we can no longer look at it from that Persona that says I want my wants filled we've got to change our position and we begin to understand who are they that do the will of my father Yes Padre what is the will of my father because unless I can answer these questions I'll never understand who is my mother and we understand what is the will of the father Yes just sum it up simply [Music] this is the will of the father that's his will estos because his word wants you to as well [Applause] Madre so we find now we have the will now we understand what is the will and so my mother entonces me Madre is that do the will of God but are we still physical are we still stuck in carnality are we still looking around at one another thing who we could see or have our eyes been opened oh no straws as our spiritual eye and see that was placed before the foundations because it looks at things differently and it begins to ask the question is who is this because the one thing that Jesus said we must do Jesus is to be born again there's no way around it there's no shortcuts there's no easy way you've got to enter back in regression only this time you enter into the mother which is the word of almighty God is and it's there is so that we can enter in once again G must be born again Nicodemus wasn't as crazy as we all thoughts he wasn't as silly as we all thought but Nicodemus just had one problem we see the carnal Partners so if you notice back in the scripture and this blew me away because this is the the new birth it's the very Crux of what we believe John chapter 3 San Juan and you look at verse seven you step back that statement blows me away here's Jesus Jesus giving him the one Commandments did you and I must kill Nicodemus couldn't capture it and Jesus turns to Nicodemus and he says but Nicodemus it is you must say it again I'm on you gotta go with me come on you gotta go to this scene you gotta be there when he tells them yeah [Music] this is the Crux of malachios again Nuevo but Jesus turns to him Peru Jesus answers that I said unto thee here that you must be born again it's all right don't don't hurt yourself no no no don't Marvel too much so that when you start to that Journey when you young people start to wander condos how do I receive the new birth you begin to enter it is but it's not just here it's there it's there who is your mother it's here foreign [Music] thank you gracias [Applause] my mobile forgive me asure in the bad Splash Zone spot there is not all that saith Lord Lord do the will of the father that's what Jesus told them Jesus that Marvel not that the demons but you can cast them out there's a lot of people that say Lord Lord says it becometh us to know where we stand in the word it becomes to study the mother if you come with us so that we know so we're doing the will of God I want to read this quote real quick now I take brother Ronnie for this by the way brother Brandon yesterday a message question and answers science has taken man forward more forward Mas Adelante greater things with this mind Mas Grande then what and that's the only thing that he has yes is the tree of knowledge is but this last part this last part heard to the core is farther then the ministers has taken them taking him to quit with his Spirit which is unlimited and so I was we were talking with brother Ronnie in the back is and the only question I could ask was why is that the case why has science taken us further then the ministry when they're dealing with a limited knowledge is and the word of God is unlimited and then I thought and I've been I pondered and I prayed Lopez and the Lord said yes because science gives them the thing that they want not what they need science gives us technology and as long as there's a distraction brother calebra you know destruction brother Bradham says a minister could preach until he was blue in the face they said hermano Brown what if the distractions are great then what we're actually looking for is then we'll go further with science but that don't line up because that's not the way it's supposed to be okay book of Jeremiah chapter one verse foreign Bible says then the word of the Lord came unto me saying notice how the Lord speaks to Jeremiah before antis I formed I must say that again before antis I formed in the valley I knew thee um he said before and testicle you and I were even formed before he sat to the businesses of creating you and I The Creator he knew us we were in his thoughts we were in his mind and we find out that when we come we find let me get here in contramos that predestination looks back to election election looks to foreign travel [Applause] [Music] and he speaks to Jeremiah and he said before they say antis when I knew you Jeremiah he said I Sanctified you the scientific I already prepared you I already gave you all that you were gonna need I already provided the sacrifice I already wrote your name on The Book of Life you were even formed I knew you they're gonna see and we reach a point find out in Galatians 1 15 okay but when it pleased God because he already knew yeah but when it pleased who separated me from my camera the second time we sit under tutors what are we waiting for que estamos esperando that adoption of saints is we're waiting there is but he knew Peru he knew how long it was going to take me he knew how long I had to be in the womb is and when he separated me brother Henry thank you hermano Henry muchas gracias because when he separated me porque cuando there was a death and that death takes place and when the separation happens a new creation Jesus and that's what he knew yesterday when he saw Jeremiah before he formed him and tested he saw him the moment and love your animal that the separation happened because that's when Jeremiah became the living soul before that he was a dead soul muerta no life but when the separation comes the life enters then we have access that's when we begin to have that access to all of the promises that God gave us to the rest foreign but it all begins with the question who is the musicians I'm gonna end with this it's a little story the guys who put the picture up on the screen I I see Los Hombres and this picture is this picture is hanging in a famous Museum in Paris Paris and this picture is it's of a man playing the devil for his soul is playing chess with the devil for instance and he's losing pretty bad the name of this picture is called Checkmate say Yama El mate but one day there was a man who was walking through the museum seeing the art it was a way you can play something if you would and he's walking through the museum and he stops at this picture and he stays there staring at it for hours and he's staring at it so much that it begins to attract all the museum curators and they said sir are you okay and he said what do they call that picture it is he said they call that picture checkmate you see because the devil has as him in a position where he can't go nowhere the man said hello I'm a chess Grandmaster you say you so you a granite I played chess for many many
