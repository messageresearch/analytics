amen and so we uh you know you get from a different angles different things right and so so we're talking about uh the infilling of the Holy Ghost [Music] and uh and so we pray that this is a blessing to you brother Brandon says God always fills his Temple can you tell that to your neighbor God always feels his Temple he fills it with with what he fills it with what he fills it with himself the same thing today God will fill every Temple that will thoroughly dedicate itself to him the temple is not this little building it's not the one in Salt Lake City not the one in Rome the temple is you tell your neighbor the temple is you are the temple that God wants to dwell in and express himself through yes that all nations might know him you can open your Bibles to the Ephesians the fourth chapter and we'll get into the word Ephesians 4 and we're going to go from 7 to 13. when you have you can you can say Amen if you got it amen but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ before he said when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the Earth now watch once again the infilling of the Holy Ghost amen and he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all Heavens that he might fill all things in Spanish it says complete which is right but but in English it's to fill all things let's see how he was going to feel all things and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ as we bow our heads father almighty God we are here Lord at your command in obedience to your word Lord with all humility with all humbleness and sincerity Lord we approach this subject today we have read the text now we ask that you give us the context and Grant this morning Lord that the angel of the Lord we'll encamp about this place will come to every heart and make ready the infilling of the Holy Spirit and divine faith that all the sick Lord and Afflicted might be healed may all the Sinners be saved May the Saints be blessed and may all the backsliders return home for your honor and Glory we ask all these things as we place this service in ourselves in your hands in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you you may be seated what a subject we have this morning on the infilling of the Holy Ghost the word very word infilling it means to fill in it is the material bill that is used to feel something it's the material that is used to fill a space or a hole now there's a lot of different kinds of materials out there that we can fill ourselves up with idea that's my mom's sister there's a lot of things out there that we can feel ourselves as I said but when we look at this we're not interested this morning in all the materials that you can fill yourself with we're interested in only one kind of materials brother Brown says so when a man lives by faith it is the fifth day right and we know this already f-a-i-t-h is j-e-s-u-s g-r-a-c-e Jesus amen or amen amen amen so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean a substance Faith all right now we're gonna start to feel it's a substance Faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ there he says now you're getting into bride materials okay dial your neighbors now we're getting into Pride materials see you're getting into rapturing condition right now you're getting into rapturing condition right now now now how many know that the Lord will not share his glory with no one is but therefore there cannot be an infilling until first there has to be an empty now it's the biggest mistake that people make today they're always Lord feelings and we go on and on and on through the years but we never want to empty out and we say Lord come into my heart I'm going to tell you again he will share his throne with no one this is where I believe that the problem lies this is where I believe the problem Lies We like to empty out a few things and then we try to fit God in see if he fits somewhere all right yes or yes TLC others empty out but then they make the mistake of not filling themselves all the way up being empty can be a good thing or not so good things depends what you do after that but I'm going to take for instance a a chair for example an empty an empty chair there's a couple of empty chairs and I want to use this as a maybe as an example to the preacher the empty chair says your sermon has no value hello everybody to the visitors the empty chair says uh I think they're losing ground here to the one looking for a church to attendance an empty chairs tells them I better be I better wait a little bit you see what's really going on here to The Treasure of the church an empty chair says we're gonna be in a deficit talk about it yes come on Empty Chairs to the members of the church they see an empty chair and it tells them you can be absent next Sunday dude [Music] empty chair says I'm not interested in your hours of practice and discipline the empty chair testifies against the church services it kills inspiration and it chokes out hope I stop here for a moment one time my grandmother was in church and there was a lot of empty chairs and my grandfather was preaching and he said oh if you could just see right now there are angels sitting in every Empty Chairs my grandmother said ah I don't see nothing she said when all of a sudden her eyes were open and she saw angels sitting everywhere she was looking beyond what these eyes could see when we see this we understand that when man fell he didn't show up that day in the call of the evening to sit down and talk with the father that was the first time there was an empty chair on Earth and then as time went on Cain kills Abel and for the first time outside of the garden there was an empty chair at the dinner table for the first time Adam and Eve looked across the table one he had been killed our chair our Throne is our position it is our place it is our inheritance the empty chair groans listen to me closely this morning the empty chair groans waiting for the rightful owner is to take it and sit on it come on now I'm not just talking about a literal chair anymore I'm talking about The Throne of your heart oh creation is grown in the Bible says what a manifestation of the sons of God because only a son or daughter of God will invite and make ready on that seat or on that throne that's the purpose that the throne was created foreign to him that over even as overcame and I'm sat down with my father in history this is not just written here to work us up it's for us to take a rightful place for Christ to take his right correct now this is something tremendous because it's so true whatever your background might be especially if you come from the apostolic or Pentecostal realm is the people have been trained we were brother her brother Jerome talking about that yesterday the people have been trained that if you don't jump or shout in a church the Lord wasn't there right and it's exactly what was going on right yes everybody waiting for the climax why do you have to wait for it the climax should be the moment you walked into the church when your heart is prepared the climax already now now this is tremendous because it's just tremendo it makes us check ourselves I learned that as a young preacher I had just started to preacher and I preached in and it was very solemn if and then the next morning it was a fiery preacher and man the people were just wow it was it was so tremendous but it was tremendous and I remember my father saying there was a lot of movement today in the soul he says there was more and so thick the presence of the Lord yesterday that most people didn't even know what was going on that's when I learned not to judge a service by how much movement there is by how much dancing here's [Applause] we've been trained to think the opposite way an invasion of the USA he says they just got the people to just a bunch of worked up come on right and we gotta just keep on going keep on going until something happens we work the people up then as soon as the workup is over the first thing you know you can't find one of them what happened it was a great service brother Brown says you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost 24 hours a day let's still go to hell yeah because he promised to pour His Spirit upon All Flesh not all flesh is saved but if that Holy Spirit goes beyond this flesh passing the spiritual and goes down into the soul then you can now no more die than God thank you he says you can't find one of them and the church is sitting empty like like and then he makes this statement if a man loves Gods men women children if a man loves God his seat in the church he can't stay away from it how many of you have a responsibility we have a responsibility the message puts a responsibility on us but it's not how much responsibility we feel that yeah but it's how much responsibility that we're willing to take on is they mad there's the difference now how much responsibility just enough to be called a Christian Cristiano oh wow it's time it's Tiempo we stop trying to work people up in the church we don't want to be a bunch of sensationalists amen amen amen right did I get off on the right exit we are not sensationalists we are imparters of eternal life we have a responsibility you still want the infilling of the Holy Ghost it doesn't come because we jump and Shout it doesn't come with because we're jumping showers but we'll do that later too don't go away with it because then you're going to be late in our church we can't even say Amen no no now you're going to the opposite come bring it to the middle now you love the Lord all right it's about you coming to your place and the person how many know the Holy Ghost is the person and the person of the Holy Ghost coming and sitting on the throne of your heart no more Empty Chairs we've leaned too much on Sensations but this was one of the great Mysteries of the seventh Angels The Mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without a sensation this is a mystery how could the Holy Ghost baptize me without a sensation it's a mystery because when you're looking for this you're looking for emotions you're not looking at the right thing I was telling a young man the other day I said your giant comes to the valley for one reason he comes to die [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I'll say it again this giant comes to the valley for one purpose but then I asked him the question what is the valley what is it buddy what's the valley he comes to die in what is going to answer the question and I said I'll tell you what that Valley is giant dies in The Valley of decision come on now come on now we got to go a little farther now in the valley of decisions that's why brother Brown preaches the message the power of decisions that's right you have to decide that you want to serve the Lord you can't just stand here and just come to church thinking that's all there is no English you've got to make a decision you will serve the Lord everything else will die out it's the power of decisions and that's all the power you need to overcome the giant yes let's go on here yeah how many want to be filled are you sure okay tell your neighbor come on [Music] prophet of God says this he says and we can all say it all that God was Era yes or yes yes can you say it with me oh God what did he do Israel he poured it into Christ but there's a problem with that because then that would have left God empty goes on and says and says Christ was he loaded into the church the problem is that would have left Christ empty but brother says that's not the way he does it oh that God was he became Christ Church oh yeah she's not a separate entity from here he is him she's born [Applause] don't try to make us a separate entity we are the message of William Brown oh man how many want the in Philly the kenosis she became that is let me see how much time I got here all right what does the little bride then become Christ into the church what does that little bride become Messiah is the anointed one and if he was the Messiah by being the anointed one the Redeemer then when God raised up that body his bride is the anointed one for this day that's the Easter seal hello everybody the bride is the anointed one for this day and it's already raised with him in the resurrection because there are two of the two have now become one she tell your neighbors the anointed one for this day now tell your neighbor we are the anointed ones [Music] almost [Music] all right okay now watch now our sermon it's what he did now and the first thing then when Christ the anointed one in this age when he poured it all into the church the first thing that he poured into the church a good feeling a sensation he poured into the church first apostles that's right nobody in the message hardly wants to talk about Apostles no more well then they don't want everything that he poured into the church well what we don't need apostles the Apostle is the setter in order of the church how can you even have a church without an apostle setting it in order come out that's like saying I just want a little bit of it Lord I don't agree with that well the Bible says where he put it in the church where did he take it out the Apostle is the sent one and from the prophet that's the first thing that came forth that he said in the church is the first apostles then prophets teachers evangelist pastors notice this now and I want you to get this this is important when we find Philip Philip then is taken to who to the eunuch yeah yes that's right right hello everybody the eunuch was reading a prophet um named Isaiah he said yes and he's reading them he was taken to as a sheep to the slaughtered [Music] he was wounded for our transgression bruise foreign could he understand the Prophet this is the problem we have today we don't need preachers anymore we have the message but the eunuch was reading the message [Applause] now I want you to know how he reads in English he says he said how can I accept some man say it again except some Mansion guide me no guide me guys that's right amen I'm gonna say it again how can I understand what the prophet said let some man guide me who is the some man I'll tell you who the some man is placed in the church all right forgive me we're in Sunday School clinical okay [Applause] [Music] all right [Applause] [Applause] wow not even the batteries could put up like where's the Energizer we have the real Energizer will the bride have a Ministry yes see it's going on right now oh sure it's made up of Apostles but it would be a very humble Ministry it gets heavy all right but I know something else is going on in here you must accept the person of the Holy Ghost hello everybody you must accept the person of the Holy Ghost which is Jesus Christ in spirit form working through his body here on Earth now now watch this now I don't understand why how they say Don't Preach no more well if they're not called to preach that then Don't Preach that's okay if they're called to hand out a track I'm not against anyone that doesn't do that but when they try to get into our lane sorry I already took my place [Music] maybe it's a good thing maybe it's weeding out a lot of those that really weren't called to to preachers watch what brother Branham says in the message putting on the whole armor of God God fortified his army did you ever think what the office those offices in the church is God's dress is oh yeah amen this is this isn't exciting huh oh no I'm not feeling it no more oh yeah come on pinch yourself it's God's dress an apostle an apostle a prophet um foresee before Satan ever gets to it it's God dressed up in his church these offices is God's dress wear is that's God's dress where he says it's God's presence it's God's spirit working through man yeah come on now how many still want to get filled I know the Pastor said this but I don't think it's like that oh yeah the other day it was really funny a man who was watching this this man come to the to a doctor and he says is it okay if we take this my baby takes this and the doctor says yeah that would be okay but but you don't understand that you know I we did this and we did this but but should we still yes it's okay why did you even go to the doctor for her you had your own idea of what it is why did you even go to the pastor you have your idea of what you want to do anyway power of decision your idea to one side and you're willing to hear from God the power of decisions Jesus said he that receiveth you Jesus foreign [Applause] oh that was I read that I was like let me read that again I think the church has been preached to death he's not saying Don't Preach no more but what he's saying is that we we've gone just preaching preaching preaching and that's all good there's a place for that is to come back to the teachings amen the church has been preached to death and all they know is Sensations that's okay if you have no emotion you should be buried right we're not we're not robots oh but wait now he says the thing it needs is to come back to teaching and get in on the foundation fundamental so you know how to build yourself up in Christ Lord that's what the Apostle does in the church he places the foundation fundamental the scripture tells us that the foundation of Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ being the Chief Cornerstone they've rejected what Christ has put in the church we had a good time Holy Ghost but I don't care what the brother says I don't care what the but what the pastor says you're way off somewhere that's right right hello everybody come on now Thomas what'd you think you were going to get at the climax what did you think you were going to get on the fifth day okay what are you what were you expecting there is an expected end I better hurry up Ryan going to get to that they've been preached to death they got to get back on the foundation now show me where they even mentioned many times even mentioned in church that's all wonderful but don't take part of the word take all of it and watch what he says and we've built our churches our churches upon Sensations and upon different things but it can't be built upon nothing else the revelation of Jesus Christ might fill all things oh we're full of religion Church come on church we are full of religions I've been going to church for 40 years I've been going to church for 50 years what does that mean I don't understand what that means it's one of the worst spirits to get into the church come on you know you know what one of the one of the worst spirits in the churches the spirit of entitlement I've been in church and I I'm entitled to this the instruments all obedience to the Token is the only thing that will entitle you other than that there is you know I was I had gone to Israel a few months back I picked up a book was entitled listening to the language of the Bible it was a better understanding of how the Hebrews think I want you to do this because yeah okay I want you to see how shallow we are you know I I I'll say this in MIT MIT they did a study and they started to see if people could multitask yes I can do a lot of things at one time oh your person like wow that's amazing oh yeah I can do this [Music] and we feel good because we feel like we're doing something well the study came out and the results was this it is impossible for a human to multitask he said because the moment you try to do more than one thing the mind gets out of depth mode [Music] it gets out of Death Mode and goes into shallow mode so now we're doing a lot of things come on this is exactly what goes on in the homes this is why we fail in the holders there is no depth you're talking about church and we expect the pastor to do wonders yes but when they go back home to the same circumstances the same atmosphere what happens they lose all the traction they got at church [Applause] where's the depths David began to write calleth that's why we don't hear from God yes and the shallow calls into the shells come on this this is so tremendous to me in the Hebrew the word yada so then rather than just knowing information the Hebrew idea of Yara it stresses knowing from experience watch this now watch this now this is this is just so what the brother brought yesterday he just goes so good together now now watch this now we are a western people trying to understand an Eastern books let me put it in another way we are our religious people trying to understand the supernatural message come on Church notice observing when we do that it doesn't work we stress the intellectual part of hearings but we minimize the doing that the Bible says be not only hears of the word but doers so when we as westerners I hope you get this when we as westerners we use the word to know we think of our mental grasp of facts we think that the more facts we know about a subject the more we know about it do you know yeah let me explain to you in the beginning all of the old cheese I know all those things Hebrews don't look at it like that oh come on I'm getting something here with you now so then rather than just knowing information it stresses experience it stresses relationships and it stresses on acting on the knowledge you have received this is where the the biblical idea or concept comes from the knowledge of God what knowledge of God do you think you have or do I think I have come on it's for me too I know a lot about God brother okay let's see how shallow or deep your relationships Jesus said call upon me and I will ask watch this now observing this is where we learn they think the knowledge of God is to prove God's existence and establish a theological model to explain God's nature but the knowledge of God to the Hebrews is the relationship with God they view it having a life that is in relationship with him it's not just knowing who someone is that's even the problems in the homes been married 30 years and they still don't know their wife they still don't know their husbands oh they know them when they jump in bed forgive me I know there's children but that's all they want to know about it who is that person next to you I I know my wife I know my husband do you if you did you wouldn't have the problems that you have there's no depth in relationships [Music] a life in relationship it's not just the knowledge of knowing someone it is your Devotion to him you see Ben the juicy knowledge of God as intimacy with God that's why when we read Ephesians so we all come to the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the son of God that's right sonship the position it's an office come on now when you come to the knowledge of the Son of God what's your intimacy with him how deep does it go oh are we okay still Yes you want me to go on I can stop it's not to know how much facts or have how many facts about him you want to see how much you know how much do you know about his nature his character his mind now we're getting deeper you still want to get filled come on you still want to get filled it's the greatest message that has ever hit this planet Earth what did he come to do was to raise Jesus out of History I don't need anything else Christianity brother Branham says of today has become so shallow Oh but there's many a man he says coming down the road End of the Road we'll find out that that little shallow religion that you've been holding on it won't work nothing short of being born again it's got can't be a shell Affair something deep when I see this he says in the message Oneness what is it okay you've got to get with the word get yourself killed out here's the prophet I'm persuaded that many of us friends or you think it's enough because you're the friends with the pastor is friends with the propheta that many of us friends have received the Holy Ghost but we just received just enough holy ghosts to take us to a place where we don't want to lie and we don't want to steal we don't want to do anything [Music] but God wants to feel better God wants to feel every fiber of his church come on tell your neighbors neighbor he wants to fill every fibers he wants to feel your thinking he wants to fill your mind he wants to fill every bit of you make you totally get to yourself and if the power of the Resurrection The Very life of God as well that's what the Holy Ghost was given foreign that comes at such great speeds that there's a collision that takes place oh come on church if you open yourself up right now there's a collision that's about to take place come on now there's a collision because they're going right head on to each other I hear the sound of thunder I hear the sound of collisions going on there's a fight there's a battle going on let me see where I'm at oh yeah The Mercy Seat I won't get to this other part but that's okay but I want to just turn the corner and then I'm gonna I'm gonna end with this kingdom comes but I want to say this now we're take talking about the chair of the throne it's over a domain now the first Throne was where in heaven and it's yellow the second throne was in Christ amen the third throne maybe this is some maybe this is one of the problems you should know he says the third Throne is where is you you don't sound excited about it the heart Corazon but when we're watching football games oh yeah we're jumping up and down and we get to church yeah what happened to that person that gets all excited and then I hear people say all the time I just don't feel oh no I don't know I don't feel like the Lord even even knows about me I feel like the Lord has left me let me ask you you know where he lives come on Church come on now do you know where he lives if you don't know where he lives let me ask you where he lives he lives in my heart really see not like that he don't know the Bible tells us you know where he dwells I usually tell people it's the last time you praise and worshiped the Lord I don't remember the last time I raised my hands you don't know where he lives the Bible says he inhabits [Applause] Praise Him so why are we acting like we don't know where he's where he lives come on worship Him Praise Him and see if he doesn't come on the scene it moved from Heaven to Christ and Christ into um we're coming around the corner here so let's let's get this now why did the throne move it didn't move just because he wanted to move it from one page to the other part he had a plan he had a plan the throne moves because the life is moving yeah the throne moves because the life is moving creation all right let that one soak in for a little bit and because it's moving all the time had to have Wills oh oh yeah the throne had to have wheels it ain't by a chance that you put wheels on this baby I walk in and I'm like yeah brother Caleb those got to be like 26s oh yeah yeah baby roll it it ain't by chance nothing happens by chance but rolls it has wheels the throne has wheels it's settled in a tabernacle one day and then it went to another tablet but some days the holy spirit will come to dwell in the hearts of the people and one word against it will never be forgiveness The Mercy Seat when he was sitting on The Mercy Seat the seat spoke it said oh there's Mercy right now but the moment he get up off The Mercy Seat the empty chair also speaks and it says it's judgment time foreign behold one will upon the Earth by the living creatures with his four faces and the appearance of the wheels and their work it wasn't like unto the color of barrel they had four and they four had one likenessa and their appearance and their work was as it were a will in the middle of the world this is the wheel in the middle of the wheel oh my god let's see where this is going to take us now whirling Wheels the Throne of God moving from Heaven to Earth through the heart of man and the wills are turning because it's on a journey and it's looking for its destinations it's looking for the place of contact come on is that you is you've experienced the wheel in the middle of the world what does it produce it produces a whirlwind foreign what think ye of Christ the message what thinking of Christ he said when I saw him he was a will in the middle of the world standing way in the middle of the air in other words the whole creation was revolving around the Hub of that wheel any new creation here it was revolving around the center or the house what is he doing Gathering you to himself but the same way that the Whirlwind those that believe him the ones that disbelieve me he's either Gathering you to himself oh Lord I tell you what that should make us so serious when we walk through those doors [Applause] contact wow you want to know what the will in the middle of the will is you say it's Christ of course brother Brown says oh that middle of the wheel that little inside soul is on the inside of your spirit that's all if it hasn't been quickened isn't moving meaning you ain't going nowhere he saw it love you and then he says but when he puts his Spirit new spirit yes and then he puts his spirit that new spirit brings new life and the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit goes right in the center of that Spirit now these wheels I'll tell you this this is the Ezekiel 1 4. and I looked immediate and behold a whirlwind came out of the North maybe that was North America North America just says North here this is Whirlwind came out of the North oh a great Cloud come on somebody help me out you know a great cloud and I gotta get a picture of that ah no that nothing could happen it was a bunch of jets and it was blah blah blah blah and I'm like really look at that yeah you don't have a brother that's okay you you all know it says he says the great cloud and the fire in folding itself in the midst of the color of amber and out of the midst of the fire it's unfolding you listen to this in understanding this when Jesus came he was the very Tabernacle of God died on the cross his body spirit and soul were ripped apart and then it seemed like the wheel wasn't gonna turn anymore but on the day of 10 foreign is it is a consuming fire our God is a consuming foreign you haven't been consumed because the day that he consumes the day he consumes you yeah [Music] what caused the Russian Mighty winds the Turning of the wheels he's moving it to the heart of man and it's Gathering Earth yes or gathering dust I mean you know that's how clouds are formed right yeah foreign [Music] and when the cloud is formed God says now I'll write it oh I'll write it you think I'm just kidding or what Psalms 104 3 says who make it the clouds his chariot you get that you didn't get that no he didn't make it the clouds his Chariot what is this Cloud oh come on Church what forms the crowd the Whirlwind what formed the cloud the Whirlwind what created the Whirlwind the wheel in the middle of the world it takes as it whirling it takes dust from here it separates it from all the impurities and it gathers it to become and or form the clouds and God formed man of the Dust is because thou has done this is but I'm here to tell you foreign Espino foreign is to see this and we have seen it in our day I'm going to say that again it's not something that's coming it's something that's already here how many how many are looking for something it is in the message of the hour all I'm saying is that the message ain't good enough everything we need because you have become the destination I say this now as we're ending there's so much to preach about so much to talk about but when the holy spirit says that's enough that's enough but I will tell you this now you understand not really the infillingness it's not just a feel-good religion that has returned upon the worshipers I like this the worshiper once purged not the church hello
