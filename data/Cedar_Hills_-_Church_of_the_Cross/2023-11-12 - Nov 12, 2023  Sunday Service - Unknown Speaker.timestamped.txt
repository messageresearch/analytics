[33:53] amen
[33:54] so not to keep you standing too much
[33:57] longer let's go ahead and read the
[33:58] scripture in first John
[34:09] 4 very wellknown
[34:13] scripture and read give you a little bit
[34:16] of time to find
[34:21] it ready and it says
[34:24] beloved who's he talking about right
[34:26] there
[34:30] beloved I guess not
[34:33] everybody one more time
[34:35] beloved who's he speaking
[34:37] to believe not every Spirit but try the
[34:41] spirit Spirits where the there of God
[34:43] because many false prophets are gone
[34:44] into the
[34:52] world verse
[34:54] two hereby know ye remember those words
[34:59] know ye the spirit of God every spirit
[35:02] that confessed that Jesus Christ is come
[35:05] in the flesh is of
[35:17] God and every spirit that confesses not
[35:20] that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh
[35:22] is not of
[35:25] God
[35:31] and this is that Spirit of antichrist
[35:34] wherefore ye have heard it heard that it
[35:36] should come and even now already is in
[35:39] the
[35:46] world but ye a ye are of
[35:54] God little children and have overcome
[35:57] them because greater is he that is in
[36:01] you than he that is in the
[36:11] world of the world therefore they speak
[36:14] they of the world and the world heareth
[36:21] them we are of
[36:25] God one more time we are of
[36:29] God watch keep this this line in in in
[36:33] uh in your in your mind
[36:36] okay he that knoweth God heareth
[36:44] us he that is not of God Hearth not
[36:49] us hereby know know we the spirit of
[36:53] truth and the spirit of error
[37:00] you may be
[37:02] seated and as always we want to we want
[37:04] to thank the pastor for for having the
[37:06] confidence to to let us
[37:15] speak surely he knows it seems like he
[37:17] knows us better than we know
[37:21] ourselves because in with in everyday
[37:25] life there's many things that we battle
[37:29] with and uh you know the the title there
[37:32] they put it
[37:35] up the hidden
[37:38] gospel with a subtitle fear
[37:41] not so many things that we go through in
[37:47] life many battles that we go through
[37:50] daily it seems like many times many ups
[37:53] and
[37:55] downs
[37:58] many times we're on the
[38:00] mountain many times we're in the
[38:04] valley and and look all around
[38:07] you and it seems like there's a total
[38:09] collapse of
[38:13] everything we're not
[38:18] okay total collapse of the
[38:22] nation total collapse of the
[38:25] economy
[38:27] total collapse of the
[38:30] dollar total collapse of
[38:33] morals total collapse of
[38:36] values it's completely falling
[38:40] apart the world is already fallen
[38:44] apart amen amen and it's a fearful thing
[38:49] right does it does it worry
[38:52] you does it worry you to see all the
[38:54] sickness around you
[38:58] do we get
[38:59] scared or do we
[39:02] fear oh the
[39:04] pandemic still coming
[39:07] on still going
[39:10] on there seems like there is a new
[39:12] variant every other
[39:15] month they're already talking about the
[39:17] next one
[39:20] coming what do we
[39:22] do what do we do as a
[39:25] people and and I also wanted to
[39:27] apologize for the last time I
[39:32] spoke before I
[39:36] proceed I I spoke a little bit about
[39:40] Ai and I got a lot of
[39:43] feedback a lot of people were worried
[39:45] about
[39:48] that a lot of people they got scared of
[39:53] that and I felt bad because that wasn't
[39:57] my
[39:58] intention my intention is not to put
[40:01] fear in
[40:03] you my sole
[40:06] intention is just to make us all aware
[40:08] of what's going
[40:12] on to let us
[40:14] know that we have to get closer to
[40:18] God now fear is known as a as a negative
[40:21] term and it
[40:25] is but the scripture also
[40:28] says the fear of
[40:30] God is the beginning of
[40:35] wisdom how does that
[40:38] work I thought I thought we weren't
[40:40] supposed to
[40:44] fear brother Brandon mentions the word
[40:46] fear about over 1300 times in the
[40:51] message I I I forget I I know there's
[40:54] instances of fear in the Bible
[41:01] and they're talking about it being about
[41:02] 365 in certain
[41:06] instances
[41:11] 30 that that 365
[41:16] days right one instance for each day of
[41:19] the
[41:20] year but then he tells you not to fear
[41:23] to fear the lord to fear God
[41:26] how does that
[41:27] work I thought that wasn't we weren't
[41:29] supposed to
[41:33] fear the pastor gets up on on Wednesday
[41:35] after brother Ron's
[41:40] message mention some pretty heavy
[41:43] stuff on things that are going
[41:46] on how many got
[41:49] scared how many got
[41:53] worried you don't have to answer it
[41:55] within yourself you know have
[41:59] so just just follow me a little bit
[42:01] okay now the Lord wants he wants that
[42:04] fear of the
[42:07] Lord so referring back to
[42:11] Wednesday he'll put a little scare in
[42:16] you I'm not talking about
[42:21] fear I'm I'm I'm not speaking of fear on
[42:24] this instance
[42:28] but sometimes he has to put a little bit
[42:30] of scare in
[42:36] US is why does he do
[42:39] that sometimes he has to get our
[42:43] attention sometimes he has to get my
[42:47] attention brother Jerry is very
[42:50] thickheaded
[42:52] Jer right brother Jerry you know you
[42:54] know this brother Jerry gonzale is very
[43:02] thickheaded he doesn't like a lot he
[43:04] doesn't like people telling him what to
[43:05] do many
[43:09] times so but but we know that we go
[43:12] around
[43:14] life and everyone tells us what to
[43:17] do the the the pastors here as a head
[43:20] for to the
[43:23] church if you work for somebody you have
[43:25] to listen to to
[43:28] them so I I got to get this little tough
[43:31] boy mentality
[43:37] brother that's not the
[43:39] case but sometimes he has to put a
[43:41] little bit of just a little bit scare
[43:43] you just a little
[43:46] bit because you know you know that to be
[43:49] scared in the natural
[43:54] body is actually something that could be
[43:59] helpful what happens when something
[44:01] frightens you it scares
[44:04] you oh there's a dangerous person or
[44:10] situation oh that dog could bite
[44:13] me oh it scares me so it what it does is
[44:17] your body has a natural
[44:22] reaction comes a little bit of
[44:24] adrenaline adrenaline into you
[44:29] why does it do that because it makes us
[44:33] alert it brings you to an em a
[44:39] response a fight or
[44:43] flight right you get scared and your
[44:45] body you react right
[44:51] away you're going to encounter the
[44:54] issue or you're going to run
[44:57] away so the Lord puts a little bit of
[45:00] fear in
[45:02] you so that we can fight off Satan's
[45:08] traps run away from that
[45:11] situation and run to that strong
[45:15] tower that's that's in the
[45:17] natural so now I'm not talking about
[45:20] fear that's
[45:22] different but he likes say he likes to
[45:24] scare you just a little bit
[45:27] keep us on our
[45:30] toes how many understand
[45:34] that what exactly is
[45:38] fear then we're going to going to turn
[45:41] the flip the coin on the other side
[45:44] now we know fear is a spirit right
[45:46] brother
[45:50] dieo brother Diego told us fear is it's
[45:52] a he's a little
[45:54] demon
[45:57] and he goes
[45:58] around and he feeds off of fear off of
[46:02] your
[46:05] fear but let me let me get to this first
[46:09] here what what is fear
[46:13] exactly an unpleasant put the definition
[46:16] up brothers please just so you can get a
[46:18] visual of it it's an unpleasant often
[46:22] strong emotion caused by anticipation or
[46:24] awareness of danger
[46:35] an instance of this
[46:37] emotion a state marked by this
[46:42] emotion anxious
[46:45] concern reason for
[46:48] alarm or like the one we just talked
[46:50] about a uh profound
[46:54] reverence
[46:57] the other day the Lord the way I got
[46:59] this
[47:02] thought we were going to bed the other
[47:04] night probably about two weeks
[47:08] ago and my wife told me I heard
[47:11] something so I got up kind of you know
[47:15] frantic I got up but it was weird
[47:20] because fear entered into my
[47:24] body I never felt it like
[47:27] that but I got up and I was like nervous
[47:29] I was even almost
[47:32] shaking it was
[47:38] debilitating and then all of a sudden
[47:40] just went
[47:41] away and the word fear came to
[47:44] me okay I didn't think anything of
[47:47] it but then I heard I was talking to a
[47:51] brother the other
[47:53] day and he told me I've been studying
[47:59] something I told yeah me too I let him
[48:01] speak
[48:05] first yeah he says I've been studying
[48:07] the word
[48:12] fear I was okay that's kind of that's
[48:14] that's
[48:16] strange is that right brother
[48:18] Daniel me and Daniel were like kind of
[48:20] okay so I didn't think nothing of
[48:24] it and then the other day when we had a
[48:28] service we came up to the
[48:31] altar I believe it's just
[48:35] alcia when she spoke with no more
[48:41] fear okay so so it hit me
[48:44] again okay so I'm like there's something
[48:47] here
[48:49] right me and the stick
[48:53] skull I mean I mean yeah me and the
[48:57] thick
[49:00] skull okay so so then we spoke about
[49:02] brother Caleb talked about on Wednesday
[49:04] after the
[49:09] preaching I said I was in the
[49:12] back I if he mentions the word
[49:16] fear I know it's you Lord after the
[49:20] other 10 times that
[49:22] that so sure enough
[49:26] he mentions the word
[49:28] fear says okay
[49:31] Lord I'll I'll I'll look into
[49:34] it and I'll give the people my
[49:38] experience help the
[49:40] people not to scare
[49:46] anybody it's it's not for that if we
[49:49] speak anything is to help
[49:52] you it's to make you
[49:54] alert you get you thinking you get you
[49:58] running to the things of the
[50:01] Lord because the problem is if you get a
[50:03] scared in the body that's
[50:08] okay the problem
[50:11] starts when it starts to tap into the
[50:13] spirit
[50:16] now watch this put put up the the The
[50:20] List Brothers of
[50:24] the see to be frightened or scared in
[50:26] the flesh will cause you to be
[50:29] alert right we see the SE taste here
[50:31] smell touch we know senses of the
[50:38] body put the one for the
[50:42] spirit this is where it gets
[50:46] tricky
[50:48] conscious
[50:51] reason
[50:53] imagination memory I I put imagination
[50:56] twice I what the the other one was
[50:59] but yeah I put imagination twice sorry
[51:03] but you you get the you get the picture
[51:07] right so you see fear now start to creep
[51:11] in start to hit your spirit
[51:15] now your conscience is
[51:19] uh I remember
[51:21] this I remember I did
[51:24] that so that conscience is always always
[51:26] has you worried watching your
[51:31] back reason you're always always
[51:33] reasoning with
[51:37] everything but this is this is the one
[51:39] here that will get
[51:42] you
[51:45] imagination when fear hits you in your
[51:50] spirit and it Taps into
[51:54] imagination
[51:56] you start to make things up in your
[52:01] mind we we're in the
[52:04] dark oh maybe there's a the boogeyman's
[52:07] goingon to get
[52:09] me you start to think that way
[52:12] right you know us Hispanics growing
[52:16] up a little bit of little bit of a of
[52:20] not it's not a joke but just to kind of
[52:21] relax you a
[52:24] little so you're all there on the bed
[52:26] and your and your legs hanging there on
[52:27] the
[52:30] bed and you're like whenever something's
[52:32] under the
[52:35] bed scares you
[52:38] right
[52:40] imagination so I know that's like I said
[52:42] just a little bit of of a joke for you
[52:44] to relax you
[52:46] but you have to be careful with
[52:50] that I have to be careful with that
[52:53] because if it starts to hit my
[52:54] imagination
[52:57] then I start to think that I have
[52:59] something that I
[53:02] don't oh maybe I have a a
[53:06] cough maybe maybe all this I get a pain
[53:08] on the
[53:10] side oh maybe maybe it's cancer I don't
[53:13] know maybe it's a sickness I don't
[53:16] know it begins to work in your
[53:19] mind to the point where it starts to
[53:22] affect your
[53:24] body because when you're in constant
[53:27] state of
[53:31] fear when you're
[53:33] anxious when you're
[53:36] worried you know those are also types of
[53:41] fear those are synonymous words for
[53:45] fear and Satan uses those
[53:49] tools to keep the Believers
[53:53] bound why because then the spirit goes
[53:56] into the
[53:58] body constantly
[54:00] worried
[54:02] upset
[54:04] fussing all these things brother brand
[54:06] say those things cause cancer he
[54:10] said because those when you're when you
[54:13] have that and it hits your
[54:16] body it starts to pump what's called
[54:19] cortisol into your
[54:21] body I don't know that cortisol
[54:29] it's it's a hormone in your
[54:32] body so when you're in this constant
[54:34] state of fight or
[54:38] flight caused by
[54:40] fear caused by
[54:43] worry by stress by
[54:46] anxiety this this hormone is constantly
[54:48] pumping in your
[54:51] body but what it
[54:53] does starts to cause inflammation
[54:56] register in your
[54:58] body certain it inflames certain cells
[55:02] in your
[55:05] body and it makes you more prone to for
[55:12] them that they turn into cancer
[55:17] cells right you know brother Caleb told
[55:20] me this information I couldn't find
[55:24] it
[55:25] but I I thought it goes with
[55:27] this he says I don't know how many years
[55:31] back they took the breathing rate of a
[55:38] human is compared to
[55:41] today and they say the breathing rate
[55:43] has
[55:47] increased why fire
[55:51] flight they said to be frighting for a
[55:54] moment is okay
[55:56] for but when it has become the norm in
[55:59] our
[56:01] lives when we live in those
[56:05] conditions then we I wonder why we're
[56:10] sick you're you're stressed out you're
[56:14] tired we're
[56:16] exhausted why because we're
[56:20] constantly fight or fight
[56:23] mode and the the thing is this a lot of
[56:27] times we fight with one
[56:30] another we run from the things of the
[56:34] Lord instead of running to
[56:37] him we're we're we run away from
[56:41] him then we wonder why we're
[56:44] sick we wonder why we're in constant
[56:48] fear that can still be
[56:52] uprooted but the problem the real
[56:56] problem is when
[56:58] fear starts to creep into the
[57:01] soul and it manifests
[57:04] itself in the form of
[57:08] doubt now many times there's certain
[57:13] things I have done to make myself
[57:17] sick and because I don't change my
[57:21] habits then I start to doubt God
[57:25] Lord why don't you help
[57:27] me when I created the
[57:31] problem I start to doubt him remember in
[57:35] the
[57:36] soul there's only one of two things in
[57:39] there only one of two things can
[57:43] exist and that is
[57:46] Faith or
[57:49] doubt fear
[57:52] not fear
[57:56] watch the acronym of fear brother Daniel
[57:58] gave me
[58:00] this you want to put it up Brothers just
[58:02] to get a
[58:04] visual the
[58:08] acronym the acronym of fear right f e a
[58:13] r it's false
[58:16] evidence appearing
[58:23] real and that the truth
[58:26] ain't that what happens in the
[58:29] spirit
[58:31] imagination and it starts to
[58:35] trigger what do we
[58:37] do you know I heard the news the other
[58:40] day and it it hurt
[58:49] me you know when when when we heard
[58:52] about brother
[58:53] Diego
[58:55] and I'll tell you
[58:57] why because if there's somebody that has
[58:59] been by my
[59:02] side when my mother was sick in
[59:08] hospital anytime I'm just mentioning a
[59:10] certain
[59:12] time in Co he was there he was there
[59:16] for many were there but but but the way
[59:20] the way he was there I I want to give
[59:21] him a little bit of
[59:23] flower
[59:25] okay throughout our journey
[59:28] okay and I want to appreciate everybody
[59:30] that took
[59:34] part of my wife's baby
[59:40] shower
[59:41] baby yesterday was
[59:44] beautiful I want to thank each and every
[59:46] one of you that had a hand in it
[59:49] everybody you you blessed us
[59:53] greatly you know how many times that I
[59:57] hear the people say oh those are our
[1:00:01] babies all in this
[1:00:04] together and I appreciate
[1:00:06] that I really really appreciate that
[1:00:10] because you feel the love of the
[1:00:13] people because this has been a
[1:00:16] journey and you have
[1:00:18] worried fear has hit me many
[1:00:23] times many times like I said I've
[1:00:25] imagined
[1:00:28] things even to the
[1:00:30] point where where where the thought
[1:00:33] tries to come
[1:00:35] in says oh my gosh you have twins
[1:00:39] coming at 46 years
[1:00:43] old
[1:00:48] worry so you you know you think of these
[1:00:50] things
[1:00:52] right I want to be an open book okay
[1:00:55] you know I'm not going to sit here and
[1:00:56] tell you that I that that I got any
[1:00:58] answers to
[1:01:02] anything but it worried
[1:01:06] me part of the inspiration of this
[1:01:08] message was when I called brother
[1:01:12] Diego I call him brother dieo how are
[1:01:17] you I'm checking on you just to just to
[1:01:19] know I want you to know that I'm there
[1:01:21] for
[1:01:23] you
[1:01:25] the way you've been by my
[1:01:27] side I want to stand by your
[1:01:30] side but he got the
[1:01:33] news and I thought he was going to be
[1:01:37] done anybody knows I talks to brother
[1:01:40] Diego he's very upbeat very
[1:01:46] happy I was watching his noticing his
[1:01:49] voice it didn't skip a
[1:01:53] beat
[1:01:59] uh you want to know how it is to combat
[1:02:06] fear you want to know how to combat
[1:02:10] it you don't you want to know what that
[1:02:12] looks
[1:02:14] like if you
[1:02:17] stand look at
[1:02:23] him he did not skip a
[1:02:28] beat what's inside of
[1:02:30] him gotten a hold of
[1:02:33] something that's why when fear should
[1:02:35] have hit
[1:02:36] him he says fear I will be your fear
[1:02:41] now I talk to him and I was
[1:02:45] amazed that someone could act that
[1:02:48] way in the face of the news he's
[1:02:53] gotten but brother what what are you
[1:02:56] going to tell the
[1:02:59] cancer what did you tell
[1:03:05] him people say oh brother Diego you have
[1:03:07] a problem because you have
[1:03:10] cancer no no no you you you have it
[1:03:13] misplaced now cancer has a
[1:03:17] problem because cancer is
[1:03:20] death and it is written in the
[1:03:23] Bible that's right I will be your
[1:03:26] death thank you
[1:03:29] brother but I saw another tremendous
[1:03:33] scene when they brought him to pray for
[1:03:35] him in the
[1:03:37] front I saw the pastor and the ministry
[1:03:39] put hands on
[1:03:42] him then I see him turn around and see
[1:03:44] brother
[1:03:47] Fabio then he begins to pray for brother
[1:03:50] fa but it didn't stop there I saw
[1:03:53] brother Fabi turned
[1:03:55] around and he began to pray for
[1:03:58] brother why because there's no fear in
[1:04:01] this
[1:04:02] men because they have found
[1:04:05] him you know the greatest fear of a
[1:04:07] human
[1:04:10] is is the fear of the
[1:04:13] unknown what happens after we
[1:04:16] die I'm sick what's going to
[1:04:18] happen I don't have money how am I going
[1:04:20] to pay the
[1:04:21] bills oh nobody loves me
[1:04:25] imagination but when you find
[1:04:28] him you find him there is no
[1:04:32] fear it's the hidden
[1:04:35] gospel it's hidden it was God above
[1:04:39] us but people were
[1:04:41] scared because he would speak and the
[1:04:44] mountains were
[1:04:46] shame they were
[1:04:47] scared so the
[1:04:50] Moses you will be God to the
[1:04:53] people an identification right there he
[1:04:56] had to put Flesh on it God seeing
[1:05:00] that He sent Jesus
[1:05:03] Christ created a body dwelt in
[1:05:07] Jesus and he showed
[1:05:10] us he made the
[1:05:12] way he eradicated
[1:05:16] fear took over
[1:05:19] everything death hell and the
[1:05:23] grave that's the only reason we're able
[1:05:25] to talk about
[1:05:27] this or talk like
[1:05:30] this because of him it's no
[1:05:34] man it's him we just have to find
[1:05:38] him where is he
[1:05:41] today God above
[1:05:43] us God With Us was
[1:05:47] crucified began to fear again because he
[1:05:51] left what do we do don't fear I'll send
[1:05:56] you another
[1:05:58] comforter I'll send you another
[1:06:01] comforter send back his
[1:06:03] Spirit where is the spirit
[1:06:06] today God Came In the Flesh in Jesus
[1:06:11] Christ the scripture says God was
[1:06:13] manifested In the Flesh in Jesus
[1:06:17] Christ scripture that we read in
[1:06:20] John says now that Jesus is coming flesh
[1:06:26] has Jesus come in your
[1:06:28] flesh that's where it's
[1:06:31] hidden hidden
[1:06:33] gospel the word many people read the
[1:06:36] Bible and it's hidden from the wise and
[1:06:38] The
[1:06:41] Prudent but I got this title from
[1:06:43] Brother
[1:06:45] Tommy he preaches not the hidden word we
[1:06:47] know
[1:06:50] that he preaches the hidden gospel
[1:06:55] it's hidden in
[1:06:57] those that make the
[1:07:00] word do what it said he was going to
[1:07:02] [Applause]
[1:07:04] do amen the hidden
[1:07:07] gospel is hidden in you and
[1:07:10] I but it's no longer
[1:07:14] hidden amen amen you follow me a little
[1:07:18] bit Hebrews
[1:07:22] 1:1
[1:07:25] God who in sunnd Dr times and diverse
[1:07:28] matters spake in times passed by the
[1:07:31] fathers by the
[1:07:38] prophets in these last
[1:07:41] days spoken unto
[1:07:44] us by his
[1:07:45] son
[1:07:47] amen we know that God had one
[1:07:51] son and that was Jesus Christ but now
[1:07:54] Jesus
[1:07:55] Christ had many sons
[1:07:58] in so where is he
[1:08:01] speaking when we didn't know
[1:08:04] him when there was
[1:08:06] fear maybe he spoke by the prophets back
[1:08:11] then in this last
[1:08:14] time he spoke he's speaking to us by the
[1:08:19] sun Jesus
[1:08:21] Christ come in your flesh
[1:08:25] amen amen that make sense a little
[1:08:31] bit try to find
[1:08:34] this act 17
[1:08:43] 2022 we'll just do to save
[1:08:52] time 7 uh
[1:08:56] 23 for as I passed by and beheld your
[1:09:00] devotions I found an altar with the
[1:09:03] inscription to the unknown
[1:09:15] God whom therefore ye ignorantly worship
[1:09:18] Him declare I unto
[1:09:22] you
[1:09:30] to the unknown
[1:09:33] God is he still unknown
[1:09:39] today I'll tell you one thing if he's
[1:09:41] unknown in our
[1:09:43] lives it's no wonder why we're
[1:09:46] scared no wonder we have
[1:09:50] fear remember the
[1:09:52] human he fears what he doesn't
[1:09:56] know but if we find
[1:09:59] him search the
[1:10:02] scriptures in them you for in them um
[1:10:07] you think you have eternal
[1:10:11] life and and we heard think not is well
[1:10:14] I thought I had it or you think you have
[1:10:16] it
[1:10:19] no your thinking faculty is
[1:10:22] that
[1:10:24] that's the only ways we got to find
[1:10:28] him the only way you're going to find
[1:10:32] him is in his
[1:10:35] word Daniel says I I he knew the time by
[1:10:38] the reading of
[1:10:44] books these books
[1:10:46] only or reading the
[1:10:49] books reading the
[1:10:51] message remember the message and the
[1:10:53] message messenger are
[1:10:56] one you know that's the beauty of this
[1:11:01] message Paul says to the inscription of
[1:11:03] the unknown
[1:11:06] God but thanks be to
[1:11:09] God that we have a
[1:11:13] prophet he used to be
[1:11:16] unknown but this Prophet lifted him up
[1:11:19] out of
[1:11:21] History he tied up the Loose Ends
[1:11:25] the mystery should be finished
[1:11:28] right it say should because
[1:11:30] it's is the mystery still in
[1:11:36] you it's subed to each one each one has
[1:11:39] to answer
[1:11:41] that but this message of the
[1:11:44] hour he came to put a face to the name
[1:11:50] amen oh Moses you will be God to the
[1:11:53] people
[1:11:55] the great God came in Jesus
[1:12:00] Christ the holy spirit in
[1:12:05] people is showing you where he was
[1:12:09] hidden today under the
[1:12:13] dispensation of the Holy
[1:12:15] Ghost we know that he transferred his
[1:12:20] kingdom it's in the heart of the
[1:12:22] believer
[1:12:24] is it in the heart of
[1:12:27] Jerry is it in your
[1:12:30] heart is it in your
[1:12:33] hearten amen you know what what do we
[1:12:38] do many times we we we go around I'm
[1:12:46] have all
[1:12:51] right but but but watch this
[1:12:55] many times we think that we can that
[1:12:57] it's our works that get us
[1:13:01] there watch this great
[1:13:06] conqueror we we've heard of Alexander
[1:13:08] the Great
[1:13:12] right one of the greatest conquerors
[1:13:14] this
[1:13:18] world but when he found his
[1:13:22] end know that on his
[1:13:26] deathbed he had three
[1:13:31] wishes and and the first one
[1:13:34] was that only his Physicians carry his
[1:13:37] dead
[1:13:42] body number
[1:13:44] two the path leading to to his
[1:13:50] grave be adorned with precious stones of
[1:13:53] gold
[1:13:58] and the third one and the most strange
[1:13:59] of them
[1:14:03] all that both his hands
[1:14:08] opened both hands be
[1:14:11] open and that they be left dangling
[1:14:13] outside his
[1:14:18] cof so his generals asked him why such
[1:14:21] strange requests
[1:14:27] and he
[1:14:29] replied he wanted to show that by making
[1:14:32] Physicians carry his
[1:14:37] body people understood that no doctor
[1:14:39] could be
[1:14:44] death he desired the path to his grave
[1:14:47] be
[1:14:51] adorned with Treasures to show
[1:14:56] people that although he spent most of
[1:14:59] his life chasing Riches of the
[1:15:06] world he had to leave them all
[1:15:11] behind and
[1:15:13] thirdly he wanted both his hands open
[1:15:16] and out of the
[1:15:20] coffin to show he would be leaving this
[1:15:23] world
[1:15:24] World
[1:15:27] empty-handed just like he when he was
[1:15:33] born imagine such a great
[1:15:39] conqueror met his
[1:15:42] end but when doctors
[1:15:47] stop when your money can do no good for
[1:15:49] you no
[1:15:51] longer when science
[1:15:53] stops that's where God takes over
[1:15:56] right and it's something with this
[1:16:00] message it's not the unknown
[1:16:03] anymore even to the
[1:16:05] point where brother Bram was
[1:16:07] saying don't fear
[1:16:09] cancer he exposed
[1:16:12] it why because it would no longer be
[1:16:17] unknown fear of the human is the
[1:16:22] unknown
[1:16:27] amen
[1:16:28] amen
[1:16:30] so excuse me so that's that's the
[1:16:36] thing we have to get
[1:16:39] there we have to
[1:16:41] understand what is it that he's
[1:16:43] requiring of
[1:16:46] us he's requiring of us to
[1:16:49] believe he's requiring of us to stand on
[1:16:52] his word
[1:16:55] he's requiring of us to push out all
[1:16:58] unbelief and
[1:17:01] doubt why because we heard on
[1:17:04] Wednesday eternity is
[1:17:09] imperfect well it's imperfect
[1:17:12] where in us well this flesh Ain perfect
[1:17:16] this
[1:17:17] guy but what's inside of
[1:17:19] us so if we can begin to perfect him
[1:17:25] as we begin to get together and unite
[1:17:28] more it begins to push out the
[1:17:31] imperfectness in our
[1:17:35] body perfect love castes all fear
[1:17:40] away there's no room for cancer
[1:17:44] brother it cannot it cannot be in that
[1:17:49] environment that's the problem is we
[1:17:50] have to get that environment
[1:17:55] so that none of
[1:17:58] this
[1:18:00] hatred fear despair uh anxiety an
[1:18:06] depression depression stress and my my
[1:18:10] big
[1:18:11] one
[1:18:13] worry to where those things have no
[1:18:17] room eternity begins to push out the
[1:18:21] hickey
[1:18:24] and each one of us
[1:18:25] first it begins to push the
[1:18:27] imperfections
[1:18:29] out amen amen before we can gather all
[1:18:36] together and be in one
[1:18:39] Accord and be in one Accord for
[1:18:43] real the differences have to be pushed
[1:18:51] out have to be pushed out of this
[1:18:55] body talking about nobody
[1:18:58] else the imperfections of this guy
[1:19:02] right so Alexander the
[1:19:06] Great great man great
[1:19:09] conqueror but he was not the mighty
[1:19:13] conqueror I know of another
[1:19:15] one that without
[1:19:18] money he conquered
[1:19:20] death nothing could stop him
[1:19:24] he went and he took the keys from
[1:19:28] Satan conquered death and
[1:19:32] hell and it didn't only stop
[1:19:35] there he imparted it to you and
[1:19:38] I that's the difference between Muhammad
[1:19:40] and all these other
[1:19:43] ones we there's an empty
[1:19:48] grave he didn't keep it to
[1:19:51] himself he made it known to each and
[1:19:53] every one
[1:19:55] of so that it would no longer be the
[1:19:57] hidden
[1:19:59] gospel so that you would be the
[1:20:02] gospel you are the good
[1:20:05] news have to be good news to one
[1:20:15] another and and finishing
[1:20:20] here Revelations 10 BC alypsis
[1:20:31] yes 104 what start four
[1:20:34] yes and when the seven Thunders uttered
[1:20:37] their voices I was about to write I
[1:20:40] Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me
[1:20:42] seal up those things which the seven
[1:20:44] Thunders uttered and write them
[1:20:51] not
[1:20:59] and then probably the most famous
[1:21:00] scripture in Malachi
[1:21:04] 45 watch this but in the days of the
[1:21:10] voice they didn't say the day of the
[1:21:13] Angel no it
[1:21:15] is in the
[1:21:17] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:21:22] when he shall begin to
[1:21:25] sound the mystery or the
[1:21:31] unknown should be
[1:21:34] finished as he had declared to Servants
[1:21:36] of
[1:21:38] prophets watch this though this got me
[1:21:41] here sound when he begins to sound
[1:21:45] uh yes he sounded son yes he
[1:21:50] sounded but watch watch
[1:21:53] sound
[1:21:56] I sound okay one of the one of the
[1:22:00] definitions of
[1:22:03] sound to put into
[1:22:06] words
[1:22:08] voice voice right Voice uttered by those
[1:22:11] seven
[1:22:13] Thunders watch this and put it up
[1:22:15] brother so they can read
[1:22:18] it watch the second
[1:22:21] one
[1:22:27] I mean told him I didn't tell him about
[1:22:29] that one but watch this put into words
[1:22:34] sound this blew me away sound was to
[1:22:39] make
[1:22:42] known the hidden
[1:22:45] gospel no
[1:22:47] more to make
[1:22:49] known and to
[1:22:51] Proclaim
[1:22:53] haven't these messages been coming forth
[1:22:55] from behind this
[1:22:58] Pulpit have they not been
[1:23:01] thundering they would always ask and
[1:23:04] brother Fabio he would preach this many
[1:23:07] times also brother Tommy and brother
[1:23:11] ber and they would always say are the
[1:23:14] Thunders
[1:23:15] revealed he said yes or no right see you
[1:23:18] know he says they are revealing the the
[1:23:25] all I know is that Thunder is the voice
[1:23:27] of
[1:23:29] God and all I see is thundering from
[1:23:32] behind this
[1:23:36] Pulpit the messages that our pastor has
[1:23:38] been bringing
[1:23:41] forth and the
[1:23:43] ministry they're thundering to me that's
[1:23:47] all I see is
[1:23:48] thunder a
[1:23:50] preparation it's making him know
[1:23:54] who he is and where he is
[1:23:57] today and he's thundering
[1:24:00] today from his throne but his throne was
[1:24:05] moved to the heart of the
[1:24:07] believer where is he going to thunder
[1:24:10] from it's only
[1:24:14] this it's a dual
[1:24:19] authentication thou are the
[1:24:21] Christ
[1:24:23] th
[1:24:25] Peter it goes both
[1:24:28] ways it's she's coming back to
[1:24:32] him we have to
[1:24:34] realize the only form of eternal
[1:24:38] life is
[1:24:40] God so now if God was manifest In the
[1:24:43] Flesh
[1:24:45] Jesus Jesus has come into your
[1:24:48] flesh and dwells in our flesh that's the
[1:24:52] only form of eternal life that there
