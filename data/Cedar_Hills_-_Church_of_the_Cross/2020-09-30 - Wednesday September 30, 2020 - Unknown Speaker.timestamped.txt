[30:18] and uh we had uh i had you know the lord
[30:21] is always so rich gives us so many
[30:23] so many things that helps us through the
[30:26] to our days
[30:30] you write some of them down
[30:33] preach about that one of these days
[30:38] [Music]
[30:46] the lord directed me in a different
[30:48] direction
[31:03] and it completely captured my attention
[31:10] and i almost called him and said brother
[31:12] caleb can we just maybe
[31:13] play that tape tonight instead of me
[31:16] preaching
[31:31] of my my brothers or sisters to not be
[31:33] able to understand it
[31:37] so in that spirit tonight uh we're gonna
[31:39] we're gonna
[31:40] the title is taking sides
[31:44] to if you want to hear something that's
[31:47] very timely for our day
[31:52] for today go hear our prophet in that
[31:55] message taking sides
[32:03] at the end when we get done here if
[32:04] there's time i i want to read you an
[32:06] excerpt from that message
[32:10] it's the thing that kind of looks like
[32:12] the bait on the hook that caught me on
[32:14] my caught my attention on this
[32:15] this little thought
[32:19] i want everybody to relax tonight
[32:22] this is not going to be deep and i don't
[32:26] i don't expect that it's going to take a
[32:27] whole lot of time
[32:30] asia my 10 year old shia me
[32:33] always ask me dad how many pages of
[32:35] notes do you have
[32:41] asia says what most of us are thinking
[32:46] about she goes
[32:49] oh yeah anyways
[32:52] but just relax tonight we're we're in in
[32:55] the presence of friends
[32:59] and i just want to say good evening
[33:00] friends
[33:03] but in this uh in this message taking
[33:05] sites
[33:08] we're in a time of taking sides
[33:12] i uh i started to watch the i started to
[33:15] watch the presidential debates
[33:20] they're gonna do this all night long
[33:50] they want to know what what position are
[33:52] you on
[33:54] are you going for president trump or for
[33:57] uh uh vice president biden
[34:02] they're you know who's right
[34:07] i think our pastor the other days uh
[34:10] said
[34:10] we're in a world that nobody wants to
[34:13] give an inch
[34:18] that's
[35:00] i'm tired of not trusting
[35:03] it has gotten wary
[35:09] this nation is pulling itself apart
[35:13] because we can't trust one another
[35:25] the new world order is distrust
[35:28] is
[35:36] [Music]
[35:40] lack of confidence and leadership
[35:56] it seems like the ministry is not
[35:58] trusted anymore
[36:00] what is it it's the spirit of the day
[36:03] that we live in
[36:03] the spirit everybody's pointing their
[36:06] fingers
[36:08] that's the other person or at the other
[36:10] side and nobody's willing to point the
[36:13] finger at themselves
[36:16] that's the way it is today nobody wants
[36:19] responsibility
[36:21] it's always somebody else's fault i
[36:24] believe it's time that we stop pointing
[36:25] fingers
[36:28] i believe it's time to take a look in
[36:30] the mirror of god's word
[36:33] stop and see how our lines our lives
[36:35] line up to that
[36:37] that's what's mattering tonight it
[36:40] doesn't matter what somebody else thinks
[36:42] what somebody else says what does god's
[36:45] word say
[36:48] see how i line up to god's word get
[36:51] myself
[36:51] in order
[36:55] stop looking at everybody else stop
[36:58] measuring your life
[37:01] by how others raided you
[37:04] that's where we're at we're always
[37:06] looking at the ratings
[37:08] well he's got five stars within a
[37:10] sequence you got a thousand followers
[37:12] for a million followers i found out on
[37:14] amazon
[37:16] careful with the ratings
[37:20] because people will sign you up and
[37:22] you'll do and they'll send you a product
[37:27] and then they'll say thank you for your
[37:28] good rating gracias
[37:30] when when rating and you didn't order
[37:32] the product
[37:34] you don't even know
[37:42] careful with the ratings that's what i
[37:44] do i always look
[37:45] to see this product product here it's
[37:47] got five stars but it's difficult
[38:14] because somehow we believe that if we're
[38:16] on the right side
[38:20] because of the virtue by default god's
[38:23] got to be on that side
[38:27] you like something that our president
[38:29] abraham lincoln said
[40:09] you know if you don't like the way it
[40:10] tastes you know like gustavo just plug
[40:12] your nose and take it anyways
[40:15] this is god's word we're talking about
[40:16] here we're not playing games
[40:19] god doesn't side with man it's our
[40:37] sir it's not my cons
[40:41] my concern is not whether god is on our
[40:44] side
[40:46] my greatest concern is that it's to be
[40:49] on god's side
[41:02] taking sides with jesus
[41:19] the bible says in proverbs 3 verses 5
[41:22] through 6
[41:27] if you would let's stand for the reading
[41:28] of god's word
[41:38] when the guys in the back have it they
[41:39] can see you man
[41:44] okay we'll go ahead uh proverbs 3 5 and
[41:47] 6.
[41:49] he says trust
[41:53] there's that word trust in the lord
[41:57] with all thine heart
[42:41] trust in the lord
[42:54] and his name is the lord jesus christ
[43:24] we like to make
[43:39] whose lives are compatible with the holy
[43:41] ghost
[43:44] but they're not of the same nature say
[43:47] that again
[43:49] there's those that believe they are
[44:06] is not the same as being original
[44:11] being incompatible is not being original
[44:15] compatible you can go down to the parts
[44:18] store and you need a
[44:19] part of your car uh
[44:33] the ones that built that motor that
[44:35] knows everything about it
[44:40] they built the part can buy that one
[44:44] they're expensive or you can buy a
[44:46] compatible part from
[44:47] you know where
[45:31] and they're compatible but they're not
[45:33] original
[45:35] ask yourself tonight am i just
[45:38] compatible
[45:39] ask yourself that i haven't asked myself
[45:43] my am i just a cheap knockoff
[45:47] or am i original do i have
[45:51] the nature of a compatible thing
[45:55] or do i have the nature
[45:58] of the original
[46:11] was the word and the word was with
[46:39] that there's perfect strength and
[46:40] perfect
[47:36] and when he became
[47:48] upside down
[47:56] so we're going to say something that
[47:58] might be a little sting to some of the
[47:59] preachers
[48:04] but
[48:18] perfectly
[48:32] that we have a god called man in this
[48:34] congregation
[48:36] we have a god called man that we should
[48:39] trust
[48:42] please don't get me wrong with what i'm
[48:43] about to say
[49:00] if it's someone other than the man
[49:02] christ jesus
[49:05] christ then we got something wrong
[49:07] somewhere along the lines
[49:11] and he yelled christ he
[49:39] one of the greatest lessons that i've
[49:42] learned
[50:11] that he will give you the gift of the
[50:13] holy ghost
[50:16] to get himself out of the way
[50:19] so that we should get ourselves out of
[50:21] the way
[50:23] i point the finger down god needs
[50:40] get ourselves out of the way so that the
[50:43] lord has
[50:44] preeminence in the lives of his people
[50:49] we're going to give you some bible for
[50:50] that
[50:52] we can
[51:06] wait for a second here because we want
[51:07] to read it together
[51:13] first peter five one two three the
[51:16] elders which are among you i exhort
[51:19] regulars
[51:29] and also a partaker of the glory that
[51:31] shall be revealed
[52:58] or
[53:26] where
[53:38] and don't have trust or confidence
[53:55] so what happens when we start thinking
[53:57] about something too much
[54:01] our pastor has preached some pretty good
[54:02] messages on this
[54:06] pastor we think about things too much
[54:09] maybe it's about how we're going to
[54:10] handle our children
[54:12] if it's about how we're going to make
[54:14] ends meet in our household
[54:17] maybe it's just about something that we
[54:19] just really got to have
[54:36] we start to
[55:04] figuring everything out why
[55:08] okay why do we want to figure things out
[55:11] because because i want to be right and
[55:14] we think that somehow we can understand
[55:16] something
[55:18] then the better chances are that we that
[55:21] we're right
[55:24] i'm sure you have plenty of examples in
[55:26] your life
[55:28] you want to be right about something
[55:31] and i sure do too s
[55:46] can you
[56:18] but just stop leaning on what you know
[56:20] about it
[56:24] [Music]
[56:27] stop leaning on that
[56:51] and it's a it's a it's a handicap if
[56:55] you're a christian
[56:57] impediment if you were playing golf they
[56:59] would give you a big old handicap
[57:08] because as we lean on our own
[57:09] understanding
[57:24] but when we lean on our own now you got
[57:26] to pay attention to this part
[57:29] i'm going to repeat this so we remember
[57:30] i got to make sure i say it right
[57:33] because when we lean to our own
[57:35] understanding
[57:52] we think that
[58:23] [Music]
[58:49] how this leaning thing works here
[58:54] about three of you young men right there
[58:57] it was convenient they're right there
[58:58] there's three guys just about the right
[59:00] size come on up
[59:01] don't worry about social distancing
[59:03] right now i don't have a mask but you
[59:05] guys are covering me you got three of
[59:06] them so
[59:09] come on up and just stuff let's see uh
[59:12] jojo why don't you stand right here
[59:15] and uh go ahead and face the audience
[59:17] there scoot over this way just a little
[59:19] bit
[59:20] yeah okay ethan you can stand right here
[59:24] and no you can stand right here okay
[59:28] here we are right here
[59:30] this is a esta christian this is one of
[59:32] god's
[59:33] sons right here i believe that this this
[59:36] young man is one of god's children
[59:39] good boy thank you for helping
[59:43] uh let's see what's the right okay
[59:46] okay so this is jojo's understanding
[59:50] right here
[59:54] go just a little bit so so you can see
[1:00:19] and you know what uh go walking
[1:00:22] just walk over there you can follow him
[1:00:24] uh jojo's
[1:00:25] understanding
[1:00:40] okay you guys can turn around walk back
[1:00:41] this way
[1:00:43] and the understanding it's just got to
[1:00:45] follow along
[1:00:48] that's what our understanding should do
[1:00:51] our understanding should should be
[1:00:53] following the same way that the lord is
[1:00:56] following is is leading us
[1:01:03] but when you don't trust the lord and
[1:01:06] then
[1:01:07] you lean to your own understanding
[1:01:35] because when your understanding fails
[1:01:39] there you go and you're going to fall
[1:01:42] so that's why it's important now stand
[1:01:44] here again
[1:01:46] the lord never left the lord's always
[1:01:49] been here
[1:01:50] always
[1:02:18] but the bible says i am the lord thy god
[1:02:21] and i changed god when i gave you
[1:02:23] something
[1:02:24] i don't have to learn it anymore
[1:02:29] if you did you won't be god he doesn't
[1:02:32] have to
[1:02:32] learn new things our understanding has
[1:02:35] to learn new things
[1:02:38] with him he gives you the best that you
[1:02:41] cannot possibly have
[1:02:42] already you don't gotta try and go
[1:02:45] figure nothing out thank you gentlemen
[1:02:48] thank you so much for
[1:02:49] for the help
[1:02:52] [Applause]
[1:02:56] again the lord can be on our side
[1:03:14] and
[1:03:26] most horrible death that a man could
[1:03:28] live
[1:03:42] one on either side of him
[1:03:45] on the one side and jesus was on his
[1:03:48] side
[1:03:50] on the one side the man said
[1:03:54] if you're the son of god bring yourself
[1:03:55] down from that tree
[1:04:06] and the lord was on his side too
[1:04:11] and he said this man has done nothing
[1:04:14] wrong
[1:04:18] i deserve to be here he does not deserve
[1:04:21] to be here
[1:04:28] those are the things that keep our mind
[1:04:29] in order
[1:04:32] i deserve to be on this cross
[1:04:36] it doesn't deserve to be there
[1:05:02] you want to still keep leaning on your
[1:05:04] own understanding
[1:05:48] us
[1:05:51] this might seem a little bit off of a
[1:05:54] awful mark right now
[1:05:58] man this made my heart sing
[1:06:02] so this is the message taking sides with
[1:06:03] jesus
[1:06:06] in 1962
[1:06:12] we're going to start with paragraph 30.
[1:06:16] what if god would have told john the
[1:06:18] revelator
[1:06:21] now it's going to be 2 000 years before
[1:06:23] my coming oh
[1:06:26] john would have come back and told the
[1:06:28] church
[1:06:30] well i guess it might you might as well
[1:06:32] eat drink and be married
[1:06:37] because there are going to be many
[1:06:38] generations
[1:06:42] jesus ain't coming for 2 000 years
[1:06:44] millennials
[1:07:11] do you have foreign
[1:07:16] if you don't understand what god's
[1:07:17] prophet said you will never understand
[1:07:19] what our founding pastor said
[1:07:23] because after all aspirations
[1:07:53] because it ain't going to hinder one
[1:07:55] thing
[1:07:56] you're going to be right there on time
[1:08:02] you're going to be right there on time
[1:08:03] anyhow
[1:08:05] he says ben see what i mean
[1:08:19] it will be just as fresh as if they were
[1:08:21] right there in the battle
[1:08:36] and
[1:08:49] we've got to be looking for him right
[1:08:51] now
[1:08:52] right now even we don't know
[1:08:57] it could possibly be that it'd be a
[1:08:59] hundred years from now
[1:09:02] it would be 500 years from now
[1:09:31] as if we've just fallen asleep
[1:09:58] like he might be like he might come the
[1:10:01] next minute
[1:10:04] because it might be the end of your life
[1:10:06] at that minute
[1:10:08] you don't know when you're going this
[1:10:11] may be
[1:10:11] some of your last breath
[1:10:28] now to carry on now to carry on further
[1:10:32] how many want to carry on further
[1:10:34] tonight
[1:10:36] i don't want to stay where i am i want
[1:10:38] to keep going
[1:10:41] carry on further
[1:10:57] it then john wouldn't have known how to
[1:11:00] follow
[1:11:03] if john had enough going on polycarp
[1:11:06] wouldn't have known how to follow him
[1:11:09] if polycarp of god went on
[1:11:13] the eva irenaeus wouldn't have known how
[1:11:15] to follow
[1:11:18] if irene is one of known and wouldn't
[1:11:20] have went on
