[13:48] [Music]
[13:54] hello everybody first of all I want to
[13:59] thank the Lord for giving me this saw
[14:01] that I could share with you and they
[14:03] want to think with a Kaila for letting
[14:05] me share so if you would all turn in
[14:07] your Bibles to Joshua chapter 6 first
[14:11] what first two to five and it says and
[14:23] it says and the Lord said unto Joshua I
[14:28] have given unto thine hand Jericho and a
[14:32] king thereof and a mighty man of Valor
[14:35] initial compassed the city all ye men of
[14:38] war and go round about the city once
[14:41] those shall do six days and the seven
[14:46] priests shall bear before the ark seven
[14:50] trumpets of rams horns and the seventh
[14:53] day ye shall come past the city seven
[14:55] times and a pre-shop low with the
[14:58] trumpets initial come to pass that when
[15:01] they make a long blast with the ram's
[15:03] horn and when he hear the sound of the
[15:07] trumpet all the people shall shout with
[15:10] a great shout and the walls of the city
[15:13] shall fall down flat and the people
[15:15] shall send up every man straight before
[15:18] them if you would all bow your heads for
[15:21] a word of Prayer the allure Jesus Christ
[15:25] Lord but there's nothing we can say Lord
[15:27] there's nothing we can do to describe
[15:29] your presence but we surrender our
[15:32] hearts to you Lord bless this precious
[15:35] students Church Lord bless your word
[15:37] Lord we love you Lord in the name of the
[15:40] Lord Jesus Christ amen so the title of
[15:43] my message is called instructions I got
[15:46] inspiration to preach this message when
[15:49] I was reading Joshua chapter 5 and 6
[15:52] because God went because when God gave
[15:55] Joshua the instructions of how to take
[15:58] Jericho and Joshua gave us those same
[16:03] instructions so
[16:04] children of Israel you may be seated
[16:08] sorry God gave the same God gave the
[16:15] instructions of how to take Jericho to
[16:18] Joshua and Joshua case those same
[16:21] instructions to a children of Israel and
[16:24] to me that sounds like a perfect type of
[16:27] Christian family you know why because
[16:29] God He gave us the word the Bible and a
[16:32] message and he also gave us kids our
[16:36] parents our mom and dad two teachers and
[16:38] instructors according to the word tell
[16:42] us what to do and tell us what to not do
[16:44] according to the word and did you guys
[16:47] know that in the Bible God tells us kids
[16:51] how to treat our parents so if you were
[16:53] all turn in your Bibles to Ephesians
[16:56] chapter 6 verse 1 to 2 and it says
[17:01] children obey your parents in the Lord
[17:04] for it is right honor thy father and
[17:08] mother which is the first commandment
[17:09] with promise
[17:11] so what God says there is that us kids
[17:16] were supposed to honor and obey your
[17:18] parents because God says it is right
[17:21] well we all know that sometimes we make
[17:23] mistakes sometimes instructions they're
[17:25] hard to follow well let me tell you a
[17:29] story of what happened to me when I did
[17:32] not follow my mom's instructions so I
[17:36] was very sick so my mom gave me some
[17:38] pills and let me tell you what brothers
[17:41] I didn't need those pills I hit him
[17:43] anyway
[17:44] hit him in my socks I hadn't read my
[17:45] pockets anywhere I could pretending that
[17:48] I had aid in my medicine and guess what
[17:51] that night I was going to take a shower
[17:55] my mom told me and I I forgot that I had
[17:57] my morning pills inside my socks words
[18:00] they took off my socks
[18:02] the pills are flying and guess where
[18:04] they landed right next to my mom's foot
[18:06] so I was caught and my mom told me why
[18:09] didn't you eat your medicine I told her
[18:11] I just didn't 1/8 that medicine in the
[18:14] next morning I came after school and
[18:16] guess what Oh
[18:18] shocked because my mom was doing laundry
[18:20] and I saw pills all over my room because
[18:23] my mom she takes out everything out of
[18:25] her pocket she I discovered the pills
[18:27] that I had hid in my pockets that's the
[18:31] consequence I got even sicker and I had
[18:34] it to take the same amount of medicine
[18:36] to get myself better so now that we know
[18:40] the instructions are important to follow
[18:42] I see you guys boys
[18:46] what if Joshua went around the city of
[18:49] Jericho
[18:49] three times would you think the walls
[18:51] are come tumbling down yes and let's see
[18:55] the sisters what if Joshua went around
[18:58] the city of Jericho six times what you
[19:01] think the walls will come tumbling down
[19:03] you know why because God he gave Joshua
[19:07] a specific instructions of how to take
[19:10] teracle I went on shall follow those
[19:13] same instructions God blessed him and
[19:16] that that and God blessed him by making
[19:19] the walls of Jericho come down so did
[19:25] you guys know that instructions they're
[19:27] everywhere but you guys were on the Rope
[19:29] gonna children's church on your car
[19:31] there was instructional rules you guys
[19:34] had to follow I you guys were on the
[19:35] road what you guys barely stepped into
[19:38] church throws instructions and rules you
[19:40] had to fall in church and got placed in
[19:46] there for a reason
[19:47] just like he placed us here on earth for
[19:49] a reason that is to worship Him and then
[19:54] he asked you guys little kids a question
[19:56] how many of you guys like Legos let me
[20:00] tell you what I like Legos too so get a
[20:04] box of that so y'all know that they come
[20:06] with instructions inside of him so we
[20:09] use instructions to build Lego set and
[20:12] as we build them we be as we build it we
[20:16] use instructions right and if you just
[20:19] just throw away the instructions say
[20:21] what and you just do whatever you either
[20:24] end up with not enough pieces to build
[20:26] the Lego set or you will just have too
[20:29] many left over or you just simply don't
[20:31] have you have no clue
[20:32] how to build the legacy and we all know
[20:35] that our Bibles there are our
[20:36] instructions right here so we use the
[20:41] Bible to build and that say that we are
[20:44] a pieces so we uses the pipe Oh to build
[20:46] ourselves the way that God wants us and
[20:48] I will start building yourselves become
[20:50] better and better Christians every time
[20:52] and let's say that you just say you know
[20:56] what I'm gonna go the way that I think
[20:57] is that they that I think is right
[21:01] guess what brothers you will end up with
[21:04] the wrong structure it will all just all
[21:06] collapse they'll start your book start
[21:09] building yourself true kit because it's
[21:11] the wrong structure God doesn't want us
[21:14] to build himself like that
[21:15] he wants to us to build it the way that
[21:18] it's right which is the Bible that's why
[21:21] you have to follow and read instructions
[21:25] how many here knows that every time we
[21:29] come to church we come to listen to
[21:31] instructions did you guys know that like
[21:33] for example brother Caleb this morning
[21:36] he took he gave us instructions about
[21:39] how to become better Christians and how
[21:42] to use those things so we have to pay
[21:45] attention in church because sometimes
[21:46] you may be just sleeping around and
[21:50] guess what brothers quitting instruction
[21:53] comes you guys you guys might miss it
[21:56] that's and sometimes when you guys um
[21:59] when there's an important instruction
[22:02] that actually might help your Christian
[22:03] life and you're just dozing off sleeping
[22:06] guess what brothers you'll miss it so
[22:10] it's important to follow instructions
[22:12] and before I let you guys go I need you
[22:16] guys to remember obedience is better
[22:19] than sacrifice may God richly bless you
[22:23] [Applause]
[22:42] [Applause]
[22:51] Amen god bless brother James amen are
[22:55] you children ready I guess no maybe not
[22:59] you girls ready you want to hit the
[23:03] devil a good one
[23:08] you boys already all the girls are
[23:12] louder let's turn to our Bibles you have
[23:26] your Bibles this afternoon
[23:28] all right first Peter 2:9 it's you who's
[23:34] faster other girls or the boys
[23:43] if somebody has a say sword
[23:57] the Lord knows how to deliver the godly
[24:00] out of the temptation since and to the
[24:06] reserve the unjust
[24:25] but you are a chosen generation a royal
[24:30] priest
[24:32] priesthood and holy holy nation a
[24:38] peculiar people that you should show
[24:43] forth the praises of him who hath called
[24:47] you out of darkness but ye are a chosen
[25:00] generation I have a question what is the
[25:03] word peculiar mean design test Amar's I
[25:05] need somebody to help me strange
[25:20] oh that could be up anybody else man the
[25:29] killer people somebody different right
[25:32] we're different we're one of them see
[25:36] whenever you go to school and you're in
[25:39] the your friends look at you kind of
[25:40] weird or you girls the way you dress
[25:43] they thought you're weird they're not
[25:46] chopped they're not saying you're weird
[25:47] they're saying you're inaudible right
[25:49] you're different
[25:51] right kids when you go to school and the
[25:54] teachers tell you to do something you'll
[25:56] be your teacher but when you get home we
[25:58] don't want to obey the parents all right
[26:01] when we get stuck in the corner
[26:03] somewhere and the devil has you bound
[26:06] what are you gonna do ask for help
[26:08] that's when you want mom and dad to help
[26:11] you huh because I've been through it I
[26:13] was a perfect son in the whole world
[26:18] Yeah right huh but you know one thing
[26:23] look at the story of Josiah have you
[26:25] guys read the story of Josiah raise your
[26:27] hands yeah did you know he was a king in
[26:32] Jerusalem and he was only eight years
[26:35] old you imagine that he was only eight
[26:39] years old he was already a king coming
[26:42] from an evil father it was bad
[26:47] so you you think of that story and the
[26:51] devil tells you you're too small you
[26:53] can't worship the Lord don't go to
[26:56] church just stay home play your video
[26:59] games right think bad thoughts but but
[27:06] Josiah he knew what he had there's
[27:11] something inside of you childlike faith
[27:14] you know what that is not childish
[27:17] childlike faith there's a difference but
[27:21] we go through life and we say well I
[27:24] want to do whatever I want to do mom
[27:26] tells you throw the trash and you go to
[27:29] your room you act like you eat in here
[27:32] right
[27:33] mom says clean the room you just wash
[27:36] under the bed you go am i really done
[27:38] you know I know that for experience my
[27:45] dad will tell me we used to have like
[27:47] three acres of land he goes cleaned our
[27:49] yard again
[27:51] and I had a brother I have a brother
[27:55] he's handicapped on the wheelchair so I
[27:57] had something against the Lord I go why
[27:59] don't you kill my brother so he I'm like
[28:03] whew like my nephew says to Kayla you
[28:06] know so what we needed to do be like
[28:10] Samson right he wasn't at all man
[28:14] broadband said he was short maybe like
[28:17] me I don't know maybe like Reuben maybe
[28:22] like Noah but Samson he had to defeat a
[28:28] thousand Philistines a thousand demons
[28:30] was a jawbone magic one jawbone you have
[28:35] to do it so the devil the devil one day
[28:39] was walking down the desert he goes he
[28:41] saw a jawbone I dried up jawbone on the
[28:43] desert eagle what he's a mass
[28:46] destruction but what I can he's not
[28:48] gonna do nothing to me but he didn't
[28:50] know that some day it was gonna be used
[28:52] against him one day Samson was walking
[28:55] down he grabbed that jawbone I believe
[28:59] that the Lord put it there for a reason
[29:02] so if Samson could defeat the devil with
[29:07] a job on a mule what can God do with
[29:09] your jawbone how can you defeat the
[29:12] devil or yam I cannot take off your job
[29:16] on no I'm not talking about that right
[29:18] you got to speak the word right
[29:21] God use your job on the same like he did
[29:23] Samson right you believe that now look
[29:27] at the story of David and Goliath he was
[29:30] a big man right big maybe Goliath was
[29:34] maybe as big as what's your name again
[29:37] undress or maybe Yandel maybe you huh
[29:43] David Europe I just
[29:45] be little taller than they were shorter
[29:47] than David do you you probably could
[29:53] tell it better than me you know that I
[29:55] believe you but you look at the story
[30:00] what a David do but David said no it was
[30:19] too heavy for him so he only got his
[30:23] sling and a few pebbles from the river
[30:26] that were nice and flat so when he faced
[30:32] him he said do you come to me with a
[30:38] stick like thinking he was a dog he got
[30:44] one of the pebbles he's swinging them
[30:46] around and threw it right into his
[30:49] forehead and Goliath came crashing down
[31:00] what if Goliath say am i a dog you come
[31:03] to me with staves right that's what he
[31:06] said but I like what the Bible says
[31:09] whenever you get into problems
[31:11] circumstances we try to run away right I
[31:15] ain't gonna lie
[31:17] right but the Bible said that David ran
[31:20] towards a battle he didn't walk he ran
[31:22] towards the battle you got our one
[31:24] towards your problem sometimes like it
[31:26] or not you have to we got to confront
[31:28] the devil face to face as Dudley as he
[31:30] is and I mean right we have to confront
[31:35] the devil we try to run away from our
[31:37] pumps because I tried that many times it
[31:39] doesn't work it doesn't what we have to
[31:42] run towards a battle right so we go in
[31:46] and we see a we see this all these uh
[31:50] problems going on with David trying to
[31:54] organize trying to call him out they
[31:58] were
[31:58] David's men they were hiding in the tent
[32:02] for 40 days without coming out you
[32:04] imagine that and David just walked over
[32:06] to camp just to give him his lunch he
[32:08] wasn't there to go fight but you heard
[32:11] an uncertain sound he didn't like right
[32:14] and he said he ran towards the battle
[32:17] that's what we got to do sometimes maybe
[32:20] you're having family problems with your
[32:23] brother or your sisters you guys fight
[32:26] you guys gotta love each other right yes
[32:30] all right a man now we see looking at
[32:35] Josiah eight years old he didn't like
[32:43] all that sin that was going around the
[32:44] city right he was destroying all the
[32:48] images he was destroying everything
[32:50] that was in front of them the Bible said
[32:53] by the eighteen or nineteen years old he
[32:55] was there he really had money to rebuild
[32:57] the temple so what are we doing today
[33:00] trying to send money to Africa to ganda
[33:04] to rebuild a temple over there right
[33:07] that's where we're trying to do right
[33:09] look at Jesus
[33:11] when Jesus was not going to the cross
[33:14] what happened he fell the heavy was to
[33:17] cross I was on his shoulders I'm a heavy
[33:20] guy right he was carrying my sins and
[33:25] what happened there was a color man that
[33:28] came and helped them so there's no wrong
[33:30] there's nothing wrong if you guys asked
[33:32] for help somebody could help you your
[33:36] brother your sister could help you right
[33:39] if Jesus got how how much more us to
[33:42] carry the cross don't be ashamed to ask
[33:46] for help there is a lot of people here
[33:49] that could help you your parents will
[33:51] help you you say all my parents are mean
[33:54] no they're not that devil tells you that
[33:57] but they're not mean they're your best
[34:01] friends remember that so we go
[34:05] I mean I'm gonna read this to you Oh
[34:08] Samson okay
[34:10] what brother Balan says here he didn't
[34:15] have to go forward and say now wait let
[34:19] me take this jaw bone down and let me
[34:21] test it if you see if it works or not he
[34:23] didn't say that right so now when you go
[34:28] out you say devil get out of the way
[34:30] right leave my family alone leave me
[34:34] alone I'm tired of you you start moving
[34:36] your jawbone and start praising the Lord
[34:38] you start seeking the Lord Lord I need
[34:41] your help can we do that Lord where are
[34:45] you wet I need you but you got to be
[34:48] faithful you pray every morning we leave
[34:53] me sometimes I don't like to pray I'm
[34:54] not gonna lie but I do like to read I
[35:00] need to pray more so I should I come
[35:04] every Monday morning for the Lord calamy
[35:05] framework I cannot learn how to pray
[35:07] more so now we go through life and what
[35:12] happens we get stuck in a circumstances
[35:14] and how do you get out of it right we
[35:19] grow up and we say oh well I go to
[35:22] church I could be in the world a little
[35:24] bit at least my parents go to church I'm
[35:26] in the message so later on I'm gonna
[35:28] Cape I get married and I'll give my life
[35:30] to the Lord I don't work that way either
[35:34] take it or you leave it you gotta take
[35:36] everything inside of me right you look
[35:39] for the Lord and say Lord I'm right here
[35:42] do whatever you want with me Lord am I
[35:47] right or wrong
[35:48] well we're sometimes what happens we put
[35:52] on the armor which is the word of that
[35:54] there's no armor behind us you know why
[35:57] can somebody tell me why we don't have
[35:59] no armor behind us because it's not God
[36:14] the armor goes on front right when you
[36:17] go to battle there's nothing in the back
[36:18] you know why we don't have nothing in
[36:20] the back is we don't walk backwards we
[36:21] go forward right and another thing you
[36:26] have your brother back there fighting
[36:27] for you too so we have to help each
[36:28] other right so it's just a little
[36:33] thought that I had just one more

[45:14] stored in these books every one of them
[45:16] from every era of time I wonder what's
[45:18] in them alphabetical order to look

[46:09] book oh my goodness look at this I have
[46:21] sand in my jacket listen tell me what
[46:25] was your plan after you opened the Bible
[46:27] at me I figured the light would blind
[46:30] you and you would fall over well I mean
[46:33] it wouldn't be the first time
[46:35] good old Saul or Paul give or take a
[46:37] couple of minutes had that happened to
[46:39] him as well where parley
[46:41] well it appears we are in combat Kriya
[46:44] proximately well really far back BC
[46:47] that's impossible no no nothing is
[46:50] impossible with God's Word custard which
[46:52] apparently is the lesson we are learning
[46:54] today all right sandy pants it's time
[46:56] for you to start talking
[46:57] sandy pants you should see your head how
[47:00] do you know our names how are we here
[47:02] and how are you so calm about this well
[47:05] I am Burton C Dickens the librarian for
[47:08] now and keeper of the book and I know
[47:10] your names because a great man above
[47:12] knows your names as well
[47:13] and he tells me and you managed to open
[47:16] that Bible which just so happens to not
[47:18] only tell the story but live it you're
[47:21] wondering where we are
[47:22] we are on the battlefield of the great
[47:25] Goliath
[47:27] face me you spineless scum your finest
[47:31] army could not take on the mighty
[47:33] Goliath no way great pigeons household
[47:37] I shouldn't have complained about having
[47:39] messy hair yes
[47:41] very surprising and wild now I'm hide
[47:43] behind that rock by the way miss patty
[47:46] Oh messy hair can always be fixed
[47:48] darling it was a sacrifice Shirley
[47:50] needed to be taken yes why does he refer
[48:01] to himself as if he's someone else he
[48:03] had a big head yes he does it's bigger
[48:06] than my whole body why is he so angry
[48:08] well he is a Philistine the Philistines
[48:12] weren't exactly getting along with the
[48:13] kingdom of King Saul so they came to
[48:15] fight the people in that kingdom over
[48:17] there were terrified and knew that this
[48:20] man meant business however a young boy
[48:22] named David should be right on his way
[48:25] right about now does he ever shut up
[48:33] eventually see David went to King Saul
[48:36] explained how he wanted to defeat the
[48:38] Goliath for defying the Lord army
[48:40] King Saul found him and said no but
[48:44] David explained how he he was the
[48:47] shepherd of his father's people who know
[48:50] right David was a shepherd and in fact
[48:54] took on a bear and a lion both who
[48:56] attacked the Sheep he watched well the
[49:01] same way he's about to fight Goliath now
[49:04] [Music]
[49:11] [Music]
[49:15] you come against me with sword and spear
[49:18] and javelin the god of the armies of
[49:24] Israel whom you have defied the day the
[49:27] Lord will deliver you into my hands and
[49:30] I'll strike you down and cut off your
[49:32] head this very day I will give the
[49:35] carcasses of the Philistine army to the
[49:36] birds and the wild animals and the whole
[49:39] world will know that there is a God in
[49:41] Israel all those gathered here will know
[49:44] that this that it is not by sword or by
[49:47] spear that the Lord saves is the Lord's
[49:51] and He will give all of you into our
[49:53] hands
[49:57] this guy is off his marble will someone
[50:00] do something I think you might have cost
[50:05] an earthquake with a sling and a stone
[50:08] God use David to kill that massive giant
[50:11] with those two things
[50:12] David believed in his God so much that a
[50:15] small stone brought down the mightiest
[50:16] of warriors nowadays people have John
[50:19] it's all over their lives you may ask
[50:21] yourself what can I not overcome what
[50:23] giant stands before me and it's God's
[50:26] power you can do anything even the most
[50:28] impossible things like custard right
[50:31] there will always be Giants to attack us
[50:34] but there will be an even more giant God
[50:36] to have our back and fight a mighty
[50:38] Goliath no matter how small good because
[50:42] I'm very sleep what is he doing oh he
[50:47] said that he was going to chop off his
