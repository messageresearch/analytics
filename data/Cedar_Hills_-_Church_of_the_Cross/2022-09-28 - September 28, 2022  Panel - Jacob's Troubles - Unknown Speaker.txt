that knows what that is tonight he knows what Jacob's trouble is a man we're in school by a show of hands how many knows what Jacob's Trouble Is Right we got got three hands right now so yeah definitely gonna learn something tonight amen hey man so I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to brother Julian Julian he can go ahead and start us our lesson tonight amen thank you congratulations I'm sorry I'm gonna go in Spanish [Music] and we'll go to some scriptures we'll begin with Daniel 9 24. radios settings 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy Holy City to finish the transgression and to make an end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in Everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy now we'll go to Revelation chapter 6 verse 12. everyday and I beheld when he had opened the Sixth Seal and low there was a great earthquake and the sun became black a sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood and lastly Daniel chapter 12 and verse 1. very well known by by everyone Miguel is stand up the great Prince which standards for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that time and at that time the people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book so we see the how delicate this topic is we see that Joe Joe prophesied it we also see Daniel here speaking about it and Jesus also made reference in Matthew which we will see later foreign does anyone know what the name Jacob means a planter thank you brother deceiver is someone taking the place of someone else illegally or a deceiver now how how was Jacob says Jacob was a very Shameless young man uh very close to the or holding on to the apron of his his mother he was a storytelling specified boy to his mom and we know some of them and as the Bible says he would spend his time with his mother and with those highs and lows that he had in in his life he had something that was important which was the respect to his Birthright that made all of the difference is we see he was escaping from his father-in-law labor Ator and from the other side his brother was also seeking him and he said I deceived him and well perhaps he's coming to kill me and in that time is where he finds himself with the Lord where he finds himself trapped where he has no way out and well the name has a lot to do with this as long as his name was Jacob plantador he was a supplanter a deceiver but when he wrestled with the Lord all night long the Lord changed his name from Jacob to Israel Israel and who knows the the meaning of of the name Israel that if anybody knows I heard someone say it means uh Prince of the Lord yes that's what he was Jacob told the Lord I will not leave you you cannot go continue I will stay here with you I want things to change right here if that could be our attitude towards God okay that's where God can respond when we're in that decisive moment in our life them no button s is 144 000 these managers of of the money things of the same style when they see the truth to what they can hold on to is President says there's Moses and Elijah I mean amen they will wrestle with God into 144 000 of the tribes of Israel will be called right there brother Brown says in the six seals and now here is these two prophets standing here with the word of God so that they can do anything to Nature that they want to yes and they can shake the Earth and it shows exactly who does it it's Moses and Elijah personification because there is their ministry re-impersonated again it's both men oh my do you see it now the congregation it's those Prophets they preach like John the Baptist amen so now we find out that Jacob's trouble is the Great Tribulation yes now this subject and I gotta say you know to all the the brothers all the Ministers of the platforms let's give them a round of applause amen amen and the reason why is because these all the subjects they require a lot of time and dedication and they do that for free yeah for your benefits taking time out of their their schedules and it's for our benefit yes so you know a great end of applaud to each Minister and each Persona and so we find out that we just read in in Daniel 12 and instead and at that time Michael shall stand up the great Prince was standard for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was Nations even to that time and at that time thy people shall be delivered So it's talking about the Great Tribulation there yeah and that's a time that this world has never never seen yes so this subject right here is going to be gruesome it was warn you ahead of time there's no church in this one up yeah you can't you can't flower it up no you can take a pig he's filthy he's filthy by Nature I mean I don't know how many have ever been around pigs and they stink all right they're filthy they love to wallow in their own urine they they just soak in that stuff you well we find out that there are the Bible talks about tribulation here um so the Bible if you were to go to Matthew 24. 29 verse and don't don't turn to this I'm just going to reference it real quick and brother Ronnie's pregnant reference it as well but I'm just going to read real quick Jeremiah 37. alas for that day is great the last for that day is great so that none is like it it is even the time of Jacob's trouble but he shall be saved out of it is so if we were going to go to Matthew 24 now this subject has been taught to us through our founding pastors right our Elder has most of the material that I have materials I I just heard our Elder preach it is so it would benefit us to go back to those reference those yes but how many have ever gone through tribulation right you have tribulations in your life right and the Bible says that there's a one coming that you've never it is right so think about your worst tribulations and a lot of times we say as ministers we say oh we've been through hell this is you've not seen hell is not a place like anything that you've ever seen so the tribulation that you've gone through some great um now we're going to give you the good news how you can escape because there is a way of Escape but so the Bible talks about tribulations here now we heard our our Elder is preach on these two tribulations so we're going to talk about one tribulation first which is going to be Matthew 24 29 yeah Aaron tell us a little bit about that tribulation what happened there so the tribulation we find here in Matthew 24 29. it reads immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the Stars shall fall from Heaven and the powers of Heaven shall be shaken amen the heavens shall be shaken tribulation is so the question is what tribulation is the Bible speaking about here as we heard this Earth has not even seen the Great Tribulation so it couldn't be that so the next question is what day is the Bible talking about so real quick I'm just going to jump to Luke Chapter 21. Lucas and this is our lord Jesus here prophesying Jesus and when you shall see Jerusalem compass with armies then know that the Desolation thereof is nigh then let them return Judea flee to the mountains and let them which are in the midst of it depart out and let them not that are in the countries enter therein to for these be the days of Vengeance that all things which are written may be fulfilled entrance is amen so well speaking in tongues there [Laughter] even Siri wanted to preach all right so the tribulation that we're reading about here it's going to be a when General Titus The Siege the city of Jerusalem is now how many know which Titans were talking about here how many think it's the Titus that we read of in the book of Titus raise your hands I thought it was how many think it was a Roman conquer puentos raise your hand if you think it was that how many things he was a Spanish conquistador Conquistador Espanol no no all right if you chose B please he was a Roman conqueror Conquistador Romano his name was Titus flavius vespinaceous that was the only decent picture I could find of him the others were statues but he was actually known as a very Peaceable man in his earlier years he was uh he was trained to War by his father who was the previous emperor of Rome at the time uh what you would call a very violent person to start out with he was not enough it just so happened that his father put him on this mission to overtake Jerusalem history actually called it the Jewish War like so when he was assigned to the to the city of Jerusalem he didn't just run up in there and start slaughtering people you see Jerusalem was a very well protected City there were high walls all around it they actually had men in there that were well capable of Defending themselves so you see General Titus had to be smarter than that so what he did is he he turned the people against themselves what's the easiest way to get somebody angry because punch him in the face even easier than that you just take away their food you had a bunch of angry people there in Jerusalem because of all their major life resources principales I was watching an interesting video how he actually was able to attack like the pool of Bethesda Miriam getting rid of their water sources agua and he just let it go on not for a week not for two weeks brother Branham says it went on for about two to three years so just for a minute just imagine how hungry you would be after maybe a week I'm sure we'd start to the dog would look pretty good at that point you know if you have livestock I'm sure you're going to be killing your horses well it was worse than that it got to the point where the mothers would start to kill their children they'd have to eat them they'd be so hungry that they get the bark off of the trees you'd see people going insane on the ground like cows eating the grass you're just a total picture of Chaos but you have people so on edge irritable [Music] committing suicide um and then all the while General Titus was just waiting and finally after about two to three years brother Branham says in 1896 hi this is troops finally entered Jerusalem slaughtering the citizens so they thought it was bad just not eating not drinking you know the babies being killed but that probably would have been the easy way to get out of this General Titus was anointed to do this job you see God never sends judgment without first giving away of Escape and you might be asking yourself well what do these people do so wrong these were good people in fact brother Branham says they were Israelites God's Own people church members Santos they knew the word real well but you see they failed to do one thing and that was to believe the true sign that God had sent them yes he sent them the Messiah and what did they do with it on the day of Pentecost is get those drunk people oh I mean is a bunch of Holy Rollers then Jesus is performing these Miracles what do they call them Jesus oh he's a devil that's Beelzebub is the very Messiah was right before their eyes and they couldn't even see it you see so God didn't just strike judgment on these people for no reason this is what they chose to do and it got to the points when General Titus finally entered the city we're not like we said we're just going to say like it is he had no mercy record brother says he they ravaged the women in the streets so let's bring it to today the other way they had all the finest houses living good viviendo muy bien they thought they had no need of god good job then 10 minutes later yes minutes they're being stripped of their clothes their children are being gutted right down the middle of themselves and they're asking themselves what's going on but yet they rejected the Messiah and so let's skip down here so what was interesting about this is that a lot of them took on the mentality muchos oh when General Titus gets here let's just call the the god that that's always been here for us he said let's call on this great Jehovah who's always been there he'll rescue us come on everybody let's go to the church let's pray upstairs because they rejected the sign that was already sent to them but I have good news we just read Luke 20 21 20. where Jesus had already said that these things were going to happen Jesus and all those who believed what Jesus had spoken Jesus they were nowhere to be found as soon as they saw those encounters yeah Hallelujah so let's bring it to tonight if that's okay [Music] so I was thinking how does this apply to me you know we can claim to be Christians they claim to be Israelites to believe Jesus so tonight we might claim to even be message Believers but what do we do sometimes we refuse to do those little small things you know we're all we're instructed by the ministry if you said something wrong about a brother or a sister make it right if you're guilty of planting seeds of Discord go make those things right oh we're just gonna go and we're gonna pray that General Titus will pass right by us and not see us we take on that same mentality oh God will forgive me if I just if I'm more sincere and I just don't do it again no that's not the formula formula these people were religious they were sincere as can be esto is so if it took just being sincere then God should have never allowed this to happen to them but it was more than that it was making sure that they had received Christ that's what it is tonight yes you got to make sure it's Christ that we have received the Bible said many false of Christ shall and make sure that it is Christ that we have received the Bible says when you see these things begin to take place you don't have to be afraid just simply look up and know that your Redemption draws now is he said behold I send unto you Elijah the prophet is and I just like to remind you tonight that you're children of God is now come back to your Covenant come back into the promised land what is the promise yes it was on the day of Pentecost it's unto you and to your children that's what the promise is tonight is a great day it's also a very terrible day but come back and that's what this tribulation that we read about in Matthew was all about so then we just that's that you're telling me that there's another greater than that way greater how many think that was pretty pretty bad right I didn't even mentioned if they were caught trying to leave the city not only were they captured but they were crucified in the most weirdest positions the Romans felt to crucify them that day crucified that's how they were crucified and everybody could just look at it to know hey I'm not trying to leave so then in Matthew 24 it says for then shall be great tribulations such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be revelation is [Music] so as your as you're hearing this is don't look at that like as a story that just happened in those times right so tribulation is either it's past present or future it is so the Bible says that there's a tribulation coming here that's gonna come right and so the only one that escapes that tribulation is a bride right La Novia right and so I remember the words of our founding pastors he said there's no reason why anybody here should not be brine cannot depends we fight ourselves into these things we say oh I've gone through so much tribulation if you look back probably at all the tribulations you've been through regulations they were self-inflicted you you did that on your own now there's things that come on and so the bride she she has tribulations but God has taken has made a way for her why because she has received Christ the word in her day she hasn't rejected the word no no so we're given this opportunity tonight now the saddest thing to me is that you hear about these things that are that are going to take place so you heard about what happened with Titus that was just a Prelude to what's coming that ain't even as horrific as it's going to be as brother Branham says he says that they can do it within five minutes from now Russia has it's already set against Russia can make a call right now and say surrender the brother Brown says that there's nothing that this place used to the United States can do it is it's already in place right and he says they can do it in five minutes either you surrender now or in five minutes we'll turn you into dust is and brother Brown tells about what's going to happen he talks about it in handwriting on the walls invasion of the USA says that ship load after ship load he said barcode trans so if you think you're gonna stay here let me just tell you what you're looking forward to um there's going to be ship loads of barbaric soldiers it's going to be a time of Anguish it's going to be a Great Tribulation the soldiers man is you you think you can fight you think you're tough what are you going to do when they come into your house take your wife in front of you ravish take your children bash their head on the walls it's not a joke right but we live every day like if it's nothing that's going to happen to us we do that it was time to take inventory tonight it's night for tonight let's start checking off the list and see where we're at least have we rejected today say oh I hear the message all the time I'm a good Persona I don't do this or that you know right but let's start checking off the list let's take inventory of Our Lives the Bible says brother Branham says that in the times of General Titus that the blood flowed through the streets there's only one Escape tonight and that's to find yourself rest in the word of God amen amen so as I said this can be past present or future and I'm talking just about the literal I'm not going profound or this is just the literal tribulation is right and we can get as deep deep as deep as you want to get we can give you profound Revelations well like I said the saddest thing it's like our brother Abraham has said before ministers have said we want to preach that like if everybody hears the bride um right but realistically not everybody's the bride right correct but remember there's no reason why you shouldn't be right so it's either time to ship up it is right so the saddest thing is that each and every one of you is myself included we have loved ones family members of Familia people we know we'll go through this right we know that the foolish virgin goes through this and it's done for her purification yes she has got to go through this tribulation to be saved right bye and we read here in the in uh 22 and except those days be shortened okay there should no flesh be saved but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortenedos and we understand by by the teachings that have been brought to us we know that the scripture is compounded right but we found out that this scripture here was speaking of the Jews right we know that how many of you remember that Michael shall stand amen how many remember that amen okay so now is a good indication right now you check off the Box check it out so if we don't if we don't know it or we just don't want to raise our hand that we know it yeah let's check off the box say okay this week instead of going to the movies instead of going to go do this okay I'm gonna go back and hear one of the messages I can refresh in my memory amen amen all right so now that we know that that's Israel right because uh unless the days be shortened we find out that this Jacob's trouble it's three and a half years of tribulation so I'm going to turn it to brother Ronnie we can tell us about this natural and and present time then uh brother Danny was saying remember Danny this is a rough subject you know brother Dan I you know I'm not you know trying to turn my color around or anything like that you know but this is the hardest message I've ever had you know because of the because of the things that it goes into okay you know brother brother Danny I had the exact same thing that you did because brother Aaron gave the history the Pastorius brother Danny gave the future but what about the present you know you know what Jesus is we know what Jesus did in the past we know what he's gonna do but we're ignore what's going on today right you know and and I just want to try to do the best I can to maybe paint a little picture for everyone his brother Aaron was saying a minute ago to to try to do the best I can to uh bring it to our modern times right now [Music] to the individual you know as you know brother brother Danny if you know uh read the scripture here on Jeremiah if we can turn to that there we can put it up there Jeremiah 30 verses 6 7 6 and 7. and it says asking now and see whether a man does travail with child wherefore wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins as a woman in travail it is and all faces are turned into paleness alas for that day is great so that none is like it is even the time of Jacob's trouble troubles but he shall be saved that's the key point right there that I hope I can get to right here is so he shall be saved out of it as we heard brother Julian how we give the uh the meaning of Jacob is you know how he was a deceiver so planter you know what is the definition of a shyster definition a person especially a lawyer or a politician um who uses discreditable discreditable or unethical methods you know so plant to plant that to take the place of another it's a little bit different than what brother Julian had but in essence it's the same friends you take the place of another as through Force scheming or strategy to replace one thing by something else to trip up or overthrow uh and the synonyms for foreign might get a little a little hairy here okay and uh I mean to no offense to not want any person you know uh but the word must be preached amen now now here I just wanna maybe again a paint a little picture here of the life of Jacob you know um because we can see how his trials his tribulations would affect and you know how we go through similar things now Jacob before before any of his troubles began let me rephrase before he was given the name deceiver so planter to plantador he was already in trouble in trials and tribulations well brother Ronnie what do you mean by that now Jacob's troubles began when he was in the wombustia okay so so this afternoon here is you're gonna have to put your spiritual caps on okay spiritual we've all been taught what symbols are and what certain things mean in the scripture in the Bible okay so you're gonna have to put you're gonna have to work a little bit here with me and you're gonna have to put that cap on okay but while he was in his mother's womb you know he was fighting you know brother Aaron I I can see I can see Rebecca already you know uh you know you've your wife has been pregnant before and you know sometimes some women get real uneasy sisters is that right you know sometimes you know with the baby in there it's it's rough is well that was Rebecca you know Rebecca I remember hearing our funny Pastor one time brother Danny he said oh I can see Rebecca they say she was almost at the point of because of the tribulations and the trials of Jacob that was going on inside of her tribulation now I can see Rebecca here okay oh maybe she was trying to fall asleep and then all of a sudden she felt a punch if she felt a kick you know I could see her going crazy you know what's going on inside of me is this is supposed to be a happy time in my life I'm going to bring forth a child you know but she would try maybe try to you know lay down on the other side right maybe some of my sisters can understand what I'm saying right they have a hard time on one side they try the others you know but but that was Rebecca there yeah she felt a kick a punch you know so brother Dennis one day she got so fed up brother Dan um where she went and she inquired of the Lord you know she didn't she wasn't there she didn't go ask her husband to go pray she didn't ask her husband to go into Inquirer of the Lord the Bible says that she went to the Lord and she says Lord what's up it's driving me crazy what what is this that's inside of me now we know a woman is a type of the church right you know so she you know Lord like what's going on with inside of me what's what's the problem and the Lord says it there are two nations in here there's two people inside the one shall be stronger than the other Uno said and and the the Elder Shall Serve the younger so so we see here that that Jacob his his Destiny was already set to Destino yes before he was even given the word sheister or given that name right but before that because Destiny was already said you know and and and and it she's so we know the story that she produced she produced the twins right so now here's the question here is who was the Revelation given to against Isaac Isaac or to Rebecca of who her children were think about that for a minute in her before before the children were even born she had a revelation of who Jacob was and can you imagine Isaac he said who was a prophet yeah he loves and Rebecca love Jacob Rebecca Jacob arguments she knew brother Dan what what the destiny of that child was going to be and again she the church Iglesia you know you know the the cheaper Rebecca produced the twins now how many have ever have heard or have said themselves you know when somebody says oh you know where is the Welsh Revival I've said it myself but I don't care which Revival it is every Revival produces a twin produce every Revival produces a Isa yeah keep that in mind okay you know and and okay so I'm gonna try to bring this to the individual now okay I'm not here to you know contradict what you said brother Dan you know oh but we have troubles right every single one of us here we have troubles right you know we heard brother Danny said that a lot of our troubles are self-induced right and a lot of Jacob's troubles were it appeared to be self-induced you know but we have troubles here right I'm gonna really hear the way I have it here yeah what are some of our troubles as well as Believers and Christians what are our troubles maybe one day we feel like we're saved maybe the next day we don't know maybe one day we know all about the word the next day we don't know today we are saved tomorrow we're not saved no today I'm going to heaven tomorrow I feel like I'm going to hell today today we think good of the brother tomorrow we don't think no today he loves us tomorrow we don't think that he loves us today I have a message to preach tomorrow I don't Manana no today I'm happy tomorrow today I feel like helping out in the church tomorrow I don't feel like today I'm a son or a daughter of God tomorrow I don't think so today I am worthy tomorrow I I don't think I'm worthy today I'm good tomorrow I'm bad everybody have they had those thoughts I mean I know that's something that you know I believe that some I believe that's something that every believer Christian struggles with and they might seem a little simple compared to uh with the gentleman here we're talking about so but have you ever wondered why that you think that those thoughts have come to you because I I know I ain't alone you know but have you ever asked yourself and wondered you know ask yourself why why do I have those thoughts Paul Paul in the in the Romans chapter 7 he gives the answer why Pablo in in Romanos puesta it's because inside of us that there is a twin the word the word has come to us we've had a Revival because the word has come to us and because we've had a Revival and we don't know it that inside of us that there is a twin again and every Revival twins are produced right here Brother Dan Brother Aaron Julian right here right now there is a Jacob and an Esau sitting down right here right now [Music] or you know you know I'm not talking about devil that with you know a red guy in red with horns a pitchfork and a pointy tails but both religious little almost really kyosu that's why brother Julian it is so close that it'll deceive the burials if it was possible so close in Malachi 4 5 and malachias cuatro cinco so on the surface you know Esau was a good guy he was a gentleman oh man brother Brandon says as far as his character that he was a good guy you know but but and Jacob again was like his brother Julian said brother Brandon says he was a sissified Storyteller is a mama's boy uh um and Esau again was had a better character more of a gentleman character imagine that a seat from the devil and yet better person than Jacob and both from a righteous now watch this and both came from the promised son which was which was Isaac right that blows my mind as told me they're burning up inside no no no now watch this right here okay we get so caught up that Jacob was a deceiver and a sheister again remember Jacob's troubles we get so caught up that it was Jacob but but on the inside luckily luckily God looks at us on the ends from the inside right because you go back to the prophet uh and the message brother Branham says Esau was a shyster in a deceiver is we'll get to that here in a second okay yeah no no no now imagine this this again this this blows me away okay Esau was was Isaac's favorite son remember Isaac was a was a prophet okay Esau was his favorite son again morally speaking that he would he he outshined Jacob in every way yes he was more religious are they working did more missionary work than Jacob yes oh oh people don't like that one right well no no let's let's go stories why porque because the Bible says that Esau was a man of the field Campo come on now this is Jacob's troubles now I told you this is going to get a little yes we think a lot of times we think because we go out and do these things that we're in the will of God I'm a bad dude because I go out and preach around the world yeah Jacob was a specified in other words so we can understand it like people say like this put it in layman's terms of Jacob was a guy that never went out to the missionary felt like he stayed in church swallow that one right yeah no amen's there huh no Amen on that one it's all right but it is that's the word of God right there so watch watch this okay again Rebecca had a revelation of who Jacob and Esau were Rebecca Revelation this this again this blows me away yes so Rebecca she would look and she would study them Jacob now this is from our founding Pastor here is and the one that was planning the whole thing how to get the birthright to the one where God had made the promise to which was Jacob Rebecca where Rebecca how much Jacob was given the those titles now the whole time it was Rebecca where Rebecca she had a plan the whole time blows me away now right right here okay so this is where it's going to get a little hairy here okay okay so Jacob's troubles in the church so so right here I'm gonna play an audio clip of our founding Pastor here I know you're interpreting me but brother Jimmy has the paper right no I didn't give it you know I left it okay uh Sam there's a desk up there there's a paper there's a paper up there on the desk up there can you get it got it got it oh he's got it okay so there's no interpretation okay so I'm gonna play the audio then Brother Jimmy's gonna interpret it and then I'm gonna play it again and the reason why I'm gonna play it twice [Music] is because on some of this is and I'm playing this to emphasize what I'm saying a little bit more okay and he and he's kind of whispering here so it's a little the audio is a little low yeah if you can play that there please you don't want a cool piece c-o-u-p oo you can put the words on there hey sick for instance sister Elizabeth that's a boy let's paint the tambourine misters get together [Music] boycott Malacca for if I boycott the people are expecting it in the outside is in US close in the churches many churches I can preach they will let these you don't want a cool piece c-o-u-p is boycott churches this is an egg is there it is you don't have to play it okay now can you imagine that Jacob's troubles in the church boycott the definition of boycott definition to refuse to have dealings with now brother Aaron I know Aaron isn't that what happened in Jerusalem they cut off the resources to to refuse to have dealings with a person organization Etc organization Etc or refuse to buy as a protest protest to exclude exclude normal social or professional activity to exclude from normal professional activities in the church activities now now I read a while ago I read the the that the synonym of supplant was supersededes now when I read the definition of boycott I saw super seed and I was like Matt same word definition it's the same meaning to replace and power uh uh Authority why another person or thing to boycott or cost a voice or in other words to set aside or cause to cause to be set aside right crucified brother crucified crucifying the effects of the word today in the people because brother Isaiah doesn't got it brother Noah brother brother Isaac don't got it brother Yandel has it boycott I'm crucifying the crew the effects of the word and the people right here right now and we're expecting it on the economical Council of churches one man can be a denomination and what is a denomination Church oh so this denomination gets together with this denomination and we get together with this denomination we get together with this one is and we crucified the effects of the word because I'm not calling you guys that you guys are denominations just for an example that's the spirit of the day today if someone doesn't like what you say yeah cancel him oh we don't like what he preaches cancel the guy no sir anyways tribulations all right and I think I'm gonna I'm gonna just say this and then and then I'll stop okay we had to see this is Jacob wrestled with the angel right now now watch this this this this this again this blows me away one of the biggest tribulations one of the biggest problems for a Believer um is recognizing who you are recognosis recognizing yourself that means all we can recognize the preachers but one of the hardest things is to recognize who you are right easy to see the person behind the pulpit is but that only gets you the third base but then now Jacob wrestled with the angel and he overcame the angel right but watch this brother Branham paragraph 100 and the message My Redeemer Lives one side a great poster well what he was really called he was a deceiver the very word Jacob means deceiver and when he was on this side a great healthy strong deceiver on the other side a living Prince um that had been with God was blessed and the Hope was it within him Jacob again I mean it's a planter deceiver right watch this and we realized that Jacob's life really represented Grace so Jacob means Grace on the time of Jacob's troubles brother it says he shall be saved he said it was Grace through Jacob's life the whole time church we go to trials and tribulations we go through troubles but Revelations 2 9 says this apocalypsies thank you brother Daniel he says I know your trouble I know your tribulation church although we go through these trials and all these things yes you shall be saved out of it because it's been the grace of God the whole time they hand it out back to you amen how many enjoy that this evening hey man we can I feel like preaching now I could start preaching yeah so in conclusion we're giving all the opportunity tonight amen so it's time for us to make our election and calling sure election time to put away the questions like your questions like is this right or is this wrong question is you're still wondering what our founding Apostle priest is running Pastor if you're still wondering like oh was he right correct you know brother Danny I was just telling my brother this the other day you know and it's been said from behind the pulpit several times yeah our founding Pastor would always say this is now don't take my word for it Go and search it out yourselves but then you'll come back and you'll say he was right all along amen so that should that should be settled in us like people I always hear them that's my typos I'll make a plane to you tonight that's my typos that's my name is my absolute or brother Brown's my absolutely absolutely right well like we heard on Sunday Domingo Elijah already came and you don't even know it is people are looking for things that are already happening man how many can settle it tonight we don't have to wrestle with that no more a lot of times we say oh well oh this level we use the we use the the quote or if we're eating cherry pie we run into a sea we run into something that the ministers those were long time days ago right those are those yeah all right let's just make you laugh amen so let's stand to our future
