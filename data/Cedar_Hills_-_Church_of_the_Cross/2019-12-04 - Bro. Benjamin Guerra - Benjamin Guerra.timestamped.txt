[37:17] prophet and ELISA he said the problem
[37:19] with the church he said I prolific when
[37:21] a glass here is that we take on the
[37:23] spirit of the pastor to receive you must
[37:25] el espíritu the pastoral it's tariff
[37:27] history and well they'll Xperia and a
[37:30] walk like the Passover sundar come on
[37:32] pastor we begin the act like the
[37:34] pastoral because what is the problem
[37:37] with a polemical nestled it's because he
[37:39] said that cuz we come to Christ okay
[37:41] this is given a most a crystal and we
[37:43] say Lord we put ourselves into your
[37:45] hands but I was into smanos I accept
[37:48] your sacrifice
[37:49] that's the sacrificial why do we want to
[37:51] do it okay get a muscle cell we want to
[37:53] try to change ourselves you know most
[37:55] that was a competitor's mismos
[37:57] instead of letting Christ change the
[38:00] weather the car Christo catechin
[38:01] Escambia that's what he means by acting
[38:03] like the pastor's look at Kennedy sick
[38:05] when look Thomas come on pastor oh the
[38:07] pastor does combs his hair this way El
[38:08] Paso she painted esta manera and instead
[38:10] of getting an experience with Christ and
[38:13] lugar they receive an experience take on
[38:15] Chris don't wanna act like the brothers
[38:17] here are most like to work on loserman
[38:18] instead of just surrendering ourselves
[38:20] completely look out there and eNOS
[38:23] completamente IL I say Lord you see
[38:25] Senor I put myself in here your
[38:27] performance to smanos I don't want it to
[38:29] be anything of myself look it okay say
[38:31] another yo mismo whatever you have in
[38:33] store for me but a look a look at the NS
[38:35] but I mean that's what I want it's lukio
[38:37] quiero let's turn to the book of Malachi
[38:44] Hollywood look Monica yes now what kind
[38:50] of chapter 4 and as I was reading this
[38:56] they blew me away totally endorse - even
[38:59] though let's start off with verse 2 but
[39:06] unto you that fear my name misawa's know
[39:10] atomize mean hombre
[39:12] you know we come to God with adios and
[39:14] we have a fear inside of us cinema
[39:17] something more than to the nosotros that
[39:19] we're afraid to go to hell the most
[39:21] middle in fear and we're afraid to die
[39:23] there must be love the marine how we
[39:25] serve God with the fear he said
[39:27] remonster do school noon tomorrow but
[39:28] it's the wrong fear but also the more
[39:31] incorrect you know instead of accepting
[39:32] him as my personal Savior well document
[39:35] means a little personal
[39:36] I want to serve him with my conditions
[39:39] you look at economies condiciones with
[39:40] my fears equal mr. modest but Paul was
[39:43] persuaded I've lost of us to Corrado
[39:46] he didn't have no fear nothing yet the
[39:47] more because he said in Christ
[39:50] forget the one crystal that's my
[39:51] strength this is me Forza so let's
[39:54] ignore the fear that Waits hurts know
[39:56] something more than Salmonella glacial
[39:58] but it's a fear to displease him but
[40:00] they're more than they know don't know
[40:02] plus early Lord I love you so much than
