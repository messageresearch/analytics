[29:20] oh come along with me

[29:34] [Music]
[29:35] it was
[29:38] Lord Jesus Christ bless you
[29:44] invite you to open up your Bibles
[29:50] give me if I'm not too formal
[29:54] um
[29:58] we'd like to honor the word of God as
[30:00] much as we can
[30:03] but to the book of Hebrews chapter 11.
[30:12] verse 5 to verse 7.
[30:24] verse 5 the scripture reads
[30:33] foreign
[30:46] that he should not see death and was not
[30:49] found because God had translated him or
[30:52] before his translation he had his
[30:53] testimony that he pleased God
[30:56] is
[31:04] foreign
[31:06] but without faith it is impossible to
[31:09] please him for he that cometh to God
[31:11] must believe that he is and that he is a
[31:13] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[31:16] Him foreign
[31:35] by faith Noah being warned of God of
[31:37] things not seen as yet move with fear
[31:40] prepared an ark to this to the saving of
[31:43] his house by the which he condemned the
[31:45] world and became heir of the
[31:47] righteousness which is by faith
[31:50] man you may be seated
[31:53] um
[31:59] you days ago the Lord put this on my
[32:02] heart
[32:08] [Music]
[32:21] in different ways
[32:26] and considering these scriptures
[32:30] I'll take in Genesis chapter five
[32:35] so that we can see how this began
[32:43] they're in Genesis chapter 5 verse 22.
[32:49] the scripture reads but on Genesis
[32:53] excuse me Genesis 6 verse 5.
[32:56] hombres
[33:03] is
[33:09] all that the wickedness of man was great
[33:11] in the earth and that every imagination
[33:13] of the thoughts of his heart was only
[33:15] evil continually
[33:19] says
[33:21] by this time in the time of nowhere
[33:26] the world was in a terrible condition
[33:33] possibly like the time we're living in
[33:36] now
[33:37] and when you read about
[33:40] Noah's characteristics you'll find
[33:43] certain correct uh characteristics
[33:46] that compares to today
[33:55] and one of those things that man was
[33:58] only focused on evil is
[34:02] and that is presently the time we are
[34:04] living in
[34:07] Noah
[34:09] keep this in mind
[34:12] is
[34:16] the prophet says typified the people
[34:19] that went through the tribulation
[34:25] that are preparing themselves
[34:28] to stay in the tribulation
[34:33] I don't know where you're standing today
[34:37] but at the same time the prophet says
[34:42] there was a man whose name was Enoch is
[34:46] he was preparing himself
[34:49] to be raptured
[34:54] and and the events that follow
[34:58] and what follows is the resurrection
[35:02] and then the rapture
[35:07] I'm not sure what you're preparing
[35:09] yourself for
[35:11] but according to the scriptures and the
[35:15] prophet
[35:22] this Hit me hard in my heart
[35:27] the prophet says
[35:30] Noah was a grandson
[35:33] said
[35:38] and I said Lord this isn't because I
[35:41] have any sort of Kindred with someone at
[35:43] church
[35:46] you cannot base this because
[35:49] or your mother
[35:53] or perhaps you may think you're past
[35:57] and now you have your salvation secured
[36:02] it is something
[36:04] but it's not everything
[36:09] and I began to worry about this
[36:16] when we read in Genesis chapter five
[36:19] assistant
[36:23] you realize that Noah had to be warned
[36:26] this is
[36:56] you cannot wait for Los Angeles
[37:00] you should be ready
[37:08] by faith
[37:12] worked with God
[37:15] by faith
[37:18] worked with God
[37:22] the difference is one had faith
[37:26] stay here on Earth
[37:29] and the other had Faith to go in the
[37:31] Rapture
[37:33] many people today
[37:37] they are basing their thoughts
[37:40] to stay here you know the Las Costas one
[37:43] of the things
[37:45] that we can see in the scriptures
[37:49] Noah had to be warned
[38:01] again
[38:05] but that Grace that he found was not
[38:07] enough
[38:09] keep that in mind
[38:13] hopefully
[38:16] begin to think
[38:19] which side am I on
[38:23] stop where is my faith laying
[38:27] because one day
[38:30] the prophet says one of these days
[38:33] they will call the policemen
[38:38] what happened
[38:41] my daughter was here and she disappeared
[38:45] and the police officer was
[38:51] 500 calls this morning the same thing
[38:54] what happened
[38:57] a people has left
[39:01] my question is
[39:05] and this goes for myself which side am I
[39:08] on
[39:10] which side are you on
[39:14] Lester be the name of the Lord
[39:18] armor
[39:29] to be able to reach grace and mercy and
[39:32] Enoch Enoch he walked with God
[39:39] the prophet of God says
[39:48] I believe the coming of the Lord
[39:53] as I said
[40:02] the second coming is past due
[40:05] numbers
[40:06] the message the seven compound names of
[40:09] Jehovah
[40:12] the the date is past due
[40:17] it is already passed
[40:20] and like it was in the days
[40:26] God waiting not willing any should
[40:29] perish
[40:50] so the second coming can take place
[40:55] the problem of today is
[41:00] one wants to make their own Ark
[41:11] according to the plan of God it will
[41:15] perish
[41:17] character the prophet says
[41:23] other ships came by Noah open open up
[41:27] could not open
[41:31] because it was God who shut it
[41:40] what kind of people are we to be
[41:45] we know
[41:54] you send a boy to school when he comes
[41:56] back you don't know what happened
[42:01] you can't leave the the boy with your
[42:03] answers
[42:05] it becomes a serious problem
[42:11] the desire of man is to always do evil
[42:17] fathers mothers be careful with this
[42:20] coach yes
[42:21] see who you trust your children with
[42:27] El Primo the cousin
[42:32] say Satan is very
[42:35] watch out
[42:38] we're in a world field of evil
[42:47] he says
[42:52] to realize that this day may be the last
[42:55] day we'll ever be mortal
[42:57] would you be happy
[43:05] this may be your last day to be mortal
[43:08] ity
[43:11] tomorrow we may be immortal
[43:15] s how many desire that
[43:18] oh
[43:21] we heard that the message this morning
[43:29] very emotional I almost shouted back
[43:32] there
[43:35] foreign
[44:04] of yours oh God
[44:08] allow me to be like
[44:11] tomorrow when the hour comment that I
[44:15] should take this path
[44:18] that I may find the King's Highway
[44:27] I can see Enoch
[44:30] he was becoming to him
[44:33] he knew what was going to happen
[44:38] um
[44:39] I can see him kiss his wife
[44:42] a kiss goodbye and say Amor darling
[44:48] I'll see you later
[44:53] take up his children and give them a
[44:56] kiss
[45:02] and kiss them goodbye
[45:11] are you going out for a little walk
[45:15] yes going for a stroll
[45:18] but that day
[45:29] and he went to unto Glory
[45:34] I don't know what you're waiting for
[45:36] that's yeah
[45:37] it's time brother
[45:40] to go home
[45:47] don't wait for tomorrow to get in order
[45:53] come on to live like Noah
[45:56] then relax continue yes
[46:00] that won't stop God
[46:07] if you are preparing to stay
[46:10] a problem no a problem
[46:15] [Music]
[46:18] [Applause]
[46:20] each time I sit at the table to eat
[46:25] I'm thinking Lord
[46:28] how are we today
[46:36] one of these days brother
[46:41] we'll see our loved ones
[46:44] [Applause]
[46:45] my question is
[46:48] are you preparing for that
[46:52] how many believe that
[46:54] is
[46:59] it's for the crate is for the crazies
[47:04] Paul when they had to stand before an
[47:06] audience yes
[47:15] yes
[47:16] and he caused a scandal
[47:20] the assembly divided
[47:23] but one day
[47:25] it'll happen
[47:27] if you don't believe it
[47:31] but there will be a resurrection
[47:35] one of these days
[47:38] that love when you lost
[47:41] be there sitting next to you
[47:48] and if you have not prepared yourself
[47:51] and you will not be able to
[47:54] take flight
[48:01] this gets me excited
[48:06] I I have people that are waiting waiting
[48:10] for me
[48:13] get excited
[48:20] if you're in sin get away from sins
[48:26] there is great promises for he that
[48:29] believes
[48:33] it says a Noah yeah
[48:35] which is a type
[48:38] this thing
[48:39] is
[48:44] the type of Israel that's carried over
[48:46] will be over there on Mount
[48:48] Transfiguration down in Palestine
[48:52] when Noah saw Enoch was missing
[49:06] where's he at oh
[49:08] my brother
[49:10] um
[49:12] perhaps one of the day these days you'll
[49:15] come to church
[49:16] where's brother Caleb at
[49:20] um
[49:21] where's the deacon
[49:23] oh brother
[49:26] it'll be too late
[49:31] it's why God is warning us today
[49:37] that day to come
[49:42] don't understand where is he at
[49:46] which was his grandson
[49:49] Noah was grandson
[49:52] and he said where's it at what become of
[49:56] him
[50:06] he knowed that the time was at hand
[50:08] right then
[50:10] oh my brother
[50:19] Prophet says
[50:30] I see the church going into its
[50:32] laodicean condition
[50:35] I see little isms
[50:38] and fashion
[50:40] oh brother
[50:45] how is this this makes us look to the
[50:47] mirror of the word
[50:52] the fashions
[50:56] little Sensations
[51:01] scattering the church and separating it
[51:05] making it worse than ever
[51:09] then not then I know it's time
[51:12] I can't help it
[51:13] I'll go into
[51:17] something in me makes me scream out back
[51:20] to the world
[51:22] many people today Brothers
[51:26] they
[51:30] put the other part aside
[51:34] that ship will not resist
[51:38] oh Church of the Living God
[51:40] how can it be
[51:43] the last few days
[51:47] I've been torn and up early for morning
[51:50] prayers
[51:52] and I said to God the other morning he
[51:54] also
[51:56] I said God I don't know what more you
[51:58] can do
[52:00] I have don't I have done as you have
[52:02] told us
[52:03] as far as I know
[52:07] the people constantly drifting
[52:10] drifting I said
[52:16] the next thing you'll have to move
[52:17] yourself
[52:18] you've got to put a face
[52:22] and confidence
[52:24] is personas and those people's hearts
[52:27] to believe it
[52:31] or all I could do will never change it
[52:37] if God doesn't put that faith in your
[52:39] heart
[52:41] brother Brandon tells us
[52:43] I have done everything that I know to do
[52:48] but what happens
[52:51] Donald Trump
[52:52] says I can't do it
[53:00] what happened to you lutherans
[53:05] many years ago at the First Reformation
[53:10] you
[53:14] were God's light
[53:17] what happened to you
[53:19] foreign
[53:56] but there's more scriptures than that
[54:02] so we can't take away from the
[54:04] scriptures or can we add to it
[54:10] your ship will not withstand
[54:16] this is what a prophet said
[54:20] and knowing we are in such an evil times

[55:50] foreign
[56:22] hey man
[56:28] amen don't you love him this fine
[56:30] evening
[56:33] thank you
[56:36] thank you Pastor for the confidence
[56:39] you've given us tonight
[56:42] what a word we've heard today
[56:46] amen I believe you know in
[56:49] you know we could be Fanatics
[56:52] you know but sometimes we you know
[56:56] got to get out of the line but um
[56:59] you know we got to get excited about
[57:01] God's word
[57:03] and after hearing what we heard this
[57:07] morning
[57:08] my my heart was overjoyed
[57:14] you know to to get ready here
[57:17] and it was
[57:22] it was hard waiting between Services
[57:26] knowing that it was my lot to
[57:29] to let God use us tonight
[57:32] and God is good let's turn to the
[57:36] scriptures and I'll let let you be
[57:38] seated
[57:40] let's turn to the Book of Mark Chapter 5
[57:43] Verse 22 Marcos
[57:46] and the word of God reads like this
[57:49] and behold there cometh one of the
[57:53] rulers of the synagogue
[58:02] and when he saw him he fell at his feet
[58:07] may God add the blessings to the reading
[58:10] of his word you may be seated
[58:14] amen this last panel we did was very
[58:18] impact for me on the red heifer
[58:23] you know because you know we we just
[58:26] heard Brothers
[58:28] but were it impacted me the most
[58:32] you know it lets us see something
[58:35] and and what the picture that
[58:39] picture that it paints
[58:41] because we see what God is doing in his
[58:44] word
[58:46] but then we see a reflection of today
[58:49] [Music]
[58:51] seems they lived under the law yes
[58:55] we live under grace
[58:58] but it seems like we do away
[59:02] with all the requirements that God has
[59:05] for us
[59:07] many times we serve God
[59:10] like you were a Catholic
[59:13] because we know that there's repentance
[59:17] here foreign
[1:00:48] how did he get to the place
[1:01:08] [Music]
[1:01:32] [Music]
[1:01:53] so it came to a point
[1:01:56] Betty how to make a decision
[1:01:59] because many times in the Bible
[1:02:01] does the an action take place
[1:02:05] but God was already working on Jerrys
[1:02:09] because every time Jesus did something
[1:02:13] serious
[1:02:15] he heard about this
[1:02:17] he heard about that
[1:02:20] he heard the parable that Jesus talked
[1:02:23] about
[1:02:25] and inside the heart of Jerry
[1:02:32] the only way
[1:02:43] [Music]
[1:02:47] that he has to make that decision
[1:02:50] so we find him at the feet of Jesus
[1:02:54] Jesus but I've heard the prophet foreign
[1:03:27] there was a crowd that Cameo and the
[1:03:31] scripture says
[1:03:32] that Jesus stopped yes
[1:03:39] on the way to Jersey's house
[1:03:44] what happened
[1:03:46] the Lord is
[1:03:49] to to experience something
[1:03:52] experience we know the story of the
[1:03:57] woman with the blood issues
[1:04:00] and all she had to do
[1:04:04] foreign
[1:05:21] oh
[1:05:22] only believe solo prayer
[1:05:25] [Applause]
[1:05:27] you think the prophet of God
[1:05:31] just came up with the only believes
[1:05:40] don't worry
[1:05:43] he goes into jarius's house
[1:05:46] he says
[1:05:48] you're unbelievers
[1:05:51] get out
[1:05:53] he cast out all unbelief
[1:05:58] a total separation

[1:06:31] you know I told the Lord recently
[1:06:34] it's a lord
[1:06:37] of playing games
[1:06:40] I'm tired of seeing the people of this
[1:06:42] condition so he can solve it
[1:06:46] what can I do yeah and you know what the
[1:06:49] Lord told me he said the prophet of God
[1:06:52] says that's the United States
[1:06:56] needs more missionaries
[1:07:03] but he said let's bring it down
[1:07:07] Church
[1:07:08] he's more missionaries
[1:07:12] then what are you doing get here he said
[1:07:16] it just doesn't rest on the pastor
[1:07:18] he's a character
[1:07:21] is that where is the love because you
[1:07:25] have for God
