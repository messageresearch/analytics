privilege to be here and and our pastor would have the confidence to put this old warrior up here i don't mean when i say oh warrior i'm not refrenching my physical agenda we're going to speak a little subject tonight by the grace of god [Music] thank god this opportunity if you'd be so kind to open your bibles to micah chapter five amen praise the lord jesus check michael chapter 5 and we're going to read verse 2. almost though thou be little among the thousands of judah yet out of thee shall come forth unto me that is to be ruler in israel whose goings forth have been from old from everlasting i like the way it says that is going for us from old from all the time since eternity more or less jesus that's incredible let's go to luke chapter 2 verse 11. amen how many are happy to be in the house of the lord amen amen but now bethlehem ephrata oh you didn't change it yet i was going to read the same verse again well it's still the same city but we're it's going to have another name now for unto you is born this day in the city of david a savior which is christ the lord amen let us pray dear lord jesus we just thank you this evening for the privilege to be in your presence to have your presence live in our hearts we just love you and we thank [Music] amen i mean we're going to start off so simple tonight because things have a way of getting deep for me [Music] amen and we're gonna talk about a little word that we probably use a lot okay and the paragraph that i have here is there it's actually paragraph 25b i don't know if we're on the that's not paragraph but that's okay yeah the paragraph was to start guys with you say i belong to the church let me go ahead and just read what i have on my notes here amen you say i belong to church jesus said except the man be born again he will in no wise enter in this video [Music] it was so tremendous this statement that he made here and he's quoting matthew 22 verse 14. and it's exactly what it says here he says but don't be miserable be chosen be a chosen yeah how can you be your chosen but now we're going to see the definition of the word be our musa amen i'll wait for you if not i'll go ahead and take off here okay very well i'll go to the definition here the word be from the webster dictionary the dictionary to have there we go now we've got it we've got it to have an objective existence significant existence my you there's an objective for your existence there's a reason who caused you to be here tonight what caused you to be here tonight oh my goodness or occupy a place situation situation or position now we will start to see what it is to be a christian significant undisturbed wow how many say that your existence what do you think is for existence to be the chosen one it seems like this quote says that if you're born again then you can be chosen and we look at this little place of bethlehem smallest of any little domain in all of judah and even when joshua under the inspiration of the holy spirit was dividing out the land to each of the 12 tribes when he divided out what judah was supposed to have it didn't even mention this little town this little place called bethlehem it wasn't even in the inheritance well joshua divided out to judah what he was going to have when he crossed over and sometimes we feel that way and brother branham says why and then we wonder why god would pick on that little bitty town of bethlehem against the little town of bethlehem it seemed like god had something against it if you would study the history of what happened just to for this little town to come about puello have you ever felt like why is it that i get picked on all the time [Music] let anything bother you it's so something so simple so what the prophet said this these questions came to me is he isn't that the question that many of us have in our mind this is oh have you ever thought that way nobody has ever thought that way people thought well yeah maybe i'm called but i'm not chosen oh you are chosen why if you're born again born again the word of the age man how many are born of this word of the age quantus [Music] and the ages that that process came through brings you to a full birth amen i like the way he said it in spanish because there's another quote where he says it's the complete birth but brother jimmy if we're born in bethlehem how many have read this message how many young people have read this message one in 1958 and the other in 1963 and he says beth let him belin what does the word beth mean house or that's why he had to be born in bethlehem this little insignificant place is significant [Music] and the prophet says it was just like maybe one or two little houses maybe he went there to start a little business to start another society another community but he started he founded this little place out of all the 150 cities or more in palestine palestine did you say 150 100 yes this little place was the smallest of all of them what made it so incredible it was the most fertile place in all of palestine great orchards of olives oh it was the place of bread that you could get bread there out of all of palestine this little bitty insignificant place insignificant this is where the house of god's bread was naturally speaking and other peoples came from other parts yotras personal dignity lugares to buy their wheat for a comparison to buy their olives [Music] it was such a further place but yet so insignificant insignificant and you say brother jimmy what does that have to do with being born in bethlehem being born again oh if you can be born again you can be chosen for you can't put a price on it there's no quantity of money that you could ever pay for this little place bethlehem i'm so brand new in the message but if the rapture comes and i i don't seem to go with you all well i'll see you at the great white throne nobody's ever stopped like that huh just crazy business crazy brothers jimmy questions and answers i'm not going to go to the quote brothers that's why i didn't give it to you i'm just going to read it if you want to mark it down 19 59 questions will a babe in christ go in the rapture um my brother no he said no okay no anybody else will have david christ go in the rapture yes also we have yes and no no i would think before i i read this i i thought no whoever said no neither one of us are right but but at least we're honestly we give an answer right [Music] no but a person in the denominational world gets a hold of the act of what the new birth is just to accept jesus as your savior born in bethlehem amen i mean believe that everybody understand let me see how many understand it if you're born again can you imagine a little place like this little church that we have here saying that i learned when i was growing up not but you don't know it's what's inside that this little place it's the wheat of the world it's amen if you guys got it up there okay which paragraph is this is this paragraph 50 okay how that god has set some in the church through labor pains there you go labor pains the lord brother why do i have pain hermano when a church is groaning under the persecution of the outside world believing on the lord jesus christ that the promise of the holy ghost is just as real to us as it was permanente how they groan and cry under labor pains and when they are born here's our subtitle and positionally born into the kingdom impositional [Music] ghost is said in the church do you believe that god has set these ministries in the church how many believe that raise your hand you know amen and we talk about the word perfection it doesn't mean you don't break a plate though it means that you come to a maturity significa it means that perfection to god significa is not what perfection is to a human being my brothers and sisters that have been baptized by the holy ghost to the body of christ amen some apostles apostles all he said where if god be with us this he's giving all this through through being born again and they come back with a big thing of groups that grapes that was dragging the ground they had a grape for everybody they had gone over they had brought back the evidence and brother brennan says in the great warriors all of them had heard the world because their how many are happy tonight what does bethlehem mean to you you know i love testifying to jehovah's witness lori and i asked him are you sure about that isn't the word jehovah also a translation noise the they can't handle that nope i think is some second person like their bible bible that they have interpreted on their own in the in john 1 1. oh what a disgrace oh jesus change that's why they have jesus lester than god but in the beginning was the word before it was the word we know it was a thought a little [Music] [Music] do you know who she married another person and he was a jewish prince principle [Music] and they settled down there in bethlehem which is a type of the bride in christ [Music] he wasn't a gentile but it was a type of christ in the bride perez rahab was a gentile and there rahab had children and you can go from there to all the way to obed to jesse to boaz you can follow it all the way through the scriptures all these things happening in this little insignificant place bethlehem significante and this little place we have here yes significantly insignificant oh oh my how could this all happen in such a little place can you be [Music] and go to paragraph 110 guys okay wow one now when could that who could doubt that that's what paul said that's paul's scriptures that's paul's writing that's and his labor pain was bringing forth established bringing forth you let's say bringing forth me oh my how could god have a labor plan that after we were he saw us rejoicing in our salvation before we ever sinned before we ever sinned what you would do not what you would talk about what i would talk about he positionally placed you into his own praise the living god [Music] [Music] oh the politicians don't want to say those things oh yes we'll take care of ourselves yes we will wash our hands with people yeah yes but i'm not depending respect my brother and sisters absolutely i'm not going to be wearing a mask over there i'm going to tell you that right now and i'm not throwing it against well let's continue with our message [Music] how many can give an applause to their precious little ladies my precious little lady virginia virginia oh she carries her name well give us a nombre muy bien you know what i mean right come in wow wow isn't your wife precious by the way no it's supposed to be oh man look at our first lady sister lordana and all of us we name all of them to be a housewife put that quote back up there again i've got like to be a housewife [Music] but if you can love me even if you don't understand me yeah it should be my wife oh now she understands me a little bit you know i feel checked right there to stop i've already been going 45 do you feel this present is there any reason for you to walk out that door without receiving what you came asking for can you imagine david his own city where he was born [Music] that's why it says in luke 2 11. until he was born in the city of david he was one of the eight sides and he was to be king [Music] and now we have david on the outside looking down into the city he was born went into that little well oh i just wish i had the [Music] [Music] all you have to do is have a desired killing philistines on the right in the left matando philistiles but [Music] and the water of life and when jesus came and was born lord jesus he was not just the bread of god from heaven he was the water of life at this time of the year where people celebrate the birth of jesus [Music] and he brought [Music] and we surrender our lives to you lord jesus jesus that in this next year [Music] we can serve you like never before and if it would be the
