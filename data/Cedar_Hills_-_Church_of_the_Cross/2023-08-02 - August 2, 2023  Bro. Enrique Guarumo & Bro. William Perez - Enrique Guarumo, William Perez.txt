to give glory to God let us pray Brothers to give thanks to God we should be thankful to God as this word says it says to be thankful for everything foreign let's pray knowing that we are unworthy people but by your grace you have reached us yes and you have provided the very best for us and that is your word and now Heavenly Father we pray that you forgive our sins and our failures it says there as if someone has sent confidence we have confidence therefore in God that you will help us tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask let's open our Bibles to Genesis chapter 22. uh considering there are many pictures many ministers they preached the bridge they have spoken about this chapter is speaking about Abraham is always a blessing when we hear it yeah believing God here we're going to see a few different things to really see if we were really believing God or not verse 1 says and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abram Abraham and said unto him Abraham he said behold here I am almost and he said take now your son your only son Isaac whom you love and get into the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell you of yeah and Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of the young men with him and Isaac his son and split the wood for the burnt offering and Rose up and went to the place which God had told him and then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place so far off and this is and Abraham said unto his his young men abide you here with the ass and I and the lad will go Yonder and worship and come again to you you may be seated brother uh it's a situation a very difficult time here that Abraham's going and Abraham has to make a decision the prophet said he believed God when God requires something from us and he wants us to believe him uh he's speaking about doctors and so many things that are happening tomorrow [Music] many times we come into those circumstances because we go to the doctor yeah then the battle starts in our mind let's go uh Abraham the prophet said didn't say anything to his wife Sarah the prophet said if he would have told her she would have screamed she would have cried out actually there's many things personally as ministers when God speaks to his servants sometimes the servant has to do that do it without saying anything and sometimes he doesn't have to give explanations because if you give explanations then other consequences come uh uh I want to emphasize on something when Abraham started that trip to go to this mountain because you said that Abraham put the wood on top of Isaac Abraham took the fire in his hands but his son Isaac was asking him a question whereas then the sacrifice okay it's really easy to start a Christian Life and You Begin walking in your walk then you start thinking what's going to happen later when they got to that place Abraham tells his servants okay Muchachos right here you can stay here now and I'm gonna go to this mountain I'm Gonna Worship and we're going to return we're going to come back but Abraham knew in his heart what God was expecting of him he said that Abraham asked God he says he says Lord you know I love my son how many of you love your children raise your hands up put yourself in on that thing in that place if God would come and tell you you know I want you to sacrifice your son to me why am I honorable no no maybe not um maybe the Lord tells me put myself to sacrifice him you think about it just to think about it no no no that's not God but Abraham believed God and we will come back his faith was being proved right okay are there many Christians today and many give glory to God for that there's a time in your life that your faith has to be tried the first thing he does is he tries them don't think it's because you surrender the Lord God's going to give you a house he's going to give you a card no no God will test you and I am a person that hardly ever complains about anything it don't says I was praying and I said to the Lord is good Lord you don't have to heal me but then in your grace Lord It's good to you okay that I I will be healed Lord It's that's fine with me if I'm gonna be like this yes also everything's okay everything okay sometimes we think sometimes we think that God has to do these things we think that he has to but foreign thing I can't do nothing for you but God it's the same because God is the god of laws [Applause] because the prophet said this in the message he wanted to heal a lot of people it is and he said the Holy Spirit came and rebuked him for that reason because he had compassion enough but the Holy Spirit told him I did not send you for that all we think oh God has to do such and such a thing that's what he said I don't do anything when he shows me then I'll do it continuing the scene of Abraham and his son what gets my attention is yeah you cannot answer oh yeah he's the clock's not moving okay brothers when they got to that place is there Isaac was the prophet said he was about 15 years old maybe between 15 and 18 years old here I'm gonna speak about something okay when they got to that place Abraham knew what he was going to do and can you imagine here here's the word here's we have the fire Isaac was very restless that his question was where's the sacrifice and then Abraham looks at his son and he said he said Isaac put your hands together maybe he takes a little cord out of his pocket and he begins to tie him down and Isaac looking at his father dad what are you gonna do where is oh you are the sacrifice maybe we could get one of one of the young guys to help oh they would run they would run out of here I said no no not me not me then I asked myself the question God requires something of us and we don't do it I said God what attitude did Isaac have okay he didn't refuse his father and he he led his father time it's very easy brother to sit in the Judgment seat is I don't need such and such things but we don't understand what we have but behind what we have today there are persons and people that had to sacrifice or to stay for me for you and for me maybe you don't see it that way because they were believing EE akimo is this may have been a few times I've been able to hear it here it's such a tremendous history such a high position being a judge of the Republic of Colombia and you're having all of that foreign preachers salvation is going to come many times we make light of that is to be able to obey God through his word many times myself I have a lot of dreams I heard we don't talk about them but I have many dreams I was in a place where there was a lot of machinery he said go and bring that tree one of these workers and time went by and they didn't come with what he had told them this man in the dream tells me what happened with these men that I told to go do that he goes well I'm going to go when I got there what they were doing what they were not told to do oh my God I said oh my god oh and then I went and told the boss they're doing such and such a thing and he goes oh my goodness he was an elderly because that's the reason why we don't Advance because your men that are doing things that haven't been they haven't been sent to do those things I said Lord I woke up and I said Lord is disturbing somebody else's walk uh and I began to pray to the Lord and I said Lord forgive me if I'm a person that's keeping somebody else back from advancing you need in this message foreign it's the same with me it is they don't believe that's why they cannot receive the benefit of his word when I said Lord all the promises you have in the Bible why they don't they don't all work then what are you gonna tell them I said no no I'm not I am not going to die it's not easy he says every soul that sins that soul will die but your soul if you're a believer of God any devil yes I'm studying the message adoption right now I'm going to reach up in the prophet says the prophet says the following do you see a minute to say is but in this time God came and explained it he says now your name your name is the same as his out three times your name your name my name my name is the same is his look here Satan I am Enrique say and here it says my name is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Enrique or Jimmy is gonna cast you out what do you think happened it happened just like that the pain left okay like we heard the messages put your name the devil can't challenge if he challenges he knows what he's coming up against foreign I know that the devil believes our subject is the devil believes but he cannot obey numbers in my name they shall cast out devils and the prophet of God says his name is the best thing that he could have given to his children that you will be able to believe him and it was so hot there you know it hadn't rained the house we were at didn't have water we went to town and there was no water we come there you try to sometimes be real humble maybe you'll hear me sometimes when God speaks it comes with inspiration you have to learn sometimes God speaks things when you're going to speak it you don't feel the same and I asked him do you believe in God I said in five minutes it's gonna rain I mean I'm happy I said Lord you can believe God you're not looking at the circumstances yeah when the doctor tells you you can't eat anything solid or you do you're gonna die he probably said he went home and he was reading his Bible he read that they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recovery here with Isaiah by his stripes we were healed we had never had a prayer the prophet came out with his Bible he said Dad can we pray yeah and then he said God is looking at me he was all surprised his word says that I am already healed you know the history how he began to feel worse but he said no God just heal me anyway brother when you believe God Abraham believed God he was not looking at his body he was almost like he was looking at what God had told him tells you he has already healed you it's your decision to believe him or not you can stand your feet remember scratch [Applause] amen that's brother varumo this this evening something sounds so simple but yet but yeah I make it pretty pretty difficult sometimes amen how many are happy to be in the house of the Lord this evening amen we're uh we're gonna read a couple of uh read a script for this uh this evening I want to thank our our pastor for this opportunity to to be here and um be able to share What the Lord Has has uh has in my heart amen we're going to turn into the book of Acts chapter 27. I'm going to start with verse 13. you have it say Amen and when the south wind blew Softly supposing that they had obtained their purpose losing dents they sailed closed by Crete is but not long after there arose against the Tempest a tempestus wind called The Rocks anybody wants to know what your octodon is a hurricane so you know what Paul was dealing with amen and when the ship was caught and could not bear up into the wind we let her drive is and running under a certain Island which is called clauda we hadn't we had much work to come by the boat yeah which when they had taken up they used helps under girding the ship and fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands straight sail and so we're driven Yuna Wes and we've been exceedingly tossed with the Tempest the next day they lie in the ship and the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship is and when neither Sun nor stars and many days appeared and no small Tempest lay on us all hope that we should be saved was then taken away amen may the Lord His blessings to the reading of the word you may be seated we want to bring uh bring greetings from the from there at Jericho Tabernacle from Brother foreign [Music] we had a wonderful wonderful time this past weekend there we were close to Show Low Arizona I tell you the the mountains they aren't uh it's not any cooler in the mountains than it is here in the in the desert but even a little bit of of lower degrees was was nice you know we had a tremendous subject of of the meetings was Prayer Changes Things how many are familiar with prayer few of us have prayed change things amen we just heard a beautiful message about about that is you know we had a similar event happen on Sunday morning brother and brother Enrique I talked about uh about rain about him praying for rain it had been dry all weekend brother gets up there and he says Lord we just want that Cool Breeze to come in and just just cool it down in here well there was there was there was people outside of the tent there was some uh some Electronics outside there like the faucet of of heavens of just just came open for about 30 40 minutes like you've never seen before so after after uh after service yeah disposal service I told him I said I know that the scripture for the services that the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth mucho man it was too much but you know it's it's the way that God works sometimes you know we don't we don't realize sometimes what God is doing in our lives amen man there's so many times we we feel that our life is insignificant which is we're so we're we we feel sometimes that our lives ain't worth mucho but look at all you know in this story Paul was being sent being sent to Romeo Aroma it was being said to trial and he found himself in a predicament he's saying found himself on a boat let's go back to acts 27 and I tell you he was in the storm of his life so many times when we're in the storm of our lives our our prayer or the way that we approach God sometimes it says Lord take us out of this storm take me out of this situation whatever it may be just take me okay I can't go through it I don't want to go through it but here's Paul as he's going through this but after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them and said sirs ye should have hearkened unto me and not have loose from Crete and to have gained this harm and loss this is and now I exhort to you to be of good cheer for there shall be no loss of any man's life amongst you but of the ship was for there stood by me this night the angel of God whose I am and whom I serve only saying fear not Paul siendo Pablo no temas thou must be brought before Caesar is you know Paul didn't say I know you're going to take our you're going to stop this storm you're gonna you're gonna take me back and everything is going to be fine no the angel didn't do that for Paul he said so what you were sent for I don't know if we stand he says I'm going to take you through this storm so that what your destination is what's going to happen there will be accomplished God many times doesn't take us out of our condition but what he does he takes us through our conditions something that's very very important when we look in the book of Isaiah chapter 43. it says but now thus saith the Lord that created Theo Jacob and he that formed the O Israel fear not for I have redeemed Thee I have called thee by name and thou art mine I see this is what now passes through the waters I will be with thee yesterday Contigo and through the rivers they shall not overflow when thou walkest through the fire when the buses thou shall not be burned neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee what an amazing scripture that is this evening when we know that God is taking us through something we won't be overflowns you won't be burned we'll pass through the waters and through it all yeah he is with us how many have served the Lord for 10 years how many have served the Lord for 20 years 30 years 40 years 50 years 60 years imagine that 60 years and I can still see my uncle Abraham he's been through a lot of storms he's been through a lot of fires but never once has God not been with him he owes myself amen amen you could say the same thing about you the different parts where you came from everything that God has brought you through you can say Lord I know it's difficult this time oh Lord but thank you so much for being with me it takes me to a to a little too little story you know there is there's this little there's this little bird that the Bible speaks quite a bit about how many times we think of eagles and we want everybody wants oh Eagles are amazing yes let me check this out nobody wants to be an eagle yeah but you know what better sometimes we feel like a sparrows insignificant insignificant not very pretty Bonito bony legs just we feel like that sometimes you just feel like man I'm just not proportioned spiritually I'm just out of kilter I'm just out of alignment I'm just out of shape and we we just we we don't feel we don't feel powerful we we see the storms that we're in and we're like you know what I just I just can't make it through this but this is this is so beautiful this is this is called the thrush Sparrow where it says it says the thrush Sparrow sings many beautiful songs but there is one song that the that the thrush sparrows sing that is amazing it says the only time the thrush Sparrow is known to sing her most beautiful song is [Music] when it's in a terrible dangerous storm it sings its most glorious beautiful song when it's wounded or hurt real bad it sings its most beautiful song because you see the storm can never stop the song Sister Sister Laura that song you sing I've still got a song we've still got a song after all these years after all these trials we can be like that little bitty insignificant bird that sings their most glorious their most inspired song and it's a song yes that only the redeemed can sing because they have been through the flood they bought a lot of Wars they have fought a lot of battles muchas in 2023 on August 2nd we're still singing our songs praise the Lord for the foreign [Applause] how amuable are they Tabernacles the Lord of hosts so long even painted for the courts of the Lord my heart and my flesh cryeth out for the Living God the sparrow Health bound I don't know about you this morning but I can I can see David writing this is the Lord how beautiful your Tabernacle is How Majestic it is even that little insignificant but can you put that bird up again even this little Sparrow he understands where he belongs yea the sparrow hath found in house and to swallow a nest for herself where she may lay her Young even thine altar the Lord of hosts my God my king and my God blessed are they that dwell in thy house you see even that little Sparrow was blessed imagine that little bitty Sparrow about four to six inches long is blessed are they that dwell in thy house they will still be praising them Book of Luke chapter 12. verses six through seven siete but I will forewarn you whom whom ye shall fear fear Him I'm sorry we're going to start with five fear Him which after he hath killed hath power to pass into hell yea I say unto you fear Him is are not five sparrows sold or two farthings imagine that five sparrows for just a couple of cents [Music] just think about that and not one of them just a couple of cents not worth mucho and not one of them is you know that's that's that's so tremendous Jesus but even the very hairs of your head are all numbered fear not therefore ye are a more value than many parents I don't know if you can tell your neighbor we are more value than many sparrows um that is that is that is so good it says that is just so amazing to us this is you know we we don't even realize sometimes how significant okay significant we are to God but I want you to know this is something there there was a there was a woman her name was Sevilla Martin she was uh she was Canadian Canada she she went to visit some friends up in New York are you in New York they got to be pretty pretty close friends one day as she was visiting with her husband the the the wife had been bedridden for about 20 years the husband was he was crippled and he was on a wheelchairs one day they asked what is your secret why through all that you've been through why do you why are you so happy and content okay well Mrs Doolittle that's what what what her name was simply said this is I is on The Sparrows and I know he watches me she was gripped with so much emotion that she couldn't contain herself she went into the next room and she began to write the songs why should I feel discouraged animal why should the Shadows come from why should my heart be lonely and long for heaven and home when Jesus is my portion Jesus says my constant friend is His Eyes On The Sparrows and I know he watches me I Sing Because I'm happy I sing I'm free for his eyes and I know you'll say he watches me imagine that song over a hundred years ago for a day like today the old testamento there was no worshiper that could approach god with empty hands because the Old Testament worship it involved sacrifices gifts and offerings regardless your friend he had no gift there was no worship God made no provision for freeloaders in his economy if they were in poverty they could trap but they could bring in a turtle dove [Music] um for the sacrifice or they could bring in a sparrow but they could not worship empty-handed this this evening I asked each and every one of you what do you have in your kitchen what is in your hand for worship so many times we come empty-handed we can't come with our hands empty but even if we come yeah it's something that is just worth a couple of cents God still accepts that sacrifice something that's insignificant significantly God still accepts as the sacrifice you know it's it's amazing it's maravilloso what God can do with us when we are without strength with us that when we're battered and bruised by by our trials it's amazing what God can still do is with the little bitty bird if he can do that with something so small something that is insignificant to to the World Imagine with what he can do if he knows where every single Sparrow has fallen has died by the blood of the Lamb foreign there's a story as you stand historia when the bur when the birds begin to worry and the lilies and God's creatures all are anxious then I also May begin for my father sets their table decks them out and garments fine and he and if he supplies their living will he not provide for mine no problem just as noisy common sparrows can be found most anywhere until some just worthless creatures if they perish who would care yet our heavenly father numbers Every Creature Great and Small caring even for the sparrows Martin went to Earth they Fallen if his children's hairs are numbered numerados why should we be filled with fear he has promised all that's needful is necessary and in trouble amen God bless you amen and we sing that song his eyes [Applause] [Music] foreign
