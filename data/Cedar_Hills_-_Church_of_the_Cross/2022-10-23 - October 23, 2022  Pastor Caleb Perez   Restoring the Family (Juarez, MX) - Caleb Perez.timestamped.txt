[1:09:27] this morning
[1:09:29] forgive me I've been a little bit under
[1:09:32] the weather I don't know if my voice
[1:09:33] will hold up
[1:09:36] [Music]

[1:09:48] anointing
[1:09:49] the different spirit is
[1:09:52] the same Holy Spirit
[1:09:55] but we want to just then just calm down
[1:09:59] a little bit
[1:10:01] and see what the Lord wants to tell us
[1:10:06] so is that okay we study a little bit
[1:10:09] this morning
[1:10:11] how many are here want to learn
[1:10:14] amen and so we we put a title to the
[1:10:19] message
[1:10:22] restoring the family restaurant La
[1:10:25] Familia
[1:10:27] I say it again restoring the family
[1:10:31] restaurant La Familia I believe that
[1:10:34] that is so important today
[1:10:39] as we see the theme of the services
[1:10:45] it is the unity of the one God in the
[1:10:47] one Church
[1:10:51] how many gods cuantos dioses
[1:11:01] not very sure how many gods cuantos
[1:11:04] dioses
[1:11:10] and how many churches
[1:11:16] why are there so many churches
[1:11:20] how many gods cuantos dioses
[1:11:23] how many churches Iglesias okay then
[1:11:27] let's see what the Lord has for us
[1:11:28] Genesis 1 1.
[1:11:32] he's going to help us read
[1:11:36] and it says you know that by heart in
[1:11:40] the beginning God created the heavens
[1:11:43] Earth
[1:11:46] sientos
[1:12:00] man
[1:12:01] and so we find out here
[1:12:05] that in the beginning God the word God
[1:12:08] here is Elohim
[1:12:13] tell your neighbor this is this is ABCs
[1:12:17] all right this is easy in the beginning
[1:12:22] who created the heavens and the Earth
[1:12:27] was
[1:12:31] Elohim Elohim a man amen now
[1:12:35] we want to set a stage here
[1:12:39] because we want to see really it's
[1:12:42] almost bad how these things unfolded
[1:12:46] I want to start with reading the from
[1:12:49] the message the adoption number one
[1:12:52] element
[1:12:54] before he made man
[1:12:58] he called himself
[1:13:01] l Ella Elohim
[1:13:08] the word means in Hebrew la palabra
[1:13:11] significa the self-existence
[1:13:17] all by himself
[1:13:20] completamente solo how many of you like
[1:13:22] to be all by yourself
[1:13:27] I think you're here in church because
[1:13:29] you you don't like to be by yourself too
[1:13:31] much
[1:13:33] once in a while it's okay to be by
[1:13:36] yourself right
[1:13:37] yeah yeah
[1:13:47] we were not created to
[1:13:51] Veronica
[1:13:53] solos because
[1:13:56] God in the beginning
[1:13:58] he was by himself well
[1:14:04] he he wanted something more than what
[1:14:06] was there but okay
[1:14:09] and he began to think about
[1:14:12] foreign
[1:14:22] says he was all by himself
[1:14:32] he was the
[1:14:36] what's this
[1:14:39] he was the all-sufficiente
[1:14:48] one that existed of himself
[1:14:53] but in Genesis 2 he says he said
[1:14:56] Hennessy's dos when he made man
[1:14:59] he said I am Yahweh Jehovah
[1:15:05] I like that because that's including me
[1:15:09] and you now
[1:15:14] what did mean yes significo what does
[1:15:19] Jehovah mean this this is simple Yes
[1:15:22] simply well it means significa says
[1:15:27] I'm the all-existent one
[1:15:31] who has created something off of myself
[1:15:38] to be a son of mine but I said
[1:15:41] or a temporary or temporal or an amateur
[1:15:47] little one of
[1:15:50] Mineo Jehovah means
[1:15:53] that he gave man
[1:15:57] to be an amateur God
[1:16:00] because he is Father God yes
[1:16:04] and he made a man
[1:16:07] an amateur God
[1:16:10] so he isn't self-existence anymore
[1:16:17] the moment that he created man
[1:16:22] he would never again be self-existent
[1:16:33] once again the moment he created man
[1:16:38] he was never lonely or by himself now
[1:16:45] he has a family
[1:16:47] family how many here have a family
[1:16:50] Familia amen now notice this this is
[1:16:54] what we want to we want to establish
[1:16:56] here
[1:16:57] in Genesis chapter one and and you can
[1:17:00] look in your Bibles and we're going to
[1:17:01] go really fast here
[1:17:04] and we spoke a little bit about this in
[1:17:07] in Colombia
[1:17:10] foreign
[1:17:13] but notice how the scriptures read
[1:17:17] Ura
[1:17:19] verse one
[1:17:22] oh that's it
[1:17:28] God yours Elohim ah okay

[1:19:55] this

[1:20:00] something changed that it was no longer
[1:20:05] just God
[1:20:10] but now it is Lord God is
[1:20:17] it has changed now in the days go ahead
[1:20:21] and finish reading it
[1:20:26] who created
[1:20:51] so now now hello him Elohim that existed
[1:20:56] of himself
[1:20:57] but now he
[1:21:01] and now
[1:21:04] now is
[1:21:11] the Familia
[1:21:19] because you and you and you and you and
[1:21:22] you are
[1:21:25] familiar come on shake hands
[1:21:31] you are part of the family of God it is
[1:21:40] you know
[1:21:43] your name neighbor does you know you it
[1:21:48] is are part of the family of God Amen
[1:21:55] simply okay very simple
[1:21:58] now from here on to the rest of the
[1:22:00] chapter
[1:22:03] you don't see just God anymore
[1:22:08] everything is Lord God
[1:22:12] let's read a few of them
[1:22:17] or on verse seven I'm sorry
[1:22:24] who formed
[1:22:26] on that
[1:22:28] Lord God
[1:22:30] eight
[1:22:32] yeah
[1:22:40] he is not alone amen verse 15.
[1:22:46] is
[1:22:55] verse 21 you know
[1:22:59] three
[1:23:19] here
[1:23:21] Peyton has entered the
[1:23:23] serpenters
[1:23:26] and now the serpenter is coming to part
[1:23:30] of
[1:23:31] what God has created
[1:23:35] he could not get to the man
[1:23:38] so he goes through the woman
[1:23:42] now he's gonna say something that I want
[1:23:45] you to catch
[1:23:48] because he he twists it
[1:23:51] and that's what he always does with the
[1:23:54] words
[1:23:55] he always takes something out of it
[1:23:59] now understand this
[1:24:02] because
[1:24:04] satanas does not have a problem saying
[1:24:07] he's Elohim not in a problem
[1:24:09] he will say he's God
[1:24:13] he's all powerful but Satan is after
[1:24:17] something
[1:24:19] he's after worship
[1:24:22] and he's after he wants to destroy the
[1:24:26] family
[1:24:33] the church should be a family
[1:24:36] what is he trying to do
[1:24:39] he's trying to destroy the churches
[1:24:42] he's trying to destroy the homes
[1:24:45] trying to destroy the individuals
[1:24:48] so the first thing he does
[1:24:51] comes to the woman
[1:24:53] and he will not say
[1:24:58] yoga I'm gonna say it again
[1:25:02] will not say Jehovah
[1:25:06] he'll say God
[1:25:09] but not Jehovah
[1:25:13] because he does not want God to be one
[1:25:16] with his family
[1:25:19] so the first thing he says now go ahead
[1:25:21] and read it
[1:25:30] mice
[1:25:36] better here
[1:25:40] what did the serpent say
[1:25:44] oh no no they said also the Lord God has
[1:25:48] said when he says
[1:25:54] he doesn't want to pronounce
[1:25:57] so he says listen oh God hath said oh
[1:26:08] that was the platform
[1:26:12] let's see where we go now Peyton's goal
[1:26:15] as I said
[1:26:17] to destroy the family
[1:26:20] do not permit the unity to come
[1:26:27] now now many of us uh muchos that are
[1:26:30] message Believers all that are here
[1:26:33] if you go to the book of Ephesians
[1:26:37] you're gonna find out that that that
[1:26:40] that he placed in the church
[1:26:44] and Prophets
[1:26:47] evangelists
[1:26:49] for the perfecting of the Saints
[1:26:53] the work of the ministry
[1:26:57] of the body of Christ
[1:26:59] but it goes on to say until
[1:27:03] release
[1:27:09] that's what we need to come to uh
[1:27:12] the problem is is that we know that
[1:27:16] scripture very well
[1:27:18] but we do not read
[1:27:21] three
[1:27:24] of the same chapter and you put it up
[1:27:27] there Ephesians 4 3 if uh
[1:27:32] press
[1:27:34] what does it say brother Julian
[1:27:36] Ephesians 4 3.
[1:27:39] solicitors
[1:27:45] the unity of the spirit
[1:27:49] you cannot have the unity of the faith
[1:27:54] until first of all you have Ephesians 4
[1:27:58] 3. thank God
[1:28:00] you've got to have the unity of the
[1:28:03] spirit
[1:28:05] the Bible says You must Endeavor
[1:28:11] Endeavors what would the word endeavor
[1:28:13] mean
[1:28:14] [Music]
[1:28:21] you gotta have the
[1:28:23] half the spirit first
[1:28:25] you can have the right doctrines
[1:28:28] don't have the right Spirit
[1:28:31] to correct and you have nothing
[1:28:34] sooner or later
[1:28:36] the wrong spirit
[1:28:39] will damage or destroy you
[1:28:42] but the right Spirits
[1:28:45] bring you into the unity of the right
[1:28:48] Faith
[1:28:50] now now this is where we're going this
[1:28:53] morning
[1:28:55] that's why we should fight so hard for
[1:28:58] our families
[1:29:02] how many here are fighting for your
[1:29:04] family
[1:29:06] you got loved ones that are out there
[1:29:08] still is
[1:29:11] turn around and look keep your hands up
[1:29:13] look at your neighbor
[1:29:15] look at all the hands that are UPS how
[1:29:19] many are fighting for their families
[1:29:44] we've gotta fight for
[1:29:46] eign
[1:29:51] [Music]
[1:30:11] [Music]
[1:30:25] churches that are splitting and
[1:30:27] contramos Iglesias que estan dividendo
[1:30:30] we find marriages that are crumbling in
[1:30:33] contramos casamientos
[1:30:36] but I always tell the people
[1:30:39] there's no such a thing as a broken
[1:30:41] marriage
[1:30:46] any broken marriages in here today
[1:30:52] there's no such a thing as a broken
[1:30:53] marriage
[1:30:57] what is broken
[1:30:59] are the people in the marriage is
[1:31:03] if you fix the people
[1:31:07] you can fix the marriage
[1:31:11] amen a man
[1:31:14] hello hola
[1:31:16] let's see this
[1:31:18] he knew that if he could make man fall
[1:31:22] is
[1:31:24] there would then be a Chasm between the
[1:31:29] Son and the father
[1:31:31] ISM
[1:31:35] how how they used to walk
[1:31:39] we know this this is basically we want
[1:31:42] you to get the picture
[1:31:44] God would come down in the cool of the
[1:31:47] evening
[1:31:49] and he would say how are you doing
[1:31:52] right yes
[1:31:55] how was your day
[1:32:02] do you like the garden I made you okay
[1:32:05] ah
[1:32:09] you know I made the garden for you so he
[1:32:11] says
[1:32:14] I didn't make you for the garden
[1:32:19] I made the garden for you
[1:32:21] because I knew everything that you would
[1:32:24] love you like
[1:32:27] but Satan knew that if he could get
[1:32:31] between
[1:32:32] then cause a
[1:32:35] chasmismo and cause a Chasm between God
[1:32:38] and his son
[1:32:42] he would feel like he won
[1:32:45] and now the chasm was so great
[1:32:48] I could just see God looking over there
[1:32:51] you mean
[1:32:53] his heart was sad
[1:32:56] I miss walking with my son
[1:33:00] do you not knows church God
[1:33:06] you every day
[1:33:09] know that he wants to get in that secret
[1:33:12] place with you
[1:33:17] but he sees that we are we are on the
[1:33:20] other side of a
[1:33:21] chasmos
[1:33:23] man didn't know how to get back to God
[1:33:28] because he had become
[1:33:39] Lord
[1:33:43] I need a job Lord I need a car Lord I
[1:33:48] need this
[1:33:51] Lord I need that
[1:33:52] we know him as God
[1:33:58] we know him like that
[1:34:01] we know him in the intimacy
[1:34:04] do we know him in a relationship
[1:34:08] do we know him because we've talked to
[1:34:11] him
[1:34:13] or we just like his power to do things
[1:34:16] for us
[1:34:19] think about it
[1:34:22] because we use him like a light switch
[1:34:24] huh
[1:34:27] notice
[1:34:31] after the fall
[1:34:35] you can sit down not knowing the
[1:34:38] beginning from the end
[1:34:41] he begins to roll out his plan
[1:34:46] get this church this is important
[1:34:50] important his plan that will
[1:34:53] bring Unity to him and his family
[1:35:02] for the rest of chapter three
[1:35:07] he's still known as Lord God
[1:35:13] but at the end of chapter three
[1:35:16] he's kicked out of the garden
[1:35:19] the the man and his wife right they're
[1:35:23] they're kicked out of the garden
[1:35:25] at the moment they get out of the garden
[1:35:29] is the moment that the scriptures tells
[1:35:32] us
[1:35:34] it never shows us
[1:35:38] Lord God again
[1:35:42] they're outside of the garden
[1:35:45] there's an angel there watching yeah
[1:35:51] he's not gonna let no one in nobody and
[1:35:55] now you begin to read the scriptures
[1:35:58] and it'll either say Lord
[1:36:03] but it doesn't say Lord God
[1:36:11] he's looking for something
[1:36:13] when all of a sudden Genesis 9 26 is
[1:36:23] watch how the thing changes
[1:36:30] the same ah
[1:36:33] this is the first time since the fall
[1:36:37] that the scripture says
[1:36:40] blessed be the Lord God
[1:36:48] oh
[1:36:50] Peyton better watch it
[1:36:52] on us
[1:36:54] is getting back his family esta
[1:36:58] Familia de Nuevo there's no more Greater
[1:37:01] Joy that's why the Bible says there's no
[1:37:05] Greater Joy ladies
[1:37:08] and when one sinner repents
[1:37:12] one son comes back
[1:37:15] and now come on
[1:37:18] he's not over there anymore
[1:37:21] one son comes back
[1:37:24] and he comes back and he meets up with
[1:37:41] oh one of my sons has come home
[1:37:45] you know
[1:37:52] come back and say I want to give my life
[1:37:54] to the Lord
[1:37:56] joy in our hearts
[1:37:59] joy in the church
[1:38:06] now come home
[1:38:08] now imagine how excited God is
[1:38:13] give him our whole life now
[1:38:17] watch he's not looking really at at the
[1:38:20] carnal
[1:38:22] parte carnal he's now watching his seed
[1:38:25] estabiendo susimiente
[1:38:28] and when he sees through Shams the same
[1:38:31] he knows okay now I'm gonna start my
[1:38:36] family here on Earth
[1:38:41] now this is Sunday school it's the same
[1:38:43] Escuela Dominican from Shem that's the
[1:38:46] Sam who came from shembino the same
[1:38:56] gem was one of the one of the sons right
[1:39:00] and he began and he began and he began
[1:39:02] finally
[1:39:06] someone came from Shem but
[1:39:09] that was the reason that God said
[1:39:12] watch what he says
[1:39:20] he knows the beginning from the end
[1:39:23] so now he's looking through time
[1:39:26] and he knows who's going to come through
[1:39:29] Shem else
[1:39:32] anyone again
[1:39:38] let's come a little bit closer
[1:39:42] there you go
[1:39:44] Abram Abram
[1:39:46] and when he sees the line yes the
[1:39:50] genealogy the lineage
[1:39:58] I'm gonna say it again
[1:40:02] and that is Abram yes Abram
[1:40:05] neces
[1:40:39] yeah
[1:40:40] I don't know maybe it don't excite you
[1:40:43] but it excites because the family is
[1:40:47] gonna start being restored families
[1:40:50] now watch the unity here so here Abraham
[1:40:54] says
[1:40:55] Lord God
[1:40:57] what will you give me sin I go childless
[1:41:03] finally from human lips
[1:41:09] comes the words Lord God again
[1:41:14] oh I don't know about you but but from
[1:41:17] Abram's lips
[1:41:19] he said Lord God he didn't just say God
[1:41:27] this is the first time
[1:41:29] and it's powerful yes that he not only
[1:41:33] recognized him
[1:41:34] yes
[1:41:36] but now he's recognizing him
[1:41:57] is one of the descendants of Abrams
[1:42:03] Isaac isak
[1:42:07] now here's where we find Lord God again
[1:42:13] Genesis 28 13.
[1:42:16] and this is Jacob he has the dream
[1:42:20] yes see he has this dream and he sees
[1:42:23] this ladder in elsewhere
[1:42:26] and the Lord stood above it the Bible
[1:42:29] says
[1:42:33] I am the Lord God
[1:42:38] of Abraham Abraham
[1:42:42] now Abraham had already said Lord God
[1:42:47] and now he has accepted him
[1:42:51] and now he says I am not the not just
[1:42:56] the gods
[1:42:59] he said I am the Lord God of Abrams
[1:43:05] but notice how the scripture reads Here
[1:43:08] I Am the Lord God of Abraham thy father
[1:43:14] wasn't Abraham Jacob's grandfather
[1:43:17] nowhere
[1:43:21] yes but in the family of God
[1:43:24] God is not a grandfather
[1:43:28] foreign
[1:44:06] [Music]
[1:44:30] and we always try to understand
[1:44:33] Oriental
[1:44:39] and you can't no puede
[1:44:41] thank God for a propheta
[1:44:45] notice this not this we're always trying
[1:44:48] to understand this is
[1:44:50] but the Hebrews
[1:44:52] they do not see things the way that you
[1:44:55] and I see them
[1:44:58] our Western culture Cultura Occidental
[1:45:02] focuses us
[1:45:05] on us as individuals
[1:45:10] you see your phone somebody
[1:45:17] this is Western culture is
[1:45:23] here I am in church
[1:45:35] let me show you what I have
[1:45:38] look at my new car Nuevo
[1:45:42] I've done all this yo is
[1:45:45] I I am an astronaut too yeah
[1:45:51] I'm just just a humble man but I have a
[1:45:54] lot of money in the bank too much I
[1:45:57] don't think I have a lot of money
[1:46:02] we are a western people
[1:46:05] trying to understand an Eastern book
[1:46:09] that doesn't work that way
[1:46:13] we think of ourselves as individuals
[1:46:17] this is who and what I am is
[1:46:21] so yo
[1:46:24] brother Branham says when that bride
[1:46:28] recognizes
[1:46:30] what she is
[1:46:34] not just who but what she is
[1:46:42] question is what are you
[1:46:46] we heard last night it's not who is the
[1:46:49] Holy ghosts and
[1:46:55] more
[1:46:59] ask your neighbor that come on
[1:47:02] it's okay to talk in church
[1:47:05] ask your neighbor what are you
[1:47:08] yes
[1:47:13] we focus on the individuals
[1:47:16] on a person's achievements
[1:47:21] more than we do the family
[1:47:24] but in the Eastern culture
[1:47:28] listen to this a person's identity
[1:47:34] comes almost entirely
[1:47:38] completamente from his family lineage
[1:47:44] come on you got to think about this
[1:47:47] hello everybody hola are you awake come
[1:47:51] on now you got to go with me on this
[1:47:53] right teaching positions you uh
[1:47:58] there's different services for different
[1:48:00] things but we want to help make sure
[1:48:04] that your position properly
[1:48:07] you gotta know what you believe
[1:48:11] in whom you have believed
[1:48:14] notices now once again
[1:48:17] their identity
[1:48:20] is almost entirely from the from their
[1:48:24] family or from their lineage
[1:48:28] he is the lion
[1:48:31] of the tribe of Judah
[1:48:37] foreign
[1:49:38] lineage of preachers
[1:49:42] [Music]
[1:49:50] a pastor we can't do anything else
[1:50:02] but my father was a preacherous
[1:50:09] we can't do anything else but be a
[1:50:12] preacher
[1:50:14] that's who we are somos
[1:50:18] that's why when you see one of us up
[1:50:20] here
[1:50:21] it's not just one man
[1:50:25] you get a lineage
[1:50:29] you get a tribe
[1:50:33] come on now vamos if one preaches
[1:50:36] everybody's preaching
[1:50:39] if one prays for the sick
[1:50:41] everybody
[1:50:54] it has been restored back yes
[1:51:01] he's not just God to us no solos
[1:51:23] in the Philippines
[1:51:27] there was a translation that they made
[1:51:33] and in that translation of that of the
[1:51:35] Bible
[1:51:37] they left out the Matthew chapter one
[1:51:43] the genealogy of Jesus
[1:51:46] imagine that so
[1:51:49] and when a new translation was published
[1:51:52] some years later
[1:51:57] it included the genealogy of Jesus
[1:52:02] and the native said
[1:52:05] so do you mean yet as a seed that this
[1:52:09] Jesus was an actual person Jesus
[1:52:16] because without the
[1:52:19] genealogya some of them had believed
[1:52:23] that the scriptures were fables
[1:52:27] and it was talking about a fictional
[1:52:30] character or hero yeah
[1:52:34] but I'm here to tell you
[1:52:37] that Jesus is not a fictional character
[1:52:40] Jesus
[1:52:42] he has a genealogy
[1:52:48] come on sure I'm going to say it again
[1:52:49] he has a genealogy
[1:52:52] the Bible says in the beginning was the
[1:52:55] word
[1:52:57] says this is the genealogy of the logos
[1:53:05] the word was with God
[1:53:11] the word became flat yes
[1:53:14] he brought his genealogy
[1:53:21] they were taken from Heaven
[1:53:24] transfer to Earth
[1:53:26] God had become a man
[1:53:29] I wanna I wanna get this now this is
[1:53:33] important I think Mike got a little bit
[1:53:34] of time
[1:53:37] this
[1:53:38] is the Epic story it is
[1:53:42] tremenda of the family of God the La
[1:53:45] Familia come on where's your Bible this

[1:57:40] reason he was special
[1:57:42] because of the spirit that he has
[1:57:47] each one had a job to do
[1:57:50] but God loved this Spirit of this man so
[1:57:54] much
[1:57:57] I don't know how many of you could could
[1:57:59] you say Lord do you love the spirit that
[1:58:01] I have

[1:58:06] times
[1:58:09] you know who I'm talking about now right
[1:58:13] come on now now we're getting into the
[1:58:15] base part of our message
[1:58:18] who was this man yeah
[1:58:23] Elijah Elias and First Kings 18 21 says
[1:58:29] you know
[1:58:32] this is the first time now
[1:58:36] that a man
[1:58:38] will challenge
[1:58:40] the world Al Mundo concerning Lord God
[1:58:50] my brother Hermano
[1:58:54] you know he's my brother Elias
[1:58:57] Elijah for the first time for primerves
[1:59:01] somebody has risen
[1:59:04] and says I challenge
[1:59:08] I challenge the political system your
[1:59:11] ritual Systema political of Ahab and
[1:59:14] Jezebel yeah
[1:59:16] I challenge
[1:59:18] the religious world
[1:59:20] of the prophets
[1:59:24] I challenge the people of Israel
[1:59:29] that the Lord
[1:59:37] foreign
[2:00:06] well kind of I know
[2:00:09] that's a mental Spirit of Enlightenment
[2:00:12] that is a coward Spirit as soon as
[2:00:17] all those message Believers they're
[2:00:19] Cults
[2:00:22] are you a message believer
[2:00:26] um well I'm kind but no no no not really
[2:00:29] no no no no no
[2:00:31] no no that's not the spirit of Elijah
[2:00:34] the spirit of Elijah says I want to
[2:00:37] challenge the whole world
[2:00:45] and he's won with his family
[2:00:52] the whole world
[2:00:57] and say Jehovah is
[2:01:00] one with his family
[2:01:08] watch what he says
[2:01:17] oh this is the problem
[2:01:20] do you believe
[2:01:24] is it your opinion opinion
[2:01:28] is it your opinion that the message is
[2:01:31] true
[2:01:33] I believe it is it an opinion or is it a
[2:01:37] fact is
[2:01:39] it an opinion or is it reality
[2:01:47] messages
[2:01:51] I think we have the truth
[2:01:54] what do you mean we think
[2:01:58] the spirit of Elijah doesn't think that
[2:02:00] they have the truth and the spiritually
[2:02:02] is
[2:02:05] and it don't matter who come who come
[2:02:07] against them
[2:02:09] watch what he says
[2:02:11] then if the Lord be God
[2:02:15] is follow him
[2:02:20] some people have one foot in the church
[2:02:22] and one in the world
[2:02:24] but if the Lord be God
[2:02:28] follow him
[2:02:33] and
[2:02:34] come on now if the Lord be God follow
[2:02:38] him
[2:02:40] and when he becomes Lord God to you yeah
[2:02:50] he is
[2:02:52] and when you say he is Lord God
[2:02:57] and then he turns around and says yes
[2:03:00] yes he says see I am their lord
[2:03:05] and when he says
[2:03:09] okay
[2:03:10] I know we got something going on we got
[2:03:13] something going okay how many are with
[2:03:15] me this morning got something going now
[2:03:18] now you have said all right
[2:03:24] he begins to say
[2:03:26] I am your soy that I am
[2:03:31] your soy that I am I am
[2:03:39] yourself
[2:03:43] foreign
[2:04:18] it was the spirit the spirit of Elijah
[2:04:21] the Elias
[2:04:25] I want you to see something here now
[2:04:27] like 10 15 minutes yes
[2:04:33] because I want to get this that list
[2:04:35] last thought out you know
[2:04:36] Turkey who was this Elijah
[2:04:40] the Bible just says he was a Tish bite
[2:04:46] nothing much more is
[2:04:49] told about him
[2:04:51] they don't know his genealogy
[2:04:55] yeah we do but
[2:05:01] he was a word Prophet
[2:05:05] let's let's go because I want you to get
[2:05:07] this
[2:05:09] he was a man the Bible says
[2:05:12] I was subject to like passion is
[2:05:19] we're taught in the scriptures
[2:05:22] does not
[2:05:24] an immortal being
[2:05:26] said Immortal it was a man subject to
[2:05:29] like passions the Bible says
[2:05:31] he never died he went up in a whirlwind
[2:05:36] and that Spirit of Elijah it's a
[2:05:40] spiritual Alias was actually the spirit
[2:05:42] of God well Espirito de dios on the man
[2:05:46] Elijah
[2:05:47] which is what made that yes the immortal
[2:05:51] Elijah is Elias immortal
[2:05:56] not so much the man but the spirit that
[2:06:00] was on the man
[2:06:02] the immortal
[2:06:05] Elijah's Immortal Elijah me now this
[2:06:08] this brings the message all together
[2:06:12] Elijah Elias means significa
[2:06:18] of all the prophets that those Los
[2:06:20] prophetas he chooses Elijah
[2:06:23] come on somebody tell me what Elijah
[2:06:26] means
[2:06:35] good question huh
[2:06:36] gunta
[2:06:38] anybody again
[2:06:41] we'll wait peramos
[2:06:53] why did God even choose this man is
[2:07:00] foreign
[2:07:26] I gotta let that one soak in a little
[2:07:28] bit
[2:07:30] Elijah means is Elias significa my God
[2:07:34] is Jehovah medios now you know why it
[2:07:39] matters what you name your children
[2:07:45] imagine them put in the name is
[2:07:54] my God is Jehovah says that sounds like
[2:07:58] a good name
[2:08:02] my God is Jehovah a declaration just by
[2:08:07] his name declarations
[2:08:09] here's where it starts getting good
[2:08:13] his characteristics were so amazing
[2:08:18] that they even fought Jesus
[2:08:22] was Elias Elias
[2:08:27] yes or yes doc watch how close it is
[2:08:32] who is this Genesis
[2:08:44] but some say you're Elias
[2:08:47] I thought he was Elias
[2:08:53] watch this unfold here just for a moment
[2:08:58] the spirit Elijah was upon John the
[2:09:00] Baptist
[2:09:02] it was the spirit of God with that word
[2:09:09] and he had to
[2:09:11] identify the Christ
[2:09:18] but he had to identify the Christ
[2:09:26] so here comes John the Baptist
[2:09:29] he is Anointed with the spirit of Elijah
[2:09:33] now now just listen to this for a moment
[2:09:36] John chapter one one I'm not going to
[2:09:39] read it but you can read it when you get
[2:09:40] home
[2:09:41] Jesus come to and the Levites come to
[2:09:44] Jerusalem
[2:09:46] and they asked John how old is this now
[2:09:49] they asked John he has the spirit of
[2:09:52] Elijah on him
[2:09:54] he says
[2:09:58] that's the question to each one of you
[2:10:03] and he confessed
[2:10:09] I am not the Christo
[2:10:15] I'm not the Messiah and they asked him
[2:10:19] what yeah
[2:10:21] then
[2:10:22] aura what okay we thought for sure you
[2:10:26] were the cries
[2:10:31] he says he said are thou Elias it is
[2:10:35] Elias and he said
[2:10:37] I am not soy
[2:10:41] this is the scriptures
[2:10:43] I am not no soy are you that Prophet it
[2:10:47] is
[2:10:52] and he says well you're not the Christ
[2:10:55] you're not Elias you're not the prophet
[2:10:58] give us an answer because we need to
[2:11:02] take it an answer back to those that
[2:11:04] sent us
[2:11:06] he identifies himself
[2:11:09] by what one of his brothers said about
[2:11:12] him
[2:11:16] I'm gonna say that again he identifies
[2:11:19] himself
[2:11:21] by what one of his brothers said about
[2:11:23] him
[2:11:26] that was his brother Isaiah
[2:11:29] the voice of him that crieth in the
[2:11:31] wilderness
[2:11:33] yeah my brother spoke about me
[2:11:36] oh prepare ye the way of the Lord
[2:11:40] make straight in the Dead
[2:11:42] uh
[2:11:44] a highway for our God
[2:11:47] remember everything must be established
[2:11:50] by two or three Witnesses
[2:11:54] so now they come to Jesus
[2:12:00] about John the Baptista Matthew 11 if
[2:12:03] you want to read it when you get home
[2:12:06] Jesus began to say what went you out to
[2:12:08] sea Jesus
[2:12:13] propheta
[2:12:21] he is bringing out the two witnesses
[2:12:27] and Isaiah had spoken
[2:12:30] now Jesus says for this is he says
[2:12:39] I send my messenger before thy face
[2:12:45] we have one Witnesses Isaiah
[2:12:52] I like something brother Jimmy said
[2:12:55] yesterday
[2:12:56] I can't find that in the message
[2:12:59] we are the message
[2:13:04] and we are the manifestation of the
[2:13:06] message
[2:13:08] that is
[2:13:23] watch this now so then they asked him
[2:13:27] they said okay
[2:13:28] I am the Final witness
[2:13:31] that word made flesh
[2:13:34] if you will receive it
[2:13:37] this is Elias which was for to come
[2:13:44] almost sounds like the Forerunner yes he
[2:13:47] says
[2:13:48] and the cries are on two different pages
[2:13:52] John says I am not Elias
[2:13:55] Jesus said if you can receive it is
[2:13:59] this is Elias
[2:14:02] so is there a contradiction
[2:14:06] foreign
[2:14:37] okay yo if you can receive it is
[2:14:54] John the Baptist was saying are you
[2:14:58] Elias it is yes I am not the Tish bite
[2:15:01] no soil that's my brother is
[2:15:05] oh
[2:15:09] you are who you are it is you can't be
[2:15:12] another person
[2:15:14] you were made original
[2:15:17] you were made unique
[2:15:20] no one else made life
[2:15:23] you're part of
[2:15:43] uh this
[2:15:45] is Elias
[2:15:48] is
[2:15:54] so many people today says are you say
[2:15:56] anything brother branham's Elijah uh
[2:16:01] no no not the Tish bite
[2:16:05] he's not that man
[2:16:10] well some say brother Branham that you
[2:16:11] are Jesus Christ
[2:16:14] no you're making me an
[2:16:17] antichristo brother Branham was one man
[2:16:21] Jesus Christ was another man
[2:16:25] if you try to make me the person of
[2:16:27] Jesus Christ
[2:16:33] that the spirit of Christ is
[2:16:36] upon me and it's doing a work through me
[2:16:40] yes
[2:16:44] you can receive
[2:16:48] the prophet
[2:16:51] in this day
[2:16:56] you can receive it
[2:16:58] is
[2:17:06] to restore the family foreign
[2:17:55] [Music]
[2:18:08] that alohim felt in the beginning
[2:18:14] Jesus then felt alone
[2:18:20] my father had left the Sun
[2:18:24] and now you see them
[2:18:29] and their
[2:18:31] they're not together
[2:18:33] it's separated again
[2:18:37] I got the family again
[2:18:41] let me tell you something church
[2:18:48] he calls for Elias
[2:18:51] he's calling for the
[2:19:04] to save him
[2:19:09] and everybody's waiting are you the
[2:19:12] Elias
[2:19:15] they don't realize
[2:19:17] they've had a lot of Elijah's mantels
[2:19:23] but in all reality
[2:19:25] the mantle of Elijah
[2:19:28] is the responsibility
[2:19:35] is the responsibility
[2:19:41] and he put it on
[2:19:47] [Music]
[2:20:37] what's the purpose of the message of
[2:20:40] restoration
[2:20:43] no
[2:21:00] I am one but also you know yes
[2:21:17] [Music]
[2:21:18] it is the voice of Elijah is
[2:21:21] [Applause]
[2:21:22] to keep it alive
[2:21:28] come on church I'm gonna say it again
[2:21:33] no other Prophet could do it
[2:21:36] because Elijah's name means
[2:21:40] my God is
[2:21:45] and that's why he had to use the spirit
[2:21:48] fight manana
[2:22:07] that he's still trying to break up the
[2:22:09] family Familia
[2:22:14] I know some of you are struggling
