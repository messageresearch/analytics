[20:20] privilege to be here you all ready
[20:32] so i don't know how many
[20:35] bats were lost tonight
[20:44] but i am crying inside
[20:48] you know i brother caleb had um
[20:52] told me a while back he said it's
[20:55] payback time
[20:58] and i thought i was still gonna get away
[21:00] with it but you know i
[21:02] i am we're reflecting on our lives
[21:06] and it was a privilege
[21:10] to baptize every one of my kids my
[21:13] children
[21:14] it's a privilege today to marry my
[21:17] daughter
[21:19] i'm not losing
[21:22] a daughter but i'm gaining quite a
[21:26] quite a man as a son
[21:34] if you cry you're going to make me cry
[21:36] so
[21:38] and we you know we we love joe rodriguez
[21:41] to death so he's
[21:43] you know proud to
[21:46] to be here standing with with this
[21:48] beautiful couple
[21:50] this this night amen you may be seated
[21:53] we're gonna
[21:57] enter we're going to enter into god's
[22:02] sacred word um
[22:07] i'm going to read a passage from saint
[22:09] mark 10
[22:10] 7 through 10. and it reads like this for
[22:13] this cause shall a man leave his father
[22:16] and mother and cleave to his wife
[22:19] and they twain shall be one flesh
[22:23] so then they are no more twain but one
[22:26] flesh
[22:28] what therefore god has joined together
[22:32] let no man put asunder
[22:36] amen and you know we
[22:41] it's a special day when you have the
[22:43] opportunity to
[22:44] marry your your daughter and i tried to
[22:49] see what would be the most appropriate
[22:52] guidance that we could give them tonight
[22:55] um and as i was reading
[22:59] and i was reading this the scripture
[23:02] says
[23:02] what god has joined together this ain't
[23:05] what man has joined together
[23:08] but it's what god has joined together
[23:10] you
[23:11] see many advertisements on tv on on
[23:15] what they say come join this
[23:18] app or join this to find your perfect
[23:21] couple
[23:23] or to find your perfect mate but as i
[23:26] was reflecting on my own life
[23:29] you know i was
[23:32] thinking what
[23:35] would be the best scenario that i could
[23:38] think of the love of god and
[23:40] you know when when you
[23:44] find the one that god
[23:47] has placed in your path
[23:50] you go through many trials and it's
[23:55] i was thinking if if we both were
[23:58] perfect
[23:59] i don't think we would have loved each
[24:01] other as much as we
[24:04] we do now you know you have these trials
[24:07] and
[24:08] if if we're perfect
[24:12] you know because many times as humans
[24:16] we expect god to show us his love
[24:19] we expect god to show us his mercy but
[24:22] we fail
[24:23] to show our spouse
[24:26] the same love the same mercy the same
[24:29] forgiveness
[24:31] you know and where does that perfectness
[24:34] come from
[24:36] that perfectness comes from god you know
[24:39] in a marriage there's not just two but
[24:41] there's three
[24:43] you know if god is not present your
[24:46] marriage will fail
[24:48] you know because that's where we get the
[24:50] perfectness and that's
[24:51] where we find mercy that's where we find
[24:54] grace
[24:55] because we were all lost in sin shaped
[24:57] in iniquity
[24:59] but the scripture tells us here what god
[25:02] had joined together
[25:04] it says let no man it says let no man
[25:08] break this so what a perfect picture god
[25:12] has placed
[25:13] for us today it's a miracle that these
[25:16] two are sitting here in our midst
[25:18] in this world that we live in but this
[25:21] is what god has joined together
[25:24] you know many people in this world
[25:27] choose
[25:28] why get married we could live
[25:31] in sin we could live we could do this
[25:33] and we could still be successful we
[25:34] could still be rich
[25:36] we could still have children it the
[25:38] story goes on and on
[25:39] but because what is it it's sin and
[25:42] that's what we're fighting against here
[25:44] this morning or this evening
[25:45] is sin you know many many times we just
[25:48] let
[25:49] so casually sin enter into our lives
[25:52] and we forget the sanctity of marriage
[25:55] that god has placed in our midst
[25:57] that's why the scripture says what god
[25:59] has joined
[26:01] so beck and joe
[26:04] you have to find your center
[26:08] and your center is not a good job your
[26:11] center is not a nice house your center
[26:13] is not a good car
[26:14] but your center is god if you find that
[26:18] center in your life
[26:20] you will be successful i always remember
[26:24] the story that the prophet of god tells
[26:26] us
[26:27] he says i married two couples
[26:30] he said one was well off
[26:35] the other didn't have much
[26:38] but he said when i went to check on the
[26:41] couple
[26:42] that had many he says
[26:45] as i was approaching the door all i
[26:47] could hear was bickering
[26:49] fighting he says they were barely
[26:52] hanging on
[26:54] he said but when i went to the couple
[26:57] that didn't have much he says
[27:01] what an example of love that i saw
[27:05] because why
[27:06] they had their center which was god many
[27:09] times we
[27:11] we tried to say god is our center but
[27:15] when we look at our lives everything
[27:18] comes before god
[27:20] everything no matter what it is but if
[27:22] you guys can place
[27:23] god as your center and stick to it no
[27:26] matter
[27:27] things things are going to get hard
[27:29] that's why when we
[27:30] get into the vows
[27:34] through sickness through trials
[27:38] that's where you gain your character i
[27:41] always remember
[27:44] our founding pastor brother the mosque
[27:46] senior
[27:47] me and my wife were were newlyweds
[27:51] we were struggling and we went to him
[27:54] for counseling
[27:56] and at this time my aunt biola was
[27:58] really
[27:59] really sick and one of the things he
[28:03] told me that always stuck to my heart
[28:05] he said i never
[28:09] knew love until now
[28:14] he says i thought i loved your auntie
[28:17] he says but when she got sick
[28:21] he says i really found how much i loved
[28:23] her
[28:24] this is because i had to take care of
[28:27] her
[28:28] i had to nurture her and he said once
[28:32] god put this through he said i really
[28:35] found out how much
[28:36] i really loved her and i'm looking
[28:39] and he was such an example to us
[28:43] i'm looking and i'm saying you know many
[28:46] times
[28:47] we don't understand what love is
[28:50] we we want to see love through our eyes
[28:52] instead of seeing it through god's eyes
[28:54] that's why it's so important that god
[28:56] becomes our centerpiece
[28:58] and if you could start and keep it there
[29:04] you don't have to worry about anything
[29:06] else
[29:07] because it's not going to matter the
[29:09] only thing that matters your walk with
[29:11] god
[29:12] and are you ready for the mouse joe
[29:19] are you happy becca are you happy
[29:23] this is this this you guys have to look
[29:25] at this this is a victorious day
[29:28] you know for me as a father it's a
[29:31] victorious day
[29:33] you know we i have my daughter
[29:38] has found somebody that believes the
[29:41] same way she does
[29:42] that believes the message of the hour
[29:44] that's a good christian young man
[29:47] so you know if i shed tears they're
[29:50] going to be tears of joy
[29:51] they're not going to be tears of sadness
[29:54] you know let me just so you understand
[29:57] what i'm getting into
[30:02] i we had rented a lift to do the hall
[30:07] and as soon as we started it broke down
[30:12] and normally said okay let's just take
[30:15] it back
[30:17] so before i knew joe and gabe had this
[30:21] sucker
[30:22] broke down and they had it fixed
[30:25] and i'm all sheesh i don't need a
[30:27] mechanic anymore

[31:24] which is commanded by saint paul to be
[31:26] honorable among
[31:27] all men it is therefore not by any to

[31:41] that right
[31:44] into this holy state these two persons
[31:47] present come to be joined if there's
