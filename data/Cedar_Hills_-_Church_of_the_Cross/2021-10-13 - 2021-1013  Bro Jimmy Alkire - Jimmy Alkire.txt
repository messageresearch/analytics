jesus just to see what he'd say and the lord just rode in the sand they all walked away when they heard him saying that the sinful cast the first stone and with tears on her face her past was erased

[Music] foreign [Music] is [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah how many are happy to be in the house of the lord and we're going to be a little more like old times tonight so for some reason i can't get my tablet to work right now again well then we'll just speech without it that won't be a little problem you know by the grace of god how many love the lord jesus your jesus glory to his precious holy name as you're standing there starting but praise the lord jesus you're so kind to turn in your bibles yes the galatians chapter 4 verse 19 verse actually let's we're going to read verse 19 20 and 21. amen and our subject tonight will be the crowning of the asian and the lord help us get to where he wants us to get tonight and we're very thankful amen amen my little children verse 19 of whom i travail in birth again until christ be formed in you amen the next verse i desire to be present with you now and to change my voice for i stand in doubt of you is tell me that you desire to be under the law do you not hear the law no based for this grand and to do our best is to be in our position and to help your children we thank you lord in the precious name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen and amen you may be seated i would like to read the quote notice how paul is saying here pablo i'm in travail or i'm suffering for you again but look what happens here they had come out of the law avian salido they had received the revelation of jesus christ and they had been born again but now they were desiring to go back and be under the law notice they were going back to want to have the desire to be under the law they were going forward they were going back and they had a desire one of them is you can't drive down the road looking in the rearview mirror somebody tell me what happens if you drive down the road looking in the river but what's going to happen when you don't you're going to cry amen then another statement our messenger says he goes you cannot live in the light of a age that's gone but and this is exactly what was happening here after paul by the grace of god was able to get these people to come to the lord jesus jesus and be born again their birth was paralyzed people say well that was this one that was just for them how many of us come in and we receive the lord jesus gentrification was the third notice not the you see ben they were looking back to the past it just it's not miranda alpacado trying to do things the way that you were used to that but the birth that they had was not based on what they could do as humans was based on jesus christ revealing himself to them and that's why paul said oh my goodness i've already been through this one time but now i'm in travail to give birth for you to give birth again because you're never going to get to your position in the body if you're living in the light of the past age and what is this are you with me so far praise the lord jesus jesus and this is speaking about adoption it's the last message i preached we hit on why jesus had to be baptized why would he have to be baptized if he wasn't a sinner the sacrifice had to be washed say it louder that's that's part of it yeah the scripture and the scripture he had to fulfill was completed numbers chapter 29 we're not going to go there but aaron and his sons to enter into the office of the priests to go into the holy of holies the priest had to bear the high priest had to be washed with water before this is my beloved son this is why would he have to be adopted if he was the son of god honey would like to know the name now the adoption when we think of adoption we're thinking of say a couple maybe that has had problems having a little child or a family that would like another child and they go through the legal process because the adoption here doesn't necessarily refer to bringing another member into your family him coming to maturity verses one through five brother let's go ahead and go there del verso uh amen and let me get there i'm keep forgetting i don't have the screen but that's okay amen here we are chapter 17. we'll start with verse one and after six days jesus takes peter james and john his brother and brings them up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as his son and his raiment was as white as the light and behold there appeared to them moses and elijah not just appearing moses was saying i see now that you're the fulfillment of the lord part of that was fulfilled in the life of jesus we know the other parts fulfilled in the end time and moses is pointing to jesus as the fulfillment of the lord why you're the very one that raptured me from the earth to and elijah now pointing and then answered peter and said unto jesus lord is it good for us to be here bueno espana he says if you will let us make sure three tabernacles one for you one from moses and one for elijah is and here brother branham says in many messages god shut him up because it's the tendency of man to want to make a tabernacle for this one another tabernacle for this one and another tabernacle for this one but while they said that dennis says while they yet spoke verse 5 behold the bright cloud overshadowed them and behold the voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son in whom i am well-pleased notice it's the exact same phrase that he said in matthew 3. this is my beloved son this is me i am i'm really having a good time living in him and can tango complacency it gives them a ceremony of angels and now he doesn't just say this is my beloved son please but now i'm getting off the scene i don't want you to think that it's me anymore in the office of the father bringing the law i want you to listen to him you're not gonna have to listen to me anymore he had grown up into the adoption you begin to receive the baptism of the holy ghost because the baptism of the holy ghost it's not just one little gusher no solo is that's verbatim brother brown it's the same holy spirit to try to do it ourselves and we think by just being good people no i'm not saying you should be a bad people no no to try to justify yourself make ourselves feel better by doing little things then we begin to do the same thing [Applause] oh my goodness these people are paralyzed at the same time how many have a desire in your heart i would like to be something that denzel washington but if it's a desire that's been born in you by a new nature any desire when the sale is that it's god's proof is is in iglesia and you might think oh gosh man they don't like me here i made one mistake and now nobody wants nothing to do with me he says that desire is the sale that it is how many have you just something that gets it when you talk about the lord and you wake up in the morning that's god's proof to you this not just your birth but the spiritual bro birth of that little baby that's born inside of your heart what the scripture says the creature but then here comes but then when he saw they were if i would have depended on that when i first came in the message i would have been dead and gone a long time tommy says it's okay back then he don't say that no more he says he goes man i know the body is strange to the world yeah the body of christ is strange to the world cell out of my brain do you know your memory cells live longer you know how long a memory cell lives at least 20 years you say but brother jimmy you're over 60 i should have died a long time ago you're making you look through the river mirror now drive down the highways when it's about time for that cell to die he quickens that memory card that's the truth well if i don't get to getting into my notes we'll never get in you have i got well actually i have about 30 minutes left me in you know what happened then when that boy come to a certain age that boy was adopted into the family now what did that do they took him out in a public place but a special robe they put a special robe on him oh my i don't want to get on that because it'll be 10 minutes on that no quiet and the father had a ceremony of adoption was adopted his name on the checkbook was as good as his daddy and when you that's where god's trying to get his church just to say to this mountain be moved and it will move authority sons of god the whole creation is groaning waiting for the manifestations of the sons of god the prayers aren't you thankful that he answers prayers but watch what he says we pray for it now but then commanded i said they'll cast out devils not i will they will are you part of the day if i would like to go to a scripture in genesis 1. how many enjoyed that first video about adoption you see i've been already working in that so this is where i'm at is in adoption and in there brother brennan made this statement and when they are born and he did you know that adam had to be born it's right here in the scripture hey amen let's go now to genesis 1. uno and we're going to actually start with verse 21. amen and this is actually on the fifth day that starts but as we go i'm going to ask you a few questions and if you have a notebook and god created great coils and everything living creature that moves which is in the water and waters brought forth abundantly after their kind in every wing foul after its kind and god saw that it was good are there already whales and he says this are there already whales are there already birds are they already living upon the uh crawling along the earth anybody want to answer there's really not a wrong answer so don't be afraid you think so okay i'll say amen big woman because god in genesis 1 created the spirit of everything but they were not yet physically what's that they would take physical forms i need it and the evening let's go down to verse 23 because i can keep meeting there in the evening in the morning now that was about the heavens and in the ocean in the ocean now as he begins to speak about the sixth day he's speaking about what he's going to do on the earth okay and god said let the earth bring forth the living creature after its time after its and he was the most subtle of all already there but his spirit was no god created his spirit it's the seed chapter of the bible and god made the beast of the earth after his kind the cattle after his kind verse 25 everything that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and god saw that it was good [Music] if verse 26 and we've read this so many times and god said let us make man in our image imagine is that scripture still alive today not getting awful milky up here already that's okay let us make man in our image and after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air over the cattle over all the earth over every creeping state see there were already animals and god was recreating a spirit man and guess what that was feminine sure i can get into another subject but make sure that that companion comes out of your theater it only confirms oh my pastor even told me one time don't you say that no more mad at me you degrade yourself because you're not just anybody you're not a son of god you're a general of god don't speak about amen verse 27 so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he then male and female and god blessed him 28 and god said unto them be fruitful and watch fruitful comma that means time tiempo yes anytime you see a comma it's it's an opening of time oh it's going to take time for that fruit to come out right now the multiplication was going to come by the word the multiplication then it says comma oh when they would begin to multiply it would take time and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the efficiencies [Music] verb to fill the genar or build up again to make full the complete complete and knowing that he was going to fill the earth [Music] vladimir redemption remission regeneration regeneration all those words and here all right chapter 2 and i've got 10 minutes and i better finish let's start with verse 4. [Music] watch this in chapter one it already said there was plants and there was trees and there was everything right and people in in the world who read the bible they say oh yeah i was already there and praise the lord jesus and every herb of the field before it grew italian for the lord god i love that brother danny i don't know if you're here tonight he might be at work or whatever but man when he preached on the lord because he did not recognize for the lord god had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was no man to kill the soil and there was not a man to till the ground brother jimmy you just said god created a spirit man in genesis one he was walking around and the messenger says no telling but there went up a mist from the earth and water the whole face of the ground and the lord god formed man from the dust of the ground and man became a living soul i'm not going to turn to it because my time is gone but i'm not such blasphemous names if you want to mark it down famously the prophet says not like the jehovah's witnesses teach that he breathed into him the wind okay and any and he came alive he says he was already a living man he said what kind of life did he have before god breathed into his nostrils breath he goes what is that crown oh what what is that crown that god crowned his creation he turned away that was the crown that crowned adam and the lord god planted a garden eastward and he put the man that he had formed and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant and good for food a tree of life also nominates the god where [Music] but you're still adam that was born that had eternal life god placed him to the purpose of which god had may you reveal that to your children tonight [Music] [Music] amen god bless you brother jimmy don't you love him church oh we thank god for his presence tonight can you just raise your hands tonight mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord amen [Music] glory glory hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] is marching on glory glory hallelujah [Music] glory glory hallelujah [Music] oh glory glory hallelujah [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] his truth is [Music] oh hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Music] his truth is [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] glory hallelujah [Music] [Music] is [Music] very [Music] is [Applause] [Music] [Music] once again [Music] yes can you give one to the lord [Applause] the blood that jesus shed aren't you happy for the blood that he shed for us way back on calvary [Music] and just raise your hands church now thank you lord for your grace your mercy your blood [Music] me [Music] hello [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] it doesn't matter how [Music] it will never lose [Music] my fears [Music] is [Music] is [Music] foreign [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] he is [Music] oh is [Music] [Music] and i should oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] to me [Music] yes [Music] oh jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] for everywhere i go and everywhere i've been i know [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh i've heard [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] i wanna be like jesus [Music] oh [Music] don't you love her can you get one to the lord god's sure is [Music] oh [Music] jesus [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] joy [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] while i woke up this morning [Music] [Music] oh is [Music] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] once again [Music] can you glorify me [Music] is [Music] and i will [Music] [Music] is [Music] have my jesus [Music] amen give one to the lord tonight amen amen god bless his word once again god bless you brother jimmy for that beautiful word amen sure has been good to be in the house of the lord this evening amen there's many things we could be doing but there is no greater thing or no better thing than to serve the lord jesus christ make sure everybody comes amen support our brother ron peterson who will be ministering for us on sunday morning and sunday afternoon amen i forget a lot of things sometimes this is brother omar's birthday is we want to wish tomorrow happy birthday um we are so thankful to the lord for the wonderful husband and father that he has given us and then also on friday is brother sophia house hustle's birthday man we want to wish them both a very happy birthday and then it was also sister jade's birthday today we'll wish them a happy birthday amen amen amen [Music] [Laughter] [Laughter] foreign [Music] [Music] is [Music] foreign [Music]
