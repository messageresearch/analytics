yeah you know I've been a little under the weather for the last couple of weeks and I never realized how much singing takes out of you you know ask that you pray for me okay what important part of me as we introduce our Minister and we hear straight from the Throne of God when we see the man come to the platformer I just ask that you don't look at the man but look at the Christ that is living in the map it's an honor to introduce my friend brother Jerry Gonzalez I know Jerry Gonzalez and and we're going to change it up you were playing that song I am the god that healeth thee let's sing that

heal or you are the god [Music] you are the god that he'll lift me you are the Lord my [Music] life [Music] amen amen I bless you this morning a privilege and an honor to be here stand behind this sacred desk something that we never never take lightly it's something that's very serious to me and to all anybody that gets up behind because we get to handle God's precious word and the thing is we're responsible for every word that comes out of our mouth so God bless all the visitors those that are watching us through the internet God bless you stand in the internet anyone that hears us in the future the pastor God bless you Lord as always we want to thank him for the confidence confidence that he has in us speak behind behind his desk here whenever not to have you standing much longer let us turn to a very very well-known scripture probably the most well-known scripture in Malachi 4 5. and uh just want each and every one of you to know that that we we're here to help you if there's something said that that's misunderstood please forgive me that's not the intention but we have to put out what God gives us you know there's sometimes I tell the pastor I'd like to preach a message you know that's a little you know flowery message you know really pumped up and really happy uh for some reason I I don't get I don't get the thoughts that way in obedience we put out what God gives us Ephesians 4 10 Ephesus Capital cuatro versus DS either descended is the same also that the center of high far above heaven that he may fill all things I apologize but watch the Formula here verse 11 is the formula El person says the formula to combat para combatir what was going to be thrown out at the same time by Satan foreign okay till we all come into the unity of the faith oh we all come into the separation yeah the scripture says God says God in print form is saying deals still okay we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man perfect until the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth no more children in other words you're not confused he gave the formula formula but the formula so that is so that you are not in confusion in this day and carried about with every wind of Doctrine Jesus so we want to open this up a little bit so we saw the formula being with a formula that the formula was supposed to do is supposed to do and we see the product at the end so you see in today's society you look around today and there is so much information out right now right now it doesn't matter you have all information in your hand information right everybody's got a cell phone poor cell phone we're always talking about the cell phone so you have all the information that you could possibly need in your very hands you want to figure out how to build something you need information to do the certain things if you if someone tells you about a subject about a certain things we're all experts expertos because Google is the expert porque Google is Google has all the information that you could possibly need and want Google information even in the message we have the table application on the table we have so many articles we have the Bible the name was La Biblia we have everything that you could possibly need information overload the information so let me ask you a question why is it that people are more confused today than ever before que antes you know brother Henry mentioned some things in his message I thought you're going to go into it a little bit I'm like oh no that's okay so we're more confused than ever before for some reason how is that possible having the very thing in your hands you know this so this is this is the thing that that gets me and I found that has nothing to do with the information because information that you hear the information it's subjective it's subjective and what that means everybody listens to information and everybody gets something different out of it so what you have is a bunch of a different interpretations no matter what it is everyone will have a different thing or a different thoughts of what they heard for example for example you're hearing me this morning and I've mentioned this before right now you're formulating in your minds right now whether I know what I'm talking about full of beans and potatoes foreign yes he used the vessels to write it but we have to understand that this is God in print forms okay we're in agreement with that is part of the template and the temple is telling me that this faithful ministry that's been given is takes from the tapes takes from the prophet and together in unity it's it was givenado to combat the confusion of this day because confusion you can just think of confusion confusion is just running in chaos and not knowing what to do that's part of it it says introducing new and right The Serpent and Eve what did the serpent do we know that the serpent was just he was just an animal we know that Satan anointed this animal to come and bring Eve brand new information he confused her just enough wait a minute he quoted the template and then just a little bit of deviation look at and look at what he told her you'll be like did he tell her something negative or you're going to be destroyed you're going to be this one no no he deviated just enough to get up from under the head to bring this information to cause the fall amen amen confusion so today information the information watch these facts okay I shouldn't call them facts because that's what buzzword today but watch watch this in the 1900s they say a man by the name of David Schilling um he said human knowledge in the 1900s it would it would double every hundred years okay by the 1945s by 1945 pero foreign all the information has just grown exponentially throughout the years it's now doubling every 12 hours it's not even every 24 hours on top of that is they're just it's been around for a while but they just Let it Loose a little bit Congress got so scared that they had to dial it back artificial AI they're saying is so dangerous according to Elon Musk the Cordova Elon Musk I don't know how credible he is put it out there okay it's saying that AI is artificial intelligence is more dangerous than all the nuclear bombs put together so information is doubling every 12 hours say foreign say Google write me a 10-page report on I forget what the information was in seconds we had a 10-page report how long does it take a human to write a report how many have been to and Walmart has been putting this in for a little bit self checkouts how many have been to First slide lately and then Marco first slide so they're doing away with the with the human tellers hey us is now you can go at any time you want make a deposit or withdrawal anytime you want yeah you don't need to speak to a human anymore they're saying that the implications of this AI is going to take Millions upon millions of jobs so brother Henry by choice or no choice we may all be poor here pretty soon we may not have a choice there's a big shake-up in our industry I do a lot with the in the technology field is and we're seeing more and more automation what's called automation come in yes now our automation means you're just taking the human element out significance they're writing certain programs and applications so that's how it looks right now what does it look like what is it going to look like in five years women all of us may be out of a job uh this is how bad it is okay I promise you this is not all doom and gloom I promise you I promise you this is not all doom and gloom is Hollywood is like shaking up how many know the Hollywood the screenwriters are on strike in Hollywood how many know that the the actors are all upset because you don't need a human to write a script anymore artificial intelligence is doing that for them the actors don't need to act anymore those actors are being replaced by AI they can even make them look younger yeah they're not needed anymore there's something called that's also Ai and what this is mimicking presidents closed captioning not available interesting huh interesting why does Satan use this tool all of a sudden there's UFOs or aliens are real now oh Mexican Congress just following two little Corp mummified corpses aliens are real now obviously the government's covering up this great Scandal government oh the Chinese are spinos on us by the way oh hello why does he do all this Satan knows and at the same time he was going to vomit all this information to keep you and I but scared to keep us thinking because if you can hear information is that's all he needs to get you to stop remember the the mind of the spirit all he needs to do is conceive something in your mind all he has to do is confuse you just a little bit question the message question the prophet question the formula that he gave but that formula was given today to combat the confusion so God has to equip his men now the information is then God's men have to grow faster the Saints only copying with God I wonder how fast the world is moving in Poland and Africa it has to grow faster if I bring something because I want to get to brother AJ you know what he messed for some reason I don't know if I bring the words I can bring the word for word but I've defeated the purpose of the world he said anybody without the Holy Ghost guess is so that's how a man would ravage a woman you know there's a lot of people that don't understand I was asked the question I didn't know how to answer it says how can a just God how could he let these things happen how can he let the deaths of these children it seems like the good people are always the ones that die right they're saying it's not that it's not God allowing that is it's like just take this concept now they say the cold doesn't existed they say that it's just the absence of heat just like Darkness doesn't exist they say amen foreign now keep this keep keep your eyes on this church the devil is putting up propaganda and it's not it's not with scripture but with the template it's to confuse the mind of the unlearned they're not spiritual people and we are living in the most glorious day yes that any people has ever lived yet in the darkest days or the unbelievers unbelievers and the most confusing times for they those who don't know it is remarkable yes the day that we're living what a joy it is confused don't know I just gave you the template now today we're approaching in this dark evil time if it doesn't Confucian that's the purpose like I said watch confusion okay I know that we all know what it means but watch the definitions of confusion definition an act of instance of confusing the quality or state of being confused watch this one here um a confused mass or a mixture now keep that put that one in your pocket because I'm gonna I'm gonna come back to that is a lack of understanding or uncertainty the state of being bewildered right when you're unclear or something some of the synonyms perplexed is to find yourself in difficulty all of difficulties so what has caused this confusion have we done it to ourselves many times we have it in our hands and it takes you back to to pilate I understand that Jesus had to be crucified he had to you Jesus what's this point okay highly had the opportunity to stop the crucifixion so he had the truth the very truth in his hands it was right before him I washed my hands of it oh my goodness my goodness oh if I say it again the truth was in his hands he had the ability to stop I know we all play our part it had to happen I know that Jose never wash our hands of it today brother he says I indict this generation for the second crucifixion my goodness oh bye yeah remember that one too because I'm going to come back to that is um guard your your hearts especially your young people Everyone is guard your heart the scripture says in proverbs 4 23 you don't need to turn to it this is let them not depart from their eyes it starts off um you don't have to turn to all the square phrase it here my son attend to my words not my words his words let them not depart from the lies keep them in the midst of your hearts oh they are live for Quezon Vida unto those that find them and health to all the flesh keep thine heart with all diligence see the goal of saying like I said he wants to keep you confused but let's let's get a little bit deeper here I'm going to get into my message now okay just put our spiritual thinking caps on here and if you're new like I said I I apologize um like so I'll do my best to try to try to break it down a little bit okay A couple of months ago um I was asleep it was about two two three in the morning I can't remember and I happened to wake up and I looked to my left the walls to my left there and for a split second is foreign so I started obviously I went to the prophet to the message and I started I started out the message the handwriting on the walls and as I'm reading there for some reason the word Babylon baby didn't think anything at first we know that the king about Cesar he was the Babylonian King at that time when the hand running on the walking around but we see but watch this King we know that Babylon had gone and conquered Jerusalem taking the vessels taking some of the people that's how Daniel and the three Hebrew children were founded so we see belshasar at one time he had this big party um a thousand noblemen all these important people right he said he had a party of all his Lords of a thousand people and he must have wanted to show off or something because we brought out he brought out the vessels right in front of his wives or concubines and Fantasies drinking wine out of it is [Music] so I started reading it like I said I started to understand oh okay Babylon Babylonia what does Babylon mean we know the brother balances Babylon this is confusion the actual definition means the gates of God definition we'll start off as Gates of God ends up as confusion when there's mixture in there when I mix my Humanity it's it's confusion as Confucian it's Babylon it's Babylonia so I started to see that this that this King this Babylonian King comes he worship a god a lot of the Moon how many how many knows what the name of that God was think in terms of spiritual speaking bring it bring it down to to us today but it is the name of that God was sin no science so I see that the prophecy that came to belshas because he had done these things he said you will fall this night he said the Persians and the medes will come take over the kids there's something there okay Babylon Babylonian confusion I saw what he did with the vessels [Music] is showing off maybe there was with the wives and the concubines maybe they're with churches and he said especado oh is he not a vessel Brothers oh if I remain in that if I categorize certain ones are and certain ones watch Persia if I have excuse me I hope my voice holds up handwriting on the wall you can look at that phrase oh there's handwriting on the wall oh you can use it in a present tense or handwriting on the wall the handwriting on the wall there is currently on the wall right now and if we deviate from the template that said Unity is and we bring a division a division is usually annotated Maybe by a wall if we put walls then you have just supplied a canvas has come in just like this country Republican are you democrat it is is it tapes or is it if I fold it is forgive me for for yelling this man that that picked these wild gourds and they made a porridge out of it and the prophet saw that yeah I said that's poison in the pot I don't want to do that so what did he do he says I sprinkled a little bit of meal offerings sprinkle a little bit of the word he went back to the temple a little bit no harm came to them Babylonia I don't want to be and found in Babylon Babylonia I don't want to provide a wall to let the hand write on it was judgment I don't want you know quiero you know Persia percia was renamed in 1935 it was renamed to Iran Iran and I looked up what the word Iran means and it means Noble it means a lot of things but one of the words see how we mask itself a lot of times it will mask itself I don't want to do that I want to bring it clean as clean as possible I don't want confusion it says excuse me guard your heart is a Corazon you know we see vemos Babylon started Babylonia brother Brown says let me see if I can find the quote I got my notes all mixed up a little too excited there sorry sorry brother Noah the hour has come oh no say that for last I'm sorry but that's that's see that's the whole thing okay now we see arabemos anyone without the Holy Ghost again I'll come back to that uh anyone without the Holy Ghost he says start off in the beginning yeah in the form of a man in the form of a beast so we we saw what happened and the product which came how the two lines were crossed come on man it's a hybrid product and they say they say it came over in the ark he said okay well it crossed over through Hampton because he saw the nakedness of his father who knows he said and there's different interpretations for that yeah the reality of it is this they crossed over and all of them because they were all hybrids says you see Babylon in the beginning there is we see why the new birth is so important the new birth is absolutely it's imperative and known as Minto ES imperative it's absolutely necessary it's absolutely necessary that's the only way you're not going to be confused you're going to hear you're going to take the template usted and it's going to change you to the stature as the scripture says and it's going to make you be born again because your desires are different because if you look at your DNA inside there are markers in there there's a sequence in there it's numbered in there it's what he says that that the number of women no say it's inside everybody that's why we have to be born again anybody without the Holy Ghost Santo will bring out that nature so when I go out into the forest I see trails all over Gilbert all you hunters will know this I'm not 100 I'm a camper but I try you know so you because I also you come again and I can usually tell the trails that are used the most there's some I even see there's trails that are even abandoned oh is that that's that's what the thrill of the serpentry is a serpent and he draws a dove inside the heart dog Obama I can see him rise from his seat the Priestly robes drop around him I can see him say come here East Wind West Wind North and South foreign Babylon [Music] it's just the only thing that burned was their ties do not take God out of the pictures remember Look Away to Jesus you take your sight off of Jesus you put it on the man established man I hope they helped you a little bit I appreciate everybody it's a it's kind of intimidating to preach you know from like a man like brother Fabio but um [Applause] all right Alleluia praise the Lord would you just stand with me he never promised that the cross would not get heavy the hills would not be hard to climb [Music] he never offered the victories without fighting but he said [Music] so remember when you're standing in the valley of decision [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] if you need the Lord just raise your hand he never offered the victory without body but instead hell would always [Music] standing decisions [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you so many times a question the [Music] the times and trials the weakness blurs my vision and let my frustration seems against the word ahead [Music] but then I am reminded I've never been forsaken I've never
