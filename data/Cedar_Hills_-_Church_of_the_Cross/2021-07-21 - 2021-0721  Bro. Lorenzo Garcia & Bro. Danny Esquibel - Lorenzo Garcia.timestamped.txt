[41:18] bad day today
[41:43] so the nephews you know they they they
[41:45] helped me get the tv out
[42:00] and
[42:11] and uh it's a smart tv television
[42:16] intelligent so that we're able to stream
[42:17] and stuff like that
[42:22] so i'm sitting on my couch to turn on
[42:23] the tv
[42:26] and the tv is crap
[42:40] and at that point i'm like why lord
[42:57] so i'm like okay well you know what i'm

[44:18] perfect
[44:20] it's
[45:09] a person that finds himself in certain
[45:12] situations
[45:14] now i believe that joseph had every
[45:17] right
[45:20] after everything that he went through
[45:23] him being without fault yet
[45:29] being in prison
[45:58] he gave him a coat

[47:20] can you imagine that back
[47:35] satan gets something
[47:50] you can put that picture up
[47:52] [Music]
[48:31] it has a significant
[49:41] can we start to look at them with
[49:42] understanding
[50:39] him this dream especially he says this
[50:40] one through this dream
[50:43] hate him even more though if you have a
[50:44] mind say how are we going to bow down
[50:49] how are we going to do that joseph so
[50:52] here's joseph in this scene
[50:54] and joseph goes out to go look for his
[50:56] brother
[50:58] and when he sees his brothers the
[51:01] scriptures say when they see him
[51:05] they start to plot against
[51:48] is
[52:28] have you ever found yourself in a pit
[52:29] where you can't get out
[52:55] i remember being 17 18 years

[58:33] joseph had a very
[59:16] have you ever flirted
[59:56] and he gives honor to his mouth
[1:00:40] god
[1:02:17] and joseph is forgotten
[1:02:32] is
[1:03:42] so
[1:03:55] everything checked out with a word
[1:04:10] he
[1:04:38] another type
[1:05:20] it's the same thing
[1:05:36] my time is almost up but i'm trying to
[1:05:38] hurry there's a famine on the land
[1:05:41] and joseph's brothers just to come down
