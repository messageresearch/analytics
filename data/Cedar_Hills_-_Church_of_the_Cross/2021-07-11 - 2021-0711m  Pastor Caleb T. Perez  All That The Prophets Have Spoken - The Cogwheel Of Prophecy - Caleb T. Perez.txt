we sure deem it a privilege once again to be in the house of the lord and uh good to see each and every one of you thank you brother joseph god bless you to you and your wife and believe we have brother brother mr martinez back there too god bless you good to have you in our midst amen you love him this morning amen amen we we want to it's a continuation of of of uh to be like jesus but it's a different series there's a different purpose behind it and i'd like to to start this series and put a platform foundation this week and i'd like to entitle it all that the prophets have spoken we'll find out exactly amen so we look we look forward to what the lord has for us yes how important it is to know that the scriptures they are authentic they are true that is god in letter forms understand young people i and know one thing that god when we come into the house of the lord it's a it's a very serious and and should be a holy experience and sometimes that we want to wait to start a message sometimes we come into the into the sanctuary and uh we have our phones on it you know and and after a while it's not just the phones that go off in the middle of service people that check their facebooks whose facebooks their emails even check the news what's going on i want to tell you it is so disrespectful to the holy ghost when the word is coming forth i remember even our our founding pastor somebody getting up to go to the bathroom in the middle of a sermon that was a no-no no no and he would say you you disturb the holy ghost when you do that so let's not grieve the holy ghost i'm asking you that when you walk through those doors okay let's have some respect imagine them doing the service of the lord and imagination during their sacrifices in the middle of a sacrifice hold on hold on yeah we should conduct ourselves as such and i will tell the deacons police you're the policeman of the church police somebody has their phone oh brother i have the bible app or not don't worry i'll have you sit down in a moment i was sitting there the other day and i was listening to the bible happen don't get me wrong but i was sitting to the i was sitting listening to the bible app and all of a sudden the holy spirit speaks to me and he says do you know how much more you'd get out of it yeah just let them do it let's not the easier time we can have is what we go to right nothing wrong if you're on your way to work hearing the scriptures that's okay nothing wrong with that when you get by yourself words come from your mom read it and say bless the lord oh my soul because the man that's reading it to you is saying bless the lord oh my soul [Music] anyways you take that up with the lord if you have a problem with that don't get upset once again if he taps you on the shoulder once again let's not grieve the holy ghost i want to where's the microphones did you look at the microphone set up don't understand those microphones one right there okay and then you got one okay give one to the to the young man over there okay give them to the sister you'll know what it's for in a little bit here i'm going to have you the young people they're going to be my readers from now on i want to hear the word of god come from them all right luke the 24th chapter lucas and we'll go as long as the lord leads us and uh we'll do the best we can this morning to lay the foundation for this message luke 24 25 and 27 that will be your sister and as soon as you're done you can pass it over to the sister okay yours brother over there yours will be romans 15 4. okay but go ahead my sister said unto them both fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken verse 27 now and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself wow may god add his blessings to the reign of his word and you may be seated what a thing it is to believe all that's everything that the prophets have spoken how many would like to would have loved to have been there with jesus and the two on the road to emails imagine being part of that conversation and just to hear jesus begin to expound on the scriptures he began at moses the bible says i want to tell you when he begins at moses that also includes everything that moses wrote not just the life of moses but remember moses if you want to write that down who who wrote the first five books of the bible we're going to be so basic and so we want you to get this we want a good foundation here who wrote the first five books of the bible very good amen somebody tell me what those first five books are go ahead very good genesis exodus leviticus numbers deuteronomy it includes all his writings including and he went through all the prophets the bible says expounding hablandoles this wasn't just the top of it he was explaining expounding unto them the scriptures this is concerning himself i would have loved to have been there once again watch now he said all that the prophets have spoken in other words what he was telling them right in front of them right in their midst immediately walking alongside them was all that the prophets had spoken of trying to tell them he was all that the prophets had spoken [Music] but he is trying to get them to identify him okay not just by eyesight then the question continues can you identify yourself in scripture that's what we want to find out he wants to be known as the identified christ of all the ages but can you identify him in the scriptures right now we hear many times that we don't really need the old testament you've ever heard that no necessity to read the old testament we're not living under the covenant of the law anymore i've said it time and time again if you don't understand brother aj next to him you're going to be daniel chapter one verse three and four okay so have it ready and then the next sister sister rebecca you will have uh daniel i'm sorry uh just have you guys ready so you you'll have amos 3 7 okay okay there you go or whatsoever things were written a fourth time that's the things that were written in the old testament written for our learning what were they written for who's learning about it i looking to say that was written for my learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have my goodness this is how we're going to have hope okay my whole goal of this is to make you fall so in love with the lord i want you to fall so in love with the scriptures that you can't wait to get up in the morning and read your bible [Music] that you can't wait to get up and during the day just get over some notes and and see what the lord has to say i want reading the scriptures to be more important than plain xbox i want it to be more and more important of you maybe that has some jobs whatever your job is i want you to understand that this is do you know how many times the new testament references the old testament i mean those of you that have read the bible let me see how many of you have read the entire bible wow let me give they'll have read the quran how many times over and over and over how many christians do we have here and you've and and many of you have never read the bible i talked to brother caleb once yeah we're good friends we have a great relationship someone we went with he's never talked to me ever again wow you have a different definition of friendship i was going to challenge the young people now i got to challenge the older people and we wonder why with the holy spirit can't accomplish what it's what it wants to do in the service that in itself shows we're not prepared to receive it that god somehow just going to kenosis himself and just show himself because he shows himself by the scripture how could i this morning get you to understand how important it is you know i i find out even in of those that claim to be believers of malachi 4. and a lot of people that claim that don't even don't even hear the messages in any way but i noticed that many of them can tell you what brother branham said most of the time wrong the way we think we heard it for yourself but i'll tell you that many people they know the message but don't know the scripture to back it up so as long as you're talking to somebody in the mess oh brother says oh bro but you go out there sharpen your sharpen your swords so i'm going to make a challenge to the church here young people from now to the end of the year read the whole bible you'll have to read about seven to eight chapters a day to get to the whole bible sit down at nine at night and read the bible you're doing other things you can read it anytime i'm just saying that's when when when we get together as a group how many how many will do that we're christians right amen amen i don't want to be classified as a churchgoer that's right christian is one thing churchgoers another thing i got that out of the way do you know how many scriptures from the old testament are referenced in the new testament but one scholar estimates that 10 percent of the new testament is the referencing of the old testament as i've read the bible before you pick it up different places but i was shocked to see how many there are another scholar counted 855 references in the new testament another scholar made the following counts 302 direct quotes 493 illusions it alluded to something alluded to it in other words and 138 possible illusions bringing a total of 933 references it is said that jesus quoted the old testament 78 times however that is only what is written because we know on this trip to emmaus he quoted all of them imagine him and he wasn't walking with him saying hold on and this is what jeremiah and this is what isaiah says he was the word watch this now this this is so tremendous to me as we as we lay this foundation every scripture spoke of him jesus being the image of the invisible god jehovah of the old jesus has now become jesus of the new year tell me how i'm going to say it again every one of these little points they mean something jesus very good thank you thank your friend there jehovah of the old is jesus of the new year and his whole life was the fulfillment of those scriptures he was the fulfillment of all that the prophets had spoken and all that jesus did and lived was for one purpose can you imagine this that our whole life would be for one purpose to fulfill scripture i'm not here to be a billionaire i'm not here for other things though if god adds whatever he has praise the lord a purpose in life is to fulfill scripture that's what his whole life was about and that's what the whole life of the bride of jesus christ is about it's not how much of the world we can be a part of this world we've got to work and we've got to do a lot of things but we are not of this world watch what he says he healed the people why so that it might be fulfilled what i want to ask you the question how many of you are aware of every prophecy or scripture i just want to cry out this morning get into god's word nothing better that you can invest your time into and now can you imagine us living that way one of the victorious people we would be victorious why did you do that the scriptures could be foreign i don't know about you but i'm feeling good this morning is this is why this series is so important to me and to you i want you to know the scriptures young people so that no one can deceive you want you to tell your neighbor you better have more than that our founding pastor would always say now don't just take my word for it go out and you study it for yourself you'll come back and know that i told you the truth now it cost you something to search it that way nobody gonna take it away i think many times that this new generation wants to live off of a second hand or third-hand generation regulations think about daniel 1 3 who's got daniel 1 3. stand up real quick and i want you to read that and the king spake speak unto ashbanez is that how you speak um the master of his enochs that that he should bring certain of the children of israel and of the king seed and to the prince princes who are these children that he told him to bring from jerusalem go ahead her sport trojan and who whom was no blemish oh my let's just stop there for a moment children whom there was no blemish that much about the elected lady and her children watch what this is talking about what else i'm skillful in all wisdom children that are skillful in all wisdom yeah understanding science right that we didn't come from from a monkey ability in them to stand in the king's palace wow and what else and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the child i wondered when i read this how many of our children and young people would have been chosen at that time would i have been chosen 20 when he found these children and they were brought to babylon what does it say and in all matters of wisdom and understanding that the king inquired of them he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all in his world the knowledge of god is so much greater than the knowledge let me tell young people [Applause] oh you i don't know if you believe me or do you believe me yeah don't you ever let anybody tell you that you're lesser than them you would be like i don't think you know who my papa is daniel was between the ages of 12 and 14 years old when he was taken into captivity 12 to 14 years old imagine at that age that you would be taken into captivity to another country living in another kingdom full of heathens and themselves as much pagans as they were but daniel pero daniel 12 and 14 years old he kept himself now this is important okay everything i'm telling you is leading up to something else instructions to daniel he was ousted from his people we went i don't know how much maybe nine months ten months whatever without coming to church here he is 70 years not a year no nano except what he's saying himself how many of you have a song to sing well nobody sings around you well there's nothing going on here there's no revival here really [Music] [Applause] he held true to god oh he was never tempted oh yes he was a human he was under 12 to 14 year old young man but i'm going to tell you the way i see him what kept him local during his time because those i want somebody to tell me how without the holy ghost did he keep his testimony himself anybody can say and he read what the prophets before him had spoken of all the ages of the toilet identified in the scriptures i want to drive this home this morning but i gotta stay true to what i was called this morning to do and that [Music] jeremiah was the prophet's prophet [Music] as a young man he studied the prophets what the prophets had spoken i understood by books that jeremiah jeremiah's book and bring him to such a place that even israel coming out of them alive would go back to their homeland you know how can we spend wasteless time gambling holes and i didn't pick movies and phones oh that's me i'm sorry i'm sorry that that was that got put in there sometimes the pastor speaks on something and you would like to get up and get and go out too long and you're dissatisfied it's got a dovetail from matthew to revelation he never said that he said make sure it goes from genesis all the way to revelation why he was showing us all that the prophets had spoken oh my my my how many are with me this this morning we're getting into some good stuff here always remember i want you to remember this is [Applause] the record that shows i find out these are all scriptures you gotta know young people you've got to have a firm foundation surely the lord god the lord god everybody together surely who okay go ahead we'll do nothing some things go ahead but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophet oh and once god has spoken you know this because yours have lost he don't change the way he does things he does things and won't change them no matter the circumstances not for anyone no time he has a way of doing things that the prophets have spoken when god reveals something to his prophet the moment that the prophet speaks it the moment it automatically starts the wheel of prophecy moving momentum is stationary i remember the will in the middle of the wheel the will of prophecy what is the cog wheel show me up show them a picture you all know what this is oh my there's a big one [Music] that's the great cog wheel of prophecy and every until god says another prophet everlasting father it's gonna draw in other little cog wheels are the ones the person or people that will fulfill the prophecies is he's a good mechanic the job of a gear is to do whatever exactly right it is to transfer power from one part of a machine to another espera i don't know if you got that or not i'm going to say it again the job is the driver gear that is the other gear turns counter clockwise i get flooded i'm sorry if the gear is going forward and stealing prophecy is going forward it's important to understand because the purpose of prophecy is not to isolate the big cog but it's to engage in the other cog wheels so that the power messages so brother branham says now this person is going to be healed but you say everything has to be in order here's the prophet now but i can't put the hat there this is where i can he may do it and not even be aware that he just did that he may be drinking a cup of coffee and all of a sudden the vision is ready to be fulfilled everything has got to be in this order but the prophet can't do that himself he brings the prophecy i don't know about you [Applause] that just included me in you this woman i'm going to say it again that just included me and you this is okay now let's go on israel israel brother branham says in israel and the church the hour of the cogs of god's prophetic wills prophetica has ground up to this timeline time for this deliverer to come on the scene to abraham abraham that the children of israel would be in bondage for 400 years it's already prophesied [Music] [Music] oh we're too busy sometimes it's time to get our attention that fits perfectly but sure i'm going to say it again goggs god's cog wheel of prophecy why does it grind slow because his will was that nobody no one would perish he gives us every opportunity with him his long suffering keeps it from going too fast you want to see something tremendous i'm going to turn those lights off sister can you just reach over there and just this is god's perfect night [Music] [Music] sometimes we think lord have you abandoned me lord it just seems like nothing's going right now the will of prophecy is perfect [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] perfect [Music] [Music] that's why he says [Music] [Music] i'll never leave [Music] wow and we give one to the lord jesus [Applause] i have no idea when i started giving me like 15 minutes and then we'll i don't know i won't get to where i want to get to today but but we'll we'll get to where god wants it notice the way that brother branham puts this because we think we're just going to be standing here and all of a sudden [Music] he's going to it'll catch on to us how many have you ever seen a something do you understand how important this is watch this now something's got to happen the little will is turned by faith the big will by the power of god yeah who's been asking god for something this morning come on let me see your hands i don't care what it is waiting for the faith through the beat of the cogwheel of prophecy now notice this now he says it'll make light loose that's moving together okay so you know what i'm talking about i give you examples here's martha a question concerning her brother god a place of worship i believe my because god is vindicating his word in your [Music] that he was the messiah no doubt about it i believe that you are that christ that was to come because your works testify that god has sent you you're exactly watch this now watch this now think it's an instagram this is why it's so important church to know the scriptures is i believe that you're exactly what you're identified in the scriptures and i believe that this is the day i want you to tell that to whatever you're asking for i believe lord that you are here come on i believe lord that you are here you've been identified by scriptures and i believe that this is the day that messiah should come and i have been looking for it what did it produce brother brown says it produced the resurrection of her brother tell me we have nothing to do with the resurrection of prophecy for those let me be one of those teeth let me be one of those teeth it doesn't fit every other cog quilt but brother it seems like it's like it's going so fast if you had a cog wheel with ten teeth on absolutely i haven't done some there's some things i have maybe didn't do that's very good did you know that we'll solve what we read i'm sorry we'll reap what we saw whether good or bad and that's why many times when we see when we do something wrong we we may see well nothing happened to me we think we got away with it just remember that why when we go out and live any kind of life i think that because something doesn't happen to us right away that we got away me and and then brother tim matthew 24 11 and then this mr sarah matthew 7 15 and 16 and then brother abe uh deuteronomy 18 uh 18 20 and 20. go ahead forever o lord thy word is settled in heaven heaven doesn't argue about when god says something it's already settled we argue about it but in glory it's settled already like gloria can say amen to that already settled yes okay matthew 24 11. now we want to know now i'm going to i'm going to read these scriptures and then i'm going to close already i want to stop here this is my foundation for these messages matthew 24 11. do we know then if god will do nothing but he reveals his secret unto his servants the prophet how do we know then if that's a real prophet or not because you all are going to understand and hear that many false prophets will arise and you've got to be able to know which one is the true prophet and which one is not 24. and many false prophets shall rise and deceive many oh my let's not be part of that many no how do these false prophets deceive the people these scriptures down matthew 7 we got i'm showing you by 7 scripture and 16. go ahead sister beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep oh that's how way to ho ho ho ho beware of false prophets that how did they come beware false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing oh but really inside or what keep on reading but inwardly they are rave ravening gloves so how will you know them you shall know them by their fruits deuteronomy 18 now let's go back to see the old testament deuteronomy 18 20 and 20-22 but the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name which i have not commanded him to speak or thou or that shall speak in the name of other gods even that prophet shall die and if thou say in thine heart how shall we know the word which the lord hath not spoken how are you going to know the word that god hasn't spoken anyone that even claims to be a prophet use the scripture oh they'll use scripture let me tell you but it doesn't coincide from genesis to revelation when a prophet speaketh in the name of the lord if the thing follow not nor come to pass that is the thing which the lord he has not spoken hold on right there that's how you know i see what a prophet says comes to pass believe him if it doesn't say no don't believe him because if he speaks of him by himself what's going to happen one reading but the prophet has not but the prophet has spoken presumptually that means simply with arrogance and pride thou shalt see thou shalt not be afraid of him okay that's simple if somebody comes to tell you and it's [Music] i'm going to tell you that this is where we're going where we're going and i'm going to stop now thank you mommy but the musicians would come in there's so much to say but we're going to put this out as long as the lord gives us this we'll keep on going with this but we want to get somewhere this is where we're going now listen closely now this is where we're going okay we're going to go through the whole the life of jesus can show all that the prophet spoke the old testament how many know that jesus was the complete fulfillment of all the old testament who's the fulfillment of the new testament that's where we're going oh yeah watch this now in the message the masterpiece nearly 2 000 years god has again been making him a masterpiece he struck adam a piece off of him um fulfillment of the old this bride to make that or this masterpiece and now it's been nearly two thousand years another masterpiece for christ another that's the way he makes his masterpieces he can only you've been a wonderful audience let's all stand together and give the lord jesus a mighty hand of praise juan baywest senor [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] oh and your voice

labor you don't go through i die i told my wife if i die bury me i wrote this last night yesterday and the reason i wrote wrote this is uh of what we saw in the land of karamojo where where brother jokes is from you it's where they put all the quote unquote rejects of the country the criminals the murders etc etc but from the moment we met brother yolks everyone on our team the most interesting people wanted to go to karamoja before we went up to karamoja until and in that saturday there was about 10 000 people personas and there was kings from nigeria or from ghana and dignitaries the president of the country well this was a royal event but i want to take you to a land called and every negative adjective that was given we encountered quite the opposite you ever hear the scripture that says having nothing yet possessing all right we will never forget the reception that was given they were jumping they were shouting and the lord had me write and every positive adjective we can afford it and what miracles god did so wonderful wonderful to see and to here they are now written in our hearts by god's own hand these men have suffered because of the gospel's sake when he was captured drove in a motorcycle for hours i feel like a lightweight just coming from silver in a tacoma for hours in a motorcycle dirt road whatever it may be to go and preach the gospel a cog he told me the story the testimony of when he went to a sister's house this family had been going with days without eating and we sent it to the hands of brother brother yolks and brother yokes gets to the sister's house at midnight she went to sleep thinking she would not see the morning but at midnight he went and goes and wakes her up that's how much he loves people to give her food to give her family food what a life what a heart these are people that you that you look for it way back in history these are people in our time what a heart what a life it doesn't always come through rightly foreign words brother branham says it but in that land there's no covet there's no pain there's no sorrow all right no tears only perfect and i want to leave you with a quote that i heard our pastor say at sister bernice's funerals and i wanted to run through the whole cemetery and he says that many people will say certain thing caused and took that certain person away but let everybody know that kova did not take brother yokes away for god took him the day he gave his life to him brother the oaks didn't die last week [Applause] not goodbye my friend noes adios it's until the morning we want to ask you to pray for his loving family you will be missed that is my tribute to brother yolk's my friend miami do me a favor no can you go get my bible that's right there in my seat would you thank
