Petrobras judgment must begin here but we should an empathetic II now now how many of you have a conscience what does taste in a nut con sincere right I think we all have a conscience as a human being toast animals in that concern see a commissary assume and we have been given a conscience since way that I'm not consensus my question is why is it that we are not conscious forget many things lepromatous porque no estamos con sientes them which as cosa ask yourself Lucas are pregunta more conscious of a lot of things but there are many things were not conscious about these these time most conscientious and muchas they don't know it we're not conscious of everything that goes on around us it's all okay here unless so many things that are happening we're not even aware of that empezando
