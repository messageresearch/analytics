[19:59] guys all want to open up your
[20:00] instructions and you read it with us
[20:12] second Kings 2:11 and the time that
[20:19] David and it came to pass as they still
[20:31] went on and talked that behold there
[20:38] appeared a chariot of fire and horses of
[20:44] fire and parted them both asunder and
[20:50] Elijah went up by a whirlwind into
[20:53] heaven
[20:54] wow you guys imagine that Elijah and
[21:04] Elijah just talking having a normal
[21:07] conversation probably about the Lord
[21:10] because that's what they were about and
[21:12] so while they were talking a chariot and
[21:15] horses of fire came down picture it like
[21:19] a rocket ship came down and it picked up
[21:24] Elijah to come back home to his father
[21:26] isn't that awesome yeah that's amazing
[21:33] no Elijah he was one of God's astronauts
[21:38] also and guess what I mean I have a nice
[21:44] fancy space suit and nice fancy rocket
[21:48] ship but Elijah didn't need that no he
[21:54] is a matter of fact the Bible says
[21:57] before he took off he took off his
[22:00] mantle he took off his spacesuit and
[22:04] then he took off into heaven you say
[22:07] well brother how how was he gonna make
[22:10] it in space he's he's gonna die up there
[22:12] in the atmosphere he's not gonna be able
[22:14] to breathe maybe he's gonna freeze well
[22:17] how many knows what this spacesuit is
[22:19] for for oxygen her hair
[22:24] protection yes all those are good
[22:27] answers but it was to keep it's to keep
[22:30] the astronaut pressurized it keeps him
[22:33] safe from the environment but Eliezer
[22:36] still didn't have one but I'll tell you
[22:39] one thing he did have that was God in
[22:44] his heart and guess what each and every
[22:50] one of you have God in your hearts also
[22:53] you know that yeah now he knows Elijah
[23:02] most of you guys know Elijah right but
[23:05] for those who don't I'm gonna give you a
[23:07] little bit of background Elijah was
[23:09] God's powerful prophet not only a
[23:13] prophet but he was also an astronaut and
[23:16] in the days of Elijah there was a king
[23:19] this King his name was Ahab like every
[23:23] other King but he made one mistake he
[23:27] married a girl named Jay
[23:34] yeah I'm sorry I can't say it does
[23:40] anyone know who King Ahab married
[23:41] Jezebel there we go
[23:47] and this Jezebel she was a nasty stinky
[23:51] alien no she didn't like Elijah because
[24:00] of Iser condemned her and he said
[24:02] because you paint your face green God's
[24:04] gonna condemn you I got a treat for you
[24:09] guys because I've brought her you guys
[24:13] gonna see what she looks like you don't
[24:18] want to see her I kind of don't want to
[24:20] see her either so this is just about
[24:36] pretty ugly huh yeah disgusting see she
[24:42] has her lipstick and makeup and she
[24:45] painted her whole face green I don't
[24:46] know why I don't know if guys like green
[24:49] faces but anyways god condemned her and
[24:54] he told her what was going to happen to
[24:56] him and to keep it short
[25:00] this is Jezebel this is very sharp like
[25:05] God's Word and boom she was gone just
[25:11] like that yes you got burned to the
[25:18] ground
[25:26] he say whoa brother sound this is all
[25:28] great stories but how is that gonna help
[25:31] our spaceship take off well we have an
[25:37] advisor in our day don't we
[25:40] yeah who is our Elisha nah
[25:46] Elijah's brother branham yes Weiser
[25:50] brother Brennaman what did he bring
[25:53] he brought a message for us yes sir he
[25:57] did and if Elijah
[26:02] held God's Word in his heart his day if
[26:08] we hold the God's Word in our heart this
[26:10] day what's gonna happen well the Bible
[26:15] says that God is the same yesterday
[26:16] today and forever so if we go back to
[26:21] the basic instructions to the Bible we
[26:25] hold that in our heart God's gonna
[26:27] perform he's gonna do the same things he
[26:30] did for Elijah
[26:32] all right so God's Word is like fuel and
[26:41] I have a good idea why my spaceship
[26:43] didn't take off because I forgot to stop
[26:44] at the gas station and put gas in it hey
[26:47] just simple as that I'm sorry
[26:50] yeah but God's Word to us is fuel we'll
[26:54] hold it in our hearts it just fuels us
[26:57] and we're almost ready to take off but
[27:00] there's one thing missing
[27:02] yeah and maybe my my spaceship is just
[27:06] tilted a little bit and it's not going
[27:08] straight up how it's supposed to it
[27:11] looks a little bit tricky to me doesn't
[27:12] it yeah well God's Word also says
[27:18] through our Elijah through the message
[27:21] of the hour says that the way up is down
[27:26] how many knows what the way you're up is
[27:28] down means hey let me show you all these
[27:32] little kids to end up okay now while
[27:37] you're standing I'm going to tell you
[27:39] something
[27:39] brother Branham says that you can see
[27:42] the way the church you guys is headed by
[27:48] the way they're praying so we'll take
[27:52] that the way up is down you guys do
[27:56] exactly what I'm doing
[28:00] we're gonna pray I say Lord Jesus we
[28:06] thank you and we love you and we come
[28:10] before you just asking that you would
[28:12] help our brother Sammy and his rocket
[28:14] ship to take off amen you guys would
[28:28] straighten it up hurry now the way up is
[28:35] down now that we got our fuel we got our
[28:40] spaceship pointed in the right direction
[28:42] I'm gonna share something with you guys
[28:44] that God shared with me
[28:47] one night he came to me in a dream and
[28:50] he showed me in the church and we were
[28:53] sitting in a circle and brother Benji
[28:56] was guarding the door and brother Jimmy
[28:58] was showing us how to strap in and guess
