[24:28] rolled away
[24:30] this particular
[24:37] now death where it is

[24:50] Oh
[24:53] [Music]
[25:02] [Music]
[25:08] as written

[25:28] perfect
[25:30] bill
[25:35] where is your steam
[25:38] [Music]
[25:41] has rendered you defeat
[25:45] [Applause]
[25:46] Oh
[25:51] glorified for
[25:56] is lifted
[26:03] his reason
[26:14] no the resurrected King you have
[26:19] overcome the great
[26:22] Oh
[26:27] you are the resurrected King you have
[26:33] overcome the brain
[26:36] you have overcome
[26:39] [Music]
[26:44] we see hallelujah
[26:50] [Music]
[26:52] the
[26:53] [Music]
[26:58] we sing hallelujah waste
[27:04] [Music]
[27:07] hallelujah
[27:15] [Music]
[27:25] if there are words for him then I don't
[27:29] have them
[27:31] you see my brain has not used to point
[27:33] for the form of thought that could
[27:36] allocate describe the greatness of my
[27:38] God and my lungs have not yet developed
[27:41] the ability to release a breath with
[27:44] enough agility to read out the greatness
[27:46] of his love and my voice you see my
[27:50] voice is so inhibited restrained by
[27:53] human limits that it's hard to even send
[27:55] the praise up you see if there are words
[27:57] for him then I don't have them my god
[28:01] His grace is remarkable His mercies are
[28:05] innumerable strength is impenetrable
[28:07] he is honorable accountable favorable he
[28:12] is unsearchable yet knowable indefinable
[28:15] yet approachable indescribable yet
[28:18] personal he is behind comprehension
[28:21] further than imagination constant
[28:24] through generations king of every nation
[28:26] but if there are words for him then I
[28:29] don't have them you see my words are
[28:32] view and are trying to capture the one
[28:34] true God using my vocabulary would never
[28:36] do but I use words as an expression an
[28:40] expression of worship to a savior a
[28:42] savior who is birth worthy and deserving
[28:44] of his praise so I use words my heart
[28:47] extolled the Lord blesses his name
[28:50] forever he has won my heart captured my
[28:53] mind and has bound them both together he
[28:56] has defeated me in my rebellion
[28:58] conquered me in my sin
[29:00] he has welcomed me into his presence
[29:02] completely invited me in he has made the
[29:05] self the object of my sight flooded me
[29:07] with mercies in the morning drowning me
[29:09] with grace in the night but if there are
[29:11] words for him
[29:13] I don't have them but what I do have is
[29:15] good news for my god knew that Matt made
[29:19] words would never do that words are just
[29:22] tools that we use the point to the truth
[29:24] so he sent his son Jesus Christ as the
[29:26] word living proof here's the image of
[29:29] the invisible God the firstborn of all
[29:32] creation for by him all things were
[29:34] created giving nothingness formation and
[29:37] by his word he sustains and the power of
[29:40] his name for he is before all things and
[29:42] all things created holy is his name so
[29:46] praise him for his life the way he
[29:50] preserved in strife the humble son of
[29:52] God becoming the perfect sacrifice
[29:54] praise him for his death that he
[29:58] willingly stood in our place that he
[30:00] lovingly endured the grave that he
[30:02] battled our enemy and on the third day
[30:04] rose and victory he is everything that
[30:08] was promised praised as the risen King
[30:11] lift your voice in seeing for one day
[30:14] he'll return for us and we'll finally be
[30:16] United with him for eternity eternity so
[30:21] it's not just words that I proclaim for
[30:24] my words point to the word and the word
[30:27] has the name hope has a name joy has an
[30:31] peace has the name love has a name if
[30:35] that name is Jesus Christ praise His
[30:38] name forever
[30:39] [Music]
[30:45] it's glorified
[30:52] [Music]
[30:53] did
[30:54] [Music]
[30:56] for
[30:58] he is real
