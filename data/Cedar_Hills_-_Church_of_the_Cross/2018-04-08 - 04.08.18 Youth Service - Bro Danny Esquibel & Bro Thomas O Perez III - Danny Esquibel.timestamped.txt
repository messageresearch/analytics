[49:26] they rest in occasional Christian or
[49:28] realm in T not an actor known actor but

[49:42] everything that you do for God the soul
[49:44] of the state as a poor bills it has to
[49:46] be genuine tiene que ser can we know so
[49:51] a few things for God Jesus because as
[49:54] you all know if you think you should
[49:56] know she's she's take canta shall be
[49:58] genuine
[49:59] Keeney no right no correcto

[50:15] know so let's just see how genuine it is
[50:18] like condemn escape and we know and how
[50:20] we can identify ourselves
[50:22] oh come on those beliefs cannot I mean
[50:24] was where the scripture that we just
[50:25] read Alaska to the K account of the day
[50:27] now we read in mark Babel st. Marcos
[50:29] that a woman kill a Mook in having an
[50:32] alabaster box in Yendo Nicastro came to
[50:35] Jesus he knows his sooth but if we turn
[50:37] over in our scripture over to John she
[50:39] will give us an escape to the sock one

[50:47] vamos arose quintic irresistible here
[50:49] right correcto so then Jesus six days
[50:55] before the Passover John 12 windows he
[50:58] came to Bethany where Lazarus was dia de
