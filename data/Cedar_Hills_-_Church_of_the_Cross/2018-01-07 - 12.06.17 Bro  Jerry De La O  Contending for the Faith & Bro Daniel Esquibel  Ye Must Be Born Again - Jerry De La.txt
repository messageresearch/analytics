reading of his reading and you may be seated lecturer Superleggera present our sir so so so we have a situation here tenemos una situación aqui that this man had needed something right don't they stay hombre Pena one sec dad you know how many of us have been in a situation what to say Moses da Vinci question is and and and we need we need the Lord to respond right away okay the system whose concern

saber responders hora you know and and this blind Bartimaeus here yesterday over tomorrow he needed something from the Lord necesito algo de la Senora he knew what he needed Elsevier lo que necesita but he knew who he can get it from purusa in the Kim for the era Sevilla because he knew that if he if he could get Jesus to pray for him because I hear casue sort our Perl that he would receive his site kill Eva receives to Vista so he's sitting on the side it's us in towel Audia and he's just as I say he's begging you let's not even dig and oh but he hears that that he's coming for the scooch Arcadia his sushi and he says they say and he's sitting there because the studies in town and he says you say lord help me Senor me sink Lord please no he's not like that no no not to Assam Anita he knew there was a man coming by I'm here Kevin you know Murray and he cried out yet more and he said Lord you Senora lord I need you Tennessee too and sometimes in our situation so this is the most versatile lord help me Senor me and your prayer your own but we gotta get down on our knees upon the digamos to the struggle and we got a cry out the mesquite Clamato we gotta take everything that is on our mind like a polo castellum anything we got a cast it aside most cathedral is to allah and we got a crowd and we gotta say lord I need you somebody is usin your tennis Lord I have this situation where is the Zito soon and only you can help me solo tu puedes ah you got me because no matter how much I try on my own cause in a porter quad to trot o mi propia Queen know how much we matter we try on our own vamos hacer lo solo we can't do it no podemos hacer los like I can't succeed without him nope well tener éxito C&L but that faith that was inside of blind Bartimaeus all of it then through this yogurt email because when they told him to be quiet Zola Hiroki Seca Yara he cried even louder clam all must Bhutto he got even louder that fake that he had inside of here the fit been through this it stopped Jesus in his trap are all has suicide G's on this tower that fake that he had la fake continued it stopped Jesus right in his travel his shoes on this tower and he says who is that Kenny said who is that calling me Kenny said Kamiyama who is it Guinness it must be somebody with faith to stop him then if he ever see y'all again come upon up another low and he says bring him up here he'll try galore and they bring him on the road ahead on and he says what do you need he'll kick here is Casey Agha I would like to see you do kiss you know where he said go thy way for a vent to Camino I guess I guess it doesn't say he pray for him no no these Sakura put in but he said go thy way to lay ho Betty and he said his fake it to fake his faith you leave him is sayin loss involved so it's gotta be our fake this evening is that mr. Fenster thought I will give us what we need can those dollar Candace's Atomos because what is the faith that was once delivered to the same quality la fecha Universal Los Santos what is the saint get some Sun - well sanctified one right brother Branham says you santificado a saint is a sanctified one moon Sun - is a link SEO scientifical so the faith was once delivered love a cocoon of isn't regala that means it's already been it's already here right this cage I Stuckey I guess if it's been delivered it's already here because ya ask you in regards por que esta aqui so are we sanctified once this evening so most entonces santificado sea and esta tarde are we sanctified ones this evening somos certificado Zen esta tarde are we Saints this evening almost Santos and it's the thought of that that faith that was been delivered to us here's a face it trigger and also which is inside of us already well it's not dentro de nosotros when it makes contact but does it contact oh when it makes contact with God or does it contacto conduce then anything is possible called careful size possible no matter what situation you go through the portal casitas UNESCO state because we all have trials right the most promise we all have tribulations right those that are mostly Willis Eunice we all are children of God right those almost see who the deuce so how many think children of God shouldn't have trials so this quad to see oh there is no the very in the tener problemas sounds funny right so now I'm a akuto so the lord were children the God the Lord takes care of us so most evil that he owes and no squid ah yes he does lo hace yes the Lord does take care of us no squid ah but he's gonna try and test you every single day no private Khalid eeeh he's gonna try your faith every day for about so fake an idea because once your faith rests on God's eternal word those who fear a post on a palabra then anything is possible this is called Carcosa as possibly you know we can go back all through the Bible otra vez de la vie Lia and we can we have perfect examples of faith if it the most imperfect o salafi right we can go we can start with with Abraham when most of us are Conover I'm right he was given a promise I said I'd even a promesa right did it come right away we know inmediatamente no it didn't come right away from you know I see the rapido when he stood on God's Word mauricio para la palabra de Deus he stood and believe God's Word yelkur yo la palabra de Deus and when he made contact equal to e so con talk to when that fakes make contact with God's Word this a face of kentuc to color palabra de Deus then the promised son came it was his illegal prometido vino we can go with Noah right where most barren away no was given a promise I mean silly the una promesa he said build an ark desert America because it's gonna rain porque by oh where did it rain the next day Jovie old yes again T didn't rain did it rain a week later una semana despues no he combined his building the art you can continue or haciendo el ARCA and people pride so I'm looking this crazy man a solid agenda nobody local it's never rained before nunca Oviedo hunt this we don't even know what rain is Lisa vemos Kazuya but he says rains coming in his building a bigger boat pero que estas estas in number oh grundy and he didn't know I do okay so dose is annoying did he quit libero I know he kept hammering away oil continually and he kept hammering away do you know what he kept hammering away and then one day he probably looked up and he say look yeah meat all we do the sky's getting a little dark who else hello sister school senior but he kept hammering away I better continue on Marty eundel but when that time came broken doji welcomed his faith true faith had that arc ready just our LR Calista and he was secure in that are installing seguro channel ARCA he knew Elsevier that God gave a promise chaos Doudna promesa and when God gives her promise back then condos Dada promised a Dierdre and he fulfills it yella come play he's gotta be the same God back there's a mismo dia atrás he's gotta be the same God today I mean mojo solely because it's Jesus Christ because has to Christo the same yesterday this one year so that situation is as it was young he took care of it he'll just come up with all this yesterday we have maybe different situations that was the thing I'm oh so truss it was your but if he fulfilled it back there completely across for them but I use how much more can he fulfill it in this thing you must do what completeness the deal how much more for you and I Tomas paru steady follow me right we can also look at the children and a fiery furnace right there I lose a lousy rose every rose again in a Lord loan they said you gotta do this the hero - newscaster listo he said we ain't gonna do it you see I don't know him they said we were not gonna do it ok no no honest error they put him in there those energy because they believed ok crayon they had faith in your faith that their God killed use they use well take care of them Lucy back with our in that fiery furnace in SA or guardian T and do you think they just put a couple of logs in there hey Craig Ursula Aaron Oh Paquito Delaney a ye know they probably put hundreds and hundreds of trees bouzouki locust in the cns the herbalist but how much more in this day rope on Tomas in Estonia when it's probably even harder today than it was back then smash caliente hora que esta en esta época the devil is out to destroy you an idea the destroyer lost in and that furnace is hotter and hotter disorder was masculine throwy but if he took care of the children there with others he goes a yeah he will take care of you 9 is sleeping with understudy Jordan is guitar because it's our faith that is inside of us his love faith in through the door so truth the faith that we have la fecit animals maybe we don't know it yet the proton or loss of a mistake you don't know what we have those of ammos look at the demos but it's inside of us that is not been true there also because if we go to Luke 8 see almost a Lucas Oh Cho 43 or two-quadrant a trace we also have another scene here there was authorized Anarchy where we have this woman tenemos esta mujer and a woman having an issue of blood twelve years esta mujer for this year the food of the Sangre de esto SE and SEL o sayyaa news which had spent all her living upon physicians Quebec estado and medicos todo con toda Nia you know and I never I've always read this scripture you still probably this the scriptura and I've always read all her living upon physicians yeah I really okay so right away when we think of living what do we think of on the pasamos the que VA or the the kept in Samos that were alive right estamos vivos but living here is different pero esta palabra key is different the living here that she's dead that she that they talked about the local lucky and she spent all her earnings Kotoka VA ganado she spent all her wages so locate the near an open toe VA ganado on physicians of yoga style médicos to heal her or Achilles Inara which had spent all living upon physicians egg estado todo medicos neither could be healed of any federal ninguna via producer karada so no matter how much she spent sin importer quanto gustado she couldn't be healed no polyester senada and she came behind him we know the truss dale and touched the border of his garment taco el border this woman to and immediately Horacio blood Stan chased Antonia mentor said two O's to flooville de sangre and what did Jesus say que dijo ensues he said who touched me who killed my avocado the same situation is blind Bartimaeus right los zetas he welcomed a little jig over female the same situation he said who's that crying out for me who can sell cake llama for me and he stopped yell Peron here aqui he didn't know but he felt something Olivia petals in Telugu he said who touched me who killed me at akkad oh when all denied Peter and they that were with him said mastered master the multitude throng three and press D and says thou who touched me in a gondola use D hope ellos los que la compañía s true la multi to TIA Preta yo preemie this is quien me Otto kado and Jesus said somebody has touched me for I perceived that virtue has gone out of me on his ooh dijo al d'amato cadeau pour que a conocido que salió poder de me and when the woman saw that she was not here she came trembling and falling down before him she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately so this control vehicle occult Aveeno team Blondo post Rondo's SP SE declaró delante de todo el pueblo por causa de que lori Otto kado eco Molly instant a Java acido Sanada and he said unto her ella dijo daughter be of good comfort hija to fit the salvo by faith to faith right thy faith to faith her faith Lavinia has made her home la salvado so it's the faith that we have inside of us is la fête dentro little circle that if we could touch just the hem of His garment solo and got a little mundo that we could be healed for the Muslim sorrows but we have trouble sometimes and most problema services right ii-i've had trouble sometimes I go difficult on ocasion is believing that that God can do something for us the end okay do sweater ser algo por lo so I've had trouble sometimes that God can do something for me he never difficult our Creator it says que Dios wait I said I'll go for me and we've all been given promises right a motorcy video promises we've all been given up promises are promises if you do this this what happens you stole us this is so bizarre but as soon as you've been given a promise look understand let out a promise huh then what creeps in so

this evening Siddalee don't believe him Noli career because he is a bluffer okay Ellison from Poirot he is a liar this evening listen material because if you're going something through something right now but because you say I stopped a Sandow put on if you could just believe just a solo para crear if you could just believe justice elope with you like a rail and that's and that might sound simple right a proptosis when they all go since EU but the hardest thing is getting the people to believe in Roma's difficile it is a circle wave look RAM but if you could just believe God's Word it's just a sort of way to clear up alive another you and anything is possible for you their schooling receive Nepal steady possible for me there Sunil goes as possibly but I mean because it is a faith that is

funeral home entonces my gonna say I saw this wasn't fun at all now this is on Wednesday this is a little miracle instead I got home about 6:30 you got like a second one sec Millia I jumped in the shower man yeah and I was debating on whether I should go to church or not stop in the they're like yes you don't know he said and I would have had a good legitimate excuse if there was such a thing if we pool it a tener una acusación Asakusa he said but then I read the scripture and we're gonna read the scripture tonight dieudonné esta noche and he says as I read the scripture it just did something to me you should meso algo me and that's tremendous because sometimes we get home from work which I got most welcome and we're beat is almost comes on I'm not going oh no way I'll get online internet you must be born again any getting us everything will right so we're gonna read here almost a lyric e and st. Luke chapter 10 son Lucas yes and verse and will saying verse 21 it almost says you've been so loving to you know that if you know your Scripture she said Osama scooter that the scripture before that in a scooter artist is when the those the multitude had gone out and we're casting out Devils right it's gonna foot on the east I want each on the floor of the ammonia and they were rejoicing because the divas spirits were subject to them so Moses speech to Succoth whales and 21 jesus said that he rejoiced and and he had thanked the father that he had hid it from the wise and the prudent right and Academy's water his whose Ragosa quote and Allah speak to it equal and then him and then we're gonna go from verse to verse 22 is we're gonna read almost elementalists he says all things are delivered to me of my father and no man knoweth who the Sun is but the father and who the father is but the Son and he to whom the Sun will reveal him las cosas bonitas por mi padre y nadie conoce que es el el hijo soon el padre McGinnis and Padres you know leak oh yeah kill again el hijo lo quiere hablar and he turned unto his disciples and said unto them privately he will be on the ser los deseos les dijo privately a party how many how many here like private interviews what the Canali and prevail event we love them right mother number in Silver City you mother Silver City I remember that the brother Tommy you know mom she was show up at my house and you gonna be Custer he would knock on the door he took on a puerta so what are you eating tonight is a cake instant communis all we don't got much but eggs and tortillas good enough for me so super simple right so we love those times that we have private interviews or a masseuse the Impossibles good driver okay so Jesus turned to his disciples and said unto them privately he will minister a los libros lady ho apart a bless there are the eyes which see we don't close loss what was given the things that you see look what sort of races so tonight blessed it are your eyes in this you suppose because you think yesterday those things before I tell you that many prophets and Kings have desired to see those things which you see because you okay muchos profit the serious this year on we're looking was of those ways and have not seen them in low Vietnam and to hear those things which you hear your loss loss look a ways and have not heard them you know or you don't know what a bless the people that we are in to see them so I just read you this whole thing here the latest those lucky what makes a man do that yes don't normally a status quo stuff because the Lord has allowed um it's in your blood or the house to see what prophets have never seen the Prophet as dr. Viren what wise men have longed to see you killed hombres Chavez nunca and we have been privileged to see those things you know mostly the probably carelessness caused us and the Bible says in 25 love you ladies have made distinct oh and behold a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him saying master what shall I do to inherit eternal life he one interpreted del la silla want o ez ho but I probably maestro haciendo ki Kostas era demos la vie Eterna and he said unto Him in adikam what is rain in the law gets the script on a lane how do you read it Kamali's what's written in the law how do you read it and he answered him saying thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind and thy neighbor as thyself can respond generally for Amar's Elsinore Julia's canto to Corazon in canto to Alma in canto this versus a control to maintain yeah via tube pro chemo come on to mismo so it really opens up something here after Albuquerque because as he tells his disciples become oblivious to this applause less than are your eyes in the circus for they see or give in now we know that to see the most cake it better is to understand right parent in there and so this lawyer interpreted only he's asking Jesus logistics what must I do to inherit eternal life and he said how do you read the law it's a post como como la la I love the Lord thy God with all their heart your mind first and then love your neighbor your logo our mistress you know but that's not were the problems that but I you know Stella problema that's not the problem you know Florida because if you ask tonight or kc-10 esta noche how many here get done to say Aki love the Lord I'm an assayer how many love God what torment of those everybody loves God

then we go to the movies we don't watch TV we don't Ruiz now the thoughts that dominates your mind low spin cimento skill domine on a cement a will eventually dominate your life and circumstances don't mean a su vida so think faith thoughts piensan been cement was offense speak faith words Outland beloved as a fan right a man love yourself I mister so there's two men in the Bible I those whom but in Liberia and better talked about pretty often lawndale's pretty often and I'm gonna read first Corinthians where they are pyramidal the Corinthians 11:31 say theta and it says for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for lo cual i muchos firmus devil atados Andros otro scimitar determine so there's many that are sick muchos in pedimos many that are weak muchos the villa Davos and there's many that sleep muchos and the word there sleep means la palabra door meet Kayla received their dead just a mortise many are why okay because they do not for this they eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself because they do not discern the Lord's body okay no this here little cuerpo de Senor they've never learned to love themselves because when you love your sound OMA see that's where the new birth is I use lunacy be another Brown says in my country we have oak trees and any bystander most audible is Robles coming spring now you know a limb you know all the leaves on the tree thought of a system analyst them trees last year still there now I don't have to go out and pick every one of them leaves off so that new leaves come on but I can well a so custom ring and just let the new life come up be like your saligan and the old leaf drops off yellow be Ephesus okay that's the same thing it is about the Spirit of God hey let me I'm across our Zilla spirit to live yours whether you're a Christian or not is Christian or let the new life of Christ come in the Christian life dicey la Vida Posada vehicle can you become a new creature what a be innocent work computer in Christ Jesus Cristo pursues oh that's what it is always look yes so many don't discern the Lord's body muchos notice here look what will the senior and we find Cain and Abel in control Sakai in the oven and everybody says oh that Cain okay or excuse me Abe over uh he loved God a llama adios more than Cain damask and that's not true yes almost hear them Cain love God just as much as able to come on Cain went to church ain't wear like this yeah just as much as Abel vehicle mode in fact Cain's offering his master in the friend okay if you think about it you look inside his offering okay official was more sweat of the brow than enables it but as I could be so much worse okay kid right it took more work to grow out and growth grow the fruit vegetables must rock with the oculus cosmic a thoughtless meant to slay a lamb they're imported elite though so Cain loved God Kane are more so we find out what the difference was uncle Thomas levy parents yeah what's the offering kettle ofrenda and the reason we come here tonight you must like it Astor Rochester bring an offering I don't know but it depends on what kind of offering you're bringing because God isn't just pleased you know uh you know with just any kind of worship one well pleased just any kind of offering won't get ofrenda the Bible says that he looks for worship in spirit and when you have the truth but no still alive is that you can't tell me no more putting the seed lets you come go steady any and when the preacher ask see one little politically but I wonder how many love the Lord on to someone else in your sometimes I look around I wish was muted or sometimes people are sleeping yeah God doesn't look for worship for those that worship Him in spirit and in truth okay Lauren in spirit to embed of that so it matters how you worship God so it's important to come you say other adduce it matters what you offer God is important okay so adios but Cain loved God just as much as Abel there come on - come on come on in but what happens look at lo que canta say in closing in surrender is that unless you recognize a meniscus tear the Cornhusker or unless you real recognized a meniscus tear the Cornhusker we heard contending for the faith which I wanted in the portal affair right well ah now how many here has faith want this I keep anything right but everybody has faith doesn't Stav en so the my question is well then what are you waiting for entonces que esperan coz if you have faith that means that you're waiting for something you sit in a phase poor cast a spell on do algo right well that right you understand that that's simple right simply if I have faith I had faith that I was gonna see brother Ronnie tonight the faith didn't forget what a veteran running is right now that's no longer faith I see brother Ronnie so you know now I'm not waiting to see him anymore I I see him you know very you know well right so the greatest revelation that you can ever receive Mundek you snip we receive either the greatest revelation leatheran so much grande is the supreme deity of the Lord Jesus Christ is super no matter the data because they keep the crystal the supreme deity of who Jesus really is the supreme otherkin escazu so I recommend you that there's recommend to go back and hear the message yet recognition to you scooch in my sake our pastor preached in Phoenix there was no political feelings revelations of himself revelations of him sound soon as they an amusement the Bible says that God so loved the world that He gave himself he gave His only because you're not what for but okay so that he might bring life on again with red vida and life more abundantly what's happened yeah yep a song because we don't love ourselves you know no mames we've allowed the devil we've allowed the enemy to come in you can get you rob from he steals from us and knows Roma and we as people you know so those come hunting we we love to take care of our possessions with us we have a lot of possessions right well we take care of those possession of squid Olmos mucho I got this new I got the new car I got this new house got all this jewelry boy yes and we really take care of those possessions we come on a squid ammos but the greatest possession for Allah like what so much Glandon is the mind is lament the heart and anything that will cause you equal kill cosas que la causa to get out of whack yeah okay so luckily for your your mind to get out of control the semantics is upon whether they control your spirit the spirit do it should be aborted Livia saved itself whether it should be aborted a child of whether and in closing then I find out that there was two different kinds of life okay those different this tipos de vida some people try to think life is drinking which is okay vida a.m. tomorrow having a big time in a new on tiempo that's the spirit of this nation is still espíritu this time as soon big time somebody in a TV program when a mother television a lot of jokes to be cracked muchas muchas Roma's why that makes the real Christian Christian reality does it in thermo-firm oh we're talking about the new birth Thomas hablando de nuo gonna see bientôt right and for this cause many people are sick amongst us as we just read it and that makes the real Christians thicken a stomach awesome Christian impairment as we're standing to hear of such things fiscal judges and cause us um now here's a man or a woman who nombre una mujer wait for everybody settle in now a man or a woman home bro mujeres how many men how many women here
