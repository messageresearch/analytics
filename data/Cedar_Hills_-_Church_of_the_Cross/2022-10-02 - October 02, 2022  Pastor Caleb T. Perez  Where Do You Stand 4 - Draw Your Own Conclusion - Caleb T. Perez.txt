went with us we had a wonderful time we were able to say brother Titus there and a few of his people but it was uh we also of course brother Morton and his wife and his the Marcus and his first and uh one of their interpreters Brother David he was there also by that way quite a trip but uh life-changing uh in in different ways experiences on this trip I tell you what I I was as I was sitting there meditating Santa's experience I remember this and I remember that and he said my heart was overflowing just to remember all that God had done on this trip this would be number four on where do you stand with a subtitle draw your own conclusions might not be what you think it is but wait till the end you'll get it but we're glad to be home would you stand as we read God's word once again we live in a day and age where we must always know where we stand we must know how we stand if not no we'll slip and slide everywhere now we don't know what we're supposed to be doing or where we're supposed to be but we must know what we believe and why we believe what we say we believe you'll understand in a little bit so if we can be so kind if you can be so kind to to open your Bibles to the Book of Psalms salmos chapter 122 and verse 1 and 2. I don't know about you but the scripture reads like this I was glad he says I want you to turn to your neighbor and say neighbor I was glad are you glad see were you glad to come to church this morning you ask your neighbor neighbor were you glad to come this morning if you're just here just to pass the time and you're not glad we are here because we are glad I want to say I was glad when they said unto me well they said let us go into the house of the Lord verse 2 our feet shall stand within thy Gates o Jerusalem my goodness may God add His blessings to the written of his word you may be seated nobody's in a hurry this morning all right that's we're not in a hurry and and we'll well there won't be no evening service so so we'll just we'll just have a good time in the Lord all right amen amen I want to say once again that these last two weeks have been of great importance in my life there are moments there are events that Mark Our Lives they mark them in such a way that they become reference points to you in your life and points that you can refer back to anytime whenever you're going through the ups and downs of life God gave us the opportunity to go to Israel Israel and he gave us the opportunity to stand within the Gates of Jerusalem that's why I read the scripture where do you stand this morning where do we stand and it says I our feet shall stand within thy Gates o Jerusalem what a thing it is it was when we were able to stand in the Gates of Jerusalem and and this message is more along the lines of the different experiences that we had during this trip yesterday we'll we'll do another message next week and we'll add some more to the trip and and and so forth but but just a few things we we want to we want to hit and highlights there was something that the Lord was wanting to show me on this trip something of great significance significance I wasn't looking for some other religion religion hello everybody I wasn't I wasn't out there looking for some other message I wasn't looking for some kind of Enlightenment oh seriously you know there's people that travel around and they're they're looking for in light to be enlightened right the Gospel of Jesus Christ has already in life but I was looking for something that was a little deeper Within Myself anybody ever get to that point in life you feel like sometimes you're a little bit shallow in certain areas we feel a little shallow in certain areas there's some areas we feel like we maybe are are pretty deep but in all reality there's so much shallowness in our lives I was looking for something deeper not out there within myself foreign as if I knew nothing I purpose to go with my heart open we call me my ears ready to hear my eyes ready to see and where did I find myself standing in the Gates of Jerusalem I want to start off that before I I left the the night before I left I am grateful to God for a dream that he gave me and this is what kind of when I had set my mind to this uh this dream came and in the dream I found myself in a large house I did not recognize the house it was a it was a great a big great house I don't know and I remember feeling a joy in my heart that I had never felt before it wasn't a joy that came upon me it was the joy that came from inside of me something that was I I guess we could say a joy unspeakable and full of Glory it was like nothing that I had ever felt before I uh as I was in that dream walking through this house there was there was it's like I was on another level there was the depth of this joy that I I had never I had never encountered and I remember and I would remember walking through the house I couldn't contain myself I was whoa and I just couldn't control myself and and but but amidst all this Joy I mean um I knew there was something that was that was causing this Joy I knew Within Myself That the resurrection was on Resurrection I went to the front door and as I opened the door I see a few few people standing outside but my my sight went right to my mother and father she was she was looking up at him and it was like if they had just reunited and as I was watching them that Joy it was like I said on another level and it was I could feel as if the Lord was telling me remember this feeling remember this Joy because the next time you feel This Joy again and says there's a few things that are going to try to hinder you particles the Lord will take care of everything don't let it stop you well I knew that dream it was a confirmation there are deeper things in the world there are deeper things in us that have not yet been tapped that say neighbor there are deeper things in us that have not been tapped into yet that's what I'm after this morning there are those things and we must and we need to tap into them the hour is late the time that it's far spent but it's time now church that we tap into these things that we have never seen before it's about time that we find out well we got to the airport and and when we got to we flew to Dallas Dallas the next part of our trip was from Dallas to to Israel I was uh bumped out of my seat that man just when you want to get a little frustrated like I can't believe they did that to me nope I remember oh my God and I was okay they bumped me and I was sitting here with my wife and and uh and and my daughter Grace out there that somebody was sitting in my seat we gave you a seat the back of the plane like you couldn't bump me like right behind her number and so so anyways that's why I said can you bring me closer we only have two more seats available and one is about six rows behind her here on the other side of the place no I I I get to my seat and there's a man sitting in and I realized well I'm in the middle I don't like being in the middle seat in the plane I'm sitting there in the middle talking to and I see this man how are you doing of course before we got in man there was I don't know 60 70 80 I don't know of Jewish men that were that were praying on our flight so once we got in they were all coming in and um next to him and I knew he was a Jew noise I'm from New Jersey I'm a I'm a Jew I'm going back to Israel I'm I'm I want to you know I'm gonna go for a certain whatever reason and feast he was going for so yeah nice too nice to meet you I sit down I'm waiting to see all this there it's full of of these Jewish men yeah a rabbi sits next to me over here I said I'm gonna have fun yeah thank you Lord I know it's ten and a half hours without my wife but that's okay awesome I mean I was I was a Theo I was licking my job imagine as he sat down so he was an older gentleman probably in his 80s how do you do sir fine and I said and you are I said I am rabbis I forget what his name was he says you know what a rabbi is well I was going to act like I knew nothing about nothing you know what a rabbi is I said well tell me he goes well a rabbi is one that's in charge of a synagogue and all these men you're the teacher yes I'm the I'm the rabbi I teach all these men he was the main one okay now okay this is this is gonna be nice I sat there and and uh and uh they all sat down we took off and you know I have a question for you he couldn't speak very good good he couldn't speak very good English struggling to talk with me but the other Gentleman on this side where he could speak good English they were back and forth talking about me back and forth [Music] this guy has questions I mean I could almost say well yeah you're asking him about me and you're telling him to go ahead and answer them because you don't feel like answering them I have a question for both of you tell me about the red heifer why mess around tell me about the red hair somebody had had just shocked them they looked at each other I mean I don't I said well you're not you're not a Jew why would you care about the red heifers of all the questions you could ask me you're asking me about the red heifers yeah you know I kind of picked my interest you know you want to hear it from your mouth you know what what you have to say about it I said because you know I I'm sure I mean it's a type of of the Messiah right it was the wrong thing to say no make a noise yes and I said oh well tell me what it has to do here I am and I'm and I'm talking to him and they began to explain it to me about the red heifers brother Abraham had just spoke about a few weeks I was like yeah I've heard that already and anyways as as it got on the conversation it began to uh the the gentleman he was doing more of the talking because the this the rabbi had finally fallen asleep and so so uh is he was expressing this he said you know the Temple Mount El Monte got into that part of it he says you know we could take the Temple Mount right now I mean he was adamant about are you aware of that is I remember in all this I am open to what the Lord is trying to tell him whoever he wants to use to talk to me I'm open I'm listening and he says we could take it right now you know why we don't tell me he said because we will not get ahead of God's program I said wow I like that you see Messiah must come first once we know he's here we'll build the temple just like that take it over right I said my goodness that's that's something he says he says but but but I want to tell you don't try to get converted into the judaic or judaic religion don't do it you're not coming to Israel to get converted are you and I said no no I don't think so no I think I'm okay and and anyways as the conversation went on he says uh uh I said you all don't believe don't don't the the New Testament to you no we we don't study the New Testament you don't really care about what Saint Paul had to say and this is just a man no no he's nothing to us and what about Jesus no he's just a man it's the man that everybody's trying to make God so you only believe your prophets whoever if you read this if anybody reads this message everything I'm telling him is in the message I'm not trying to create something different I'm telling him exactly what our Prophet brought and I said so so you only believe your prophets right and I said Isaiah is one of your prophets yeah he sure is and I said so answer me this question Isaiah 53. he was wounded for our transgress he was bruised foreign Orlando I wanted to get right down to it he just looked at me and says I don't know and I said but I do he said no no your Isaiah is different from our Isaiah and I said wow he said you see ours is written in Hebrew and the translation is not exactly I said well I'll tell you this is a change I said then you answer me this question is what relationship will he have to God I was asking him all the questions yes he says he'll be the messenger of God he will be God El serradios When I See This I understand as you talk with them struggle that that the Apostle Paul had to get these Jews to understand and see to see the Covenant of Grace don't ever become a Jew or or or come into Judaism he says there's 800 laws that we have to abide by every day wow 800. he said yeah there's 800 laws he said it takes years and years to to memorize them all I said well I said I'm not here for that he says well I can see that uh I'm not going to convince you of anything you're not going to convince me of anything so we'll just leave it like that and not debate about it he said really you asked too many questions he was so perturbed at that point I said sir I'm sorry I don't need to ask so many questions but I appreciate your time that you that you gave me in the answers I appreciate it and and as we as we as you go on and you're and you're talking with them you see that blindness not full blindness no nothing against complexity you can't just look and say oh what do you think about the Jews that's all you think about the Jews you're missing it by a million miles still the people of God I told them I said I believe that you all are the people of God but as you're talking to them they are so sure 3500 years later after Moses came they are still standing strong with the mosaic laws and not so-called Believers 57 years after our Prophet passes away we're not sure if he was even a propheter if we even believe the message 3500 years later they're still believing money why does that show us what is that telling us this morning that many times our religion is too shallows we have a shallow religion whenever we feel like it hello everybody let me tell you a little bit about them it's serious to them middle of the flight 80 of them it was time to pray they do not care who's watching them they don't care what anybody thinks about it it's time to pray they wrap their things around their arms they put this thing on their heads they put their caps on they have their curl things that go down the stewardess you you got to you gotta move out of the way I need to do my job but you get us today that supposedly the Bride of Jesus Christ to tell somebody what Jesus Christ who he is and what he has done what's wrong it was a wonderful trip and now and that was just the first day yes back of anxiety yeah I realized when you look at them how undisciplined we are getting falta is I'm going to say it again I don't have to look at anybody else and I felt embarrassed I don't know how else to say I felt it is I said Lord they have only the Old Testament they stand for their people they're not over there about their the other sister the brother that they disagree with him you're in the airport they go down the line are you an Israeli citizens go down your Israelis come with me thank God they take care of their own I'm not what lessons I learned they don't sit there and talk did you know according to to to to the Hebrew Bible that the sin of Gossip El pecado Del chisme is equal to is out of murder is go back and look at it it's the same to them and the person that laughs at the one saying it is guilty as the one saying it is me and us in the same church that's the greatest message can't stand one another I think we got a lot of growing they when Shabbat comes that's the Sabbath this is everything stops it's their rest that they're looking for all because now we understand the the real rest what it is today take away how disciplined they are notice I I wasn't going to try to say oh this is where they're wrong I wasn't going on the trip for that they do not do nothing not even go up an elevator work to press the button about their God you know we were talking me and sister Marie yesterday sister Marie and we're talking about you remember how so many times when the old days first we were young and and uh you know nobody went to the store on Sundays how many remember those times nobody went to the store on Sunday it was the day you give to God six days you can labor six days you can go to the store and buy your mandal compressed Sunday El Domingo for the things of God I want to tell you how these these men okay Sunday El Domingo did not start Sunday morning when you got up Sunday started at 5 p.m on Saturday evening and all Saturday evening you were already in Sunday you are already reverancing and giving God worship and doing all that that you felt you needed to do where are those days anymore we're out on Saturday night movies instead of preparing ourselves the Bible says that the evening and the morning were the first days hello everybody discipline discipline their children are not outs those young people are not out not the Italian salad they're all home they believe Moses are you with me yes Uncle amigo oh we're barely getting going good this morning and I see these things I say Lord I'm embarrassed as a pastor Como Pastor I am embarrassed then we try to tell someone how we should be hello and we're labeled legalists is thank you we're extremists we're not under the law let me tell you Grace is much more disciplined than them but because we have made Grace a disgrace what a message last Sunday not give God his worship yo Mama we have a shallow relationship I bought a book in Israel called listening to the language of the Bible Understanding the Hebrew language I read it and I said wow I'm done with it I said wow our modern Western culture we're always trying to and brother Brown tells us we're trying to understand an Eastern book with a western mentality Occidental and we think we're hot stuff I think that we got it down I'm talking about myself you know what that means let me explain these things to you when we as a western culture we always tend to focus on the mental activity everything is a mental activity now now now listen closely to this we always stress the intellectual part of everything we stress the intellectual part of hearing but we minimize the part of doing Jesus said there to be not be not just hearers of the word of the word and when we speak in our language in the Eastern in the English tongue is we use the verb to know and we think of it as our mental grasp of facts now listen closely okay you got to get these things right here we got to know this watch this now we once again we think that the more facts we know about something the more we know about the subject yes or yes I heard that already what are you doing about it once again we think the more facts we know the more we know about the subject but in the Hebrew word the word is yada which means to know but rather than just knowing information the Hebrew idea of yada is it stresses knowing from experience and relationships on that knowledge in other words they take it and they see it one word as the whole process we look at one word to no means that I've I I have heard I've listened and I have accumulated facts about that subject to know to them is their experience their relationship with God that's why it's so important to them that's why they are so disciplined now listen to this this is where we learn about the Bible concept of the knowledge of God we as westerners we think that this means to prove God's existence and establish is theological model of how to explain God um but to the Hebrews their knowledge or view of the knowledge of God is having a life in relationship with him so to the Hebrews knowledge is not just knowing who someone is it is your Devotion to them my goodness I am the Jews seen the knowledge of God has intimacy with God not let me explain to you so many times they would say that I can't get you to see that I won't even tell you not the way you're not going to understand this is we think differently than you are we see the whole process that's why Johnny when he's writing in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God the word was made flesh the whole genealogy of the world Larry word logos is the whole process the mind of God all the way down he became flesh and then he ascended back on time it's the whole processo do we know a lot of facts about God or do we really know him personally what's your knowledge of God do we know him by Nature by his character or character by his mind or simply because somebody told us about him why am I oh are you still with me on you how deep or how shallow is our relationship with God Ephesians 4 tells us he gave some Apostles and so forth but when you get down to the 13th verse till we all come in the unity of the faith this is where we should be standing till we come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God but relationships hello everybody hola todos unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ here's the knowledge of the Son of God says Jesus on the authority of the word Jesus Christianity and the way they have it today is so shallowed no wonder the unbeliever can hardly see how to believe Christianity but Christianity is real in its power Christianity it's not just another ceremony but Christianity or church this is what should excite us this morning but Christianity is a living being in mankind that's the proof of the Resurrection who was God With Us watch watch how the Lord began to show these things on this trip I have to try to to take on some other religion and their forms and their Traditions I will try to be like some other people it's to recognize now that we're not as deep in our relationship as we think he goes on he says I tell you friends there's been many a man and is tonight that's coming down to the end of the road and they'll find out that that little shallow religion that you're holding on it won't work come on now how many are holding on to a little shallow religion go to church not that you do that what's your relationship during the week he says nothing short of being born again will work he said you see it's not a shallow Affair superficial something deep we're not babies anymore we're men and women church should be in that condition tonight oh I want you to ask yourself that question a shallow or am I deep be honest with yourself most all of Christianity in the way we see it today brother Ram says I have no idea what bubble dancing but it's like bubble dancing we find out what bubble dancing is you let me know bubble dances bubble dance want to see if you don't then you could tell us what it is I've said this before there's a there was a study made at MIT um as to whether or not a person can multitask yes the results were that it's impossible for a person to multitask in-depth mode at the moment you begin to do more than one thing your brain goes into shallow mode not be in depth mode dealing with two or more things no wonder the scripture says you cannot serve God and Mammon foreign buyers stand in nosotos where I can get this across I was standing somewhere it makes a great state and that statement is that I left the path is [Music] I'm upstairs I left the path they came down from the top you have to pass down the aisle of how to get it a path was left to get there I don't know how many you remember years some years ago brother Ben preached a tremendous message on that every place that you you put your soul I have given unto you Jose Jose amen and always remember that wherever we go we live an imprint man I'm gonna say it again we leave an imprint for someone you walk into a bar you stand you're leaving the soul the imprint of your soul of your foot there somebody will fall go to the movies every week worn out path to the movies come on hello everybody we've worn a path to such places and they have become rats in the road anybody everybody's been on a rut right I understand whether it's wet or dry and you're trying to drive then you try to get off of the rut get off get out and then on the wrong and then you'll get back into this yeah but he made the run that was came before you yes and you're trapped in that run that's a lot of Christians it's time to get out of these ruts have you ever stopped to think everywhere the soles of your feet I'm sure we're not proud of

was actually a really nice guy because I'm sitting behind him he's he starts talking about I don't know this bowl water bowl smoke thing that he uses and he's like what is it called like if I knew hello you know you smoke it and I said I don't know we don't we don't smoke around you don't smoke and I said that's a strange question you just asked me we should be asking you you smoke he got a he

grandmother smoked a lot I know because I never mind foreign he's picking me that's a horror I'm gonna have to think about that I'm serious I said and I'll make a challenge we'll get off this bus I said I'll pray for you and I said and I know you're saying because the worshiper wants perfect no more desires I didn't go just to be on vacation I said I challenge you you want to be made free yeah I said we'll pray for you you better give your heart to the Lord pray for him he's in the valley is you look at this thing and I we get to Spain there the owner of the of the lodge a man and his wife he had left and she she was you talk about a devout Catholic she goes to Israel every year with her priests they're real they're real real Catholics into the Holy Church of the Holy Sepulcher they get to stay inside lock the door all night long prayer Santos but on one day we're sitting there for dinner there's a man sitting next to me she comes and says hey move like Matt you can tell who the boss is here see here she sits down cute questions I want to ask you some questions I'm like oh your priests don't do this okay I felt sad I said what Footprints are they okay they're trying to draw conclusions in their life if something's right or wrong but they're following the wrong footsteps Las Vegas I said I believed we're at the end she said but everything that's happening has happened before it's it's history repeats I said yeah it repeats itself I said but there's a difference now that right before his coming promised to send it prophet he sent him to get a people prepared oh I've never heard of this I've never heard of this man I'm here to tell you I'll tell you about him do you want to know more about it talk to her for a little while at the end she just said I just never have heard these things yes I said Lord we're planting seeds I don't know who is your elect and who's not you know but Lord I'll tell them the truth I'll tell them what you have given us you'll do the rest lord well our driver was it 24 21 year old young man um he's listening to us on the table he's like El Camino you talk about going back and forth in him I I I saw him and I and I my heart yearned for his soul didn't know anything else doesn't know anything else about it that's all he knows comes from generation upon generation of Catholics he says I believe that God is love and that he will not send anyone to hell he knows we all make mistakes I said I believe he made a way love provided a savior he says but but he will not send anyone to him he knows we're just human yes he says well you think people are going to go to hell just like you right now you're given the opportunity I don't know I said do you read the Bible well yeah but I don't know I said the Bible says enter ye in at the Straight Gate for why does the Gayden brought us the way that leadeth to destruction many there be that will find it will go there at I said but straight is the gate and narrow is the way that leads to life and few there be that we'll find it gave him the Plan of Redemption by the time we got there his eyes were watery I don't know mad because but he was just like I never heard these things and I said but you have now here's my foreign and I see how there are so many footprints that have been made through time he allowed me to speak to a devout Jew a rabbi two Catholics what was I doing showing them yes young people you all have no excuse you've been shown the footprints for by his own blood Jesus entered once into the holy of into the holy place what does the enemy try to do he tries to cover up the tracks it tries to cover up the footprints we have seen that time and time again that's why every generation foreign because the winds and the storms have covered up many foots but when you go and you put your foot again freshens up the footprint or someone that's coming what we didn't know brother Tommy no but the footprint has made been made fresh again there are people that continue to walk continue to put their Footprints same place they are fresh this morning again put your foot down show where you're standing one of my desires was to go to the Eastern Gate the Bible says that when Jesus came into Jerusalem this is Matthew 21 10. he come into Jerusalem yes he said the only way he could come into Jerusalem to have left his Footprints away Mount of Olives all the way to Jerusalem he left his Footprints and all the city was moved think of it come on put on your spiritual Cap all the sitting was moved they thought they knew where they were standing when he enters in the gates where you think you're standing Jesus walks into this notice this now he was coming into Jerusalem through the Eastern Gate Ezekiel 44 1-2 if you would por favor and it says then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward Sanctuary took it toward the East and it was then said the Lord unto me this gate shall be shut up it shall not be opened and no man shall enter in by it because the Lord the god of Israel Israel have entered in by it therefore it shall be shut oh my goodness wait till them rabbis realize who it was he's just a man and they try to make him God your Prophet Ezekiel said the Lord the god of Israel has entered when did he enter in when Messiah came walking oh Church come on come with me this morning and while all the other Gates had hats there were so many people around it I was telling my uncle Abraham you talk about scripture when you see it being that it has been fulfilled that the city of of of of Jerusalem the old city has been cut into four parts the Gentiles have overrun it Los gentiles one part the second part the Armenians those Armenians the third part fourth part it's the Jewish quarter there's four parts tremendous when you see this you can feel the difference of the spirit whenever you go in this is where the Muslim quarter starts here's where the Christians amazing the Bible says here that it after the Lord God he hath entered in by it see all the other Gates but the Eastern Gate is put on a picture of that um you see it okay I walked out of the Lion's gate the first thing I see is I remember I preached this message how that the Muslims they have put a cemetery right in front of the East again of this of these of these tombs who did that Solomon remember the ottoman yeah he says let's keep Messiah out so so they put the the the cemetery in front why because the priest cannot go in through wow the law says a priest cannot go in through it through a cemetery the Forerunner can't go through a cemetery he can't go to the cemetery and then no Forerunner comes then Messiah can't come and then we have nothing to fear the cemetery and this is right that's 16 feet of concrete and to be able to see it is just it did something for me there was nobody there but us and we began to sing I will meet you in the morning just inside the Eastern Gate so be ready faithful pilgrim or you'll not have long to wait oh you could feel the presence of the Lord start to move and then all of a sudden Brother Carlos puts on a tape and he said hope you say by God's grace no no no hope his wife hope by God's grace on that morning you stand right over there by the side of that Eastern Gate and when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob economies you'll go to screaming bills just as loud as you can we'll have the children I'll meet you there she said I'll be waiting for you to hear the sound the voice of the Prophet right outside of the city of Jerusalem and then we put another one on he says Judah guards the Eastern Gate and Christ is the lion of the tribe of Judah until Messiah comes something was drawn stand within the Gates of Jerusalem Church the path has been carved out the imprint has been made let's keep making these Footprints fresh yes the way seems long we're the opposition strong you can turn the lights on but there's a way that has been provided believe me church tell me listen closely I know it's been long and hard but the pain will pass the sweat will drive the tiredness will end but there's something that will never disappear that is the satisfaction of knowing that we kept The Voice foreign to come to a conclusion simply means that you've come to the end or the Finish of an event or processo how many have come to a conclusion how many have concluded that what we follow is nothing but the truth is I spoke to them Church Hermanos I've seen the footprints they followed there ain't nothing like the footprints that have been left by Yeshua I'm going to say it again there's nothing that has been left like the bloody Footprints of Jehovah Las Vegas each one of them that I spoke to have had come to a conclusion in their life but I pray once again that a seed was planted brother Branham says message blind Bartimaeus I'm in a corner now but what are you doing well my pastor says it's not true hypnotism you're a fanatic the pastor says that it's of the devil but what are you doing you're basing your conclusion on their decisions closely this is important now this is the this is we're coming to the end of the message why are we shallow because we've based our conclusions on someone else's decision and that is well my mom and dad say that's where the truth so I get you're basing it on their decisions you got to make a decision on your own I will get scared of the Lord he's given me all that I need to base it upon the not even the pastor's decision you've got to have your own decisions make your own decisions watch how brother Branham hits this please based it on someone else's decision there's no conclusion without first making a decision but when you fly loose and you jump to every conclusion you haven't got Bible Temperance yet but God's program the program was for the Holy Ghost to run the church the Holy Ghost was given for the church impersonation of Christianity and we can't have two faculties running the church at the same time if man runs the church the holy ghost is out when Holy Ghost runs it then usually man goes out one or the others to this conclusion that God intends the Holy Spirit to run the church oh now I don't mean just the spirit gets up and preaches because the holy spirit sets the people in the church or a certain things and then the footprints become visible right I can't see I don't know where to walk because you haven't made your decisions you're a little too shallow still is I'm getting to something now I'm finishing up and if we will just draw from this conclusion says this is the conclusion and if we will just draw from this conclusion this morning we don't just come up with our own conclusions not just like that because then it's just based on our opinion but we must draw from this conclusion after we have made our decisions goes on to say that this day this word has been fulfilled in your ears now we want to draw from that when the word has been fulfilled in your ears a conclusion of how Dynamic is the word of God we all can figure out the mechanics but it takes the Dynamics to make it works let me hear one depth in their life get into the spirit get into Christ hello everybody he said now there's a third pool coming just a sign of the answer there's a third pool coming but don't try to explain it you see how I approach this tonight he approached it and he left Footprints see how I approached it I don't know no saying but I feel Duty bound to my church to say something you draw your own conclusions will this be the mystery that would open up that would bring Christ bring a power to the church we believe in Repentance we believe in baptizing in the name of Jesus Christ we believe in receiving the Holy Ghost signs and wonders Miracles speaking in tongues but the war has been done right here is written in the book of Acts one little group of people and this little bitty Ministry of ours what about the world over more than his Road in the book of Acts there was only three people raised raised of the Dead by Jesus Christ we have on record Jesus doctors record five this is the third pool there is a great ministry lying ahead saying draw your own conclusion the question is where are you drawing it from me well I read and I I'm drawing let's go a little further it's your obligation to get the word inside processes inside Universe hello everybody your own conclusions draw your own end sake what will our end be okay what is your end I am a son or daughter of God what's your conclusion is deep calling to the Deep yes deep calling there's got to be a deep tourists come on church I want you to get this now and I'm done now yeah the only way for us to make the right decisions in order to come up with the right conclusions the seals were then opened up and there it showed us who we are in the word draw or finish your own end yeah that takes depth foreign that was before thee is the gift of God and who it is that says to thee give me to drink and he would have given the Living Water the woman saith unto him thou has nothing to draw Carla and this well yes the Apostle not just Jacob's well but out of his belly shall flow Rivers this swell yes [Music] no one has ever been able to get down into the depths of this world what are you looking for they're waiting for messiah already came yes we know what did he come to do to take what was in the depth of your heart begin to draw out for the foundation of the world time for those things to come out [Music] but when the well is deep come on church when the well is deep and you put it down if you knew the gift is you would ask me how can you draw from something shallow I can only withdraw from something something deep how was Jesus going to draw come on Jesus he said if I be lifted up this is me draw from the depthundo your conclusion your end to feel for we are the end that has been born one thing I have found and I end with this one thing that I have found in my years and my travels and Las Vegas history church is not as bad as you may think your life is as bad as you think your life is foreign but brother you don't know what I've been through what I'm going through there are
