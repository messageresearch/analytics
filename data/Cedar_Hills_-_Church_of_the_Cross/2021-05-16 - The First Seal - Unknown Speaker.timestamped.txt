[0:00] and tonight we're starting on the sixth
[0:02] chapter of revelation
[0:05] now as we study at this chapter
[0:08] we're referring different places even to
[0:10] old and new testament
[0:12] alike because the entire book
[0:15] is the revelation of jesus christ that's
[0:18] all together the revelation
[0:20] of the lord jesus the revelation of
[0:23] jesus christ
[0:24] it's god revealing himself
[0:28] in the book revealing himself through
[0:31] christ
[0:32] in the book and christ is the revelation
[0:35] of god
[0:36] he come to reveal god because he
[0:39] and god were the same god was in christ
[0:43] reconciling the world to himself you see
[0:46] the book actually was planned
[0:50] and written before the foundation of the
[0:54] world
[0:54] amen this book the
[0:58] bible was really
[1:01] written before the foundation of the
[1:02] world and christ
[1:04] being the lamb was slain before the
[1:07] foundation of the world
[1:08] and the members of his bride
[1:12] their names were put in the lamb's book
[1:15] of life
[1:16] before the foundational world but it's
[1:19] been
[1:20] sealed up and now
[1:24] it's being revealed whose names were in
[1:27] there
[1:28] all about it what a great thing and
[1:32] there about 12 o'clock in the date the
[1:35] holy spirit just swept right down
[1:36] into the room and the whole thing is
[1:38] opened up to me
[1:42] so of this of this first seal being over
[1:46] i'm as positive as i'm standing here
[1:49] tonight
[1:50] as this is the gospel truth that i am
[1:56] now we find the lamb with the book now
[2:00] and now in the sixth chapter we read
[2:04] and i saw when the lamb opened one of
[2:07] the seals and i
[2:09] heard as it were the noise of a thunder
[2:12] and one of the four beasts saying
[2:16] come and see and i saw him behold a
[2:19] white horse
[2:20] and he set on him had a bull and a crown
[2:24] was given
[2:24] unto him and he went forth conquering
[2:27] and to conquer but it isn't this kind of
[2:31] a book
[2:32] it's a scroll and then when the scroll
[2:35] is unwound
[2:36] that's one that land right in the scroll
[2:38] is number two
[2:39] and right here says what it is but it's
[2:42] a mystery
[2:43] so a revelation is something that's made
[2:47] known of something something that's been
[2:50] revealed
[2:51] and now notice so you won't forget it
[2:56] it is closed up until
[2:59] the latter time
[3:04] the whole mystery of it is closed up
[3:07] until the latter times we find that in
[3:10] the scripture here
[3:11] now the mystery of the book are revealed
[3:15] when the seals are broken and when the
[3:18] seals completely are broken the
[3:21] time of redemption is over because the
[3:24] land
[3:24] left the intercession boat to walk out
[3:27] to take his claim
[3:29] he was a mediator between that but when
[3:31] the
[3:32] real revelation happens on the seals
[3:35] as they begin to break the lamb is
[3:38] coming
[3:38] forth from the sanctuary now he said
[3:41] there is a
[3:42] white horse rider but what the mystery
[3:46] of it is there's a mystery that goes
[3:47] with that rider
[3:49] now what it was they didn't know but
[3:51] it's to be revealed
[3:53] and i saw when the lamb
[3:56] opened one of the sea wonder what their
[4:00] thunder was
[4:01] saint john 12 chapters and just hoarded
[4:05] saint john the 12th chancellor was
[4:08] thunder remember a loud
[4:11] laughing noise of asunder is the voice
[4:14] of god
[4:15] the first seal when it was opened
[4:19] in the symbol form is thundered
[4:22] now what about my openness reality bomb
[4:27] as soon as the lamb cut back the seal
[4:30] and what did it reveal not all of itself
[4:33] burst it to the god yes that's it
[4:36] assembled
[4:36] then it's revealed three things and only
[4:39] is to be revealed at the last day when
[4:42] this
[4:42] actual seal is broken
[4:45] broken the who not the christ but in the
[4:47] church
[4:48] oh my that just makes me tremble
[4:52] i wanna thunderclap go down john my
[4:55] jumped up in the air on a thunder roar
[4:58] and then one of the four beasts said
[5:00] now come and see what it is what's
[5:03] reveal beneath here
[5:05] [Music]
[5:08] john wright what you see so john goes
[5:12] to see what it was john goes to see
[5:15] what the thunder said it's then that
[5:18] this creature
[5:20] told john hum and see what the mystery
[5:24] is under the first seal the
[5:27] thunder the voice of the creator has
[5:30] uttered it
[5:30] now what does this white horse mean
[5:34] and he that set on him had a bowl
[5:37] and a crown was given him he didn't have
[5:40] it then
[5:42] unto him and he went forth conquering at
[5:45] the conqueror now what does a white
[5:46] horse mean
[5:47] now here's where the revelation comes
[5:50] but
[5:51] my revelation by the holy spirit
[5:54] is not that way my revelation by the
[5:57] holy spirit
[5:57] is christ and the holy spirit is the
[6:02] self-sane only person
[6:05] a different form so here stands christ
[6:09] the lamb we know he was the lamb he's
[6:11] standing here at the books his hand and
[6:12] there towards the white horse rider
[6:14] so it wasn't the holy spirit and so
[6:18] how could christ be out there the white
[6:20] horse conquering and standing here with
[6:21] a book in his hand
[6:23] it isn't though it isn't christ notice
[6:28] now the holy spirit in the revelation
[6:31] and christ is the holy spirit is christ
[6:35] in another form
[6:36] right notice it is the lamb
[6:40] that opens the books and the lamb is
[6:44] christ
[6:45] and christ is not seen
[6:48] anymore from that
[6:52] but he is seen in the book of
[6:54] revelations the 19th
[6:56] chapter coming on a white horse
[6:59] and he that set on him was called
[7:01] faithful true
[7:03] righteousness does he judge and make
[7:05] walk his eyes were flames of bob
[7:08] and all his head was many crown look at
[7:11] him died him
[7:12] and he had a name written that no man
[7:15] knows but himself
[7:17] i noticed no man nobody said
[7:21] and he was clothed with the bastard
[7:23] dipped in blood
[7:24] and his name was called the word of god
[7:27] notice and the armies which were in
[7:30] heaven
[7:31] followed him upon white horses clothed
[7:33] in fine linen
[7:34] white and clean and out of his mouth
[7:36] goes a sharp sword
[7:38] that with it he should smite the nations
[7:42] and he shall rule them with a rod of
[7:44] iron
[7:45] and he tread the winepress of the
[7:47] fiercest the wrath of almighty god
[7:50] and he had on his gestures and on his
[7:53] thigh a name written king of kings and
[7:56] lord of lords
[7:58] there comes the messiah there he is
[8:02] nothing still on this horse back here
[8:04] notice
[8:06] the rider on the white horse don't have
[8:08] any name
[8:10] you might use two of three titles
[8:14] but he hasn't got any name but christ
[8:17] has a name
[8:19] what is it the word of god
[8:22] in the beginning was the word the word
[8:23] is with god and the word was god
[8:26] the word made flesh the writer has no
[8:30] name
[8:31] but christ is called the word of god
[8:34] who is this mysterious writer of the
[8:37] first church agent
[8:39] you only tell you who he is he's the
[8:40] antichrist
[8:42] exactly what he is now because you see
[8:47] if an antichrist jesus said that the two
[8:50] would be so close together and so it
[8:52] would deceive the very
[8:54] elected the bride
[8:57] antichrist it's the antichrist spirit
[9:00] glory amen notice i am in this
[9:04] holy spirit that we have becomes
[9:07] incarnate to us
[9:08] the one that's in our midst now the form
[9:10] of the holy ghost becomes incarnate to
[9:13] us
[9:13] in the person of jesus christ
[9:22] what are we saying who is this rider
[9:25] this horse rider you know what it is
[9:27] it's satan's super educated
[9:30] this is a satan superman with education
[9:33] with wisdom with church theology
[9:36] of his own word of his own nation and he
[9:39] rides his white denominational horse
[9:42] to deceive the people and the antichrist
[9:45] takes it all
[9:46] and the bible says that he deceived paul
[9:51] ain't allowed all upon the base of the
[9:54] earth whose names were upright
[9:58] [Music]
[10:01] now notice he'll conquer and
[10:05] almost happen in his script right now
[10:07] while he's still antichrist before he
[10:09] can become
[10:09] peace there'll be one thing you can
[10:11] conquer those that's got their names
[10:13] written in the land book of life
[10:14] from the foundation of the world i
[10:17] notice
[10:18] and the same time this is going on
[10:21] just before this takes place rather on
[10:23] the earth
[10:24] god has promised while all that scruples
[10:28] of denominations
[10:29] argue their difference about their creed
[10:32] god
[10:33] promised that he would send us a true
[10:36] prophet
[10:36] of the true word with a message to
[10:40] return
[10:40] to the original word of god and the
[10:43] faith of the fathers
[10:44] to bring down the power of the holy
[10:46] ghost amongst the people with a power
[10:48] that will razor above these things and
[10:50] take her in don't forget it friends
