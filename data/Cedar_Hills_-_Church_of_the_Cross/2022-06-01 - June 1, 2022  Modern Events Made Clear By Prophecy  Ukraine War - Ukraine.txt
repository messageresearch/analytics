know russia was the biggest nation out of all nations it is bigger than the the planet pluto esta grande este pais this country is so big with two limits with two continents and i was searching and of the world lord in this hour we'd like to give you thanks we are here as children lord hungry and and thirsty for righteousness lord in the name of our lord jesus christ shall i'd like to ask a question to our brother abraham emel we've read the scripture what could you tell us of the scripture that with something that that would be happening today well i mean our our subject that we're talking about is the ukraine ukraine as you see different um different different things you can go just about anywhere any direction as i look at it you you have to look it is is what the when brother branham talks about the three curtains cortinas i won't get into the other ones but when he talks about the iron curtain not a lot of information that he gives about that other than to watch what i see there is is it's a sign it's it's just like to me it's just like a road sign traveling down the road you have a yellow caution sign telling you there's a turn up ahead of caution so when i look at that um just speaking of the signs there's there's three things a godly sign was given for us another one was to execute divine judgment the second is and the last one was to he's the one who died for our sins crucified for murder for everything that was paid there thinking of the side of these signs you see that the prophet of god he he uh he refers to that in in the story of titus and so i want to talk about that for just a couple of minutes um as as just to so so you you see a lot of you you hear a lot of the story historian stories told of of jesus and we understand that that the jews rejected the god-given sign and that was given to them so when you see that you don't ever hear the the divine uh judgment that came with that he speaks of that prophet he refers it to titus roman emperor romano like the way that titus what he did was he he surrounded jerusalem and when he surrounded jerusalem it wasn't like a battle like you're thinking in your mind what titus did look at those it was so during this time when when titus surrounded surrounded jerusalem jerusalem he waited for for the the passover it was a big celebration a jewish celebration where there were there were uh all the jews from all that all in all the parts of that world they all gathered together and that was you see how how they all when they all got there is when titus surrounded the city the way that titus did it was he blocked off every gate that was coming in and going out there there was no escape so when he did this you know in in your mind you start thinking of a battle the way that titus did this was he would send in armies at different times make them believe that they were under full attack all the time but what he he did was he he was striking fear into them so the thing that happened was a great famine broke out he lost it was it was a trap that he had set for them and they said outside of the city making jerusalem think that they were under under heavy attack all the time things like that that brother jerry talked about the famine and he was talking about the difference between a famine and starvation during this time when this was going josephus is the one who gives this report of what really took place josephus it got so bad for them that they began to eat the bark off of the trees they began to kill their very own children and they ate they were eating their own children so you see the mental state that they were in venezuela and then so when josephus gives the report when joseph is reported he says yes a lot of them died through battle he says but the majority of them died from the famine so you you see you see everything that happened there and and you you see how ukraine used it they were surrounded the same way devastated and all of that but the most beautiful thing here that i look at me dad because it all sounds like pure devastation he begins to talk about about that great trap the battle that took place there and he begins to tell the people not and jesus starts to tell them jesus you know you you could discern the face of the sky whether in this arena but you can't discern the times he said and and he starts to to call him hypocrites and he says you know this wicked and adulterous generation but when he's talking about that he says but the there's one true sign that is going to be given and that sign is is the jonas sign he is i'll leave you with the with the sign of jonas and he says and if the reason it was given it was to get the bride ready it wasn't given for those that were seeking any signs and that it becomes like a warning from god testimonials so when the the whole thing about it is is that the sign is not just a sign that vindicates you see like like i mean i could go on forever you guys want to jump in you see like in the times of moses the whole thing about it is this is that is that what was the sign given for you know god gave a sign for one purpose and that purpose was to get the attention of the people so in in the times of moses and i'm going to wrap it up with this so in the times of moses the first sign that god gave him deliver the people pueblo and and uh they they they go and they throw down a serpent if you look at it they're able to produce the same signs you got to look at what the difference was at the end of at the end of the of the they were producing a sign the profit of the of that time he produced that that they produced what did they have that backed it up maybe i'm not i'm not saying it just the way that the prophet says it forgive me it was a worldly spirit this sign the difference was was that moses had thus saith the lord all the difference in the world what happened was he took the sign and he he made it speak he's okay so you see that like the thing that attracts he gets the attention of the people okay their attention through a sign right what got his attention what got his attention was the burning bush okay but the prophet of god tells us that what produced the voice the approach that moses had but that's what i got just look to [Music] that has a voice we can see how russia decision they took the decision to enter into danburys when russia takes the step immediately is we've read here of of hunger pestilence wars and rumors of ours now we've heard that there was a sign there had to be a voice and it had to be scriptural a voice a scripture that clears up what is happening in ukraine well first of all the i believe the sign is the prophet so we gotta we gotta start there so we have machine guns ready to go and as we know brother abe was was talking about the current that he was talking about we know is russia the prophet tells us about that but you know we you know not to jump on the bandwagon of many politicians but [Music] a lot of the information that we see is false news you know information you know through the guidance of our pastor i was able to to watch some videos today on believers that were in in ukraine ukrainian and it painted a wholly totally different picture than what i had imagined you know as as both me and brother diego were in the military as knowing how these wars and and or these conflicts so there were so many red flags that came up on what the news is trying to paint us you know because when when a military force wants to do something we don't read it on the news until it's over you know they they go and take care of business and a couple of days later we realized oh shoot that happened bum yeah you know i believe that putin knew exactly what he was doing he wanted the world to know before he even stepped foot in ukraine he wanted everybody to know look at me this is what i'm about to do the smoke was in the air and i believe with all my heart that the scripture was beautiful is being fulfilled in our midst i believe that the true movement isn't happening in russia right now because brother branham tells us in the late you'll see in church you know so we know there's a because of the the voice of the prophet the warning that he gave us we know there are so many other things that are taking place you know when the god in in god of the evil age he says amen so reads the word now my text this morning is this message points out the evil of this age and it is fitting to prophecy for this evil age and he says it's my belief that every that the bible has the answer for every age it's already written in the bible just for the believer of that age so what the prophet of god is trying to tell us to search the scriptures because you a lot of times we search the message we search the scriptures is is you know and and just to me when brother abe was speaking i was writing some questions down here what warning did people have it's got to bring you know a sense of urgency to us here in the united so when we go and we look into russia you know in 1956 i believe the prophet told us that it he said america had its chance and it's not by some coincidence that during that time frame that all of a sudden who shows up to the united states we play that short clip brother the key to khrushchev is there are some instances where you may be ah for example in the development of your of the thrust of your rockets for the investigation of outer space there may be some instances for example color television where we're ahead of you in order for both of us for both of us for both of us you know this kitchen debate was two rulers trying to fight for power and you saw how khrushchev was so he he was so why did what is the word he was charismatic or he was he believed what he was fighting for charismatic and he was talking about president nixon nope you guys claim television we're gonna we're gonna get television before you do it because and the reason i wanted to bring the united states we could see what's happening in ukraine but what does it have to do with us here you know so here comes this rise of this king because because the bible types it as the king of the north portland and i believe i don't know brother diego said you know it was almost like a a bear that was rising up competition began yes so you see how communism began to take over the world at that point don't fear russia but what's he doing in ukraine what's he doing there questa you know i just thought it was so crazy the picture that was painted to the world how about in hours the whole world bottled neck russia and basically shut them down completely why did that what picture did that paint just like that that never took sides with anybody but now they're a player that shut everything in and out of russia if the whole world could have done that to the big dog of that industry on that side how easy is it going to be in this world council of churches iglesias and says you know what because [Music] how this picture got painted so fast that's why the private guy said watch russia watch russia watch russia observe but what is russia really doing let's let's go to the scriptures i'm going to start off with revelation 17 just so you can see the scripture being fulfilled for god have put in their hearts to fulfill his will and to agree and give their kingdom unto the beast until the words of god be fulfilled if russia only knew now let's jump to daniel chapter 11. daniel capital once i'm going to start i'm just going to read verse 40 and then we'll jump back down so just remember this particular scripture is here this is at the very end of and at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind with chariots with horsemen and with many ships and he shall enter into the countries and shall overflow and overpass and passover last because look look what russia is doing observing what does russia have on their flag does anyone know brother dan so we can see what the hammer is going to do back that's the first board he's going to come and to destroy and the 50s where you had the soviet union with a lot of power but you see how that broke up 91. so here goes russia now starting we're talking about the ukraine war okay so easy to get to get off track here is what is so important about ukraine that is powerful about it why does he want ukraine where's the first place that yeah where's the first place that that putin wanted wanted to start taking over was it a crimea he what's so important about that i know i know it's the biggest of of those countries that that he wants to take over but what what is so important about this is where's the other powerhouse saudi arabia so he has some competition but what if peru what if he could control it all wouldn't it be a big game changer read that brother this is an article this is an article that talks of why he wanted to go into you take that part but propaganda aside perhaps the answer is more on the black sea coast la tierra de ukranias a la costa del mar negro putin also annexes the right to any hydrocarbons found in its maritime [Music] energy firms such as exxon mobil chevron xiao repsol and china exxon mobil shell have begun to show real interest in working with kiev to explore the area and most interested energy companies have already found interesting deposits in russia's black sea zone companies and in romanian zones in sonas the romania trans-eero energy has even found commercially viable gas reserves under the crimson mainland at the same time reserves of cheaply accessible gas in siberia are running low tambien esta reservas in siberia but even if putin never extracts a drop of gas from his new territories listen to this part the land grab will ensure that gas prom his energy champion will be in charge of how when and by whom this might be done it is it will mean that no matter who rules ukraine significa it can never challenge putin's monopoly on energy exports from the region oil and gas also shed light on putin's interest in the creamian port of the poll and you see how our local administration right now they're they're against oil administration petroleum trying to get everything to solar trying to get everything to electric cars you know and we're not taking anything back from ukraine you know it's very very powerful to see what they're doing but russia is a powerhouse you know and brother brown tells you at the end if they're gonna be the tool that completely and not starts to annihilate everybody you can't tell me that the little country of ukraine is going to stand against them i wanted you to see this so you could see the scripture being fulfilled [Music] so daniel 11 36 now and the king shall do according to his will and he shall exalt himself and magnify himself above every god and shall speak marvelous things against the god of gods and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished for that is determined shall be done you saw the you you see how he had an attitude that's the attitude of communism that has taken over that part of the world but church remember what we said there's got to be a sense of urgency because you look at our government it's just another form of communism it's corrupt it rules over us and you know there's our our eyes should be open neither shall he regard the god of his fathers nor the desire of woman god is capitalized here but i can't remember anybody in that generation [Music] i believed in the same god they've always believed that there was no god you know and and that's that's been the powerhouse of of how that communism began to take over on that part yes and it's beginning just just like you read brother what is this war done over there yeah i was watching some testimonials today and it talks about how that every all these ukrainians that are leaving the country they're so much on edge that if you cut in line just to get out of the country you're probably going to die or you're going to be in a fist fight because many times we think that we're the only believers we're the only ones that can rise above everything but it was tremendous hearing how what this war in ukraine did to the believers have very little food no water synagogue they're fighting to survive because they they knew that they lived in a communist country because our prophet says in those communist countries communism is just one percent you still have 99 others that are that believe christianity is once you see the complete unfolding of daniel 11. once this king turns and starts to go to the south we're not going to be here our time it's got to be that point where we're we we are taking away tiene the time is we don't we have less time than what we think you could go and and you could see 50 years ago we were crying there's no but we could look at the scripture and we could say this day the scripture is being fulfilled right right now you hear very politicians speaking about what russia will do or will not do all right i was a military man so i'll speak like a military man and i want us to know a little bit more about putin he's a special man he he's a man that has graduated he's an attorney specialist and he majored in what is politics but the most interesting thing about the life of putin he served in in kgb for many years that makes them a a very much an enemy of the united states that makes them have a special characteristic when people see a pudding they cannot describe it there's no way they can read him and that's the conflict many people have dumbass simply in one month takes over a whole nation generally the way that people think it will do it what he did in ukraine it is a symbol or a sign that russia is placing a economically the country of russia that is a great error and speaking as a military man when brother branham speaks to us about russia he also typifies it as the bearer [Music] of sheer force and an explosion against what's affecting him says when russia and china act it will be so quick the united states will not be able to defend itself now we're speaking about the signs there are many signs the same that was told unto the jews the sign of jonas what was the sign of jonah for the bride it would be the sign of the resurrection between the [Music] that's the the purple curtain said don't do not fear russia but fear the purple curtain the the purple curtain is a boycott right you won't realize but the bride has a sign that is the resurrection the sign [Music] shall see this sign then judgment will come not sure if anyone else has something to say one point i got a question for brother abe no problem and if his people don't unite how does he unite them give us an example well oh right um i'll just read the quote this will answer that question is that right brother ben yes sir responded and he says oh the spirit of god just moving through me now you're saying something i don't know how to say it you know two thousand two thousand hundred thousand demons turned loose upon upon those jews when they burned them they crucified them and they shot them until they had no more bullets to shoot them with pasta and they'd done everything they could do they what a tremendous when i saw that code it was you know because many times we god gives us opportunity after opportunity and many times we we reject opportunities you know we see a service like sunday domingo by church wow if that wasn't if that wasn't a cry too to bring us back home many times it's easy to to fall under the spirit of the day spiritual relaxed many times we're cold we have need of nothing when god is slapping us on the face [Music] it's time to go home it's time to unite time to get right with god but what is it going to take the prophet god says look to russia and prophet he says you got to watch russia but he's cr he screamed and he cried he saw this day in this hour is he knew that we were going to reject him that's why he preached the message he says there'll come a time when they reject and they crucify him it's clear right before our eyes and we can't live the same anymore is that one opportunity and i believe that's what these these teachings have done to me from inside to open and to cry and to want to know more about what he's doing [Music] what a blessing that god has put in our midst god bless you thank you all for your attention [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] my three [Music] oh [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] is [Music] [Music]
