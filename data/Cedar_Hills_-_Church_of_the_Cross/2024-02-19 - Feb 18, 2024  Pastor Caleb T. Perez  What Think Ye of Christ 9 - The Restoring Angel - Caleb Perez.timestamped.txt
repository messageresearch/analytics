[37:07] then preeminence in his bride and
[37:11] then restore the kingdom to its rightly
[37:17] position that's the key right there to
[37:19] its rightly position brother
[37:22] BR amen so if you can stand for the
[37:25] reading of the word
[37:28] this is such a it was such a hard
[37:33] study for various
[37:36] reasons but uh we we'll get into it in a
[37:39] little bit and and you'll understand
[37:41] what I'm talking
[37:43] about the restoring
[37:46] Angel the angel is uh it's not the
[37:49] restoring angle please change the angle
[37:51] to
[37:53] Angel and
[37:55] uh and but we know what they mean but we
[37:58] still need to get that get that right
[38:00] amen amen I'm waiting for the angel to
[38:03] come
[38:08] pleas
[38:10] oh there you go amen thank you my
[38:14] brothers for that remember Angel is a
[38:17] messenger
[38:18] amen so this is the restoring messenger
[38:22] or the restoring
[38:24] Angel the only way that the kingdom
[38:27] could be restored back to its rightly
[38:32] position Matthew 2241 42 while the
[38:35] Pharisees were gathered together Jesus
[38:37] asked them saying what think ye of
[38:42] Christ amen may God add His blessings to
[38:45] the reading of his
[38:47] word you may be
[38:49] seated I feel a good spirit
[38:54] today I feel a good atmosphere
[38:57] tell your neighbor
[38:58] hello shake their hands again and say
[39:02] it's good to have you good to see you
[39:07] neighbor
[39:10] amen when we talk about the restoring of
[39:13] the
[39:15] Kingdom two kingdoms come to
[39:19] mind and that is the Kingdom of
[39:22] Heaven and the kingdom of
[39:24] God yes all right so my question to you
[39:29] would be this
[39:32] morning are they two different
[39:35] kingdoms is it the same
[39:38] Kingdom what's with
[39:41] this hard to understand
[39:44] this your mind goes one
[39:47] way and you think it's a certain way and
[39:51] then you see something else you're like
[39:52] Well it can't be
[39:53] that and so ultimately you have to wait
[39:56] on God
[39:58] right you wait upon the inspiration you
[40:00] wait upon the revealing or the
[40:02] revelation of the
[40:05] word because these two
[40:08] things the Kingdom of Heaven and the
[40:10] kingdom of
[40:12] God they seem to at times they're used
[40:19] interchangeably you can hear here he the
[40:21] prophets say you know the the Kingdom of
[40:24] Heaven is at
[40:25] hand and then turn around and say the
[40:27] kingdom of God is at
[40:29] hand the Bible speaks about both of
[40:33] course and when we look into this we we
[40:36] find out that that the the phrase the
[40:39] Kingdom of
[40:41] Heaven is used only in one book of the
[40:45] Bible and that is in the book
[40:53] of The Book of St Matthew
[40:57] very good all right I think it's like 32
[40:59] times it's mentioned in the Book of
[41:02] Matthew and it's not used anymore after
[41:05] that and so like I said do you use you
[41:08] you hear it and it says the Kingdom of
[41:10] Heaven is is nigh or is at
[41:13] hand then you hear the kingdom of God is
[41:16] Not is at
[41:17] hand so so you think and you say well I
[41:20] I guess it's all the
[41:22] same well after a while you get to
[41:26] understand some
[41:27] things such as is is it two books or one
[41:33] book and and in one sense it's taught
[41:36] that it's two
[41:37] books in another sense it's it's the
[41:40] same book brother Adam
[41:42] says and so you see the different the
[41:45] different parts of
[41:47] it and this is what we want to to be
[41:49] able to to bring to you this
[41:53] morning we see the kingdom of of heaven
[41:56] and if you want to write these things
[41:58] down they're they're very
[42:01] helpful but the Kingdom of Heaven deals
[42:03] with time and
[42:07] events this is this is very very
[42:10] important to so you can get this it
[42:13] deals with
[42:16] Seasons it deals with the
[42:20] Earthly and it consists of the
[42:24] word all right so you got that again
[42:27] Kingdom of Heaven
[42:29] time SE events it's all about this okay
[42:34] and this is this is this is is so
[42:37] good but the kingdom of
[42:40] God is Not
[42:42] time it's not
[42:44] events the kingdom of God
[42:50] is is eternal etal it's the Eternal part
[42:56] now now this is this is like I said you
[42:58] got to get this because the kingdom of
[43:00] God God is the
[43:02] spirit so it is a spiritual
[43:05] Kingdom spirit of God kingdom of God is
[43:08] a spiritual
[43:10] Kingdom Kingdom of Heaven remember how
[43:14] the pattern that Moses saw in
[43:17] heaven and it was brought to Earth that
[43:21] pattern that's why he built the
[43:22] Tabernacle the way that he built it
[43:25] right was after the Tabernacle of or the
[43:28] pattern of what he had seen in
[43:31] heaven now now what we're looking
[43:35] for and
[43:37] Desiring is that the Kingdom of Heaven
[43:39] and the kingdom of
[43:41] God come
[43:44] together this is our greatest this is my
[43:47] greatest
[43:48] desire for me and for all of
[43:51] you we don't want the Kingdom of Heaven
[43:53] and the kingdom of God to be two
[43:55] separate things
[43:58] listen closely that's why I say is it
[44:00] two things or is it
[44:02] one we can't leave it at two it's got to
[44:06] come to become one and the
[44:10] same this is what we would know is known
[44:13] as the blending of Time and
[44:18] Eternity got that that's what we're
[44:20] trying to do we're trying to blend the
[44:22] events or blend time with eternity
[44:28] we belong to a kingdom and I want to
[44:30] know how many this morning say can say I
[44:32] belong to a
[44:34] kingdom and the kingdom is the word of
[44:38] God made spirit and life in our
[44:44] life now Matthew the 11th
[44:47] chapter and and uh brother I I I thank
[44:50] brother Danny for showing he shared this
[44:53] with
[44:54] me this this goes this goes just right
[44:58] with with with h with my
[45:00] message so I said brother Dan is it all
[45:03] right if I use this and he he said sure
[45:06] yeah so this is where we we start our
[45:09] message
[45:10] then Matthew 1112 says and from the days
[45:13] of John the
[45:17] Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven
[45:22] suffereth
[45:24] violence this is
[45:26] important because the kingdom of God
[45:29] doesn't suffer
[45:32] violence everybody understand this the
[45:35] Bible says the Kingdom of Heaven
[45:37] suffereth
[45:39] violence and the violent take it by
[45:44] force okay now when when we see this
[45:49] this is what brother Danny shared with
[45:52] me and this was the Aramaic translation
[45:55] of that
[45:57] verse this is this one's going to blow
[45:59] you
[46:00] away are you ready if you're writing
[46:03] this down get this because this is
[46:06] tremendous once again
[46:08] until now the Kingdom of Heaven
[46:11] suffereth
[46:13] violence now this is this is the
[46:18] translation from the
[46:20] moment that John stepped onto the
[46:24] scene
[46:26] until
[46:27] now the realm of Heaven's
[46:31] kingdom is bursting
[46:37] forth I can say God bless you good to
[46:41] talk to you
[46:42] today and I could walk away and be happy
[46:45] and content with just
[46:47] that once again from the moment that
[46:49] John stepped onto the
[46:53] scene until now the realm of Heaven's
[46:58] kingdom is bursting
[47:01] forth and passionate
[47:05] people taken a hold of its
[47:09] power can you give one to the Lord Jesus
[47:11] this
[47:15] morning it's not just Oh Brother John
[47:18] decided to come onto the scene huh
[47:22] no he stepped onto the scene
[47:27] and the realm of Heaven's kingdom are
[47:31] now this is the Kingdom of
[47:32] Heaven the realm of Heaven's Kingdom
[47:36] bursted
[47:38] forth I wonder if it could be told of of
[47:42] us the same way this
[47:44] morning that something burst forth when
[47:48] you and I came on the
[47:51] scene oh this is and the passionate
[47:54] people
[47:56] they've taken a hold of its
[48:00] power if I have to say this 10 times I'm
[48:02] going to say it 10
[48:04] times passionate
[48:07] people I want to know how many
[48:09] passionate people we
[48:11] have we're here because we're passionate
[48:14] of what we
[48:16] believe we're passionate about the
[48:18] kingdom of
[48:21] godate about the kingdom of
[48:24] heaven with pass
[48:27] because I love him and I love his
[48:30] people that's what we're after this
[48:33] morning passionate people have taken
[48:35] hold of its
[48:38] power there's a power that deals with
[48:42] the Kingdom of
[48:44] Heaven that only the
[48:49] violent or the passionate
[48:52] one can take the power and do something
[48:55] with
[48:57] now watch now John the
[49:00] Baptist with the spirit of
[49:03] Elijah he foran Christ's first coming we
[49:06] all know that
[49:08] right and the moment he stepped onto the
[49:13] scene there was a burst that
[49:17] happened all
[49:19] hell they knew that something just went
[49:24] down there was such a burst that
[49:27] happened I can just
[49:30] imagine the Realms of Heaven's
[49:33] Kingdom had been waiting for thousands
[49:36] of
[49:38] years to get back to human
[49:43] being oh we know God above us we know
[49:47] God above us we know oh heaven we we all
[49:51] want to go to heaven is that
[49:53] right but there's something tremendous
[49:56] about
[49:56] this and that is that heaven didn't want
[49:59] to stay by
[50:02] itself Heaven wanted to come down to
[50:05] human beings one more
[50:08] time that's why we sing the song Heaven
[50:12] came down and Glory filled my
[50:17] soul imagine
[50:19] Heaven say are you ready you ready this
[50:23] is the beginning of the burst
[50:26] tell your neighbor neighbor it's the
[50:28] beginning of the
[50:30] burst watch this now oh I can imagine
[50:34] all hell began to
[50:37] shake because a burst had just
[50:40] happened where did that come
[50:43] from somebody came on the
[50:46] scene the realm of Heaven burst
[50:51] forth here comes the
[50:54] Forerunner the Forerunner of Christ the
[50:58] word made
[51:00] flesh and finally everything had come
[51:05] together for heaven to
[51:09] descend and Heavenly
[51:12] places to be visited once
[51:17] again by mortal
[51:20] men okay all right I'm going to say it
[51:22] again I I got to I got to say this to
[51:25] you again
[51:27] finally the path was being
[51:31] open for heaven to
[51:34] desend and Heavenly
[51:37] places going to be visited
[51:41] Again by mere mortal human
[51:49] beings my goodness is this a tremendous
[51:53] plan plan this is important to to
[51:56] remember because Johan's Ministry was
[51:58] not a Ministry of
[52:02] restoration absolutely nothing restored
[52:05] under the ministry of John the
[52:08] Baptist but it was a Ministry of for a
[52:11] forerunning christ first
[52:16] coming and it included a Ministry of
[52:21] repentance that's why you don't hear of
[52:23] any Miracles that John the Baptist
[52:29] did say it again What miracles don't
[52:33] hear about any why because he had a
[52:36] specific job to
[52:38] do the Kingdom of
[52:41] Heaven just bursted
[52:44] forth and he was to
[52:47] introduce let me introduce to
[52:50] you the word made
[52:53] flesh this is the Lamb of God takes away
[52:58] the sins of the
[52:59] world I like that that's why when you
[53:01] see Matthew
[53:04] 1710 and all this will start coming
[53:07] together watch this and his disciples
[53:10] asked him
[53:12] saying why then say the scribes that
[53:14] Elias must first
[53:17] come and Jesus and said unto them Elias
[53:21] truly shall first
[53:24] come
[53:26] and restore all things now we're now
[53:29] this is restoring
[53:30] Angel Jesus never applied the
[53:33] restoration of all
[53:36] things to John the Baptist no no verse
[53:41] 11 is
[53:44] future so he separates verse 11 from
[53:47] verse
[53:49] 12 and then he goes on verse 12 to
[53:53] say but I say to to you that Elias is
[53:58] come
[53:59] already and they knew him not but have
[54:03] done unto him whatsoever they
[54:07] listed likewise shall also the son of
[54:09] man suffer of
[54:12] them then the disciples
[54:16] understood that he spake unto them of
[54:19] John the
[54:20] Baptist so then why would they later on
[54:23] think about this
[54:26] Elias shall first
[54:29] come restore all
[54:31] things why then in the future or later
[54:36] on Acts chapter
[54:38] one they they came
[54:41] together and they asked him saying
[54:44] Lord will thou at this
[54:47] time restore again the kingdom to
[54:52] Israel why would they ask him that
[54:54] question
[54:55] question when he had already told them
[54:59] that Elias was going to first
[55:02] come and restore all
[55:06] things my understanding is a
[55:11] l
[55:13] all means
[55:15] all that means the kingdom to
[55:18] Israel that means the kingdom of God
[55:22] that means that it was going to come by
[55:25] a restoring
[55:27] Angel okay then let's see where this is
[55:29] going to take
[55:30] us all
[55:32] things let's contemplate this for a
[55:36] moment Jesus is telling them now this is
[55:39] important Jesus is telling them the
[55:42] name of his first of the Forerunner of
[55:45] his first
[55:47] coming what was the name of the
[55:49] Forerunner of his first
[55:54] coming
[56:00] I want to know who Jesus said was the
[56:04] Forerunner of his first
[56:08] coming not a trick question I promise
[56:11] you once
[56:12] again who did Jesus
[56:15] say was going to be the Forerunner or
[56:18] was the Forerunner of his first
[56:22] coming ah Elias
[56:25] Jesus never said John the
[56:27] Baptist he said Elias shall truly first
[56:30] come
[56:31] right Elias has already
[56:35] come now take this now John was
[56:38] born they didn't know that his name was
[56:43] John is that right if you read the book
[56:46] of of St Luke the first
[56:48] chapter they had come to the temple on
[56:51] the eighth day to circumcise him
[56:55] and there's always nosy people all the
[56:58] all the time
[57:00] right does anybody here have have like
[57:03] nosy
[57:06] relatives do not answer that
[57:11] question but we all have nosy relatives
[57:14] and nosy
[57:17] friends and they come to the to the
[57:20] temple and the first thing they say the
[57:22] Bible tells
[57:23] you his name is
[57:28] Zacharias right the neighbors and it
[57:31] says and her
[57:34] family all those right they came his
[57:37] name
[57:38] Zacharias we're so happy zaras has
[57:43] come and then Elizabeth
[57:47] says no his name is not
[57:50] zaras his name is
[57:53] John
[57:55] John there's nobody in your family
[57:57] that's even named
[58:00] John anybody ever tell you
[58:02] that name your children you couldn't
[58:05] name it this or that they named their
[58:10] children and the funny thing about it is
[58:12] that they didn't ask you what you
[58:14] thought about it they said this is why
[58:16] we're naming them I don't like that name
[58:19] well name your own
[58:21] children but it is important that you
[58:24] name your children children
[58:26] right because that has a lot to do with
[58:29] their
[58:31] character so she says his name's going
[58:33] to be John anyways doesn't matter what
[58:35] you have to
[58:37] say so they look to
[58:39] Zechariah and of course he can't speak
[58:42] at the time
[58:43] right so he says something he needs
[58:46] something to write on a
[58:49] tablet and he writes
[58:51] down
[58:53] John and and the moment that he says it
[58:56] and seals it that his name is
[58:59] John his tongue is
[59:01] loosened he speak again now this is what
[59:05] I'm getting
[59:07] at some called him
[59:11] Zacharias some called him
[59:13] John but Jesus called him
[59:18] Elias this is important when you're when
[59:20] we're Kingdom of Heaven kingdom of
[59:23] God
[59:25] he calls Elias or John
[59:29] Elias based on the spirit that's
[59:32] anointing
[59:34] him he knows the spirit that's on him is
[59:38] the spirit of
[59:41] Elijah so they say Elias must first
[59:47] come and Jesus said he's already
[59:51] come Elias has already
[59:53] come he never identifies him once again
[59:56] as John the
[59:58] Baptist but as
[1:00:00] Elias and that's when they knew the
[1:00:03] Bible
[1:00:04] says that he was speaking of
[1:00:07] John amen now look notice this Luke
[1:00:12] 166 and all they that heard them laid
[1:00:16] them
[1:00:16] up in their heart saying what Manner of
[1:00:20] Child shall this
[1:00:23] be
[1:00:25] and the Hand of the Lord was with
[1:00:28] him Luke 7:28 and have your Bibles
[1:00:31] because we got a few scriptures you want
[1:00:33] to
[1:00:34] read Luke 7:28 says for I say unto
[1:00:38] you among those that are born of
[1:00:42] women there is not a greater Prophet
[1:00:45] than John the
[1:00:48] Baptist how many believe that the Bible
[1:00:51] says that there's not a greater one born
[1:00:53] of women
[1:00:55] all right but oh here we
[1:00:58] go born of a woman no one greater than
[1:01:02] John the
[1:01:06] Baptist
[1:01:08] but he that is least in the kingdom of
[1:01:14] God doesn't say Kingdom of Heaven here
[1:01:17] he that is least in the kingdom of
[1:01:20] God is greater than
[1:01:23] he who could be greater than the
[1:01:28] Forerunner but born of a woman he was
[1:01:30] the
[1:01:32] greatest but those that are in the
[1:01:34] kingdom of
[1:01:36] God they are not put in there by the
[1:01:39] birth of their or their
[1:01:43] physical they are born into this
[1:01:46] Kingdom by a spiritual
[1:01:49] birth and that's why the least of those
[1:01:52] that are in the kingdom of God
[1:01:55] is greater than
[1:01:58] John this is this is important that you
[1:02:00] get this
[1:02:03] now the kingdom of God can only be
[1:02:08] established in the heart of a
[1:02:11] person that has been born of the
[1:02:13] spirit born from above we're all born of
[1:02:17] a
[1:02:18] woman but now we are in the time where
[1:02:23] we must be born
[1:02:28] again was Caleb born of a
[1:02:31] woman sure I was born to my
[1:02:35] parents but I was born
[1:02:42] again I'm going to say it again I was
[1:02:44] born
[1:02:46] again and therefore I was transferred
[1:02:49] into this
[1:02:52] Kingdom he was forerunning the
[1:02:56] kingdom and why did they get so angry at
[1:03:02] John because of his
[1:03:07] Spirit I'm GNA say it again why did they
[1:03:11] get so angry at
[1:03:14] John because of his
[1:03:16] spirit yet because of his
[1:03:19] Spirit Jesus calls him
[1:03:22] Elias yet the rest of the world
[1:03:26] they didn't they were angry upset
[1:03:28] furious at
[1:03:29] him because the spirit he
[1:03:32] had was to call out what was
[1:03:38] wrong if you want to be friends with
[1:03:41] everyone you can't have the spirit of
[1:03:46] Elijah it's all
[1:03:48] okay you're going to heaven we're all
[1:03:50] going to heaven we just let's just love
[1:03:53] one another
[1:03:56] that's the cultures that's that's what
[1:03:58] they like to say just love everybody
[1:04:02] until you disagree with them they don't
[1:04:04] love you so
[1:04:06] much yeah am I the only one that lives
[1:04:08] in this kind of
[1:04:10] world the world we live
[1:04:12] in they were furious at him because they
[1:04:16] didn't like what he was
[1:04:19] preaching what was he
[1:04:23] preaching
[1:04:27] oh there you
[1:04:29] go somebody's got it now I he was
[1:04:33] preaching serpent
[1:04:37] seed yes or yes you Generation of
[1:04:42] Vipers other words your papa was the
[1:04:44] serpent back
[1:04:46] there what did he do he stood up and and
[1:04:49] said the
[1:04:50] truth it's not right for you to be to be
[1:04:53] taking your brother's
[1:04:56] wife what was he doing showing that it
[1:04:59] was the serpent
[1:05:02] seed he was preaching it and you know
[1:05:05] what it what happened to him we all know
[1:05:09] they chopped his head
[1:05:12] off why they didn't want to hear that
[1:05:15] anymore they wanted to silence the voice
[1:05:17] of God to
[1:05:20] them listen he's preaching serpent seed
[1:05:24] not
[1:05:26] right and
[1:05:28] yet people continue going on very
[1:05:34] religious what does he
[1:05:36] know barely came out of the Wilderness
[1:05:38] and camel
[1:05:48] clothed that's what he was eating all
[1:05:50] this it comes out and say hey
[1:05:53] repent
[1:05:54] yeah repent or
[1:05:59] perish get some honey in Grasshoppers
[1:06:03] and he was munching them right but he
[1:06:06] was preaching the
[1:06:08] truth why because the spirit of Elias
[1:06:10] was upon
[1:06:12] him now think about
[1:06:14] this Jesus is
[1:06:17] also not only identifying John as
[1:06:22] Elias but he's also identifying a future
[1:06:28] Prophet that was going to come to the
[1:06:31] Gentiles also as
[1:06:36] Elias I like that it was a prophet that
[1:06:40] was to rise up to the
[1:06:43] Gentiles that would rise up to the
[1:06:47] Gentiles and would bring a
[1:06:50] message for a complete restoration of
[1:06:54] all
[1:06:56] things he's coming but in the
[1:07:00] meantime elas was already here but you
[1:07:03] did with him whatever you
[1:07:07] wanted talking about John the
[1:07:10] Baptist now now where would this
[1:07:13] messenger in the spirit of Elijah
[1:07:17] start brother brandom in the paman
[1:07:19] church
[1:07:21] age I want you to be very careful here
[1:07:23] and see
[1:07:24] this God has promised that at the end
[1:07:28] time Malachi 4 is going to be
[1:07:32] fulfilled it has to be for it is the
[1:07:35] spirit Quicken word of
[1:07:40] God spoken by the prophet
[1:07:45] Malachi just before Christ comes the
[1:07:48] second
[1:07:50] time and by the time Jesus comes
[1:07:55] all scripture must be
[1:07:58] fulfilled say I want everybody to say it
[1:08:01] with me before Jesus
[1:08:04] comes the second
[1:08:07] time all scripture must be
[1:08:13] fulfilled the Gentile dispensation will
[1:08:15] be in its last Church
[1:08:19] age when that messenger of Malachi comes
[1:08:24] he will be right with the
[1:08:26] word he will take the whole
[1:08:29] Bible from Genesis to
[1:08:32] Revelation what he says and he will
[1:08:35] start at serpent
[1:08:40] SE that's good huh that's what John was
[1:08:45] preaching and so will this restoring
[1:08:48] Angel he will start at serpent
[1:08:52] SE carry on to the message in the latter
[1:08:57] rign and he will be rejected by
[1:09:01] denomination as long as he was praying
[1:09:03] for the
[1:09:04] sick the gift was in
[1:09:07] operation Bring It On in Bring It On
[1:09:11] in love you
[1:09:13] brother love
[1:09:16] you but when he says it's not
[1:09:19] right live with a woman that's not your
[1:09:22] wife
[1:09:26] that's
[1:09:27] right it's the whole problem from the
[1:09:31] beginning
[1:09:32] right what was it sex
[1:09:37] SE that's the problem of all majority of
[1:09:40] problems in the
[1:09:42] home hello everybody it's all about
[1:09:47] sex oh come on act like you don't know
[1:09:50] what I'm talking
[1:09:51] about not in church brother this is
[1:09:55] where it needs to be
[1:09:57] taught there nothing to
[1:09:59] fear could have been with our founding
[1:10:03] Pastor I he him the other day and he's
[1:10:05] like okay everybody say it
[1:10:08] together okay I want you all to spell it
[1:10:10] out with
[1:10:12] me I don't want you to be afraid of that
[1:10:16] word it's a wonderful thing if it's done
[1:10:20] correctly but the problem is is that's
[1:10:22] where it all starts
[1:10:24] it all starts with serpent
[1:10:26] seed do things and you and you say
[1:10:29] things and you think
[1:10:30] things based upon that and I can go on
[1:10:34] that but I'm not that's not my subject
[1:10:37] today but watch this is so I I just love
[1:10:41] how how how this is put together in
[1:10:43] God's
[1:10:45] word when he started to speak on serpent
[1:10:49] SE they rejected
[1:10:52] him why does serpent seed bring so much
[1:10:59] Scandal because it hits all the
[1:11:05] homes because this guy likes doing
[1:11:07] things he's not supposed
[1:11:10] to come on now come on now point to
[1:11:13] ourselves because this person likes
[1:11:16] doing
[1:11:17] things that's not part of the kingdom of
[1:11:20] God that's not part of the Kingdom of
[1:11:22] Heaven
[1:11:26] perversion yet it's an honorable thing
[1:11:28] when when two come together in
[1:11:32] marriage Genesis
[1:11:34] 3:14 and God said unto the
[1:11:38] serpent God is speaking to the
[1:11:41] serpent because thou has done
[1:11:43] this Thou Art cursed above all cattle
[1:11:47] and above every beast of the field upon
[1:11:50] thy belly shalt thou
[1:11:52] go th shalt thou eat all the days of thy
[1:11:57] life and I will put
[1:12:00] enmity we've heard many messages on this
[1:12:03] but watch I who say who's saying
[1:12:07] I God is saying I will put
[1:12:12] enmity nobody else I'm going to do this
[1:12:16] I'm going to put enmity between thee and
[1:12:18] the
[1:12:19] woman and between thy seed and her seed
[1:12:25] it shall bruise thy
[1:12:27] head and thou shalt bruise his
[1:12:31] heel did you get that okay here's the
[1:12:34] enmity G to go
[1:12:36] on one more time it shall bruise thy
[1:12:39] head now Satan's
[1:12:40] hearing he's in the serpent right and
[1:12:43] he's hearing this it shall bruise thy
[1:12:49] head so he tries to get ahead of God's
[1:12:52] plan
[1:12:55] it shall bruise my head
[1:12:57] huh this is the way that he works this
[1:13:00] is the way he
[1:13:02] thinks I'm going to tell you something
[1:13:04] today you've heard this a million times
[1:13:07] now it's a million in
[1:13:09] one seed does not persecute
[1:13:17] seed that should be something we put on
[1:13:20] our
[1:13:22] refrigerator seed of God does not
[1:13:26] persecute the seed of
[1:13:29] God your neighbor neighbor the seed of
[1:13:33] God does not persecute the seed of
[1:13:38] God but the seed of
[1:13:41] God
[1:13:42] can can and will persecute
[1:13:51] serpent oh yeah I already know where you
[1:13:53] guys's mind is going I I can read you
[1:13:57] like a book this
[1:13:58] morning once again the seed of God can
[1:14:02] and
[1:14:04] will I'm not talking about
[1:14:08] physical that's right am because our
[1:14:11] fight's not against flesh and
[1:14:14] blood I'm talking about the spirit that
[1:14:17] anoints why are we not persecuting those
[1:14:22] spirits all we know today is
[1:14:25] this we're Christians and we're we're
[1:14:28] just getting
[1:14:31] persecuted and everywhere you look oh
[1:14:33] this parts of the world they persecute
[1:14:37] Christians it is
[1:14:39] true but when will the
[1:14:42] Christian start
[1:14:47] persecuting well well you know why we
[1:14:50] don't is because we're
[1:14:52] afraid we fear we fear the
[1:14:56] enemy tough as we say we are think we
[1:15:00] are we fear the
[1:15:05] enemy right oh I've been in the message
[1:15:08] and what does that
[1:15:10] mean you been in the message 150
[1:15:14] years that doesn't mean
[1:15:16] nothing I'm talking about when the
[1:15:18] message has come to
[1:15:20] you live in the kingdom of God and the
[1:15:22] kingdom of heaven have come and United
[1:15:27] together that's right there is
[1:15:30] persecution going
[1:15:31] on
[1:15:33] absolutely but there's more of a
[1:15:35] spiritual
[1:15:37] persecution problem is we don't know how
[1:15:39] to fight
[1:15:45] back if you only knew what I go
[1:15:49] through only
[1:15:51] you conat
[1:15:54] congratulations and I'm not making light
[1:15:55] of it because we all go through hard
[1:15:58] times I'm getting at is
[1:16:01] this as we heard before when will you
[1:16:04] torment the
[1:16:07] Tormentor when will you persecute the
[1:16:10] persecutor what are we waiting for some
[1:16:13] right time or somebody to ding ding ding
[1:16:16] ding now this is
[1:16:17] it no no no this this is beyond that I'm
[1:16:21] talking about the kingdom of God and the
[1:16:23] kingdom of heaven coming
[1:16:27] together if not you're going to always
[1:16:29] be the
[1:16:31] PO look at me and look at my condition
[1:16:34] I'm going to bring it closer to
[1:16:37] home one person preaches the
[1:16:40] message and another one preaches the
[1:16:43] message why then do they persecute one
[1:16:52] another
[1:16:53] don't act like you don't know what I'm
[1:16:54] talking
[1:16:57] about here's the
[1:16:59] problem we're always looking at things
[1:17:01] from our Vantage or
[1:17:05] Viewpoint they're persecuting me oh
[1:17:07] they're coming against
[1:17:10] me you little
[1:17:14] child
[1:17:15] baby why don't you ever stop to try to
[1:17:18] look at at things from their point of
[1:17:22] view
[1:17:24] why don't we stop and say what are they
[1:17:26] going
[1:17:28] through you know why because the kingdom
[1:17:31] of God has not been
[1:17:35] established church has been
[1:17:38] established religion has been
[1:17:40] establish but the kingdom of God has not
[1:17:43] been
[1:17:44] establish seed will not
[1:17:48] persecute instead of looking at it we
[1:17:50] look what they're doing to
[1:17:52] me see what we can do for
[1:17:56] them I'm preaching to myself
[1:17:58] church I ain't throwing this to anyone
[1:18:01] else's
[1:18:02] yard I'm looking in the mirror of God's
[1:18:05] word I'm getting to something here why
[1:18:08] do they persecute one
[1:18:11] another why can't we see each other face
[1:18:14] to
[1:18:16] face because there's enmity
[1:18:20] there and enmity is
[1:18:24] hatred enmity is
[1:18:27] hostility and we're hostile to one
[1:18:32] another you're not close to the kingdom
[1:18:35] like
[1:18:37] that you can be close to the
[1:18:39] church you can be close to the
[1:18:42] pastor but you're far from the
[1:18:47] kingdom the other
[1:18:49] day the enemy
[1:18:51] comes
[1:18:54] there was a
[1:18:55] family and the enemy was trying to take
[1:18:58] them
[1:19:02] away I could have sat home and said well
[1:19:04] you want to go go God Bless
[1:19:06] you that's the easy
[1:19:10] thing but something in me didn't sit
[1:19:14] right and I could feel the spirit of
[1:19:16] David just start to raise
[1:19:21] up and I said no you ain't dirty
[1:19:25] devil so I took out my
[1:19:28] sling I took out my
[1:19:30] sword I
[1:19:32] went and I said the way David
[1:19:35] said I was tending my father's
[1:19:39] sheep when a lion tried to come and take
[1:19:44] one when a tried to take one of
[1:19:47] them and I slew them why cuz I went
[1:19:52] after the T
[1:19:53] Tor went the
[1:19:56] persecutor they were gone you could see
[1:19:59] the presence of God come
[1:20:01] back come back to their mind and they
[1:20:05] say I don't know what I was
[1:20:08] thinking because we've got to look after
[1:20:10] each other's
[1:20:12] Souls am I My Brother's
[1:20:15] Keeper yes I am yes you
[1:20:19] are in the Kingdom we are each other's
[1:20:22] keep
[1:20:25] but instead we fight each
[1:20:28] other what was I doing when I
[1:20:31] went I was persecuting the
[1:20:35] serpent oh come on now church I'm going
[1:20:37] to say it again I was
[1:20:42] persecuting scripture once
[1:20:45] again it shall bruise thy
[1:20:49] head here's here's Satan once again
[1:20:52] watch this watch how this unfolds saying
[1:20:56] knowing that the the blow to the
[1:21:00] head is a death
[1:21:03] blow so he's gonna blow he's gonna gonna
[1:21:06] bruise my head
[1:21:08] huh I'll get to it before he
[1:21:12] does we say anything I'll get it I'll
[1:21:14] get to it before God
[1:21:17] does I'll give God's kingdom a death
[1:21:21] blow
[1:21:23] and he does
[1:21:24] that by chopping off the head of the
[1:21:30] Forerunner I beat him to
[1:21:32] it not only did he chop John the Baptist
[1:21:35] head
[1:21:37] off but then he takes the
[1:21:43] Redeemer makes sure he's
[1:21:46] crucified at the place of the
[1:21:49] head go the skull amen
[1:21:54] I got the Forerunner and I've got the
[1:21:57] one he was
[1:22:00] forerunning
[1:22:04] beat but what he didn't
[1:22:09] know it had already been
[1:22:13] spoken I'm going to say it again he
[1:22:16] didn't know the word had already been
[1:22:19] spoken surely Elias must for
[1:22:22] [Music]
[1:22:24] and restore all
[1:22:27] things oh praise God me that's not the
[1:22:31] case
[1:22:32] today P will disrupt your
[1:22:35] families first thing he'll do is try to
[1:22:38] get rid of the
[1:22:41] head you know what I'm talking
[1:22:44] about the wife tries to be the head of
[1:22:46] the
[1:22:49] house the head has been cut off
[1:22:57] uhoh oh you guys are looking at me now
[1:23:01] again
[1:23:02] like you know what I'm talking
[1:23:04] about act the way the kingdom is
[1:23:06] supposed to
[1:23:08] act we don't act the way that we're
[1:23:10] supposed to in the
[1:23:12] Kingdom the wife wants to be the ruler
[1:23:14] she wants to
[1:23:15] be that's not restoring the kingdom to
[1:23:18] its rightly
[1:23:21] place
[1:23:23] but the man shouldn't treat her as a
[1:23:24] door as a as a as a
[1:23:29] match hello there's got to be an
[1:23:33] understanding I rule and I tell tell the
[1:23:36] man what to
[1:23:37] do from
[1:23:44] kingom
[1:23:47] like guys are in the the headlights
[1:23:49] right
[1:23:50] now cuz right now now you're
[1:23:54] thinking have I been ruling my
[1:23:57] house and they like it the women like
[1:24:01] that I'm I'm the one that
[1:24:05] we far from the
[1:24:07] kingdom because that's not your rightly
[1:24:15] position you want me to
[1:24:18] stop at least at least smile at
[1:24:21] me
[1:24:25] what I tell my daughters all the time I
[1:24:26] tell them dad
[1:24:29] jokes we've only heard that like 10,000
[1:24:33] times can't you give me a courtesy
[1:24:37] laugh yeah at least that thank
[1:24:42] you watch this
[1:24:45] now he's he disrupts the family
[1:24:49] unit he removes the head from the home
[1:24:52] his
[1:24:54] position then he's got
[1:24:58] that but the problem
[1:25:03] was I'm going to say it again the
[1:25:05] problem was and that Satan didn't
[1:25:10] realize that he was a little too
[1:25:14] late tell your neighbor he's a little
[1:25:16] too
[1:25:20] late that by the time that
[1:25:23] Sayan got John's head chopped
[1:25:27] off the Realms of the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:25:30] had already bursted
[1:25:33] for and the kingdom of God had been
[1:25:38] introduced he was too late Church once
[1:25:41] again the Realms of Heaven's
[1:25:44] Kingdom had already
[1:25:47] bursted and the kingdom of God was
[1:25:50] already introduced Behold the Lamb of
[1:25:53] God who takes away the sins of the
[1:25:57] world thy seed shall bruise the
[1:26:00] Serpent's
[1:26:01] head now he could not bruise it with the
[1:26:06] law he could not bruise it with the
[1:26:09] prophets but he did it when the woman's
[1:26:14] seed became the
[1:26:17] masterpie Christ what think you of
[1:26:21] Christ he bruised the Serpent's
[1:26:25] head what is the word bruise he put a

[1:36:38] earthquakes talk about
[1:36:40] volcanos what is he showing what is he
[1:36:42] telling us that this Earth is ready to
[1:36:46] to it's it's in labor
[1:36:50] pains ready for a new Earth to be pushed
[1:36:54] out
[1:36:56] of that's the way we should be church
[1:36:59] every time we come to service there be a
[1:37:02] bursting
[1:37:04] force a Son of God is trapped in there a

[1:37:31] ruled by the Lord Jesus and his
[1:37:34] bride it starts by looking the

[1:38:44] or
[1:38:47] something are you cold out there or is

[1:39:09] monster snake the
[1:39:12] weeds he crawls up on the
[1:39:14] highway of course the snake represents

[1:39:38] stopped and something would hold him
[1:39:42] off could bite me and he would turn
[1:39:45] around on the other side try to approach
[1:39:47] from this side he come real fast and
[1:39:49] then he gets
[1:39:52] he couldn't move he couldn't strike me
[1:39:55] but then he turned and looked at my
[1:39:58] friend remember what we preached last
[1:40:02] Sunday restoring

[1:40:06] that need to be
[1:40:08] restored whether they agree with us or
[1:40:10] not they it needs to be
[1:40:13] restored the Lord comes on Wednesday and
[1:40:15] preaches
[1:40:18] reconciliation my goodness how much
[1:40:21] clearer does God have to speak to us
[1:40:23] looked at my friend and a way he went
[1:40:25] after my friend I see my friend jumping
[1:40:28] way in the
[1:40:29] air trying to strike him I said if it

[1:43:03] Christ I bind you he said that thing
[1:43:06] just started crawling
[1:43:08] up began to choke
[1:43:10] itself and the brother was
[1:43:13] free just then the voice says you can
[1:43:16] unbind him
[1:43:18] too and I said then saying I that I
[1:43:21] might

[1:44:21] there watch what's bursting
[1:44:25] forth the sons of God are being made
[1:44:29] manifest and they are bursting on the
[1:44:33] scene oh come on church I'm talking to
[1:44:35] every one of you Son of God are bursting
[1:44:39] on the
[1:44:40] scene it's the manifestation of the sons
[1:44:43] of God other time were the sons of God
[1:44:47] to ever be made manifest but right now
[1:44:52] of all the times and brother Braham has
[1:44:55] just finished preaching I think it was
[1:44:56] the sixth
[1:44:58] Hill he's talking about questions and
[1:45:01] answers he said of all the times that
[1:45:05] I've been behind the
[1:45:08] pulpit have never never in any time of
[1:45:12] my
[1:45:13] Ministry ever
[1:45:15] worked into the Realms of
[1:45:19] God and the spiritual
[1:45:22] Realms has been this
[1:45:26] time beyond anything I ever did in any
[1:45:30] time of my
[1:45:32] Ministry in any meeting
[1:45:35] anywhere I am I am working in the Realms
[1:45:39] of
[1:45:40] God and the spiritual
[1:45:42] Realms and then he goes on in in the
[1:45:45] message look and I have been living ever
[1:45:49] since in the Glorious Realms of
[1:45:53] God because in the days of the voice of
[1:45:58] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:46:01] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:46:05] finished the
[1:46:08] restoring the
[1:46:11] restoring it should be finished question
[1:46:14] it is it is it finished in your
[1:46:18] life come on now we're driving it home
[1:46:21] finished in your
[1:46:23] life where we are this
[1:46:25] morning coming around the
[1:46:29] corner you love him all right I'll
[1:46:33] notice this now how many of you want to
[1:46:35] go to
[1:46:47] heaven how can you go to heaven if if
[1:46:49] Heaven has come
[1:46:53] down just the
[1:46:55] question and which Heaven do you want to
[1:46:57] go
[1:46:58] to the Bible talks about a first
[1:47:02] Heaven third
[1:47:06] heaven what heaven are you going to go
[1:47:08] to the air up
[1:47:11] there brother Henry tells me that the
[1:47:13] higher you go the less air there
[1:47:17] is right harder harder to to
[1:47:28] breathe when we think about
[1:47:31] this that's why I I I
[1:47:35] understand very touchy Kingdom of Heaven
[1:47:38] kingdom of
[1:47:40] God and I see
[1:47:44] this I said now now notice brother
[1:47:47] brandham when he preaches is this is the
[1:47:49] sign of the the
[1:47:53] answer can somebody tell me what the
[1:47:56] first mystery that brother Bram talks
[1:47:59] about he gives a list of mysteries is
[1:48:02] that
[1:48:03] right gives a list of
[1:48:05] mysteries what's the number one mystery
[1:48:07] that brother B now the first
[1:48:09] mystery anybody
[1:48:16] know the mystery of the Kingdom of
[1:48:19] Heaven
[1:48:20] the first mystery is the mystery of the
[1:48:22] kingdom of
[1:48:25] heaven and if God
[1:48:28] speaks or sends
[1:48:30] you he backs what you say notice if
[1:48:34] you're an ambassador from Heaven All
[1:48:36] Heaven is behind
[1:48:38] you this is the key to the kingdom of
[1:48:41] heaven and the kingdom of God
[1:48:43] watch Heaven is
[1:48:47] consisted of the
[1:48:49] word
[1:48:50] all right you got the
[1:48:52] word all right we got
[1:48:55] Heaven Heaven's come down the word has
[1:48:57] come
[1:48:58] forth the Kingdom of Heaven is
[1:49:03] word but the gospel didn't come in word
[1:49:08] only watch watch it come together the
[1:49:11] gospel didn't come in word only heav is
[1:49:15] the word but the gospel didn't come in
[1:49:17] word
[1:49:18] only Power
[1:49:21] demonstration so if Heaven the Kingdom
[1:49:23] of Heaven is
[1:49:26] word the kingdom of God is power and
[1:49:30] demonstration if the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:49:32] is
[1:49:34] mechanic then the kingdom of God is
[1:49:38] dynamic king of God will make the
[1:49:41] Kingdom of Heaven do what it says it
[1:49:43] will
[1:49:45] do for the kingdom of God is Not meat
[1:49:48] and drink
[1:49:51] but righteous and
[1:49:53] peace and joy in the Holy Ghost the
[1:49:57] kingdom of God is established in the
[1:49:59] heart and soul of a
[1:50:03] man by a revelation of Jesus
[1:50:06] Christ that Upon This Rock I'll build my
[1:50:11] church acts 18 says but ye shall receive
[1:50:15] power after the Holy Ghost has come upon
[1:50:19] you
[1:50:20] shall be a
[1:50:21] witness for and then Luke 16:16 says and
[1:50:24] the law and the prophets were until
[1:50:27] John and since that time the kingdom of
[1:50:30] God is
[1:50:32] preached and every man presseth into
[1:50:38] it Our
[1:50:40] Gospel didn't come in word
[1:50:43] only it didn't come in just the Kingdom
[1:50:46] of
[1:50:48] Heaven watch what he says say this first
[1:50:51] Thessalonians 1:5 Our Gospel came not
[1:50:53] unto you in word
[1:50:56] only this gospel isn't just in the
[1:51:00] Kingdom of Heaven word
[1:51:02] only but also in the power and in the
[1:51:06] Holy Ghost is the kingdom of
[1:51:10] God and in much Assurance as you know
[1:51:13] what manner of men we were among you for
[1:51:14] your
[1:51:16] sake 1 Corinthians 4:20 for the kingdom
[1:51:19] of God is not in
[1:51:23] word but in
[1:51:26] power are we getting somewhere did I
[1:51:28] lose you
[1:51:30] already you want me to I'm done then
[1:51:33] I'll be finished I'll be finished yeah

[1:52:39] where where the Lord was leading me this

[1:53:52] why do you speak unto them in
[1:53:56] Parables a
[1:53:58] parable get this
[1:54:00] please a
[1:54:02] parable we can all repeat this and
[1:54:05] Earthly
[1:54:09] story and the Kingdom of Heaven is all
[1:54:12] about Parables deals with time
[1:54:17] events it's an Earthly story
[1:54:20] but it's got a Heavenly
[1:54:23] meaning there's a parable watch watch
[1:54:26] him bring together the kingdom of God
[1:54:28] and the kingdom of
[1:54:29] heaven here we go watch this now once
[1:54:32] again an Earthly
[1:54:34] story can you repeat after me because
[1:54:36] this is important a parable a parable is
[1:54:40] an Earthly story is an Earthly story
[1:54:42] with a Heavenly meaning why do you
[1:54:45] always preach or talk to to us in
[1:54:48] parable H number one mystery mystery of
[1:54:54] the kingdom
[1:54:55] of watch let's unfold this mystery real
[1:54:59] quick but watch what else it
[1:55:03] means it's the placing of one
[1:55:07] thing by the side of another
[1:55:12] thing
[1:55:14] Parable right Earthly story Heavenly
[1:55:17] meaning let's just say he's the heav
[1:55:20] I'm the
[1:55:21] Earthly it side by
[1:55:26] side oh come on now come on Church
[1:55:28] you're gonna have to pull a little bit
[1:55:30] on this
[1:55:30] one again it's an Earthly
[1:55:34] story Heavenly
[1:55:37] meaning why do you always speak in
[1:55:41] Parable that's what he
[1:55:43] says it's to compare one thing with
[1:55:48] another it's the the likeness or
[1:55:52] similitude it's to illustrate a
[1:55:57] Doctrine what makes and then brother
[1:55:59] Bram says we don't ever compel our women
[1:56:03] to do these
[1:56:07] things we don't compel them to not drink
[1:56:11] or the men to not drink or
[1:56:13] swear we just preached the
[1:56:16] gospel lay down the pattern of the Bible
[1:56:20] come on lay yourself next to the
[1:56:23] word and
[1:56:27] compare well they in that church they
[1:56:30] they make the women have long hair and
[1:56:32] they make them wear skirts and
[1:56:36] dresses do any of you do that I I I
[1:56:40] don't do that brother says we don't
[1:56:42] compel Force you got to do that or
[1:56:44] you're going to go to
[1:56:46] hell say you're going to go to hell if
[1:56:48] you do don't do that
[1:56:50] brother says we don't compel the women
[1:56:52] and the men to act or do a certain
[1:56:54] thing we place the
[1:56:57] pattern it's up to you to get by the
[1:57:02] pattern see am I living according to the
[1:57:06] word come on now Church come on now
[1:57:08] we're all here this is where we all live
[1:57:12] and we got to come next and see is is
[1:57:14] there a likeness between me and the
[1:57:17] word but there comes a point
[1:57:20] at which the word and you have to become
[1:57:24] one it's just the
[1:57:27] parable as long as you're side by
[1:57:30] side but when the word and you become
[1:57:33] one it's no longer just an Earthly story
[1:57:38] Church there's a Heavenly
[1:57:40] meaning to your life and my life that's
[1:57:44] why we want to be get after this morning
[1:57:47] there's a Heavenly meaning this morning
[1:57:50] it's not just an Earthly
[1:57:53] story where Satan gets
[1:57:55] us oh you're just a human being make
[1:57:58] mistakes that's the Earthly
[1:58:01] story that's the Kingdom of
[1:58:03] Heaven the Kingdom of Heaven and the
[1:58:05] kingdom of God come
[1:58:08] together it's now the Earthly
[1:58:10] story and the Heavenly
[1:58:13] meaning coming
[1:58:15] together time and eterni blending
[1:58:19] together
[1:58:21] oh he says men come to the Pentecostal
[1:58:23] faith and the
[1:58:26] Holiness a lot of things but it's not in
[1:58:28] our
[1:58:30] hearts and many women do the
[1:58:33] same we don't tell them what they have
[1:58:35] to
[1:58:41] do have I forced any of you to do
[1:58:45] anything have I forced you to you dress
[1:58:48] this way and you
[1:58:51] blah blah after a after a while it's
[1:58:54] just nothing but
[1:58:56] reformation and the kingdom of God is
[1:58:59] far
[1:59:00] from you're back in the church ages
[1:59:04] somewhere you're lost in
[1:59:08] the you're lost in the pyramid
[1:59:11] somewhere I'll tell
[1:59:14] you the mystery of the
[1:59:18] parable
[1:59:20] Kingdom of
[1:59:22] Heaven your Earthly story has a Heavenly
[1:59:29] meaning what were you waiting for some
[1:59:31] great mystery that's the that's the
[1:59:34] answer number one mystery of the Kingdom
[1:59:37] of
[1:59:39] Heaven your Earthly story has a Heavenly
[1:59:43] me my Earthly
[1:59:46] story has a Heavenly meaning the rest of
[1:59:49] the world don't see that they're living
[1:59:52] their life oh have a good time let's
[1:59:56] just enjoy life today we we live we eat
[1:59:59] and drink tomorrow we
[2:00:01] die Noory or
[2:00:05] meaning because there is no
[2:00:08] theop there's no Heavenly
[2:00:12] representation that you can come next
[2:00:15] to and say wow that theophany
[2:00:20] oh my that theophany is made in the
[2:00:22] image of
[2:00:24] God body like God that's why it's

[2:04:01] God and the kingdom of
[2:04:04] heaven the word begins to do what it

[2:04:08] do and then you understand the
[2:04:12] parable parable of the S parable of the
[2:04:15] of the man that that sold land to buy

[2:04:53] go on and
[2:04:54] on there's too much here

[2:05:17] time
[2:05:21] the Kingdom of Heaven suffers
[2:05:25] violence breaking
[2:05:28] forth or it is entered in by
[2:05:31] force what Rapture is Right Rapture is
[2:05:34] to take by
[2:05:37] force but then it becomes
[2:05:40] clear one last
[2:05:43] scripture it becomes
[2:05:46] clear because the seventh mystery
[2:05:49] is the mystery of God even as
[2:05:53] Christ as the Incarnate fullness of the
[2:05:59] godhead fully
[2:06:02] embodied and godliness is
[2:06:08] restored then I want to just leave you
[2:06:10] with this with this last scripture Micah

[2:43:33] well you may be seated in the presence
[2:43:36] of the
[2:43:44] Lord
[2:43:46] sister Tabitha has a beautiful poem to
[2:43:50] read for her Granda
[2:43:54] today we thought we'd read it at at the
[2:43:58] at the Caps Fellowship Hall but I
[2:44:02] thought it'd be better if we could
[2:44:03] record it today of what God has
[2:44:10] given okay I was just making sure I
[2:44:12] could see you um
[2:44:15] celebrating somebody who's very special
[2:44:17] to me I thought it would be nice if I
[2:44:19] could try to write something for him and
[2:44:21] so I asked the Lord for his help in that
[2:44:23] and asking you shall receive because I
[2:44:25] ended up writing two poems so one is um
[2:44:28] on the tables there in the fellowship
[2:44:30] hall and I'm going to try to read this
[2:44:32] one without crying so puppy dogs and
[2:44:37] rainbows puppy dogs and
[2:44:39] rainbows this is called like
[2:44:42] him I always try but I'm never able to
[2:44:45] express the value of your
[2:44:47] impact world's best grandpa might seem
[2:44:50] like a compliment but with you it's a
[2:44:53] fact being your granddaughter feels like
[2:44:55] I've somehow won first
[2:44:57] prize because when looking at you it's
[2:45:00] like I'm staring at his
[2:45:02] eyes whenever we're together I often
[2:45:05] give a second peek because even though
[2:45:08] you're talking it's him I hear
[2:45:12] speak just to make sure you don't get
[2:45:15] get some crazy thought I'm not saying
[2:45:17] that he's
[2:45:18] Jesus I'm not saying that he's
[2:45:21] not some might think by saying this I'm
[2:45:24] going way out on a limb but I can't help
[2:45:27] it it's not my fault you're just so much
[2:45:29] like
[2:45:30] him growing up with you are some of the
[2:45:33] best times I've had you've been my
[2:45:35] grandpa my example my teacher and
[2:45:39] Dad you taught me about hunting eating
[2:45:42] hot chili and even how to drive
[2:45:45] but mostly you taught me God's word and
[2:45:48] that's what keeps me
[2:45:50] alive now it's not like you always
[2:45:52] spoiled us or even spared the
[2:45:55] rod but love is corrective and through
[2:45:58] you I've known only the love of
[2:46:01] God because there was a young girl cast
[2:46:04] aside and left alone but you took her in
[2:46:07] and cared for her as your
[2:46:09] own and being a witness to your life
[2:46:11] changed her whole
[2:46:14] story
[2:46:18] abandonment and shame replaced by love
[2:46:20] and
[2:46:22] victory similarities between you and
[2:46:24] Christ are not so hard to see because if
[2:46:27] you weren't a god-filled man just where
[2:46:30] would that girl
[2:46:31] be make no mistake all honor and Glory
[2:46:34] go to the Lord but I'm still thankful
[2:46:37] for a vessel in which his Spirit has
[2:46:39] been
[2:46:40] stored in school I had to write about my
[2:46:42] hero of course I wrote about you
[2:46:45] all these years later I'm still writing
[2:46:47] about my hero nothing can change my
[2:46:51] view all this time you've been with us
[2:46:55] how much do we know are we recognizing
[2:46:57] the sacrifice or wondering what's left
[2:47:00] to
[2:47:00] show like Philip telling Jesus show us
[2:47:03] the father and it will suffice while you
[2:47:06] must not have thought it robbery because
[2:47:08] every day you have shown us all Christ I
[2:47:11] love
[2:47:13] you
[2:47:23] wow who could have said that any any
[2:47:28] better amen God bless you Sister tab
[2:47:32] enjoyed
[2:47:33] that and uh yes we do we do love Uncle

[2:48:50] morning I
[2:48:52] uh as hard as it is in one sense I'm
[2:48:55] very happy and honored in another

[2:49:10] young woman in the day and age that we
[2:49:12] live

[2:49:18] girlfriend I don't believe she had
[2:49:20] another
[2:49:21] boyfriend and uh you know you you you
[2:49:24] see what God what God has done and what
[2:49:27] God has has brought
[2:49:31] together when you have the world and the
[2:49:34] way that they live and the way that they
[2:49:35] do things no respect for one
[2:49:38] another no respect for God no respect
[2:49:40] for their
[2:49:43] parents young man and a young woman who
[2:49:46] has stood for God's word and um wow it's
[2:49:50] it's
[2:49:52] possible that's what I want to tell
[2:49:54] everyone here online it's
[2:49:58] possible the Lord to make him number
[2:50:02] one and it's possible to have a life
[2:50:04] worthy of the
[2:50:07] Gospel this the most terrible most
[2:50:10] treacherous time that there
[2:50:13] is so I'm very proud of both of
[2:50:16] them and uh though I fought
[2:50:19] her not in a bad
[2:50:22] way but uh ge I tried to bribe her I I
[2:50:25] got to
[2:50:26] admit I tried to bribe her everybody
[2:50:30] knows but it didn't
[2:50:33] help but uh anyways the time has
[2:50:36] come and uh gesh but we're here and I
[2:50:41] wanna I want to I I saw something the
[2:50:44] other day
[2:50:46] daughter Viola had sent me this but I I
[2:50:49] thought it very very appropriate to read
[2:50:52] this culture says fall in
[2:50:57] love God says walk in
[2:51:00] love because everything that falls
[2:51:03] breaks but everything that grows becomes
[2:51:07] strong culture s says love is a
[2:51:11] feeling God's word says God is
[2:51:13] love
[2:51:15] put him at the
[2:51:16] center culture says marry the person
[2:51:19] that you
[2:51:21] love God says love the person you
[2:51:25] marry and culture says if you find the
[2:51:28] right person you will be
[2:51:32] happy God you be the right
[2:51:37] person but in those things we we realize
[2:51:40] what God's word
[2:51:42] says and uh so we've come to this point
[2:51:46] that brother Elijah he is no longer on
[2:51:48] the
[2:51:51] market Grace is no longer in the
[2:51:54] market and uh he said uh he asked
[2:52:02] her he asked her to marry him on
[2:52:06] Friday what did
[2:52:08] say then have you asked my dad
[2:52:13] yet which is a good answer right yeah
[2:52:17] yeah yeah yeah hey wait a minute there's
[2:52:18] there's
[2:52:19] steps and of course she didn't know that
[2:52:22] we we had already talked the day earlier
[2:52:24] in the
[2:52:25] day and so after that she said said yes
[2:52:30] no stutter if she was she sounded pretty
[2:52:32] sure very sure very sure huh
[2:52:35] okay and so how did he do kind of grade
[2:52:38] do you give him for asking how he
[2:52:40] asked good 100% yeah 100% huh
[2:52:45] [Music]
[2:52:46] hey too excited here GE
[2:52:52] 100% amen and so so can you just kind of
[2:52:55] give us a little I mean tell the people
[2:52:58] a little bit how it
[2:53:00] happened can you tell us a little bit of
[2:53:02] the story like anybody like to know the
[2:53:05] story how how this happened I mean how
[2:53:07] it went
[2:53:09] down whoever either either
[2:53:13] one well we went and ate something first
[2:53:16] is what we did after we went said hey
[2:53:19] we're going to go take a drive on Baylor
[2:53:23] Canyon and if we get lucky we'll see
[2:53:25] something we'll see some deer something
[2:53:26] something cool
[2:53:29] like and so we pulled off the road on a
[2:53:32] good
[2:53:34] spot and when I bought the ring they
[2:53:37] didn't give me a box to go with
[2:53:39] it so I just kept it on an antler like
[2:53:42] the one you can see on the picture there

[2:54:07] me he's got some romantic blood in there
[2:54:11] huh R oh that's great
[2:54:15] so as as hard as it is in one sense it's
[2:54:19] not hard in another
[2:54:22] sense I just have to take my dad hat off
[2:54:25] and put my pastor hat on and that's not
