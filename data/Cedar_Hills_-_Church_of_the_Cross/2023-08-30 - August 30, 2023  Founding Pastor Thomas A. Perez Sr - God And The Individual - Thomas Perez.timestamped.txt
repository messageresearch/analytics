[24:41] you need
[24:42] it is my privilege and honor to
[24:44] introduce our founding Pastor
[24:47] is
[24:51] how many are excited for the word
[24:53] tonight
[24:56] the message the message that was
[24:58] preached was God and the individuals
[25:42] because I want to enter into this theme
[25:45] I won't stay very long
[25:55] but the thing that I want you to see is
[26:00] is a thing that I am seeing
[26:06] I look for total Liberation Deliverance
[26:09] Deliverance
[26:12] I look for a total deliverance from
[26:16] everything
[26:24] Una
[26:25] Liberation complete to look for and find
[26:29] a total Deliverance yes I'll go and Trio
[26:32] is something between I and God
[26:45] aren't you happy that even though we are
[26:48] our Collective body Siempre
[26:50] diosotros Como individuals that always
[26:53] deals with us as individuals
[26:56] not as a collective group
[27:02] it's a collective group it means it
[27:05] encounters or it's grouped up in all the
[27:07] kingdom in in El Reino in the kingdom of
[27:10] God I am plan there is a plan pero I I
[27:13] still constances
[27:15] but there are circumstances in the
[27:18] individual okay
[27:21] that does not permit us to enter into
[27:24] the kingdom is
[27:28] we enter with a lot of difficulties and
[27:31] then you understand me
[27:33] there is many difficulties
[27:37] circumstances and there are many
[27:38] circumstances
[27:43] but we do not go through circumstances
[27:47] the Christian does not circumstances
[27:51] the circumstances don't hinder God
[27:57] but they do hinder you asike
[28:03] Ministries
[28:06] if you want god of the Holy Spirit to
[28:09] come and minister to you as an
[28:13] individuals
[28:15] you at times have to come out of order
[28:20] uh
[28:33] we are going to to encounter something
[28:37] look at something let us see something
[28:39] we are going to see something about God
[28:41] and the individual dios
[28:45] God and the individual who stays
[28:48] individual you are an individual
[28:51] Las Vegas if we go through the pews
[29:00] we are going to find out that each and
[29:02] every one of us has one problem or two
[29:06] problems and maybe there will be
[29:08] problems
[29:13] that the wife does not want to tell the
[29:15] husband
[29:18] the husband to the wife
[29:22] the children or the son to the fathers
[29:28] because maybe they say that their
[29:31] problem is very hard
[29:33] that's fine
[29:36] but tell it to God
[30:02] you can open your Bible to the book of
[30:04] Saint Luke
[30:07] chapter 8 verse 43.
[30:11] Luke 8 43.
[30:16] but before we read Luke 8 43.
[30:23] I want to read verse 41.
[30:28] even though I won't be dealing with
[30:31] verse 41.
[30:34] but you'll notice why I read verse 41
[30:41] and it reads his way
[30:45] everybody ready
[30:49] and behold there came a man named Jairus
[30:53] and he was a ruler of the synagogue and
[30:57] he fell down at Jesus feet and besought
[31:00] him that he would come into his house
[31:14] for he had only one daughter about 12
[31:17] years of age and she lay a dying but as
[31:21] he went the people thronged him
[31:31] I want you to notice
[31:33] that this woman that we're going to read
[31:36] about yes
[31:38] was hearing Jesus and Jairus
[31:42] Jesus
[31:43] and a woman having an initial Blood also
[31:47] 12 years like the 12 years of the
[31:49] daughter Sangre
[32:37] which had spent all her living upon
[32:40] Physicians neither could be healed of
[32:43] anything
[32:48] came to him and touched the border of
[32:52] his garments
[32:56] and immediately her blood stents
[33:04] while while
[33:05] the main the main picture
[33:11] that was
[33:13] focused on by the people
[33:17] because sometimes we tend to look at
[33:21] pictures
[33:26] or seek big things in the message
[33:31] we sometimes worry a lot about Thunders
[33:36] and no Thunders
[33:39] we worry a lot about one Soul two souls
[33:43] or three Souls
[33:46] we worry a lot about return Ministry or
[33:49] no return Ministries
[33:54] but this woman was interested in
[33:58] something besides that President
[34:03] she could not focus
[34:06] on something great and I'll go Grande
[34:10] unless she did the Lesser works
[34:17] you know they they asked brother Branham
[34:20] because brother Branham is quoting the
[34:23] scriptures
[34:25] and he says on the scripture that
[34:29] greater words than this shall they do it
[34:32] is
[34:36] and he says there cannot be any Greater
[34:40] Works than what Jesus did because
[34:45] Jesus but there will be more works
[34:49] because there will be more of US foreign
[34:55] [Music]
[35:00] isn't this that we do greater things it
[35:04] is
[35:06] and brother Branham answered that
[35:09] preacher eleven respond he said do the
[35:12] lesser works first before you attempt
[35:15] the greater word
[35:19] and that's I think that's a great lesson
[35:22] for us
[35:24] a lot of times we want to do great works
[35:29] and we forget the Lesser word
[35:33] we forget how to love one another
[35:38] treat
[35:43] at times it seems like we want to know
[35:46] great things
[35:49] when we forget to heal or ask for our
[35:52] healings
[35:56] this woman was sick
[35:59] she went
[36:42] let me read for you one scripture and
[36:45] we'll keep on
[36:51] The Book of Numbers
[36:54] chapter five
[36:56] do you love the Lord
[36:59] how many want a Deliverance
[37:03] a complete one Liberation total completa
[37:07] and it says this in numbers five
[37:12] the Lord spoke unto Moses saying
[37:17] command the children of Israel that they
[37:20] put out of the camp every leper and
[37:23] everyone that has an issue and whosoever
[37:27] it is defiled by the dead is
[37:38] amen both male and female
[37:47] shall you put them
[37:49] that they defile not their camps
[37:53] in the midst therefore I
[37:57] dwellers
[37:59] did you notice
[38:02] this word is from God how many believe
[38:07] that
[38:08] no one that had an issue
[38:11] no matter what
[38:15] was permitted to come amongst the people
[38:23] today we seem to be real wishy-washy on
[38:27] these things
[38:31] we we have people that defile
[38:36] the temple El Temple and we feel sorry
[38:39] for them
[38:40] and we try to get them maybe back
[38:45] without you knowing if there is some
[38:48] contaminations
[38:52] I don't know if you if you can follow me
[38:54] this this evening
[38:56] but I feel very moved by God to speak on
[38:59] this
[39:02] sometimes God can have a curse on
[39:06] someone
[39:08] and you pray for that
[39:11] Persona prophet of God said you're going
[39:13] to get into trouble
[39:16] we have to be very careful
[39:20] now if if you go and pray for some
[39:39] and
[39:45] you touch them
[39:49] the hospital people
[39:51] hospitals they have signs that say wash
[39:55] your hands with soap and water losses
[40:01] amen amen now if you touch something
[40:07] and you happen to wipe your mouth
[40:12] you can very easily get that germ inside
[40:16] of you
[40:19] gotta be very careful
[40:22] I don't believe the Bible misses it
[40:28] when it says
[40:33] pray for your food
[40:35] and if you touch any deadly things
[40:42] it will not harm you
[40:45] now Eva persona persona has a manchado
[41:19] when when when you speak about you can
[41:22] speak a lot on this concerning bathrooms
[41:25] and what have you they put it
[41:28] because people sometimes don't care
[41:32] and then somebody died
[41:34] and then they ask him what did he die
[41:38] they say we don't know she just died or
[41:41] she just died
[41:43] but God for a reason
[41:47] that maybe you and I don't understand
[41:50] it says when a person has an issue
[41:55] and she sits upon the saddle of a horse
[42:01] and you go and sit on it
[42:05] be known that you have been defiled by
[42:08] that
[42:10] Persona so no person that is
[42:16] should be touching another person
[42:22] the person the person according to the
[42:25] Bible the 15th chapter of The Book of
[42:28] Leviticus
[42:32] that person was not permitted to come to
[42:36] church
[42:39] could not enter into the Tabernacles
[42:44] enter and touch the priests
[42:48] but that
[42:50] Persona if he was sick
[42:54] could come
[42:56] in an interview
[42:59] with the priests
[43:02] and the priest would offer a sin or a
[43:06] burnt offering for their sins
[43:17] would have to live
[43:20] the premises
[43:25] and stay away
[43:28] for seven days
[43:31] until the evening
[43:38] after after seven days
[43:47] and when the priest would look at the
[43:50] issue
[43:53] if
[43:55] it had white with maybe white hair
[43:58] Blanca
[44:01] he sent them out for seven more days
[44:07] you understand
[44:09] seven more days until the evening time
[44:14] and that person is a persona
[44:18] had to return
[44:19] after seven days
[44:22] after seven days
[44:24] the priest would check it again
[44:28] and if he would find a scab you see
[44:32] miraba unna
[44:39] he would Proclaim him clean
[44:44] and stanced blood stands from that is
[44:53] you understand
[44:55] if if you can understand a little of
[44:58] that is
[44:59] you can understand the eighth chapter of
[45:03] the Book of Luke
[45:07] this woman
[45:11] she didn't contact the priest
[45:16] she had no faith
[45:20] anyone that could do that so
[45:24] but in the evening time of our life
[45:28] she encountered that in control so
[45:31] before we get to that
[45:33] will follow a little bit about this
[45:36] woman
[45:38] and this garment is
[45:41] the Persona in this condition is
[45:45] you understand that so when a person has
[45:49] an issue
[45:51] I want you when you go home read the
[45:53] 15th chapter of The Book of Leviticus
[45:58] This Woman's conditions
[46:04] she won't tell anyone that she had an
[46:09] issue
[46:12] if anyone knew that she had an issue
[46:22] it was because
[46:24] maybe the Physicians had told them
[46:29] but she told no soul
[46:32] that's why
[46:35] amongst the crowds
[46:37] multitude because if the crowd would
[46:41] have known she had an issue
[46:46] they would have taken her aside and
[46:48] stoned her to death yes
[46:56] so so more and more the picture builds
[46:59] up into this woman must be the issue is
[47:11] show me a scripture where it says that
[47:15] if you Touch the Hem of the garments
[47:22] that you can be healed
[47:27] you know
[47:29] brother brothers
[47:32] it talks about certain ministers that
[47:34] pray over the radio and television
[47:39] it is and and the thing was this that
[47:45] they would say
[47:47] as I'm praying for you place your hand
[47:50] upon the radio or the television amen
[48:00] foreign
[48:39] she saw a lot of people that had that
[48:42] had garment all the way down to the feet
[48:49] but she wasn't about to touch just
[48:51] anybody's garments
[48:55] she received Faith by hearing a certain
[49:00] individuals
[49:03] and she said if I could just Touch the
[49:06] Hem of His garments
[49:09] she had no scripture for it is
[49:37] era
[50:10] [Music]
[50:17] I wanted to do this
[50:19] and I wanted to do that
[50:23] I knew it was out of order
[50:27] so I didn't do it
[50:32] you understand at the end then
[50:34] oh I
[50:41] but I didn't do it
[50:45] this little woman esta Mujer wasn't like
[50:48] that
[50:50] she said
[50:52] I know you said
[50:56] the Bible or the scriptures
[51:13] looking Echo
[51:16] you can stand it I have a circumstancia
[51:18] she's she's
[51:22] her problems
[51:24] her circumstances
[51:53] no problem
[51:56] people
[51:57] days
[52:00] [Music]
[52:06] [Laughter]
[52:29] individual
[52:35] and that's why many got contaminated
[52:39] because they took like a tomato
[52:46] they should have left it alone
[52:58] this is the way she went yes
[53:04] she got near him yeah
[53:13] brother Branham says
[53:16] was there that virtue on the Garment
[53:22] he said no more virtue than you woman
[53:25] touching the Hem of your skirt no matter
[53:32] no more virtue than you men touching the
[53:35] Hem Of Your Overcoat no matter
[53:40] but where did she pick it up
[53:45] because watch this if a woman says
[53:56] she sits on it she says
[54:08] when she touched on his garments
[54:16] apartment
[54:20] baby
[54:37] [Laughter]
[54:57] there's a way to judge
[55:04] Pizza

[56:56] if that blood is
[57:00] I I was thinking yes
[57:02] in a message that my son preached in
[57:05] Phoenix
[57:12] blood fights blood Sangre
[57:17] well that was what was wrong with my
[57:19] wife Esposa
[57:22] they couldn't give her her own blood
[57:25] cause blood
[57:30] and tell me today
[57:32] if blood doesn't fight blood
[57:36] contamination contamination it's hard
[57:39] Duro
[57:41] but there's Deliverance
[57:44] liberation
[57:47] if we look see miramos to
[57:51] ah
[57:53] Jesus
[57:54] by faith
[57:57] you understand
[57:59] by faith
[58:02] Faith cometh by hearing there being a
[58:05] foreign
[58:09] she heard Jesus talking to Jairus Jesus
[58:14] and she had heard some other things
[58:16] about Jesus
[58:19] but when Jairus said I have a daughter
[58:22] 12 years old
[58:27] that this woman her name was Victoria is
[58:33] don't ask me where I got her name
[58:38] but her name was Victoria Victoria heard
[58:44] Jesus talking to Jairus Victoria Oyo
[58:46] Jesus and when she heard 12 years
[58:51] she she knew that her issue had been
[58:54] there 12 years
[58:58] that did something to Victoria yes
[59:08] he's calling him to heal his daughter
[59:12] that was born when I got the bloody
[59:15] shoes
[59:19] [Music]
[59:26] [Music]
[59:30] and he was he was uh then he was
[59:34] converted to a
[59:36] Baptista but he he was a sinner he would
[59:40] go from the Catholic to the baptism
[59:44] and then back from the Baptist to the
[59:46] Catholics
[59:49] doesn't that remind you of a lot of
[59:51] people in the message
[59:57] because they haven't found it yet or can
[1:00:00] no longer
[1:00:02] well that man's soul brother
[1:00:06] he said Brothers
[1:00:09] he says I want Deliverance so bad
[1:00:15] but I I get prayed foreign
[1:01:24] other people
[1:01:36] [Music]
[1:01:49] when you were a child
[1:02:02] he says why you forget
[1:02:05] okay
[1:02:11] you would always have that on you
[1:02:15] in the church
[1:02:30] where you touched the Hem of His
[1:02:33] garments
[1:02:37] what it is
[1:02:56] that Jesus went to many cities
[1:02:59] and many villages uh
[1:03:21] he said they picked it up from that
[1:03:24] woman
[1:04:26] is
[1:04:38] he says
[1:04:40] she's far away from me she's not
[1:04:43] touching my garments
[1:04:45] but she does
[1:04:48] so he said nothing when you go by the
[1:04:52] garments
[1:04:54] that's physical it was physical but when
[1:04:57] you go through the dressing
