what time it is it's the best time of the service there's nothing like hearing words of living life by god through a man it is called my lot to introduce our our minister for this evening good friend of mine a brother my brother and my friend our brother omar and we'll be introducing the word this evening with one of my favorite songs it is well with my soul i am mad like seeing that and when peace [Music] road [Music] has taught me to say it is [Music] no matter what happens i will always say with my soul knowing the highest [Music] [Music] oh [Music] it's [Music] [Applause] [Music] is

[Applause] [Music] us oh my soul [Music] is [Music] is [Music] god bless the musicians and god bless each and every one of you for being here tonight we we want to get right away into the word i'm not making any promises but i'm i'm going to try to go a different speed tonight so bear with me tonight the bible says and there were four leper leprous men at the entering in of the gate and they said one to the other why sit here until we die let's call may god add his blessings to the reading of the word and you may be seated i i had been wanting to preach a message for for a couple of a couple of months now okay and part of the message and and i i just i just i guess i felt that because i had hit it one way that i maybe i shouldn't do it again and and then and then my uncle caleb said the lord's got some for you today has been the best story i've ever studied and i want to thank the lord tonight the bible tells us that there were four leperous men now i you know of course i don't want to harp on coronavirus i think that gets hit enough you know carolina virus and this was translated as this disease of leprosy now now in the hebrew this word the the surat it it it also made a lot it was it meant like for different diseases it wasn't just for leprosy so so the way this leprosy would start and that's just to give a foundation uh it would start at just the tongue and and and what would happen to to people in biblical times is it just took to say something wrong against what god had placed it was something so small but then it would not just stay there but then we see that we're all in you know social distancing right you couldn't stay with your children anymore you were forced [Music] you couldn't wear what you normally and he couldn't talk to you the only thing that the person with leprosy could say is unclean unclean warning the people don't to take control of my whole life this was something very hard to learn about how could you not have compassion if it was your daughter how could you not have compassion if it was one of you passing in the street and not to be able to say hey how you doing brother you're all right none of this was permitted that saw every miraculous thing of god come to pass but then she got frustrated and if the devil can get you frustrated he's got you he tried to place himself in between god and her el punis did your city bury him lord since you're frustrated oh no oh no she was struck with leprosy for speaking against the man of god and a lot of times people in church do this he's my grandpa i can do whatever i want no no no oh he's my he's my daddy oh it's me papa oh no no nobody could ever talk like that and this is how it seeps in real subtle push everybody else down and look at me the ministry was placed to be able to serve the people and nowadays we complain about everything i have to wear a mask now what are we eating today oh coronavirus shut down my shop what am i going to do oh that evil governor yeah and then the other day on the 15th i was rejoicing you're going to get to stay out a little longer today complain about everything we complain about little things it's a shame when you're a song leader yes people are clocking you at the end of the preaching since when was that position given to you and then we wonder oh business is slow oh and then i went to the altar the other day and i try to get something from the lord i knew that preacher he didn't have it all together because i didn't get it but go a little further when we like to talk about each other behind each would tell you if you were dressed right or not this doesn't work oh no now everybody's so calloused but i have to be in fashion [Music] and the bible is and you wonder why how come god had given me my promise is the promise expired oh no the promise has not expired and he went to [Applause] that so then they said okay let's go this all the way they'll never expect so it got so mad that that the king of the experiences said who is with israel israel guys are you serious and the guy says it's not us elijah he tells the king elisha he even knows what you do in your bed he said we can't beat these guys so then he says let's get them frustrated when they tried to surround elisha before he said there are more forests than there are against nosotros and the mountains we're on fire what the chariots you doubt the man of god [Applause] it's up to us yes sir i believe that's what's called upon you we're getting into it in a very tight time and jesus said make us check our mouth a little bite well this city that's so desperate two women both having a son and both imagine this this is how this is how crazy and i know it's nasty but this is how it goes and this is the way it has to be said one tells the other one today we'll roast your son so this one this is how this is how crazy things get even today i'll explain in a minute i said lord what is the significance of that today but this is what happens doesn't everybody roast each other by their own tongue as long as you're a part of my clique oh yes our children are the best glory to god oh but that did you see did you see what that little boy was doing and they killed the influence of that little boy and even if he comes and repents no no um you know you don't want to know this and everybody likes to say i said man i saw my brother and he was he was praying man it now it's gotten so bad it got to the place that this king the problem was what are we going to do to get rid of this enemy they were wondering how come he won't let me his child who in the right mind would want to see one of our children lost it's only a problem but don't look at me like you ain't done stands oh they're gonna be selling fine flour for a shekel and they're going to be selling barley for two shekels but the servant said so is god going to cut like open the window of heaven and just dump it out or what frustration and the man of god looked at him and he said because of this tomorrow you will see and i know it's hard because i don't want to be this way but i don't care what anybody says and you got to learn how to bite that thing you got to keep it in its mouth a lot of times because one day can you imagine if the coming of the lord comes and something so small as that and you would be watching him come here you will be watching the loved ones come here and they wouldn't visit you is it's not for me i miss my grand mommas so this is what happens or lepers at the gate they said get him we go in the city we're gonna die here we're gonna die [Music] and repent and then the garbage stopped wow so they go he said let's just go to the campus syrians now nowhere in my town you go to the camp of your enemy don't find what you're looking for they for some reason god needs us to go to the camp of the syria puerto vallarta and when they got to the camp of the series of syrians there was no syrian army syrian the horses were still tied up all of the donkeys were tied up they even had just made dinner uh so they went into the tent and began to eat and the bible tells us and they found silver uh do you want that tonight brand new these men didn't go by themselves temple when brother branham says the most deceitful time that the enemy likes to use that against us but the master of that foreign we're all scared like we're on defense all the time what did the pastor say at the beginning of the year it's go time it's time to go into offense or are we just comfortable staying here to die at the gate the bible tells you [Applause] and the i'm leading the charge on this one brother branham says was the sound just the angels he said no no he said it was god going before them they're going to kill us and they never even saw the enemy they only heard them i only heard him coming on the run a lot of times we think oh god just sat there. [Music] yeah sometimes he does that what the one thing he said don't touch my anointing when they messed with god's man twice yes i've never seen the righteous forsaken i've never seen god's seed baiting for bread i'll tell you this i haven't worked in whatever ten weeks or whatever you know my dad can tell you i was like dad i don't know how long i'm gonna last this is a real testimony i'm making a third of what i normally make i can't make money if i don't work do the math does that add up mathematica i haven't worked in 10 weeks i i even told uncle uh i said i'm never going back to work [Applause] look at what god can do for you oh i left something out i barely got that little stimulus checked that 3400 i haven't even put that in there yet so that's added perez perez didn't take
