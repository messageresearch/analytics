[11:39] amen how many love the lord amen amen
[11:49] i'd like to touch a little bit tonight
[11:51] on paul
[11:53] a prisoner of christ

[11:59] exactly what i said
[12:01] paul
[12:03] a prisoner of jesus christ would you all
[12:06] read it with me
[12:08] paul
[12:09] a prisoner of jesus christ
[12:13] what what a thing to be a prisoner he's
[12:17] he's not a prisoner of just anybody
[12:20] but he's a prisoner of jesus christ let
[12:23] us pray
[12:24] our heavenly father we are
[12:27] indeed thankful this
[12:29] evening lord for
[12:31] the opportunity once more
[12:34] to be able to be assembled together
[12:37] we calling it a privilege
[12:40] we know the times will come when
[12:42] this privilege will be taken away from
[12:45] us
[12:46] but as long as we have this privilege
[12:49] it is an honor or to come together
[12:52] and worship you together
[12:55] may this be a revelation to your people
[12:57] that
[12:59] someday they'll look for fellowship
[13:02] and they won't be able to find it
[13:05] they'll look for somebody that
[13:07] just believes the word they they won't
[13:09] be able to find it
[13:11] all you can hear is somebody stepping by
[13:13] your side and
[13:14] shaking their feet stomping their feet a
[13:16] little bit you know that their believers
[13:18] holding on
[13:20] the battle is getting harder
[13:22] every day
[13:24] it's waxing hot
[13:26] hotter
[13:28] it seems like
[13:29] it's getting to degrees of
[13:31] when those hebrew children were in the
[13:34] fiery furnace
[13:36] it just keeps getting hotter and hotter
[13:39] the lord
[13:40] in in spite of all this
[13:42] we hang on because we have a promise
[13:46] and it's really not us holding on more
[13:48] but it's you holding on to us
[13:50] we pray heavenly father this evening
[13:53] that
[13:54] you will be with us and
[13:56] just let your spirit flow through each
[13:58] one of us lord
[14:00] and may we understand that we're not
[14:02] here in church just to pass a few hours
[14:06] and we're here because we're concerned
[14:09] we've been convinced now we're concerned
[14:12] about our welfare of the welfare of the
[14:14] people lord we're here to try lord with
[14:18] everything we have in our power lord
[14:21] to make it
[14:23] it takes you lord we understand that
[14:26] man can do it alone
[14:27] man is not able to do it it takes the
[14:30] holy spirit
[14:31] and i pray dear father that you will
[14:33] quicken this to us
[14:35] and be with us lord and
[14:37] help us father along the way
[14:40] heal the sick of the afflicted in jesus
[14:42] name and you may be seated
[14:46] as you're saying
[14:47] turn your bibles over to the third
[14:49] chapter of the book of the ephesians
[14:52] and it also speaks about
[14:54] paul
[14:55] being a
[14:56] prisoner and he says this in verse 1
[15:00] for this cause i call
[15:03] the prisoner of jesus christ
[15:06] for you
[15:07] gentiles
[15:08] now
[15:10] in
[15:10] uh the have uh earphones been handed out
[15:14] to spanish yeah yes yes all right
[15:17] i want to make sure that everybody gets
[15:19] to eat
[15:21] but you know it's it's quite a word a pr
[15:23] a prisoner of christ now in some of the
[15:26] letters of paul
[15:28] it says paul
[15:30] an apostle of jesus christ
[15:33] in other letters it says paul
[15:36] a servant of jesus christ
[15:39] but when he writes this letter to
[15:41] filament
[15:43] he addresses it
[15:45] as paul
[15:46] a prisoner of christ
[15:49] and
[15:50] when he wrote this letter
[15:53] paul was in jail
[15:56] he was
[15:57] in jail and
[15:59] and
[16:00] he could well understand by his position
[16:04] what the word man
[16:06] that
[16:07] when he was surrounded by mars you know
[16:09] what how jail looks
[16:11] but
[16:12] he could only be free
[16:15] if someone
[16:16] made him free or let him free
[16:20] we have incidents in the bible where
[16:22] uh
[16:23] man of god and mostly all men of god
[16:27] have either served in jail at one time
[16:29] or the other
[16:30] john the baptist paul silas and peter
[16:34] and what have you and john
[16:36] take him to the isle of patmos
[16:39] and uh they were all there
[16:42] under
[16:43] in what we would call today federal
[16:45] prisons
[16:46] but
[16:47] here is
[16:49] a man
[16:51] put in jail
[16:52] because
[16:54] of what he believed
[16:56] and uh it go very well with a regular
[16:59] trend on what
[17:01] he delivered
[17:03] the regular trend there was
[17:06] the orthodox religion
[17:08] and it was the turning of the corner of
[17:10] the dispensation
[17:12] but it was very hard
[17:14] for them to see it and
[17:16] the high priest they they thought that
[17:18] this
[17:19] group of people called christians were a
[17:22] cult
[17:23] so
[17:24] paul being
[17:25] one of them
[17:26] was very a very persecuted man very
[17:30] persecuted
[17:33] by
[17:34] religion and
[17:36] federal government
[17:37] under roman rule we understand that
[17:39] but
[17:40] here we find paul
[17:43] in such a such a predicament in iran in
[17:46] a prison and he's saying a prisoner of
[17:48] christ now
[17:50] i don't believe
[17:53] and you know you know why i say that
[17:55] that i don't believe
[17:57] that paul
[17:58] was addressing this letter to philemon
[18:02] about his present condition
[18:04] his present condition was
[18:06] that he was in jail he wasn't referring
[18:09] to that
[18:10] but i believe he was referring to his
[18:14] being
[18:15] his spirit his will
[18:18] being a prisoner to the lord jesus
[18:21] christ
[18:22] and uh let me just before i get started
[18:25] how many of you would love like to be a
[18:27] prisoner of jesus christ
[18:30] don't be so hasty in raising your hands
[18:34] it's not easy to be a prisoner
[18:36] to be behind bars
[18:38] but like i said i don't i do not believe
[18:40] that here when he said
[18:42] a prisoner of jesus christ he is
[18:44] referring to his physical being
[18:47] but he is referring to his will
[18:50] first of all to get started
[18:54] we understand that as
[18:56] men and women we are under a free moral
[18:58] agency
[19:00] and it has to be that way
[19:03] for you to choose
[19:05] whether you want to serve or you don't
[19:07] want to serve
[19:08] whether you want to follow death or you
[19:10] want to follow life
[19:12] and it has to be upon the same basis
[19:15] that he placed adam and eve
[19:18] and if it isn't under those bases well
[19:22] then
[19:23] god isn't just
[19:25] but god being just
[19:28] he places you and i
[19:31] understand i want you to hold that word
[19:33] because later
[19:35] this
[19:36] passage of scripture might confuse you a
[19:38] little bit it confuses and dumbfounds
[19:42] theologians
[19:43] such as such as to femoral agency well
[19:46] in criminal agency you have a choice
[19:50] but we'll find out later what choice
[19:53] paul had
[19:54] when he became a prisoner amen and it
[19:57] gets
[19:58] quite tremendous when you when you read
[20:00] this
[20:01] now right and wrong is set before us
[20:05] just like i said adam and eve
[20:08] and
[20:09] the whole human race
[20:12] was under what we call the penalty of
[20:15] death
[20:16] we we were we were
[20:18] condemned to die we had no way out
[20:22] but
[20:23] god came down in the form of a man
[20:28] to take away that sting of death
[20:32] and place under free moral agency
[20:35] he placed on a free knowledge agency for
[20:38] you and i to make a decision
[20:42] now
[20:43] decision
[20:45] uh is decisions are hard to make
[20:49] we we we stand like in the valley of
[20:52] decisions and man we get up in the
[20:54] morning we have to decide whether we're
[20:56] going to put on our socks or we're not
[20:58] that's why you see a lot of people that
[20:59] don't wear socks they don't want to put
[21:01] them on
[21:02] hey you gotta you gotta
[21:05] decide whether you're gonna wash your
[21:07] face and comb your hairs while you find
[21:08] other people never comb their hair
[21:10] they decided to come their hair
[21:13] and you're gonna decide whether you're
[21:14] to eat breakfast or you're not
[21:17] then you've got every minute that passes
[21:20] by there are decisions to be made
[21:25] it's time for church we have to decide
[21:27] whether we want to go to church or we
[21:30] don't want to go to church
[21:32] right you have you have a right to
[21:34] choose yes you don't have to come to
[21:37] church
[21:38] people say you should be in church you
[21:40] don't have to go to church
[21:41] you're a female agent you can stay home
[21:44] and watch i love lucy
[21:48] but
[21:49] we choose to be here
[21:51] we we are i believe we're all here
[21:53] because we wanted to be here right well
[21:56] that's either a free moral agency
[21:59] and you choose to serve god
[22:01] you choose to serve god
[22:04] you you know the the church world knows
[22:06] no matter what church they go to the
[22:09] anyone that is called christian knows
[22:11] that jesus christ died on the cross
[22:15] is that right or is that wrong
[22:17] anyone that is called a christian knows
[22:19] that jesus christ died on the cross
[22:21] now they have to decide
[22:24] if they're going to follow him
[22:27] they have to decide what church they're
[22:29] going to go to
[22:31] they have to make a decision what
[22:33] they're going to believe
[22:35] amen and you have to decide it's a
[22:38] decision and nobody can make for you you
[22:41] got to make it by yourself
[22:44] you can bring your children to church
[22:46] but when they grow old or get older
[22:48] they'll go if they want to
[22:50] and usually they don't have a new
[22:52] birthday in the church they're going to
[22:53] go out into the world no matter how much
[22:55] you bring them to church they got to get
[22:57] that new birthday amen
[23:00] but we find out that
[23:02] each one of us must choose
[23:05] we must
[23:06] choose death
[23:09] or life
[23:11] do you know that life or
[23:14] and death
[23:15] in our lives
[23:17] our lives are just a shadow
[23:21] and you know what
[23:22] brings a shadow is a certain degree of
[23:25] darkness and a certain degree of light
[23:27] man that's what creates a shadow so we
[23:30] walk
[23:31] in the valley
[23:32] of the shadow of death
[23:35] but the real light
[23:38] we see what is called cosmo life
[23:41] this this cosmo we we have access to the
[23:44] cosmoline
[23:45] but but that there's another light which
[23:48] is god's life that is not that's not
[23:50] cosmo that's zoe and we've heard that
[23:53] over and over
[23:54] now when that light is present
[23:58] darkness cleans there's no there's no
[24:01] darkness that can stand there there's no
[24:04] darkness can stand there when it in
[24:06] cosmo you can bring a shadow
[24:09] it creates a shadow through different
[24:11] things and a certain degree of darkness
[24:14] with light creates the shadow
[24:17] but you can be soundlessly and you can
[24:20] wake up in the middle of the night and
[24:22] if you happen to see the light of god
[24:24] you see zoe it it has
[24:27] no boundaries as far as darkness
[24:30] it makes darkness
[24:32] go away
[24:33] and that's something great have you ever
[24:35] seen a light
[24:37] i have
[24:39] many people have some never seen life
[24:43] but i've seen i've seen a light
[24:46] and
[24:47] the greatest light i've seen is the
[24:48] light that has struck my heart
[24:51] now
[24:52] your life
[24:53] my life your life will prove what side
[24:57] you're on
[24:59] your proof outside you're on
[25:01] now
[25:02] reason i i make this statement
[25:05] is to maybe amplify a little bit on the
[25:08] condition of the apostle paul
[25:10] now
[25:11] paul
[25:13] [Music]
[25:14] as far as
[25:16] being a christian he was not a christian
[25:20] paul was a jew
[25:23] but hadn't come into christianity
[25:27] he hadn't seen this thing about
[25:29] christianity yet paul
[25:31] believed there was a god he he he served
[25:35] god his way
[25:36] [Music]
[25:37] you understand
[25:39] catch all this
[25:41] he served god his way
[25:44] he was a very trained man he was a
[25:46] scholar
[25:48] but
[25:50] the life that he had
[25:53] proved what side he was on
[25:57] paul had never come in contact with the
[26:00] light
[26:02] paul had gone to
[26:05] to school
[26:06] from the age of eight years old to the
[26:09] age of 35
[26:11] he had studied
[26:13] under a great man like he manial
[26:15] [Music]
[26:16] he was a great man
[26:19] he was a god-fearing man but he hadn't
[26:21] seen the light
[26:23] he didn't know anything about jesus
[26:27] all he knew that there was a set called
[26:29] christians
[26:31] that followed
[26:32] a man that was here on earth called
[26:35] jesus
[26:36] that's all he knew
[26:38] so the light that is that he had showed
[26:41] what side he was on he was on the side
[26:45] of the manual and the sanhedrin
[26:47] that was paul on the road
[26:51] most of the new testament
[26:52] the letters
[26:54] but
[26:58] in
[27:00] in seeing this you think i'm stuttering
[27:02] but there's a reason for it
[27:05] reserving a little bit here but
[27:08] in studying this life of paul
[27:11] and
[27:13] how he was a prisoner
[27:16] is something to behold
[27:20] as christians
[27:23] we we
[27:24] sometimes judge
[27:26] our lives
[27:29] by how much power we seem to possess
[27:33] or by how many miracles can be done in
[27:36] our ministry
[27:37] [Music]
[27:39] or by how much knowledge we have of the
[27:42] word
[27:44] so you you find
[27:46] you find theologians throughout the
[27:49] country the bible bookstores are full of
[27:52] books
[27:53] on commentaries by different men
[27:57] in their viewpoint of how
[28:00] they think things should be run
[28:04] they have their school
[28:07] they have their thought they have their
[28:09] ideas they have their theology
[28:11] on how things should be run
[28:15] gives you their opinion on how things
[28:18] should be run
[28:19] paul was trained under that on how
[28:22] things should be run
[28:25] paul was a very ambitious man
[28:28] aside from being very smart and in
[28:32] intelligent person
[28:33] trained under gamil
[28:36] paul was a man that
[28:38] had ambitions
[28:40] and one of the ambitions that he had was
[28:42] to someday be a priest
[28:44] and someday maybe be the high priest
[28:47] that was his ambition
[28:49] so paul had favor with the sanhedrin
[28:53] he found favor with the clergy of his
[28:55] day
[28:56] but his life proved
[28:58] what side he was on
[29:01] and
[29:02] at that age
[29:04] when
[29:04] he had studied and
[29:06] he was
[29:07] under
[29:08] this clergy
[29:09] he was a very well trusted man
[29:12] that's the reason that they gave paul
[29:15] the power and documents to go to
[29:19] damascus
[29:21] and you read it in the bible how he went
[29:23] to damascus
[29:24] and he went to damascus
[29:27] he went
[29:28] because he was given authority to bind
[29:32] to bring
[29:34] back to jerusalem
[29:36] these little groups called christians
[29:38] bring them back
[29:40] so paul went
[29:42] to damascus and not only that but
[29:45] he was also given
[29:47] the authority to heal anyone that
[29:50] resisted him he had authority to
[29:52] kill so paul
[29:56] he thought
[29:57] he was doing god a service
[29:59] he was trained
[30:01] he believed in god he chose to follow
[30:04] god
[30:06] but
[30:07] there's one thing that paul had never
[30:09] encountered he had never encountered
[30:11] that purifier
[30:13] he knew nothing about christianity
[30:16] he knew about god as far as the
[30:19] hebrew law
[30:22] as far as the hebrew he said i am a
[30:24] hebrew of hebrews
[30:26] born of the tribal benjamin
[30:29] circumcised the eighth day
[30:32] he knew the law he was a zealous man
[30:35] but the time came when
[30:37] paul
[30:38] going and thinking he was doing kind of
[30:40] service he takes he gets on his on his
[30:43] horse and he goes with his man and he
[30:45] goes toward damascus
[30:47] but he's to his surprise that as he was
[30:50] nearing damascus
[30:52] finally
[30:54] not
[30:55] not a shadow
[30:57] not a cosmic light amen but a light from
[31:00] heaven
[31:01] a bitter fire
[31:08] persecuted by me
[31:11] and he said lord
[31:13] pour thou
[31:14] he said i am jesus my whom thou
[31:19] persecuted
[31:21] you know what jesus did to him
[31:24] you want to be a prisoner of jesus
[31:25] christ
[31:26] you know what jesus did to him
[31:28] he blinded him yes
[31:31] he put his eyes out
[31:33] yeah jesus we served put his eyes out
[31:37] and said paul we're solved
[31:41] he said you are to go
[31:44] to a street
[31:46] whole street i got a straight job
[31:50] you've got to let a prophet come and
[31:52] note your eyes
[31:56] paul
[31:57] when he was there
[31:58] how the holy spirit came upon in an eye
[32:01] of the prophet he came and anointed him
[32:04] and we find it as he had anointed paul
[32:09] that
[32:11] paul's
[32:12] paul's eyes were open to something that
[32:15] he had never seen before
[32:19] he knew about god
[32:21] to a degree
[32:23] to a certain degree
[32:25] you couldn't touch him concerning the
[32:27] law
[32:29] you you look at his books and read his
[32:31] books on to the romans the corinthians
[32:34] thessalonians hebrew
[32:36] and i said hebrew because there are some
[32:37] theologians don't think that he wrote
[32:39] the book of hebrews but i believe he
[32:40] wrote the secret hebrews and so on so
[32:43] how he wrote letters most of them
[32:45] dictated by a man well he would dictate
[32:48] they would write for him
[32:49] but he would write these letters
[32:53] and paul how he expounds her the the
[32:57] the hebrew law and
[32:59] he he says zealous
[33:01] concerning the law he said no one was
[33:04] more zealous than i was
[33:06] so paul was a tremendous tremendous man
[33:12] and
[33:12] i i find an interesting thing here that
[33:16] that uh
[33:17] and i could attribute to my life as far
[33:19] as religion
[33:21] we we're all born with religion one form
[33:24] or the other
[33:26] we all come from different backgrounds
[33:28] whether catholic presbyterian protestant
[33:31] whatever
[33:32] and we come and
[33:34] we we know what our fathers taught us
[33:38] we we love god because we we we've
[33:41] learned there is a god
[33:42] and we learn to love him to a certain
[33:44] degree
[33:46] but as far as
[33:47] really being apprehended
[33:50] a lot of people haven't been apprehended
[33:52] by this thing
[33:54] so they remain religious
[33:56] but paul was apprehended
[33:59] and when he his eyes were open
[34:02] i believe that that paul
[34:05] attended a lot of the services of a man
[34:07] called peter
[34:09] and he would sit there and hear him
[34:12] and he said this is tremendous
[34:14] the way he places this why gamaliel
[34:17] never placed it like this well there may
[34:20] not be nothing about this
[34:22] because this was the start of
[34:24] christianity yes and the other
[34:27] orthodox
[34:29] ways the religion
[34:31] didn't show this
[34:33] it pointed as a type to a deliverer
[34:37] but when the deliverer came israel never
[34:40] knew him
[34:41] israel never accepted him just a handful
[34:44] bible says about 120
[34:46] but they began to grow
[34:48] they began to grow and that's what
[34:50] frightened the jewish people the
[34:52] sanhedrin the priests and everything
[34:55] that they
[34:57] had to put a stop to all of this
[34:59] but here we find paul
[35:02] he said this is tremendous
[35:04] until one day paul wouldn't take it no
[35:05] more
[35:06] and he says i've got to find out for
[35:08] myself
[35:09] all these things
[35:11] why
[35:12] why
[35:13] he
[35:14] intercepted
[35:16] why
[35:18] god
[35:19] did not permit me to fulfill my ambition
[35:25] you know what ambition is
[35:28] it means a desire to have honor
[35:31] or power
[35:32] or position
[35:34] such as in a career
[35:38] it's a desire that's from webster's
[35:41] and
[35:42] in this
[35:43] he went to the desert we believe he went
[35:45] to the desert of arabia man he studied
[35:48] for three and a half years
[35:50] and one day he said i come to the
[35:53] visions
[35:54] and the revelations
[35:56] of the lord jesus christ
[35:59] and
[36:00] how the lord
[36:01] comes to him
[36:04] in such a way
[36:05] that
[36:06] the ambition that was in him
[36:10] and let's face it we all have ambition
[36:12] to do things somebody had an ambition
[36:14] because there's people without ambition
[36:16] some people have demolished
[36:19] no objective in life
[36:21] why they're alive
[36:23] why they're here
[36:24] i'm a christian i'm i'm supposed to go
[36:26] to church and warm a bench all i know
[36:29] about god is more adventurous
[36:31] amen
[36:33] can say amen
[36:35] that's the truth
[36:37] no ambition
[36:38] but this man had a bishop that's why he
[36:41] went
[36:43] to damascus
[36:45] but when that light hit him
[36:48] it changed
[36:50] paul or saul
[36:51] which his name was given then
[36:54] from saul
[36:55] to paul
[36:57] and the lord says
[36:59] i'll show you
[37:01] how much you have to suffer
[37:07] you will suffer for my name
[37:11] it's easy
[37:12] i tell people it's easy to go to church
[37:16] i don't want to go to church
[37:18] it's easy to pick times
[37:21] it's easy to give your offering
[37:25] it's hard
[37:26] when
[37:27] [Music]
[37:28] you
[37:29] come across
[37:30] this line and something more
[37:32] is demanded of you
[37:36] you have
[37:37] you you hear young people especially
[37:40] especially
[37:41] well i'm going to go to school i'm going
[37:43] to be a teacher
[37:45] i'm going to be
[37:46] i'm going to be a musician
[37:49] i'm going to be a great salesman
[37:52] i'm going to be this or that well that's
[37:54] their ambition
[37:57] that's what their ambitions drive into
[38:01] and our ambitions
[38:05] i had ambitions
[38:07] there was things i wanted to do
[38:10] you know there are many many times to be
[38:13] a pastor is not easy
[38:16] there's many many times you you feel
[38:18] like going away from it
[38:21] you feel you feel like getting away from
[38:22] it all
[38:26] because it's hard
[38:28] very hard
[38:30] to minister and not just minister but
[38:33] mainly to be a pastor
[38:34] i've been a pastor almost 27 years
[38:38] and it ain't getting no easier
[38:40] but
[38:42] there's one thing experience
[38:45] and with the lord
[38:47] it helps us along the way to be able to
[38:50] cope with the situation
[38:53] so it's not easy
[38:55] so then would it be easy for for a man
[38:58] like me just to forget about it and
[39:01] go get my barber tunes working hours
[39:03] like you know and go home and take it
[39:05] easy
[39:06] it would be easy
[39:08] very easy
[39:10] people work eight hours and they go oh
[39:12] i'm so tired
[39:14] i'm trying to hit it for 24
[39:16] see how tired you are for you can't
[39:18] sleep
[39:20] for the whole burn of the church and
[39:22] people is upon you
[39:24] and it gets hard
[39:25] but how can a man do that is the
[39:28] question how can a man do that except he
[39:33] be a prisoner
[39:35] amen
[39:36] and
[39:37] and here is where i begin to see this
[39:40] portion of scripture
[39:41] that
[39:42] i look at it
[39:43] and uh i see
[39:45] paul
[39:46] being a prisoner he's not talking about
[39:48] being in a in a little jail which he was
[39:52] but he's not speaking about that he was
[39:55] a prisoner to his will
[39:58] he had a will
[39:59] he had ambition
[40:01] he had in him something that he wanted
[40:04] to excel he wanted to be a priest and
[40:07] maybe a high priest
[40:09] when jesus comes across him
[40:12] you understand me
[40:13] jesus comes and the light comes
[40:16] yes
[40:17] ask you a question
[40:19] was he a free roll agent when jesus
[40:22] called in
[40:23] right wow think about it before you
[40:26] answer was he a free moral agent could
[40:29] he choose no
[40:32] god knew
[40:33] that he had already chosen to serve god
[40:37] and
[40:38] point number one
[40:39] man point number two is that god knew
[40:43] that paul even though he was intelligent
[40:46] didn't know how to serve god
[40:50] so god apprehended him he arrested him
[40:55] man that's why he says in the book of
[40:57] philippians
[40:59] for which i have been
[41:01] apprehended or arrested
[41:04] it wasn't free moral agency no more my
[41:06] my mind it was god showing mercy to a
[41:10] man called paul
[41:12] and in his mercy he places a yoke on him
[41:17] and fatters
[41:20] and he was chained
[41:22] where paul
[41:23] could not no more do his will
[41:27] but it was the will of god that he had
[41:29] to do
[41:30] god led paul
[41:33] he led him
[41:35] with a harness
[41:39] and folding
[41:40] so that he
[41:41] could go to the gentiles
[41:45] do you think that a jew would go to a
[41:47] gentile
[41:50] paul he didn't want to go to the
[41:51] gentiles
[41:53] he said i've never eaten anything that's
[41:55] that's
[41:56] that's uh filthy
[41:59] common
[42:00] nothing of this i'm never in these
[42:03] things
[42:04] but what did the lord tell you
[42:06] what god has cleaned let no man call
[42:08] unclean
[42:09] man
[42:10] jews didn't associate with gentiles
[42:12] they're called dogs
[42:14] and here peter
[42:17] had to be given a vision and then the
[42:19] same vision was given that was given to
[42:21] the the tenor
[42:23] it was the same thing
[42:25] that peter understood that god had
[42:28] opened the way for the gentiles but the
[42:31] gentiles still was left without
[42:34] knowledge of the lord jesus christ
[42:37] so god had to arrest
[42:40] every hand of them
[42:42] that loved god but didn't know how to
[42:44] serve him
[42:46] and let's get ahold of him
[42:49] because let me tell you one thing you
[42:51] think it's man seeking for god
[42:54] never does a man seek for god he's got
[42:57] seeking men adam adam where are they
[43:03] as far as choosing to go to church and
[43:05] serving god sure a man under that free
[43:08] moral agency does that
[43:11] but when you're apprehended by the lord
[43:13] jesus christ where you're taken from
[43:15] your comfort zone you have a comfort
[43:17] zone
[43:19] and you don't want to move from this
[43:20] comfort zone because it's easy to go
[43:22] with a trend and be in a comfort zone
[43:25] but when god ruffles those feathers of
[43:28] that nest
[43:29] makes you move
[43:31] and why do you do it because he's got
[43:33] chains on you chains of love you love
[43:37] him so much that you just want to keep
[43:39] on keeping on
[43:42] when things get higher in the church
[43:44] when things get unbearable in the church
[43:47] when you see man and woman pretending to
[43:50] be christians living the life they leave
[43:52] and whatever
[43:54] and it gets so hard
[43:56] sure you feel like running away but a
[43:59] true shepherd won't run
[44:01] the hiding will run
[44:04] but what makes you stand
[44:06] because you have so much knowledge no
[44:08] sir because you are a prisoner
[44:12] you are becoming prisoner of the lord
[44:14] jesus christ amen and he places a yoke
[44:18] upon you and he says my yoke is easy
[44:22] and my bird is light
[44:25] sometimes i wonder
[44:27] because the load sometimes it ain't
[44:29] light
[44:30] but i know the word is right
[44:33] so i have to go back
[44:34] and put this carnal man to the side and
[44:37] say
[44:38] it's not you son
[44:40] it's jesus
[44:42] notice another
[44:43] point there
[44:46] was
[44:47] [Music]
[44:48] paul
[44:49] persecuting
[44:51] jesus
[44:52] literally
[44:54] when i say literally i mean this
[44:57] was jesus christ
[44:59] in corporal form
[45:03] then who was all persecuted
[45:05] he was persecuting his church
[45:09] the body of believers
[45:11] and jesus said that's enough
[45:13] don't you touch them
[45:16] that's enough
[45:19] you're not supposed to persecute this
[45:22] people
[45:23] my name is in this
[45:27] you're persecuting me paul when you
[45:30] touch these people
[45:32] it is i
[45:35] it is i
[45:37] nobody else
[45:40] and when we see
[45:41] see that
[45:42] and we see the road
[45:44] and the troubles that we have
[45:47] on the road
[45:49] and everything else
[45:52] we know it's got to be jesus
[45:55] and how many of you
[45:57] would love to just have those chains of
[46:00] love placed upon your heart
[46:03] but here's what's going to happen
[46:06] here's what's going to happen
[46:08] you got to go or you don't want to go
[46:12] did you hear me you've got to go where
[46:15] you don't want to go
[46:17] you've got to do something but you don't
[46:19] want to do it
[46:22] you gotta
[46:23] say things sometimes that you don't want
[46:26] to
[46:26] say and when the people throw at you
[46:31] it's not you looking for that
[46:33] it's jesus
[46:35] it hasn't changed
[46:37] since the day
[46:39] it remains
[46:40] the same man amen
[46:43] what what a tremendous thing that
[46:46] that
[46:48] he just
[46:49] addresses this paul
[46:52] a prisoner
[46:54] of christ i am
[46:56] a prisoner
[46:58] a prisoner
[47:01] that is
[47:02] bound
[47:03] in chains of love
[47:06] he loved jesus so much
[47:08] when he got the revelation of what it
[47:10] was
[47:12] that his chains
[47:14] didn't mean nothing
[47:16] why
[47:17] did god change him
[47:21] what if god took his chains away from
[47:24] you
[47:25] don't you think that you would go back
[47:28] to your ambition
[47:30] fulfill your ambition right
[47:33] so it becomes not no more
[47:36] will the decisions come short
[47:38] just a little thought
[47:41] what would it be
[47:43] tremendous
[47:46] to know that
[47:48] he loves us
[47:53] how much do you love him
[47:55] how much do you find against him
[47:59] would you stand to your feet
[48:01] how much did we find all right
[48:04] how much do we do
[48:08] if he told you right now
[48:10] [Music]
[48:12] go to a certain place
[48:15] or i have a word for you to do
[48:17] would you go all
[48:21] [Music]
[48:28] people ask me at times
[48:30] why do you go to different places
[48:32] i have to
[48:35] why do you do this i have to do it
[48:38] do you have to do it yes i have to do it
[48:42] no you're a free moral agent brother
[48:45] oh no
[48:46] i used to be a formal agent
[48:49] i'm not no more informal agency
[48:52] my will
[48:53] is his will
[48:56] whatever he says
[48:58] there we do
[49:00] [Music]
[49:01] less than that
[49:03] and until we get to that place
[49:06] yes
[49:07] we have chosen to serve god
[49:11] god we love god
[49:14] but our knowledge and the revelation of
[49:17] jesus christ
[49:18] still hasn't come out
[49:20] all right
[49:21] we can do
[49:23] be like the rich young ruler
[49:25] know the commandments that's fine
[49:29] he said but one thing i liked
[49:31] [Music]
[49:33] pick up your cross
[49:34] [Music]
[49:37] he could do it
[49:39] he could do anything else
[49:42] sell the goods
[49:44] give it to the poor
[49:46] take out your cross
[49:48] follow me
[49:49] no sir
[49:50] his ambition was too great in his
[49:52] possessions
[49:54] [Music]
[49:56] let us not fall into that
[49:59] let us be willing
[50:01] to give god
[50:03] what is god
[50:05] and to serve him
[50:07] and he know that we love him
[50:09] choose to love him
[50:14] [Music]
[50:22] i want you to serve mexico
[50:26] [Music]
[50:37] because your ambition leads you do other
[50:39] things but if you haven't
[50:42] you say
[50:43] yes
[50:45] before you let me
[50:47] i will follow
[50:48] why
[50:50] because i am
[50:57] [Music]
[51:06] get up get away and get by just playing
[51:10] church
[51:11] coming to church and saying we love god
[51:14] by all people most old people love god
[51:19] but one day you say
[51:20] you said why
[51:22] do you say you love me
[51:25] but yet you don't do what i tell you to
[51:27] do
[51:28] how can you say that that you love me
[51:31] the lord is i look to the scriptures
[51:34] i find myself sometimes one people
[51:38] lay in the balance
[51:40] and i say lord
[51:42] it's not my will lord
[51:45] but let your will be done
[51:47] be lord in my heart
[51:50] not just a savior
[51:52] but lord
[51:54] come into my heart lord
[51:56] and lead me
[51:57] wherever you need there i will follow
[52:01] and as we grow more along the road
[52:04] knowing
[52:06] that you're always there with us a lot
[52:09] what a revelation that this
[52:11] my brother paul god has
[52:14] as he wrote to philip
[52:16] he said paul i paul
[52:19] a prisoner
[52:21] of jesus christ
[52:23] i am found by feathers of love
[52:26] i have a hardness upon me
[52:29] where he leads me
[52:31] towards the gentiles
[52:33] for long
[52:34] the jews
[52:36] refused to hear the gospel
[52:38] so
[52:39] i turned to the gentiles seeing that
[52:42] they find themselves not worthy to
[52:44] receive such greater message
[52:48] lord in this end time
[52:50] it has been no different
[52:52] we've seen the evening lights come
[52:55] seen a prophet visit our generation
[52:58] people say
[53:00] there ain't no more problems
[53:03] there ain't no more of this
[53:05] but as i look to your word
[53:07] you say people on the side
[53:10] keep on
[53:14] the world knows nothing about this
[53:16] they fight
[53:18] there's so much fighting on
[53:21] the world point of our church is falling
[53:23] apart
[53:24] there's one thing that remains
[53:27] your word shall never fail
[53:30] because in the beginning it was the word
[53:33] the word was with god
[53:36] and the word was
[53:38] god
[53:39] and the word was made flesh and he
[53:42] dropped among us
[53:45] lord
[53:46] what a thing
[53:48] when you say the world see us be no more
[53:52] but you shall see me
[53:54] for i personal pronoun i will be with
