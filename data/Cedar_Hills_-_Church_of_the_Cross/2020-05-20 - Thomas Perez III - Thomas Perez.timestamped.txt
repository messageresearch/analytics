[21:56] god bless the musicians

[22:01] for being here tonight
[22:05] we we want to get right away into the
[22:07] word
[22:10] i'm not making any promises
[22:15] but i'm i'm going to try to go a
[22:16] different speed tonight
[22:22] so bear with me tonight
[22:39] the bible says and there were four leper
[22:42] leprous men at the entering in of the
[22:44] gate
[22:49] and they said one to the other why sit
[22:51] here until we die let's call
[22:58] may god add his blessings to the reading
[23:00] of the word and you may be
[23:06] seated i
[23:09] i had been wanting to preach a message
[23:11] for for a couple of a couple of months
[23:14] now okay
[23:15] and part of the message and and i i just
[23:18] i just i guess i felt that because i had
[23:20] hit it one way that i maybe i shouldn't
[23:22] do it again
[23:28] and and then and then my uncle caleb
[23:30] said
[23:33] the lord's got some for you
[23:40] today has been the best story i've ever
[23:42] studied
[23:45] and i want to thank the lord tonight
[23:48] the bible tells us that there were four
[23:51] leperous men
[23:55] now i you know of course i don't want to
[23:57] harp on coronavirus i think that gets
[23:59] hit enough you know carolina virus
[24:16] and this was translated as this disease
[24:18] of leprosy
[24:23] now now in the hebrew
[24:26] this word the the surat
[24:28] it it it also made a lot it was it meant
[24:32] like for different diseases it wasn't
[24:34] just for leprosy
[24:41] so so the way this leprosy would start
[24:44] and that's just to give a foundation
[24:48] uh
[24:48] it would start at just the tongue
[24:52] and and and what would happen to to
[24:55] people in biblical times
[24:58] is it just took to say something wrong
[25:01] against what god had placed
[25:06] it was something so small
[25:08] but then it would not just stay there
[25:12] but then
[25:34] we see that we're all in you know social
[25:37] distancing right
[25:50] you couldn't stay with your children
[25:52] anymore
[25:54] you were forced
[26:04] [Music]
[26:07] you couldn't wear what you normally
[26:35] and he couldn't talk to you
[26:38] the only thing that the person with
[26:40] leprosy could say
[26:44] is unclean
[26:46] unclean
[26:48] warning the people
[26:50] don't
[27:02] to take control of my whole life
[27:16] this was something very hard to learn
[27:18] about
[27:27] how could you not have compassion if it
[27:29] was your daughter
[27:32] how could you not have compassion if it
[27:34] was one of you passing in the street and
[27:36] not to be able to say hey how you doing
[27:38] brother
[27:39] you're all right
[27:44] none of this was permitted
[28:27] that saw every miraculous thing of god
[28:30] come to pass
[28:33] but then she got frustrated
[28:36] and if the devil
[28:38] can get you frustrated
[28:41] he's got you
[28:55] he tried to place himself in between god
[28:57] and her el punis
[29:00] did your city bury him lord since you're
[29:02] frustrated
[29:04] oh no oh no she was struck with leprosy
[29:10] for speaking against the man of god
[29:14] and a lot of times
[29:16] people in church do this
[29:23] he's my grandpa i can do whatever i want
[29:26] no no no oh he's my he's my daddy oh
[29:30] it's me papa oh no no nobody could ever
[29:33] talk like that
[29:35] and this is how it seeps in real subtle
[29:52] push everybody else down and look at me
[29:57] the ministry was placed
[30:00] to be able to serve the people
[30:04] and nowadays
[30:06] we complain about everything
[30:08] i have to wear a mask now
[30:13] what are we eating today
[30:19] oh coronavirus shut down my shop what am
[30:21] i going to do
[30:24] oh
[30:25] that evil governor
[30:28] yeah and then the other day on the 15th
[30:31] i was rejoicing
[30:32] you're going to get to stay out a little
[30:34] longer
[30:49] today
[30:51] complain about everything
[30:53] we complain about little things
[30:56] it's a shame when you're a song leader
[30:58] yes
[31:00] people are clocking you at the end of
[31:02] the preaching
[31:17] since when was that position given to
[31:19] you
[31:21] and then we wonder
[31:23] oh business is slow oh
[31:26] and then i went to the altar the other
[31:28] day
[31:30] and i try to get something from the lord
[31:33] i knew that preacher he didn't have it
[31:35] all together
[31:38] because i didn't get it
[31:40] but go a little further
[31:42] when we like to talk about each other
[31:44] behind each
[32:25] would tell you if you were dressed right
[32:26] or not
[32:30] this doesn't work
[32:32] oh no now everybody's so calloused
[32:38] but i have to be in fashion
[32:57] [Music]
[33:22] and the bible
[34:05] is
[34:06] and you wonder why
[34:08] how come god had given me my promise
[34:12] is the promise expired
[34:15] oh no
[34:16] the promise has not expired
[34:32] and he went to
[34:53] [Applause]
[35:00] that
[35:40] so then they said okay let's go this all
[35:41] the way they'll never expect
[35:52] so it got so mad that that the king
[35:55] of the experiences
[35:57] said who is with israel
[36:00] israel guys are you serious
[36:04] and the guy says it's not us
[36:08] elijah
[36:10] he tells the king elisha he even knows
[36:12] what you do in your bed
[36:16] he said we can't beat these guys
[36:20] so then he says let's get them
[36:22] frustrated
[36:50] when they tried to surround elisha
[36:53] before
[36:56] he said there are more forests than
[36:58] there are against
[36:59] nosotros
[37:01] and the mountains
[37:03] we're on fire
[37:05] what the chariots
[37:19] you doubt the man of god
[37:32] [Applause]
[37:34] it's up to us
[38:01] yes sir i believe that's what's called
[38:05] upon you
[38:09] we're getting into it in a very tight
[38:12] time
[38:15] and jesus said
[38:27] make us check our mouth a little bite
[38:46] well this city
[38:47] that's so desperate
[38:50] two women
[38:52] both having a son
[38:55] and both
[38:57] imagine this this is how this is how
[38:59] crazy and i know it's nasty but this is
[39:01] how it goes and this is the way it has
[39:03] to be said
[39:07] one tells the other one
[39:10] today
[39:11] we'll roast your son
[39:49] so this one this is how this is how
[39:51] crazy things get even today
[39:53] i'll explain in a minute
[40:11] i said lord what is the significance of
[40:13] that today
[40:15] but this is what happens
[40:19] doesn't everybody roast each other by
[40:21] their own tongue
[40:37] as long as you're a part of my clique oh
[40:39] yes
[40:40] our children are the best glory to god
[40:44] oh but that did you see did you see what
[40:46] that little boy was doing
[40:48] and they killed the influence of that
[40:50] little boy
[41:02] and even if he comes and repents
[41:19] no no
[41:20] um
[41:22] you know you don't want to know this
[41:25] and everybody likes to say
[41:27] i said man i saw my brother and he was
[41:29] he was praying man
[41:32] it
[41:59] now it's gotten so bad
[42:14] it got to the place that this king
[42:18] the problem was what are we going to do
[42:19] to get rid of this enemy
[42:24] they were wondering how come he won't
[42:26] let me his child
[42:34] who in the right mind would want to see
[42:36] one of our children lost
[42:41] it's only a problem
[42:56] but
[43:09] don't look at me like you ain't done
[43:52] stands
[44:19] oh they're gonna be selling fine flour
[44:22] for a shekel
[44:26] and they're going to be selling barley
[44:27] for two shekels
[44:32] but the servant said
[44:35] so is god going to cut like open the
[44:36] window of heaven and just dump it out or
[44:38] what
[44:41] frustration
[44:42] and the man of god looked at him
[44:45] and he said because of this
[44:48] tomorrow you will see
[44:56] and i know it's hard because i don't
[44:58] want to be this way
[45:01] but i don't care what anybody says
[45:18] and you got to learn how to bite that
[45:19] thing
[45:22] you got to keep it in its mouth a lot of
[45:23] times
[45:25] because one day
[45:27] can you imagine
[45:29] if the coming of the lord comes
[45:32] and something so small as that
[45:36] and you would be watching him come here
[45:39] you will be watching the loved ones come
[45:42] here
[45:43] and they wouldn't visit you
[45:56] is
[46:01] it's not for me
[46:03] i miss my grand mommas
[46:09] so this is what happens
[46:13] or lepers at the gate
[46:16] they said
[46:17] get him we go in the city
[46:20] we're gonna die
[46:22] here
[46:23] we're gonna die
[46:29] [Music]
[46:40] and repent
[46:53] and then the garbage stopped
[46:57] wow
[46:58] so they go
[47:01] he said let's just go to the campus
[47:02] syrians
[47:05] now nowhere in my town you go to the
[47:06] camp of your enemy don't find what
[47:08] you're looking for
[47:22] they
[47:35] for some reason god needs us to go
[47:41] to the camp of the syria puerto
[47:43] vallarta and when they got to the camp
[47:45] of the series
[47:47] of syrians
[47:49] there was no syrian army
[47:52] syrian the horses were still tied up
[47:57] all of the donkeys were tied up
[48:03] they even had just made dinner
[48:06] uh
[48:07] so they went into the tent
[48:10] and began to eat
[48:12] and the bible tells us
[48:15] and they found silver
[48:17] uh
[48:58] do you want that tonight
[49:13] brand new
[49:39] these men didn't go by themselves
[50:24] temple when brother branham says
[50:28] the most deceitful time
