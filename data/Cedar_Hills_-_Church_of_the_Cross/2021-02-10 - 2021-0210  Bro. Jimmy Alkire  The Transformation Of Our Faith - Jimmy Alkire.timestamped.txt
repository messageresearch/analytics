[21:45] in paris
[21:59] good evening everyone this is julian and
[22:02] i wanted to get on to give a testimony
[22:03] because
[22:04] i've been kind of saving this testimony
[22:06] up for like five months now um
[22:08] over the course of these five months
[22:09] i've been taking a series of exams that
[22:11] are required for me to get my teacher's
[22:12] license
[22:13] and so uh today i took my last one
[22:17] and it was the math exam and uh just
[22:19] give you a summary of
[22:20] of how it works is uh or what i got i
[22:23] got for my reading one i got a 198 out
[22:25] of 200
[22:26] for my writing one i got a 176 of 164
[22:30] and for my math one i got a 150
[22:33] out of 150 that i needed to pass
[22:36] so i barely made it but i did make it
[22:40] and i just wanted to give this testimony
[22:41] because
[22:42] uh the commonality between all these was
[22:44] before i went up i remember i talked to
[22:46] my family
[22:46] or i'd be in church or i'd say a prayer
[22:48] the night before i just say hey
[22:50] um say a prayer for me i have my exam
[22:53] tomorrow and
[22:54] sure enough uh as it went on i passed
[22:56] every single one
[22:57] with with flying colors and uh for this
[23:00] last one
[23:01] i really i don't know if the colors are
[23:03] really flying but they were at least
[23:04] colors because
[23:05] i knew that it was going to be bad and i
[23:06] even texted i even texted our pastor and
[23:08] i was like hey
[23:09] i need your help on this i got to bring
[23:11] in the big guns because this exam is
[23:13] it's going to be rough i don't know if
[23:16] i'm going to make it
[23:17] and share it up by the grace of god i
[23:19] did
[23:20] barely i mean literally on the number um
[23:23] so
[23:24] i'm very thankful for that and i just
[23:25] wanted to give this testimony to let you
[23:26] all know that god's doing things
[23:28] and um he's helping me out and i hope
[23:30] that he's helping you out all as well
[23:32] and uh if you need something done just
[23:34] say a little prayer and
[23:36] he'll help you out with it or get you
[23:37] through it at least um
[23:39] but anyway uh with that being said
[23:42] that's all i really had to say so god
[23:43] bless you all hope you have a great rest
[23:45] of your day and

[38:10] the confidence that our pastor has that
[38:12] we will
[38:14] get out of the way and let god speak
[38:16] amen is that why you all came to hear
[38:18] tonight
[38:20] you sure didn't come to hear me right
[38:23] amen but i know you love me
[38:26] you're sick but you still would rather
[38:29] hear god speak than me
[38:30] preference now if we were out somewhere
[38:33] could go to a restaurant
[38:36] if we were out somewhere to go to a
[38:38] restaurant
[38:40] i would want to hear you talk and you
[38:42] could hear me talk to we have fellowship
[38:44] and eat food and you
[38:48] [Music]
[39:16] let's start with our first scripture and
[39:19] very common scripture
[39:20] the same one our prophet used
[39:24] in the message
[39:28] power to transform
[39:33] the transformation and it's the 12th
[39:36] chapter
[39:39] of the book of romans romano
[39:43] amen the verse three verses
[39:48] i beseech you therefore brethren by the
[39:51] mercies of god
[39:53] hermanos was regular
[39:57] that ye present your bodies a living
[40:01] sacrifice
[40:04] sacrificial vivo who's going to present
[40:07] their bodies a living sacrifice
[40:23] a living sacrifice holy and acceptable
[40:26] unto god
[40:29] which is your reasonable service
[40:35] and be not conformed to this world
[40:40] but be transformed by the renewing of
[40:42] your mind that ye may
[40:43] prove what is that good acceptable
[40:47] and perfect will of god transformed
[41:04] or i say through the grace given unto me
[41:11] to every man that is among you
[41:17] to not think of himself more highly than
[41:19] he ought to think
[41:28] but to think soberly according as god
[41:30] had dealt
[41:31] to every man the measure of faith
[41:46] amen now we're going to go to the book
[41:48] of romans
[41:50] and uh brother gaba up there i changed
[41:52] me and
[41:53] very changed the verses it's going to be
[41:55] verses 22
[41:57] and 23. romano of roman romanov
[42:05] thank you for we know that the whole
[42:08] creation growneth
[42:14] let us pray dear lord witness thank you
[42:17] for this evening
[42:21] we love you with all of our hearts
[42:24] and we thank you for all your mercy and
[42:26] all your goodness
[42:48] we will be sure to give you all the
[42:50] honor and the glory
[42:53] gloria in the precious name of our lord
[42:55] and savior jesus christ
[42:58] amen you may be seated i want to
[43:01] continue
[43:02] on that verse there
[43:05] or we for we know
[43:10] who knows
[43:19] the knowledge of god begins to kick in
[43:23] for we know that the whole
[43:32] about people or the earth or the animals
[43:38] oh it's definitely
[43:52] is depending on you and me
[43:57] so simple but yeah that's that's god's
[43:59] word
[44:02] the whole creation grown up and
[44:04] travaileth
[44:05] and pain
[44:17] i want him to get that in spanish
[44:34] there's no way that we are going to be
[44:35] able to groan and travail
[44:37] no no no um
[44:44] every one on their own swing or as they
[44:47] would say crudely every monkey on his
[44:49] own right
[44:52] it's something that's happening together
[44:58] and not only they but ourselves also
[45:01] now it's talking about us which have the
[45:05] first fruits
[45:06] of the spirit you know
[45:14] even we ourselves grown within ourselves
[45:20] waiting for the adoption esperanto
[45:23] adoption to quit the redemption of the
[45:26] body
[45:30] so notice until you get the first fruits
[45:33] of the spirit
[45:35] of spiritual and what is the first
[45:37] speech of the spirit
[45:40] it's the same thing as the earnest
[45:43] it is the down payment estimation it's
[45:46] your
[45:46] portion that god gives you cure while
[45:48] you're on earth
[45:52] not somebody else's portion but
[45:55] your portion his
[45:59] presence the supreme of his spirit
[46:03] in you and that comes
[46:06] how many can tell me how does that come
[46:10] it comes through the new birthday
[46:18] where you have the first fruits of the
[46:20] spirit
[46:23] you will never groan
[46:26] for the adoption
[46:40] the redemption of the body
[46:43] now we're going to be speaking about
[46:46] some words here
[46:47] um but before i give you
[46:50] the definition of the word transform
[46:57] and don't worry about this one up there

[47:04] transform can somebody tell me

[47:33] well we don't we don't have nothing to
[47:34] do with the
[47:35] deformation

[49:10] i'm not going to say poor lady i'm going
[49:11] to say wonderful lady
[49:29] wow we're going to get into that one a
[49:31] little bit
[49:32] what's causing this stress in a believer
[49:38] oh i thought believers didn't have
[49:40] stress
[49:42] not indian how many of you ever had
[49:44] stress want to something to stress
[49:47] so what's causing that stress yes
[49:50] amen now i want to go to our first
[49:54] quote out of
[49:57] the greatest battle ever fought
[50:01] and there's something about our makeup
[50:06] the way god made us
[50:10] that could not be deformed you know no
[50:13] puerto rico
[50:15] and i'm speaking on both sides here
[50:19] can you get you to understand i am
[50:22] trying to understand
[50:28] well they don't have it up here yet but
[50:29] i'll i'll go ahead and read it here off
[50:31] there we go
[50:35] let's get down here this i'm going to
[50:37] read it it's paragraph 114.
[50:41] and that's not the right one greatest
[50:44] battle ever thought paragraph 104
[50:47] what was the matter
[50:52] there we go what was the matter you had
[50:54] to
[50:55] open the channel first
[51:00] what channel is it talking about
[51:03] the channel between your soul your
[51:06] spirit
[51:07] and your mind
[51:10] spiritually or your head
[51:14] we don't want to get going on that but
[51:17] that'll be a
[51:17] channel that when something comes into
[51:20] your mind
[51:35] how many have read this message the
[51:36] greatest battle ever
[51:39] man i'm not going to go into the channel
[51:43] but now he tells you exactly what you
[51:45] got to do
[51:48] he tells me what i need to do
[51:52] got to get the soldier
[51:57] the holy spirit el espiritu
[52:00] placed at the battlefront
[52:17] and i could keep reading but i don't
[52:18] want to well you know this part down
[52:20] here let's go back let's go down to this
[52:22] part down here
[52:25] that's what's the matter with so many
[52:27] blowed up christians
[52:28] it is
[52:36] amen it's because they don't clean the
[52:39] channels out especially
[52:42] they don't go down in the inside no
[52:58] and coming
[53:11] but did you know what the deformation
[53:13] did to you and me
[53:17] from the fall de la caida without a
[53:20] transformation
[53:21] first to no transformation there's no
[53:24] way for it to come
[53:25] from the inside
[53:41] his spirit didn't cover over his soul
[53:47] his soul was in the forefront
[53:50] of the french right but under the fall
[53:54] of
[54:06] [Music]
[54:08] the attack now if you go to this same
[54:12] message
[54:15] and i'm referring also to the message
[54:17] sunday
[54:20] king of salem king of righteousness
[54:44] and the spirit of his soul or the spirit
[54:47] of his nature
[54:48] spiritually was he himself
[54:54] he that existed out and by himself
[54:59] then from spirit king of righteousness
[55:04] to king
[55:11] [Music]
[55:20] by the king and through this body
[55:24] he can be a king through you
[55:28] spirit
[55:32] but
[56:14] it wasn't the spirit inside the soul the
[56:17] spirit was then through the alma
[56:19] that spirit had to leave
[56:22] now he had his soul he had a spirit
[56:27] as a human
[56:54] now i want to go to the scripture in
[56:57] psalms
[57:00] our first scripture in psalms
[57:03] it's psalms 18's brothers up there
[57:08] there it is
[57:13] and i want to speak a little bit about
[57:15] david
[57:18] remember where the the transformation of
[57:21] our faith the transformation
[57:24] remember whether you've got to get the
[57:27] holy spirit
[57:30] the soldier el soldado in france in the
[57:33] part of the french
[57:34] battle front you can do it
[57:52] we're going to get into it a little bit
[57:55] what was the difference of how the holy
[57:56] spirit could
[57:57] lead somebody in the old testament
[58:05] and how they could help the spirit
[58:07] become the spirit
[58:09] but not in the same way you and i can
[58:11] help under the new testament
[58:15] and why is that because the full
[58:18] redemption had not yet been paid
[58:35] but a lot or most of what they had to do
[58:40] was literally romans 12.
[58:44] they had to do it but they had to have a
[58:48] desire in their heart
[58:52] the holy spirit could influence them
[58:56] the holy spirit could anoint them but
[58:59] yet they could not
[59:01] totally overcome
[59:10] [Applause]
[59:16] are you understanding me so far you know
[59:18] as i i was studying this in
[59:20] in my inventory of my life
[59:24] i could just see the faces of our young
[59:26] people
[59:29] in my mind
[59:39] you know the things that i would like to
[59:41] preach
[59:42] there's a lot of things i would like to
[59:43] preach supposed to get you
[59:48] i don't want to get sidetracked amen
[59:51] psalms 18 21
[59:52] for i have kept the thy ways of the
[59:56] thy way the ways of the lord
[1:00:28] and i did not put away his statutes
[1:00:31] from me
[1:00:36] david is telling you this is the only
[1:00:37] way he could deal with it
[1:00:51] but it's something that dave did have to
[1:00:53] constantly do
[1:00:54] is
[1:01:08] desire does this sound like some of
[1:01:12] us really this is the way it works with
[1:01:15] you and me
[1:01:18] till we receive the first fruits of the
[1:01:21] spirit
[1:01:24] amen and this is what's going to
[1:01:26] transform our faith
[1:01:30] from a natural earth-bound faith
[1:01:35] to a heavenly faith
[1:01:38] this is what's going to put us in a
[1:01:40] place
[1:01:43] where god can perfect our faith
[1:01:47] we can go into perfect faith
[1:01:56] 23 i was also upright before
[1:01:59] him
[1:02:02] and i kept myself from my inequity
[1:02:12] here's a point i want to make here he
[1:02:15] had to keep himself from
[1:02:21] oh i can't do that brother i i i i need
[1:02:23] the holy ghost
[1:02:26] until you present your body a living
[1:02:28] sacrifice
[1:02:38] it kind of sounds like a contradiction
[1:02:40] if you really break it down
[1:02:44] we know it's not so much but he's saying
[1:03:00] so he knows that he a lot of things that
[1:03:03] he shouldn't do or that he should do and
[1:03:05] he doesn't do them
[1:03:09] and how did he keep himself from that
[1:03:14] inaudible
[1:03:20] he didn't hang around with the same
[1:03:22] crowd
[1:03:25] he avoided it
[1:03:39] because we know if we subject ourselves
[1:03:41] even to a little bit of
[1:03:43] our past iniquities
[1:03:50] we're just not so sure that we're not
[1:03:52] going to fall
[1:03:53] no no but david
[1:03:56] knew that he would fall
[1:04:02] but he had such a strong desire in his
[1:04:04] heart
[1:04:07] that he kept himself
[1:04:10] from
[1:04:20] yeah because we're still under this
[1:04:21] until we get the first fruits of the
[1:04:23] spirit
[1:04:28] let's go to our next scripture brothers
[1:04:30] in psalms
[1:04:33] see got it here the next one would be
[1:04:38] psalms 119. there we go
[1:04:43] and this is where i i got this picture
[1:04:44] of our young people now
[1:04:47] middle-aged younger folks are counted
[1:04:50] here
[1:04:52] come on you're not as old as me
[1:04:57] how many how many of us older younger
[1:04:59] folks er
[1:05:03] okay i'll be clear over 65.
[1:05:17] shall a young man cleanse his way
[1:05:22] verse 9 119 9.
[1:05:27] how many of you young men have asked
[1:05:29] yourself that question
[1:05:34] by taking heed there unto according to
[1:05:37] thy word
[1:05:45] the last part
[1:05:48] with my whole heart have i said
[1:05:53] can you imagine he couldn't have the
[1:05:56] holy spirit enthroned in his soul
[1:06:00] as far as he knew
[1:06:16] how many of us
[1:06:29] don't let me be a vagabond
[1:06:33] yeah wondering wandering stars
[1:06:38] amen the next verse
[1:06:42] verse 11 please answer
[1:06:45] for thy word have i
[1:06:48] hid in my heart
[1:06:52] that i might not sin against thee
[1:06:56] i know i'm not perfect
[1:07:11] disbelieve the plan you have for my life
[1:07:16] blessed art thou o lord
[1:07:22] teach me thy statute
[1:07:26] oh that he was then humbling himself
[1:07:30] before god
[1:07:39] how many have a teachable spirit
[1:07:51] you always have to teach those people
[1:07:52] sometimes you just
[1:08:06] notice this is david in the old
[1:08:08] testament
[1:08:19] that could not divorce them
[1:08:32] he believed in those substitutes
[1:08:37] that god would hear him because he was
[1:08:40] obeying the word
[1:08:42] that had been revealed to him
[1:08:46] next scripture in psalms 51.
[1:08:53] many of us have read this one many times
[1:08:56] create in me
[1:09:00] a clean heart oh god
[1:09:15] watch this yeah it's really the next
[1:09:16] verse cast me not away from thy presence
[1:09:21] he was desiring that august presence
[1:09:32] yeah it's hard i had a hard time with it
[1:09:34] too
[1:09:35] amen take me not away from thy presence
[1:09:44] and take not thy holy spirit from me
[1:09:59] holy spirit
[1:10:07] it couldn't be it was great the holy not
[1:10:10] that the holy spirit wasn't great okay
[1:10:12] speak to something but he didn't want
[1:10:14] the holy spirit
[1:10:16] to leave him
[1:10:19] and that's that he couldn't really
[1:10:21] receive it in the throne of his soul
[1:10:25] but he knew that in his condition if he
[1:10:41] the transformation of your faith from
[1:10:43] under allah the transformation
[1:10:47] of a sacrifice that couldn't perfect you
[1:10:50] know
[1:10:53] to a sacrifice now i'll sacrifice
[1:11:10] and bring the soldier of the holy spirit
[1:11:14] no longer under a bunch of junk
[1:11:20] not under a bunch of worldly spirits
[1:11:53] why the holy spirit controls that
[1:11:57] next spirit foreign
[1:12:31] [Applause]
[1:12:34] of the body blessed
[1:12:38] be the name of the lord amen
[1:12:41] we love the lord jesus
[1:12:44] we just thank him so much
[1:12:48] notice
[1:12:52] so now let's get down how many want that
[1:12:55] power
[1:12:55] of transformation the transformation
[1:12:59] we've heard these things for years
[1:13:02] but god is trying to make them real in
[1:13:04] our lives
[1:13:07] where does that power of transformation
[1:13:10] lay and establish the transformation
[1:13:15] i'm going to let you think on that one
[1:13:21] praise god
[1:13:25] next question what does the enemy use
[1:13:28] against
[1:13:28] us nosotros
[1:13:35] instead of transforming and lugar de
[1:13:38] transformers
[1:13:39] these are questions that he was asking
[1:13:41] me
[1:13:44] this is inventory for me for me so i'm
[1:13:47] not even pointing it just notice i'm
[1:13:48] putting the finger sideways
[1:13:50] pointing the fingertip i'm kind of just
[1:13:52] going like this
[1:13:56] next question or next this is a
[1:13:59] statement
[1:14:02] so as we go through the process of the
[1:14:04] new birth
[1:14:09] how many have been born again
[1:14:12] how many know about a shadow of a doubt
[1:14:14] you've been born again
[1:14:20] praise god i'm not going to say anything
[1:14:23] no way i'm not trying to make anybody
[1:14:26] feel bad right
[1:14:51] do you really know the real you the
[1:14:53] element of el real usted
[1:14:58] so as we go through this process of the
[1:14:59] new birth our spirit and our soul
[1:15:02] are being redeemed
[1:15:12] yes the redemption was paid yes
[1:15:18] but now we're not waiting to baby james
[1:15:22] john one that laid on jesus's bosom
[1:15:31] yeah that's good
[1:15:34] and then in the book of revelation
[1:15:50] let me ask
[1:16:02] was he born
[1:16:14] anybody want to answer that one that's
[1:16:16] really actually a pretty easy one
[1:16:18] i think it might get a lot
[1:16:21] was john one there on the day of
[1:16:24] pentecost
[1:16:27] was john there on the day of pentecost
[1:16:31] amen man did john receive the first
[1:16:34] fruits of the spirit
[1:16:37] of spiritual yes see did john have a new
[1:16:40] birth
[1:16:42] yes three does he represent the bride
[1:16:45] represent
[1:16:46] yes see
[1:17:00] he was
[1:17:14] there was no
[1:17:37] [Applause]
[1:18:14] i wish there was a way to really
[1:18:15] translate that into spanish it's more of
[1:18:17] an expression than anything
[1:18:24] i want the redemption of this body
[1:18:29] glory to the living god amen
[1:18:32] now
[1:18:38] so conscious you've gone over the spirit
[1:18:42] a little bit
[1:18:48] with the first fruits we can fulfill the
[1:18:51] scripture and sounds
[1:18:52] almost
[1:19:07] there's no way there's not even a crack
[1:19:09] or a crevice
[1:19:10] no i ain't dedura nothing not even a
[1:19:12] little open space
[1:19:16] satan can get into my soul
[1:19:19] and until we get to that point
[1:19:33] i don't care you can give me boils from
[1:19:37] my head to my toes
[1:19:43] but you can't touch my soul
[1:19:48] oh he'll curse you to your face
[1:19:52] said to god
[1:19:57] that's my boy it's just me mijo there's
[1:20:00] nobody like him on earth
[1:20:16] if that was under the law yes yes if we
[1:20:18] walk with allah
[1:20:20] there was grace we understand
[1:20:24] sacrifice
[1:20:27] right now
[1:20:31] but we let the devil lie to us
[1:20:36] because our faith needs to be
[1:20:38] transformed
[1:20:44] you know my time
[1:20:47] [Music]
[1:20:49] praise the lord i'm i'm happy but if i
[1:20:52] don't get to any of those quotes i gave
[1:20:53] them i don't know like four or five up
[1:20:55] there
[1:20:56] but that's okay what the healing
[1:21:01] okay so we went through the spirit this
[1:21:02] wall uh spiritual
[1:21:05] then what part of us remains
[1:21:12] that hasn't been redeemed
[1:21:16] or changed yet we just said it right
[1:21:20] what's the part that hasn't been
[1:21:21] redeemed
[1:21:24] come on yeah
[1:21:40] yes looking at it from one another yes
[1:21:43] absolutely absolutely it is
[1:21:46] he wants you to get this captain
[1:21:50] so our enemy uses this deformed body
[1:21:53] against us
[1:22:08] that's
[1:22:21] and the holy spirit
[1:22:31] why do we let them use this thing
[1:22:33] against them
[1:22:50] this
[1:22:54] okay okay
[1:22:58] okay let's go to our quotes now
[1:23:01] in the message god's power to
[1:23:12] [Music]
[1:23:19] and actually brothers uh i'm at the
[1:23:22] paragraph 64 b
[1:23:26] and i know it's hard because it's not
[1:23:27] quite written that way but
[1:23:30] but i'll just start where i've got it
[1:23:32] here
[1:23:47] control so with everything in the trust
[1:23:49] of his own son
[1:23:52] that it would be that way
[1:23:55] then god said it's all good
[1:24:00] so i'll just rest
[1:24:03] and each one of those seeds
[1:24:06] has power in itself
[1:24:10] to transform itself into the species
[1:24:14] that
[1:24:14] i desire
[1:24:28] you make
[1:24:41] exactly what i wanted to be
[1:24:44] okay where is this power of
[1:24:46] transformation
[1:24:48] transformation where does it live in
[1:24:51] that field
[1:24:56] of transformation the transformation
[1:24:58] inside of that scene
[1:25:01] itself and then it already has
[1:25:04] power to be transformed
[1:25:24] to lay down
[1:25:49] doesn't make you feel good
[1:25:55] oh
[1:25:58] i'm not a meaning myself this is this is
[1:26:00] a word
[1:26:04] paragraph 66.
[1:26:08] now after it was all well and set in
[1:26:11] order
[1:26:15] god felt sure now that this would be all
[1:26:19] all be all
[1:26:33] god gave power to transform
[1:26:48] he had power to deform
[1:26:51] or there that the former the former not
[1:26:54] transformed no
[1:26:55] transformers
[1:26:58] now anything that is deformed
[1:27:02] is taken from the original state yes
[1:27:07] there's something that's wrong with it
[1:27:12] why how many are back to your original
[1:27:15] state
[1:27:16] pantos is
[1:27:30] but when that time comes
[1:27:34] when you when you see what we have seen
[1:27:37] on a minor scale
[1:27:44] you will see it come into the fullness
[1:27:46] of its power
[1:27:50] when that confederation of churches
[1:27:54] iglesias brings the boycott
[1:27:58] is
[1:28:02] and i don't want to say too much because
[1:28:04] we're on youtube
[1:28:06] i'm not scared to say it either no no
[1:28:10] what is the boycott yes
[1:28:13] the modern word for it's actually two
[1:28:15] words yes
[1:28:18] cancer cancel cancellar
[1:28:21] culture they just cancel you out the
[1:28:25] muscle
[1:28:26] concern
[1:28:41] well we know the squeeze has been here
[1:28:42] as our pastor said where in the world
[1:28:44] have you been
[1:28:49] when it squeezes to the point where you
[1:28:51] can't breathe
[1:28:59] you think twice about interpreting me
[1:29:01] again
[1:29:03] all right no they're not the same but
[1:29:07] they're connected
[1:29:08] no no no
[1:29:23] i want you to give you my analysis of
[1:29:26] what satan's done in eden
[1:29:28] analysis he sprayed a horrible poison
[1:29:33] spray
[1:29:37] would you like to know what that spray
[1:29:39] was
[1:29:43] how many would you like to know what
[1:29:44] that spray was
[1:29:47] i can tell i got the formula of it
[1:29:50] formula
[1:30:04] filled its place
[1:30:15] okay that went
[1:30:19] into the seed
[1:30:22] satan filled that cavity
[1:30:28] with knowledge and science
[1:30:46] transform
[1:30:57] to change character or condition
[1:31:00] a character
[1:31:12] or instance of transformation
[1:31:19] you got more have you got more of the
[1:31:20] definition there brother not already
[1:31:27] okay i'll keep reading okay
[1:31:31] then it takes you to the word transpose
[1:31:36] to change in form for a cambiar informa
[1:31:39] appearance or you or
[1:32:34] and what is your structure your
[1:32:35] composition
[1:32:38] composition it's how you're put together
[1:32:41] escomo sustain
[1:32:45] and depending on how you put together it
[1:32:47] depends
[1:32:50] there's certain things that make you
[1:32:52] tick i
[1:33:05] those things don't make you
[1:33:20] acts first
[1:33:27] first right away when you're confronted
[1:33:30] with something
[1:33:32] there's something that steps forwards
[1:33:34] first
[1:33:48] still in the background
[1:33:51] and the soldier of the holy spirit
[1:33:55] cannot take his place in the battlefront
[1:34:04] what's the center of your attention
[1:34:11] what makes you tick i can use other
[1:34:13] words but you know they get kind of
[1:34:16] functional
[1:34:45] invert applies cheaply to turning
[1:34:47] something upside
[1:34:48] down
[1:34:56] or inside out or
[1:35:26] we were born backwards
[1:35:29] the makeup of our spiritual being
[1:35:34] spiritual was backwards
[1:35:39] it needs to be inverted
[1:35:53] that's why when your faith is as you
[1:35:56] would say on
[1:35:56] needles and pins
[1:36:09] you call a brother up and they're
[1:36:11] coughing
[1:36:17] nobody offers to pray for them
[1:36:21] well what in the world did you call him
[1:36:26] but of your faith if they don't want you
[1:36:29] to pray for them don't get me wrong you
[1:36:30] can't force yourself on nobody
[1:36:35] i have that living faith
[1:37:01] that sickness has to go back to
[1:37:08] amen it's got to be flipped
[1:37:11] our nature's got to be flipped back the
[1:37:13] way it was before we failed
[1:37:24] now let's go to the message power of
[1:37:26] transformation
[1:37:29] how many of you read these messages oh
[1:37:32] they are
[1:37:33] incredible i'm sure a lot of you have
[1:37:42] this one here got me
[1:37:52] [Music]
[1:38:19] he's talking about when he started the
[1:38:22] tape room in the tapes
[1:38:26] this is paragraph 16b again here i am
[1:38:28] well yeah he got it here
[1:38:31] but what a greater thing god has did for
[1:38:33] them
[1:38:40] most anybody can make a tape
[1:38:43] to use online i am not lessening the
[1:38:46] fact that we
[1:38:47] live on the tapes of brother branham and
[1:38:50] we believe it
[1:38:51] and we'll listen to them until we're
[1:38:54] raptured out of here or go six feet
[1:38:56] under
[1:39:07] anybody can make a tape that's got the
[1:39:09] intelligence to turn on the tape
[1:39:10] recorder
[1:39:34] [Music]
[1:39:38] still
[1:40:06] never
[1:40:49] 19.
[1:40:54] but to hear these comments of these
[1:40:56] young soldiers here
[1:41:02] you're not young blood jimmy
[1:41:10] wow that's the word of god
[1:41:13] yes and myself getting old
[1:41:16] are you opening
[1:41:24] and what you placed into believe the
[1:41:27] message that i have been given of god
[1:41:44] now if it wasn't for you all right
[1:41:49] the message would do no good
[1:41:54] it's got to be somebody to believe it
[1:41:58] as
[1:42:13] his great economy like that
[1:42:17] that when he sends forth something
[1:42:21] there is something there to meet that
[1:42:23] something
[1:42:26] that's all okay
[1:42:37] let's go to paragraph 77
[1:42:46] this is what the lord opened to me
[1:42:50] this sunday morning
[1:42:53] over 30 years ago
[1:42:57] more than 30 years ago i can't remember
[1:43:00] the exact years
[1:43:03] sacramento and my wife gets up
[1:43:07] because i had this dream
[1:43:12] and we were by this highway
[1:43:14] establishment
[1:43:16] and they were in these beautiful
[1:43:17] mountains on the other side of the
[1:43:19] highway
[1:43:22] there was
[1:43:31] brothers from phoenix go in there
[1:43:38] then i'm when she gets up with that
[1:43:40] dream he come in to tell me
[1:43:44] i'm sitting on the couch reading this
[1:43:46] quote
[1:43:49] because i had come to this time
[1:43:52] i'm not saying this is going to happen
[1:43:54] to you
[1:43:57] literally the way it happened to me
[1:44:03] sometimes you have to separate from
[1:44:05] everything that's there
[1:44:07] on earth
[1:44:13] to take your position that god has
[1:44:15] called you
[1:44:16] tomorrow i'm sure you can read between
[1:44:20] the lines
[1:44:22] what i'm saying is sometimes the very
[1:44:25] dearest person on earth
