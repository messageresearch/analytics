[31:58] amen amen all is

[32:06] comes but he's got to stay
[32:09] right how many are happy to be in the
[32:11] house of the
[32:14] Lord a little bit nervous
[32:17] today uh tonight's going to be a little
[32:20] personal and it's been a little while
[32:22] since I've been up
[32:25] here but I don't know if brother Marcus
[32:27] is here
[32:30] robt uh they really inspired me on
[32:35] Saturday talking about Second Chances
[32:37] third
[32:39] chances you I want to want to thank our
[32:42] pastor for the
[32:44] confidence that he always has in
[32:48] us even when we don't have confidence in
[32:52] ourselves he's got that long that
[32:56] eye that can look so much further down
[32:58] than we
[33:01] can I just feel bad for
[33:04] him because he's always got a deal with
[33:07] us again thank
[33:10] God for second third fourth fifth 10th
[33:16] chance where would we be without
[33:19] him and I say that like I said it's
[33:23] going to be a little little personal
[33:26] tonight on some things that that that
[33:28] I've been going through
[33:32] personally it has been a
[33:35] struggle you say oh as a minister
[33:37] brother Jerry you
[33:40] struggle
[33:41] absolutely because Satan can sneak
[33:45] in matter who we
[33:48] are how long we've been in the
[33:50] message how tremendous we
[33:54] preach Who We Are Who I think I am
[33:58] Satan will sneak in if we're not
[34:02] careful again like I said I want to
[34:04] thank the pastor for for the
[34:07] confidence but let's read the scripture
[34:09] so you can be
[34:12] seated Mark
[34:24] 49 and it reads
[34:28] and we'll start off
[34:38] with and it reads and the cares of this
[34:41] world and the deceitfulness of riches
[34:45] and the lust of other things entering in
[34:48] choke the word and it becometh
[34:51] unfruitful
[35:02] Matthew
[35:04] 13 and then we'll be we'll be turning to
[35:07] Psalms 150 right after
[35:11] that Matthew
[35:14] 13:7 and it
[35:17] reads s some fell among
[35:21] thorns and the Thorns sprung up and
[35:23] choked them
[35:28] I'm I'm making emphasis on the word
[35:30] choke
[35:32] there keep that in mind
[35:34] okay but Psalms 156
[35:39] says let
[35:41] everything that ha
[35:43] breath praise the
[35:45] Lord may be
[35:49] seated again so it's it's like I said
[35:51] it's good to be behind the this sacred
[35:56] desk as touching as serious as it
[35:59] is the nervous part is not speaking to
[36:02] the people to be in front of the
[36:06] people at work I get to do that I get to
[36:09] brief the
[36:12] government lieutenants
[36:16] Colonels I get to brief them a little
[36:18] part of on
[36:21] security that's a piece of
[36:24] cake to Stand Here amongst God's
[36:30] to voice the word of
[36:32] God gives me a little bit of
[36:34] butterflies but only because of the
[36:36] seriousness of
[36:38] it I have to understand I'm responsible
[36:42] for every single word that comes out of
[36:44] my
[36:46] mouth that's why I have to preach where
[36:48] I
[36:49] live I have to preach and the
[36:51] experiences that I've gone
[36:54] through and I only hope that my stumbles
[36:59] are stepping stones for each and every
[37:00] one of
[37:02] you that's the purpose behind the
[37:06] pulpit of the
[37:07] ministry of our
[37:09] pastor all we have to do is look at
[37:12] him we want an example we look at
[37:16] him you see how he's so giving to the
[37:21] people willing to give of his
[37:24] time of himself all for for our
[37:28] benefit thank you Pastor like I said got
[37:31] to give flowers when flowers are do and
[37:33] i' their
[37:36] [Applause]
[37:39] alive we
[37:41] understand in today's
[37:44] society I always start off like
[37:48] that but I always start off that
[37:50] way we look at people and they're so
[37:53] troubled
[37:55] today heard that over over and
[37:59] over but but watch
[38:02] this the thing I appreciate so much
[38:04] about this
[38:06] ministry so much about our
[38:09] pastor is he's willing to roll up his
[38:14] sleeves and he's willing to go through
[38:16] the
[38:18] mud and take you
[38:20] out our folling pastor would
[38:23] say people think that the bride is going
[38:25] to have a white spotless dress
[38:31] and of course in a sense
[38:33] yes but he would always say now my
[38:36] dress it's
[38:38] filthy but not because of of
[38:42] me but because I've had to go down to
[38:44] the
[38:45] mud to take the people
[38:48] out and that's all I see from this
[38:51] ministry people that are
[38:55] willing give of themselves
[38:58] even maybe it doesn't look right for to
[38:59] some
[39:01] people but reputation that doesn't it in
[39:04] a sense doesn't matter to
[39:07] them the main purpose is to get the
[39:09] people
[39:13] saved brother Jimmy is is well I heard
[39:16] him so I mean that's another one brother
[39:18] Emilio brother Tommy I mean this the
[39:20] ministry that we
[39:22] have they're
[39:24] wonderful and now I understand why we
[39:27] always
[39:28] say we are a blessed
[39:32] people so many of us need help in one
[39:34] way or
[39:37] another we do good in certain
[39:40] areas and and and not so good on other
[39:44] areas we're weak in certain
[39:47] areas or I'm weak in certain
[39:50] areas and so something I went
[39:54] through it started off as a good deed
[39:58] like I said it's going to be a little
[39:59] personal tonight
[40:02] so I spoke to the pastor probably a few
[40:06] times and I told him my
[40:09] desire is I want to be in the mission
[40:11] field with with with the group so
[40:16] bad and I look back because hindsight's
[40:21] 2020 and and young people take note of
[40:23] this
[40:25] okay I wish I would have set myself
[40:30] up so I'm not so dependent to have to be
[40:33] on up there be
[40:37] site I'm limited at where I can
[40:40] go I'm I'm I have to be there because
[40:44] there there's for certain
[40:46] reasons so I look back and I say I wish
[40:49] I would have made the
[40:53] moves you see like like people like like
[40:55] brother B that goes on all the
[40:56] missionary trips
[41:00] smart brother Mar Chavez
[41:04] SM man that had
[41:06] Vision I like man I'm so blind I was so
[41:09] blind growing up I was like I wish I
[41:11] would have done
[41:14] that so I asked the
[41:17] pastor Pastor help me
[41:20] pray and
[41:22] absolutely how me pray that something
[41:24] can open up so that I can do something
[41:29] to break me
[41:31] away so that I can go on these trips
[41:33] with
[41:34] him sounds pretty good
[41:37] huh but time went
[41:39] on I talked to him two times three
[41:43] times and he
[41:45] prays like said but we have to realize
[41:47] the decisions that we
[41:50] make it's not going to things aren't
[41:52] going to just change overnight
[41:57] I'm thinking well maybe I can just turn
[41:58] God on like a light
[42:03] switch Lord I need this I expected it
[42:08] tomorrow the mistake I
[42:10] made was I started to
[42:13] think I said well it's not
[42:17] happening well maybe you know start off
[42:20] real real really easy like whatever
[42:23] whatever you know God will open up a way
[42:27] but it started to
[42:29] grow and I started to think
[42:32] more and I'm like well maybe maybe I
[42:34] don't belong out
[42:36] there maybe it doesn't
[42:40] matter he's got his team
[42:43] anyway you see how he came
[42:46] in he's he's got he's got his team he
[42:48] doesn't need
[42:50] me so then I started to grow even
[42:53] more maybe I don't have anything to
[42:55] offer
[42:58] HOH that's trouble right
[43:01] there the second that I started to
[43:06] think Satan started to come
[43:09] in so I started to
[43:12] feel
[43:14] helpless I started to retract
[43:19] myself so I have to apologize behind the
[43:21] pulpit to
[43:24] everybody the little bit that I have to
[43:26] offer you
[43:28] I have withheld it from
[43:31] you that's why I've been absent for the
[43:33] past maybe a year
[43:36] [Music]
[43:38] so so I I want to apologize to you
[43:42] all apologize to my
[43:45] pastor that's the head the husband to
[43:47] the
[43:49] church me being the female
[43:51] part me
[43:54] withholding that's not a good thing not
[43:57] a good thing at
[43:58] all I started to feel
[44:01] helpless I felt like well what do I do
[44:05] now the pastor doesn't care about
[44:09] me nobody cares about
[44:11] me I'll just isolate
[44:14] myself anyways it will just be me and my
[44:17] family the thing that I didn't
[44:20] realize I started to see my wife get
[44:24] Restless I started to see it ffect
[44:28] her and she would tell me what's going
[44:30] on with
[44:31] you nothing just don't worry about
[44:34] it good I still believe the
[44:37] message I believe the message now more
[44:39] than ever
[44:41] before I still study the
[44:43] word as a matter of fact I received this
[44:45] message during that
[44:48] time but it was
[44:51] fruitless it would not bring
[44:54] fruit because it was being choked
[44:58] out things started to creep into my
[45:02] life and it started to make me
[45:05] unfruitful so brother Jimmy I have to
[45:07] apologize to
[45:10] you he would he would get with me do you
[45:13] want to
[45:15] interpret no no not
[45:17] today not today you want to
[45:20] interpret no no brother Jimmy no I can't
[45:23] I want to apologize to you brother Jimmy
[45:24] as
[45:25] Welly to all the
[45:28] interpreters for
[45:30] withholding if like I said if I have
[45:32] anything to
[45:34] give never want to do
[45:37] that I'm sorry from the bottom of my
[45:40] heart I'm
[45:41] sorry started to creep
[45:44] in now you start to feel
[45:47] hopeless you start to feel
[45:50] helpless now even though you know the
[45:53] way
[45:54] out you don't know how you get
[45:58] out watch
[46:01] this there's a scientific
[46:04] term that's called learned
[46:10] helplessness learned helplessness is a
[46:14] state experienced in
[46:17] humans in response to enduring enduring
[46:21] negative
[46:25] stimuli learn helpless
[46:30] zaps the desire to
[46:33] escape even when an exit route is
[46:38] presented people who feel
[46:41] helpless May believe nothing that they
[46:44] can
[46:46] do will improve their
[46:50] situation so they stop
[46:54] trying I found myself in the
[46:58] situation I said I believe the
[47:00] word I was hiding behind
[47:04] religion this word is not
[47:06] religion the way I was using
[47:10] it I believe brother BR I believe the
[47:14] prophet but I was it was
[47:19] unfruitful
[47:22] so I'll
[47:25] wait I'm going to wait for the
[47:28] Lord I'm going to wait on
[47:31] him I waited 16 years for my
[47:35] sons and I can wait
[47:37] now the exit route was presented to
[47:42] me why wouldn't I take
[47:45] it learned
[47:48] helplessness so I have a
[47:51] question are the message
[47:55] churches are they falling victim to
[47:58] learn
[48:02] helplessness I had to answer the
[48:04] question for
[48:05] myself you answer the question for
[48:09] yourself so all these starts started
[48:11] floting
[48:14] through not being
[48:16] needed no one
[48:19] cares that's not the
[48:22] truth I started to get
[48:25] bitter I started to stay away from our
[48:28] pastor that was the biggest mistake I
[48:30] made right
[48:31] there where I started to not avoid him
[48:34] in a sense because I didn't have
[48:35] anything wrong with
[48:38] him I felt something inside of
[48:41] me so I would hide from
[48:44] him and then also I knew the second that
[48:46] I'm in front of
[48:51] him but little bit of comic belief
[48:55] sorry I don't want to be serious like I
[48:58] said but I did start to get
[49:03] bitter
[49:05] and the cares of this
[49:09] world young people you know this you've
[49:11] been out long
[49:14] enough we start to choke the holy ghost
[49:16] out of you we'll start to choke the holy
[49:19] ghost out of
[49:22] you we will be in
[49:24] church singing and preaching
[49:27] jumping and
[49:29] shouting but there's no fruit behind
[49:32] it so I I I studied this a little
[49:35] bit and I came across the word
[49:41] helpless and and I started to study a
[49:43] little
[49:44] bit there's something that brother Diego
[49:47] had
[49:49] mentioned he mentioned the word
[49:52] Python and this is where I want to start
[49:53] my
[49:55] message py
[49:58] you ever known how a python
[50:01] works you want to know how he
[50:04] hunts is a the python doesn't go to the
[50:08] prey the python hangs around in the
[50:12] trees and he's waiting for the prey to
[50:14] come to
[50:16] it when the prey gets close
[50:20] enough he shoots out and he's got
[50:23] fangs he doesn't have no Venom but he
[50:26] shoots out and he and he grabs you with
[50:28] his
[50:29] teeth he's got hooked hooked
[50:33] teeth and the reason he does that is to
[50:35] pull you
[50:37] in when he's got you in his
[50:41] grasp he starts to coil
[50:44] you he starts to coil around
[50:48] you and he kills not by
[50:51] Venom he kills by
[50:54] Suffocation but watch this watch the put
[50:57] the definitions of Suffocation up
[51:00] there okay and so when you're thinking
[51:02] about this don't just think about the
[51:06] animal should think about the
[51:07] characteristics of that
[51:10] animal because that that's the spirit of
[51:14] python has the same
[51:17] characteristics watch watch him the
[51:20] state or process of dying from being
[51:22] deprived of eror
[51:27] or unable to
[51:29] breathe difficulty in
[51:31] breathing watch number three a feeling
[51:33] of being trapped or
[51:37] oppressed Webster also had to stop the
[51:40] respiration as of by strangling or
[51:47] asphixiation to deprive of
[51:50] oxygen to make uncomfortable by want to
[51:52] Fresh Air
[51:56] to impede or stop the de development
[52:01] of so so think about his characteristics
[52:05] okay number one if you get near
[52:09] him he'll grab you and and and once he
[52:13] grabs you they say the the the hold of
[52:17] of a large snake like
[52:20] that once he starts to coil
[52:24] you you better be careful
[52:28] but I I don't want to get ahead of
[52:29] myself that's a little bit further
[52:32] down but he but he grabs a hold of
[52:35] you and in between
[52:39] breaths right when you
[52:41] breathe you exhale it's
[52:44] relax but what he does is in between the
[52:48] breaths he squee
[52:52] tighter there's no
[52:54] rest every every breath
[52:57] he squeezes
[52:58] more starts to squeeze the very life out
[53:01] of
[53:02] you spiritually speaking he starts to
[53:05] squeeze everything out of
[53:08] you you can repeat the message by
[53:11] word but you have no
[53:14] rest because he's coiled you he's gotten
[53:17] a hold of
[53:18] you and that's not that's a very
[53:21] difficult situation to be
[53:24] in because his whole goal
[53:27] he doesn't kill you
[53:30] softly or slow very
[53:34] rapidly it's a very slow
[53:37] death it's it's it's death by can you
[53:40] imagine having the life squeezed out of
[53:46] you imagine okay take this in a
[53:48] spiritual
[53:49] sense we're talking physically but the
[53:51] natural types of
[53:54] spiritual that's what this Spirit comes
[53:56] to
[53:58] do we know that Spirits are
[54:02] tormentors he doesn't want to kill you
[54:04] right
[54:05] away what he wants to do he wants to
[54:09] recruit
[54:10] you he he consumes your whole
[54:13] life your whole life consists of your
[54:17] family your life consists of your
[54:19] church so he wants to consume all of
[54:23] you so as he starts to recruit other
[54:26] people
[54:29] then the squeeze starts to squeeze
[54:30] someone
[54:31] else then you start to plant seeds and
[54:34] somebody
[54:36] else then you got two people that that
[54:38] they're thinking the same
[54:41] now you got three people that are
[54:42] thinking the
[54:44] same people maybe even behind the
[54:47] pulpit that will preach with an
[54:50] agenda that's Spirit of
[54:53] python that's to squeeze the people
[54:57] to take the very
[54:58] life instead of having the Breath of
[55:01] Life instead of the
[55:04] rest squeezing
[55:06] you tormenting you so there's a sense of
[55:11] helplessness when you're in his
[55:13] grasps there's no way
[55:15] out but there's one way
[55:18] out do this do
[55:21] this what is this right here I want you
[55:24] to hold on to this okay
[55:26] this is your pinky right hook your
[55:30] pinky and I'll tell you later
[55:33] why watch
[55:35] this I went hunting with my
[55:38] brother and I thank God for my
[55:41] brother he pulled me out when I don't
[55:45] want to hear too many
[55:47] things he never he's never left
[55:50] me he pulled me out he told me something
[55:52] while I was
[55:55] hunting struck my
[55:57] soul I was telling about this message we
[56:00] were talking about the
[56:02] word and I was telling him about
[56:04] helpless and this and
[56:07] that and he says yes
[56:11] helpless or help
[56:14] less oh my
[56:17] goodness that's exactly what I was doing
[56:20] I was in the very
[56:23] coils and I didn't even know
[56:26] so I helped Less in
[56:28] interpretation help Less in the
[56:32] ministry help the pastor
[56:34] less I was
[56:36] helpless and I didn't know it the
[56:40] grasp he started to coil
[56:43] me and
[56:46] that's forgive
[56:48] me the night before I had a
[56:51] dream I don't dream very
[56:54] often this dream was very Vivid very
[56:58] real telling brother Diego it was so
[57:03] awkward it's hard for me to
[57:07] explain all I know is that I was like
[57:10] traveling we were
[57:13] hunting and I passed
[57:15] through and I saw this great
[57:18] machinery and I thought oh the Machinery
[57:21] that's against the
[57:24] bride there was these great devices
[57:28] I saw this big giant obese man
[57:32] huge taskmasters came to
[57:36] me and I was just it's like I was
[57:38] traveling the scene would
[57:41] change until I came to
[57:43] one and I when I confronted him he was
[57:47] in the form of a
[57:49] man but the only way I can explain it he
[57:51] was like
[57:54] smoke like a shadow
[57:57] I would see him travel through the
[58:00] dirt so when I I saw him I braced
[58:05] myself he was very aggressive
[58:09] looking all could see he had like like
[58:11] spikes in his
[58:13] head long
[58:15] fingers and he attacked me and and those
[58:18] it didn't scare
[58:21] me but when he started to lash his
[58:23] tongue out at me
[58:27] super long
[58:28] tongue he started to lash it at
[58:31] me and I thought to myself I braced
[58:35] myself and he he's lashing it at
[58:38] me but there was like a protection like
[58:40] a
[58:42] cover like a glass in front of
[58:44] me and his tongue would just move he
[58:47] couldn't get to
[58:49] me and I thought to
[58:51] myself if he touches me with that
[58:53] tongue I'm finished
[58:56] when I said that the scene
[58:59] changed I saw a picture of the
[59:03] tongue and I thought in the dream I
[59:07] thought oh it's like a
[59:12] tail or like a story in other
[59:16] words it's like a story I knew the way
[59:21] out when I said that when I exposed him
[59:26] I got back to
[59:27] camp and the sun was coming
[59:29] up so vivid so
[59:32] real but a dream has never scared me
[59:34] like that
[59:36] before I was asleep and I could feel the
[59:38] hair standing up on my
[59:43] body things don't scare me very very
[59:47] easily and I don't dream so I know it
[59:49] was
[59:52] something but I knew if he touched me I
[59:55] was done
[59:58] watch
[59:59] this the pastor when he preached this
[1:00:02] last
[1:00:03] message I felt he was preaching into my
[1:00:07] soul everything that he was
[1:00:10] preaching I told him I had to go and
[1:00:12] thank
[1:00:12] him I felt like he was preaching to
[1:00:16] me we heard brother Bernie the tape of
[1:00:18] brother Bernie lening for
[1:00:22] power oh my goodness what what a message
[1:00:27] and I came to this
[1:00:29] conclusion I know at the at the bottom
[1:00:34] line ye must be born
[1:00:37] again I have to be born
[1:00:40] again well brother you born
[1:00:42] again oh where the three stages of
[1:00:46] Grace justification sanctification
[1:00:48] baptism of the Holy
[1:00:50] Ghost you cross the River Jordan in the
[1:00:52] in the the pyramid you you you get
[1:00:54] inside the pyramid
[1:00:57] are you born again
[1:01:00] yet
[1:01:01] potentially not yet have to climb that
[1:01:04] stature of a
[1:01:07] perfect go all the way to the
[1:01:09] top and and Brother Jimmy's favorite
[1:01:12] favorite um subject on adoption you
[1:01:17] have I forgot to tell about brother
[1:01:20] Jimmy brother jimmyy forgive me but
[1:01:23] effective immediately if if if you'll
[1:01:25] have me interpret I'll I'll help
[1:01:29] again thank you but you you follow me I
[1:01:33] know it's a little slow maybe it's a
[1:01:34] little it's a little a little boring but
[1:01:36] like I just I want to do what our pastor
[1:01:40] does and what our following Pastor would
[1:01:41] do I have to be an open
[1:01:45] book I never want to preach at
[1:01:49] you I'm only preaching what's happened
[1:01:51] to
[1:01:52] me like said I'm hoping it helps you
[1:01:56] so ye must be born
[1:01:59] again why is it so important to be born
[1:02:03] again Watch brother Bram put the the
[1:02:06] approach to
[1:02:10] God what does brother Bram say about a
[1:02:12] person that that that hasn't been born
[1:02:16] again brother Bram says he's a
[1:02:21] brute watch watch this watch this quote
[1:02:23] look at the maniaca
[1:02:27] see when Jesus when he met
[1:02:30] Jesus Remember When Jesus he had to meet
[1:02:32] Jesus but he's got to stay right like
[1:02:33] the song
[1:02:35] says he was restored to restored to his
[1:02:39] mind his right mind and a man without
[1:02:43] his right man
[1:02:45] mind no matter how much intellect he
[1:02:48] has he's still not sane
[1:02:52] yet a man without knowing Christ is
[1:02:55] nothing more
[1:02:58] hardly in
[1:03:00] himself than a
[1:03:03] brute he
[1:03:05] will for passions and
[1:03:08] lust he throw the baby out of a mother's
[1:03:11] arms and Rish
[1:03:15] her because of his own beastly
[1:03:19] lust that's right certainly he
[1:03:22] will with the definition of Brute
[1:03:27] I know we know what they are but
[1:03:29] just brute a savagely violent person or
[1:03:32] an
[1:03:34] animal an animal is opposed to a human
[1:03:38] being love or relating to
[1:03:42] beasts or
[1:03:44] beast so the beast at the
[1:03:46] beginning is the beast at the end we
[1:03:49] know that he injected himself in Genesis
[1:03:52] into the human
[1:03:54] race and this is for you young people go
[1:03:56] and study it
[1:03:58] out if the curse of the serpent was to
[1:04:00] go on his
[1:04:04] belly what was it
[1:04:06] before it was something
[1:04:08] before the curse was a
[1:04:12] snake he was something
[1:04:15] before in Genesis he says that that
[1:04:17] Enoch was the seventh from
[1:04:22] Adam in the
[1:04:24] genealogy if you add it makes him
[1:04:27] eight I believe in the book of Jude it
[1:04:29] says the Cain which was of the wicked
[1:04:35] one was Adam
[1:04:37] Wicked God's
[1:04:40] son who was he
[1:04:42] from study it out and I guarantee
[1:04:46] you it'll lead you to the right
[1:04:49] answer but a
[1:04:51] beast so I got this thought and I ran by
[1:04:54] the pastor because I don't want to be
[1:04:55] off my Rock
[1:04:58] ER Revelation
[1:05:02] 17 I see a woman riding on top of a
[1:05:07] beast if I know my
[1:05:10] symbols I see a
[1:05:12] church riding on a
[1:05:15] power remember there's lusting for power
[1:05:18] and then there's a power of
[1:05:21] lust this woman was even drunk with the
[1:05:23] blood of the Saints
[1:05:27] so I I understand the seven heads and 10
[1:05:28] horns and the dictators and all this I I
[1:05:30] understand
[1:05:33] that bringing it down to us to the
[1:05:37] microcosm I see a church I see a woman
[1:05:42] without the new
[1:05:43] birth will be guided by human
[1:05:48] impulse this
[1:05:50] Beast this
[1:05:52] flesh we heard about the serpent in the
[1:05:54] harbor brother Jimmy
[1:05:57] without the new
[1:05:59] birth you will make
[1:06:02] decisions you will act and
[1:06:05] think through this
[1:06:07] guy
[1:06:09] human or through
[1:06:11] beastly impulses
[1:06:14] impuls amen amen maybe that's a little a
[1:06:17] little rough but like I said I this is
[1:06:19] for me it's not for nobody
[1:06:22] else I don't want to be guilty of that
[1:06:26] I don't want to be responsible for the
[1:06:28] blood of the
[1:06:30] Saints by going and spraying and
[1:06:33] infecting someone
[1:06:36] else then you become the very the very
[1:06:40] python for somebody
[1:06:43] else you begin to kill the people
[1:06:48] now if we kill if I kill brother Tommy's
[1:06:52] influence Tommy what does that make me
[1:06:55] that's
[1:06:56] Beast if I talk about my my brother
[1:07:01] dieo brother brother rer
[1:07:04] anybody if I act that
[1:07:06] way it only
[1:07:08] shows what I'm being Guided
[1:07:11] by and it's not the Holy
[1:07:14] Ghost it's
[1:07:16] Beast amen
[1:07:19] amen so without knowing
[1:07:22] Christ it's a brute it's a beast and
[1:07:27] it's
[1:07:29] unfruitful driven by these carnal
[1:07:35] impulses I see the Roman
[1:07:39] system inside the
[1:07:41] people you see Nebuchadnezzar's
[1:07:44] dream the head of gold is the
[1:07:47] beginning it ends with iron and Clay on
[1:07:49] the
[1:07:53] toes the following pasture with
[1:07:56] say it says iron is
[1:08:00] Rome Clay is the
[1:08:03] people that Spirit would be inside the
[1:08:07] people it's the
[1:08:09] system it's the Beast and then there's
[1:08:11] an image to the
[1:08:14] Beast anything that's set up like the
[1:08:18] Beast is an image to the
[1:08:21] Beast any anybody a person one person
[1:08:25] can be a
[1:08:27] denomination because all they has to do
[1:08:30] is start from one
[1:08:32] person I don't want to be that
[1:08:37] person so the seed the serpent seed
[1:08:40] Bible
[1:08:42] says if that is not wiped out of
[1:08:47] us it will lead us down that
[1:08:52] path this
[1:08:53] woman will be carried by by this
[1:08:56] Beast she'll be driven by this
[1:09:02] Beast time do I have
[1:09:05] brother supp to be my thank
[1:09:12] keeper got
[1:09:15] watch I'll
[1:09:17] hurry so the last time brother brother
[1:09:19] Kay preached preached into my
[1:09:22] soul and I found out that I needed to be
[1:09:24] more
[1:09:26] sincere watch the way a founding Pastor
[1:09:29] used sincere one
[1:09:31] time he used the word
[1:09:34] sincere and he used it free of
[1:09:38] Tangles watch watch

[1:24:19] uh a a dream that brother Lorenzo had
[1:24:22] had cleared through our pastor
[1:24:28] just just Place something
[1:24:31] soft watch watch his
[1:24:33] dream he titles the dream
[1:24:37] pythons and he says I found myself among
[1:24:39] some homes of brothers and
[1:24:43] sisters I couldn't say whose specific
[1:24:45] homes but I knew that they were brothers
[1:24:47] and sisters from our
[1:24:51] church as I was walking outside
[1:24:54] I saw a python snake curled up outside
[1:24:57] one of the brother's
[1:25:02] homes and it scared me to see the size
[1:25:05] of the
[1:25:07] snake the snake was with its eyes
[1:25:10] open but just curled up as if it was
[1:25:13] waiting for
[1:25:16] something remember how they
[1:25:18] hunt they hunt through his signature
[1:25:24] so the revivals are great
[1:25:28] absolutely pythons are
[1:25:31] hunting Be watchful that's
[1:25:34] it but he was waiting for
[1:25:38] something remember how they
[1:25:40] hunt don't get near it get as far away
[1:25:44] from it as
[1:25:45] possible like that man that that was
[1:25:47] looking for he needed to go on a
[1:25:50] journey and he picked the man that says
[1:25:52] I hug the wall I stay away from the
[1:25:54] Cliff as far as
[1:25:59] possible he says but it scared me to see
[1:26:05] this so I quickly went to a place to
[1:26:07] call the
[1:26:11] husband because the husband was not
[1:26:14] home I grabbed the husband by the hand
[1:26:16] and pulled him and told
[1:26:20] him to hurry and come quickly with me
[1:26:23] because I needed to show
[1:26:28] him what was at his
[1:26:30] home we we we then both hurried to his
[1:26:33] home and I showed the husband where the
[1:26:35] python was curled
[1:26:41] up the husband was concerned and I was
[1:26:43] going to pick up the python to throw it
[1:26:50] out of the house when all of a sudden
[1:26:55] now this is I was here
[1:26:59] okay the wife entered the
[1:27:03] home and the husband was
[1:27:06] upset telling the wife that needed to
[1:27:09] throw this python out of their
[1:27:14] home when all of a sudden the wife got
[1:27:18] upset went up to the snake and picked it
[1:27:22] up picked up the snake by its head and
[1:27:24] brought the snake to her
[1:27:28] lips and started to kiss the
[1:27:31] snake as she was kissing a harmless
[1:27:36] puppy the wife said why do you want to
[1:27:38] throw him
[1:27:41] out if he's so pretty and
[1:27:45] cute then she began to rub the
[1:27:49] nose rub her nose to the nose of the
[1:27:51] snake
[1:27:55] I saw the husband get
[1:27:58] upset said but in order not to argue
[1:28:00] with the
[1:28:05] wife he just let them walk out of his
[1:28:09] house I saw the husband leave his
[1:28:13] house then I turned back around to see
[1:28:15] the
[1:28:17] wife and the Python and the wife started
[1:28:19] to hug the wife started to hug the
[1:28:22] python
[1:28:25] watch this the python started to hug her
[1:28:30] back curling himself around
[1:28:34] her the wife even giggled as it looked
[1:28:37] like they were playing around with each
[1:28:41] other when all of a sudden the
[1:28:43] playfulness started startled the
[1:28:49] wife as the python got rough with her
[1:28:54] began to to the python began to start
[1:28:58] choking the wife from the top of her
[1:29:00] head all the way down to her
[1:29:05] ankles as he was curled up on her from
[1:29:09] head to
[1:29:13] toe then an angel came by my right side
[1:29:15] and said you
[1:29:18] see my senses were heightened
[1:29:24] and I knew what he
[1:29:26] meant he meant when the python gets into
[1:29:29] that
[1:29:32] position then it's too
[1:29:34] late I was saddened by
[1:29:37] this and I walked out of the
[1:29:39] home and I saw two more
[1:29:43] homes that sisters didn't
[1:29:46] know if they were there
[1:29:51] were SS were playing with Pythons
[1:29:53] outside of their
[1:29:56] homes treating them as harmless
[1:30:00] puppies I didn't know if there were more
[1:30:02] homes that were having the same
[1:30:06] problem because it saddened me so much
[1:30:09] to see that my brothers and sisters had
[1:30:12] no
[1:30:16] idea what they were playing
[1:30:19] with so I shut my
[1:30:21] eyes because I didn't want to see
