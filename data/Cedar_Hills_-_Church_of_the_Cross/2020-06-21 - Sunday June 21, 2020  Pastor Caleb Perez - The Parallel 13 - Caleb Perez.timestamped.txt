[0:00] what about that church one thing I know
[0:01] about this word I highly gonna believe a
[0:03] church when these nine hundred and
[0:05] something different denominations in
[0:07] each one st. our denomination has
[0:08] exactly the truth where would you go to
[0:12] you've got to have faith in something
[0:15] well you say I have faith in the
[0:17] Methodist and the Baptist and the
[0:18] Presbyterian in the Lutheran in the
[0:20] Pentecost from the Kathleen whatever it
[0:22] is you got faith in that organization
[0:24] and if it's contrary to the word you're
[0:26] good the same thing I've done
[0:29] Zach you're doing exactly the same thing
[0:35] she did taking God's Word and make it
[0:38] well these are better class of people
[0:39] goes here it's a bigger building they're
[0:43] smarter man they don't have one thing to
[0:45] do with it Satan is much smarter than
[0:48] Eve she didn't wasn't even in the
[0:50] picture but she wasn't supposed to be
[0:53] smart she supposed to be obedient we're
[0:56] not supposed to be smaller jesus said
[0:59] the children of this world of Kingdom in
[1:00] this world is much smarter the children
[1:03] of darkness as the children of life
[1:04] we're liking the sheep sheep can't even
[1:07] leave themselves they've got to have a
[1:09] shepherd God don't want a smart horses
[1:14] to lean on his understanding that's
[1:17] where he'll even hate me you see the
[1:21] picture don't lead up on your own
[1:23] understanding proverbs five three don't
[1:26] need up on your own understanding lean
[1:28] upon his understanding no matter how con
[1:31] trade seems how big the bright lights
[1:32] look out here don't pay no attention it
[1:34] is lean on his understanding what he
[1:36] said is the truth now the oneness and
[1:40] fellowship was broke between God and his
[1:44] children
[1:45] the minute she disbelieved one little
[1:48] paragraph one little word of God
[1:51] everybody get that say a man not a Bible
[1:56] say I don't need the Bible at all I
[1:58] believe half of it she had to believe
[2:01] all every bit not only that but the one
[2:06] this between husband and wife was broken
[2:11] I don't believe this any marriage can be
[2:14] what it ought to be without a union
[2:16] between husband and wife and God right
[2:21] they'll bring up children in the world
[2:24] and make them legitimates give them
[2:26] cigarettes whiskey play cards on their
[2:29] side drink liquor before them no matter
[2:31] how long they are to their marriage vows
[2:33] that's sexually iced flesh but there's a
[2:39] spirit in there that spirit of a sinner
[2:42] poppin mama no matter how loyal to their
[2:44] children become wrong we say I know men
[2:48] and women that didn't teach your
[2:49] children that it wasn't Christians the
[2:51] very thing of not leading under Christ
[2:53] was the longest thing they could ever do
[2:55] besides the other not to lead him to
[2:58] Christ
[2:59] see so you can't have a correct union
[3:01] without it the fellowship broken man as
[3:06] soon as the fellowship was broken
[3:09] between Adam and Eve as soon as their
[3:12] fellowship is broke between God in them
[3:14] then their fellowship between each other
[3:16] was grown listen anytime a church breaks
[3:23] his fellowship two thoughts up into an
[3:26] organization the fellowship of the
[3:28] believers is rule we've got to believe
[3:32] with one heart one mind and water card
[3:35] that's the way there was before the
[3:37] Union was ever made on the day of
[3:38] Pentecost one heart one mind amount of
[3:42] card and when you throw a church into an
[3:45] organization you're gonna get all kinds
[3:47] of fractions in it because some of them
[3:49] children there's going to believe in god
[3:51] they're gonna hold to the thing that's
[3:53] right and the others will go the other
[3:55] way sir you have no fellowship yes what
[4:00] her thinking changed oh yes her thinking
[4:05] changed her fellowship with her husband
[4:07] wasn't right they begin to past about
[4:11] her thinking was actually changed why
[4:15] she had the life of the devil in her
[4:18] doctor as soon as she disbelieved
[4:22] God's Word
[4:23] she accepted the life of the devil
[4:26] because she accepted his teaching I can
[4:31] make us all four strong right here but
[4:33] its own paper I'm sure you understand in
[4:38] the church
[4:39] she disbelieved God's Word and it
[4:44] disassociated her from God because in
[4:49] her right then what's the life of the
[4:53] devil
[4:54] she'd believed his life said the fruits
[4:56] is good and she'd protect him with him
[4:59] it's right-angle all this hubbub let it
[5:04] come in another day in law at California
[5:10] I mean in Arizona I was teaching in a
[5:12] church I've never said nothing under
[5:15] inspiration that ever had to take back
[5:16] so maybe the ministers got anything
[5:18] about the seed of Satan
[5:20] the Serpent's seed the woman it was
[5:23] eaten apple that's what came talked the
[5:26] same thing
[5:27] he brought the fruits of the feelings he
[5:29] was a little at home how'd she realize
[5:32] she's naked we'd been through that
[5:33] actually a sexual affair certainly was
[5:37] she realized she's naked she had a child
[5:40] by the serpent which was not a reptile
[5:42] is more subtle of all the beasts his
[5:44] next thing to a man man combined monkeys
[5:46] in Japan's chimpanzees and so forth but
[5:49] they can't find that weight that
[5:50] connects man and beast together there he
[5:52] is God cursed him so far he can't come
[5:54] back for this evil act that he did is
[5:59] the only a seed that would mix now the
[6:02] other days standing preaching there's a
[6:04] bunch of Catholic people in my audience
[6:06] one said you Catholic people that called
[6:10] Jesus or call Mary rather the mother of
[6:15] God how can God have a mother
[6:18] what is he turning you can't have a
[6:22] mother Jesus does not even anything to
[6:28] Mary but he was just she was the
[6:31] incubator that hatched
[6:35] well they always believed in a head of
[6:38] idea that myself years ago that the the
[6:41] Macklin conception was a god over
[6:43] shattered and put a blood cell in there
[6:45] but the egg come from the woman if the
[6:48] egg come from the woman there has to
[6:50] come a sensation to bring the egg to the
[6:54] to see what you do at God you're making
[7:00] it a sexual mess God who created the
[7:05] black cell created the egg also doctor
[7:10] there has to be both male and female
[7:12] Apollo right well then if this woman
[7:17] produced the egg then how could David
[7:20] say I'll not leave my Holy One see
[7:24] corruption neither I leave his soul in
[7:27] hell then if the woman 8 was in Christ
[7:33] then the person's got something to do
[7:36] with his part in the resurrection what
[7:39] it's how I complete with God why did God
[7:44] raise up a sexual part of a person in
[7:49] the resurrection why did he leave his
[7:50] body see corruption because he was
[7:54] hauling now how can he be holy if he had
[7:58] had a conception with Mary and the
[8:01] pollen had come from Mary to aid down to
[8:03] the tube into the womb that had to be
[8:06] some sensation to bring the egg down
[8:08] then the woman would be wasted they
[8:11] might have been laying there could have
[8:12] been possible but that if so then look
[8:15] what happens here then he wasn't all
[8:17] together God he wasn't gone as much as
[8:21] he was human but then affect me so the
[8:24] woman had something in it and the actual
[8:28] seed that come from Mary which come from
[8:30] her mother and her mother and her mother
[8:32] was something human mixed into it with
[8:35] the human desire could the man no sir I
[8:40] said he she was only just like you take
[8:43] the eagle and let it lay a name and put
[8:46] it under the
[8:47] in the hen we'll have steak she's only
[8:52] the incubator but there isn't one fact
[8:54] about it the Eagle it's a chicken Wilson
[8:59] the hymn was it you can tie them up up
[9:03] down over the top of a a birdie it would
[9:06] hatch a bird the pup would it's a
[9:10] warrant for the body that hatch the egg
[9:14] and that's the same way it is with Jesus
[9:19] Mary was just the incubator God used her
[9:24] like he does any other woman she was a
[9:27] virgin
[9:28] she'd had no children he come into a
[9:32] virgin wound but God the Creator made
[9:35] both egg and jaren created it
[9:40] therefore it was immaculate conception
[9:42] when I come out of course you know the
[9:46] brethren waiting for me they said
[9:49] brother branham I want to ask you
[9:51] something you made a mistake now we got
[9:55] you caught all right that's what I want
[9:58] to become and said you made the mistake
[10:01] for saying this when you preach the
[10:03] Serpent's seed now you say that that the
[10:07] a belong God created it the egg what
[10:12] happened we find out you're that in
[10:14] Genesis the 3rd chapter God said to Mary
[10:17] I will put enmity between your seed and
[10:20] the serpent see I never preached
[10:26] anything in my life under inspiration I
[10:28] had to take back because I don't depend
[10:30] upon my own understanding and if my
[10:33] understanding is contrary to God's work
[10:35] that my understanding is wrong
[10:36] it's got to be God's Word if it isn't
[10:39] leave it alone it's not right when I'll
[10:41] tear it down the thing to do a my heart
[10:44] I said Heavenly Father you help me I
[10:47] don't know what to do here the man is
[10:49] the scriptures party's favorite I'll put
[10:51] enmity between your seed and the serpent
[10:54] see now here it is the Holy Spirit moved
[10:58] over
[10:59] the same one that could overshadow their
[11:02] I could create you can also put a word
[11:06] in your mouth I depend on him daily and
[11:10] it's always his word you can't say this
[11:13] something contrary to his work now if
[11:16] you're say you're not even preach
[11:17] against the truth of God then just opt
[11:19] the anointing of the Holy gold
[11:21] because when the Holy Ghost overshadows
[11:23] you he brings the same thing because it
[11:26] is the word listen what happened I said
[11:31] all right I want to ask you something
[11:32] the woman has no age Jay has no seed he
[11:37] said now you said now eight he said I
[11:39] see and she had no see that takes a
[11:43] union to make a seed that right doctor
[11:47] has to be if you got a hold on Popeye
[11:51] your didn't handle life and it fight it
[11:52] out here it wouldn't come up later in
[11:55] rock you couldn't paint the life without
[11:57] having the bone so you see the whole
[12:00] thing is a union I'm trying to tell you
[12:02] now about Christ in the church it's a
[12:06] union see if the woman is the seed of
[12:10] herself then she doesn't need the minute
[12:13] she had her baby herself but she can't
[12:18] be us she can't have the baby until
[12:20] she's been with the male because it
[12:23] takes the two together to make his seed
[12:25] is that right plain to see with no life
[12:28] in and see what happened like they got
[12:32] this stand this woman giving birth to
[12:34] these dogs here it couldn't be Ladd
[12:39] couldn't be cause see the pollen won't
[12:43] mix now notice this now the the woman
[12:50] was not a seed therefore he said I will
[12:56] put enmity between thy seed and the
[12:59] Serpent's II telling her that he was
[13:02] going himself to give her seed not
[13:07] through an intercourse
[13:09] sexually
[13:11] he was going to create in her seed place
[13:14] a would that be here to see guess he
[13:16] would long to marry then after he gave
[13:18] it to her
[13:19] this is my I he give me this his mom but
[13:23] he gave it to me this is my hand he gave
[13:26] it to me this is my voice but he cannot
[13:29] tell me see and the seed and it was Mary
[13:34] had nothing to do with Mary there was
[13:36] something God did himself so the seed
[13:40] that was in her then was a union of a
[13:45] unlawful act which was death she was
[13:50] already pregnant him with the Serpent's
[13:54] seed because she lived with her and she
[13:56] turned and said herself the serpent
[13:58] egami trying and I'm needed they came
[14:03] come on all we know she said she got a
[14:05] child from God certainly every child is
[14:07] born illegitimate everything else has to
[14:09] come as an act of God he's the only one
[14:11] you can make life certainly that is
[14:14] right
[14:14] see she was already to be mother and
[14:17] that's never only what it did was clear
[14:20] up the thing of the cerfancy the seat
[14:22] that's in you now is my concepted your
[14:27] unlawful act against my word with this
[14:30] thing here and you're now got the
[14:34] Serpent's scene but I'll give you a seed
[14:37] by Immaculate Conception and his seed
[14:40] shall bruise the Serpent's head and his
[14:44] head shall bruise the heel amen just let
[14:47] God have it this is word you bring it to
[14:50] pass that's the reason you've got to be
[14:52] in union with God that's the reason that
[14:55] Peter said on the day of Pentecost after
[14:57] Jesus said baptize them in the name of
[14:59] the Father Son Holy Ghost
[15:01] Peter turn around said baptize them in
[15:03] the name of Jesus Christ but cause the
[15:05] name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost is
[15:08] the Lord Jesus Christ
[15:10] see that it takes a union Paul had never
[15:14] seen Peter but the same holy ghost in
[15:18] that same union born caused him to say
[15:22] the same thing have you received the
[15:26] Holy Ghost said she be said we don't
[15:28] worry about how is she baptized said
[15:30] owner John said yeah be baptized over
[15:32] again
[15:32] in the name of Jesus Christ and they
[15:34] receive the Holy Ghost by bison the
[15:36] Union saying the same thing God says
[15:40] that's a confession confess me say the
[15:44] same thing and he's the high priest of
[15:47] our confession the octuple what Thea
[15:50] said we say it's a truth and he acts
[15:52] upon oh there you are there is a
[15:57] conception now watch how she she our
[16:04] union between her husband was broken see
[16:08] up quickly as soon as God said Adam
[16:12] how'd you do this instead of taking up
[16:16] for his wife he passed it on to his wife
[16:18] the woman now give us me Union broke
[16:24] what did she do
[16:27] instead of loving her husband and
[16:30] telling the truth she lied she says she
[16:38] should have said he's innocent I gave to
[16:42] him the Bible said she gave to her
[16:47] husband she should have said the man's
[16:50] innocent I gave to him and then he did
[16:56] eat but I was one again attorney instead
[17:00] of that she passed it on to the circle
[17:01] hostess bypass that's the same thing to
[17:05] try to do today the husband wife the
[17:09] union broker husband and wife fellowship
[17:12] is broken between them the oneness
[17:14] Saddam is broken the one is between them
[17:16] and God was broken the whole thing was
[17:17] marred why they called one word was
[17:20] disbelief
[17:21] oh brother mom yes she should have told
[17:26] the truth the oneness with her and her
[17:29] husband was gone and the oneness
[17:31] abandoned God was gone in every Church
[17:34] that doesn't take the home of God's Word
[17:37] the same thing happens I love it don't
[17:42] you watch your firstborn team a murder
[17:47] Allah a deceiver jealous jealous of his
[17:54] brother his brother kept the
[17:57] commandments of God God had made an
[18:00] atonement by killing an offering and
[18:04] offered it for them
[18:06] what's the ignorance of that a Satan
[18:08] trying to shut the to something God the
[18:11] Bible said went and made them a pers out
[18:13] of skins to give skins something died
[18:17] and him tried to make yourself some
[18:19] aprons out of fig leaves it wouldn't
[18:21] work botany life life moving I've had to
[18:24] die so he killed a lord form of life and
[18:28] staying in there there's some day my own
[18:32] life will be here for you the real life
[18:35] that have joined this union again now
[18:38] we're get to it in a few minutes
[18:39] God willing see here's the Lambs life
[18:43] now you put this around you and hide
[18:45] your nakedness you mustn't eat apples
[18:48] nonsense put these skins around you you
[18:54] had to kill something I'm Satan's son
[18:59] they come the way he wanted he did
[19:02] anyway you want to say it but it was
[19:04] Satan's son cuz that purity of Adam to
[19:07] God could not have broke that kind of a
[19:10] thing notice then Satan's son trying to
[19:16] make an atonement come back for the same
[19:18] thing that most of the people say today
[19:19] a bunch of apples and fruits to the land
[19:21] to offer for an atonement an antidote
[19:24] and what did righteous able to he note
[19:28] that it wasn't no such a thing he's
[19:30] eating apples he was a blood of his
[19:32] mother daddy
[19:35] life of them so he brought a lamb just
[19:38] like God did he kept the Word of God am
[19:43] i and Cain was jealous with him same
[19:47] thing today yeah coming that blur Allah
[19:50] flee that word of God just exactly what
[19:53] it says stay right with it a lot of
[19:55] believe that blood offerings sure but
[19:57] something else to wear to say oh I don't
[19:59] believe that out of that that's for the
[20:00] other day same ole devil same old trick
[20:05] wait till we get through with him notice
[20:07] he come right down the same way but Cain
[20:10] it is stupid ways not so stupid but it
[20:15] is cunning way
[20:16] deceived and brought in fruit Adam kept
[20:20] the UH Abel kept the Word of God he
[20:23] brought in a lamb
[20:25] God said that's right Hannah you've kept
[20:27] her Abel you've kept my word taking you
[20:31] know we're not table take some fig
[20:33] leaves like your daddy tried to do you
[20:36] got a bunch of feeds your grapes or
[20:37] apples or whatever you got here and how
[20:39] your daddy took the leaves off the tree
[20:41] you're trying to make an atonement
[20:42] you're you try to bring the fruit off
[20:43] the trees it wasn't that it was blood
[20:47] from high Oh God wrote it down
[20:52] so here's Abel offered the right one
[20:55] then his brother with jealous Adam look
[20:58] what he did he killed his brother God
[21:01] raised up another one like this barely
[21:04] resurrection of Christ watch God been
[21:08] his what did he tell Adam and Eve go on
[21:11] and multiply and replenish the earth
[21:13] scattering the human race all the earth
[21:15] so I could deal with it individually
[21:17] till they could bring them back together
[21:18] dealing with the people individuals each
[21:22] person but they didn't want it that way
[21:25] don't miss this revelation God let it
[21:28] happen
[21:28] maybe the way I'm looking at it it
[21:32] wasn't that God don't deal with a person
[21:35] in a group God don't deal with in an
[21:38] organization he deals with you as an
[21:41] individual
[21:42] I'm individual individually we are
[21:46] baptized with the Holy Ghost
[21:48] collectively we are baptized into the
[21:50] body when we are baptized with the Holy
[21:52] Ghost amen
[21:54] individually each one baptized with the
[21:57] Holy Ghost God dealing with each one
[21:58] that was just birthless scatter them
[22:00] across here so I could deal individually
[22:01] with him but instead of that what
[22:04] happened God had to separate Kings
[22:08] people from Sam's people he sent Tina
[22:12] way separated him so he could deal with
[22:15] his church watch Thema separated now
[22:20] watch God separated Eve's
[22:23] evil Cain from Adams wholly safe did he
[22:32] do it to an unlawful act this woman
[22:36] living with to somebody else and brought
[22:38] a child God separated that child and
[22:42] here generations from this righteous and
[22:45] holy man his children is the same thing
[22:49] today
[22:50] separating separated found then they
[22:58] were not in unity they could have no
[23:01] unity can I have unity with day 10 a
[23:05] believer have unity with an infidel 10 a
[23:09] man who believes in all the Word of God
[23:11] have a unity with them who does these
[23:13] part of the Word of God God won't
[23:16] separators now teen was Eve son she said
[23:24] I have gotten the son but safe was Adam
[23:29] son and God separated them because he
[23:33] couldn't let why they crush one another
[23:36] Cain's evil children would corrupt since
[23:39] good children thrive watch and the same
[23:44] old devil that paused Eve to disbelieve
[23:49] one word of God and told them to
[23:52] separate themselves from one another and
[23:55] to live
[23:56] for each one that seemed devil got among
[23:59] them and got them together again did you
[24:03] get it
[24:04] say hey man if it is he brought them
[24:07] together again under a false Union a act
[24:10] of God against God's pain what happened
[24:14] how did he do it the sons of God said
[24:18] the Bible Genesis seen the daughters of
[24:22] men the sons of God says children saw
[24:25] the daughters of mancation how pretty

[1:48:19] in attitude yes yo mismo enacted - no
[1:48:22] matter how much of a lapse of time there
