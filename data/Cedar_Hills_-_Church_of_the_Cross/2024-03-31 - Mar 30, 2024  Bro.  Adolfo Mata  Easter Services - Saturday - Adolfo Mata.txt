cold or flu but it doesn't want to leave ever so often I have to cough and I can't avoid it so if you can forgive me I begin to cough because I'm speaking in tongues God bless you I know that you're standing open your Bibles to the Book of Matthew chapter 16 and we'll read verse four says a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given unto it but the sign of prophet Jonas and left them and departed let us pray beloved God lord we give you thanks this evening for allowing us to be here congregated Lord to sing those songs of to speak of your word Lord It's a privilege not given to everyone but we give you thanks for this time we ask that you may accompany us from beginning to end we ask in the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you can please take your seat SE now I don't speak too extensively I've learned to be that I'm a believer of the message of the hour so I Don't Preach over the hour I believe we're we're we're Believers of the message our message to follow this evening is the sign of the Resurrection now the scripture that we just read it's when Jesus Christ speaking to the Pharisees and the SES were there and these two groups they ask for the Lord for a sign and for them to give them a sign of Heaven so the Lord responds to this petition and he says you know the times when you go out and you see that the skies are red he says it's a good time when you see that the sky is red and and it's dark clouds is because a storm is coming so you have learned to discern or see the the signs of the time and then he tells them you are hypocrites a hypocrite is a person that is not says you are hypocrites because you can discern the sky but the signs of the time you cannot discern amen so they could see what was going to happen but they could not see what God was doing in their time and then he says unto this generation he says I will not give you another sign but rather the sign of Jonas the prophet if you can go it's Matthew 12 and it's verse 40 for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth so this is what Jesus was speaking today so now we have something to compare to the days of prophet [Music] Jonas and the days of the Lord Jesus Jonas was in the in the belly of of the great fish for three days and also Jesus was in the heart of the Earth the same time three days so we can enter a little little further into that let's just see for a moment Jonah we know he was going to a different place they cast him out of the boat a great fish comes swallows him if I could just imagine the thoughts Jonah must have had to be inside what the belly of that will had but the whale said the the Bible says the whale spews Jonah out and when he comes out of the fish he begins to preach I believe after experience like that he was preaching very anointed he was preaching with a lot of will to speak and it was so much the preaching of Jonah that the people of nineve repented we know that the people of Nineveh were the worst they were idolators they were Wicked people but to see Jonah preach they repented and then the Lord tells us that that generation will rise up and will condemn Our Generation because in our time a great prophet has arose the message of the hour has risen a great amount of word has been preached and this generation shall rise up to be witnesses that they repented aside from how they were so we see that in the same way Jesus after raising from the tomb he rises from the heart of the earth and he tells them I was the one that was dead but now I live amen and the scripture says that he presented alive before his disciples they were a bit fearful but he said I'm Jesus you should eat or give me to eat give me fish touch touch my hand they pierced me here that's a sign that even though he ascended up high it shall never take away from from from from the hand of Jesus it's a memorial of what he did for us but he presented himself alive and he said I am Jesus he said now I am among you and I am proving to you that I am alive that I am not dead amen so the theme of this meeting is you're celebrating a historical Resurrection or a sign of the Resurrection it's one thing or the other we celebrate a historical Resurrection right now all the denominational churches the churches of the message of the hour there are special meetings this this weekend and it's everywhere they're celebrating the resurrection of of the Lord of Our Lord from the from the dead but truly is he alive Among Us amen is there a sign that shows us that he is alive amen that is what we seek for we search for a sign and the Church of the Living God must have a sign that he is among us because he said the things that I did you ye shall do also and greater than these things shall you do because I go unto the father and I will send you the comforter so you will do Greater Works you'll do greater things more things so the church the called out they must have the sign of the Resurrection in our mid that he is alive amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord now what did Jonas do because we go parallel of Jesus and Jonah so Jonah after coming out of the belly of the great fish he said I was as a dead one I considered myself a dead person but I came out and he came out preaching Glory now what did Jesus do didn't he do the same thing he began to preach even before resurrecting he was preaching to the Lost Souls but he rose preaching and then he began to commission what is called the Great Commission go ye to all the world and preach this gospel to every creature and all he that repenteth shall be baptized shall be saved amen amen so he gave the commission same as Jonah to preach the gospel here's where I want to make a parenthesis to preach does not mean to speak every one of us can speak everyone can speak but not everyone one can preach because to preach is to take the demonstration and the power that he is alive amen today we have a lot of people speaking but very few are preaching there are people that are dedicated just to give pamphlets out that's fine I have nothing against of that there's other people that are dedicated just to press the button play that's fine but that is not preaching that's not preaching and Jonah he was preaching amen amen right now with the technology of Internet anyone who has access to Internet they have access to all the message of the hour so it's not that we're lacking more message we have the message already the Bible has been distributed everywhere there are people that still need Bibles but the great part of the world they have a Bible but not because of that does that mean that they're preaching doesn't mean that because of that they have the sign of the resurrection of Jesus because he is alive and for Jesus to be alive he must be dwelling in someone Jesus Christ needs to be dwelling in a person so that he can present himself as a living Christ amen amen that's why Jesus said I was the one that was dead but I have resurrected and what sign is of this well give me to eat so that you can see that I can eat there's no problem that we show the sign especially if they give us a burger a hamburger or something with pleasure I'll I'll show you the sign many have just the word but it's a word that is deaden amen the word kth but it's the spirit that quickens that word in other words it gives life to that word that's why Jesus said the words that I speaketh they are spirit and they are life this word is alive it's Spirit you can't see it you hear the voice that I have and it's invisible but nevertheless that it's a spirit and it's life amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord when Jesus Rose Among the dead he said if the spirit that has risen me from the dead if that spirit is among you they will resurrect you even though ye be dead dogmas trans transgressions or anything but when Spirit should come it will give you life and you will know that you are alive you will know that you serve a living God because it's easy to serve a religion but when you know him personally you know that what you have is not just any religion it's not just the message it's the living word amen blessed be the name of the Lord what was the Holy Ghost sent for we know the answer to that the Holy Spirit was sent to continue The Works that Jesus began he says there are many things that I can't tell you but when the spirit of truth shall come it will show you these things so there was a work to do he began the work but he didn't finish it now it's depending in men and women that they can take this seriously and do the works of Christ because when this Holy Spirit would come he will show them because they won't speak of themselves they will speak speak of him time will lack us to speak of him amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord recalculate again I won't be too extent my preaching A great miracle happened in the time of Jonah that he came out of the the whale began to preach but Jesus speaking on that he said I now or now there's a one greater than Jonah now here among you there is one greater than Jonah for how tremendous the work of Jonah was but the resurrection of him and to show himself alive he said that is something greater that what the prophet Jonah did that he was now shown alive in these last times it was a an old story but there was someone that arose him from the story or from history and presented him alive Among Us what serves us good to just know the history if we don't have the Christ resurrected amen amen Blessed Be him let me just turn the corner here in the time of prophet Jonas a great Eclipse a solar eclipse happened just think on that this was someone in according to someone an expert on the theme the subject Donald wi man brother or from Donald wisman he said that he can testify that the in the inhabitants of nineve they saw a solar eclipse and then his the history of the story uh spread that Jonah had come out of the womb or the belly of the well just think on that two great signs to see the sun blacken and to see a man come out of the god that they served it wasn't just anything for them with great re reasoning they paid attention to this man they paid attention to the preaching he had it was something Supernatural but I I I I say again Jesus said one greater than Jonah is among you in in April next month we have a solar eclipse I was talking to he was telling me thatb he preached a message on the E I haven't heard it I don't know what he said about that neither do I want to take his message but this is what the lord gave so there will be a solar eclipse the eth next month and what I was searching for in the trajectory of this Eclipse there are two cities n that are called nineve indana one is in in Indiana and then the in Ohio and there are other five that are close to the TR trajectory of this Eclipse so in total we have Seven Cities and one more in Canada that is called nineve that the solar eclipse will pass through isn't that something similar to what Jonah was going through and during that solar eclipse up in the stars there is a constellation called satus now this constellation is called the constellation of the whale or the fish am so we have above the eclipse the whale or the great fish is that a coincidence oh it's a sign something very interesting that n in the Hebrew it means the place of the fish it was a place of fishermen it's the place of the Fish N so in the place of the fish came out that great fish and came out Jonah preaching so the the scripture that we read in the beginning Jesus is speaking to the Pharisees speaking to the SES and he calls them Hypocrites and he said you can see the signs in in the heavens and you're asking me of a sign and I'm telling you I will not give you another sign ex except of the sign of Jonah the prophet but they could discern by the color of the sky if it was a good day or the color of the sky if a storm was coming he said but I won't give you another sign but the sign of Jonah the prophet as he was in the belly of the whale also the son of the man shall be also wow now the Pharisees they could discern how the time would be if we bring it to our time the scientist they'll tell you the clipse is going to pass through here there are so many cities called n there's a constellation called setus which is the whale a great fish they can discern the signs that are in the heaven today is the same it was the same as those Pharisees they could discern the time of their sign of the sign but it was going over their head the greatest sign ever given to man it was Jesus Christ it was Emmanuel that God is with us the greatest sign it went over their heads the Lord give us ass signs in Heavens you Hypocrites you can discern the signs of the heavens and you can't see what present before you once again that scripture is fulfilled and it said that that generation shall rise up against this generation because they they repented and now we we have one greater than Jonah we have someone that has resurrected from history and has presented him alive Among Us amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord throughout time us or we we have been witnesses that Jesus Christ has visited us in our time I am a witness of What the Lord Has Done in my time and I have a well knowing to know that he's alive that he spoke to me that he could be my friend brothers that is a great Revelation and the scientist they could discern the trajectory of the eclipse but they can't see who is the one living among us they can't see the holy spirit that the holy spirit in itself is a sign of the res Resurrection amen amen the the holy spirit is a sign of the resurrection and when you see the Holy Spirit preaching it's God's preaching or speaking that's a sign and right now the world they're seeing the the skies and they can't see what's among them that Jesus Christ is alive among us that he is not dead he has resurrected he has resurrected and lives in me lives in you we Are Witnesses of this what a tremendous time we are living in the time of Jonah is fulfilled once again in our time the Lord said you ask a sign and I won't give you a sign except the sign of Jonah the prophet that he was dead in the womb but has resurrected and when he resurrected he didn't go giving p he went preaching to show to demonstrate that Jesus Christ is alive amen amen that's the sign that we have today the best sign that he is alive Among Us amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord are you following me isn't that something marvelous I Delight myself in the word and I dedicate all my time unto the word personal comments I've always left them aside because I give priority to the word because the word he is the word in for in letter form he is the word in form of spirit and he's the one that speaks to us amen amen if you can please stand beloved God lord lord we tremble today to realize that we are living in similar times likened unto those of Jonah that the people wanted to see a sign in heaven and they could not see the great sign that Jesus Christ was among them Lord today we live to similar times to those that we can see so many things yet we ignore to see Jesus that he is resurrected that he's alive and he lives in his people we are the sign of his resurrection help us Lord Lord I ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen amen and God bless you I am uh so sorry I spoke in Spanish I know the majority of the people here they prefer the English but that's how the lord gave me the message but uh I can preach any I can tell you I preach the same because I serve the very same God my God is
