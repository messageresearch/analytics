we're going to have our minister come up it's an honor to introduce our brother jimmy alkire to bring words of life if you guys can please stand how many are ready to receive we've done our part we've

[Music] [Applause] is [Music] lord [Music] one more time without no music just to sing to him without no music [Music] oh [Music] oh man [Music] oh [Music] [Music] but the reason that they can't and then the lord draws unto i have a little subject tonight i don't know you know yeah let me look at the clock even though i don't think this is deep you know me i'll try to keep it as simple as i can it is really simple [Music] and in spanish it doesn't give you the same meaning but in the old translation of the king james version valera when it says when the desire comes it means that when this desire comes to the sale it's not gonna stop it's going to continue until it produces something inside of you nosotros lord jesus and we're going to get into it a little bit god give us the grace amen so let's go to our first scripture in in proverbs chapter 13. proverbial where i majored on the first part of the verse uh why does it make the heart sick for torment because you thought it was something so sure that you would receive it and you kept waiting for it and you kept waiting and you kept hoping and it never so god is telling you now this desire you had that gave you a hope it let you down in other words it's the wrong kind of a desire but when this desire comes it is for all your mercy and your goodness and we just thank you lord for another day of life another day to serve you lord another day to express your love to this lost world express your word to your children that have been redeemed as he said oh what i would do if i had too literal blood blood drops of the blood of jesus [Music] christ [Music] how i would hold it over my heart but today i have a greater privilege than that and that is to speak to those that have been purchased by that blood yes yes but there's not one speck of desire in us to ever defraud your children even though we have many mistakes as humans amen amen you may be seated now let's turn to hebrews chapter 10 yes verse 2 you know why the lord spoke sunday all day actually but in the evening with brother william when he spoke about the salmon that just got me to see what produced that drive in the salmon and i want to recommend something to you young people that you'll love back in the year of 2017 our pastor brother caleb preached a series of messages how many remember this series the mind of the spirit [Music] where he really and i'm not going to go into that there because then i'll never get into my message but he he gets into what our conscience really is and he actually used this scripture and many others [Music] so i want to read this go get a hold of that message it shows you exactly what god is going to do in you and he's doing it it'll bring you to such a point for then would they not have ceased to be offered talking about the sacrifices of the old testament sacrifices because that the worshipers was through [Applause] and we know as we heard our pastor and we hear the messenger of the day that the word conscience there prophet says you no longer have a desire now let's go to first peter chapter 3 verse 21. very familiar now i want to read this scripture because we've had some new baptisms and if any of you are here tonight that got baptized are you on cloud nine right now uh floating around there oh that's good it's when god picks you up in your his arms oh he even he even rocks you into even amen but then as you begin to confront your everyday life there's still something in you that desires sin picado and what that serpent nature does it distracts you from the spirit of the spirit that's in your heart of that desire that when it comes it's going to produce the tree of life it distracts you from that to destroy the eso so watch how many know that little song every day with jesus is sweeter than the day before [Music] from up here i can get down and talk to you one on one you're not depending on yesterday's experience you appreciate what god did for you yesterday but you want to walk with him every day you're not dissatisfied with what you get at church don't misunderstand that i get super satisfied well our services are out of this world there will be a tree [Applause] every day with jesus he's the one i'm living for you become i might turn into a bitter old cranky man someday are you ready for a little bit more the like figure were unto even baptism that also now save you don't listen to the scripture correctly in english it says it's actually the word but it does save you see where i can figure now when to even baptism does also now save us in other words that nature that's fallen by the resurrection of jesus christ why he begins to raise you from the dead your baptism is an expression in the outward but it's based on something that's happening on the inside of you understand it's safe the baptism yes yes it saves us now we have a good conscience towards god but this conscious begins to struggle these desires that we have and you couldn't tell the difference you know my mind uh i would like to read a quote out of identified with christ and actually brother willow i'm going to read this one in paragraph 75 first or if we suffer with him we shall reign with him and god has given us the promise my whole desire completely begins to control me now there's something down in my soul and my whole desire is to be like him how many want to be like him [Music] this was going to be a preaching yes [Music] but at the same time i don't want to go too crazy because i want to make sure you get this well first of all i wanted to make sure that i got it the tree of life what does that mean yes significance that little desire this is the same beginning of the same goes down in that very gene of your soul that is so small before your life into existence it will take you to genesis 1 26. when your spirit was created in the image and the likeness of god amen we're going to get to something good something so when brother jimmy kicks the bucket someday we have to transfer it to you it's not just the young young but the older young no no we don't know how long we're going to be here but right now i've got doors opening up to preaching apostolic churches and i'm going to go and the pastors know out of water it's just something i have to express that i just don't understand now let's go down to paragraph 7b the second part it's that was paragraph 75 there but let's go down to paragraph 77 d i'll just read it from here then for right now he'll get it he's doing a fine job very well he knowing no sin and it's no more like than what is right it's no more than what is right no more than our duty is to look at these things and see these desires that we have that god put in us to create all right now we're going to go to a scripture that people think oh that don't even talk about me well you're going to find out it's exactly what it's talking about he's talking about us is do you see yourself in the bible do you see yourself in the message he created us this desire to make us want to be like him now what's this next statement because here i see proverbs 13 12. um before the real desire ever come forward and be identified with him in baptism is there anybody here tonight that would like to be identified with jesus begins to stand up my and then as you are planted oh my it reminds me of something that brotherhood said he said not stuck out somewhere oh a sea can't grow up it's not planted that's so simple to understand right in the likeness of his death you shall also share in the likeness of the resurrection now we're going to go to a scripture that everybody thinks is the scripture don't talk about me let's go to first corinthians and we're going to start with verse 10. are you understanding me a little bit how many of you if you repented and that were baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ you were planted in the likeness of his death that's why god's not going to get away let you get away with before i ever got the baptism of the holy ghost this flesh tried to get away with all kinds of stuff now we're going to get into it a little bit let's go back to youtube actually to verse nine brothers i i said ten let's go back tonight did i get your water brother sorry bro i didn't drink out of it i almost did y'all forgive me can put up with me a little bit oh man i'm in trouble can you all put up with me a little bit i feel a little bit bad amen but as it is written i have not seen nor ear heard neither had it entered into the heart of man the things which god had prepared for them that love him but now watch as god begins to search your life [Music] amen but god has revealed them to us by his spirits for the spirit searches all but notice as a foundation for the seals but when it says the good things of god we want to look around this space but it's actually talking about you understand aren't you of god can you so this scripture does talk about uh [Music] for the search of things it goes into you the very fact that you're here [Music] he sees the spirit begins to search us that's what he's been doing the ministry that's what we've been doing that's what the camp meetings were about god from eternity he's coming down and he's finding those he's coming down and he's finding though but he can't accept them back into his presence whether you understand it or not it's incredible the state of being profound the quality of being great an extent have such a great magnitude magnitude that we as humans don't understand in this fallen state it says you know the scripture says that he would pour out his spirit up on all flesh but he would never be able to live where he could go oh my goodness so can you see this scripture even though if you just read it like that it but the spirit of god el espiritu comes vienna he hides himself in simplicity in simplicity but then under simplicity of this creation even so that things of god knows no man i'm gonna say it this way there's things of the spirit of god no serpent man knows them now our elder preached that we by this wrong birth are serpent seed until you amen and they thought they were ready for the rapture because they couldn't even walk yet oops or daddy or papa showed you how to walk why you didn't even know how to talk but you hear daddy talk did you know he walked around as a memo brother said for a long time before his soul to please god [Music] it and our pastor says they're his only consciousness the consensus well he wasn't even conscious of themselves are you happy let's continue reading here amen let's go down now to verse 14. let's go back to verse 12 actually for we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us let's read that last part together where it starts but the spirit which is of god now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us oh according that he has predestinated [Applause] and he knows exactly what he's doing in your life there's so much of this that can stop and go in too much but i'm down to about 10 minutes amen which are given to us now verse 13 now these things are freely given to us what are we going to do with them don't stay in there don't tell your neighbor don't tell your best friend in the world [Music] there are people in the world i don't get along good with as far as the decent people they know that aren't there are christians i have no problem but i can't be who i am i'm trying to testify to them with my life no these things have been fully given to us of god we just read it which things we put on the shelf which things also we speak versus verse 13 bro in the beginning english now which things also we speak not in the words of which man's wisdom teaches but which the holy ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god [Music] the animal man or they are foolishness to him neither can he know them you know but he that is spiritual judgment of things and come your the spirit of god searches out all the things of god he gives you spiritual discernment he gives you the revelation of how to discern the difference between what's of the world and what's of god what's the difference between religion and christianity you know why we have a hard time seeing this go see that go in this little message the mind of the spirit and i wrote this down the best i could okay i might have missed a word or two adam was one with god in spiritual perception [Music] self-conscious the veil had been ripped and now he saw himself in a different way than he had never seen before he became self-conscious majority of you do so don't anybody think that i'm growing and indirect [Music] you'll never find that he was conscious of himself before the fall that didn't happen until after the fall now he saw himself through the eyes of the enemy rather than seeing himself through the eyes of god and i got this part i got it in parenthesis because i got it exactly right our pastor said in 2017 i am tired of seeing myself through the eyes of the enemy how many of you are tired face to face son how did it go today what face to face he but it could not annihilate sin from in the book of he was filled with the holy ghost but when he saw there nobody could come out and open the seals because when that desire would come forth it would be a tree of life so what is and it lets [Music] [Music] and you can see what you should have done has forgive me for screaming so much lord i just see this opening up lord for me lord it's not just for me it's for the children where i was when i was their age [Music] [Music] the spirit searched for me you know the speaker until he found me now i'm going to save you out of the way i'm going to sanctify you because i'm going to give you a new spirit i don't know the spirit never spilled them and then i'm going to put my spirit in you you [Music] [Music] [Music] it is a tree of life [Music] bless your children lord in the name of the lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] or foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Music] mercy rewrote my life oh mercy
