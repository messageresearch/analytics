lord jesus christ we pray amen and amen you may be seated this morning we're going to be watching the video if they would put it up it's the adoption part 3 video this morning so we hope you all enjoy god bless you and now the purpose of these lessons is to anchor those that have already come across the land the purpose of the studying this book of ephesians is to positionally place the church where it absolutely stands in christ we are cut out different we're made different we are nature different and we are positionally placed differently [Music] maybe one for just a little kind of a work another for a large work don't be scared of nothing [Music] one body which is christ and we are safe forever the question the question was asked yesterday by a theologian to me to me that's been canning the meetings you're hearing the tape [Music] because he's infinite [Music] [Music] [Applause] amen then adoption placing placing oh god how god's doing this on the word and now if i can god might be again i'm going to start right now the fifth verse i want to read it having three having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to his own good pleasure good pleasure of his will it's god's pleasure to do his will adopt adopting place placing now now what's he doing placing him replacing his church and thank you god gave his children a new birthday baptism of the holy spirit that's what the scripture said what worries me is to take people and preach to them this god sent truth and they'll turn right back around and just keep on doing the same thing and say they got the holy ghost this nearly ruins you what's the matter they come right back to the same thing just like the children of israel they wanted a king so this king could rule over them and make them act like the amorites and the amalekites and the philistines we should be so on fire for god we should be going day to night nothing should be able to stop us and we should be so sweet and so pleasant and so kind and so christ-like in our lives it takes every day's life how long is this salvation lasting how long what kind of salvation is it from church to church from let's turn to hebrews 9 11 just a minute just to look and see how long this for a few minutes turn over to look at hebrews let's let's find out how long this salvation is lasting see what kind of salvation is let's read now hebrews 9 11 but christ becoming a higher priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say this is the same teacher paul leather of this building neither by the blood of goats or calves but by his own blood he has entered in once how many times once unto the holy place having obtained salvation for a week salvation to the next revival what kind each channel redemption for us what's the word eternal mean eat christ [Music] after i have believed no man can call jesus christ only by the holy ghost there's all these three classes of people unbelievers make believers and believers but them wants to have believed unto eternal life has entered into the courts take the old tabernacle what's the first thing you do enter into the course of the jackal next was the brazing order where to wash the sacrifice at the golden lava the next was the killing of the sacrifice and the sprinkling of the blood upon the altar then once the year anointed with what with the rose of sharon perfume with precious oil in the head for a few minutes they poured it on his head and went plumb down to the hymns of his skirts watch when they took out a blood of the covenant the blood he was anointed and he had it garments on that had little jingle bells in him a pomegranate and a bell and that man had to walk in such a way that every time when he moved his legs and moved like this and made his steps he played holy holy holy unto the lord holy holy holy unto the lord holy holy holy unto the lord to be adopted into the family of god to be physicianly placed by the father and set into his service out here into his purpose of life for what god has called him for his walk must meet holy holy holy unto the lord holy holy only i've seen that i talk about that i'm talking about the spirit of god the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit we're children of god and if then children heirs heirs of god george heir to christ if so that we suffer with him that we may also glorify together what's everything waiting on what's the whole creation waiting for the manifestations of the sons of god it's waiting for the church to become into his position gather together all things in who how do you get in christ my one spirit we're all baptized into one body and that body is whose body already judged amen he took our judgment then what are we why don't i see the blood i'll pass over you and every time he looks at the body there it is sitting there bloody i'm in there about how the holy ghost these passes all over oh we have obtained an inheritance somebody has to leave you something god before the foundation of the world left you something a name written on the book that when the lamb would be slain why do you say jesus let you inherit beg your pardon jesus never left me an inheritance jesus never left you in inheritance he only came down and paid for your inheritance brought you to your inheritance but your name was put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world and god gave you your inheritance your inheritance is first what how do we get this how did we get it because we walked upright how do we get this inheritance because we were predecimated [Music] [Applause] let us stand this morning keep those clap offerings coming praise be to almighty god this morning thank him for

there's a lot of people that are out this morning sick all that the prophets have spoken number 14. amen with the subtitle when the almond tree flourishes [Music] just turn around and make your neighbor comfortable good to see you neighbor good to see what you got that's something on my glasses and i can't see amen let's turn in our scriptures if you would well to the book of ecclesiastes the 12th chapter and the fifth verse we want to pray that we can finish this this morning [Music] amen says also when they shall be afraid of that which is high and fears shall be in the way and the almond tree shall flourish and the grasshopper shall be a burden and desire shall fail because man goeth to his long home and the mourners go about the amen we can turn to one more scripture and it's found in luke the 21st chapter lucas and the 29th and 30th verse you can say man and it says like it says or reads like this he spake unto them a parable behold the fig tree and all the trees who is the fig tree sure that's what i hear who's the fig tree okay who are all the other trees there's a lot to all the other trees watch verse 30. this is very important when they not it there is more than one when they now shoot forth and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand may god add his blessings to the reading of his word and you may be seated once again the fig tree is israel and all the other trees are all the other nations as we see this and it says when they now shoot forth the word it's to push to the front but the work but the definition that we want to use today is shoot meaning to germinate once again now take that when we read it again when they now germinate then you know of your own selves now now very very we we've got to get this down this morning once again it doesn't say that when the fig tree shoots forth it says when they now shoot forth matthew 24 32 one more scripture and then we'll get into the message when you have it you can say amen i don't know i'm just asking because i'm very hot up here right now i was hoping somebody would agree with me turn on the fans a little bit but you too cold no so will the fans be okay you get cold just well raise your hand or something we'll just turn it off in honor matthew 24 32 says now learn a parable of the fig tree delegate when his branch is yet tender and put his forth leaves you know that summer is nigh now listen he said the generation that seen the fig tree putting forth its buds watch he said the fig tree and all the other trees in other words there would be a universal revival at that time and then he says now watch this prophecy how it works in como trabaja and just blends in perfect all the other trees putting forth their buds as brother branham makes this prayer in the message everlasting life and how to receive it how he explains this budding that's going on amen that old six start of david is waving over jerusalem tonight orlando for the first time in 2500 years that's good and bad trees they're all putting forth their buds the wicked ones are putting forth their buds romanism is putting forth its budget communism is putting forth its bugs and then he says and lord he's talking to the lord now your church is putting forth its buds watch as we see this unfold it is the fig tree and all the trees that are all putting forth its buds he says springtime is coming that's resurrection time right spring time is coming oh great master of life oh grand maestro de la to stretch forth the hand of thy holy child jesus he said when you see the fig tree putting forth its buds and all the other trees know that the time is nigh even at the doors that's where i want to start my message today they see the fig tree they see the other trees they don't have the spiritual application of the words israel parallels the spiritual church now watch i'm going to say it again brother branham is saying this he said they they understand natural israel they don't as we heard on friday i think we should all be awake this morning right it's a new year it's an awakening that's that is happening notice they recognize israel as a nation they recognize the fig tree putting forth its buds but they have not recognized some of the other trees that are also putting forth their buds it comes this is the message i and you must bring it through the time now watch once again the fig tree is budding when you see the fig tree budding all the other trees okay watch what he's saying here now because every tree you must bring it through time through the bible every tree now now i i i'm gonna stop here because i want you to to get this captain who is the fig tree again we want to learn this morning victory is who again now your neighbor because it's good to repeat things the fig tree is israel okay the next question is then who is the olive tree entosis i want to build you uh i want to paint you a picture this morning who is the olive tree now i ain't getting hurt this morning journal with the princess scriptures according we got to follow it through the scriptures now you got to take it through time take it through the bible find out who these trees are who israel but it is israel's salvation once again we we see that we have the fig tree israel as a nation we have the olive tree israel if you want to know that romans 11 is is the olive tree romano and you and i are the wild olive branches we come under the salvation party now watch this now the fig tree matthew 21. watch as we understand this under the olive god gave israel the privilege of being a nation in his sight and the vine is israel's spiritual state isaiah 5 7. for the vineyard of the lord of hosts is the house of israel if you lose track of of what how he's dealing with israel we then see that the lord as he began to deal with me about the almond tree first thing we do we look up all the scriptures about almonds there was a few not not very many no i knew that if maybe some of you may remember but there was something more that the lord wanted to is wanting us to know and that's why when when i read this scripture jesus is telling them behold in other words take notice you've got to make all right watch us now when they shoot forth or when they begin to germinate good things bad things it seems like everybody's getting traction everybody's ideas everybody's ideas right here's another group that just raises up oh my that's why it's so so appealing to so many people because it's not just a dead tree anymore how they're able to eat off these trees watch watch as it starts to bud it starts to bloom so when i see this i know that in israel that the almond tree is the first tree to blossom so why is this important brother is important once again the almond tree is the first tree to blossom with that in mind i want to pick up where i left off on friday the more i read this the more it blew my mind moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying jeremiah and i said this is jeremiah speaking i see a rod of an alban tree the unavara wait a minute i i gotta stop there for a moment because i know israel is the olive tree is the fig tree the vineyard i know that the almond tree is there's something special about it so here he says i see a rod of an almond tree the word rod la palabra also means to germinate so it means germinate is to grow or develop what are you seeing jeremiah he says i see the germinating of an almond tree i see it sprouting i see the creation i see an almond tree coming into existence and then the voice says the lord said unto me thou has well seen for i will hasten my word i'm going to produce that i'm going to perform that now listen closely jeremiah isn't is as he as he's speaking here he's seeing just a shoe come forth or not just but he's watching as the lord is going to hasten to perform his word okay zechariah 4 1-7 1-7 how many are following me so far we're clear so far right all right what do you see okay look at this i see the rod of an almond tree this this blows me away i'm telling you you'll understand in a minute so i asked the question on friday and i'll ask it again do you see natural israel you see spiritual church came again and wake me as a man that is waking out of his sleep welcome to verse 2 and said unto me what she is though oh now he's asking zechariah what sees thou and i said i have looked and behold uh he's looking and beholding now right a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof one upon the right side of the ball and other upon the left side so i answered and speak to the angel that talked with me and and now he has a question it was what are you seeing i see a candlestick but he doesn't know what it means so now he turns around and asks the angel what mean the the candlesticks and the two olive trees is the meaning of these spake unto me saying this is the word of the lord unto zerah babel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts i see the whole thing i see the candlesticks what is this i don't know what this is once again uh he says this is the word of the lord this is the word of the lord say not by might nor by power i am bringing it and no other way but by my spirit who art also established let's go to revelations 11 4. remember the question what are these revelations 11 4 revelations what are these these are the two olive trees and the two candle sticks jeremiah sees a shoot or a rod of an almond tree zechariah is the candlestick and two olive trees oh here we go now now we must find what the connection is with the almond tree the almendro and the candlestick that's are you with me you want to go on this ride yeah okay let's find out let's see what the connection is look at these candlesticks what these candlesticks estos candeleros were olive branches that did mean i looked at this almond tree okay look look at this up here what's this though the question what do you see give me that ah seven candle sticks a tree what's the representation of it the symbol is showing us something else catch the symbol we miss the revelations or do you see a tree obviously ah good answer yeah that's right what see us now can meet us now this is this this just gets me mr brown says these candle sticks were olive branches would you agree with that and they are all the branches sunbrella that just threw my almond tree idea out the window huh so if they were olive branches that deals with salvation and if i look at that and do not see salvation the humidity if those are olive branches i gotta be honest with you i'm telling you how i got this message okay i said lord i don't get it i see an almond tree olive oil and then he asked me again right he's saying he's giving you props he said now we all know wow thank you yeah we all know that these candle sticks and so forth [Music] into the root of the tamed olive tree are we making some progress here look at this again what see us now both jewish and gentiles okay let's let's go a little bit more here and watch this now so am i just looking at an almond tree i see an almond tree i see an olive tree i see both now i got a headache now i got to get up out of my office and go and say huh yeah i'm not kidding and then the light bulb goes off i see a tree of life oh my now it's starting to make sense i see a tree where life is are you with me revelations 22. lord how can one tree produce more than one kind of fruit and he showed me a pure river of water of life [Applause] it bears 12 manner of fruit and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nation watch an almond is it a nut oh i gotta go check all these things in my mind almonds are nuts you guys know how much i love almonds and when you search it out almonds are not nuts almonds are fruit we'll get into that in a moment so it makes sense then gotta make sure exodus 25 31-36 he's trying to mold this thing god is that it showed him but it was shall make a candle stick of pure gold yeah his shaft and his branches his bowls his knobs and his flowers shall be the same place six branches shall come out of the sides of it how many branches are on this right that you see i gotta say that again because that's not didn't come out right it is not just a branch i got to correct the holy spirit corrects me when i'm there it's not just a branch come out of the main branches how many of you know what the middle one is it's called the servant branch it feeds the other six watch that now he's he's gotta make this and and there's six branches shall come out of the sides three on each side three balls made like onto almonds that's why we see an almond tree the bowls were made like onto almonds with a knob and a flower in one branch three bowls were made like almonds on the other branch and a flower flower and the six branches that come out of the candles and in the candlesticks shall be four bowls made like unto almonds with their knobs and flowers you can keep on reading if you want but it was made out of one it shall be one beaten work of pure gold in studying jewish culture when god instructed moses to make the menorah moses lamented because the dimensions details and curves of the candlestick and instructed watch this is so so tremendous the seven golden lamps stands for candlesticks or lampstands was formed by god himself foreign it was the seven spirits of god that were used to produce a bride so foreign this one is not an exact of what it really is but if you take the knop the flower oh the has three sets three times on each side three is what anybody good in math nine so there's there's should be nine flowers cups and knobs which means that there are nine spiritual gifts nine fruits of the spirit fruit when you take these things now six branches in the middle one there is four and then okay there's not just three there's four in the middle wasn't there a fourth man in the fire make sure we get that so six branches with three each that's eighteen abraham to take thy son and sacrifice you take the number then on the on one side and so there's nine i know every nine sets times three is how many twenty-seven right that's the total number of books in the new testament if you take the on the other side there's 27 too but you count the middle right then there is what but there's four there's four sets there's three in each one we have any school teachers here i need help if there's four times three the set is three quarters her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him but he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest the eternal by faith but not only is the candlestick of gold it is of beaten gold hand crafted of beaten gold formaldehyde listen closely now according to her blueprints which were spirit given what she is dead come on church i want to i want you to go a little step farther now different kinds of classes but now i want to go a step further tomorrow well it all happened up where the angels of the lord appeared to me one morning and them squirrels was spoken into existence oh if you see the third pool in action here going hunting and there stood the seven golden candlesticks because they don't have the spiritual application they were that candlesticks was standing there on top of the hill with like a rainbow coming through the pipes and immediately after that the lord jesus appeared to us and i heard a voice that said jehovah of the old and in that day you will know it is the tree of life [Applause] does the engraving of the almonds on the candlestick represent what's with all the almonds and the flowers and all this is with me the cycle of the almond tree this and all the other trees summer's coming so the first thing it pre it receives a command to blossom itself in light pink blossoms the bees and other insects began to deliver pollen to the blossoms the first fruit then begins to emerge from the calyx and it resembles a flame of fire they will grow to their maximum size over a course of seven to eight weeks when does this tree begin to blossom it's the first street to blossom in israel usually around the end of january there's there's something here now at this time the first fruit may be hand-picked and the summer heat is what splits it opens there's so many things here and when it does it when the last day the seed inside is then revealed how tremendous that is and until you come behind the badger jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever that's his word made manifest afterwards the trees are shaken for them to fall to the ground they're beaten when i see this i say wow this is it's something that's so tremendous because watch this almond tree now what do you use what time i got up here but like 10 15 minutes more see man just just just let me get to get this across watch this now no no no notice this now take this day when we see this and we see how all this unfolds no wonder jeremiah saw an almond he was looking at a branch one branch and because it was carved out with almonds on it i see the the rod of an almond tree he wasn't wrong watch this now this is so so good to me to me i don't know about you but i mean we're in sunday school let's let's let's learn a little bit here that is mm-hmm watch there's where they put aaron's rod not in the outer courts they put it in here on the inside for one purpose now here's aaron with his rod maybe brother carlos will preach this one day if not i'm going to have to get it give you a little opportunity to preach on is the rod of aaron and the rod of moses the same rod watch this now aaron's rod lavara de arron must have come from an almond tree here he comes with his rod now when air when moses had the rod what happened to the serpent they fossilize inside what happened to it the same thing that happens to the serpent that is in our hearts [Applause] did you know that it usually takes between five and 15 years for an almond tree to start producing and maybe some of us serving the lord for a long time come on now so don't give up no just know that right now if you go into the presence of god he'll make you start producing almonds you don't have to that has been poured into the even before he was even dealing with a gentiles even before he was dealing with the gentiles dealing with his people he already thought of you enough do you see an olive tree oh we're attached now but i also see an almond tree glory to god watch this now as we come around the corner it wasn't enough just to have the seven candlesticks if it was just for light what is the awakening you get that i'm going to say it again without the designs without the engraving there is no symbol for the awakening no is [Music] oh my no wonder god covered the candlesticks in almonds and blossoms learn a parable it's not just what you see but yet it's in the details watch this now almonds are members of the rose family and you know what the almonds are known as the queen the almond is used for making oil in the home and medicine did you know that when jacob jacobo had that dream du of angels ascending and descending los angeles there's a lot of arrows for you young for you ministers i came to translation did you know that when he had the dream of the angels ascending and he said the bible says he called it bethel which means the house of god oh oh every tree all the way through the bible full attention just for the next five ten minutes right when the almond tree flourishes once again ecclesiastes 12 5. he goes on to say in that day when the almond tree flourishes the desire of man shall fail because he goes to his long home anybody know what long home means he goes to his eternal home the almond tree flourishes oh praise god when does the almond tree flourish brother brown says the church now then he explains that he says has come to a place that the people are realizing living in human they have not recognized the awakening of the bride they know something's supposed to step into the holy of holies all of a sudden there's a shaking you're wrong you're dry running it's starting to to move something's moving what's going on [Applause] established in the church through the holy spirit i believe it's called close enough it's a lot of weight it's hard right now and it needs somebody someone strong it needs someone strong stand with me and not just anyone anybody can stand by my side if he destroys me she destroyed me i don't know how strong you are to make it because this elder talking about about his ministry this elder porque brings the former reign alder means the former one which means the former reign rain then there has to be what is called the latter rain that comes and then he says that latter rain is you yes that's the rain of the harvest and you are the harvest but it cannot come until the elder brings the former reign which is the so when he says when the former reign and the latter rain come together when the almond tree flourishes or blooms former rain and latter rain come together in home time now this is the awakening as the awakening is the resurrection application what about the rest of them you know the great revival fire is not burning but what is it it's the end time seed sign is the words that have been sown the spirit of god begins to fall time of the rapture will be the awakening of the dead together may there be such a

announcement amen been a long time since i've been in front of all of you like this watch out tonight there might be a blue moon so we have an interesting project for you an amazon project how many believe that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever okay good this is going to go really well a couple of days ago me and the pastor got together and we came up with an idea as much of you know i am a writer and much a better writer than i am a speaker but most of the works i've written are works of fiction and most of them though they are powerful are not as powerful as the truth entertainment is great but the truth is greater then so we came up with an idea and i said stories are really powerful if you might have heard some of the stories i had heard that night your mind might have just gone away last and these stories aren't just stories from the bible they're not just stories from brother branham's time stories the stories that are happening right now there's stories that you could walk up to somebody and they might tell you you wouldn't believe it some stories that will make your faith grow beyond what you could imagine the word of the lord is a very bright and a very dark place the word of the lord is a very bright and a dark place but the stories we aim to tell you will make you grow in the lights so this is where you come in as fantastic as my my imagination might be is what i believe the stories that you can tell will be greater than the series some of you might have witnessed a miracle yes some of you might have seen something in the missionary field that you just might have never even thought to repeat and some of you might just have a testimony so tremendous it would rock somebody's world testimonial if you would like to share these stories there's going to be pieces of paper as you walk out there's going to be contact information to get a hold of me via email mail and phone number information and you can also write on the paper and just attach as many papers as you'd like when you give these stories back i will use the gift that god has given me to work with him in putting your story together um not to change it at all or make it fluffy but to tell it in a way that'll just grip you nope [Music] and it'll be exciting some of them will be sad and some of it might be scary but i promise you at the end of it you will know if you don't already know that jesus christ is the same yesterday that's really it that's all i had to say like i said the papers are in the back with more instructions and we'll be we'll be releasing these i believe episodically [Music] and it will be for everyone to read and see and we will have ourselves the title another book of acts libra de los amen god bless his word once again how many enjoyed that this morning for the word amen [Applause] before we go we just have a few announcements there'll be a trustee meeting right after service disposal and also we will starting tomorrow
