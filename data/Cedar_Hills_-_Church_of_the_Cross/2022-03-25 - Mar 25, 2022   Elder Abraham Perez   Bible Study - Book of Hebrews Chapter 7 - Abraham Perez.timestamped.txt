[1:02] hmm
[1:38] foreign
[1:41] so
[1:56] buddy
[2:16] [Music]
[3:59] you
[4:40] i want to give thanks to each and every
[4:42] one of you
[4:46] then make the effort to come to these
[4:48] bible studies
[4:54] tonight
[5:12] [Music]
[5:34] i think
[5:36] that we should stop
[5:38] on on chapter 7
[5:44] because that's all that brother priest
[5:49] and if you study the book of hebrews
[5:54] from chapter 8 to chapter 13
[6:00] most of it is
[6:02] self-explanatory the mayor is explicit
[6:07] [Music]
[6:19] it's self-explanatory
[6:22] and uh
[6:24] good thing that me and caleb are kindred
[6:27] spirits
[6:32] we were thinking about the same thing
[6:37] he said i'm glad you told me there
[6:38] because i was thinking the same thing
[6:46] so uh
[6:50] for this i think was one of the reasons
[6:52] brother venom because the apostle paul
[6:55] was an authority on the old testament
[7:07] so
[7:09] he talks about the priest and the
[7:10] sanctuary abraham principe habla del
[7:13] santorio
[7:16] so
[7:17] if you would be so kind santana
[7:20] and
[7:22] then
[7:25] and we shall read
[7:29] hebrews
[7:31] chapter 7 verse 11.
[7:42] if therefore perfection were by the
[7:45] levitical priesthood or under it that
[7:48] people received the law
[7:50] what feather need was there that another
[7:53] priest should rise after the order of
[7:55] melchizedek and not be called after the
[7:58] order of aaron
[8:06] kennedy
[8:24] so
[8:27] [Music]
[8:38] if it was by the little levitical
[8:40] priesthood
[8:44] for under the basis of it
[8:49] people received the law
[8:53] so then why was there a need that
[8:55] another priest should rise
[9:02] after the order of melchizedek
[9:06] and not
[9:07] [Music]
[9:16] [Music]
[9:20] you must
[9:30] how many remember going to
[9:32] church and they told us you women cannot
[9:35] wear a ring
[9:42] thank god for a prophet
[9:45] how are the people gonna know if you're
[9:47] married if you don't have a ring
[9:59] you are saved by the grace of god
[10:30] the purpose of preaching the gospel
[10:35] saying matthew 13 47
[10:37] [Music]
[10:44] again the kingdom of heaven is like unto
[10:47] a net that was cast into the sea and
[10:50] gathered up every kind
[10:55] of
[11:02] which when it was full they drew to
[11:04] shore and sat down and gathered the the
[11:07] goods into vessels
[11:09] but cast the bed away universe
[11:22] so shall it be at the end of the world
[11:25] the angels will come forth and severe
[11:28] the wicked
[11:29] from among the just as israel
[11:38] and shall cast them into the furnace of
[11:41] fire there shall be wailing and gnashing
[11:43] of teeth
[11:49] see through the net in the waters and
[11:52] got
[11:53] lizards
[12:13] and that is the same way when we cast
[12:16] the gospel net from behind this falcon
[12:20] yes yes
[12:24] and they come to the altar
[12:27] and they cry and they pray
[12:31] are they all fish that come to the altar
[12:49] because we were not sent
[13:04] 99 of you are legalists
[13:10] how many legalists in this country
[13:13] congregation if 99 percent in branham
[13:16] tabernacle says you are legalistic
[13:37] [Music]
[13:41] a little leg slips to go the other way
[13:45] here bruce 7 12.
[13:50] for the priesthood being changed there
[13:53] is made of necessity a chain
[13:57] also of the law
[14:00] candiable
[14:19] for he of whom these things are spoken
[14:22] pertaining to another tribe
[14:25] of which no man gave attendance at the
[14:28] altar
[14:38] the things we are talking about belong
[14:40] to another tribe
[14:54] so what
[14:55] is he talking about
[14:59] numbers 24.
[15:04] verse 17.
[15:06] i shall see him
[15:09] but not now
[15:11] i shall behold him but not high
[15:14] there shall come a star out of jacob and
[15:16] a scepter shall rise out of israel and
[15:19] shall smite the corners of moab and
[15:21] destroy all the children of
[15:46] the scepter shall not depart from judah
[15:50] nor a lawgiver from between his feet
[15:53] until shiloh come and unto him shall the
[15:56] gathering of the people be
[16:05] silhouetted
[16:28] for it is evident
[16:30] that our lord sprang out of judah of
[16:33] which tribe moses take nothing
[16:37] concerning priesthood
[17:30] hebrews 7 15.
[17:37] and it is yet far more evident for that
[17:40] after the similitude of melchizedek
[17:43] there are rises
[18:03] [Music]
[18:13] we finally had seven varieties of
[18:16] spirits
[18:20] revelation 1 4 apocalypses
[18:25] i'm giving you scriptures so you can
[18:26] study them later
[18:32] john to the seven churches who are in
[18:34] asia grace be unto you and peace
[18:38] from him which is and which was and
[18:41] which is to come and from the seven
[18:44] spirits which are before his throne
[19:04] the seven spirits before the throne is
[19:07] the spirit
[19:23] and lessons ministerios for the age in
[19:27] which each lived
[19:32] so if there are seven varieties of
[19:34] spirit is
[19:45] and immediately i was on the spirit and
[19:48] behold the throne was set in heaven and
[19:51] one said on the throne
[20:01] and he they said was to look upon like a
[20:04] jasper and a sardine stone and there was
[20:07] a rainbow around above the throne inside
[20:11] like unto an emerald aspect
[20:31] and we know that the rainbow has seven
[20:34] colors
[20:37] so that depends on the age and the
[20:40] messenger eso
[20:44] a different color is assigned to each
[20:47] one of those messengers
[20:49] [Music]
[20:53] and the first one was what color er
[20:58] red rojo most important color in a
[21:01] rainbow
[21:04] that's why it's the biggest one and
[21:06] that's the first color
[21:08] yes
[21:10] which red signifies what rocco
[21:13] significant
[21:26] all the colors represent god's purity
[21:33] represent the morris of god
[21:39] of god
[21:41] then
[21:42] through
[22:52] because it was a blood of sin
[22:57] because it came by carnal desire
[23:01] and when jesus was on the cross
[23:05] it was the custom when they were on the
[23:07] cross to break their legs
[23:13] are the ones that were on the cross
[23:17] to make sure that they were dead
[23:47] and the spirit of god moved up
[23:51] above the waters
[23:56] caused the earth
[24:01] where without form establishing foreign
[24:07] in darkness
[24:09] so he searched for you and me
[24:14] he searched through all the
[24:44] when we receive
[24:56] because god only sees nothing but the
[24:59] blood
[25:03] of his own son
[25:05] because jesus is constantly making
[25:08] intercession jesus
[25:53] you will do wrong
[26:15] [Music]
[26:22] example
[26:25] he said you take a three-corner piece of
[26:27] glass
[26:31] and let the sun heat it
[26:35] the pega it will produce seven perfect
[26:38] colors
[26:45] it brings up perfection
[26:48] powder sun and holy
[27:00] [Music]
[27:22] as long as
[27:24] the lord was in the pillar of fire they
[27:26] sinned
[27:31] because
[27:33] they in that time were still unclean
[27:35] creatures
[27:40] and there was no blood laid before them
[27:46] but then the lamb of god came
[27:51] the second step of god
[27:57] which is another officer
[28:00] the same god
[28:31] [Music]
[28:38] [Music]
[28:42] i
[28:51] [Music]
[28:55] there was in the offering of the shoe
[28:58] bread
[29:02] there was laying on the kosher plate
[29:07] in the jewish sacrifice of the cleansing
[29:10] of the tabernacle
[29:15] those three pieces of bread
[29:20] the middle one was broken
[29:24] that
[29:49] who is made not after the law of a
[29:52] carnal commandment
[29:55] but after the power of an endless life
[30:20] you see how legal as they were
[30:27] there was the law
[30:30] the old
[30:31] law
[30:32] said
[30:34] antigua
[30:54] [Music]
[31:17] and if not you should come to the altar
[31:19] so the pastor and the ministers can pray
[31:21] for you
[31:26] because the devil is on the rampage
[31:29] right now el diablo
[31:44] not
[32:05] [Music]
[32:11] so then in terms
[32:14] it is said of old times
[32:21] thou shalt not commit adultery
[32:25] but i say unto you
[32:27] whosoever looks upon a woman to lust
[32:30] after her has committed adultery already
[32:34] within his heart with earth
[32:42] you see
[32:44] jesus
[32:46] did not come
[32:48] jesus novino
[32:50] he came to magnify the law elvin opera
[32:55] you see how much harder it is now
[33:01] but remember in those days
[33:04] yes they didn't have the blood of jesus
[33:07] christ like you and me
[33:22] that's why when they died
[33:26] they went to paradise even
[33:29] that's why the witch of endor
[33:34] uh could call their spirit
[34:13] [Music]
[34:33] hebrews 7 17.
[34:39] for he testifies thou art a priest
[34:42] forever after the order of melchizedek
[34:46] is
[34:54] as long as a priest is needed he'll be a
[34:57] priest
[35:00] necessary
[35:13] that we have a great high priest that is
[35:17] passed into the heavens
[35:19] jesus the son of god let us hold fast
[35:22] our profession
[35:33] for we have not and high priest which
[35:36] cannot be touched with the feeling of
[35:38] our infirmities but was in all points
[35:41] tempted like as we are yet without sin
[35:50] okay
[36:01] for there is very a disallowing of the
[36:04] commandment going before for the
[36:07] weakness and unprofitableness
[36:09] thereof
[36:38] had weakness
[36:59] for the law made nothing perfect
[37:01] but the bringing in of a better hope did
[37:04] by that which we draw nigh unto god
[37:34] you
[37:42] because you still have nothing to offer
[37:45] god in propitiation
[37:53] and you repent
[37:56] not reform only
[37:59] and you say i don't want to stand on my
[38:02] marriage
[38:17] is not without an oath he was made
[38:20] priest
[38:25] the question is
[38:28] what is
[38:58] he said when you get married
[39:01] and you say i do you study
[39:06] you are obligated by an oath
[39:11] what is
[39:26] they were righteous
[39:41] after the order of aaron
[39:48] they were not made after the order of
[39:49] melchizedek
[39:53] they came down through generations
[40:36] tomorrow
[40:38] me and my sister yo
[40:41] last tuesday we went to a funeral
[40:48] we walked into a church that we hadn't
[40:51] been there for ages
[40:58] and uh
[41:00] and i i'm not criticizing
[41:03] i passed it away
[41:10] [Music]
[41:26] you better
[41:29] have a lot of patience because this is
[41:31] going to take longer
[41:55] he said do you have a program for for
[41:58] the service
[42:16] [Music]
[42:28] he
[42:42] he said but i'll say one thing
[42:45] mike is the best interpreter in this
[42:47] church from the benches
[42:54] yes thank you michael you've corrected
[43:09] i wish i had 10 men like my guerra in
[43:12] this congregation
[43:16] nobody wanted to do anything in the
[43:18] church
[43:20] you would always find mike by himself
[43:38] has given you a gift
[43:41] there's hardly very few people that
[43:44] make 80 years of age
[43:49] i'm glad you joined me my friends
[44:19] okay
[44:23] oh my god
[44:24] it's good it's good you know what it's a
[44:26] good to be a family it's one of the
[44:28] students
[44:29] anyway we went to this funeral
[44:34] video
[45:01] in this
[45:02] funeral
[45:06] we had been there for two hours and the
[45:09] minister hadn't gone behind to give his
[45:10] message
[45:30] it was it was a beautiful but
[45:35] but nobody had church orders
[45:41] and i'm glad that our pastor was cut
[45:43] with the same scissors
[45:59] way in the back
[46:01] because i am the eyes of the pastor
[46:06] you know he committed me to them
[46:10] and i see all these young ministers
[46:29] [Music]
[46:38] your neighbor here ross collins will
[46:40] join
[46:53] is
[46:57] thank you lord gracias
[46:58] there's different gifts a different
[47:00] testimony god blesses you in in many
[47:03] ways
[47:05] you know because he
[47:07] but when you give god first
[47:11] thank god you that means that you got
[47:14] money
[47:15] in the bank in heaven
[47:29] [Music]
[47:35] remember last friday
[47:39] it was a
[47:40] strong story
[47:43] when brother brown says i'm very strict
[47:46] on tithing
[48:03] god will get you another
[48:41] [Music]
[48:47] says regardless of conditions
[48:52] because some people get guilty minded
[48:58] that they don't want to face any
[49:00] judgment chaos
[49:29] is hosting a studio you say
[49:31] you know
[49:32] cremation is because regular funeral is
[49:35] kind of expensive
[49:41] but if you study the message
[50:02] that your body don't have to stay many
[50:05] years until it goes back to the dust
[50:20] [Music]
[50:37] you've got to meet him
[50:42] he has spoken a word
[50:46] and put a law with that word
[50:50] and the law is
[51:20] and the only way
[51:36] [Music]
[51:48] and by his own death burial and
[51:50] resurrection
[51:53] he proved his law
[51:55] right
[51:58] he said you destroyed this temple he
[52:00] said
[52:01] i'll raise it up in three days
[52:04] for he knew the law of god
[52:08] he knew that the word of god
[52:12] had been spoken by a prophet
[52:16] suffering
[52:36] by so much was jesus made a surety of a
[52:39] better testament
[52:44] hebrews
[52:48] but now have he obtained a more
[52:50] excellent ministry by how much also he
[52:53] is a mediator of a better covenant which
[52:56] was established upon better promises
[53:11] and there truly were many priests
[53:14] because they were not
[53:16] suffered to continue by reason of death
[53:26] look at all the prisons
[53:29] thousands times thousands of priests
[53:32] ministers
[53:34] but they had nothing but death
[53:38] and death
[53:54] but this man because he continues ever
[53:57] has an unchangeable priesthood
[54:10] he is able also to save them to the
[54:12] other moves that come unto god by him
[54:15] seeing he ever lives to make it
[54:17] intercession for them
[54:32] us
[54:32] who is holy
[54:34] harmless
[54:35] blamed blameless undefiled separated
[54:38] from sinners and made higher than the
[54:40] heavens
[54:49] sublime
[54:52] who needed not daily as those high
[54:54] priests to offer up sacrifice first for
[54:57] his own sins and then for the people for
[55:00] this he did once when he offered up
[55:02] himself
[55:20] for the law makers men high priest which
[55:23] have infirmity but the word of the oath
[55:26] which was since the law make it the son
[55:29] who is consecrated or evermore
[55:43] so the law and priesthood didn't
[55:46] accomplish
[55:59] it was a temporary thing
[56:03] but something greater was coming
[56:10] here we turn the corner
[56:14] revelation 12 1
[56:16] apocalypse
[56:20] and there appeared a great wander in
[56:22] heaven a woman closed with a sun
[56:25] and the moon under her feet and upon her
[56:28] head a crown of 12 stars
[56:40] we've been told we've been talking about
[56:42] the law
[56:45] so the sun here was israel or the
[56:48] orthodox church
[56:53] and the moon under her feet
[57:12] the law was a policeman
[57:16] and the policeman puts you in jail
[57:22] but it took grace to take you
[58:20] and we came in an exodus like they did
[58:25] they had a mexican from a natural land
[58:28] to another
[58:33] they were under the law
[58:42] [Music]
[58:48] sure remember
[58:51] the moon was
[58:53] under the feet of the
[58:55] when of the woman
[59:00] and the moon was the law
[59:15] if you were under the law
[59:17] [Music]
[59:22] [Music]
[59:30] you must not wear a ring
[59:34] you cannot wear bracelets
[59:37] and you cannot wear a necklace
[59:42] and on and on we can go
[59:57] when the centurion broke that cell
[1:00:03] it released god yes
[1:00:07] and he says that the spirit of god
[1:00:10] moved upon the water
[1:00:26] but he searched for us for 17 years
[1:00:36] he knew that she had more children
[1:00:40] and he
[1:00:54] and he
[1:01:17] [Music]
[1:01:32] [Music]
[1:01:46] [Music]
[1:01:50] he said you got wings
[1:01:54] come up higher
[1:01:57] so then like they were under the lawn
[1:02:01] and uh the moon was
[1:02:04] the
[1:02:18] this is
[1:02:21] it says that the moon reflects the light
[1:02:24] of the sun
[1:02:28] but then the moon turned to blood
[1:02:47] the bible says in hebrews
[1:02:51] god in sun right time jose and temples
[1:02:54] antiguas spoke through the prophets
[1:02:59] but in this last
[1:03:14] are we in an mexico
[1:03:19] are you still the moon under the feet
[1:03:23] well then the moon a reflection of the
[1:03:25] sun
[1:03:40] remember they were negated us from a
[1:04:24] and i was preaching from the sun
[1:04:29] he said come
[1:04:31] and you'll get paid here with the word
[1:04:37] and the majority of them didn't want to
[1:04:40] stay and they went away
[1:04:44] but you they will step and you instead
[1:04:48] and you instead and myself
[1:04:50] we stayed with the sun
[1:05:07] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[1:05:10] waters
[1:05:14] on the earth
[1:05:16] we're drawing closer to the sun
[1:05:39] yeah we're crazier than you know what
[1:05:41] amen
[1:05:43] it is i see it
[1:05:45] i could open it more but
[1:05:49] i mean
[1:05:51] it is i mean
[1:05:53] the word is so real
[1:05:57] yes it is how can we reflect
[1:06:01] if nobody wants to hear the word
[1:06:07] nobody wants to hear it
[1:06:10] it's a complete black hole
[1:06:14] who cares to hear the word of god
[1:06:16] nowadays
