[32:17] all these things we ask in your precious
[32:19] and most holy name
[32:22] the name of the lord jesus christ
[32:33] so tonight i i i i
[32:36] have this this thought is
[32:52] we work with these the young people
[33:06] they fight a war that that i don't think
[33:08] i i could have thought
[33:13] the day and age they live in is is
[33:15] unbelievably evil
[33:20] and and so i asked the lord i said lord
[33:24] what can i do what else can i do
[33:31] how can we help them
[33:35] is there something lord that that we're
[33:37] not doing that that's not being done
[33:40] help me lord says
[33:46] and as i began to to to to pray to the
[33:49] lord
[34:01] and as i began to read it a little more
[34:02] and a little bit more
[34:04] lolita
[34:10] you know as as parents
[34:15] we fight a battle just as hard as they
[34:17] do nosotros
[34:21] and our battle starts at the moment that
[34:23] they're born
[34:27] and our battle continues on through
[34:29] their life
[34:34] and a large part of the battle that we
[34:36] fight as parents
[34:40] and young people it's very important
[34:42] that you guys understand this
[34:46] a large part of the battle that we fight
[34:48] as parents for you guys
[34:53] is just to get you guys
[34:58] to the principles of the doctrines of
[35:00] christ
[35:02] principles and it's a fight that parents
[35:05] fight
[35:06] yes because brother branham doesn't miss
[35:10] it when he tells us
[35:13] that a lot of times we just want to
[35:14] fight
[35:28] is to try to get you guys to the
[35:31] principles
[35:32] yes and the doctrines of christ
[35:38] because that's your launching off point
[35:56] i always brag about you guys to your
[35:58] parents and the pastor and everybody i
[36:00] talked to about you guys
[36:05] different personas and i always say if
[36:07] you ask
[36:09] the young people
[36:13] just about any question in terms of the
[36:16] principles and doctrines
[36:22] they can answer you in heartbeat
[36:30] what's the first thing you need to look
[36:32] for in a husband yes
[36:38] character and they can they can give us
[36:42] the principles and the doctrines all day
[36:44] long
[36:48] but but i want you guys to understand
[36:50] something
[36:52] let me start off by saying well done
[36:58] i want to give parents and and young
[37:00] people please
[37:01] give each other a hand
[37:05] because you've reached the principles of
[37:07] the doctrines of christ
[37:11] brother sham would you grab that stuff
[37:12] for me from the back please
[37:16] but but i want you guys to understand
[37:18] something
[37:21] the principles and the doctrines of
[37:23] christ
[37:26] they're simply this simple
[37:29] hold on it's coming
[37:35] got it for me brother sam
[37:42] do i see that
[37:47] that's a kiddie pool
[37:52] principles in the doctrines of christ
[37:56] they bring you to the kiddie pool of
[37:58] christianity
[38:01] and it's a very comfortable place to be
[38:04] here yes
[38:06] you see because when when i'm in the
[38:08] kiddie pool of christianity
[38:12] i can get my safety llama
[38:28] and i i know jesus christ is a savior
[38:31] jose
[38:32] christo el salvador and i know all the
[38:34] awesome basics of christianity right
[38:37] christianity i know that i should look
[38:39] for character and a husband or your wife
[38:44] i
[39:13] but but here's the problem guys
[39:17] here aki there aren't any storms
[39:23] here okay i really
[39:26] kind of don't need god all that much in
[39:29] reality
[39:32] because you see right here i've got the
[39:36] principles and the doctrines that can
[39:38] sort of govern what i do
[39:40] is
[39:54] doctrine comes
[40:08] right
[40:11] but i want you to know something there
[40:14] was another there was another man in the
[40:16] bible
[40:19] that had the principles and the
[40:20] doctrines of christ
[40:27] and we find out that in the book of luke
[40:30] chapter five
[40:33] that that jesus comes to simon jesus
[40:36] vienna
[40:50] and noticed that simon had been fishing
[40:52] all night long
[40:56] and he had nothing in his boat you know
[40:58] another and he was depressed
[41:02] and he was really beat up and he was sad
[41:03] and he was tired
[41:13] and here comes jesus jesus and jesus
[41:17] says simon
[41:18] jesus simone simon looks up out of his
[41:21] boat says
[41:24] hi jesus hola jesus simon
[41:28] he said simon i want to show you
[41:30] something
[41:33] and simon says he see monday
[41:36] lord i've been fishing all night
[41:41] i i'm really tired
[41:44] i'd just like to go home and go to bed
[41:49] and jesus says simon jesus simon
[41:53] i want to show you something
[41:57] and simon knew the principles in the
[41:58] doctrines of christ
[42:14] simone
[42:26] you see the way that they fished in
[42:27] those days
[42:43] and it would sort of pin the fish
[42:45] between the bottom of the sea
[42:47] ponies
[42:51] and then the net then the net would
[42:54] close around the fish
[42:56] is
[43:22] simon turns the boat around simon
[43:38] he says hold on simon says
[43:41] simon simon launch out
[43:45] lanzate come on guys
[43:48] come on he's almost simon this is simone
[43:52] chow
[44:21] watch out to the deep jesus
[44:25] and you find something so tremendous
[44:29] because you see the problem is
[44:33] is that as long as we stay in the kiddie
[44:36] pool of christianity
[44:41] we will never find
[44:45] what the book of psalms tells us
[45:01] why is it that the lord is telling simon
[45:07] simon launch out into the deep sea
[45:12] book of psalms 42 7 tells us
[45:44] when it's nice
[46:10] do you know what a water spout is
[46:40] but
[46:53] is the one thing that you don't
[47:08] brother carlos carlos but listen because
[47:13] it's the holy spirit
[47:16] telling you
[47:18] [Applause]
[47:20] and he gets simon and they go out to the
[47:35] he never went around on the
[47:58] and it wasn't because the disciples
[48:00] didn't know the sea of galileans
[48:32] until you're
[48:46] when you feel like
[48:59] that you find the one
[49:41] we want to make major life
[49:55] oh you guys are fine you got this
[50:28] [Music]
[50:53] amen don't make your life decisions from
[50:56] kiddie pools
[51:04] stop thinking you know on your own
[51:29] you know what another thing the water
[51:31] spout is
[51:47] even though you guys can't possibly see
[52:31] you yelankel you could get in the pool
[52:33] at all
[52:34] kinds of times
[52:38] but if you wanted results
[52:41] you had to wait for the angels
[52:51] and if you got in there first he said
[52:54] but it wasn't the shallow little little
[52:57] little little
[52:58] kid
[53:03] [Music]
[53:09] and the waters are troubled oh
[53:15] and it went over your head
[53:19] why because when you're in
[53:23] the water that deep water
[53:41] [Applause]
[53:53] it stabilizes
[54:08] that
[54:20] but let me explain something to you
[54:33] because the anchor is always greater
[54:36] than the storm
[54:48] and the holy spirit begins on sunday
[55:03] and he wants to baptize you with
[56:01] but you see it's fine to go out into the
[56:04] deep
[56:07] oh yes jesus
[56:11] it is fine to go out into the deep yes
[56:16] but the prophet jeremiah takes it one
[56:18] step further
[56:21] because the prophet jeremiah takes it
[56:24] one step further
[56:28] and he says
[56:42] the prophet jeremiah takes it
[56:45] and he says now that you've launched
[56:49] it he says
[56:54] he says
[57:04] [Applause]
[57:24] and you dwell
[57:37] the harder that anchor
[58:06] uh
[58:20] we gotta
[58:45] then every wind of doctrine that comes
[58:48] across
[59:05] [Applause]
[59:16] that's
[59:57] i'm going to tell you this and i'm going
[59:58] to tell you this and i'm going to tell
[1:00:00] you this
[1:00:02] don't make life decisions
[1:00:07] until you've gone to the deep yeah
[1:00:26] how many times have you guys asked
[1:00:27] questions
[1:00:31] what's my purpose what am i doing here
[1:00:36] where where am i supposed to go
[1:00:39] and here's jesus on your boat
[1:00:49] come on almost come on young people
[1:00:51] almost overness
