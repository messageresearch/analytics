word of god and you can give the lord jesus another one amen so happy to have the reyes family here with us tonight and they sure did a good job raising their son a and he came thither unto a cave verse 9 chapter 19 and verse 9 of first kings unto a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the lord came to him and he said unto him yes lord jesus senor jesus we are happy to be in your house tonight to come and say some things great things of that you've left us we ask father a special prayer lord for our founding pastor especially that you will bless him bless brother william that is taking care of him and all the nurses and the doctors and give i was telling brother jimmy i'm going to try to do something that i probably doesn't account to but i'm trying to do a little bit something different now we we we see the story here of elijah many many times i and i say myself when i speak about elijah you speak about fire you speak about a man of the wilderness man that's not afraid of nothing you find in this portion of scripture yes elijah had already defeated 450 prophets of the of of the so-called god baal uh and he had put them all to the sword and they he had killed all of them and as he did that finally he goes out and one two three four five six seven times and the seventh time he sees uh that there is the cloud the size of a man's hand then in chapter 19 he's and this is where we find the story tonight he came into the cave lodged there and the word of the lord meets him there you know and he tells them what are you doing here he said and he said i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts you ever find yourself that way you'll usually find yourself that way in your cave you'll find yourself when you're by yourself in your cave and god you hear the [Music] we ourselves have seen the mighty hand of god and if you ever want to be on your own go find a cave where you can dwell in buy a bus where you dwell in aid is only going to teach you one thing and instead of doing the miraculous for god and we get depressed and we start complaining to god and they're seeking my life and i'm the only monster that's the word of the lord tonight are you doing are you doing here can i tell you what brother branham says [Applause] in this fire yes now i want you to notice he sees all the supernatural miracles because god was not in the fire have you ever heard the sunrise nobody not in have you ever heard do fall asleep you know we've seen firefall you know i have seen paralytics walk god that in order to be able to develop a when god speaks to you don't do this naga says no i want to see a fire oh yo yo i need to see an earthquake i really want to see the wind come into the church and do this i want to speak in tongues but how about staying quiet with the lord and you raise your hands i say lord i want to rededicate my life i want him to become become my friend you won't feel you will might you won't feel the impact of an earthquake this is what brother branham talked to the man about yesterday he said do you love the lord jesus with all your heart yes i do yes then you got it what do brother carlos enter but we are expecting a great waterfall and yet he might be a waterfall but today i ask you the question what are you doing here question the same question that god asked elijah 7 english vietnamese that have not bowed their knees now we are cells nosotros means coming to the understanding brother he sees in chapter 18 the the hand the size of a man's hand and capitalism listen did you ever think what the offices of the church is and when you need something to every person except the office and what do you think brother okay stewart what do you think sisters dude there is no office you know that is open for any problems we have gonna come accustomed that unless we see um we don't believe no cremos we have gum come accustomed [Applause] because is as we heard this morning and he says moreover the lord spake unto moses saying take thou also unto the principle spices and it speaks about five principal spices don't look too much into it no not that here's my word right now no no no you can read this when you get home five principal spices cinco species principal and it gives you the quantity to put into this anointing oil and you say i just need olive oil to anoint me olive oil now with that that's one spice yes it doesn't matter the oil that you use [Applause] and when you go to us and you start saying it always gives it also gives you the amount [Music] kind of looks like ephesians 4 11 and 12. god has set first in the church complainers murmurs you can complain about anything you wanna [Music] [Applause] and he gives you the quantity of that person if you look in the book of romans romano's those are nine spiritual gifts that are given to men god i can get it on all my own moreover the lord spake unto moses it's speaking about anointing calamus and it keeps on going and it talks about the anointing oil i talked about the olive oil without these five ingredients you cannot be properly anointed that's why you hear brother branham say one thing oh yes and you get and you repeat something different you know why because you're not anointed correctly or the king or reign or the congregation anointed correctly with the word the word says this is not set in the church it's just personal in regulation and you stand up to the point against the people with the anointing oil how many are afraid of a mosquito pontos and i'm not talking about baby shark doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo baby sir i'm talking about sharks you're afraid of sharks one two three four five okay but little third the rest don't know if they're afraid of targets right do you know on an average year a new annual you know in the average year in the last hundred years but we're not afraid to go and do the sins of him because they're the mosquito and the mosquito is a little bitty dude and you're any place you know i i just don't know about that brother and you know that brother did me oh i said man and you know i'm going to stop going you know i didn't like that that's it you know you know you know what you know what what in so many words in encounters the catholics say about protestants they say the protestants say that we are the great we are the prostitute the great prostitute he says you see protestants jumping from church to church to church to church we say people jump from church to church like they don't know where they belong to them gave what god wants from you look at your schedule is a surrendered maybe you don't take it from him but you maybe you don't take it from me either but you're friends from the world no good all they are doing is sucking your life no casting is stupid to be there all they want is what you have get to look into genius but they don't want to take that to the promised land i don't want you to have it they want to take it away from you they want to give you another fire you're my friend if you're hanging around with people that do not come here you are you are just hanging around with suckers cause all of humanity to fail and instead of converting him he converted this is why we don't have no strength i come to church that if i don't have strength he gives it to me after every day after ever you know why there's no relationship and without a relationship the bible speaks to us that they are the little foxes that spoil the violence malaria carries thou hear andre andreas what do that here baby this guess is still king what do you do but he comes to you and vienne ousted as a gentleman and he says this way i'm going to tell you you see there's a man that gave his life for us he left his glory gloria he left his majesty listen
