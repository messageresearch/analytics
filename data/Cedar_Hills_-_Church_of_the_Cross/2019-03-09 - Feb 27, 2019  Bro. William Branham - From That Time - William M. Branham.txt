bow our heads down for a word of Prayer II will start right into the service and we're going to ask the Lord Jesus to bless his word that we read now our Heavenly Father we come tonight to ask you to receive us as a people as your church and this building which is call here the Madison Square Garden of Phoenix I pray the Heavenly Father that you will sanctify this building that the angels of God will move in or we realize that it's not the building that we're in it's the people in the building it's not the building that makes the church it's the people inside of the building and I pray thee Heavenly Father that this the purchase of that blood tonight being gathered here the people that will live forever in a world that is to come and we've come here for the purpose of fellowshipping through the Holy Spirit and enjoying the Word of God as brother David du plessis our teacher and many others are bringing the word and that the Holy Spirit might come and convince sinners are there wrong I am with brainiest present soap near on to us that all the peoples would want to serve Him granite Lord and there's no man that's able to open the book our to loose the seals thereof but there was a lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world he come and took the book out of the hand of him that stood upon the throne for he was worthy Oh of God come tonight in our tents farming power and take the words that we shall read and reveal them to us in the power of the Spirit when this service shall in tonight may ever unbeliever that's present become a believer may lows that are fallen from the way renew their vows the sick be healed and when we were on our way across the city in different places may we say like those who came from Emmaus that day did not our hearts burn within us as he talked to us along the way then father we would pray that you would do something outstanding tonight that would attract the attention of the people through thy word make thy word alive to us we are able to read it who has enough education to read we can read it but we cannot make it live it takes the spirit the Holy Spirit to make the word live may it live in every heart here tonight we asked in Jesus name Amen do you are keeping record all the texts that we read I would ask you tonight to turn to the fourth chapter of Saint Matthew's Gospel the fourth chapter and we will read the 16th and 17th verse for a reading and the the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them that said in the regions of the shadows of death light is sprung up from that time Jesus began to preach and to say repent or the kingdom of heaven is at hand may the Lord at his blessings to the reading of his word now for a I wish to take the let the first three words are the 17th verse from that time you know there's we as people tonight can think back of certain times certain things began there's no doubt in my mind but what many people here can recall certain time that something happened and you say and from that time things were changed like a child he can say that I was a good child a good obedient boy or girl I'm one day I met up with a companion and they persuaded me to to do a certain thing and from that time it started how many times can we think of things like that that's happened in our life and we mark it from that time then we can think of the immoral woman she might say as a girl I was raised in a Christian home I was brought up with good parent and good Christian teaching and I was married to a fine Christian boy and our home was beautiful and we had two little children our soul and one day I was down in this city and I'll run into a girlfriend that I used to live in the neighborhood with her and she persuaded me on a date and from that time my home has ever been the same it could be all so that's the jump the alcoholic might say I was raised in a home that did not believe in drinking alcoholic beverages and I never drink in my life until one day such and such a thing happening from that time here a few years ago I was on my Road just south africa and i had to stay over two or three days in New York because I thought I could get by without having the yellow fever shot but they just wouldn't let me board the plane and I had to take the shop and wait for so many days and I had a meeting and there was a minister brother bird an outstanding noted full gospel minister of New York witches was a chaplain in the last war and they have missions down on the Bowery and he said to me brother branham how would you like to go with me tomorrow down diary that's what we dislike Skid Row in Chicago and I said brother Berg I'd be happy to go with you to the berry and we went down there and my heart ached when I seen man lay on the streets that was in such a terrible condition laying up against an automobile and their clothes all soil from the waist down and not even knowing what they were doing and some laying back in their alleys and cross each other just at the end of the road we went into a mission which the church sponsored and the pastor after meeting him he said we taken 180 carts from this building in a year of those alcoholics that came in to this mission and died here all services going on or doing the night a hundred and eighty and then I went out on the streets I thought is it there something can be done about it and as we walked I said brother Barry I suppose all these man year was raised up in the slums and never had a chance all he said you'd be surprised brother branham you should talk to some of them and I said I would like to he said if we can find one that's not so far gone that we could speak to him I'd like for you to talk I said all right and a certain fella we raised up and he spoke team said can you hear me said give you a drink I said I'm a a minister I would like to know why that you would throw your life away like this when I said minister roused up and looked at me and he said excuse me sir for asking you for enough money to buy me a drink but you don't know my chase I said sir I sympathize with you my father drink any drink all until death tucking I'm not making you the worst person in the world but I would like to know a man that's got enough decency about him to excuse his self when he sees that he's done wrong how could you ever throw your life to this he said son I can almost point my finger and show you with my eyes the bank that I was president of I said sir is that truth he said my name is such-and-such a name you might go to the bank and see if that's right or not I said how did you come to do this he said I had Christian training and I was once the member of the church a simple what caused you to do this said one day I'd come home from work I had a lovely family and a beautiful wife he said that I found what we call a Dear John letter laying on the table my wife had gone and from that time I tried to drown my sorrow with drinking oh I said I wished I could take you back to that time that time if he could only go back to that time I talked to a young woman some time ago who was in the emergency room she was from the psychopathic they're a great meeting at Flint Michigan and they had maybe 30 cases of insanity in the room and they said you could not bring him out in public because they were in straightjackets and in all kinds of conditions and I went into the room and one man went with me and when we went in there there was a beautiful young woman looked to be about 20 or 25 years old sitting there I said how do you do she said how do you do and I said well it's hard to know which way to start and some of them out of their minds and screaming and and people watching them and she said if you don't mind sir I'd like for you to start with me I said with you she said yes sir I said you're not a patient are you she said yes sir I am well I said you seem to have your right mind she said I wonder and she said could you listen to my story just a moment I said certainly madam and she started telling me she said I was reared in a good home she said in my mother taught me not to do wrong to a shun evil and to embrace the right thing she said and I live that kind of life for a number of years and I got mixed up with a young man and she said if the calls the disgrace to me I accept I just started and told myself away you know I become an alcoholic said then they picked me up and sent me to a Catholic institution called the Good Shepherd's home so there I was under correction for a number of years and then they release me and as soon as I got out from that I started drinking again and said then I'll serve a year or two and woman state prison and said then I had changed from Protestant to Catholic then doing this time I changed back the Protestant again from the chaplain talking to me and said I'd come out and try it again but said I went right back into it again into prostitution drinking and I said to your mother she's dead your father dead I said what do you think they would think about you now she's a no if I could only go back in here I said a lovely young woman like you don't you desire to be married and have babies like all mothers do and so forth she said I would love to sir but look at me what could I offer anyone I said you've got one thing you can offer she said what's that I said you're sold to Jesus Christ she said sir he wouldn't receive it I said oh yes he will so how do you know he would have tried I said yes you're just turning pages but you really come to him she said what could he do with me I said make a lady out of you said not me I'm too far gone I said he can take you back to the time when you was a virgin innocent girl the blood of Jesus Christ is sufficient and powerful to transform the vilest sinner to a blood wash I got this before God she said I've tried that so many times I said I want to tell you I believe your case has never been diagnosed right I said you don't want to be like that she said certainly not so just what you mentioned a while ago is what I want to be a mother with husband with babies someone to love in someone that loves me I never spoil a man's life I said you don't have to I said that this may sound old-fashioned sister but it's the truth nevertheless if some devil it's done that to you it's the devil it's got a hold of you driving you to things that you don't want to do she looked at me with those big dark eyes and said I've always believed that was the truth I said would you kneel here with me she said now they tell me I'm I'm a mental case I said you are but upset Jesus Christ restores right mind there's nothing too great for him and she said do you think he would for me I said certainly but we've got to get that devil out of there before he can war he entered when he was a young girl he'll go out and you'll go right back to that place again and she got down on her knees and I asked her to pray and she prayed for a few moments she looked over at me and she said brother Branham ah now I'm going to make a new start I said sis they won't do one bit of good you're going just exactly the same road you've been over it won't work and she said I I don't mean it in my heart I said I know you do but that Devils more stronger than any mental powers that you could to him that's the reason I don't believe in an intellectual religion I believe a man's got to be born together the holy just got to be deeper than you're thinking got to be an experience and she said what must I do us and just stay right there and we prayed and prayed I went ahead and pray for some more people and come back she was praying I come back to her again and a chihuahua come back and she was getting deeply in sincerity in a few moments she dump of tears running down her cheeks she look me in the face she said brother branham what things happened I say you don't have to turn though new pages now the woman's married you got a family a lovely sweet board to get the Holy Spirit filled st. gall God could take her back to a place or she started to do wrong that's his goodness and from that time she was a changed woman from the time of a young girl to at one time she was evil God take her back and from that time she was different those things of turning new pages that's good we think that's very good just like after the First World War many of you man in women can remember that perhaps I was a little boy of about eight or nine years old I remember well I've even ministers saying war is over we'll never have no more Wars that's all settle down we just can't have no more Wars because we got poison gases and so forth many you remember that the nation told us waters are settle for good they omit that from that time they said they'll beat him all along but we had them just the same when they begin to see rumors rising up nation turning against nation they formed what was known as the League of Nations to police the nation's they tried that see that was mental but it did not work if daughters tied into one of the greatest wars we ever had after that now they've got what they call the UN police the nation's again but it will fail just as sure as two twos are four it's got to fail they think it's good which it is but as long as mental thinking it doesn't do it it takes Revelation spiritual revelation all those things as good as they may be trying to join Church that's good I think everyone ought to join church that's good as far as it goes but that's not secure I think that everyone ought to take their choice as American citizens to join any church that they want to and I think that we ought not to dis fellowship that person upon their convictions I think we should all fellowship with one another asking God's mercies on us all but that's not the thing yet every new year's man will make a pledge go out and write on a book maybe on the Bible sheet and say I'll never drink again I'll never smoke again I'll never be untrue to my wife again and less than five or ten days they've broke every vowel delayed see they're making it by mental conception that's why many people join churches because they fear hell and they come and put their names on books and go out but it doesn't not lasting all those things are temporal but there is a time when a certain thing can happen and from that it's different really different that's when man meets God things change when man meets God a man can never meet God and ever be the same again you will either be a better person or a worse person you'll be better off or worse off after you meet God it depends on what you want to do about it but a man can never meet God and ever be the same whatever your attitude is towards God healed your eternal destination you can walk across the line between grace mercy and judgment and when you spurn grace so many times you can separate yourself from ever from the presence of God or you can accept him and have eternal life and never forget at the last day in the general resurrection oh no I am that there's something that we can point back to and say from that time something happened let's take some man that met God that changed their destination in the destination other their generation let's take for instance Abraham he was just an ordinary man he was not a saint he was just a man and all I'm so glad that we don't have to be born in a certain liner or be some great somebody we just have to be humble God's graces what does the word Abraham just the name down perhaps in the bushes one day in the valleys of the Shanghai Valley in the south of city of error wandering about out of the bush maybe with his sheep or so forth and God met him I spoke to him at blasting off believe that a man comes to God and ever has a definite experience or maybe you think I'm beside myself but look I don't need an impersonation of an experienced we've got so much of that today till it makes a real Christian sick to look at it somebody trying to impersonate somebody else God has ever made to the same he never did any never will God's a God of variety makes big hills and little hills and deserts and swamplands and want more he's a god body don't try to impersonate anyone else be what you are what God made you Abraham God spoke to him he had a definite experience and it changed his life and the strange thing is when a man meets God he can never be the same and can always point back to that time when he met him God spoke to Abraham and Abraham acted different and every time a man meets God from that time on he'll act ever if he rejects God he'll be on infidel right or he'll be an impersonator a hypocrite or he'll be a godly hated person and a lot different talk different less different at different peculiar odd letter the Holy Spirit let me tell you something is my brother and sister I have never had a god help me to never be that ever tried to be somebody that's when you're nothing twist myself and such great big things still have to have thousands of dollars tonight the sponsor some program let me be just brother branham let me be just what God would make me to be no matter what it is if it's the Saudi crackers and Drake Greenwich Water Well overhauls whatever it is let me be what God would have me to be never tried to be something that you're not Abraham he was different from the times God met him and the sometimes when God meets a man it looked like Abraham could have had the world in his hand the apostles with great powers could ahead their hand as it was the same go to spread fame everywhere but that kind of fame soon dies the only lasting fame is when your name is humble life that's when Fame is real thing this earthly things so decays now look at Abraham God told him to believe it and accept the miracle that had not yet happened and was impossible only with God for it to happen that was to believe that he is going to have a baby by Sarah and he believed God and called anything contrary to it as though it was not Abraham from the time he met God he was a changed man Moses was that inter lecture giant he had all the wisdom of the Egyptians that he could teach their teachers he was intellectualist he could be smarter far smarter than our most brilliant man today cause the Egyptians had things that we don't have today they could build her fear made we cannot they could embalm the body and make it look natural for hundreds and hundreds of years 72 hours is our limit they could put dying clothes that would never fade out we cannot do that many things that they had dig up things that they had that we could not we could not do the same today they were way smarter more intelligent and Moses could teach them but all of these intellectuals have never met God oh I'd like to see the preachers in here just a minute do you see brethren my fastest Methodist Presbyterian Pentecostals whoever you may be you can have a call of God on your life you can know that you're called to the ministry but you have no right to preach the gospel until you've had an experience with God of being born again Jesus told the disciples you wait in the city of Jerusalem until your new with power from on high Moses could not go down and deliver the children of Israel until first he met God paste the face and talk to him Wow most can say I was learning all the wisdom of the Egyptians but one day I was hurting my father-in-law's sheep at the backside of the desert I uh seen a bush burning and from that time he was a different man he didn't rely upon his intellectuals he was running from Egypt where God had called him but as soon as he met God he took a mule and his wife and his tongue and a little crooked stick and went down to Egypt while he had met God and from that time he was changed there was something different his intellectuals were lost he didn't think about the danger while he admit God he could point back to that time no man has a right to preach the gospel no person has a right to call themselves a Christian until they can go back to a certain time their life where they can come on that sacred sands at the backside of the desert where they know that they have met God all the infidels in the world needs intellectual Giants taken the Bible to explain the way all the days of miracles are passed there's no such a thing as divine healing all this stuff like speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues and gifts of healing and the baptism of the Holy Spirit they can slickly and take your mind and twist you in such a way until they can take that away from your memory they can explain it away I want you to get this and don't you never let it pass from you but if a man's ever stood on that sacred sand that's the backside of the desert when he needs God face to face there's not enough Devils at all get away from him he knows he met balance he knows he had an experience he talked to God regardless of what the opposition is he can say something oh well I can call the time and a little saloon that's being used as a church where some colored people was preaching the gospel how does a southerner net like colored people and a vision Kenan told me where to go find it and all the white girls that I've worked with both not all of them for five standard said Billy you're not going in there there I said yes I got to go so don't ever ask me for another date it doesn't make any difference on miss Garland Ventris that time has changed and point back to that time I was changed no man has right to forbid until he's got an experience no matter what the intellectuals can say you know you met God why intellectual knowledge would've told or just walked into his own death but he knowed he had met God and God was fun and still God the reason I'm so glad I can stay here just arena tonight gives shapes an uppercut that says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and can prove it by His Holy Spirit here now not altogether with the word the word only porn Swaney but the Holy Spirit declares it and he's the same learn his blessings and his his promises we can say from that time something happened Mary was just an ordinary girl a good girl a virgin I'm go to say she is 16 or 18 years old engaged to a man Joseph now she was just an ordinary girl she loved God she believed in God but one day on her way to the welcome to get some water not because she was a virgin thousands of virgins millions we still have virgins but we can only have one Mary she can pull her finger from that time Oh God take us tonight to the wells of water that we can say from that time at Madison Square Garden Phoenix Arizona from that time something took a whole journey I had an experience doubts fell away from that time that time sure it was from that time Paul a persecutor of the church oh that little hook knows June show the power of decision of the church they had the keys that's true i watch how they made their decision talking about what the church can do the church has only got one key that's bad the church doesn't save you you remember the church by birth but the church doesn't save you is Christ that saves you it's not coming in contact with the church is coming to contact with Christ and then automatically you're in the church the church had the keys Jesus told him he gave him the keys look how they used it they said now it's written in the scriptures the scripture must be fulfilled but let another take his bishop read talking of Judas and he said let's choose one that has been in out among us and they had to they fine fine cultured man good man justice religious as they could be to the key man that were good reputation and they cast her lots and chose the Phoenix for what good did it do there isn't one thing record in the Bible that's if they ever did not one thing just a good old deacon or something another light but it is supposed to be an apostle God went over and chose a little old hot tip no church hater it shows that God didn't take nothing and make something out of it that's what me that's the reason I join myself tonight in the people at faith in this world is called holy rollers people of life up way up in some great bracket but many women spin of the gutters take it away from the things of the world home let's met God peace - peace and God has made Saints out of the enemy it's Amazing Grace how sweet the sound god does it that way they can point back say yes I was no good I took the name of the Lord in vain I did this I smoke I drink I was this way that way but from that time God things change no more drinking no more things in the world like past some death under life and from that time I become a new creature in Christ Paul Church hater Saint hater very religious hot-tempered persecuting the church sassy but a very intellectual man God said I'll just choose him now today half the church' deny him I'm God tuck him down on his road to Damascus that comes the killing of fire that led the children of Israel before they blinded him and made him fall to the earth he took that man and Paul could say this one time I was a religious Pharisee a Pharisee of the Pharisees I had good reinter let your back trainings but all of our education and all my intellectuals I had to forget to know how did you do it Paul I was on my road to Damascus to rest those people and a light shot from the heavens and struck me back I did from that time a man from that time he was a changed man Peter the fisherman would have liked was hired by blind boy you miss that late at the gate as we talked up last night the blind man could say I was blind or come in contact with God and from that time I could see oh yes if your spiritual blind come in contact with him in from that time you can see everything that comes in contact with God is changed the leper one time come in contact with God and he was changed from the leper to a well man that was the immoral woman one time met Jesus at the well she was full of sin her heart was heavy fat versions were too to better society uptick drought she stood there and seen just an ordinary Jew a fella honey aged for his looking age for his age I think the scripture claims that he looked to be 15 when he was only 30 and he said you're a man yet not over 50 years old and say you have seen Abraham you said before Abraham was I am so he is only 30 or 32 years old I'm a young beautiful woman come up one day to the well or he was setting tired and he said to her woman bring me a drink and she said it's not customary for you to ask me such things that I'm a Samaritan your Jew segregation he said but if you knew who you were talking to what was that woman doing she is meeting God she met a man but it wasn't a man it was God let that soak in the scripture said you've entertained angels not knowing what you were doing unaware of it same as Abraham entertained angels and immediately at the angel lesson have performed the miracle before him he called the man god help him they Almighty God painter eaten steak sandwiches drinking milk from the cow eaten cakes and he was Almighty God the woman little did she know look what have done for Abraham man it changed him and Sarah from role man role 100 years old back to you they met God that's like none of the difference this immoral woman she met Jesus and she spoke to him watch Haim 8701 he said woman go get your husband and come here she said I do not have any husband he said you said well boy you've had five husbands and the one you're now living with is not your husband you've said well and from that time she was changed oh what a difference but Jesus when she met him there looked like a man and when I could imagine seeing those big pretty eyes tears coming out of them she said sir I perceive that you're a prophet but who are you Jesus then the sign on the earth she's tarnished a few hours before that the city would Elias at her she couldn't even come to the well with the rest of women what happened what face of a listen to her if you ever been in the audience they would listen to a woman like that some oriental rug was trying Timmy said the woman wasn't constituted cause the man was a listen listen to her I said what brother you fail to see I don't know you could have been a drunkard you could have been a prostitute you could have been anything that you wanted to be but when you need from me from that time on she had a message that she had missed him aside because she seen the sign of the mesial she know that that was he or she said herself we know when Messiah cometh he'll tell us these things but who are you jesus said I'm he and she got the water pot of the way she went if she just spent on the platform tonight she said I was foul and him oil but I had read in the Bible where he used to be a god prophet when this man told me the fact that just a man but when he told me in my life I knew that that was the sign of the Messiah so a prophet has the potion of the massage spirit so I said sir you must be a prophet we know when Messiah cometh he'll tell us all things jesus said I'm he that speaks to you she note if a man who could do that would say why he was hip was right because back it up who can you get do you go over speaking home when God promised to send the Holy Spirit we saw it word this what we have tonight are the blessing of the Holy Spirit proves that a man's life if he's not impersonating something if he's not trying to act like something trying to act like something that he isn't if he really is God back something work with the person to the woman that was one steal of fame smoke cigarettes drain constitute that woman claims that she met God is still in the same things I doubt forward if a man tells me that he met God I don't bleed there is such a thing as divine healing I doubt his experience called God Kate lie about his own work if the Holy Spirit spoke the word when he comes in it'll say Amen to every word God no man says he don't believe in the baptism Holy Ghost I've doubt him every meetin gone he might be called he might be intellectual he might be a great man he might be an auditor neither lecturer our auditor some sort but he's never met God the Holy Spirit of God in a man who speak a man they ever word God's man he can say I once did not believe in divine healing but one day I met God and from then from that time it changed there's something come into me the transform me and give an experience I've never been able to forget it nothing to meet God without being changed somewhere Oh Judas met God yes one Steve is a man walked around the street but after meeting God into coming up a trailer he become a devil many times we find that you're not for saying but everything it comes into contact with God is changed now listen one day don't pay to get this Oh God one day death come in contact with God death come in contact with God the devil never could hardly believe that that was the Son of God or God made manifest he BB was a man just an ordinary man he couldn't see that God having a son so you never up on the Mount that day when he met him he said if thou be the Son of God command these stones to be made bread if thou be a little bit of doubt let me see you perform a miracle so I could believe you yes a lavinia so he had that hip if you until one day what do you see it defeated thought he was defeated here he was spit all over his face his face bleeding one of jerked handfuls of beard out spit his face put a rag around his head around his eyes took a stick and hit him on top the head it said now if you'd be a prophet tell us who hit you you could discern the thoughts of their heart and you could tell the woman not blood issue is stopped and all these things thought you'd be a prophet tell us who hit you see the devil's agents working there Jesus never opened his mouth he did what the father said to do is never gone and they nailed him up on the cross and he said now if you be the Son of God come down he could have done it but if he listened to the devil he could have done it but all he's rolled up there I'd imagine there was a decision when the devil looked down again and he says if that is life then I'm ruined but if it isn't life I know how to kill even at the cross that's a conference and helm the devil's angel was sent forth the Angel of Death and Jesus is going up Mount Calvary dragging the cross behind him it looked like it was defeated it's so simple catch this many times my van is so simple that it goes all the way over the head of people look like if you just say well I look like we can ever do this or do that don't look at it at all just obey the Holy Spirit no matter what he says you do it jealous God manifested in flesh boy up Towery bleeding blood dragging mouth hanging over them cross dragging out his footprints God the devil said God couldn't do a thing like that oh look at there how could God be manifested in him defeated look at the mockery spit on these things wonder if we as Christians could do that can you go the Second Mile can you turn the cheek the other side that's why the test Christianity see how far you can go and love fellowship Brotherhood that's how you test Christian you say from that time hold I know I was changed when you can do that could that be God could that be God's done going there Jehovah made manifest in flesh going up there with handfuls of beard pulled out his face while no one could stand that mockery spit in his face my agents voting on the head and said now I'll give you a prophet you got some kind of a make up work you you got somebody hope she put on the people now if you'd be a real prophet tell us who hit you will bleed in uh he couldn't be God here he goes on up and when he gets up the on the cross in a lean to the cross and today we'll set our body now after a while a weakness begin to set in from loss of blood what was it the be of deathless buzzing around him fixin to sting that be of death coming around in the sand oh I doubt that how could he be virgin born how could God dwell life that great Jehovah God who has all powers in the heavens and earth let somebody spit his face and take him on like that he couldn't he I was stuck the stinger into him brother he didn't know what he does when he put his finger into that flesh it took you stinger out one of e1 stains deeply it loses its stinger a honeybee insect that's got a stinger when it stains the flesh anchors and pulls the Stinger out and when death met God death lost its standard now death has no stinger it can buzz and make a noise and say I'll take you I'll kill you I'll do this the other but it has no stinger it lost at gathering Calvary no wonder Paul could say when he's coming out to either old Oh death where he is your stinger Oh grave where is your victory but thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ how that from that time death has no standard for the believer Christ took the sting of death out for the believer that's where he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities the chastening with His stripes we were healed from that time Satan was stripped of everything that he had he's nothing but a bluff death is just a block that has no stare I'll help the hands of saints when I'm looking up towards heaven and say oh brother pancakes you see him standing there sure it has no stinger I help my own wife's hand when she looked into the glory she said Billy don't you never fail to preach this wonderful gospel oh it's the most glorious thing she said I'll never desire to stay here any longer 22 years old leading to children I said I'll meet you in the morning by the side of the gate honey I said as long as I live in God's grace helps me I'll sail the field preaching this gospel things from that time I was a change man from that time you can meet
