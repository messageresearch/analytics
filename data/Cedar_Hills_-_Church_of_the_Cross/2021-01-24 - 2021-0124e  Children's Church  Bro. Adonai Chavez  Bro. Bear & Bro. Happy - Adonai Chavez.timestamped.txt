[19:55] as we get ready to introduce the word
[19:58] bring us forth words of life will be our
[20:00] brother adonai as he comes forward to
[20:02] sing that song i shall not be moved
[20:08] [Music]
[20:14] oh i shall not be
[20:17] i shall not be moved
[20:20] oh i shall not be

[21:00] water
[21:06] [Music]
[21:14] shall i shall
[21:18] not be moved just like a tree
[21:21] that's planted by the
[21:26] [Music]
[21:28] not wine moved
[21:56] hello so grateful to be here
[22:00] see all my friends
[22:03] i'm also so grateful that my pastor let
[22:05] me preach this afternoon
[22:08] so let's get started by turning your
[22:09] bibles to luke 3 21 and 22.
[22:21] say man when you have it
[22:35] okay
[22:39] now when all the people were baptized it
[22:41] came to pass that jesus also being
[22:43] baptized
[22:44] and praying the heaven was opened and
[22:47] the
[22:47] holy ghost descended in a bodily shape
[22:50] like a dove
[22:51] upon him and a voice came from heaven
[22:54] which said thou art my beloved son
[22:57] indeed i am well pleased
[22:59] may you please bow your heads
[23:04] lord we want to thank you today for
[23:08] letting us come
[23:09] this afternoon and thank you for
[23:13] letting us be here we're so grateful for
[23:16] you lord
[23:17] may not be me preaching lord but you
[23:21] in jesus name amen
[23:27] you may be seated
[23:33] so luke 3 21-22 says that jesus is
[23:36] getting baptized
[23:38] so god took the form of a dove to show
[23:41] and came down to show everyone that he
[23:44] was pleased with the son
[23:48] now you might be thinking a dove what
[23:51] makes a dove so special
[23:53] that god which is that to come down as
[23:56] is god he could have come down as
[23:58] anything
[23:59] most of us would probably come down as a
[24:02] dinosaur
[24:04] but god isn't like that so you might be
[24:08] thinking
[24:08] what makes a dub so special that god
[24:10] chose to be represented by that animal
[24:12] out of all out of all of his animals he
[24:15] created
[24:17] lucky for you i did my homework
[24:20] brother branham says that the dove not
[24:22] only represents god
[24:24] but a true christian how many of those
[24:27] do we have here
[24:30] good then you'll be able to relate with
[24:32] the dove
[24:35] a dove and a pigeon are in the same
[24:37] family
[24:39] a dove can find its way back home better
[24:42] than any other animal
[24:44] that's why they're used as messenger
[24:46] birds during gores
[24:48] one bird from england was taken all the
[24:51] way to africa
[24:53] and still found its way home it was a 55
[24:56] day journey for the dove
[25:01] now does anybody know what the word meek
[25:03] means
[25:07] no no one humble nice and gentle
[25:13] well the dove is the meekest animal in
[25:16] all the heavens
[25:18] the dove is also the cleanest animal
[25:20] because he has oil inside of him
[25:24] so all the filth just comes right off
[25:27] how many want only one side of them
[25:30] amen that's the holy spirit
[25:34] now we can see in why in heaven a dev
[25:38] represents
[25:39] god on earth it's an eagle but in heaven
[25:42] is the meek dove
[25:45] i'm sure many of us are familiar with
[25:47] the story of noah's ark
[25:51] can anyone tell me how many windows were
[25:53] on ozark one
[25:58] there was one window on the ark kind of
[26:00] pointed straight up to heaven
[26:02] so during the flood they didn't have to
[26:04] worry because all they had to do
[26:06] was look up to god but this made it
[26:09] pretty hard
[26:11] for noah to know when dry land was out
[26:14] so he sends out a bird but he sends out
[26:18] the crow
[26:20] and the crow never comes back because
[26:22] the crow was feeding on dead carcasses
[26:26] and the dead carcasses represent
[26:29] resent resembled the
[26:32] denominations brother branham says that
[26:36] the
[26:36] crow represents a hypocrite because he
[26:39] can just eat
[26:40] dead carcasses all day and then go fly
[26:42] to eat wheat with the dove
[26:46] but the dove resembles a true christian
[26:49] the dove can't
[26:50] stomach all the junk
[26:54] most humans and animals have a
[26:56] gallbladder
[26:57] a gallbladder helps you digest all the
[27:00] junk we put in it
[27:02] in our body but doesn't but dove
[27:05] doesn't have one because it doesn't need
[27:07] one
[27:09] it only thing eats things that are clean
[27:11] and pure
[27:12] like god's word
[27:16] so when noah sons sends out the dove he
[27:19] comes back because there's nowhere to
[27:20] rest his feet
[27:22] so eventually now sends the dove out
[27:25] again
[27:26] this time the dove comes back with an
[27:28] olive branch which represents
[27:30] peace
[27:33] so no one knew they were close to being
[27:35] able to get off the ark
[27:37] after some time noah sends the der
[27:40] the dove out a third time and when the
[27:44] dub didn't come back he knew there was
[27:47] dry land
[27:48] but wait a minute why didn't the duff
[27:51] come back
[27:52] i thought the dove always finds its way
[27:54] home let's find out exactly where the
[27:56] dove went
[27:58] can you please turn our bibles to isaiah
[28:01] chapter 60 verse eight
[28:09] say amen when you have it
[28:18] who are these that fly out the cloud and
[28:20] as the doves to their windows
[28:24] so the third time the dove was done out
[28:26] he never came back because he went to
[28:28] the woods
[28:28] new to a cabin outside its window where
[28:31] brother branham was born
[28:39] and that's my prayer for each one of you
[28:41] that the
[28:42] whole that the heavenly dove would visit
[28:45] each and one of your windows
[28:46] god bless you
[29:34] okay i can do this
[29:37] i can do this
[29:41] oh no i can't do this there's a lot of

[34:11] my my and that's my deepest desire of my
[34:15] heart is to live for jesus
[34:17] and i'm here today all because of love
[34:21] so with that we're going to introduce a
[34:23] very special story
[34:35] there once was a young boy named josiah
[34:38] he was probably like most boys his age
[34:41] except for one small difference
[34:43] josiah was the king of judah he was only
[34:46] eight years old but he was king
[34:49] josiah was a good boy who loved god and
[34:52] wanted to serve him
[34:53] but there were many people in josiah's
[34:55] country who didn't serve god
[34:57] there were people in the land who
[34:58] worshipped false gods and had forgotten
[35:00] how god had cared
[35:02] for the hebrew people they worshiped
[35:04] statues
[35:05] and idols instead of the lord they loved
[35:08] the things of the world instead of the
[35:09] things of god
[35:10] and they had forgotten how to keep god's
[35:12] laws and commandments
[35:14] josiah wanted his kingdom to trust in
[35:16] the lord so things had to change
[35:23] go tell all the high priests to get the
[35:26] money that has been brought into the
[35:27] house of god
[35:28] and use it to hire workers to rebuild
[35:30] the temple of the lord
[35:33] well you heard the man get to work
[35:55] narrator please
[35:59] so the people did as their king
[36:00] commanded and work began on the temple
[36:03] right away
[36:04] then something incredible happened
[36:10] well working on the temple
[36:13] they found the scroll of the law of
[36:15] moses
[36:18] it was god's word that had been missing
[36:20] for hundreds of years
[36:22] they immediately took the scroll to king
[36:24] josiah and read it to him
[36:35] you're not going to believe this
[36:39] what please don't tell me you're
[36:41] painting another selfie of yourself
[36:44] no even better while i was moving all
[36:47] the junk from under the closet
[36:50] i found this ancient scroll
[36:54] you don't think it's the law of moses
[36:59] well let's read it and take a look
[37:15] thou shall have no other gods before me
[37:20] thou shall not make any graven images
[37:39] hello
[37:46] open it come on happy
[37:51] thou shall not bow down thyself to them
[37:54] nor serve them for i the lord thy god
[37:57] am a jealous god visiting the iniquity
[38:00] of the fathers
[38:01] upon the children unto the third and
[38:04] fourth generation
[38:05] of them that hate me yup
[38:08] we're doomed wow
[38:12] you mean that there's people who
[38:15] actually hate god
[38:17] well you see when people choose to
[38:19] disobey god
[38:20] and start worshiping other false gods
[38:23] like money
[38:24] fame music games
[38:27] we prove with our actions that we don't
[38:29] believe god
[38:32] i didn't know that my video games could
[38:34] be a god
[38:36] why sure a god is simply
[38:39] just an object of worship and anything
[38:41] you put before god
[38:42] the one true god is false that is why
[38:45] king josiah has commanded us to rebuild
[38:47] the house of the lord
[38:48] to destroy all the false idols of
[38:51] worship
[38:52] we must get this scroll to king josiah
[38:54] right away he needs to see this
[39:02] king josiah king josiah while we were
[39:05] cleaning out the house of the lord we
[39:07] came across this scroll
[39:09] yes your highness and we're sure it's
[39:12] the law of moses
[39:13] the law of mode this
[39:17] it can be read it read it yes your
[39:20] highness
[39:21] we must read it to you and it says
[39:29] don't worship fake gods respect
[39:32] god's name respect your parents
[39:36] don't kill people don't steal
[39:40] don't lie and don't
[39:44] be jealous
[39:48] i've heard enough go inquire of the lord
[39:51] for me concerning the words that are
[39:52] written yes sir
[39:53] in this scroll for great is the wrath
[39:56] that is poured out upon us
[39:58] because our fathers have not kept god's
[40:00] word
[40:01] go right away sir
[40:18] so the two men did as king josiah
[40:20] instructed
[40:21] they went to jerusalem and found the
[40:23] prophetess holda
[40:25] the two men told her everything that had
[40:26] taken place concerning the law of moses
[40:29] the prophetess told the two men that god
[40:32] was going to bring evil upon jerusalem
[40:34] and because of their disobedience to
[40:36] god's word all the curses written in the
[40:38] law of moses
[40:39] would be poured out and nobody would be
