watch another little one of those video scribes videos that sister viola put together for us and I pray that you that you enjoy it and if we refuse and spit at your face and reaching it a bottle of whiskey or something to take instead and still the touch of the mother's hand or something that's what we do when we turn to other remedies there's many remedies but one cure Christ is the cure and the only cure in this he cares for us He loves us and he wants us to come to him God made us that way that holy thing innocent wants to be comforted God gave man a wife to comfort him the touchy any man knows it's got a good life there's something about a good wife that can a man be upset in his business or areas of walks of life and can come home no matter there's no one no doctor it is that way with me when I come from overseas or somewhere and I'm so nervous and upset and lost of sleeping and you're the crime scene the little hungry children on the street and they're all crying and going on it just kills me that I want to come home if wife will sit down on the arm of the chair put her arm around me and say Oh bill I understand that you know just a few little pets from the wife mean so much same thing your husband too alive that's the way God wanted to be haven't we shut the toots something father you'll get some other woman to try to take that place or some other way you see what you do now why you give us friends he loves we we should be friends we should be brothers and how that it's good to go to a good friend in time of trouble and say oh friend of mine certain certain things has happened and a good trusted friend to sit down and talk with you that's wonderful that's of God just like your wife is of God your husband when your true but it's got so in even man destroys fallen nature he did great that that God give him first thing he took the bottle are the world that gave him comfort instead of the Holy Spirit God give him a wife that these nice companion and he's not satisfied with Lonnie has to get another and another vice versa T the woman to the man young people and so forth even all those comforters that the Lord has given us when it comes down to the end of the journey and we are pressing a pillow against our fevered brow and dying our wife can only spend the tears run down her face with her eyes up towards God our friend can Pat us on the shoulder shake our hands and stand wringing his hands because he can go no farther but then when the comforter as David said yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil dark with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me even some valley of the shadows of death I is it men thirst and hunger because when he was made he was made and created with a little place in him the God dwell to comfort him I want to shucks yourself away from God by sin then that place is vacant and that's why hunger and far-reaching part in the trouble today with us Christians I'm afraid for not doing all we can do to show our fallen brother that that's what's the matter with him that's what's the matter with juvenile delinquency is because there's been a delinquency in the church and a delinquency in the home that's made the juvenile delinquency that's the reasons to beat next and so forth all the streets are jumping up and down and going all these things that because they're trying to find something dissatisfied let me say this tonight is the name of the Lord Jesus there's nothing no status I like the coming of the power of the Holy Ghost that will change your life and your attitudes and give you comfort and eternal there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins when sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains a wife might comfort and pet a friend might stead how to give good advice but there's only one thing that can take away say that that's of God Lord Jesus what can take away my sins nothing but the blood of Jesus what can make me whole again nothing but the blood of Jesus as the writer said all precious is that float that makes me why there's no no other fount I know nothing but the blood of Jesus that's it that cleanses and purifies and brings in a fellowship [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen god bless his word thank God for a prophet a man he has to palana gracias pray would you stand as we

K 1 John 1 they said spent his time Ellis to those who TM proclaiming the gospel orally program and 11 Helio or Almonte but when John understood pero cuando Huntington do I need for his gospel one that had laid on the chest of Jesus is concern the one that was told what is it to you if he tarry till I come okay like okay kita tal estás Takeo Wilma he had to write his gospel in what is now yes from his point of view to Punta at least but he did it for another reason there are Louisa Parata restaurant to fulfill the requirement literally see which other Gospels should be included if was ever Hindu zillion said include oh yes this gate I hope that you get this is this morning oh hell I looked up the in this term and he began to write his gospel and pieces from this your a few reasons what alguna remember the first three they had written their gospels already first of all metal primero they say that John isn't gig one accepted Matthew Mark Luke and John gospel I stepped early Rock Hill you are can Luke's Gospel Matteo Marcos he look and he bore witness is your testimony that those three get so stressed that they were truthful Karen verdaderos and he acknowledged it americano Co the authenticity of those three Gospels love to see Dan they assist area Sara Helios this is not somebody later on that was a smart why scribe or something Noel no K this we know this is somewhere was there then castara and when he read those other Gospels he couldn't ask you mr. Hilley any gospel other than those three that were written during his time kuranes Kratos he refused to acknowledge their authenticity elderly we saw a secondly he Segundo John knew one Sevilla that after those three had written there's get there were other deeds ya know toes touch by Jesus a chose for his son the beginning of his ministry and principio dilemma del ministerio that were not included in know for running in the other threes and los primeros accordingly yeah we're don't things that happen in with John the Baptist before he was cast into prison anti-federal howl alopecia other three what was today talked about after that time means your hundred John the Baptist had gone now means you know this was they they want to see me today one Matthew and Luke provide is the genealogy of Jesus you know like you know here Matthew starts with Abraham might come in second while Luke goes back to Adam he look us regress a stir done John understood one in the deal that he had to show in his writings if they make a most honest with us not just a natural genealogy no no here solo not to that but that Jesus was God who's there are the earth that's why John starts his book on commune says to leave it all and he goes to the genealogy of the world in the beginning el principio was the word the Word was God and the Word was God and the word became flesh he was proving doctor what balls three were true he put the other part atop wouldn't allow that but Jesus had come battle of the logos yes indeed opponent logos went back to the beginning you like the soul principio but a most Randy abstract title deed to another but it started in the mind of documents ornamental is yours forgive me but I could preach on these things but I just I got a I got a dis this is Sunday school hello many kind this this excites me mister know where I'm at anymore no standing on the end oh yeah praise God watch this now you can see this leads to the farther conclusion four Gospels were included que las cuatro a Makino's for daily those boy and we owe their authority the van was loaded on place yeah lugar within the Canon of scriptures Alaska Torah we owe it to st.
