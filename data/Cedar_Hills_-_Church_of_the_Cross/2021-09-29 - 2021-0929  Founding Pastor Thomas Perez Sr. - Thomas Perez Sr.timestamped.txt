[25:20] to the people
[25:23] where we're gonna deal this morning with
[25:25] the tree of life
[25:29] and i would like for you to open your
[25:32] bibles to the book of revelation chapter
[25:34] 2.
[25:40] and verse 7.
[25:43] when you have a say amen
[25:53] i heard about five amen so i guess
[25:56] amen
[25:58] what about ten
[26:01] thirteen
[26:02] there's more than thirty in here
[26:05] i don't think you understand the word
[26:07] that's right it says when you have it
[26:09] say amen
[26:12] it's a paradox
[26:14] you don't seem to believe what comes
[26:15] from behind the pulpit there's no okay
[26:18] when you have it say
[26:23] amen
[26:27] all right
[26:29] maybe you forgot your bibles i'm sorry
[26:35] he didn't have an ear
[26:37] let him hear
[26:39] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[26:44] to him that overcometh
[26:46] will i give to eat of the tree of life
[26:49] which is in the midst of the paradise of
[26:53] god
[27:00] is
[27:06] you may be seated and may the lord add
[27:08] his blessings to the reading of the word
[27:13] we understand that the tree of life
[27:17] is the lord jesus christ
[27:21] if we have any visitors in our midst
[27:30] as you're sitting if you would open your
[27:33] bibles to the third chapter of the book
[27:35] of genesis and verse 22.
[27:40] [Music]
[27:43] i
[27:44] pray as i pray every every time i bring
[28:14] well i guess that's all right
[28:18] but if you really come with a desire
[28:21] to know more about him
[28:27] i'm here this morning because i want
[28:31] [Music]
[28:42] preached it many times but
[28:44] never did i see it
[28:46] the way i saw it last night
[28:51] and it said the lord god
[28:54] said
[28:55] behold the man is become as one of us
[28:59] verse 22 of the third chapter of genesis
[29:07] [Music]
[29:08] notice that it seems to speak to a
[29:11] trinity here
[29:16] to know berlin
[29:21] and now i want you to really get this
[29:24] and if you can just clear your minds
[29:27] your spirits of everything right now and
[29:29] just just
[29:31] if you have it here
[29:34] you
[29:35] hear what the spirit said
[29:37] to the church this morning
[29:43] he put forth his hand
[29:46] and take also
[29:47] of the tree of life
[29:55] [Music]
[29:57] in
[29:58] genesis 1 26
[30:00] henry says
[30:02] he says
[30:04] god said let us make
[30:07] in our image after our likeness
[30:16] it seems like he's speaking
[30:18] again
[30:29] god reveals himself in three offices
[30:34] of pcos
[30:35] three persons of the godhead
[30:40] in genesis 1 26
[30:44] he is talking with his son
[30:48] god the spirit
[30:50] cannot be seen
[30:54] the bible says that the only begotten
[30:58] which was in the bosom of the father had
[31:01] declared him this is
[31:16] let
[31:28] so that was the image that man was going
[31:31] to be made out of
[31:32] essence
[31:35] the spirit father
[31:37] the spirit
[31:39] overshadowed the seed which is the word

[31:57] [Music]
[32:06] [Music]

[32:32] the thing is
[32:34] the holy spirit reveal that to you
[32:37] [Music]
[32:40] when
[32:40] the man received
[32:43] this part of god
[32:45] [Music]
[32:47] the man was
[32:49] that tree of life
[32:53] because the tree
[32:59] [Music]
[33:07] there was no such a thing as death or
[33:11] sickness
[33:12] [Music]
[33:12] [Applause]
[33:14] that's a beautiful thing
[33:17] today
[33:19] the world we live in it's full of
[33:21] sickness and sorrow and death
[33:24] [Music]
[33:27] i went to the rest home yesterday here
[33:29] in silver city we are casable in the
[33:32] silver city i said what a demon
[33:36] field
[33:55] [Music]
[34:01] but healing
[34:02] for christ lived in this manner
[34:15] i know it's hard for a lot of people to
[34:17] try to put this together as far as
[34:20] seeing a man
[34:22] like a tree
[34:27] that's why many people have a hard time
[34:29] understanding serpenty
[34:47] more scripture and show you
[34:49] and all the lord willing how the man is
[34:52] like a tree
[34:56] now
[34:57] disobey god
[35:07] [Music]

[35:49] and now the holy spirit in the heart of
[35:51] the believers to finish the work
[35:55] [Music]
[35:58] in genesis 3 if we can
[36:01] carefully and maybe i can
[36:04] find myself a little bit not to do much
[36:06] preaching but maybe teaching so to help
