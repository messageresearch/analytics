[1:01:25] prisoner and he said there in verse 1
[1:01:29] for this cost I fall the prisoner of
[1:01:33] jesus christ for you gentiles now and i
[1:01:41] have therefore been have enough to
[1:01:43] finish make sure that everybody gets
[1:01:48] weak but you know it's it's quite a word
[1:01:51] of print imprisonment of christ now in
[1:01:55] some of the manners of wall it says Paul
[1:01:58] an apostle of Jesus Christ in other
[1:02:03] letters it says Paul a servant of Jesus
[1:02:07] Christ and but he writes is better to
[1:02:10] Killman he impresses it as Paul a
[1:02:15] prisoner of Christ and when he wrote his
[1:02:21] letter Paul was in jail he was in jail
[1:02:27] and and he could well understand by his
[1:02:31] position what a word man that when he
[1:02:36] was surrounded by margin about how jail
[1:02:39] looks but he could only be free if
[1:02:44] someone made him free or let him freak
[1:02:48] we have incidents in the Bible world may
[1:02:53] have God in most
[1:02:54] men of God have either served in jail at
[1:02:57] one time or the other John the Baptist
[1:03:00] all silent listen Peter and what have
[1:03:04] you and John taking to thee I have a
[1:03:07] pectus and they were all there under
[1:03:11] what we would call today federal prisons
[1:03:14] but here is a man put in jail because of
[1:03:22] what he believed didn't go very well
[1:03:27] with a regular trend on what he did is
[1:03:32] the regular trend there was the Orthodox
[1:03:35] religion and it was the turning of the
[1:03:38] corner of a dispensation but it was very
[1:03:41] hard for them to see it and now the high
[1:03:45] priests day they thought that this group
[1:03:48] of people called Christians were a cult
[1:03:51] so Paul being one of them was very a
[1:03:56] very persecuted man very persecuted by
[1:04:02] religion and federal government under
[1:04:06] Roman rule we understand them but here
[1:04:09] we find Paul in such a such a
[1:04:13] predicament in a man in a prison and he
[1:04:16] saying a prisoner of Christ now I don't
[1:04:19] believe and you know you know why I say
[1:04:24] that that I don't believe that Paul was
[1:04:27] addressing this letter to Philemon about
[1:04:31] his present condition his present
[1:04:34] condition was that he was in jail he
[1:04:36] wasn't referring to that but I believe
[1:04:40] he was referring to his deal his spirit
[1:04:45] his will being a prisoner to the Lord
[1:04:49] Jesus Christ and let me just
[1:04:53] before I get started a man who would not
[1:04:54] like to be a prisoner Jesus Christ don't
[1:04:59] be so hasty in raising your hands it's
[1:05:02] not easy to be a prisoner to be behind
[1:05:05] bars but like I said I do not believe
[1:05:09] that here what you say
[1:05:11] a prisoner of Jesus Christ he's
[1:05:13] referring to his physical being but he's
[1:05:16] referring to his will first of all to
[1:05:20] get started we understand that as men
[1:05:25] and women we are under free moral agency
[1:05:28] and it has to be that way for you to
[1:05:32] choose whether you want to serve or you
[1:05:35] don't want to serve whether you want to
[1:05:38] follow that you want for life and it has
[1:05:41] to be upon the same basis that he placed
[1:05:45] underneath and if it isn't on those
[1:05:48] basis well then God isn't just but God
[1:05:54] being just he pleases you and I under a
[1:05:59] free free fall agency and I wonder all
[1:06:01] that work because later this passage of
[1:06:05] Scripture my confuse you a little bit it
[1:06:08] confuses in Damphousse theologians such
[1:06:12] as such as to prepare agency well in
[1:06:15] primo veggie you have a choice but we'll
[1:06:19] find out later what choice Paul had when
[1:06:23] he became a prison a man it gets quite
[1:06:27] tremendous that when you when you read
[1:06:29] this now right and wrong is set before
[1:06:32] us just like I said
[1:06:34] Eponine and the whole human race was
[1:06:41] under what we call the penalty of death
[1:06:43] we we were we were condemned to die
[1:06:48] no way out but God came down in the form
[1:06:54] of a man to take away that sting of
[1:06:58] death and place under free moral agency
[1:07:03] he placed on a promoted agency for you
[1:07:07] and I to make a decision now decision is
[1:07:14] decisions are hard to make we we we
[1:07:18] stand like in the valley of decisions
[1:07:20] and man we get up in the morning we have
[1:07:23] to decide whether we're gonna put on our
[1:07:25] side so or not that's why you see a lot
[1:07:27] of people with don't wear socks then
[1:07:29] what blue one hey you gotta decide
[1:07:34] whether you're gonna wash your face and
[1:07:35] comb your hair while you're find out
[1:07:37] people never comb their hair they
[1:07:39] decided to color here then you're going
[1:07:42] to side whether you believe breakfast or
[1:07:43] you're not they every minute that passes
[1:07:48] by there are decision to be made it's
[1:07:53] time to church we have to decide whether
[1:07:56] we want to go to church or we don't want
[1:07:58] to go to church right you have you have
[1:08:02] a right to choose yes
[1:08:03] you don't have to come to church people
[1:08:06] say to the church you don't have to go
[1:08:09] to church your femoral agent you can
[1:08:11] stay home and watch I Love Lucy
[1:08:15] but we choose to be here we we are I
[1:08:20] believe we're all here because we want
[1:08:22] it to be here let's have it retrieve all
[1:08:25] agency and you choose to serve God you
[1:08:30] choose to survive you know the church
[1:08:33] promos no matter what church they will
[1:08:35] do that anyone that is called Christian
[1:08:38] knows that Jesus Christ died on the
[1:08:41] cross that rider is that moment anyone
[1:08:46] that is called a Christian or the Jesus
[1:08:48] Christ died on the cross now they have
[1:08:50] to decide if they're going to follow him
[1:08:54] they have to decide what church they're
[1:08:57] gonna go to they have to make a decision
[1:09:00] but they're going to believe a man and
[1:09:04] have to decide it's a decision and
[1:09:07] nobody could make for you you gotta make
[1:09:10] it by yourself you can bring your
[1:09:12] children to church but when they grow
[1:09:15] old or get over the way they want to and
[1:09:18] usually they are depending on your
[1:09:20] church they're going to go out in the
[1:09:22] world no matter how much you bring in
[1:09:24] the church
[1:09:24] you gotta get that new birth
[1:09:26] man but we find out that each one of us
[1:09:30] must choose we must choose death or life
[1:09:38] do that
[1:09:40] life or death in our lives our lives are
[1:09:45] just a shadow and you know what brings a
[1:09:50] shadow is a certain degree of darkness
[1:09:53] and a certain degree of life man ever
[1:09:56] creates a shell so we walk in the valley
[1:09:59] of the shadow of death but the real life
[1:10:04] we see which is called plasma life this
[1:10:09] discuss per week we we have access to
[1:10:11] the Cosmo life but but then there's
[1:10:15] another life which is godlike that is
[1:10:17] not that's not possible that slowly and
[1:10:20] we've heard that over and over now when
[1:10:23] they light is present darkness flees
[1:10:26] that there's no there's no darkness they
[1:10:29] can stand there there's no darkness to
[1:10:32] stand there with it in Cosmo
[1:10:34] you can bring a shadow they create the
[1:10:37] shell two different things and a certain
[1:10:40] degree of darkness with light create the
[1:10:43] shell but you can be sound asleep and
[1:10:47] you can wake up in the middle of the
[1:10:49] night and if you happen to see the light
[1:10:51] got to see Zoe it it has no boundaries
[1:10:56] as far as darkness it makes darkness go
[1:11:00] away and that's something great have you
[1:11:02] ever seen a light I have many people
[1:11:07] have some never seen like but I think
[1:11:11] I've seen a light and the greatest I've
[1:11:15] seen is a violinist struck my heart now
[1:11:19] your life my life your life will prove
[1:11:23] what side you're on the side
[1:11:28] now listen I I make this statement is to
[1:11:32] maybe improve a little bit of the
[1:11:35] condition of the Apostle Paul now Paul
[1:11:41] as far as being a Christian he was not
[1:11:45] Christian
[1:11:46] Paul was a Jew but had come into
[1:11:52] Christianity he had seen this thing
[1:11:56] about Christianity yet Paul believed
[1:11:59] there was a god he he he serve God in
[1:12:02] way understand catch all this he served
[1:12:08] God his way he was a very trained man he
[1:12:13] was a scholar but the life that he had
[1:12:19] prove what side he was on Paul had never
[1:12:25] come in contact with light
[1:12:29] Paul had gone to to school from the age
[1:12:34] of eight years old to the age of 35 he
[1:12:38] had studied under great man like
[1:12:42] Dominion to the great man he was a
[1:12:46] god-fearing man but he had sees the
[1:12:49] light he didn't know anything about
[1:12:52] Jesus or he knew there was a sec called
[1:12:56] Christians that follow a man that was
[1:13:01] here on earth called Jesus that's all he
[1:13:04] knew so right that is that he had showed
[1:13:08] what side he was on he was on the side
[1:13:12] the way
[1:13:12] the same acronym that was Paul on the
[1:13:16] boat most of the New Testament the
[1:13:19] letters but in in seeing this
[1:13:28] you think I'm staring up there's a
[1:13:30] reason for it we certainly a little bit
[1:13:33] here but in studying this life of Paul
[1:13:37] and how he was a prisoner is something
[1:13:43] to behold as Christians we we sometimes
[1:13:52] judge our lives by how much power we
[1:13:58] seem to possess or but how many miracles
[1:14:01] can be dire ministry or by how much
[1:14:07] knowledge we have the world so if you
[1:14:12] find you you find he moved you
[1:14:15] throughout the country the vital
[1:14:17] bookstores are full books on
[1:14:20] commentaries by different men in the new
[1:14:24] boy of how they think things should be
[1:14:29] run they have their school they have her
[1:14:35] thought Heather idea they have their
[1:14:37] theology on how things should be run
[1:14:41] everybody gives you their opinion on how
[1:14:44] things should be learned what was
[1:14:47] straight under that on how things should
[1:14:49] be Ron Paul was a very ambitious man
[1:14:55] aside from being very smart and
[1:14:58] intelligent person trained under
[1:15:01] Gamaliel Paul was Amanda had a vision
[1:15:05] and one of the ambitions that he
[1:15:08] was to suddenly be a priest and someday
[1:15:11] maybe be the high priest that was his
[1:15:14] ambition so forehead paper with the
[1:15:18] Sanhedrin he found favor with the clergy
[1:15:21] of his day but his wife proved what side
[1:15:25] he was on and at that age when he had
[1:15:31] Saladin he was under this clergy he was
[1:15:36] a very old trusted man that's the reason
[1:15:40] that they gave Paul the power and
[1:15:43] documents to go to Damascus and
[1:15:47] originally the Bible how he went to the
[1:15:50] bestest any went to Damascus he went
[1:15:54] because he was given authority to bind
[1:15:57] to bring back to Jerusalem these new
[1:16:03] groups called Christians bring back
[1:16:06] so Paul went to Damascus and he was also
[1:16:12] given the authority to kill anyone that
[1:16:16] resisted him here for a deal so Paul he
[1:16:22] thought he was doing God a service he
[1:16:26] was trained he believed in God he chose
[1:16:29] to follow God but there's one thing the
[1:16:34] Pope had never encountered he had never
[1:16:36] encountered that Hellfire he knew
[1:16:40] nothing about Christianity he regards as
[1:16:44] far as the Hebrew long time as far as
[1:16:49] the Hebrew he said I am a Hebrew of
[1:16:51] Hebron and for a tribe of Benjamin
[1:16:55] circumcised the eighth day he you is a
[1:17:00] serviceman but the time came when Paul
[1:17:04] going and thinking he was doing a
[1:17:06] service he takes get on it on his horse
[1:17:10] and he goes with his man and he goes
[1:17:12] toward a master's
[1:17:13] but he took to his surprise sounds fun
[1:17:33] why persecutest thou me and he said Lord
[1:17:38] for thou is Ryan Jesus ah but na
[1:17:44] persecute you know what Jesus did you
[1:17:51] wanna be freezing children it what Jesus
[1:17:53] did to him
[1:17:54] it was needed yes it was Ida
[1:17:59] Jesus with her colleagues Isaac and that
[1:18:04] Paul or so he said you are to go to a
[1:18:11] street called straight I have a stranger
[1:18:14] than
[1:18:16] you've got proper comment of Dragon Ball
[1:18:22] but he was there how the Holy Spirit
[1:18:25] came upon him and I had the Prophet he
[1:18:28] came and anointed him and we find it as
[1:18:32] he had anointed Paul that polls are
[1:18:37] polls eyes were open to something that
[1:18:41] he had never seen before he to a degree
[1:18:48] to a certain degree you could touch him
[1:18:52] concerning the mall you you look at it
[1:18:56] once it reaches possible to the roman
[1:18:59] the corinthians thessalonians april and
[1:19:02] i said he because there's some tailors
[1:19:04] and don't think that you're on the book
[1:19:05] of peoples but I believe he will
[1:19:06] consider evil and so he wrote letters
[1:19:10] most of them dictated by man well he
[1:19:13] would dictate it they would write for
[1:19:14] him but he would write these letters and
[1:19:18] for how he expounded the that Hebrew
[1:19:24] Lord he he said zealous concerning the
[1:19:28] law he said no one was more sellers than
[1:19:31] I was support a tremendous tremendous
[1:19:35] man and I find an interesting thing here
[1:19:41] it there are and I could have tribute to
[1:19:44] my right as far as religion with we're
[1:19:47] all born with religion one form or the
[1:19:50] other we all come from different
[1:19:53] backgrounds whether Catholic
[1:19:55] Presbyterian braxton whatever and we
[1:19:58] come in we know what father's taught us
[1:20:03] we we we love God because we we with
[1:20:06] running the reason God and we learn to
[1:20:09] love him to a certain degree but as far
[1:20:12] as really being every
[1:20:15] a lot of people haven't been apprehended
[1:20:18] by this thing so they remain religious
[1:20:21] the ball was every handed and when he if
[1:20:26] I were open I believe it that Paul
[1:20:30] attended a lot of the services of man
[1:20:33] called Peter and he would sit there and
[1:20:36] hear him and he said this is tremendous
[1:20:39] the way he places this what you may
[1:20:43] never place them like this the middle of
[1:20:46] this because this was the start of
[1:20:50] Christianity yes and the Oh Lord are the
[1:20:53] thoughts and ways the religion the
[1:20:57] shortest if it pointed is a time to a
[1:21:01] deliverer from the deliverer came he
[1:21:04] knew him in with never safety just a
[1:21:09] handful Bible save about a honey but
[1:21:12] they began to grow they began to grow up
[1:21:15] that word frightened the Jewish people
[1:21:18] the same Helena the priests and
[1:21:20] everything that they had to put a stop
[1:21:23] to all this but here we find Paul he
[1:21:27] said this is tremendous
[1:21:29] the one important take in the morning
[1:21:31] this is me I got fired from myself all
[1:21:35] these things why why he intercepted why
[1:21:43] God did not permit me to fulfill my
[1:21:48] ambition
[1:21:50] you know why initiatives it makes a
[1:21:54] designer to have an owner or power or
[1:21:59] such as any career it's a life as from
[1:22:05] Webster's and in there he went to the
[1:22:09] desert with Libby went to the desert of
[1:22:12] Iranian and he studied for three and a
[1:22:14] half years and one day he said I counted
[1:22:18] to the patience and the revelations of
[1:22:21] the Lord Jesus Christ and how the Lord
[1:22:26] comes to him in such a way that the
[1:22:32] ambition that was in here and let's face
[1:22:35] it we all have a mission to do things
[1:22:38] vision something given I wonder why
[1:22:47] we're here
[1:22:49] I'm Cristiano I'm supposed to go to
[1:22:52] church and water bench for adventures a
[1:22:56] man can say man the truth no ambition
[1:23:03] but this man had wishes that's why he
[1:23:06] went to Damascus but each change fall or
[1:23:15] south which is name was given them from
[1:23:20] Saul the Lord says I'll show you how
[1:23:26] much you have to suffer you will suffer
[1:23:33] for my name's see I tell people it's
[1:23:39] easy go to church
[1:23:43] it's easy to pick x TZ here often it's
[1:23:50] hard when you come across this line and
[1:23:56] something more is demanded of you have
[1:24:01] you here young people especially
[1:24:04] especially well I'm gonna go to school
[1:24:07] I'm gonna be a teacher
[1:24:09] Ammar being a musician be a great
[1:24:15] salesman I'm gonna leave this or that
[1:24:18] well that their ambition that water of
[1:24:23] Nations try to do in our ambitions my my
[1:24:29] other ambitions that was things I wanted
[1:24:33] to do you know there are many many times
[1:24:37] to be a pastor is not easy there was
[1:24:41] many many times you you feel like going
[1:24:43] away from it you feel you feel like
[1:24:47] getting away from it all because it's
[1:24:52] hard very hard to minister and not just
[1:24:56] minister but mainly to be a pasture and
[1:25:00] their pasture almost 27 years and in
[1:25:04] ain't getting no easier but there's one
[1:25:07] thing experience and with Lord
[1:25:11] it helps us along the way to be able to
[1:25:14] cope with the situation
[1:25:17] so it's not easy so then would it be
[1:25:21] easy for a man like me just to forget
[1:25:25] about it and go get my partner doomed
[1:25:27] working hours like you know and go home
[1:25:29] and take it easy it would be easy 30
[1:25:34] people work eight hours and they go oh
[1:25:36] I'm so tired trying to hit it it for 24
[1:25:40] - I'm tired of the law where you can
[1:25:43] sleep from the whole burden of the
[1:25:46] church and people is upon it it gets
[1:25:49] hard but how can a man do that it is the
[1:25:53] question how can a man do that except he
[1:25:57] be a prisoner and here is for everything
[1:26:03] to see this portion of Scripture but
[1:26:06] then I look at it and I see Paul being a
[1:26:12] prisoner he's not talking about me
[1:26:13] enough in a little jail which he was but
[1:26:17] he is not speaking about that he was a
[1:26:19] prisoner to his will he had read oh he
[1:26:24] had a mission he had in him something
[1:26:28] that he wanted to excel he wanted to be
[1:26:30] a priest and maybe a high priest when
[1:26:34] Jesus comes across you understand me
[1:26:37] Jesus comes and the mind comes if your
[1:26:42] question was here triple agent when
[1:26:45] Jesus called take apart before you
[1:26:50] answer was here meanwhile agent could he
[1:26:54] choose no God that he had chosen to
[1:27:00] serve God and point number one and
[1:27:04] number two is
[1:27:07] Paul even though he was he doesn't know
[1:27:11] how to turn him over Philippians 4 which
[1:27:24] I have been apprehended or arrested it
[1:27:28] wasn't free moral agency no more he was
[1:27:32] God showing mercy to America Paul his
[1:27:37] mercy he places a yoke on him and fires
[1:27:42] and he was chained were ball could not
[1:27:48] order to his will but he was God let
[1:27:56] fall he let him with a harness and
[1:28:02] pulled him so that he could go to the
[1:28:07] Gentiles do you think the Jews or
[1:28:15] Gentiles he should have never even think
[1:28:19] that that's that's a filthy common
[1:28:24] nothing of this I'm never in these
[1:28:27] things the $1 jelly
[1:28:30] but guys Cleveland when country and Jude
[1:28:34] Jude tips of the a Gentile they're
[1:28:37] called dogs here Peter had to be given a
[1:28:42] vision and never say vision was given
[1:28:45] give it to the Tanner it was the same
[1:28:48] thing that Peter understood that God had
[1:28:53] open the way for the Gentile but the jet
[1:28:55] dog still was back without knowledge of
[1:28:59] the Lord Jesus Christ so God had to
[1:29:03] arrest every but you know how deserving
[1:29:13] people annotator one thing you need men
[1:29:16] seeking for God never does the men seek
[1:29:20] for God he's got seeking men as far as
[1:29:27] to lead to our church and serving God
[1:29:30] Sherman under that free moral agency
[1:29:33] does that but when you're apprehended by
[1:29:36] the Lord Jesus Christ where you're
[1:29:38] digging from your comfort zone you have
[1:29:41] a comfort zone from this comfort zone
[1:29:45] because it's easy to go in the trend and
[1:29:48] made a comfort zone but when God ruffles
[1:29:51] those feathers of a nest makes you move
[1:29:54] and why do you do it because he's got
[1:29:57] chains on you chains of love you so much
[1:30:05] but things get hard church but please
[1:30:09] get out bearable in the church when you
[1:30:12] see man and woman pretend to be
[1:30:14] Christians and the light they leave him
[1:30:16] whatever and he gets so hot sure you
[1:30:21] feel like running away but a true
[1:30:23] Shepherd won't run behind will run but
[1:30:28] what makes you spend because it has so
[1:30:31] much knowledge no sir because you are
[1:30:41] upon you and he said my yoke is easy and
[1:30:44] my burden is light
[1:30:48] sometimes I wonder sometimes in a light
[1:30:53] side all the word is right so I have to
[1:30:57] go back and put this carnal man to the
[1:31:00] side and say it's not your son it's
[1:31:04] Jesus notice another point there was
[1:31:11] Paul persecuting Jesus
[1:31:16] [Music]
[1:31:18] I say literally a minute was Jesus
[1:31:21] Christ in corporate form then who was
[1:31:27] Oprah City they was persecuted in church
[1:31:32] the volunteers in Jesus said that's
[1:31:36] enough
[1:31:37] don't you touch em that's enough you're
[1:31:43] not supposed to persecute these my name
[1:31:47] is English you're persecuting me Paul
[1:31:53] when you touch these people it is I it
[1:31:59] is I nobody else and when we see see
[1:32:05] that and we see the road and the
[1:32:08] troubles that we have on the road and
[1:32:12] everything else with always come to thee
[1:32:17] Jesus and how many of you would love to
[1:32:21] just have those chains and love place
[1:32:25] the point but here's what's going to
[1:32:28] happen it was what I happen you got a
[1:32:32] call for in one go dear me you've gotta
[1:32:37] go or you don't want to go ha
[1:32:40] you've gotta do something but you don't
[1:32:43] want you gotta say things sometimes that
[1:32:48] you don't wanna say hey when the people
[1:32:52] throw at you it's not you today it's
[1:32:57] Jesus it hasn't changed centralism
[1:33:02] he hates the same man a man
[1:33:06] what what a tremendous thing that that
[1:33:10] he just addresses the earth for a prison
[1:33:17] price I am an prisoner a prisoner that
[1:33:24] is bound in chains of love he loved
[1:33:30] Jesus so much when he got a revelation
[1:33:33] of what it was that his chains did me
[1:33:39] why did God change what if God took his
[1:33:46] chains away from you
[1:33:48] do you think that you would go back to
[1:33:51] your evolution for the elevation
[1:33:55] so it becomes madam or the decisions
[1:34:00] comment message just a little boy what
[1:34:05] would it be tremendous to know that he
[1:34:12] loves us how do how do you find against
[1:34:20] me would you send your feet did we find
[1:34:27] how much do we do go to a certain place
