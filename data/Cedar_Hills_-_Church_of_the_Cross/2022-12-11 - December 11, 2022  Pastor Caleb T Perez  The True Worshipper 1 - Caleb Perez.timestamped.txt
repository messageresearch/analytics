[38:59] that's uh
[39:02] yeah and then brother
[39:04] is uh
[39:06] is our brother
[39:09] is our brother and our friend from
[39:11] Barrientos
[39:14] and so we've been talking about this for

[39:22] so God bless you
[39:26] good to have you here amen
[39:31] amen we we uh
[39:33] we want to give a little testimony to
[39:36] you
[39:37] and that is uh
[39:40] when we were when we had gone a couple
[39:42] of weeks weeks back to about three weeks
[39:44] ago
[39:46] we were in Denver
[39:48] and uh we were actually planning to go
[39:52] to to Denver the week before we actually
[39:54] went
[39:56] and when we got there actually that the
[40:00] the we we uh the brother uh ended up
[40:04] telling to me he
[40:09] um
[40:10] he was actually uh
[40:13] he's trying to be be a this uh quiet
[40:16] about it
[40:18] finally he says well brother my my
[40:21] wife's in the hospital
[40:24] he was pregnant
[40:26] and
[40:28] she she was uh she was at the point of
[40:31] death
[40:33] and and still through it all he kept uh
[40:38] he kept him he could have canceled the
[40:40] services
[40:42] but we went ahead and went
[40:45] and the Lord had given brother Diego a
[40:48] vision
[40:51] crocodiles we know we know that means it
[40:55] means death for sure those crocodiles
[41:00] but we went in the name of the Lord
[41:04] they took the baby out by a C-section
[41:10] and they ended up she ended up pointing
[41:13] to a coma
[41:14] uh as we were there we we
[41:18] stood together and we made a prayer as a
[41:21] body
[41:23] and uh I'm here to tell you she came out
[41:27] of her coma
[41:29] out of the hospital
[41:32] and uh
[41:35] and her and the baby are doing just fine
[41:39] so we are grateful to God for that
[41:43] he told me later on he says I I saw
[41:46] those same two crocodiles
[41:49] but the arrow of God's Deliverance
[41:54] say it again the arrow of God's
[41:57] Deliverance
[41:59] that's what we are grateful to God
[42:01] foreign
[42:04] I'm going to try to be better
[42:18] well you know just let's let's try to
[42:21] tone it down a little bit and and uh
[42:23] let's try to stay within an hour
[42:27] you can be so kind and
[42:29] and stand to your feet
[42:31] as we uh read our scripture
[42:36] and this is the first message on the
[42:39] true worshiper it says
[42:41] [Music]
[42:45] some thoughts concerning this
[42:49] I had preached some years back on the
[42:51] worshiper
[42:55] to talk on a few uh maybe a few messages
[42:58] concerning this yeah
[43:01] and as the Lord was putting uh it was
[43:04] giving me the inspiration
[43:06] you know he says I will share my throne
[43:11] my glory
[43:15] you tell me Gloria
[43:18] I must tell you again he said tell the
[43:21] church that I will share my glory
[43:26] at this point
[43:28] we either all in right
[43:32] and so we we want to make sure we are
[43:36] where we need to be
[43:39] very well known scripture John chapter 4
[43:42] and verse 23 San Juan capitulo
[43:52] such a an attack
[43:54] from the enemy is
[43:57] my goodness he he don't let up but we're
[44:00] not letting up either
[44:03] we know this scripture he's talking to
[44:06] the uh the woman at the well amen
[44:10] and it says this but the hour cometh and
[44:13] now is
[44:15] when the true worshipers
[44:17] shall worship the father in spirit and
[44:20] in truth
[44:21] for the father seeketh such to worship
[44:25] is
[44:38] I like that very much right there where
[44:41] it says
[44:42] the father
[44:44] seeketha
[44:46] continually looking for
[44:49] such a worshiper my goodness I want to
[44:53] ask the question are you one of those
[44:55] worshipers
[44:58] the churches are full this morning of
[45:00] worshipers
[45:02] they're worshiping the best that they
[45:04] know how right
[45:08] amidst it all there is a true worshiper
[45:12] that's what we are after that's what we
[45:15] want to be yes okay oh may God add His
[45:18] blessings to the reading of this word
[45:20] you may be seated
[45:31] we see this in the scripture
[45:34] and I I I really enjoyed the the panel
[45:38] on Wednesday
[45:41] and brother Abraham you know he's
[45:45] of course like we say we always say we
[45:47] run out of time
[45:49] but there was something that he read
[45:53] and I probably won't get a lot into that
[45:55] during this message
[45:58] but there was something that he read
[46:00] towards the end that really it really
[46:02] got my attention from what I was
[46:04] studying
[46:07] and that was as he was reading
[46:10] Revelations 11. everyone remember that
[46:13] Revelation and Revelations 11 1 says and
[46:16] there was given me a read
[46:19] like unto a rod yeah
[46:25] and the angels stood saying rise and
[46:28] measure the temple of God and the altar
[46:32] and them that worship therein is
[46:39] so so it got my attention is as to the
[46:43] the part that I'm dealing with
[46:48] measuring the worshiper
[46:51] now now there's a lot that goes with
[46:54] this
[46:54] that as we were talking about it I
[46:57] believe on on Thursday
[47:01] there's so much that that this that's
[47:04] that this deals with
[47:06] and so we will maybe in the next message
[47:09] we'll we'll get to that
[47:13] you remember he said
[47:16] what do they need a measuring tape
[47:21] what do they do they bring your
[47:23] measuring tape and they measure it like
[47:25] this
[47:26] how do you measure a worshiper
[47:30] good question we can get into the other
[47:33] things but but we we want to focus on
[47:35] the worshiper this morning
[47:38] and there is much that goes with this
[47:41] because though when there is a wedding
[47:46] they're uh bridesmaids are measured for
[47:50] their dresses
[47:53] and groomsmen are measured
[47:57] and attendees are measured
[48:02] we have a a special treat this coming
[48:06] weekend
[48:09] and we have a couple that has been
[48:12] married for 60 years
[48:16] Centennial stats
[48:18] brother Ross and sister Ruth Mr Manor
[48:21] Russell and what an example is that
[48:24] right
[48:25] and so we're we're all invited right
[48:28] we're all invited if not I'm gonna have
[48:31] to put up for
[48:33] you I'll pay for the food
[48:36] this Saturday I think it's at three
[48:39] o'clock and so they're inviting all of
[48:42] you to come and and and and join in
[48:46] and so you know that they're they're
[48:48] they're they're being measured for for
[48:49] whatever dress they're gonna wear or
[48:51] suit and so forth
[48:55] and those so many go to church
[48:58] but only the bride who gets measured for
[49:01] the for the wedding which is
[49:05] nobody else gets measured for the
[49:07] wedding dress
[49:09] and so we we everyone's waiting for the
[49:12] moment when the bride walks out
[49:16] hoping maybe that they that they
[49:19] measured correctly the bride is is
[49:21] nervous
[49:24] she gets measured for her dress
[49:28] now now the the in the natural the dress
[49:33] you know they they measure it so that it
[49:35] it they custom make it to fit her
[49:40] but in the spiritual spiritual we must
[49:44] grow up into this dress
[49:49] we've got to grow up into it
[49:52] now now when we get to a certain place
[49:56] we understand and see see that that it's
[50:00] a tremendous Day that's coming and
[50:03] so we we want everything to be just
[50:05] right
[50:07] anyone that everyone that's got married
[50:09] before you want everything to be just
[50:11] perfect
[50:15] when the day finally arrives
[50:19] there's no time anymore to to to to get
[50:22] the dress ready
[50:25] it either fits or it doesn't
[50:28] and so it's it's it's uh we see this and
[50:32] it wow it it uh it makes it so real to
[50:36] us
[50:37] that's why the scripture says
[50:40] these measure the worshiper
[50:44] what a thing it is and sometimes we
[50:47] don't like to be measured
[50:49] I went the other day to get a suit
[50:55] the man says I think you're a 44.
[51:00] no I don't think so no no no
[51:04] I think I'm a 43.
[51:09] so
[51:11] John hello
[51:14] 43 was just a little tight
[51:17] and I was like oh uh
[51:21] just measure me at a 43. I'm gonna lose
[51:23] some weight anyways
[51:26] and the man says everybody that comes in
[51:30] says
[51:34] after what well I guess I just just
[51:36] measure me for what I am and I guess if
[51:39] I ever lose weight I can try to adjust
[51:40] it
[51:43] but I wonder this morning how many of us
[51:46] can measure up to the world
[51:50] not just measure up as a churchgoer
[51:55] some religious person
[51:58] got to make sure we measure up to the
[52:00] word
[52:02] she have made herself ready the Bible
[52:05] says
[52:07] and the way that she has made herself
[52:09] ready is by worshiping in spirit and in
[52:13] truth
[52:15] by himself sometimes the question
[52:20] how important is it really to Worship in
[52:24] spirit and Truth
[52:27] we've got to know how to dress ourselves
[52:30] with the word
[52:32] and it takes me to Genesis chapter
[52:35] chapter 2 and verse 15 if you can turn
[52:37] to that
[52:39] and I pray that this this God helps us
[52:43] I've kind of been under under something
[52:46] the last couple of days and
[52:48] this building
[52:50] we are at our post of Duty this morning
[52:54] and so we we want to just see just a
[52:58] little bit what God has for us
[53:00] and the Lord God took the man
[53:03] and put him into the Garden of Eden to
[53:06] dress it and to keep it
[53:10] I want you to notice
[53:13] there was two things that he was asked
[53:15] to do
[53:19] and to keep it everybody got that can
[53:22] you repeat with me you dress it
[53:25] and to keep it
[53:27] you can put up those definitions up here
[53:29] and like I said just we'll we'll put
[53:32] today just a foundation to to this
[53:34] subject
[53:36] but the word dress there is in the
[53:39] Hebrew is
[53:42] it means to work
[53:45] to serve
[53:47] to worship yeah
[53:51] and the Lord God took the man
[53:53] put him into the Garden of Eden
[53:56] first of all to dress it
[54:00] yes he was there to serve to work
[54:04] but also to Worship in this garden
[54:09] now now notice this now
[54:12] his work
[54:16] and his worship is
[54:19] all connected together
[54:23] this is very important to understand
[54:25] this once again his work his service and
[54:31] his worship
[54:32] they're all connected together
[54:36] under one word in the Hebrew called
[54:42] then it was also to keep it
[54:46] and the word keep means to guard is
[54:51] to
[54:56] preserve a preservar to be a Watchman
[55:00] so as we see this picture beginning to
[55:04] form
[55:06] everything that man did in the garden
[55:09] was part of his worship
[55:13] and his responsibility was to keep
[55:16] responsibility to guard
[55:19] and protect that worship at all costs
[55:24] you get that with me it's important that
[55:28] we understand this
[55:29] once again it was his responsibility
[55:36] and protect his worship at all costs
[55:41] in the Garden of Eden there was a
[55:45] perfect economy
[55:47] there was a perfect harmony
[55:52] because there was a perfect worship
[55:54] there
[55:56] they were true worshipers
[56:00] and in the cool of the evening
[56:03] father would come down and they would
[56:07] finish their worship
[56:10] under the fire
[56:12] under the great logos
[56:16] you cannot have true worship unless
[56:19] you're under the true fires
[56:22] if you're not under the true fire then
[56:25] you only have a form of godliness
[56:29] and you cannot have perfect worship
[56:34] prophet of God says in the message sir
[56:37] we would see Jesus
[56:40] he said let's stay under the fires
[56:45] worship right here under the fire
[56:49] let's Worship in the power and the
[56:52] spirit
[56:53] believe in that God's word yes it is
[56:59] but after the fall
[57:01] the true worship was lost
[57:05] the ground was then cursed for man's
[57:08] sake
[57:10] and he would have to work and eat by the
[57:13] sweat of his brow with his face
[57:17] but God was still going to be worshiped
[57:22] the Bible says that by faith Abel
[57:25] offered unto God a more excellent
[57:27] sacrifice
[57:30] and without faith it is impossible to
[57:33] please God
[57:35] impossible to gratify him entirely
[57:38] impossible gratification and only
[57:41] through true worship is God completely
[57:44] and entirely gratified
[57:49] and here's the best part of it all yeah
[57:54] that anyone or anything that stands in
[57:58] the way of our worship is
[58:08] I I
[58:09] believe that the Lord wants us he wants
[58:12] us to go through this slowly
[58:17] that this is
[58:24] can you can you tell your neighbor he
[58:27] will share his glory
[58:31] it's important that we understand this
[58:34] is
[58:35] things that we've heard for years and
[58:38] years
[58:39] but now I tell you church we must know
[58:43] this with everything that is in us we
[58:46] must make sure that we're aware of this
[58:52] Exodus 8 1 says
[58:57] and the Lord spake unto Moses
[59:01] going to feral
[59:03] and say unto him
[59:05] thus saith the Lord let my people go
[59:12] and this is
[59:23] the same word that we just read in in
[59:26] the Book of Genesis
[59:33] it's the same word that's used here to
[59:36] serve
[59:38] let my people go that they may serve me
[59:42] the word serve there is a bottle so in
[59:45] the Hebrew
[59:46] and once again to serve to work to
[59:50] worship
[59:52] now once again it's all combined
[59:55] together
[59:57] and if thou refuse to let them go is
[1:00:03] behold I will Smite all thy borders with
[1:00:07] frogs
[1:00:10] here it is showing that Satan is
[1:00:13] powerless against the true worshiper
[1:00:17] God that has let my people go so they
[1:00:21] can worship me
[1:00:26] because he desires the worship and
[1:00:29] Praises of his children
[1:00:34] but it also implies
[1:00:37] that they had to be released as slaves
[1:00:40] first
[1:00:43] in order to be free to worship
[1:00:47] they were slaves in Egypt when he said
[1:00:50] let them go
[1:00:52] in other words they had to be released
[1:00:55] as slaves
[1:00:56] in order to be free to serve him
[1:01:00] you can't serve God and still be a slave
[1:01:03] no pues
[1:01:06] you can't do the both of them you can't
[1:01:10] be a slave to sin and then try to serve
[1:01:12] God and worship him
[1:01:14] no I will share my glory with no one no
[1:01:18] compartment
[1:01:19] watch how and why he's telling us this
[1:01:22] is
[1:01:23] we cannot fully serve and worship him
[1:01:28] yet we are slaves to so many things in
[1:01:31] this life
[1:01:34] you want to see who and what you are
[1:01:36] worshiping
[1:01:39] see how much time you spend on different
[1:01:42] things
[1:01:45] you spend we spend so much time in
[1:01:48] nonsense nowadays
[1:01:52] either a few weeks ago when we were in
[1:01:54] Colorado
[1:01:56] I went to visit brother Patrick
[1:01:59] and uh and there he he asked us a
[1:02:02] question
[1:02:03] he said have you ever looked on your
[1:02:06] phone and your tablet and
[1:02:07] and seen how much time you actually
[1:02:09] spend on that is
[1:02:15] yeah
[1:02:17] he said I looked at it and I was
[1:02:20] sickened whip
[1:02:31] let's be there
[1:02:33] and all the
[1:02:35] band the videos after videos of YouTube
[1:02:37] and videos that was the YouTube and so
[1:02:40] many things on our social media
[1:02:42] platforms
[1:02:44] when it's all said and done
[1:02:46] there's a log
[1:02:49] and the log
[1:02:50] is the measurements
[1:02:54] it measures you your media stand
[1:02:57] sometimes we don't like the measurements
[1:02:59] huh
[1:03:01] right I'm going to lose weight
[1:03:06] get me a smaller suit
[1:03:08] we have a running joke
[1:03:11] and it is
[1:03:14] we can fit into a slim
[1:03:16] slim on this like four or five sizes
[1:03:19] bigger than what we use
[1:03:22] it
[1:03:24] if we start measuring
[1:03:29] there's a lot of things we're not going
[1:03:31] to like because
[1:03:35] we enjoy those little cakes
[1:03:39] [Music]
[1:03:42] a little extra hot fudge on the ice
[1:03:45] cream
[1:03:46] then when we go to put it on the coat it
[1:03:49] just you know
[1:03:52] I didn't know I was that size
[1:03:56] it's no different than when we look at
[1:03:58] those things
[1:04:01] measures all the time that we that we
[1:04:03] that we waste
[1:04:06] and then we say Lord you are number one
[1:04:10] in my life
[1:04:12] yeah you calculate the time you spend
[1:04:15] with him
[1:04:17] by the time we spend with everything
[1:04:19] else
[1:04:20] and it's not even close
[1:04:25] he said this brother Patrick says
[1:04:27] Patrick you know Tavis I'm gonna start
[1:04:31] in December in December month and I'm
[1:04:34] going to detox and and this is
[1:04:42] I said that's a good idea here's when
[1:04:44] he's there so I'm going to ask you
[1:04:47] how many you want to detox from all your
[1:04:49] electronics
[1:04:53] raise your hand or say Amen if you're
[1:04:56] not going to do it
[1:04:57] hold you to it
[1:05:00] let me see how many of you
[1:05:06] now you know all the things that you do
[1:05:09] on it
[1:05:10] if you use your phone to call somebody
[1:05:12] or or if you use it for work or or
[1:05:15] you're studying or whatever that I'm not
[1:05:17] talking about that is
[1:05:24] leave it with you
[1:05:28] how many how many are willing to do that
[1:05:38] oh
[1:05:42] I think I can just leave right now
[1:05:45] just let that settlement come back and
[1:05:48] ask you in a little bit think about it
[1:05:52] time to measure ourselves
[1:05:55] but but I'm not talking about having a
[1:05:58] measuring stick
[1:06:01] going around measuring everyone else
[1:06:06] you don't measure up to what I think a
[1:06:08] Christian should be like churches have
[1:06:11] measuring sticks
[1:06:13] yes or yes COC and they're always
[1:06:16] everyone's measuring everyone else
[1:06:20] I'm not talking about that kind of
[1:06:22] measuring
[1:06:24] he gave John a read
[1:06:27] to measure the worshipers
[1:06:30] or Not by Church ideas
[1:06:38] but but measure it by this read
[1:06:42] what is this really it's God's word
[1:06:45] it is
[1:06:52] I see
[1:06:53] [Music]
[1:06:56] not trying to get people to live up to
[1:06:58] my standards
[1:07:00] there's a standard of the word that is
[1:07:03] much greater than what what our
[1:07:05] standards
[1:07:07] but I wonder how much or how many of us
[1:07:10] would let God actually use us or use the
[1:07:15] standard for us
[1:07:20] you find out how addicted you are so
[1:07:24] many things
[1:07:26] and at this point
[1:07:28] so many people don't even care
[1:07:32] and that's the sad thing yes many are
[1:07:35] not even willing or wanting to fight
[1:07:37] anymore
[1:07:39] that's what I do that's what I do for a
[1:07:42] good time so uh
[1:07:45] that's between you and the Lord I was
[1:07:48] just asking a question is
[1:08:06] we're all guilty of those things
[1:08:13] measure the worship
[1:08:16] my goodness
[1:08:22] when you see those things that it hurts
[1:08:24] you to your soul
[1:08:26] not whether somebody wants to detox or
[1:08:29] not yes
[1:08:32] but that the word doesn't change
[1:08:38] I'm going to say it again the word
[1:08:39] changes foreign
[1:09:01] then here most people think that
[1:09:05] their jobs are secularism
[1:09:11] meaning they have no religious or
[1:09:13] spiritual bases
[1:09:17] we go to work
[1:09:20] and same thing over and over again
[1:09:24] [Music]
[1:09:25] we say work is what we do on a daily
[1:09:28] basis
[1:09:30] just to make money to survive or to live
[1:09:33] on
[1:09:35] see if that's true
[1:09:38] what a waste of over a hundred thousand
[1:09:42] hours
[1:09:43] of one's life
[1:09:50] okay think about that
[1:09:55] stop and think about those things cost
[1:09:58] us over a hundred thousand hours of work
[1:10:02] an average person working 40 hours a
[1:10:04] week for whatever however
[1:10:11] over a hundred thousand hours with no
[1:10:13] meaning at all
[1:10:17] and with no connection
[1:10:20] Tiempo
[1:10:24] I don't know about you that's a lot of
[1:10:25] time
[1:10:27] and people view their jobs
[1:10:29] and they say it's the necessary evil
[1:10:33] says
[1:10:36] and when we when we when we see that
[1:10:41] is we work five six days a week and then
[1:10:45] we Come And We Worship the Lord on
[1:10:48] Sunday
[1:10:52] and I say what an error
[1:10:58] why the Hebrews don't view it like that
[1:11:01] is
[1:11:05] when we look at at the amount of time we
[1:11:08] spend at work
[1:11:12] the true worshipers
[1:11:16] has such a different mentality about
[1:11:19] those things
[1:11:20] the Bible tells us in Exodus 34 21.
[1:11:25] six days shall thou work it says and the
[1:11:30] word work there is
[1:11:32] the same as to dress it is
[1:11:36] it's the word again
[1:11:39] six days shall you serve shall you work
[1:11:43] shall you worship
[1:11:45] but on the seventh day Thou shalt rest
[1:11:50] so to the worshiper even at their jobs
[1:11:55] they are working for the Lord they are
[1:11:58] worshiping the Lord
[1:12:00] they live in a constant worship
[1:12:02] constantly
[1:12:05] yeah how many are with me this morning
[1:12:08] trying to get something across here this
[1:12:11] morning
[1:12:13] it's not just a certain time of the week
[1:12:18] the true worshipers who Worship in
[1:12:22] spirit and in truth
[1:12:24] then they are constantly doing
[1:12:28] they don't take a break from it it is
[1:12:32] who they are worshipers
[1:12:37] how many are with me
[1:12:39] we want to drive this home today
[1:12:44] they are worshipers constantly
[1:12:47] every aspect of their lives
[1:12:50] every moment every minute every hour
[1:12:54] they are a witness
[1:12:57] they are a worshiper to the god that
[1:13:00] they serve
[1:13:02] do we give are all at work Christians
[1:13:05] should do
[1:13:07] we treat others well
[1:13:10] are we honest are we an example to those
[1:13:14] around us
[1:13:15] to those we come in contact with
[1:13:19] imagine if we could see our work as a
[1:13:23] time of worship
[1:13:27] an opportunity to glorify God to a world
[1:13:32] in darkness
[1:13:34] that's what real worship is all about
[1:13:37] it's not just coming to church and
[1:13:39] saying amen and raising your hands
[1:13:44] a to be out in the world
[1:13:47] glorify God with your life
[1:13:51] that's the greatest worship you can ever
[1:13:54] do
[1:13:55] not by how loud you say Amen
[1:13:59] worship is the life that you live
[1:14:03] he glorifies God measure
[1:14:08] the worshiper
[1:14:10] there's fine people in the world brother
[1:14:13] Brown says
[1:14:17] but there's only one Mrs Jesus Jesus
[1:14:23] come on here's the measure there's only
[1:14:27] one Mrs Jesus
[1:14:29] now if I were to ask you how many of you
[1:14:32] believe you're part of Mrs Jesus Jesus
[1:14:39] there's only one message Jesus Christ
[1:14:45] that's where his name lays
[1:14:49] there is where his worship is
[1:14:54] worship is not in everybody
[1:14:58] yet the churches are full of worshipers
[1:15:02] his worship he says it is in her and her
[1:15:07] alone
[1:15:12] all that we do don't let some all that
[1:15:16] we do
[1:15:18] in word or indeed
[1:15:21] we do it in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:15:25] only she worships under the fire
[1:15:31] only she worships under that logos that
[1:15:34] Pillar of Fire
[1:15:36] that's why the worshiper wants purged
[1:15:42] has no more desire of sin anymore
[1:15:47] that's the key word
[1:15:50] the churchgoer once purged
[1:15:53] not the religious person
[1:16:00] has no more desire for sin that's why I
[1:16:04] tell people and I say if you're still
[1:16:07] doing your things on the side
[1:16:09] in your dope and drinking your alcohol
[1:16:13] and watching your little pornography in
[1:16:15] your little shows
[1:16:17] you have not been purged yet
[1:16:20] might as well say it the way it is
[1:16:23] not been purged the worshiper once
[1:16:28] I don't have no more desire for those
[1:16:32] things
[1:16:33] yeah we've got desires for a lot of
[1:16:36] things
[1:16:38] I will share my glory with no one he
[1:16:42] says
[1:16:45] I sure enjoyed brother Jack Duff when we
[1:16:48] were in last week in Tucson
[1:16:52] talking about Let the Fire Fall this is
[1:17:03] began to talk about the generations
[1:17:07] and how that history repeats itself
[1:17:13] what God did he says it takes about four
[1:17:17] generations
[1:17:20] to repeat what God did in the original
[1:17:23] generation
[1:17:25] so he starts to talk and he's reading
[1:17:28] brother Branham
[1:17:29] brother Brandon begins to talk about
[1:17:32] the first generation or the first one
[1:17:34] would be the messenger of the age
[1:17:40] right and so the first messenger of the
[1:17:45] age would be the first generation
[1:17:48] and he starts by lighting that Messenger
[1:17:52] on fire
[1:17:55] to that age he has the fire to that age
[1:18:00] he's got the fire
[1:18:02] but by the second generation
[1:18:06] fire begins to dwindle down
[1:18:10] there but it's not very small
[1:18:14] he said but by the third generation
[1:18:18] it was usually only just Embers left on
[1:18:24] little Embers that's all that's left
[1:18:28] he said and by the fourth generation
[1:18:30] that would be you young you young people
[1:18:34] by the fourth generation
[1:18:37] he says there's no Vestige of the
[1:18:41] original flame anymore
[1:18:46] this is what we're dealing with
[1:18:51] when we look at our young people
[1:18:54] fourth generation is the advantage of
[1:18:58] what the original fire
[1:19:00] foreign
[1:19:30] [Music]
[1:19:53] church this is this is serious
[1:19:56] are young people
[1:19:58] they can they'll die on the vine
[1:20:01] there'll die just as much inside of
[1:20:04] church as they will out there in the
[1:20:06] world
[1:20:08] and who wants to help
[1:20:13] I always say it's easy to say and show
[1:20:16] hey yeah there's a problem
[1:20:19] yeah but who's going to do something
[1:20:21] about it
[1:20:24] thank you I understand why that such an
[1:20:27] attack spiritually speaking
[1:20:31] to to get after and to understand true
[1:20:35] worship
[1:20:37] once the fourth generation
[1:20:40] to finish there
[1:20:44] I'm gonna ask you young young people
[1:20:47] how many of you wanted to finish with
[1:20:50] your parents that's it
[1:20:52] are you all satisfied with that
[1:20:54] satisfaction
[1:20:55] my mind
[1:20:57] you're the fourth generation and there's
[1:20:59] nothing brother man says there's no
[1:21:01] what's that word again let me find that
[1:21:03] word there's no Vestige of the original
[1:21:05] flame anymore
[1:21:11] I was hearing the other day oh yeah and
[1:21:14] I had never heard the rest of the story
[1:21:16] [Music]
[1:21:17] Brandon was sitting talking to some
[1:21:19] people
[1:21:21] and I knew this part of the story
[1:21:25] and he looked down to time why did you
[1:21:27] say 1977.
[1:21:31] he said because after 1977 it was so
[1:21:35] dark
[1:21:38] so dark I don't I don't see how anyone
[1:21:41] could live past that
[1:21:44] is you live in such darkness
[1:21:49] and I had heard that but I had never
[1:21:51] heard the last part of it
[1:21:54] they said that someone then asked
[1:21:56] brother Branham and says
[1:21:57] what if we ever get two thousands
[1:22:03] brother Brandon just said
[1:22:06] they would be the true bride of Jesus
[1:22:12] no one else could live in that time
[1:22:15] everyone else would have a form of
[1:22:17] godliness
[1:22:19] but no one else can live in this time
[1:22:23] no one else can overcome no one else can
[1:22:27] be a true worship
[1:22:31] elected by God to be that
[1:22:36] it's it is so serious
[1:22:40] how many of you young people
[1:22:43] it's a hard time
[1:22:45] I understand I get it
[1:22:48] I have the fourth generation
[1:22:50] there's no Vestige of the original flame
[1:22:53] yeah
[1:22:55] when all looks so gloomy and bad for you
[1:22:58] all
[1:22:59] come on are you all ready for this is
[1:23:02] come on now I'm gonna say it again are
[1:23:04] you ready for it and all seems to be
[1:23:07] lost in the fourth generation
[1:23:11] God comes and lights the fire
[1:23:16] that is a promise to every one of you
[1:23:20] that you don't have to be sad about this
[1:23:23] no more
[1:23:24] well I just don't understand or I don't
[1:23:27] get it
[1:23:28] and I know brother Tommy was a
[1:23:30] tremendous man but I wasn't here
[1:23:34] I just hear my parents
[1:23:40] lift the fire again
[1:23:43] come on Church Revival fires are flowing
[1:23:48] people are flowing everywhere
[1:23:51] what God did in Uganda
[1:23:54] you all could just see that
[1:23:57] it's the fire again in your generation
[1:24:01] you would know that Jesus Christ
[1:24:05] yesterday
[1:24:08] with our founding passes
[1:24:13] let the fire church
[1:24:15] you want the fire get it Fuego all you
[1:24:18] gotta do is say Lord I want that fire
[1:24:22] and start to worship under the fire
[1:24:26] you'll never make it without worshiping
[1:24:29] under the fire
[1:24:32] that's the promise that history he
[1:24:35] repeats itself
[1:24:37] the fourth generation
[1:24:42] fervent desired please
[1:24:54] it all began to fade as the church went
[1:24:57] on Olympians
[1:25:01] the abandonment to God was dying out
[1:25:06] and people weren't too careful about
[1:25:09] what God thought of them anymore
[1:25:18] they changed their manner of dress their
[1:25:20] attitudes
[1:25:23] their attitudes their behaviors
[1:25:28] did the church age of Ephesus
[1:25:35] for drifting Souls on the sea of life
[1:25:40] that cycle of Revival in and death has
[1:25:43] never failed
[1:25:45] so he
[1:25:48] is
[1:25:49] thankful to God for that is
[1:25:51] why we must worship under the fire
[1:25:55] because our God is
[1:26:02] he will not let you be a part-time
[1:26:05] person
[1:26:09] he will share his glory with no one no
[1:26:12] compartment
[1:26:15] ah mama
[1:26:17] you asked
[1:26:18] for today
[1:26:20] come on you want to see where you're at
[1:26:22] understand let me ask you all of you
[1:26:26] of all your Christian experiences that

[1:26:37] o
[1:26:40] when was your Christian experience the
[1:26:42] most serious
[1:26:46] first love when I first came to the Lord
[1:26:53] ask yourself that question come on we're
[1:26:56] measuring with the word that was church
[1:27:00] when was it most important and
[1:27:06] great at its greatest points
[1:27:12] well when I got the baptism of the Holy
[1:27:14] Ghost brother is
[1:27:17] if that's the case
[1:27:20] you better run
[1:27:23] because you have fallen foreign
[1:27:28] [Music]
[1:27:55] Grace according to the measure of the
[1:27:58] gift of Christ
[1:28:09] till we all come in the unity of the
[1:28:12] faith
[1:28:14] and of the knowledge of the Son of God
[1:28:18] unto a perfect man
[1:28:21] unto the measure of the stature of the
[1:28:25] fullness of Christ
[1:28:27] 16 yes he says from whom the whole body
[1:28:31] fitly joined together
[1:28:35] and compacted by that which every joint
[1:28:38] supply of events
[1:28:43] according to the effectual working in
[1:28:46] the measure of every part
[1:28:50] it makes an increase of the body unto
[1:28:53] the edifying of itself in love
[1:28:58] there is a body in every member of that
[1:29:01] body has to be measured
[1:29:04] and it's giving a certain measure of
[1:29:07] Grace
[1:29:09] thank the Lord for that
[1:29:11] every messenger that Christ sends
[1:29:15] comes with a message
[1:29:17] that message is
[1:29:24] the measuring stick for their generation
[1:29:30] I'm gonna say it again in the world
[1:29:32] every messenger comes with a message
[1:29:39] they'll be judged Every Generation by
[1:29:42] that reason
[1:29:45] Matthew 11 says
[1:29:48] they departed in
[1:29:50] Jesus began to talk to the multitude
[1:29:52] about John
[1:29:54] Jesus
[1:30:00] you've heard about John what did you go
[1:30:03] to see
[1:30:04] a reed shaken With The Wind
[1:30:07] in other words man's
[1:30:10] measuring sticks
[1:30:13] that bends with every wind of Doctrine
[1:30:16] because
[1:30:19] oh my is that what you went to see is
[1:30:23] someone that would bend the measuring a
[1:30:24] little bit because of the systems or the
[1:30:26] churches
[1:30:33] no no no this read wasn't shaken by any
[1:30:36] Winds of Doctrine
[1:30:39] he wasn't removed by religious orders or
[1:30:42] systems
[1:30:44] but he brought a message with him
[1:30:48] and his message was that behold I send
[1:30:51] my messenger
[1:30:53] before thy face which shall prepare thy
[1:30:56] way before this
[1:30:59] what a thing it is
[1:31:02] prophet of the age comes and brings a
[1:31:05] message
[1:31:06] let me tell you that is our message
[1:31:11] measure yourself with it
[1:31:13] come on now John is the type of the
[1:31:16] Bride
[1:31:17] he was given a read
[1:31:20] measure the worshipers
[1:31:23] but it's not measure the worshipers
[1:31:26] measure someone else with it
[1:31:29] just measure yourself
[1:31:32] are you a worshiper
[1:31:34] take the message of the hour and measure
[1:31:37] yourself
[1:31:39] we're too caught up many times measuring
[1:31:42] everyone else
[1:31:44] we measure a church service like I said
[1:31:47] the other day
[1:31:48] by how much Sensational emotions
[1:31:52] based on that
[1:31:54] where are you getting your measuring
[1:31:56] stick from they don't understand
[1:31:58] come on church it's time we throw away
[1:32:00] our measuring sticks
[1:32:03] having a measuring stick like that
[1:32:05] foreign
[1:32:12] come on now
[1:32:17] our measuring sticks
[1:32:20] custom made
[1:32:23] to our feelings
[1:32:26] our emotions
[1:32:28] are thinking
[1:32:30] of life I think this is
[1:32:36] even if I say I think it doesn't matter
[1:32:39] it matters what Christopher
[1:32:44] yeah
[1:32:47] we tend to judge a church
[1:32:51] how many people
[1:32:53] in the church like us
[1:32:57] what a dumb message
[1:33:02] hello everybody well they don't like me
[1:33:04] that really where's gonna get it
[1:33:12] well I like a lot of people in that
[1:33:14] church
[1:33:15] what a dumb foreign
[1:33:26] we should never measure someone by how
[1:33:29] they act towards us
[1:33:34] we should never measure someone by how
[1:33:37] they act towards us
[1:33:40] we should measure ourselves
[1:33:43] by how we respond to the way
[1:33:50] hello Church hola English
[1:33:53] now we're using the right measuring
[1:33:55] stick
[1:33:56] we're using the right the right read now
[1:34:02] does it make you any lesser of Who You
[1:34:05] Are
[1:34:07] or do you not like it because it's
[1:34:09] uncovering things about you that are not
[1:34:11] like oh no
[1:34:13] stand up where did you get that support
[1:34:17] where did that building come from
[1:34:20] the pits of Hell everybody
[1:34:24] [Music]
[1:34:28] but we have our own guidelines of how to
[1:34:31] judge people
[1:34:37] I hear people saying people talking all
[1:34:40] the time majority of the time is just a
[1:34:43] bunch of nonsense and you let it
[1:34:45] goes I heard some people saying you know
[1:34:49] certain such and such a people not to
[1:34:51] mention names
[1:35:00] and I say to that what a dumb spirit
[1:35:07] [Music]
[1:35:08] I bring any a challenge to anyone that
[1:35:10] wants to talk about that
[1:35:14] there is not one person that we as a
[1:35:16] church have ever forced out of church
[1:35:21] get that measuring they don't understand
[1:35:26] [Music]
[1:35:27] that there are conflicts in a church
[1:35:29] even certain characters
[1:35:33] show me a church you don't have that
[1:35:35] question
[1:35:36] come on show me a family where there's
[1:35:39] no conflict
[1:35:44] come on now
[1:35:45] but to say that our people Force
[1:35:47] somebody out you know this is
[1:36:05] that's the measurement that's what it
[1:36:08] does
[1:36:09] it takes you there
[1:36:14] foreign
[1:37:03] you're using the wrong measuring sticks
[1:37:10] it's so sick spirit
[1:37:14] S Services
[1:37:17] let me ask you a question
[1:37:20] we become very judgmental Services
[1:37:24] how many of you would like to be judged
[1:37:27] by partial truth
[1:37:31] anybody here
[1:37:35] why not
[1:37:37] because you want the judge to hear your
[1:37:41] side of the story
[1:37:43] then why do we judge others with partial
[1:37:46] trips
[1:37:51] measure the worship
[1:37:55] let's see the standard the Reed the
[1:37:58] stick
[1:38:00] that we should measure ourselves with
[1:38:05] trying to measure everybody else
[1:38:10] because you got your own little sticks
[1:38:16] this is the this is the standard this is
[1:38:18] the read
[1:38:19] Luke 6 says 36 says be therefore
[1:38:24] merciful
[1:38:26] yeah
[1:38:28] as your father also is merciful
[1:38:33] judge not know who's gays and he shall
[1:38:36] not be judged
[1:38:39] he shall not be condemned you know
[1:38:42] forgive and ye shall be forgiven
[1:38:47] give does and it shall be given unto you
[1:38:51] good measure
[1:38:55] taken together and running over shall
[1:39:00] men give in to your bosom or with the
[1:39:03] same measure that you need
[1:39:06] with all it shall be measured to you
[1:39:09] again
[1:39:10] in other words the standard by that you
[1:39:14] use to judge
[1:39:16] the same standard that will be used
[1:39:18] against you
[1:39:21] holy spirit is telling you don't do that
[1:39:25] that's yourself yes who is
[1:39:28] trying to judge everyone else by your
[1:39:30] own standard
[1:39:33] I had to go check and see what that
[1:39:35] meant
[1:39:38] good measure um
[1:39:49] the Bible's there I was like reading I
[1:39:51] was like yesterday
[1:39:54] I'll go back to the other go to English
[1:39:58] good measure wait a minute down shaken
[1:40:01] together running over restaurant
[1:40:08] you know what it was it's when you went
[1:40:11] to the market
[1:40:12] and you and you bought something from
[1:40:15] someone
[1:40:16] that was generous is
[1:40:18] poured the grain into your containers
[1:40:22] and they so for a good measure
[1:40:26] you began to press it down
[1:40:30] somebody that wasn't generous they would
[1:40:32] put it like that and they say okay
[1:40:39] they shook it a little bit it settles a
[1:40:43] little bit and as it settles then oh
[1:40:46] there's more there's more that thing we
[1:40:47] can put in there
[1:40:49] and shake it together and then the
[1:40:52] generous person would put some more
[1:40:54] grains and they would press it down
[1:41:00] and then the last scoop it ran over and
[1:41:05] then you say oh
[1:41:06] with the same measure Jesus is telling
[1:41:09] them
[1:41:12] with all it shall be measured to you
[1:41:16] oh it's good it's with Bueno when
[1:41:19] something like that happens
[1:41:21] we weren't expecting that great
[1:41:23] generosity
[1:41:25] so how important is it
[1:41:29] to be a worshiper a true worshiper of
[1:41:32] God
[1:41:33] utmost
[1:41:37] importance or without worship

[1:43:32] in other words he had perfect worships
[1:43:39] one that fear God and issue with evil
