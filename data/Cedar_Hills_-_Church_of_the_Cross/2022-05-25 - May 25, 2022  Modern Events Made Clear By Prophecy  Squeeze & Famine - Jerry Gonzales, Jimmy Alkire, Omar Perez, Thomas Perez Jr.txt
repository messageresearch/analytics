grateful to god that we do have warning the the word of god tells us that he does not do anything without warning us first then judgment so we're we're grateful to god you know it it used to be anterior i i i before we go i go there i want to go if you could turn into your bibles the second timothy a second timothy the third chapter and we're going to verse read verse 1. and it says this this year this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come with two topics and one of them is is is will be dealing with famine [Music] which is uh natural and spiritual and then we will be dealing with another topic that will be called the squeeze but i but i we one of the things that that we discussed and it is it should be on everybody's mind as you heard our pastor speak to us you know it growing up in the message christine we we we believed and and we still do of what brother branham said about 1977. we just believe what we believe but i i remember i remember as a child that we we had very little of what was the called the of the earth's possession and there is nothing wrong with having with having there's nothing wrong with having nice vehicles there's nothing to be wrong to be successful [Music] believe that we're all successful in here [Music] but one thing that we used to always speak about was the coming of the lord it could be tomorrow it could be tonight it'd be in five minutes it could be it could be right now well yes and i i remember uh that we would we would say it was 1977. we had even songs about it a song about it one of them was the saints go marching hurahura in 77. [Music] but what it gave it gave you is the is the always the urgency and the expectation of not how much money am i going to make tomorrow which is fine i pray that each one of you becomes a billionaire tomorrow but that wasn't our preoccupation [Music] our preoccupation was was that we wanted to please the lord and we wanted to consider closer to him and that he was right around the corner and every night i remember my papa and my mom they would play songs and we weren't we were not united around a television we didn't have ipads or iphones but we were we were there uh speaking about what god was doing i remember my papa he he would hear a message with the revelation that god gave him and we would sing [Music] is so i'm going to i'm going to start by uh by let's take the scripture of amos 8. verse 11 and 12 verses and the bible tells us behold the days come in sayeth the lord you say el senor that i will send a famine in the land but of the hearing of the words of the lord and they shall wander from to seek the law to seek the word of the lord and shall not find it now when i began to read this scripture you know i there at the barbershop i have a scripture put up on my wall it's found in deuteronomy and it says you will be blessed when you come in and blessed when you go out and this little boy came to me and he asked me what's deuteronomy i began to explain that it was a book of the bible and then he asked me what is the bible and in my heart my heart sank interesting because when i was growing up whether you went to church or not see yvonne but as i began to think about this you see that yet for for us a lot of times the privilege that we have to hear the word of it should god a responsibility inside each and every one of us so sometimes this is so so we read the bible and and sometimes we try to figure out what well how is this famine going to hit me i'm in the message i read my bible and and does this mean that that god is not going to speak no more and it doesn't mean any of that no significant other what it means is that man no longer will have the ability to understand what it's saying to them as you heard everything else becomes more we put more focus on everything else in our life and sometimes we feel like we we heard from the presence of the almighty yeah and sometimes we we run off of the emotion of it yeah this is correct you say wow what a service it is what did you learn today i have no idea and a lot of times people are in a spiritual family without even recognizing it this is we have put the emphasis on the wrong things in our life emphasis in las cosas incorrect we see that the native americans they they they were very spiritual people yeah but the problem that they had was that they worshipped the creation more than the creator and we find that true that happens inside the church today in contrary it's great to write songs but but you see those things are to tell the lord thank you for what you've done if we never have the relationship with the lord jesus christ god is jesus then we have no idea what we're talking about or singing about it so so in this nest we see that people would rather look to a priest and that's all good we have to look to our pastors we have to understand it's not just our pastor as a man we have to understand that god himself there's a man in our pastor that has humbled himself are you are you this is what should happen to each and every one of us is that god's voice has never stopped speaking to us we've just stopped hearing his voice either no but you would get so upset and i'll never forget going outside and saying lord why are they so mean with me recorded omar omar honor your father and your mother i looked all in the trees i looked everywhere and i was scared out of my mind because i had no idea who this man was talking and what this famine does to you is it starts a relentless search in a person the problem is is that we stop searching for god a all of a sudden an idolatrous spirit comes and takes over us and you see in the bible any time a famine would happen it was because a lot of times that israel started looking after strange gods stopped hearing wanting to hear the voice of the lord the one thing i can't stress enough to you young people is this okay it's good to have entertainment it's great to have the dramas that go on in things but you can't you cannot deny the way you have to find god there's nothing old-fashioned about it gotta get those things and get those phrases and kick them out you have to find the way to christ the way our grandfathers found him the way our parents it doesn't just happen like lord i desire to to to worship you and how you know to for you to help me okay you have to begin prayer you have to begin reading you have to start going through things to search him the bible tells you when you begin to search he starts looking for you and you find out he's been looking for you this whole time but it ain't gonna happen well let's just fill the lord by let's have a little drama let's find these other ways to seek the lord let's have activities there's nothing that takes place from going and reading the word of god and knowing it and placing it in your heart so so i'll say this real quick and you know you see this today in the world in in in these churches do you ever wonder why you know you you see these from maybe elevation worship or these different churches you ever wonder why they all have the same worship like they all have their hands raised the same way start crying at the same time and a lot of times we see this on youtube as young people and we're like man welcome our church isn't like that is well what happens is that you find out what they do is they put a chemical in the air in chemicals and it drives a person's emotions and all of a sudden it's something that's made up that repentance and why do they have to drive the emotion of their people that way and the reason why is because they have nobody to give them the word that today the the earth they're looking for a real god everywhere for him we find there is an answer um i'm more of a preacher so i like to run real fast this is this is different for me but what does this do this makes you make sure what you have in your heart what the what is deep inside of you guys but it'll go remember put your your spiritual thinking cap on i mean it kind of it it goes back and forth together it goes back and forth [Music] and and so so you're one one of the greatest things that's going to ha and you're going to hit on this is is is ukraine aren't you is is what this is causing eventually world famine there or in different parts of the world because of what's happening in god bless you this this evening thank you pastor for confidence and uh i want to start off by using the same scripture that brother omar read is behold the days come saith the lord god that i will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor thirst for water but of hearing the words notice how it says it in plural the words of the lord is thank you brother mark for breaking that open glass uh it's hard to break the ice in the beginning it's a very good platform for me so thank you so thinking about famine you know and i was thinking what what can i say about famine that people don't already know establish everybody knows famine is scarcity [Music] lack of food so but as i started studying and going into this i found out that he actually what the majority of the world suffers they say about 800 million people worldwide they suffer from what's called food insecurity it's kind of similar to a famine is similar but there's some characteristics of a famine that make it a famines characteristic so we'll find out as we as we go but the majority of the people they're in poverty they're hungry so that's where i was so there's yeah so a famine okay they say famine is actually rare they say is [Music] is uh is uh it is uh it's rare it's israel in order so in order to be classified as a famine classification an area must exhibit specific metrics and one of those being that about 30 of the population is they're what's called acutely malnourished like severely malnourished yeah so and and that leads to a high mortality rate yes [Music] poverty and food insecurity a place or country that can have a shortage for like a small time element that only shows that there's a hunger categorized by the following factors [Music] it's it's severe food shortage than what we know but watch look at the causes of a famine it used to be a natural disaster this is naturalest it should be the crop failure fires etc but to say the number one cause of a famine today in this day la causa so the number one reason is conflict so you see what's happening in ukraine right now number one they say ukraine is as a major exporter of wheat because of the conflict there is a conflict i believe there was only they were saying like 10 weeks left that was stored up of wheat so like i said number one is conflict now not that there's a shortage of food which there is but it's the people don't have access to the food so you so you start to see like i said you jump around okay back and forth and natural and spiritual because there's food stored up in the in the storehouse but what's happening is not being distributed out but okay number one they don't have access to it number two the population because they don't have access to it they become what's called malnourished because of lack of food they don't get the vitamins that they need elements and even in the children and those of you that have had children knows when they're born they go and they measure them the height the weight so i think you can do their height is so famine shows that this has been happening for some time which ultimately leads to the third one and the third one ultimately is death but do the people die of starvation they say because of the malnourishment of the people they're susceptible to any disease or even something as common as diarrhea is it says at least 20 percent of the household given in a group they face food deficits with no ability to cope so the sad thing about it is you see that starting to hit america america the baby formula i mean you go go to the store and there's empty shelves all over us so you start to see it creep into the beginning stages of it you know they say that a lot of the elderly are suffering right now is but those are the ones starting to suffer so you start to see it creep in here [Music] in america we thought we were so everything was great and it is in america but you start to see it slip into this in this condition people in affected by a famine also experience other impacts widespread hunger obviously [Music] so you see the difference a little bit between what actual people that are hungry so now we're not talking about denominations those aren't even in [Music] through history are man-made many of the worst famines have been due to the poor distribution [Music] of existing food supplies the the which result in the lack of purchasing power among with the normal distribution or relief movements of food isn't that what we're seeing today unfortunately our administration that's in office today and others will talk about the oil [Music] but you see how the decisions that have been made are directly impacting the people so isn't it the same in the churches that's why it's very important to choose your pastor because he will determine how the economy of the church will go if he preaches half the word it's only a matter of time before but if the distribution isn't there so you start to see it the malnourishment of the congregation what happens diseases start to crop up [Music] few minutes okay so yeah um yes you can so how do we escape this famine how what are we gonna do how do we get away from this he says and i'll read towards the bottom i'll just read this last in about religion watch what he says you watch for a depression brother you think you've seen something you just wait long and cry to hear the word of god the bible says there will be a famine in the last days and not for bread and water alone but watch this what for hearing doesn't say the word of god because because there's a lot of things that are taken out of the word sometimes you'll want to hear the true word of god be strong this is going to show you how we escape it we're going to see how the widow woman escaped it and i just can't quite say like he does [Music] that stick was a cross two sticks the bible said the boy said go through the yard and get two stinks the same time up on the mountain there's a voice thundered down to the prophet and said go to the city i have commanded both of them obeyed something has to happen both of them are obeying if the preacher preaches the word and the man that receives it believes it and acts upon it something's got to happen if you're a sinner you'll have to be saved if you're sick you'll have to be he will be called god promised it if we are certain of god as certain as he's god he has to keep his word certain then the commandment must go to the city for i have commanded a widow woman a vision broke before the prophet here he comes walking he doesn't know where he's going don't make any difference he's just obeying she don't know where the sticks will be land but there's two sticks in the yard somewhere she starts off she goes out into the yard she looks like oh how hot the screams from the city the night prowlers coming in that streaming along drinking their wine and so forth she looks down the street she sees nothing she finds one stick part of the cross self sacrifice she gets another piece of stick and when she picked up that second stick oh i'll assume it must have been death laying at the door her and her son had to eat one little piece of a whole cake and die that was all of it and sometimes right in the midst of gloom that we hear the voice when she picked up that second stick and started back that was the voice come over the gate tank that smeared in the water in a vessel she turned to look with these two sticks in her hand with the meal and oral mixed and ready she said [ __ ] dressed it mixed it together that's what the word and the spirit has to mix together laid up on the cross of self-sacrifice to deny anything that's contrary to what you've asked that's right i've mixed it i'm going to get these sticks and that boy said bring me a little drink of water in a vessel she looks and she sees a man standing across the gate thin cheek bearded ball headed looking across the gate with an old piece of sheepskin wrapped around him looked like he was kind of a kind looking old gentleman she said i'll share my water with him waters of life you're willing to give it to anybody to tell anyone to go anywhere just a moment sir she starts back with the sticks in her hand and the voice thundered again not only do you shear your water but bring me a little marshal of bread in your hand bread of life water of life was it of life should die as soon as that perished bring me your water and bring me your bread what do we find here what lesson can we find seek ye first the kingdom of god and all his righteousness other things will be added bring me a little water and a marshal of bread then she turns in her gloom i can hear her say sir something like this you're different from man that i've seen and man that i hear speak you seem to be so positive of what you're saying but if i only got enough meal just a handful and just a spoonful of oil i've dressed it and i'm going to cook it with these two sticks i am going to eat it me and my son and die that's all i got what will your there next but fetch me the little cake first god first no matter what anybody else says what anything else what any evidence how gloomy it looks whatever it may be thank god first his word first doctor said i can't get well but his word first i'm too much of a sinner i'm a prostitute i'm a gambler i'm a drunkard god's word first though your sins be a scarlet they shall be as white as snow red like crimson they'll be white like first god don't bring me a little cake first all that you've got bring it to me are you willing to give it in his hand my life all that i am i'm 50 years old are you willing william brown to lay it to me are you willing you little children to lay your life to me are you willing can you do it sick people can you trust me put me first bring a marshal of bread in your hand and fetch me a little water she looked at him there was something told her that man know what he was talking about god knows his own sheep my sheep know my voice they know whether it's scripture or not whether it's right or not she turns into obedience that's what you've got to do and when she turned to obey what the prophet said do then come the thunder from heaven whatever man looks to hear or that cometh thunder out of the voice of the prophet that every sinner and every sick person wants to hear thus saith the lord [Music] how that people set my driveway and say come to this door my daughters and such my baby my soda just say the word how can you say it before it's in your mouth you'd be saying it yourself but they longed to hear that the saith the lord they had come across the fence because she was obeying and the gloom broke the sailboat the barrel will not go empty though the crew shrunk dry until the day that the lord god sends ring on the earth oh what a consolation she made the cake she gave it to the prophet she went back and made some for her son and herself and they eat and drink with plenty hip on the earth where did it come from how did it get there scientifically tell me where that field come from where did that all come from how did it get in that crew people [Music] where did it come from take god at his word be certain of god he's the creator you might have lost your health you might have lost your fellowship amen can you give an applause to the lord jesus we're we we look at what we what we have uh before us i want i appreciate brother omar for the gerry for such beautiful words and appreciate our pastor mark i appreciate the the prophet of the age that's why the the the scripture that that identifies brother branham amongst many [Music] and and and that he speaks about the most is the woman at the well if thou knew was the gift we we have talked about famine we've we've talked ab tonight we when when you go home and you say i'm starved gentlemen are you talking about that brothers when you go into the cupboards and you say there's nothing to eat no i i i i want to tell you a story this is this is this is probably going to the with the famine we were we were living in truth or consequences and uh my my father was called to the missionary field [Music] how many have you ever eaten uh powdered eggs [Music] oh yeah how many have eaten drink powdered milk yeah well we're we're good we're in good company tonight and so we're you know usu usually it's uh some people don't don't know but i'm glad we do not know we were we were down to about those products and and and so there was very little little to eat but my father went out to the missionary field with ten dollars in his pocket and that was because sister ruth ruth torres gave him a ten dollar bill yes and so she went she he went out and and my i remember my my mama asking him are you gonna leave us this way without food and she said she said what would you like to eat i said i would love to eat a a a big bigger big steak [Music] told me to close my eyes [Music] and she told me to drink a glass of water and it would be a big steak i'm going to tell you in here and i'm i'm i'm a i'm a witness but yeah in my life natural have fed more than a hundred thousand people an element in uganda that otherwise would have died in uganda i don't really really understand that no no but the word of god has kept us to this day we eat like kings like no one around the world [Music] a new billionaire was minted every day during this pandemic at the same time the growing levels of inequality and the rise in food prices push 263 million people into extreme poverty this year how is it that the greatest country in the world can't can't can't find baby formula thomas jim as you're going to come into in a minute the squeeze but before brother jimmy goes into it a professor was preparing his class um [Music] if i squeeze this orange what will i get the professor said uh he looked at the professor and he said juice of course professor hijo don't you think the professor said if i could squeeze apple that i could squeeze apple juice from the oranges what about grapefruit juice no no you couldn't get apple juice and grapefruit juice from an orange juice orange juice of course he repeated his question why would i get orange juice from an orange it's correct let's think that this is not an orange but it is you pero someone puts pressure on you again says something you don't like why did this happen the boy answered el muchacho response because those things are on the inside brother the question then we must ask ourselves what comes out when i am squeezed questions you know when a man gets in that shape sometimes god brings them to the showdown it's in distress is you know it talks about how when the pressure comes the area of your liberty to area has decreased i'm in guado the rights that you had before when this squeeze really clamps down you cannot exercise them you know what tommy this shirt about the squeeze was a negative part but there's a positive part to the how many want to see what's on the inside of you come out and be expressed and with this i'd like to read acts chapter 8. verse 1 and then verse 4 verse but not in relation to what we're talking about you'll also find when he's talking about this squeeze when this pressure comes and begins to clamp down before i read this i wanted to make sure this is understood when they asked brother branham if there would be a persecution to the bride in this age it will not be a persecution like what the first apostolic church went through persecution but yet it's something that had to happen is it squeezed them to the point they had to leave and saul was consenting to his death and at the time there was a great persecution against the church which was at jerusalem and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of judea and samaria except the apostles now let's go to verse four 4. therefore they were scattered abroad and went everywhere preaching the word now the purpose of this great persecution to the church persecution notice at the time who was the head of it it was saul would putting effect all of their decisions of what they wanted to do with this bunch of fanatics that were preaching that jesus had risen from the dead orlando so that the word the gospel could go to many different places and so they finally come to to north america america wow wow but this squeeze that we're talking about i would call a minor persecution persecution and the prophet refers to it as a person of persecution but the purpose of this persecution is you guys can give me looking away to jesus paragraph 38 he starts talking about something so tremendous that's not a part of our subject tonight but we do know there is a first poll a second poll and a third point it was the manifestation of the spoken word the manifestation and we'll leave it at that so now i'm going to say something to you now that i haven't said all along and that is the thing that we've looked forward to for so long for at least many years four or five years or maybe longer the third pool has been vindicated now remember there never will be an impersonation of that recorded personification i'm going to skip down here a little bit because there's a lot of reading i've only got a little over 10 minutes left but it was done like it just happened so it could identify its presence among you but it will not be used in a great way until this council begins to tighten up the council of churches the confederation of churches [Laughter] well we actually have a little more than that okay go ahead what's what why did the prophet use confederation instead of other words so many many times you know it comes if if you check if you check in google system google brother and you look for confederation of churches it'll automatically take you to a world council of churches and the reason is confederation is the alliance or the agreement in other words there's a difference between a confederation and a federation federation is when people get together get together to oppose a certain thing that's why that's why the pharisees and the sadducees of different federations but he came into a confederation to come against jesus and so now you find out that the greatest confederation that you've ever seen is that the greatest example would be the confederacy of uh of the south during during the civil war so it starts up and then it goes into a doctrine and then it goes into the incarnation it's talking about how all the denominational systems and now it's so intertwined into our political system but after the while you won't even be able to pray for somebody at the hospital that's sick without a card from this counselor when it begins to tighten up the pentecost and so forth can almost impersonate anything that can be done but when this squeeze comes down then you'll see what you've seen temporarily be manifested in the fullness of its power and then he says it four times see see he's looking see ben man i could go bananas with that right but you know there's a couple of elements of this squeeze elements because when they begin to tell you you can't buy or sell unless you have the mark or the image of the beast and all those that that aren't sealed with the holy ghost will receive the mark of the beast as we heard the the hunger the famine was not just for bread escuchamos one of the questions the pastor put in this this subject was will the bride go through this time uh i'll leave that there because that that can really cause that can really go away but now let's to understand when this squeeze comes down or this council begins to tighten let's go to paragraph 49 guys say no all right when he begins to titan and then if paragraph 49 says it's tightening esta pretendo sorry you're right yes he don't they is it's already happening yes that continues then when that time comes and the press comes to a place to where you're pressed out that creative power that will take what you have and create more out of it absolutely to the total loss absolutely but it will be for the bride and but watch this video even though the prophet taught that the bride couldn't go to his persecution he did say this he goes how is this gonna happen how can we ever lose and he says by being divided he said stay together he goes it'll be a paradox if he can get us together don't you worry god's gonna do it he'll bring a persecution persecution that'll make us run together that's what he's going to do let's look at uh oh yeah all the division in this message people say well who's the bride and who's not i believe there's bride among all of them we're not a judge of who is or who is it but one thing for sure but i'll go one second you're going to show your true colors colors so in order for that third pull to manifest he has to bring the squeeze that brings the persecution to drive us together guys can you give me that last quote because i have five minutes yeah ultimacita tengo sound five over but i don't want to go over 10 00. yes just one this one last little quote ultima watch this you guys got the paragraph guys 19c and god always causes trouble mostly always uh to bring the people together i believe there will be a time when there won't be any more division among the people of god amen i belong to this church where i belong to that church i believe the persecution will run the big ransom church of god together and we'll be one in christ jesus jesus and then he will take her home i read the little part on purpose first it gets you excited to get your body in but now he's showing you what it's going to take when the squeeze i remember one and i'll be quiet with this because those minutes i mean when i first came in the message and i i read this first about the streets about this boy what is he talking about and i saw this banana i mentioned this to you brother and then they got it at the bottom and they just squeezed it all the and he's god bless you until we see each other again amen god bless you [Applause] hey man i'm going to ask you just to bow your head tonight maybe there's someone here tonight or
