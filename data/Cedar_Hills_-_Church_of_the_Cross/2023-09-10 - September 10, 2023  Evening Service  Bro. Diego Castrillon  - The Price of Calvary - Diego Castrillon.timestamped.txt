[21:46] he gave his only begotten son whosoever
[21:49] believeth in him should not perish but
[21:51] have everlasting life
[21:54] and we'll read it again

[22:47] pray
[22:48] Lord good evening
[22:51] Lord here we are
[22:54] trembling and with fear Lord
[22:59] at the same time we are emotional
[23:02] because you're present
[23:05] it's real in this hour
[23:09] Lord we've read this precious word
[23:13] Lord Quicken and break the bread this
[23:16] hour
[23:17] that we can recognize
[23:20] that it is
[23:24] Lord one more time in our midst of
[23:29] you be the glory in the name of our Lord
[23:31] Jesus
[23:33] you may take your seats
[23:36] everyone that's your presence
[23:39] I'd like to thank you
[23:45] it's time that you come to church
[23:49] the fact that you come sit down in that
[23:51] seat
[23:54] you are telling Satan what side you are
[23:56] on
[24:11] or perhaps celebrating a certain
[24:13] activity
[24:17] when you should be at church and you
[24:21] don't come to church
[24:23] then you are telling God uh that uh God
[24:26] what side you're on so it says it's
[24:29] important so it is important
[24:33] foreign
[24:36] I ask that you may have a little bit of
[24:39] patience
[24:43] I do not have a clear or direct message
[24:48] I like to speak about faith
[24:55] I like to to speak about healings
[25:00] because I can increase the faith of the
[25:03] people
[25:05] but what God has given me in this hour
[25:10] I want to give it in the way that he
[25:12] gave it to me
[25:16] I was speaking yesterday or perhaps you
[25:19] might may have been on Friday
[25:21] with a brother from Ukraine
[25:25] and he was asking how many brothers were
[25:28] going to go
[25:29] to the convention there in Poland is
[25:35] and I was explaining to him about this
[25:38] many are going
[25:39] and he says
[25:42] I said brother I already went
[25:47] what do you mean you you came already
[25:50] but yes brother I went he comes yes and
[25:54] I began to explain to him come on
[25:57] yes
[25:58] 10 11 years ago
[26:01] each time that my past
[26:05] each time he goes to a missionary trip
[26:07] foreign
[26:28] I can see problems that are happening
[26:31] and when I return
[26:51] it's for the benefit of the people
[26:55] when I began to tell these things to
[26:57] this brother
[27:00] there's some people that say well that's
[27:02] fine
[27:09] I believe it
[27:10] I want to hear more
[27:13] when he said that I said my friend
[27:17] we need to pray
[27:20] because this trip
[27:22] of our pastor going to Poland
[27:25] it's not just any trips
[27:28] it is
[27:32] awaiting a Revival
[27:34] and we need to to catch that plan catch
[27:38] the plan
[27:39] and the purpose
[27:42] to be able to follow that plan I said my
[27:46] friends
[27:47] I also see Satan
[27:50] the makeup position
[27:58] and I began to explain
[28:01] how God was showing us
[28:05] foreign
[28:07] how Satan was going to face
[28:11] our pastor in this group
[28:14] that we're taking the gospel not in
[28:18] words
[28:30] the fire of God
[28:32] to be able to light up
[28:36] is
[28:38] he was I was telling him these things
[28:43] how the enemy was going to make our
[28:45] position
[28:48] and this brother he took a lot of things
[28:50] out is
[29:00] we just need to find one man
[29:03] we need to find one passage
[29:05] who I saw in a business
[29:08] as soon as
[29:15] that the people can enter
[29:22] to here
[29:25] an Apostolic
[29:28] that'll be the sign
[29:30] so that what God
[29:33] placed in this man foreign
[30:30] when I heard that on Wednesday
[30:33] I went to go cry
[30:39] cry to pray and to cry
[30:42] I said Lord
[30:46] they were waiting for Diego to go Diego
[30:52] goes Diego can I help them
[30:57] I need you
[30:59] I want them to see you
[31:02] I want them to be able to see that Jesus
[31:05] Christ
[31:08] yesterday today and forever
[31:11] and I began to pray
[31:15] a precious friend calls me to invite me
[31:20] to go eat to stay at a hotel
[31:25] that's great but
[31:27] until guys
[31:33] I was not going to leave my house
[31:36] I needed God to speak
[31:39] I needed to be guided
[31:42] I needed to know the will of God
[31:46] we're the precious people in El Paso
[31:52] the price of the cross
[32:01] and it wasn't until Sunday morning
[32:07] God in his grace had pleased him to show
[32:10] me
[32:11] what his will was
[32:15] and when you do the will when
[32:18] you were a Son of God
[32:21] you have been called
[32:23] not to do your way
[32:26] but to do God's will yes
[32:30] which is uh it is wholly acceptable and
[32:34] it's perfect
[32:35] when I stood up there
[32:38] I could tell the people
[32:43] how the Holy Spirit was going to begin
[32:45] to minister
[32:47] and it was a Revival
[32:49] now a Revival it is
[32:56] not to dance
[33:00] those are the results
[33:11] be reconnected
[33:16] and the tears Begin to Fall
[33:19] that is a Revival
[33:22] the price of the cross
[33:30] the Holy Spirit begins to call out
[33:33] diseases
[34:05] this morning
[34:08] Holy Spirit showed me
[34:42] how did they get there
[34:51] these men these climbers
[34:57] they climb Mount these mountains
[35:02] and sometimes they reach a place a point
[35:06] where they can't go forward
[35:09] they can't but they're going to die pero
[35:37] from the price of the cross
[35:43] when I saw this scene
[35:47] I said how did they get there
[35:50] by their decision
[35:52] and I remembered
[35:58] they interviewed a very famous man
[36:00] yesterday
[36:02] I'm going around
[36:09] he said friend
[36:12] like flowers what is the key to your
[36:15] success
[36:16] the people were awaiting something great
[36:19] and he just says
[36:24] good decisions
[36:28] all of you well that's obvious
[36:31] if there would have been bad decisions
[36:37] they were good decisions
[36:48] and he still speaks
[36:52] through his through his son
[36:58] tells me
[37:14] of his church
[37:16] amen
[37:20] but there's people that live
[37:25] as repel did not exist
[37:28] I'm speaking to Christians hey
[37:31] cristianos there's Christians that live
[37:37] as if hell was something that was not in
[37:39] the bible
[37:40] let me tell you
[37:44] it's so real
[37:48] when he was here
[37:50] more about hell and about heaven
[38:30] took me to these Caverns that are below
[38:32] the Earth
[39:05] that you cannot go out
[39:30] out of these demons
[39:43] what were they planning
[39:47] is
[40:47] when I was a child
[40:51] acted like a child yeah
[40:54] and I did the things of a child
[40:59] now that I've left the things
[41:02] now that I'm a man
[41:05] when we're children Brothers
[41:07] you know the children
[41:11] you let the children lose
[41:26] you can't tell them come over here
[41:28] because they don't understand their
[41:29] children
[41:30] your children
[41:32] they fight
[41:36] because they're children
[41:39] the children
[41:41] they suffer with Envy
[41:45] Caleb
[42:24] we're going to find when when you go to
[42:26] when we go to Poland
[42:27] and this is what Satan is going to do
[42:29] this is his plan
[42:32] we have to pray we have to pass
[42:36] to counteract his plan but
[42:40] let me tell you Caleb okay
[42:45] well demand from us
[42:49] a spiritual maturity
[43:01] of God in Holiness
[43:02] so they never
[43:05] will you criticize
[43:11] I saw people
[43:15] they need a miracles
[43:19] look brother
[43:22] I've never spoken these things
[43:27] and if you suddenly hear me speaking
[43:30] them today and you're a child
[43:36] you're putting yourself in a position
[43:43] you're being inspired
[43:46] to know yes
[43:48] that if God speaks
[43:50] [Music]
[43:53] and you have a right to know
[43:58] and the will of God for your life
[44:04] the price of the cross
[44:08] do you know why we act this way
[44:11] Joe B I saw I said three months back
[44:17] I saw the revivalists that the bride is
[44:21] is waiting for
[44:23] eign
[44:24] I speak what I see
[44:26] I saw it
[44:28] when I saw it
[44:33] Carlos when I saw this I
[44:36] I
[44:41] saw this flame burn in this house
[44:45] and I said we need to call the
[44:47] firefighters there was no firefighter
[44:52] and I said why isn't it burning
[44:55] why doesn't this house burn
[44:58] when I put my hand
[45:00] it didn't burn
[45:06] a Revival
[45:08] when I understood
[45:37] there's no demon in hell
[45:40] that can turn
[45:42] It Off
[45:45] three times
[45:48] that I've been living here in the United
[45:50] States
[45:53] three times
[45:55] one time in Colombia four times
[45:59] but here I am
[46:03] because I've been able to tell the devil
[46:05] yes
[46:07] until God uh ends with my life
[46:11] I'm going to stand for God
[46:17] when I stand for you
[46:20] for years
[46:26] that's my life
[46:29] the price of the Cross you know brother
[46:36] when my pastor told me I want you to go
[46:38] to Tucson

[46:44] because a year ago I was there
[46:47] when I was at the hotel Henry for the
[46:50] Henry
[46:51] I was in a hotel there in Tucson
[46:55] the the principle
[46:58] uh diabolic
[47:00] that governs uh Tucson
[47:05] that devil visited me in in the at the
[47:08] hotel
[47:10] and I could discern him
[47:13] I could I knew how he acted
[47:16] is
[47:20] something terrible to be there you don't
[47:22] want to have those kinds of experiences
