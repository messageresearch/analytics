[Music] [Music] do [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] so [Music] in this series of episodes i would like to relate to you the things that i saw the things that i heard and the things which i experienced the purpose of these episodes is to acquaint you with the supernatural that's very essential to acquaint you with the supernatural which god did in and through the ministry of william branham and how god continues that's what's very significant how god continues to produce the supernatural through the ministry even to this present time proving that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and that's the key believing that this jesus christ who spoke and who was recorded in the in the bible and that jesus of the old testament or god of the old testament is jesus of the new and we have the holy spirit today it's the same god in all of those events and it shall come to pass the scripture says if they will not believe thee god speaking to moses neither hearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the voice of the latter sign and if the supernatural doesn't have a voice that follows it a voice that reveals jesus christ to the people [Music] but ye shall see me who the believers for i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world is that true that is sin to disbelieve strictly stranger to me you're from away from here you come from another city you've got a lot of trouble on your heart you got hard trouble to begin with is that right there's a whole lot of blackness i see a black sheep keep following you like that oh it's alive somebody stole the line and that was a man was professing divine healing he said you as a witch is that true and if you've got a whole stir in your church or something about it in that right your pastor's sick right now you got polio is that right sister don't pay attention what them people tell you they're alive and the only thing's wrong with your heart that nervous condition got your heart worked up gone home in peace and god bless you you're all god that has created the heavens and earth i ask now that every demon power in this building will be broke the power of jesus christ be made manifest lord we but we're not defeated satan observe thee in the name of the lord jesus christ come out of the people stand up you crippled people out of the wheelchairs giving praise in psalms god spoke through david and he said lo he doth send his voice and that a mighty voice jesus when he came and there was god in christ reconciling the world to himself jesus said my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me that just couldn't be clearer my sheep know my voice i know them and they follow me and then speaking of the voice that would come in this last time but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared it to his servants of prophets we say what is this mystery it is so that the voice will be in the bride so the prophet of god has said god raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until this last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age and we can quote the words of jesus when he said it is not you that speak but the spirit of your father which speaketh in you and if all believers of this message would take those words that i've just spoken concerning it's always been the voice revealing the almighty god to us and to realize it's not just something that we heard and we received this is what has connected the same bible i don't read another bible but the same bible has just become alive and the opening of the word the opening of the scriptures things that we could not see or understand have become so clear and this is our great ambition to make this known and furthermore i would like to advise anyone regardless of what you have heard er regardless of what you've heard positive or negative i can tell you that i would recommend to you to do the same thing that i did if the angel of the lord was at the platform and i am a witness of these things i was there i saw it on the platform i saw it as the prophet of god spoke to the people and i knew the people some of them were from my church and i knew that the angel of the lord would not use a human vessel to speak things that were not true it had to be absolutely true and god is a god of truth and it speaks of jesus christ he was full of truth and grace and i can say that in the revealing of himself it was absolutely true until you have somebody that can stand in the public year after year after year for many years and reveal the secret of the heart only god can do that tell where the people were tell them where they were standing tell them what they're suffering with tell them whether they'll live or they'll die i mean that kind of a that kind of a voice is the voice that i want to hear and follow and that's the voice that a person will hear long after this life is over that's the voice that's the voice of almighty god and i can tell you that that is what i experienced and it is true [Music] [Music] [Music] one day my father he was about 18 at the time and he was plowing a field in saskatchewan he was plowing behind the horses and the furrow he was walking in the fresh furrow and he doesn't know what happened but it was he said it was like a wind i would say like a force like i experienced within brother branham's ministry but this force struck him and he fell to his knees and in the fresh furrow and he threw up his hands to god and he prayed and he cried out he said oh god if there is a god now he's an older boy in the church but he cried out oh god if there is a god if you ever show me how i can be free from my guilt my sin i'll accept you that very day [Music] my father farmed for a short time near his father's farm and it wasn't working out he didn't feel cut out to farm so they moved he and his young wife and young family i was only about two years old and they moved up to a small village only about 150 people i think a village called white fox saskatchewan and it was there i'll just make this a little more brief but it was there that my father encountered a family with two daughters with two girls he had seen these girls walk across the street a little gravel street in the town and he saw on their faces they looked just like angels he thought oh my if i could only have what they have so there was a craving in his heart for reality for deliverance from sin and unbelief and so on and he wanted something more than religion of course a lady in the town heard that he could do some carpenter work so she would needed some shelving or cupboards in her kitchen and had him come over and look at what she wanted done when he was in the house he noticed there's the two girls and as he was getting ready to go the lady asked him if he had ever been saved and he said well i don't know what that means she said that means you can be free from your sin oh he said if i could only be free from my sin she said well we are having meetings in a home on sunday if you'd care to come and she and he said i had promised god years ago if i ever could be free from my guilt i would accept it that very day and as i understand the account she just they knelt at two chairs in that kitchen of that home where those two girls were and my father was he got up a totally transformed person he lived for christ all of his life and he had a matter of fact it was then my mother passed away suddenly when i was only six and a half years old i was in grade two at school and a very godly man i think he was probably an old farmer but he was a very godly man and i was called out of the room and my sister was standing with him and he said that jesus had taken my mother to heaven and this was this was the beginning and the end of many things it was it's a very very difficult and very sad story my sister and i we went through from one housekeeper to another to another about four different housekeepers and we had time we were alone and my father was working in an alfalfa plant cleaning the bags and so on and we would try to make something to eat and go up there and then my father heard of a lot of work that was taking place in dawson creek and the building of the alaskan highway just prior to that my father had remarried a very fine christian woman but she was completely opposite of what my mother my mother was a very a very loving mother and not that this one wasn't but we weren't her children and she was very quiet my mother was outgoing and very you know uh just very outgoing and this woman was anna leland was her name and she was just a very quiet woman so anyhow our life was completely rearranged and my father went over about a thousand miles west to dawson creek and up the alaskan highway he was there were camps built all over the highway and you have to understand that the alaskan highway was a war project the japanese were invading up the aleutian islands had already taken over two of the islands and there's even i understand there's documentaries where the japanese had taken atu attu atu island and that was the thrust if they took alaska and then northern canada was really not defended and then if they got down to the 48 states it would it would uh a risk japan was fighting and they had seized much of asia and now into china as well singapore and hong kong they'd taken all of that and now if they took they were a powerful force and if they came down to the 48 states of mainland america so canada and the united states joined together and the u.s built the highway and canada agreed to maintain it forever and then there would be a land route to get heavy equipment tanks and war equipment into alaska to defend it that's the purpose of the alaskan highway and there were tens of thousands of people and contractors and civilians that were involved in that and so my father moved up there and he was at mile 458. he wrote back and communicated with my stepmother to pack everything up and to come out and we arrived in dawson creek at the end of may i won't say perhaps the first of may because my sister whose birthday is may the sixth she had her birthday on the train coming from edmonton to into dawson creek and while we were there uh this has all happened in you know after my mother passed away everything is just in a turmoil everything fell apart and then i found myself i was sent out to a farm 45 miles out of town across the mighty peace river or with a tug boat and a little ferry and to people that i didn't know and my the last string i had on earth was my sister and she was she was taken to a place uh and because the pastor's wife had been arranged to find a place for the two children and my mother already had work up the alaskan highway so i didn't have a mother i didn't have a stepmother i didn't have a sister and one is sent one place one and sent another place and i was shifted i never had a home all my all my youth and growing up years i never had my own room never had my own bed and i moved 17 times from then until the time i was 15. [Music] so it was a it's a difficult time of my life but i've been asked what prepared you for the mission work and for this gospel it was those years i learned what the wilderness was little did i realize that years later i would have god's prophet up there and he loved that area and it was wilderness and that's all i knew really so uh my father then in 1949 he felt to move to southern british columbia and on the way down he would stop because he would had such a experience with god and was interested in anything that god was doing in fact is he stopped in the meetings and he had heard that william branham was going to be in vernon british columbia and that is where my contact began with him uh in fact is i have a letter i should perhaps just read this letter on just a portion of this is my father's account of the meetings in vernon we found this i think after my father passed away in his things and he's writing a minister and he's writing about the news of our beloved brother branham passing away he said came as a with a shocking surprise to me the loss of him cannot be estimated in words now he is resting in peace but his work is going on and his memory is cherished in the hearts of thousands in the world but he was writing about the meeting in vernon british columbia that was my first time finally he said brother branham looked at a poorly clad mother with a crippled child in her arms he asked that the way be made for this poor mother to come forward never had i ever seen such a bundle of twisted bones thought this was a totally impossible case brother branham took the child in his arms and lifted it up for the people to see it there were tears and moans and sobs heard all around the place then he said people do you see how the demons have twisted the whole body of this child and are holding it bound i will not let this child go until all these demons are cast out and the child is perfectly whole with great authority he commanded the demons to come to come out of out in jesus name after several commands the demons came out and before the eyes of that great crowd the bones were made straight his arms legs neck and back all became straight and the child lifted himself up with a smile on its face you should have heard the the arena or the arena ring with their praises of thousands as they saw the mighty miracles of god done in the name of jesus christ praise god forever now that's my father's unsolicited but he did not know what was happening to me i was just with a series of young fellows that's where i first met billy paul in fact and we were in our teens and i was i was caught by this [Music] that brother branham was a man that had talked to an angel and an angel had come to him and told him he would take a ministry of healing now i was familiar with sunday school with church i knew the bible spoke of angels i had never ever laid eyes on a person who had talked to god in that way talk to an angel of god and so i was anxious to see him come out and he came out said good evening people good evening friends and he began to speak and after two or three days i felt i've got to get down where i can see this i'm i'm i had no interest in being up in the high in the bleachers anymore i didn't have any more interest in just being with the fellas and i got a seat i don't know how to this day i got a seat right on the aisle one chair just close two or three rolls from the front and in that service i can't tell you what was spoken i can't tell you of anyone else but there was a girl and i would say the girl was probably around 10 to 12 years old she had ringlets down to her shoulders and kind of a full face girl but her eyes were just white balls and i noticed right up i was that close to the platform i i just right in the corner of the eye i see just a little a part a little part of the ball the ball of the eye the edge of the eye and the other eye i could see nothing just white and i was as far as i was concerned and and she was totally blind brother branham laid his hands on her and he prayed a prayer and i thought in my young heart i thought well i've heard about you know these things now now here's something i can actually see i can see this and i was anxious to see someone healed because i had had so many experiences in churches and so on where people were prayed for for internal sicknesses and you're healed but now there's something i could see visibly and brother branham prayed the second time and she was the same and he prayed the third time fourth time fifth time and he keep looking at her and she was the same brother branham prayed six times and he did something i have never and prayed a prayer i've never heard before and he he took and put his arms around her like that and just kind of held her to his bosom and he said satan an angel from god had delivered this gift to me and told me that nothing would stand before my prayers not even cancer if i could get the people to believe he said the people are here and they believe and i charge you in the name of the living god to lose her and let her go and that time he did not look at her anymore he just turned her took her by the shoulders and turned her to the audience and i was just two three rows away i i think i was in the third row and i looked up and her eyes were as straight as mine and then he lifted her up like this and the cries of the people i didn't know that my mother and dad or my stepmother and dad were in there where they were in the building but that was my experience this was my father's experience and and i i could even see the tears form in her eyes as she looked at the bright lights she wasn't accustomed to the bright lights and she's looking at the bright lights and then he put her down and that anchored in my heart at 14 years old [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] there was a time of my life i was separated from everything including the young lady that i thought i might marry i didn't know but i was god it was about eight months long and during that eight months i had a very very unusual walk with god i guess i would say very unusual i had a room and i worked in a store right below and the hudson's bay had bought out my father-in-law uh he became my father-in-law but he was just the owner and uh i i was working in the i was manager of the produce department and when when noon time came i would go up to my room and give the first half hour of my lunch time in prayer and it was just something very special it isn't something that i advise others or admonish them it was just something that i just did i i longed for it i craved for it i even you know would pinch in the moment so i could be longer there and i would slide out the other chair for the lord jesus to sit on and be there and uh when when the work was over i would sometimes go out and walk in the woods or walking around the creek and just look at the flowers or something and just be overwhelmed at the beauty of it and weep and so that was the kind of experience we had and then god was moving in such a way that denominations was nothing it was the people you know if there was a hunger and a desire for god and we under we heard that there was a meeting or i had heard that there was a meeting taking place in northern alberta and it was about 300 350 miles from where we were and i waited until when work was over on friday and then i took off on my motorcycle that was the only truck only transportation i had and it was cold and i was suffering from hypothermia i didn't know it but i was and i went till about two o'clock in the morning and then i would see a farm light flicker you know way in the distance and i thought oh my goodness i've always was so bashful to do that and then there was one right beside the road a little log house and so i pulled in there real quick it was in the middle of the night and the light was on and i leaned my bike up against the log house and i tapped on the door and i just heard some voice inside come on in so i opened the door and there was a guy with his feet up on a table reading a book and so i said well i said i'm just pulling up and i was very cold and was almost freezing to death and oh he said yeah i said i thought maybe i could bunk here for the night yeah he said you can have a room here and he was a bachelor made a big breakfast in the morning and then i set off the next day and then it snowed that night and so in the afternoon then the sun was coming out and people were splashing you know spraying me with [Music] wet snow and water and so on but i did that to get to a meeting and it was in that meeting that you know god confirmed that god had given me the young woman who was my wife to be my wife and i was feeling a call i guess and i can't identify what the call was i think it evolved into [Music] you know when i began to speak to my wife and we were actually riding in a car and then i'll go back and i said well i wanted her to know i would not be able to give her the kind of life that she knew and that she's experienced and that she's had with her father being a businessman and being in business and so on i said i can't give you that kind of life i said i've been called to preach and that's probably the first time i said that to her i've been called to preach so i think that now in retrospect i was i was feeling that pull i i i didn't you know we didn't have the example of someone behind the pulpit and someone preaching but it was just a deep hunger for greater things of god and the life that god had for you know what there was you know available and so i was actually frustrated on the bed [Music] and i was in great sobs uh you know just exposing my soul to god and i didn't know what to do i remember taking off my watch and i put it on the bed and i took my billfold out and i put those on the bed and i just surrendered it to god i said my time and what he put in my hands was going to be his and i can't i can't describe any special extended thing from that but i think god sees that and then he just sets your life in a certain course and allows certain things to happen and and he knows that blessings are not going to upset you or they're not going to drive you in a wrong direction you you handle that you and then you you become a trustworthy steward of the things of the kingdom of god god has to have people that can handle funds can handle business the gospel itself is not it's not something that is conducted on you know god can take little money and he can take much so yeah i just it was something i experienced that was before we were married [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i was pastoring been pastoring three and a half years and i was kind of filled with i won't say disillusionment but it was we didn't know you know i had good friends that were trinitarians and good friends which were jesus only and we didn't seem to put a lot of importance to it because no one could answer it and then i had heard that you know brother branham was now speaking some things and i had huge huge questions about it but one day just one day one meeting i happened to have my friend bud southwick and he always stayed in our house in dawson creek and a.w rasmussen who used to pastor in edmonton and then he pastored into coma and he was a very very dear friend of brother from chicago and that whole community was a very close community and so he said to me he was in my home that one time just once and brother rasmussen said brother eddie why don't you write brother branham and invite him to go on a hunt he said you know perhaps then you could have some meetings as well he said he loves to hunt you know and so that was just enough to nudge me forward and i wrote brother branham i remember writing him a letter and while i wrote the letter my mind was telling me you'll never hear from him he probably gets a hundred thousand letters a month and i thought well this is this just doesn't make sense anyway i wrote and i posted the letter in dawson creek and right after that i had resigned the church and came down here to the west coast of british columbia about 800 miles south and started to minister to the native indian people and about three weeks later i got a phone call a letter from brother branham saying that he'd like to go on a hunt and perhaps we could have some meetings in grand prairie and dawson creek thus that tied those meetings and we arranged those meetings and and i had all these questions about the ministry about the absolute as or is there some definitive absolute on the godhead and on the baptism and oh my how the word opened up then and i uh so that's why when i was on the platform and i say to you i was there and i found that what he spoke was the truth but yet my heart had some big questions in it but i see the soldier boy has called out and set the clone disk people from my church are called out and he relates exactly things that i know are taking place in their homes and here now i'm with him and driving up the alaskan highway to the hunting territory and this is where everything changed because i was one day i i actually went on the hunting trip to keep the cost down i was doing the cooking and uh so one one of the evenings brother branham just said i think i'll just go out and maybe get a rabbit or something for camp meat and he said would you like to come brother eddie i said yes i would like to come and brother chris berg who was a dear friend of brother branham's he said yeah maybe i'll come too sure brother brown said why don't you come brother chris no he said i'm gonna stay and do the dishes he said you go brother eddie we were camping so we walk along brother brown and i on a path [Music] walk a short distance [Music] and i could see he wasn't really interested in it was a beautiful evening he wasn't interested in hunting i wasn't it at all interested and he walked over and a short distance and just sat on a big log and i sat right beside him and our knees were almost touching and so i i wanted to ask a question i have to listen very closely now i was curious why all this manifestation which was so powerful and so real and how the basic element of it could deteriorate and i just i couldn't understand it and that's why i was so disillusioned i thought something's wrong something's wrong so i said to brother branham i said how is it that people can prophesy they can speak in tongues they can interpret operate the gift of the spirit can preach and they become so anointed and i said i know what the anointing is and brother branham said have you heard my service on false anointed ones and i kind of dropped my head because i had not heard a lot of tapes and i said oh no i'm i haven't heard that you know what the strange thing was brother branham hadn't preached that for five years yet it was five years later that he would preach that service false anointed ones but he said to me he said now the wheat and the tares grow in the same field he said you tell me what the wheat rejoiced in and i'll tell you what the tares rejoiced in and i said yeah i still wasn't getting it he said in the last days peter said in the last days i'll pour my spirit upon all flesh and he asked me about all and i said all flesh he said a-l-l but he said not all flesh is saved [Music] i said yeah i was beginning to see that there was there was a point here that he was making yeah and then when he got to the wheat and the tares i begin to see and then he said you know like my sheep hear my voice not all my shape not all or my shape and i begin to see uh yeah there was something i really he said they're anointed they're genuinely anointed but the wrong seed and i begin to see that that's clearly taught in the scriptures i would like to say to the people who hear this i met the master i didn't meet just william branham him i knew but i met the master the god that he served and he said i was riding on my horse this afternoon behind brother bud and the sun was warm and i believe he said that you have three questions you want to ask me that's exactly the truth my heart was just completely exposed he said the first one is on the baptism and he took him in the order they were in my heart and the serpent seat i didn't even want to discuss but he said the first one is the baptism the second one is the godhead and the third one is the serpent's seed and i knew that if he avoided the scripture or you know just avoided that scripture i knew the word of god was the absolute but i didn't understand it and when he said the serpent's seat i said but brother branham i was so wound up i ra i raised my finger i'm not in his disrespect i just raised my finger i said but the scripture says and adam knew his wife and she conceived call his name cain for i've received a man from the lord he said course is from the lord all life comes from god it doesn't matter whether it's a right relationship or wrong relationship all life comes from god and i said yeah he said but you need to read the next verse i didn't know what the next verse was and she again bear his brother abel he said they were twins that's when i knew i'd missed something they were twins he said they've always been twins cain and abel isaac and ishmael jacob and esau he said at calvary there wasn't three that died it was four well that was new and he had his hand up like that he said jesus and judas jesus and one thief and judas and the other thief and he went like that and he said they each took one his way jesus took one thief to heaven and judas the son of perdition took one his way and then i realized it said then there were the antichrist in christ christ an antichrist every every revival bears twins and i could understand what was happening and what i was disillusioned about i knew one thing that my heart had been exposed and i was like naked before god [Music] and uh there was nothing hidden with god and that's the way it was with the people on the platform that's why he asked not hundreds thousands and thousands is that true is that true it was always true not one time in all of the lives in all of the years of ministry not one time did anyone say no that's not true it was always true and that's why it was the spirit of truth and that was the spirit of truth coming to me and i can say that all my questions were answered and have been answered by the word ever since [Music] and that is the truth and one thing i can say i met him on the log i met the god that the woman at the well met saying lord jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] to him [Music] [Music] you
