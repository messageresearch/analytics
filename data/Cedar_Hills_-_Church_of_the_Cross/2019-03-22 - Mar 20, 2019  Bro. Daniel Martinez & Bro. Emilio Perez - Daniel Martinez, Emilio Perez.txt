that our sister spring wanted us to hear think about his love think about his goodness that's brought us through for as high as the heavens above so great is the measure of Our Father's Love In the Year 2007 a group of deep sea divers discovered a fale octopus clinging to the rocky ledge of a Canyon located 4,600 ft below the ocean surface she was guarding 160 minut milky teardrops cemented to the Rock her eggs her children for the female octopus laying eggs marks the Glorious beginning of an inevitable end she covers them defends them them Wass currents of water so they continuously have fresh oxygenated water the deep sea divers watched her for 53 months and for 53 months she remained brooding over her young never leaving their side never even taking a moment to eat in 2011 the deep sea divers found that her eggs had successfully hatched leaving their empty capsules the husks of what they once were behind her body was not to be found that that Constance that determination that persistence that is the love of a true mother and as our Prophet has said if the love of a mother will do that what will the love of God do the love of God sent his son to suffer to unfold as a sacrifice for me for you the love of God saw me at my rock bottom and said you I Choose You Always Forever the love of God steadfastly says I have beg Something Beautiful In You and I will be faithful so faithful to finish it the love of God in our hearts makes us his children so much more than conquerors so much more than AEL so much more than alive the love of God is unfathomable immeasurable it is deep it is wide it is great so great and forever forever I will sing great is the measure of Our Father's [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Love [Music] amen amen PE that's brought us [Applause] through for as high as the heavens above so great is the measure of Our Father's Love great is the measure of Our Father's Love think about his love think about his love think about his goodness think about his great that's brought us through for as high as the heavens above so great is the measure of Our Father's Love great is the measure of our father's love once again think about his love think about his goodness think about his grace that's brought us through for as high as the heavens above so great is the measure of Our Father's Love great is the measure of our father's [Music] love God bless you this evening how many are happy to be here tired but we're here nervous but we're here let us uh just right quick turn to Matthew 2626 and and as they they were eating Jesus Took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples and said take ye this is my body I'm going to repeat this one more time just this part it and he break it let us pray heavenly father as we give you thanks tonight for another day of life giving us Lord thank you for being our provider we ask that you put me to a side Lord there's nothing good in me that could help your people Lord but if you speak to your people Lord it'll be a great help we thank you and we love you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be SE I just want to speak a little bit tonight have you all ever um allowed God to maybe you've been broken in life maybe with physic physically spiritually have you ever allowed God to break you sometimes you know that's the only way when you go through a trial that's the only way God will move if you if you have a trial sometimes we want handouts and and it's not always that way and if you notice the scripture say that he blessed it and then he broke it sometimes God will bless you and then he'll break you into pieces if you want to be multiplied let them break you a little bit you might said why am I going through these trials he broke those five loaves of bread when that little kid was walking by he said what do you have that there in your lunch boox he goes well I have fish and bread for one little kid he multiplied 5,000 so I could just imagine when that kid got home and the mom opens the lunch box but mine will always be empty and he goes well we just say his name is John goes what happened how come you didn't eat your lunch at school mom if you only knew what happened but sometimes we go through a lot of Trials we become real deep thinkers and then all of a sudden we have a nervous breakdown because we become so great thinkers and that's why the devil has us or sometimes we think it's him we want a testimony but we don't want to test we won't compromise with nothing you know we got to stand for God's word we cannot stagger nowhere we cannot be uh just doing whatever we want and then you read in job 22 I like this part and the Lord said unto Satan from whence comest thou and Satan answered Lord and said Lord tell Satan where have you been oh I just been to and fro here in the earth walking up and down up and down did you know God is the one was the one that picked the fight for him andtime God will pick a fight for you have you considered my bride over here lastas and he'll will pick a fight for you and sometimes we think oh well the devil maybe do this but sometimes we don't understand that God is permitting things God is the one that's doing this because he has confidence in you that you can withstand the trial you know as I was reading um the other day in Matthew 26:39 when it says father if it is possible let this cup pass before me but nevertheless not not as I my will but let thy will be done now if Jesus wouldn't have finished that sentence if you would have have said thy will you and I we wouldn't be here so we got to thank the Lord for that sacrifice that he made for you know God will Crown you at your weakest moment when you are tired and weary when you endureth all temptation and that's when he will you will receive the crown of life that change your body my question what is a trial is trying and testing claims that are made causing a person to prove their claim so faith that is never been tested cannot prove its claim so you have to be certain of God he loves to put your he loves to put your faith in action he will test you to see how you're going to react and sometimes we don't react too good sometimes I don't react too good because I let my flesh get in the way now you could do faith will make you do great Miracles and still doesn't come from a spiritual heart your your actions prove what you are no I was um reading the the sculpture Michelangelo mangelo of Moses for many years he was building this image or this sculpture trials sweat tears everything was criticized people tell him all kinds of stuff I imagine he had a vision Paul says we don't have vision people perish so he had a vision when he made this sculpture when he finished that he said this is perfect it's a masterpiece was so perfect but what made it perfect as a masterpiece brother bham said on his right above his right knee s Ines he struck it he hit it with a hammer and he said speak it was so perfect but brother bam said what made it a a masterpiece it was a flaw that the part where you hit it with a hammer he wanted to speak many times we go through a lot of Trials we don't have no job we don't have we're sick financial problems uh uh uh uh and all of a sudden we get hit by that and that's a trial what makes you so perfect right now what makes you a masterpiece you are a masterpiece you might say oh no I'm not cuz you're looking at the flesh it's your flaw your mistakes where you've been hit in life that is what makes you perfect you're the Masterpiece in God's eyes he just sees the blood over you it's the blood that covers Us that overshadow Mary it'll cover you too it will overshadow you let it be according to Thy word sometimes uh we go through we meet a lot of challenges in life you are predestinated to meet the challenge of this AG the Bible talks about Jesus about Jesus coming about his coming but the same thing it talks about your coming also we will not bow to any spirit or any any devil because we are people of Victory it's your position it's your anointing don't let the devil take it away from you what's inside of you is greater greater see that is in you he that is in the world it's not greater in you that's in you it's greater is he that is in you you know and U I was reading here in uh in James 122 be doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves sometimes times we just are hearers of the word but we're not doers of the word and that causes problems brother brandham says that we are U that he will write this Trail again he didn't say I he said we we will do it and that's what we're doing now bringing forth the message bringing the word out in its fullness that's what we're doing now that's why we are here we are listening to the messages and and that's why we're doing eating the word it's when you read the message you hear the tapes it's dead to us until it comes Liv in us that's the only way God will manifest himself you got to bring that dead letter out of the book book bring it inside of you you you might say well I'm not worthy of that you have 10,000 losses but you're still an overcomer you're not a failer you know the Lord will help us through the battle over and over and the and the Lord will tell you now it's your turn it's like when you go to school the teacher you you you go to school for a whole year the teacher is helping you through the through those courses he's there watching you helping you at until the end of the year you have to do an exam and you're by yourself that's the way God is God is helping you through the road and he'll say Daniel I have confidence to you let's see what you can do and sometimes we get exhausted fatigue we we get tired you know and I know we all go through battles go through trials tribulations you got to remember one thing it's not you getting the victory it is God getting the victory you're not using God to get your Victory God is using you to get his victory the battle's not yours it belongs to God all you have to do is show up you know I was reading our brother bham he says this I really like this God's covenant with Abra paragraph 34 now watch Jesus he could have used his power but he did it he used his word he said it is written know he was so calm but whenever I have an issue or problem we want to start yelling right away but if he was so calm it is written men shall not live by bread alone but but every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and this is the part that really stood out to me and he stood there three times defeated Satan all three times three is a confirmation of a witness and brother says amen he defeated Satan on his own ground with the word of God though now this is right here it really it really hit me the weakest Christian here tonight can defeat Satan anywhere any place any time under any any condition and he said it's thus sayth the Lord what else do we worry about why do why why do I worry I got to get rid of my complex but if I to dominate me I will never I can't never walk I can't never get ahead in life there's another one here that says when you bringing conferences paragraph 148 sometimes we think it's the devil but it's not the devil all the time when he come back out bringing the children of Israel out to the promised land right right in the path of Duty lay theed see it's strange it's strange that God will lead his children right into traps sometimes in wheelchairs sometimes in heart attacks sometimes he leads his children why to see how they're going to react to see a reaction and that's how that's what what happens we try to run we see an obstacle we want to run the opposite way but tonight we have the devil on the Run we have the God in the midst of the battle right now you come to church sick tired problems and but we made it you said well I don't know what's my position I don't know what be here and in church praising the Lord hearing the message that's your position living a Christian Life you know what gets the devil mad when you ask God for something he doesn't give it to you but yet you can still praise the Lord and that's what gets the devil man you know sometimes we we ask the lord well Lord I've done everything right I met the requ requirements why why how come you haven't blessed me why I I've done everything I lived a Christian Life the trial of your faith is more precious than silver and gold and we see that maybe we ask God for I don't know a a car or a house or whatever it is you asked God for for something in your life God will give it to you Abraham waited 25 years God will give it to you be still and know that I am God sometimes we don't realize I got patience wear out we get moody we get exhausted we react different and I could be the first one to raise my hand but we are still the Royal seed of ab there's nothing that could change the bride of Christ only God could do that to us and if you've been blessed and you feel like you're broken into pieces it's because those little pieces it's because you're helping somebody else even though you're going through a trial that's a paradox you might not know this you might be helping somebody else and you don't even know a paradox is brother BR said is something that's true incredible but it's true but you're helping somebody else maybe you you don't have your son here in church your children your father your mother your husband your wife but it it says in the Bible you and your off offsprings will be there don't don't never forget that so we go through problems that's all right it's just God is breaking you two pieces and he's multiplying you and what happened that's the case with a the prodical son his father gave him the inheritance money he went to the world he spent it all we all know the story right I've said this before but if you look at the story the father you might say it was his fault in a way it was his fault he was praying to God he said God I want my son to come back home so I gave him the money I want him to spend all the money right away so what he did he let the economy of Las crues go down just to save one soul and he will do that to your family God God will take care of them for you but I just want to thank you tonight just a little little short talk I had I just want to share that with you remember more loyal more testing God bless [Applause] you God bless you this evening God bless brother Daniel we are as a people of God tonight we're thankful when they speak to us about trials I was just being rejoicing just to see how our brother was talking when we were singing back there on the television brother Daniel was was so nervous back there and he said if he might just preach 15 minutes he did such a good job I like it when they speak about trials and when one is broken as our brother Daniel was speaking I like it when they speak on those subjects because when you are broken you cannot get that fragrance out of the Rose unless you crush that Rose if it's not broken in this age that we live it it's so easy to be become broken if you accept to follow the lord if you don't want want to follow the lord God bless the brothers that are visiting us tonight if you decide to follow the Lord in this day that we live it's you have that propensity that you're going to be broken you're going to be broken you're going to be crushed the way the world is in this day if you just aren't careful just for a little bit and You Begin to Fall in Love with the things of this world that's the problem we have in this day we love so much the things of this day we love our houses so much we love our cars our our jobs the school and education all that is necessary and we're going to make emphasis that all that is needed but don't get a hold of your job that your life depends on it that your Eternal destination would depend on that the same thing with your house don't get a hold of your house in such a way as if your eternal life depended on on it sooner or later God's going to make you be accountable for it because if you're such got a hold on the things of this life that means you're not hold of God over here the the problem we have in this age let's read our scripture Revelation chapter three we're going to see that the condition of this age it's such a sad condition chapter 3 verse 13 let's go all the way to 17 to save a little time 3 17 it begins to hear to speak about the age of this church because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and I have need of nothing and knowest not that thou are wretched miserable and poor and blind and naked it's not just one thing here it's like five things here you know that's not the worst of it that's not the worst of this age because we have become so rich in this age and we have gotten such a hold on things in this world that we forget that this world is not our kingdom is not of this world we we get a hold of the things that are around us it's like if we nail down a piece of metal and nobody's going to move us from there but our kingdom is not of this Earth of this world my kingdom is not of here I I remember every day when I go to cut hair or when I go to cut my hair I know many of you do the same every time I go up to the the mirror I see less hair every morning where I go and take a pill I remember that I'm not of here then why do I want to be such a whole things that have me bound to this earth when I'm not I'm not from here I don't want to be a person that becomes rich and then I don't want to hear what God has to say but this is that the age of it the people of this age I'm speaking there's Christian people there's a Christian people there are programs in their churches and systems and programs in their churches they have them so busy they have them so enriched that they don't realize that they are naked and that's the worst part about it they don't know it that's the age that we live in this is why I would like to turn the corner just a little bit we have a mixed audience here and because of the love we have for Souls you know the God of this Our God sent us a prophet in this day in our day he sent Elijah the prophet and that was a promise Brothers God promised that in our day he was going to dress us he he brought the dress and we that we should be dressed with the word that's the promise we don't want to be found naked we don't want to be found blind then why don't we get dressed we don't want to be done like that that because we haven't gotten dressed amen Elijah came and he brought all the truth do not the scriptures say the disciples began to ask Jesus why did the scripes says that that Elijah must first come and Jesus said yes it's NE necessary that he come he's going to guide us to all the truth in our day Brothers what we the people need is to to become so saturated but the the message of Elijah it's the only thing it's going to take the scales off of our eyes and we won't be just going around trying to feel our way around where I work I speak PE with a people and and the people they struggle so much and then I think how blessed I am where God has placed me what God has given me then I begin to remember Israel God gave Wells to Israel that they didn't even dig them he gave them food that they thought that they weren't going to even be able to eat but before the foundation of the world he remembered me he thought of me and he put us in this day where I would be able to receive Elijah I was going to receive that food this nation this is the Most Blessed nation that God has given us where God has placed us not only in what we see but what God has raised up here God raised up Elijah the prophet I was able to receive this message from the time that I was a child I began to hear this message I have been so privileged like that all these young people you're are so privileged you don't know what it's like to be out there roaming around in the dark without a pilot to guide you let me tell you it's so sad to see the people like that but the world today they're having such an Amnesia attack of am they have an attack of Amnesia because they have lost their identity they're not tied down to anything the same thing that happened to Nebuchadnezzar he had everything at at his disposal but he had gotten so rich he forgot where all these blessings had come from this nation has forgot where all these blessings have come from Nebuchadnezzar he he got amnesia he had time to repent but he didn't repent then what happened then his heart was changed brother his heart became like the heart of an animal he forgot that he had to sit at the table to eat one day he was out in in the field he was was out there eating with the animals he couldn't think the same he forgot who he was he had forgotten where His blessings were coming from it's so sad to see somebody that has Amnesia like that he was like that for a long time after at that God brought back his reasoning his thinking back to him therefore we're going to receive from God Brothers to be under his wings to be under his care we can't go up from under what God has given us for the very moment that you get away from what God has given you then you begin to forget you begin to forget where the blessings are coming from and that has happened to all of us not just Nebuchadnezzar that has happened to all of us beginning with me for for a time I forgot but let me tell you real quick the Lord reminded me when you are of the Lord if you want to find out if you're of God or not how many want to know if you're of the Lord or of God the Lord Jesus Christ he's going to bring to you to an accountability and if you're a little forgetful he'll bring it to your Rememberance a little by little he's going to begin to take things away from you until you remember and let me tell you that's happened to me that's the way God works because he wants to try us he he wants to find out through the basis of fire he puts us in a fiery [Applause] trial as the young man that he put in that burning furnace God wanted to see if they were going to still be faithful to him God wants to know that same thing about us God wants to see that about our brother he's going to give us a little bit of sickness a pain our money is going to run out because we became a little forgetful as humans that happens he brings us to be broken as brother Daniel was speaking he begins to break you when he begins to break us the way that he does it I'm not going to say that it's pretty the way he does it because as humans we don't like any kind of thing that breaks us but let me tell you brother for that flower for that fragrance to come it has to be crushed smashed it has to be crushed and and it's like that that's what cut let's loose that fragrance and he does it like that he does it like that and he's going to continue to do it like that there are nations that God has risen up and he has blessed them and a little bit afterwards we have written the read the histories in the Bible how God blesses a nation and a little while afterwards that they forget they begin to do the things of the world and when they at least they think about it they don't know if they're from over here or over here that's what happened with the people of Israel they they left Egypt they were so emotional so happy because they were going to lead Egypt they had been in slavery so for so many years that when they left Egypt oh they were so happy they were so they were so emotional but after a little while they began to forget you know why they began to forget because God began to give them and give them more but when god holds back his hand then you raise up your head you think where did the blessing go and then God says why are you so forgetful that's when God brings an adjustment in us the the people of Israel the people of Israel were brought and God adjusted them they had to make a decision a decision decision like you and I have to make if we want to continue forward we're going to be a separated people we're not going to be separated to to be isolated but a people separated to him we we we don't want to be separated to be strange but to be separated to him what is good to be separated or or isolated we have to be separated unto him you want to be with your brother you're not going to see Jesus any better than seeing your brother I can't stand that brother I just can't stomach him then we need a trip to the altar we have to come to the altar we have to be reconciled with our brother remember that you you are the hands that God has today we are the mouth that God has today and there's not going to be a day where you're going to be a greater person than you are today you're great today but many of us have to begin to manifest that we have to put more honey in the Box to retain that water but if you don't have that that box well Anointed with the honey the water is going to run out the word is not going to stay there when you begin to put that honey in there and you come close to your brother brother brother let's go over here let's do this you begin to love your brother and the sisters begin to love the sisters the sisters to the sisters there you begin to see there's more hone if not the water is going to leak out but the honey can hold back the water that that's the problem with the age of L they have been so enriched in so many things they have so many programs and trips here and there and the honey where did the honey stay if there's no honey the water is not going to be retained don't worry about going everywhere your kingdom is going to be here my kingom is going to be here if I put more honey to be able to retain and keep that water God bless you this evening I pray that these words have been a help to you let's stand to our [Applause] feet uh we're going to Bow our heads we're going to ask all the ministers to come we have some handkerchiefs here our sister Cynthia she has not felt good sister sister Isabelle also does not feel well we're going to pray for these handkerchiefs and then we will give them to them Lord Jesus we just come before you Lord and we anoint these handkerchiefs Lord yes Lord with the power of almighty God that when these are placed upon the sick and The Afflicted that any Spirit of infirmity would believe any sickness would leave and the spirit of God would come upon the people yes Lord in such a way that it would bring them to you Lord to glorify your name to testify of your goodness we believe it now as we pray as a United Ministry in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen [Music] amen [Music] Hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Music] the [Music] [Music] for [Music]
