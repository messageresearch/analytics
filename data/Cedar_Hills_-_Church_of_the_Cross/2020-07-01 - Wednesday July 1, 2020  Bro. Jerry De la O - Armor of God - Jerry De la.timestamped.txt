[41:35] you could say that that might be about
[41:36] maybe a belt right he says he a la
[41:39] Carrera correcto you can say it about I
[41:42] guess I guess in the Roman soldiers a
[41:45] lot Romano's they had the Bell then en
[41:48] la Carrera right here and that's where
[41:49] they stored their weapons
[41:50] yeah isn't a sousou-sama Luna you know
[41:53] because they're gonna they're gonna need
[41:55] to have access to it but Kathy nicotinic
[41:57] say so but I but oh but here it says
[41:59] girded about with truth
[42:01] literally circular cone but that right
[42:03] correct oh so you gotta have the truth
[42:05] and what is the truth they didn't ever
[42:07] die qualities like that God's Word is
[42:09] true la palabra use along with that and
[42:11] the devil knows that in El Diablo
[42:14] cerveza so you gotta have that belt tied
[42:16] around you in a catenary say it's a
[42:18] career center owner morale because it's
[42:22] the truth
[42:22] porque la verdad and that's the way we
[42:24] fight the devil yes is come openly
[42:26] almost fell in amigo knowing that we
[42:27] have that belt around us
[42:29] so in look at the nemesis the carrera de
[42:31] nosotros and it's a foundation yes some
[42:33] fundamental and it's a foundation of
[42:35] truth as a novel fundamentally verdad
[42:37] and if you know what most men who were
[42:39] about to say sorry muchos de la material
[42:43] loss on the schools and career you
[42:44] understand it it's tightly wrapped
[42:46] around you it's the style style road to
[42:48] step it's close around you is that
[42:51] it's very secure around you I'm ELISA
[42:54] good at real estate so when the devil
[42:56] comes front of us and we have that truth
[42:58] wrapped closely around us it's animals
[43:01] deserve that
[43:02] who style DiNozzo trolls because the
[43:05] devil will always use one thing Portello
[43:07] simple Sarna cosa he'll try to use doubt
[43:09] in your mind
[43:10] co-producer do the instrument the devil
[43:13] can tell the truth
[43:14] Ileana no players in love with that
[43:16] because he was a liar from the beginning
[43:18] rifleman Tito's the principal so he's
[43:20] gonna tell you lies the clinic a the
[43:23] cinema theatres but if you have that
[43:25] belt the truth around you witness a
[43:28] career little that algorithms with you
[43:31] and you can stand you can tell no devil
[43:33] that is not true

[44:11] into cambio una pilota and we can't
[44:14] reason with God's Word you know Palma
[44:16] doesn't open up another use God's Word
[44:18] is true la palabra de love it'll keep us
[44:20] on the path no Bob Anthony Camino we can
[44:23] fight the devil with it or a mostly a
[44:26] little amigo conditional because he's
[44:27] going to attack us for kalos bought the
[44:29] car and he's gonna attack us hard in
