into genesis let's go to chapter we're going to open up the chapter 37 and we're going to be reading verse 3 and 4. verso this is about joseph okay jose now israel loved joseph more than all his children because he was the son the son of his old age and made him a coat of many colors and when his brethren saw their father loved him more than all his brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him and let us bow our heads amen yeah man i don't know i don't know about you guys but you know the ustedes titled the message why me i don't know i i the other day well it's been a little bit but during the the covey times when it was really bad and the church when it was shut down and we were watching stuff online that just nothing was going right morning all so anyway i wake up in the morning and my the brakes on my truck are going out i go to work the order didn't come in uh the customer needs an installer right now because people need their tv right i call brother ben brother ben has no installers in the area so then more stuff happens throughout the day i get another bleep customer i work i wear contacts and uh when i get home i i put on my glasses and uh let's sit down on my couch and uh you know i'm just i'm i'm just thinking about today and you know we're watching services online and i got it in my head that i'm like you know what i i my tv wasn't working

situations now i believe that joseph had every right after everything that he went through him being without fault yet being in prison he gave him a coat what's can you imagine that back satan gets something you can put that picture up [Music] it has a significant can we start to look at them with understanding him this dream especially he says this one through this dream hate him even more though if you have a mind say how are we going to bow down how are we going to do that joseph so here's joseph in this scene and joseph goes out to go look for his brother and when he sees his brothers the scriptures say when they see him they start to plot against is have you ever found yourself in a pit where you can't get out i remember being 17 18 years and you'll don't listen i told [Applause] yes and they he's i don't know if you've ever had somebody [Applause] he joseph had a very have you ever flirted and he gives honor to his mouth god and joseph is forgotten is so everything
