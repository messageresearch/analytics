[18:04] myself along with brother Jimmy we did
[18:07] we did a study for for Africa along
[18:10] these lines
[18:16] but Africa and it was about seven uh it
[18:20] was what we're going to start on tonight
[18:22] is the seventh Beast of Israel or the
[18:25] seven Jewish feasts
[18:30] and uh it uh we I think it might have
[18:33] taken us about 10 hours to do it
[18:39] there's no way we can do it justice
[18:42] tonight
[18:44] we're going to do an overview a little
[18:47] overview first of all
[18:51] and then uh we'll we'll uh then we're
[18:54] going to focus tonight on the Feast of
[18:57] the Passover
[19:00] and uh and then from there we'll we'll
[19:03] have the other panelists that will be
[19:05] taking on uh the unleavened bread
[19:11] the first fruits yes
[19:16] foreign
[19:27] [Music]
[20:03] [Music]
[20:08] it says and the Lord spake unto Moses
[20:10] saying
[20:14] speaking to the children of Israel
[20:16] Israel and say unto them
[20:18] concerning the Feast of the Lord
[20:21] which he shall Proclaim to be holy
[20:23] convocations
[20:25] even these are my feasts
[20:28] is
[20:38] six days shall be shall work be done but
[20:42] the seventh day is the Sabbath of rest
[20:44] and holy convocation you shall do no
[20:47] work therein it is the Sabbath of the
[20:50] Lord in all your dwellings
[20:53] [Music]
[21:03] these are the feasts of the Lord verse 4
[21:06] even holy convocations which he shall
[21:09] Proclaim in their seasons
[21:17] in
[21:19] verse 5 in the 14th day of the of the
[21:22] first month and even is the Lord's
[21:25] Passover
[21:32] and so so we we're going right away into
[21:36] and I do want to uh Brethren is is uh is
[21:40] is what what a topic that that our
[21:42] pastor has chosen for for for for us and
[21:46] for the rest of the panelists in trundle
[21:48] in Minnesota
[21:50] so much here okay
[21:53] brother brother brother Ron the Passover
[21:57] means what to to to us as believers
[22:04] well first of all brother Tommy momentum
[22:07] on the Tom as you read a minute ago
[22:12] it was the second the the Passover the
[22:15] sacrifice was killed on the 14th day
[22:20] now it might not be
[22:23] you know the month of abib as when this
[22:25] sacrifice was was killed
[22:32] well I don't think it's a coincidence
[22:34] that today is December 14th is
[22:39] when the Passover was killed
[22:43] and we're speaking about the password
[22:47] you know what what this what this
[22:49] Passover was uh Naturally Speaking
[22:52] naturally
[22:58] so naturally speaking and I'm sure most
[23:01] of us have read the scriptures but
[23:06] but for those who haven't uh what what
[23:09] this was uh what is celebrated was when
[23:12] God spared the the lives of the
[23:14] firstborn children of of Israel
[23:17] Las Vegas
[23:22] when the death angel passed and those
[23:24] those of homes those households that had
[23:28] the blood on the lintel the doorposts
[23:35] the death angel would pass over them
[23:40] that simply is but it is is in itself if
[23:43] you look at the word is to pass
[23:46] over but it is
[23:50] brother brother Ronnie started with with
[23:54] the the of the death angel
[23:57] this is something that is of vital
[24:00] importance continue
[24:03] in our in our time today
[24:06] and so go go ahead I'm sorry we're we're
[24:11] let's go back and forth no no as there's
[24:13] a scripture that our that our pastor he
[24:15] he references uh quite often
[24:18] reference and we'll all you know we all
[24:22] know it that Hell hath enlarged her
[24:23] mouth
[24:26] you know and I don't think it's a
[24:28] coincidence that at this time right here
[24:32] this day and age that we live in is
[24:35] that naturally speaking
[24:38] because we're still on on the on on the
[24:41] topic of of uh of um
[24:44] modern events right
[24:47] now I don't think it's a coincidence
[24:50] that the United States had just made a
[24:52] trade by the time no crocus coincidence
[24:56] for a basketball player
[25:01] you know they traded for a man whose
[25:03] nickname is The Merchant of death
[25:10] so we see this man as responsible for
[25:13] for Much Death Naturally Speaking
[25:15] responsible
[25:18] he's probably in this modern day
[25:21] is more responsible for more deaths than
[25:25] any one single person in particular is
[25:27] responsible
[25:29] Persona in particular so his big old
[25:31] arms dealer isn't a great big arms
[25:33] dealer I don't know how many have have
[25:34] read on it but he's
[25:38] [Music]
[25:40] ammunition he
[25:43] um had his hand in many uh if not all of
[25:47] recent Wars
[25:51] you know and I don't think it's a
[25:53] coincidence that it was a trade there
[25:55] was a simultaneous freeing
[25:58] [Music]
[25:59] um
[26:06] you have death
[26:09] and all its attributes Jesus attributos
[26:14] brother Jim
[26:17] this shows you
[26:19] what people value today
[26:23] entertainment entertainment
[26:27] you you take a marine there
[26:32] big Hollywood stars were even upset at
[26:35] this Hollywood
[26:43] because I can't remember the Marine's
[26:45] name but he's been in prison for four
[26:47] years
[26:53] and instead of bringing him
[26:57] who fought for his country
[27:00] they freed a person
[27:03] of the lowest morale character that you
[27:06] could speak of yeah
[27:09] because they're a famous basketball
[27:11] player
[27:13] uh
[27:15] all the modern ideas of of society today
[27:21] they value it more that female
[27:24] basketball player is
[27:28] nothing wrong with other women playing
[27:30] basketball I'm not speaking against that
[27:34] but anyway
[27:37] but they put more value on that than
[27:40] they did on a man that has put his life
[27:43] on the line for this nation
[27:49] I would like to ask brother Isaiah real
[27:53] quick we're talked about to
[27:55] put the blood on the dental and the post
[27:59] of the house once the lamb was slain
[28:02] what does the dental the post represent
[28:06] in The Believer yes
[28:14] uh so to the believer that's the heart
[28:18] El Corazon
[28:21] the Passover meant
[28:23] it means
[28:25] in a in a very broad
[28:29] terminal movie
[28:32] it was the shadow of things to come
[28:35] remember that that uh that the Old
[28:39] Testaments
[28:41] it's typed in Shadows of the new son
[28:44] Depot
[28:45] and so so what what what the the
[28:48] Passover was the feast
[28:51] what was the the shadow of it was what
[28:54] he was going to do on Calvary La Sombra
[28:57] ERA
[28:59] this is what why Calvary is so important
[29:03] to us
[29:06] it's because we know what he did on
[29:09] Calvary for us
[29:12] but we go down the line
[29:15] I want you to notice one thing
[29:19] is that the lamb that was slain on
[29:23] Calvary
[29:26] was not our lamb
[29:30] it was God's land
[29:33] the Lamb of God
[29:36] that's why that's why when when when the
[29:39] Prophet The Prophet that came in the
[29:41] spirit and power of Elijah
[29:44] that's why we believe in Elijah yes
[29:49] the the spirit of Elijah
[29:53] he was the one that had the revelation
[29:57] behold the lamb of God
[29:59] that taketh away the sin of the world
[30:02] this was the only thing that would
[30:05] satisfy God
[30:07] so then we understand in hearing our
[30:10] pastor our founding pastor
[30:13] pastor and here in our pastor yes that
[30:17] Jesus Paid the ultimate sacrifice or
[30:20] Redemption
[30:24] but each and every one of us
[30:27] also pay a price
[30:31] to bring Redemption to God's people
[30:35] so that's why I don't want you to forget
[30:38] on the first part of the Passover
[30:43] was God's land
[30:46] that would take away the sin of the
[30:48] world
[30:50] how many this lamb how many days did
[30:54] they have to keep this land okay
[30:57] they're gonna sacrifice what was the
[31:00] preparation even for the land
[31:04] preparation before I get to that brother
[31:08] I want everyone to notice this
[31:12] that this Feast of the Passover is
[31:16] it was one day era
[31:20] signifying that Jesus Christ the
[31:22] ultimate sacrifice will die one time
[31:25] significance
[31:29] you didn't have to keep on dying over
[31:31] and over
[31:33] here
[31:35] the Feast of the unleavened bread it's
[31:37] it's unleavened bread for seven days
[31:42] you know it is by one offering but it's
[31:45] perfected them that are Sanctified by
[31:47] the time Uno frienda Perfection
[31:50] now you go into the requirements
[31:56] first of all a lamb had to be picked
[31:58] doubt on the 10th day is
[32:06] why why the 10th day
[32:12] because
[32:14] the family had to pick out a lamb La
[32:17] Familia
[32:18] um
[32:23] lamb should be without blemish
[32:29] and that's exactly right just how Jesus
[32:31] Christ was the perfect sinless sacrifice
[32:34] for our sins
[32:40] a land that knew no sin took Upon Our
[32:43] Time okay
[32:47] so the slam had to be picked out on the
[32:50] 10th day is
[32:52] brother Isaiah said they had to be have
[32:55] no blemish
[32:58] it was sacrificed on the 14th day yeah
[33:05] and that's what these 10 days were to to
[33:07] look over the lamb to make sure that
[33:09] there was no blemish
[33:11] they had to live with the little so they
[33:14] had to live with the lamb and they had
[33:15] to I remember our pastor and I believe
[33:17] in the in the in the parallels
[33:22] he says that they had to build a
[33:24] relationship with it it had to when they
[33:26] were sacrificed it had to hurt them it
[33:28] had to hurt them
[33:33] you have to identify with the Lambs
[33:40] now now once once it was it was
[33:43] sacrificed
[33:45] now the other requirement was it had to
[33:48] eat all the Lambs
[33:52] brother Jim so what would happen if if a
[33:55] family was too small to eat the whole
[33:58] lamb family
[34:01] it's like by the time you said if you
[34:03] read the rest rest of the chapter
[34:08] it said in Exodus 12.
[34:11] they didn't have enough people to eat
[34:14] all the Lambs
[34:18] they're neighbors
[34:21] because all of the Lamb
[34:24] had to be eaten
[34:28] showing you and me
[34:39] it reminds me of a message that brother
[34:42] Branham preached
[34:45] called the token
[34:52] he makes this statement different
[34:55] but basically he says full obedience
[34:59] assist declaration
[35:02] to the full word
[35:07] entitles you to the
[35:12] tokenya now right now we'll get into a
[35:14] little bit more why the blood was a
[35:16] token and what it means
[35:21] you couldn't leave not the intestines
[35:23] nothing that had to all be eaten
[35:27] that's why we have invited neighbors
[35:30] here
[35:32] aren't we neighbors
[35:34] love thy neighbor as thyself
[35:38] because we must eat all of the words
[35:42] what you're trying to tell all of us
[35:46] is that the full word of God came to us
[35:52] we eat all of it that's right because
[35:54] until the whole word of God came
[35:59] to obey something you had no access to
[36:02] yet
[36:05] so brother Jim what you're telling me is
[36:09] you're referring to the scripture where
[36:12] it says take the book
[36:15] the book eat the book the whole book
[36:17] what's going to happen when you eat the
[36:22] books
[36:24] be sweet in your mouth
[36:27] and bitter in your belly yeah
[36:31] yeah and what a coincidence that that
[36:33] one of the other requirements for for
[36:35] the the sacrifice brother Jimmy The
[36:37] Coincidence
[36:40] was that it had to be cooked with bitter
[36:42] herbs
[36:47] bitter herbs okay Americas so now then
[36:51] it also had to be
[36:52] now now this was now that was the
[36:55] requirements for the lamb
[36:57] now there's now there's a requirements
[37:01] also brother Tom of of the person that's
[37:03] going to be eating the lamb
[37:05] tell us about it
[37:08] well because they left the land of Egypt
[37:11] and haste is
[37:16] there when they ate the the Passover
[37:18] they had to be they had their loins
[37:20] girded
[37:23] now they had to eat it with their shoes
[37:25] on they were prepared
[37:29] and staff in hand
[37:32] in Manu and it had to be eaten
[37:37] yes what do you have on on that for us
[37:41] right there brother Jim well
[37:43] the reason they had to eat it in haste
[37:47] it's not so much that they were in a
[37:49] hurry
[37:53] the dead angel had passed
[37:57] the call had come
[38:00] how many know what Israel was called
[38:04] when they were in Egypt what is
[38:12] the people of God El Pueblo de dios when
[38:17] God called them out of Egypt into the
[38:20] desert of wilderness
[38:23] then what did he call it
[38:26] the church the Iglesia so what does the
[38:31] word church mean everybody everybody
[38:35] the word church
[38:40] the
[38:42] significance
[38:45] are you happy
[38:49] this was not a guesswork
[38:55] it wasn't they were going to have
[38:57] another opportunity
[39:00] they had to leave when God called them
[39:05] through the mouth of the Prophet Moses
[39:09] in the first Exodus
[39:12] that's why they left with a sense of
[39:15] urgency and haste
[39:17] because it was a life or death situation
[39:24] brother Jimmy and the message does not
[39:28] brother Branham say that uh
[39:31] Rebecca who was blood relation to Isaac
[39:38] she had to make her decision quick
[39:41] decision absolutely absolutely because
[39:45] God's servant with their Eliezer because
[39:49] had the Commandment or commission from
[39:53] Abraham
[39:55] to find a bride for his son Isaac
[40:03] one little thing a couple little things
[40:06] different about the Exodus then
[40:11] as they left in haste
[40:14] and The Exodus
[40:17] how many of you know we're in an exodus
[40:22] how many Exodus
[40:27] you know to those somebody raise the oh
[40:32] yeah raise it high brother
[40:35] you know those three Tres amen the first
[40:39] Exodus is when Noah went into the ark
[40:44] yeah
[40:45] [Music]
[40:46] he fully obeyed one man fully obeyed
[40:50] what God told him
[40:53] he got his family in the
[40:57] arka and then the Judgment spell
[41:01] the second Exodus is they came out which
[41:04] is what we're talking about now out of
[41:07] egyptus
[41:09] the type of the World Systems today
[41:15] it's a type of Cosmos the world order
[41:21] Los Cosmos world order they were the
[41:25] greatest nation of the time
[41:28] and what was the problem with Israel in
[41:31] general when how many million left
[41:39] 2 million
[41:41] many people had come out of Egypt
[41:46] many people had come out of Egypt
[41:49] but Egypt had not come out of them
[41:55] so
[41:58] so brother Jimmy Jimmy so
[42:02] so what you're telling me is that that
[42:04] it didn't fully come out of them because
[42:06] they didn't eat the whole books
[42:14] no they literally did
[42:21] when they came from a state of
[42:24] justification when they came out and
[42:27] were baptized Under the Red Sea and
[42:29] under the cloudification
[42:33] that was justification
[42:36] but what did the Wilderness
[42:38] representative
[42:40] anybody
[42:42] it resent represents sanctification
[42:46] and during this time God fed them bread
[42:49] from heaven right
[42:52] what was that that bread called yes
[42:58] I don't want to get into that but it was
[43:02] a light bread
[43:06] it didn't satisfy them
[43:11] and the thing about it you had to eat it
[43:14] the day that it fell from heaven
[43:18] Fresco if you left it to the next day it
[43:21] was warming
[43:24] and what does that tell you and me
[43:27] when God reveals something for us to
[43:31] take and eat
[43:35] we must do it when God brings down the
[43:40] Manna is
[43:42] we might try to do something about it
[43:45] two weeks later a month later
[43:49] how many of us have done that and
[43:52] realized you know what that didn't work
[43:55] effective
[44:00] so they said we would rather go back to
[44:04] Egypt because even though we were slaves
[44:10] we ate garlic and onions
[44:13] cucumbers cucumbers you know cucumbers
[44:17] is okay with salad but you know besides
[44:19] that you know the Pinos
[44:22] they would rather go back and eat that
[44:24] than to eat what God was supplying for
[44:27] them
[44:28] Angels food yeah Angels food and they
[44:31] were still they as our pastor I preached
[44:33] many times they still had the mentality
[44:36] brother
[44:43] brother Isaiah Isaiah they they would
[44:47] they would back to they would take the
[44:49] blood
[44:51] and brother Jimmy asked you the question
[44:53] they would put it upon the lintel of the
[44:56] doorpost
[45:00] what does that represent today and you
[45:02] said their heart your heart
[45:07] if if that blood was not was not placed
[45:11] upon the lintel of the doorposts
[45:16] who did it
[45:18] again
[45:21] did it affect the whole family or was
[45:24] there a particular person that it
[45:26] affected
[45:27] in particular
[45:31] um I believe it was okay uh the
[45:34] firstborn
[45:36] so this is this this this comes into
[45:40] into a into a into a sense of of uh of
[45:44] then brother brother Isaiah a
[45:46] desperation is still in in trouble
[45:49] because to the to the majority of people
[45:53] uh we we we we we uh are very are very
[45:58] uh happy to to know the the word of God
[46:05] and and we we we know about what God's
[46:09] word comes to do for us is
[46:13] but there is a direct effect that it
[46:17] happens to us
[46:20] being that we all belong to the Church
[46:23] of the firstborn
[46:28] now now the now the firstborn was going
[46:31] to die if that blood's not applied
[46:37] and so it is a vital importance it is
[46:42] importante so that we would know that
[46:44] even in our own lives and in our own
[46:47] homes
[46:50] to know that the blood is there or not
[46:55] when your life is on the line
[46:59] you better know if it's there honest
[47:02] you know that that's where mama and
[47:05] daddy can't get you out
[47:07] it's a personal effect between you and
[47:11] God as soon as
[47:13] the firstborn had to go and check
[47:23] because until he himself saw the dead
[47:27] put the blood on the lintel of the doors
[47:32] that Death Angel could not pass over
[47:34] them
[47:36] each person in particular person with
[47:40] the message that has been given to us
[47:44] an adulterated word of God
[47:48] a leading word of God and when that lamb
[47:52] is bleeding
[47:54] make sure that it is applied in your
[47:58] life
[48:01] you will die we will die
[48:08] I was asked here to correct something go
[48:11] ahead yes sir
[48:12] the first Exodus was Noah going into the
[48:15] ark foreign
[48:49] what condition are you on you're coming
[48:51] from one spiritual condition into
[48:54] another spiritual baptism of the Holy
[48:56] Ghost
[48:58] and then the third from the baptism of
[49:00] the Holy Ghost right back into the
[49:02] Millennium for the great hereafter
[49:06] okay
[49:07] let me go back again yes please repeat
[49:09] to us
[49:12] the first Exodus is Israel coming out of
[49:15] egyptus is
[49:20] but my natural land to another natural
[49:22] land
[49:24] the next is
[49:27] we're coming up from one spiritual
[49:30] condition
[49:31] spiritual to another spiritual baptism
[49:35] of the Holy Ghost
[49:38] now remember that actually the token
[49:42] is but then from the baptism of the Holy
[49:46] Ghost that is
[49:47] to go right back into the Millennium and
[49:51] the Daniel here that's right that's what
[49:53] he said yes sir you can't skip one and
[49:55] put one into place of the other that's
[49:57] right
[50:00] or you'll never get to the Great
[50:02] Millennium and the great hereafter
[50:09] so so we so brother Jim what you're
[50:12] telling me is that is is that
[50:14] or what we've been reading here it's
[50:16] it's been history but we can't leave it
[50:18] as history right now
[50:23] I want the people to notice this thing
[50:26] about the feast even though we're just
[50:27] hitting the first one
[50:31] because we're not really going to get
[50:34] into the prophetic part of what it means
[50:37] to Israel so much
[50:40] at least tonight
[50:42] but what we want to see is how it is
[50:45] applies to us
[50:48] but one thing I see about this feast in
[50:51] general
[50:53] all of these pieces
[50:56] cover yesterday
[51:01] boy
[51:03] and forever
[51:05] so God's College not only for us to see
[51:08] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[51:10] today and forever
[51:16] but for Israel to see the same thing
[51:21] truly when this same message
[51:25] that we believe today is
[51:29] revealed to them
[51:33] they will see the Christ of yesterday
[51:36] first
[51:39] and then there'll be two prophets
[51:43] the other day
[51:47] show them
[51:51] Jesus Christ in the present tense
[51:54] and they'll know what their inheritance
[51:57] is
[52:02] it is
[52:05] they will realize that they rejected the
[52:08] Messiah
[52:10] when they rejected Jesus
[52:13] Christ they'll look back and see the
[52:15] Christ that they crucified
[52:20] tell us what my Papa said today
[52:23] what did he say today you're the one
[52:26] that's telling us that the opposite is
[52:28] okay oh he he said I was listening to a
[52:31] message
[52:34] and entitled The headship of Christ
[52:37] the the Third Exodus
[52:42] and he said this statement if this is
[52:45] the statement you're after Jesus
[52:48] he said God will let you air dios
[52:55] yeah
[52:56] people would choke on that right he
[52:59] actually read a scripture I believe out
[53:01] of Isaiah
[53:03] he says God will let you air
[53:06] so that he can show you
[53:10] what tribe you pertain to
[53:14] he goes today people people don't know
[53:17] where they belong today
[53:21] per se as like Israel
[53:25] we are a tribe and he makes the
[53:29] statement God never went over and hung
[53:31] around with Benjamin all the time and
[53:33] and his inheritance
[53:37] God knew his place
[53:41] Benjamin knew his place God God
[53:46] Ibraham knew his place
[53:51] what tribe they were and what many of us
[53:55] have aired why many of us
[53:59] because we don't know what tribe we
[54:02] belong to foreign
[54:27] Papa
[54:45] talk to us brother Ryan
[54:48] I've done this let me run
[54:51] My Brother Jimmy's so awesome
[54:54] I want him to continue you're awesome
[54:57] so so brother Jim no no Jim so
[55:00] referencing our founding Pastor right
[55:04] he says what was the problem with the
[55:06] little lamb in the first Covenant
[55:10] it was a substitute
[55:14] but the life couldn't return
[55:18] but here he says
[55:21] if I see Yo personal pronoun
[55:25] go away
[55:28] I your personal pronoun
[55:31] will return again to you
[55:36] that's the promise of the holy spirit is
[55:40] to return back regressar to the
[55:44] worshiper
[55:49] yeah
[55:50] this this this is what what when we come
[55:54] into it's more than than just
[55:58] coming into what we know as as Easter
[56:01] and Jesus came and he died for us
[56:06] and and we're coming to church
[56:10] and then we we might live the same life
[56:13] that we lived in last year
[56:18] you know until that the the the
[56:21] Revelation comes to us
[56:24] what he did foreign
[57:07] when we see if you ever see The Passion
[57:11] of the Christ have you ever anybody ever
[57:13] seen this is
[57:17] did you ever did you get upset when you
[57:19] first saw it
[57:22] I did you'll see and that was only uh
[57:26] two and a half three hours so those guys
[57:30] but but in real life it was over 18
[57:33] hours
[57:37] of what he did for you
[57:40] did for me this should cause ourselves
[57:45] to surrender that much more to him
[57:49] because it was it's not as as our Pastor
[57:53] said and brother Jim says
[57:55] to bring to bring it to to today how
[57:58] does it function today
[58:02] unless he lives inside of our hearts
[58:07] tell help tell them real quickly what
[58:10] God did for you you don't have to go
[58:13] into details what did God do you say
[58:16] uh well first off I just want to say
[58:19] just to kind of just bear with me here
[58:23] because I'm up here with these
[58:29] and I'm still in rookie mode
[58:33] tell us what he did for you so uh just a
[58:36] little something here
[58:38] so we're talking about the Passover
[58:42] and like we had said before we know that
[58:45] that these people they took a lamb
[58:49] and the lamb wasn't supposed to have any
[58:52] blemish
[58:54] and we knew that they were going to kill
[58:56] it in the evening time
[58:59] and with that blood
[59:02] they were going to put it on the toll on
[59:05] the doorposts
[59:08] uh so we know that if if the blood was
[59:11] there on the doorpost in the
[59:13] lentilation
[59:16] that the death angel was gonna pass over
[59:21] remember we're talking about the
[59:23] Passover
[59:25] so um
[59:28] I feel like
[59:31] that
[59:32] the thing here is that I that God sent
[59:36] or
[59:38] he sent signs and wonders to these
[59:41] people in Egypt
[59:44] and to pharaoh and the people yeah
[59:49] but
[59:50] I don't believe that they picked up
[59:53] these signs that God was sending them
[59:57] I mean they were you know they even were
[1:00:01] trying to pretty much whatever Moses was
[1:00:03] saying the prophet that God had sent
[1:00:04] them
[1:00:08] it almost kind of just like went through
[1:00:11] one ear and out the other
[1:00:14] and so I feel like
[1:00:17] God kind of was like oh you know you
[1:00:21] guys understand you need these signs
[1:00:25] and you're just kind of just flat out
[1:00:29] ignoring it
[1:00:32] so I feel like at that time God was
[1:00:35] gonna cause a separation
[1:00:40] from those who believed in those who
[1:00:42] didn't and
[1:00:45] that was the the whole thing about with
[1:00:48] applying the blood yes uh
[1:01:09] what did God do for you
[1:01:12] what has he done
[1:01:14] that that is so very important when you
[1:01:16] when you when you really come to the
[1:01:19] nitty-gritty of where you were at and
[1:01:21] where you're at now
[1:01:24] what did you what did Jesus don't
[1:01:26] understand
[1:01:28] uh while I used to be I used to be uh
[1:01:32] antis I was out you know before you know
[1:01:36] before I was baptized you know
[1:01:38] you know I was out there doing things I
[1:01:41] shouldn't have been doing
[1:01:43] I was saying things here things I
[1:01:45] shouldn't have yeah
[1:01:50] and you know when I had that that
[1:01:53] experience with the Lord
[1:01:55] and when I gave my heart to him
[1:01:59] uh you know after that that's when I
[1:02:01] just really started to dig deep you know
[1:02:03] and just kind of really listen to the
[1:02:04] messages
[1:02:08] so then I feel like that's when God had
[1:02:11] taken me out
[1:02:13] he had taken me out of out of the worst
[1:02:16] condition that I was in in my life
[1:02:20] out of Egypt
[1:02:23] that that is so a vital importance with
[1:02:27] what he just got through saying
[1:02:30] you know I started digging deep
[1:02:35] I believe that that this year is going
[1:02:38] to be a year to dig deep
[1:02:42] we've already done a lot of things
[1:02:45] shallow-wise
[1:02:49] we've done I've done a lot of things
[1:02:51] shallow-wise we do a lot of things
[1:02:56] but just on the top
[1:02:58] and there's ripples on the water
[1:03:03] but how many people have really dug down
[1:03:06] to see who exactly you really are yeah
[1:03:12] that has really done for you
[1:03:15] and what your response is to him
[1:03:19] it's got to be more than just come to
[1:03:21] church
[1:03:28] it's got to be something that that that
[1:03:31] is more than I just raised up my hand or
[1:03:34] I sang a song
[1:03:36] [Music]
[1:03:39] but when we come to draw an eye on the
[1:03:42] revelation of the blood
[1:03:45] Revelation that there's a life that go
[1:03:49] that that is inside of that Blood
[1:03:52] Brother Jim tell us about about what
[1:03:54] what that life is
[1:03:57] without the understanding of what it has
[1:04:00] done for us
[1:04:04] wow
[1:04:06] where did the blood come from
[1:04:11] the word blessed
[1:04:14] that was my next statement yeah
[1:04:19] please that's great
[1:04:22] as two shall agree is to touching
[1:04:23] anything on Earth
[1:04:25] my father will honor it amen the word
[1:04:28] bled
[1:04:31] the blood
[1:04:32] somebody but when that Roman soldier
[1:04:36] pierced his side
[1:04:39] plit opened the blood cell
[1:04:42] okay
[1:04:47] the life that was in that blood came
[1:04:53] and now since it wasn't the blood or
[1:04:56] life of an animal
[1:04:59] now that life of the blood of the
[1:05:03] pleading word comes in you
[1:05:07] know who caused you to do it's going to
[1:05:11] cause you to live the life of the blood
[1:05:14] that came out of the word
[1:05:18] you live anything else
[1:05:23] every day with Jesus
[1:05:26] is sweeter than the day before
[1:05:31] you know brother Isaiah
[1:05:33] no matter if you're a rookie or a
[1:05:35] veteran
[1:05:38] because when the death angel was gonna
[1:05:40] pass
[1:05:42] he didn't care how old they were
[1:05:47] it didn't matter if there were a baby
[1:05:50] if they were an old man even an animal
[1:05:53] even if you were a lamb or a goat or a
[1:05:56] person of the male right
[1:06:00] how many firstborns do we have in here
[1:06:08] firstborn too huh
[1:06:10] tambien now watch this
[1:06:14] he says I don't believe the death angel
[1:06:16] came to every house and said hey what
[1:06:19] are you eating today
[1:06:32] he says no he said no the death angel
[1:06:34] never looked what they were eating on
[1:06:37] the inside
[1:06:40] he knew by the blood that the lamb was
[1:06:43] inside
[1:06:46] you know say say that again I want you
[1:06:50] to really capture this thing
[1:06:52] he knew by the he says here he says he
[1:06:56] knew by the blood
[1:06:57] that there was a lamp
[1:07:04] man this is the one that I feel like
[1:07:06] preaching here
[1:07:08] so so yeah so yesterday I'm I'm out to
[1:07:11] lunch right
[1:07:13] what were you eating yeah
[1:07:16] I was just drinking a cup of coffee
[1:07:19] and I was reading the book of Exodus
[1:07:23] you know and I came across Exodus
[1:07:25] chapter 22.
[1:07:29] if they were to put it on there for me
[1:07:32] Exodus 12 22.
[1:07:35] and as I was reading the scripture the
[1:07:38] Holy Spirit caught my attention on this
[1:07:39] brother
[1:07:42] and ye shall take a bunch of
[1:07:47] hyssopo and dip it in the blood that is
[1:07:51] in the Basin
[1:07:52] and strike the lentil and the two side
[1:07:56] posts
[1:07:59] with the blood that is in the Basin
[1:08:04] and none of you shall go out the door of
[1:08:06] his house until the morning
[1:08:10] you know I was just about to go into
[1:08:13] verse 23.
[1:08:15] you know but it's it's awesome how the
[1:08:17] Holy Spirit Works
[1:08:20] he says
[1:08:22] read it again
[1:08:25] and ye shall take a bunch and he says
[1:08:27] stop it
[1:08:31] a bunch take a bunch of hyssa um
[1:08:35] I mean it's it's simple right what the
[1:08:37] word Bunch means right it is
[1:08:39] like you know an example there's a bunch
[1:08:42] of us in here foreign
[1:08:56] [Music]
[1:09:03] it means
[1:09:05] now aguda means a band aguda is
[1:09:10] not like abandoned like a plane
[1:09:13] like people yeah
[1:09:17] like a rubber band kind of like a band
[1:09:21] Elastica it means binding
[1:09:25] chords uh
[1:09:30] and this is where the Holy Spirit caught
[1:09:32] my attention right here
[1:09:33] [Music]
[1:09:34] a band of man
[1:09:37] um
[1:09:38] a band of troops
[1:09:41] and they also made a vault of heavens
[1:09:44] one more time Vault of Heaven both of
[1:09:47] the heavens
[1:09:49] and it also means binding Earth
[1:09:52] to the heaven
[1:09:54] so now the holy spirit so I I read this
[1:09:58] and nobody got to get a little bit
[1:10:00] excited right now I'm there at
[1:10:02] McDonald's and I'm beside myself okay
[1:10:04] I'm having church at McDonald's
[1:10:08] and so so now the holy spirit says Now
[1:10:11] read it with the definition insertive
[1:10:12] and speak to something
[1:10:14] definition we heard a tremendous a
[1:10:17] couple of tremendous uh messages on
[1:10:19] faith from Brother Enrique and brother
[1:10:21] Diego escuchamos
[1:10:25] and so I'm going to read it like this
[1:10:28] and ye shall take a band of men
[1:10:34] full of Faith
[1:10:36] because Faith right at least so we heard
[1:10:39] we heard that in the last panel last
[1:10:40] week
[1:10:42] and this man of Faith you're gonna dip
[1:10:45] it into the blood is
[1:10:50] that is why the the this this Passover
[1:10:53] is so important
[1:10:55] and you shall take the take a band of
[1:10:58] man of faith
[1:11:03] and what are these men gonna do
[1:11:06] for they shall bind Heaven and Earth
[1:11:10] by the ultimate sacrifice which was the
[1:11:13] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:11:18] so so how can so how can people say we
[1:11:21] no longer need the Blood Brothers
[1:11:32] they say Naturally Speaking that the
[1:11:34] blood of Jesus fell to the ground and
[1:11:36] dried up in London
[1:11:39] but before it dried up the Earth
[1:11:41] absorbed it
[1:12:13] the literal blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:12:15] Christ fell to the ground
[1:12:21] the Earth which we are
[1:12:27] and that's why brother Tom brother
[1:12:30] the blood runs through the spiritual
[1:12:33] veins of the Bride they said
[1:12:38] it was a
[1:12:40] transference now our founding pastor
[1:12:43] preached on the message the transferring
[1:12:45] of the Kingdom uh
[1:12:47] you know and now I can understand that
[1:12:50] just a little bit more of what he meant
[1:12:52] by that
[1:12:54] you know so because again I already hear
[1:12:57] the way I have it before the blood dried
[1:12:59] up and it went through the Earth
[1:13:04] how you might ask
[1:13:08] which we are brother Branham says the
[1:13:10] blood of Jesus runs through the veins of
[1:13:11] the bread
[1:13:15] how you might ask
[1:13:17] by The Binding
[1:13:20] Heaven El Cielo and Earth and that's
[1:13:23] what Jesus came to do is to bind heaven
[1:13:26] heaven is
[1:13:31] look at this whatever you buying
[1:13:36] brother Ronnie if you bind Heaven and
[1:13:40] Earth together
[1:13:48] the voice of the blood of Christ the
[1:13:52] greatest things
[1:14:01] that's where the blood Cries From it's
[1:14:03] the voice of the blood says Heaven and
[1:14:07] Earth has United and every time
[1:14:11] we hear the voice of the blood
[1:14:15] now based on what he just said
[1:14:19] but I want to dramatize it to you a
[1:14:22] little bit
[1:14:24] full obedience to the full word
[1:14:33] full obedience to the full word entitles
[1:14:36] you
[1:14:38] or Valencia complete
[1:14:42] is it just an individual or is it you
[1:14:46] undivido or
[1:14:48] so how can you fully obey the words
[1:15:01] to the word entitles you to the Token
[1:15:08] there's a word right there
[1:15:13] all those words together
[1:15:15] fullness of the world
[1:15:19] of the word
[1:15:22] has brought us to the fullness of time
[1:15:35] so if I could just ask a little question
[1:15:37] here
[1:15:40] how many think that the blood is dried
[1:15:42] up and there's no significance
[1:15:49] trying to catch you guys to see if
[1:15:50] you're sleeping or not
[1:15:53] but how many believe
[1:15:56] that the blood is still fresh
[1:16:01] as it was 2 000 years ago
[1:16:06] yeah you guys are real convincing
[1:16:08] tonight
[1:16:09] let me just just one more time how many
[1:16:13] believe that the blood is still fresh
[1:16:17] today as it was 2 000 years ago
[1:16:23] speak unto the children
[1:16:28] and say unto them ES
[1:16:33] concerning the Feast of the Lord
[1:16:39] but you shall Proclaim
[1:16:44] and this is what I did not understand
[1:16:47] until the other day yeah
[1:16:56] we we always say that the eighth day is
[1:16:59] the holy convocation
[1:17:04] and it is
[1:17:08] but each one of those feasts was a holy
[1:17:10] convocation
[1:17:13] even though there's a cap to the pyramid
[1:17:18] finish to the work
[1:17:21] each one was a holy convocation
[1:17:27] de la fiesta the last note
[1:17:32] convocation convocation
[1:17:35] an assembly of persons
[1:17:39] called yamados individually
[1:17:42] no call together
[1:17:48] to a meeting
[1:17:50] something called out
[1:17:54] the persons
[1:17:57] the place
[1:17:59] the rehearsal
[1:18:03] and then the word it looks like the word
[1:18:05] hallowed
[1:18:09] sanctificado
[1:18:11] means to make holy
[1:18:15] or set apart
[1:18:18] holy youth
[1:18:21] the prophet of God tells us
[1:18:27] and this is the evening time of the age
[1:18:29] that we live
[1:18:31] in
[1:18:33] this is the evening time for for the
[1:18:36] church
[1:18:38] and this he says is the evening time for
[1:18:42] me yes
[1:18:45] this is the evening time of my message
[1:18:54] I'm moving out is in the evening time of
[1:18:58] the Gospel
[1:19:01] we've come up to justification and so
[1:19:04] forth yeah
[1:19:07] but this is the time
[1:19:10] that the token has to be applied
[1:19:15] for the animal life could not come back
[1:19:19] upon the human being
[1:19:23] when the blood was shed
[1:19:25] the life went out
[1:19:28] of course because it was a unit
[1:19:32] and when the life's blood was gone from
[1:19:34] it
[1:19:36] the life being different from the blood
[1:19:39] now
[1:19:42] the blood is the chemistry of the life
[1:19:45] LA sangres
[1:19:47] but the light is something different
[1:19:49] from the blood
[1:19:53] but the life is in the blood
[1:19:57] and the animal life could not come back
[1:20:00] upon the worshiper La Vida you heard
[1:20:02] that on Sunday
[1:20:06] when he shed this Blood of the Lamb
[1:20:11] to apply the chemistry
[1:20:14] because that that that the life was gone
[1:20:18] and could not come back
[1:20:22] but I'm in this glorious place
[1:20:27] under this Covenant
[1:20:30] there is a difference between the blood
[1:20:32] and the life
[1:20:37] for the believer today
[1:20:40] is the Holy Ghost is
[1:20:45] a chemistry but it is the holy spirit of
[1:20:49] God
[1:20:50] this is the token that God requires of
[1:20:54] the church
[1:21:00] see it in every one of us
[1:21:06] what is the token a sign of
[1:21:11] it's the life but what does it proof
[1:21:17] it has the purchasing power
[1:21:21] paid for yes it's already yours yes so
[1:21:26] when you go to pray you present your
[1:21:28] token there's no way for him to turn you
[1:21:31] down
[1:21:35] the proof of the purchase in your hands
[1:21:42] so our name is as so our name on the
[1:21:46] check is just good absolutely
[1:21:50] now now
[1:21:52] give us the preview and hit us on the on
[1:21:54] that last book
[1:22:00] the the bomb
[1:22:06] that you can do the audio one too and
[1:22:08] then and then hit the Tabernacle this is
[1:22:10] the Coming Attraction
[1:22:12] this is the bomb
[1:22:15] I will hijack that quote quick quick
[1:22:19] I sent brother Jimmy every time a quote
[1:22:22] the other day of our founding pastors
[1:22:24] there's no way to finish
[1:22:27] we're gonna just drop this Bomba
[1:22:32] well I sent it to him and he tried
[1:22:34] stealing it so yeah
[1:22:43] he says
[1:22:45] now Jesus was going to change he said
[1:22:48] Jesus change or bring a New Covenant
[1:22:53] but in order to bring a New Covenant
[1:22:57] he had to change Tabernacles
[1:23:02] to me it's so easy he says
[1:23:06] he had to change Tabernacles
[1:23:09] because a tabernacle that he lived in in
[1:23:12] El tabernaculous
[1:23:16] come on people vamos but the Tabernacle
[1:23:20] that he lived in had to die
[1:23:23] but it was different than that little
[1:23:26] lamb but in the first Covenant
[1:23:28] difference
[1:23:30] this lamb that died
[1:23:33] which was Jesus Christ
[1:23:36] had a life inside of it
[1:23:40] different from that little lamb
[1:23:42] difference
[1:23:43] this life could come back
[1:23:47] and pick up another Tabernacle
[1:23:51] tabernaculo or become incarnate in a man
[1:23:54] or setting
[1:23:57] foreign
[1:24:01] [Music]
[1:24:59] he's walking or or running by the side
[1:25:02] of a chariot of a unit
[1:25:06] and the eunuch is reading the book of
[1:25:11] Isaiah
[1:25:13] when he comes to the unit
[1:25:16] the question is to him you understand
[1:25:20] what you read
[1:25:23] and this is what this answer was
[1:25:26] how can I come up
[1:25:30] man that's been dipped in the blood
[1:25:34] doesn't tell me about it
[1:25:37] and so this is for the prophet of God
[1:25:40] says
[1:25:41] even though the Angels
[1:25:45] directed Philip to the unit
[1:25:48] of life
[1:25:51] that germ of Life still had to go to
[1:25:55] through the bodies
[1:25:58] a member of that box
[1:26:01] that's why we believe the blood of Jesus
[1:26:05] Christ run through the spiritual veins
