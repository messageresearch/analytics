[31:38] um I just have a little short testimony
[31:43] I went to a
[31:45] holocaust museum
[31:48] [Music]
[31:51] the Holocaust it and I saw a lot of
[31:55] things that I
[31:57] had heard this barely but I am
[32:05] but I never realized you don't know me
[32:07] if you're here just how
[32:10] traumatic it was
[32:13] for a nation
[32:17] to go through what they did but if
[32:22] uh the museum was huge and you couldn't
[32:26] just leave you had to go through a
[32:30] little
[32:31] maze Grande
[32:36] and as as the middle part of it was
[32:40] blocked so you couldn't get out of
[32:48] it it was so
[32:49] moving
[32:53] you saw people that were being dragged
[33:00] just uh dead bodies without any
[33:04] any respect to the bodies what was
[33:08] Muertos and uh and so many other things
[33:12] but what impacted me also was a poem by
[33:15] a little of a little boy
[33:22] they were given
[33:25] um very little food to eat
[33:29] in a certain country and they would have
[33:33] to
[33:34] those that were Brave would go out at
[33:37] night and steal food for their family
[33:47] and this one little boy
[33:50] um
[33:54] and there was written in his face
[33:58] who will bring the food for you tomorrow
[34:01] Mothers
[34:06] it was it was it was an experience I'm
[34:10] sorry when you experience yeah a little
[34:13] um but
[34:15] after I I left there I was I was I was
[34:20] just in tears when I left that place
[34:22] this was when the um
[34:25] thinking of all the the lack of the love
[34:30] um
[34:33] and the uncaring for those that are that
[34:37] needed help that are hurting
[34:44] and
[34:46] so he gave me this poem
[34:51] the precious
[34:56] the precious tears you left behind those
[35:01] tears were also mine
[35:04] I hold these lives that once were torn
[35:08] apart
[35:09] I heard their cries and held them to my
[35:13] heart
[35:15] each life is dear and precious to me
[35:20] I saw the secret things before they came
[35:23] to be
[35:25] the healing of the Nations will come
[35:29] the tearing Devastation shall cease and
[35:34] all be gone
[35:36] one day there will be no more
[35:39] destruction and disease
[35:42] or in my Holy Mountain love will reign

[39:38] uh
[39:40] busy week for me
[39:45] Tuesday I address the widows and Marcus
[39:50] yesterday I addressed the youth
[39:54] and today I'm
[39:57] Australia
[40:01] but I I like it when I'm busy
[40:06] what are you going to do
[40:08] especially it's been so cold where are
[40:11] you going
[40:14] and the hospitals are full with people
[40:17] with the flu
[40:20] so why do you want to go and
[40:24] you know
[40:26] better to be inside study with the word
[40:29] of God
[40:31] and be a good boy and a good person
[40:36] okay so this morning
[40:40] if you will bear with me
[40:43] and later you tighten your seat belt
[40:49] and you give me your most attention
[40:52] limit us to complete attention and we'll
[40:55] learn together
[40:57] as you can see the title of my message
[41:00] is the sights of the north side
[41:06] with the subtitles The Trail of the
[41:09] surface
[41:12] so if you would be so kind this morning
[41:17] and open your Bibles to Isaiah chapter
[41:21] 14.
[41:25] verses 12 and 13 versus
[41:31] a scripture that I taught you so many
[41:35] times
[41:38] but we're going through a different
[41:40] route yeah
[41:47] here he says how are thou Fallen
[41:52] but brother Brown says why are thou
[41:56] fallen from Heaven
[42:00] of the morning how are thou cut down to
[42:04] the ground which is weakened the Nations
[42:06] lose
[42:15] verse 13.3 for thou have said in thine
[42:19] heart I will Ascend into heaven will
[42:23] exalt my throne above the stars of God I
[42:27] will sit also upon the man of the
[42:29] congregation and the sides of the north
[42:32] two days
[42:46] his Blessing to the arena the word you
[42:49] may be seated
[42:53] foreign
[43:21] he was God's right hand man to
[43:24] Fellowship
[43:30] he got puffed up in his heart yes
[43:35] so why are thou fallen from heaven
[43:42] because Lucifer in heaven okay Lucifer
[43:46] and LCL try to exalt himself
[43:51] even be just a little higher than his
[43:54] boss happy
[43:58] he had the wrong attitude
[44:01] and
[44:03] you'll never get more of God
[44:08] until you become nothing
[44:13] you've got to get little
[44:17] before you can become big
[44:22] and Lucifer wanted to be God
[44:26] but God said
[44:29] I need you and Michael up here to help
[44:33] me
[44:37] and you still will be my son of the
[44:41] morning
[44:45] but then God descended and don't says
[44:50] and form Adam Out of the Dust for more
[44:55] Adam
[44:56] and make him a
[44:59] secondary God you know is
[45:03] when Lucifer found out this is
[45:07] God more jealous
[45:11] and he betrayed Michael yeah
[45:16] Miguel and he made himself a great
[45:19] Kingdom it is
[45:25] [Music]
[45:29] Bible says
[45:32] then how did he make himself
[45:36] uh greater kingdom come on
[45:40] we know that Satan was real crafty and
[45:44] sleight
[45:52] Heaven knowing the principles of life
[45:58] he had a lot of wisdom
[46:01] and when he was cast down to the to the
[46:05] Earth
[46:07] he got there in the garden
[46:11] and in the garden there were two trees
[46:16] one of Life
[46:19] the other of Good and Evil
[46:24] where did the evil come from
[46:28] because in heaven
[46:31] Satan had the preeminence that can
[46:34] choose first
[46:36] so
[47:36] what is happening and don't say
[47:39] contessiendo it's inspiration is
[47:43] inspiration by God for dios but Satan
[47:48] also can inspired
[47:52] and the Lord God formed Men Out of the
[47:55] Dust of the ground
[47:59] and breathe into his nostrils
[48:03] the breath of life
[48:07] and he became a living Soul
[48:12] God inspired just inspiration in other
[48:17] words
[48:24] and that was God's spirit yes
[48:29] and Satan in the serpents
[48:34] he preached the foreign
[49:04] ministers in the Apostolic Church
[49:09] who is the devil that deceived the devil
[49:15] me and Thomas
[49:17] my dad caught us
[49:20] again
[49:24] we were more green than you know what
[49:28] we couldn't answer the questions
[49:32] which was the devil did deceived the
[49:35] devil
[49:39] you heard the spirit I had way back over
[49:42] there
[49:45] foreign
[49:49] [Music]
[50:14] hahaha
[50:16] who was the devil
[50:34] one the disease that all was God himself
[50:39] let's see where we're going
[50:43] so God has said
[50:47] we have Satan preaching to if
[50:52] II Corinthians 11
[50:56] 13.
[51:01] deceiving Spirit comes
[51:08] Apostles deceitful workers transforming
[51:12] themselves into the Apostles of Christ
[51:15] for yesterday
[51:26] and no Marvel for Satan him self he
[51:35] is
[51:41] therefore is no great thing in his
[51:43] ministers also be transformed as a
[51:47] Ministers of righteousness whose end
[51:49] shall be according to their Works
[52:00] those false Apostles are his disciples
[52:05] Galatians chapter 1 verse 6 to 8.
[52:10] what was that Uno Uno
[52:15] I Marvel that you are so soon removed
[52:18] from him that call you into the grace of
[52:21] Christ unto and other Gospels
[52:34] which is not another but there will be
[52:38] some that trouble you and would pervert
[52:41] the gospel of Christ
[52:50] but though we are an angel from heaven
[52:54] preach any other gospel unto you then
[52:58] there which we have preached unto you
[53:00] let him be a curse
[53:11] you see that that the Syrian Spirit Mira
[53:14] it ISO because the Satan preaches from
[53:19] behind many prophets
[53:22] the people are received
[53:31] we were in hotel when we were in
[53:34] kuchillo if the people that have come
[53:36] under the ministry of Thomas perish
[53:39] senior we wouldn't have a church big
[53:43] enough to hold if we had all the people
[53:44] that had been under the ministry
[53:46] we will not have enough room to set them
[53:48] off so that's why are the benches
[54:02] he can say
[54:07] Satan by his inspiration
[54:12] or take the word
[54:16] how did he attack the world
[54:21] he inspired El inspiro he breathed into
[54:26] the serpent yes
[54:35] and she reasoned with him
[54:40] and you see now the trail of the serpent
[54:44] Ramirez
[54:46] the beginning
[54:53] you have two wombs then in those
[54:57] materialistes
[54:59] or the woman
[55:06] well
[55:07] we're going to explore all of us it's
[55:11] the international
[55:15] physical and spiritual
[55:19] spiritual the mind is a womb to the
[55:23] spirit is
[55:26] and you are on the basis of free moral
[55:29] agencies
[55:33] to take in or reject
[55:37] that is how if committed spiritual
[55:41] adulteries
[55:45] by the Intercourse of the Mind
[55:51] sexual
[56:28] Diablo
[56:33] no you are walking on the trail of the
[56:37] serpenters

[56:44] I am the three old the truth and the
[56:48] life
[56:53] I am the way which the way is
[57:07] your heart is
[57:17] and the seed is the gospel
[57:23] and that seed alone is foreign
[58:02] wait I mean
[58:04] what is the mind
[58:07] the world comes first to this womb it is
[58:15] because the mind is a future
[58:19] when you filter what goes from the Mind
[58:23] into yourself
[58:34] so then
[58:37] where is the mark of the beast and don't
[58:41] just press don't start La Marca de la
[58:44] Vesper does the Bible said that the mark
[58:46] of the beast is
[58:49] it it's in the forehead
[58:52] and on your right hand in Suman why on
[58:57] the forehead
[58:59] is the mind yes
[59:03] the greatest battle ever found was in
[59:06] the womb of the
[59:08] minds
[59:20] then in the womb of your heart
[59:26] the blood of Christ is
[59:33] the germ of life
[59:37] that goes into the seed
[59:41] and bring forth a newborn believer the
[59:45] entire place
[59:49] the physical womb of if
[59:54] was closed
[59:57] is
[1:00:00] could not create a blood cells
[1:00:07] in the womb of the virgin
[1:00:13] in the womb of the Virgin Mary in in
[1:00:18] Maria so he used the blood cell of the
[1:00:23] serpentus
[1:00:26] which have the term of life
[1:00:31] and it opened the womb of if yes
[1:00:42] and deceived
[1:00:46] and the tree produce King yes
[1:00:58] Mexico oh
[1:01:01] um
[1:01:06] like a dog is going to the street and
[1:01:09] trying to find somebody to give him
[1:01:10] something to eat so in other words the
[1:01:12] mongrel was not a pedigree it's the
[1:01:16] Pedro Mexico
[1:01:18] Peregrine means pure bread
[1:01:23] because Cain was not there is
[1:01:44] multiply and replace
[1:02:17] La Novia
[1:02:19] what year Carlos where are you
[1:02:23] watch here miraki
[1:02:26] and when the womb of Eve opened
[1:02:32] and the serpenter relations
[1:02:50] the portal and Gates of Hell were opened
[1:02:56] because Eve was inspired by Satan's
[1:03:05] we can say there were 400
[1:03:10] .
[1:03:14] they were inspired and inspirados all in
[1:03:18] one Accord
[1:03:20] and they prophesied
[1:03:24] but Jehoshaphat said momento
[1:03:31] I haven't been taught like that
[1:03:36] what kind of inspiration do you have The
[1:03:41] Inspirations death
[1:03:44] notice the kind of inspiration of any
[1:03:47] ministers
[1:03:50] teaching here only tapes
[1:03:56] for you people I don't know all of you
[1:03:59] heard the message of our founding Pastor
[1:04:02] Wednesdays
[1:04:07] if you were not in church I hope you
[1:04:09] were online here in there in English
[1:04:21] he said and it it has to be somebody who
[1:04:26] knows where he's standing is
[1:04:31] if a church doesn't have an Apostles
[1:04:42] so you people are the most privileged
[1:04:45] people yes
[1:04:56] we are so privileged that he left
[1:04:59] everything in order for us
[1:05:04] if you hear tremendous message from
[1:05:07] behind this problem
[1:05:10] you can thank our founding persons
[1:05:15] which was an apostle of Jesus Christ
[1:05:23] no
[1:05:26] [Applause]
[1:05:28] many ministers and people don't like to
[1:05:30] hear something like that
[1:05:32] is
[1:05:41] two scriptures
[1:05:43] on Second Corinthians and Galatians
[1:05:51] comes among the people as an angel of
[1:05:55] Life
[1:06:01] his name was Lucifer is
[1:06:04] the one that carries the light

[1:08:03] it's like the we are supposed to be the
[1:08:06] Moon
[1:08:08] La Luna we are the ones that give light
[1:08:12] in the absence of the sun
[1:08:15] Reflections

[1:08:36] and Sangre
[1:08:39] I preached on that before yeah
[1:08:43] have you forgot
[1:08:47] we are in an exodus
[1:08:51] from the Moon
[1:08:57] I'm a
[1:08:59] you know why
[1:09:01] the time will come
[1:09:05] remember in chapter 12 of Revelation
[1:09:09] there was a woman clothed with the sun
[1:09:14] who is that woman
[1:09:18] we're on the red Exodus is
[1:09:33] a foolish version
[1:09:36] they have to be murdered
[1:09:40] in the Great Tribulation

[1:10:01] further than the weather is

[1:10:09] commences
[1:10:10] you see the evening star is
[1:10:20] the evening
[1:10:26] they are not two different stories
[1:10:34] and the name of those stars
[1:10:38] is Venus
[1:10:41] the goddess of love
[1:10:45] because none of you or myself
[1:11:04] because I can preach real hard okay
[1:11:09] how many
[1:11:12] and why do I pick on you Andrea okay I'm
[1:11:15] gonna pick a new rules
[1:11:19] Ruby Ruby how many keys does the piano

[1:11:28] Andrea tell your friends
[1:11:36] Ethan you play the piano how many keys
[1:11:42] foreign
[1:12:10] [Music]
[1:12:18] know them that go clockwise
[1:12:25] but you know what
[1:12:30] I'll go with the other 79.
[1:12:50] people follow the other doctrines
[1:12:54] that's why we have to go
[1:12:56] counterclockwise
[1:13:01] Amen on my mind
[1:13:07] one goes against the green one
[1:13:12] and that's you yes
[1:13:16] not deceived by an Angel Of Life
[1:13:21] look at their teachings and answers you
[1:13:25] know and and me and the founding pastor
[1:13:27] at first we we were with them
[1:13:32] because we didn't know better
[1:13:35] oh no brother Branham is coming in a in
[1:13:40] a tent Ministry
[1:13:45] he's coming in uh can you imagine
[1:13:50] in a canvas 10.
[1:14:05] when Moses and their God of course Moses
[1:14:09] didn't go into the promised land
[1:14:13] but when the Israelites God to the
[1:14:16] promised land
[1:14:19] they did away with tempered knuckle in
[1:14:22] the desert
[1:14:25] and brothers
[1:14:34] and it was not a tent of canvas
[1:14:39] I am the 10th you're sorry I am the 10th
[1:14:45] I am the 10th you are the yeah
[1:15:18] he said he would have to pray in first
[1:15:21] to drive the the spirits because they
[1:15:24] used to have rock and roll concerts and
[1:15:26] and dances so he had to pray to get
[1:15:29] those Spirits out of there
[1:15:31] is
[1:15:44] this it helps my my not his preaching he
[1:15:49] says to pray for the sicks and
[1:15:52] discernment it's better in attention
[1:16:00] and it'll be only for
[1:16:02] church services but
[1:16:11] thank God also Ministries
[1:16:16] that you are only supposed to hear tapes
[1:16:19] of William Brothers
[1:16:24] Urbana
[1:16:34] then quite in the fivefold ministry did
[1:16:37] he put teachers
[1:16:42] because men they can hear things
[1:16:46] and just believe what they want is
[1:16:49] and that's why they are deceived foreign
[1:16:58] [Music]
[1:17:06] so then
[1:17:08] entrances
[1:17:10] a lying Spirit came up and said
[1:17:16] let me go down
[1:17:19] all Inspire those ministers your
[1:17:22] Inspirations those pastors
[1:17:26] those teachers estos maestros those that
[1:17:29] call themselves Apostles in this message
[1:17:34] okay don't get me wrong they are great
[1:17:37] men
[1:17:41] educated Educators tremendous speakers
[1:17:48] I could not even hold
[1:17:51] I mean there are speakers that I don't
[1:17:54] even come close to them
[1:17:57] [Music]
[1:17:59] I mean you you've heard them you said
[1:18:03] they and by the way they Minister
[1:18:08] let's face it
[1:18:12] they love and this is not throwing a
[1:18:15] nobody yes
[1:18:20] people like to hear ministers they can
[1:18:23] preach a hundred miles an hour
[1:18:28] and you guys that preached like that
[1:18:30] there is nothing wrong with them
[1:18:35] if if I if I did then I would have the
[1:18:38] wrong spirit
[1:18:40] is and if I would criticize I have no
[1:18:44] business behind this is
[1:18:48] your gift because God is
[1:18:54] you know he likes black people
[1:18:57] brown people
[1:18:59] white people you know
[1:19:24] the difference is
[1:19:32] for his place
[1:19:37] like many flowers together come on
[1:19:44] flowers for him the Flores and he'll
[1:19:48] take him away from the earth
[1:19:51] take them up
[1:19:54] in a place under the altar
[1:19:58] where those flowers will never Wilt or
[1:20:01] turn
[1:20:09] like I said
[1:20:12] and there's people even in in our midst
[1:20:16] of Medias who have a gift
[1:20:19] I wish I could preach like some of you
[1:20:23] know
[1:20:29] that's not my Ministry you know but I I
[1:20:32] love to hear the news
[1:20:36] and that attracts a lot of people yes
[1:20:40] and they think that if you don't preach
[1:20:42] like that hey Lego princesses
[1:20:47] because let's face it
[1:20:49] really is
[1:20:52] Emilio I'm more clear than clear
[1:20:56] yeah
[1:20:58] I'm just very very Frank very clear now
[1:21:02] Simmons
[1:21:05] we were born with nothing
[1:21:11] if it's black I'm gonna call it black
[1:21:17] s Blanco
[1:21:21] I mean I'm not gonna be back as a puppet
[1:21:24] and tell you a lie you know Western
[1:21:26] artists
[1:21:28] but let's face it
[1:21:31] sometimes
[1:21:33] teaching can be true
[1:21:39] it's okay yeah
[1:21:42] but you know what
[1:21:44] teaching will put you in your position
[1:21:48] and the devil hates it when you get to
[1:21:52] your position
[1:21:55] and when you get to your position
[1:21:59] no devil in hell can move
[1:22:06] amen and I'm gonna leave it there
[1:22:10] so this premise because
[1:22:17] and by their inspiration in person
[1:22:20] inspiration uh people believe a wrong
[1:22:23] Doctrine is
[1:22:27] given power to control everything
[1:22:37] he lost his conscious
[1:22:41] of what God put him here for on Earth
[1:22:47] he lost all the plumbing Sterling
[1:22:51] started in the gray in the brain
[1:22:57] he said Plumbing without Plumbing I'm
[1:22:59] gonna make sure I got there right
[1:23:02] listen
[1:23:03] because because when you are dying
[1:23:06] foreign
[1:23:45] you don't reason no more
[1:23:49] it's your soul is
[1:23:52] been in your heart
[1:23:56] and you grieved away instead
[1:24:01] because you have five senses
[1:24:10] which was made by the egg of a woman
[1:24:18] so the serpenter
[1:24:21] evil one El maligno is the outside man
[1:24:26] is
[1:24:32] a spirit
[1:24:34] too which when you are born on those
[1:24:37] dead in town says it was not given by
[1:24:41] God
[1:24:42] it was only permitted
[1:24:48] because that's the spirit is of a
[1:24:53] worldly nature yes
[1:24:55] that is why you were born in sins
[1:25:00] so that person inside of you is
[1:25:05] a sinner to begin with
[1:25:09] and it also has five inlets
[1:25:21] Etc
[1:25:23] you do not think Cristiano piensa or
[1:25:27] have conscience with your body or tennis
[1:25:29] consensus
[1:25:31] it has no mental faculties because
[1:25:48] foreign
[1:25:50] [Music]
[1:26:22] that is why foreign
[1:26:45] [Music]
[1:26:57] I never not even when I was all in the
[1:27:00] world did I know how to dance
[1:27:07] in the midst there anyway
[1:27:12] I look to see yeah but I always go to
[1:27:17] the dentist in yuffie
[1:27:20] and I just like to dance the walls
[1:27:23] because I didn't know how to dance
[1:27:28] I wish I would be like Cami and uh and
[1:27:32] uh said they condensed even in here yeah
[1:27:39] uh
[1:27:40] no longer we can say
[1:27:43] people can dance in the experience
[1:27:50] go to church in the
[1:27:53] spiritual and can absolutely have the
[1:27:57] real spirit of God here absolutely
[1:27:59] maintaining the spiritual reality are
[1:28:01] anointed on that Spirit on kingdom sobre
[1:28:04] is
[1:28:05] still be lost
[1:28:13] two on that one
[1:28:16] people just because they dance or
[1:28:19] speaking in English
[1:28:23] and let me say it again
[1:28:26] and you were in the spirit
[1:28:30] dance and Shout in violence and come
[1:28:35] here in the spirit
[1:28:37] are anointed but there is
[1:28:41] still be lost and devil possessed
[1:28:45] foreign
[1:29:05] see that's why you come to church to
[1:29:08] learn English
[1:29:14] don't get scared
[1:29:16] don't get scared and start going out of
[1:29:19] the church yeah
[1:29:34] it's the little soul it's just
[1:29:37] on the inside of that spirit and then
[1:29:41] through this spiritual yes
[1:29:46] how did the spirit on the outside
[1:29:51] between the soul and the body
[1:29:56] can be absolutely Anointed
[1:30:01] with the Holy ghosts
[1:30:05] so then the Soul is predestinated
[1:30:11] so they can anoint this Spirit
[1:30:16] to make the outside body but a circle
[1:30:21] come into subjection to that spirit
[1:30:25] is
[1:30:27] the holy spirit can anoint a man is
[1:30:46] it with the Holy Spirit
[1:30:50] and your soul is dark as pitch is
[1:30:59] because the same water
[1:31:02] that falls under which
[1:31:06] also falls under
[1:31:11] notice the trail of the surface
[1:31:16] going into all you know that trail of
[1:31:19] the surface
[1:31:22] he goes into all your houses
[1:31:28] including mine including La Mia and many
[1:31:32] of us
[1:31:33] we put a welcome met to the circle
[1:31:40] I told you many times
[1:31:43] there's her there's more
[1:31:46] period don't die Master spiritus it's in
[1:31:50] Walmart it's in a Walmart it's a store
[1:31:53] that everybody visits is
[1:31:58] those are hitchhikers Daniel yes
[1:32:02] if you let them you'll bring them to the
[1:32:05] house
[1:32:10] and then the wife gets enough
[1:32:13] squabble with a husband
[1:32:17] where did those spirits come from
[1:32:19] spiritus
[1:32:32] is your life worthy of the Gods
[1:32:36] is the life worthy of to me of the
[1:32:40] Gospel
[1:32:44] we all must examine ourselves here
[1:32:49] I cannot answer for you
[1:32:51] or you answer for me
[1:32:54] we are here
[1:32:56] so God
[1:32:59] can help us
[1:33:02] for us to be an example to the people or
[1:33:06] our relatives
[1:33:10] as we're gonna find out
[1:33:19] some of you don't even know that you
[1:33:21] have the Holy Ghost is
[1:33:26] and you put a welcome mat to to the to
[1:33:31] Satan it upon is
[1:33:34] because the Bible says the sin lies
[1:33:44] the serpent enters in your conscious
[1:33:50] you're trying to sleep
[1:33:54] and a lot of times you can't in music
[1:33:57] because you're in a nightmare okay
[1:34:02] you've seen hideous things
[1:34:06] just like the sinner
[1:34:09] when The Sinner dies
[1:34:12] he cannot go to the presence of God
[1:34:16] because he's a sinner
[1:34:18] he cannot return back to Earth
[1:34:22] because his time is up okay
[1:34:27] his heart between two things
[1:34:31] in the fifth dimensions
[1:34:38] and he cannot go in the presence of God
[1:34:42] because he is not covered by the blood
[1:34:45] okay
[1:34:49] he cannot wake himself
[1:34:53] because his time is
[1:34:58] here on Earth
[1:35:07] how many here have nightmares
[1:35:13] laughs
[1:35:15] I knew that you were not going to raise
[1:35:17] your your hand yes
[1:35:22] but I was talking the world I had a lot
[1:35:24] of nightmares
[1:35:27] and if some of you were truthful you
[1:35:29] would raise your hand yes
[1:35:33] that's all right you know we're humans
[1:35:39] they can say
[1:35:43] he's in a tormented Nightmare
[1:35:47] and you have
[1:35:49] a nightmare is
[1:35:53] when the two countries
[1:35:57] are passing is
[1:36:00] you self-conscious
[1:36:02] and the first conscious
[1:36:06] and it catches between
[1:36:10] media so when a sinner dies
[1:36:14] he's caught with his soul is
[1:36:19] between Earth and health and
[1:36:24] a nightmare
[1:36:28] why has all this happened foreign
[1:37:01] uh 13.
[1:37:04] no I'm sorry you're right
[1:37:06] just Howard thou falling from Heaven All

[1:37:11] are thou cut down to the ground which

[1:37:35] upon the amount of the congregation in
[1:37:39] the sight of the north is
[1:37:55] notice where the congregation of God is
[1:38:03] where Satan wanted to go is
[1:38:08] saying look 10 18. son Lucas yes
[1:38:14] yocho
[1:38:16] and he said unto them I beheld sane as
[1:38:20] Lightning falling from heaven
[1:38:29] what
[1:38:31] causes lightning
[1:38:35] you know what causes lightning okay
[1:38:39] when two clouds called light under those
[1:38:43] so which two clouds colliders
[1:38:51] it was Lucifer and Michael him they
[1:38:54] collided Lucifer images
[1:39:01] and you felt like lightning
[1:39:07] and the lightning bolts that fall more
[1:39:11] often Los Angeles
[1:39:20] so how why was The Cloud of Lucifer
[1:39:23] negative
[1:39:26] because Michael took all the torch out
[1:39:30] of him
[1:39:32] but he wanted to go back up to the sides
[1:39:36] of the north
[1:39:38] so how was he gonna go if his Cloud had
[1:39:43] not charged in him
[1:39:48] already taken out of all he started
[1:39:56] so when lightning comes down
[1:39:59] where does most of the lightning strikes
[1:40:04] started
[1:40:08] so it is a negative vote it is
[1:40:18] on transmission line
[1:40:24] or the
[1:40:27] electricity power lines
[1:40:31] so they will not be charged get inside
[1:40:35] takes the negative ball is
[1:40:40] when it hit
[1:40:44] also hits one of the things that he hits
[1:40:47] the most are the trees is
[1:40:52] so he could not hit the tree of Earth
[1:40:59] if he would have tried to hit Adam
[1:41:04] he would have exploded
[1:41:07] because he would have been aligned it or
[1:41:10] had over a million volts
[1:41:19] and there was if
[1:41:22] well you said well she didn't have no
[1:41:24] power instead is wait a minute
[1:41:30] where
[1:41:31] he Adam needed a help mate
[1:41:37] so when they took the river out of him
[1:41:43] God gave adam a help mate yes
[1:41:55] she was to help me
[1:41:59] and he could do what Adam did
[1:42:04] but when Satan came down
[1:42:08] he hit that tree
[1:42:12] and do you know
[1:42:14] there's many trees
[1:42:17] are resistant to a lightning bolt it's a
[1:42:21] resistance
[1:42:23] [Music]
[1:42:25] nothing will happen
[1:42:28] but have you ever seen a tree
[1:42:32] that's broken in heaven
[1:42:35] because it's our tree
[1:42:37] has the resistance
[1:42:49] it boils the self in that tree
[1:42:53] what happens
[1:43:04] and you've seen many trees like this is
[1:43:13] and took the charge that she had
[1:43:18] and then if gave to it to Adam
[1:43:30] and it was transferred do
[1:43:34] the serpent but
[1:43:40] foreign
[1:43:58] the second Bible
[1:44:01] the pyramid
[1:44:04] and in the king's chamber yeah
[1:44:08] there is a chef an opening
[1:44:12] pointing straight to the Polaris
[1:44:16] or the North Stars
[1:44:19] because there are a lot of stars
[1:44:23] but only one true story is
[1:44:29] set in the center of the earth
[1:44:34] the North Star never moves
[1:44:38] an accomplice
[1:44:40] always points to True North
[1:44:46] and if you have the Holy Spirit is
[1:44:51] always points to the sides of the North
[1:44:54] to the word of God
[1:44:59] never points to a denomination
[1:45:02] because denominations are like other
[1:45:05] stars
[1:45:08] they shift like the world he says
[1:45:25] but we know it is
[1:45:28] a little deeper how do you say a little
[1:45:31] deeper
[1:45:32] and Laos menu
[1:45:42] it says
[1:45:51] the head of the handle yeah I think the
[1:45:55] month
[1:45:57] is a no star is
[1:46:05] here to mention just a few so let me
[1:46:08] take it
[1:46:09] look at where the power is
[1:46:17] in the first two Wars World War one and
[1:46:20] World War two
[1:46:22] years
[1:46:24] a country that borders Russia which is
[1:46:27] the King of the North yeah
[1:46:34] Germany alemania
[1:46:36] are North Germany borders Russia
[1:46:44] after the 40s in the 50s is
[1:46:50] the U.S went to war with Korea Korea
[1:46:56] but North Korea made the United States
[1:47:00] General North Korea is
[1:47:03] then we're going to the 60s
[1:47:08] and they went to Vietnam
[1:47:11] and North Vietnam made the United States
[1:47:14] get out in North Vietnam is
[1:47:22] Satan is reigning on the side of the
[1:47:24] Lord
[1:47:28] well the last time the north won
[1:47:32] is when we had
[1:47:34] a Christian
[1:47:38] Presidente Cristiano Abraham Lincoln
[1:47:40] Abraham Lincoln in the North in the
[1:47:43] Civil War the north Peterson
[1:47:50] and the North Star is only visible in
[1:47:53] the northern hemisphere
[1:47:59] because it cannot be used for navigation
[1:48:03] south of the Equator
[1:48:09] and on the Tabernacle in the Wilderness
[1:48:15] Camp on the North
[1:48:20] what was the banner on the sides of the
[1:48:23] north
[1:48:25] it was the eagle
[1:48:28] so now as you look at the first Bible in
[1:48:33] the zodiacs
[1:48:36] on the sides of the north
[1:48:39] there is two constellations side by side
[1:48:44] the constellation of the agila the
[1:48:48] constellation the constellation of the
[1:48:50] ego and the constellation of serpent
[1:48:54] areas
[1:48:59] both on the sides of the Lord
[1:49:04] where did this message come from
[1:49:08] the North Del Norte North America North
[1:49:12] America
[1:49:14] and to finish
[1:49:15] where is true
[1:49:18] refugeot where is my refuge understand
[1:49:22] The Book of Psalms
[1:49:25] chapter 48 verse 1.
