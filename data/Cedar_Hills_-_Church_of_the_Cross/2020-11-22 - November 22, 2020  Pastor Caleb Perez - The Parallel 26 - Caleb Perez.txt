shackles were broken jesus is here jesus is here brothers i want to say this [Music] [Music] greetings brothers and sisters i would like to first share with you our history so you'll know us a little better the founder of cedar hills tabernacle pastor thomas bettis senior is my brother-in-law he was married to my sister biola i am writing this short testimony to tell you how great our god is my wife and i on october 31st were traveling on a rural highway near sivir city new mexico the town where our founding pastor first established his church it was approximately 5 45 a.m and still dark when we came upon two horses crossing the highway doing approximately 65 miles an hour with no warning and no time to stop we slammed into both horses killing them we totaled our truck but by the grace of god we walked away with just minor aches and bruises we covet your prayers for god's will to be done in our lives and by god's grace we will be able to help our pastor on the great work he's doing in africa may god bless you brother louis and sister marianne [Music] [Applause] your feet i love to tell the story we don't need music we'll just we just sing it from our hearts i love to tell the story [Music] of jesus and his amen we're so grateful to god this morning to make us part of his great plan the assertive i have one more testimony before i get into the message from brother tim garcia tim garcia he wrote this and asked if i would read it it simply reads like this on sunday morning after the message caleb was asking if anyone here had anyone has that has never given their heart to the lord would you raise your hand and then i went on to say i've got i i want i've got to make sure make sure that i'm right gotta make sure that the covenant is for me that i'm included in that covenant you ever given your heart to the lord you want to give your heart to the lord at this time this is of course as i was talking even sister mary lou would you put your hand on your daughter mary lou what is would you put your hand on your daughter and if you notice he says the holy spirit never called her out by name the young girl that included my daughter yes so we're thankful to god this morning for that [Applause] in other places and wow does bless our hearts if we knew everything that god was doing all the time wow we'd be raptured out i think we'd be raptured out of here amen good to see each and every one of you sister shania god bless you sir nice to have you here with us amen well we have sung we have heard the testimonies it says and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and have made us kings and priests brother says in a message it doesn't say and has made me a king and a priest and a he said it he made us that's including you and i including he made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever amen yes may god add his blessings to the reign of his word you may be seated oh i pray that the holy spirit would come at this moment and just just take over and just give us the words of life that we have need of today how many are ready to receive something from the lord what a tremendous scripture we find here once again it doesn't say that he will make us in the future i want you to really note that once again it does not say that he will make us priests and kings already made us kings and priests notice once again he hath made us i did not do anything to deserve to be a king or a priest by his grace and his mercy on our lives that opposed i want to know if you can give god a clap offering this morning for doing that made us kings and priests yes and what she is it does not say here who he is it's not if the church or the bride recognizes who she is when she get a true once again it is what she is without if you majority of people today would answer i would rather be a king because man always wants to be in charge they always want somebody to be their subjects watch this now character is a victory not a gift card and a man without character cannot reign because power apart from character points foreign [Applause] and since he wants us to share even his throne him and the little temporary sufferings that we go through now it is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation kings and priests as i look at this scripture i find that a king and a priest are two very different people very two very different offices diferentes they dress different different they act different different they talk different different they have two totally different purposes god has made us two totally different men different totally different offices diferentes yet in the scriptures i find kings that try to perform the duties of a priest because it was it was such as i said two different offices and they were not to cross over to what the other one was very important to understand today in first samuel 13 you don't have to turn to it but we find that samuel had given saul a time and appointed time when he was going to come and after samuel did not arrive there in gilgal he condoned first thing samuel tells saul follows the king samuel daniel looks at him and says what hast thou done is what did you do casey is this you're a king it is a ray what are you doing offering doing something that doesn't pertain to you and samuel said to saul you have done foolishly thou has not kept the commandment of the lord thy god that he had commanded because if you would have the lord would have established thy kingdom upon israel forever you would have been a there would have been a descendant of kings come forth from you know you would have king we find out in second chronicles 26 and second chronicles by the name of uzziah we all know these and i i don't want to i don't want to spend a lot of time in this no kiddo but it says when usaiah was strong it seems like that's when a lot of men get into trouble it seems that that's when a lot of people get into trouble when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his destruction he transgressed against god and went into the temple of the lord and he burned he was the priest at that time and they told him that burning instance unto the lord sacrifice here is some priest telling him you've just trespassed in your own kingdom because a king tried to be a priest why was it so wrong because god had set aside the seed of aaron to be the priest unto the children of israel that no stranger which is not of the seed of aaron come near to offer incense unto the lord you were not of the seed of aaron you were not to offer incense yes and thou shalt appoint aaron and his sons and they shall wait on the priest's office office and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be putin do you see that when we enter into uh an office that don't pertain to us strangers we are that the stranger cometh not a territory that angels fear to trot and i believe that that's why matthew seven tells us in that day lord lord have we not prophesied and you're not prophetic we better know what we're doing we better know what god has called us for now you might say well brother he says i find in first kings that solomon said the bible says that solomon burned some offerings the burnt offering and peace offerings he burned incense upon the altar as a king let me tell you you've got to read the whole story of solomon to know even though it has that solomon burned incense he did not do it on his own instructed the priest to do it now watch this now the requirements of a king let's go to deuteronomy 17. these are the requirements of a king and i'm going to read it just in english to save some time here when thou art come unto the land which the lord thy god giveth thee and shall possess it and shall shall dwell therein and shall say i will set a king over me like as all the nations that are about me thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee whom the lord thy god shall choose not your choosing whom the lord our god shall choose one from among your brethren in other words this could not be somebody that came from the outside in estonia one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee thou mayest not set a stranger over thee oh there's a stranger again which is not thy brother and it shall be when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the levites and it shall be with him and he shall read therein all the days of his life that's what a king is supposed to do that he may learn to fear the lord his god to keep all the words of this law and these statutes to do them that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren wow that there's a lot there there's a lot here why because there are spirits that that come up right and that's when people began to feel like they are better or superior than their brothers but if you keep the law you read it every day what will it do it'll keep you from from your heart being lifted up above your brother i'm going to read the word every day you can listen to it every day if you did if you asked then you would never think that you're better than your brother and then he turn aside from the commandment to the right hand or to the left to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom he and his children in the midst of israel my goodness now we see that a king and a priest each had things to maintain in their offices that they were called and as i i asked the question this to this this to brother aaron and sister abigail abigail and i said but even though a king couldn't be a priest would be a king but in the old testament i do find one person who king of salem and priest of the most high god oh i like that this morning i love that this morning because and through it all through the pipes and the shadows melchizedek was a pre-figure of jesus christ now notice this now he was king of salem and he was priest of the most high god who met abram returning from the slaughter of the king and he blessed him once again melchizedek was a pre-figure of the lord jesus christ what was it that the kinsmen redeemer that was coming after the order so also christ glorified not himself but he that said unto him thou art my son today have i begotten thee and he saith also in another place we know that there is much dispute about this person melchizedek is it was not just a priesthood he and he ate what was that order he could be both king and priest i'm going to let that one set just for a moment i'm going to say it again this is the order of melchizedek i'll let that one set just for a little while what an order okay or then to not just be a king my goodness dios mio after the order of melchizedek that phrase is spoken seven times in the bible once in the old testament six times in the new testament a priest under the old testament order never sat down how many know that they never sat down a priest in the old testament always standing up doing work in the throat during the sacrifices they were always moving in order christ being after the order of could not listen closely could not be made perfect nope under the blood of bulls and ghosts same thing you did [Music] because that's what i'm here for to help you but i can tell you exactly what the problem is year after year after year the same thing those priests never sat down was never finished but the worshiper now under a new covenant the worshiper wants purge sitting at the right hand of the father what is it are you orders i hope you get that this morning it's a new order a new day estonia that's the kind of god we serve today we have a high priest oh i want you to tell your neighbors we oh how god is so good watch this now hebrews 10. evidence yes and every priest verse 11 every priest standeth daily ministering what is he doing ending daily ministering and offering often times the same sacrifices which can never take away sins after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever yes get down on the right hand of god and under this new order making intercessions here i can't run with it i'm trying to run but oh god lots of different places churches everything else but there is only one group of people that can accomplish being both a king and a priest their names are written on the lamb's book of life i don't know about you but just say neighbor we are kings and priests watch this now till he hath made us kings and priests timothy 2 12 if we suffer i see people oh my gosh they're closing us down again oh my gosh i don't know how many audios have you been relying on your own skills that's been relying on god this whole time how am i going to make it you're a king you're a priest what is this a joke the priests didn't worry about where they were going to get their money from el reynolds i didn't worry about where they were going to get their next meal god had provided a way to camino priest if we suffer everyone wants to reign without suffering in their minds they want to be on a throne under high horse reigning and ruling hernandez but you have to learn to rule your own atmosphere first you gotta learn how to rule your own house hello everybody hello you got to rule your own spirit the bible says you gotta be able to rule or take care of your own vessel this and it starts by you presenting your body a living sacrifice of a priest you cannot reign as a king watch now let's find out what kind of sacrifices we are to offer real quick i'm going to read it just in english hebrews 13 15. by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name second first peter 2 5 he also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ romans 12 1 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service once again a king rules and a priest yes something that's very fascinating to me that i found very fascinating because we always think of the priesthood we see that god has placed man oh we understand there's offices his place don't get me wrong watch how i'm how i'm putting this official but every person in the kingdom was to be a priest what he wanted but watch watch what happened here take my word for i'm going to give you scripture exodus 19. 5 and 6. now therefore if ye will obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant then you shall be a peculiar treasure who what do you mean that you don't have no money you're a peculiar treasure within yourself you're a peculiar treasure unto me above all people i'm going to say it again and you shall be unto me a kingdom of priests not a temple of priests kingdom of priest here he's joining together the kingship with the priesthood you shall be a kingdom of priest and a holy nation these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of israel to all the children of israel this was god's plan for israel to be a kingdom of priests but ye are a chosen generation let's shall be a kingly priesthood that's why revelation 19 16 says he hath on his name and on his thy name written king of kings and lord of lords how many kings and priests do we have here king of kings and lord of lords but we must reign in life right now this is the problem to me that that when i when i talk to people it's the problem in their mind everything is we're gonna be kings and priests we are kings and priests now thomas raised us we must reign now now brother branham says now n-o-w we are spiritual kings and we reign over a spiritual kingdom watch this now our bodies are groaning and we have an inheritance offering spiritual sacrifice what does the priest do makes a sacrifice that's a sacrificial what is a spiritual sacrifice that's what these sons and daughters do which but they're making sacrifices offering to god spiritual sacrifices sacrificial spirituality i just don't feel like praising him no more is that anybody here today he got a little bit quiet right there anybody here i just don't feel like i just don't feel like it no you say brother brown i just don't feel like praising him that's the time to make the sacrifice i don't feel like it oh no i just want to sit home sit down and watch a movie because i need to relax that's a time to make a sacrifice don't forget yeah you're a priest hello everybody we forget every day that we're priests acting watch this now i don't feel like it offer it now oh we have one mediator but we as priests should be interceding petitioning every day not just when we need something from god oh we need something from god lord oh restored i come to you now you're already off no we don't need nothing from god we don't even pray we don't know what a priest is supposed to be doing watch this now and has made us priests priests unto him forgive me priest unto him myself nobody but me that dwelleth inside of me offering spiritual praise my lips spending our lives come on now here we go spending our lives as a sweet offering unto him come on [Music] friends sweet offering spending our lives we spend our lives all the time we spend our lives on fighting and you so and so and you're no good for nothing because the worshiper in he has made us kings and priests spending our lives as a sweet offering unto him the high priest of our confession what are you confessing who here can say i'm confessing that i'm a king and a priest in your hands hello everybody he said pray for someone else make your confession lord i guess that's my father that's my sister lord let them be a king and a priest you're going to say it becomes your confessions and he we have a high priest of our confession for our brothers what are you confessing how long i've been going but i don't care this morning because i'm gonna finish what i got here when he permits sickness to come into your homes let me see how many can do that good very good can you worship him even when distress comes can you still worship him even when financial prop troubles come well come on now vamos let me ask you a question then why does financial hardships cause fights between husbands and wives if you're relying on him why are you fighting with him why are you fighting with the husband kind of changes huh i don't know why would i have no money for nothing you need to get a fifth job i don't know what you're doing somebody got to say let's trust the lord alien david [Applause] we are can you still function as a king and a priest even in hard times takes character character let's say it again it takes character uh amen in hard times your sweet words still come out of your mouth hello everybody hello sweet words still come out of your mouth and now yes countdown if he is a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities he's the same yesterday today and forever the way the woman touched his garment out of him he looked at the acted yesterday now being that he don't have a corporal body on earth he works through that el trabajo you're a christian because you believe you're a christian christian and it's all settled you know why it was how many people believe you're a christian christian let me see your hands because look on fiesta that's what you are yes any man will never live any farther or higher quake than what he believes he's living you take a man that's always talking about drinking hablas about drinking pizza he talks about drinking habla de tartomando he falls down into that category you found a man that's thinking about vulgar things and thinks about vulgar things he's vogue that's vulgarity that's what he becomes once again i am a king and i am a priest you have a high priest of your confession watch numbers 14 28. and god saying say unto them as truly as i live saith the lord as ye have spoken in my ears so will i do to you amen lord hear me lord oh yes i know i'm not worthy lord yo but lord make me a king and a priest say can i have a few

are you ready come on your undivided attention for the next 15 minutes or so let's see how we're supposed to act spiritual this is the message seven church ages daniel sent this to me i thank him for that god bless him spiritual priesthood royal nation spiritual offering wow but when a little confusion comes in the church listen closely here when a little confusion goes on goes on in the church the way they're sit at your home gatherings with your families and speak about everybody familiar i don't like no questions about the minister nobody was talking and i don't like this come on pastor

who's our enemy why are we so tired on wednesdays at 7 o'clock now we're talking about priests and kings don't stop there hey no para e i just don't feel like taking a part in the service yo brother branham says better man around this day but you're a priest making a sacrifice a sacrificial a spiritual sacrament sacrificial spirituality it's you making the spiritual sacrifice sacrificial roots of your can i go on church oh watch what he says here well that's just for the ministry for the ministry we know that i'm just a housewife watch this now i'm just a young person i'm just a student or a custodian or whatever you want you're not a jew there is no king or priest that is just a king or just a priest everyone says this is the power of decisions that includes children essentially young people parents fathers grandparents whatever you are everyone in the new testament that becomes a christian as and we give god the sacrifices of our lips you say i don't feel like it is do it anyhow oh come on we gotta think like a priest you know why we don't think that way many movies come on now we've ruined the children because they get entertained so much at home get to church this is boring no superheroes let me see look down the clock but i have a little clock oh i got all kinds of time i i don't feel like it no thing we're gonna do it anyway i would listen to a table i'm so tired i just got to go to sleep i want to leave i don't want to go to church i'm just a little too tired devil will tell you that he takes you to hell somehow church i want you to listen closely somehow some way we think the longer we've been in church the longer we've been christians special rights especially oh come on we all get that outage i've been in church 40 years old i can have an attitude and i can talk about whoever i want well because i've been a christian a long time but you might have been a church goer a long time but that ain't a priest are you with me somebody somebody gotta shout amen we don't have special rights because we've been in church so long nothing is oh well i'd go to church and i'd praise the lord if i felt like it he said yo yo well now a priest will make the sacrifice church well you don't know because they talked about me there buenos dinosa under me but you're a priest and a priest doesn't react the way other people hello everybody well they talked about me so i'm going to talk about them and a priest a priest doesn't melt bad mouth and back well i'm just hurt you're a priest conduct yourself as one conduct we a priest doesn't take their feelings into consideration he's a priest he gets the feelings he is touched by the feelings of their or our infirmities well i don't agree with this or that you know but you're my husband and wife don't treat me right but i'm afraid of the pandemic i'm afraid of everything that's going on or we are after the order the problem is what's coming from your heart to your lips that was a doctor in a time of a war dealing with dysentery patience really didn't whatever they said but the next question show me your tongue because the tongue showed the doctor condition of the patient i'm here to tell you it's not that our tongue and what comes from it of your heart you're a high priest or not you want to be like everyone else they said this so i said this this year watch it [Music] is [Music] when it's used wrong it's a breach and that's solomon talks about it by lips oh my spouse oh miss poster you stay kings and what is coming forth from your lips giving praises to his name by lips oh my spouse they drop as the honeycomb isn't the holy ghost the promised land and isn't that land of land flowing with milk and honey yes where is it flowing from down the floor from her lips the beauty of the promised land is seen in the bride especially in her tongue and lips she doesn't retaliate she doesn't speak evil of no one she's a priest what else could i do to bring this message to you some people just sit there and say wow still with me oh kings and priests that's what she is the beauty is in her tongue and lips i think it was abraham lincoln that said this if i were to write a book about all the bad things that people said about me and i would listen to all those bad things i would never perform in the highest office of the united states of america if we listen to every bad thing that everybody has to say because when he has a book of memories and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey where does that sweet honey come from from the holy ghost and the holy ghost give me the little book and i took the book and i ate it it was in my mouth sweetest honey but in my stomach it was bitter i'm going to say it again brother will would you come to the piano that's a priest i'm going to say it again take the message if i had some more time this is what i'm just going to give you a little insight of what i would go to right now i'm
