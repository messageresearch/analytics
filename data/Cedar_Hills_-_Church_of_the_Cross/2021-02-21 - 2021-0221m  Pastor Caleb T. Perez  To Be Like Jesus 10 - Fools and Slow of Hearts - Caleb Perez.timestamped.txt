[54:13] jesus draws near jesus i may like when
[54:17] jesus draws in here
[54:20] and he said unto them what manner of

[54:27] as you walk and are sad
[54:36] orchestras
[54:38] i look around and i see you already

[54:47] tired and sick
[55:00] let me tell you but shouldn't we be
[55:04] renewing our
[55:06] strength every day
[55:10] the scripture says let's continue
[55:13] reading
[55:14] and one of them whose name was cleopas
[55:16] answering said unto him
[55:19] thou only a stranger in jerusalem
[55:23] and has not known the things which are
[55:26] come to pass
[55:27] there in these days
[55:39] because they're within their own speech
[55:42] they are acknowledging
[55:45] they're acknowledging that prophecy has
[55:48] come to pass
[55:52] and they talk like that but they don't
[55:53] really realize that it has come to pass
[55:58] and he said unto them what things
[56:03] and they said unto him concerning jesus
[56:05] of nazareth
[56:08] which was a prophet mighty indeed and
[56:11] word before
[56:12] god and all the people
[56:40] and if he is the same yesterday and
[56:42] today
[56:52] and how the chief priest and this is
[56:54] verse 20 and our rulers
[56:55] delivered him to be condemned to death
[56:58] and have crucified him
[57:06] but we trusted that it had been he which
[57:09] should have
[57:09] redeemed israel and beside all this
[57:14] today is the third day since these
[57:17] things were done
[57:38] we're trusting or we are we we have
[57:41] or we trust no questions
[57:46] once again living in the past

[1:00:13] let's continue reading and and see how
[1:00:15] this story we have heard
[1:00:17] so many messages on this on this subject
[1:00:22] but watch where we're going this morning
[1:00:25] verse 22 now of
[1:00:26] course 24. yay
[1:00:30] and certain women also of our company
[1:00:32] made us
[1:00:33] astonished which were early at the
[1:00:37] sepulchers
[1:00:40] last and when they found not
[1:00:43] his body they came saying that they had
[1:00:46] also
[1:00:47] seen a vision of angels which said that
[1:00:51] he was alive
[1:00:59] and certain of them which were with us
[1:01:01] went to the sepulcher and found it
[1:01:03] even so as the woman had said but him
[1:01:07] they saw nothing
[1:01:13] then he said unto them o fools
[1:01:18] slow of heart to believe all
[1:01:21] that the prophets have spoken
[1:01:38] and beginning at moses and all the
[1:01:40] prophets
[1:01:41] he expounded unto them in all the
[1:01:43] scriptures
[1:01:44] the things concerning himself
[1:02:04] got to explain something first
[1:02:08] matthew 5 222.
[1:02:12] this isn't dude he's just talking of
[1:02:14] course before is this jesus
[1:02:17] and he's saying this this is everybody
[1:02:19] got it
[1:02:20] we got it you got to get this part
[1:02:22] because then then this this will clear
[1:02:24] up some things here
[1:02:27] it says but i say unto you
[1:02:30] that whosoever is angry with his brother
[1:02:32] without a cause
[1:02:34] shall be in danger of judgment
[1:02:40] anybody here angry with their brother
[1:02:41] without a cause
[1:02:44] no no okay let's keep on reading then
[1:02:47] and whosoever shall say to his brother
[1:02:50] raqqa
[1:02:51] which means empty one.
[1:02:57] shall be in danger of the council
[1:03:00] and whosoever shall say thou full shall
[1:03:03] be in danger of hellfire
[1:03:08] three things here if you're angry with
[1:03:11] that with your brother without a cause
[1:03:14] you're in danger of the judgments
[1:03:17] if i disagree now listen closely
[1:03:20] if i disagree with someone you're doing
[1:03:22] this someone disagrees with me
[1:03:25] and i feel like i don't like that person
[1:03:56] maybe
[1:04:09] this is the prophet of god he says it's
[1:04:11] the prophet of you disagree with someone
[1:04:13] or they disagree with you do you send
[1:04:14] this accordingly
[1:04:16] and there's a woman and you feel like i
[1:04:17] don't like that person
[1:04:20] he says the spirit of christ has
[1:04:21] departed from you el espirito de christo
[1:04:33] wrong with us he goes on to say if you
[1:04:36] say to your brother raka which means
[1:04:38] empty
[1:04:44] in other words if you tell your brother
[1:04:46] you're an empty one
[1:04:49] and you don't do nothing to help fill
[1:04:51] him
[1:04:52] you'll
[1:05:05] if you say thou fool bro
[1:05:08] you'll be in danger of hell fire
[1:05:13] now how could jesus say then jesus put
[1:05:16] this dude
[1:05:16] don't call your brother a fool
[1:05:20] then he turns around
[1:05:26] [Music]
[1:05:43] it almost seems like something's not
[1:05:44] right there what is that
[1:05:46] it's not that something's not right no
[1:05:48] skin washed
[1:06:10] stupid oh gosh that's a bad word i
[1:06:12] better not my
[1:06:13] significa i'm glad that the adli my my
[1:06:16] my granddaughter's asleep because
[1:06:19] i'm not supposed to be saying though
[1:06:23] the other day brother branham was
[1:06:24] hitting it hard and he said he used the
[1:06:26] word stupid
[1:06:30] it says
[1:06:44] the
[1:06:55] that's not the way that jesus was using
[1:06:58] the word full over
[1:07:05] when jesus said in luke to his disciples
[1:07:10] this word falls in the greek significa
[1:07:15] significa which simply means sensual
[1:07:18] significance carnal or flesh
[1:07:24] he's not calling them stupid or
[1:07:26] blackheads
[1:07:31] watch this now it is derived from noise
[1:07:37] which means to exercise the mind
[1:07:52] when he says all full
[1:08:12] now now how many understand that to this
[1:08:14] point
[1:08:16] is just two different words that he's
[1:08:17] using
[1:08:20] now now let's go here now to matthew 28.
[1:08:24] when he says now we must then exercise
[1:08:27] our minds
[1:08:28] to observe
[1:08:32] important it's important because to us
[1:08:34] many times observe
[1:08:35] is to cross our
[1:09:01] teaching them to observe all things
[1:09:18] is
[1:09:26] teaching them to observe all things
[1:09:31] you gotta guard all things
[1:09:35] hey that's what satan wants he wants to
[1:09:37] take everything from us
[1:09:40] he wants to take every promise that god
[1:09:42] has given us
[1:09:43] every blessing that god's given us to
[1:09:46] get it take it from you
[1:09:48] jesus is telling us to observe all
[1:09:51] things
[1:09:53] simply once again it's implemented to
[1:09:56] watch or
[1:09:56] guard all things so that there's no
[1:10:00] loss or injury
[1:10:04] keep your eye upon it
[1:10:07] take note of prophecy
[1:10:10] this is what jesus is saying once again
[1:10:12] there's okay history of his mind to
[1:10:14] observe all
[1:10:29] now that we understand this we can get
[1:10:31] into our message now
[1:10:35] and slow of heart
[1:10:38] because we're carnal many times and we
[1:10:41] don't
[1:10:41] exercise our minds you know
[1:10:45] we don't exercise our minds in the word
[1:10:49] why our heart is slow
[1:10:54] how many ever feel like you're slow
[1:10:56] sometimes what does this
[1:10:59] [Music]
[1:11:08] there's days huh yes in first
[1:11:16] [Music]
[1:11:23] i understand those days
[1:11:38] there's not much activity going on
[1:11:42] when your heart is slow
[1:11:46] when you sit around and you're just not
[1:11:48] doing nothing
[1:11:50] your heart is at rest it's a at resting
[1:12:06] [Music]
[1:12:34] what the scripture had concerning him
[1:12:37] for
[1:12:37] his days
[1:12:40] this is fools and slow of heart
[1:12:43] insensation
[1:12:44] to understand the scriptures that were
[1:12:46] promised for this agenda
[1:12:52] [Music]
[1:13:17] this is could he say it again
[1:13:22] of heart insensators believe all the
[1:13:24] scriptures say
[1:13:25] about this day
[1:13:29] you believe that this lair is cnh
[1:13:33] put him outside of the church
[1:13:37] he says fools and slaw of hearts
[1:13:41] didn't say that they didn't believe he
[1:13:44] said that they were slow to believe
[1:13:48] they believed but but very slowly
[1:13:51] how many have ever found yourself
[1:13:54] you you kind of don't seem to get it
[1:13:55] right
[1:13:58] then
[1:14:13] no capital location i might not get a
[1:14:14] lot of things real right away
[1:14:17] bother us bother us because why
[1:14:21] are we slow to believe this
[1:14:26] don't let
[1:14:52] because there was no exercise going on
[1:15:09] let's see what what jesus has told us
[1:15:13] they weren't thinking like that all they
[1:15:15] were doing the bible says is they were
[1:15:17] talking and being sad
[1:15:21] many times when we're sad it's because
[1:15:23] of that which
[1:15:24] is almost three times because we're not
[1:15:25] in the world
[1:15:27] it comes up time that we gotta get into
[1:15:29] the world
[1:15:31] it's the time to get in like we never
[1:15:33] have before
[1:15:35] well that we know what the scripture
[1:15:37] says we know what the prophet said
[1:15:40] is the prophet we know what they're
[1:15:41] found in pastor
[1:15:43] we understand where we're at now now
[1:15:47] notice this
[1:15:48] order he checked on him
[1:16:12] it's not pumping enough blood through
[1:16:14] your whole body
[1:16:18] and so there are
[1:16:46] um you get dizzy yeah
[1:16:49] um you get fatigued it's a fatigue okay
[1:16:53] shortness of breath the corto respirator
[1:16:55] okay chest pains the lord is the petu
[1:16:57] i think we all this is pretty much
[1:17:00] everybody
[1:17:18] how many of you feel maybe at times like
[1:17:20] that spiritually
[1:17:23] it's sometimes faint
[1:17:26] it's tired sometimes we forget things
[1:17:31] when we get like that we forget things
[1:17:34] we forget all the promises when we're in
[1:17:36] the middle of a
[1:17:36] battle
[1:17:40] we forget all the great things that god
[1:17:42] has
[1:17:57] almost almost like if you couldn't do
[1:17:58] this now now why do we get in this
[1:18:00] condition
[1:18:02] because there's no exercise going on
[1:18:06] there's nothing to get our cardio or our
[1:18:09] our hearts pumping
[1:18:12] timothy 4 17. you don't have force
[1:18:14] heaven you don't have to turn to it
[1:18:18] exercise yourself unto godliness
[1:18:24] i don't know why but but when i when i
[1:18:26] speak to people
[1:18:30] many different people they automatically
[1:18:33] think that that that
[1:18:34] that god just works by hocus pocus
[1:18:39] we know because we all we all all of us
[1:18:40] say oh lord please do this for me
[1:18:43] for me lord get this done you know we we
[1:18:46] we go through that
[1:18:48] but we don't do what the scripture says
[1:18:51] how can we expect god to come on the
[1:18:53] scene
[1:18:55] we haven't done what the scripture has
[1:18:56] done
[1:18:59] says you got to exercise yourself
[1:19:03] oh no lord just give me godliness in
[1:19:06] your dummy
[1:19:18] and then you wonder why you don't see
[1:19:20] the lord moving in
[1:19:24] because we're slow to believe all that
[1:19:28] the prophets have said
[1:19:31] to believe the scriptures that have been
[1:19:32] spoken
[1:19:49] the children and the young people
[1:19:52] i'm amazed i'm amazed that
[1:19:56] they can tell you a movie
[1:20:00] repeat the whole movie
[1:20:15] [Music]
[1:20:28] in other words that's what we do the
[1:20:31] children stay so much
[1:20:32] in front of the television but after a
[1:20:35] while that's all the children do
[1:20:37] especially everything that's going to
[1:20:39] happen
[1:20:40] they can tell you everything that's that
[1:20:42] is being said
[1:20:44] but ask
[1:20:57] they'll find the shortest version
[1:21:00] why because they don't exercise
[1:21:02] themselves
[1:21:04] but who's supposed to be helping them
[1:21:07] training them
[1:21:08] to exercise we're getting into our
[1:21:11] message now
[1:21:12] who's supposed to be training them who's
[1:21:15] supposed to no no what they don't want
[1:21:17] us
[1:21:17] they don't sit still we'll make them sit
[1:21:19] still
[1:21:21] who's the parents around you
[1:21:24] you have the authority to to sit him
[1:21:27] down
[1:21:29] i want you to do me a favor this week i
[1:21:32] want you to tally up
[1:21:33] how much time they spend on the tablet
[1:21:35] and television
[1:21:38] i really want you guys to do this
[1:21:49] hello everybody how much time they spend
[1:21:52] listening to a message
[1:21:55] how much time they spend reading the
[1:21:56] bible i want you to and at the end of
[1:21:59] the week do it for yourself
[1:22:04] this week you know the tv's off
[1:22:07] make this tally look good at the end of
[1:22:10] the week
[1:22:13] way more time we'll see but then it'll
[1:22:17] go next week it'll go right back to the
[1:22:18] waist
[1:22:21] but do it for yourself
[1:22:24] because numbers don't lie
[1:22:28] it tells you what it was what it is now
[1:22:30] now i tell you that too
[1:22:32] to test your faith i tell you that to
[1:22:35] challenge you uh i want you to really
[1:22:38] see what's going on in your life
[1:22:41] i don't want to just live my life and
[1:22:43] just and just say well you know i i hope
[1:22:45] this happens
[1:22:49] most people have hope and they think
[1:22:51] it's faith
[1:22:53] a world of difference there's nothing
[1:22:55] even they're not even close
[1:22:57] i want you to get this tremendous really
[1:23:00] why is it then that we exercise our
[1:23:03] minds over a lot of things
[1:23:07] when we should be exercising ourselves
[1:23:09] onto godliness
[1:23:13] it wasn't even very long ago
[1:23:17] jesus had told them what was going to
[1:23:20] happen
[1:23:22] i mean this was not five years ago
[1:23:27] this was not oh uh uh uh 30 years ago
[1:23:31] jesus begins to talk to them
[1:23:34] and he had just told them this
[1:23:38] what was gonna happen he laid it out for
[1:23:41] them
[1:23:42] this wasn't the whole plan he lays it
[1:23:45] out
[1:24:41] he went for jesus and he showed his
[1:24:43] disciples
[1:24:45] and he's telling them how he must go to
[1:24:47] jerusalem
[1:24:49] many things of the elders suffrage
[1:24:53] and the scribes and be killed
[1:24:56] but be raised again the third day
[1:25:00] this is plain english it's just
[1:25:03] i think we often understand that
[1:25:07] peter then peter took him this is pedro
[1:25:10] and peter began
[1:25:23] he's rebuking him
[1:25:38] think about it put yourself in in
[1:25:40] peter's shoe
[1:25:42] i'm not going to see it i don't want to
[1:25:45] i don't want to accept that
[1:25:47] no jesus you're not that's not going to
[1:25:48] happen
[1:25:50] he's saying that he says be as far from
[1:25:52] the lord
[1:25:54] this shall not be unto thee how many
[1:25:58] times
[1:25:58] does the lord tell us things that's the
[1:26:00] best in those decency and we don't want
[1:26:01] it to be that you know
[1:26:03] what do we do we push it out of our
[1:26:05] minds
[1:26:06] mm-hmm
[1:26:19] how many of you could really take it
[1:26:22] call me satan nobody got myself i ain't
[1:26:24] gonna follow him no more i don't know
[1:26:25] what you're saying
[1:26:26] i'm going to church i was just going to
[1:26:29] make them
[1:26:30] get behind me saying that that's an
[1:26:33] offense to me it is
[1:26:35] in other words in other words you you
[1:26:37] think that you're going to stop the plan
[1:26:39] of god enough
[1:26:42] to me there is an offensive get behind
[1:26:43] me for thou
[1:26:45] savor is not the things with that
[1:26:48] god
[1:26:58] oh but those that be of men those are
[1:27:00] the things that we save
[1:27:16] many times muchos versus we don't see
[1:27:19] things
[1:27:19] novemos courses because
[1:27:22] that's not what we had in mind
[1:27:26] yes that's right yes sir yes you'll see
[1:27:28] it's nothing but the truth
[1:27:38] we've only been with with the master for
[1:27:42] three and a half years
[1:27:45] are you with me this morning we've only
[1:27:46] been with the master three and a half
[1:27:48] years
[1:27:50] we can we we should have more time with
[1:27:52] him
[1:27:54] we need some growing we need to mature
[1:27:58] he can't
[1:28:53] i was you saw the king john passed away
[1:29:00] i think for a moment that i was i know
[1:29:02] we'll see brother john again
[1:29:05] but i wasn't looking at that i was
[1:29:08] shocked
[1:29:22] in
[1:29:47] of course we're in the middle of a
[1:29:49] revival oh coming
[1:30:04] my dad
[1:30:19] do you mean okay i i don't get it
[1:30:22] no no no i don't question the lord i've
[1:30:24] learned you know i've learned
[1:30:26] years ago not to question them
[1:30:29] but i have some questions and i asked
[1:30:31] questions
[1:30:35] this doesn't make sense to me i'm
[1:30:38] thinking all these things right
[1:30:40] it doesn't make sense and
[1:30:43] as i i remember talking with brother
[1:30:45] brother diego and
[1:30:48] later on and i had i had mentioned it to
[1:30:50] him
[1:30:54] and i i i as we we talked about it
[1:30:58] about a week later i got together again
[1:31:01] with brother diego
[1:31:02] diego and we're talking about this
[1:31:06] and he looks at me and he says
[1:31:10] make sure i'm saying it right
[1:31:14] i was thinking you would just stop in
[1:31:16] sunday how can this
[1:31:17] be even possible he said until the lord
[1:31:21] reminded him
[1:31:23] of oh my and when brother diego is
[1:31:26] telling me this
[1:31:28] i remember too
[1:31:42] and i could hear jesus
[1:32:23] there's a lady with the royal garments
[1:32:38] in royal garments
[1:32:53] and that's what prompted me you just
[1:32:55] look at me as i began to
[1:32:56] think about me and i said oh lord fools
[1:32:59] and then you know
[1:33:00] all that i am i don't look at nobody
[1:33:02] else
[1:33:03] i look in the mirror of god's word
[1:33:06] how
[1:33:20] as i looked at that and i said lord
[1:33:21] forgive me
[1:33:24] you see in our minds we think it's going
[1:33:25] to be a certain way
[1:33:29] but i also know by the scripture
[1:33:32] god will never take a man because
[1:34:29] it's about how much scripture
[1:34:44] that we're unbelievers almost incredible
[1:34:47] we're just slow twitter
[1:34:50] my lord i look at brother branham bill

[1:38:38] the 12. said we go up to jerusalem
[1:38:43] and all things that are written by the
[1:38:45] prophets concerning the son of man

[1:39:44] i don't know about you but i'm going to
[1:39:45] say every time he shows up
[1:39:48] there's a purpose behind it and the
[1:39:50] purpose is a day of
[1:39:52] reckoning
[1:40:05] it is a day of reckoning
[1:40:20] judges your finale but a day of
[1:40:23] reckoning
[1:40:25] is the time and every opportunity that

[1:44:07] glory which shall be revealed
[1:44:11] in other words paul is telling us after
[1:44:13] taking inventory
[1:44:16] doing the accounting come to the
[1:44:18] conclusion

[2:05:20] founding pastor had preached
[2:05:24] if i get to something wrong you tell me
[2:05:25] brother henry
[2:05:27] he said many times we say
[2:05:30] i'm not claiming this sickness
[2:06:14] but once it's
[2:06:26] if you don't if you don't look him
[2:06:28] straight in the eyes
[2:06:55] every day is a day of reckoning
[2:07:07] did you know that you might be able to
[2:07:09] fight certain devils
[2:07:25] this is why we can fight something okay
[2:07:28] you find out how to fight that company
[2:07:31] but there as you go
[2:07:32] as we go up the bride begins to go up
[2:07:36] principalities become harder less
[2:07:40] now you're not dealing with just these
[2:07:42] little things in church
[2:07:46] it's the greater things is that right
[2:07:49] yes that's right but the higher we go up
[2:07:52] better
[2:07:59] [Applause]
[2:08:18] is simply god revealing himself
[2:08:33] the more he reveals himself
[2:08:47] i hope that you get this morning i'm
[2:08:50] going to say it again the more that he
[2:08:51] reveals himself to you
[2:08:54] through you the greater your worship
[2:08:57] becomes
[2:08:57] granted greater worship is not the more
[2:09:00] you jump and shout out
[2:09:16] he
[2:09:30] is
[2:09:44] in uganda
[2:09:52] from what i understand to this point and
[2:09:54] had not accepted the message
[2:09:56] but we're working on him he sent me some
[2:09:59] videos and there man they're going in
[2:10:00] church and they're just jumping up and
[2:10:01] down going
[2:10:02] crazy and then it's what do you think
[2:10:08] and i just write back
[2:10:11] i said let's start here let's start in
[2:10:15] baptism
[2:10:15] in bautista how do you baptize how were
[2:10:19] you baptized come about this and how do
[2:10:20] you baptize the people come on
[2:10:22] father's unholy ghost okay let me tell
[2:10:25] you how
[2:10:26] to correctly baptize people
[2:10:30] i began to write to him he says brother
[2:10:33] that's the truth
[2:10:35] proved it by the scripture i said okay
[2:10:38] there's more to it
[2:10:40] just the beginning
[2:10:55] okay like i said nothing wrong with
[2:10:57] doing those things
[2:10:59] but remember god is in his word
[2:11:03] the more we exercise ourselves in the
[2:11:06] words
[2:11:07] the more we know him muslim and the more
[2:11:10] we know him
[2:11:11] the greater the worship that's why many
[2:11:14] people's worship doesn't grow
[2:11:17] understanding of him
[2:11:22] that's why church becomes monotonous to
[2:11:24] people
[2:11:26] if every day you could grow a little bit
[2:11:28] more
[2:11:30] find out a little bit more a little bit
[2:11:32] more
[2:11:33] your worship is never the same
[2:11:41] i think i better quit no no oh my i
[2:11:44] don't know how long i've been going but

[2:15:20] heartbeat again if i had to do it again
[2:15:25] to give time that's the thing we
[2:15:28] neglected
[2:15:30] a husband most next to the wife and
[2:15:33] wonders why the wife is mad at him
[2:15:38] it doesn't give time no no no nothing my
[2:15:40] wife neglects the husband that's
[2:15:41] supposed to be
[2:15:42] he never has food for him never does the
[2:15:43] duties of a wife
[2:15:47] no wonder he's upset
[2:16:12] [Applause]
[2:16:16] oh i'm going to take you for for i'm
[2:16:18] going to take here
[2:16:20] your kid i'm going to take you out for
[2:16:21] let's go me and you let's go for a ride
[2:16:23] okay
[2:16:26] this is all we do here put this lollipop
[2:16:29] in your mouth and then be quiet
[2:16:44] heart he lent to the corazon believe all
[2:16:47] that the prophets have spoken
[2:16:50] it's all laid out in the message
[2:16:56] i'm a single mom god knows that
[2:17:01] god knows those things that's what his
[2:17:04] grace and mercy does it brings us
[2:17:06] through those things
[2:17:08] so grateful this morning church i'm
[2:17:10] telling you guys
[2:17:11] that he gives us a day
[2:17:26] this is a day of reckoning today doing
[2:17:29] what we're doing
[2:17:31] neglecting the ones that are around us
[2:17:35] neglect one another
[2:17:38] the love that each one needs
[2:17:48] and yet we look at our children
[2:18:01] we say well i was with them they seemed
[2:18:04] to give them time
[2:18:06] and our mind is somewhere else when
[2:18:07] we're with them
[2:18:21] watching movies
[2:18:35] absolutely nothing wrong with we do all
[2:18:37] those things
[2:18:38] someone say games and have fun with it
[2:18:40] funny with each other
[2:18:43] but the things of god are we teaching
[2:18:46] them
[2:18:47] to observe all things
[2:18:52] and the question is this when the time
[2:18:55] of reckoning comes
[2:18:58] when your children leave your home
[2:19:02] go to college they go out somewhere else
[2:19:33] a a video of a church service here
[2:19:36] a couple of years ago and as it was
[2:19:38] panned in the audience

[2:19:43] longer here this one
[2:19:44] is no longer here this person doesn't
[2:19:45] come this person
[2:20:10] that we could have done
[2:20:17] i wish i could have given you a another
[2:20:18] message today that
[2:20:20] made you real happy
