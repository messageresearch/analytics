[41:25] two ago
[41:28] I was throwing out the
[41:31] trash and I usually have my dog outside
[41:35] with
[41:37] me and as I was going outside I went
[41:41] around the
[41:44] corner where all the trashes were and
[41:47] there my dog
[41:51] was in the neighbor's
[41:55] yard and usually this doesn't happen
[41:57] because there's a mini fence in the
[42:04] gate to prevent trash from getting
[42:08] in I don't know what happened to it it
[42:10] was
[42:13] gone and so immediately I freaked out I
[42:16] was like come
[42:20] on as soon as I said that here come all
[42:23] the neighbors dogs
[42:28] and they're big they're they're they're
[42:33] big and my dog she she's small and she
[42:36] tries running
[42:39] out and and her butt gets stuck in the
[42:47] fence but luckily she was she was able
[42:50] to get out and I just I just want to
[42:51] thank the Lord for protecting
[42:56] her God bless
[43:16] you God bless you
[43:18] all um about two and a half weeks ago I
[43:21] went to the dentist for my annual exam
[43:28] ex and after my x-rays in the exam the
[43:32] dentist brought something to my
[43:38] attention she told me I had a cyst
[43:40] growing in the back of my
[43:46] throat so she wanted to refer me she
[43:48] wanted me to go back in two weeks and
[43:51] see she might have to refer me to a
[43:53] surgeon
[43:58] and then right after that the dental
[43:59] hygienist had clean was going to clean
[44:01] my
[44:06] teeth and she noticed the same thing and
[44:09] asked me if the dentist saw
[44:15] it and I told her she had and she was
[44:18] she might have to go back in two weeks
[44:20] and she might have to refer me to a
[44:21] surgeon
[44:27] [Music]
[44:28] and right away she said oh good because
[44:30] we don't want to let that go make sure
[44:32] you keep your
[44:38] appointment she told me she saw the same
[44:41] thing before on another patient she kind
[44:43] of got me
[44:48] scared and she said that what the other
[44:50] patient had didn't keep their
[44:51] appointment and it turned out to be
[44:53] cancer
[45:00] so I went back to the dentist
[45:04] yesterday and after my exam the dentist
[45:08] says well she said it looks different

[1:29:04] all so I wanted to give a testimony that
[1:29:07] isn't really about me but I know it
[1:29:10] happened so I wanted to kind of make a
[1:29:12] request after the
[1:29:16] [Music]
[1:29:19] testimony so about year and a half ago
[1:29:25] I had a
[1:29:29] coworker we started talking about the
[1:29:31] Lord kind of at work a little
[1:29:36] bit she shared that she kind of fell
[1:29:39] fell away from her
[1:29:43] faith and um we we just started talking
[1:29:47] and shortly after she came to
[1:29:51] me and she told me that her mom had uh
[1:29:54] had gotten
[1:29:58] cancer and I remember I had a
[1:30:00] handkerchief in my back pack that was
[1:30:03] prayed
[1:30:06] over so I ended up I I go to give her
[1:30:10] the handkerchief and then I show her a
[1:30:11] scripture where you know it says that in
[1:30:13] the book of
[1:30:16] Acts what to do with the
[1:30:21] handkerchief and I forgot about it in
[1:30:23] about six months
[1:30:26] later she comes and she tells me she's
[1:30:30] very excited she says uh every night my
[1:30:32] mom would put that handkerchief where
[1:30:34] her cancer
[1:30:39] was and she doesn't have cancer no
[1:30:48] more and uh that's
[1:30:51] great but now she serves the Lord at her
[1:30:54] own
[1:30:55] church she actually quit her job just to
[1:30:58] do
[1:31:01] that I think they pay
[1:31:06] her but no she freely but
[1:31:10] know um so I said all that to to say
[1:31:13] this I have a I have a
[1:31:17] client um we just we just barely closed
[1:31:20] on a
[1:31:22] property and she she kind of broke down
[1:31:25] um she has a daughter that's about 26
[1:31:27] years
[1:31:29] [Music]
[1:31:31] old and you know I I have a handkerchief
[1:31:34] but it's at my
[1:31:37] house I just want to uh see if if the
[1:31:40] ministry maybe if I bring it on Sunday
[1:31:42] or if anyone has a extra handkerchief
[1:31:51] anywhere and if they would pray over it
[1:31:53] because I know how real the Lord is in
[1:31:55] my life
[1:31:58] and and I know what he will do for
[1:32:03] her amen God
