heard it you know amen i'd like to open up and uh first corinthians chapter two capitulo dos i was debating whether to go english to spanish time we don't have it all the time too there are a lot of things that the lord has already given us be patient chapter 2 the first corinthians and verse 9. but as it is written i have not seen it neither has enter and all he says nor ear hurt we haven't heard anything we still want to hear neither have entered into the heart of man the things with god has prepared for them that love him i love this scripture brother you almost i always thought it was in the future what the lord has for us and he still has a lot more for us when we go to heaven he says you're going to hear it right now not by me no no for me let's have a word of prayer lord i thank you for this opportunity today with my brothers and sisters lord my brother jacob and my wife susie hermano hermann lord we've become a threesome lord that we love you with all our hearts lord perfection comes to the number three lord perfect our brothers and sisters out there that they need to come live lord that's our prayer that this testimony lord help those that have questions in their hearts thank you lord gracias you can be seated every time we say you can be seated uh in some ways i don't like it because it's like ordering you to do this and up and down my wife i knew her when she was catholic and i had the message in my heart to the lord and that was one of the things that i went with her to a catholic church i told her you know what it's a good exercise because they get up and down up and down good workouts but i went anyway and the time came when the lord touched your heart you need you deserve this [Music] i'm going to take you to hear a real man of god preach the word it only took one service brother that she wanted to get baptized one service our following and he also he didn't resist yeah and the lord spoke to her in other ways the lord gave her dreams about brother branham suenos i didn't even have to worry about anything took care of everything and before i go further further into my testimony testimony let's go to saint john chapter 21 2 like i said i'm going to read a lot of scripts like brother abraham says i love that man he starts a little slow and then he takes off amen he read scriptures and that's what the purpose of it scripture is what made him so noble [Music] description i'm going to read it because we took a trip to mexico and it took an invitation from my pastor that i thank him for the confidence and i was surprised invited my brother jacob too but jacob had plans already an invitation to go to alaska and he'll go to mexico sometimes well the reason i read this scripture because i was they're sitting there and i was sitting over there like for brother uh guerra there um was watching him and the lord was telling me he was saying the lord is saying verily verily i say unto thee when that was young thyself and walketh with all [Music] and then we got ready and then all the confusion the airport and security makes it more hectic and you got to do this you got to fill out this paper make certain reservations and i felt like a little boy my wife would tell me don't lose them they were walking fast over here and i thought it was like a parachute he had a heater but then i was glad that i was going there the lord had already told me i'm going to take you to mexico city one of these days but i knew i was going to go and when as an older person the only problem also won two days after i got back those years like they say that's when i got a little bit sick but no not over there everything was great another thing about mexico city those people and me personally i connect with them i love them so much my ministry back in pentecost or apostolic media the front part of mexico baja california california that's what they call the places out there all the valleys of juarez the valley of western a lot of churches missionary churches which is missionaries and one of the greatest places that the lord gave me a privilege to preach and i i was sharing that with my kids i was happen and greater things are happening so as far as mexico i love mexico yo mexico you know not because of mexico or hispanic like to say you know they're in my heart continuously beautiful man brothers you know that when he would speak to you he would look straight at you he was looking at your eyes now things that i might say i'm not saying you can win all mexico and all south america mexico america he just went like that do you remind me of another evangelist that he knew pretty good serious looking at you the eyes of jesus jesus i mean all the time he would look at us then jimmy knows that we would have meetings we had the meeting ayanna and deming when we had the junta and deming and then and arby's in the arby's and then you took all those chilito serranos and you got everybody yeah remember and i remember all those things great things oh i was and i went and locked myself in the church and got a guitar and i sang there for about hour and a half waiting they got us the best place to spend those two three nights yes oh man i felt so you know uncomfortable with all of that they were smothering us oh man wait wait too much hey brother hey man hey man well give me and i love to hear those pictures when they jump up and down and get in the spirit almost when you get older you don't jump that much said you would like to maybe move like that but and i got my notes but wow wow it's the scriptures i'm going to go into a theme yeah and it's kind of delicate yes i share that with brother i thought i had it here but i know i know i'd have it hey brother uh remember the scriptures gave you about leviticus or to the leviticus or jeremy no not those that i didn't give to you let's go leviticus chapter 19 verse 19. i'm pretty sure that's the first one they gave it to me right here though leviticus 1919 he shall keep my statue though shall not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind of animals with the diverse kind thought shall not sow thy field with mingle see us neither shall a garment mingle of linen and woolen come unto thee to campo okay deuteronomy 22 verse 9 10 and 11. 22 9 10. is testimony with brother jimmy jimmy i met brother jamie through another sister in church that used to clean houses jimmy was doing carpets and the sister told him that that i was a pastor where she was going and she would like for us and she told me that too and i said i would like to meet him yeah and i met brother jimmy i forgot whether he called me or i call him most like he's him because he's always called first i had been a minister for 15 years in the apostolic church in five years as a pastor and i like i told the brothers and sisters in mexico i would lock myself in the church saturday and the only way the lord could give me more only come another question lord lord i've done everything that i've been taught even more that they have yeah they do what they have what they have done let me look at look at my ministry and all the detention centers and i was crying out to the lord yes you know what i thought at first when i met him he started helping more than my other ministers they were supposed to help me welcome my the lord manifested in such a special way and the moment me and brother jimmy start working together [Music] i search everything in the scriptures to see if those things are that way where do you get all this you know jimmy what's up [Laughter] [Music] you ma'am mikasa i got in my little car you had an old car and i had an old car there we go the alabamas officer to boston out there real close to conley elementary i was honest why do we have to go to this house to show me the mosquitoes i'm trying to figure it out jimmy we finally got off the cars he says [Music] yes god knows it i've been praying and i've been praying yesterday part of you especially she cannot stay behind the lord promised you else you know he had a cardboard garage he didn't park the car there hello brother branham liberus what do you do with the garage you put a bunch of junk in there jimmy put a message there my god and rather i was like a magnet brother like the lord died in my hand and went straight to the book if we're director mental libero that seed you cannot mingle it with any young people have you ever eaten grapes without seeds in samia these scientists have mingled animals and seeds simple scientifically young ladies this is why you go through so much trouble what is your body changes it's a hybrid it's it's a mucho cambio is it menopause ahead of time they kind of go crazy but the original word can bring you back to your recent stats so this is where i come to my brothers share with you as i study studio and study some more in studio mass and i prepare the message for the church where i was in the preparation and uh well of course back to brother jimmy when he opened the door he says this is all i preach and that's all i have to know my life has changed and i have no regrets brothers i have no regrets i love my brothers out there i love them next to the country club one of those is yours they're gonna there's three crosses one they're gonna fight one of them i said thank you brother oh man i want to be crucified with my lord jesus christ thank you so much for letting me know what everybody thinks is and i'm going to say a word of caution brother i will steal the album i don't say this no the question because i rejoice in something that bad that happens the bible says that um the charity it doesn't boast on uh against evil against evil of what something happens foreign i like to bring this up because my mom was there when i was bringing that you know and then uh something awesome happened and i was bringing that teaching on the spoken word i had my my board you know they put aside and i had a pulpit on the bottom and then at the end of the teaching and i was waiting for her and they said she embraced me was filled with white rock cheese sauce white stones all over the top of the outside wow that revelation that was for them it was awesome brother mom she was crying she couldn't hold herself she was shaking my mouth wow she just did you know pentecost it was a little too much for her and those things happen spoken word i'm baptized in the name of jesus christ that's not totally what i'm saying what you need to pull out all the hybrid i don't love that when he said that is not conformed to the spoken word of god with your own ideas and traditions you're going to hybrid the original scene a teacher where i was at ministry i realized i cannot do that anymore i pulled back and i said probably jimmy i understand now yes i was baptized in the name of jesus christ see if we you get a second base so third base they start they they they spike you out there or or even when you're for now you're trying to bat well you've got to go back to home base no matter what it's not like home run you go around i'm going to tell you one thing denomination is not going to make a home run nomination just like brother abraham peaches it hurts a little bit when he says we came from cemeteries and that is the truth we were dead even in denominations you have to be reborn again you have to be re-baptized like i said about this and i had to face that you don't can't carry it and all the criticism that came with it your righteousness is not greater than the pharisees see he said if it's not your righteousness it's not greater than that because the sales not enter the kingdom so i have to look for the rightness in the lord yes word and that's my testimony when it comes to re-baptism i don't know some of you have been baptized in the message some of you i don't know whether you've been baptized in denominations that's awesome brothers and uh there's so many great things the lord has showing us that i'm going to go into another outro revelation apocalypse's revelations chapter 1 and in revelation the book of revelation i finally found my paper verse and the more brother jimmy shared with me he asked me something up there i was 16 years old before i read the book of revelation he was like a vagabond he was just up and down juarez and el paso juarez and el paso he just was in drugs and uh he liked he was curious about all of the other churches and he got a book in uh mano branham and he left it there at my aunt's house and i went to visit my my aunt in el paso in el paso branham jimmy remind me of it because uh yesterday i went over there and he was and i read it whoa i was scared i'm yellow oh lord you said i was shocked that was the first book actually that i read but i had forgotten when i was the age of 16. yeah it premiered liverpool you ready i was so scared it was like a nightmare and i put it aside i said but one great thing the lord i could hear the brothers singing all things [Music] i had heard that song with my parents but it came to me that day yeah [Music] you know i the reason i'm sharing a lot of things they're not the ones who hold me back i was the one holding myself i experienced coming into and i share in mexico something that i had to share hearing i'm going to share it with you what was the first project that we're talking revelations chapter this is what amazed me brothers you know you're looking for and he hear the voice he said your me and brother jimmy we share with her and bro hector what do you think of that john here describes him juan aquilo and he says i turned to see the voice and respect to me and being turned i saw seven golden sticks i remember them one day when i was reading the scriptures in mexico i was i mean i could read one book through in one i was reading that book but i saw him praying for sick people it was beautiful when i saw him i kept you know it was like a little vision i mean it's hard to describe these things i looked up and i saw all the prophets and that's it the lord told me this is what he is he takes the prophet it takes a prophet to open your eyes takes a prophet recognize the bible says that he is like unto the son of man what do you want me to give this testimony he says i got ministers that out there they're just curious about what all of you are doing and i know you're out there i think these are the the truth wherever you are you're curious come i was hearing brother caleb that people out there in the east i don't know where they're at i'm very critical about this ministry and look right now immediately they came in and they saw it's totally different even different that's why i challenge anybody out it's a little different from the mornings right you know brother jimmy brother jimmy tully hector just be yourself i'm only halfway there oh amen and i felt at his feet to worship him and he said unto me siddha do it not i am a fellow servant and thy brethren that have the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus and chapter 20 verse 9. no 22 i'm sorry 22 verse 9. dan says he unto me saw see though do it not for i am thy spell servant and i kind of by brethren the prophets and of them which keep the saints of this book worship god [Music] a lot of people they they think we're fanatics we tell them it's brother brown yeah his brother william bradley sent him on william marion branham they don't have to tell me over and over again you're the only one that can see all the fellow servants but he is our fellow servant and he brought us the whole revelation [Music] and all of a sudden the lord just stops when he says now do you see this the repentance is though i was always wondering how come in the book of acts it speaks of joel and then brother branham he speaks about those roman insects they that ate up the the plant and i said how did he know that come on well he said the lord told me the prophet here he's quoting the prophet in the book of the book of acts that's what i'm telling you and we think we know the bible i said that's right because was prophesizing everything that was going to happen in the church brother william german william in his powerful message in mexico city on those insects he's always yeah you know he just needed the work you know awesome man i was seeing all these things happening danny was saying you know the way he gets into out there in the province when he's going to lead the songs he starts right off el caminos because you don't want to follow but he's got that gift he gets into it he doesn't scold the church and he goes bam and he gets into it i love that you know he says if you don't follow us because i'm wrong we you know we say beautiful things too you know amen so this is what uh the lord showed me he's looking to you know brandon branham and i love you people i wish i could speak some more but you know time has gone by [Music] it looks like the one on your new in the empire state building i got it right they got a big one up there you can beat [Music] i don't keep track of times though so i want to thank you so much but i do want to sing a couple songs that go with this testament i don't know me brother williams if you want to try the piano follow me i don't know anybody know where my guitar is at i love singing brothers i hope i don't bore you um they just before i sing these songs i want to say i want to say something that brother jacob shared with me do you know some of you know that brother jacob is my brother he's my brother and he uh share with me something bad and he said brother hector hector he was at the bank over there and i call him see if he could come out to speak for libya and then he cries all the time because he's no he misses his wife hector all that you went through oh look at this yes for me almost for me but then it reminded me of this to live for others is eternal life amen so if i could share that with him have you noticed at silver city do you see nothing in silver city i don't think i'm wrong but it's it's the little on the east side of the continental dubai right there have you looked at the
