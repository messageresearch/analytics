[0:00] and now tonight we are
[0:03] have uh starting on the subject
[0:07] of the breach between uh the
[0:10] uh seven church ages and the
[0:13] seven seals now
[0:17] now we're going to turn to the fifth
[0:19] chapter
[0:20] now this is not the seventh seal
[0:25] it is the breach between the church ages
[0:28] and the seven seals and i saw
[0:31] in the right hand of him that set up on
[0:33] a throne
[0:35] a book written within and on the
[0:38] backside
[0:39] sealed with seven seals
[0:42] and i saw a strong angel proclaiming
[0:45] with a
[0:46] loud voice who's worthy to open the book
[0:49] and loose the seals at all and
[0:52] no man in heaven nor in earth
[0:55] neither under either
[0:58] under the earth was able to open the
[1:02] book
[1:03] neither to look upon
[1:06] whatever and i went
[1:10] much because no man was found
[1:13] worthy to open him and to read
[1:16] the book neither to look there on
[1:20] and one of the others said under with me
[1:22] we
[1:23] not behold the line of the tribe of
[1:26] judah the
[1:27] root of david hath prevailed to open the
[1:31] book and to loose the seven seals
[1:34] thereof
[1:36] and i be held in low in the midst of the
[1:38] throne of the four beasts in the midst
[1:42] of the elders
[1:43] stood a lamb as it had been
[1:46] slain heaven seven
[1:49] horns and seven eyes which
[1:52] are the seven spirits of god sent forth
[1:55] unto all the earth
[1:57] and he came and took the book out of the
[1:59] right hand of him that
[2:00] set up on the throne
[2:04] the seventh angel begins to sound
[2:08] there's the messages wrote out there we
[2:11] got to take book form
[2:13] now at the beginning of the
[2:16] sounding of the message the
[2:19] mystery of god should be
[2:22] finished and we realize that in the
[2:25] scriptures over in malachi 4
[2:28] there is to be a one like john a
[2:31] and elijah to whom the word of god can
[2:34] come to and he is to reveal
[2:39] by the holy spirit all the mysteries of
[2:42] god and restore
[2:44] the faith of the children back to the
[2:47] faith of the apostolic father
[2:51] restore back all these mysteries that's
[2:54] been broken
[2:55] through these denominational years now
[2:59] we see that this seven seal book
[3:03] now is the mystery of redemption
[3:06] it's a book of redemption
[3:10] from god now
[3:13] all the mysteries at this time
[3:16] should be finished at the sounding of
[3:20] this
[3:21] messenger now here's the angel on earth
[3:24] and another angel mighty
[3:27] messenger come down see this angel was
[3:31] an earthly angel
[3:33] messenger but here comes one down from
[3:35] heaven
[3:37] rainbow covenant
[3:40] only christ it could be just exactly
[3:43] like was in revelations
[3:45] standing in the midst of the seven
[3:46] golden candlesticks with a rainbow
[3:49] the look upon as jasper and saristol
[3:53] and here he returns back in the 10th
[3:55] chapter after the
[3:56] coming time and all the mysteries is to
[3:59] be finished and the seals are to be
[4:01] broke
[4:01] and proclaiming that it's time is no
[4:04] more
[4:07] and he said when the seventh angel has
[4:09] begun to sound
[4:12] then the mystery should be finished and
[4:14] time for the angel to appear
[4:16] now notice the seven
[4:19] seals holds the mystery
[4:22] of the moon
[4:25] until we can see what those seven
[4:29] seals has sealed in we're only
[4:32] pursuing them things but god in
[4:35] every statement and everything has to
[4:39] vindicate it to make it right so
[4:42] his children will watch those things
[4:46] be alert and the book will not
[4:50] the seals will not be released until the
[4:53] message of the seventh angel but the
[4:57] genuine revelation of god
[5:00] will be made perfect in that sound
[5:03] vindicated truth and this seven seal
[5:06] book
[5:07] remember it was closed here in
[5:10] revelations the fifth chapter
[5:12] and in revelations the 10th chapter it
[5:15] is open
[5:16] now we're going to see what the book
[5:17] says about how it becomes open
[5:20] and is not made known until
[5:24] the lamb takes the book and breaks the
[5:26] seals
[5:27] and opens the book the lamb's got to
[5:30] take the book
[5:32] now and it is not made known
[5:35] until the lamb takes the book and breaks
[5:38] the seals because remember
[5:39] the book was being holded
[5:43] in the hands of him that's set up on the
[5:45] throne
[5:47] and the lamb comes to him that sits upon
[5:50] them
[5:50] and takes the book out of his right hand
[5:53] takes the book
[5:55] oh that's deep we'll try to solve it out
[5:58] if we can
[5:58] by the help of the holy spirit there
[6:00] will be the sounding of the seventh
[6:03] angel's voice
[6:04] and then the book will be revealed at
[6:07] that time
[6:08] now don't say no about that people had
[6:10] saved back there
[6:11] but the mysteries that they couldn't
[6:13] understand
[6:14] how that god can be three and yet one oh
[6:17] so many things how can eve eat an apple
[6:21] and uh
[6:21] because the wreckage of the whole world
[6:24] [Music]
[6:27] how can these things be and the seals
[6:30] are to be opened by the lamb and
[6:32] revealed to the church and that time
[6:34] is no more
[6:35] [Music]
[6:37] how wonderful now let's read
[6:40] uh a scripture i got written down here
[6:42] ephesians 1
[6:44] 13 and 14
[6:49] now in whom we also
[6:52] trusted after that you heard the word of
[6:56] truth
[6:57] and the gospel of your salvation in whom
[6:59] after
[7:00] that you believe you were sealed with
[7:03] the
[7:03] holy spirit of promise which is the
[7:06] earnest
[7:07] of our inheritance until
[7:11] the redemption of the
[7:15] the session unto the praise of his glory
[7:20] see now while we got the scriptures
[7:24] open let us uh see the holy spirit
[7:28] air itself is a seal
[7:33] the holy spirit is a seal and a seal
[7:38] signifies what a finished
[7:41] work the holy spirit being a seal to the
[7:46] individual
[7:47] like i used to work for the railroad
[7:48] company and uh with little
[7:50] box cars with cans and different things
[7:53] from the canning factory and
[7:55] but then before that car could be sealed
[7:57] the inspector come around
[8:00] the sea of that car was properly loaded
[8:03] and that inspector would test everything
[8:06] to see if it was properly in place if it
[8:09] wasn't he condemned the car
[8:11] then we had to do it all over again
[8:13] until the inspector
[8:15] was satisfied then when the inspector's
[8:19] satisfied
[8:20] he shuts it over the inspector shuts the
[8:23] door
[8:24] and the inspector places a seal upon it
[8:28] and then no one can break this seal
[8:31] until it reaches its destination
[8:36] that's what the holy spirit's been doing
[8:38] [Music]
[8:40] he goes and he inspects the holy spirit
[8:43] inspects that person until he's steadily
[8:46] satisfied
[8:48] and knows that they are then they are
[8:51] sealed
[8:53] on to their eternal destination
[8:57] there's not nothing can ever break that
[9:00] seal
[9:01] the bible you're putting your scripture
[9:04] ephesians 4
[9:05] 30 said grieve not the holy spirit of
[9:09] god
[9:11] whereby ye are sealed
[9:14] until the day of your redemption
[9:18] hold that word redemption
[9:22] the day that the book of redemption has
[9:25] been revealed and the redeemer comes to
[9:28] claim is
[9:28] possession or another thing a seal
[9:32] uh signifies his ownership
[9:35] when you are bought by the blood of
[9:37] jesus christ and sealed by the holy
[9:39] ghost you no longer belong to the world
[9:41] or anything pertaining to the world
[9:43] you are owned by god another thing is
[9:47] a seal is a security seal means you are
[9:51] secure
[9:54] you don't believe in eternal security i
[9:55] don't know but now
[9:57] but a seal signifies security to its
[10:01] destination
[10:07] and the holy spirit seal cannot be
[10:09] broken
[10:11] you know i've heard me say that people
[10:12] said the devil maybe do this no no
[10:15] there will not do it she just wants to
[10:17] see me
[10:19] because when you're sealed in he's
[10:21] sealed out
[10:25] now amen you went out to him
[10:31] he couldn't get into you because the
[10:32] only way to get into you is come through
[10:33] the same process that you have
[10:35] you'd have to be saved sanctified and
[10:38] filled with the holy ghost
[10:39] let it be your brother so see so
[10:42] he didn't do it you just went to the
[10:46] borderline and come back
[10:47] lusting for the things of the world you
[10:49] never went all the way over in the
[10:51] kingdom you see across jordan
[10:53] the death the self amen
[10:56] now notice now this
[11:00] book is sealed and and you are
[11:03] seated with the book until the day of
[11:06] redemption
[11:07] now 8 romans
[11:10] 8 22.
[11:14] to begin for we know
[11:17] that the whole creation
[11:21] groaneth and travail in pain
[11:25] together now
[11:30] and not only they but ourselves also
[11:34] which have the first fruits of the
[11:36] spirit
[11:38] even we ourselves grown within ourselves
[11:42] waiting for the adoption to whip
[11:45] the redemption of our bodies
[11:51] go and make us all folks feel good
[11:56] not to make us all feel good

[12:08] the first resurrection
[12:10] see nature is growing
[12:13] we are growing everything
[12:17] is groaning because
[12:20] we realize there's something not right
[12:25] and the only way you can groan and wait
[12:27] for it
[12:28] is because there has been new life
[12:30] coming here that speaks of a new world
[12:34] now break the seals and
[12:37] released all the mysteries
[12:40] to them to the seventh angel
