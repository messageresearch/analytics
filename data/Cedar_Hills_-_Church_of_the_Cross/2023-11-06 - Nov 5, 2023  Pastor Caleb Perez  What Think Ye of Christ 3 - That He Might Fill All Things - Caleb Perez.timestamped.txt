[18:27] Thanksgiving
[18:28] [Music]
[18:31] amen Shalom Primos Shalom Primos I have
[18:35] a Thanksgiving to the Lord Jesus
[18:38] Christ on October 18th the day after my
[18:45] birthday brother timis prayed for
[18:49] me asking the Lord to keep me
[18:52] safe bless me with
[18:55] health and bless me to prosper
[19:00] and the very next day I received a call
[19:02] from my
[19:05] supervisor informing me that there were
[19:07] some abnormalities from my annual
[19:10] firefighter
[19:12] [Music]
[19:16] physical from over from over a month
[19:19] earlier and that I could not return to
[19:22] duty until I consult with the
[19:27] specialist
[19:29] I must admit that
[19:33] initially I was a little
[19:36] shocked then the shock almost turned to
[19:38] anger because Satan was threatening my
[19:41] [Music]
[19:46] livelihood but the Lord reminded me not
[19:48] to allow the enemy to steal my Shalom my
[19:52] peace and trust in
[19:57] him
[19:59] then after informing my wife as to my
[20:04] situation she immediately reminded me of
[20:07] our recent subject from Bible
[20:09] [Music]
[20:12] Study Bible
[20:16] study which
[20:18] is which is that I have shamida the
[20:21] Lord's
[20:22] [Music]
[20:25] release Shila
[20:31] and that he has already paid that bill
[20:33] for
[20:36] me so there was no need to
[20:40] worry during my first call to a
[20:44] specialist I was informed that they were
[20:47] booking out an an appointment for late
[20:53] February so I consulted with brother Tim
[20:56] and sister Bonnie
[20:59] for guidance and to see if she knew of a
[21:02] specialist who may be able to help me
[21:09] out but the next day which was
[21:16] Friday before I could call Sister
[21:18] Bonnie's
[21:22] contact I received a call from my
[21:25] immediate supervisor and best friend's
[21:27] wife
[21:31] that I would be receiving a call on
[21:33] Monday from a doctor's office to confirm
[21:35] an appointment for
[21:39] me for Tuesday
[21:42] morning after undergoing some
[21:47] test and Consulting with the
[21:50] specialist I was immediately cleared for
[21:54] work then as I was driving to work and
[21:58] praising the Lord I received a
[22:02] [Music]
[22:07] revelation that not only did the Lord
[22:09] know of the test I would have to
[22:13] [Music]
[22:16] endure but he had already blessed me
[22:18] with the reward for trusting in
[22:22] Him although I had to miss one day of
[22:26] work the Lord Jesus Christ had already
[22:29] set me up with an extra 16 hours of
[22:32] overtime for

[22:40] doctor's appointment with the
[22:43] specialist and a full overtime shift a

[44:29] got it all right Matthew 22:41 42 says
[44:33] while the Pharisees were gathered
[44:35] together Jesus asked
[44:42] them saying what think ye of
[44:49] Christ whose son is
[44:51] he they say unto him the son of David
[44:57] father almighty
[45:00] God we simply come today
[45:05] Lord father having placed ourselves to
[45:07] one
[45:10] side Lord may it be you that comes Lord
[45:14] on the
[45:17] scene may they not see brother
[45:21] Caleb but may they see and may they hear
[45:23] you Lord this morning
[45:28] May the words that come
[45:30] forth Lord may they be your
[45:34] words that are both spirit and they are
[45:38] life and Lord may as it goes forth may
[45:41] it Quicken to the hearts of the
[45:47] people and may each one Lord receive
[45:49] what they came for
[45:53] today we thank you as we leave ourselves
[45:56] in this service in your
[45:59] hands in the name of the Lord Jesus
[46:02] Christ amen you may be
[46:06] seated
[46:08] remember the quote that we have read
[46:10] with this
[46:13] scripture your decision on what the
[46:16] scripture
[46:20] asked will seal your Eternal destination
[46:27] what a what a thing it is huh doesn't
[46:30] get old it's a tremendous thing to
[46:38] understand what think ye of
[46:41] Christ ask your neighbor real quick
[46:44] nebor what do you think of
[46:46] Christ it's a good
[46:49] question because many people have their
[46:51] own ideas of who and what Christ
[46:54] is
[46:57] and it's impossible in one message to
[46:59] tell you everything that Christ
[47:04] is but we'll go in the line that God has
[47:07] that he leads us this
[47:12] morning the word Christ in Greek is
[47:18] Christos which means the anointed
[47:22] one also means the Messiah
[47:27] and and here Jesus the
[47:30] Messiah the
[47:32] Christ is actually asking them what they
[47:36] think of
[47:39] him but he's not telling them that who
[47:42] he
[47:43] is he's just asking them the
[47:47] question in the Jewish
[47:54] eschatology the term term Mash or
[47:59] Messiah it refers to the Future Jewish
[48:06] King that was to come from the deic
[48:11] line who is expected to save the nation
[48:14] of is of
[48:17] Israel and will be
[48:20] Anointed with holy anointing
[48:24] oil and rule the Jewish
[48:28] people during the Messianic
[48:31] age now that's what they
[48:35] say we we know better than
[48:38] that because their eyes were
[48:43] blinded and I think we should thank the
[48:45] Lord this
[48:48] morning that their eyes were blinded for
[48:50] our
[48:52] sake I don't know about you but I I
[48:54] thank the Lord for
[48:57] that if they would have seen that Jesus
[49:00] was the
[49:03] Christ the great Messiah that they were
[49:06] waiting
[49:08] for we would never have had an
[49:13] opportunity but we know that Jesus they
[49:16] don't see this but that Jesus is the
[49:18] Messiah how many agree with
[49:22] that and we know brother Bram says that
[49:24] he's already been
[49:28] anointed yes everybody knows that he's
[49:30] already been
[49:32] anointed he doesn't have to be anointed
[49:35] again it's the same way as the
[49:39] temple the Temple of
[49:43] Solomon it was dedicated
[49:46] anointed when it was knocked down and
[49:50] they rebuilt the
[49:51] temple they didn't have to anoint it
[49:54] again already
[49:57] there but now when we when we see the
[50:01] Christ and and maybe maybe on the next
[50:04] time I
[50:07] Minister I sure would like to go into
[50:10] anointing the most
[50:14] holy but let's let's go for a moment
[50:17] here to acts the second chapter and I
[50:19] pray you have your Bibles here because
[50:23] it's we've got a lot of scriptures so
[50:26] get your Bibles out and I pray that you
[50:29] learn this
[50:31] morning nobody's in a hurry this
[50:34] morning okay then let's let's find out
[50:37] about
[50:39] this he was anointed
[50:42] already who anointed
[50:45] him God anointed
[50:48] him okay yes or yes see see we we we
[50:53] understand the the the different the
[50:55] anointing in the types and
[50:59] shadows but acts 236
[51:03] says therefore let all the house of
[51:07] Israel know
[51:11] assuredly now now this is tremendous
[51:14] because they were
[51:16] blinded but even though as a nation or
[51:19] or as a people they were
[51:23] blinded the the first church that that
[51:26] that the people that that made up the
[51:28] first church
[51:31] age a lot of them were
[51:34] Jews that's one of the tremendous things
[51:36] that's one of the
[51:38] Mysteries how that the church was the
[51:40] early church was made up with both Jews
[51:42] and
[51:45] Gentiles but here he says that God hath
[51:47] made that same
[51:51] Jesus whom ye have
[51:54] crucified made him both Lord and
[51:58] Christ in other words he made him both
[52:01] Supreme author having supreme
[52:05] authority he made him the master the
[52:10] controller and he made him the anointed
[52:15] Messiah now but but they don't see this
[52:18] as I said because they were blinded to
[52:22] this the Bible tells us and you can just
[52:25] write it down 11:25 of the book of
[52:31] Romans that blindness in part is
[52:34] happened to
[52:38] Israel
[52:40] until another words there was something
[52:44] coming until the
[52:47] fullness of the Gentiles become
[52:52] in now now they're blinded in part when
[52:55] once
[52:56] again but there's something that's going
[52:58] to
[53:00] happen that will contribute to them
[53:04] receiving their sight
[53:07] again I don't know if you know how
[53:09] important we are to the plan of
[53:15] God blindness in part is happened to
[53:20] Israel until the fullness of the
[53:23] Gentiles become come in
[53:27] in other words until the
[53:31] fullness of what Christ was going to
[53:34] pour into the
[53:38] church has been poured into
[53:42] it that's easy enough
[53:44] right amen and and and then the last
[53:48] member coming
[53:51] in that's why we put a subtitle as he
[53:54] might feel all
[53:57] things godes that's why we don't believe
[54:01] in
[54:04] sprinkling right there's no there's no
[54:06] scripture for
[54:08] that to just
[54:11] sprinkle now full
[54:14] immersion God doesn't want to just feel
[54:16] part of
[54:18] you he wants to feel all of
[54:22] you he wants to fill every part of your
[54:24] body Spirit
[54:27] Soul he wants to fill your your
[54:30] mind he wants to fill all space and
[54:35] time that's who he was in the
[54:38] beginning he was
[54:40] Elohim he existed of
[54:43] himself but he filled all space and
[54:48] time how many of you want him to fill
[54:51] all this space right
[54:54] here how many of you want him to fill
[54:56] all your
[54:58] time if he filled all our
[55:02] time we wouldn't have time to get into
[55:06] trouble we wouldn't have time to think
[55:08] of the things we think
[55:11] of but he wants to fill all space and
[55:14] all
[55:16] time that's the only way that he will
[55:19] ever have preeminence in
[55:22] us if I were to ask you the question
[55:25] question how many of you does does
[55:28] Christ have total preeminence
[55:33] in that's a question for you to ask
[55:37] yourself I don't need to I don't need to
[55:39] see
[55:41] hands but once again how many of you
[55:43] does Christ have total
[55:48] preeminence the only way that he can
[55:51] have full
[55:54] preeminence
[55:56] is that he must be in
[55:59] you and you must be in
[56:03] [Applause]
[56:04] him I I I hope that doesn't confuse
[56:08] you he's got to be in
[56:10] you and you got to be in
[56:13] him that's full
[56:16] preeminence now notice this now in that
[56:20] day you shall
[56:22] know that I am in the father
[56:26] the father is in
[56:28] me I in you and you in me total
[56:34] preeminence all
[56:37] right when we see this Colossians the
[56:40] first
[56:43] chapter and the 15th
[56:46] verse what do you think of
[56:49] Christ who is
[56:51] he well Paul tells us
[56:56] colians who is the
[56:58] image of the invisible
[57:04] God the firstborn of every
[57:09] creature in other words there was no
[57:11] image to
[57:15] Elohim there was no
[57:19] form brother brandham says it's too
[57:23] mysterious as much as you would want to
[57:26] to
[57:28] imagine your imagination barely goes up
[57:32] a little bit and
[57:34] then it covers
[57:37] everything and nothing
[57:41] moves there's nothing there it seems
[57:44] like it anyways
[57:46] nothing covers all space and
[57:49] time and our imagination is working
[57:53] Overdrive
[57:55] I want to understand you Lord I want to
[57:57] know
[57:58] you so we're we're there in the
[58:02] darkness trying to understand
[58:05] Elohim but he did something for
[58:08] us he says I'm going to create I'm going
[58:11] to birth off of
[58:15] myself once again God giving
[58:18] birth and he gives birth to the
[58:23] logos and the logos is
[58:26] Christ that's the
[58:29] anointing that's the pillar of
[58:31] fire that's the great
[58:34] theophany we can go on and on he's the
[58:38] image of the invisible
[58:40] God and without him you can't see
[58:44] him for by him were all things
[58:50] created that are in
[58:53] heaven and that are in
[58:56] visible and
[58:57] invisible whether they be Thrones or
[59:01] dominions principalities or
[59:05] Powers all things were created by
[59:10] Him and for
[59:12] him and he is before all
[59:16] things and by him all things
[59:22] consist and he is the head of the body
[59:26] the church who is the
[59:29] beginning the first born from the
[59:33] dead that in all
[59:37] things can we say that together in all
[59:41] things he might have
[59:45] preeminence for it pleased the
[59:49] father that in him should all fullness
[59:57] dwell preeminence means that he's number
[1:00:01] one right he's number one in
[1:00:05] rank he's number one in
[1:00:11] influence right come on
[1:00:14] everybody there's a lot of influence out
[1:00:17] there
[1:00:19] influ right but he's number one in
[1:00:23] influence number one in
[1:00:26] rank once again how many can
[1:00:30] say I have given him full
[1:00:35] preeminence what think you of
[1:00:38] Christ if you say you're in love with
[1:00:42] him but you don't give him full
[1:00:46] preeminence you're showing how you're
[1:00:47] answering the
[1:00:50] question think he of
[1:00:52] Christ Colossians 29
[1:00:55] n for in
[1:00:58] him dwelleth part of the
[1:01:04] godhead yes or no or no come on I need
[1:01:08] you alive I need you alert this
[1:01:11] morning for in him dwelleth three
[1:01:14] quarters of the
[1:01:18] godhead in
[1:01:20] him dwelleth the fullness of the godhead
[1:01:24] bottle
[1:01:28] the fullness is the
[1:01:31] completion the godhead is the
[1:01:36] Divinity and the bodily is the Corporal
[1:01:39] or the
[1:01:42] physical so when we see what really is
[1:01:45] going
[1:01:47] on what think ye of
[1:01:50] Christ the entire
[1:01:53] Bible is the
[1:01:56] revelation of God's mystery in
[1:02:00] Christ yes or yes the entire
[1:02:04] Bible is the expression of one
[1:02:08] goal one
[1:02:10] purpose that he wanted to
[1:02:14] achieve and now in these last
[1:02:18] days this secret this
[1:02:22] mystery that was in the back part of
[1:02:24] God's
[1:02:26] mind now in this last
[1:02:30] day he has revealed it and he has showed
[1:02:35] it he hides it from the the the the eyes
[1:02:39] from the from the wise of and
[1:02:42] prudent and he reveals it unto babes
[1:02:44] such as
[1:02:46] wom Christ he is the principal
[1:02:52] theme of the entire Bible
[1:02:55] you can't if you can't see Christ in
[1:02:58] every verse of the
[1:03:01] Bible then you read it
[1:03:03] again because you missed
[1:03:06] something the Bible is
[1:03:09] Christ he is the
[1:03:11] word tell your neighbor the Bible is
[1:03:15] Christ he is the
[1:03:17] word when you read in the beginning God
[1:03:23] created there's
[1:03:26] Christ yes or yes in the beginning God
[1:03:31] Christ is
[1:03:32] there oh we're getting into some some
[1:03:35] good
[1:03:36] stuff and if put together
[1:03:39] right there is the entire
[1:03:44] picture of the
[1:03:46] fall and
[1:03:49] regeneration the whole picture of
[1:03:53] creation and God's whole
[1:03:56] plan revealed right there in Jesus
[1:04:01] Christ he's the principal theme of The
[1:04:05] Bible we've read this many times he was
[1:04:08] in the
[1:04:10] prophets he was in the
[1:04:12] Psalms he was in the history of the
[1:04:15] Bible the Bible is a prophetic
[1:04:19] book it's a historical
[1:04:21] book it's a book of love
[1:04:25] it's a book of
[1:04:27] songs it's a book of
[1:04:29] life and in there you find
[1:04:33] Christ he was in the
[1:04:35] prophets in the Psalms in the history in
[1:04:40] the Bible is the things that is to
[1:04:44] come and he will be before and
[1:04:48] after what does that make him
[1:04:51] then the same yesterday today
[1:04:56] and then if he is
[1:04:58] that he should be the Principal theme of
[1:05:02] our
[1:05:05] talking what think you of
[1:05:08] Christ he should be the Principal theme
[1:05:10] of our
[1:05:13] talking of our thinking of our
[1:05:16] singing of our
[1:05:18] walks he should be the Principal theme
[1:05:21] of our
[1:05:23] life if he's the principal theme of The
[1:05:27] Bible and the Bible is in
[1:05:30] us then he should be the Principal
[1:05:34] them of everything we
[1:05:37] do
[1:05:38] say or
[1:05:40] think it should be
[1:05:45] Christ I think that would be enough for
[1:05:47] me just to walk down and say
[1:05:51] God just to live that
[1:05:58] wow don't have to try to live anything
[1:06:00] just live
[1:06:03] that think ye of
[1:06:06] Christ when we see
[1:06:08] this if he's not then the
[1:06:12] Bible or if he's not in
[1:06:14] you then the word is not in
[1:06:17] you and the only way you can actually be
[1:06:20] a
[1:06:23] Christian for Christ to identify himself
[1:06:27] in
[1:06:29] you once again in
[1:06:33] him Christ dwelt the fullness of the
[1:06:36] godhead
[1:06:39] body now now now this is is something
[1:06:42] that that really gets
[1:06:46] me because that's as far as the
[1:06:49] Revelation goes to many
[1:06:53] people
[1:06:54] in him dwelt the fullness of the
[1:06:58] God he expressed himself God expressing
[1:07:03] himself and that's where the church
[1:07:06] stops that's as far as the religious
[1:07:09] people
[1:07:10] go everything was poured into
[1:07:14] Christ thank God once again that he
[1:07:16] would send a
[1:07:19] prophet the Revelation continues
[1:07:22] now
[1:07:24] you must see Christ in every
[1:07:28] verse in every
[1:07:30] song but you better see the bride there
[1:07:36] too you better see yourself
[1:07:40] there what good would it
[1:07:42] do to see Christ in every
[1:07:46] scripture but you don't see
[1:07:48] yourself you don't see the
[1:07:51] bride something's wrong here we have not
[1:07:54] really understood Christ the
[1:07:59] mystery it was to reveal this this is in
[1:08:02] the message Christ is
[1:08:05] the first it was to reveal himself in
[1:08:10] Christ the fullness of the godhead
[1:08:16] bodily and
[1:08:18] then I like that it's a continuation
[1:08:21] here and then to bring that fullness of
[1:08:24] the godhead
[1:08:27] bod bring it into the people
[1:08:32] now are we are we making sense
[1:08:36] here we he he he he was the
[1:08:39] fullness in him was the fullness of the
[1:08:42] godhead
[1:08:44] bodily but now he wants to take that and
[1:08:47] put that into the
[1:08:51] people that he might he all
[1:08:56] things again all that God was he poured
[1:08:59] into
[1:09:01] Christ and all that Christ was he poured
[1:09:03] into the
[1:09:05] church watch what he says
[1:09:07] here he wants to bring the fullness of
[1:09:10] the godhead
[1:09:12] bodily into a
[1:09:15] people that he could have the
[1:09:22] pinen the
[1:09:25] oversight the
[1:09:27] leading and
[1:09:29] now tell your neighbor
[1:09:32] Now read that with me and
[1:09:35] now the complete fullness of the godhead
[1:09:41] Bly dwells in his
[1:09:44] church the
[1:09:47] preeminence I want you to say it
[1:09:49] again and says now the complete compl
[1:09:55] fullness of the godhead
[1:09:58] bodily dwells in
[1:10:03] us right I'm not going to stay just stay
[1:10:06] with dwells in the
[1:10:08] church part of that bride I
[1:10:11] believe so the fullness of the godhead
[1:10:13] body dwells in not one of
[1:10:17] us but it dwells in
[1:10:21] us the mystical body of the Lord Jesus
[1:10:26] Christ The Works that I do shall you do
[1:10:30] also that's why he says behold I send
[1:10:33] you Elijah the
[1:10:36] prophet and he shall turn the hearts of
[1:10:38] the
[1:10:40] children back to the faith of the
[1:10:43] fathers and in
[1:10:45] there there would be a Time
[1:10:49] come there would be a Time come forth
[1:10:55] is that
[1:10:58] future or is it now come on church
[1:11:03] now in there would be a Time come
[1:11:08] forth when he could express
[1:11:12] himself in the fullness of his godhead
[1:11:19] deity through his
[1:11:22] church have the
[1:11:55] what a thing no wonder in 1 Timothy
[1:12:01] 3:16 he says without
[1:12:05] controversy great is the mystery
[1:12:10] of God manifest In the
[1:12:14] Flesh justified in the
[1:12:17] spirit being of
[1:12:19] angels preached unto the
[1:12:22] Gentiles believed on in the
[1:12:26] world received up into
[1:12:29] Glory he wants to fill
[1:12:33] us
[1:12:34] every every
[1:12:37] corner he don't want you to have some
[1:12:41] little fake
[1:12:45] door but Brother Carlos what is it
[1:12:47] called in a kitchen there's
[1:12:50] a oh yeah it's a fake door
[1:12:55] you open it up it goes into
[1:12:57] a
[1:13:02] pantry know right and we have a lot of
[1:13:04] those Butler pantries
[1:13:10] in and we always expect God to do
[1:13:12] something for us right away
[1:13:15] right but we're not completely honest
[1:13:18] with him all the
[1:13:22] time
[1:13:24] okay notice this now be careful what we
[1:13:28] fill ourselves up
[1:13:32] with
[1:13:33] ideas oh that's a good
[1:13:36] idea ever say that it's a good idea yeah
[1:13:40] means that means that you that you
[1:13:42] swallowed it line and
[1:13:50] sing Creeds and dogmas
[1:13:55] doctrines and people are being filled
[1:13:58] every
[1:14:02] day Israel says we're going to wipe out
[1:14:08] Hamas they were interviewing a
[1:14:11] man and he said
[1:14:14] this Hamas isn't just an organization or
[1:14:17] a
[1:14:22] people Hamas is an
[1:14:27] idea when that idea gets
[1:14:31] hold you can try to kill the
[1:14:34] people but the idea it's hard to
[1:14:37] eradicate
[1:14:43] it it's easier to kill a human than to
[1:14:46] kill an
[1:14:51] idea you can try to eradicate iate the
[1:14:56] people but it's so hard to eradicate an
[1:15:01] idea that has found a home in the mind
[1:15:05] in the heart of the person that
[1:15:09] believes it's hard to eradicate an idea
[1:15:11] that there's purpose behind
[1:15:16] it but I thank the Lord this
[1:15:19] morning and I praise him because God's
[1:15:23] thoughts have been
[1:15:27] expressed look what they tried to do to
[1:15:29] the Jews in World War
[1:15:32] II they tried to eradicate
[1:15:35] them but they
[1:15:37] couldn't nor will they ever accomplish
[1:15:41] that because they are God's
[1:15:44] people and the
[1:15:47] logos which is not just an
[1:15:50] idea but it is the thought
[1:15:54] it is the word it is the Divine
[1:15:59] expression of God's
[1:16:02] thoughts and they can never be
[1:16:06] eradicated you can't kill that what is
[1:16:10] eternal remember it's hard to kill an
[1:16:14] idea get into the church
[1:16:18] World prophet of God says you know
[1:16:20] there's there's really two extreme or
[1:16:22] radical
[1:16:26] ideas the first one is that God is
[1:16:30] three that there are three
[1:16:33] Gods three
[1:16:34] persons that's a radical
[1:16:37] idea are to kill that
[1:16:42] idea that God is father son Holy
[1:16:47] Ghost three people making up the
[1:16:51] godhead no no
[1:16:54] it's three
[1:16:56] offices now that should eradicate that
[1:17:01] idea unless the idea has settled in your
[1:17:07] heart then you're going to need some
[1:17:11] certain the next idea he says is Jesus
[1:17:16] only a radical idea
[1:17:19] too because Jesus
[1:17:21] only you're making Jesus his own
[1:17:27] father and Jesus had a
[1:17:30] father they're both radically
[1:17:35] wrong but remember now it is one God in
[1:17:41] three
[1:17:42] offices coming down created a blood
[1:17:47] cell a body was
[1:17:50] formed and he filled that body
[1:17:55] oh wow now that's that's that's that's
[1:17:57] too much for the human
[1:17:59] mind because we say how could he all
[1:18:02] eternity and expand and and fill
[1:18:04] everything and then and then he comes
[1:18:06] down into a
[1:18:10] body this is ABCs
[1:18:13] right but there's a lot of new people
[1:18:15] and that's what I'm I'm after
[1:18:18] this I want to help them bring them up
[1:18:22] to this to
[1:18:24] understanding he then gave a his life a
[1:18:28] ransom and through the broken blood
[1:18:33] cell God's own life was let
[1:18:38] loose and it returned on the
[1:18:42] worshipper God doesn't do nothing
[1:18:46] halfway we can go through acts the
[1:18:48] second chapter and just write it down
[1:18:50] real
[1:18:51] quick that's the day of
[1:18:54] Pentecost there was a sound of a rushing
[1:18:56] Mighty
[1:18:58] Wind and it filled all the
[1:19:01] house okay he's
[1:19:03] filling and they were all filled with
[1:19:06] the Holy
[1:19:07] Ghost we keep on reading these
[1:19:10] scriptures like John 1
[1:19:15] verse4 the word was made
[1:19:18] flesh dwelt amongst us and we beheld his
[1:19:22] glory
[1:19:23] the glory as of the only begotten of the
[1:19:27] father full of grace and
[1:19:30] truth verse 16 and of his
[1:19:34] fullness of his
[1:19:36] fullness have all we
[1:19:40] received and Grace for
[1:19:43] Grace I like that
[1:19:46] scripture Ephesians
[1:19:49] 3:19 and to know the love of Christ
[1:19:53] which passes
[1:19:56] knowledge that ye might be
[1:20:00] filled with all the fullness of
[1:20:05] God tell everywhere we look we see
[1:20:10] Christ that Caleb might be
[1:20:15] filled but put your name there that
[1:20:18] Caleb might be
[1:20:21] filled with the fullness of
[1:20:24] God Ephesians
[1:20:28] 1:9 having made known unto
[1:20:31] us the mystery of his
[1:20:34] will according to his good
[1:20:37] pleasure which he hath purposed in
[1:20:42] himself that in the dispensation of the
[1:20:45] fullness of
[1:20:49] times he might gather together in one
[1:20:54] all things in Christ both which are in
[1:20:58] heaven which are on
[1:21:00] earth even in him verse 22 and hath put
[1:21:04] all things under his
[1:21:07] feet and gave him to be the head over
[1:21:10] all things to the
[1:21:15] church which is his
[1:21:18] body the fullness of
[1:21:21] him that f
[1:21:23] all in
[1:21:27] all how does that fullness
[1:21:31] come are you with me
[1:21:33] still we're building a good foundation
[1:21:36] here how does this fullness
[1:21:40] come let's let's find
[1:21:42] out Ephesians the fourth
[1:21:45] chapter verse
[1:21:48] 10 he that
[1:21:50] descended is the same also
[1:21:53] so that ascended up far above all
[1:21:59] Heavens that he might fill all
[1:22:04] things are you included
[1:22:06] there I'm talking about that he might
[1:22:09] fill all
[1:22:11] things how is he filling all
[1:22:14] things he gave some
[1:22:17] Apostles some
[1:22:19] prophets some
[1:22:21] evangelists some pastor
[1:22:23] and teachers for the perfecting of the
[1:22:27] Saints for the work of the
[1:22:30] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[1:22:33] Christ till we all come in the unity of
[1:22:36] the
[1:22:38] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[1:22:42] God unto a perfect
[1:22:45] man to the measure of the
[1:22:51] stature of the stature of the fullness
[1:22:55] of
[1:22:57] Christ Christ is the
[1:23:00] anointing is the anointed one the
[1:23:04] logos and the family
[1:23:08] comes through that
[1:23:11] anointing okay now I I say all these
[1:23:15] things and and here we're going to we're
[1:23:16] going to start getting
[1:23:20] into if God created man in his own
[1:23:25] image and in his own
[1:23:28] likeness what kind of man did he
[1:23:33] create created a spirit
[1:23:37] man but you can't see a
[1:23:41] spirit he made man in his own
[1:23:44] image because man was supposed to lead
[1:23:47] the cattles and the
[1:23:50] Beast just the same way that the the
[1:23:52] Holy Spirit leads the believer
[1:23:56] today so out of God came this
[1:24:00] logos and out of the logos forth a
[1:24:07] man no man has seen God at any
[1:24:10] time no man can see God in the bodily
[1:24:18] form because God is not in body form
[1:24:24] God is a
[1:24:27] spirit all right no man has seen the
[1:24:31] father but the only begotten of the
[1:24:34] father hath
[1:24:37] declared okay now here here we go now
[1:24:40] Genesis
[1:24:42] 126 God said let us make man in our
[1:24:47] image after our
[1:24:50] likeness now we are made in the image of
[1:24:54] God how many here have been were made in
[1:24:56] the image of
[1:24:58] God once again this is very
[1:25:01] important we are made in the image of
[1:25:05] God but we are not the
[1:25:10] image oh you got to you got to
[1:25:13] understand this
[1:25:14] church because if not then you're going
[1:25:16] to go off with some little
[1:25:18] ideas oh we're the image of God
[1:25:23] no no no the image of the invisible God
[1:25:27] was
[1:25:29] Christ not a bunch of men not a bunch of
[1:25:33] people the image of the invisible God is
[1:25:38] Christ so we are not the
[1:25:43] image even
[1:25:45] though we are images of
[1:25:49] Christ you got to you got to get is this
[1:25:52] is so
[1:25:54] important once again we are not the
[1:25:58] image we are images of
[1:26:02] Christ but we
[1:26:04] are his
[1:26:09] likeness all right all right okay we we
[1:26:13] got to make sure that this is settled
[1:26:15] good tell your neighbor neighbor we are
[1:26:18] not the
[1:26:20] image we are the likeness
[1:26:24] why brother Brandon preaches the message
[1:26:26] images of
[1:26:28] Christ why because it's him in
[1:26:31] us and we're producing The Works that he
[1:26:34] would
[1:26:35] do so we become
[1:26:39] images but we are actually his
[1:26:44] likeness oh I like
[1:26:47] this the
[1:26:49] likeness is the female part
[1:26:54] tell your neighbor the
[1:26:57] likess is the female
[1:26:59] part okay that's why he made both male
[1:27:02] and
[1:27:04] female the son of man would be revealed
[1:27:07] in the last
[1:27:10] days has it been
[1:27:14] revealed
[1:27:15] yes some say oh brother brandham he he
[1:27:18] was the son of
[1:27:20] man no he
[1:27:23] wasn't he was the
[1:27:27] [Applause]
[1:27:30] likeness Hallelujah I'm going to say it
[1:27:32] again was he the son of
[1:27:34] man no no he was a son of
[1:27:38] man revealing the son of
[1:27:41] man he was the
[1:27:43] likeness because he was one like
[1:27:49] unah okay I got you your attention now
[1:27:54] we're getting into the message
[1:27:55] now this is very
[1:27:58] important and not only him but but he
[1:28:02] has a
[1:28:04] bride and
[1:28:07] she is his
[1:28:13] likeness Watch this once
[1:28:16] again and the likeness is the
[1:28:20] bride and she is part of the ministry of
[1:28:23] the son of
[1:28:26] man and what is that
[1:28:30] Ministry to unite the bride and Grom
[1:28:35] together like Adam and
[1:28:37] Eve unite him together so he can restore
[1:28:41] the
[1:28:43] kingdom that's ABCs
[1:28:48] right are you are you the
[1:28:51] image
[1:28:53] Christ is the image of the invisible
[1:28:57] God we are his
[1:28:59] likeness now watch this now the bride
[1:29:02] when you read that
[1:29:04] scripture the bride once again is the
[1:29:08] likeness Jesus Christ is the image of
[1:29:11] the invisible
[1:29:12] God now watch our founding
[1:29:16] Pastor he said as God poured it into
[1:29:20] Christ
[1:29:22] Christ then poured it into the
[1:29:25] church then the
[1:29:28] bride in
[1:29:31] turn pours it back into
[1:29:36] Christ you you better you better get get
[1:29:38] your Chompers out that
[1:29:42] was that was a chunk of
[1:29:46] meat God all that he was pour into
[1:29:50] Christ was he pours into the
[1:29:53] church now the church pours it back into
[1:29:57] Christ let's see what he says you know
[1:30:00] what he
[1:30:04] says he said that was P that one passed
[1:30:07] right over our
[1:30:10] heads all right he says you might get it
[1:30:14] a little
[1:30:16] later this is this is a little
[1:30:19] later this is the now
[1:30:22] you're going to get it a little bit
[1:30:23] later but but this is the
[1:30:26] now because the
[1:30:29] bride she's got to
[1:30:33] rest oh we're getting pinch yourself I'm
[1:30:36] telling you forget about the and
[1:30:38] everything on the
[1:30:40] stove we got to get this spiritually
[1:30:45] first she's got to
[1:30:48] rest Jesus is
[1:30:50] resting he's got a different
[1:30:54] mask now the
[1:30:56] bride has to put on the image of the
[1:31:01] man and she can only do
[1:31:04] that by becoming bone of his
[1:31:08] bone flesh of his flesh Spirit of his
[1:31:13] spirit and when she
[1:31:16] does the spirit and the bride say
[1:31:20] come not until
[1:31:22] then watch he goes on watch the word
[1:31:27] rest in rest he
[1:31:32] uncovers he takes off his
[1:31:35] mask and all that God
[1:31:38] was that poured into
[1:31:41] Christ Christ was he poured into the
[1:31:44] church and that is his
[1:31:48] rest get all these points
[1:31:52] all that God was in Christ all that
[1:31:55] Christ is resting now in his
[1:32:00] church in his bride he's resting in
[1:32:03] you he's resting in what you're going to
[1:32:08] do show me show them show them what how
[1:32:11] to do
[1:32:12] this I trust you not until you're filled
[1:32:16] with the Holy
[1:32:17] Ghost you're under tutors and governors
[1:32:20] until that time
[1:32:23] that is his
[1:32:25] rest he's resting on what you're going
[1:32:27] to
[1:32:29] do his rest is nothing
[1:32:33] else but what you're
[1:32:36] doing if the Holy Ghost is resting in
[1:32:41] you then Christ has entered into his
[1:32:47] rest and then now you must enter into
[1:32:51] his
[1:32:53] rest and his
[1:32:55] rest is to do the will of the
[1:32:59] father that's the
[1:33:03] rest usually I'm going to go
[1:33:07] rest ah long been a long
[1:33:10] day not the rest he's talking
[1:33:13] about did you know that the Christian
[1:33:16] Life the Christian
[1:33:19] walk is based on rest
[1:33:23] and you can only fully rest when he has
[1:33:26] preeminence in your
[1:33:30] life watch as we go continue on still
[1:33:34] with
[1:33:36] me watch this now the man was placed in
[1:33:40] charge
[1:33:43] here as far as that's concerned I am a
[1:33:47] man the man that we have here yeah a man
[1:33:52] but in the mystical Body of
[1:33:56] Christ I'm not a
[1:33:58] man part of the bride of
[1:34:03] Christ right and brother brandham is not
[1:34:06] the man
[1:34:11] either he's part of the Bride
[1:34:15] also oh there are points where he stands
[1:34:20] there
[1:34:22] the the same as when uh a
[1:34:25] pastor the spiritual husband of a
[1:34:30] church but when you see the
[1:34:35] macro even the pastor is there
[1:34:38] is the bride of
[1:34:42] Christ he's there
[1:34:45] representing I don't have no problem
[1:34:46] with that in
[1:34:49] representation but the male
[1:34:52] is the Lord Jesus
[1:34:54] Christ he is the son of
[1:34:58] man watch this now this is what
[1:35:02] Elohim coming
[1:35:04] forth came forth from him the
[1:35:07] Loos and from the logos there was a that
[1:35:09] that was the
[1:35:12] light and from that light come out a
[1:35:15] man who made
[1:35:18] it God
[1:35:22] watch this is this this is nitty-gritty
[1:35:25] now who who made it
[1:35:27] God who made the
[1:35:30] man the Son of
[1:35:34] God oh that one that one that one didn't
[1:35:38] hit
[1:35:39] good that one didn't hit
[1:35:42] good the logos he calls the logos the
[1:35:45] Son of
[1:35:48] God he created all things
[1:35:52] you say only Elohim is the
[1:35:55] creator the spirit of
[1:35:58] Elohim went into the
[1:36:02] logos it was still him
[1:36:05] creating but now he had a
[1:36:09] form that's right he couldn't say let us
[1:36:12] make Man Without a
[1:36:15] form he couldn't say let us make man in
[1:36:17] the image and the likeness he couldn't
[1:36:19] do that there was no form
[1:36:24] but he could do it in the sense of that
[1:36:25] he created man the spirit
[1:36:29] first and then he began creation
[1:36:32] creation
[1:36:34] creation that was Christ the
[1:36:37] logos the angel of the
[1:36:40] Covenant come on you got to put your
[1:36:42] your floaties
[1:36:44] on we're going to go into some deep
[1:36:49] water anybody know how to dog padle
[1:36:51] [Music]
[1:36:54] you get tired though after a while
[1:36:56] huh pedling in church after a
[1:37:00] while I'm tired already
[1:37:03] overload no no get all the junk
[1:37:06] out this is what it's doing this morning
[1:37:09] clearing out the
[1:37:10] channels clearing out the
[1:37:15] junk the logos that came out of God
[1:37:18] brother Bram says was the son of God
[1:37:23] yet later on we're going to find
[1:37:25] out that he calls the logos the
[1:37:28] Everlasting or Eternal
[1:37:32] Father how can it be
[1:37:34] both we'll get to that
[1:37:37] question not today in another one
[1:37:41] but Christ lived in that
[1:37:44] body but watch now why that's why Jesus
[1:37:48] could
[1:37:49] say I come from
[1:37:52] God in other words I come from that
[1:37:56] logos I go back to God or back to the
[1:37:59] logos when Paul seen
[1:38:03] him he was the
[1:38:08] logos that's why when you see this
[1:38:12] picture oh they have a picture of a man
[1:38:17] there it's actually the picture of that
[1:38:20] logos
[1:38:23] right the light that came out of Elohim
[1:38:25] the
[1:38:27] beginning Angel of the
[1:38:31] Covenant that from there all things were
[1:38:36] created get all these little things no
[1:38:40] and when we see this
[1:38:42] now that same
[1:38:45] logos has a
[1:38:48] part yes amen I don't know are you are
[1:38:51] you bored this
[1:38:52] morning the same logos has a
[1:38:56] part that logos has a
[1:39:00] bride tell your neighbor say neighbor
[1:39:03] that
[1:39:04] logos has a bride and I'm a part of that
[1:39:09] bride Christ must and will have
[1:39:12] preeminence
[1:39:15] in who is this bride that came
[1:39:20] forth song of Solomon's chapter
[1:39:24] 6 verse 8 there are three score
[1:39:28] Queens that's 60
[1:39:32] queens and four score
[1:39:35] concubines and are virgins without
[1:39:39] number these are all the
[1:39:42] churches but my
[1:39:44] Dove my
[1:39:48] undefiled is only
[1:39:50] one
[1:39:52] I don't
[1:39:54] know that don't make you feel
[1:39:58] special Dove my undefiled is but
[1:40:03] one she is the only one of her
[1:40:07] mother she is the choice one of her that
[1:40:10] bear
[1:40:12] her watch what verse 10 says who is
[1:40:16] she that lookth forth as the
[1:40:19] morning Fair as the
[1:40:23] moon clear as the
[1:40:25] sun and terrible as an army with
[1:40:31] banners that is the Bride of the
[1:40:35] logos that is my
[1:40:38] Dove she's only
[1:40:40] one lots of churches this
[1:40:43] morning but she is only
[1:40:46] one Isaiah
[1:40:49] 545 for maker is thine
[1:40:54] husband the Lord of hosts is his
[1:40:58] name and thy Redeemer the Holy One of
[1:41:03] Israel let's see if they can eradicate
[1:41:08] that the god of the whole Earth shall he
[1:41:11] be
[1:41:13] called where did he get the material to
[1:41:15] make
[1:41:19] usow
[1:41:21] come on now where did he get the
[1:41:22] material
[1:41:24] from from
[1:41:30] himself where did he get the materials
[1:41:33] to to to form and to make
[1:41:38] Eve from the
[1:41:40] man he didn't go back to the dust he got
[1:41:43] it from the
[1:41:45] man he pulled a
[1:41:47] rib and the same
[1:41:49] way that he put Adam to
[1:41:53] sleep and pulled out one of his
[1:41:56] ribs the same way he did with
[1:42:00] Jesus they put him to
[1:42:03] death they put him to
[1:42:05] sleep and they thought they were killing
[1:42:08] him but it was actually the
[1:42:12] Fulfillment of what he had done in the
[1:42:14] Garden of
[1:42:16] Eden because it was them that he pulled
[1:42:19] out of him
[1:42:22] the bride of
[1:42:23] Christ you had to put him to sleep the
[1:42:26] same
[1:42:28] way now I want to turn a corner
[1:42:31] here Matthew 16 and this this is there's
[1:42:35] so much to preach on and
[1:42:38] I I'm not here to try to wear you out
[1:42:43] I'm but what think ye of
[1:42:47] Christ all right Matthew 16
[1:42:52] and you you you know this very well
[1:42:53] well-known
[1:42:56] scripture he saith unto them who who do
[1:42:58] you say that I
[1:43:01] am Peter said Thou Art the
[1:43:04] Christ the son of the Living
[1:43:08] God what a tremendous
[1:43:10] thing he knew who he was he stated who
[1:43:14] he was you're the Christ you're the
[1:43:17] Messiah the Son of the Living God said
[1:43:21] Simon you're you're
[1:43:23] blessed blessing blood didn't reveal
[1:43:25] this my Father which is in
[1:43:28] heaven and then he goes down to verse
[1:43:31] 20 and then he charged he his
[1:43:36] disciples that he should tell that they
[1:43:38] should tell no
[1:43:41] man that he was Jesus the
[1:43:45] Christ now watch this as we as we turn
[1:43:47] this
[1:43:49] corner you know
[1:43:52] now it's been
[1:43:54] revealed revealed to you
[1:43:57] all don't go and tell anyone
[1:44:00] else that he was the Christ the anointed
[1:44:04] one the
[1:44:06] Messiah is this not what we do many
[1:44:10] times we go and we hear something and we
[1:44:12] run with
[1:44:13] it did you know this did you know
[1:44:16] that but but do we live
[1:44:19] it
[1:44:21] here's the thing we got a lot of head
[1:44:24] knowledge about this the Bible
[1:44:27] the a lot we know a lot
[1:44:30] of but but when you when you really look
[1:44:33] at
[1:44:35] this that was the rock
[1:44:39] confession brother says now he conf
[1:44:42] confessed
[1:44:44] it he had the
[1:44:47] Revelation but his body hadn't caught up
[1:44:49] to it yet
[1:44:53] this is all he's telling
[1:44:55] them don't tell no
[1:44:57] man I am the Christ not yet why because
[1:45:02] your your body has to match up or or
[1:45:05] catch up to your
[1:45:08] confession when your body catches up to
[1:45:11] the
[1:45:13] confession then you can say he is the
[1:45:17] Christ many are with me now watch this
[1:45:21] we say a lot of things but but our body
[1:45:23] doesn't match
[1:45:26] up it's got to match
[1:45:29] up notice this is where I'm getting to
[1:45:32] John chapter
[1:45:33] 7 and verse 40 it it says just kind of
[1:45:37] paraphrase it here's a lot of the
[1:45:39] people they said of Truth this is the
[1:45:43] prophet others said this is the
[1:45:46] Christ but some said well shall Christ
[1:45:49] come out of Galilee
[1:45:52] you see they had been programmed
[1:45:55] already they had accepted another
[1:45:57] idea and said was he going to come out
[1:46:00] of
[1:46:01] Galilee wasn't he supposed to come of
[1:46:04] the seed of
[1:46:06] David the town of
[1:46:09] Bethlehem that was true they knew the
[1:46:13] scriptures they knew these
[1:46:15] things they just didn't know
[1:46:17] him and the Bible says so there was a
[1:46:20] ision among the people because of
[1:46:25] him now Satan is a spirit
[1:46:28] right know
[1:46:33] that when they say son of
[1:46:36] God Son of God is also
[1:46:42] Spirit Here Comes Satan
[1:46:44] now watch as I paint this picture for
[1:46:48] you in Luke the
[1:46:50] the the fourth
[1:46:54] chapter Sayan Sayan is is there he's the
[1:47:00] tempter and he comes to
[1:47:03] Jesus at this point he's not sure if he
[1:47:05] is the Son of God or
[1:47:09] not the scripture tells us that the
[1:47:12] devil said unto
[1:47:14] him if thou be the son of
[1:47:19] God
[1:47:20] now Satan's a spirit he needs a body to
[1:47:22] work
[1:47:25] through but watch here as he comes to
[1:47:29] Jesus now he sees a body of
[1:47:32] man that's what throws him
[1:47:35] off the logos becoming a
[1:47:38] man this is
[1:47:41] rough if thou be the Son of
[1:47:44] God after the God man defeats
[1:47:49] Satan
[1:47:51] he puts him in his
[1:47:53] place imagine the conversation that
[1:47:56] Jesus has with the
[1:48:00] demons he he gathers all his Devils
[1:48:05] together and he tells
[1:48:07] them I tried
[1:48:09] him I gave him my best
[1:48:13] shot he is the
[1:48:16] Christ after being
[1:48:19] defeated he had no doubts
[1:48:22] anymore there were no more
[1:48:25] ifs he is the Christ I thought I could
[1:48:29] trap
[1:48:30] him I thought I could Corner him I gave
[1:48:34] him my best
[1:48:35] offer he didn't
[1:48:38] budge he whipped
[1:48:40] me he whipped me with the
[1:48:43] word because I found out he is the
[1:48:46] word he is the Christ he is the son of
[1:48:50] God
[1:48:51] now now watch this the same
[1:48:54] chapter watch as as it goes a little bit
[1:48:57] further
[1:48:58] now in the same chapter verse 4 verse 40
[1:49:01] I'm sorry chapter 4 verse
[1:49:04] 40 watch when he says and now when the
[1:49:07] sun was
[1:49:08] setting his demons are back on
[1:49:12] track right they're doing their
[1:49:15] job all they had all their sick divers
[1:49:18] diseases they brought them to
[1:49:21] him he laid hands on every one of
[1:49:26] them killed them now watch The Devils
[1:49:32] now their
[1:49:35] General their
[1:49:38] Master which previously had said if thou
[1:49:41] be the Son of
[1:49:43] God but now he's told them yeah yeah he
[1:49:46] is
[1:49:48] the so the devil's also Al came out of
[1:49:53] many crying out and
[1:49:56] saying Thou Art the Son of
[1:49:59] God okay okay now now now this is what
[1:50:02] is so
[1:50:04] tremendous because these devils are
[1:50:06] saying
[1:50:08] this without
[1:50:11] Revelation and the the kingdom of God is
[1:50:13] built upon
[1:50:16] Revelation and so
[1:50:19] Jesus he he's the
[1:50:21] word he's the word and he says I can I
[1:50:25] can hear him telling these
[1:50:27] Devils that's not for you to say
[1:50:33] it I don't need you to declare who I
[1:50:38] am you might as well shut your
[1:50:42] mouth now I I didn't say that to
[1:50:45] scripture scripture says that and he
[1:50:49] rebuking
[1:50:50] them suffered them not to
[1:50:53] speak for they knew that he was
[1:50:58] Christ how did he know that he was
[1:51:01] Christ ah because they ran up into
[1:51:05] him and he smoked
[1:51:08] him say like it is took him that took
[1:51:12] him
[1:51:13] out watch this now why won't he let them
[1:51:18] talk when was one of the greatest truths
[1:51:21] that the world has ever
[1:51:25] known why does Jesus silence
[1:51:29] them because it was not for them to
[1:51:32] declare
[1:51:35] that it's the saints that shall crown
[1:51:40] him the Saints the bride is his
[1:51:45] glory she's the only one under a
[1:51:48] revelation
[1:51:51] can say thou art the
[1:51:54] Christ why because he is her
[1:51:59] Lord and the Bible says that no man can
[1:52:04] call Jesus
[1:52:06] Lord except by the
[1:52:11] Christ I'm going to say it again no man
[1:52:14] can call Jesus
[1:52:17] Lord except by the Holy Ghost which is
[1:52:22] Christ now this when I look at
[1:52:26] this and I see
[1:52:29] how how he
[1:52:31] came the L becomes
[1:52:34] flesh expression is it's the greatest
[1:52:38] expression and then would come another
[1:52:41] expression of the word when that word
[1:52:45] comes Jesus is the
[1:52:47] word and the word torment torments
[1:52:52] Devils now now I'm I'm coming to I'm
[1:52:55] finishing up
[1:52:56] okay but but just bear with me can I
[1:52:59] have like 10
[1:53:00] minutes get this this is the essence of
[1:53:02] the message
[1:53:03] now the word torments the
[1:53:10] Devils I get so sick and tired in our
[1:53:15] lives to see how these
[1:53:18] Devils torment
[1:53:20] us that's
[1:53:23] right you're not called to be tormented
[1:53:26] by
[1:53:28] Devils church we have been called to
[1:53:30] torment
[1:53:33] Devils why is this
[1:53:36] backwards why is this all wrong in our
[1:53:39] lives because he doesn't have
[1:53:42] preeminence we give him
[1:53:45] preeminence the word then torments the
[1:53:48] devil
[1:53:51] I want this to seek in now very much
[1:53:55] when was the last time that we tormented
[1:53:57] devils in our
[1:54:00] Liv oh come on now we're tormented all
[1:54:03] the
[1:54:04] time our minds are
[1:54:06] tormented and what of this and what of
[1:54:09] that sick and am I going to die it's
[1:54:13] just torment after torment after torment
[1:54:16] until somebody finally
[1:54:18] realizes if I give God
[1:54:22] preeminence then we turn the
[1:54:25] tables and now we can torment
[1:54:29] him now now notice this now Matthew
[1:54:34] 8:28 When he came to the other side of
[1:54:36] this country
[1:54:39] there there he met two possessed with
[1:54:41] the
[1:54:44] devil they were exceeding Fierce that no
[1:54:47] man would want wanted to even pass by
[1:54:49] right
[1:54:51] but as Jesus approaches he's the word
[1:54:56] now say it again he's the
[1:55:00] word and you are the bride
[1:55:05] word come on now either we believe that
[1:55:07] or we
[1:55:09] don't and behold they cried
[1:55:12] out Jesus never cried
[1:55:15] out oh man look at that guy with the
[1:55:17] demon with those devils
[1:55:22] no they're the ones crying
[1:55:24] out church if we could get to that
[1:55:28] place they said what have we to do with
[1:55:32] with
[1:55:34] thee Jesus thou Son of
[1:55:38] God Art Thou come hither to torment
[1:55:44] us to torture
[1:55:47] us to Vex us
[1:55:52] before the
[1:55:56] time I don't know about you but I'm
[1:55:58] tired
[1:56:00] of
[1:56:02] torments we become a
[1:56:06] puppet and those Devils behind us
[1:56:12] are I'm tired of this
[1:56:16] life next thing you
[1:56:18] know here we go again the same
[1:56:21] thing why we keep preaching about
[1:56:24] it because it gets
[1:56:28] worse this has preeminence over
[1:56:34] us oh come
[1:56:36] on and we hear it in church say I'm
[1:56:40] going to do
[1:56:41] better anybody here when we're in church
[1:56:45] under the
[1:56:46] anointing I'm straightening up right
[1:56:50] and we're good until we get to our
[1:56:52] house open the door
[1:56:56] and we're a
[1:56:58] puppet
[1:57:01] controlled and we're back and live the
[1:57:03] same way
[1:57:04] again in our heart we long to be free
[1:57:07] from
[1:57:09] this we long to for him to have
[1:57:13] preeminence we don't want to pay the
[1:57:16] price stop I'm going to stop for a
[1:57:18] minute here
[1:57:20] I asked the question to some of the
[1:57:23] people and I said why is it that when in
[1:57:28] the Old
[1:57:29] Testament when when the sacrifices were
[1:57:32] being
[1:57:33] made and all the burnt different kinds
[1:57:35] of burnt offerings were
[1:57:39] done honey was never one of the
[1:57:45] ingredients anybody know
[1:57:48] that they never never used honey in any
[1:57:50] of the
[1:57:53] ingredients why oh I got a lot of good
[1:57:56] answers I think this I think this okay
[1:58:00] after a while why is honey not used in
[1:58:03] the burnt
[1:58:07] offs because honey
[1:58:11] can't because
[1:58:13] honey they can't stand
[1:58:18] up
[1:58:22] oh you you don't even know why what I'm
[1:58:23] saying why
[1:58:25] I it can't handle the
[1:58:27] heat when you take honey and you put it
[1:58:30] under the
[1:58:31] fire it turns into a black mushy
[1:58:39] mess it's the same with
[1:58:42] us we give we try to put into our
[1:58:45] offering our burnt
[1:58:47] offering we try to add honey all the
[1:58:49] time oh Lord Jesus you know I love
[1:58:52] you oh Lord I'll follow you till I die
[1:58:57] all we're doing is adding honey to
[1:58:58] it but with the trial of our
[1:59:02] faith when the when the when the trials
[1:59:04] and tribulations
[1:59:06] come when the heat comes when the fire
[1:59:10] burns what happens we fall away I
[1:59:14] thought God loved me I thought what are
[1:59:17] you talking about quit putting honey on
[1:59:20] your on your
[1:59:23] sacrifice you know what they used
[1:59:26] instead frankincense frankincense
[1:59:29] because the hotter frankincense
[1:59:32] gets the more beautiful the smell
[1:59:36] they all right now let's get back to our
[1:59:39] message
[1:59:40] here I'm I'm I'm I'm wrapping up
[1:59:43] now notice this now five minutes
[1:59:47] okay all right wa in did I go past 10
[1:59:50] minutes already no no the clock stopped
[1:59:53] all right it stop all right good job
[1:59:55] good eye good eye all right notice
[2:00:01] this this is
[2:00:04] important because we get tired of being
[2:00:09] tormented but there's
[2:00:11] something in Colossians 1:23 and
[2:00:17] 27 that really
[2:00:22] my because everything that happens to
[2:00:25] us we simply always say oh yeah I'm
[2:00:28] being
[2:00:31] tormented well it's one thing to be
[2:00:33] tormented because of your own
[2:00:36] sake there's another thing that we're
[2:00:38] going to read
[2:00:40] about if you continue in the
[2:00:45] faith
[2:00:47] settled not moved away from the hope of
[2:00:50] the
[2:00:52] Gospel which ye have
[2:00:54] heard which was preached to every
[2:00:58] creature which is under
[2:01:01] heaven where of I Paul am made a
[2:01:06] Min who now rejoice in my sufferings for
[2:01:15] you and fill
[2:01:18] up oh my here we go and fill up that
[2:01:23] which is
[2:01:24] behind of the
[2:01:27] afflictions of
[2:01:29] Christ in my
[2:01:33] flesh he never considered his
[2:01:35] afflictions his own
[2:01:39] afflictions he never said look look what
[2:01:42] look I preached the gospel and look how
[2:01:43] Jesus look look how the Lord repays
[2:01:47] me it was in an honor for
[2:01:50] him to say my
[2:01:53] afflictions are the
[2:01:56] afflictions of Christ in my
[2:02:03] flesh that's why when we look at men
[2:02:06] that are back there brother
[2:02:07] Abraham brother fa we look at all the
[2:02:10] men around the different ones that that
[2:02:12] have gotten through the
[2:02:15] years you see they have been Afflicted
[2:02:17] in their bodies
[2:02:20] they they've been through so
[2:02:24] much Affliction after Affliction AFF
[2:02:27] have to go to to the specialist what's
[2:02:30] going
[2:02:32] on what is it it's the afflictions of
[2:02:37] Christ in their
[2:02:39] flesh why because we are the body of
[2:02:44] Christ the afflictions of
[2:02:47] Christ we see see them in our
[2:02:51] flesh or we are the flesh or Corporal
[2:02:56] body that he's using not that Corporal
[2:03:00] body this physical body these physical
[2:03:04] bodies are the Temple of the Holy
[2:03:07] Ghost and that's when we
[2:03:09] see that's when demons are
[2:03:13] tormented when we no longer see the
[2:03:16] afflictions as our afflictions
[2:03:21] but as Christ
[2:03:23] Affliction that torments the
[2:03:26] Devils how could they go
[2:03:28] on how could they keep serving the
[2:03:32] lord and they're Afflicted and Afflicted
[2:03:34] and
[2:03:35] Afflicted why because it is not their
[2:03:40] afflictions it is the afflictions of
[2:03:43] Christ in their
[2:03:45] body that's why he would say
[2:03:49] whereof I am made a
[2:03:52] minister according to the dispensation
[2:03:54] of
[2:03:56] God which is given to
[2:03:59] me for
[2:04:01] you to fulfill the word of
[2:04:05] God in other words to fulfill the word
[2:04:07] of
[2:04:08] God is to perfect the
[2:04:14] logos did you get
[2:04:16] that to perfect the logos
[2:04:20] why it's
[2:04:22] scattered but the Perfection of the
[2:04:24] logos is when it comes
[2:04:27] back that's why brother brandham says
[2:04:30] that's my
[2:04:32] purpose to unite the body of
[2:04:35] Christ to unite that logos
[2:04:41] back Christ in you the hope of
[2:04:45] glory I'm going to I'm going to go to a
[2:04:48] stop here I got so much so much to put
