[13:36] this Christ this son
[13:39] and has given us all things freely in
[13:43] Christ we are grateful to the Lord for
[13:48] the privileges that we are granted by
[13:51] this great supreme sacrifice that Jesus
[13:54] gave for us at Calvary that it
[13:59] reconciled us back into fellowship and
[14:03] to favor with thee that we might have
[14:06] this consolation of knowing that it's
[14:10] written if ye abide in me and my words
[14:13] in you you can s what you will and it
[14:17] shall be done unto you
[14:20] now we're grateful for this and pray
[14:23] that you'll give us faith to believe it
[14:25] with all that's in us now let us lay
[14:29] aside Lord every toil of the day every
[14:34] care of this life all the way from the
[14:38] janitor to the pastor that there would
[14:42] be nothing in our minds now but be
[14:44] waiting listening reverently for the
[14:47] Holy Spirit to speak to us that we might
[14:52] accomplish something good to know more
[14:56] of the bard gathering together for Lord
[14:59] truly that's why we come on this hot day
[15:04] speak to us to the Living Word and let
[15:09] the Living Word dwell in us and abide in
[15:14] us that we might be shaped and farmed
[15:19] not to the world but be transformed by
[15:24] the renewing of our spirit into the farm
[15:27] of the son of God Oh
[15:31] hearts tremble when we think in the joy
[15:36] floods our souls to know that we can be
[15:40] called sons and daughters of God we
[15:44] stand on the very brim of his second
[15:49] coming and all
[15:52] and kingdoms quivering under our feet
[15:57] all things of the world is vanishing but
[16:02] knowing that someday he shall come and
[16:04] shall take us to a kingdom where there
[16:07] shall never be an end or it'll never be
[16:10] moved and to think that we are now that
[16:15] the subjects of that kingdom Oh God
[16:21] circumcise our heart and ears today but
[16:23] by the Holy Spirit through the washing
[16:26] of the water of the word far we asked it
[16:29] in his name and for his glory amen
[16:33] [Music]
[16:40] I wish to approach the subject this
[16:43] morning far I was going to speak on
[16:49] something a little different if there
[16:51] was to be a healing service but we
[16:56] announced that the prayer cards to be
[16:57] get out at 8:00 so 8:30 or 9:00 o'clock
[17:01] and I just
[17:03] Billy come up the house a few minutes
[17:05] ago and he said there was hardly anyone
[17:07] here so he didn't get out prayer cards
[17:11] so we'll I thought of taking this text
[17:14] for a correction of the church now I
[17:20] want to speak on the subject of a
[17:23] deceived Church by the world I wish to
[17:28] read some now out of the book of Judges
[17:30] the sixteenth chapter beginning with the
[17:33] tenth verse I am Daliah said unto Samson
[17:41] behold thou has multi-and told me lies
[17:46] now tell me I pray thee Orion that might
[17:51] us be bound and he said unto her if I
[17:56] bind me fast with new ropes that never
[17:59] were occupied then shall I be weak and
[18:03] be as another man Delilah therefore took
[18:07] new ropes and bound him there within
[18:10] said unto him the Philistines be upon
[18:13] thee Sampson and there was liars and
[18:20] wait abiding in the chamber and he
[18:23] braked them from off his arms like s
[18:28] threads and Daliah said unto Samson
[18:33] hitherto thou has multi-and told me lies
[18:37] tell me were thou mightest be bound and
[18:41] he said unto her if thou weaver seven
[18:44] locks of my head with a web and she
[18:48] fastened it to the pins and said unto
[18:50] him the philistines beyond the
[18:53] and he awakened out of his sleep and
[18:56] went away with the pins of the beans and
[19:00] with the web and she said unto him how
[19:04] canst thou say I love thee when in thy
[19:08] heart is not with me
[19:10] thou has multi these three times and has
[19:14] told me or in thy great strength lies
[19:18] and has not told me where in thy great
[19:19] strength live and it came to pass when
[19:24] she had pressed him daily with her words
[19:29] and urged him soul that his soul was
[19:33] vexed unto death and he told her all his
[19:38] heart and said it here there has not
[19:41] come or razor up on my head for I have
[19:45] been a Nazarite unto God from my
[19:47] mother's womb if I be shaven then my
[19:53] strength will go from me and I shall
[19:56] become weak and be like another man
[19:59] I'm when deliah saw that he had told her
[20:05] all his heart
[20:06] she sent and called the Lords of the
[20:09] Philistines saying come up this once for
[20:14] he has shown me all his heart and the
[20:19] Lords of the Philistines came up into
[20:21] her and sought money in her brought
[20:24] money into her hand and she made him
[20:28] sleep up on her knees and she called for
[20:31] a man and he calls to him to shave off
[20:33] the seven locks of his head and begin to
[20:38] afflict him and his strength went from
[20:41] him and she said the Philistines be upon
[20:45] thee Samson and he awoke out of his
[20:48] sleep and said I will go out as at other
[20:50] times before and shake myself and he
[20:53] wished not that the Lord had departed
[20:56] from him now I wish to read for a text
[21:01] for this subject found over in the book
[21:04] of
[21:06] revelations the second chapter beginning
[21:09] with the 21st and the 23rd verses and I
[21:16] gave her space to repent of her
[21:20] fornication and she repented not behold
[21:24] I will cast her in to a bed and them
[21:29] that commit adultery with her and to
[21:31] great tribulations except they repent
[21:33] all their deeds and I will kill her
[21:38] children with death and all the churches
[21:40] shall know that I am he which searcheth
[21:44] the reins and hearts and I will give
[21:48] unto every one of you according to your
[21:51] works
[21:53] may the Lord that is blessings to the
[21:56] reading of his word
[22:02] Sampson great deal like the church
[22:07] started off right he started off in the
[22:12] right direction
[22:14] he started off and was called a mighty
[22:18] man of Valor but he started out serving
[22:25] the Lord in keeping his words and doing
[22:28] his commandments and that was somewhat
[22:33] like the church it started off on as we
[22:37] would say as a world expression started
[22:40] on the right foot started to keep the
[22:46] commandments of the Lord and as long as
[22:49] Sampson followed the Lord the Lord used
[22:53] Sampson for God can keep anyone and use
[23:01] anyone that will follow after him for
[23:07] it's God's business but when we turn to
[23:13] a side away from the things of God then
[23:16] God cannot use
[23:18] any longer one will walk steadfastly
[23:23] after the commandments of God one will
[23:27] stay in the pages of the Bible and
[23:30] worship by the written word worship Him
[23:35] in the spirit and in the truth of the
[23:37] word then God can use any individual but
[23:43] when they take a notion to turn aside I
[23:45] after something else then God cannot use
[23:48] that person any longer so Samson makes a
[23:54] and a very outstanding representation of
[24:01] the Church of today when the church
[24:04] started God could use the church for the
[24:08] church walk diligently after the
[24:11] commandments of the Lord kept all of his
[24:15] judgments and his statutes and done all
[24:19] of his commandments and God was with the
[24:22] church but it seems to be that there is
[24:29] such a weakness amongst the church we
[24:35] remember we are not on a picnic but
[24:39] we're in a battlefield many people just
[24:47] think that when they become a Christian
[24:49] that that's all they need to do that
[24:54] settles it forever if they are a
[24:59] Christian then everything's going to
[25:00] come easy don't never get that in your
[25:04] head where I become a Christian to fight
[25:11] fight the good fight of faith
[25:16] I become a Christian to get into battle
[25:20] lines we are Christian soldiers and
[25:28] we've got to be trained and brought up
[25:33] and all the techniques of the enemy to
[25:39] know how to fortify to know how to to
[25:42] fight the fight and we can only do that
[25:47] as a Holy Spirit will reveal it to us we
[25:53] cannot take what some other nation tells
[25:55] us when we go to war some of their ideas
[25:59] but we got to take our own ideas the way
[26:05] the Holy Spirit would direct us and what
[26:08] ideas he would give us because he is a
[26:11] commander in chief of the army of the
[26:14] Christians Samson did good he was a
[26:23] great man
[26:25] until he began to begin to tell me we
[26:30] would call it scallywag around until he
[26:35] began to get off of his own territory
[26:38] and the church didn't run well and was
[26:46] alright until they begin to get off on
[26:48] their territory
[26:55] Samson begin to flirt and he was not
[27:01] flirting with Israel that is girls he
[27:05] begin to flirt with a Philistine girls
[27:09] and that's somewhat similar to what the
[27:13] church did
[27:18] it'd never begin to make love with its
[27:23] own it got off after unbelievers and
[27:28] begin to flirt with unbelievers that's
[27:36] where we made our great end one of the
[27:40] greatest mistakes s when the church
[27:45] begin to do things that wasn't right and
[27:49] begin to keep like Samson bad company
[27:56] Samson as long as he was in the company
[27:59] of the Lord's people he did all right
[28:05] but when he got to flirting with bad
[28:08] company then he got in trouble and
[28:13] that's the way it is with the church
[28:16] when the church fallen reverently and
[28:20] daily after the leading of the Holy
[28:23] Spirit God bless them and miracles and
[28:29] signs and wonders followed the church
[28:33] but when he begin to keep bad company
[28:37] with the world one of the worst things
[28:43] are done in the first things that done
[28:44] it begin to organize breaking up
[28:49] fellowship amongst other believers
[28:53] because it found out that nations were
[28:56] organized but this great gospel is not
[29:02] dedicated to one nation are one people
[29:06] it's dedicated to whosoever will let him
[29:09] come
[29:10] all nations Kindred's tongues and people
[29:15] God never didn't in for us to draw
[29:19] boundary lines but man wanted to be like
[29:26] they come
[29:27] there are two a copy after go like the
[29:33] the world say the things that they do
[29:35] make a success the way they were success
[29:41] we cannot never be a success doing
[29:46] anything the world does we can only be a
[29:52] success as we follow after God's
[29:55] statutes and his way of doing things we
[30:00] can never be by patterning after the
[30:03] world if the cigarette company has met
[30:08] their greatest success by television and
[30:13] the beer and the whiskey crowd has made
[30:17] their great success to the contribution
[30:20] of television
[30:22] that's no sign that the church shall
[30:25] make it success television the success
[30:30] of the church lies within the preaching
[30:32] of the gospel of the power of God and
[30:35] the demonstration of the Spirit we
[30:41] cannot say because that television done
[30:43] such and such further cigarette company
[30:45] in there and the other companies we do
[30:49] not have any scripture to character to
[30:52] compare with them people and as long as
[30:55] we do we may draw great numbers of
[30:58] people but that's not what God ordained
[31:00] us to do we think because it we're all
[31:06] colors by ha great organizations causing
[31:12] great colorful things to take place that
[31:14] it's a success we are dying daily
[31:18] on our feet spiritually speaking if we
[31:24] stood 10 million strong this morning and
[31:27] the only spirit wasn't witness we'd do
[31:31] well to stand 10 strong with the holy
[31:34] spirit with us we cannot compare with
[31:39] the world
[31:40] one of the first things does the church
[31:43] begin to organize themselves the first
[31:47] organization was a Catholic Church and
[31:50] then come the Luther church when they
[31:54] organize through the Catholic Church to
[31:56] make it an organization one day there
[31:59] was a crowd
[32:01] the Philistines is on the Sampson and
[32:06] Simpson both the parts of the balance of
[32:11] the Catholic Church and Martin Luther
[32:14] came forth with the organization's then
[32:21] they bound the church with another card
[32:24] as deliah did and they begin instead of
[32:29] having God call man man who were called
[32:33] by the Holy Spirit maybe didn't know
[32:36] their ABCs but they know Christ then the
[32:43] church got stylish in fashion after the
[32:46] political speakers and they had to give
[32:50] their preachers doctor's degree
[32:53] everybody had to be a Doctor of Divinity
[32:56] that was another card to buying the
[32:59] church man go often studied each
[33:03] seminary tries to produce the better
[33:05] scholar so that their churches can brag
[33:08] our pastor is a Doctor of Divinity what
[33:14] did they do one time to have more
[33:17] knowledge than the other well that
[33:20] doesn't mean anything in the sight of
[33:22] God and there's no need for any men to
[33:27] try to take his worldly knowledge and
[33:28] ever please God with it it's an
[33:31] abomination in the sight of God you
[33:35] never please God with the worthy
[33:39] ambitions and knowledge because it's
[33:40] enmity to God says the scripture he
[33:45] cannot do it and each one tries to have
[33:49] all the knowledge they know just what to
[33:52] do in the word
[33:53] to say and it becomes just a political
[33:56] speech instead of a power Li
[33:59] demonstrated Holy Spirit message that
[34:01] sinks to the heart of man and discovers
[34:04] the sin they're trained for political
[34:10] talks we don't need that Paul said the
[34:17] word come to us not only of the gospel
[34:19] in word only but to the power and the
[34:23] manifestation of the Holy Ghost that
[34:26] brought the gospel demonstrating the
[34:29] powers of the Holy Ghost
[34:34] but all these men go off to seminaries
[34:38] and they learn great education how they
[34:41] must stand before the people how they
[34:44] must present themselves how they must
[34:47] dress and how they must act they should
[34:49] never use the wrong grammar now that's
[34:52] all right for a political speech but we
[34:59] are not changing words of man Paul said
[35:03] the gospel and I preached didn't kind of
[35:05] like that
[35:06] when it come to the renewing of the Holy
[35:09] Ghost and the power of demonstration
[35:15] come by right form speech that's your
[35:22] wisdom of be or your trust would be in
[35:25] the wisdom of man but it come to the
[35:29] demonstrations of the power of the risen
[35:31] Christ that's the gospel to know him in
[35:38] the power of his resurrection each one
[35:45] tries to think he's a little smarter
[35:46] than the other man each denomination the
[35:50] Methodist to say we got the smartest man
[35:52] the Baptist will say and the Church of
[35:54] Christ and so forth they all we're the
[35:57] smartest we are people we don't let just
[36:00] the ordinary man go out and preach the
[36:01] gospel but they
[36:04] pick'em god have mercy
[36:08] hey pickin if they're in dhaka native
[36:12] but there are certain doctrine then they
[36:14] put him in the church God take touching
[36:17] him no way I want somebody to preach to
[36:23] me that's been hand-picked by the Holy
[36:25] Ghost God has raised them not picked by
[36:31] man-whore denominations all knowledge
[36:38] they say all we know all about it
[36:39] and some of them doesn't know the first
[36:43] alphabet of the Holy Spirit they denied
[36:49] it reminds me of a little book I read
[36:52] one day in California about ten years
[36:55] ago I picked it up in an old bookstore I
[36:58] forget who was the author just a little
[37:01] tin set book but it had some good sense
[37:07] to it
[37:08] though it seemed jokingly and cunningly
[37:12] but I found something in there that
[37:15] sounded like God to me I'm one of those
[37:21] stories started out like this one
[37:25] morning in a great chicken pen that was
[37:29] a second little rooster that thought he
[37:35] had all the knowledge that there was to
[37:38] be known so he thought up on a box and
[37:42] beat his little bill against the box
[37:44] four or five times threw back his little
[37:48] head a coat like you never heard a
[37:50] rooster crow and the others he attracted
[37:54] their attention and he said ladies and
[37:58] gentlemen of this chicken pen I would
[38:02] like to speak to you all this morning on
[38:05] some great educational program we have
[38:08] just designed said I have required a lot
[38:14] of knowledge in my studying as he pull
[38:17] little glasses over his bill and he said
[38:21] I have decided that we chickens can
[38:24] better ourselves by more knowledge
[38:28] therefore I can tell you that were if we
[38:32] will dig and work and a certain pin a
[38:35] hole will find a certain vitamin that'll
[38:40] make us crow better prettier feathers I
[38:43] know I can tell you how we can in better
[38:46] ourselves and many different ways and
[38:49] the little bullets with their little red
[38:50] combs they just Calculon said isn't here
[38:53] darling and they certainly admired him
[38:59] oh he is such a brilliant rooster
[39:04] reminds me of some of these shares
[39:06] seminary preachers such a brilliant man
[39:12] there's no need of us hanging around the
[39:14] rested chickens we all ought to go with
[39:16] him well before the little feller got
[39:20] his speech finish that was another
[39:22] little chicken that didn't have such
[39:25] bright feathers come running in from the
[39:29] rest of the chicken yard and said boys
[39:31] just a minute I just heard the latest
[39:35] bulletin on the radio
[39:37] chickens went up for cents on the panel
[39:40] we're all born to the slaughter tomorrow
[39:43] what good your knowledge gonna do
[39:47] brother all the knowledge that we can a
[39:50] killer ate what good does it do we're
[39:52] six foot of dirt we're all dying by
[39:59] inches and by minutes our knowledge
[40:04] means nothing we want to know him but
[40:11] they do that as I was remarking some
[40:14] time ago about a certain little canary
[40:19] and he thought he ignored all the
[40:22] knowledge that it need to be known and
[40:24] he knowed so much that he could tell all
[40:26] the rest of Canaries about the human
[40:28] beings
[40:30] he flies up on his cage and he begins to
[40:32] speak about the human being how he know
[40:34] it all about them and all of a sudden a
[40:38] professor from Purdue walked up and
[40:40] begin to speak some high polish words to
[40:44] him and the little fella batted his eyes
[40:46] and turned his head now he had eyes he
[40:49] could see the professor
[40:51] he had ears he could hear him but of
[40:55] course he didn't know what he was
[40:57] talking about why he's got a canary
[41:00] brain he's just a bird brain that's all
[41:04] he's got yes got a human brain so he
[41:07] can't think like human beings
[41:09] neither can a human being take my cloud
[41:14] you're human all the whirling knowledge
[41:18] is no more than a canary brain all you
[41:23] do you just hurt yourself with it you've
[41:28] got to have the mind of Christ the
[41:33] reason people go and join organizations
[41:35] and substitute a handshake instead of
[41:39] the new birth their time to bypass the
[41:42] new birth they don't want the new birth
[41:46] and they know we teach it in the Bible
[41:51] so they won't to substitute something
[41:55] for it and the Pentecostal people are
[42:00] just as bad trying to serve the Tucson
[42:07] they want it in class it's must be just
[42:11] so classy we'll shake hands and join the
[42:14] church and be sprinkled or baptized or
[42:18] something they're afraid of the new
[42:22] birth I sometimes believe the brand of
[42:26] tabernacles getting afraid of it now we
[42:32] all know that a birth i don't care where
[42:36] it is or abouts it's a mess if a baby's
[42:41] born on a shock pile
[42:43] on a hard floor or in a Pete decorated
[42:46] hospital room it's a mess anyhow a birth
[42:51] of a calf birth of anything else is a
[42:53] mess
[42:54] and the new birth is nothing less than a
[42:58] mess
[42:59] but people are so starchy we'll go over
[43:03] where they shake hands we'll go over
[43:05] where they don't bawling-crying beat on
[43:07] the older crowd you want to be too human
[43:11] what we a seed an old potato a seed
[43:23] potato you take that potato and put it
[43:25] in the ground until you can have new
[43:28] potatoes that all potato has to rot a
[43:34] corn cannot produce new live until it's
[43:37] rotten and a man or woman can have new
[43:42] birth and tough there are intellectuals
[43:44] and their own self is rotten dead down
[43:49] at the altar and scream get all messed
[43:53] up the place the sparks gets out of your
[43:56] color and you're a born again by the
[43:58] Spirit of God I don't care if you
[44:01] swallow speaking tongue jump up and down
[44:02] stop like a chicken with his head off
[44:04] you're bringing forth new life but we
[44:10] substituted something part we want the
[44:14] classical way sure the other day Friday
[44:23] wife and I was going to the store I
[44:27] don't mean to harp on this but as we
[44:32] went down the street I just kept turning
[44:34] head one way for the other naked women I
[44:38] promised God when I was a blind man if
[44:41] he'd heal my eyes look at the thing was
[44:44] right I keep a little cross hanging in
[44:49] my car when I see such as that I'll look
[44:52] at the cross and say Oh God
[44:54] that's my refuge as I looked at the
[44:59] cross I've seen those women meet he said
[45:04] we haven't seen one woman today this got
[45:07] on a skirt and she said bill look at
[45:13] that woman there but those little steps
[45:17] around the top of her body said you mean
[45:21] to tell me that woman don't know that's
[45:23] wrong said if she doesn't know it's
[45:27] wrong then she's out of her right mind I
[45:31] said just a minute honey she is an
[45:33] American she does as the Americans do I
[45:39] said I was in Finland not long ago
[45:42] sweetheart and I questioned there to a
[45:46] man that set me down dr. monument and we
[45:51] were going to the the health baths let's
[45:57] call the Sunda and they take you in and
[46:00] pour hot water water on hot rocks and it
[46:04] just sweats you then they make you jump
[46:06] in ice water and then back out then you
[46:09] take you into a room and there's nurses
[46:10] and they're women who scrubbed the man
[46:12] and them naked sent it back into the
[46:15] pool I wouldn't go in I said doctor
[46:20] money and then that's wrong he said all
[46:23] right then Reverend Brennan that's wrong
[46:24] that how about your American doctors
[46:26] that will strip a woman naked and lay on
[46:28] the table examined every sex organ she's
[46:31] got
[46:38] how about your nurses and the hospitals
[46:41] I said excuse me brother onion onion
[46:44] you're right what is it it's customs
[46:51] when I was in Paris I could hardly
[46:54] believe it that the urinals for both men
[46:58] and women were the saint's one I
[47:02] couldn't understand it that the
[47:04] restrooms was on the side of the street
[47:07] for both male and female I couldn't
[47:12] believe that when women went to the
[47:14] beach to go swimming a boy and his
[47:16] sweetheart
[47:17] they had no dressing rooms they just
[47:19] took all their clothes to the last
[47:21] garment then turned their backs and put
[47:23] a little strap when swimming but it's so
[47:26] they paid no attention to it it's a
[47:30] custom of France in Africa women and man
[47:36] young and old no clothes at all walking
[47:41] through the prairies never know what a
[47:43] restroom was or things I never went out
[47:45] of each other's sight but they don't
[47:48] know the difference they don't know the
[47:52] difference but it's customs of Nations
[47:55] but I said honey we are different we're
[48:01] from another nation we are pilgrims and
[48:05] strangers sure that's what makes these
[48:07] things look so wrong part of the Bible
[48:11] said they they professed such claim they
[48:14] show that they are pilgrims and
[48:16] strangers they are seeking a city to
[48:18] come a man or woman in Italy in France
[48:24] in Africa in any other nation that's
[48:29] ever born again while the Holy Ghost
[48:32] don't do those things
[48:35] they won't wear those clothes they won't
[48:39] act like that
[48:40] because they're of another nation whose
[48:44] ruler and maker is God
[48:48] we're from heaven the spirit that's
[48:52] within you motivates your life if you
[48:55] are American you'll do as Americans do
[48:58] if you are French you do as the French
[49:01] do and criticize the other but if you
[49:06] are about you'll do the way to do it
[49:08] heaven because your spirit comes from
[49:12] above and it controlled you a little
[49:17] something you might look at in the
[49:20] scripture those who sought this new city
[49:24] acted different they profess that they
[49:27] were pilgrims and strangers but on the
[49:31] side of cane they become fugitives and
[49:34] renegades but Christians were pilgrims
[49:39] and strangers a fugitive has no home
[49:45] well renegade is a horrible person but a
[49:50] pilgrim is something real and from a
[49:55] real hand in another nation trying to
[49:58] find his way home
[50:00] but fasting by his living then he has
[50:03] something that he's from another country
[50:06] there is the reason but yet those people
[50:10] who do so those people who wear those
[50:14] things let me tell you in South Africa
[50:17] when I saw thirty thousand raw heathens
[50:22] naked blanket natives 16 18 20 year old
[50:28] girls boys was not one stitch of clothes
[50:33] standing there with mud at their faces
[50:35] and paint it up bones to their the hose
[50:39] and blocks of wood hanging from their
[50:41] ears and cross human bones or some bones
[50:44] in their hair animals teeth hanging over
[50:49] them naked as they come into the world
[50:53] and didn't know it but when they
[50:58] received Christ and fell on their face
[51:01] receive the Holy Ghost they got up and
[51:03] founded their arms to hold shame to
[51:07] their bosom as he walked away and found
[51:09] clothes to put home why they become
[51:13] pilgrims and strangers to the sea they
[51:22] were away from them yes sir
[51:24] oh yes these people call themselves
[51:28] Christians they belong to churches they
[51:31] go and say we are Methodists we're
[51:33] Baptists we're Pentecostal we're seven
[51:36] day Adventists we're this that the other
[51:37] that doesn't have one thing to do with
[51:40] it
[51:40] your spirit the light that seen you
[51:43] motivates and tells what you are jesus
[51:46] said by their fruit you shall know them
[51:52] the church has become like Israel first
[51:55] they seen all the heathen nations having
[51:58] a king God was their key and they seen
[52:02] the heathen nations having King so they
[52:05] wanted to act like the either nations
[52:07] and they bought themself a king
[52:09] and as they did it they got in trouble
[52:17] gradually begin to come in razzed in the
[52:21] world begin to slip into them finally
[52:23] ended up in a Arab one King come in this
[52:27] little poster - a little closer to it
[52:29] and finally squeeze the life out of
[52:31] there they even when their real King
[52:33] come they didn't know him that's the
[52:36] same thing the church has done its
[52:38] adopted policy education it's adopted
[52:47] organizations Society big churches
[52:51] including preachers I when the real King
[52:55] comes they don't know him and they're
[52:57] crucifying the very
[52:59] we go Spencer King no but they laugh at
[53:06] even make fun of me as they Jews did
[53:08] their Messiah the church is doing their
[53:11] Messiah the same way not they haven't
[53:18] got the spiritual insight because
[53:20] they're so documented with their eyes
[53:22] and what they see great buildings trying
[53:25] to compare with the world we're never
[53:29] exalted exhorted to to compare with the
[53:31] world weird hearted to humble ourselves
[53:35] and what is a machardie in God and today
[53:39] in the healing advances out on the
[53:41] fields there's such a competitive
[53:43] competitors once as a blessed God I have
[53:46] so many thousand I got a bigger median
[53:48] you have what difference does that make
[53:51] we have 100 1 million what difference
[53:55] does it make are we true to God are we
[53:57] true to his word do we stand under test
[54:01] of the Holy Spirit is it true that's the
[54:07] meaning but we compromise upon the Bible
[54:11] lot of our Pentecostal people upon the
[54:13] fundamental doctrines of this Bible
[54:15] compromised first I don't want to hurt
[54:21] feelings on an all-in Church not feeling
[54:25] I could do just what in the church
[54:27] because I'm preaching the gospel but
[54:29] there's tens of thousands of Pentecostal
[54:31] preachers know that there's no such a
[54:34] thing in the Bible as a baptism in the
[54:36] name of Father Son Holy Ghost I
[54:39] challenge the archbishop for anybody to
[54:42] show me where anybody was ever baptized
[54:43] in the name of Father Son Holy Ghost but
[54:47] they compromised the cause these
[54:49] organizations has did so there's not one
[54:52] person in the New Testament and for 300
[54:55] years
[54:56] Edwards but history of what was baptized
[54:57] in the name of Jesus Christ
[55:00] what is an organization yes did it
[55:05] compromising and today they took all the
[55:08] street workers off the streets
[55:10] they've tucked the tambourine out of the
[55:13] church they've taken all the glory out
[55:16] of the church and God scenaries precinct
[55:20] little all rooster : preaching all
[55:24] polished in society and their women
[55:27] wearing shorts and dresses that they're
[55:29] skinned into and man smoking cigarettes
[55:32] and gambling and telling dirty jokes
[55:37] disgrace in the sight of God I know
[55:42] that's rough
[55:43] but it's time somebody said something
[55:47] [Music]
[55:51] compromising giving you an acting like
[55:54] the world I don't care if I have to
[55:56] stand alone with nobody but God alone
[55:59] I'll preach the truth of God's badness
[56:01] bad boy if I die I'm still staying for
[56:05] the truth truth nature up not according
[56:12] to the church but according to the Word
[56:14] of God I want to measure but Daliah did
[56:19] you notice she know that Samson had a
[56:22] power and she didn't know where that
[56:26] power laid she couldn't tell what that
[56:29] power was but there was some great power
[56:33] that Samson possessed and she wanted to
[56:36] find it and his Daliah she kept wooing
[56:40] samson after her beauty oh she dressed
[56:44] yourself real sexy and she walked before
[56:46] him in CT he'd like some of the little
[56:48] teenagers of the day and so forth they
[56:50] would just act like something other
[56:52] striptease trying to woo Samson to her
[56:57] that's the same thing the world's done
[57:00] to the church
[57:03] now worries your great power
[57:06] well if will organize that'll break the
[57:08] power the Catholic Church done it but
[57:11] the Philistines is only Samson and a
[57:13] Luther canal and they organized again if
[57:17] you buy me with another card it'll hold
[57:20] me so they did and the Flis teens on
[57:22] these Sampson what happened
[57:25] Wesley came out broke the card now
[57:29] you've just seen me all at home don't
[57:31] you know I love you Samson alright tell
[57:34] me the truth in your heart
[57:35] all right you buy me with another card
[57:38] all right how will do that what is that
[57:40] that's the denominational card you let
[57:42] me be free that I got no denomination
[57:44] then I'll tell you how many broke so how
[57:47] come the Pentecostals where's your power
[57:52] bliss thieves be upon thee and he broke
[57:54] the cards again but now what happened
[57:58] it's got the Pentecostals the big
[58:01] doctors of divinity for their pastors
[58:04] some great men they've got just as much
[58:07] school and ritual as the Methodists or
[58:09] Baptists rather essence God go into a
[58:13] church and you can't hear a man just as
[58:16] cold as a bunch of Eskimos out of the
[58:20] North Pole cold indifferent I now bless
[58:27] these is only Samson the Philistines is
[58:31] on the America where is that oneness of
[58:33] spirit where is the oneness of Pentecost
[58:38] the similes of God and then United in
[58:41] the Church of God in this that the other
[58:43] each one but the different is and this
[58:45] one with that and this one with that
[58:46] we're so broke up too you can go into a
[58:48] city the whole revival of one church
[58:50] sponsored the rest I won't leave attend
[58:52] [Music]
[58:54] the communist is up on the America where
[58:57] is our power where's our glory why is it
[59:01] because we want to have the wisdom of
[59:03] man instead of the power of God why do
[59:07] we got our preachers and things are so
[59:09] stiff and starchy till they've organized
[59:11] us to wears
[59:12] starch is stiff neck no people do you
[59:14] ever hear a shot in the church anymore
[59:15] you never hear anybody cry the mourners
[59:19] is put in the basement there's no
[59:22] more glory in the church all we do is
[59:26] set back this as stiff as we can be
[59:29] we're not three we're bound but devil
[59:34] with his modernistic demons has bound
[59:37] the Church of the Living God
[59:39] [Music]
[59:41] that's right
[59:42] there's no more power in the church
[59:44] there's no more freedom the people so
[59:47] starchy and stiff while the God can come
[59:51] into the midst of Pentecostal people and
[59:53] show that he's God and through these
[59:56] signs of his resurrection it don't even
[59:58] shake what this race a walk across the
[1:00:05] country God working performing signs and
[1:00:08] people sitting well I guess that's all
[1:00:12] right
[1:00:13] oh I know it can be done it doesn't move
[1:00:17] and why they're bound with the world not
[1:00:24] being guided to about them into a
[1:00:26] confederation the Philistines are only
[1:00:31] Samson what you gonna do about it
[1:00:35] oh we've got great denominations sure we
[1:00:38] have greater membership than we ever had
[1:00:40] but where's the spirit where's the Holy
[1:00:43] Ghost that's what the devil is done it's
[1:00:47] moved into the church it's kept fooling
[1:00:50] the church come to me I'll give you a
[1:00:52] great big tabernac over here if you'll
[1:00:53] just do this if you'll get rid of that
[1:00:55] fanatic preacher you got and get a man
[1:00:57] or a doctor to villages got some sense
[1:00:59] will be able to isolate classical Church
[1:01:01] it would be like the rest of them shame
[1:01:03] on you rather have a man that didn't
[1:01:07] know spit coffee from beans but was
[1:01:11] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:01:14] that was unconference but the power of
[1:01:17] God but Scott oh so starchy the Sun poor
[1:01:22] Saint can break through in the meeting
[1:01:24] if speaking tongues or shout a little
[1:01:25] bit or do something and the rest of them
[1:01:27] all gather around and look what was that
[1:01:31] well wonder why that must be a fanatic
[1:01:33] dropped in somewhere you know that's the
[1:01:39] truth some poor Saint step in get a
[1:01:44] happy enough to raise their hands to
[1:01:46] cried praise the Lord
[1:01:48] somebody who already manager the
[1:01:51] preaching the gospel and the rest of
[1:01:53] them turn around to see what he said
[1:01:54] that's Pentecostals what's the matter
[1:01:58] you're a pattern a for the Methodists
[1:01:59] and the Baptists they pattern at the
[1:02:02] Catholic Catholic pattern here for hell
[1:02:04] then all together all after hell right
[1:02:11] the lion has wuji in the big churches
[1:02:15] find educated ministers take the better
[1:02:18] class well you know so and so now here's
[1:02:19] a millionaire if we could just get him
[1:02:21] to come into our congregation in Hong
[1:02:22] anh if he isn't born again then he
[1:02:25] doesn't deserve to be there
[1:02:27] I don't care if he's got a million
[1:02:30] dollars if he owns 40 Cadillacs whatever
[1:02:34] he's done he's got to be harmed again
[1:02:36] come right down to a new birth and be
[1:02:39] regenerated by the Holy Ghost and come
[1:02:41] out learn a new verse not squeeze me
[1:02:43] crying screaming and like the rest of
[1:02:47] them
[1:02:48] laughter worship Ruby's got it hey
[1:02:53] [Music]
[1:02:55] that's what's in here
[1:02:59] Samson the Philistines is upon thee the
[1:03:03] Communist is up only the world's upon
[1:03:06] thee the devil's upon lean they go back
[1:03:09] and they see the Spirit of God perform
[1:03:11] miracles and do things of his
[1:03:13] resurrection while jesus promised they
[1:03:15] say you know I think brother Bram's got
[1:03:17] a lot of mental telepathy my pastor said
[1:03:20] it was of the devil you poured
[1:03:21] hypocritical diluted infidel
[1:03:25] I don't polish stuff you wolf in sheep's
[1:03:30] clothing
[1:03:31] jesus said if you don't know me you
[1:03:34] don't know my name but you've got a
[1:03:37] bunch of souls to try to make you like
[1:03:39] the rest of the world we want a bunch of
[1:03:41] man of God who don't compromise on the
[1:03:43] work but preach the truth and stand on
[1:03:45] the baptism of the Holy Spirit but what
[1:03:49] is the world on is shaved all your power
[1:03:51] off you were born Nazarite Pentecost but
[1:03:56] the world certainly shades your power
[1:03:58] not just the starches the rest of them
[1:04:02] what are we going to do what's going to
[1:04:05] happen there's one glorious thing and I
[1:04:07] can think of the in this text while
[1:04:10] Samson was bound we can't have a revival
[1:04:14] listen our loyal brother Billy Grimm
[1:04:18] revived in our day listen Oral Roberts
[1:04:21] cream revival in our day
[1:04:24] listen to rest them reviving are they
[1:04:27] how can we have a revival when we're
[1:04:30] bound we bound the Holy Spirit with our
[1:04:34] organizations and traditions and we
[1:04:37] can't have a Holy Ghost revival I know
[1:04:42] that scorching hot with the weather but
[1:04:47] it's the truth how can we have a real
[1:04:49] Holy Ghost revival when you're so bad
[1:04:52] starchy farm of God and his survival
[1:04:55] said it had fire love godliness but
[1:04:58] would deny the power thereof the power
[1:05:00] of whopped the power of the organization
[1:05:04] the power of the world the power of the
[1:05:06] church the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:09] that's the secret place in the church
[1:05:11] and when the church adopts educated
[1:05:15] preachers and big buildings and finery
[1:05:17] in the stead of the old-fashioned Holy
[1:05:19] Ghost it'd better be a mission again how
[1:05:28] you gonna have revival for the Holy
[1:05:30] Ghost people questioned and bounded it
[1:05:32] afraid of it there's where the trouble
[1:05:38] on the Fliss teens is only but the one
[1:05:42] blessed hope we have while samson was in
[1:05:46] jail what's the first thing they've done
[1:05:48] when they caught him they bound him
[1:05:50] first they took his power away they
[1:05:52] found his secret they found your secret
[1:05:55] the world found your secret now you and
[1:05:58] me all Bob your hair's goes like the
[1:06:00] world you man all go to act like the
[1:06:03] world's all right tell jokes and dirty
[1:06:05] jokes and go out and smoke a few
[1:06:07] cigarettes and run out with the
[1:06:09] neighbors wives and everything else like
[1:06:10] that
[1:06:11] hello sociable great to hold your job
[1:06:13] I'd rather lay on my bedding eat soda
[1:06:17] crackers and drink branch water and stay
[1:06:19] clean and pure before God than to
[1:06:21] compromise or any kind of a job true
[1:06:28] stay true to God Samson the Philistines
[1:06:32] is on the Brandon Tabernacle Worley ISM
[1:06:36] is creeping in among you what about it
[1:06:39] have you exposed your secret have you
[1:06:43] exposed that secret to God give you when
[1:06:45] you were watering there in the sawdust a
[1:06:47] few years ago have you let it creep out
[1:06:50] the social faunal worship what's
[1:06:55] happened to you God can come down and
[1:06:57] perform a miracle go right down to the
[1:06:59] audience and tell people a secrets of
[1:07:01] their hearts and everything and he was
[1:07:02] sick and afflicted it
[1:07:04] Motors and preaches were as hard as it
[1:07:06] can buy the Holy Ghost and if people say
[1:07:07] well I guess that's alright
[1:07:09] we enjoy listening to it once in a while
[1:07:11] if we're not too tired that's Brandon
[1:07:14] tabernacle the Philistines is only one
[1:07:20] used to be when the preaching of the
[1:07:21] word and the old Saints with the tears
[1:07:24] and Rahab would rise to their feet and
[1:07:26] walk solvent
[1:07:27] maybe not saying a word is walking
[1:07:29] around three times and sat down so
[1:07:32] filled with the Holy Ghost a word family
[1:07:37] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[1:07:39] out of the mouth of them bliss teens is
[1:07:44] only Branham Tabernacle flesh teens is
[1:07:47] all-new Pentecostal of course the
[1:07:49] Felicity's got you rest of you a long
[1:07:51] time ago when you organize yourself so
[1:07:53] tight nothing can come unless you the
[1:07:55] Presbyterian Baptist Methodist Catholic
[1:07:57] or something you wouldn't have nothing
[1:07:59] to do with arrest them so revive in our
[1:08:01] today how can we have it when the
[1:08:03] regular Reviver giver is bound by the
[1:08:05] world God will come in where the world
[1:08:08] is you can just depend on their you've
[1:08:11] so shaped with the world and it's it's
[1:08:13] all of it when you let the world
[1:08:15] creeping you go to act in act the world
[1:08:17] then you are finished but when you cut
[1:08:20] loose ever offenders we worldly come to
[1:08:22] God God will use you until you go to
[1:08:24] flirt and again here's the only hope
[1:08:28] that I have this morning to wind up my
[1:08:30] message is this while Sampson was bound
[1:08:33] a new Chaka haired wrote out God send us
[1:08:41] another church just before the income
[1:08:45] that the power of the Holy Ghost can
[1:08:49] prevent or in the demonstrations of the
[1:08:52] spirit and mark sixteen can follow the
[1:08:55] church acts two and four acts 2:38
[1:08:59] although it will be following right
[1:09:01] along with the church signs and wonders
[1:09:04] accompany the Apostles great signs of
[1:09:07] his resurrection accompanied
[1:09:09] while we're in prison surely God's
[1:09:12] growing a crop somewhere for the last
[1:09:14] great kill may it be you my Christian
[1:09:17] friend here thus more
[1:09:18] maybe you're straight let's begin the
[1:09:21] girl I pray that this message this
[1:09:23] morning and out into the land of where
[1:09:25] this will go
[1:09:25] I trust that this message will help
[1:09:28] bring the vitamin to your system that'll
[1:09:32] grow a spiritual power back into your
[1:09:34] life again let us bow our heads Oh Lord
[1:09:41] God creator of her the heavens in the
[1:09:45] earth the author of everlasting life and
[1:09:49] the giver of every good and spiritual
[1:09:51] gift take these words us morning and
[1:09:55] place em into the heart of the water and
[1:09:57] Lord may that people pray over these
[1:10:01] things seeing that the world has booed
[1:10:05] the church and has finally found its
[1:10:08] power found its secret place found word
[1:10:12] its secret lies and has shaved it off
[1:10:16] has taken the peoples that once shouted
[1:10:20] the victory once had the victory and it
[1:10:23] shaved them off to stay home always
[1:10:26] denied to watch a television program
[1:10:29] taking the joy out of their hearts and
[1:10:32] giving more love for the world than they
[1:10:34] have for God has given more world for
[1:10:37] worthy and more desire for worthy
[1:10:40] entertainment than they have the
[1:10:42] preaching of the gospel if there's not a
[1:10:44] great band and a lot of carrying on and
[1:10:47] whooping and carrying on then they don't
[1:10:49] want the old gospel anymore that brings
[1:10:51] tears of joy to the soul that brings
[1:10:54] divine healing bank that restores the
[1:10:58] apostolic gifts to the church that
[1:11:00] brings in the risen Christ the Messiah
[1:11:03] of disdain but as Israel was bound by by
[1:11:07] their kings that they could not follow
[1:11:09] the real king and the real king when he
[1:11:12] came they didn't recognize him so is it
[1:11:14] today Oh Lord the King of glory has
[1:11:18] appeared in the form of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:19] and Lord they don't know it they don't
[1:11:23] recognize it they're so organized so
[1:11:25] tight that they do not understand it
[1:11:27] because it's not in their organization
[1:11:29] Lord this is a work of the devil it's
[1:11:32] done this to the people may the Samson
[1:11:35] of God may the true in heart those who
[1:11:38] are longing and crying and pleading
[1:11:41] wholly-owned may they stay with the Lord
[1:11:45] until this new crop grows out until
[1:11:50] there comes forth a gator joins on on
[1:11:53] there comes forth a group that can
[1:11:55] recognize and understand that can see
[1:11:58] them a sign and the hidden powers it's
[1:12:00] hid from the world that they will not
[1:12:02] understand now grant Lord that they'll
[1:12:04] see this or we asked it in Jesus name
[1:12:07] Amen
[1:12:08] oh just now Oh Lord
[1:12:17] sand the power just now and bad time
[1:12:23] every they were in the upper chamber
[1:12:31] they were all with one Accord when the
[1:12:38] Holy Ghost descended that was promised
[1:12:44] by
[1:12:46] our Lord O Lord send your power just Oh
[1:12:55] Lord send your power just now oh how I
[1:13:13] love him
[1:13:15] just send his power they were in the
[1:13:18] upper chamber all with one Accord all
[1:13:23] the world had dreamed out him
[1:13:25] they were ended up and the Holy Ghost
[1:13:29] came today they say come join the church
[1:13:33] put your name on the book or bow down
[1:13:36] and say I confess Christ as the Son of
[1:13:38] God get up the devil does the same thing
[1:13:43] certainly the devil was baptized when
[1:13:49] Judas is baptized
[1:13:52] the devil won't preach the gospel when
[1:13:55] Judas won't preach the gospel
[1:13:56] but the devil didn't get the Holy Ghost
[1:13:59] that's it there's where the hidden
[1:14:02] powers that resurrection that no+ beyond
[1:14:07] a shadow that hey he's here that same
[1:14:15] Holy Ghost that Wang was only Messiah
[1:14:19] still on his church he never leaves I'll
[1:14:24] be with you always even in you to the
[1:14:29] end of the world I'll be there the works
[1:14:33] that I do shall you also more than this
[1:14:37] should you do for our going to my father
[1:14:41] but the world compromises it all those
[1:14:44] are days past just what the devil wants
[1:14:46] you to do they want you to glamorize God
[1:14:49] wants you baptized God want you you say
[1:14:53] oh I don't believe all that they're
[1:14:55] carrying on go ahead go ahead live in
[1:14:56] your sin live in your sins but until you
[1:15:00] rot do you rock to your own ideas do you
[1:15:04] rock to your own fashions and be
[1:15:07] regenerated again and barn again and
[1:15:10] that new life will be altogether
[1:15:12] different from the one that went down a
[1:15:15] greener car goes down yalla it comes up
[1:15:19] green goes down hard taste in it comes
[1:15:23] up flexible and blowing with the wind Oh
[1:15:25] Doris hallelujah
[1:15:28] [Music]
[1:15:29] when the winds begin to blow the grain
[1:15:32] takers of a move itself shift but the
[1:15:35] little little blade flexor rejoices
[1:15:37] grows it strengthens itself it can never
[1:15:42] become a blade until the card is dead
[1:15:44] and rotten not only dead but Robin can't
[1:15:50] come back no more
[1:15:52] but life comes out of it as I said a
[1:15:55] while ago of birth is a horrible thing
[1:15:57] filthy dirty the filth is not film but
[1:16:03] that's where life lays when you reckon
[1:16:07] yourself filthy reckon your Methodists
[1:16:10] Baptists and Pentecostal Creed's filthy
[1:16:14] out at the altar then new life comes
[1:16:18] easy the Holy Spirit makes you in above

[1:16:26] glorious day some day yelling the reach
