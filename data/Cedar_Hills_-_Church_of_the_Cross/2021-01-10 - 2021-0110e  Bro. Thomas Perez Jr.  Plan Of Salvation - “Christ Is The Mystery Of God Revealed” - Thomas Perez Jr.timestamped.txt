[34:40] okay i got to say that again how many
[34:42] believe that he is
[34:44] tonight you know this this week
[34:49] and we're not going to focus on the bad
[34:51] innova
[34:52] we're going to focus on on what we're
[34:54] supposed to be doing
[34:59] but i want you to notice that right now
[35:00] our country is in
[35:02] such a divided mess
[35:08] i believe it was last sunday
[35:11] a chaplain to open the 117th
[35:16] congress
[35:21] he prayed this prayer and i don't want
[35:24] to get him wrong
[35:27] but but he prayed this prayer and i'm
[35:30] going to
[35:30] get it so that you you will know what he
[35:32] prayed
[35:36] and he prayed this prayer
[35:40] he finished up out his pr his prayer
[35:42] terminator
[35:54] known by many names and faiths
[36:11] you wonder why why three days later
[36:16] that that that that extremists
[36:21] entered into the us capital
[36:24] you
[36:40] and when you wind up and don't know if
[36:43] you're praying to god or to a hindu
[36:46] deity
[36:51] what do you know that can ever keep you
[36:53] safe away from the wiles of the devil
[37:00] this methodist minister yesterday
[37:04] should have known better because you we
[37:07] only serve
[37:08] one lord jesus christ
[37:12] in 1774
[37:17] the chaplain of the congress concluded
[37:22] with all these things we ask through the
[37:25] merits of thy son
[37:26] jesus christ our savior
[37:31] in 2021
[37:34] we said
[37:48] but as far as america has fallen in
[37:52] america this is how much the bride of
[37:54] jesus christ has risen
[37:59] because our foundation is not built upon
[38:02] the constitution
[38:15] but his word would never it would remain
[38:19] eternal
[38:22] it dwells in my heart wells in my ground
[38:26] wealth in my ear it is me
[38:30] it's for you the word
[38:58] and it talks about every person in here
[39:02] claims to be a head of the household
[39:08] every man in here that claims to be
[39:12] right with god every man
[39:15] in here that has come to the stature of
[39:19] a perfect yeah
[39:21] because god didn't come to make
[39:23] christians
[39:25] the message of jesus christ
[39:28] was not to make christians not christian
[39:31] was to make
[39:32] stature of a perfect man
[39:36] to bring us into the unity of the spirit
[39:40] he wanted to bring us
[39:52] there was a man 2 000 years ago
[40:08] by
[40:36] and we say what a great plan god has he
[40:39] was kicked on grandpa
[40:41] remains a plan until there is a
[40:45] manifestation
[40:48] of that plan there is a plan so in the
[40:50] seventh
[40:53] [Applause]
[41:04] what he has
[41:32] but then in christ is the mystery of god
[41:35] revealed
[41:38] he picks it back up again because he
[41:40] wants you to understand
[41:43] that's the first expression
[41:47] was for god to be revealed completely in
[41:50] christ
[41:53] but it does not stop there
[41:56] the first manifestation of
[41:59] the plan of salvation after six seals
[42:04] but the next process is for him to have
[42:08] preeminence
[42:13] that would be the manifestation
[42:16] of the sons of god this time
[42:20] now here we are division
[42:25] i got this from my brother william
[42:27] consigned
[42:39] we were having a hard time about that
[42:41] time
[42:42] established
[42:56] and understand
[43:11] and to his daughter jesus
[43:15] he only had a vision
[43:19] to heal his daughter
[43:24] now how many of you cuantos ustedes or
[43:27] how many of us
[43:29] we say unless god shows me directly
[43:33] i won't do nothing about it you know
[43:35] it's another day
[43:36] many of us do know
[43:43] [Music]
[43:51] now this woman would have never gotten
[43:53] healed yes
[43:57] if she would have believed it just like
[43:59] that
[44:01] but she started going into understanding
[44:19] i believe that he is absolutely the son
[44:22] of the most high
[44:25] i believe that in him dwells the spirit
[44:28] of god it dwells in that man
[44:35] you know we were talking about this
[44:39] how beautiful it is to see everybody at
[44:42] the parking lot before the church even
[44:48] that's awesome
[44:57] it's two minutes till 10.
[45:01] it's so tiring oh man and just wait till
[45:05] after service me and my wife are going
[45:08] to finish that argument
[45:13] the song leader is saying raise up your
[45:14] hands
[45:41] people are even fighting to be the first
[45:44] one to church
[45:57] so this woman is
[46:11] do something for other people
[46:15] and then she says i believe
[46:19] that if i could get close enough
[46:23] i believe that if i could get close
[46:26] enough
[46:40] really really
[46:47] have you noticed how beautiful the
[46:48] church services are
[46:52] because you're here an hour and 15
[46:54] before the church ever starts
[46:57] and you're starting to think about the
[46:59] things of god
[47:01] no i love the lord he's healed me
[47:06] he's giving me peace he's giving
[47:24] you'd be surprised how many people get
[47:26] upset because they can't sit up here
[47:30] at 8 25 right
[47:34] front row center scene
[47:37] all of a sudden church seats are at a
[47:39] premium
[47:42] you know why god is doing something
[47:46] that the enemy is doing his things and
[47:48] enemies
[47:50] god is also
[48:04] getting upset for that reason
[48:08] but this is the woman i believe if i can
[48:11] only get close to you
[48:15] now i ain't got no money no tengo dinero
[48:17] and i'm a poor person
[48:20] i don't know his attitude no that's what
[48:22] you do he might require
[48:23] certain things to spend all my money on
[48:27] the doctors
[48:30] but if i could only wind my way
[48:45] amen that's the way brother brown says
[48:49] to believe it
[48:52] jesus did not have didn't have no vision
[48:56] about her
[48:56] jesus i gotta say it again
[49:19] because jesus said this okay i don't do
[49:22] nothing unless i see my father do it
[50:10] and here she
[51:06] was projected
[51:16] now we understand i believe what the
[51:20] rapture is located
[51:23] the rapture is as we heard
[51:27] to take by force
[51:33] you got a great job
[52:02] and the image was smitten
[52:06] so that the supernatural could taste the
[52:08] feeling of death
[52:13] where do we understand the scripture at
[52:15] don't ask
[52:16] me
[52:28] the world thinks we're just a bunch of
[52:30] holy rollers
[52:43] but when god sees us
[52:58] la vistion israel was supposed to be
[53:01] saved
[53:02] israel only
[53:05] israel israel in the vision
[53:09] they were god's people
[53:12] they were
[53:38] we were people that were just didn't
[53:40] have
[53:55] we were robbers and
[53:58] paul captures the revelation
[54:02] and some were such of you
[54:05] some of you were these people
[54:08] are gonna do
[54:22] you are people
[54:34] a man amen a man a man a man a man and a
[54:39] man
[54:40] and a man new number and a man
[54:44] not a man not a man a man a man
[54:50] a man do you know what this man's name
[54:53] is
[54:55] his name is jesus christ the name
[54:58] there is only one mediator
[55:01] between god and man and that is the
[55:32] i'm
[55:33] [Music]
[55:45] became a hiding place
[56:00] but you shall see
[56:56] we saw the restoration restoration we
[56:59] saw the plan of salvation
[57:01] we saw that man coming back
[57:07] we said he's our hiding place
[57:23] what was happening
[57:50] and the first thing i saw were feet
[58:21] i have been sent forth from the presence
[58:23] of god
[58:24] i presented it i gotta tell i gotta tell

[59:33] preaching revelation
[59:35] chapter 4
[59:40] the angel of the lord
[59:43] of hearts drawing in the back of the
[59:45] church
[59:48] seven church ages now those that were in
[59:52] attendance look at said that the angel
[59:56] of the lord
[1:00:05] they said it was brother branham that
[1:00:07] went with his finger
[1:00:11] and put light there he pulls a looser
[1:00:13] you know why
[1:00:15] it is a plan for you to be saved
[1:00:19] but it is a vision of a manifestation
[1:00:23] of you coming into being
[1:00:39] we're not doing this tonight
[1:01:21] he got sick
[1:01:36] said opinion till the light
[1:01:40] once again
[1:01:43] became a hiding place
[1:01:52] when we understand what god has done for
[1:01:55] us here
