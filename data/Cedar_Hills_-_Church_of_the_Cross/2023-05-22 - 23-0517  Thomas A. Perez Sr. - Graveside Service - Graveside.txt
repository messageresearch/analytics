Lord Jesus as we come to be solemn come to practice either my father in The Gospel family too many of your sons daughters for family members friends we all come together Hearts only broken Lord you'll miss him Lord but at the same time Lord now your spirit's about to take flight Lord we're so happy [Music] now Lord to fulfill reaction that said that to us Lord you can't do it without you it's now Lord bless the family blessed Associates precious and holy name the name Jesus amen [Music] [Music] yes [Music] and soon foreign [Music] [Music] Fitness [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Laughter] [Music] [Music] thank you foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] want to first of all read out of the book of First Corinthians the 15th chapter the first or the 12th verse that reads like this now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead I'll say some among you that there is no resurrection of the Dead but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is Christ not risen but now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept for he must Reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed is death behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet for the trumpet shall sound in the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptable must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptable shot put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory O Death where is thy sting oh great where is thy Victory but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ that's why we believe in a resurrection you know second Corinthians now chapter five and verse 1 and 2 says for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle be dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in Heavens For in this we groan earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven that's why Jesus said let not your hearts be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you that and if I go to prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself at where I am there ye may be also brother Branham says this in the message Fellowship by Redemption a mansion he meant a body a Dwelling Place for the scripture verifies the same thing and says if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting you see it mortal beings is the only one who lives in Mortal habitations Immortal beings live in Immortal habitations then the place that we go into until we return back is not a place of brick or mortar or clay or precious stones or Jewels it's a place of condition that we move out of this Dimension that we live into another dimension and it's a house a tabernacle a Dwelling Place Jesus said destroy this Temple and I'll raise it up in three days and they thought he was speaking of Solomon's Temple but he was speaking of his own body and he has gone to prepare a place for every believer at the very moment we step out of these mortal regions we don't go out into myth or some Supernatural Spirit we go into a tabernacle into a Dwelling Place we know we'll see our Papa again [Music] we always say this and I say papa well when you get there you you make sure you tell Mama we said hello give her a hug for us and we know it won't be long that we get to see them again that's the Blessed hope of the believer so as we bow Our Heads This Day and we approach our heavenly father we simply call upon him and say gracious loving father it is with all assurance that we plant the body of of the man that we call Pops our Earthly father and the only reason why we can have such an assurance is because 2000 years ago Lord you conquered death hell and the grave and you Rose victoriously and declared to every believer because I live you can live also words cannot describe the peace we feel in our hearts knowing that he fought the good fight he kept the faith he finished his course and we know that one of these mornings you will call and he will answer we commit this body to the ground from whence it came Earth to Earth dust to dust ashes to ashes and now O Lord we commit his spirit and soul to you The Giver of Life bless all our family Lord and our friends and loved ones that continue on this journey Comfort us with thy precious Holy Spirit and if anyone has gotten away from you may you pull them back to you Lord if anyone does not know you Lord may they come to Know You Lord we thank you for his life of service to you into your people and we ask all these things in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen God bless you amen Juan gloriosa Juan glorious [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music]

we believe that we're going to be together one day and to give a good example to his children that we see today so I I love this family they're very close to me many of the members I I have a lot of respect for and so I I wanted to say just a few short words is why I wanted to share that but uh I we are going to include our services by releasing some palomitas okay the family is going to do that we're going to say via con dios together when those are released and so we want to thank our our we want to take quite a few people I want to start with the Marine Corps League who's up there in the corner I want to show how much respect they have after they've already done fired they haven't moved and they're staying there out of respect to the family who's still holding the flags right and then we want to thank our members of the active duty military who traveled hours and hours just to be here for this particular service we want to thank the state police for their tremendous work and coming and stopping the traffic is for those of you for those of you who were on the interstate you saw how much that that helped us and kept us safe and of course all the friends or the relatives uh NMSU I want to also thank you thank them and the coach for having that little card I know that little card helped a lot or you'd be going back telling your doctor that you walked three miles so you know they helped us back and forth and that was a blessing so there was many many people that made this uh many many speakers many pastors too many to mentioned and but we the the family greatly appreciates everyone's uh kindness and and efforts that they were given so as we release the palomita and we all say that'll conclude our services and at that point we we wish you the best on your travels because I'm sure you'll be traveling back home okay are those who need on your travels and then the family will privately only only because of the the obstacles that we have over there are the only reason that that we're trying to keep you safe and so with that we conclude our services let's go ahead and have the family uh one more thing I think it would only be fitting that we uh that we depart with
