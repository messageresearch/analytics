[33:33] so remember when there used to be panels
[33:36] in Wednesday's here
[33:41] it'll be a panel tonight
[33:44] and you say well the panels are three or
[33:48] four guys up here
[33:51] you know that Moses conquered Egypt by
[33:54] himself
[34:00] I am the one
[34:02] I don't that I'm going to have upon me
[34:06] yes
[34:10] I thought
[34:13] thank you
[34:15] anyway
[34:20] and uh
[34:22] living in Silver City
[34:26] I heard there's no bound over there
[34:35] let us this evening
[34:39] and the as you see the
[34:42] the title of my message announcer to the
[34:45] Lord the Lord
[34:51] and the subtitle is the verb and adverbs
[35:01] Isaiah 19 19. is
[35:17] in that day shall there be an altar to
[35:20] the Lord in the midst of the land of
[35:22] Egypt and a pillar at the border of the
[35:24] Earth to the Lord
[35:33] the Lord had his Blessing to the arena
[35:35] of the world you may be seated
[35:42] and uh
[35:45] and the pastor were talking yesterday
[35:49] he mentioned uh
[35:52] says but you know that the United States
[35:55] needs more missionaries
[36:02] so when I got home I kept thinking so
[36:09] the United States needs more
[36:12] missionaries
[36:16] verse 4 Universal cuatro these are the
[36:21] generations of the heavens plural Esther
[36:25] San Los originales De Los Cielos plural
[36:28] because here he is not Elohim no more
[36:34] Elohim here he is Jehovah
[36:39] the one that exists with his family
[36:41] existed Familia
[36:44] God had provided everything for his
[36:47] family
[36:50] he even planted them a garden unless
[36:54] then he said
[36:56] let us make man in our image
[37:03] but in the image
[37:07] Adam had no fellowship with the animals
[37:13] and they belong to him yes
[37:20] I don't want to lose you
[37:22] pay close attention attention so God
[37:27] made a home for the image
[37:33] and he made it out of the ground
[37:39] but Satan came down
[37:42] and he found we can see in the
[37:48] serpente
[37:50] and the serpent was made out of the same
[37:54] material it is
[38:00] foreign
[38:03] but we find out that Adam and Eve lost
[38:06] their inheritance
[38:10] and they became homeless
[38:14] because brother Venom said
[38:18] that God was a great contractor
[38:23] and he had all my materials there in the
[38:27] beginning
[38:31] says I was there this is
[38:36] contract
[39:04] Satan wanted to have a kingdom
[39:09] and he took away the inheritance from
[39:13] Adam
[39:15] and he took control of the Building
[39:19] Material Company
[39:25] you can see he put Lucifer and his sons
[39:29] the imps is
[39:42] that is why you were born and I were
[39:44] born in sinus
[39:48] and you must be born again
[39:53] Genesis 4 11 and this is
[40:00] from the earth which has opened her
[40:03] mouth to receive thy brother's blood
[40:05] from thy hands maldito says
[40:16] when thou kills the ground it shall not
[40:19] hand sport yield unto thee her strength
[40:21] a fugitive and a vague abundant shall
[40:25] thou be in the Earth
[40:35] there was few
[40:37] and me is dead yes so for you
[40:41] [Music]
[40:52] there is a huge difference between a
[40:55] house
[40:57] that's why we were fugitives and wonders
[41:06] you never came to Earth in a home
[41:12] the only one that came to Earth in a
[41:16] home
[41:19] we're done
[41:22] casa
[41:28] follow me closely you give me the circus
[41:31] he is the only one that came in the
[41:33] image of God yes
[41:36] and the reason that you did not come in
[41:41] a home
[41:43] but in a house
[41:47] because Satan owned the building
[41:51] materials amen
[41:57] so
[42:00] if Satan supplied the minerals
[42:07] materials and gave you a house
[42:12] because this body is
[42:16] not made in the image of of a God where
[42:22] is
[42:37] your body is notice you have a hand like
[42:41] a monkey
[42:43] a food like a bear
[42:47] himself if you get a small bear
[42:54] you take the hide off
[42:57] and put him next to a human being
[43:02] they look almost the same because
[43:05] we were made in the image of a beast
[43:12] and Adam there was his uni
[43:15] what was that Adam there was his duty
[43:20] to lead the animals
[43:24] remember we were homeless
[43:29] when we were in the world
[43:33] we exhibited three stages
[43:40] if I would tell you
[43:42] how honest you are
[43:45] and if you pass through the whole three
[43:49] stages
[43:54] for three stages I'm not saying you
[43:57] until the three stages foreign
[43:59] but after I uh no I'm not gonna
[44:02] embarrass you no no no that's why I'm
[44:05] very concerned
[44:07] says
[44:09] I won't throw you under the bus
[44:13] I might throw you out the window
[44:18] no no no no no no no anyway and those
[44:22] mothers
[44:24] all of you that like to drink
[44:26] whatever collector you drink
[44:33] ing
[44:35] oh you drink a few beers or whatever
[44:41] and you start telling jokes
[44:45] you have a lot of jokes
[44:49] during the stage of a monkey
[44:53] and then you start drinking more and
[44:57] more
[44:59] and then you think that you're Mike
[45:01] Tyson local princess Mike Tyson I can
[45:04] whip every one of you here in this
[45:05] building
[45:09] you get into the stage of a lion
[45:17] and then you start drinking some more
[45:19] Mike okay
[45:28] oh we're over there oh my goodness
[45:32] you're in the state of a pig
[45:36] you're throwing up and just
[45:42] three stages
[45:44] of all of others like to drink
[45:49] but like
[45:51] then he said
[45:55] that man is dead
[45:58] he does not exist anymore
[46:03] he left in a house
[46:07] but thank God
[46:09] we got a home now
[46:13] amen amen
[46:17] Satan became the prince of the power of
[46:20] the years
[46:22] and he won the victory Victoria but no
[46:27] man could see into glory
[46:30] and like I said we had a house but not a
[46:33] home
[46:34] because when sin was committed in the
[46:38] garden
[46:40] oh heavens were shut off from Mankind
[46:45] and when the law go there went out of
[46:48] God in the beginning
[46:51] he did not come down
[46:56] he was made lower than the angels
[47:01] and he came down
[47:03] and took the form of a bondsman
[47:10] foreign
[47:39] so what is what is a a bondsman yes
[47:45] someone who takes responsibilities
[47:48] foreign
[48:33] needles
[48:45] but the son of man has no place
[48:49] so he came down
[48:52] to make a way for homeless men and women
[49:01] like you and me
[49:04] yo we were wonders
[49:08] Saint Luke 9 57 San Lucas
[49:16] and it came to pass that as they went in
[49:19] the way a certain man said unto him Lord
[49:22] I will follow thee where Peters whoever
[49:25] thou goeth yeah
[49:33] and Jesus said unto him the foxes have
[49:37] fold and birds of the year of Nest but
[49:40] the son of man has nowhere to lay his
[49:42] head is
[49:53] and he said unto another follow me but
[49:56] he said Lord suffer me first you go and
[49:59] bury my father is
[50:09] can you see this why we lived in a house
[50:16] and we did not have a home
[50:19] because we worried more about the that
[50:24] the family and the things that in the
[50:28] world
[50:32] and what does the scripture says
[50:36] Let the dead bury the dead
[50:43] next scripture
[50:45] and another one said Lord I will follow
[50:48] thee but let me first go beat them
[50:51] farewell which are at home in my house
[51:04] and Jesus said unto him
[51:07] no man
[51:09] having put his hand to the plow
[51:12] and looking back is Faith for the
[51:15] kingdom of God is
[51:24] so what did God do into the case Studios
[51:27] he stressed his tent is
[51:33] from being Jehovah
[51:35] to become men Emmanuel
[51:57] leaving the house for a home
[52:03] God stretched his terms
[52:06] and gave us a home
[52:09] and he got a home tomorrow
[52:14] Perez
[52:18] put your name
[52:22] notice he can say Saint John 1 1 San
[52:27] Juan Uno Uno
[52:33] in the beginning was the verb in the
[52:37] verb was with God and the verb was God
[52:46] you see in Spanish he does say the verb
[52:50] is
[52:53] verse 14.
[52:58] and though
[53:00] the verb was made flesh and dwelt
[53:03] amongst us
[53:08] so notice
[53:10] verse 1
[53:14] is the verb es el variable verse 14
[53:18] verse
[53:26] because he's see the verb was made flesh
[53:30] we're talking about the verb and the
[53:33] adverbs
[53:39] you know what Jacob when I was going to
[53:41] high school
[53:44] I did not like the course of English I
[53:47] think I hate it
[53:53] you know we were stubborn not knowing
[53:56] that later in life you would need all of
[53:59] this animals
[54:04] so we learned about all these
[54:07] punctuations
[54:10] so now we're learning about the verbio
[54:20] Vero
[54:33] I told you it was going to be a panel
[54:37] because you're gonna have a lot of
[54:39] preaching during the weekend
[54:42] so I want you to learn this evening
[54:47] Hey Brother Abraham is giving us an
[54:49] English lesson yeah
[54:53] I'm not trying to boast you know
[54:58] I'm going to school mostly I was
[55:00] Australian students
[55:05] and then I went to high school
[55:09] and I I was kind of lazy
[55:13] and I got one leg at Ace for the
[55:18] one-legged eight
[55:21] take one legal Avenue
[55:31] it was true
[55:37] as we would go to a church as young
[55:40] people
[55:41] Jesus
[55:43] we want to see Mary
[55:47] remember
[55:50] I mean say that to anyone you know say
[55:53] the truth
[55:56] but like Danny said that man already
[56:00] leap in a house
[56:05] thank God he's got a home now
[56:09] amen amen
[56:12] ad signifies Direction
[56:18] and it modifies the verb
[56:23] because it changes the form of a
[56:26] morphism
[56:32] I know I got to say what does morphine
[56:36] and all that means
[56:39] I know I have some of you in suspenders
[56:45] but pay attention and you learned
[56:49] Genesis 14 verse 18.
[56:57] king of Salem brought forth Bread and
[57:00] Wine and he was the priest of the most
[57:03] high God is
[57:12] and he blessed him and said Blessed Be
[57:15] Abram of the most high God processor of
[57:18] Heaven and Earth is
[57:30] not the verb
[57:33] he was the Earth
[57:38] it was the verb it is
[57:44] let's go a little further okay
[57:48] the word More film the problem
[57:52] it is a transformation as una
[57:56] transformation from the image
[58:00] of one object into another
[58:06] how
[58:09] if you go to revelation
[58:12] chapter one
[58:14] apocalypse is
[58:17] one like the son of man they say
[58:24] was it was there by the Candlestick is
[58:30] that one a verb or red verb yes
[58:41] okay let me give you another scripture
[58:45] because I know some of you are not
[58:47] getting it
[58:50] it's a problem first test you don't have
[58:53] to turn for it
[58:57] says the Lord himself
[59:01] shall defend from heaven with a shout
[59:04] yes
[59:08] so I asked the question
[59:11] who descended
[59:14] the verb or the adverbio
[59:19] we
[59:20] morpheme and More theme
[59:24] it brother says he came down in
[59:29] morphejo
[59:31] come from the word more films
[59:36] it was someone just like him
[59:41] and it was the verbio
[59:50] so but you can understand
[59:53] there you know what we had more problems
[59:56] with ministers in that in that scripture
[1:00:00] than almost any other stuff
[1:00:05] because still still
[1:00:09] a lot of ministers Muslim ministers
[1:00:12] worldwide
[1:00:13] believe that there is Jesus Christ the
[1:00:17] coming down
[1:00:21] when we know
[1:00:24] that the heavens must retain him
[1:00:29] until the restoration of all things
[1:00:34] so the one that came
[1:00:37] was the
[1:00:40] adverbs Direction
[1:00:48] what does it
[1:00:54] expression it expresses time Express
[1:00:58] place
[1:01:06] so God said
[1:01:08] let us make
[1:01:11] at the adverbs
[1:01:15] and he will have control and Authority
[1:01:19] here on Earth
[1:01:22] and notice that in Genesis he can say in
[1:01:27] kinesis
[1:01:28] he the Lord said
[1:01:31] he will have my name
[1:01:36] what was the name of God
[1:01:43] tell us nowhere
[1:01:52] well
[1:01:53] did Moses says well who is said sending
[1:01:57] me Andrea

[1:02:39] so then Adam had his name
[1:02:47] is
[1:02:53] the same name is
[1:03:08] so in the beginning
[1:03:11] when he made the Stars
[1:03:15] the Planet Las planetas the
[1:03:18] constellations
[1:03:19] he was making the first Bible
[1:03:24] which is the name of the first Bible was
[1:03:27] what is Mariah

[1:03:47] fatherhood okay

[1:03:54] and the Zodiac starts with the
[1:03:57] constellation of Virgo or virgin La
[1:04:00] constellation primero in zodiaco is
[1:04:06] it's the first coming is
[1:04:08] and it ends with a constellation of Leo
[1:04:12] the
[1:04:13] Lionel and Leon the second coming
[1:04:17] God declares things in heaven just
[1:04:20] declaration
[1:04:22] before he does on Earth
[1:04:25] and all their Heavenly hosts it always
[1:04:30] not one of them is other places
[1:04:34] every one of them keep its time
[1:04:37] perfectly
[1:04:44] and disrupted the whole plan of god
[1:04:50] notice the verb and the
[1:04:53] adverbs
[1:04:55] God the verb
[1:04:58] had given them the adverb of prophets
[1:05:04] to the first Bible propheta

[1:05:16] siete
[1:05:17] which commendeth the sun it trusted not

[1:05:36] can you make it he put a seal through
[1:05:38] the Stars
[1:05:42] which alone spreaders of the heavens and
[1:05:45] prayers upon the waves of the sea is
[1:05:50] Del Mar
[1:05:53] which make it a tourists Orion and
[1:05:57] Pleiades in the chambers of the South
[1:05:59] here is
[1:06:08] in the planets because he was the dead
[1:06:11] Prophet is
[1:06:20] you know
[1:06:22] can stop buying the sweet influences of
[1:06:25] the plei 80s or lose the bells of Orion
[1:06:30] Orion
[1:06:40] can thou bring forth Nazareth in his
[1:06:42] season Arkansas guide our tourists with
[1:06:46] his sons
[1:06:58] Tierra
[1:07:11] but they were
[1:07:12] [Music]
[1:07:14] disobedientes and God had to destroy
[1:07:17] them
[1:07:18] so God gave them another prophet
[1:07:22] this
[1:07:27] Isaiah 1919 again
[1:07:35] in their day shall there be announcer to
[1:07:39] the Lord foreign
[1:08:10] mama
[1:08:16] Zoe Zoe
[1:08:20] in history
[1:08:22] who made that altar
[1:08:24] where are you that thing
[1:08:31] helper destiny
[1:08:50] gorilla
[1:08:51] huh thank you enough Enoch Enoch their
[1:08:56] altar was like a pyramid that he not
[1:08:58] made
[1:09:02] remember it was made to the Lord
[1:09:06] there was a second Bible yes amen
[1:09:19] and that altar yes altar was put in the
[1:09:25] center of the earth
[1:09:28] and it it was powerless with the first
[1:09:32] Bible is
[1:09:39] aligned with three stars
[1:09:45] it was called the belt of Orion
[1:09:48] the Orion
[1:09:51] absolutely
[1:10:15] what is the absolute in the sky
[1:10:19] absolutely
[1:10:22] somebody again
[1:10:30] what is the absolute in the sky yes
[1:10:40] if I look at them they get scared
[1:10:45] I thought that that Spirit had passed
[1:10:49] away because they used to get scary in
[1:10:51] theater Hills remember
[1:10:55] scary if I start walking through the
[1:10:57] eyes I
[1:11:03] anybody
[1:11:09] the North Star is
[1:11:13] thank you gracias amen amen the absolute
[1:11:17] is the North Star is the only star that
[1:11:19] doesn't move
[1:11:23] and the chef in the king's chamber is
[1:11:29] he said that it was the pathway into the
[1:11:33] heavens
[1:11:38] that the pyramid
[1:11:41] had a 144
[1:11:45] 000 cases
[1:11:51] is in that Bible is
[1:11:55] 144.
[1:11:57] revelation 21. apocalypse is
[1:12:03] 21 15.
[1:12:06] and either talking with me had a golden
[1:12:09] Reed to measure the city and the grace
[1:12:13] thereof in the world
[1:12:25] and the city's last Foursquare
[1:12:33] the pyramid is Foursquare
[1:12:37] and the length is as large as the bread
[1:12:42] he
[1:12:43] and he measures the city with the Reed
[1:12:46] 12
[1:12:48] 000 furlongs
[1:12:53] is
[1:13:13] in 12 000 prolonged 144
[1:13:18] 000.
[1:13:30] they say because the pyramid is tuned to
[1:13:35] the Earth magnetic
[1:13:37] frequency is
[1:13:58] an effect of the people around it is
[1:14:21] so the pyramid means a measure of light
[1:14:29] causing ancient times
[1:14:33] when they originally built the pyramids
[1:14:39] it would shine at night
[1:14:43] you know why
[1:14:46] pyramid is
[1:14:48] covered with polished Jews
[1:14:57] I wonder how long those groups lasted
[1:15:00] before the thieves tolerance
[1:15:07] the pyramid is a Bible
[1:15:10] is foreign
[1:15:42] I like to read books
[1:15:45] and and
[1:15:55] [Music]
[1:16:04] you know
[1:16:06] I have a home now
[1:16:12] in the message
[1:16:14] so you see where we learn this message
[1:16:29] these Mysteries estos mysterious have
[1:16:33] been hid understood Escondido since the
[1:16:37] foundation of the world
[1:16:40] waiting for the manifestation of Abraham
[1:16:44] Paris Esperanto La manifestation
[1:16:48] [Music]
[1:16:50] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:16:53] sons
[1:16:57] that don't live in a house but live in a
[1:16:59] home
[1:17:04] Pickens it
[1:17:07] they're waiting for the manifestation
[1:17:11] of the sons of God
[1:17:15] to display them to the church
[1:17:20] I am displaying them right now to you
[1:17:24] studies originalismo
[1:17:33] the Ark of the Covenant
[1:17:37] Del pacto have the same measurements
[1:17:42] is a stone copper in the king's chamber
[1:17:45] okay
[1:17:50] or you don't know that the copper is
[1:17:53] means the coffin
[1:17:59] oh
[1:18:00] the inner chamber of the temple
[1:18:06] where the holy of holies words
[1:18:23] you see how it goes together
[1:18:26] because the great Granite sarcophagus is
[1:18:31] a
[1:18:47] was in direct alignment
[1:18:52] with a down-powering ray of cosmic life
[1:18:59] cosmica through the shaft
[1:19:04] that was pointing to the North Stars
[1:19:09] and in the king's chamber in a camera
[1:19:12] Del Rey it was a great force
[1:19:17] centered
[1:19:19] since Granite is
[1:19:22] saturated
[1:19:25] with minute crystals
[1:19:30] and the voltage came from that
[1:19:34] incredible Cosmic form this
[1:19:59] Granite inside the king's chamber
[1:20:04] granitos
[1:20:07] they came from Mount Sinai been on Del
[1:20:11] Monte where Moses got the Ten
[1:20:14] Commandments
[1:20:16] that is why the priest
[1:20:19] to her church
[1:20:24] the war protective garments
[1:20:30] charged with cosmic power that was
[1:20:34] cosmica there had to be in harmony
[1:20:41] we can say
[1:20:45] Crystal Crystal
[1:20:49] to maintain its potency
[1:20:53] each Ark had to be constantly recharged
[1:21:01] with a Creative Energy
[1:21:04] [Music]
[1:21:06] of tremendous voltage
[1:21:09] and the principle source is
[1:21:19] foreign
[1:21:40] energetically
[1:21:44] you are electric instead is electrical
[1:21:49] do you have electricity inside of you is
[1:21:55] foreign
[1:22:04] [Music]
[1:22:37] generating a charge of almost two volts
[1:22:45] at a specific frequency
[1:22:48] [Music]
[1:22:50] for that
[1:22:52] Organo you are more than simply an
[1:22:56] electrical being
[1:22:59] electrical the electricity
[1:23:03] there are produced by our bodies
[1:23:08] let me tell you this evening
[1:23:12] without their electricity flowing
[1:23:15] through your body
[1:23:19] could not read the Bible
[1:23:25] Korea
[1:23:32] you couldn't read the Bible
[1:23:35] because your brain will not work
[1:23:39] eat that one um
[1:23:43] Home Alone
[1:23:44] everything is made up of atoms
[1:23:49] and since our bodies
[1:23:53] are huge masses of atoms so Grandes
[1:23:58] masses the atomos we can generate
[1:24:02] electricity electricity
[1:24:05] and Adams
[1:24:07] are made up of protons
[1:24:11] there's a positive charge
[1:24:14] positivo are made up of
[1:24:18] neutrons neutronis that's a natural
[1:24:22] charge this is
[1:24:24] made up of electrons the electronics
[1:24:27] it's a negative charge
[1:24:31] so the atoms can carry a positive or A
[1:24:35] negative terms
[1:24:40] by gaining or losing electrons
[1:24:46] so the flow of electrons between the
[1:24:50] atoms
[1:24:51] electronics
[1:24:53] that is what we call electricity
[1:24:58] the scientists the syntheticos agree is
[1:25:03] that your body when it's at rest
[1:25:08] can produce a hundred watts of power
[1:25:13] siento
[1:25:16] is
[1:25:25] in other words
[1:25:30] you have enough power
[1:25:33] you
[1:25:34] have enough electricity
[1:25:42] unless you die you have enough
[1:25:44] electricity in your body
[1:25:48] that you can get a life
[1:25:52] buckle and make it like
[1:26:04] yeah
[1:26:05] see
[1:26:06] the scientists prove that losiniticus
[1:26:10] and you would like to jog or go
[1:26:13] sprinting
[1:26:18] you can have the ability to Output 2 000
[1:26:22] watts of power in your body is
[1:26:32] remember the ones that carried the
[1:26:37] arka they had to be recharged
[1:26:40] and we carry electricity
[1:26:45] but let me warn you that like if you buy
[1:26:48] one of those electric cars they wouldn't
[1:26:50] do you no good is that companies
[1:26:55] well I couldn't afford one area
[1:27:03] it takes Quentin almost 26 000 years
[1:27:10] and it's called the precession of the
[1:27:13] equinoxes
[1:27:17] of which the Earth Transit
[1:27:21] Transit through 12 signs of the zodiac
[1:27:26] for Las doses
[1:27:29] did we just read it
[1:27:33] job prophesied
[1:27:39] are tourists with his sons
[1:27:45] our tourists our tourists was Jacob
[1:27:50] and his 12th song is
[1:27:52] so then the notice he can say
[1:27:57] the Sun as he goes around
[1:28:04] it takes 12
[1:28:06] 000 years on each
[1:28:09] son
[1:28:12] or the Earth
[1:28:16] twelve thousand years
[1:28:18] and so to go around
[1:28:23] it takes all these years
[1:28:28] there is a black hole in the middle of
[1:28:31] the Milky Way
[1:28:40] so everybody has seen it
[1:28:44] and the sun will cross the Milky Way
[1:28:49] right in the middle of the black hole
[1:28:55] negro and it will form a Celestial cross
[1:28:58] celestial
[1:29:03] it'll be the first time in 26 000 years
[1:29:10] and the conversion was on the sign of
[1:29:14] Leo the Lion he is
[1:29:19] the lion means judgment
[1:29:23] is the the last scientific before
[1:29:28] judgment is
[1:29:31] so the reflection
[1:29:34] reflection between the ground and the
[1:29:38] sky
[1:29:45] it causes a Causeway
[1:29:49] crucified that goes from the Great
[1:29:53] Pyramid
[1:29:56] and the sunrise
[1:29:59] Del Sol
[1:30:02] and those things
[1:30:04] yes
[1:30:06] foreign
[1:30:14] in the face of our
[1:30:18] Angel
[1:30:20] a female
[1:30:23] so you see you see the first coming the
[1:30:27] The
[1:30:29] Virginian and the last one was the lion
[1:30:34] they had joined together in the springs
[1:30:40] looking directly at Leo
[1:30:46] they made the pyramid
[1:30:50] to align with three stars
[1:30:55] but now at the end
[1:30:58] for the first time
[1:31:01] it's not gonna be three stars
[1:31:04] to align with the pyramids
[1:31:11] has never happened
[1:31:14] a line with the pyramids
[1:31:18] and that's
[1:31:21] Jupiter is
[1:31:25] amen amen foreign
[1:31:34] because
[1:31:36] and I'll close with this it was
[1:31:44] okay
[1:31:47] when Jupiter condo
[1:31:51] we said
[1:31:54] and it has happened every presidential
[1:31:58] election
[1:32:01] presidential and they all die in office
[1:32:05] okay
[1:32:14] and this happens every 20 years
[1:32:21] when Saturn and Jupiter come almost
[1:32:26] together
[1:32:30] in 1840 in military
[1:32:34] William Henry Harrison William Harry
[1:32:38] Harrison died in office of pneumonia
[1:32:42] established
[1:32:46] then 20 years more in the 1860s
[1:32:54] Abraham Lincoln was assassinated
[1:33:01] foreign
[1:33:04] [Music]
[1:33:27] uh yeah yeah 20 years later Ben Daniels
[1:33:31] is best in the 1900s and minosiantos
[1:33:36] William McKinley was assassinated
[1:33:40] remember this is Eric conjunction of
[1:33:43] pharaoh and Jupiter
[1:33:47] in 1920 20 years later
[1:33:53] William Harding died in office of a
[1:33:56] heart attack William Hardy President
[1:34:02] 20 years later in the 1940s
[1:34:09] Franklin Roosevelt
[1:34:11] died in office our cerebral hammering
[1:34:14] Franklin Roosevelt
[1:34:19] 20 years later
[1:34:21] in the 1960s
[1:34:26] was assassinated
