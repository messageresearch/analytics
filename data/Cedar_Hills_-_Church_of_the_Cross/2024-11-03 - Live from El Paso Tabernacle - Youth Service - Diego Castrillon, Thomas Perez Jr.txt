grateful and our hearts are Overjoyed because of what you've done for us we pray Lord Jesus that your holy sweet spirit that is in the building right now will come and dwell in the heart of every individual and will give them the desire of their hearts in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen you may be seated I want to entitle my message t i just add water with a subtitle how do you like that you're way too excited I might have got off on the wrong exit you know I want to start off with this story there is a story that that many times we as Believers we sing songs and we don't know the history of them you ever sing there's power in the blood and people don't sing it like there's power you know but but there there we go have you ever heard of the song called I have decided to follow Jesus I have decided to follow Jesus this hymn originated in India the lyrics are based on the last words of a man in G Assam about 150 years ago there was a great Revival in Wales as a result of this many missionaries came to Northeast India to spread the gospel the region known as a was comprised of hundreds of tribes who were primitive and aggressive Head Hunters into these hostile and aggressive communities came a a group of missionaries from the American Baptist missions spreading the message of love peace and hope in Jesus Christ naturally they were not welcom one missionary succeeded in converting a man his wife and two children this man's Faith proved contagious and many villagers began to accept Christianity angry the The Village Chief summoned all the villagers he then called the family who had first converted to renounce their faith in public or face execution moved by the Holy Spirit the man and said I have decided to follow [Music] Jesus enraged at the refusal of the man the chief ordered his archers to arrow down his two children as both boys were laying twitching on the floor the chief asked will you deny your faith you have lost both your children you will lose your wife too but the man replied though none joins me no none go with me till I will follow the chief was beside himself with Fury and ordered his wife wife to be killed in a moment she joined her two children in death now he asks the last time I will give you one more opportunity to deny your faith in the face of death the man said the final memor memorable lines the cross before me the World Behind Me no turning back I won't turn back he was shot dead just like the rest of his family but with their deaths brought a miracle the chief who had ordered the killings was moved by the faith of the man he wondered why should this man his wife and two children die for a man who lived in a far away land on another continent some 2,000 years ago there must be some remarkable power behind the family's faith and I too want to taste that faith in a spontaneous confession of Faith he declared I too belong to Jesus Christ when the crowd heard this from the mouth of their Chief the whole village accepted Christ as their lord and savior the song is based on the last words of Noam a man from the G tribe it is today the song of the people I have [Applause] decided I have decided come on young people come on Millions people I follow Jesus how do you like that how do you like that when you can look at your problems and say I believe that Jesus Oh Christ already healed me how do you like that when you can raise up your hands W there's been lots of you that haven't raised up your hands in years because all of a sudden we're in the message brother it's because I'm deep we have become so deep that now we're stuck we don't just know how to raise up our hands we don't know how to shout we don't know how to say hallelujah the Lord every time you do that the devil takes noce I want to tell the devil tonight how God Amen Just Add Water I'm not going to stay very long you better get into it you're going to miss it you're going to miss it ain't staying very long if you don't get into it now you're going to miss it but I'll tell you one thing this is a dry and thirsty land men don't know if they're men anymore woman does not know if she's a woman Christians don't know if they're Christian Maliah 45 don't know if God sent a prophet or not it's the dry and thirsty Land There is no water and we got the ingredients we got the message we got the books we got the Bible we have the tapes but there is nothing to put it together it's a dry and thirsty land it's a desert there is no water but let me tell you what happened in February 28 of 1963 there came the cloud in the desert of Arizona what did it come to do they came to give us water [Music] [Applause] [Music] how many have ever tried to make cement and make it stick on the wall nobody you have the ingredients you have the cement you have the you have the the the the sand and you mix it real good and you're real happy but there's no water what is this for why do you raise up your hands okay the prophet of God is in Sabino Canyon he's not kicking back in his couch he is in Pulpit Rock he is kneeling down in Pulpit Rock his hands [Music] raised and Malachi 4:5 can't raise their hands what fell into his hand are you Believers shout it now then what fell into his hand it was the sword of the king is that the word what happened the next month a cloud picked him up now you're you're you're going to go and somebody on the internet's going to tell you that this is a lie somebody that has no water and they're going to tell you how to mix your ingredients never stick and it will never change your life until the water is added to your ingredients okay sisters how many know how to make tortillas one that's sad wow wow wow that's that's that's terrible how many know what sisters how many know what a microwave is It's Tricky H how many you know how to make tortillas all right good do you add sister do you put a water in it so you can get it together all right when there's no water you cannot unite your ingredients can I tell you this demons can't swim you should have been flying out of your news flash brother Caleb Guerrero demons can't swim you know how to add water to your experience you raise up your hands you start saying hallelujah and water starts flowing it starts flowing from one person to the other you know what the devils like they like dry desert places you say is Desert say is is desert isert but what happened in the desert you a too excited somebody got to say hi when you raise up your hands come on young people I want to tell you one thing I used to be I was going to say I used to be not I used to be you guys I was young one time now I'm old I know I still look good my wife tells me that I appreciate that but I used to be you you haven't been me yet you you're not me yet now believe it or not next march I'll be 60 years old but I used to be how old are you how much 34 my goodness gracious it's like a long time ago for but I used to be 34 years old and I then I got older and I got older but one thing that never got old in me is my experience with Jesus Christ never got old never got old every day it's the renewing every single day now sisters there's going to come some guys and they're going to come and try to talk to you and they're going to start saying you're very beautiful and before you go I want you to ask him first do you have a new birth Brothers there's going to come some beautiful ladies and they're going to come and say you're so handsome by the time you know it you're like first question is do you have the Holy Ghost before you go home you find out if they have the Holy Ghost because if they don't they're an insane person that's what brother brandham says a man without the Holy Ghost is an insane person but I guarantee you right now that in 30 seconds you can receive a new birth and a of the Holy Ghost you don't need a long service you just need to get some water and that water will come to where you're at now somebody say how do you like how do we worship we worship like according to our television that we have at home if we have a little one we do this you ever see people do this when I see people do this I'm I'm like for real you ever see people do this don't hurt yourself but you worship according to the TV you have 100 if you have 100 you're that's for young people how do you screwing a li bulb nobody knows how do you screw in two light bul this is the way you worship this is the way you start when you love the Lord what are you doing he's kneeling down in pop rock reive a sword of the king calling am this is the only gospel that has ever hit the face of the world that will change the life of every individual but what do we get what do we do instead of calling for rain we start seeing how many ingredients we can mix together and I don't care how much ingredients you put in there if you have no rain you can't mix it together it's just a bunch of mess I know more than you I know more than you I know more than you you're just putting ingredients together but when the people of God get together and they call for rain they call for blessing then the river starts FL the river starts flowing all of a sudden demons don't bother you as muchen you ever you you ever want to have the devil bother you stop doing this stay in your bench impress me pastor impress me impr you gave me a key a a porterhouse steak yesterday Porter House give me another one and what have you become you've been become f for the devil because the devil can still cross to where you're at but let the Praises come down and let the water start flowing flowing in your members all the demons say how deep is this going to get you know I can't swim do you know how to swim no I don't know how to swim do you know how to swim that's why I tell you to every problem that you have Add Water [Applause] add it right now it right now don't wait for after a while start adding your water that's the water of the Holy [Applause] Ghost how do you like how do you like that how do you like that yes siren I got that from our pastoring the other day this is what you have to do so the devil sees how deep your water is going to in the Book of Ezekiel it started coming to his feet then it started coming to his ankles then it started coming to his knees then it started coming up high and it started coming up to where nobody could pass over you know why demons can't swim so what do they do to you see you later when Daniel sees the Lions what does he see he sees two big pillows when you see your circumstance what do you see when David saw Goliath he said I know that Goliath has come down for one reason where did he get his Stone from he got it from The Brick from The Brook where water was flowing can I say this to you when you see the your your enemy when you see your Giants brother Jesse when you see your Giants coming to your Valley he comes for one purpose and that is to [Music] die give somebody a high five five just make sure it's their hand not their face I'm finishing I'm finishing how do you like that sisters how do you like that how do you like that how do you like to defeat the enemy every time how many of you are suffering from depression and anxiety this is what you do this and sister this you know I suffered from depression for a long time until I found out when demons can't swim I raise up my hand and I let him drown in the river and I let him drown in the river let your demons drown in the river let your demons drown in the river let the praise of God [Applause] after a while we're we're in a few seconds here we're going to have brother Diego come and pray he's going to speak to you and he's going to pray for you but I was wondering today when the promises of God are so real okay how many of you go to these sites of why you shouldn't believe the message okay let me tell you what they do and this is by a man that was close to them at one time these people like believe the sign I always say I always say this Here's your sign you're stupid amen right amen you have to call out the demon of what it is when when Jesus prayed for the man he said these words th dumb and stupid Spirit you're the translator this is where what it's all at they put on their headphones and listen to heavy metal music before they start studying the word and that anointing is coming from the fourth dimension and it's coming to come to your mind first but it does not want to stay with your mind it wants to get to your heart it wants to get to the throne it to get to where the real you are so when you go and you start you start looking at the magazines young guys you look at magazines of girls and you say oh that's a pretty girl that girl don't exist it's a figment of somebody's imagination and everybody says Oh What a Beautiful Woman the only beautiful Beau woman I see is the Bride of the lordes cuz she's vested in the glory she's rested vested in the power of what Jesus has done in transforming her life if I could just be that woman if I could just be that man let me tell you what you have to be a Christian first of all you got to decide what what am I going to do I have decided since I was 5 years old I've been preaching behind a desk I've been preaching the gospel for more than 55 years I have decided to follow Jesus I have no plan that's I believe that God sent fourth brother William Mar he is the Elijah he's the seventh angel he's the only one that God himself took a picture with he's the only one that added water that has water so here we are let me tell you people on the internet don't exist that's why they're on the internet you know that you put onto the internet what you want to get out right yeah so if you put madas that's what you're going to get if you put dumb things you're going to get that that's what you're going to get but if you put in the word of God so they hear they hear heavy metal music brings an anointing but let me tell you what my papa used to do what our pastor keeps on doing my papa would hear the word of God 18 hours a day until he would hear the real to real go and every once in a while I would see him and all of a sudden he start running you know what happened he had just received a revelation when was the last time you ran brother you know it just don't happen no more no no not if you're not if you're just a stick no but if you're a river Rivers always run Lakes don't run but Rivers do and he said he that believeth in me out of his valy shallow River okay brother D's he's he's up to bat now all right I want you to get this right now at this moment God can give you the desire of your heart right now let me tell you what happened in Durban South Africa brother brandham said 30,000 raw native heathens came to the Lord it was 10 times greater than the day of Pentecost so I know tonight you want what happened in in R to happen right now right but it's going to be greater because there's more water oh come on somebody add your it [Applause] it 30,000 he said it was greater than the day of and brother brandham said this the greatest anointing I thought was when 30,000 gave their heart to the Lord until he met had Wright wght that was the first time that that anointing was let loose to a human being what was the anointing it was the water [Applause] men that's right you know Dynamite won't even move you right now how are we going to go in the Rapture do you know we're already in the Rapture news flash you're already in the rapture we have already reive the voice the voice the voice that come up higher the only thing we have to do is add water I want you to fall in love with the Lord Jesus Christ as much and more than I have what did har right say it's nothing but the truth what do you say how do you like that again how Ro said that's nothing but the truth what do you say tonight how do you like [Applause] that I've heard you shout more
