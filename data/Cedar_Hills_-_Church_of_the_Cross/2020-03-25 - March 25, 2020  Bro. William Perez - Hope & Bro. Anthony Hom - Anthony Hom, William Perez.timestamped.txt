[36:44] you know you kill a lamb but I'm at
[36:47] every household according to their
[36:49] eating had to kill their own lamb but
[36:51] Kadokawa Casa de azúcar zumbathon super
[36:54] Cordero but maybe there was somebody
[36:55] that um that was a little lazy Roberto a

[37:52] requests and about it was no obedience
[37:54] to the word Abedini up tells us to the
[37:56] Tokyo Appa lara caylo in t2 lon and so
[37:59] the directions were lousy lacuna say
[38:02] don't kill the lamb let it be of the
[38:04] first year mun jeong's you know that
[38:08] ma'am but according to the eating of

[38:37] lamb become a equal verifies that you
[38:40] may luck reficul pieces and take it
[38:42] inside of you be gentle they so not only
[38:44] did they have the blood on the lintel
[38:46] and on the door Pinellas Italian telly
[38:48] and they had - the lamb inside of there
[38:50] - el cordero tin tray like us and not
[38:53] only was a lamb and the unleavened bread
[38:55] inside of their house solo Yelp a
[38:57] syllable but each and every member of
[38:59] that household economy Ambrosio God had
[39:02] to take the lamb and the unleavened
[39:03] bread inside of el pan it's in the
[39:06] radial Cordero control a and brother
