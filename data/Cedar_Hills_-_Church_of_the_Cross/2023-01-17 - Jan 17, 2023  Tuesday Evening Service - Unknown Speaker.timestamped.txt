[36:36] Romans 6 10 repeats
[36:39] Romano says yes it says for in that he
[36:42] died
[36:46] he died unto sin once
[36:51] I'm gonna finish right there
[36:54] you may be serious may God bless his
[36:58] word
[36:59] because we know we know the theme is the
[37:02] the day I died
[37:05] you know you know when when when
[37:07] somebody or a family member passes away
[37:12] they they under under gravestone
[37:17] it has the day they were born
[37:23] but then it also has the day they died
[37:29] but how many remember the day you died
[37:33] do I remember the day I died
[37:37] you know there was a day I had to die
[37:40] and I was a young person at one time
[37:44] and I got baptized and I thought I was
[37:48] doing really well
[37:49] I was doing I was doing really good is
[37:54] got married
[37:56] I was 19 years old
[37:58] and I thought I had it all
[38:01] I thought I had it made I thought I
[38:04] could do whatever I wanted
[38:07] but then how many US of us have
[38:10] young friends that that are from the
[38:13] world
[38:15] see because when we die We Gotta Die
[38:17] daily
[38:20] tried once Jesus but we gotta die out
[38:24] daily
[38:26] this flesh has Gotta Die Out daily
[38:30] but I thought I was I was okay to have
[38:33] friends in the world
[38:35] Amigos so I was working I meet a couple
[38:39] of guys
[38:44] and I I thought I was strong if your
[38:46] tickets
[38:48] but this this this flesh didn't want to
[38:51] die
[38:52] he still wanted to partake of the world
[38:57] but if we don't die out to the world
[39:00] then then what are we going to do
[39:03] I was pulling they were pulling me then
[39:06] then I should have been pulling them
[39:10] you can't have
[39:12] your cake no nobody else no place to
[39:15] pastel and eat it too you can't you've
[39:19] got to be a separate people this evening
[39:25] now we're going to talk to people yes
[39:38] because because in in in First
[39:42] Corinthians
[39:44] in 1533 I just added that Ronnie I'm
[39:47] sorry but it says be not deceived this
[39:50] is
[39:53] evil Communications
[40:00] corrupt good manners
[40:05] no it is conversations
[40:11] evil Communications
[40:15] what are evil Communications
[40:18] it's something that the devil doesn't
[40:20] want you to do is
[40:23] he doesn't want you to serve the Lord
[40:26] he doesn't want you to know your purpose
[40:29] in life
[40:31] so in saying all this is
[40:36] but the day I died
[40:40] and my wife can remember this
[40:43] I was out doing the things that I was
[40:46] doing and
[40:47] I believe he told brother Mike
[40:51] our founding pastors
[40:54] he said if he keeps it up
[40:58] sister Rachel would be the youngest
[41:00] Widow in Grant County uh
[41:05] that does not shake you see
[41:08] coming from the word it's the word of
[41:10] the Lord
[41:12] said get your act together
[41:14] at least that's it you're gonna die well
[41:18] that's the day I died
[41:20] I surrendered my heart
[41:33] that's why we gotta Die daily foreign
[42:09] and what I'm trying to say is us as
[42:11] Christians young men young young ladies
[42:15] even some of the older ones
[42:17] we think we're doing good
[42:21] and we can keep Communications with with
[42:24] the friends we used to hang out with you
[42:25] know
[42:28] we may think we're strong
[42:31] but a little too much of that
[42:34] we'll pull you a little too much over
[42:37] there
[42:38] and a little too much over there and a
[42:41] little too much over there and a little
[42:44] too much before you know it there's a

[53:09] sometimes you're trying to serve God and
[53:11] at the same time we're trying to
[53:13] entertain this body
[53:16] we focused in on the terrestrial things
[53:22] no matter where you are
[53:25] important
[53:30] whatever it is

[53:36] will bring you to him bring you with
[53:50] however it is
[53:52] God will bring you with Christ when he
[53:57] comes
[54:03] many times we blame it in the
[54:05] circumstances
[54:14] patience please

[54:28] blame different things or different
[54:29] people

[54:38] me

[54:59] altar
[55:04] excuses once and again

[55:14] doesn't look at you it's like something
[55:21] like your father your mother like any
[55:24] person in him he doesn't look at you
[55:27] like it's just a little child
[55:29] your decision is
[55:31] your decision with God
[55:35] all right
[55:36] you see if if your your opinion your
[55:39] decision of Christ is dropping you on to

[1:10:23] wow
[1:10:26] he just set the bar up really high right
[1:10:28] now
[1:10:31] that's what he does that's my big
[1:10:33] brother right yes yes he don't let me
[1:10:36] slacks
[1:10:40] mine is stand
[1:10:42] Ard is
[1:10:47] in Corinthians second Corinthians
[1:10:49] chapter 6 16.
[1:10:53] this he says
[1:11:05] thank you
[1:11:07] and what agreement hath the temple of
[1:11:09] God with the idols
[1:11:16] for ye are the Temple of the Living God
[1:11:21] as God has said I will dwell in them
[1:11:26] and walk in them and I will be their God
[1:11:32] and they shall be my people amen
[1:11:40] thank you
[1:11:42] you know the Lord has really been using
[1:11:44] that scripture with me in my life
[1:11:47] personally yes
[1:11:52] for the last two years
[1:11:57] and it has really
[1:12:01] he's brought to my attention
[1:12:05] that this flesh
[1:12:08] loves to blame everything and everybody
[1:12:15] likes to make excuses
[1:12:17] excuse us
[1:12:20] and I he he showed me he told me
[1:12:27] I need to start looking at myself it is
[1:12:33] and really really studying myself
[1:12:39] my behaviors
[1:12:44] would I start thinking for whatever
[1:12:47] reason the
[1:12:50] [Music]
[1:12:52] my reaction to somebody when somebody
[1:12:54] does something wrong to me
[1:13:01] and and I've really took in a really
[1:13:04] good look at those things and and it's
[1:13:05] going to be different for all of us
[1:13:10] how many know that God knows why you
[1:13:15] have the nature you have
[1:13:20] he knows
[1:13:22] how many of you want to know what he
[1:13:24] knows
[1:13:28] amen because once we once we know that
[1:13:32] then we're able to conquer this flesh is
[1:13:38] this place just loves to be it loves to
[1:13:42] be in this world
[1:13:46] I mean it doesn't want to leave
[1:13:52] and there's a reason why he loves it
[1:13:57] we know during the fall that
[1:14:01] the flesh was cursedita
[1:14:05] and
[1:14:09] everything in this world I mean every
[1:14:12] day I don't care how long
[1:14:15] you've been reading your Bible
[1:14:19] hearing the messages
[1:14:24] I've heard it from people that have been
[1:14:25] in church all their lives
[1:14:29] it's not just
[1:14:34] but
[1:14:35] every day you think you're getting over
[1:14:39] something
[1:14:42] and he let your guard down
[1:14:45] and then you walk by something that's so
[1:14:47] tempting
[1:14:51] and you stop and you're like
[1:14:55] it looks pretty tempting
[1:14:59] now Brother Jimmy's the man uh nobody
[1:15:03] but he could be a tablet
[1:15:06] he could be something that we're not
[1:15:09] supposed to be watching yeah
[1:15:14] he could be a little thought of Revenge
[1:15:22] not that brother Jimmy is that yeah
[1:15:27] but
[1:15:28] you know these these things is
[1:15:31] caused me to really
[1:15:34] check myself
[1:15:38] and one of the biggest things
[1:15:41] that he brought to my attention
[1:15:46] and he he kept saying it do you trust me
[1:15:51] um
[1:15:59] do you trust me confused with me
[1:16:03] and every time I would answer yes and
[1:16:05] this went on for days
[1:16:12] and then finally
[1:16:14] he gave me the Revelation revelation
[1:16:19] about
[1:16:20] maybe getting offended at everything and
[1:16:22] everybody else
[1:16:28] because like the scripture says that we
[1:16:31] just read
[1:16:34] what business do we have paying
[1:16:36] attention to anything else for him
[1:16:42] but instead he tells us to do something
[1:16:50] and then let's say he tells brother
[1:16:52] Jimmy to yeah
[1:16:54] to put on a green sweater
[1:16:58] um
[1:17:01] maybe maybe uh
[1:17:04] nothing bad another model but maybe
[1:17:07] maybe his maybe his wife says Nah
[1:17:10] put that blue one
[1:17:14] that's just an example
[1:17:16] but he was he was showing me this and
[1:17:23] he said he's telling me he listened to
[1:17:26] everything that
[1:17:28] that isn't of me
[1:17:33] it was It was kind of rough because yeah
[1:17:39] you know I just want to serve you I love
[1:17:41] you
[1:17:43] I just asked to be focused on you all
[1:17:45] day long
[1:17:48] yeah my heart was in the right place
[1:17:53] but instead of paying attention just to
[1:17:56] him
[1:17:58] I start to worry about my feelings
[1:18:03] I start to worry about this or that is
[1:18:15] don't you trust me
[1:18:20] and so I had to get it right
[1:18:23] how to say yeah I do trust you
[1:18:28] and as ridiculous or as outlandish as
[1:18:33] some things might seem for me to do
[1:18:35] foreign
[1:18:41] I do them now
[1:18:43] and you know what I have no regret you
[1:18:47] know things
[1:18:49] because he I've learned to just submit
[1:18:53] myself surrender myself
[1:18:59] and and every day it's it's it's you're
[1:19:01] living you're dying is
[1:19:05] like I said I don't care how long you've
[1:19:07] been listening messages or no important
[1:19:12] I mean every day you just gotta submit
[1:19:15] yourself
[1:19:16] and you got to watch every step that
[1:19:18] you're making
[1:19:23] but um pero
[1:19:28] there was a
[1:19:30] there was a couple
[1:19:40] so one of one of the other biggest
[1:19:43] things you know when the day that I that
[1:19:46] he called me out
[1:19:50] I was in the back of a cop car yes
[1:19:56] he showed me who he was
[1:20:00] I kept my word
[1:20:03] I didn't know how to serve them and I
[1:20:05] served them for the rest of I told him
[1:20:07] I'll serve you for the rest of my life
[1:20:13] and
[1:20:16] yeah just show me that your room
[1:20:20] and he did
[1:20:22] and you know like for all of us as that
[1:20:24] starts to go yeah
[1:20:28] and that start that process starts to
[1:20:30] happen yes
[1:20:32] there's the enemy
[1:20:38] is
[1:20:41] foreign
[1:20:45] and
[1:20:46] and I've I've come to I've come to

[1:20:54] enemy tries to bring those things up you
[1:20:55] know foreign
[1:21:08] that was
[1:21:10] that was this flesh that was this world
[1:21:14] and when he called me out by my real
[1:21:17] name
[1:21:19] and he brought the real me out
[1:21:25] there's no need for me to get
[1:21:27] discouraged about those things
[1:21:32] but amen I am in God bless you
[1:21:36] [Applause]

[1:21:51] then I tell you

[1:28:01] [Music]
[1:28:05] we love
[1:28:09] Angels before
[1:28:23] noches good evening
[1:28:26] you may be seated brethren
[1:28:29] uh
[1:28:33] the the theme is the day that I died but
[1:28:37] uh
[1:28:39] foreign
[1:28:55] it was based on the decision
[1:29:01] because when we are born in this world
[1:29:08] we will have a lot of opportunities
[1:29:14] in in the meantime the way you grow is
[1:29:20] and your life starts exploring things
[1:29:26] then you start to find out that you are
[1:29:29] a sinner
[1:29:34] and you come to the time that you have
[1:29:36] to make a decision
[1:29:38] you're going to continue to sin or not
[1:29:43] that's your decision
[1:29:46] I'm going to read something that the
[1:29:49] prophet of God read said here
[1:29:53] and it's in the the message of
[1:29:56] Revelation
[1:29:59] is
[1:30:03] I I brought my guitar up because I'm
[1:30:06] going to sing a song after I finish
[1:30:13] starting to play the guitar well I
[1:30:15] started liking it
[1:30:21] but everything is to the honor and glory
[1:30:23] of the Lord Jesus
[1:30:26] the prophet of God says disabian says
[1:30:29] look here
[1:30:31] notice Ruth Ruth
[1:30:34] deciding
[1:30:37] she had to decide whether she was going
[1:30:40] to go or not go uh
[1:30:45] I believe this week when the services
[1:30:48] started boy
[1:30:52] honorable you automatically thought I'm
[1:30:55] going to go or I'm not going to go
[1:30:58] and so you had to make a decision
[1:31:03] and then I said every day I'm gonna
[1:31:06] dress beautifully look nice
[1:31:11] as the time that they gave us the
[1:31:13] program because
[1:31:17] those are things that just you see it
[1:31:20] once a year
[1:31:21] and we should we should take advantage
[1:31:24] of it the maximum Advantage
[1:31:28] she had to decide whether she was going
[1:31:31] to go or not
[1:31:35] and that's what every believer has to do
[1:31:42] you have to leave everything of the past
[1:31:48] everything
[1:31:50] told us everything
[1:31:54] if you're not willing to leave
[1:31:57] everything in the past
[1:32:23] and that's what would happen with me
[1:32:36] but your conscience will not lie to you
[1:32:40] she will tell you
[1:32:43] you still have not died
[1:32:46] you you yourself
[1:32:50] don't wait for the preacher to tell us
[1:32:53] about me you know
[1:32:55] if you're dead or alive
[1:32:58] the prophet of God says
[1:33:03] one has to leave all the things of the
[1:33:06] pastas
[1:33:08] leave all the things of the previous
[1:33:10] life
[1:33:12] and live all of the world yes
[1:33:15] and that's not that's what I did not
[1:33:18] want to do
[1:33:20] because while you are attending church
[1:33:23] you read your Bible you sing
[1:33:31] of the things of the life in the past
[1:33:36] then you become a formal Christian
[1:33:41] and you think you're you're believing
[1:33:45] that you are fulfilling a requirement
[1:33:47] and everything's all right
[1:33:54] you have to leave the places of the
[1:33:57] previous life
[1:33:59] to cross into a new land
[1:34:04] it's difficult because
[1:34:08] I say it on my behalf okay
[1:34:13] I love soccer football
[1:34:16] Irma
[1:34:18] oh brother
[1:34:20] I couldn't even see a ball
[1:34:25] a soccer ball and they never I was at
[1:34:30] intenses
[1:34:32] when you find yourself in that condition
[1:34:35] to oh you're us a
[1:34:42] um
[1:34:46] I I would even go to the Billiards yes
[1:34:50] and and that was agreeable I loved it
[1:34:55] but me in my mind I knew
[1:34:58] that I had to leave that alone
[1:35:01] that's fussy it's not easy
[1:35:06] the prophet of God just says to leave
[1:35:09] the things of the other life previous
[1:35:11] life
[1:35:14] and to cross over into a new land
[1:35:18] yes
[1:35:19] and that's what one does not want to do
[1:35:22] because one does not know
[1:35:26] who you'll find yourself with
[1:35:33] because when I took the decision to
[1:35:35] the United States
[1:35:38] I said I
[1:35:43] don't want to go
[1:35:46] but when you make a decision
[1:35:50] under the inspiration of God
[1:35:55] that should produce fruit in your life
[1:36:03] that one has never known
[1:36:06] foreign
[1:36:08] the way you became when you became a
[1:36:11] Christian
[1:36:12] you left the Billiards cuentos how many
[1:36:17] know what a billiard is
[1:36:21] you assisted it didn't you oh
[1:36:26] yeah
[1:36:27] I I hope that you still
[1:36:33] and the nightclubs
[1:36:36] I I never went to those
[1:36:44] you have to get to with the people that
[1:36:46] it looked like they suffered with
[1:36:48] attacks
[1:36:52] because brother this is a new life
[1:36:56] this is a different life
[1:37:00] because they would shake and they would
[1:37:03] cry
[1:37:04] they would shake their head
[1:37:08] and they would jump
[1:37:11] and for you they look like they were
[1:37:13] crazy
[1:37:16] but you had to make a decision
[1:37:19] if you were going to go or not correctly
[1:37:24] again
[1:37:26] you knew when you were going to make
[1:37:29] that step that your own people would
[1:37:31] make fun of you
[1:37:32] that you left behind
[1:37:38] automatically because
[1:37:39] things because those are
[1:37:43] because that's the case of it
[1:37:46] uh
[1:37:48] conclusion coming to that conclusion
[1:37:52] I made that decision
[1:37:57] you know that when you come to that
[1:37:59] corner
[1:38:02] because you have done one thing or the
[1:38:04] other
[1:38:05] you have sinned enough
[1:38:09] you feel
[1:38:11] Miserables and the only thing that you
[1:38:13] want to do is die because
[1:38:16] that's what the devil wants you to do
[1:38:20] but that's it there when you make that
[1:38:23] decision is
[1:38:27] that's not gonna obligate you
[1:38:30] this is
[1:38:32] waiting for you to make that decision
[1:38:34] okay
[1:38:38] I knew the Bible Prophet I had heard the
[1:38:42] prophet
[1:38:44] that's not enough
[1:38:47] because the prophet says
[1:38:51] that this message would not have any
[1:38:53] effect
[1:38:55] if there's no one to receive it
[1:39:07] it's the most difficult thing that you
[1:39:09] may do
[1:39:10] is
[1:39:13] that's when you have to surrender to God
[1:39:16] fully
[1:39:18] all your heart is
[1:39:23] you have to promise God
[1:39:28] for the rest of your life
[1:39:32] and that is something that will
[1:39:34] accompany you
[1:39:35] all your days
[1:39:41] that's why I've only read a man
[1:39:46] that about a man I read about a man that
[1:39:49] after he died
[1:39:52] [Music]
[1:39:54] that his Fame has now started this is
[1:39:59] that's our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:40:04] when he was here the whole world
[1:40:07] rejected him
[1:40:13] has been glorified
[1:40:17] because of that Grace I want to sing a
