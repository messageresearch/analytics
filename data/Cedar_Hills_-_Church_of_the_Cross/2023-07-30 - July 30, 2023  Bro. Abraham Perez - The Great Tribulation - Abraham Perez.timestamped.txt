[22:53] and see your smiling faces
[23:00] this is Sunday school is
[23:04] you know when I get back here
[23:08] you know uh I don't give you a message
[23:11] for you to jump in trouble don't get me
[23:14] wrong that's fine we need everything
[23:20] but it'll make you think
[23:24] amen amen so not to have you standing
[23:30] as you see the title of the message is
[23:33] the Great Tribulation
[23:38] and if you open your Bibles to
[23:40] Revelation 6 verse 12.
[23:48] I'd like to preach from revelation
[23:52] of the Apocalypse it's a book that very
[23:55] few minutes preachers get into is
[24:01] because it's a book that's very hard to
[24:04] understand
[24:07] but a couple of years ago
[24:12] a couple
[24:14] um
[24:17] being the pester were making tapes to
[24:20] Uganda
[24:22] and it was on the Book of Revelation yes
[24:27] and he would take a Chapter yes and I
[24:31] would take another chapter
[24:33] so when I got to chapter six
[24:37] I I we sent a message
[24:41] on uh
[24:42] the six seal in person
[24:47] and after that is
[24:53] I didn't even do justice to them
[24:58] so this morning we're gonna go a little
[25:01] deeper on it
[25:04] I will not I do not have the time to get
[25:07] to where I wanna get nothing else
[25:12] but I I want to keep it simple this
[25:16] morning
[25:19] and just put a foundation fundamental
[25:25] and I beheld when he had opened the
[25:28] sixth Hill and low there was a great
[25:30] earthquake and the sun became black as
[25:34] sackcloth uh
[25:36] and the moon became his blood says
[25:50] in the stars of Heaven fell into the
[25:53] Earth even it's a big peak casteth her
[25:56] untimely figs when she is shaken of A
[26:00] Mighty Wind is
[26:10] and the heaven departed as a scroll when
[26:14] it is rolled together in every mountain
[26:17] and Island were moved out of their
[26:20] places
[26:28] if the Lord had his Blessing to the
[26:30] arena the word you may be seated
[26:37] can you imagine
[26:40] how a guy from a little town of Hanover
[26:46] um
[26:54] how could someone of my stature
[27:00] can teach you people
[27:04] how the Sun became
[27:08] how the moon turned into blood
[27:12] how the Stars will fall from Heaven
[27:18] and how the heavens will roll like a
[27:22] scroll is
[27:26] there is no way I could do it
[27:30] but brothers
[27:33] that God will give you Revelation when
[27:36] that time
[27:42] it's hard to understand it's difficult
[27:46] in there but if you got the Lord on your
[27:48] side
[27:54] to the scripture that we just read
[27:59] ing
[28:01] yeah
[28:08] God bless you my friend and you won't go
[28:10] to our goal go together
[28:17] my brother Fabio and I will be here
[28:20] together when the Rapture comes pray for
[28:23] us
[28:26] so then on the scripture that I read
[28:30] something is wrong here
[28:34] look at the introduction middle
[28:37] introduction there's
[28:39] there's writers know why he net is
[28:48] the answer is
[28:52] what happened
[28:54] even when the fifth seal was open
[28:59] there was no
[29:02] Beastie saying come and see
[29:07] Revelation 6
[29:09] seven to eight apocalypse says
[29:28] and I look and behold the Pale Horse
[29:32] and his name the chair on him was death
[29:35] and Hell Followed With Him and power was
[29:39] given unto them over the fourth part of
[29:42] the earth to kill with the soul and with
[29:44] hunger and with death and with a beast
[29:47] of the earth is
[30:04] his name was
[30:06] name was
[30:07] so why would he the Beast going to the
[30:11] fifth ceiling says come and see foreign
[30:47] [Music]
[31:10] what if I tell you yes they will yes
[31:14] attention
[31:17] brother Brennan said
[31:20] they went through the pre-tribulation of
[31:23] Adolf Eichmann and Hitler
[31:26] tribulations
[31:30] there are two tribulations in a room
[31:36] this was a tribulation there for the
[31:39] Jews
[31:43] but Moses and Elijah are in charge of
[31:46] the other tribulations
[31:51] I don't think I'll have time to explain
[31:54] that but next time when Caleb gives him
[31:57] an opportunity I'll go a little deeper
[31:59] on them
[32:07] Revelation 4 5. apocalypse is
[32:17] Lightnings and thunderings and voices
[32:20] and there were seven Lambs lands of fire
[32:25] burning Before the Throne which are the
[32:27] seven spirits of God
[32:32] is yet
[32:38] adios
[32:42] and Before the Throne
[32:44] Throne sea of glass
[32:46] I turn to Crystal and in the midst of
[32:49] the throne and round above the throne
[32:51] were forbids full of eyes before and
[32:55] behind is
[33:07] in the old
[33:09] testamental Moses made what he saw in
[33:13] heaven
[33:15] then God commanded him to do
[33:19] he saw a sea of glass in heaven
[33:25] and do you know that the prophet Ezekiel
[33:28] Saw that Crystal over those living
[33:31] creatures
[33:37] Moses made okay says was a labor of
[33:43] Press On
[33:46] Roberto
[33:52] and he called it the Sea of breaths
[34:03] when you see press in the Bible says
[34:08] judgment significant with you so
[34:12] he put that that sea of breast just
[34:16] before the holy place
[34:21] it was for the sacrifice was
[34:31] and on that all
[34:33] oh
[34:36] they sacrificed
[34:39] was burned
[34:42] but in heaven
[34:45] the sea of glass Before the Throne
[34:51] so before the holy
[34:54] place down here
[34:58] the labor which was the Sia is
[35:04] for the sacrifices had to be burned
[35:08] sacrifices before
[35:12] we were received by God anti-scar and
[35:15] receives produce
[35:18] like I
[35:20] I've told you before let's say and I've
[35:23] told all these young ministers
[35:27] because brother Brandon placed a message
[35:31] bring bringing him out of History
[35:36] if we if I just read it like that
[35:42] this Bible
[35:45] is dead
[35:54] so
[35:56] if you don't have somebody to explain it
[36:00] or bring it bring it out of History
[36:04] if it wasn't for a propheta
[36:08] how could we get not only me I'm talking
[36:11] about all you ministers
[36:25] brother we we in other words to get and
[36:29] explain that I need Divine interventions
[36:35] thank God
[36:36] that when I needed the Lord comes on the
[36:39] scene in health message
[36:49] the sacrifices have to be burned
[36:55] before they are received
[37:00] what is he talking about here the guest
[37:04] it is talking about foolish virgins had
[37:08] to be
[37:11] abused
[37:15] they can be received by God
[37:19] because when Moses saw the labor in him
[37:28] and it was clear as Christians
[37:33] because the church already been redeemed
[37:37] like let's say yeah
[37:39] so later
[37:41] Revelation 15 1 apocalypse is
[37:48] and I saw another sign in heaven great
[37:52] and marvelous seven angels hearing the
[37:55] seven last plagues foreign
[38:36] and yeah
[38:41] and over the number of his names
[38:45] they were standing on the sea of glass
[38:49] having the hearts of God
[38:55] for eign
[38:58] who were they
[39:04] were they sing in the they sang the song
[39:08] of Moses the servant of God
[39:14] they were
[39:16] the police
[39:24] through the great tribulations
[39:28] they were clean
[39:31] so the Church of The Purge
[39:46] they were the sacrifice that had to be
[39:49] burned before God could receive them
[39:55] when John saw the labor the Sea of
[40:01] glasses you and I were were had already
[40:06] gone out from there and gone with the
[40:08] Lord
[40:12] amen amen
[40:18] the first labor was clearest
[40:24] crystals no more blood
[40:27] the church age was over
[40:32] the church was raptured
[40:36] but notice many tribulations sent as
[40:40] warnings
[40:46] in February of
[40:49] 2013 in February
[40:52] the world was astounded
[40:57] when not blazing me exploded over Russia
[41:02] exploitos sobre Russia
[41:07] estimated
[41:09] he said it was 55 feet wide estimate
[41:13] said
[41:16] weighing 10
[41:18] 000 tons
[41:27] traveling 44 000 miles per hour and
[41:34] the energy released as a meteor this
[41:38] integrated
[41:44] was 500 kilotons question
[41:51] around 30 times the size of the atomic
[41:55] bomb dropped Hiroshima versus
[42:07] their angel
[42:10] s
[42:14] personas and damage thousands of homes
[42:19] that was a warning by God to them
[42:25] and if it happened once
[42:28] it will happen again
[42:34] then there are tribulations that are
[42:37] brought by men
[42:41] remember when the
[42:44] water
[42:48] and as they
[42:50] say Jerusalem
[42:54] where is he
[42:57] Jews
[43:00] and when King
[43:02] Spirit how
[43:09] Ard is
[43:13] Heron was a wicked Maniac
[43:18] can you imagine what kind of man Herod
[43:22] was
[43:24] can anybody tell me how many wives he
[43:27] inherited
[43:33] nobody again
[43:36] he had 10 wives yes and why was he so
[43:41] wicked you know why Ruthie
[43:45] he killed nine of his wife
[43:52] he murdered nine of his wives
[43:57] esposa you think that's bad all to your
[44:00] suspensions nothing
[44:07] like I said there are tribulations
[44:10] brought by men
[44:13] he was paranoid
[44:19] if suspected the day that his wives were
[44:23] Unfaithful is
[44:27] knew that he was hated

[51:07] lot of dead trees
[51:15] we're living in a time where everything
[51:18] is is dying and on the character
[51:22] and wherever we look we see death
[51:30] and the people that don't die someone
[51:32] kills them
[51:34] and there's so much killings
[51:37] when I was a young man
[51:41] and we would get into fights with other
[51:44] other people
[51:46] it was Bare hand
[51:51] yes
[51:56] now they're all a bunch of cowards
[52:04] they would just have a knife
[52:09] foreign
[52:13] and

[53:07] same look
[53:08] Lucas
[53:11] 17 26 yes
[53:13] we want to escape
[53:16] because we know that something is fixing
[53:19] to happen
[53:24] as it was in the days of Noah so shall
[53:27] it be also in the days of the son of man
[53:29] come on
[53:37] they did it they drank they married wife
[53:40] they were given in marriage until the
[53:43] day is that no one entered into the ark
[53:45] and a whole lot came and destroyed the
[53:48] Moon is
[53:58] likewise also she was in the days of lot
[54:01] they did it they drank they bought they
[54:05] sold they planted they built it is
[54:16] but the same day that lot went out of
[54:19] Salam it rained for a year and bring
[54:21] Stone from heaven and destroyed the Moon
[54:37] Manifesto
[54:41] notice nothing I always wondered
[54:49] it says in the days
[54:53] and then right there and then in the
[54:56] days of life
[54:58] like he's repeating the same thing
[55:03] eating drinking
[55:06] and I was wondering why it was like that
[55:09] is
[55:23] it was only for the Gentiles
[55:28] so let's see what they were doing
[55:35] to eat and drink is
[55:52] they were eating foreign
[56:26] modernist
[56:29] beautiful microwaves micronas hermosos
[56:34] hardest they ever used
[56:39] and they like to eat out or every day
[56:47] that's all in the United States is
[56:53] oh my god I've passed through a lot of
[56:57] them
[57:02] I remember
[57:04] when I was just maybe about four or five
[57:07] years old
[57:09] my mother cooked enough
[57:12] [Music]
[57:15] can you imagine this Modern Woman
[57:18] cooking on a wood stove
[57:23] and the weather is 110 out there
[57:26] out there
[57:28] and The woman there by the side of a
[57:31] burning stove
[57:38] I thought there'd be a lot of
[57:41] divorces for
[57:42] eign
[57:46] no
[57:51] you're just living
[57:53] in the Golden Age
[57:57] isn't this the Golden Age
[58:03] you can almost
[58:04] all of you
[58:08] are
[58:13] from the wood
[58:16] they went into
[58:18] El petroleum yeah
[58:22] my brother and wife would deliver the
[58:25] petroleum
[58:27] to the houses
[58:37] with electricity in in uh what not
[58:42] electricity
[58:49] so it was perverted
[58:53] number two
[58:56] and they were drinking
[58:59] well you have to drink
[59:01] you drink water baby agua soda soda
[59:05] juices Google
[59:08] and they like to go to restaurants
[59:12] they drink beer
[59:15] whiskey whiskey cocktail alcohol
[59:22] it says they were marrying
[59:34] they lived together for 15 or 20 years
[59:42] I don't have to explain all this
[59:48] now I'm going to quote brother Brennan
[59:52] in the message
[1:00:03] now they marry for
[1:00:06] sexual it's the motivating factor now
[1:00:15] can you imagine Carlos if he said that
[1:00:17] about 60 years ago
[1:00:30] there has never been a time in history
[1:00:39] when me and my wife
[1:00:42] we move
[1:00:44] from Hanover to Las Cruces in 2008.
[1:00:52] and they took us
[1:00:55] uh
[1:01:03] Kensington are you in Kensington
[1:01:09] are next door to us
[1:01:13] you can correct me if I'm wrong
[1:01:20] so they were building the first two
[1:01:22] houses they're right yeah
[1:01:31] well I mean
[1:01:33] When I visit our the Collins
[1:01:37] Collins for Tommy Jr and
[1:01:42] Terry and Rachel
[1:01:46] and that's foreign
[1:02:09] brother random said
[1:02:11] the building is so great
[1:02:16] it is one of the signs of the end times
[1:02:22] days of Noah there were two groups there
[1:02:28] were the wicked that perished
[1:02:31] righteous who escaped
[1:02:34] but in the times
[1:02:38] there were three groups
[1:02:41] that dwellers
[1:02:44] Lord and his family in Sodoma
[1:02:49] number three
[1:02:51] Abraham and his family Abraham is
[1:02:54] familiar let us look at the coming of
[1:02:57] Destruction
[1:03:00] and judgment as it came to in the days
[1:03:05] of Noah and lots of
[1:03:09] they are both time
[1:03:12] an example of the third destruction
[1:03:19] before God came to destroy the Earth by
[1:03:22] water and this is against
[1:03:40] and both rejected
[1:03:44] the message of in in nowhere
[1:03:53] and deliverance
[1:03:55] so when the Waters of judgment came
[1:04:01] it took the believer to safety yeah
[1:04:07] but the unbeliever to death and torment
[1:04:11] will increase
[1:04:16] but notice
[1:04:18] today it is the gospel message
[1:04:25] that will destroy the unbelievers
[1:04:30] and take the believer
[1:04:34] to the Realms of Glory Allah Gloria
[1:04:39] and we'll Rapture the sons of God
[1:04:45] judgments
[1:04:48] the same word
[1:04:51] that spoke this world into existence
[1:04:56] it'll be the same word
[1:04:59] will speak it out of existence
[1:05:05] the word says
[1:05:07] I can do nothing
[1:05:10] until you come here
[1:05:14] there is such a disturbance among the
[1:05:17] people
[1:05:21] the churches are so different
[1:05:25] and on each other's throat
[1:05:30] there are so many visions of this
[1:05:33] message
[1:05:36] and they they
[1:05:38] separate
[1:05:40] and many says we have the truth
[1:05:46] there is a
[1:05:49] spiritual upon the ministry
[1:05:55] they want to be leaders
[1:05:58] they want to be pastors
[1:06:06] that's why it says in Revelation foreign
[1:06:19] I love you
[1:06:24] I had a vision or a dream
[1:06:28] um
[1:06:30] and uh
[1:06:32] I remember in this
[1:06:35] Vision or dream
[1:06:38] there was a white church on the side of
[1:06:42] the road
[1:06:46] and the other side of the road there was
[1:06:49] us a warehouse or a storehouse
[1:06:56] and uh I went inside the church

[1:07:47] and he started going up the steps
[1:07:56] and I I stood there
[1:07:59] and way down at the end yeah
[1:08:04] I saw a little light

[1:08:38] real thing is

[1:08:55] and there was stairwell yeah yeah well
[1:08:59] it was lighted

[1:10:10] that he passed away
[1:10:17] we have never had a division
[1:10:20] the way we started

[1:10:32] hallelujah hallelujah there is no love
[1:10:35] no I am more they separate and the
[1:10:39] holiday there's hardly no love
[1:10:42] no Unity
[1:10:45] when these things brother random said
[1:10:50] again
[1:10:53] look up
[1:10:55] your Redemption draws nights
[1:10:59] before one drop of rain fell until
[1:11:06] I went away yeah
[1:11:09] some was destroyed
[1:11:12] but lot was out of Salamence
[1:11:16] my angel told him
[1:11:18] he didn't do nothing
[1:11:21] until you get out
[1:11:25] the angel said I have the lever get on
[1:11:30] my hand
[1:11:32] pull and make the fires fall from Heaven
[1:11:38] and the angel of Destruction
[1:11:44] holding the hand of Russia
[1:11:49] with the atomic bombs
[1:11:52] until the church comes together
[1:11:56] and get the church in order
[1:12:00] but I can do nothing
[1:12:04] until you you you and myself get in
[1:12:08] order you still stay Northern
[1:12:16] periods don't die the spiritus the same
[1:12:21] Spirits those mismos espiritus
[1:12:23] uncondemned persons
[1:12:28] that could never be said
[1:12:34] people right now
[1:12:38] ismo did Noah have free food
[1:12:44] the third pool of Noah
[1:12:50] was to the lost
[1:12:52] when the door was shut up
[1:12:57] so in the days
[1:13:02] was the righteous
[1:13:06] lot
[1:13:07] lot then he sent two Messengers
[1:13:12] that was the second pool
[1:13:15] but notice
[1:13:17] more and more Mercy was given to
[1:13:22] saturnicorius
[1:13:25] he said more and more Mercy have been
[1:13:29] given to us he must record
[1:13:33] the Raptor have already taken place
[1:13:38] says that we are living on borrowed time
[1:13:41] this is
[1:13:44] because God's rich in Mercy doesn't
[1:13:50] us or our children or grandchildren or
[1:13:54] relatives to get lost
[1:14:01] look at the third messenger middle
[1:14:05] on the third pool in the tanks of laws
[1:14:11] that third message
[1:14:14] one
[1:14:19] get people
[1:14:26] the Lord
[1:14:28] stayed outside because
[1:14:33] if I could find Fifth you spare sodoms
[1:14:41] um
[1:14:44] if I could find 40.
[1:14:49] I will spare some
[1:14:52] what if there is
[1:14:56] I would not destroy Sarah
[1:15:02] if you could even find
[1:15:07] yes I will not destroy Sarah no this is
[1:15:18] Las Cruces
[1:15:21] I was written on the paper
[1:15:25] this woman from England
[1:15:32] you say you hear in England about 90 of
[1:15:34] the people none of them go to church
[1:15:40] who cares now to go to church
[1:15:45] and a lot of them just go because it
[1:15:47] it's a routine or a custom yeah
[1:15:53] but to us he says shown Mercy
[1:15:56] system
[1:15:58] if I could find 10 I would not destroy
[1:16:02] sarms
[1:16:09] do you know
[1:16:15] that the Rapture has not happened
[1:16:20] remember the righteous
[1:16:24] because of you
[1:16:27] even if in this congregation
[1:16:32] there was only one righteous persona
[1:16:38] foreign
[1:16:46] in do you know that it might be your
[1:16:49] righteous life is
[1:16:55] thus says William Brennan I see this is
[1:17:07] direct to Revelation 6 12. the regresso
[1:17:10] apocalypse says
[1:17:15] and this hair so much is
[1:17:19] I won't have the time to explain nothing
[1:17:23] else
[1:17:24] but let me read it again
[1:17:28] and I'd be held when he had opened the
[1:17:30] sixth Hill and Lord there was a great
[1:17:33] earthquake and the sun became black a
[1:17:36] sackcloth
[1:17:38] of here and the moon became his blood
[1:17:40] yes
[1:17:56] is her timely fixed when she is shaking
[1:17:59] of a mighty winds is
[1:18:18] Heaven departed as a scroll when it is
[1:18:31] can you imagine see mahina
[1:18:36] this is the heaven
[1:18:40] and the heaven this is the heaven is
[1:18:43] the Bible says
[1:19:00] follow me here
[1:19:03] this these things are hard to understand
[1:19:05] this then difficult in there
[1:19:10] and the heaven departed as a scroll yes
[1:19:20] Genesis 1 6 and this is
[1:19:25] and God said let
[1:19:27] there be a fair moment in the midst of
[1:19:30] the waters and he divided the waters
[1:19:32] from the world is
[1:19:40] well
[1:19:42] what
[1:19:43] others
[1:19:47] Andrea what is Waters in the in the
[1:19:51] spiritual in domestic respiratory
[1:19:57] the people right yeah
[1:20:01] so I mean and we're supposed to be a
[1:20:04] separated people
[1:20:06] said are we supposed to have our own
[1:20:10] films
[1:20:17] you don't go to the dances or two bars
[1:20:20] or none of that
[1:20:23] we are a separated people
[1:20:27] because we went through the
[1:20:30] Truth
[1:20:32] where is the Jews still have to pass
[1:20:35] through there
[1:20:41] and they already have heifer
[1:20:46] with a red heifer they have to burn us
[1:20:50] and make the edges
[1:21:00] repented and got baptized in the
[1:21:03] precious name of the Lord Jesus
[1:21:08] Christ let's go to the beginning
[1:21:35] if we see
[1:21:37] and God called The Pyramid heaven and in
[1:21:40] it for the evening in the morning was
[1:21:43] the second day
[1:21:45] expansion Cielos Segundo
[1:21:51] remember
[1:21:52] the heavens will be Los Cielos
[1:22:03] God made three Bibles
[1:22:07] one in the heaven
[1:22:12] and one on paper
[1:22:14] [Music]
[1:22:15] but do you know with all three of them
[1:22:20] you know what they have done with those
[1:22:23] three Bibles yeah
[1:22:25] they have made
[1:22:27] Ouija boards voltry and it's all we have
[1:22:31] the the last
[1:22:32] threats
[1:22:37] has gone the three Bibles yes oh then
[1:22:42] you go to astrology
[1:22:49] oh let's go to the pyramid
[1:22:52] and look at the number of the stones
[1:22:59] and the way
[1:23:01] use
[1:23:04] understand the Holy Ghost the Bible to
[1:23:09] you
[1:23:10] Jesus
[1:23:27] how many Heavens are there
[1:23:34] how many have cuantos Cielos
[1:23:41] he had a
[1:23:43] firmamento so he said let there be light
[1:23:49] and when he said that
[1:23:52] the sun came into existence
[1:23:57] and Isaiah 40 22 is
[1:24:05] it is he that seeketh upon the circle of
[1:24:08] the Earth in thy inhabitants thereof are
[1:24:11] his grasshoppers that stretches out the
[1:24:15] heavens as a curtain and spread them out
[1:24:19] as a tend to dwelling
[1:24:21] is
[1:24:43] Los Cielos
[1:24:49] no
[1:24:50] no
[1:24:56] why is he stretching the heavens
[1:25:01] Psalms Uno
[1:25:06] the heavens declare the glory of God
[1:25:10] Manos
[1:25:20] to declare the glory of God
[1:25:26] Who is the
[1:25:28] history
[1:25:34] for the Gloria
[1:25:36] but I'd like Gloria videos
[1:25:57] and I can see a peace break from the Sun
[1:26:07] a false a few million years
[1:26:13] and he stops it
[1:26:20] is
[1:26:35] I remember years ago
[1:26:41] I know brother Fabio remembers yes
[1:26:49] I'm brother Bernie said
[1:26:55] he was playing with marbles
[1:27:00] it would it was like if you were playing
[1:27:03] with marbles
[1:27:06] is
[1:27:09] in that peace of the Sun
[1:27:12] like a mirror
[1:27:14] and then he would stop it
[1:27:16] and then get another one and then he
[1:27:20] would stop us
[1:27:21] what was he doing
[1:27:24] he was
[1:27:27] this blame the glory of God yes
[1:27:35] he was riding the first Bible is
[1:27:41] in the first constellation
[1:27:46] it was a
[1:27:49] dog
[1:27:52] he made it in heaven
[1:27:56] because human beings
[1:27:59] once look after the heavens
[1:28:03] and when he finished the heavens
[1:28:08] when he finished the heavens
[1:28:11] and rode his first Bible yes
[1:28:16] then he displayed
[1:28:24] who is a glorious
[1:28:27] videos
[1:28:37] all if you give light just loose you are
[1:28:42] one of those stars
[1:28:44] and one of those Stars
[1:28:53] it has your name cause you are children
[1:28:56] of the light
[1:28:58] without fear moment was separated from
[1:29:01] the waters from the people that are
[1:29:04] above the expansion
[1:29:10] that was a handy work that he was doing
[1:29:16] you know all the uh
[1:29:19] put him under Heavens
[1:29:22] is the heavens
[1:29:25] and one of those pieces from the Sun you
[1:29:28] know this is
[1:29:31] are you
[1:29:32] from the Sun whose dead is the soul
[1:29:35] you're a piece of the sun
[1:29:38] isn't he
[1:29:40] Our Father
[1:29:42] we are his sons and daughters
[1:29:46] okay okay crazy
[1:29:49] yes for you
[1:29:52] and you were coming even yes and says
[1:29:55] that's enough you stop right there yeah
[1:29:58] either the Twisters
[1:30:03] right there and that's what I heard your
[1:30:06] name is
[1:30:08] you know
[1:30:16] I don't know which star has your name
[1:30:21] with all our Father Abraham
[1:30:26] as
[1:30:27] if you can
[1:30:31] my notice as we turn the corner to
[1:30:35] finish here nothing
[1:30:42] you have light
[1:30:44] Isaiah 34 4. he said yesterday
[1:30:51] I could say much more but
[1:30:54] cut the time
[1:30:59] Isaiah 34 4
[1:31:02] and all the hosts of Heaven shall be
[1:31:05] dissolved and the heaven shall be rolled
[1:31:08] together as a scroll
[1:31:11] an older homes shall fall down as thou
[1:31:14] live follows from the vine and as a
[1:31:17] fallen free from the fig tree
[1:31:21] that is
[1:31:35] foreign
[1:31:55] he was writing his first Bible is
[1:32:01] he was writing his first Bible yesterday
[1:32:04] so he had to head to something hard to
[1:32:08] write yes
[1:32:10] you know like we do
[1:32:12] so it was
[1:32:22] second Peter 3.
[1:32:37] knowing this first that there shall come
[1:32:40] in the last days scoffers walking after
[1:32:42] their own laws is
[1:32:51] and say where is the problem is coming
[1:32:54] for since the fathers fell asleep all
[1:32:57] things continue as they were from the
[1:32:59] beginning of the creation
[1:33:02] it is
[1:33:13] for this they only are ignorant of the
[1:33:21] water and in the water
[1:33:24] is
[1:33:37] whereby the world that then was being
[1:33:41] overflowed with water perished
[1:33:48] but the heavens and the Earth which are
[1:33:50] now by the same word are kept in store
[1:33:54] reserved until fire against the day of
[1:33:57] judgment and Perdition of ungodly men
[1:34:11] so now we're going to find out why you
[1:34:14] rolled the heavens no
[1:34:22] unto the coming of the day of God or the
[1:34:25] heavens being on fire shall be dissolved
[1:34:28] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[1:34:32] heat is
[1:34:45] nevertheless here we go
[1:34:48] we according to his promise
[1:34:51] look for a new Heaven in a new world
[1:34:55] that is what he wrote
[1:34:58] the old Heaven Nosotros is
[1:35:08] righteousness
[1:35:11] you know why he did
[1:35:22] of this first Bible
[1:35:27] the constellation of Leo the Lion
[1:35:31] constellations
[1:35:34] and it is Judgment yes
[1:35:37] because brother random says
[1:35:40] to do that
[1:35:43] because we're living in what age are we
[1:35:46] living
[1:35:49] we're living in the age of cancer
[1:35:55] that's why those Heavens have to be
[1:35:57] rolling foreign
