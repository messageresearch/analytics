[30:32] inspiration came from
[30:37] Brothers up there give me the first
[30:39] picture with brother Daniel 11.
[30:42] Daniel Evans
[30:45] many of us had the honor and the
[30:46] privilege to visit Tucson Tabernacle
[30:49] back on August 26th right yes and the
[30:51] 27th
[30:52] Tucson Tabernacle and Augusto
[30:56] brother looks pretty good on camera
[31:02] in in camera we were there that Saturday
[31:05] night

[31:14] there are two things I want you to see
[31:16] in this picture
[31:20] the Hat the cowboy hat El Sombrero okay
[31:22] you already probably already know whose
[31:24] it is right this is
[31:27] and then right behind us is
[31:32] brother Brennan preached there twice in
[31:34] 1961.
[31:37] brother knows
[31:43] thank God
[31:46] two messages that more than likely he
[31:49] preached in Tucson in 1961 there's only
[31:52] two okay
[31:56] expectation uh expectativa
[32:00] Jesus Christ the same hey Jesus Christ
[32:06] that's Saturday night
[32:09] this is where the inspiration comes from
[32:11] okay
[32:12] we'll try to set a little foundation for
[32:14] you here
[32:15] fundamentals okay
[32:19] then once we set that Foundation these
[32:22] pictures we'll read the scriptura
[32:28] next picture please
[32:33] that's the top of the Hat this is
[32:35] sombrero
[32:37] the prophet of the age
[32:40] that man is is
[32:48] when brother Daniel Evans showed it to
[32:50] us Daniel Evans
[32:53] he's a brother sombrero
[33:07] the prophet of the age
[33:15] next one please
[33:21] I flipped it over
[33:24] I flipped it over because I wanted to
[33:26] see the inside interior
[33:32] and all around the inside
[33:36] was a bright yellow Ringo
[33:44] where do you think it came from
[33:51] I was like
[33:52] holding the Hat in my hand is
[34:02] in all poor widow
[34:07] um
[34:11] melodio
[34:14] because I have nothing else to give
[34:16] because
[34:19] those were her two mites
[34:24] that's all she had to give era
[34:27] and she gave it to the servant to the
[34:30] Lord Brother Daniel is
[34:32] Daniel Evans and I was as I was holding
[34:36] that head he started to touch the inside
[34:38] is
[34:44] then the scripture came to mind
[34:47] Genesis 3 19
[34:57] you will eat the bread
[35:01] pan
[35:02] thank you brother
[35:04] now if you'll please stand
[35:08] to three portions of scripture
[35:14] Genesis 3 19 the one we just mentioned
[35:23] the next one will be Luke chapter 22
[35:26] verse 44.
[35:31] and the second
[35:33] is
[35:38] that told myself right at the time
[35:54] Genesis chapter 3 verse 19 Luke 22 44 we
[35:57] will also visit
[35:59] the letter that Paul wrote to the
[36:01] Corinthians the first letter the book of
[36:02] Corinthians chapter 15 verse 45 and 47
[36:05] in Genesis
[36:18] 319 reads in this manner
[36:24] in the sweat of thy face
[36:29] shall thou eat bread
[36:35] till thou return unto the ground
[36:40] for out of it was thou takenado
[36:47] for thus thou
[36:50] artes and unto dust Thou shalt returns
[37:02] Luke chapter 22 verse 44.
[37:14] when you have it you can say Amen please
[37:23] and being in agony
[37:26] a
[37:28] now we find Jesus Christ
[37:30] in prayer
[37:33] and being in agony is
[37:36] he prayed more earnestly
[37:41] and his sweat is
[37:45] as if they were great drops of blood
[37:49] falling down
[37:51] foreign
[38:00] First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 45
[38:03] through 47. versus
[38:10] the Apostle Paul writing to the
[38:12] Corinthians
[38:21] it is sown a natural body
[38:26] it is raised
[38:28] 45 I'm sorry I started 44 45.
[38:33] and so it is written
[38:37] the first man Adam
[38:41] was made a living soul
[38:46] the last Adam
[38:49] was made a quickening spirit a spirit
[38:55] hobit that was not first
[38:59] which is spiritual muscles
[39:03] but that which is natural
[39:07] and afterward that which is spiritual
[39:11] respirator 47
[39:14] the first man is of this
[39:19] Earthly
[39:21] the second man El Segundo hombre is the
[39:25] Lord is
[39:34] thank you for your reverence
[39:39] do the word of God
[39:43] so this inspiration and this thought
[39:46] that I want to share with you tonight
[39:47] comes from that experience that we had
[39:49] in Tucson is
[40:00] and many of you may already know
[40:05] other of you may not know
[40:09] I love his
[40:11] story I love history

[40:38] I'll tell you is that okay
[40:40] it turned 247 years old
[40:45] you say you get it no close
[40:50] good job
[40:55] part of our history
[40:59] our country nuestro pace
[41:03] was built on the sweat tears and blood
[41:06] with many men
[41:14] many other countries as well
[41:17] let's talk about the United States
[41:32] there are a few men that are given the
[41:35] credit for building this country is
[41:43] Andrew Carnegie Senor Andrew Carnegie JD
[41:47] Rockefeller uh JD Rockefeller JP Morgan
[41:52] JP Morgan
[41:54] Cornelius Vanderbilt Cornelius
[41:57] Vanderbilt
[41:58] Henry Ford Henry Ford that's why a lot
[42:01] of brothers in here like pork he says
[42:03] foreign
[42:07] they're giving credit for building this
[42:10] country
[42:12] they invested their money they took a
[42:15] risk versus
[42:23] they worked and they gave their life
[42:28] lied us for a kingdom that one day
[42:31] will perisher
[42:34] because Christ is going to return
[42:37] and he will set his feet on the Mount of
[42:40] Olives
[42:42] his kingdom
[42:46] I'm trying to get us to think here a
[42:48] little bit
[42:51] how men strive in this world
[42:57] to obtain so many possessions right
[43:00] brother Henry what about that on
[43:02] Wednesdays
[43:03] about possessions
[43:09] but our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ

[43:16] or chapter 18 verse 36 years
[43:23] with verse 36
[43:26] my kingdom is not
[43:28] of this
[43:31] they wanted him to establish the kingdom
[43:34] when he walked through the streets of
[43:35] Jerusalem
