bible says in the book of saint john the first chapter in the first verse san juan capitol verso uno and uh we want to appreciate all the panelists that have that have voiced the word of god up here in this behind this desk what a fine job that that they were did with brother abe brother benjamin brother jimmy they should be illegal in all 50 states that's just such a tremendous word that that they gave us this is part number two uh uh on the three curtains and let's just go to our foundation scripture in understanding uh the the the three curtains that we went uh into the other day brother henry and and brother aaron de los tres cortinas they did such an outstanding job we had we had some some things that we that we could come and to maybe uh clarify it a little bit maybe bring it to a better understanding and knowing the scripture as it says in second peter 1 19. we have also a more sure word of prophecy as unto a light that shineth in a dark place to want to greet the the listening audience those that are are on the internet via internet god bless you may the words that are spoken tonight may they accomplish the purpose they were sent one of one of them is the iron curtain [Music] he's the one that started the ball rolling of taking down the iron curtain gentlemen it's uh i don't think it's by coincidence he passed away yesterday so in understanding all of these things is what we do is we're careful of that purple curtain because that one is the one that comes into into all the world and it's got its fingers and it's got his hands into every thing that there as we as we as we have the the brethren uh speak to us tonight i one of them is commerce the second one is religious religion and it winds up to being into satanic powers this is what you have is when you have a prophet yes that was moving things behind the scenes you can see the ship on top of the water sailing really well but very very it's not very often that you actually see the motor or the engine that is pushing this ship through the water likewise you're seeing all of these things that are happening in the world what it is it was just uh something that was let loose well what was behind and especially us that we know the the word of god especially those steps brother the the pro the the word of god tells us the footsteps are the r of the righteousness ordered of the lord so then we must know where we stand the beginning never forget is all right so last time we spoke the question was asked to us is this purple curtain as we see it really a bad thing and at first you might say well yeah it's linked to catholicism it's linked to rome catholicism but we know our adversary the devil el diablo he only imitates what god creates and we found out through a very good teaching through brother henry henry that purple's associated with with the holy things of christ he brought out the curtains in the tabernacle that's right yeah it had to do with adoption but you see satan gets a hold of it is and he perverts it so the next day i was thinking you know on this iron curtain i was thinking on communism ben santos and i was what really got me was the word communion and i began to think you know is communism really bad communism of course we know what it is now but in the beginning was it so so real quick let's go to the book of acts chapter two muy rapido si podemosira libro de los echos and it reads like this and they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and in the breaking of bread and in prayers and fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles and all that believed were together and had all things common and sold their possessions in good goods and parted them to all men as every man had need lost [Music] so i know in spanish it says had all things in common espanol but the way the scripture reads in english is had all things common now we're going to get to that in just a little bit vamos amen is only a revival of the devil communism you see pentecost had real communism everybody sold everything freely divided among them and that's russia que so the question was asked is communism really bad pregnant so i want to talk on these two words today if that'd be okay the first one is so what's so interesting about these two words is they both come from the same greek word ambassador palabra and it's coinonia quesa oh and what that word means it's the christian fellowship or body of believers it's an intimate spiritual communion and you see these words are so closely linked [Music] they share the same greek root word but where these two words and ideas start to separate as communism says what's yours is mine and i'll take it you know you can give one to the lord for that [Applause] say it again say it again so communism says what's yours is mine and i'll take it by force communism but true christian fellowship says what's mine is yours you know that's what's so special about our pastor is no matter who he meets he's so quick to just freely give them the word without limitations and that's why the scripture did not say in common [Laughter] this is so real quick 244 says and all that believed were together and had all things common established if that word in would have been used there it would have put limitation qualification qualification and circumstances and circumstances so what would have been in common between those believers but it wasn't so no fuel and so we see right here miramos aqui brother henry actually shared this with me yes communism is not the action communism it's the spirit behind that makes the difference between having all things common entrepreneur and all things in common so your limitation is going to be whatever you put your faith in limitation as we heard on sunday escuchamos domingo there's many man-made revivals that are now coming to their end you see so many people are you know they've been in churches for so long tanta gente and estado iglesias portanto tiempo and finding themselves empty is encuentran vasils looking for something more buscando and i stop and ask myself you know what would cause that is it maybe they were searching to have things in common come you know these man-made revivals come to their end and so brother branham says what what causes the revival to stop well he says history shows he says that a revival only lasts about three years and then an organization and then an organization is birthed after that illegal and god can no longer do anything with that revival but there is a true revival it is the bride's revival and it's up to you and i ask the question what is what are you feeding your revival fire you know and i just started to think you know the hottest burning wood there is is hickory pencil it's so thick and dense that it burns hot okay and it's no coincidence that hickory noise coincidence it's actually used in the old days to make a switch to spank the kids and i was thinking lord maybe that's what i need is a good old gospel spanking with some hickory pencils and then i'll throw it in my revival but that's just a little bit on is communism really that bad just a little preview for you go home and read the whole chapter of acts chapter 2. so the problem with communism there was the forced actions and what happened on the day of pentecost was not anything forced it was god that's why we don't believe that pentecost is a denomination it is an experience it's an experience and that's that that was awesome you know when you find out just those words and that now when we come to the understanding of why the message came in english because it's very it the word of god came to us so when the word of god comes last time you were we go into the iron curtain the bamboo curtain the purple and you find out that the the tent or the tabernacle of all these good good evening god bless you thank you i want to start this uh just before we continue uh i was very curious what you were saying i really liked that fellowship two fellas [Music] um what a great point um in continuing talking about this a continuous uh really the point is it's um just just to clear out just to clear the air because things gonna close and and the question might still be asked within the person we're taught as bible believers message believers really every teaching of the word goes to fear not because there is no virtue in fear whatsoever there is only power there's only virtue in faith and brother branham did not say fear the purple curtain of nordica said exactly don't fear communism but you fear catholicism catholicism so how we go from don't fear you're not to fear catholicism catholicism well i don't believe in contradictions in the in the bible or the message outside of that you'll find them all over the place but the perfect word of god there's no contradiction there's no contradiction in the message no contradiction in mensah it's the same word do we you know revere it what is there that we need to know because every time we talk about fear we go right away to the nation's going to go into war yeah people are going to come around and going to take our stuff they're going to kill us if we don't follow their ways so much like we recognize the land right we know that that there's only one lamp that has the ultimate power ultimately so so it's going to come in a way well it's not that's going to come you know i think it's already in so many areas because if we want to help ourselves all this that we're speaking of we need to bring it down to the individual communism communism we'll find it ourselves we find a lot of things influenced by the same spirit in the individual and the individuals in the family in the family in the church in the community and then he grows to the nation people yeah but then the little hunter got things to move within us got things to move within our homes nobody want to hear about that nothing we grows on to then we find the vatican in rome and all that right it's very easy to see it there so in this study in this studio how how it was represented in in curtains but not separating the sense of you know what i'm done with you you're that way i'm this way in the order of how god does things uh it separates it so as we as we were looking at last um last time there's something to do with purple catholic church they're so powerful they could pick any color yeah is considered one of the purples you know there's a there's a rosa is considered they have a layout of purple this is about 12 colors it goes from from light pink to yeah there was like the the the the art behind getting the color which was it was they had to harvest these shells the seashells and it was a very difficult and very tedious job so they had to get him out and beat him up and bowling and all this and it was it was it it requires so much to produce this color you have to go out and be in the water for hours to gather all these snails and then go through all that process and i don't have the the number but you have to get like a drug load of of snails or a little bit of product left it's so expensive that only high class people could afford it more than the color it was the process that's what defined only royalty yes there's more that we can say about this but the the concerning the purple curtain how this spirit took it from where his glory will descend and such order and such anointing and how they took that tomato [Music] and there's nothing in the world that exists that happens i don't care what movement it is it all starts in the scriptures and we know that already by the message that uh the devil just perverts he can't come up with something on his own you know that should be enough for somebody to say i cannot follow the devil he can't even come up with his own stuff he's not that smart hello and i would like to maybe pick it up in on this where we left last time how purple was used bosswork as he was commenting in service that after after a son he didn't know what his son was going to become we have children but we don't know what they're going to turn into they get their influences they go back and forth and unless you come to to find a point that if you got a trust that there is a seed in there and in the old times where brandon says that we don't know what they're going to come up with if we're going to be a gangster if he's going to be there's going to be that eva but he put he puts him under tutors and now this is the old times and antigua and and it would take it was about 40 years old correct brother caleb adoption was a person was about 40 years old in bible times a boy would have to show himself and it was about the age of 40 years old they were ready to be adopted that was when the father put a purple robe on the sun cuando el so we go back to what david said when he was he was wondering about the tempo what he wanted to do do a temple a house for the lord then he approaches the lord in psalms and i like to read this in solomons is bless the lord oh my soul oh my god thou are very great a garment como vestidura who stretches out the heavens like a curtain amen so the covering of the lord was to be a light it but then systems they just took the color and took the meaning of it and the anointing behind it we see that what david saw was actually an adoption in the in the event of a doc which is matthew 17 4 correct uh let's just read let's just read just today so we don't have to read a lot let's read 17 5. verses a bright cloud overshadow them behold a voice out of the cloud say this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hear ye him [Music] so i'm trying to see why brother branham said fear catholicism and the truth is those original communists communist the true catholicism that was the real thing that means universal catholic means universal catholic significant universal so so uh speaking of communism abroad what's so bad about it in our realms as as christians the same meanings that you gave us i mean what makes it bad that we look at the systems more than the word so we're more kind of forced into things legally and but diario so he wants to make us he wants to have us in circumstances when you bring them all together when we separate them wound up going one way with anti-god's spirit with the anti-christ you know you said something about those three powers one is commerce right which is the merchants of the earth the merchants of the earth started to grow [Music] that the catholic church started to expand with its doctrines worldwide because but principle but there were so many languages that was and at that time spain was very strong espana spain was super strong espana so they said yeah well spanish uh has to be the language because most most is ships the strength of of of uh ocean travel and freight and all this spain espana portugal portugal and then england so they say well spanish and they did it in the newfound world which was america is but there was a point that was very strong in in this merchants of the earth and that was peru yes and when they got this had this gathering and they said that means they brought the strongest richest man on earth and they voted for the one language that was to be the universal language of course we talk english we speak english because we live here but you have no clue what the lord had to do to make english a language are highly dominated by the catholic church so dominar so those little things that we don't value really much it's all in that two-two letter word all in that little it is it's amazing but for god to bring a prophet to this land look what he had to do to bring him in that condition catholic church or you know we don't want to call that name yet but we see him the scripture what he calls here and the merchants of the earth to an agreement to find a universal language universal and against everybody's expectations the fight came very close between english and spanish that vote will decide the language is [Music] you want to know why peru has been so miserably poor um the one vote that gave english the victory was was a spanish-speaking country and they suffered tremendously because they were a really a powerful country so we see all the stuff all the things that move us that we don't really appreciate for us to have a bible the way it is and the the little things so uh one one thing i wasn't gonna talk as much yeah that's all right correct right i like to maybe mention something on the you got it got it just closing this is the purple curtain is the let's go do that scripture real quick when you go when you go back to what brother henry said on do not fear hermano henry joseph the bible mentions that time one for every day of the year including let's go to the book of proverbs the last book i know we kind of mentioned it last verse chapter 31 verse 10. i hope you're enjoying this as much as i it says who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above ruby's rubies well that's where the fight comes on this catholicism a what did john see here camilo juan pues aqui 174 right capital apocalypse stones and pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication the catholic church took this that spirit it's a spiritual knowing that christ will come for one. and how to force people into their beliefs that catholic spirit is a spiritual catholic it's not only catholics i mean catholics believe so many things that kind of like christians but then they start changing it and say well christians don't believe like we do los cristinos so he started like we're all the same logo the catholic church and other christians believe this christian the ten commandments believe that god knows everything and has unlimited power it is they believe that jesus christ died for the sins of the world rose again and one day you and dia will come again in glory in gloria to judge the living and the dead the importance of worshiping god these are the fundamental beliefs of the catholic church is fundamental catholic they believe that the infallibility of the bible and then it starts changing labor communicating they believe in the real presence of christ you pronounce this eucharist the eucharist in the eucharist so now we're adding something to our estamos believe that god forgives mortal sins through the sacrament of reconciliation which is performed through a priest question and then they go this this is this all comes from catholic documents while most protestants do not believe in the sacrament sacramento catholics hope to the authority of scriptures and tradition which is the teaching of authority of the church which is which is the only believe in the bible alone see how they went against this that the infallibility infallibility of the bible that all that changed and he goes on to say you know like we read last time once again they have a better bible because they got 72 books but we still have 66. those liberals is and the catholics are defined as a visible society of baptized christians professing it started to tighten up as a forceful thing well they said that in 2012 there was 1.1 billion catholics worldwide but there is another aspect to this i got to aspect is as they go into what they believe there is a teaching of speaking you know catholics believe in praising and worshiping their their saints we only see catholicism as catholic catholicism but brother can you put these pictures up here if you have him the one to your right and it represents that you know the mother taking care of the sun she's the mother of jesus which is really the mother of god jesus christ and then we do appreciate the son but we do worship the mother more that is that elaborate mariology is these are the only two religions that practice that religion this one be the catholic church believe just as much because there's more converts from catholicism to the islam islam to any other religion and there's more christians that in in refusing to go to to to the catholic church they become muslims and the muslims have that they don't they don't take anybody i mean if you're not from their line you're not a muslim it was an exception but they did open up a department here you're welcome to join or believe but you're not really a muslim but we'll let you know on islam and that's where with a lot of the this communist terrorism sits that hybrid so it is a woman with virtue as far as power but it's not a virtuous woman who shall find her that the lord is looking at that's awesome this is this is where where you come into when he made the the the the connection between between catholicism and and islam the connection is this according to dr rivera which was an ex-jesuit priest and this is why we've said this before the jesuits met muhammad in a cave and the different things of that that are that are being that are taught within that religion that's why when you when you come and you see them in their fingers and their threads in every country who's the one that said the other day that that one of the best friends i i believe that that it was the last panel brother jim you said that the best friend of the of the pope was was oh god man of saudi arabia or anyway yeah they're buddy buddy so they're buddy buddies it's all it's all all of it together when you when you find this then then you you it's when when the prophet of god says it's not the people pueblo the system is the system this is this is the sim this is the simplicity of the same as when you go into the bamboo curtain of bamboo about a chinese bamboo tree uh bamboo takes five years to grow it has to be watered and fertilized in the ground where it had been planted every day it does not break ground for five years it will grow 90 feet 90 feet tall in five weeks what are we trying to say about this in 2015 bill gates goes to wuhan china bill gatesbach wuhan china and he says that in five years this second cinco a virus is going to hit up it's going to be a pandemic around the world what we what we understand through all of this it wasn't a virus of corona that was let loose it was a virus of fear that engulfed the world do not fear and spear was let loose and once fear and we we have we have bro brother diego that's a man of god that's the prophet that that sees that he's a fightful prophet that sees these visions he said in the vision that coronavirus was little el corona but it was accompanied what was being let loose they said this they said those that controlled and dominated the world a chaos we need your help necesita so that you will go into your country and break the economy of your country to re-establish establishment new financial order that's why the order was because once fear is established in the heart of the person this is what brings the confederation of churches when you see when brother branham talks about confederation of churches when you enter into the internet entra any league or union of people or bodies of people the term in modern political use politics is generally confined to a permanent union permanente this is why the united states of america was a confederation first of all confederacy federation with the ratification of the u.s constitution in 1788 federation allowing each member to govern themselves to work together common causes heresies sadducees body cells uh eradicate jesus christ when they form the confederation of churches but they hate you most of all stead musketeer 200 million archers in a natural standpoint against the trying to get to this the glory of god and we nosotros have come today we unite ourselves together come hell or high water bengali surrender no not [Applause] when you don't have a bamboo curtain experience an iron current experience is a pentecostal experience on
