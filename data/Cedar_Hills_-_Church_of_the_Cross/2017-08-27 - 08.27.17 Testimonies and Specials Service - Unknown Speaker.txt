Pennsylvania so it was a long road trip as actually to my niece's wedding I believe I was with this and I was with my sister Sharon and my sister Ruth so it was just you know either in a car and traveling to Pennsylvania and back and so that was I mean Matthew had stayed home and it was just a quick weekend trip up there and so we were in the car a lot so she was in my life a lot and so you know I guess that's when I first noticed it it was hidden at first like it just was two spots on the side of her head that were about the size of a quarter like one on each side and it was just odd in fact when I first realized that she was laying in my lap it was sleeping and I was just you know playing with her hair and rubbing her head and she ran I was in the backseat my sister Sharon was in the front seat and when I first noticed it it just took my breath away because I just knew that something was serious but Sharon just looked at me and said it's gonna be okay it's okay um because I don't know you already as a mom you know that there's issues going on and you wish that you could do something for them but when something like that happens like you just know exactly how serious like you just know there's something big going on and sharing asleep I mean I'll just remember her looking at me in the rearview mirror and saying it's gonna be okay like I just cuz it just took my breath away so much when I first saw that okay so I don't know you don't lose your hair for just anything that's called me when when they were on the trip on my on her way home called man said you know it's kind of well kind of a panicked voice and you know just telling me that she found two spots on her hair on her head and it was you know I was like wow what's what's going on Mackey and I had talked about taking her to the doctor and so I took her which is what we usually do is you know he's up on everything but I'm usually Glen who takes him to the doctor um and so they just told us you know she just basically told us what it was and sent us to a dermatologist she was kind of nonchalant about it which was shocking to me because to us that hair is an important thing and she was just like you know I have a couple patients with this and they wear wigs but at that point it didn't sink in at all oh you know how far it would go or how much it would actually take her hair the doctor prescribed a steroid cream of some sort I couldn't even tell you what it was exactly but you're Puss opposed to put it on every day and we did for a while but it really did what's it doing anything and we actually never went back to the dermatologist at all because he had basically said that there was nothing that he could do for it besides that cream he could give you that but other than that he didn't prescribe or do anything else well that was um the beginning of March and Mariah's hair like even in June we had her our church putana family camp and even then like it the spots on both sides of her head were just getting bigger and you know we just put a headband on or something at that point it was just a small Lakes headband or just to kind of cover up spots because they just seemed to grow and so that was June and we you know we just we were just believing that god that's gonna heal her then and like ever since even from the beginning when we first found found it in the doctor had told us what it was he we just believe that God said he would heal and that was what our faith was in and but at that point even in June it was just spots were getting larger probably in July and August even they were just getting bigger spots and more spots started showing up and for the most part like people around us couldn't even see that it was going on really unless they you know would ask or we would talk about it or something you really couldn't see you know she just wore headbands all the time to cover up the spots that were just getting larger I'm thinking like even September October it probably started getting a whole lot worse like from that day it just you know another spot would show up and then another spot would show up and then those spots would get they would come together and then the whole part of the head you know this side of the head was was totally gone and so they had to bring the hair and wrap it around the head just to cover up and then put a band on top you know one day you know they were getting ready for Sunday morning and this is when it hit me just because they were being there in the bathroom just in front of the mirror trying to do this do that pull this hair over that no that didn't work we got to do something different something we got to pull it from this side or wrap it and then it did it hit me real hard when I seen him just trying and it wasn't working there was nothing that they could do and that's when it really hit home that there's nothing more that we could do we have to buy a wig we have to get a hat there's let's when it hurt she actually started wearing a hat the beginning of December it was actually in it was Friday October she was we show at a local County Fair we go we have coats and they have do 4h projects and she was showing at a local County Fair and by that point it was really hard to cover up the bald spots on her head and I couldn't either braid her hair anymore and so that was really hard but at that point I was still I was so proud of her because she didn't let that hold her back from showing her goat or you know doing her 4-h project or anything it didn't she just carried on no matter what [Music] um at that point was the end of November I believe that we're at church and that particular time was just a hard time because her hair was getting really really thin and in fact probably that day or another Sunday around that time I was actually at home on Sunday morning trying to sew a bigger headband because it just any headband we could buy wasn't covering so probably the one that she had on that day was probably like a four inch headband that I could third that morning just in trying to find her something that she would be comfortable in and she just had enough maybe to put into a little ponytail at that point and it was just I don't know at that point it was it was getting pretty devastating to see how much of it was gone and so like that Sunday that we had come to church it was just a difficult Sunday you know I just remember sitting in the pew that day and crying because there was nothing I could do you come against something like that that there's nothing as a parent there's nothing that you can do you just do your best to support them and what they're going through and just know that you had to where to put your trust in your faith so I mean that was difficult but I just remember sitting there crying and Matthew was actually sitting with me that day and I don't know I was really thankful for him being there cuz I just couldn't stop crying that day and we had gone to church and as actually just during his for the Tim sermon that he was talking about I'm talking about hair and it's the glory of the woman he was talking about how you shouldn't cut your hair and you know he had spoken about that and his sermon and he had actually win that back Dale and after the sermon we were just in worship after the service and when the Lord just moved on him and he felt very inspired to pray for her letting now today I preach the word I preach them the Apostle Paul that hair is the glory of the woman and the devil has struck down one of our children come on now with an illness this robbing her of her hair calling man today and taking God at His Word if he made that for his glory then I God is greater than this day we'll bring that child down here [Applause] please [Applause] the [Applause] take your hands right now in the name of Jesus Christ I command you to leave this child for the glory of God and let her hair returned to give glory to the God of heaven to testify of the saving grace and the power of Almighty God in Jesus name Satan you have challenged the children of God and today the Holy Spirit accepts her challenge and said you gotta go now take your hands up [Applause] leave and see my glorify Jesus Christ in this Eve hallelujah won't you raise your hands and praise God hallelujah what you give him praise the smarter man he's not a God that we did by human hand no he's God and he's unchangeable he's unstoppable hallelujah there's nothing yet stop there's no stop the goal plot oh man take him at his word right now [Music] [Applause] [Music] on that Saturday night at the youth camp I was getting ready in the room right before service she had gone to get a seat and taking her Bible and stuff in and she came running back in and she's like I forgot my bobby pins she had heard stories about you know I'm brother branham's meetings where me and brought a pair of shoes when he was crippled um things like that she had heard those stories and but as far as telling her to take him I didn't tell her any of that and I had actually bought some new just pretty bobby pins at the store a couple weeks before and she stuck them into our hair stuff it's going to youth camp and said I might need these just leading up to youth camp you know that you know even at youth camps yeah very little hair she had a little spot on the side [Music] and that was it the rest of her head was bald you know so just going into youth camp and see University of the prayer line um you know with her with her little hair pins you know saying I'm gonna wear these [Music] I rest in your peace it's over [Applause] [Music] more ICU [Applause] [Music] [Applause] more [Applause] [Applause] I see [Music] [Applause] [Music] the more you know seeing God move and what he's done for her you know and that she is wearing those bobby pins those hair pins and it's just it's awesome to see how God has brought it you know from from youth camp to family camp to where we are today and the different prayer lines that was she was in you know just the each day has been a step you know has been an awesome experience it just seemed like that her hair just it just started growing I get it just like one day it was there and then all sudden it's kind of like the like a man has a bald spot or a bald head and it's real smooth no hair follicles and that's why it looked on most of her head and then all sudden it seemed like you know the head as far as the skin of her head it looked like it was putting in hair follicles because it would start getting those little dots everywhere and it's like wow something's about to happen because before is smooth and that's when it kind of just kind of gave you an idea that something was going on you know just the the feeling I'm just seeing it growing it was just amazing just to watch it cuz it just it wasn't like it coming over here and it was just like a in like a little flock if you see like those videos of the flower and how they going it's kind of like what it and you look back on it that's kind of like what it reminds me up is that you know a fast-forward video of a flower when it comes into full bloom you know just I talked to her about you know are you ready to take it off and chill brother on your hair just like I guess so you know so like even before you don't have to enter the service I'd walked out and then Mariah was in the Vacation Bible School and I walked out and I seen her there and then I seen brother on and brother Tim walking out the service and I was like that was a good time so I grabbed my ax take her over there and he's like let's see your hair baby doll and she just pulls our hair off her hat off and you know you know like brother Tim started crying you know different ones and was like I asked brother Tim was like is that the first time you've seen her hair he's like yeah this you know is just also feeling I'm just of just showing showing her hair you know to me it was just you know this is what I got you know it's like a trophy the Saturday night service you know just awesome the way brother on just started talking about the different healings and you had the feeling that he was gonna start talking about her as far as what he'd seen that morning seeing her hair you had the feeling that he was gonna call her up and so it was just uh you had a little bit of anxiety just seeing her you know stand up when he called her name and then call her up to the platform I had no idea that she would take her offering if he would ask her to take it off but you know when she walked up there and pulled it off you know automatically without no coaxing from from anyone and then she hasn't put it on since it was just it's been amazing to see it well you know without the Hat and the testimony that it shows that there's hair there morning as we walked out of the building we were reminded on only only months ago there's a little girl here they got a condition that she lost all of her hair and it began to come out in Bob's brother Tim had prayed for her in the meet in a meeting and in their local body felt led to pray for her then during a believed Easter camp there was a prayer line that took place all of her hair was gone and the doctor said that it would never come back it would never regrow and just in case that it would regrow it would be white or some off-color it wouldn't be not true this morning as we walked out of the building she came up to us with her daddy and she stood there and she took her hat off there's hair going on ahead that they said it would never happen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] more happiness that for me you know the world likes models come on up here baby done the rural
