[39:13] [Music]
[39:19] to this man who had holy bonds of
[39:22] natural
[39:52] thank you
[40:02] well guys
[40:04] here we are
[40:08] want to start off by saying how proud of
[40:11] you I am
[40:13] you
[40:15] girls you've grown up to be
[40:18] amazing young man
[40:21] I'm so very proud of you
[40:25] but I don't want to start crying so
[40:30] so
[40:31] you guys have reached this this stage of
[40:34] your relationship and
[40:36] here and
[40:38] getting ready to do
[40:40] the wedding vow
[40:42] arguably the most important part
[40:45] of this ceremony
[40:48] but
[40:49] the wedding vow
[40:51] is something that
[40:54] I don't think a lot of people really
[40:56] understand or pay a lot of attention too
[40:59] because it seems like something that you
[41:02] just repeat and is just done and it's
[41:05] just part of a ceremony and you go on
[41:07] with life
[41:10] but you see a wedding vow can be taken
[41:11] in two ways
[41:14] the first way that you can take a
[41:16] wedding vow
[41:17] is you can take a wedding vow as a
[41:20] contract
[41:22] and
[41:24] when you take a wedding vow as a
[41:25] contract
[41:27] it it brings a lot of things with it
[41:31] one of the one of the things that it
[41:32] brings is is a wedding vow taken as a
[41:35] contract
[41:37] falls under the law
[41:39] right
[41:41] and it brings with it something called
[41:44] an if then statement
[41:47] and a wedding vow taken as a contract
[41:50] with the if then statement says that
[41:53] if he does this then you'll do that
[41:57] or if she does that then you'll do this
[42:01] but that's not the way that God intended
[42:03] things to be
[42:05] a wedding vows should never be taken as
[42:07] a contract
[42:09] because that falls under the law
[42:12] a contract sets boundaries
[42:15] a contract sets terms and conditions
[42:18] and you never
[42:20] want a marriage and a wedding vow taken
[42:23] with terms and conditions
[42:26] that's not how God intended
[42:29] but the second way that you can take a
[42:32] wedding vow guys
[42:34] is as a covenant
[42:36] that's the way that God intended
[42:39] because a covenant is not based in the
[42:41] law
[42:43] the Covenant is between you and her
[42:46] two Souls two living people
[42:50] and you make a covenant
[42:52] and when you make that Covenant
[42:55] that Covenant is made under something
[42:57] different than the law
[42:59] it's made under love
[43:01] and it's made under grace
[43:04] and that Covenant that's why you find in
[43:07] the wedding vow until death do us part
[43:10] because a covenant is something that's
[43:12] made
[43:14] for Generations
[43:15] it's not something that's made for a
[43:17] period of time it's for a lifetime it's
[43:20] for an eternity covenants are made for
[43:22] long periods of time they're not made
[43:25] for short terms
[43:26] covenants don't set boundaries they
[43:29] don't do those things so how do you know
[43:32] what boundaries to respect to one
[43:34] another
[43:35] well it's simple
[43:37] when you enter into your marriage vows
[43:40] under a covenant
[43:42] love and grace
[43:44] take control of your relationship
[43:47] and you love her so much
[43:51] that you would never do anything to hurt
[43:52] her
[43:53] you love him so much that you would
[43:56] never want to do anything to hurt him
[43:58] so there's no need to put boundaries and
[44:01] terms and conditions on your marriage
[44:03] let the love of each other establish
[44:07] what is good and right in your household
[44:10] let that be your guiding force
[44:13] let that create your boundaries within
[44:15] your marriage
[44:16] always love each other
[44:19] always see each other through the eyes
[44:23] of Grace
[44:24] never lose that
[44:26] my dad I used to have a saying my saying
[44:29] I used to like to say was Lord willing
[44:32] and the creek don't rise
[44:34] and my dad used to always look at me and
[44:37] say oh
[44:38] it'll rise
[44:40] and that's true
[44:42] sometimes things happen life is not
[44:45] always the bed of roses
[44:47] sometimes they'll be hard times
[44:49] sometimes there'll be times you don't
[44:51] agree
[44:52] but if you remember that the value you
[44:55] gave was under a covenant and not a
[44:58] contract
[44:59] and you remember the love and the grace
[45:02] that binds you two together then no
[45:05] matter what happens no matter what comes
[45:09] you'll always be able to make it through
[45:13] together
[45:15] then there's a final part of The Vow
[45:18] and that's the bond
[45:19] that's the bond that's the thing that
[45:22] locks the two of you together
[45:24] and that's nothing more
[45:27] than almighty God
[45:30] because what he will join here today
[45:33] will be joined by him and through him
[45:38] and if you remember that it doesn't
[45:41] matter what this life will throw at you
[45:43] guys
[45:44] whatever happens in life come back to
[45:48] the thing that locks you two together
[45:50] which is the Holy Spirit
[45:53] come back to that thing that binds the
[45:57] two of you
[45:58] you've found Grace in her eyes
[46:01] she's found Grace in your eyes and
[46:03] together the holy spirit will bind the
[46:07] two of you
[46:08] and the Bible tells us what God has
[46:11] joined together
[46:12] let no man put asunder
[46:15] so no matter what happens in your life
[46:18] remember your covenant not your contract
[46:22] you're bound together and you're bound
[46:25] together by a force that is stronger
[46:27] than any that you could ever come across
[46:29] in this world and that is under the Holy
[46:31] Spirit
[46:32] and as long as you remember that and you
[46:35] come back to that
[46:37] you can face any challenge together and
[46:40] you will win
[46:43] so what I say to you guys
[46:45] is what God will join today
[46:49] let no man put us under
[46:51] God bless you
[46:54] [Applause]
[47:14] hello
[47:17] thank you
[47:20] you all look handsome you look handsome
[47:23] and you look beautiful
[47:25] you got the giggles
[47:29] very happy to be here and honored to be
[47:32] able to
[47:33] give the vows this afternoon
[47:37] I want to say before I start
[47:39] a man
[47:41] wrote one day
[47:44] in my journey
[47:45] through life
[47:47] I came across a wise man
[47:50] and I asked him this question
[47:54] what is more important
[47:57] to love
[47:59] or to be loved
[48:01] the wise man smiled and said
[48:04] which Wing is the most important for you
[48:07] to fly
[48:08] the left
[48:10] the right
[48:13] I think that speaks to all of us today
[48:16] one of the greatest things that you can
[48:18] ever find in your marriage
[48:20] the life of balance
[48:22] and it takes two wings
[48:25] to accomplish that
[48:27] so to love
[48:29] and to be loved
[48:30] brings quite a balance in a home
[48:33] you both have come today to join
[48:36] your hearts together
[48:39] you've opened your hearts one to another
[48:41] and now it's time to
[48:43] to let each other in
[48:45] and as you walk through
[48:47] our Prophet once told us
[48:50] we live in a three-room house
[48:52] and it doesn't matter how many more
[48:54] rooms that you have
[48:55] basically you live in those three rooms
[48:59] that is we are made up of a body
[49:02] spirit and a soul
[49:04] we want to type it to a house
[49:07] it's a kitchen
[49:09] a living room
[49:10] and a bedroom
[49:12] I want to tell both of you
[49:14] that one is just as important as the
[49:16] other
[49:17] the kitchen is where one eats in order
[49:21] to sustain life
[49:23] the living room is where you have
[49:25] Fellowship in order to help each other
[49:27] through life
[49:28] and the bedroom is where life is
[49:31] produced
[49:32] in order to keep those things always
[49:35] remember as I said one is just as
[49:38] important as the other
[49:43] keep this in mind
[49:45] that when you walk into each other's
[49:47] open heart
[49:48] into each other's home
[49:51] don't forget to take your shoes off
[49:54] because there are places in our hearts
[49:58] that are very sacred
[50:00] that teaches us to always respect each
[50:03] other
[50:04] because if there's no respect in a
[50:06] marriage then you do not have nothing
[50:08] you have no love
[50:10] there is nothing to live for
[50:12] but when you have the respect one for
[50:14] another
[50:15] as husband and wife
[50:17] it's because we realize and you all have
[50:19] realized that before your husband and
[50:21] wife
[50:22] you were Brothers and Sisters in Christ
[50:25] they'll respect each other at all times
[50:29] one of the greatest things you would
[50:30] ever have in your marriage
[50:33] so in these words I ask both of you to
[50:35] stand
[50:36] as we enter into the vows
[50:46] are you ready
[50:54] all right
[50:56] are all the witnesses ready
[50:59] yeah all right
[51:02] dearly beloved we are gathered here
[51:05] together in the sight of God
[51:08] and the face of this company
[51:11] to join together this man and this woman
[51:13] in holy matrimony
[51:16] which is commanded by Saint Paul to be
[51:18] honorable among all men
[51:20] it is therefore not by any to be entered
[51:23] into unadvisedly advisably or lightly
[51:27] reverently disgracefully
[51:30] soberly and in the fear of God
[51:33] and into this holy State these two
[51:35] persons present come to be joined
[51:38] if there's anyone here that can show it
[51:40] just cause why they should not be
[51:42] lawfully joined together
[51:44] this holy matrimony
[51:47] to speak now
[51:49] or from Hereafter forever
[51:51] hold your peace
[51:59] No Object
[52:02] I will require
[52:04] and will charge you both
[52:07] as you'll surely answer at the day of
[52:09] judgment when the secrets of All Hearts
[52:11] shall be disclosed
[52:12] that if there's either of you that know
[52:14] any impediment why you should not be
[52:17] lawfully joined together in this holy
[52:19] matrimony do you now confess it
[52:22] or be it assured unto you that any
[52:24] couples
[52:26] that are not joined otherwise than God's
[52:28] word doth allow their marriage is not
[52:32] lawful
[52:33] but duly believing you have considered
[52:35] this solemn obligation you're about to
[52:37] assume and that you have prepared to
[52:39] enter upon the same reverently
[52:43] discreetfully soberly and in the fear of
[52:46] God I shall propose to you the marriage
[52:49] covenant and you will witness the same
[52:51] as you join your right hands together
[53:02] right
[53:04] I forgot it
[53:16] Julian Hill
[53:18] will you have this woman to be your
[53:20] lawful wedded wife
[53:22] you live together in this holy state of
[53:24] matrimony
[53:25] do you promise to love
[53:27] and honor and cherish
[53:29] and support in sickness or health riches
[53:32] or poverty
[53:33] and will forsake all others as long as
[53:36] you both shall live
[53:37] I do
[53:39] oh I was you sure huh
[53:43] all right
[53:46] Elizabeth Gallegos
[53:48] will you have this man to be your lawful
[53:50] wedded husband
[53:51] to live together in this holy state of
[53:53] matrimony
[53:55] you promise to love honor and cherish
[53:59] and support in sickness
[54:01] or health riches or poverty and cleave
[54:05] thee only unto him as long as you both
[54:08] shall live
[54:09] I do
[54:11] he sounds pretty sure
[54:13] all right I think we're doing okay
[54:16] then I will require a token
[54:44] as we place these rings
[54:47] upon the immovable perfect word of God
[54:51] I'm going to ask each one of you to take
[54:53] the ring that corresponds to your spouse
[54:59] and will you rejoin your right hands
[55:03] go ahead
[55:21] Amen Let Us bow our heads
[55:24] almighty God the great creator of all
[55:27] things the author of everlasting life
[55:29] and The Giver of all good gifts
[55:31] and thou did see fit to give man a
[55:34] present you gave him a wife
[55:37] it is written that he that has found a
[55:39] wife has found a good thing
[55:41] as we stand this afternoon after many
[55:44] thousands of years our mind is brought
[55:47] back to the time that the the first
[55:49] ceremony was ever performed it was
[55:52] performed by you father in the Garden of
[55:53] Eden when you married our father and
[55:55] mother Adam and Eve and to this day man
[55:59] has taken him a wife
[56:01] father we pray that you will bless this
[56:03] young man and this young woman who has
[56:06] found love in their hearts one to the
[56:08] other
[56:09] and in this Reckless age that we are now
[56:11] living so many divorces breakups in
[56:14] homes may it not be with this couple
[56:17] may they remember this vow as long as
[56:20] they live
[56:21] May there be no powers to ever separate
[56:23] them
[56:24] I pray thee father as you did bless
[56:26] Isaac and Rebecca and made them ever
[56:30] happy in their lives and they were
[56:32] fruitful we pray that you do likewise to
[56:35] this young man and this young lady who
[56:38] have agreed upon this
[56:42] they've talked it over and with each
[56:44] other in secret and now it has come they
[56:46] have come to the church and the front of
[56:49] this company they offer their trough
[56:51] their loyalty their faithfulness to one
[56:53] another
[56:54] and has did and declared it in this
[56:56] public place now father by the power of
[56:59] my commission given me by almighty God
[57:01] to be his servant in this sacred office
[57:04] by this Authority I Now pronounce this
