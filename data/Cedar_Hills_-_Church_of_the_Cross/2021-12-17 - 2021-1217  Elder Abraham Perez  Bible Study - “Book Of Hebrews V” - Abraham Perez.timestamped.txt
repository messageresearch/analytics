[9:14] so lord we're together believing
[9:17] the same thing
[9:33] [Music]

[9:50] so lord
[9:52] i am asking you for your divine help

[11:12] 25
[11:34] so
[11:35] if you will open your bibles to hebrews
[11:38] chapter 3 verse 1.
[11:50] wherefore holy brethren partakers of the
[11:53] heavenly calling consider the apostle
[11:56] and high priest of our profession
[11:59] christ jesus
[12:01] participated
[12:10] my bible says confession and not
[12:12] profession
[12:16] which i think is more correct but his
[12:19] the high priest you confess to the
[12:21] priest equal correct is much called
[12:38] saying that then we have a great
[12:40] high priest that is passed into the
[12:43] heavens jesus the son of god let us hold
[12:46] first our confession
[13:01] that doesn't mean just to keep
[13:03] testifying
[13:18] don't profess a christian no professor
[13:22] christiano and leave something else
[13:27] because you'll be the biggest stumbling
[13:29] block in this world
[13:47] christiano hold
[13:49] first to your confession
[13:53] [Music]
[13:58] and we're just fulfilling what the
[14:00] pastor said
[14:04] this church is a scriptural church
[14:10] that way you don't take our word
[14:15] if we can prove by the scriptures
[14:20] then
[14:22] you're anchored
[14:28] who was faithful to him
[14:30] that appointed him as also moses was
[14:34] faithful in all his house
[14:42] was moses faithful
[14:47] numbers
[14:48] 12 verse 5
[14:50] numerous
[14:52] cuatro versus
[14:56] numbers 12 numbers
[14:59] and verse 5.
[15:02] and the lord came down in the pillar of
[15:05] the cloud and stood in the door of the
[15:07] tabernacle and called aaron and miriam
[15:11] and they both came forth
[15:22] and he said hear now my word if there be
[15:25] a prophet among you i the lord will make
[15:28] myself known unto him in a vision and
[15:32] will speak unto him in a dream
[15:45] my servant moses is not
[15:47] so who is faithful in all mine now no
[15:51] see
[15:55] with him will i speak month to month
[15:58] even apparently and not in dark
[16:02] speeches
[16:03] and the similitude of the lord shall he
[16:06] behold for for then were you not afraid
[16:09] of to speak against my servant moses
[16:19] to this
[16:25] now who has more glory all right
[16:28] gloria
[16:30] the house or the builder
[16:32] la casa
[16:34] constructor
[16:36] second corinthians 3
[16:39] 7.
[16:45] it's going to get good now
[16:48] and we're now in chapter 3
[16:52] in chapter 3.
[16:54] brother venom says
[16:56] you better know
[16:58] how to swim because we're going to go
[17:00] through deep water this is
[17:08] but if the
[17:09] ministration of death written and
[17:12] engraving in stones was glorious so that
[17:15] the children of israel could not step
[17:18] fastly behold the face of moses for the
[17:21] glory of his countenance which glory was
[17:25] to be done away
[17:28] [Music]
[17:44] does death have a ministry
[17:50] of course here it says the ministration
[17:52] of death
[17:56] in my greek bible says the ministry of
[17:59] death
[18:02] ministerio
[18:04] who is administration but administration
[18:08] is just a minister doing
[18:11] this
[18:24] in the beginning the spirit of god and a
[18:27] principio el espirito de dios moved upon
[18:31] the face of the waters
[18:36] god the spirit is without form
[18:41] informa
[18:42] but as the builder of the house
[18:47] it can come in any form
[18:52] and moses wanted to see him
[18:58] and only saw his back
[19:04] because god changed from the
[19:06] supernatural to the natural
[19:08] jose
[19:14] [Music]
[19:17] and became one of us
[19:21] he came as the
[19:32] so he came as a solomon
[19:34] when did he change porn
[19:37] [Music]
[20:02] [Music]
[20:05] is he right
[20:07] isaiah
[20:13] oh my
[20:17] he changed
[20:18] forms
[20:31] it comes in different forms remember
[20:44] but the greeks wanted to see him
[20:49] and they didn't see him
[20:53] because he was in the temple of his
[20:55] humanity
[20:59] again i asked the question
[21:04] does death
[21:06] have a ministry
[21:14] was jesus an apostle jesus
[21:19] yes
[21:21] amen amen
[21:55] scripture and message
[22:10] of unleavened bread drew knife which is
[22:13] called the passover
[22:17] estava
[22:22] and the chief priest inscribed thought
[22:25] how they might kill him for they feared
[22:28] the people
[22:36] here he goes
[22:38] then enter satan into judas her name is
[22:42] scaried
[22:43] being of the number of the 12.
[23:04] is scary as i said last night
[23:18] and jesus christ was born the son of god
[23:22] jesus christ
[23:25] then god lived in christ
[23:29] is that right
[23:31] and satan lived in judas
[23:36] if christ was the son of god born the
[23:39] son of god
[23:40] christ
[23:44] the incarnate son of god elijah's
[23:47] incarnation then satan was born the son
[23:51] of perdition he was incarnate in judas
[24:00] in uh
[24:17] an apostle is one sent
[24:22] is someone that goes and puts orders
[24:28] in order but saying
[24:30] in
[25:11] so where did that spirit come from the
[25:14] thunderstorm
[25:15] to quest when you're reading the in the
[25:17] church changes from the left
[25:20] these denominations are the synagogue of
[25:23] satan
[25:26] and they
[25:40] do you think that they could be pray for
[25:43] the sick and s
[25:44] and for money and they would give them
[25:46] money
[25:51] so you see where the spirit comes from
[25:53] best done
[25:57] so if death hit a ministry
[26:03] what about life
[26:07] we
[26:08] read what we read at the beginning
[26:14] if you follow me closely
[26:17] we're gonna end with the same thing
[26:22] who has more glory
[26:25] gloria the builder of the house
[26:31] or the house
[26:32] oh la casa
[26:35] first corinthians 3 16 the medical
[26:39] influence that she says
[26:46] knowing not that you are the temple of
[26:49] god
[26:50] and that the spirit of god dwelleth in
[26:52] you
[26:57] jesus
[27:03] if any man defile the temple of god him
[27:06] shall god destroy for the temple of god
[27:09] is holy which temple
[27:13] is
[27:52] and then
[27:53] those attributes became words
[27:59] and they had to become flesh
[28:14] what did he bring back
[28:16] he had to bring something that he
[28:20] that uh
[28:21] he did he to bring back the the people
[28:24] that will never be able to see it
[28:50] does everybody in the world
[28:53] tell us
[28:55] were they in the thoughts
[29:11] was everybody in the thought of god
[29:25] but they're all on the thoughts of god
[29:26] today
[29:29] am i
[29:31] not all the people were in the thoughts
[29:34] of god in the beginning
[29:39] was the woman at the well in the
[29:41] thoughts of god in the beginning
[29:48] who was the woman of the world
[29:53] it was you
[29:54] you
[29:55] you
[29:56] you
[29:57] and myself
[30:04] notice at the time that she went because
[30:20] because she went to get water from that
[30:22] well
[30:25] you come to this church to get water
[30:27] from the well healed us
[30:33] and notice that jesus
[30:36] came to her
[30:37] he could say jesus
[30:40] why did jesus come to her when the bible
[30:43] says unto his own he came
[30:47] jesus
[31:11] let me ask the question
[31:46] so she was drinking from that well that
[31:48] belonged to the jacob dog years before
[31:57] then
[31:58] that spirit
[32:00] is a spiritual ask you the same question
[32:06] go
[32:07] call your husband
[32:11] esposo
[32:26] well
[32:38] [Music]
[33:37] so then you and i entrances us
[33:41] attributes of him at the beginning
[33:43] activities
[33:45] were made flesh and we became redeemable
[33:49] limousines partners in pharmaceuticals
[33:56] this is why this message was revealed to
[34:00] each and every one of you
[34:28] but our fathers worshipped on this
[34:31] mountain and in jerusalem
[34:38] in silver city in las cruces ferrantes
[34:40] are almost in silver city in las cruces
[34:42] woman let me tell you
[34:45] not even in silver
[34:59] which is the glory in the house or or
[35:03] the builder of the house
[35:09] he does not dwell in buildings made by
[35:12] the house by a handsome man
[35:32] [Music]
[35:41] in the old testament in antigua
[35:43] testamento god veil himself behind
[35:47] badger skins
[35:52] they was at his mercy seat estaba and
[35:55] social media
[35:58] and to them he would come as a cloud or
[36:02] a pillar of fire
[36:08] and would bail himself to the outside
[36:11] world
[36:15] that's what jesus told the woman of the
[36:18] world
[36:24] in the world
[37:22] i don't say you don't talk to them
[37:26] you might win some of them
[37:30] but not hang out you know do what they
[37:32] do
[38:02] escondido
[38:59] for this man was counted worthy of more
[39:02] glory than moses
[39:05] inasmuch as he who has built the house
[39:08] has more honor than the house
[39:23] for he
[39:24] has been counted worthy of more glory
[39:28] than moses
[39:29] which person is that
[39:32] okay
[39:38] so then to stay away from his glory
[39:51] that happened of course
[39:53] when the veil was read at calvary
[40:05] so now to stay out of his presence
[40:57] the mercy seat from the people
[41:03] ii corinthians 3
[41:13] but if the ministry of death written
[41:16] engraved in stones was glorious
[41:20] so that the children of israel could not
[41:23] steadfastly behold the face of moses or
[41:26] the glory of his countenance countenance
[41:29] which glory was to be done away
[41:46] the ministry or the ministry of death
[41:49] administration
[41:52] in letters and letters of course we know
[41:55] there was the ten commandments
[42:00] which was engraved in stone effect
[42:03] and that
[42:05] law came with glory yes i laid dino
[42:08] congloria but follow me closely second
[42:12] god
[42:13] came down on mount
[42:19] in the same spirit of fire and in miss
[42:22] my spirit to the fuego and the one he
[42:24] gave the promise to
[42:27] el diola promesa he brought him forth
[42:30] with the word
[42:35] what was the word
[42:38] it was engraved in stone yeah
[42:59] because the world always first comes to
[43:02] the prophet
[43:07] now we're talking about the house and
[43:10] the one who built the house
[43:15] who
[43:16] has more glory in tenemas gloria
[43:22] and the ministry of death
[43:51] that's what we read in second
[43:53] corinthians 7.
[43:58] for the world wasn't completely made
[44:01] manifest
[44:06] they knew something had happened to
[44:08] moses
[44:11] but they didn't know what it was
[44:15] the roaring and the thundering that's
[44:17] what they heard
[44:22] and they said let moses speak to us
[44:31] remember that the
[44:33] law came with glory recording can allay
[44:36] be not from gloria to who has more glory
[44:39] and justice continues gloria
[44:44] so then moses with a natural law
[44:47] enthusiasm
[45:00] how much more will the spiritual
[45:15] before it's made manifest to them
[45:24] which has an end or had an end to it
[45:30] was
[46:06] now that uh
[46:08] we have this plague of the covet hit him
[46:10] real hard
[46:41] it started to hit real hard in europe
[46:47] and uh
[46:49] they were superstitious in that time
[46:54] and uh
[46:56] they used to say
[46:58] and this was this year
[47:00] that
[47:01] the cat
[47:05] was an animal of the devil
[47:33] and then people start dying by the
[47:36] hundreds
[47:40] [Music]
[47:49] his house nobody got sick
[47:55] they didn't know why he knows
[47:58] because of many of them all the families
[48:01] somebody died in their house and
[48:03] families
[48:18] what happened
[49:26] moses which says
[49:40] moses had to enter the pillar of fire
[49:44] alone
[49:48] what does that speak up
[49:56] that you don't come
[49:58] here by joining any group
[50:05] he never revealed this
[50:08] to any group
[50:19] you have to walk alone
[50:22] solo
[50:27] nobody makes a decision for you
[50:32] did anybody force you to come tonight
[50:35] over here
[50:39] are you forced to come to church on
[50:41] sunday morning
[50:45] i know some of you
[50:47] like to sleep late
[50:51] you don't have to raise your hands
[51:08] so
[51:12] i would say i know a person that like to
[51:14] sleep kind of late
[51:21] but
[51:23] it's it's hard sometimes to get out
[51:27] especially in the winter when it's warm
[51:29] under the blind case especially
[51:34] anyway
[51:39] but you come to this message
[51:48] nobody forced me to come into this mess
[51:54] if you are redeemable
[51:57] you know
[51:59] who to follow
[52:16] is
[52:45] no coming on you but you followed what
[52:47] he thought
[52:50] thank god for that
[52:58] when moses went up to mount sinai
[53:04] did anybody go with him
[53:08] he went by himself
[53:11] if anybody wanted to follow
[53:25] and you'll get a spiritual
[53:33] [Music]
[53:57] are you
[53:58] the living word
[54:04] there's my sister here
[54:09] you guys preach that that uh
[54:12] that you can give life
[54:14] to the people
[54:22] can you give life to someone
[54:30] mr yolanda you can give life to somebody
[54:36] rachel can you give life to somebody
[54:40] will you have life you can't
[54:44] aren't you are tree of life
[54:48] if the world lives in europe
[55:20] [Music]
[55:44] and those were made manifest in this day
[55:50] and they have to believe the world and
[55:52] the promise of this day
[55:56] that god is pouring out his spirit upon
[55:59] all flesh
[56:09] in the time of moses in a temporary
[56:11] mistake it was manifested with
[56:19] it was manifested only to the exodus
[56:23] people
[56:29] are you danielle in an exodus
[56:42] foreign
[56:53] where are we going
[56:58] well
[56:59] this person all right esta persona and
[57:03] every one of you
[57:06] we are going to two
[57:08] exodus
[57:24] to the grave
[57:32] but what about the inner man
[57:38] just
[58:04] people see we have changed
[58:11] [Music]
[58:16] how shall not the administration of the
[58:19] spirit be rather glorious
[58:23] gloria administerio del spiritu
[58:26] or is the administration of condemnation
[58:29] be glory
[58:30] much more than the administration of
[58:32] righteousness exceeding glory for glory
[58:43] for even that which was made glorious
[58:46] had no glory in this respect by reason
[58:50] of the glory that excellence
[59:00] for that which is done away was glorious
[59:03] much more that which remaineth is
[59:06] glorious
[59:14] seeing then that we have such hope we
[59:16] use great plainness of speech
[59:24] not as moses which put a veil over his
[59:26] face that the children of israel could
[59:29] not steadfastly look to the end of that
[59:32] which is abolished
[59:43] who have more glory quintinimas gloria
[59:47] the house or the builder of the house
[59:52] another thing in the old testament
[59:56] what did the villager skins
[1:00:38] in the glory of god
[1:00:41] was hid behind
[1:00:43] that screen
[1:00:49] where is the glory of god now
[1:01:06] where is the glory of god
[1:01:41] [Music]
[1:01:46] was in that tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:01:50] [Music]
[1:02:05] orita
[1:02:06] and i'll explain now
[1:02:10] in that tabernacle in the desert
[1:02:15] that glory of god
[1:02:17] hid behind the
[1:02:33] common people
[1:02:37] so then when they got to the promised
[1:02:40] land
[1:02:43] they did away with that then
[1:03:13] it is behind
[1:03:28] skin
[1:03:31] i say this all right
[1:03:33] i was talking we had a meme the best
[1:03:35] friend tommy
[1:03:38] and jimmy
[1:03:42] we spent five hours monday with brother
[1:03:45] from norway
[1:03:51] and uh
[1:03:52] very fruitful
[1:03:55] yes a lot of questions
[1:03:58] and we
[1:03:59] like i told uh and i know caleb and
[1:04:03] you say
[1:04:04] and i don't know who else they spend a
[1:04:06] lot of hours
[1:04:10] so he's taking a lot of immunity he took
[1:04:12] a lot of ammunition to norway
[1:04:20] talking to him
[1:04:22] i i told brother more
[1:04:33] [Music]
[1:04:38] it is lamp
[1:04:40] dreaming time all right
[1:04:46] so how can the glory of god
[1:04:52] be behind a dirty vessel
[1:05:05] in mexico
[1:05:19] in english
[1:05:32] a glass uh like a little glass little
[1:05:35] chimney too
[1:05:38] and
[1:05:39] and the
[1:05:40] films of the fire would blacken the
[1:05:42] sides of it
[1:06:03] [Music]
[1:06:30] so people
[1:06:31] you know you go to you i know you have
[1:06:33] to go to the to walmart
[1:06:35] [Music]
[1:06:39] can you imagine all the spirits in those
[1:06:41] places
[1:06:44] and a lot of times emojis messages
[1:06:47] you get there from those stores
[1:06:51] and other time you bring one of those
[1:06:54] period
[1:06:58] some
[1:06:58] maybe maybe not in any of you
[1:07:04] this this bible studies goes to
[1:07:07] a lot of people
[1:07:13] and then you get into a fight with a
[1:07:15] wife
[1:07:19] or the wife with the husband
[1:07:22] you get angry he says
[1:07:25] where did you pick up that spirit
[1:07:53] mana
[1:07:57] as i turn up we're gonna finish with
[1:07:59] this thomas
[1:08:01] conesto
[1:08:04] but now that kind of glory moved to
[1:08:07] another tabernacle
[1:08:37] that uh
[1:08:38] we will not have another bible study
[1:08:41] until january of 2022.
[1:08:50] next friday is christmas eve
[1:08:56] and the following friday
[1:08:59] is new year's eve
[1:09:03] and i believe the president wants to
[1:09:05] have communion correct
[1:09:09] so get ready okay
[1:09:11] [Music]
[1:09:13] that's the reason we we're not going to
[1:09:14] have bible study
[1:09:17] studio but
[1:09:33] glory she kind of glory gloria
[1:09:36] moved to another house
[1:09:41] so paul has been speaking about the
[1:09:44] house
[1:09:55] who has more glory
[1:09:58] gloria just as soon as moses brought
[1:10:02] them out of egypt
[1:10:06] they were under the blood
[1:10:10] and they were led
[1:10:12] right to the red sea
[1:10:20] when you get the holy ghost
[1:10:24] there are a lot of obstacles i'm just
[1:10:27] obstaculous
[1:10:29] because many are the afflictions of the
[1:10:32] righteous
[1:10:33] affliction
[1:10:35] because jesus
[1:10:37] jesus as soon as he was baptized
[1:10:41] he went into the wilderness to be
[1:10:44] tempted of the devil
[1:10:49] and when moses and israel cross the red
[1:10:53] sea
[1:10:56] he led them straight to temptation
[1:11:02] to the wilderness of sin
[1:11:10] we
[1:11:10] sing cantamos
[1:11:13] through many
[1:11:14] dangers toils and snails
[1:11:21] i have already come young
[1:11:23] but amazing grace will see us
[1:11:30] when they got to the wilderness of sin
[1:11:35] they started murmuring
[1:11:50] can you imagine the garlic the onion and
[1:11:53] the cucumber
[1:11:59] when they were eating angel's food
[1:12:02] on the journey
[1:12:05] comedy
[1:12:09] [Music]
[1:12:18] and we see that moses was so upset with
[1:12:22] them
[1:12:26] and moses struck the rock twice
[1:12:34] does
[1:12:59] you wanted for the house to have more
[1:13:02] glory than the builder
[1:13:06] and instead of glorifying me
[1:13:10] you glorified yourself
[1:13:15] cause you were disobedient
[1:13:27] [Music]
[1:13:31] not glorifying or no glory be god
[1:13:35] so who has more glory
[1:13:37] glory of course
[1:13:43] you know who built the house
[1:13:52] so
[1:13:53] god bless you
[1:13:56] and
[1:14:00] you pray for me oren for me
[1:14:02] because uh
[1:14:05] since
[1:14:07] the first 14 verses
[1:14:25] because he comes on the scene and shows
[1:14:27] me a lot of things
[1:14:30] may god richly bless you
[1:14:34] and uh we'll continue next year
