Jesus Christ I ask you to be seated I have very good news but that is the gospel the good news all the expectations that you wrote tonight we're having a prayer meeting you're not not able to send a petition where you're at you can raise your hand God knows all things God loves to answer the petitions you may be seated let me share with you a few words allow me to share with you some tools that you can have a life of prayer but not just any kind of uh prayer but an effective life of prayer when we speak of of praying it's not how many hours you spend on your knees many days you fast this is God loves to answer the petitions of his children so where where is the problem is many times it is the biggest impediment masquero with this I just want to say a few words I can just catch your attention for the next 10 minutes if we open our Bibles in the book of Hebrews verse Amigos in amen any Royal or pastor and his company those are with him in Israel when I enter in the spirit in prayer I it's hard for me to pronounce names but we're praying for them Hebrews chapter one verse the sixth chapter we love God this is for you raise your hand that this is for you to stand on your feet book of Hebrews first chapter verse 6. and again when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world he saith and let all the angels of God worship him Lord bless your word the name of the Lord Jesus Christ who is maybe seated if you're taking notes please write down what I'm going to tell you all used because today I believe you're gonna be a different person you're going to receive something that is going to make your prayer more effective as a believer and today is the standard for me and in my prayer life are you ready to receive this is are you ready amen hallelujah Satan is there just on the lookout what is he going to say what is he going to release a school chairman write it down brother Branham says Dios God Amma loves to be worshiped you didn't get it yes God no this is he he doesn't say that he likes a difference between something that I like to do and something that I love when brother said that God loves to be worshiped I have to do what he likes to be worshiped when you catch this is when you get it you have to learn this I learned about 20 years ago I was congregating the Church of a brother that was in Colombia that I appreciate with all my heart
