soon everyone is was Rosie hablar con cada uno the Ailes and and it was it was awesome Ifrit on Telemundo and then it was it was it was awesome because yesterday our pastor kind of snuck into the meeting if we were tell me not to remember Kelly yet mr. pastor put up what is a media and mr. hunter it was it was it was it was great to have that that interaction if we bueno that emissary interaxial and and and I I was reading here John the Revelator John the Divine who wrote the book of Revelation stubbornly under one everyone in Livigno khillski a little epic ellipsis and of course revelations is arguably one of the most important books of the Bible apocalypsis is seen argument artist who knows libras Alleluia mas importante and here's John on the Isle of Patmos a key stock one in Isla de Patmos and for those of you that don't know what the Isle of Patmos is foresters que no sleepin locust like he's not a Patmos it's an island that is it's a snake and and and and scorpion infested island isn't I either and you know the Scorpion is either be with us way out in the middle of the ocean I admitted it didn't matter Luciano and it's desolate he is muy des falada it's a miserable place to be is un lugar miserable a tostada he and the Roman Empire in Imperial Roman or well they would take all of the worst of the worst prisoners give up on those pillows pillows a prisoner nettles is II's Allah and they would they would leave them on this island you as their heaven I any say Isla and brother branham compares it to Alcatraz mmm la campaña compare a cockatrice but there was no prison to sleep in no be at Casa de donde door me there wasn't a cook that made you three square meals a day no be a cocina dokie a low-stress committees D arias there wasn't even any guards to watch out for what you were doing the borders but I'll be here I'll rock you to us yes you were completely on your own estabas completamente de su propia Quinta completely isolated from all

alone Sena and I and I thought it was kind of strange Europe instigator Emidio rattle that it seems like the Lord has us on the Isle of Patmos in our own home sometimes what is the case in your nose Tinian laser the part most investors oh god it's a business you look around and we are completely socially isolated immediately no matter what I don't go traded the puniest Allegan yeah forget about hanging around with somebody and seeing another face in Villa de tavera otra persona Eva Orosco el rastro many of us get to see the inside of four walls of our home muchos de nos vemos Solomon Telus cuatro Perez de nuestra casa maybe if we're lucky a trip to Walmart to buy some groceries it gives us eternal most worth de viaje a Walmart but a comparable mandala and it's it's very similar to what John was experiencing its moist amulet a low key experiment Abba won and John starts off and he says welcome inside agenda I'm a brother and companion in tribulation so hermano y companion in the tribulation he identifies himself with all of the other people of that day that were being being tried in and and being beat up and and killed as the identity cover control of the mask antic estaban siendo probe ellos but gallows humor tonight allison aquel tiempo he said I'm your brother and your companion in the tribulation is that yo soy su hermano y company era in a tribulation but I find something so tremendous here in Connecticut on tremendo a key because John instead of focusing on the tribulation Juan and lugar de in focusing in the tribulation John says when this day even though I was in tribulation I don't get gusto in the tribulus year even though I was in isolation Uncas doing his lover even though they boiled me in a in a vat of oil don't get Mary beard on and Moya granted their say TR the end oh you see the reason they sent John to the Isle of Patmos where a song can be or not want Elijah the Patmos was because when they boiled him in the oil from the letter B Aaron SAT Caliente he didn't burn and who knows that came off so they accused him of witchcraft Hales lactose around Esterbrook or w la Brujeria they said you gotta be the devil himself it's a technical said in Diablo mismo so go to the island of Patmos where you can't possess anybody else with the problems induced and no purpose or not nadie NOS they said he he cast a spell on the oil they say el Pasto Pomona Madison sobre el aceite para que no la cámara but John's sitting here on the Isle of Patmos they don't want Santa lo que ayuda de Patmos John begins to to do something one commencer acid
