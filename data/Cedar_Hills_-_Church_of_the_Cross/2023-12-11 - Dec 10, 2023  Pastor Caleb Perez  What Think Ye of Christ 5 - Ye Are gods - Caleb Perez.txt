wonderful time amen you may be seated before we get going I just want to uh it's a short clip this video but um uh but afterwards it's just in English so afterwards brother brother uh Emilio is gonna just kind of mention what it is in Spanish so that everyone can know but I thought this was a wonderful it's a story of brother brandham in South Africa Africa so can play it whenever they're ready William BR who's in South Africa he had a vision about an orange car with a kid on the road in an accident and he's going to go up to him and pray and he's going to rise from the dead William Brandon is in South Africa out outside of Johannesburg boom comes upon an accident there's the very car that he saw but the child in the car something's wrong the child isn't red the car isn't red the car is like white the kid like just clammy looking and so they say brother bran should you pray he says wait just wait he had to wait in this awkward Stillness and others are thinking well the police are coming the Medics are coming check this the sun started to set Setting Sun reflected off the water in front of the car anded it in Orange and the child orange he went over and prayed right then and Resurrection Life The Prophet saw the future but had to wait until the future became present for the mirle amen would you stand to your feet I thought that was wonderful enjoy that amen amen so if they say he's a false prophet my goodness show me anyone else that could that the Lord used to do those things amen amen let's get right into the word and just for a few few moments what think you of Christ number five and uh with a subtitle ye are Gods that's that's a hard that's quite a statement uh because um you know sometimes people think that you're putting more on ourselves but this is what the scripture says amen so so let's just see let's just see if we don't find we don't know who we are and what we are we we we're just playing church is that right that's all we're doing we come to church and we're we got a little bit of religion and and we're happy with that uh I'm not happy with that I want to know who we are what we are and where we're going you all remember I want this to be ingrained in you threefold purpose of of God you're going to know that the rest of your life remember what what what was said you understand Christ the mystery you're just about home so number one to reveal himself in Christ number two to have preeminence in his bride number three to restore the kingdom God in Christ Christ in his bride a restored Eden amen Matthew 22 is the ver is the scripture that we've been reading verse 41 when you have it you can say Amen amen and we're just going to take it slow today so I pray you can bear with us while the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked them saying what think ye of Christ when you don't know your position in Christ you haven't answered the question what think ye of Christ now one more scripture and that's Ephesians chapter 1 and verse one and it reads like this Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus may God add His blessings to the reading his word hold that hold that scripture you may be seated hold that scripture because we're going to read we're going to read uh we're going to continue reading on that but it says once again to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus it doesn't say to the faithful in Jesus Christ there's a reason why Things are Written the way that they are written because faithful in Christ Jesus simply means that you are faithful in the anointed man very important to understand that there's a reason why it doesn't say faithful and and say Lord but they were not faithful it doesn't say to the Lord for that was a different dispensation they were faithful to the anointed man everybody understand that so far again they were faithful to to Christ Jesus verse verse two if you can keep let's keep going in in your scriptures Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ we find all three there right Lord Jesus Christ now here you find these three but to the faithful they are to the anointed man verse three says Blessed Be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with some spiritual blessings no we're going to got to make sure we we we either believe this or we don't who has blessed us with all a l spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ he will bless us when we are in our position now we we we know this by the scriptures that God will never bless Israel outside their Homeland and neither will he bless the believer outside of their position the word or the office Christ pertains to the spiritual man we have to we have to make sure we understand that so spiritual blessings is not for a carnal person spiritual blessings are for Spiritual people I ask how many spiritual people do we have here spiritual blessings all spiritual blessings are for a spiritual people amen so then Christ is our position and You' be surprised how many people are blinded to this Christ is a position I want I want you to say this with me Al together Christ is a position Christ is a position I want you to say Christ is my position Christ is my position right it's not just a position it is my position tell your neighbor neighbor Christ is my position so he has blessed us the believer in Christ and we're grateful to God for that we have to watch how we speak and what we speak we've got to be very careful amen you know sometimes even the preacher has to be preached to amen now now you know you you hear people talking and and you see how they say things you realize but at times uh you know we we we talk the same way so yes the day before yesterday my wife had Twisted her foot and uh and she was she couldn't walk on it and she got up on Saturday and she says uh this is hurting me so bad and I said but we have a high priest of our confession and so I said we got to change the way we talk and so so she says yes I my foot is fine and I I kid you not it wasn't even not even a few minutes later she's walking around like nothing I said we have a high priest of our confession why don't we talk like that so later on in the day I was I don't know if I was dehydrated I was down and I just said man I don't feel good and sister Hannah says hey hey hey and I said I feel great you you understand but that's what we need to do with one another mind each other that that that we we have a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmity we have a high priest of our confession and so if we're always talking negative if we're always talking NE we ever going to G to going to get anywhere when we when we see these things we know that we have our position in Christ today is not the dispensation of the fatherhood great as that dispensation was neither is it the the dispensation of the sunship even though that was a great great dispensation but this today is the dispensation of the Holy Ghost in order to manifest the sons of God or I can say in order to manifest and you have to say me I came and we were manifested is that right okay now now now notice this now as as it unfolds the sons of God could only be manifested in the dispensation of the Holy Ghost now you might say well brother brother brandham said we're not living in the dispensation of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right not in the dispensation of the baptism of the Holy Ghost but we are living in the dispensation of the person of the Holy Ghost is the time or dispensation of adoption this is for sons of God not for Angels I'm GNA say it again this is for this is for sons of God here John chap 10 verse 33 and 3 to 35 you have it you can say Amen the Jews answered him saying for a good work we Stone thee not but for blasphemy and because thou being a man maketh thyself God now now now remember what my my my subtitle is ye are Gods we are Gods is that right okay so so so when we see this I'm not talking that we are Big G Gods there is only one big G only one God so when God was manifested in flesh they weren't going to Stone him because of his good works but because they could not figure out how a man he was making himself God and there they could not in their religion by their religion could not understand how they could or how he could be God and Jesus answered them is it not written in your law I said we we've we've said that before is it not written in your law he's pointing the law to their law but then he's telling them that he's the one that wrote it yes or yes amen get that now notice that he call he says it is not written is it not written in your law I said ye are Gods my goodness and if he called them Gods unto whom the word of God came and the scripture cannot be broken I'm I'm grateful to God for that because this doesn't just apply to back then the scripture goes all the way through it cannot be broken see the expression he called them Gods whom the word of God came to now I'm going to turn it a little bit so you understand me he called them God whom the logos or the Christ came to amen amen that's what we have to understand Christ is the word and so if the word or the logos the Christ comes to you ye are Gods how your neighbor if the word of God comes to you ye are God if the logos comes to you ye are God hallelujah and that logos has a bride Glory Glory Glory what think ye of Christ if he called them sons of God or Gods then the scripture cannot be broken never be broken say ye of him this is verse 36 say ye of him whom the father hath Sanctified and sent into the world thou blasphemist because I said I am the Son of God Son of God is spirit that right right amen that's part that's one of his offices because I said I am the Son of God when he was here as a man was he Son of God he was here as son of man prophet he was in flesh son of man but through the church ages he was Son of God because he was back in spirit form everybody understand that I'm trying to be as easy as possible that I can this morning so what was God restoring we we we we we follow a message and it's a message of restoration because every one of us was born in sin escaped in iniquity we came to the world World speaking lies and somehow we come to church and think that we're better than everyone else yes or yes I've been going to church all my life well good you're responsible for a lot that don't make you any better than anyone I want you to I want to know what was going to be restored a message came sent a prophet that message was a message of restoration not of reformation that was during the church ages but at the end there was going to be a re a restoring a restoration what was going to be restored what was God restoring man's position godship okay some people will say that's blasphemy say godship that doesn't pertain to us we're human beings I didn't say that the Bible says that the scripture can't be broken not yday yesterday not today not tomorrow that's why I say we either got to know what we're doing in church that to make us feel good that we came to church no the word [Music] godship it means the rank the character or the personality of a god deity Divinity now in the message adoption number four he goes on to say this so I guess they're still having the same problem same problem that they were having back then they were having the same problem in the times of of of this prophet and the same problem today he says this this may choke you to death this is May maybe GNA choke you choke you to death but did you know that men men that are sons of God are amateure Gods is that is that anybody here or is that just the people in the Bible you know the people in the Bible were just as much human as you are and they didn't live in this time which is the time of the manifestation of the sons of God so it's a greater time now did you know that men that are sons of God are amature Gods he goes on and says in the message why a man was made to be a God know that why does why does those things always seem like it's something something like far-fetched he's in the image of God he's a Son of God he's like him he was given a domain in Genesis 126 dominion over the whole earth that's right he Ruled the Earth he ruled the animal King and all the other kingdoms all but the king kingdom of God above he was God he was an amateure God so here's Satan and he's trying to keep us away from our position is that right amen that's what he was trying to do he he envied Adam so much because Adam as a Son of God as the God of this Earth could do things that he couldn't here's The Serpent and the serpent Here Comes Satan into that serpent he's jealous of Adam because he can do things that he can't doam do now these are all basic we we we have heard this time and time again but I'm getting to something something this morning he was an amateur God and Satan through the serpent man is trying to get ahead of God's plan and he's trying to take away or remove man from that position of godship okay Genesis 35 watch his thinking watch what he's trying to do here for God he's talking to the woman now for God does know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and ye shall be as God's knowing good and evil wait wait a minute you'll be as Gods knowing Good and Evil who was that tree of knowledge of Good and Evil come on who who was that tree that tree was Satan yes or yes so then he's telling them you shall be as Gods knowing or you'll be a part or a branch off of my tree right watch what he's offering them or her at the time yet they were already Gods oh my goodness I'm going to say it again they were already Gods he had dominion over the Earth he had dominion over the animals he was already a God he was the god of the Earth but he's trying to tell them that they have that that they don't have it or they did not have possession and so it is today that Satan is is okay with telling us that we will be sons of God we all know that that's one of his tricks putting something out in the future that is right now but remember men that are sons of God who came from that tree of life they are amateur gods they can't be anything less come on now there is only one source of life and that is the tree of life there's no other source okay stop for a minute think about this here's Moses and and and Moses he goes up the mountain for 40 days and there in the mountain he goes into this into a vision and he starts to see how things are in heaven he starts to see how where the throne is at now God is showing him this because God is wanting the same pattern that is in heaven to come down and be on earth here he sees this great picture he seen Heaven the throne the guards of the throne the stream of Life coming through he's seen the Tree of Life he's looking at all all this Perfection and God says now now now learn it you got you got to know this because you got to make the same thing here on Earth okay so imagine Moses when he starts to pen the Book of [Applause] Genesis whom the word of God comes to be our God and he starts to see this this whole picture the whole picture of Genesis right and he's he he he's writing these things down how many know Moses Moses wrote the Book of Genesis but he's seeing all these things and and and he's saying okay I I've got to do the same thing down here so he knows that right in the center is the tree of life or is the throne where life comes from he's he's seing this this Panorama now now now when he sees it here he starts to build the Tabernacle down here and this Tabernacle was it's as close as he could make it but the main things were there the outer Court the holy place the holy of Hol that's where the where that Mercy Seat was at and round about that Throne we see 144,000 right well we see that at the end but right here see 12 tribes 12 tribes made up of many people but they're encamped about round this is important because as he's doing that it is a type of what's coming afterwards because as tremendous as the Tabernacle in the wilderness is the throne is is moving all the time that's why I say as tremendous it was that God was tabernacled in Jesus Christ that was the groom tree but that groom tree also has a bride tree and when he would come at the end notice that groom tree he also had guards around him we know who the guards of that of him was that of of that Throne right the guards of that Throne that's right the gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John but when when we come then through the church ages we also see guards and those guards is what is the four living creatures right ox or the lion the O the man and the L Eagle now what's so significant about this is because many people even today this is what brother Braham says that they're living the glare of another [Music] age they're living under the anointing of The Lion and the ox and the man but they're missing the anointing of the Flying Eagle this is where I believe that the foolish virgins miss it they don't have the complete anointing there's something that is missing and that is the anointing of the Flying Eagle because under the anointing of that flying eagle the revelation of the of your day of the message of your day it's be that you have recognized your day and its message now now think about this for a moment because this is why it's so important that at the last moment will the bride have a Ministry okay see what are the guards to the throne in this last moment this is important church because as the throne moves there are guards there now all those four living creatures yes they're still around it but now he's given or placed more guard to the body or where he is at today he's got guards Church come on now and what are his guards today the fivefold ministry right Apostles and Prophets and teachers evangelists and pastors around the throne that's why it gets more severe and more severe now I say all that but but but let me get back to where I was at that's the trouble he says of it today another Christian person that's sitting here sick if they only knew that they were Sons and Daughters of God how many sick people do we have nobody sick got two three four five six seven and we got many some of that are in the hospital right now now he's saying if they only knew that they were Sons and Daughters of God now living with Christ is that you or who is that I I don't like it when it's pushed off on somebody else who who is this talking now living with Christ that's me that's you but you've got to recognize that watch what he says now now now you've got the Pentecostal blessing the day of Pentecost fully come and then he go 1900 years ago he goes never till Jesus that's when the day of Pentecost will fully have arrived oh watch what he says here now this is the message thou knowest all things now is the hour tomorrow now is the hour now is the time now is the accepted hour this is the acceptable year of the Lord now is when healing is supposed to be anybody sick here he is the high priest of your confession by his stri we are healed now is when Miracles take place not tomorrow you know it seems like we don't see very many miracles no more huh but it depends on what kind of Miracles we're looking for now is when Christ is revealing himself here we are now not in the future the devil keeps pushing it off that's Catholicism now is the day this is the hour this is the time this is the place right now this is the day oh Church come on and so then when Adam had sinned that godship came out of Adam and went back to where it came from oh what a thing huh what a thing that happened in the garden and Moses is writing Tree of Life the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil I saw that saw these rivers that flow through Eden he's writing these things and he's he's seeing them so he is an amateur but the reason that we don't recognize it because sin has blinded every fiber of our bodies sin has blinded our minds sin has blinded our hearts and therefore we can't see who we really are that's why we need a new birth notice in this in the message thirsting for Life read this go along just read it with me if you could the logos that went out of God no disregards to the Catholic people [Music] now but they use the word of Eternal sunship of God Asal ship anybody you act like you don't know what I'm talking about if you read you would know what I'm talking about they use the word Eternal sunship of God the word doesn't even make sense to me the word Eternal means eternity which had no beginning or has no end and Son means that it had a beginning so how could it it could be then he goes so how could it and then he stops it could be a eternal godship right not Eternal sunship those words don't go together a son had a beginning an eternal beginning doesn't make sense but it could be a Eternal godship what he's saying he's telling us he's telling us who we are it could be an eternal godship but never an eternal sunship a son is one that's begotten of so it had a beginning and the logos which was the son of God went out created by these great Fountains of Purity now this is important because in the early years he talks about the logos being the Son of God but by the end of the message in the later years he never uses logos with son anymore why I want to know why he doesn't use sunship anymore with logos okay stop for a moment because this is this is good stuff better smile at me you have this look at me for reals all right TR I get some smesh think I was wasn't telling you giving you eternal life this morning excited about that I'm excited when I I read why does he use son with logos at the beginning of his message but in the later years he doesn't use that no more think about that for a it's tremendous why because he uses it as son because when he first came on the scene with his message we had not come in to this world yet and so there was still Sons inside of him that still had to come out and be manifested and as long as we were still in him there was still sunship but when once we come forth and are manifested there's nothing left to manifest there's nothing left to so when the last son has come forth that logos ain't son no more it is eternal but what is he he now he's known as the logos the Eternal Father Hallelujah did you get that sure everybody got that that's that's I think that's pretty easy watch now that's why when the last one comes in last one is manifested go back and brother Ram says there will be no need for the sun no need anymore for the lamb is the light he'll be at the top in that great City and right above him will be the Eternal Father Hallelujah so as long as he's got Sons to come forth notice this now every you got about that now let's let's go on it could be now he goes then he goes the logos which was the son of God and then he talks about those Spirits went out and created and it created the logos it was a body it was in the form of what we are now which in the clergy way of speaking is a theophany a body that doesn't have a spirit in it's a body that's waiting for you Christians the word theop mean the God is a body so it's a body like God know ye not that you have a theophany a body from God anybody here have that come on Church you we we have a body if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have a more excellent one we have another body that's waiting when we step out of this body into that body know ye not that ye are Gods let's continue to read this now when God was in theophany which was Christ in the making then that theop become flesh and dwelled amongst us then that was to redeem he came from there down through this to redeem this creature give it life and take it back up into the Eternal one I don't know about you but I that is so satisfying to myself adoption number four and when God said in Genesis 2 they were gods because they were had full domain or dominion over the world and he lost his godship he lost his sunship he lost his domain and Satan took it over but brother we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again come on church that's what it's about to take back what belongs to you tell your neighbor neighbor let's take back what belongs to us oh my Lord Jesus this is so good to me waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top when the full sons of God will be manifested when the power of God will walk out wait a minute I didn't know that power could walk can power walk yeah of course it is when it Finds Its vessel when the power of God will walk out and will take every Power Of Satan got away from him let's stop there for a moment come on you got to get into the spirit with me this morning when the power of God will walk out and will take hold this and will take every bit of power that Satan's got take it away from him we give Satan too much power that's what I'm talking about I don't feel good even the preacher has to be preached but as soon as I said I feel better things change don't give him power he should be powerless against the Church of the Living God come on I'm going to say it again he should be powerless but we we live in fear what's going to happen and what if this happen and what if that happen why are you worried because you haven't answered the question what think ye of Christ notice what he says here he made man a god a God in his domain and he it goes from C to se Shore to Shore and he has control of it what is Jehovah somebody help me somebody not a minister what does Jehovah mean somebody help me one with his family what else does it mean that's true that's the main that's the main one but there's something else it's so important to understand this when you say ye are Gods that's right cor Jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur god listen to the way brother brandham explains this adoption number one I am the all exist one who has created something off of myself you have not understood who Jehovah is you know I was what he made off of himself one who has created something off of myself to be a son of mine or an amateure a little one of mind he gave man he made man an amateur God and that man was God over the Earth we're getting that back I don't know about you but we're getting that back I'm challenging you this morning I'm going to get it back I will restore sayth the Lord watch this now that's why in Philippians 2:6 I didn't put that on there but if you can if you can pull that up real quick as we spoke of last Sunday Satan is a robber what does he do he steals bodies we talked about 200,000,000 or 200 million demons last year You' be surprised I go to this the Bible study brother Tim he's preaching exactly what we're preaching we're not talking sister Hannah is that true she can be she's a witness it's impossible that two men that we don't talk about what we're going to preach and we talking about the exact same thing 200 million demons which are enticing spirits okay how many of you confront these Spirits every day they entice you don't they enticing means that they pull you to themselves right so so so look at any example okay you're at school somebody cusses you out what's the first thing if you don't recognize that they have an anointing on them and that anointing wants to get on you then before you know it you're cussing right back at them what happened you were enticed and the spirits got a hold of you here comes the spirit gets a hold of the wife she gets mouthy and if someone doesn't have the Holy Ghost what do we do oh you want to fight I'll fight with you too what's going on enticing Spirits somebody cuts you off when you're driving what happen you just got enticed come on Church you know it true this is and everywhere you turn 200 million demons coming after the bride you know we we lose it like that anger issues get the Holy Ghost I'm not saying you'll never get angry but it'll help you control that we're human beings you know sometimes when I'm when I counsel with people notice I'm not getting too close back here might fall off and I count you tell them exactly have such a hard time to don't do it and I go to the Lord say Lord the answer was right there what's the problem Lord do I have to make it easier do I I mean what do I do Lord to help you're trying to get someone that don't have the Holy Ghost I'm not saying that everybody I talk to don't have the Holy Ghost many that I talk to I'm trying to get them to see what I'm talking about but the Holy Ghost isn't present and so instead of rolling out this big long plan get the Holy Ghost that will fix the majority of your marital problem the majority of whatever problems you got going on that's the problem we don't have the Holy Ghost many don't have it we have religion but not the Holy Ghost come on check yourself with the word as we continue to see this Philippians 2:6 says who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal put on that mind the mind that was in Christ put that mind on because then you won't think it robbery then you won't think it is blasphemy when the scripture says ye are God now when I Ponder these things and we we look this I'm going to I I'm going to have to start skipping a few things here but this is very very important of understanding our position in Christ I don't know if it's me but I am it is hot up there you guys hot down there somebody this Fan's working they don't work the AC I have to drink some you want some water anybody want some water you want some water we got some here you can come up and get one really I mean people it's okay it's okay I let I let youbody wants want you feeling fresh with notice this now our position is in Christ the only way to understand this we have to understand the trees that were in the garden tree you must bring it up through the garden all the way through up through the Bible everywhere from the you find the same two trees up in heaven yeah the tree of life was in heaven right you find those same two trees Heaven Down to Earth all the way through the scriptures trees every tree as you bring it through the scriptures you can search every one of you can search them all the way back to Genesis it's tremendous now that's why when you the same way that God has a brid Satan also has a brid and a tree shows the relationship between two or more people such as a family tree right that's why in Adam's genealogy you don't find Cain he was not part of that of that tree all right we find this the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil two Vines two trees growing side by side producing children all right now remember Satan had injected himself into the human race and hence all the mixtures and the high breeding and everything came from there and that's why it was Cain's children no notice how brother Braham says this they were the daughters of men Cain's daughters the daughters of men and the sons of God which were Adam's lineage death saw the daughters of men and what did they do they began to intertwine and to mix it again you understand why he says under no circumstances believer marry an [Music] unbeliever of they're mixing all the time he had injected himself into the human race and that's exactly the same way that Satan got through the serpent got to Eve and got to Eve by seducing her is the same way that the daughters of men the sons of God found them really attractive she began or they began to seduce them the same because they came from the same tree no now watch why I say this what was Satan after the god he wants to be worshiped he wanted to be the one that was worshiped and he has accomplished it the majority of the church World worship Satan and they don't even know it he is the god of his Eden the god of this evil age Satan himself 2 Thessalonians 2:3 and 4 we know this very well it talks about the man of sin to be revealed but then let's go on to the exposition we start with the fact that there were two trees in the midst of the garden the tree of life was Jesus it was Christ the the other tree is definitely Satan but he got that because of what came forth of the fruit of that tree we know that both of those trees had Rel a relationship to man or they would never have been placed there they must have had a part in The Sovereign plan and purpose of God in their relationship to in the relationship to Mankind and to himself or we would never impute omniscience unto God no it was the degradation of humanity by intermingling the seed okay now watch how tremendous this is this will prove that Satan was that other tree and and I'm just going to go real quick on this okay we were we were hitting this last when we had talked there had the ministerial conference in Africa Ezekiel 28 word of the Lord came unto me saying then we're going to go to verse two son of man say unto the prince of Tyrus thus sayith the Lord God thus sayith the Lord God because thine heart is lifted up and thou has said I am a God I sit in the seat of God in the midst of the Seas which is people yet thou art a man and not God though thou set thine heart as the heart of God who is the heart of God Jesus amen very Heart Of God Tyrus was a king he also wanted to be a God why because he was anointed by that tree it was the spirit or the tree that he was a branch off of verse 12 son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and say unto him thus sayith the Lord God thou seest up the sum full of wisdom and perfect in Beauty watch verse 13 thou H has been in Eden the Garden of God wait wait wait a minute he's talking to a King that thinks he's the king of the jungle King Kong he thinks he is the a God but in all reality how could that man king Tyrus I don't know how old he was whether he was 50 60 years old 70 I don't know but how could he have been in Eden you think about that know you have how could he have been in Eden he's saying son of man tell him thou has been in Eden because he wasn't talking to King Tyrus he was talking to the spirit that had come into King the same tree that was in Eden the same one he's talking to in Eden beautiful every precious stone was thy covering he goes on and says there was prepared when thou was created and thou art the anointed cherub that cover wasn't talking to that man was the spirit behind him that was the tree watch this thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee Ezekiel 31 now watch this watch how how all these things trees are spirits yes or Yes trees are persons trees are men if you don't get this you're not you'll never understand the Book of Genesis of every tree of the garden you may freely eat and then it's got a semicolon but of the tree that's in the midst don't need of that tree ah there were fruit trees that they could eat off of but that was one thing to the Natural because trees are natural but trees are also spiritual and when he's talking to King Tyrus he's talking to the spirit the tree he's talking about that's why he says the Tree of Life Is Christ oh put it we got to put all this together watch verse three behold the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with Fair branches with a shadowing shroud High stature pop was among the among the thick boughs the waters or multitude of people made him the Deep set him up on high with her Rivers Running round about his plants and sent out her little Rivers unto all the trees of the field watch verse eight the cedars in the garden of God could not hide him the fur trees were not like his boughs or branches and the chestnut trees were not like his branches nor any tree in the garden of God God was like unto him in his verse N I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches so that all the trees plural of Eden that were in the garden of God envied him so there were lots of trees once again and those trees were spirits and why did they envy him because he incarnate in the serpent cuz they all want a body to get into and they envied him who is this one look at this way look wow when's the last time you saw a peach tree be envious of a pear tree I wish I was a fruit trees don't do that humans that are anointed do that that's why people are like that the whole time I wish I had what they had I wish I had this and I wish I had that watch it be careful they all envied him Verse 18 to whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the Trees of Eden yet Thou shalt be brought down with the Trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the Earth I'm turning the corner I don't know how long I've been they took down and I have like 15 minutes all right thank you do you see what it is it's the lust for power okay come on now just give me your undivided attention for 15 or 20 or 25 or 30 minutes help out here okay it was a lust for power life is a power but the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is also a power but it's a perverted power and Satan has lusted for power from the beginning and he anoints people with the same lust for power we live in a world where everyone lust for power everyone lusts to be in control everyone wants power over someone else the husband wants to have power over the wife the wife wants to have power over the husband the children want to have power the nation are lusting for power the church lusts for power I didn't say the bride I said the church because they all want to be God's who was the first one to sin let me see first one to sin ever Lucifer right Lucifer sin started in heaven was it money fame or women he wanted Fame right he wanted to be like God he wanted everyone to know him as that that's it's no different today spirit ministers trying to be somebody somebody big somebody notice me a lust for power if we ever use this Pulpit personal gain or to pound on somebody or put out our Personal Agenda L for power oh yeah he's got a strong arm that's not the way the Holy Ghost was going to lead the church a man that's leading the church the Holy Ghost it is the tree of life that is leading his church but the regular church is the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil he's controlling the church church you got to see these things notice this now it's a lust for power because they all want to be want to have power when he's talking about this it's so tremendous because when you really look at it even never was deceived by sex it wasn't sex that got her to to fall of course he knew nothing about that but what was it it was the lust for power that's what got herur oh it wasn't just the serpent that said oh how could Adam do that and I can't but when he started messing with her don't you think she began to think what about me notice what the Bible says Genesis 3:4 and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die Genesis 3:4 for God does know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and ye shall be as God's knowing good and evil he's trying to graft her into his tree notice this now he was showing her of a power that she could obtain easily through pleasure and Lust For of the flesh she never lusted for the sex part even though that was part of Satan's scheme but she lusted for knowledge you shall be as God's knowing knowledge is power but what kind of power there's a quote from Brother brandham I have heard many times I have repeated it I've heard many repeated and that was that Satan designed the woman and I always had the question on that how did he design her was he designing her when made the flesh I heard Minister say that was designing her so that she looked very sexy sexy but that that don't sit right with I believe what the prophet of God said but how did he design her was he there when God pulled the rib out and he had some say in it that's nonsense Genesis chapter 2 let's see what what the Bible says verse 21 and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man I don't see where Satan was there and had anything to do with and Adam said this is now bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh if he designed her then how could she continue be to be bone of his bone and flesh of his fles she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man I don't don't see Satan here designing her in that way the designing of the woman is the deformation of her character you say how why do you say that because they had a veil they were both naked they hadil so she there was no reason for her to try to act sexy sexy there was no reason to try to to to to get ad him in that way they had innocence when he began to talk to her through the ear came forth and he began to deform her and he began to tell her about how life can come he began to deform her character the very things that God had placed inside of her sacred virtue sacred motherhood sacred Womanhood he was deforming those things how he began to design her in a way that she could be attractive that she could make man fall what was it the lust for power the lust to have control the lust to no longer have a man over come on now and when he talks about the designing of the woman he's not just talking about Eve he's talking about the church he has designed the church in a way to where she being controlled by that tree are worshiping him they don't even know it uhoh uhoh now we can stay on that for a while but remember the sacred virt she can say yes or no the sacred Womanhood is her conduct her character around men how she treats her husband and is being honorable to him sacred motherhood how she raises her children now remember when we see this we see how the design happened heed her and he continues he continues to deform her through a lust for power now listen closely Church Daniel 12:4 we know this by heart brother brother brother Abraham he hits this has hit this so many times andiel at the end knowledge shall increase we know those things knowledge shall increase but man wants his own know his own wisdom rather than God's and Satan wanted fair and square in the Garden of Eden yeah he wanted s Amen in the message saying zeden the lust of e for sin and he goes then if Eve lusted for knowledge it was sin and when we lust for knowledge PhD lld D sin to do so that's a strong statement but it's it's the truth no matter how strong it is still the truth the lust for knowledge for understanding the thing of it is today he says we don't try to establish the word of God in the people's hearts we're trying to establish ourselves chur are trying to establish the doctrine of the church in a person's heart we're commanded to establish the word to establish the word Paul says I didn't come to you with enticing words that your faith might rest upon in the knowledge of man but I come to you in power manifestations of the Holy Ghost that your faith might rest in God I like that we must not establish ourselves you hear somebody trying to establish because they seek for knowledge they seek for power and the power of the Holy Ghost is from their lives that's the problem many so-called Christians problem with so many so-called message Believers come to a place where they have so much knowledge and yet their lives are powerless we got power because we got knowledge perverted that's why oh there are errors in the Bible there are errors you have such a powerless life because you think you know something wow they live like the world they'll learn like the world but wait till something come on now we may think we have it all together wait till something happens wait till the doctor says you have six months to live then all your knowledge for what you better have something more than just knowledge you better be connected to the Tree of Life Christ because if not you're connected to the other tree oh my Lord Lord help us this morning we want to make sure we're right with the Lord Death comes knocking at the door they come running looking for help I thought you had power anybody knows who's who Anton L is anybody knew that that was he was the founder of the Church of Satan he wrote the Bible but when he was on his death bed his last words were this oh my oh my what have I done there's something very wrong there's something very wrong there's something very wrong passes on all the knowledge and the ideas and that thought he was he was doing realiz he was attached to the tree of knowledge thought he had done something good he realized it was you see this in how many more people today are in such a condition because they thought following the message was to learn all the quotes it's okay learn as many learn scriptures you can but that doesn't get that's not it though we understand all Mysteries the Bible says have not charity get the sounding brass and a tinkling symbol will sit in church for year after year after year and we deceived in church thinking we've got it that we got the Holy Ghost million miles from the Holy Ghost oh Lord help us this morning I'm not mad at anyone I'm mad at the Devil he deceived because of a lust for power but as many has received this is what Christ says as many has received him to them gave he power what is the greatest power that you can receive to pray for the sick and they recover come on Church the greatest power is it you pray for somebody that's dead and they raise up yeah we think that I want to see Miracles I don't want to see it's okay but that's not the greatest power the greatest power to them gave he power to become sons of God that's the greatest power because when you have become a Son of God you know the next step godship this this morning come on that's what we're after that's where we're going ye are Gods this is no joke this is not some fairy tale this is not some church doctrine though it's part of the doctrine this is life we become sons of God then comes the restoration of the godship for this tree of life which is the groom tree has a bride and he works through her today that is his body today I'm finishing now that is his body today Proverbs 3:18 she is the Tree of Life the woman was a tree of death because every man born of a woman is a few days and full of troubles but this is not talking about a church about his bride she is a tree of life then that lay hold upon her and happy is everyone that retaineth her she's the only one that has this power she don't lust for power she has the power because she is I'm going to say it again she is him is you want to receive that power be humble open your heart up him don't make it harder than it is but when you come to church come for a reason and then when you go home go home for a reason open your heart your mind your being to those two trees were intertwined yes but that tree that was to be restored at the end that tree is that bright tree we can go through the three stages of Grace and how the tree res how it came up again notice this now watch watch what brother Bram says sure those Pentecostal women they can be saved Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost and then fail I've been Sanctified brother Justified Sanctified and you still fail because you failed to listen he was telling what was up she was lusting for power when you see people oh Lord give me gifts what are you L me what are you trying to do get the Holy Ghost and then his life in you move what he has already placed in you and then it'll be him that is using the gift instead of you that's the problem we're all all trying to find out I want to do this and I want to do that you're L for someone else's position lust for power brother will come to the come to the to the piano or I'm not ever going to finish but I have to finish with this it's so important to understand where we are who we are what we are where we're going you're not going to make it on your own Works our own works are but we're striving for something greater not for more knowledge so we can say we know more than anyone else noing be more like him we must come God's way and his way says this unless we suffer cannot come on we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reain and the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering watch what Satan what what Satan Des designed her he deformed her character character is a victory not a gift and a man without character cannot Reign because power apart from character is satanic watch the trees inter intermingling power with character is fit to rule stand to your feet if you will don't you know that ye are God he he whom the word of God came he are God he whom the logos the Christ has come to he are God and he's come here for our benefit and a person that is fully surrendered to God is omnipotent omnipotent means all powerful not on her own not because because of him because of the Tree of Life and he's got guards at this tree and he guards the way to the tree of life now you young people maybe can say well my mama and my dad and I'm this way because my grandpa you used to be able to say those things not no more because the same two trees that were in the garden are the same two trees stands before every one of us we choose which tree we're going to eat off come on Church don't blame anyone else anymore take responsibility for your you get a hold of the Lord like never before we don't lust for power we have power because we have him it's not to show off it's not for that it's to it's to give or impart to people that's the greatest Miracle you can ever ever see in your life somebody lost has been imparted eternal life what greater thing is that as you bow your
