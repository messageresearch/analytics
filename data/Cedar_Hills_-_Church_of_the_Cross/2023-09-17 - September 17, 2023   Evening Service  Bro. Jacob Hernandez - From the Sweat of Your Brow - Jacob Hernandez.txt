Daniel Evans many of us had the honor and the privilege to visit Tucson Tabernacle back on August 26th right yes and the 27th Tucson Tabernacle and Augusto brother looks pretty good on camera in in camera we were there that Saturday night it was an honor and a blessing there are two things I want you to see in this picture the Hat the cowboy hat El Sombrero okay you already probably already know whose it is right this is and then right behind us is brother Brennan preached there twice in 1961. brother knows thank God two messages that more than likely he preached in Tucson in 1961 there's only two okay expectation uh expectativa Jesus Christ the same hey Jesus Christ that's Saturday night this is where the inspiration comes from okay we'll try to set a little foundation for you here fundamentals okay then once we set that Foundation these pictures we'll read the scriptura next picture please that's the top of the Hat this is sombrero the prophet of the age that man is is when brother Daniel Evans showed it to us Daniel Evans he's a brother sombrero the prophet of the age next one please I flipped it over I flipped it over because I wanted to see the inside interior and all around the inside was a bright yellow Ringo where do you think it came from I was like holding the Hat in my hand is in all poor widow um melodio because I have nothing else to give because those were her two mites that's all she had to give era and she gave it to the servant to the Lord Brother Daniel is Daniel Evans and I was as I was holding that head he started to touch the inside is then the scripture came to mind Genesis 3 19 you will eat the bread pan thank you brother now if you'll please stand to three portions of scripture Genesis 3 19 the one we just mentioned the next one will be Luke chapter 22 verse 44. and the second is that told myself right at the time Genesis chapter 3 verse 19 Luke 22 44 we will also visit the letter that Paul wrote to the Corinthians the first letter the book of Corinthians chapter 15 verse 45 and 47 in Genesis 319 reads in this manner in the sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it was thou takenado for thus thou artes and unto dust Thou shalt returns Luke chapter 22 verse 44. when you have it you can say Amen please and being in agony a now we find Jesus Christ in prayer and being in agony is he prayed more earnestly and his sweat is as if they were great drops of blood falling down foreign First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 45 through 47. versus the Apostle Paul writing to the Corinthians it is sown a natural body it is raised 45 I'm sorry I started 44 45. and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit a spirit hobit that was not first which is spiritual muscles but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual respirator 47 the first man is of this Earthly the second man El Segundo hombre is the Lord is thank you for your reverence do the word of God so this inspiration and this thought that I want to share with you tonight comes from that experience that we had in Tucson is and many of you may already know other of you may not know I love his story I love history foreign how old did our country turn this year in July 4th in Julio cuatro cuantos how old it had a birthday on July 4th how old is Julio cuatro I'll tell you is that okay it turned 247 years old you say you get it no close good job part of our history our country nuestro pace was built on the sweat tears and blood with many men many other countries as well let's talk about the United States there are a few men that are given the credit for building this country is Andrew Carnegie Senor Andrew Carnegie JD Rockefeller uh JD Rockefeller JP Morgan JP Morgan Cornelius Vanderbilt Cornelius Vanderbilt Henry Ford Henry Ford that's why a lot of brothers in here like pork he says foreign they're giving credit for building this country they invested their money they took a risk versus they worked and they gave their life lied us for a kingdom that one day will perisher because Christ is going to return and he will set his feet on the Mount of Olives his kingdom I'm trying to get us to think here a little bit how men strive in this world to obtain so many possessions right brother Henry what about that on Wednesdays about possessions but our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in the Book of John chapter 10 verse 36 or chapter 18 verse 36 years with verse 36 my kingdom is not of this they wanted him to establish the kingdom when he walked through the streets of Jerusalem Orlando [Music] back in the early 2000s in Los tempranos to stay in a little stage here for you it's still sitting a little Foundation fundamentals my family and I had the honor my family you're visiting over there the visitor Hoover Dam have you seen it it's an amazing yes built in the 30s training engineers in the room imagine the technology they had back then technology and it's still standing today yeah India history has it that a total of about 21 000 men hombres work at Hoover Dam is you know what the wage was back then 50

these men took us America they were on cables or ropes you saw it huh the memorial in Memorial a total of 96 men that they know of um lost their lives building over there in Hoover Dam how man gives

take drills and they would drill little holes in the wall and then insert a stick of dynamite [Music] would you do that for 50 cents oh no no oh no we want OSHA rules oh a work environment oh we have
