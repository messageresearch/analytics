[45:10] everywhere mr. Perry can deliver
[45:12] keyboard on the Kiera
[45:13] the Bible says that when the gospel of
[45:15] the kingdom they never killed a tree has

[56:49] lint in Sinhalese Italian Toledo the
[56:51] Africans say that is a Moya or wind law
[56:55] sloppy condition ammonia Obion that's

[57:29] became a living soul because it might be
[57:31] being not just that he was alive now but
[57:35] he had eternal life Tecna now now I say

[57:47] the lnternet the breath of life and I'll
[57:49] him to the Vida God takes the man now I
[57:51] just put my lung but it and he goes and

[58:37] listen to this oh my goodness what does
[58:40] the word Eden me K de la palabra en it

[58:44] paradise but I so can even if you go
[58:47] back to the ancient Hebrew but I see
[58:51] well you understand but you know back to
[58:53] the ancient Hebrew uh silent whoever
[58:55] there the way that they that they wrote
[58:57] things the Americas even las casas it
[58:59] was by
[59:00] pictures ereport photos it would make
[59:02] pictures I see in pintura and then it
[59:06] would form a word you know for my finale
[59:09] that's how they did as his comedy serum
[59:11] so when they when even was first written
[59:13] out from the event permanent way
[59:15] escritura tienes la forma it means
[59:18] paradise here para esto it means an open

[59:41] Vida then he puts man in a paradise live
[59:44] upon el hombre new price which was the
[59:46] place of the open door to him in lugar
[59:49] para la puta be on top and I am there he
[59:51] lived in a pleasant atmosphere video and
[59:54] what must must be replacement era in the
[59:57] presence of God enough presidentially
[59:59] Dios when we were asking they're asking
[1:00:02] us questions the other day on pregunta
[1:00:05] we have it right here on this past
[1:00:09] Monday Vietnamese words the brothers
[1:00:12] from Africa a video conferencing for we
[1:00:15] were we were online for about five hours
[1:00:17] the Monaco friends here via Skype or o6e
[1:00:20] quarter but what were the questions they
[1:00:22] asked was well we don't see anywhere in
[1:00:26] the Bible where Kane ever died in
[1:00:28] November an idea how much on the Morioka
[1:00:29] he and the answer came forth was letters
[1:00:32] possessed a Leo and Cain went out from
[1:00:34] the presence telepresence deduce that is
[1:00:39] death to any person it's just that my
[1:00:41] record when you leave the presence of
[1:00:44] God don't know that kind of present to
[1:00:45] the earth it is death is what that was
[1:00:48] his death it's the question where that
[1:00:49] day he went out from the presence of
[1:00:52] Gandia que salió de la presidenta de
[1:00:53] Dios what's this now uh traumatized the
[1:00:55] etymology of the original Hebrew of Eden
[1:01:00] the etymology it's then OD he not watch
[1:01:05] it means this it means an eye or to
[1:01:10] reveal as we can is even oh ho oh but I
[1:01:13] realize it's a
[1:01:14] door pathway Luna that ever UNEP when it
[1:01:17] means activity or life catalyst it'll be
[1:01:20] de or PV so it is the revealing of the
