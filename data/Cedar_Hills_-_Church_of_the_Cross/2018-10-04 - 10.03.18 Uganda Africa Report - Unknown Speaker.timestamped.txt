[31:23] Africa
[31:23] he muskie you almost Africa we know how
[31:26] much he loved Africa the African people
[31:28] it's almost killed I'm a mutual and the
[31:32] Africa know you know he one of the
[31:35] things he said he said I'll see you on
[31:37] Friday
[31:37] una cosa que dijo dijo you lose your
[31:39] royal air it'll be honest you know and
[31:41] where they're stuck in in in New York
[31:45] for about four hours this almost all
[31:46] also know by Oracle cuatro horas we
[31:48] didn't know we're gonna be delayed no
