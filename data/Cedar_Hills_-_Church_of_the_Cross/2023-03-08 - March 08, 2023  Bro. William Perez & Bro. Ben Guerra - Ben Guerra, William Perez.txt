pastor says currently being converted over we will be playing that as as soon as it completed amen thank our pastor this evening for the for the opportunity and uh what a uh what a time we had on Sunday amen Domingo I was uh I got into it uh a little too much I guess that I was uh I was kind of rocking back and forth a little bit and I rocked a little too much and I and I hit my wife on her shoulder kind of knocked her knocked her out of the way a little bit so I had to apologize I said I'm sorry I got I got a little too carried away there but uh we are so we're such a blessed people amen amen that is uh that is can't see the clock with brother Joe there thank you amen so we're gonna we're gonna open up our scriptures this evening and to the book of First Corinthians and we're going to start with the 15th uh chapter and the 12th verse and it reads like this now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead house says some among you that there is no resurrection of the Dead Resurrection May the Lord has blessings to the reading of the words you know as I was uh as I was um in the last month or so or a couple months we uh we have heard on the news noticias about a Revival uh in college and we we've we've seen it Lemos Visto that it was something that was just started out as a as maybe uh uh uh someone going up there and uh and and confessing uh their uh their wrongs and we see that it uh it continued not just for a week or two weeks I think it was well over a month maybe a couple of months romance many people from all over the world came to see what was going on um many many evangelicals even even notated that truly this is a Revival from the Lord there's no doubt to say that it was a Revival there's no I'm not here to say anything negative about it but you you have to see where the leading of the spirit is taking it and we're going back and seen uh these certain revivals uh that have that have hit the U.S regress it takes me it takes me to a movie that just came out called Jesus Revolution Jesus and if they can put the picture up there on April 8th of 1966 Time Magazine came out with a with a with a magazine or with that with the issue that that month is and the question of it was is dead how we don't believe in a coincidence but less than four months prior to this is less or about four months prior to this our Prophet brother Branham had passed away four months later Is God dead what a thing that was after almost three decades of nothing but the presence of God flowing through this country how fast and how uh and if you look at what happened how fast that that left four months after the prophet is passed away is but something was occurring during this time that I think is is pretty significant now I'm not talking about what had happened during the Jesus revolution of the 60s and 70s which was the hippie Revolution when the hippies were started coming and they started they started uh getting into into Christianity but I'm not talking about that type of movement there was something that started to happen in the in the mid to late 60s that caused in night in June 21st of 1971. for Time Magazine to Proclaim once again five years later time Jesus revolution revolution De Jesus but what happened between this period of five years that took place I believe that during these five years is why we are here today is amen amen there was a young man Hoven who had just gotten out of the Navy there is a man in 1966 that had a one-year-old son and was living in East L.A is it would bring in a revolution that impacted us so fiercely you knows that in 1971 the year that our pastor was born it caused something of a Jesus revolution in in our time Jesus now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the Dead commodities we look at Paul as he's writing to the Corinthians Paul is writing this to a to a to a people where Resurrection Resurrection was not something that was familiar to them even though even though they had heard the message they had heard what Paul had was preaching they were trying to grasp what is the meaning of Resurrection in Corinth in it was a port city at that time it was under the rule of the Roman Empire and the worship they had two Patron deities there was Poseidon who was god of the sea yes which was the goddess of central love Corinth was a definition of what's called a Party Town Pueblo de Fiesta and here is Paul akista Pablo trying to make them understand that there was a Christ that there was a savior Salvador that did something for them not only did he die no Solomon Not only was he buried but that he resurrected verse 13 but if there be no resurrection of the dead of the dead then is Christ not risen resurrection and if Christ be not risen then is our preaching Vain and your faith is also vain is and we are found false Witnesses of God because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ whom he raised not up if so be that the dead rise not is for if the dead rise not then is not Christ raised and if Christ be not raised your faith is vain ye are yet in your sins then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished if in this life only we have hope in Christ we are of all men most Miserables but now as Christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that's left this was something unfamiliar to the Corinthians this was something unfamiliar to them they couldn't grasp ayos how a deity of of God was able to resurrect from the dead their belief was when you're dead you're dead and that is and what a belief that is but the question this evening Is God dead is and your response to that is will say something because if you believe that God is dead or that there is no God okay no ideos it will take it will make you replace your body as your soul replies Su Alma let me repeat that again I'm sorry I said it incorrectly hello it will take your soul and it will make to make your body a pass because if there is no soul you're just left with material if you just if you just have the material you make your body to be the ultimate and the eternal eterno your body becomes your soulma if there is no God or if God is dead and what happens when there is no God is Man will always come to a point where they will make themselves great for they will make themselves in charge when there is no God because now they feel that they are the highest being that there is no there's nothing or no one that is greater than them and this is what happens this no also verse one that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves and I thought that was tremendous men shall be lovers of their own selves men shall say that there is no God no idea and that God is dead and they will say or they will become lovers of their own selves and we find that so much in our in our culture in our society today where we find women that uh that that are pro-abortion is they will say this is my body and what have they done they've become lovers of their own selves and yes they can say God is dead because if God was not dead you hear many times Well if there was a god there wouldn't be this all this suffering if there was a god children wouldn't get sick children wouldn't die and all this suffering would not happen if there was a godos and even if there was a God we know for sure he is dead what a question that is this evening what a question that is to ask ourselves even though we come to church even though we sing praises to the Lord and we do all these things yes we have to look ourselves in them in the mirror and we have to ask ourselves is the world seen God through us because if the world cannot see God through you then then to the world God is dead we have to be a reflection of God reflection de dios Is God dead is I want to thank our pastor for sending me this and um in the in the uh the message lifting lifting him up out of history and I can see amram night after night no matter how tired that proved his faith in that God is now if you don't know who amram and Joshua there were the parents of Moses says but today the people if they don't get everything they ask for the first time they pray they seem to think that he's dead what a what a place yes God God is dead I didn't get that healing that I wanted look what happened at my job look what happened to my family if if I don't if they don't get everything they want brother Branham says seem to think that he's dead he says what we need is men and women today this is men and women who are determined to hold on till they see a God that really lives you know you might not see you mean but he is saying if you hold on you're gonna realize that you serve a living God okay till they see a God that really lives comes into action that will not take no for an answer they are determined to stay with it they are sick and the doctor has said they can't get well I had something within them tells them they're going to be well hold on no matter what takes place have you joined the churches of the denominational denominational world after you have sapped all your strength from walking from place to place and you still can't find relief there is still a God that answers prayers and saves from sins we're going to skip to verse to uh to paragraph 57. it says or 56 I'm sorry could they say and we see him night after night as amram climbed the steps and Joshua would come up to him and say amram dear you've been up here praying all night why don't you just tell some of the boys where you're working and let them pray a while honey what if they don't do it somebody has got to do it somebody has got to pray through that's the ver that's the way every Christian ought to feel tonight not waiting for somebody else well I'm waiting for Brother Diego to pray tonight vamos I'm waiting for the sister to pray tonight brother Diego's going to be praying how about you get can you stand that's the way every Christian ought to feel tonight not waiting for somebody else but take the front selves and go through we believe the Bible to be a history it's also a prophetic book that tells that the same God shall rise in the last days and it's time for him to come unseen yes that Moses had prophesied or not Moses pardon me Abraham had given a promise by this God of history now this is this is pretty amazing here is amram praying Orlando and God had an answer to prayer for 400 years [Applause] four months later after birth after brother Brandon passes away is God dead what promises they couldn't see anything that was happening they said there's something wrong and that was four months is 400 years God had not answered a prayer oh but we get we get upset Lord you haven't answered me in 24 hours what's going on but I tell you something and seemingly we've had a silent God for a long time has come avenido where he's going to rise on the scene I don't know if you get that this evening 400 years not a prayer was answered by God could they have said on the seat yeah see God is dead he hasn't answered us yet there is no God no immigration after generation who knows how many generations we're in bondage but it was many generations that didn't even know what an answered prayer was why are we still in bondage well you got to go ask your father why are we still in bondage's Father well go ask your grandfather grandfather why are we still in bondage you gotta go ask your great grandfather he goes I don't know the Lord hasn't answered I have no idea why we're still here what he knew he knew that he was a child of God he knew that something was going to contest somebody that was raised up to take them out of their conditions while he was deep and concentrated prayer he looks standing in the corner he rubbed his eyes and he looked again there stood an angel with a sword drawn is Deliverance is coming check this out and your itu going to bring a son into this world he's going to be the one to deliver them well I can say or I can see amram welcome he's going crazy at this moment 400 years 400 years the prayer was answered what's going to happen are deliverers coming really yeah and it's going to come through us I'm I can I can hear him going down the street neighbor I gotta tell you something Jehovah's Not Dead neighbor I gotta tell you something Jehovah's not dead I gotta tell you something neighborhood after 400 years what a great thing that was what about our day I told you about a man this is from a little mining town in Southern New Mexico who in 1969 he was ordained in Bakersfield California in Bakersfield California and in 1972 a year after this Jesus Revolution magazine came out Jesus God started a revolution through him what had we been waiting foreign nothing's happened well maybe next year let's go to 67. let's go to Easter again nothing happened and years and years happened nothing has happened but at that time there was God was yes aren't you proud to be part of that Jesus Revolution so when you see these revolutions and these stories [Applause] I know what you're talking about I'm going to close with this there's a great lesson about success and Leadership [Music] from studying the way that Buffalo and cows respond to storms a man is a man is saying this story in Colorado where I grew up because we are famous for the Rocky Mountains says what people don't realize is that the state is divided almost exactly in half is and to the eastern part of the state there are there's the great Kansas Plains Kansas it says because of this unique landscape uh the landscape or this is we are one of the few places in the world where Buffalo and cows are in close proximity to each other he says when the storms come they all they almost always come from the west and roll out towards the east he said when the cows sense the storm coming from the West Las Vegas they start to run toward the East the only problem with that is that the cow is slow so the storm catches up to the cow pretty fast and without realizing it the cow tries to outrun the storm uh this is maximizing the amount of pain and time is frustration they experience from the storms he says the buffalo on the other hand is very unique for the animal kingdom animal this is a buffalo wait for this they wait for the storm is to cross right over the peak of the Mountaintop and as the storm rolls over the ridge the Buffalo turned and charged directly into the storm instead of running East away from the storm Alejandro they run West by running at the storm they run straight through it minimizing the amount of pain and time and frustration they experienced from that storm notice now how it's the exact same storm which direction are we heading today it's easy to say there's a storm I'm going to head right into it brother but it's much harder this is to see the storm and head straight into it words are easy words are actions is that that's what shows our character that's what shows who we are and that's what shows if God is dead it's alive may God bless you this evening [Applause] thank you fine evening my water Masterpiece hey can you give another one to the Lord what a beautiful message many times we we leave and we put God into history you know we we put them as things that happened in the past you know but we have to believe one thing that God works through us that he lives inside of us if that is so if he does live inside of us then that same life that he has that same life has got to be inside of us you know that that's why our prophet he preached the message identified and in that message he ties all history up to himself I was identified I was identified this is our this is what God called US foreign they had no shoes yes with two feet of snow and they did not know what to do but he said we're gonna pray we're gonna pray till God answers and he prayed to God all night foreign he said he had to have prayed Spears and that's why we are here today church that's why we could preach a message like this we could freely preach who God is foreign El Campo let us turn to the book of Samuel first Samuel Thomas amen his word is amazing brother will what a beautiful message first Samuel one first Samuel 15 1. I want to paint you a picture today Samuel also said to Saul the Lord sent me to anointing to be king over his people over Israel now therefore hearken unto the voice of the words of the Lord of hosts I remember that that which to Israel how he laid wait for him in the way when he camped from up from me from Egypt Israel and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not slay both men and women if infant and suckling ox and sheep camel and ass is and I want you to take the spiritual aspect of this church what did God have against amalekites yes he's telling Saul here I'm sorry if I'm excited here but we're going to get somewhere here Church judges 2 verse 10. versus those yes and also all the generations were gathered unto his fathers and there arose another generation after them which knew not the Lord nor yet The Works which he had done for Israel is Rael verse and also will not henceforth drive out any from from before them of all Nations which Joshua left when he died that through them I may prove Israel whether they be kept in the way of the Lord to walk therein as their fathers did keep it or not therefore the Lord left those Nations without driving them out hastily neither delivered he them unto the hand of Joshua is [Music] but why what did God have against the malachites you go now to Joshua Caleb remember what they did Caleb said give me this mountain but what happened that was the land of the malachite that's where anik and the Three Sons those three Giants lived but God gave that to calebos everywhere were your feet shall tread upon but something happened as we just read our Rose degeneration so sin came in because now what happened God said okay he said you're not going to kill them I'm gonna let you drive them out so who was the first one that confronted Israel Israel when they crossed the Red Sea malachite every time that Israel got to a place of rest but the reason that God had something against they had no respect they had no respect of the god of Israel so now came the opportunity God gave them the opportunity once again Samuel got wind of it so Samuels here yours we fail many times muchas so what happened God said I'm fed up with this because he said yes you guys rejected my Kings you rejected my Prophet you chose the king let's go here already and this is what happens when you reject God's plan he said I'm done with this he said I'm finished he said my spirit you call me spiritually Samuel Samuel you go and tell Saul that my spirit is drawn from him give me Speedway and we get to chapter 17 or chapter 16. and the Lord said unto Samuel 16 1. how long will that mourn over solve seen I have rejected him from reigning over Israel sixteen one first person Israel this is the part church this is that we failed to see if I almost aware many times we have something against the pastor something against the ministry because the word of God comes forward but you don't see this part are you mourning for the people why are you crying for [Music] and Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brother and this is David he's doing this too and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day someone forward Samuel Rose so when did the Spirit come upon David from that day how many of us have had that from that day God our property God says that David was anointed they even knew that he was King David he knew that he was something special the prophet God said David killed the lion he killed the bear he knew that God was alive before that day but that day was something different the problem David something happened he said Samuel didn't just pour a couple of drops on itself poured that whole horde of oil on it that was a king that God had thrown that was the mouthpiece that's right no you go back in history you see many of these great prophets many of these great Saints when God moved down the street they raised the standards they raised it up they said this is what God is doing that's what gave the people yes because what did Abraham do yeah he told his wife he says I'm going up there he says I'm not coming out you know until God answers and he was afraid to go annoyed the scripture says that God told him you go through this again Saul doesn't need to know what's happening you annoyed David but you go do a sacrifice before you go here's David now he's anointed Prophet God said he in his heart but when he goes and you find him with his brothers Hermanos now here now look at it from a different point of view here now look at it as God raising the standards everything is [Music] oh there's this great Giant Goliath and he's the one that's out there he says why are you guys so dismayed are y'all sad see here he goes raising the standard because here we go back to the malachite you heard them make the challenge David says how dare this on circumcised um defy the armies of the Living God how dare him so he looked at his brother what are you doing and hearing of the word of God that word begins to get into action how dare you come on they file the armies and his brothers something must have happened we're the armies of the Living God crazy it was crazy David calm down you're just a righty little kid he said no but they are defiling how did he go to Goliath foreign that's what they used to beat him with loss I wonder why he would say dogs he knew what that staff was but here's David now all eyes are on him before he went there he tells his brothers he tells the men he says why is the wager get this church what is the way the Rota you see where David's going with this he says what's the wager yes yes Goliath do I take over reign of this of Israel controls do not air when it when it reads let me read it to you first 1726. yes she says and David spoke to the men that which which stood by him saying what shall be done to the man that killeth this philistine and take away the reproach of all Israel this giant he gets five stones Cinco he puts him in his script bag why does the script bad yes that's where he keeps honey he keeps stuff for his his Lambs but the prophet of God says it's also a money bag what's the purchasing power yeah [Music] you will not defy the armies this day you really because this is like back in the wilderness gods that are before you you'll see them no more and what did he do yeah you saw he grabbed that head he took it with him he believed the promise of God but what we have to understand that before us there's many muchos Davids we normally say there's many Giants oh cares about the giant there's many David's here that's where the faith has to be ready it's Victory Day not a god of history but it's your time today we're getting ready you're we're getting ready I
