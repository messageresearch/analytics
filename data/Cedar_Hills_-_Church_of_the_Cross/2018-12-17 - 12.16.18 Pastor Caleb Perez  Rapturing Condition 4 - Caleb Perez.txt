aparicio name is super low we see him in his same works loss nemesis miss Moscow grass they appearing Lapidus his holy spirit the spirit to Santo but his coming better soon me back will be in a physical being said physic and it'll be to catch the church up he said that but I ever said I want you to catch this now it'll kick up this he's appearing amongst his people is that but it's interesting because the people must recognize the Lord in their myths the Precision's and your instrument and when I look and I see he quando they or when he appeared in this time but it's unity it was the son of man being revealed again hearing a panacea to reduce a bride get up bright ready but I don't know she could go in the rapture km is the repto now he's appearing amongst his people stop by the scene don't there's no problem I want you to repeat with me here okay repeat economy appearing of the Lord and the coming of the Lord is two different works two different things so it is coming I'll be in a physical being was the news that physical then his appearing and you will be to get the spiritual part shut up out the - a participating are the inner man I don't bring video of our physical being and the self is ready for that coming guess they're least open ice Avenida right immense again the coming natural logical beam not to run physical but the appearing there Lapidus here's the spiritual work it's an hour displayed to get us to the condition you're on the size that comes where as we said we can step out of this body and on another body don't the promise I'll us take what we in turn out required for let's read the scripture again vamos lá lá lá before Colossus is prescribed who is our life cuando pissed okay Dennis Travis shall appear that man if they study then shall ye also appear with him in glory what but I see a tambien said it was manifest our school and a Blair means to render a parent yapanese aparecer case vastly declared and or manifest or to show us that show the self open a manifest as se mismo and the word I want you get this please it'll kick up this tone the word appear la palabra de Bouree Sarah is a verb it's unbearable yes or yes see us once again the word appear la palabra para ser is a verb it's embeddable and a verb it's an action that was soon accion but the word appear in the para la palabra is not a verb but it's en don't know soon that word appearing la pelea para siendo isn't now and you gotta get that to do while we're gone you gonna kick up that as you Eagles know where we're going already yeah I know where he's going now why once again I appear is the verb but it's the a better him going forth to show or manifesting action they killed wise their money fiesta but a pyramid operation is a noun is okay in schools our escuela a noun is a person place thing or idea they only there the quality or lack well he done so his appearing then so opera is one thing its una cosa and the to appear of it is luck soon the appearing is the noun or the person or the form y es la forma de la persona is that Palestine in vines expository and there's position they bind he states that to be manifested in the scriptural sense and declara que para manifest are say in the city of today is the more than just a word his mask enormous gets more than just to appear is masking operation but to be manifested or para ser manifesto is to be revealed in one's true carrot instead of 11 l character una cadena daleon again when Christ who is our life shall appear when dopey so Candice la vie that poor be revealed in his true character or characteristics that allow such characteristic as better then ye shall appear in your true character with him in glory cornillon glory and your glorified state God if you got oh now just stop is a Sunday school you get this kid ok captain is because if you can get get this there ain't nobody can ever tell you anything different about the appearing coming because you wake up that is 290 possessed here everybody's their missile every shield are missing the what ok this this might not excite you but but it's it's necessary it's just another hola como muchos because when you talk about verbs or appear which would be the word appear when da bloody F but is here they can either come forth in a passive voice well you're not was or an active voice when I was Activa now there's a difference here I different because once again watch this now the difference then Larry for Indian tongue says is that the active voice is Killa palabra deva is the subject of the sentence as to hit that allowed us he own acts upon something or someone yet to us every I'll go all game whereas in the passive voice okay okay so you know know what's the subject is acted upon by something or someone it's active else were aliens so the active voice it's the salaah voice Activa is when you wish to emphasize the doer of the action is come to stick in act 1 and the passive voice in a palo de pusi is when you wish to emphasize the receiver of the action is the developer that receive a large and you're gonna have to go back and hear this hear this message again to get it but they make you are there are you statements and it's very important to understand is we importante than their that when we read Colossians 3:4 from the lemma scholars insist tres cuatro this word appear Paris areas in its passive voice it does to us but not it's active or annoyance the words Activa now you might say well what does that have to do with anything easy kicking you lost me already do don't let the enemy tell you that nor can they let me let me kill any guys so and Christ who is our life can this na Vida shall appear about is that is the verb as here it's just in bed war but it is in a passive voice and soon that was because there is something okay young then triggers him to appear but is there you gotta get this to put everything in place in the key is to pop on a little there isn't something
