so it's a millennium it's uh so we're we're grateful to God to be able to to to hear the voice amen at the cross cantando in La Cruz de Mi Padre favorite song of my father and [Music] at the cross at

am happy all the day now with us our founding Pastor God bless you feel safe well well Jesus it wasn't your sacrifice that's why when when that life went out foreign to the its original owners that's why the phone moves because the light moves and what foreign I get so burned out at home and when I go to churches and I hear them well which blood are you gonna apply to this church has to be a sacrificial lamb um oh yes we'll see where does it come from the one that was in his body went to the elements where is this one going to come from oh my I shouldn't bring this to the church even foreign I can't get close to somebody I am partial in the church I take sides with certain families Islam which we know is in the veins it's your life it's your life and he says apply it is what does the door pose do okay go to the scriptures the shepherd IL Pastor he's the door Elizabeth yes or no see oh no if if he's the doors has braces that keeps the building up all the weight of the building is upon the linto and the North Poles that's why Jesus said my burn is easy and he says put put the Lord upon me or put your Burns upon me well then when you have a burden don't you pray and put him to Jesus you come and put them shoulders and what does that man become Prophet says it's a burden carrier it is for the burden of the people amen now if you'll understand it that was something that died and to become a linto that tree had to die to make the lentils a man so you take something dead and apply it to something dead yes they say well he required the blood of Jesus absolutely absolutely for Redemption amen nobody else could do it Lord Jesus Christ is it still the Lord yes see when the person dies he becomes self-sacrificial so that that blood can be applied if you think I'm crazy leave me alone I'm not crazy local exactly what I'm talking about a man in the Millennium in millennium all right I'm gonna leave that token for a while and we come back and uh the the the on the six-fold purpose and it's proposito Gabriel's visit today and in the sixth one in the sexto is to anoint the most holy isanto and right away the Mind goes to Jesus it is Jesus he's the Holy One I know but in this case there's something that is most holy foreign and the outer cord was a place outside a warning to the Gentiles yes so and then you find that there was the labor and you find places or here on this side there was the station of the men and then there there was places for where they where they had the animals that were to be sacrificed and then they had places where the the skin and the and the meat the different parts of the animal were taken is and then of course you pass from that into the holy place now we're speaking about the most holy and inside this uh holy place there was a curtain that separated the holy place from the outer Court of yeah [Music] but inside the holy place it had its Dimensions I believe they were about 30 by 40. and this is what this this was the place of the Levites yesterday no one else could enter that place but after that place there was another curtain and that's that's the curtain that was ripped at the crucifixion of Jesus Christ yes yes was a place called the holy of holies that's where a god Abode and and you know forgive me if I don't if I can explain it right to you but but God knows my heart but how could God just dwell in that little cloud in by that little building called the holy of holies this is where the pillar of fire would come that purifier never came to the outer court or to the holy place the whole the the pillar fire came only on on the holy of holies I want to stay with the place but the other is the holy of Holy Spirit like if I would say Lord but if I would tell you Lord of lords if I would say Kings but if I would say king of kings so then it's like saying holy place but holy of holies so then Israel they they believe in their Temple Worship in the temple worship they got problems according to the Book of Daniel and according to Saint Matthew it's an Abomination that's going on right there is and it's supposed to house the rock Isaac it's upon a little mountain called Mount Moriah or Mount Moriah and to the Muslims it's called foreign because Abraham was also also the father of the Muslims so they they said our Father Abraham but they don't believe that that he was Isaac or the blessing was upon Isaac they believe that the blessing was upon Ishmael are you with me they believe the blessing was for this for Ishmael and you cannot deny you know that God gave a special blessing to agar with Ishmael is shall be counted in Isaac man received a blessing the greatest blessings foreign directions why somebody came and kicked you out of your home when you fight for your home absolutely absolutely but you gotta fire a clean fight for a good fight all right you're still with me so then you come into the holy of holies and then you come into the holy place and my goodness foreign that's where God is came down and mad with Abraham even though the ishmaelites say that well the the Arabs saying Ishmael and they that's why they have in another Shrine they have another rock it's called a black rock yes but they claim this Blessings of Abraham and all Christians churches claim the blessings of Jesus Christ and they all say Jesus in Jesus but the blessings you're not going to get this blessings amen amen all right I I was searching and I just thought it was Scandal and I have to go to the First Kings chapter 8 and verse 22 verse we're going to read and here's the the prayer of Solomon in the temple see they they have their Temple worship all right let's find out what Abraham prayed Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord at the presence of all the congregation of Israel Israel and spread forth his hands toward Heaven Israeli extended and he said loyal there is no God like thee in Heaven above or on Earth beneath who keep his Covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their hearts Israel no ideas who has kept with thy servant David my father that thou promised him that those spakest also with thy mouth and has fulfilled it with thine hand as it is this day see Solomon here is living in his day not in tomorrow so it's not him yesterday he was talking about what he promised his father David but now he's bringing it to the presence therefore now Lord God of Israel keep with thy servant David my father that thou promised him saying there shall not fail thee a a man in my side to sit on the throne of Israel so that thy children take heed to their way that they walk before me as thou has walked before me videos watch his prayer and now of Israel let thy Work I pray thee be verified which thou spokest unto thy servant David My Father Allah watch his prayers but will God indeed dwell on the earth behold the heaven and Heaven of Heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house that I have built it is saved in his prayer how much less will you come to this house that I build cuantos foreign how God so great could form a little blood cells um pour himself in that is figure it out that's why Solomon's saying here you feel Heaven Heavens Heaven how could you come to this house well I don't want to read more that's how I'm finished go ahead and read it at home that when everything was ready foreign glory of God was sick inside the temple a man all right now let me go to the prophet a annoyed the most holy these are awesome messages I'm placing you the word this is heavy duty stuff all right anoint the most holy this may be a little strange for just a minute as many of you teachers this is not the anointing not available see he here's here's people and they say Jesus was anointed Jesus yes the Bible says that God anointed Jesus with the Holy Spirit and then we you come to the message and they said well God anointed William Branham so Jesus Christ and William Branham pardon me I don't aim to sound sacrilegious but here's Jesus and here's William Brown and the anointing is upon both of them what about us well what good does it do me if I know that William Branham is a prophet and I'm gonna go to hell but goodness do me if I know that Jesus Christ is God and Lord and he's going to send me to hell yeah he's giving us a choice okay the anointing is not Upon A man or one man m-a-n not m e nombre foreign hombres you know foreign [Music] who lives if you claim that Jesus Lives in Your Heart then you are also anointed because you got the anointing inside of you and that beautiful let's keep reading here Jesus is already Anointed The Book of Acts of Acts that God anointed Jesus with the Holy ghosts and he went around doing good and Healing The Sick and so forth Jesus is already he is Messiah what if I would tell you that Jesus is the Messiah and I am all for a messiah amen what if I was to tell you that you are little Messiah when you cannot be a messiah if you're not anointed so people are waiting for for the Millennium to be annoyed open your Bibles oh this is good Matthew the 25th chapter amen let's see how this anointing comes and six twenty five six there was a crime made behold the bright groom colors go ye out to meet him how many have gone out too many what do you mean I meet him under the evening time message and then the message then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise you give us of your oil oh there's the anointing of your oil for our Lambs are gone out they were not under they were like those people that were not Balaam that were not with the children of Israel Israel the difference between Balaam and Moses in Moses Camp they had the shot of the Kings they had the blessings of God every house that's why children must recognize we are in the hands of the message of the evening time that's the anointing now does everybody get it or is a bride waiting to receive it now the bride is receiving it and has received the anointing oil that's why if you take olive oil to pray for the sake questions that's fine but that's not perfect Faith perfect perfect and who's gonna believe it because they believe God you don't have to anoint him [Applause] and from your word [Music] of me man yes sorry amen yeah not making fun no but that's not the face why cry all you gotta do is speak the words why can't people speak the words apparently because Jesus don't dwell in there foreign [Applause] oh man when you're sick well this doesn't fermo and you call me brother Mike again Tony brother Jimmy brother Tommy Jr you don't have to tell them to anoint you sometimes you just saying that has Jesus let's finish this to the 10th verse but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go you rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready they were ready they were anointed he ain't going if you're not anointed when in with him to the marriage and I can prove to you that the marriage happens in the Millennium it doesn't happen in the Rapture people say well in the Rapture we're going to get married we're going to be married this is my beloved wife here you oh but since that wife is in that day there won't be two pastors pastores there will only be one person and we're going to see in a few minutes I know my time is gone see if I can finish it all right the door was shut and the door is your Shepherd is the shot it ain't shot right now it's gonna be shot yes Ezekiel 43 is if we can hurry a little bit here to get 43. I want to read it in in English only to save time in English and afterward he brought me to the gate even the gate that looks Lucas toward the East if you look toward the East you're going to be standing at the West sibilities it's the gate that looks to the east that's why if you you gotta be standing at the west but look at this and behold the glory of the god of Israel came from the way of the East and that's where brother run said that Jesus comes from the Easter is that right but his glory was coming from nowhere there is watch carefully and the voice was like a noise of many Waters and the Earth shine with his glory and he was according it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw even according to the vision which I saw when I came to destroy the city and the vision even like the vision that I saw by the river keyboard and I fell upon my face and the glory of the Lord came into the house watch carefully by the way of the gate whose Prospect is toward the East if he's got to be at the West he's coming to the house he's heading to this who is this that's going to this carefully versus Cinco so the spirit took me up and brought me into the inner cord and behold the glory of the Lord filled the house the house all right and I heard him speaking and unto why unto me out of the house and the man stood by me there the glory is coming like this but there's a man but are you ready he's coming to the temple but only to one man that's why that's why I'm says he said one of these days if you don't believe who this man is never be in the resurrection but believe it correctly because because people throw the return Ministry real Loosely you know like Brian Brown's coming brother that's gonna do this he's not the only one he's going to do but I know that when the glory comes it comes upon the man why the man because this man is the head is Gloria can you see that quickly quickly I I'm I I live in it because they ten Leviticus amen and here it is and Moses took the anointing oil and Anointed The Tabernacle and not all that was therein and Sanctified them and he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times and Anointed The Altar and all his vessels see everybody was anointed not just the altar everything the labor and his foot to sanctify them okay second chronicles do you love the Lord let me just hurry through this a little bit so I can turn you loose because man you you know you you you got we gotta we got a men's meeting right after every man stays here but Israel sees that is wow all right let's go another scripture in the book of Jeremiah chapter three and verse 13 verses and it says only had knowledge dying iniquity that thou has transgressed against the Lord thy God and has scattered thy ways to The Strangers under every Green Tree and you have not obeyed my voice says the Lord see here in and the one that's speaking here this is a mess in the temple of the Jews you're with me watch turn and watch what he tells Israel turn all back's leading children says the Lord for I am married unto you and I will take you one of a city and two of our family and I will bring you to Zion calcium aminovia why can't you telling them I'm gonna take you to Zion this is beautiful if you follow it all right now watch carefully we're verse what all right 14. I already read that and I will give you pastors according to my heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding but I apologize there's going to be pastores that's going to take care of cities come on come to pass when ye be multiplied and increased in the land in those days says the Lord they shall say no more the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord neither shall it come to mind neither shall they remember it neither shall they visit it neither shall they be done anymore at the time they shall call Jerusalem the Throne of the Lord and all the nations shall be gathered into it to the name of the Lord to Jerusalem neither shall they walk anymore after the imagination of their evil heart in those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel and they shall come together out of the land of the North to the land that I have given thee foreign inheritance unto your fathers read it at home this is the message to Israel Israel at the beginning the millennium yeah watch where he's going he's talking John 10 wonders just a few more and I'll turn you loose and it says listen another ship have I which are not of this fault yes he says them also I must bring okay and they shall hear my voice this Shepherd is the pastor sits on the throne it's not the Throne of David but it's very close foreign yes I do have just two more scriptures and then let's go to the Book of Revelation chapter 19. remember when brother Brown says Revelations 1-3 speaks of the church they said but you don't see the bride anymore or the church anymore until Revelations 19. I may remember him the church isn't say no more you see other things but but but if I be bold yeah I would I would tell you I see the bride from 4 through 19. but I don't see the church come on people yeah I see the bride he never said nothing about the bride the church you're like listen it's not seen anymore until Revelation 19. but then what is it that we see between 3 and 19. hi I've been contradictory yeah no all right Revelation 19 apocalypse is after these things I heard a great voice of much people they were in heaven salvation and glory and honor and power unto the Lord our God nuestro and you keep breathing then continually and then and then verse seven let us be glad now now the great has been judged him again she's been judged she's been bombed this country has been bombed not not somebody don't go out here saying that I'm I'm a terrorist or something yeah I just believe God so the Judgment has come because they said who is okay so then for three and a half years I know that you can find places where he said Jose it looks like he says that we go to the marriage supper of the Lamb Allah okay hi that's fine you want to believe that that's fine because I know we meet him in the air amen but then verse 7. and then it changes in verse 11. you gotta watch your sequences here it's changing it from from one scene is to another I find three sins in Revelation 19. let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is his wife had made herself ready you see Brian Paris Rapture of the church we're ready and we go to the marriage now marriage is I'm here [Music] so that you can see who My bride is pride has made herself ready man this is heavy I'm drunk right it's so special the wife has made herself ready let's suppose a um and he said but it is why brother Peridot you know how to read brother Branham said that when you get engaged to a girl he said she's as good as your wife already yeah he said the only difference is the marriage hasn't been consumed and then they say well all right and to her was granted that she should be arraigned in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he said unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he says unto me these are the true sayings of God is but Watch What Happens here you don't see Jesus in Corporal body read your Bible right and I fell to his feet to worship Him and he said unto me testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus he's the spirit of Prophecy spirit and we met him in the air and we have a very supper and actually there's a marriage performance don't you know that your pastor is your husband William that's why he says don't worship me foreign I have laid the foundation and another bill that thereon see he's not the only one building it's okay but somebody else said let every man take heed how he buildeth they're upon it is [Music] he'll give you the keys he said I had it built for you even though he paid for it okay but the contractor build it all right number now watch this in verse 11 we're told for other Foundation can no man laid and that is laid which is Jesus Christ we would be crazy to leave Jesus Christ but I can show you where the church they rejected the Cornerstone Jesus did him in this evening the effect of the world see here they want to see Jesus oh no John failed to worship the man it wasn't Jesus because it belongs to the man amen now if any man build upon the foundation of Muslim Ingress gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble versus Every Man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sword it is if any man's work abide which he have built there upon he shall receive a reward if any man work shall be burned it shall suffer laws but he himself shall be saved yet so is by fire I know ye know ye not that you are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you and if any men defile the temple of God him shall God destroy for the temple of God is Holy which Temple you are may God bless you guys
