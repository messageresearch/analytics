song says it says if it wasn't for the bad times we would never know how to appreciate the good times it's such a privilege to be here tonight bring God's word to God's children such an honor yes and tonight I'm gonna try to get you to use your thinking caps a little bit and I would like to start off in the scripture by going to Colossians chapter one and I'm sure you saw the title of the message the firstborn from and we know that our our pastor puts on the firstborn among many brothers but I would like this little over help us tie those two things together tonight and we start with verse 15 actually yeah many of us have read this over and over videos it's good to see all the Bibles open is who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature it is amen next verse please for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in the earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and foreign [Music] foreign and she is before all things and by him all things consist yes now how about verse 18. and here's the head of the body the church like Iglesia the four walls us who is the beginning of the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence amen amen let us pray Lord Jesus we thank you Lord for your word tonight we so humbly approach it Lord I feel a little nervous tonight because I know your children hang on to every word that has been spoken by our Prophet yes and written in Europe where the Holy Bible yes and Lord we just waited you with this anoint us to speak only your words in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen and amen amen you may be seated now we're going to turn to Colossians chapter three amen amen verses 10 and 11 verses yes and have put on the new man which is renewed in the knowledge after the image of him that created plan where there is neither Greek nor Jew circumcision or uncircumcision Barbarian I don't know if I say this word right Guardian Bond nor free but Christ watch this Christ is all and in all right [Music] God's perfect family tree our world familiar Perfecto how many believe you're a part of that perfect family tree part and as we get into it we're going to find out how is it that we can truly love one another and why many times we really don't love one another correctly correct my hand first so I'm not throwing this there's nobody it's because we don't understand is God's family tree familiar de dios should have been established the other videos in the Book of Genesis according to the plan of God acuerdo God had in his mind how this family tree would come and how that each person in this family tree is eternal life would never die can you imagine say mahina if your family would never die just think about it now before I go a little more into that I want to go to one final scripture in Revelation 1 5 apocalypses Uno Cinco man as you can see I'm doing a turtle walk tonight because to me this is delicate very delicate to what we're going into is there how many will pray for me amen praise the Lord man and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful Witness and the first begotten of the Dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins and his own blood either has a crystal test now notice here it uses not the expression born from the dead Muertos born from the dead first born from the dead it uses the expression the firstborn of the dead he said how could he be dead what death is it talking about right here it's not talking just about a natural death but he was the firstborn of the dead because he took our penalty upon himself and the death that was dominating our life the spiritual death la muerte so he had to take upon him the death of our Disobedience just to start but now I want to ask you a few questions I want to see if you can follow me in this okay what was one of the most important New Year's messages that brother Brennan ever preached important that's a very general statement he preached a lot of them right declaration well I'll give you a hint that's what she said and I always wanted to be loved huh no well one more hint um it was a message that he used the opening scripture of Ephesians 4 11-13 that is that helps it was just opening scripture huh you must be born again could you put up that quote from you must be born again because if we're going to talk about God's family God's family tree it's got to be a family that's so in love with God and one another amen that's why I'm doing what I'm doing let's read it here and I've always wanted to be loved when I was a little boy I wasn't locked by nobody in my career nobody had use for me here in Indiana born in Kentucky in Indiana in Kentucky I'm gonna skip down a little bit and I was in Off cast in the family an offcast in school at work I was in Off cast and then finally when I found somebody that really loved me it is Jesus Jesus he said I'll give you fathers and brothers and Friends The Amigos well we're talking about God's family tree right because he is the first born from the dead Entre los Muertos and as we read there in Colossians why was he the first born from the dead that he might have the preeminence amen amen now I remember how many remember Sunday the quote where brother Brennan said that cane should have been the first born amen see amen also Esau should have been the firstborn the man is and I'm sure the majority of you heard what I said because Caleb said you're scared not me but you don't know amigo no I disagree and it's not that I disagreed but I was seeing what I'm bringing tonight but he preached last first and I said no wait but according to the place you know this they should have been the firstborn to open the womb you know I think Satan was kind of surprised why did God Institute this law of the birthright and the firstborn is and the birth rate is why would he Institute that after what I did in the Garden of Eden for Kansas City notice that law was not instituted after what happened after this his first born but not the first born amen oh so who was or who should have been the firstborn uh in the Book of Genesis in the liberal of the Hennessy yeah I'll see if I get any versier everybody okay how many would like to know it's it's in the word it's in the message but before we do that let's do this and this is talking about our families and how much we love our families of London Familia you men you love your wives like esposas you would do anything why you love her so much you would never hurt her you would do anything for your children and maybe if you're the father that just has one son and you're so interested that that son grows up to be the right kind of a man that he comes to find out that he's a Son of God and your daughters you love them so much because expression we love them so much and that father that has only one son yes he knows that the only way tree will contain ERS chooses the right woman or a wife and then his family tree will continue now how many of you then would consider how do you think that God feels then about his family they're so familiar doesn't he want the very best for us I know just as simple I wanted to stay simple because it's gonna yeah use your goggles and you we might have to jump in a little bit how many how many would like to to take a dive in the ocean God's love amen so God's family tree now let's go to Ephesians chapter three verses 17 through 21. and we all are say Amen to this with everything with God that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith how is Christ gonna dwell in Your Heart by Revelation it's not just going to visit there he's going to dwell there if you have faith or revelation amen yes the same scripture that ye being rooted and grounded in love it says may be able to comprehend what All Saints what is the breadth the length and depth and height is oh my oh yeah this is not just anything and to know the love of Christ what is that you might be filled with all the fullness of God now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that's out in the universe somewhere yeah can you give me the diverse back Brothers now to him that is able to exceedingly abundantly above all give all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us and to him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages world without endos amen amen oh we see here then Paul catches a glimpse and it's not just seeing the church of his time he knows he's not seeing the sons of butter Sons and Daughters of God of only the Church of Baptists the Church of God and what he sees this church of all ages in pain wow I believe he was seeing what should have happened in the Book of Genesis and now we're going to start getting in a little bit are you ready ready pins ready this was not us message ready God spoken word is the Original Seed paragraph 188 Regional amen now watch this now notice now in this God foresaw it's cutting it off a predestinated world full of Sons and Daughters of God he predestinated them to be there but because of hybriding just believe in God's word is God has to put it right back again that you don't have to be a hybrid anymore you can come right back to the original word and be a Son of God just the way you were supposed to be at the beginning studied this yet this is a little greek for you but if you go study the message God's spoken word is the original series he did that in his first setting when he said you see the message when he barely accepted the message he saw that book in my little shelf there that I had in the garage well could I have that why sure brother well if you don't like it make sure you bring it back but if you like it you can keep it you know six hours a message at one time I guess he was a little bit hungry are you hungry for the word of God or has the word of God become a common thing we're so used to seeing God do so many things foreign amen amen so see God saw this world full of Sons and Daughters of God yes but because of the hybriding of his word the disbelieving of his words that perfect family tree never formed and Genesis Satan interrupted the program brother he said the whole thing Shattered by disbelieving foreign he goes now what happened God had a perfect law yes in the beginning he said the way you should have been here in the beginning but why you should have been here why was that beginning in the beginning that would bring the birth but the truth Sons and Daughters of God and now we can see Moses and all the prophets they're looking back to Genesis true and they can see what happened there they can see how the enemy deceived Eve foreign would not destroy him but he knew that God could hurt oh he entered the blame himself how many of us are willing to take the blame what our ugly family situation arises I'm right and you're wrong I'm right and you're wrong you know I would rather be wrong don't want to be wrong necessarily but I would rather be wrong but the opportunity yeah we're talking about God's family trees I can remember when I first married my wife one day I told her I've always been a weird guy I don't know how to say weird in Spanish and I told her you know one of these days honey you're gonna realize that God's family was uh is more family is Mas Familia than family okay Familia no I'm not saying no if your family is in the message in the word but man you are blessed is I have my parents Padres I have cousins single Primos just like all of you and I've shared the message with many of them and I'm the only one that believes so I was kind of like I'm not cast in my own family um when I accepted this message and stood for it I lost everything that was dear to me in this life I was down like nobody is had such an inferiority complexion anybody think that you're inferior too well you know what a lot of people have a superiority complex Superior anybody oh no response no no I can't not consistent amen man I don't really think in our heart we feel that way but sometimes when we turn our backs on one another and sometimes maybe we see a brother or sister make a mistake I don't want to get dirty that's not the love that's in God's family noises are you ready I got you on suspenders suspenders penguin suspense so who should have been that firstborn son let's go to god-spoken word the original see original paragraph 134. and now there's some rock language here Hospital but it's God speaking through His prophets in no way any disrespect to any of our sisters you remember there's a difference between a lady and just a plain wolf and you my precious sisters so as we read this foreign is this paragraph 134 or 34. and that's not even okay let's see if they can get this straightened out yeah so you weren't ahead at Market you want the 188 paragraph 134 yes can you go down further well if I got the wrong one for them I'm sorry guys I'm just gonna quote to you do you have it which one is it oh yeah that's this is this paragraph here is not 134 gentlemen thank you brother paragraph 134 you see what I mean it is the germ that comes from the sea is he is he is the word of God made perfectly manifest is that's the reason that in him was okay that was the thing that is now listen he is correctly the son from the first Adam was the son that was promised through Adam continue on the human race Jesus was the son of the first Adam Jesus Promised through Adam so that tells me this is Adam as the Son of God as a little God on Earth he had already spoken the word that would have produced the word child he even proceed so Jesus then in Princess Jesus truly what a band of yellow the firstborn El primogenito of the human race De La Raza Salman it could not been able because Abel came under a pervasive Covenant after the fall well God's plan for his family was gonna be born now let's continue he continue on the human race and brought forth a generation I know these words were up a bastard children without life and Jesus comes and what's that see if he proved it everything that Adam lost Jesus was estaban Jesus he is the correct now watch this Eve what a funny brought that child forth Eva finalment but she hybrided it the serpent listening to wisdom understanding enough no wonder Lucifer was so interested in the firstborn let me ask you some more questions almost 30 minutes I'm doing good so far if Jesus would have been the first son born would that our blood in stained what a deaf interlins by the blood would there ever have been a family fight would there ever been an argument between the husband and wife and the children arguments everything would have been perfect everything would have been in harmony that would be such a love oh yeah we are una more and notice it was to continue on the human race look you're insulting our intelligence my name is I'm trying to get you to think if he was to continue on the human race the blood that flowed in his veins Familia but we can't see it that way you say in Spanish oh my family is better than yours somebody's in the God's family is better than somebody else maybe I'm just too simple we would literally be belated and I've always said this is and I'll say it again because the Holy Spirit baptize me into the bodies and placed me exactly where I should have been in the beginning so I feel right at home you're my brother and sisters Blood Brothers well they dance up a storm come on they are literally related I'm not related to you know I'm not a German I'm not Dutch I'm not polish polish I'm not French nothing a Cherokee Indian In Me what race are your brothers Heinz 57 varieties 57. but inside of me there is a seed from the beginning so when I see you I see myself you don't make it if I believe I can make it you can believe and if I can't believe that is getting a little whatever happened to that word paragraphs 177. go back to 177 please it was this 178 well yeah that's 178 is fine finally this word cut into the womb of our words [Music] that it didn't find no place to land no in control when I got to eat what's her name was it yet she wasn't the mother of all living yeah no place to dwell no in control they have to travel for 2000 years yeah and what you see happen with Mary and Joseph only shows you what would have happened in the Book of Genesis and the good tidies came to her it was when us you are very greatly favored it is oh how am I gonna have this son oh the spirit of almighty God what will be born foreign he was born through the womb of a woman because his Spirit had to come be a witness what was he witnessed he would witness the Virgin birth he wouldn't witness the Immaculate Conception this uh immaculada he was witness to the stegos of the birth that he should have had well penis what about you and me yeah you steady me are we the Virgin Bride of the Lord Jesus do we believe God's words Corazon Satan was really compounding because he finally realized all these people that are so full of the devil a lot of them were first born they were born first and their whole family is so you were gonna Ascend upon the high uh you would have sent to the Mountain of God now you'll be cast down here now you will be cast down to the Earth because God's had something else going I'll go for this we've got to go to the world preeminence foreign amen Colossians 1. in English verse verse 15. who is the image of the invisible God is invisible the firstborn a very creature I'm not going to even touch that I kind of got a feeling our pastor still might have something on that yeah I think I'll just leave that one alone look yes foreign I'm just being your brother I'm not trying to be no um no no for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in the Earth visible invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things that should tell you right there that he's the first of all creatures and by him all things consistent next verse and he is the head of the body people say well he's my head nobody to tell me what to do no you don't understand the body is you know well I can just receive so-and-so but I can't receive this other brother the place and then it comes time to the Lord's supper and in First Corinthians 11 says that many are asleep which means they've actually gone on there is because they discern not the head they don't discern the body but the reason we're going to come to partake of the Lord's Supper participants is because we are participating of the revelation of this world the revelation of the blood the Holy Spirit came out of that blood yes death that bread made by Christian hands is that I can discern that my brother my sister of the body is I can discern that this is part of God's family tree well this is the first born from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence Give me the definition of three minutes again real quick and we're going to be done definition Supremo dignity or importance Supreme outstanding sobre saliente and do you have the word Paramount there it is Superior to all others as we heard Sunday that firstborn wasn't just talking about the first one that opened the womb is he was talking about a ranko but I wasn't just talking about any brain it was the Lord himself the one that's most outstanding give me that last quote out of Christ is the mystery of God revealed and Christianity there's much more that can be said he have understood a little bit how many know that through Redemption and restoration restoration because you're predestinated it takes you back to where you would be destinated that you can find out what part of God's family tree and the only way he could have their preeminence it would have to be the first born from and say this together and make it personal personal and through that purpose foreign Church yo that he the fullness of God might bring to pass every promised word of God in these last days when he gets the preeminances preeminence in the church the position the position his place in the church and the Iglesia the firstborn from among Gods perfect family Lord Jesus we just thank you tonight for your word Lord we thank you that you sent us a prophets that could go beyond the curtain of time that could stand on the banner of Eternity and you can see your perfect plan perfect and he can tell us how it should have been you know and how we should have come into this world to produce God's perfect family foreign a minute
