[13:31] Simplicity of
[13:34] Life tell me what power does
[13:37] it so now I ask you do you see Jesus in
[13:41] your life God bless
[13:44] [Applause]
[13:52] you and God bless you good
[13:57] morning
[13:59] it's not easy to come up
[14:03] here but overall I am grateful with the
[14:09] Lord the best thing is to be
[14:13] obedient and that is what motivates me
[14:16] to be
[14:19] obedient the Lord has done so many
[14:21] things in my
[14:23] life that I am more than
[14:27] grateful
[14:29] and just the fact of being here with you
[14:31] as a family it is a great
[14:34] blessing and I'm here to
[14:37] testify of of how great he
[14:44] is as you know our brother Diego a great
[14:46] man of
[14:48] God with the gifts that the Lord has
[14:50] given him to help
[14:54] us many times they are for us but not
[14:57] for him
[14:59] we know that because of the
[15:03] message some days
[15:07] back he he uh discerned the spirit of
[15:10] the
[15:12] sciatic I was one of
[15:15] them that had the problem with that
[15:19] nerve brother Diego he would ask me and
[15:21] tell me he'd ask me how do you tell me
[15:24] the truth be
[15:27] sincere
[15:34] and I told them brother I I do have some
[15:38] pain when you
[15:40] prayed and you discerned that
[15:43] Spirit something was let
[15:47] loose something that was very buried in
[15:50] there and when it was taken
[15:53] out it left a deep
[15:56] hole that still hurts
[16:00] but that doesn't mean that I'm not
[16:01] healed I am
[16:04] healed because it teaches us the
[16:08] message that when it hurts the
[16:11] most is because that demon has left our
[16:13] body what I had it is dead and it it it
[16:20] stinks what the message
[16:23] says and let me also tell
[16:26] you the closer we get to
[16:30] the attacks will be
[16:33] hard he'll attack in the way that you
[16:35] least
[16:47] expect and I tell my wife we're going to
[16:49] go have some dinner with with our
[16:52] buddies she said let's
[16:54] go and there may not be many of
[16:57] us
[16:59] but we gather together around a table
[17:02] that's that's you that's a a
[17:05] joy many times we just look at each
[17:10] other but that doesn't mean we're not
[17:12] attentive to what's
[17:14] moving God has promised in his
[17:17] word where there are two or three there
[17:20] I will
[17:21] be and he dines with us on
[17:26] Friday we were together having
[17:30] dinner and we were speaking about the
[17:34] word and when we were conversating about
[17:36] the
[17:38] word sometimes I don't like to
[17:43] speak because sometimes I say some
[17:45] things that I say why am I saying
[17:48] this but they're speaking with
[17:52] them there there was this cold that came
[17:55] to me that started at my feet
[17:59] I began to feel very
[18:01] cold and I didn't listen to
[18:04] it I stood up I went to the
[18:07] bathroom and I said leave me alone
[18:11] whether you like it or not we are his
[18:14] children so you have to leave you're not
[18:17] invited
[18:20] here and I went back to the table we
[18:22] continued
[18:24] talking but I felt that
[18:26] cold in my mind
[18:29] it it just felt
[18:31] cold went
[18:34] home and I began to feel very
[18:39] bad I felt my my stomach swell up and my
[18:44] mind oh the food
[18:48] was the food was bad and I said no it
[18:50] wasn't the food it is
[18:54] you that pain came that I've recognized
[18:59] that is called
[19:01] pneumonia it wanted to come to torment
[19:05] me and I felt sick and my
[19:09] wife and I tell my wife don't be
[19:12] alarmed something happens don't be
[19:15] alarmed everything is
[19:17] okay we are in his
[19:20] hands I went to go lay
[19:23] down and praying Lord what do I
[19:26] do the Lord tells me

[19:36] church let me tell you about these gifts

[24:53] year and I so happy to be with people
[24:58] that I will spend an eternity
[25:03] with but but today we're going to change
[25:09] gears because for the last three
[25:13] months we've heard such tremendous
[25:16] preaching from this
[25:21] pulit from Phoenix the Phoenix from
[25:25] South America the sou America from
[25:27] Mexico the Mexico and Wednesday from
[25:30] tuon
[25:34] Mir you know what Danny I couldn't
[25:37] compete with none of
[25:40] them yeah cuz Denny is a tremendous
[25:47] preacher
[25:49] but nobody gives more uh scripture than
[25:53] I do in this
[25:56] congregation
[25:58] because when I get behind
[26:02] here I want to be sure that it's thus
[26:05] say the
[26:08] Lord that's why I give so many
[26:12] scriptures so because our
[26:17] messages are not only to the local
[26:21] congregation amen so you pray for
[26:25] me so not to have you
[26:30] standing this will be my fifth lesson on
[26:34] the interruption of
[26:40] Nature and if you be so
[26:42] kind open your
[26:45] Bibles to Revelations
[26:49] 612 apocalyps 6
[26:56] do and I be held when he had opened the
[26:59] six seal and L there was a great
[27:02] earthquake and the sun became black as s
[27:06] cloth of hair and the moon became his
[27:22] blood let's read one more
[27:26] scripture say Matthew
[27:30] 24 verse 21 and
[27:36] 22 for then shall be Great
[27:39] Tribulation such as was not since the
[27:42] beginning of the world to this time no
[27:46] nor ever it shall
[27:56] be
[27:58] and except those days should be
[28:00] shortened there should be no flesh saved
[28:03] but for the elect sake those days shall
[28:06] be
[28:16] shortened the Lord add his Blessing to
[28:18] the reading the word you may be
[28:26] seated good to see you
[28:28] Henry Henry my good friend
[28:34] Henry he's if you want to F From Here to
[28:38] Eternity make an appointment and
[28:44] he'll I remember when I was in
[28:48] Alaska and we used to go we went on a
[28:51] 200 mil SK
[28:56] Patrol
[28:59] and we travel with those Cross Country
[29:05] Skis how do you say
[29:13] somebody and those skis are not like
[29:16] they using the Olympics or the ski that
[29:18] are about this
[29:23] size they were about twice that long
[29:32] anyway after we were through with a 200
[29:36] M ski
[29:42] patrol it was because when I was in
[29:44] Alaska it had barely become a
[29:51] state so there was a lot of Uncharted
[29:56] Territory
[30:01] and because we were the top company in
[30:04] the
[30:11] Battalion they send
[30:15] us and by the time where's
[30:19] Ruby
[30:22] Ruby where are
[30:26] you mom and dad oh okay I'm sorry
[30:30] Ruby you know where we stopped when we
[30:36] finished a town called
[30:40] Ruby Ruby in an all abandoned
[30:46] Schoolhouse and we were so
[30:51] tired that they took us to a little
[30:56] meow
[31:00] and one after another those small planes
[31:03] that they use in
[31:07] Alaska alas because Alaska is a state
[31:10] that has more plane crashes than any
[31:12] other
[31:16] state
[31:18] why you a lot of you can only travel a
[31:21] lot of times just in a
[31:25] plane and I could not
[31:30] believe they would fly and stop like in
[31:33] a poage
[31:39] St and I remember Henry telling
[31:43] me the the pilots of Alaska are the best
[31:47] pilots in the world right
[31:50] Henry correct Henry so but for some
[31:55] reason God still has me here
[32:01] and when he opened the sick
[32:05] seal there was a great
[32:10] earthquake Where have we heard of the
[32:15] earthquake and let me warn you this
[32:20] morning since we're changing gears this
[32:25] morning we're you better know how to
[32:28] swim because I'm going to take you
[32:30] through deep
[32:34] water St Matthew
[32:41] 2750 Jesus when he cried again with a
[32:45] loud voice yielded up The
[32:55] Ghost and behold the veil of the temple
[32:58] was ran in Twain From the top to the
[33:01] bottom and the Earth did quake in the
[33:18] Rocks can't eat that and the graves were
[33:21] open and many bodies of the Saints which
[33:24] slept AR Rose
[33:32] and says that the tombs were
[33:37] open so the question to you
[33:41] people who was in the
[33:46] Tomb now like I I've been teaching all
[33:49] these young
[33:53] ministers because that's my
[33:55] commission
[33:57] given to me by the founding
[34:01] Pastor to make bullet for all these
[34:03] young
[34:06] ministers and what I've taught
[34:10] them to not just read the Bible just
[34:14] from a
[34:19] book but you reading
[34:23] history bring it to right now
[34:29] bring it to the present
[34:33] time the Bible
[34:36] says when the veil was
[34:41] torn he told Jesus on the
[34:45] cross and they were singing
[34:50] hyn you imagine They Crucified
[34:54] him and they were singing him H to him
[34:57] the one that they
[35:03] crucified why was a veil
[35:08] tone did you have a veil
[35:15] on how many thieves on the
[35:20] cross and I ask a question this
[35:24] morning which Thief was you on the
[35:32] cross oh you said that none of those
[35:34] were were me I
[35:39] was ah but remember there was
[35:48] a St Luke
[35:55] 2339
[35:57] and one of the maleactors which were
[36:00] hang ra on him saying if thou be Christ
[36:03] save
[36:17] thyself I can prove that all of
[36:22] you and
[36:24] myself were was that Thief
[36:31] you put a
[36:34] veil what is the
[36:36] Veil The
[36:38] Flesh you
[36:40] know you could even see that who was
[36:44] there
[36:53] in but the other answering rebuke came
[36:57] saying does not thou fear God sin thou
[36:59] are in the same
[37:02] [Music]
[37:23] condemnation I got to take care thank
[37:26] you
[37:36] gracias it's my
[37:38] body it's me
[37:43] comp we were out in the
[37:47] world we couldn't see none of
[37:52] this but let let let not me go ahead of
[37:56] myself
[38:03] notice
[38:06] we when we were in
[38:11] denomination we were in the
[38:14] Tomb you this why say who was in the
[38:25] Tomb
[38:27] we had a
[38:30] veil in those
[38:33] times we only thought that the
[38:38] Pentecostal and when I say
[38:41] Pentecostal I also means
[38:46] Apostolic the apostolic church was a
[38:49] Spanish version of
[38:55] the and when me and the founding Pastor
[38:58] were pastors of the apostolic
[39:03] church we only we only thought that what
[39:07] we were the only one that had the
[39:12] truth so that's why I says when we were
[39:16] on the
[39:19] cross but
[39:22] notice that's why brother
[39:25] Brandon preached the
[39:28] message I indict this generation for the
[39:32] second crucifixion of Jesus
[39:39] Christ we were crucifying him
[39:44] again that's why we were on the
[39:48] cross what were we
[39:52] crucifying we were crucifying the effect
[39:56] of the
[39:59] message because we thought that we only
[40:03] preach the
[40:07] truth but how were we going to get out
[40:11] of the
[40:15] Tomb Matthew
[40:22] 28 in the end of the Sabbath and it
[40:25] began to John toward the first day of
[40:28] the week Came Mary Magdalene and the

[44:25] note
[44:27] when I had the when I was your age I
[44:29] took notes to see where the girls lived
[44:32] I would take down a note to see where
[44:33] the girls lived or where there were the
[44:35] dance
[44:39] halls or or the bars I'm I'm ashamed of
[44:44] it but God had to take me out of the of

[46:08] Dan and in the 420 day of the first
[46:11] month as I was by the side of the Great
[46:14] River which is

[46:51] his face has appearance of lightning and
[46:55] and his eyes as lamps of fire and his
[46:59] arms and his feet like a collar of
[47:02] polished breast and the voice of his
[47:04] words like the voice of a
[47:23] multitude I am read this
[47:27] scriptures so you if God give you the
[47:30] Revelation so you can see who was this
[47:34] angel that took you out of the
[47:41] Tomb but brother L that's the Old
[47:45] Testament well brother

[48:48] with a peps with a golden
[48:54] girdle

[52:45] elementary
[52:46] school well let's see if you are or
[52:50] not I'm not judging
[52:53] you the word is judging
[52:57] you Hebrews
[53:03] 5 for when for the time you are to be
[53:07] teachers oh my
[53:12] God you have needed one teach you
[53:18] again which be the first
[53:24] principles
[53:27] and my Bible does not say
[53:30] that which be the
[53:34] elementary
[53:40] teaching that's what the Greek
[53:43] says but your King James version it says
[53:46] the first
[53:51] principes but the Greek Bible says the
[53:54] element El
[54:00] principles of the Oracles of God and
[54:03] become such as have need of milk and not
[54:07] a strong
[54:15] meat look
[54:24] sistera
[54:29] I can't hear what you're
[54:31] saying okay go ahead I'm sorry I just
[54:33] didn't hear any of
[54:35] that let me pray for you
[54:39] okay no I like my
[54:42] no Lorena is like a second
[54:50] mother she bought brought me bought me a
[54:52] BB one
[54:54] time because I would
[54:56] slobber look
[55:00] Mary the word is so
[55:03] delicious sometimes they just slobber
[55:05] all over the
[55:09] place I can see your husband do the same
[55:11] thing in his wife in his
[55:14] mouth we we're cut by the same pair of
[55:16] scissors amen amen that's
[55:21] right the
[55:24] word
[55:25] [Music]
[55:27] my god
[55:34] oh it notice
[55:38] Elementary
[55:41] why Hebrews
[55:50] 61 therefore living the
[55:53] elementary Prin principles of the
[55:56] doctrine of Christ let us go into
[56:07] Perfection if you don't reach Perfection
[56:10] how are you going to get to the top of
[56:12] the
[56:18] pyramid if you only like cookies and
[56:23] cream
[56:26] you you're never going to
[56:29] advance you need strong
[56:33] meat I told Caleb
[56:36] once this happened a few years
[56:41] ago there are some people that criticize
[56:44] that say that I go too deep for
[56:51] them and Caleb
[56:53] said you know
[56:57] Tio that we have a bunch of eagles that
[57:00] need strong me in our
[57:07] congregation
[57:11] notice so why do we need strong meat
[57:20] now if the days were not cut short
[57:27] but for the elect
[57:31] sake the days will be cut
[57:36] short some of
[57:39] us will probably have our days cut
[57:46] short how many have you had
[57:52] relatives that their days were cut
[57:56] short and you know why their days were
[57:59] cut
[58:01] short in order for them to be
[58:07] saved not to make
[58:12] bride to be
[58:18] saved and you could you know you have
[58:21] had relatives that have gone young for a
[58:23] either
[58:25] because of a disease or cancer or
[58:27] something one way or
[58:34] another because God
[58:38] knowing because not even a li from a
[58:41] tree can fall without God
[58:46] knowing how
[58:48] come I remember when I was in the
[58:50] apostolic
[58:52] chch and I would say is God
[58:58] unjust how can he hate Esau without
[59:01] giving him a
[59:06] chance when they were still you
[59:11] know they hadn't been
[59:14] born he hated Esau and loved
[59:19] Jacob God knows your beginning to your
[59:23] end
[59:26] so he knows that if certain reties
[59:30] something happen or let him live
[59:33] something would
[59:37] happen and I could say more on that but
[59:40] let's
[59:44] go but here this
[59:47] scripture and like I
[59:51] said it's compound it's comp
[59:55] it is talking about the
[1:00:01] 144,000 because they are
[1:00:05] 144,000 by the time that they see that
[1:00:09] they had been
[1:00:13] wrong and then when Moses and Elijah
[1:00:19] came and introduce the message to
[1:00:23] them
[1:00:25] and they
[1:00:26] accepted their days were C
[1:00:32] short
[1:00:34] days
[1:00:36] 1,260 days they
[1:00:40] had
[1:00:41] months they only had 42 months to
[1:00:47] go
[1:00:48] years only three and a half years that's
[1:00:51] all you
[1:00:53] got they day days were
[1:00:57] cured but for the elect
[1:01:01] sake they were
[1:01:04] Cur how about the foolish
[1:01:10] virgin have we got any foolish virgins
[1:01:13] in this
[1:01:16] congregation the founding
[1:01:22] Pastor correct me mik if I say this
[1:01:24] wrong
[1:01:25] then the founding Pastor say there
[1:01:28] should be no foolish virgins in this
[1:01:35] congregation can you imagine the
[1:01:37] teachings and the preachings that have
[1:01:39] come behind this
[1:01:44] Pulpit you know what Henry
[1:01:47] Henry your father has a lot of
[1:01:52] Revelation but one of the last things he
[1:01:55] said from behind the
[1:02:04] pulpit what he said what is preached
[1:02:06] behind this
[1:02:09] Pulpit is not heard in other places you
[1:02:12] know not we're not saying there there to
[1:02:16] exalt
[1:02:20] anybody for a
[1:02:23] reason you
[1:02:25] know we know that the founding
[1:02:29] Pastor he left a standard
[1:02:34] here I haven't heard nobody teach like
[1:02:37] that
[1:02:39] man is that right
[1:02:42] Mike he's the greatest teacher that I
[1:02:45] ever
[1:02:48] heard so he left a
[1:02:53] standard
[1:02:55] I tell
[1:02:56] Caleb Caleb I see you back
[1:03:02] there and it's just like I'm seeing my
[1:03:05] brother preach back
[1:03:10] there well what Spirit anointed brother
[1:03:17] Brenham he come on the spirit of
[1:03:21] Elijah so Caleb doesn't he coming also
[1:03:25] on the spirit of his
[1:03:29] father yeah put two and two
[1:03:32] together that's why he looks so much
[1:03:34] like his father back
[1:03:37] here oh I just love when Caleb Gets
[1:03:40] behind
[1:03:42] her I said the SP image of his
[1:03:47] father
[1:03:49] notice than see how fortunate we
[1:03:52] are that we have get an
[1:03:56] apostle not to put the church in
[1:04:00] order to put the word in
[1:04:09] order there's a a pastor in Lima
[1:04:13] Peru Lima per oh he almost begs me to go
[1:04:17] to T
[1:04:21] Lima oh because they got a new
[1:04:26] Doctrine
[1:04:27] about saying that
[1:04:31] Joseph is the new
[1:04:34] prophet and I I don't know if they put
[1:04:36] him as the eighth
[1:04:41] messenger and the last time that the
[1:04:43] founding Pastor went over
[1:04:46] there he said I'll never go back to
[1:04:52] Lima because all you
[1:04:54] ministers can't see one another and
[1:05:00] have okay let's leave that
[1:05:07] alone the foolish
[1:05:11] virgins will be their days cut short
[1:05:15] also CU soon as after the
[1:05:19] Rapture
[1:05:21] remember brother renom said
[1:05:26] the foolish virgins should be
[1:05:32] glad that there is an atomic bomb
[1:05:35] waiting for
[1:05:37] them do that say the
[1:05:41] prophet so the days are going to be
[1:05:45] cured and when the sick seal was
[1:05:49] open there was a great
[1:05:52] earthquake and all nature was
[1:05:56] interrupted I don't have
[1:05:59] time to speak on this
[1:06:03] earthquake the Lord
[1:06:05] willing I will explain in another
[1:06:10] message but notice
[1:06:12] here Revelation
[1:06:14] [Music]
[1:06:19] 121p and there appeared a great Wonder
[1:06:22] in heaven of woman clothed with the sun
[1:06:26] and the moon under her feet and upon her
[1:06:28] head a crown of 12
[1:06:40] stars and she been with child cry
[1:06:44] travailing in birth and pain to be
[1:06:47] delivered
[1:06:53] yes
[1:06:54] and there appeared another wonderand in
[1:06:57] heaven and behold a great red dragon
[1:07:01] heav seven heads and 10 horns and seven
[1:07:04] crowns upon his
[1:07:16] head we see two
[1:07:21] wonders a woman clothed with a
[1:07:25] son and we see a red
[1:07:31] dragon what is a
[1:07:39] Wonder
[1:07:43] amazed
[1:07:45] new a
[1:07:47] sign a
[1:07:50] mystery let's find out what the mystery
[1:07:53] is
[1:07:56] Revelation
[1:08:00] 612 and I beheld when he had opened the
[1:08:03] six seal and lo there was a great
[1:08:06] earthquake and the sun became black and
[1:08:09] said cloths of hair and the moon became
[1:08:12] his
[1:08:22] blood
[1:08:25] and the stars of Heaven fell unto the
[1:08:28] Earth even as a fig tree casteth her
[1:08:31] untimely fix when she is shaken by A
[1:08:34] Mighty
[1:08:45] Wind and when the earthquake
[1:08:50] hit the sign Sun became black as
[1:08:57] sa he was made of
[1:09:02] hair with that hair was coarse and
[1:09:09] rough not
[1:09:13] refined delicate in
[1:09:19] texture made of goat's
[1:09:22] hair
[1:09:25] It is worn as a symbol of mourning or
[1:09:33] penitence often with ashes sprinkled on
[1:09:37] the
[1:09:42] head and the whole Moon became as
[1:09:47] blood so
[1:09:50] notice here we
[1:09:52] see a black
[1:09:56] Sun but we read in Revelation
[1:10:01] 12 a woman clothed with the
[1:10:09] sun if you don't know the
[1:10:14] symbols you'll get confused and
[1:10:20] lost but let's see what's happening
[1:10:26] here John has seen a woman clothed with
[1:10:30] a
[1:10:32] son and it was
[1:10:35] shining but when he saw the six seal
[1:10:41] open he saw the same
[1:10:46] Sun closed in sa
[1:10:50] cloth for John was having
[1:10:55] a
[1:10:57] vision and Visions are
[1:11:02] symbols this woman clothed with a bright
[1:11:08] light but then that light started to
[1:11:11] fade
[1:11:15] away and that
[1:11:18] woman
[1:11:19] listen that woman clothed with a son
[1:11:25] was the Jewish Orthodox
[1:11:30] Church she had been clothed with the
[1:11:34] sun why because she was the wife of
[1:11:43] God she was a wife of
[1:11:48] God she was the
[1:11:52] begotten she was was beg God of
[1:11:56] God but she
[1:11:59] noticed but she was a wife of God and
[1:12:03] God had to put her
[1:12:07] away because some time back
[1:12:13] there on account of spiritual
[1:12:19] fornication and then he returns again
[1:12:25] and he receives her
[1:12:29] again and he mares
[1:12:33] her and what did God
[1:12:35] say that he was being married to a
[1:12:43] backslider the wife that went away from
[1:12:50] him we're going to heit that in a while
[1:12:55] so the Moon is just a shadow of the
[1:12:59] Sun and we see the Jewish Orthodox
[1:13:05] Church is fading
[1:13:11] out and the gospel is coming
[1:13:16] in and just as it's fading
[1:13:20] out notice is it is fading
[1:13:26] out there's got to be a new
[1:13:32] dispensation so the woman is with
[1:13:37] child and she's in
[1:13:41] pain travailing in
[1:13:45] pain in child
[1:13:48] birth on account of the Roman
[1:13:52] Empire
[1:13:55] so the law was fading
[1:14:00] out you know why it was fading
[1:14:04] out that was the dispensation of the
[1:14:11] candlesticks oh this is so
[1:14:17] good like
[1:14:19] I just keeps falling out of my mouth I I
[1:14:23] just love
[1:14:25] this notice the
[1:14:29] dispensations in the times of
[1:14:33] Moses there was a Tabernacle in the
[1:14:39] wilderness there was the outer
[1:14:45] cord what was the outer
[1:14:51] cord remember the the
[1:14:55] CR
[1:14:59] the oh we lived and my dad would make us
[1:15:03] go to
[1:15:08] church remember it was the dispensation
[1:15:11] of the
[1:15:15] candlesticks so we would
[1:15:19] go hating
[1:15:22] Church
[1:15:28] Elia but just when he couldn't take us
[1:15:31] to to the church that was in
[1:15:36] be there was a Southern Baptist Church
[1:15:40] that he made us
[1:15:47] go
[1:15:52] so myself and
[1:15:56] Tommy cuz my dad made us
[1:16:00] go and the Baptist Church was maybe
[1:16:04] about uh 200 yard away from our
[1:16:12] house so you walk up the
[1:16:17] steps they used to call it the southern
[1:16:19] CER Baptist
[1:16:22] Church
[1:16:23] [Music]
[1:16:25] and then we go and open the
[1:16:28] door and uh there was a like a a
[1:16:33] wall so either you went through the left
[1:16:36] or through the
[1:16:39] right but as soon as you
[1:16:42] walked there was like a holder that that
[1:16:47] they put the the the program of what was
[1:16:50] going to
[1:16:52] transpire
[1:16:57] we
[1:16:59] go and take it
[1:17:03] out and everybody got
[1:17:08] one and we walk real slow down the
[1:17:14] steps and we had to cross in a Roy and
[1:17:17] then we had to go
[1:17:18] across a royal the the creek the creek
[1:17:23] and there was a
[1:17:25] bridge so we went under the
[1:17:29] bridge well we had a cigarette we would
[1:17:31] light
[1:17:33] the if know if we didn't have one well
[1:17:37] we had to stay until 12:00
[1:17:42] noon and my dad was at the door waiting
[1:17:45] for
[1:17:50] us how did they go at church
[1:17:55] look look look that this is what they
[1:17:57] preached on
[1:17:59] God that was
[1:18:03] us so you see how far we have traveled
[1:18:09] now amen so that was the outer
[1:18:13] cord why was it the outer
[1:18:17] cord the only
[1:18:19] light was a
[1:18:21] sunlight
[1:18:23] that was the only
[1:18:27] light that was when we were the thief on
[1:18:30] the
[1:18:34] cross but when when the light
[1:18:38] came we got a little
[1:18:41] light and we started going to to
[1:18:48] church we got promoted we must
[1:18:54] we were promoted to the inner
[1:19:02] cour
[1:19:04] now oh we were
[1:19:08] somebody what was the inner
[1:19:12] Court when we went from the Baptist
[1:19:15] Church to the apostolic
[1:19:18] church because in the outer
[1:19:21] Court where they kill the
[1:19:25] sacrifice and all the blood and
[1:19:29] everything oh but in the inner
[1:19:32] court is when they bathe you with the
[1:19:35] Waters of
[1:19:38] Separation they got everything the
[1:19:40] Waters of
[1:19:42] Separation that was the Apostolic
[1:19:46] Church separated
[1:19:48] us from the drugs from the drinking from
[1:19:52] the bad word
[1:19:55] now we were going straight to
[1:19:58] heaven because we were
[1:20:01] separated and we didn't need the
[1:20:04] sun because the Sun is going to stay
[1:20:09] black we had the electric
[1:20:17] light where's the electrician back
[1:20:21] there
[1:20:24] I mean he gave a good message when he
[1:20:26] preached about
[1:20:32] electricity the dispensation of the
[1:20:38] Candlestick look at how electricity SP
[1:20:41] the
[1:20:44] electricity
[1:20:48] electricity Hector didn't we think when
[1:20:51] we were there that we were the
[1:20:56] elect yeah
[1:20:59] electricity we were the
[1:21:02] elect because we separated the all our
[1:21:06] habits that we
[1:21:09] had but
[1:21:13] notice even the Virgin Mary got to
[1:21:19] that if the Virgin Mary hadn't given the
[1:21:22] other
[1:21:26] step she would have never made
[1:21:29] it even though she was the so-call
[1:21:32] mother
[1:21:35] of that's where we
[1:21:41] were how many of you have made it to the
[1:21:44] holy of
[1:21:50] holies because uh
[1:21:55] Pentecostals they were the closest to
[1:21:58] this
[1:22:01] message you know
[1:22:06] why they got to the Head
[1:22:10] age we're living in the head
[1:22:15] age and the
[1:22:18] Pentecostals only made it to the
[1:22:21] mouth
[1:22:23] the speaking in
[1:22:26] tongues but they forgot that there's
[1:22:29] another moving part in your
[1:22:35] head and that's your
[1:22:38] eyes what is the
[1:22:40] eye a the
[1:22:44] prophet we can see all over the
[1:22:48] place that's where you and I should be
[1:23:00] much to say
[1:23:03] said let me
[1:23:14] finish when we got to the inner Court we
[1:23:17] hadn't gone far
[1:23:21] enough
[1:23:23] that's why brother bam preached the
[1:23:26] message going beyond the
[1:23:31] temp if we only got to the camp
[1:23:36] there to the holy of
[1:23:41] hly the Mana that fell from heaven where
[1:23:44] was
[1:23:47] it did he it stop in the outer
[1:23:51] Court did it sto in the inner
[1:23:54] Court no but inside the holy of
[1:23:58] holies there was man that fell from
[1:24:02] heaven this message that we preach from
[1:24:04] behind
[1:24:06] here this man that fell
[1:24:13] from
[1:24:14] notice the word did the
[1:24:20] glory and when they got to the
[1:24:22] borderline in the times of
[1:24:27] Moses they did away with a
[1:24:32] tent and it says
[1:24:36] that of
[1:24:38] Glory it went to another
[1:24:42] Tabernacle not a tabernacle made of
[1:24:47] canvas it was a tabernacle made of
[1:24:51] fles
[1:24:53] amen amen and there still so many
[1:24:57] churches that still believe on the
[1:24:59] canvas
[1:25:02] tent I don't want to mention
[1:25:05] names but this this
[1:25:09] person you know he
[1:25:12] said that they already have a semi Tru
[1:25:15] to carate the
[1:25:19] tent can you
[1:25:21] imagine thousands following this
[1:25:26] message can they make a tent big enough
[1:25:29] to put all
[1:25:32] every it doesn't make
[1:25:34] sense but thank
[1:25:37] God God showed me a golden nugget not
[1:25:40] too long
[1:25:43] ago that even Caleb said forgive me this
[1:25:48] is not to exalt
[1:25:51] myself this just God is showing these
[1:25:55] things because we're on the last
[1:25:59] days and without looking for
[1:26:03] it as I was studying there in the
[1:26:07] house God gave me this gold
[1:26:11] nugget the tent was only the first
[1:26:17] pool and you know what Cale
[1:26:21] said
[1:26:22] he said Uncle that's all you had to
[1:26:26] say when I heard that I said oh my
[1:26:31] God you could have stopped there and we
[1:26:34] could have gone home that there was
[1:26:38] enough and I wasn't looking for it just
[1:26:42] the Lord took me
[1:26:48] there I didn't know that brother what
[1:26:51] are we the still in the first
[1:26:55] pool but a lot of people still in the
[1:26:58] first
[1:26:59] pool but what is the last
[1:27:05] pool the last the third
[1:27:09] pool did Noah have a third
[1:27:14] pool did Jesus Christ have a third
[1:27:21] pool
[1:27:23] without
[1:27:24] knowing we are in the third
[1:27:30] pool you know Noah the third
[1:27:34] pool the same thing that Noah
[1:27:39] did when God shut the door on the
[1:27:47] ark what God just nobody can
[1:27:51] open
[1:27:54] Noah was preaching to
[1:27:57] them and none of them could
[1:28:01] comeing he was preaching to the totally
[1:28:12] lost see God is giving us time to repent
[1:28:15] and
[1:28:18] to I
[1:28:20] mean there will be no EXC exuse for me
[1:28:23] or all of
[1:28:26] you the messages that come here from the
[1:28:29] pastor Tommy the
[1:28:31] [Music]
[1:28:40] ministers the but
[1:28:43] now we see the woman standing there the
[1:28:46] sun rising at her
[1:28:51] head the mo moon going under her
[1:28:55] feet it's done passed
[1:28:59] away she's done living through the
[1:29:02] through the dispensation of the
[1:29:06] law oh the the law can hang up there on
[1:29:10] the
[1:29:12] skies and the law is the
[1:29:16] moon but the but the law can
[1:29:20] shine
[1:29:23] you can see the moon up
[1:29:26] there and it's not
[1:29:30] shining the gospel all times the
[1:29:37] moon because now you know what
[1:29:41] gra is a dispensation of
[1:29:45] Grace but we're living in the
[1:29:47] dispensation of
[1:29:49] Grace and power of the Holy
[1:29:53] Ghost and the sun became black as
[1:29:59] Sao Jesus came first to the
[1:30:03] Jew not to the
[1:30:05] Gentile he came to his
[1:30:08] own and his own
[1:30:11] received that's why the Sun was shining
[1:30:14] around the
[1:30:18] woman Revelation 122
[1:30:23] un and she being with child cry
[1:30:27] travailing in birth and pl pain to be
[1:30:37] delivered and there appeared another
[1:30:40] wander in heaven and behold a great red
[1:30:43] dragon having seven heads and 10 horns
[1:30:46] and seven crowns upon his
[1:30:50] head
[1:30:58] notice verse
[1:31:00] four and his tail drew the third part of
[1:31:06] the stars of
[1:31:10] heaven and he casted them to the
[1:31:16] earth when did he do
[1:31:20] that that his tail drew the stars of
[1:31:24] heaven and C them to the
[1:31:30] Earth
[1:31:34] notice Revelation
[1:31:37] 613
[1:31:41] apocalyps and the stars of Heaven fell
[1:31:45] unto the Earth even as a f casted her
[1:31:49] untimely fix when she was was shaken by
[1:31:52] A Mighty
[1:31:59] Wind see when the six seal was
[1:32:07] open
[1:32:11] so we see
[1:32:15] here when J Jesus was
[1:32:18] born brought forth a Manchild
[1:32:25] who was Christ
[1:32:28] Jesus there's much to be say but I'm
[1:32:31] going to finish with
[1:32:34] this let's turn back to St Matthew
[1:32:49] 2429 Matthew
[1:32:52] immediately after the tribulation of
[1:32:55] those days shall the sun be darkened and
[1:32:58] the moon shall not give her light and
[1:33:01] the Stars shall fall from Heaven and the
[1:33:04] powers of the heaven shall be
[1:33:11] [Music]
[1:33:17] shaken
[1:33:19] and what tribulation is
[1:33:24] there after the tribulation of those
[1:33:32] days you know Paul what well how many
[1:33:36] tribulations are
[1:33:50] there
[1:33:52] since I've been in Silver City when I
[1:33:54] stand up and say things like this they
[1:33:55] get scared I don't ask you a question I
[1:33:58] don't think Caleb does the same
[1:34:03] thing he doesn't say that to see how
[1:34:05] much you know
[1:34:10] mean Noah Noah no what tribulation is
[1:34:15] there how
[1:34:17] many after the tribulation of those days
[1:34:23] I'll I'll give you a hint that's
[1:34:28] compound brother Brenham
[1:34:31] said that that was an amateure
[1:34:36] tribulation so if it was not the Great
[1:34:42] Tribulation which tribulation is
[1:34:47] that you know what
[1:34:50] Carlos and
[1:34:52] and brother Ben he put in
[1:34:56] parenthesis in paresis you know that
[1:34:59] their
[1:35:02] tribulation Henry and he say the ikan
[1:35:08] case so he gives you the answer right
[1:35:11] there the
[1:35:14] tribulation is when they killed millions
[1:35:18] of
[1:35:20] Jews
[1:35:22] in World War
[1:35:24] I when they when the Euphrates River
[1:35:28] dried
[1:35:30] out and those
[1:35:33] demons 200 million came
[1:35:38] out who let them
[1:35:40] out there were the four
[1:35:44] Angels they let them
[1:35:47] out the angels in the East the West the
[1:35:51] North and the
[1:35:53] South and who were the four
[1:35:57] Angels hit Hitler Stalin Stalin musini
[1:36:04] musolini and
[1:36:07] say those were the major ones in World
[1:36:10] War
[1:36:12] I they let the winds
[1:36:16] blow and kill millions of
[1:36:20] Jews
[1:36:22] and not only
[1:36:23] Jews all the innocent people that were
[1:36:26] killed in other
[1:36:29] countries that was the a Great
[1:36:31] Tribulation of their
[1:36:34] time but Jesus is prophesying about the
[1:36:37] tribulation that is going to happen when
[1:36:39] the six seal is
[1:36:45] open that's for another
[1:36:48] message so when the sun turns black
[1:36:54] the bride is
[1:36:56] gone it has sack
[1:37:00] cloth it is
[1:37:03] mourning why are they in
[1:37:07] mour give me again
[1:37:09] 24 uh
[1:37:20] 30
[1:37:23] and then shall appear the sign of the
[1:37:25] son of man in heaven and then shall all
[1:37:29] the tribes of the earth
[1:37:38] mourn and they shall see the son of man
[1:37:42] coming in the Clouds Of Heaven with
[1:37:45] power and
[1:37:50] Gra
[1:37:52] now you see why the sun had
[1:37:57] set when the son of
[1:38:00] man when to put it clear so you you
[1:38:04] people can
[1:38:06] understand is when brother
[1:38:09] Brenham will take this message that we
[1:38:14] preach and take it to Moses and
[1:38:18] Elijah and Moses and Elijah will preach
[1:38:21] to
[1:38:23] them to get the
[1:38:28] 144,000 which the
[1:38:32] 144,000 will be the greatest
[1:38:34] missionaries in the
[1:38:38] time I ask the
[1:38:41] question what happens to the
[1:38:46] 144,000 and who are the
[1:38:50] 144,000
[1:38:51] oh you say those those that went to
[1:38:58] church brother said a bunch of them are
[1:39:01] not but gamblers and none of them
[1:39:07] he so who knows who are the the
[1:39:13] 144,000 if the atomic bomb kills the
[1:39:16] foolish
[1:39:18] virgin who going to kill cuz they have
[1:39:21] to be
[1:39:24] martys who kills the
[1:39:28] 144,000 well who put Jesus Christ on the
[1:39:35] cross the wrong people will kill
[1:39:38] them the same people the they from they
[1:39:42] will murder the
[1:39:47] 144 and I got I could say much but I'm
[1:39:50] going to stop
