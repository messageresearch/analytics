[35:10] dark but it shall be one day which shall

[35:16] Lord not day nor
[35:19] night but it shall come to
[35:23] pass that at evening time it shall be
[35:26] light
[35:28] our them
[35:30] is the
[35:31] great may be
[35:33] seated in the
[35:36] beginning when Man created the heavens
[35:38] and the
[35:41] Earth God created two big
[35:48] lights God
[35:50] created the
[35:52] Sun and he created the
[35:55] moon he created the Sun for the
[36:00] day and he created the moon for the
[36:04] night that is what God
[36:07] created in the
[36:09] beginning in the beginning when God
[36:11] started his
[36:15] creation and God created
[36:18] man from the dust of the
[36:21] earth God created
[36:24] him uh he made him of 16
[36:28] elements and he one of the 16
[36:32] elements was
[36:34] Cosmic one was
[36:40] calcium and
[36:42] petroleum this is what man is made out
[36:46] of that is the
[36:48] body that is not the
[36:50] spirit as we look at one another this
[36:55] morning we see a
[36:57] body but we don't see the
[37:00] spirit we neither see the
[37:02] soul but God created in the
[37:06] beginning he created a
[37:09] sun and he created the
[37:12] moon light is a great
[37:15] thing in Early
[37:18] Times uh man looked at at at at the
[37:23] light when they saw lightning come from
[37:26] the sky
[37:29] is one of the great mysteries of
[37:32] nature the ancient
[37:35] Romans believed that thunder and
[37:39] lightning were the weapons of the juper
[37:43] of the god
[37:45] Jupiter but in the year of
[37:51] 1700 uh there was a man by the name of
[37:54] Benjamin
[37:55] Franklin
[37:57] Franklin and he showed the connection
[37:59] between electricity and
[38:04] lightning he made a Sil
[38:09] kite and Fen a piece of wire near its
[38:15] top he attached a long string to the
[38:21] kite and he tied an iron key to the end
[38:24] of the
[38:25] string
[38:28] in the year
[38:31] 1752 there was a
[38:34] storm and Benjamin Franklin took the
[38:38] kite he threw the kite into a thunder
[38:47] head
[38:49] and the as the kite hit the
[38:55] Thunderhead the train started getting
[38:59] stiff Benjamin Franklin took his
[39:03] finger and gently touched the
[39:08] key and he felt the electrical charge
[39:10] coming from the
[39:17] cloud and that was a very dangerous
[39:22] experiment but Benjamin
[39:25] Franklin proved that there was a
[39:28] connection between electricity and
[39:34] lightning he also placed what we call a
[39:39] battery and he took some of that
[39:43] charge and it went into that
[39:46] battery but it took another say another
[39:52] Century for a man by the name of Thomas
[39:55] Edison
[39:58] to be able to make a light
[40:02] bulb that would bring in the
[40:07] electricity and they called Thomas
[40:10] Edison the wizard men
[40:16] par so then Thomas
[40:19] Edison they asked him a
[40:22] question what is a
[40:25] genius
[40:27] he said it is 1%
[40:31] inspiration and 99% persperation
[40:37] that's what Thomas def a
[40:42] genius I was reading an
[40:46] encyclopedia and it says that Thomas
[40:48] Edison created the
[40:51] electricity well I don't care if I read
[40:53] it out of an
[40:55] encyclopedia
[40:57] enyclopedia is
[40:58] wrong Thomas never created the
[41:03] electricity what Thomas
[41:06] Made because I believe God gave him that
[41:10] knowledge he made a light
[41:13] ball with the filament made out of
[41:17] thread that would be able to bring in
[41:19] the
[41:22] electricity and it would put forth light
[41:24] in a dark room
[41:28] but in the
[41:29] beginning God there was a Darkness upon
[41:33] the whole
[41:34] earth and God saw that Darkness wasn't
[41:39] good because God does not abide in
[41:42] darkness for God is light but when we
[41:46] see God and we look at God as
[41:50] light God is not that
[41:52] light that is Cosmic light even our
[41:56] bodies have Cosmic
[41:58] light we go through a cosmic light of
[42:00] the
[42:02] universe but God put a light in the
[42:05] heaven he placed another light for for
[42:08] the
[42:09] night and this light is a s of
[42:14] righteous that's what God put for you
[42:16] and
[42:17] I that's a great
[42:19] light amen Cosmic light is one
[42:24] thing though he isn't
[42:26] thing zo is light from
[42:30] God because God is
[42:32] light that is the reason that a lot of
[42:34] people don't see
[42:37] God because you can't see him with this
[42:40] eye this eye is made out of cosmic
[42:45] light out
[42:47] ofro out
[42:48] of and all these things
[42:52] but is picked up by the Inner Man
[42:57] and then when you pick him
[42:59] up you can then if it brings this body
[43:02] under
[43:04] control then these
[43:07] senses are subject to the inner
[43:11] sense then a man can see
[43:14] God Amen I want to go into a
[43:18] scripture if you open with
[43:20] me to First
[43:22] John chapter
[43:24] 1 and verse
[43:35] and all of you fine
[43:38] people
[43:44] amen notice here first John
[43:54] 51 this is the message which we have
[43:58] heard of
[44:01] him and declare unto
[44:04] you that God is
[44:07] light and in him is no Darkness at
[44:11] all if we say that we have fellowship
[44:14] with
[44:17] him and walk in
[44:20] darkness we lie and do not the
[44:25] truth but if we walk in the
[44:28] light as he is in the
[44:32] light we have Fellowship one with
[44:36] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[44:39] his
[44:40] son cleanses us from all
[44:44] sin when Jesus Christ came to this
[44:49] earth he was the
[44:52] light he was not a
[44:54] reflection
[44:57] he was the
[44:59] light when John the Baptist came to this
[45:03] earth they asked him the
[45:05] question are you the light he said I am
[45:10] not the
[45:11] light I only bear witness of the
[45:17] light I am not
[45:20] him he I am not worthy even to untie his
[45:24] shoes
[45:26] I am not the great
[45:28] light he is the
[45:31] light in the beginning was the
[45:34] light which was the
[45:36] word the word was made
[45:40] God and it dwell Among
[45:43] Us the word was made
[45:46] flesh amen and it dwelt among
[45:50] us I could go into
[45:53] preaching but I I want to take it a
[45:55] little slow
[45:57] so that you can understand
[46:00] it I I want I want you to get
[46:04] it these are very what we call very
[46:08] simple
[46:10] things but the people don't seem to
[46:14] understand
[46:16] this but maybe this
[46:19] morning we take it a little
[46:21] slow God can help us he is the only
[46:27] he is the light that comes to
[46:29] man open your Bibles to the gospel of St
[46:34] John from chapter
[46:37] 1 and verse one and it was this way in
[46:41] the beginning was the
[46:43] word the word was with
[46:46] God and the Word was God the same was in
[46:50] the beginning with
[46:53] God all things were made by him
[46:57] and without him was not anything made
[46:59] that was
[47:01] made in him was
[47:04] life and the life was the light of
[47:08] men and the light shineth in
[47:12] darkness and the Darkness comprehended
[47:15] it
[47:16] not there was a man sent from God whose
[47:19] name was
[47:22] John the same came for a witness to Bear
[47:24] witness of the L
[47:29] that all men through him might
[47:32] believe he was not that
[47:35] light but was sent to Bear witness of
[47:38] that
[47:41] light that was the True
[47:44] Light which lith every man that cometh
[47:47] into the
[47:49] world he was in the
[47:52] world and the world was made by him
[47:56] and the world knew him
[47:58] not he came unto his own and his own
[48:03] received him
[48:04] not but as many as received
[48:07] him to them gave he
[48:10] power to become the sons of
[48:13] God even to them that believe on his
[48:17] name the Bible here says that the world
[48:21] was made by
[48:22] him that's the reason that I said a
[48:25] while ago
[48:27] that Thomas Edison did not make the
[48:30] electricity Thomas Edison isn't
[48:33] God the world was made by
[48:36] God God came to the
[48:39] world he he was with us in
[48:43] flesh he was here the light of the
[48:48] world Amen now I want to go to another
[48:53] scripture and it's found in the the
[48:55] gospel of St
[48:57] Matthew and in Chapter
[49:00] 13 and verse
[49:03] 10 we are dealing with a great
[49:06] light and no here chapter 13 and verse
[49:11] 10 of the Gospel of St
[49:14] Matthew the disciples came and said unto
[49:19] him why speak thou unto them in
[49:23] Parables he answered and said unto them
[49:27] because it is given unto you to know the
[49:28] mysteries of the kingdom of
[49:33] heaven but to them it is not
[49:37] given for whosoever
[49:39] has to him shall be given and he shall
[49:43] have more
[49:45] abundance but whosoever has
[49:48] not from him shall be taken away even
[49:52] that he
[49:54] have therefore speak kind to them in
[49:58] Parables because they see see
[50:02] not and hearing they hear
[50:05] not neither do they
[50:08] understand and in them is fulfilled the
[50:11] prophecy of
[50:14] Isaiah which said by hearing you shall
[50:18] hear and shall not
[50:21] understand and seeing you shall
[50:23] see and shall not
[50:26] perceive for this people's heart is WX
[50:32] gross and their ears are D and of
[50:37] hearing and their eyes they have
[50:41] closed lest at any time they should see
[50:44] with their
[50:45] eyes and hear with their ears and should
[50:48] understand with their
[50:50] heart and should be
[50:52] converted and I should heal them but
[50:56] blessed are your
[50:58] eyes for they see and your ears for they
[51:04] hear for verely I say unto
[51:07] you that many prophets and righteous men
[51:09] have desired to see those things which
[51:12] he
[51:15] see and have not seen them and to hear
[51:19] those things which you
[51:21] hear and have not heard them what is it
[51:26] that those people did not
[51:31] see if the things that we are now
[51:35] seeing we live in the most wicked
[51:41] age but we also live in the Golden
[51:46] Age we are living in a time when all
[51:50] things have come to a
[51:54] Capone
[51:59] where the things of God are being made
[52:04] manifest I don't want to get ahead of
[52:08] myself I just want to go step by
[52:11] step I was asked the other
[52:14] day that we follow a
[52:17] man I said I Sur don't follow a
[52:20] woman I follow a man even God is Man
[52:25] when he came down to this earth he took
[52:28] the form of a
[52:30] man for the woman is my byproduct of the
[52:36] man so then we see that we do follow a
[52:41] man but what manner of man do we
[52:46] follow I don't follow a man in the outer
[52:51] Court I follow a man in the inner Veil
[52:57] I follow a man that has gone into God's
[53:01] presence and has brought
[53:05] zo and then my eyes began to
[53:09] see my eyes see what they could not
[53:13] see because the eyes are
[53:17] anointed with from God that was brought
[53:21] by a
[53:22] man that man wasn't the light
[53:26] he only was the
[53:28] B heed a
[53:31] b to bring the
[53:34] light I want to go into a
[53:37] scure that's in the book
[53:40] of in the 13th chapter and in verse
[53:45] 45 here it is speaking about
[53:48] Paul and
[53:50] Barnabas now notice the scripture
[53:54] carefully
[53:56] acts the 13th
[53:58] chapter and verse
[54:01] 45 but when the Jews saw the
[54:05] multitudes they were filled with
[54:08] envy and foke against those things which
[54:11] were spoken by
[54:14] Paul contradicting and
[54:18] blasing notice
[54:21] again these
[54:22] Jews were filled with Envy
[54:26] because when Paul was
[54:29] speaking great multitudes were coming to
[54:33] hear they wanted to hear what was going
[54:38] on in the
[54:41] heavens and Paul was bringing them
[54:44] light and these
[54:47] Jews were very EnV of
[54:50] this they started contradicting and
[54:53] blaspheming Paul
[54:58] everything that Paul said they would
[55:00] contradict it Paul would say something
[55:04] they would Blas me
[55:06] that for that is the blasphemy of the
[55:08] Holy
[55:10] Spirit when they speak what God is
[55:13] doing in the form of the Holy
[55:16] Spirit through his
[55:19] service and to reject
[55:21] that that's blessing of the Holy Spirit
[55:25] they were blasing what Paul was
[55:28] saying but notice what kind of a man
[55:31] Paul
[55:33] was and Barnabas his
[55:36] friend and here it says verse
[55:40] 46 then Paul and
[55:43] Barnabas wax
[55:45] B and said it was necessary that the
[55:49] word of God should first have been
[55:51] spoken to
[55:54] you
[55:56] because in John one we read a while
[56:00] ago
[56:01] John that that to his own he came but
[56:06] his own received him
[56:08] not so then it says here it was
[56:12] necessary that the word of God should
[56:14] first have been spoken to
[56:18] you seen you put it from
[56:23] you and C yourself Unworthy of
[56:28] everlasting
[56:31] life no we turn to the
[56:35] Gentiles that is a hard
[56:38] statement because the word came to those
[56:43] Jews but they rejected the
[56:46] light Paul said you people find yourself
[56:49] Unworthy of everlasting
[56:52] life that is the same with the
[56:56] Gentiles people say I am not
[56:59] worthy that's right we're not
[57:03] worthy but he made us
[57:06] worthy we are
[57:09] worthy
[57:11] of that's what makes us
[57:13] worthy if I walk around and I say I am
[57:17] not
[57:18] worthy but when he come back I'm not
[57:22] going to go no
[57:23] place because I'm not worthy but I got
[57:27] to be found
[57:29] worthy to stand before the son of
[57:33] man the only way that I can be found
[57:37] worthy is if the light of God CHS around
[57:43] me it's not
[57:46] AIC zo it is the life of the of the
[57:51] Everlasting
[57:53] God this Jews they said we're not
[57:58] worthy Paul said then we got to turn
[58:02] turn our
[58:03] back we're going to go to another
[58:06] people to find out if they're
[58:09] worthy all right we're going to get to
[58:11] the scriptures to find out we're going
[58:14] to be
[58:15] worthy amen now go
[58:18] again to verse
[58:22] 47 for so have the Lord Comm us
[58:26] saying I have set thee to be a light of
[58:29] the
[58:31] Gentiles that thou should be for
[58:33] salvation unto the ends of the
[58:38] Earth who played Paul as light to the
[58:43] Gentiles it was God he was the
[58:49] light oh but they couldn't see
[58:53] him they were only seen a
[58:57] b that was bringing the light of
[59:00] God it was reflecting to the
[59:04] people and the light was bringing
[59:08] salvation it was bringing
[59:10] healing through the
[59:13] ministry the
[59:15] AP the wise Master
[59:18] build that was God when Paul was
[59:22] walking that was God walking
[59:26] that's what the people get figured out
[59:29] they don't understand
[59:30] that us they say you follow a
[59:34] man that's very true but I follow a
[59:39] man he is not a
[59:42] reflection he's a
[59:45] reflector he's coming from God a man
[59:49] that blew
[59:51] a he hit
[59:53] Thunder he made the light come
[59:58] down when the lightning starts in the
[1:00:03] cloud need a ground to come
[1:00:06] to there got be somebody down
[1:00:15] [Applause]
[1:00:18] here that when Jesus Christ went
[1:00:21] away and then when the apostles were
[1:00:23] killed
[1:00:25] and the church started dying
[1:00:27] down the church
[1:00:30] died in the age
[1:00:33] of and we find out that that whe of
[1:00:37] corn was
[1:00:39] buried but we find that he started
[1:00:41] coming out
[1:00:43] again he came out in the times of
[1:00:47] Luther and Luther said that just shall
[1:00:49] by
[1:00:51] faith that wasn't all the light that was
[1:00:55] part of the
[1:00:56] L when Wesley came out to the Methodist
[1:01:01] not that they were the
[1:01:02] Methodist he called him that because of
[1:01:04] his method of
[1:01:06] teaching but as Wesley came out he
[1:01:10] brought out the second
[1:01:12] part which was
[1:01:15] sanctification then when Pentecost came
[1:01:18] in the year
[1:01:20] 1906 the restoration of the gifts came
[1:01:22] out that was the third
[1:01:25] part that wasn't all the
[1:01:27] light there was a
[1:01:30] gate There Was An Open Door was by God
[1:01:35] that would bring
[1:01:36] light that would bring light to the
[1:01:40] people why let go back to a
[1:01:44] verse back to back
[1:01:46] to to
[1:01:50] Mali
[1:01:51] amen chapter 4
[1:01:54] and verse
[1:01:56] two it says again but unto you that fear
[1:02:00] my
[1:02:04] name shall the son of righteousness
[1:02:07] arise with healing in his
[1:02:12] wings now let us go to
[1:02:15] Zarah toter
[1:02:18] 14 verse 6 and
[1:02:20] S it shall come to pass in that day
[1:02:26] that the light shall not be clear nor
[1:02:29] dark but it shall be one day which shall
[1:02:32] be known to the
[1:02:35] Lord not day nor
[1:02:38] night but it shall come to
[1:02:40] pass that at evening time it shall be
[1:02:44] light there was a man by the name
[1:02:49] of
[1:02:51] said if I knew God's secret place
[1:02:56] I would go to his
[1:02:58] house I would knock on the
[1:03:01] door he would open me the door I would
[1:03:05] come in with him I would worship with
[1:03:08] him I would worship him there if I only
[1:03:13] knew that
[1:03:15] secret hallah come on hallelujah
[1:03:19] hallelujah that secret
[1:03:21] place that secret place
[1:03:24] though we come to that
[1:03:26] man the hidden place of God oh could we
[1:03:31] worship God we could really worship
[1:03:35] God I wouldn't expect for you to bring
[1:03:38] God to the
[1:03:39] church because I would bring him here in
[1:03:42] my
[1:03:43] heart oh in the secret
[1:03:46] place that is where God Mi the
[1:03:50] worshiper hallu oh but wait a minute
[1:03:55] before we get to
[1:03:57] secret how am I going to find
[1:04:00] it I don't see the
[1:04:02] light I got to get me a light
[1:04:09] bulb amen
[1:04:13] amarah it that it shall be a day that
[1:04:18] will neither be day nor
[1:04:20] night oh my what a day it is day
[1:04:25] it is a night the sun is was
[1:04:29] made by God to be the light in the
[1:04:34] daytime the moon was made by
[1:04:37] God to be the
[1:04:39] light at night but this day is neither
[1:04:44] day nor night it is a very dismal
[1:04:49] day it is a very cloudy day oh there's
[1:04:57] C
[1:05:00] confusion oh we got 969 different
[1:05:05] denominations oh we have so many groups
[1:05:08] oh but no one can see but the Bible says
[1:05:13] that in the evening
[1:05:15] time there was going to be light the was
[1:05:19] going to come from
[1:05:20] God how was it going to
[1:05:23] come to come from the
[1:05:25] cloud because over the
[1:05:28] cloud is the Sun have you ever gone up
[1:05:31] in
[1:05:33] aane and you go up over those
[1:05:36] clouds the sun is
[1:05:39] shining but you can see it oh you can
[1:05:43] see that
[1:05:44] sun oh there's a cloud covering the
[1:05:49] whole and the people see nothing but a
[1:05:52] dismal cloudy day
[1:05:56] they see a lot of
[1:05:58] Shadows they see a lot of
[1:06:01] negatives but there had to come an
[1:06:04] evening
[1:06:05] light the same light that came to the
[1:06:09] Jews the same night that would come to
[1:06:11] the
[1:06:13] gentille
[1:06:15] civilization has traveled from the East
[1:06:18] to the
[1:06:20] West all that light was up there but one
[1:06:24] said one thing another one
[1:06:28] said oh praise be to God but there was a
[1:06:32] man born in
[1:06:33] Kent he was not the light but he also
[1:06:37] came bearing witness of that
[1:06:40] light he started growing up he started
[1:06:44] going into the apostolic
[1:06:45] church he started going to the assem of
[1:06:48] God he started going into the Church of
[1:06:51] God he went around the world seven times
[1:06:55] oh how do people love that
[1:06:58] man because the churches started filling
[1:07:01] up because when he saw a blind
[1:07:05] man he would Open the Eyes of the blind
[1:07:08] man when they would bring him a dead
[1:07:12] person and that was a perfect plan of
[1:07:15] God for that man to raise
[1:07:17] up that man would raise
[1:07:20] up oh the people would see a light
[1:07:25] they would see
[1:07:26] life because Jesus Christ said I am the
[1:07:29] way the truth and the
[1:07:31] life I am the way back to the
[1:07:34] father but the only way that he was
[1:07:36] going to do
[1:07:38] it was by
[1:07:41] men oh hallelujah hallelujah has this
[1:07:44] man Open the Eyes
[1:07:46] of he picked up the the the man that
[1:07:49] were with without lims and or that were
[1:07:53] paralyzed and so
[1:07:56] forth and all this thing would come to
[1:07:58] this man the
[1:08:00] healings oh praise be to God how the
[1:08:04] people love
[1:08:07] that the churches were
[1:08:09] ped but then the people started coming
[1:08:11] out of the
[1:08:13] churches we were coming out of
[1:08:15] Babylon oh we're making an
[1:08:21] exit then the the minister started
[1:08:25] saying oh that William
[1:08:27] Ren he's got a doct of the
[1:08:30] devil they started
[1:08:32] blaspheming they started contradicting
[1:08:36] him and what were they
[1:08:38] doing they wanted to walk in
[1:08:42] darkness they would not receive the
[1:08:46] light because the light came from
[1:08:49] God but God only shines through a
[1:08:56] reflector which is a
[1:08:59] prophet and the people love more
[1:09:04] Darkness than the light oh Hallelujah
[1:09:09] they said where is
[1:09:10] God what is God all these
[1:09:15] questions all these
[1:09:17] Mysteries the Bible says that in the
[1:09:21] evening time there was going to be light
[1:09:25] I want you to open the scripture with
[1:09:28] me in first
[1:09:31] John chapter
[1:09:33] 5 and
[1:09:36] verse
[1:09:39] S and
[1:09:42] eight oh praise
[1:09:45] God there are three that bear record in
[1:09:51] heaven the father
[1:09:54] the word and the Holy
[1:09:57] Ghost and these three are three
[1:09:59] different
[1:10:01] ones that's not the way the Bible reads
[1:10:04] they say that these three are
[1:10:06] one these three are
[1:10:09] one they bear record in
[1:10:12] heaven and they're
[1:10:14] one oh but look look at the Bible
[1:10:18] now in verse eight there are three that
[1:10:22] bear witness on Earth
[1:10:26] in Earth the spirit the water and the
[1:10:30] blood and these three agree in
[1:10:35] one we see
[1:10:37] here that there is three bearing record
[1:10:40] on or witness in this
[1:10:44] earth we see it from the natural
[1:10:48] births and we take it to the spiritual
[1:10:52] birth that is the reason that a lot of
[1:10:55] people have
[1:10:58] water which is
[1:11:00] justification they have
[1:11:02] blood which is
[1:11:05] sanctification and they have holy
[1:11:08] spirit that is fine and a lot of people
[1:11:11] say they receive the holy
[1:11:14] spirit all right that is fine but that
[1:11:18] holy
[1:11:19] spirit that you
[1:11:21] receive will guide you to that
[1:11:24] one because that one is the one that had
[1:11:29] that that brings the light from
[1:11:32] God so that if you never see the
[1:11:36] B that is bringing the light you will
[1:11:40] never understand
[1:11:42] God you will never receive the son of
[1:11:47] righteousness you will never receive
[1:11:49] healing in your
[1:11:51] wings until you learn fear God
[1:11:55] first because the word of God
[1:11:59] say to those that fear my
[1:12:02] name that what's wrong with the
[1:12:06] people it's so easy to walk with the
[1:12:10] world and it is easy to do anything we
[1:12:13] want to
[1:12:14] do but when we fear
[1:12:17] God all the son of righteous will
[1:12:22] arise with healing in it
[1:12:26] wings that wings of
[1:12:30] an bring healing to the
[1:12:33] people the people say I don't need to do
[1:12:37] that you'll never get it because he
[1:12:41] takes the
[1:12:42] ball he needs a man that may contact
[1:12:46] with
[1:12:47] God where God came
[1:12:51] down and he Abed in in his
[1:12:55] heart he went into that secret
[1:12:59] place and he abided there with
[1:13:02] him when that man was
[1:13:05] speaking he wasn't the flesh
[1:13:08] speaking it
[1:13:11] was it was God to open your eyes to open
[1:13:16] my
[1:13:17] eyes ano us
[1:13:20] with it was taken away the flesh
[1:13:24] that's what's wrong we like to do many
[1:13:27] things of the
[1:13:29] flesh pardon me for what I got to
[1:13:32] say but we should love to sit down and
[1:13:34] watch
[1:13:36] television always we like to sit down
[1:13:38] and do many different
[1:13:40] things I'm not a
[1:13:42] hypocrite I like it my flesh like that I
[1:13:46] told you I didn't like
[1:13:48] it the biggest Li behind this
[1:13:52] pit there came a prophet he said get the
[1:13:56] hell
[1:13:57] vision and kick it out of your
[1:14:00] house who was the one that said it it
[1:14:03] was theiving
[1:14:06] story it was bringing life to
[1:14:10] you I want your eyes to see
[1:14:13] now I want you to see God
[1:14:17] now I want you to see with his
[1:14:21] eyes oh because you you got eyes they
[1:14:25] say I got eyes I can see I got ears I
[1:14:29] can
[1:14:30] hear what do you hear what do you see
[1:14:34] the Bible says they have
[1:14:35] eyes they can't see they got ears they
[1:14:39] can hear why it is still a dismal day it
[1:14:44] is still covered with clouds oh praise
[1:14:47] God but when this man from
[1:14:50] Kentucky oh he was picked up
[1:14:54] he went to that
[1:14:56] cloud who formed the
[1:14:58] cloud the cloud was formed by seven
[1:15:02] angels they were bringing up
[1:15:05] light from the son of
[1:15:08] righteousness when this Prophet came
[1:15:12] down from the
[1:15:13] cloud oh he unveiled
[1:15:16] God he took away the
[1:15:19] clouds he brought back to us 20th
[1:15:24] century he showed us the way
[1:15:26] back he said follow
[1:15:29] me as I follow Christ I am the way
[1:15:34] back you say that was Jesus Christ I'll
[1:15:38] say Amen but the
[1:15:41] reflection in the
[1:15:47] reflector hallelujah hallelujah that is
[1:15:50] the reason that when William SP to the
[1:15:54] people he told that man this man came
[1:15:57] out of a
[1:15:58] meeting he said I don't believe in
[1:16:01] Divine brother says why don't you I
[1:16:05] can't see it he said oh I'm going to get
[1:16:08] it now he said do you believe in God he
[1:16:12] says I sure
[1:16:14] do says you don't see him he says oh
[1:16:18] said where do you
[1:16:20] live he said on the other side of the
[1:16:22] mountain
[1:16:23] oh I know a man that went beyond that
[1:16:26] brother to the other side of the
[1:16:30] mountain that man said oh praise God he
[1:16:35] said I live on the other side of the
[1:16:38] mountain brother said how do you know
[1:16:41] it's over there how do you get there he
[1:16:44] said by a
[1:16:46] path he said but what you do at night he
[1:16:49] said I carry a lantern amen he carried a
[1:16:52] lantern with
[1:16:54] he said but the lantern doesn't shine
[1:16:55] all the
[1:16:57] pth he said but it only shines part of
[1:16:59] the
[1:17:02] pth that's it that's the way we follow
[1:17:06] Jesus one step at a
[1:17:09] time but the is
[1:17:12] shining is taking us to the other side
[1:17:15] of the
[1:17:16] mountain will be
[1:17:18] fulfilled the are six purpose of
[1:17:21] Gabriel's Vis to Daniel
[1:17:25] the anointing of the most
[1:17:28] holy how do we get
[1:17:30] there we get
[1:17:33] there by following that
[1:17:36] path oh when we follow those footprints
[1:17:40] on the sense of
[1:17:43] time we will get
[1:17:47] there now here we go into another
[1:17:50] scripture Revelations 3
[1:17:54] 17 and
[1:17:55] 18 now notice when Jesus Christ
[1:17:58] spoke in Chapter 13 of St
[1:18:02] Matthew in verse 10 he said having eyes
[1:18:06] they
[1:18:07] see and having not heav ears they cannot
[1:18:11] hear notice Revelations
[1:18:16] 3:17 this is the last book of the
[1:18:19] Bible this is the revelation of Jesus
[1:18:22] Christ
[1:18:23] oh he says Thou sayest I am
[1:18:26] rich and increased with
[1:18:29] goods and have of
[1:18:32] nothing and know is not that thou are
[1:18:35] wretched and miserable and poor and
[1:18:39] blind and naked I consel the to buy a me
[1:18:42] gold in the
[1:18:45] fire th mayest be
[1:18:47] rich and white
[1:18:49] r that th may be
[1:18:51] closed that the shame of thy nakedness
[1:18:54] do not
[1:18:57] appear and anoint thine eyes with th
[1:19:00] sou that thou may see brother and
[1:19:05] sister the devil will rub you up every
[1:19:08] blessing that God has put
[1:19:12] forth if you let you
[1:19:16] yourself are
[1:19:18] equipped to fight that
[1:19:21] devil only way you can do
[1:19:24] it just look at that light and when you
[1:19:28] look at that light no matter what saying
[1:19:31] does you say to him it is written it is
[1:19:36] in the book I don't fear no
[1:19:39] evil for the light is with
[1:19:41] me my step they comfort
[1:19:45] me they my head of
[1:19:48] oil oh my eyes are full of
[1:19:51] I I can see but what am I seeing I am
[1:19:56] seeing what the light was sh
[1:19:59] shining that's what I'm
[1:20:01] seeing light the light is a path is a
[1:20:06] light unto
[1:20:16] my Matthew
[1:20:18] 5
[1:20:21] hallelujah oh h
[1:20:24] when we can
[1:20:27] get the
[1:20:32] people when we put forth this
[1:20:36] light oh my what a people we will
[1:20:41] be
[1:20:44] nature is
[1:20:47] crying for the manifestation of the sons
[1:20:50] of
[1:20:51] God it's with
[1:20:54] pain
[1:20:56] waiting people say I'm waiting for I'm
[1:20:59] waiting for the Lord Jesus
[1:21:01] Christ that's fine so am I but I got to
[1:21:05] be
[1:21:06] worthy to stand before
[1:21:09] him he provided a way for you and
[1:21:13] I all you have to do is accept that walk
[1:21:18] in the light as he is in the light we
[1:21:21] have Fellowship one with another
[1:21:23] the blood of Jesus covers
[1:21:25] us then we see that people don't
[1:21:29] see this is a great thing
[1:21:31] here H A lot of people don't
[1:21:34] understand when the Bible speaks that we
[1:21:36] are setting in Heavenly places in
[1:21:40] Christ the people want to see those
[1:21:42] heavenly place in
[1:21:44] Christ with but let me tell you one
[1:21:48] thing when we were in the myy
[1:21:51] clay
[1:21:54] and when we were in
[1:21:56] sin when we used to like to do the
[1:21:59] things of the
[1:22:00] world we were deep in
[1:22:03] sin but when that that light came to
[1:22:07] us it lifted us up from those sinful
[1:22:14] things and we are now setting in
[1:22:17] Heavenly places in
[1:22:20] Christ that is the reason
[1:22:23] when you see a picture of people like
[1:22:25] this in
[1:22:29] Flames they are burning with a
[1:22:35] torment because of the things that are
[1:22:38] going on around the
[1:22:41] world looking for an
[1:22:44] escape so that they can be
[1:22:47] liberated many of them run to
[1:22:50] church that is fine
[1:22:53] run to church love him give your heart
[1:22:57] to him and if you don't see the light
[1:23:00] bulb sooner or later you
[1:23:03] will if you believe him and don't enter
[1:23:07] into a
[1:23:08] contradiction and to blashe God there's
[1:23:12] what God is doing these people that
[1:23:15] raise their
[1:23:16] hands those are souls in
[1:23:19] prison they are still down here in sin
[1:23:23] taking a stick of
[1:23:25] marijuana taking a bottle of
[1:23:27] whiskey taking another man's
[1:23:31] wife run around in
[1:23:33] divorces living around with common-law
[1:23:37] wives and all the fields of the
[1:23:40] world that is the
[1:23:43] darkness oh but God has placed the
[1:23:46] light so that you will not walk in those
[1:23:49] dark
[1:23:50] things you will walk in light
[1:23:54] as he is in the
[1:23:55] light Hallelujah why do you want to be
[1:23:59] stuck down there in
[1:24:01] sin why don't you want to come up and
[1:24:04] sit in Heavenly
[1:24:06] places so that there will be healing all
[1:24:09] around
[1:24:11] you there will be healing in your
[1:24:14] families there will be healing in your
[1:24:18] house there will be a peace in your
[1:24:21] heart
[1:24:23] there will you will be so
[1:24:26] confident that your children are guarded
[1:24:29] by the angel of the
[1:24:32] Lord I have a right to call on God for
[1:24:36] that because I don't abide in
[1:24:40] sin even though sin comes to
[1:24:44] me but the has shown around
[1:24:47] us it takes away the sin and it
[1:24:51] overshadows the
[1:24:53] sin and the Darkness and
[1:24:57] Light cannot walk
[1:24:59] together one has to
[1:25:02] die for the other one to
[1:25:05] live oh and when the light is
[1:25:09] shining watch what kind of people we
[1:25:11] should
[1:25:13] be Matthew 5 verse 13 or
[1:25:19] 14 514 of St Matthew
[1:25:24] ye are the light of the
[1:25:26] world a city that is set on a hill
[1:25:29] cannot be
[1:25:31] here neither do men light a
[1:25:35] candle put it under a denominational
[1:25:40] gate that's what the prophet says I'm
[1:25:43] just quoting the prophet when he placed
[1:25:45] the
[1:25:51] bush he said there was a denominational
[1:25:55] gate denomination will do
[1:25:58] this will separate
[1:26:00] you it'll separate you from
[1:26:03] God because they have their own
[1:26:06] [Music]
[1:26:09] ways their
[1:26:10] systems oh Hallelujah but when you come
[1:26:14] to this
[1:26:15] word you see the B you see the
[1:26:20] reflector you see the reflector that is
[1:26:23] getting the Reflection from
[1:26:27] Zoe So then if we are children of
[1:26:31] light then we should walk as children of
[1:26:35] light I want to say as more
[1:26:39] testimony the other day I say this for
[1:26:42] God's
[1:26:42] glory how I feel about it
[1:26:46] all how I feel about the whole
[1:26:49] thing I don't like to be a hypocrite I
[1:26:52] don't like to say one thing and do
[1:26:55] another because that is not what we have
[1:26:57] been
[1:26:58] taught the Bible doesn't teach that the
[1:27:02] word don't teach that I was having a
[1:27:05] little rough time at
[1:27:08] home and I went to my oldest
[1:27:13] son I'm not shaming him in front of
[1:27:16] you because if you were
[1:27:18] sincere you would admit that you have
[1:27:20] the same problems
[1:27:23] but I told him I told my wife I told my
[1:27:26] children if you if you don't straighten
[1:27:30] out with
[1:27:31] me I won't stand behind a
[1:27:34] pulit because the Bible says that we are
[1:27:38] children of the
[1:27:40] light what kind of light are we are we
[1:27:43] putting
[1:27:46] forth are we putting forth God's
[1:27:50] light or are we putting on a
[1:27:55] show like Hollywood with all its
[1:28:00] glamor all those big lights oh my how
[1:28:03] they attract the
[1:28:05] eyes I told him this my my oldest
[1:28:09] son he came to me he said daddy pray for
[1:28:13] me that these demons leave
[1:28:16] me I said I'm going to pray for you well
[1:28:19] I guess I guess the Lord heard our
[1:28:21] prayer
[1:28:24] he's been a mighty fine boy since
[1:28:26] then I think he's going to preach to us
[1:28:29] thday he even invited his grandma to
[1:28:33] come I went to my father and mother's
[1:28:36] house I told him that he was going to
[1:28:38] preach
[1:28:39] Thursday my mother and father I think
[1:28:42] will be here
[1:28:44] Thursday if that isn't a
[1:28:46] victory I don't know what a victory
[1:28:49] is but see the promises of God
[1:28:53] are yours
[1:28:55] today for you we heard this young
[1:29:00] man he did a beautiful job in presenting
[1:29:02] to us the story of

[1:29:18] hear Brother maybe they don't want to
[1:29:21] hear me
[1:29:22] that's fine oh but the Bible
