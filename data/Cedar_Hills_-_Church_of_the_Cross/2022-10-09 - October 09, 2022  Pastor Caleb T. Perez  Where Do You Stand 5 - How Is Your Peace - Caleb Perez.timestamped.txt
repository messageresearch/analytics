[2:25] this morning we're speaking on Daniel in
[2:29] captivity
[2:31] and Gabriel flying into instruct him
[2:35] about the future
[2:39] while Daniel was in prayer
[2:41] the Gabriel the Angel come into instruct
[2:44] him no matter how complicated it is God
[2:47] can break it down make it simple
[2:49] now we're going to get into that this
[2:51] morning
[2:52] Israel
[2:53] was redeemed but it was not applied to
[2:56] them
[2:57] because they rejected him but the church
[3:00] received their Redemption amen
[3:03] and he is our kinsman redeemer but in
[3:08] our lesson now in these 70 weeks we find
[3:10] they've come back and received their
[3:12] pardon
[3:14] now let's turn to Daniel and the ninth
[3:18] chapter and the first to the third
[3:22] verses and then we're going to take the
[3:25] 20 to the 27th because this is just
[3:27] Daniel's prayer I want you to read this
[3:29] over and over through the week now until
[3:31] you get it
[3:33] in the first year of dries the Sun
[3:36] seed of the needs which was made King
[3:39] over the rim of the dialed in
[3:42] in the first year of the Arena Daniel
[3:46] stood understood by books
[3:50] that the number of years were all the
[3:53] word of God came to Jeremiah the prophet
[3:55] that he would accomplish
[3:58] 70 years in the desolation of Jerusalem
[4:02] now the next I set my face unto the Lord
[4:05] God to seek in prayer and supplications
[4:07] and fasting in sacramentation I prayed
[4:10] unto the Lord God and made my confession
[4:12] yet while I was speaking in prayer even
[4:16] the man Gabriel whom I had seen in a
[4:20] vision at the beginning
[4:22] begin
[4:24] calls to fly swiftly touch me about the
[4:28] time of the evening of you
[4:32] Annie inform me and talk with me and
[4:35] said oh Daniel I am now calm forth to
[4:39] give thee still and understanding what
[4:43] if we could have only been there
[4:46] how did he find him in prayer
[4:51] the angel the man you know what she
[4:53] calling the man
[4:56] and being all in the beginning of my
[5:00] supplications the Commandment came forth
[5:03] and came forth for him to go
[5:05] and I have come to show thee
[5:08] for a Thou Art greatly beloved
[5:11] before
[5:12] therefore understand the matter
[5:16] and consider the vision
[5:18] 70 weeks are determined upon thy people
[5:22] and upon thy holy city or thy City to
[5:27] finish the transgression
[5:29] to make an end of sin
[5:31] and to make reconciliation for iniquity
[5:35] and to bring in Everlasting
[5:37] righteousness and to seal up the vision
[5:40] in Prophecy and to anoint the most holy
[5:43] there's the sixthful reason of his
[5:45] coming I know it
[5:48] now therefore
[5:50] know therefore and understand
[5:53] now listen that from the going forth of
[5:56] the Commandment to restore
[5:59] and to build Jerusalem unto Messiah the
[6:03] prince shall be seven weeks three score
[6:06] and two weeks
[6:09] and the streets shall be built again and
[6:13] the walls even in trouble is time
[6:15] after three score and two weeks shall
[6:18] Messiah be cut off
[6:21] but not for himself
[6:24] and the people of the prince that shall
[6:28] come the prince that shall come
[6:31] destroy the city and the sanctuary and
[6:35] the end thereof shall be with a flood
[6:37] and to the end of the war desolations
[6:40] are determined
[6:42] and he shall confirm the Covenant listen
[6:45] with many for one week one of these 70
[6:49] weeks
[6:50] and in the midst of the week
[6:53] he shall cause the sacrifice and Avalon
[6:56] to cease
[6:58] and for the overspreading of abomination
[7:01] he shall make it destined even unto the
[7:06] consummation and that
[7:10] determined shall be poured upon the
[7:13] desolate
[7:16] now the 70 weeks
[7:18] begins now I get this
[7:21] after
[7:23] the church is taken out
[7:27] now everybody understands that say Amen
[7:29] am I Revelation 6 1
[7:33] 2 Revelations 19 20 1 is connected with
[7:38] the 70 weeks therefore we must stop and
[7:43] explain before we go further
[7:46] we must stop and explain
[7:48] why are these 70 weeks cause if you
[7:51] don't you'll miss or see you you'll miss
[7:54] those trumpets you'll miss old foul
[7:57] those plagues those three unclean
[7:59] spirits like frogs those three woes the
[8:02] casting out of the red dragon the woman
[8:04] and the sun you miss it all if you don't
[8:06] cause it takes place right here in the
[8:09] 70th week
[8:11] all right that's where it takes place
[8:14] now the Prophet Daniel
[8:17] had been in Babylon for 68 years 68
[8:22] years he went into captivity in BC 606
[8:28] and when the vision came to him was was
[8:31] BC 538
[8:33] 538 from 606 leads 68
[8:37] 68 years he had been in Babylon amongst
[8:42] Eden and still had the victory amen amen
[8:46] we can't stay out
[8:49] but Daniel's standing alone with God
[8:53] Amen help the victory for 68 years
[8:59] think of it I don't want to start
[9:01] preaching because this is supposed to be
[9:03] a teaching lesson not Daniel
[9:07] oh my God he had begun to see that the
[9:11] time was getting close
[9:15] just as we are today
[9:17] Daniel began to understand he said by
[9:20] the reading of books
[9:24] and in the first year
[9:26] [Music]
[9:28] all the reign of Daniel and the rain as
[9:31] Daniel understood by books
[9:34] the number of years therefore the word
[9:37] of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet
[9:40] that should be accomplished 70
[9:43] years in Desolation of Jerusalem
[9:48] Jeremiah and BC 606 prophesied because
[9:54] of their sins and ungodliness
[9:57] that they would be 70 years and I want
[10:01] you to notice how Daniel
[10:04] get an alien
[10:06] yet ousted from his people
[10:10] ousted from his church without one
[10:12] church service without any church to go
[10:15] to without any hymns to be saved but
[10:18] what he's saying himself in the midst of
[10:20] all this still help all the what that's
[10:24] common sense
[10:29] amen amen and if Daniel the Prophet of
[10:33] the Lord could consult Jeremiah's books
[10:36] and bring him to such a place
[10:39] that even Israel coming out all of them
[10:44] alive was coming out of the bathroom to
[10:47] go back to the Homeland will cause him
[10:49] to fast with cycles and Ashes how much
[10:53] more are to do to the Church of the
[10:56] Living God to know that time is fading
[10:59] out in shall be no more and the coming

[39:49] we've tried to understand and an Eastern
[39:52] book
[39:58] and so let's get right into the word
[40:01] this morning
[40:02] and that we won't have service this
[40:04] afternoon
[40:06] but so just just give me your undivided
[40:09] attention
[40:10] and let's just see what the Holy Spirit
[40:13] has to say to us
[40:18] amen amen Mark the 13th chapter and the
[40:21] 14th verse
[40:24] and it says this when you have it you
[40:27] can say Amen
[40:29] they came expecting something
[40:32] we don't want to just sit here in the
[40:35] Pew
[40:36] through their conscience that we came to
[40:38] church
[40:40] open our hearts and let the Lord do with
[40:43] us this morning
[40:47] amen amen reads like this Mark 13 14.
[40:51] but when ye shall see the abomination of
[40:56] desolation spoken of by Daniel the
[40:59] Prophet standing there or standing where
[41:02] it ought not
[41:06] um
[41:12] I want to really just focus this is our
[41:15] subject right where do you stand
[41:18] so when you see the abomination of
[41:21] desolation
[41:23] standing where it ought not is
[41:27] there is so much there right right there
[41:31] if you're standing where you ought not
[41:33] just
[41:35] you have to check yourself
[41:38] let him that readeth understand
[41:42] then let them that be in Judea flee to
[41:45] the mountains
[41:47] may God add His blessings to the reading
[41:50] of his word you may be seated
[41:53] the Lord would bless his word this
[41:56] morning
[41:57] let me be clear this morning
[42:01] as I said and I'm going to say it again
[42:04] if you are standing where you
[42:09] where do you stand this morning
[42:12] it is an Abomination
[42:15] to stand where you ought not to stand
[42:19] and by standing there and it being an
[42:23] Abomination
[42:25] soon or later it will make you desolate
[42:30] how many can how many understand that
[42:32] you stand where you ought not to know
[42:36] will sooner or later make you desolate
[42:40] if you put anything before God
[42:47] for you have put something or someone
[42:51] in the place
[42:54] ought not to be
[42:55] let's let's make this Foundation this
[42:58] morning
[42:59] let's understand these words what is
[43:02] abomination
[43:04] the word Abomination
[43:07] it means something that is detestable
[43:10] something
[43:14] disgusting
[43:16] it is something that is filthy
[43:20] something that is idolatry idolatria but
[43:24] he got that I think they have it they
[43:27] don't have it up there
[43:29] what is Desolation
[43:31] it's to lay waste
[43:34] it's to come to not
[43:38] devastate Devastator to destroy the
[43:41] stream now we know that that's what the
[43:43] enemy comes to do right
[43:46] it's doing coming for one thing to kill
[43:49] and to destroy
[43:51] and so this filthy dirty disgusting
[43:57] idolatry spirit is
[44:09] now this is important where we're going
[44:11] this morning
[44:12] once again when you put something before
[44:16] God
[44:17] sooner or later
[44:20] it will destroy you
[44:23] you might think you get away with it
[44:26] you might think you're okay for a little
[44:28] while
[44:30] soon or later
[44:33] the word Abomination
[44:36] when you take it from the
[44:42] it's something that deserves deserves
[44:45] abhorrence yes
[44:50] it stems from the Latin abominary
[44:55] which means deplor such as an evil Omen
[44:59] significa is is the plural and something
[45:03] abominable
[45:05] is from the Latin AB Homen the Latin
[45:09] meaning away from man
[45:14] meaning that it is something beastly
[45:17] significant
[45:19] they get it ah there you go okay it's
[45:22] something peaceless
[45:25] now take it because we're going to break
[45:27] that down here
[45:29] anything that is a beast
[45:32] as we see in the Book of Revelation
[45:35] it is the Greek word therion
[45:54] it's a Savage Ferocious Beast
[45:58] and where Abomination is
[46:02] there is no peace
[46:07] okay we're gonna join all this together
[46:11] pinch yourself this morning
[46:13] I know maybe it's been a long morning
[46:15] for some of you but you made it to
[46:18] church
[46:19] give your give your neighbor a high five
[46:21] say neighbor you made it this morning
[46:24] good job yeah sometimes I mean you you
[46:28] gotta say hey this this is this is good
[46:30] this is great I'm glad to see you all
[46:33] here
[46:34] once again and where Abomination is
[46:37] there is no peace
[46:39] so the question arises how is your peace
[46:45] you'll understand why I'm asking that
[46:48] if I build something
[46:51] even in me where that should not be
[46:54] there
[46:56] no for certain that there will be no
[46:59] peace
[47:01] if I permit something to come into me
[47:05] that's not God's word
[47:07] there will be no peace
[47:11] if I listen to gossip just put your
[47:14] location
[47:16] I will have no peace
[47:19] how many are with me
[47:21] every time we open ourselves up to those
[47:24] Spirits
[47:27] we're simply saying I have no peace
[47:31] if I open myself up to
[47:34] you
[47:36] false doctrines
[47:38] there is no peace
[47:41] for once our spirit is Disturbed
[47:45] we have no peace
[47:48] let's go to Luke 21 24. we're making
[47:52] this Foundation
[47:55] how many are on the ball this morning
[47:58] ready to see what God has
[48:00] let me see your hands I want to make
[48:04] sure
[48:05] Luke 21 24 says
[48:08] Fall by the edge of the Soul
[48:13] and shall be led away captive into all
[48:16] nations
[48:18] and Jerusalem
[48:21] I'm going to say it again
[48:23] Jerusalem
[48:25] shall be trodden down of the Gentiles
[48:29] until the times of the Gentiles be
[48:33] fulfilled
[48:35] and until the Gentile dispensation is
[48:39] fulfilled
[48:41] there will be no peace in Jerusalem
[48:46] I'm going to say it again there will be
[48:48] no peace in Jerusalem
[48:50] one of the things that impacted me the
[48:53] most
[48:54] was probably that
[48:58] seeing Jerusalem trodden down of the
[49:01] Gentiles
[49:03] it is a as I said last Sunday
[49:10] to stand in Jerusalem
[49:12] experience
[49:14] we to know that our Lord and savior walk
[49:18] there
[49:19] Salvador better to see it trodden down
[49:23] by the Gentiles
[49:25] I think the brothers did a wonderful job
[49:28] on Wednesday
[49:30] for the pictures and showing us the
[49:32] videos my that was a wonderful videos
[49:38] so Brother Carlos there's about 950 000
[49:42] people that live in Jerusalem
[49:44] I didn't know that but I had to look it
[49:46] up and there is
[49:51] that live in the old city of Jerusalem
[49:54] now if you can I don't know if it's
[49:57] working but can you put the first
[49:58] picture up there
[50:00] this is this is this is is what you're
[50:03] looking at
[50:05] it is Jerusalem trodden down
[50:09] you have the old city of Jerusalem
[50:13] it's cut into four quarters
[50:17] you have the Christian quarter El
[50:19] Cristiano The Armenian the Jewish
[50:22] quarters and then the Muslim and then up
[50:26] on the Temple mount
[50:28] that whole area is Al-Aqsa that we heard
[50:32] about
[50:33] and there is the Dome of the Rock
[50:38] as I said when you look at this and you
[50:42] can see the diagram
[50:43] and you can see a lot of things
[50:46] but when you start walking through all
[50:49] the streets here
[50:51] it is
[50:54] show that other picture the next one
[50:56] it's mile after mile of of nothing but
[51:00] vendors just like that
[51:02] I mean all through the city
[51:11] and you want to enjoy that and just just
[51:16] what happened there
[51:18] Kim carrying the cross with all that is
[51:24] because it's trotting down by the church
[51:33] and you're looking at that and you're
[51:35] like wow
[51:37] no wonder the prophet would say
[51:41] the tables are full of them
[51:44] every table everywhere you turn
[51:50] you look at that then we came to the
[51:55] Abomination that is made desolate
[52:00] that was
[52:03] that was standing there and looking up
[52:06] at it
[52:09] was like if you were on an emotional
[52:12] roller coaster
[52:15] you look up there and
[52:18] it is the epitome
[52:22] it's the perfect example
[52:25] of the Abomination made
[52:29] decimals
[52:30] right towards standing
[52:33] is where the holy of holies once stood
[52:39] it is where the Shekinah Glory would
[52:43] come down
[52:45] and he wouldn't come down to meet his
[52:47] people
[52:49] and then to look up there
[52:51] and you say God your stomach turns and
[52:55] so stomach it really is hard to look at
[52:58] yes
[52:59] there is such a a spirit there
[53:03] um
[53:07] which most people should cover up I
[53:10] agree
[53:13] but the spirit that's there the Holy
[53:16] Spirit and and you can see
[53:19] the enemy
[53:21] as quarters
[53:25] they're squatterswaji
[53:30] that they sit there thinking and
[53:32] claiming that it's theirs is
[53:36] and you look at that and and and it
[53:39] comes back to you
[53:41] they will Trot down Jesus
[53:45] the Abomination make desolation
[53:49] they'll Trot Down the Walls of Jerusalem
[53:54] until the Gentile dispensation be
[53:58] finished
[54:00] he says and then when that's finished
[54:04] then the Jews will return back into
[54:07] Jerusalem
[54:10] re-establish the temples
[54:12] and the temple worship
[54:16] when I saw this to you and to see with
[54:20] your own eyes
[54:22] the Prophet Daniel was looking at
[54:26] 2600 years
[54:30] that's the beauty about a prophets he
[54:33] can look in the past
[54:35] he's looking 2600 years down the road
[54:40] and he's seeing this the Abomination
[54:43] made Tesla I will mean
[54:45] then you're like no wonder these
[54:48] prophets would cry this was
[54:50] no wonder they would have nervous breaks
[54:53] down
[54:56] there's something standing where it
[54:58] ought not
[55:01] how much more are the prophets
[55:03] when they look through time
[55:06] people standing where they are not
[55:10] how much that causes a breakdown
[55:15] no wonder the the the Earth shook
[55:19] Christ was on the cross
[55:23] the sun didn't want to shine anymore
[55:26] why because that's not okay the way that
[55:30] they envisioned it
[55:33] the prophets all were looking for
[55:36] something greater than that
[55:39] I knew it was coming
[55:41] so when you stand upon this is
[55:47] there is only one thing when I stood
[55:50] looking at it
[55:52] there's only one thing that foreign
[57:07] [Music]
[57:13] that's an abomination
[57:17] and they shall pollute the sanctuary of
[57:19] strength
[57:24] shouldn't your Sanctuary be a sanctuary
[57:28] of strength
[57:34] that people can draw from
[57:38] and they shall take away the daily
[57:40] sacrifice
[57:43] is there no more sacrifice in your life
[57:46] no no I must sacrifices
[57:50] come on it doesn't do us no good just to
[57:53] leave it in the scripture
[57:55] bring it closer to home
[57:58] and they shall place the Abomination
[58:01] that maketh desolate
[58:04] now now here's what I'm what I'm I'm
[58:07] trying to get to is because this is very
[58:10] important to understand the message
[58:13] we think that the Abomination that
[58:16] maketh desolate is
[58:18] is just to see those those masks
[58:22] the Dome of the Rock
[58:25] you see that standing where it ought not
[58:28] too
[58:30] but I'm here to tell you
[58:33] that when our Prophet pulled back the
[58:37] curtain
[58:46] this is why I love the the ministry of
[58:49] the Seven Things
[58:51] takes the current remember we preached
[58:53] on that
[58:55] he pulls it back so that we can see
[58:58] because if if that's all we see
[59:02] is that that building
[59:05] the Abomination make desolate
[59:14] let's see where we're going where the
[59:16] Holy Spirit takes us
[59:18] this message is perfect
[59:21] the more places I go
[59:24] to people
[59:26] the more I just say wow
[59:30] I don't care who says
[59:33] it already captured my heart
[59:37] it's already sitting yeah
[59:41] oh church I'm going to say that it's
[59:44] already sitting in this yes
[59:49] I was checking into our hotel
[59:53] I spoke sparked a conversation with uh
[59:55] with the man that was checking us in
[59:57] person
[59:59] and we began to talk about Jesus Jesus
[1:00:03] of course he didn't want to go anywhere
[1:00:04] near there
[1:00:06] well Jesus was just a man that they
[1:00:10] tried to make him a God Jesus
[1:00:14] I said no they didn't try to make him a
[1:00:17] God
[1:00:19] he is
[1:00:22] not a God he is
[1:00:27] I believe that even more than I ever
[1:00:34] be on any Shadows
[1:00:38] oh church I'm sorry I'm trying to
[1:00:41] supposed to be Sunday school I'm
[1:00:42] supposed to be
[1:00:43] nice and calm right well
[1:00:48] um
[1:00:52] so sick of sick of devil just pushing us
[1:00:54] around
[1:00:55] all week long
[1:01:02] it's time to fight
[1:01:06] let's let's see what he has here
[1:01:08] so I said he was God
[1:01:11] I began to explain to him
[1:01:14] I said one God in three offices
[1:01:17] three dispensations he looked at me
[1:01:21] and said I have never heard that before
[1:01:25] he says
[1:01:27] I guess there's a lot more out there
[1:01:29] than we even know
[1:01:33] I thought for a momentum
[1:01:37] oh if I could just be there
[1:01:40] I don't know but I'm thinking this if I
[1:01:44] could just be there
[1:01:46] when the Messiah reveals himself
[1:01:54] when they're like it was him the whole
[1:01:57] time
[1:01:58] oh I wish I just pray I could go there
[1:02:03] notice this now he reveals himself and
[1:02:06] they recognize
[1:02:08] the Messiah really is
[1:02:12] she showed the sign of the Messiah
[1:02:16] to the Jews how many know that
[1:02:19] when did he show the sign of the Messiah
[1:02:24] when he's told Nathaniel
[1:02:26] before Philip called you
[1:02:30] 30 miles away on the other side of a
[1:02:33] mountain
[1:02:36] then he turns to the Samaritans
[1:02:39] chose the sign of the Messiah to the
[1:02:42] woman at the well
[1:02:45] go get your husband I don't have a
[1:02:48] husband
[1:02:50] one you have now isn't yours what was he
[1:02:54] doing
[1:02:55] showing the sign of the Messiah
[1:03:01] and now in this year
[1:03:05] he showed is
[1:03:25] what I told that young Catholic boy
[1:03:28] there there in Spain
[1:03:31] said who could know those things
[1:03:34] show me any Pope any Minister pastor
[1:03:38] Pastor who have shown the sign of the
[1:03:40] Messiah
[1:03:44] it's for real it's reality I believe it
[1:03:49] I am so convinced
[1:03:52] you say you weren't convinced before oh
[1:03:54] I was just almost but there's levels
[1:04:01] [Music]
[1:04:04] if you ever want to see the grace of God
[1:04:09] it was on perfect display
[1:04:19] Israel what a setup
[1:04:46] if you could go to Israel right now
[1:04:50] and gather all those rabbis all those
[1:04:53] leaders of the Jews
[1:04:56] he says if I were to go
[1:04:58] and I would show on the sign of the
[1:05:01] message
[1:05:03] a nation would be born in one day and he
[1:05:08] got all
[1:05:34] oh
[1:05:36] that's God's grace his Mercy
[1:05:39] holding back this is
[1:05:45] a twinkle in a twinkle of a twinkle of
[1:05:47] my dad's eye yet foreign
[1:06:02] because when the Jew
[1:06:04] s
[1:06:05] receives the gospel
[1:06:09] the Gentiles dispensation Allah
[1:06:17] believe me I'm not running over there so
[1:06:19] that it can finish
[1:06:21] but if the Holy Spirit leads us to God
[1:06:25] there's something that's preparing
[1:06:28] something
[1:06:29] I don't try to put something more on
[1:06:31] ourselves
[1:06:38] let the Lord use us as you would yes
[1:06:43] watch this God not permitting his
[1:06:46] Prophet to go on to Israel
[1:06:50] for our sake
[1:06:54] now think about when the hour arrives
[1:06:58] and the gospel is transferred to the two
[1:07:01] witnesses
[1:07:04] not only will Israel accept it
[1:07:08] now not all of Israel we know that
[1:07:13] you know that right
[1:07:15] it's not for all of Israel Israel but
[1:07:18] there is a hundred and forty four
[1:07:20] thousands
[1:07:21] the elect
[1:07:24] that will receive D
[1:07:26] stop for a moment
[1:07:29] because all these things they just make
[1:07:31] so much sense now
[1:07:35] we just heard not long ago our our Elder
[1:07:39] he spoke about when Michael shall stands
[1:07:44] if you ever see a time that Michael
[1:07:47] foreign
[1:07:59] [Music]
[1:08:13] [Music]
[1:08:24] right I'll tell you where we're gonna
[1:08:26] stand
[1:08:27] that's where we've been standing
[1:08:31] right next to Michael de Miguel what's
[1:08:34] the problem it's a problem well it's a
[1:08:36] problem I don't know if you believe me
[1:08:38] or not
[1:08:39] where are you standing
[1:08:42] we're standing next to our church
[1:08:45] this is wonderful
[1:08:47] the devil laughs at that
[1:08:51] you don't care where you go to church
[1:08:54] but when he sees something when he sees
[1:08:58] the Life of Christ
[1:09:00] why Michael is the Christ Miguel is
[1:09:04] Christo
[1:09:06] I didn't say that the prophet of God
[1:09:09] so now I'm saying it
[1:09:12] Michael is Christo and at that time
[1:09:22] the great Prince
[1:09:24] which standeth for the children
[1:09:27] of thy people
[1:09:29] and the words
[1:09:34] no matter what happened he continues
[1:09:38] Christ continues to stand continue
[1:09:46] and the enemy wants to run us down
[1:09:51] who is Michael Yes Miguel the Archangel
[1:09:54] he's the great Prince he is Christ he is
[1:09:59] the anointed one he is the anointed word
[1:10:02] of the hour is
[1:10:07] Revelations 10 1. apocalypse is and I
[1:10:10] saw
[1:10:12] another Mighty Angels
[1:10:14] come down from heaven
[1:10:16] glow with a cloud and a rainbow was upon
[1:10:19] his head
[1:10:20] is
[1:10:23] pillars of fire
[1:10:27] who is this Mighty angel poderoso
[1:10:31] and at that day and I killedia John
[1:10:34] Michael Stan Miguel I saw another mighty
[1:10:37] name brother says Revelations 10 1.
[1:10:42] it's Christ is
[1:10:47] where is he coming to
[1:10:52] a small little man from Kentucky
[1:10:56] he's gonna stand
[1:10:59] where nothing else ought to stand
[1:11:02] nothing else
[1:11:05] but Christ pero Cristo comes to this
[1:11:09] heart and he says this is
[1:11:14] watch how tremendous this is
[1:11:17] this Mighty Angel which is Christ and
[1:11:21] we've heard this time and time again
[1:11:23] standing with one foot on the sea and
[1:11:26] one foot on the earth
[1:11:28] he has jurisdiction
[1:11:31] over the Beast and the image of the
[1:11:35] Beast
[1:11:36] what is he doing he's Bridging the Gap
[1:11:42] from the Gentile dispensations
[1:11:46] Revelation 10.
[1:11:48] Revelations 11.
[1:11:51] watch him come down you gotta see this
[1:11:55] image you gotta see this drama
[1:12:35] it's the finishing up of the Gentile
[1:12:37] dispensations
[1:12:43] to Revelations 11. apocalypse the two
[1:12:46] witnesses now we're getting into
[1:12:48] something here we have heard all these
[1:12:51] things
[1:12:52] but watch it become alive to you
[1:12:55] why do you think brother Branham
[1:12:57] preaches the message
[1:12:59] standing in the gap
[1:13:03] why does he preach the message
[1:13:08] something's going on
[1:13:39] he stands in the Gap while the two
[1:13:43] prophets of Revelations 11.
[1:13:47] are called on the scene
[1:13:51] come on down amen you believe that or
[1:13:54] you don't believe uh I think I lost you
[1:13:56] already
[1:13:58] let's just
[1:14:00] say God bless you well
[1:14:03] no no come on you can't be sitting there
[1:14:06] thinking about tortillas
[1:14:16] I better stop doing that for myself
[1:14:20] watch this number
[1:14:22] Jude 1 9. the healing order who does but
[1:14:26] if there's a connection with all this
[1:14:28] and yet Michael the Archangel
[1:14:32] Miguel who's Michael again is Miguel
[1:14:37] Michael the Archangel when contending
[1:14:40] with the devil
[1:14:42] he disputed about the body of Moses
[1:14:48] does not bringing against him a real in
[1:14:51] accusation
[1:14:55] but said the Lord rebuked
[1:15:00] now now this is something so tremendous
[1:15:03] here
[1:15:04] I want you to get this
[1:15:07] why didn't Satan care so much about the
[1:15:10] body of Moses
[1:15:16] there is such a type
[1:15:18] I don't even know if I'm ready for this
[1:15:21] one
[1:15:24] there there there's such a typing Shadow
[1:15:26] here
[1:15:27] there's something that has that has he's
[1:15:30] telling us for years and years
[1:15:34] was it so that he could cause that body
[1:15:37] to seek corruption
[1:15:41] and possibly try to keep it from being
[1:15:44] used again
[1:15:49] you don't find anywhere else in the
[1:15:51] scriptures
[1:15:57] contended for any other body but Moses
[1:16:03] there's something there
[1:16:05] I mean I'd like to know what's there I
[1:16:09] might not understand it fully
[1:16:11] something is there
[1:16:14] why would Christ
[1:16:17] hide it from satanas
[1:16:22] why would the Angels be his pallbearers
[1:16:31] you don't see the resurrection
[1:16:34] what's going on here
[1:16:37] watch this now some say that Satan
[1:16:41] wanted to use that body
[1:16:43] so that the people would idolize him
[1:16:49] and make him a god
[1:16:53] there's much more than something like
[1:16:55] that
[1:16:57] for the next time that we see Moses
[1:17:03] come on now where Dundee
[1:17:05] mountains that's right now
[1:17:09] this is this is uh something so good
[1:17:14] what is he representing on Mount
[1:17:18] Transfiguration
[1:17:21] he represents the Law representative now
[1:17:25] this this just got me this morning
[1:17:26] he represents
[1:17:29] and he represents
[1:17:32] those that have died
[1:17:37] that's right and the only way that we
[1:17:40] will ever resurrect is
[1:17:42] that we have been here in Christ
[1:17:47] there's something here watch this I want
[1:17:50] I want you to get this
[1:17:52] Elijah was representing those that will
[1:17:55] not see death Elias
[1:17:57] so then why was Michael it says standing
[1:18:01] there is
[1:18:02] protecting the body of Moses
[1:18:12] come here
[1:18:19] you want to be Michael
[1:18:21] no no no no no you've got you you want
[1:18:24] to be Michael get up
[1:18:25] get up yeah you can't be you can't
[1:18:27] Michael Michael's a warrior
[1:18:30] Guerrero okay
[1:18:34] who you know you're not the devil
[1:18:37] but you're after this guy's this is
[1:18:39] Moses body
[1:18:41] you're wanting to answer this and take
[1:18:44] it you want corruption to set in
[1:18:48] so he's going to try to take it now try
[1:18:51] to lay your head wait wait wait wait
[1:18:53] you're not paying attention
[1:18:56] over there
[1:18:58] if you're going to protect something
[1:19:00] come here we need to have a little talk
[1:19:02] before yeah
[1:19:05] you're over here don't be afraid
[1:19:07] I love you
[1:19:09] so if you're gonna protect me right here
[1:19:13] and you say I'll protect you pastors
[1:19:16] and you say I'll take a bullet for you
[1:19:19] imagine this guy has a gun over there
[1:19:21] horny at me and you're like
[1:19:26] what do you do
[1:19:29] oh and there you go I knew you had
[1:19:32] okay he's trying to get the body of
[1:19:35] Moses
[1:19:37] oh
[1:19:40] there you go look him right in the eyes
[1:19:43] there now now we're getting somewhere
[1:19:48] he wants the body of Moses
[1:19:50] but Christ
[1:19:59] come on tell him something else
[1:20:08] liking this now
[1:20:10] yeah but keep doing that I'm not here
[1:20:15] back off back off tell him back up
[1:20:18] you ain't gonna get this body
[1:20:21] because Christo Michael is Christ Miguel
[1:20:26] is
[1:20:28] and I saw another mighty name
[1:20:32] what is he
[1:20:34] is
[1:20:35] transferring the message to the seven
[1:20:37] things
[1:20:50] oh church I hope you can see this thank
[1:20:52] you thank you brother I hope you see
[1:20:54] this he was protecting it because he
[1:20:58] knew that the day that Moses would
[1:21:00] return
[1:21:02] to his people the Jews
[1:21:05] the message of Grace oh you got to get
[1:21:09] this one
[1:21:09] the message of Grace for the first time
[1:21:14] would be put into the hands of the Lord
[1:21:19] that almost don't make sense
[1:21:22] how could the law handle Grace
[1:21:29] and everyone saw him and you go to
[1:21:33] Israel and what are they
[1:21:43] but Jesus said if you would have known
[1:21:47] Moses
[1:21:51] because Moses
[1:21:56] I'm getting I'm getting here some people
[1:21:58] we're coming around this corner Moses
[1:22:01] spoke of him but the law could not
[1:22:06] produce the
[1:22:08] Persona and all they know is the law
[1:22:12] said I don't think you want to be
[1:22:14] converted to judoism
[1:22:18] we have 800 laws we got to live by
[1:22:21] everything foreign
[1:22:33] [Music]
[1:23:25] because it's not just him
[1:23:30] amen Christ with two Prophets
[1:23:36] God will make the law Giver speak Grace
[1:23:41] do you see the struggle below that the
[1:23:45] Apostle Paul
[1:23:48] trying to get them from law to Grace
[1:23:52] it was a constant fight after fighting
[1:23:55] don't do this and don't do that you
[1:23:58] can't do that and you can't do this
[1:23:59] again and after a while they're like
[1:24:00] well the Gentiles have to do the same
[1:24:02] thing
[1:24:06] you know I I was not born into
[1:24:10] my parents being a apostolics or whatnot
[1:24:13] mean
[1:24:15] I was born and then they they came out
[1:24:18] into the message I don't know anything
[1:24:19] else
[1:24:22] hearing our founding pastors
[1:24:26] and he said you see where people miss it
[1:24:30] today
[1:24:30] is because they're trying to to take
[1:24:34] what they what they learned and what
[1:24:36] they knew in their denominations
[1:24:43] and they're trying to view the message
[1:24:45] through the lens of the apostolic church
[1:24:50] so that's why you have a lot of
[1:24:52] Pentecostal Apostolic ideas
[1:25:00] they act the same they do the same thing
[1:25:03] what happens after a while it's just a
[1:25:06] Reformation
[1:25:08] imagine this
[1:25:10] and those are passion would say you go
[1:25:14] to the movies
[1:25:16] for six months you you get put in prayer
[1:25:22] you've got to sit there and you can't
[1:25:24] help in the churches
[1:25:34] I'm thinking
[1:25:36] everybody will be sitting down
[1:25:40] and then they come into the message and
[1:25:42] then they read a quote
[1:25:45] Oh you get a chance
[1:25:48] that movie Ten Commandments
[1:25:52] I got a quote right here the ram said I
[1:25:56] can go see the Ten Commandments
[1:25:59] yeah
[1:26:01] and then from there it went on and on
[1:26:05] and it went on and on and then there was
[1:26:08] never a stop anymore no no every new
[1:26:11] movie comes out
[1:26:14] what happened the devil slipped in where
[1:26:18] was Michael Miguel
[1:26:25] oh
[1:26:28] they had so many things and he went on
[1:26:31] and on and if you did this and if you
[1:26:34] did that
[1:26:35] and you couldn't you couldn't help and
[1:26:38] you you know and people would look down
[1:26:40] on you
[1:26:42] the young girls would go to the restroom
[1:26:44] in church
[1:26:47] would go and follow them and be a
[1:26:49] chaperone so make sure what are you
[1:26:51] doing and then
[1:26:55] well there was no texting on their
[1:26:57] phones back then nowadays
[1:27:02] I gotta go to the restroom I I'm not
[1:27:04] checking there's there one of my
[1:27:06] universe
[1:27:09] what's the point
[1:27:11] that I'm getting there is that we bring
[1:27:14] those things into the message
[1:27:23] well let's see what happens here now
[1:27:26] still with me no idea when I started but
[1:27:29] who cares
[1:27:31] why
[1:27:33] I see this Village though there's so
[1:27:36] much struggle
[1:27:37] so much contention within ourselves
[1:27:41] what is it kids it's the struggle to
[1:27:45] take us from law is
[1:27:48] now even in the message
[1:27:58] there comes a point when the Holy Ghost
[1:28:00] dwells in your soul
[1:28:10] yeah the struggle is real la lucha is
[1:28:14] real there's never been a day like today
[1:28:18] listen closely this is why I read this
[1:28:21] there's never been a day like today
[1:28:25] yeah Satan is contending
[1:28:29] for your body
[1:28:35] and I'm not saying for everybody
[1:28:41] and that's the body of Christo
[1:28:46] right I'm gonna say it again there is no
[1:28:48] other body that Satan is content
[1:28:52] and for the bodies of the members of
[1:28:55] that body
[1:28:57] get that I'm gonna say it again he's
[1:29:00] contending for the body of the members
[1:29:03] make up the body of Christ
[1:29:07] he's contending every day
[1:29:10] your mind I think this week I counted
[1:29:14] over six seven people that I talked to
[1:29:17] say
[1:29:18] their minds they can't stop it
[1:29:21] struggle in there they're invoices
[1:29:29] why is there such a struggle come on now
[1:29:33] check your life is there something
[1:29:36] standing weird ought not to stop
[1:29:41] that they shall Michael
[1:29:52] but
[1:29:56] what Grace provided was the persona
[1:30:02] they never could find the body of Moses
[1:30:06] for it was
[1:30:13] what the Bible says that that he was
[1:30:15] buried somewhere in the valley
[1:30:18] there will be peace
[1:30:24] there will be peace peace in the valley
[1:30:28] oh for me O Lord I pray
[1:30:33] when the end came
[1:30:35] Moses climbed to the top of Mount Nebo
[1:30:39] Del Monte into the promised land
[1:30:43] death came whirl into the air
[1:30:46] I knew it was all around him
[1:30:49] Moses looked around
[1:30:51] laying there by his side
[1:30:55] they're laid the Rocka
[1:31:00] I didn't I didn't say this brother
[1:31:03] so what did he do he's doing he stepped
[1:31:07] onto the rocks
[1:31:09] that rock is Jesus Jesus or he's the one
[1:31:13] that rock is Jesus Jesus
[1:31:17] so be very sure
[1:31:19] be very sure cause your Anchor Holds
[1:31:24] it's the solids
[1:31:29] he followed it all the way through the
[1:31:31] Wilderness and then he stops or it
[1:31:33] followed him
[1:31:37] he stepped off onto the rock he said
[1:31:41] and God sent the pallbearers Angels
[1:31:44] Angels down
[1:31:48] that rock that fed him when he was
[1:31:51] hungry
[1:31:53] water when he was thirsty
[1:32:01] and at that day yeah
[1:32:07] amen say that's just for the for the
[1:32:09] Jews let me get to something a little
[1:32:12] bit then you'll see
[1:32:14] Christ through a gentile Prophet
[1:32:18] will hand over this message
[1:32:21] to Moses and in life and that's why
[1:32:25] Michael told Luther what is
[1:32:27] the Lord
[1:32:30] let's see
[1:32:32] what these prophets will be preaching
[1:32:36] how many know what the prophets will be
[1:32:38] preaching is it easy
[1:32:44] foreign
[1:33:19] they'll be preaching
[1:33:23] because there is no peace
[1:33:26] without the king of peace
[1:33:30] and they are baptizing
[1:33:33] the same way
[1:33:36] I don't know that don't excite you yes
[1:33:38] you were baptized in the name of the
[1:33:41] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:44] and he promised to give you the gift of
[1:33:46] the Holy Ghost
[1:33:47] why can't they receive that too
[1:33:52] they're baptizing the same way they're
[1:33:56] doing the same thing that the first
[1:33:57] Pentecostal fathers
[1:34:00] and many are following them
[1:34:03] but that who that Confederation is again
[1:34:07] that organization
[1:34:10] moved right on down and even the power
[1:34:13] of these prophets didn't break it
[1:34:17] not this confederation of churches
[1:34:20] as much as Powers they have it does not
[1:34:22] break
[1:34:25] we'll make it all one organization
[1:34:30] and he brings in what is it okay now
[1:34:33] here we go here here's the Here's the
[1:34:37] the the curtain being pulled back
[1:34:40] what is it
[1:34:42] the Abomination
[1:34:45] you see that no no watch what the ram
[1:34:48] says he brings in the Abomination
[1:34:53] Roman is romanismo
[1:34:57] it's more than just a building there is
[1:35:00] because everywhere you look it is a
[1:35:04] church there is Catholic church every
[1:35:07] day
[1:35:09] and they're all like if they're getting
[1:35:10] along
[1:35:15] you're standing where you are not even
[1:35:20] Christ already put one foot
[1:35:23] on the land and one of the Seas
[1:35:27] I hope you can put this all together
[1:35:29] puts it all together for you
[1:35:32] that Abomination overspreads the whole
[1:35:35] thing is
[1:35:38] what makes it the Desolation
[1:35:41] romanism spread over everywhere
[1:35:45] it makes desolation
[1:35:48] because it takes in every filthy thing
[1:35:53] come on Church
[1:35:55] don't leave it out there
[1:35:56] because within ourselves the things that
[1:36:00] we watch things
[1:36:02] what are we doing we're taking
[1:36:04] everything
[1:36:10] should be Sanctified
[1:36:13] he can stand there
[1:36:18] remember the old mother prostitute
[1:36:24] has ten horns best yeah she had a cup in
[1:36:27] her hand
[1:36:30] filthiness of her Abominations
[1:36:42] oh can you give me 15 minutes
[1:36:45] oh come on I gotta get this
[1:36:48] romanismo
[1:36:55] we got there on the 15 and I'm not
[1:36:56] trying to make something I'm just giving
[1:36:58] you some dates
[1:36:59] we got there on the 15th of September
[1:37:02] and those of you that were aware of it
[1:37:05] country of Kazakhstan
[1:37:09] the pope met
[1:37:12] Papa
[1:37:14] it was the seventh congress
[1:37:17] not by coincidence it was the seventh
[1:37:20] Congress
[1:37:21] of the leaders of world and traditional
[1:37:25] religions
[1:37:29] September 14th and 15th
[1:37:32] delegates from over 50 countries met
[1:37:38] in peace and unity from all of the
[1:37:41] religions
[1:37:47] Hinduism Hinduism other religions
[1:37:51] Pope Francis says
[1:37:53] the church believes yeah that all
[1:37:57] Humanity
[1:37:58] forms but one community
[1:38:00] and wishes to continue to do so
[1:38:04] the path of inter-religious dialogue
[1:38:09] is a shared path to peace
[1:38:16] he went on to recall his motto his motto
[1:38:19] for the for the for this visit
[1:38:24] messengers of peace
[1:38:31] amen
[1:38:33] you see how romanism will rule the world
[1:38:38] so how can they achieve peace without
[1:38:40] the king of peace
[1:38:44] I'm gonna change the message a little
[1:38:46] bit
[1:38:47] I want you to come here to get something
[1:38:51] but let's see
[1:39:01] let's see how the Hebrews Hebrews view
[1:39:04] peace
[1:39:05] for a little bit more yeah
[1:39:23] now watch
[1:39:26] they use the word Shalom
[1:39:29] and I think we've all have used it at
[1:39:32] one time
[1:39:37] and to us it's like how are you
[1:39:46] this book that I was reading
[1:39:48] listening to the language of the Bible
[1:39:52] to us westerners
[1:39:54] we understand peace
[1:39:57] as the absence of War absence
[1:40:01] or as the calmness of our spirit
[1:40:07] impasse
[1:40:09] there's no war going on
[1:40:13] then go pass careful we don't say peace
[1:40:16] and security
[1:40:18] and those these I though these ideas are
[1:40:21] included in the word peace
[1:40:24] there is so much more
[1:40:27] it carries a greater connotation
[1:40:31] of well-being
[1:40:33] salute safety Prosperity Prosperity
[1:40:37] wholeness
[1:40:39] so when they say shalom
[1:40:42] shalom they mean the whole thing
[1:40:46] in modern Hebrew
[1:40:48] common Greek greeting would be how are
[1:40:51] you normal
[1:40:55] they say
[1:40:58] I'm Grace is going to get me for this
[1:40:59] she said dad you better go too
[1:41:03] you hear Hebrew you hear the little it
[1:41:07] was not too hard
[1:41:14] so it's
[1:41:19] better okay
[1:41:21] this little this literally means is
[1:41:26] Shalom how is your peace
[1:41:30] just just give me your attention just
[1:41:33] for the next 15 minutes how
[1:41:38] I'm asking each one of you this morning
[1:41:42] how is your peace
[1:41:46] nobody can answer that but you not yet
[1:41:49] how is your peace when we when we see
[1:41:54] this too
[1:41:55] sometimes we think of
[1:41:58] that if our relationship with God Is
[1:42:01] Right with God
[1:42:03] our relationship with each other doesn't
[1:42:05] matter is
[1:42:08] important yes

[1:42:24] that
[1:42:26] how can God
[1:42:28] even receive your worship
[1:42:32] if you are not at peace you still
[1:42:36] understand past
[1:42:37] and not now think about this because
[1:42:39] because it all makes sense now
[1:42:41] if you come to the altar to offer your
[1:42:44] gift
[1:42:45] there you remember
[1:42:47] that that your brother has ought against
[1:42:50] you
[1:42:52] don't give your gift yet leave it at the
[1:42:55] altar but go and make it right
[1:42:59] if you're trying to to worship
[1:43:02] give your gift to God
[1:43:06] you're not at peace with your brothers
[1:43:13] say it again in vain do we worship
[1:43:18] who are we trying to fool well we're
[1:43:21] ready to go to heaven

[1:43:34] is your peace I don't know ask your
[1:43:36] neighbors
[1:43:37] come on now think about it what have you
[1:43:39] done to your neighbors what have you
[1:43:41] spoken against oh
[1:43:44] hmm
[1:43:46] this qualifies to be a peace offering
[1:43:50] the most sacrificial offerings were
[1:43:54] given entirely to God so foreign
[1:44:20] amen
[1:44:22] a peace offering friend of the past part
[1:44:25] was given to God's part was eaten by
[1:44:28] them familiar
[1:44:32] the Bible tells us
[1:44:34] follow peace with all answers
[1:44:52] without which no man shall see the Lord
[1:44:57] he wants our worship our offerings
[1:45:02] come from a heart that is at peace
[1:45:06] how was your peace this morning
[1:45:09] I don't know how I'm asking you
[1:45:11] I was your peace
[1:45:14] no matter if the whole world is falling
[1:45:16] apart
[1:45:18] as long as your soul is at rest and at
[1:45:21] peace
[1:45:30] a lot of turmoil
[1:45:38] but you can't get away from yourself
[1:45:45] I'm coming around this corner
[1:45:51] like never before
[1:46:00] interior there's something standing
[1:46:03] there in your life not
[1:46:07] foreign
[1:46:41] that's why he would send Elijah
[1:46:48] foreign
[1:47:21] behold I send you a key
[1:47:25] Elijah Elias El profeta what was it
[1:47:29] going to do build the temple
[1:47:32] he's building it is
[1:47:37] do not you know that you are the temple
[1:47:43] I stood there at that Temple Mount
[1:47:46] where that holy of holies
[1:47:50] but in the midst of it I hear it again
[1:47:56] maybe you're going through some hard
[1:47:58] times
[1:47:59] there's things that we carry around
[1:48:01] That's Heavy
[1:48:03] while listening
[1:48:09] these things mess with our minds our
[1:48:12] emotions
[1:48:17] till it leaves us
[1:48:21] no self-esteem
[1:48:24] restaurant
[1:48:50] [Music]
[1:49:01] Jamar
[1:49:25] amen what a purpose church not just to
[1:49:29] condemn this to call us out
[1:49:34] as many as I love I rebuke and chasing
[1:49:37] Jesus
[1:49:40] see this and I say thank you Lord
[1:49:43] you feel pretty bad sometimes
[1:49:46] oh those Jews they really are
[1:49:49] discipline this is
[1:49:55] the prophet
[1:49:57] Christ standing where it ought to
[1:50:00] he
[1:51:00] went to the temple and he beat him out
[1:51:02] of there
[1:51:03] but those priests were gentle and meek
[1:51:06] and understanding
[1:51:09] they come to the fruits of the spirit
[1:51:11] because
[1:51:12] they could show more fruits of the
[1:51:15] spirit than Jesus ever could because
[1:51:19] when it comes to theology
[1:51:22] but then when he began to speak
[1:51:26] they said when's cometh this man
[1:51:29] where did he come from what Fellowship
[1:51:32] what organization organization they had
[1:51:36] a right to do what they did
[1:51:38] but what they failed to understand
[1:51:41] they failed to see that he was that the
[1:51:44] promised word of the hour
[1:51:46] he was the word
[1:51:49] all the other were prophets of God
[1:51:52] but he was the god Prophet
[1:51:56] not the prophet of God
[1:52:00] was God the problem
[1:52:03] and the Pharisees in those days lived a
[1:52:06] lot Holier life
[1:52:09] any of us here in America
[1:52:12] but they were Sinners because they
[1:52:16] disbelief Christ
[1:52:22] God wanted to decide what kind of church
[1:52:24] he wanted
[1:52:27] it was a Spirit-filled church
[1:52:31] and if you haven't met that conference
[1:52:34] yet
[1:52:35] then raise your hand
[1:52:40] they knew the scriptures
[1:52:47] they knew the word
[1:52:53] that's hard to grasp sometimes
[1:52:58] but I want to tell you young people
[1:53:00] you should know the Bible yes
[1:53:09] but it's not how much
[1:53:11] Bruno
[1:53:43] that's the relationship you can't stand
[1:53:46] over here and say I know Christ remember
[1:53:49] what we talked about I got a lot of
[1:53:51] facts about Christ I know what he's
[1:53:53] supposed to do but have you become one
[1:53:55] with him

[1:54:02] Persona I just want to end with brother
