people in your precious name we pray the Lord Jesus Christ amen so we uh we we have in front of us tonight a theme a topic of of course portals and dimensions and uh you know it was this was uh pretty pretty rough topic to study but by the grace of almighty God you know we have we have a uh we have an our amazing Pastor that that stepped in and being being that obviously to the church by the grace of God so without further Ado let's let's open our our Bibles to the Book of John chapter 10 verse 9. and we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna talk about about some things here so let's let's let's read the scripture and it says I am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and he and shall go in and out is amen so let's start there brother Jerry and and we're gonna we're gonna start off with with the definition of of a portal okay and and get into that and we're going to take it we're gonna take this this this study tonight maybe guys maybe from from uh from an outside in perspective I I think we look at it from maybe uh um Outer Outer Space to um all right so so definition of a portal is a door um an entrance especially a grand or imposing one [Music] uh some of the some of the synonyms uh basically the the words that mean the same thing a door foreign [Music] um and and and you'll see later on from one thing to another um and and so so I'm gonna I'm gonna go ahead and go ahead and and uh see if the guys want to start talking here brother Jerry can you can you talk to us about in about outer space where we found ourselves so taking what we know so we create a kind of an outline so we took what brother Brandon would say that above us is so so starting off like I said starting with what we know principiano we know that um obviously like I said it's a doorway into something and uh so we got to bring him down from God above us in space and the reason that we have to do that is God above us that he's not reachable sovereign and the topic itself is full of portals right you start studying one one line before you know it you've transported to you know over there yeah so so uh so yeah let's let's let's take that so outer space got it got above us uh can you can you tell us a little bit about um the Tower of Babel give us the starting point of the Tower of Babel there see because on that really kind of sideways so so what they were trying to do look at but humans always try to do they always try to reach God right so they were trying to find that portal even at portal so speaking about speaking of outer space we'll get we'll get to that here in a little bit absolutely but um you know I growing up when I came into this message I think it was about 115 going on 16. and uh we're talking about outer space and Inner Space we know that there's portals that are out there right out in space that's that's truth we know that there's portals in in in in us we'll get we'll get at least growing up you know a lot of things happened to me that I didn't understand until until now that I've I've been in the message you know so many years and visions that I thought I thought was just crazy crazy you know I used to call my cousin Jerry a lot I had some weird some weird things happen to me and I remember one of the first this wasn't the first but one of the first was um I I was I was at home one time yesterday and I don't know I was probably about 20 I think and we all have hard times right in our lives and I was going to be going through a really rough time with with my family yesterday and I remember I was praying to God so much that night he just did and this sounds crazy but this guy can vouch for me but what I'm going to say because Tommy you indicated it so I'm praying to God at night and asked Lord I said Lord you know I don't want to commit suicide or anything like that I want you to take my life I want to feel what I feel you know I just want to be out of here so that night I went to sleep and I fell asleep on the couch and uh I remember all of a sudden I was out I was outside outside of myself looking at myself and uh uh I just I remember taking a breath out and when I did that but whether it be my spirit Soul whatever you want to call I just I just saw it just start floating up in the air and it was just floating and uh when they get kind of got out of this atmosphere I remember just it just boom it went into space I know this sounds weird but what you'll see at the end it was weird to me um but I remember just going through passing stars and and going through like like when I was going through a path I mean not Jet Fast just I mean stars are so far apart but the stars were just passing just really really really really fast and I remember that I was going to a place and I remember that I could think but I remember thinking oh my gosh this is this is real like he really did take me and I was going to this place at this you know the speed of light I don't know what you would want to call it and I remember the first thing that I thought when I was going to this place I'm gonna miss my mom and dad too much and as I was going that fast I just came to a complete stop and when I came to a complete stop like that started going backwards and I started seeing the stars going this way and I remember getting back into you would want to call Earth's atmosphere Earth's atmosphere [Music] and uh I remember just starting to float again and I saw myself on the couch again and I took a breath in this time to myself now I remember thinking to myself oh my gosh like I woke up and I put it like two in the morning and I was like so scared and freaked out uh that's what we kind of God started dealing with me and things like that yes well you're so you forgot to say this you were so scared that you called me at two in the morning I was so scared that I I got up and and I called my cousin Jerry because I was like and I started to tell them exactly what happened and I said man I know that sounds weird but it just felt so real you know um and I said I told Jerry this I said you know Jerry the only way that I can explain it if you've ever seen that movie contacts the only way that I could more or less describe it is so that's that's what I had told you correct so then anyway I don't know two three weeks later come over here and uh uh we have some services in Silver City so Tommy calls for all of us to go over there and uh well he's preaching he's going to town and he's you know he's you know you know I'm gonna say right he's he's just under the 19 and just and he starts talking about you know death and traveling like that I happen to be looking I think me and my cousin Jerry were either next to each other across each other I can't remember exactly as he's talking about this traveling he says you know what you know what it's a lot like you guys should watch the movie contact and I looked at Jerry and I was like whoa all but we were both like that right so so brother brother Lorenzo could could you have called that an out of Body Experience okay and we've we've heard a lot of examples of that right yeah who died and they they go and they come back and so in a lot of ways that's that's that's where where we were we kind of we kind of where we're going with with the Tower of Babel yes trying to reach God right trying to reach God having some sort of out of out-of-body experience right man trying to reach God in a way that's that's not really intended and so at the Tower of Babel we all know what what went on there and a little bit deeper and kind of explain some of it I mean we all know what they were trying to do was they brother Branham says man tries to reach God and they do it in a perverted way and they're doing all this stuff trying to reaches and of course they're all in one language and God comes and he scrambles up all their languages right to put a stop to that they started to to get into God's Laboratories and that's that's God won't he won't do that so brother Jerry if that's the perverted way Hermanos and that's that's outer space right so so what we need to find out is is what's God's intended and furthermore what what is our role what is what do portals mean to us what what do we do what what does that have to do with us right so so that's where we're gonna we're gonna maybe turn the corner and let's let's go interspace let's go there the Inner Space and and and and let's talk about that Jerry if you wanted that quote there and we can kind of kind of finish up the thought there let me let me just uh go ahead insert this year yeah we're talking about that above us unattainable unreachable yes the Tower of Babel literally means the Gate of God as part of the root word yes so a man with his own ideas so we we see how that the the god of of Heaven the you know Elohim regard he was manifested in the flesh he's bringing them down from the constellations down to the human being okay so he's showing you it's it's the model is the model is of what we need to be and we're going to go into that more but but you see like I said because you got to remember like us as human beings and we're going to talk about that there's an eternal part of you but before we jump into you got in us I wanted to make sure that we talked about the portal God With Us first that's what things get interesting so that's like I said so make sure you put your spiritual thinking cap is because there's some good stuff in there all right so so do we want to go and read this quote here brother Jerry um you want to read that if you want to read the highlighted part and and kind of go on that okay yeah sure so it's 41 right so do you see that uh I don't know if they were able to get the hopefully they were but okay so it's a quote the Inside Man 41. so watch watch how he he brings them from light uh what he talks about in when he's in that form watch there he is in the pillar of fires no one could touch him he's holy no one can come near him no sir no Senor and when he settled on that mountain is Commandments because remember when he would speak to the children of Israel back then it was God above them right but they were scared they would tremble because he said the mountain would Shake even to the point where Moses he he would say was fearful he was fearful of that is so great to leave him Moses himself dreaded it says and the people said don't let God speak thus we die let Moses speak to us but you see how it's coming down now from the from the Heavenly us to the human being and even if a beast touch that mountain I want to see soon killed he said now watch the love of God and Allah to make you start praying for a Revival um condescending coming down unfolding himself then God appeared there in a pillar of fire then the next time he appeared was when he appeared in his son Christ Jesus Christ Jesus he overshadowed a virgin real the blood cells that brought forth the Son of God and God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and so we have we have outer space right we have yeah right and he begins to condescend down he begins to to to make a journey down into mortal man right and so so the Inner Space that we want to talk about it is is when God comes in and dwells inside of the Believers and he and he begins to occupy that space inside and then and then that that Inner Space it it pertains to to the Inner Man where that inner man dwells because the reality of it is is that's who you and I really are yes we're not this Corporal body that you and I see there's an inner man inside that's that part that pertains to God right and so so we want to we want to focus on that and and we see that we see now God and Jesus Christ becoming the ultimate portal God became man and he opened up the ultimate portal and he came to redeem back right read John 14 4 6. and whether I go eat and whether I go ye no and ye the way you know Thomas saith the next one Thomas saith unto him Lord we know not whether thou's go and how can we know the way Jesus saith unto them I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me so notice not only is is is he the ultimate portal is but he's making it plainly clear I am the way Jose I am the only way right he's making he's making a statement here that the majority of the world didn't understand but the statement he's making is I am the ultimate portal you want you want to get to the father there's only one way there's not there's not a not an end around there's not a secret passage it's right here and so and so we see that in that scripture and how beautiful full that scripture is Jesus saith unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me I want to make sure we clarify that amen get those scriptures correctly correctly quoted there so so the last part so Jerry the the last part of that quote he he appeared in the visible form of Jesus Christ and and he overshadowed a virgin he creates the blood cells right and and it's God in Christ is brother Enzo he's reconciling he's working to reconcile the world to himself so he's in process right so very much like like the believer we find ourselves in a process right the stature of the perfect man and it's it's a it's a process but it's it's also a portal right because that stature is is the it's the return path is it is so so let's let's go down a little more here oh yeah no no um I was saying um so during that process we go through low Times Hard Times right does that correct anybody have a hard time to get rough sometimes but but there's a very interesting point here that brother Lorenzo is gonna um I thought it was really good on Jacob Jacob's troubles yes we we went in in Los Angeles so with Jacob's uh Jacob's troubles uh Jacob's Ladder they they had cope um we see here that when Jacob when he was running away that Jacob rested his head on a stone he rested his head on a rock because there was gonna be a a a place there was going to be an encounter that's why and uh but if you if you notice this is he rested his head on a rock how many have a nice fluffy pillow at home right maybe even a couple one that you hug but he did he rested his head on a stone to make him uncomfortable [Music] yet he rested his head on the Revelation when brother Branham when brother Branham uh uh went beyond the current of time he said I preach what Paul preached and the Saints say yeah Jesus said Upon This Rock I will build my church so it's crazy it's it's it's it's it's crazy because Jesus wants you uncomfortable in order for you to rest because when you're uncomfortable you can continue to go forward that's when you continue to have to strive for Jesus Christ that's when you have to get your relationship even closer to Jesus Christ as we were studying you know we had night upon night upon night Studio and uh uh my cousin Jerry yeah with different things different experiences that have happened in my life that that I'm understanding a little bit more now uh you know our he asked me the question one night before we left he said what triggers that okay okay maybe a dream he said what triggers that okay and I'm looking at him I don't know I don't know and let me just say we went round and rounds we were we were everywhere but thank the Lord that that our pastor knows yeah because our pastor then he's he's there the following the following uh uh studies and uh we're talking and and brother and you know he doesn't know that we asked this question right that brother Jerry had asked me this question but we were talking about different dreams and things like that and then brother Caleb he looks at me and he says what triggers that exactly right that's exactly right so here we we we see that J doesn't really start to interject it's a place of encounter to see what decision you're going to make amen so we see here that Jacob he sees he sees a ladder right and what does he see in this in this ladder he sees Angels now I wanna you guys take this take this into into mind okay keep this in the mind the Bible says that the latter came from the earth up to heaven okay so it came from the earth up to heaven from the earth up to heaven he saw angels ascending evil and what were these Angels doing these angels you think that your prayers aren't heard these angels for taking everybody's prayers it would take them up to the Lord and they would descend with angels back with answers the Saints of cedar like we said the latter came from Earth up to heaven can we put that picture up please now here's here's the thing here let me get into this real quick here I'm going to read this uh brother Branham he says he says about the latter I wasn't going to read this but I like this he said he gets a ladder you know like what that play Leo where the man put the ladder outside of the house Romeo and Juliet that's right put the ladder up and stole his bride away now he's just coming down Jacob's Ladder and saying yeah whatever it had to have been a spiral because this ladder was a portal let me read here it said and did you ever think of the Tower of Babel is and compare it with Jacob's Ladder how that they were trying to build stairs around and we'll reach up to heaven only trying to pervert Jacob's Ladder which reached from the Heavens to Earth and the angels descending is now I say I say this [Music] that produced the ultimate portal Tommy says something when I look at the cross I look like through the cross I'm looking through the portal can we can we uh can we play that that uh tape please momentum look at the cross you know they they felt that they had to do certain things so they saw grief and pain and sorrow but I don't see the cross you don't see the crossbar parents I see through the cross through the cross is the promises if you see to the Cross you see pain and grief but you see through the cross you see joy and happiness you see the promises you see the best of God the trust of God wasn't on the cross the best of God what I see but when the best of God was through the cross turn around and look at your name look at the best of God that's the best of God Amen if I ask if if I ask brother Benji who's your better half you're gonna say well your wife says that's tremendous but we gotta hit this point here because you look at you you just turn around and looked at everybody and we saw that ladder that was going to heaven and we saw the Angels ascending and descending what are they descending to I don't understand that picture that you put up is none other than what's called a double helix double helix so the double helix is the DNA stranded is it a coincidence that it looks like that spiral ladder yeah I see you see it shows the portal but it's showing you where he's gonna be watch the scripture what's the scripture first John 4 1. beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits where they're there of God because many false prophets are gone into the world espiritus is the spirit of God is watch this every spirit that does not confess that Jesus is coming the flesh Jesus come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ Has Come In the Flesh and this is the spirit of antichrist yes you see he's showing you the process now because God was manifested In the Flesh in Jesus Christ the scripture doesn't say that the scriptures now says that Jesus now has come in flesh so the question is as Jesus come in your flesh is foreign hate it when you call me Lance man she'll do it 15 years later you still do it yeah but when I look at Brother Carlos when I look at brother Jerry and I look at the Christ in them there's a connection there not even a razor blade can get I remember our founding pastures he said what is it that you love about me and our Pastor said while he said a few different answers I believe um and he said but there's nothing like that I love more than the Christ that lives inside of you know maybe we need more of looking through the cross at one another as opposed to as opposed to just at one another right remember brother he said well you see a beautiful woman walking down that I put across there when I looked that beautiful woman I look at the cross keeping that in mind remember it's not it's not Nails scarred hands it's scarred men and women that's looking through the cross bringing it to today bringing it to now Inner Space has he come into your flesh this is and put in the the picture of our Prophet there is I want to show you the the Heavenly and the Earth and see how that portal was wide open all the God was important to Christ amen all he was important to Christ all the Christ was important to the church so we see in that picture of the emptying out into into this man and through his let me ask you this yes sir can you say that that remember through that condensation condensation through all of God pouring from one to the other to the other right could that be portals opening up that's why he preached doors and doors let me prove it to you did it stay in brother Branham if you did we're lost we saw now how we went to the apostles you see man like brother Bernie hermano Tomas are founding pastors the condensation of God all the Christ was going out to these men and now these men interns the portal never stops that portal that that portal it just keeps opening you see you didn't even mention this word forget it he laid his head so he rested on that Revelation Revelation he rested on his head the Revelation was on the head remember the Gateway Babylon and Babel was man's ideas trying to reach they didn't have leadership tried no had a perverted a perverted method right absolutely amen amen so we see remember first base right Jesus Christ he's all in all he's he's the whole thing he's the whole reason right second base you have the prophet all that God was he poured oh look Third Base your pastor the ministry ministerio we become portals and this is where it gets really interesting because it doesn't stop there church that portal does not stop it didn't stop at brother Brown there's an ongoing thing that to become the portal it becomes it becometh all of us to fulfill that part of God to fulfill that action of God that he started in the beginning which was to become the ultimate portal to become the doorway to someone who became the doorway to someone who became the doorway to someone and so on and so on Brother Carlos is is that why Hermanos when when Christ lives inside of you and you go into a home that's maybe broken or having a hard time because our human Minds the first thing that we process with that statement is I'm gonna go create a planet right next to Mars but it doesn't have nothing to do with that it means that I can create a world here because Having the Holy Spirit is having full control of this you walk into a rough situation and then have the ability to use God's creative Powers through the portal of Jesus Christ and become a portal to those people to look through the cross and bring life and peace man that's what we have to be today so that's what the whole process of the individual of cleaning out these channels like you've heard is preach those messages that's the issue that we have that holds us back is those our channels are so clogged with so many things our own portal absolutely what what what what portals right we're a true iron Bean right right so what what are our books affection conscience consensus imagination imagination uh to the soul it's just either Faith or doubt so now as we as we start to bring this down and we start to see God coming all the way down to the individuals then we start to to get an understanding of of what happens inside of us and brother Jerry alluded to to the conscience and subconscious bro Jerry can you can you tell us a little bit about why a prophet is so special um what we know for him to have a vision right he's always he's in that and he can be in two places at once that's why there's this thing going around on the internet where they say they brother Brandon blind gay recently because he was he hunting javelinas or with you where the cloud was right it's simple it's simple he was in two Dimensions at once so I don't know what the what the deal is a simple one right number one I think we have seen that like the first night this question came up but you see the you see the portals right yeah go ahead as far as the sub uh the conscience the subconscious you know and I don't know why I felt like saying this but but I remember brother Tommy once saying be careful he said be very careful and who you dream about because your contact you you may start to contact their theophany man so so you see you see the things that a lot of times we don't understand why do we why do we have maybe bad dreams why do we dream things that we that we that we we do sometimes and as you as you start to see this these portals unfold you start to get a glimpse of the dimensions and and so as as you see them these different portals and these different things that open and I mean you start to understand hang on a minute there's there's there's things that influence there's things that affect us that that are that are Beyond this world they're Supernatural is and you start to understand that that you know we have these dreams we have Vision sometimes we we travel I I like just share an experience that I had and this was years ago I'd share this with our pastor and uh this is regarding uh uh the fifth Dimensions I fell asleep and uh I woke up in this place and he had three creatures uh running after him yeah now picture this okay picture yourself running a full Sprint from here to your car oh okay from here to there you're gonna be tired that place you're in a full I remember being there and I said wow there's levels to this place is these creatures just after them and and yeah and uh it's a place you know I don't care what you're going through uh um it's a place that you don't want to yeah it's a place where a nightmare never ends I remember it being so hot in this place and knowing that I was only at a first level but it being so hot yes but I remember thinking if I could just have a little bit of water on my tongue a rich young roller yeah and I remember that this person couldn't see me but there was a little a little uh dot like this and it opened like this is a person was able to see my face and the person saw me and said so and so was my only hope now is now if I could just continue just a little bit more with that being said there's a better place there's a place that where the Saints Go Santos there's a there's a place called the sixth Dimensions I remember that and I had said this before that I had seen just some Rolling Hills and there was something that I didn't understand about about this this dream is but our pastor again not knowing what was going on I I saw sister I saw sister Viola and my dream I had said I Stay it put I didn't I didn't walk towards hernia but he was walking towards me and and again uh when she came to me she said what's the matter again I was bothered in trouble I started to tell her all these things that bother me and I remember saying well she kind of giggled and put her head up a little bit a couple times that I've been able to see her she reminds me so much of brother brother will love us and I remember her saying all those things you'll find out it really didn't matter well let me get to what I didn't understand what I didn't understand I said Lord was that dream of you or was it just whatever because humans after the after the witch of indoor and all that humans can't no contact anymore and I kept that with me for I don't know a couple years but I just a month I happen to be having lunch at brother Caleb's house and he mentioned this that I wouldn't even mention the dream but I can't remember what what part of the conversation we were in but he said brother Bernie had said Rachel he said it's one thing if you're trying to contact the dead now I know why I didn't go to school he said it's another thing when they're coming to you man so we see we see that at these portals they open but brother Jerry why is it so important that um to both our our body and investors why is it so important that then that those are are are clean and right and pure and good it's an important well it's imperative right but let's show you how so how do we get there how does that happen many different ways but to sum it up a little bit for the for the teaching here so if you put up the put up the picture of the two pyramids yeah so so I had him so so this is a message I don't recall the message okay but I have the quote brother running uh you know he gave it to me so I don't remember the message in particular but I remember this so he was talking we're not pyramid teaching the reasons because number one we know that that The Pyramid in Egypt the second Bible right and we see that the statue of a perfect band is is the pyramid shape but I found something very interesting the way he teaches it is put your spiritual caps on okay spiritual just follow me on this little journey okay he hits the stages of Grace on towards the bottom of that pyramid and it says um pictures of being there in the in both pyramids okay like if we were before them stages of Grace justification sanctification baptism of the Holy ghosts so that brings you into the pyramid and then he says are you born again you still have to climb today you still have to climb that mountains you still have to climb the statue of a person but he the way he hits it in the natural pyramid he says you enter at the base of the pyramid this is and you can look at pictures in on the internet of where they go inside the pyramid he says but you go up a little bit service Poco and he says there's a little shaft there like a little window you can see the star there is and he says I'll read it to you if I had a Blackboard I would I would put a pyramid here and I will show you the stars that brings light to the passageway is but I would also show you a turning of a corner where no more stars [Music] where there's no more they're a star Estrella but it comes to a place where the person entering into the chamber entrance of the king Del Rey when the person enters into this chain he doesn't see a story anymore Guided by like a magnet is so I wonder what pulls that Capstone down excuse me but pulling him towards that chamber in other words it's an instinct inside of him already let me let me read this uh this um these other ones I got to get this point out really quick so he you see we enter into the pyramid we're going through the steps of a perfectness you get to the point where we can see the profit but if you stay there well I mean we always have number one it's Christ in all things it's Christ in all things if you stay just with your eye on just the profit you're going to end up in outer space uh but now think of this in an individual mode on an individual level each person each individual Persona has to climb the mountains to get to the king's chamber uh so the angel of the church and right there there's an angel let me ask you a question is I'm talking about personally to you now the individual the only one I see is so this Angel of the church brings you to the realization because climbing the status these channels we get to get unclogged right and we began to see how natural now to the fourth mentioned we're gonna we're gonna enter in Dimensions right at the fourth dimension and why people because that's the dimension that pertains to us and right now there's a squatter on our land there's a there's a squatter on our property Satan has control of that fourth dimension that fourth dimension is where you find all the different television waves all the different you know all the different wavelengths and frequencies they run through that Dimension but notice that that when you when you dream and you have a nightmare that portal opens up and you contact the fourth dimension all the different all the different horror movies and all the junk that you see on TV and all that comes out all the junk that you see on YouTube and all those different things it's because there's somebody there that's opening a portal and they understand how to do it they understand how to get into that Dimension and how to how to pull down all of those influences and then they take them and they turn them into movies and they turn them in the books yeah they turn them in all these things uh I remember in high school I had a I had a teacher Maestro he was like a retired military way up there foreign [Laughter] in a nutshell he just said if we know this much in the military he said we know that voices travel around the world and we're so Advanced that our top secret weapons he goes and he goes you guys won't believe me but we're afraid so so we we see this this fourth dimension and every time that either brother Branham or our founding Pastor is they always describe it as a faster Dimensions it's so much faster than we could ever comprehend is but what I really want to get to in the time that we have left is again we think of when we talk about Dimensions we think I'm outerworldly we think of outer space but I want you to know if one of us has a fourth dimension inside of us so the question is what is in our fourth dimension right it's not the television that's the problem it's what we channel it's not the internet that's the issue it's what and you type in your search and you open that portal and you can open the fourth dimension and you can look straight into that place so going back to the Statue of a perfect man again we keep we keep thinking outer space right we keep thinking in the future but casting Satan down from the fourth dimension is a daily thing [Music] it's every hour every minute every second that's why the Bible says You Gotta Fight for every inch of ground because every step you take that fourth dimension gets a little closer because when when the when when the Bible says that we'll meet him in the air it's not talking about somewhere out there in space it's talking about that fourth dimension that's the place that belongs to us this is the Bride of Jesus Christ and it become with us to evict the squatter every day every minute every hour so I guess to sum it up guys keep your portals clean keep your channels clean that you are a clean portal that you can become a clean portal to someone else because that's what Jesus Christ came to do amen amen man let us stand oh I'm sorry no please hold on hold on hold on we got some it just got good now it would not be complete if the portal of the church hey hey [Applause] all I can say is wow look at places that's good stuff you know I I there's not a whole lot I mean you can say a few things but there's to add to what was said it's no it's the president put a cherry on the top the Bible says in Matthew the seventh chapter it's so important to understand this is the Bible says enter ye in at the Straight Gate this portal that we're talking about the Holy Ghost is that portal now it says entering at the Straight Gate for wide is the gate and Broad is the way that leadth to destruction and many there be that will go there because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leads unto life and few there be that will find it you're gonna find that this is tremendous tremendous now now this is what I was just telling the telling these men and and while they're they're they are capable more than capable of of uh of dealing and And discussing this this subject is but I I said I want you to notice how the Dimensions change if you're in a certain place something can be one-dimensional you start getting into different places four dimensions but but this is this is what we're getting now is that as they were speaking about Jacob's Ladder the Bible says that that ladder was from and Angels ascending yeah now that's what the scripture says but if you notice there is only one other place there is only one other place in the in the whole scripture that talks about angels ascending and descending and that is in the New Testament yes and this is this is the scripture if you want to write it down now now just for a moment I'm not going to keep you long but but it happened when when Philip went to call Nathaniel Felipe and he says he says he he comes back and he's and he says well Nathaniel's saying anything good come out of Nazareth are you serious the main portal came so he gave him the best answer that he could give anyone was come and see you want to see what came out of Nazareth and there he begins to tell him and he says how did you know me and then he added this is John 1 and it's 47-51 but you can you can read it when you get home and then he added verily truly I tell you you will see Heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending not from Heaven to Earth anymore you'll see Angels ascending and descending but now it's a descending on the son of man it was always that you would go to a certain place every civilization has for those places but when Jesus Christ it wasn't any specific Place anymore because the portal now was from heaven and you'll see them descending on the son of man now he's not coming to this earth it's coming to this earth now and he is the portal and that's why anywhere he went is it didn't have to be in a specific point anymore wherever he is if he dwells in you then you become now now it didn't stop there though I'll get going I won't stop looking lucky but I'll just I'm just gonna end with this then when else was those angels ascending and descending when else was simply if he says it'll they'll descend on the son of man and the son of man was revealed again in our time in a prophet and that's why February 28 1963 an angel an Earthly Angel send it on high from eternity came seven angels and they met together they were descending upon the son of man God bless you we were able to cheat just a little bit less [Applause] thank you [Music] amen God bless his word this evening [Music] and his grace [Music] [Music] see
