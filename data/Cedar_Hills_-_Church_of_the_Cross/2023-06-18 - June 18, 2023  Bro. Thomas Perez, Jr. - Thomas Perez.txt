something very special today I just wanted to give a little short testimony before I share what I'm gonna share um I was looking at this um and I was drawn to two places in the face uh the eyes and the bottom the mouth I saw the eyes that were deep set foreign there was this Vision that he was looking for far into the future yes and it was like like a dark clouds uh tormentors but as he was doing as he was looking that was my take on it as he was looking the bottom part of his mouth was curled a little bit down like he wanted to laugh and and to me it was like he was saying I see you devil out there stirring some problems in the future but I've got news for you the account was settled on Calvary o and the greater one lives inside of me come on give it your best shot I'm not alone nostal solo he is with me amen amen God bless you um this is called I love a good challenge some say I'm too young unqualified too old unstable but I would ask you to show me in my word where I am not able from Abraham to the apostles I used each one because they believed they went and subdued kingdoms obtained promises and through faith received it is time it is time for the plans I have for you to unfold many will be your testimonies as you believe in my word as you surrender your will to mine you'll be set free you'll walk by faith and not by sight and in perfect Liberty or I'm not a

his greetings and he wanted to wish each and every father a Happy Father's Day and that's from brother brother Caleb our pastor and sister Lorena is amen we're grateful to to the Lord that he has allowed our pastor to get some well-deserved time is foreign says when you have it you can say it reads like this as he said it remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in Aura for all Israel with the statues and judgments behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with Acres amen Lord Jesus Daniel Jesus very happy to be here this morning don't believe this is you are our heavenly father it is and we're grateful that we are your children this is happy to be called your children where we're here we're here this morning into celebration as as they say Father's Day in celebration but every day should be a Father's day every day should be a Mother's Day every day should be a brother's day I know A Sister's Day and the other Hermanas God's children State and we're grateful that we are our life is here and that that we are breathing this morning for every breath that we take is because you allow it thank you for life there's so much to give you thanks we would tell you everything that there is in the human vocabulary there would not be enough adjectives to describe and when Isaiah gave everything that he good good to describe your name Shall be Called wonderful numbers and you have been wonderful yes ask that you anoint your people in Jesus name amen you may be seated in the presence of the Lord it's so good to see everyone that it was gone that is that is now back and there's a lot of people gone this morning for for different reasons vacations etcase but uh also we ask that you you you will you will pray for brother brother Diego that God will will help him he's been he's been he's been uh been sick so we wanted us and also we want to we want to remember our great friend and and and uh been such a such a great great inspiration to us brother Fabio that was in the hospital for over a week foreign we we took this portion of scripture and a very uh Happy Father's Day to my papa is you know I I I I pray that this doesn't sound like to you because for us it's not okay he went on to be with the Lord and He in my opinion opinion is the the greatest the greatest man that I've ever met is greatest man to ever put on boots Money shoes and we as his sons and you that also are his spiritual sons and adopted Sons we all uh feel the same way so we we we're grateful that God gave him to us for the time that he did foreign the things that we have I always say there is nothing that I have that God did not give me yes I I I feel very very very strong about that my wife was given to me by the Lord my children were given to me my church family was given to me immigration everything that I possess materially I I say God give it to me he is the one that supplies all of our names and I'm very grateful to him for that is the air that we breathe you know many times we we we we forget to give God the thanks that we're alive but do you remember that that there is a and I I tell this to to everyone that I meet um the song says the world is bright since I got right and so so we sometimes might focus on on the negative around us I I challenge us I challenge myself to uh to to start looking at the positive of what God's given us you know uh and I thank God for everything that he's given me I got I got the best family in the world and I I attributed all of all those things to to to to to Sister Laura uh that has been such a great help throughout the years and uh we we here in a few weeks we will be celebrating our 39th wedding anniversary but a lot of that is thank you but but a lot of that is not attributed to me it's attributed to her uh she sometime is a glutton for punishment is because you you you're you quote unquote we don't live a normal life our life since we were born was never ours our life since we were born was born to serve the Lord and God's people and so we're grateful to to God or or what he's done for us now now the Book of Malachi is is the book and I won't take very much of your time this morning but I will take enough people that you could get what you need foreign and that's all right but but but uh we aren't just Malachi four five Believers we're Bible Believers we believe that the whole word of God is the inspired word of God it is inspired and it is infallible from cover to cover is can you put me the the the first the first uh and the the first slide there you go lucky now this if you see it is and I pray everybody I get everybody's complete undivided attention is is I want everybody to understand you know when when we as as Believers and I I always ask the question when I speak to couples I always ask the question who's the head of your house I also I also do believe that you do need a father in your home all right you don't know it you do need a father at home okay they're the the national statistics that's the statistics of fatherless children the Eagles are astounding is that's why I I want to thank and and those that that step up to the plate you cannot says that they have had have had to act as mother and father to those that have maybe taken in children that are not their children and have raised them as their own you should be applauded this morning we're grateful to those that love God's people but the statistics and the facts are the same a husband and a wife they can't get along and they separate guess who suffers the children now I always tell people this thing we as adults and especially us as men and as fathers have got to do a better job than maybe we might be doing but I want to applaud each and every father this morning that has not skirted their responsibility but has taken the responsibility of head of their house and has said the buck stops here it is because it's easy to say well Lord the wife that you gave me now or the serpenter or whatever it may be and all of that might be true but it's so important when you see a man stand up and he will say you know what Elizabeth here I am I take full responsibility responsibility that's what happens at my home Happy Father's Day amen thank you children born in fatherless homes are two times greater risk of infant mortality is two times more likely to drop out of schools so you think you just hurt yourself three times more likely to go to jail test message six and ten youth suicides yes are because of children born in fatherless homes seven in ten high school dropouts comes from fatherless homes having an involved father in the lives of our children has a profound impact on society children with present and positive relationship with their dads are half as likely to show signs of depression two times as like to go to college and find a stable job after school eighty percent less likely to spend time in jail this things that we as a society do yesterday that that that that the programs in our in our world systems in the United States they compensate a lady or a woman to have more children out of wedlock so they can get more funds dinero that makes the person or the father is not responsible okay responsibly but what a father it is that he loves his children that loves his wife I must disposal that loves his family to do as Christ did for us Christ is the head of the church [Music] are the different questions that that are different than Maybe some of the first questions you should ask a boy is this do you like girls foreign this is the world we live now the world outside says that you can do whatever you want if a man with a big old beard comes in one day and he says I'm going to use the woman's restroom because today I Feel Like a Woman right and they identify themselves as anything they want to come but as our our pastor says just because you stand in the garage does not make you a car just because we sit in a Pew does not make us a Christian Cristiano there are responsibilities with that title my responsibility anybody can make a child but there's only your father I can take that responsibility just say this is for me and my house that's responsibility and character it is there are over a hundred gender identification is you can marry yourself you can marry a rock you can do whatever you want to is you want to get a a a legislator or a person of politics ask him what is a man number what is a woman well if they have the XX chromosomes and the XY is what is it today that makes a man a man what is it that makes a woman a woman what makes a woman a church what makes a man a man yes because he puts on pants anybody can put on pants anybody can identify themselves as whatever they may be but who do who do we that claim malachiophore well our church don't teach that and you guys that are there while you follow a man I want you to notice that when God sent forth to us send forth a man he didn't send us another church he sent us a man take responsibility of that church responsibility of that family first take responsibility for the word that he would produce now God tells us this behold I send you us what has been given to me what has been given to us what has been given to you he gives us something in life is so a vast importance again any man can make a baby any person can make a baby a man can make a baby I gotta say this right any man can make a baby I think that any person can be get pregnant you know it's the most crazy that anybody can pregnant my goodness gracious oh why anything can happen anything goes do whatever we want to say yeah because it's a people's right but in between Philadelphia and laodice there's an open doors another church that has been called from that church yes we we look at ourselves and I I I find that that myself I lack you're in control and I looked to the messages that that of the economy your middle name that our pastor's been speaking on they call it and I say Lord help me help me if you don't help me I I I I don't know if if all this time that I that I preach your words that I I need to come to the understanding of the of I need to grow in your words well you see brother I have a lot of Revelations that might be soul but but the Bible speaks to us that Jesus grew okay Jesus if today I'm I'm the same as last year I have not grown but the Bible again says that Jesus Jesus grew in wisdom and in stature Jesus Christ even the prophet of God would say this God was evolving all the time he was learning more all the time then he made everything that was in everything that he is and it was good there came a time that he had learned the maximum that he was going to learn his own name is so that he could dwell inside what what does that show us that all that was in God he poured into Christ and everything that was in Christ he has poured into the Bible because so should we grow I say yes because a person that don't grow is dead you can't expect for that person to grow anymore but a person that's alive there's always something better around the corner there's a better relationship I want to be a better I wanna say foreign we look at our at ourselves and I look at the scripture and the scripture does not fail the scripture does not failure when it says this I must decrease he must increase you know sometimes I'm talking about myself sometimes there's too much Tommy Jr is there Michelle Tommy Jr yes my wife is sometimes there's too much and I saw myself 20 years ago and I see myself today that's too much of me yes I got fatter I got uglier I got older but when the scripture says I must decrease what does that mean what does that mean in our lives when we always says yo yo and we all have eyes and I'm just me me I I and I I I I yo yo yo yo yo but the scripture doesn't miss it brother Jacob I yo not talking about you doesn't say you no no it doesn't say us doesn't say them it says I we say yo doesn't speak about to anybody else he speaks about my person I don't speak about any other family because we all live in a glass house if you live in a glass house growing rocks I tell this to the couples there's three pointing right back at it you cannot you cannot get away from it is there things that should be better yes see but the first one that needs to be better and you can't get away from it I must decrease well I got a lot of Revelation brother you still got to decrease yeah you know why because you got that revelation and sometimes the revelations that we that I get obviously might not be the revelations of God again I got your thing goes when there was the last time that you read the Bible the pillar of fire came into the room what I was supposed to do [Music] this is this is the problem with me is too much Tommy Jr Tommy Jr there's too much of me Persona and and not enough of him I must decrease yo must decrease he must increase this is where where where where where where the eighth Messengers get get really twisted up okay there's been many stand up and say you know after brother Branham left they're the ones and they start saying this he must decrease I I must increase I must increase and then they take out the quote that says this is maybe this ministry is that I have tried to take people because they get this quote to promote them must be mistakes if all you see is Tommy Jr Tommy Jr then Tommy Jr has not has not done enough until the time so that you can see Christo foreign in my home in my church in me Iglesia in my life in my friendships when I think that I'm always right and everyone is wrong I must decrease not only my pork skins really make a lot of noise when I walk into my house and I think that I am the big big somebody and my wife oh I'm talking to you fathers father s Happy Father's Day that is [Applause] we had nothing but the best not even most much we had the best father we have the best father before God maybe he wasn't your father in the flesh but in the gospel you knew how to treat your wife you know how to take responsibility God had become number one in his life decreased to such an effect and God increased in his life I look at my papa's life I see a life that was it was that was so that was so where you saw nothing but God is and I looked at him I said I want to be here I look at our pastor Pastor I close my eyes and when I do because I hear my papa speaking again I want to be him where it was so so close to be that people thought that brother Branham was Jesus Christ and he would say I am not Jesus Christ I am not the son of man I am a Son of God your brothers that even John in the Book of Revelation all this Revelations he had been with Jesus that somebody confused you with Jesus Christ I look at brother Hector I see Jesus you will Jesus look at your brother tell me what you see dimelo can meet us I see Jesus you will Jesus I see Jesus and each and every one of you how can you see Jesus you can only see them if you decrease sister let him increase oh somebody got a shot nobody gotta say hallelujah responsibility when my wife tells me I look good I believe I think she's a little crazy Jay tells you look you look moved it is because if you don't believe her the mother girl that don't care about anything of your responsibility that you look good believe yourself like if you're Arnold Schwarzenegger for this Arnold Schwarzenegger and you're gonna believe it is somebody else told me I've been watching Jesus tell you guys love you there ain't nobody like you know who's dead when Jesus died on the cross Jesus Bible says they had him in between two thieves he had his arms spread like why did he do that foreign now I'm not much of a hugger yeah I'm not much people say people know me already oh no he's not a hugs and Shake Your Hands you ask my wife if I get good hugs you might not be a hugger through the world but ask Jesus If You Give Good Hugs um there ain't no God like my god there ain't nobody so but I chose this Father's Day yes since I was a little little little guy that I was going to follow Jesus and especially now since he sent me Elijah the prophet is Elijah the prophet in the Bible says was a man the Bible says he was he he he he was not confused of his identity right right brother Dave he said nothing confused he said that Elijah was a man similar passions there's some of you that are way out there but that's all right maybe you'll listen later but he shall turn the heart of the fathers children and the Heart of the children to their fathers in other words for you to know your father is that is why it's so difficult today foreign he shall turn the hearts of the children so I'll stay home without a father you already saw the statistics you go to church and you have no Pastor you already saw what a house does without a father yeah why am I talking to you already foreign we we we we we we we we we don't need them no more yeah wow why yeah my home we had a we we have a great Pub and me over we have a great pounding pasture we have a great Pastor don't tell me it don't matter who teaches you who raises don't tell me that because you've seen the statistics what happens yes we think that we are just a solitary unit solitary you know what happens when somebody Winks at you that's not your wife it doesn't mean I don't smile yes but that's for a different reasons when you come to the understanding I might finish with this is this is my papa it's just me Papa in the message thank you brother Ronnie man and ombre his position to position and responsibility irresponsibility subtitles armed and dangerous peligrosos you ever want some good quotes that's brother Ronnie brother brother Daniel ovals whoever else sends them to me I appreciate that you appreciation my papa says it says all things are passed away behold all things are become new he's a new species of being special he's a new race he's a new breed it is in general he's a super breed it is stupid you know why he's Jesus people El Jesus Jesus [Music] that's why I say this church here this church don't save you Tommy Jr was not crucified on the cross for you Jesus Christ was crucified we are bought we are purchased by God's own blood foreign all right and it isn't so much what we gave up brother Jacob I gotta let that one just just yes [Music] he says it is not so much what we gave up you know if I if I if I am a better person yeah you're going to be better till tomorrow until you get upset until somebody tells me you're not a Christian we're going to show them that you are not a Christian right Michael [Music] I thought you just got out of church he's a new racea that's why God raised up brother Jesus Jesus not because I prayed for him not because brother Abraham prayed for him and because he's a new race he's a Jesus people Jesus he's a new breeders super It Isn't So Much what we gave up but it's what we receive is located well we'll baptize them if they get right with God and and they stop smoking and drinking drugs we're gonna clean them before God cleans themes I know the church does a better job you know oh where a new breed it's not so much what we gave up but it's what we received it's what we take on Ruth in the Bible was in a land that was suffering with a famine Israel was suffering with a family that's how Naomi went into the land of Moses well when Ruth came back he didn't give up her poverty she only took on Bo as his riches [Applause] where's Abraham You Gotta Give me an amen right now give a mentor not to me to the word of God not to meet to the word of God Ruth was in poverty he didn't give up her poverty she only took on Boaz is riches and the poverty went away [Applause] we got it so backwards that if I read and I read and I read and I hear and I hear it the first thing that we got to do she didn't give up her poverty she only took on bow as his riches and the poverty went away yeah [Music] Gabe get get Felipe a high five just right right now in his hand okay she only took on companionship of Boaz you understand so then when we are in Christ it's not so much that we live leave this but it's what we take on is automatically makes all things pass away everything becomes new because you found out that there were other words in the English language because he lets you speak in tongues can you imagine that some people cuss so much that when they speak English for the first time they actually think that they're speaking in another town because it's a clean language when you speak about what God does for you it's a clean language it is another language and I don't have to say combination plates people talk what they don't even know they use curse words like if they're anything but when I became a new person in Christ Jesus Christ hmm wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait it's bad I think I think this will just be good now now maybe if I find it maybe I don't know I need to be a better better organized but if I became too organized and I wouldn't be yeah then if I'm not who I am going to be somebody else and then we have problems I might not know who I am okay but I but I I I can't find it you say it but it's it's it's some good stuff you know when we become new and I'm going to finish with this one in Christ Jesus and Christopher Jesus the Bible says old things all things Nuevo you know I don't know about you guys but I love my wife more today than the day I married her yeah and I'm gonna see this brother Rusty is she still as beautiful as the day you later oh my and and Enlighten us how how long have you been married wow yeah and she still makes your heart flutter wow [Music] trying to tell you that when you fall in love with Jesus you fall in love with him so much brother that's all you want to do when they say let's go to church I'm going to be there yeah yeah there are some that said you know are you having church tonight yeah it's Father's Day is Heavenly Father I appreciate it Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name if you want to go for Father's day but you don't know his brother is that because they're going to make me a big steak let me
