the darkness [Music] [Applause] Amen can we give him another hand get that beautiful wow just see the young children giving their talents to the Lord let us stand and as we call our brother out and I up I've seen the chorus once again give me that old-time religion I'm excited to hear what the Lord has to say to us through brother at a nightmare an old-time religion where it's good enough for me give me that old-time religion give me that I'm RELIGIOUS give me that old time it was good and the fiery furnace he was fiery furnace it was good [Music] [Music] how many are excited to be here today we're gonna talk about two rich young ruler z-- that's right brother branham brother branham mentions two rich young ruler z-- so let us read Matthew 19 23 through 24 when you have it you can say man then said Jesus unto his disciples fairly I say unto you that a rich man shall Holly entered the kingdom of heaven and again I say unto you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of the needle for then for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God you lured me please bow your heads Lord thing thank you for choosing me and not let me talk but let you talk guide your angels around this church - and what and Jesus name Amen you may be seated [Applause] so Jesus tells his disciples twice that it is hard for for rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven Jesus says this after his an encounter with the rich that was the rich young ruler so the rich young ruler is approaching Jesus and he asked and he asked him Jesus how do I obtain eternal life now this rich young ruler he had all the Xbox's and tablets iPads all that stuff sir and so Jesus tells him to sell all his things but the but the rich but this rich young ruler he liked he liked his TVs games and a bunch of other things too much to follow God but there was another rich young ruler anybody might know who that is raise your hand [Applause] Moses Moses Moses was taken in to be the son of Pharaoh's daughter right he lived in Pharaoh's Palace which was way bigger than this way bigger and he was going to be the next Pharaoh fair of all Egypt but it came to the point where he had a decision to make he he he would either follow God or stay here on earth Turner like the rich young ruler and like all of us to turn our Bibles to Hebrews 11 24 through 26 when you have it you can't a man by faith Moses when he when he come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people it's choosing rather to suffer affliction of the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the unto the recompense of the reward so we see Moses was willing to leave everything behind and follow God but the other young ruler wasn't willing to do so even though he had religious teaching and and he knew he lacked internal life he chose to let his riches lead him rather rather than Jesus eternal life is to choose Jesus and he missed it in life he he he was he was rich but in a rich man but in death he became the beggar as he sat and how he begged the beggar but since Moses chose God the Angels carried him up to heaven where he had internal life we all have a choice to make stay stay with with the world or follow God rich which rich young ruler are you going to be that's kind of short mm-hmm less you all [Applause] [Music] [Music] on [Music] any [Music] I can [Music] well let me tell you my name Billy I was in the heels first off and y'all seen

possible you know what happened that possum jump up she got our baby scooped her in the patch and I started marching down the little pathway and at that time Rebecca said daddy is that that old possum he said it sure is Jesus just healed [Music] so that that possum it gets to the end of the fence you think creation don't pay attention to you but all creation obeys God when that possums running down the pathway it stops turns back and looks at Billy as if it said thank you kind sir and it went out about its way what am i telling you I'm telling you that you might not think you have a lot because you're young children you might not think you got a lot to offer but put what you got in the hands of Jesus and see what he can do there was a little boy about your age about your guys age was he had was a little bit of fish a little bit of bread and it could only feed himself it was only enough to get him full but you know what he did he put that in the hands of Jesus and when it when it went in the hands of Jesus it fit 5,000 people you might not have a lock but put what you got in the hands of Jesus and see what he does what did I tell you he'll save souls through you I didn't think I could do a lot myself I didn't think I had much but he said me into a dark deep place because he had souls there does the Lord have needs one time Jesus was walking and he said I have lead up to pass by Samaria because one of my sheeps is there you might not have been born in the message but it took your husband it took your wife to go get you because he had need of you because he's in the soul-saving business and you know he needs you he needs you he needs you to say Souls so all that you got put it in the hands of Jesus watching multiply watch him magnify it I tell you want you standing your feet young people old people bagger heads Lord Jesus I pray for all these young people on if you keep them in your hands father and that you would guide them all the days of their life
