[35:21] welcome it's a privilege for me to be
[35:25] here amen amen and my uh I think my
[35:28] daughter is streaming in and then a dear
[35:31] sister I know uh up in South Carolina
[35:35] invited her to stream in tonight as
[35:42] well so this is my second time to ever
[35:44] preach in New
[35:48] [Music]
[35:50] Mexico I'm 73 years
[35:54] old the first time I was like maybe
[35:57] 25 something like
[36:02] that and this precious brother
[36:05] name Tommy
[36:07] Perez he invited me to New Mexico to
[36:10] Camp Thunderbird to
[36:15] preach so today I had lunch with two of
[36:19] his beloved
[36:23] sons that God has used to bless you
[36:28] he helped you a lot so we're honored and
[36:33] we're privileged to be with you tonight
[36:37] Wednesday night I know school work and
[36:39] everything tomorrow so we'll go right to
[36:42] the scriptures thank you for welcoming
[36:44] me we're glad to be here we've come to
[36:47] meet with the Lord Jesus
[36:51] Christ a scripture that's very familiar
[36:53] Matthew chapter 6 and or
[36:57] Matthew 5 I'm sorry Matthew
[37:01] [Music]
[37:04] 5 I write it down yes Matthew
[37:12] 5:16 let your light so shine before men
[37:16] that they may see your good works and
[37:19] glorify your father which is in
[37:25] heaven
[37:32] I'm going to set my
[37:38] timer and so I have another scripture to
[37:41] read but this is very familiar and Jesus
[37:45] he's commanding us to let our light
[37:49] shine but there's only one light of the
[37:53] world and that's the Lord Jesus Christ
[37:57] so if we're going to let our light
[38:00] shine we have to reflect
[38:04] him to make this written word live
[38:07] before the
[38:11] people and so my question tonight
[38:15] is if we let our light
[38:18] shine what impact will it
[38:22] have what is the
[38:25] outcome of this life
[38:28] and Paul tells us in 2 Corinthians 5 and
[38:34] 16
[38:44] say 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 16 he
[38:49] describes the
[38:52] impact of the
[38:54] light shining
[38:58] through
[38:59] you so he says in verse 16 wherefore
[39:03] henceforth know we no man after the
[39:05] flesh ye though we have known Christ
[39:07] after the flesh yet now henceforth we
[39:12] know him no
[39:20] more we knew him by the
[39:24] blood now we know him by the Holy
[39:28] Spirit according to the truth therefore
[39:32] If any man be in Christ he is a new
[39:34] creature old old things are passed away
[39:37] behold all things are become
[39:44] new that's right and all things are of
[39:47] God who has reconciled us to himself by
[39:51] Jesus Christ and has given to us the
[39:55] ministry of re
[40:06] he's given us the ministry of
[40:10] reconciliation to
[40:13] wit that means to
[40:17] witness to witness that God was in
[40:20] Christ reconciling the world to himself
[40:22] not imputing their transpress trans PR
[40:27] trespasses unto them and has committed
[40:29] unto us the word of
[40:41] reconciliation then Paul says now
[40:44] then we are ambassadors for
[40:48] Christ as though God did beseech You by
[40:53] us be ye reconciled
[41:04] to By Us in Christ's
[41:09] deed we become his light of
[41:15] reconciliation that's the
[41:17] impact of letting your light
[41:21] shine it becomes a
[41:24] witness that you've been reconciled to
[41:28] Christ by his
[41:31] cross and now it's time to shine your
[41:35] light by your
[41:39] cross Paul gives us a great example of
[41:43] what he means by
[41:47] reconciliation in the third chapter of
[41:49] second Corinthians this is
[41:52] profound I never saw this until about
[41:56] the third time I had preached this
[41:57] message and then I saw this scripture
[42:00] and let's just read it to you and then
[42:02] you
[42:03] can you can savor it in your
[42:09] soul second uh Second Corinthians second
[42:12] chapter verse 10 here's the example of
[42:18] reconciliation to whom ye forgive
[42:23] anything to whom you forgive
[42:28] something huh to whom you forgive
[42:35] anything the messenger said I forgive it
[42:42] also and then he goes on to
[42:45] say for if I forgave
[42:49] anything to whom I forgave
[42:53] it for your sakes I forgave
[42:59] it in the
[43:04] person yeah
[43:10] W I was in leth and the pastor the next
[43:13] day said Why'd You Come here and before
[43:15] I get answer he said to work right I
[43:17] said yes they cut the
[43:23] emotion I love the Lord
[43:26] and I love his
[43:28] people to
[43:31] whom you forgave
[43:34] anything the messenger to the age stood
[43:38] in the Gap in the person of Christ and
[43:40] said I forgive it
[43:45] all is there something you want forgiven
[43:51] tonight is there something you'd like
[43:53] forgiven
[43:55] tonight you know in your heart what it
[43:57] is then take it before the
[44:01] Lord but if there's something you want
[44:06] forgiven is there somebody you also can
[44:12] forgive let us
[44:14] pray Heavenly
[44:18] Father we thank
[44:20] you for the grace of
[44:23] God to forgive us of our sins
[44:26] and our
[44:28] trespasses we might stand before
[44:31] you very
[44:33] soon without a
[44:35] spot without a
[44:38] blemish Snow
[44:41] White
[44:43] Lord I have no
[44:46] grudges I may have been
[44:49] hurt I may have
[44:52] suffered but Lord I hold no
[44:54] grudges
[44:56] and I forgive
[44:58] all thank you Lord for forgiving
[45:02] me in Jesus
[45:15] name so we're speaking on the light of
[45:21] reconciliation and it's to
[45:24] witness that God was in
[45:27] Christ reconciling
[45:30] me a
[45:32] hippie that's what I was reconcile me a
[45:35] hippie to the
[45:38] light and now that he's in
[45:42] me he's given me the ministry of
[45:48] reconciliation that I can Shine the
[45:51] Light That Power of the
[45:54] cross to bring reconciliation for those
[45:58] who need
[46:02] it reconciliation means to remove the
[46:09] barrier remove the barrier between two
[46:12] or more
[46:15] persons something caused a
[46:19] separation an
[46:22] attitude a
[46:24] word or a
[46:27] it caused a
[46:30] separation you say well I wasn't wor I
[46:33] didn't do anything for
[46:37] that what did he what did you do that he
[46:40] had to go to the cross for
[46:44] you so it's something that causes a
[46:49] separation it's a
[46:52] barrier that breaks the
[46:54] relationship
[46:56] between God and
[46:58] man and man and
[47:04] man
[47:06] right we know in the old
[47:10] Temple under the old Ministry of the
[47:14] law there was a
[47:17] veil and Paul called it the middle wall
[47:20] of
[47:24] partition
[47:26] it was a
[47:27] barrier it
[47:30] separated the
[47:32] Jews from the light of eternal
[47:37] life and it not only separated the Jews
[47:40] from the light of eternal
[47:45] life but it separated the Gentiles and
[47:48] the Jews from
[47:53] fellowship and the Jews in their
[47:57] eyes they were
[47:59] righteous yes sir they had the law they
[48:02] had
[48:03] circumcision they had the
[48:06] religion they had a shadow of good
[48:08] things to
[48:10] come and when he came they couldn't
[48:13] recognize
[48:15] him
[48:19] am he was in the
[48:22] temple that could make reconciliation
[48:26] between God and
[48:29] man and so because they were blinding
[48:34] him Paul came to this
[48:37] conclusion we've all
[48:39] sinned we've all
[48:41] sin and we've all come
[48:44] short of the light of his sh
[48:47] [Applause]
[48:49] Glory
[48:52] right so let him without sin tonight as
[48:57] the first
[49:04] stone and we know why we were separated
[49:09] from
[49:09] God this message tells us the original
[49:14] sin like no other messenger told us this
[49:18] message tells
[49:21] us it was the life of blood
[49:26] it was Satan's
[49:29] life through the blood that comes from
[49:32] the sexual
[49:36] seed by the LIE he told
[49:40] Eve he opened the
[49:42] door to enter into the human
[49:47] race and that became the old
[49:52] creation and that seed brought forth
[49:55] with what you see today Satan's
[50:01] eeden and so it was the life of the
[50:06] blood that broke our relationship with
[50:08] our
[50:10] father so it had to be the life of his
[50:14] own
[50:16] blood amen the life of his
[50:20] own the blood of the Lord Jesus
[50:24] Christ that could make
[50:28] reconciliation that could rent The
[50:31] Veil tear down the middle wall
[50:34] partition veil of Darkness over my
[50:39] heart to let that light shine
[50:45] in and I'm so thankful tonight to
[50:48] say I'm a Child of
[50:53] Light and I'm on my way
[50:57] to a child of the
[51:00] day but that's another
[51:03] message but Paul made the
[51:08] distinction because when the daylight
[51:11] shines there's no more
[51:13] Shadows there's no more anything from
[51:17] the old
[51:19] creation we're shining in the light of
[51:22] his
[51:24] glory body like his own glorious
[51:28] body the complete
[51:32] reconciliation from the old
[51:34] creation to the new
[51:37] creation by that glorious Royal seed of
[51:44] ab
[51:47] amen so
[51:50] Jesus he said if I the son of man be
[51:54] lifted up
[51:58] then you'll know that I am
[52:02] he and the
[52:04] Greek doesn't say you'll know that I am
[52:09] he the Greek says you'll know that I
[52:14] am and I am that
[52:17] light burning
[52:20] bush down and anointed
[52:24] Moses you'll know that I
[52:29] am and
[52:31] someday and it's this day there is a
[52:36] people that know that I
[52:39] am it's going to fulfill the
[52:42] scripture that Jesus
[52:44] said where I
[52:47] am you're going to be
[52:54] Al
[52:58] so the
[53:00] cross is the light of
[53:04] reconciliation you know for years I
[53:06] looked at the the
[53:08] classic uh license plate of New
[53:14] Mexico the one with the
[53:17] sun side and race and I was mystified by
[53:22] it because I know there was Native
[53:25] Indians originally in in in New
[53:30] Mexico and I thought that that was a
[53:32] symbol of something of the the heritage
[53:35] of the
[53:38] natives but today my eyes were
[53:42] open that symbol is the cross it's the
[53:47] light of the Cross is the light of the
[53:50] Son of God shining in New Mexico the
[53:54] light of
[54:01] [Music]
[54:07] reconciliation now before we go any
[54:11] further I want to place
[54:15] this every child that is born of the
[54:20] light every member that's a member of
[54:23] the body of light
[54:28] they have a
[54:30] part in the ministry of
[54:36] reconciliation every Child of
[54:39] Light every member of the body of
[54:44] light you have a
[54:46] part in the ministry of
[54:51] reconciliation you are called by
[54:54] Jesus to shine your
[54:57] light so that they can see the power of
[55:01] the
[55:04] Cross shining to
[55:16] them and brother brandom said it like
[55:20] this the the samna church
[55:24] age
[55:26] and every person in the church has an
[55:28] individual
[55:32] Ministry and that individual Ministry
[55:34] goes together with the rest of the
[55:40] ministry to edify the body of Jesus
[55:46] Christ amen amen that's right whether
[55:50] you're a young person middle AG or a
[55:53] senior like me yes
[55:55] if you are born of the light you are
[55:58] called to the ministry of
[56:04] reconciliation now we know that we all
[56:06] don't have the same position in the body
[56:09] of
[56:13] Christ it's brother Caleb's call his
[56:16] position is the pastor and so he's
[56:19] shining the light in a way that you or I
[56:22] may not be called to shine
[56:30] but there's not two or three different
[56:33] lengths there's one light there's one
[56:36] Lord Jesus Christ there's one Holy
[56:40] Ghost and by his
[56:42] blood we are all walking in the
[56:53] light
[56:57] and
[56:58] so I'm I'm coming to
[57:03] this by his
[57:06] cross we become the
[57:09] light can you say
[57:12] Amen by your
[57:14] cross you shine the
[57:18] light that's where we're coming
[57:21] to by his
[57:23] cross
[57:25] we Shine the Light we become the
[57:29] light and by his
[57:32] cross we Shine the Light I shine the
[57:37] light now
[57:39] watch Jesus said when the son of man is
[57:43] lifted
[57:45] up crucified on the
[57:48] cross you'll know that I
[57:53] am now let me just drop this
[57:57] in the son of man is this picture right
[58:03] here okay now why did he have to say the
[58:07] son of
[58:09] man because the pillar of fire could not
[58:13] die the pillar of fire could not
[58:16] [Applause]
[58:19] bleed but when the word became
[58:23] flesh as these son of
[58:25] man then there was a blood
[58:29] produced and
[58:31] MDC The Living
[58:34] Word he became the bleeding word for you
[58:38] and for
[58:41] me you've heard the term the bleeding
[58:45] word Saul said Lord Lord who are
[58:50] you I'm
[58:52] Jesus hallelujah hallelujah
[58:55] Jesus Hallelujah
[58:57] Jehovah became Jehovah
[59:00] Gyra and Paul's eyes became
[59:04] open and the veil of the law fell
[59:09] off and he began to
[59:12] shine the New
[59:14] Testament the grace of
[59:19] God to see how we are made
[59:22] righteous by faith
[59:25] in this
[59:27] light
[59:31] amen so he
[59:34] says when I'm lifted up you'll know that
[59:37] I
[59:39] am and The Great I
[59:41] Am is the light that appeared in the
[59:44] burning
[59:46] bush and it anointed
[59:49] Moses to be the light of
[59:53] reconciliation
[59:56] he was the light of reconciliation to
[59:58] Israel in
[1:00:01] Egypt to remove the
[1:00:04] barrier
[1:00:06] Pharaoh between them and the promised
[1:00:11] land and when that light of
[1:00:12] reconciliation begin to
[1:00:16] shine it begin to shine in the power of
[1:00:19] The Great I
[1:00:22] Am it takes power
[1:00:25] the power of the blood the power of the
[1:00:28] Holy
[1:00:29] Ghost to bring a deliverance and remove
[1:00:33] the barriers in your
[1:00:36] life word only will not do
[1:00:44] it right so Pharaoh saw the
[1:00:49] plagues and Israel saw the
[1:00:53] token they saw the Lamb's Blood on the
[1:00:58] door and that was their light of
[1:01:02] reconciliation where they could pass
[1:01:04] from Death to
[1:01:08] life and we know that was in animals
[1:01:13] blood and that blood was
[1:01:18] foreshadowing that The Great I
[1:01:21] Am was going to come down on the Jordan
[1:01:24] River
[1:01:25] R amen and incarnate himself in Jesus
[1:01:32] Christ as the son of
[1:01:34] man to anoint
[1:01:37] him as the light of
[1:01:41] reconciliation amen
[1:01:44] amen now it's moving from the shadow of
[1:01:48] good things to come into the
[1:01:53] positive
[1:01:55] and whereas Paul had them put Blood on
[1:01:57] the
[1:02:00] door when this lamb shed his
[1:02:04] blood the veil to our heart was
[1:02:07] rent and the door to the light of the
[1:02:10] Holy
[1:02:12] Ghost was
[1:02:14] open and we pass from the condemnation
[1:02:18] of the
[1:02:20] law into the light of eternal life
[1:02:26] whereby we are
[1:02:29] judged in the sight of
[1:02:32] God
[1:02:34] why because I came through my father's
[1:02:39] Blood by his
[1:02:43] seed
[1:02:45] yes his
[1:02:47] SE
[1:02:49] royaly new
[1:02:51] creation and
[1:02:53] henceforth
[1:02:55] I not only know him by the
[1:02:58] blood but I know him as The Great I
[1:03:03] Am and just give me a little bit of
[1:03:07] time for God's
[1:03:10] plan and
[1:03:13] someday I
[1:03:14] also will be able to
[1:03:17] manifest I am that I
[1:03:21] am what what is it it's an amateur God
[1:03:25] Moses went down there as an amateur
[1:03:31] God
[1:03:43] right so now here's where we go a little
[1:03:50] deeper I was preaching in Malawi
[1:03:52] recently in December
[1:03:56] and the pastor's son who's a
[1:03:59] minister he was saying brother we're
[1:04:01] talking you know you're going
[1:04:05] deep and I reminded him that brother
[1:04:08] Branham
[1:04:09] said in in the
[1:04:11] 50s the real deep spiritual
[1:04:18] Revelation the church is still blind
[1:04:21] to the church is still blind to
[1:04:27] he said that in the 50s you can find it
[1:04:29] on
[1:04:31] tape and then he proceeded to say but
[1:04:34] God has
[1:04:35] placed the gifts of the minister into
[1:04:38] the church like a teacher in that in
[1:04:40] order to teach
[1:04:46] you these
[1:04:48] things and
[1:04:51] so what age are we living in
[1:04:56] what message are we
[1:04:58] preaching Ezekiel Saw the
[1:05:02] water and it was up to the
[1:05:06] ankles and then he saw some to the
[1:05:09] knees and then he saw some to the
[1:05:12] waste and then he saw a
[1:05:14] river that only the rainbow trout can
[1:05:18] swim
[1:05:22] in why would you you want just that much
[1:05:25] of the Holy Ghost when this is the age
[1:05:28] when the fullness is being poured
[1:05:31] out upon the rainbow
[1:05:39] trout pcatt fish PC
[1:05:44] okay don't get excited I'm only in
[1:05:47] kindergarten no
[1:05:50] no the rainbow
[1:05:53] trout they're the ones that can swim in
[1:05:55] the deep
[1:06:00] water so we're only bringing
[1:06:04] out the light of the
[1:06:07] age and we
[1:06:09] realize and your pastor knows
[1:06:12] this he has some that's to the ankles
[1:06:15] some to the knees some to the waist and
[1:06:17] that's why we have to be patient with
[1:06:20] one another like God is patient with me
[1:06:25] is God patient with you then can you be
[1:06:28] patient with one
[1:06:33] another
[1:06:37] right and so what is this
[1:06:40] light that's in
[1:06:43] us he talked about this light very
[1:06:48] specifically and he said this in
[1:06:50] Revelations chapter 4 number
[1:06:53] two
[1:06:58] that great Jewel what was
[1:07:01] it it was
[1:07:03] perfect it was at the age of 33 and A2
[1:07:06] years old when God put it through the
[1:07:08] big bumping
[1:07:14] machine when he took it over there and
[1:07:16] he began to shape it
[1:07:20] up he cut it he mashed it
[1:07:25] he bruised it he was wounded for our
[1:07:30] transgression he was bruised for our
[1:07:33] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[1:07:35] was upon
[1:07:37] him and with his stripes we were
[1:07:40] healed what did God do to that perfect
[1:07:45] man there's only one of them in the
[1:07:51] world did you hear that there's only one
[1:07:54] of them in the
[1:07:56] world only one in the
[1:07:59] world and that was
[1:08:02] him let me
[1:08:05] pause there is only one
[1:08:09] man that ever was born of a
[1:08:13] woman that will ever be born of a
[1:08:17] woman that was
[1:08:19] perfect picture was right up
[1:08:22] there man's head of
[1:08:25] Christ this is
[1:08:28] important he's the only man that was
[1:08:31] born
[1:08:34] perfect sir he was that new
[1:08:39] creation and what did God do to that
[1:08:41] perfect
[1:08:44] man God chiseled him
[1:08:47] off he was wounded for our
[1:08:51] transgression because I was a
[1:08:55] sinner he let the rainbow light of his
[1:08:59] seven Church ages flash upon
[1:09:06] me because I was a
[1:09:09] sinner he let the rainbow light of his
[1:09:13] seven Church ages flash upon
[1:09:19] me this is not a
[1:09:21] symbol this is not a
[1:09:24] metaphor this is the light that Jesus
[1:09:28] said he wants us to
[1:09:33] shine because I was a
[1:09:36] sinner he let the rainbow
[1:09:40] light of his seven Church ages flashes
[1:09:43] upon
[1:09:45] me to
[1:09:47] know that he was
[1:09:50] wounded for my
[1:09:52] transgression
[1:09:54] my
[1:09:55] transgression this hippie this long
[1:09:58] haired
[1:10:00] hippie sin didn't have a chance the
[1:10:04] devil's life was in me and it was
[1:10:06] controlling me but God
[1:10:10] fora I would love
[1:10:14] [Applause]
[1:10:17] him amen somebody touch me must have
[1:10:23] been that
[1:10:24] Angel of the
[1:10:29] Lord now now I'm I'm getting
[1:10:34] lost where am I at
[1:10:36] Lord okay all
[1:10:40] right so you
[1:10:42] see it's a let your light
[1:10:46] shine you have to become the
[1:10:49] light in that perfect man
[1:10:54] he was born
[1:10:56] perfect to live a perfect
[1:10:59] life to become a perfect
[1:11:03] sacrifice so he could shine that rainbow
[1:11:06] light upon my
[1:11:10] soul so by his
[1:11:14] cross I became the rainbow
[1:11:18] light and now by my
[1:11:20] cross you're going to see the rainbow
[1:11:23] light
[1:11:30] the first
[1:11:31] Exodus Moses was the light of
[1:11:33] reconciliation amen or
[1:11:35] amen second but that was the blood of a
[1:11:38] natural
[1:11:39] lamb second
[1:11:41] Exodus the light came down into a man
[1:11:44] born
[1:11:47] perfect sh by God's
[1:11:50] blood to rip the veil and open the door
[1:11:53] to your
[1:11:55] heart to let the Life of Christ come
[1:12:01] in but now we're in the third
[1:12:09] exod no matter how many denominational
[1:12:14] barriers through the seven Church
[1:12:18] ages and Satan put up a lot did he
[1:12:22] not he put them up and had us Bound in a
[1:12:25] way that we didn't even
[1:12:30] know but no matter how many
[1:12:32] denominational
[1:12:35] barriers no matter how many
[1:12:38] Traditions has
[1:12:41] separated
[1:12:43] man from God's
[1:12:46] promise and one
[1:12:49] another all those Oneness in the
[1:12:52] trinity they couldn't
[1:12:55] Fellowship why because the leaders
[1:12:57] wouldn't let them
[1:13:04] Fellowship it's the same
[1:13:07] today because Satan is still here still
[1:13:11] the prince of the power of the
[1:13:13] a but Jesus is here also and he wants to
[1:13:17] prove greater is he that is in me than
[1:13:21] he that is in
[1:13:22] them the light of
[1:13:25] reconciliation I don't don't care what
[1:13:27] you believe you're my brother you're my
[1:13:29] S sister and if you're wrong Let Me
[1:13:33] Shine the Light of
[1:13:47] reconciliation I could tell you a story
[1:13:49] of
[1:13:52] my of a young man that's 16 year old
[1:13:55] back
[1:13:57] there say this he fellowships with the
[1:14:00] brandom
[1:14:01] Tabernacle he fellowships with the
[1:14:03] brandom
[1:14:06] Tabernacle the Youth of his age and he
[1:14:09] also fellowships at the church of the
[1:14:11] open door those
[1:14:15] youth and someone says to
[1:14:19] him why are you going over
[1:14:22] there
[1:14:24] he says have you been
[1:14:26] there he says no he says have you heard
[1:14:30] the pastor
[1:14:32] preach he said no he said then be quiet
[1:14:37] you don't know what you're talking
[1:14:38] about I thought that was a good
[1:14:43] answer that's a denominational
[1:14:47] spirit that wants to divide and wants to
[1:14:52] separate Jews amen because of what I
[1:14:55] believe and where I go to Worship in the
[1:14:58] temple I'm better than
[1:15:01] you there's only one mark that
[1:15:04] distinguishes what you are and what your
[1:15:07] claims are and it's the new birth and it
[1:15:10] doesn't come where you Fellowship it
[1:15:12] comes by the cross and the Holy Ghost
[1:15:15] and I got it in my room at
[1:15:22] home
[1:15:26] the only way you'll
[1:15:27] stand in this evil age against all the
[1:15:31] powers that are moving in against us by
[1:15:34] being born again by the light of
[1:15:40] reconciliation
[1:15:42] otherwise reasoning with the message
[1:15:45] will not cut
[1:15:48] it that's why they start and go oh look
[1:15:51] at this well where did Brother BR do
[1:15:52] this
[1:15:56] question to
[1:15:57] me settled I've been calary I've died to
[1:16:02] myself Holy Ghost
[1:16:05] came I know in whom I
[1:16:12] believe right and I won't be
[1:16:16] judged by where I
[1:16:18] Fellowship I'll be
[1:16:20] judged whether I'm walking in the light
[1:16:23] or
[1:16:24] not if you're walking in the light as he
[1:16:27] is in the
[1:16:29] light that rainbow

[1:17:00] Spirits God had a promise that it shall
[1:17:03] be
[1:17:05] light in the evening
[1:17:08] time and the evening light
[1:17:12] promised the sun was going to come out
[1:17:15] in the evening
[1:17:18] time no matter how many denominational
[1:17:22] barriers

[1:17:26] light he said it's reflecting the
[1:17:30] cross it's on tape souls in
[1:17:34] prison time this
[1:17:38] light is reflecting the
[1:17:41] cross through who the messenger of the
[1:17:46] age I in Christ forgive
[1:17:51] you it's reflecting through the
[1:17:53] messenger of the
[1:17:56] age to bring
[1:18:00] reconciliation to break down the
[1:18:01] denominational
[1:18:04] barriers by breaking open the Seven
[1:18:09] Seals and letting the total light of
[1:18:13] reconciliation shine into our
[1:18:18] heart so that we can see
[1:18:21] what the token
[1:18:24] not not a lamb's not an animal
[1:18:27] blood not the earnest of the
[1:18:30] spirit but the

[1:24:30] relationship or separating
[1:24:33] Fellowship the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:24:36] reconciles it
[1:24:42] all I talked to a sister one time and
[1:24:45] about the situation she was in with her
[1:24:49] husband trying to bring reconciliation
[1:24:54] and she said but brother L there's a
[1:24:57] there's a heap of of stuff
[1:25:01] there I said what about your HEAP of
[1:25:04] stuff that he
[1:25:11] forgave reconciliation is a
[1:25:14] process there's seven
[1:25:17] steps it took seven steps to bring a man
[1:25:20] back into the pillar of Fire
[1:25:25] but if you'll listen to your pastor he
[1:25:26] will help
[1:25:28] you he will help you make those
[1:25:32] steps but you can't be listening to this
[1:25:34] one and this one and that one and that
[1:25:38] one they'll become
[1:25:45] barriers yeah I'm off my
[1:25:48] ground I'm on the pastor's
[1:25:51] ground
[1:25:54] all right I'm at 48
[1:25:58] minutes repent and sin no
[1:26:06] more a lot of some people
[1:26:09] understands all
[1:26:11] right by his
[1:26:14] cross I became the rainbow
[1:26:18] light now by my
[1:26:20] cross I Shine the rainbow
[1:26:24] light now young people
[1:26:28] listen by his
[1:26:30] cross you die only
[1:26:34] once to
[1:26:36] sin one time for all
[1:26:40] time you die to
[1:26:43] sin but by my
[1:26:46] cross I Die
[1:26:49] daily okay now understand this because
[1:26:52] Satan will use your ignorance of the
[1:26:54] scriptures against
[1:26:58] you I die once to
[1:27:02] sin and the light of God shines
[1:27:06] in the rainbow
[1:27:10] light but where I have to Die
[1:27:13] daily is in my
[1:27:16] spirit in my
[1:27:18] mind in my spirit in my mind the battle
[1:27:23] comes between light and
[1:27:26] darkness because you're in the world of
[1:27:29] Darkness but I'm not of the
[1:27:34] darkness and my
[1:27:36] flesh it's still a cocko burl and your
[1:27:40] flesh is still a cocko burel and your
[1:27:43] flesh will get you in trouble make you
[1:27:46] have to
[1:27:48] apologize I didn't mean to say that
[1:27:50] brother k I didn't mean to say that
[1:27:54] brother Tommy I didn't mean
[1:27:57] it you can hear on tape brother B says I
[1:27:59] misspoke I said that in the flesh I
[1:28:01] didn't mean that because he saw the way
[1:28:04] it was being
[1:28:08] taken so the inside is
[1:28:12] light and that light illuminates your
[1:28:15] spirit your mind your spirit is the wick
[1:28:20] that has to be trimmed and cleared every
[1:28:31] day so when I die daily it's not my soul
[1:28:34] that's
[1:28:37] dying it's in my
[1:28:39] spirit I'm fighting this
[1:28:42] battle and that rainbow
[1:28:45] light as it looks into the
[1:28:48] word and hears the message of the hour
[1:28:52] and I pray and I
[1:28:55] groan and I
[1:28:58] travail and sometimes I have to
[1:29:01] fast Lord I'm
[1:29:04] serious
[1:29:06] desate I'm fighting this
[1:29:09] battle and I want the light to
[1:29:13] shine in this
[1:29:16] mind
[1:29:20] amen and so you'll die
[1:29:24] daily so if you're born of the
[1:29:27] light don't let him tell you
[1:29:31] different because he hit you with the
[1:29:34] darkness in the
[1:29:37] mind you can't go anywhere without
[1:29:40] seeing the
[1:29:42] darkness you you can't check the news
[1:29:44] without hearing the
[1:29:47] darkness
[1:29:50] yes and we know it's chaos
[1:29:52] it's
[1:29:53] confusion it's
[1:29:56] disillusion Satan has them in
[1:29:59] fear but we're not being Anointed with
[1:30:02] fear we're we're being Anointed with the
[1:30:05] Victorious
[1:30:07] light
[1:30:10] reconciliation so that I can cast
[1:30:13] down the
[1:30:16] lies he's telling me he's telling me
[1:30:20] lies the only he wants to talk to me
[1:30:23] about was my hippie
[1:30:25] days he wants to talk to me about the
[1:30:27] old
[1:30:29] book he wants to bring it to
[1:30:32] memory he wants to bring the scars and
[1:30:35] the
[1:30:36] pain but the truth is the old book is
[1:30:42] gone amen it was cast into the sea of
[1:30:46] God's
[1:30:49] forgetfulness and God does not see
[1:30:52] me as the old
[1:30:55] creation he does not
[1:30:58] see as the old
[1:31:01] creation he sees me white as snow in my
[1:31:07] theophany how he sees
[1:31:10] me and when that light comes into
[1:31:15] you that's what he wants you to
[1:31:19] see keep your eyes on
[1:31:27] that so yes we die
[1:31:30] daily and that's why your prayer life is
[1:31:33] so
[1:31:34] important your quiet time is so
[1:31:37] important reading your Bible is so
[1:31:40] important hearing the message God will
[1:31:42] direct you to hear just what you need to
[1:31:46] hear but
[1:31:48] then
[1:31:50] Hezekiah and Isaiah
[1:31:52] Satan threatened them Satan threatened
[1:31:56] them I'm going to do this to you and I'm
[1:31:59] going to do this to you I did this to
[1:32:02] them I did this to
[1:32:04] them and Hezekiah and
[1:32:07] Isaiah they went to
[1:32:09] prayer they went to prayer and they did
[1:32:13] something else they cried to the
[1:32:17] Lord they cried to the Lord I'm not
[1:32:20] saying you have to have Bo boohoo maybe
[1:32:22] you a boohoo there gring and prevailing
[1:32:27] Lord Do You Hear What that devil said
[1:32:29] here's what your word

[1:32:45] minutes but I can ask for
[1:32:48] Grace I just thought of that
[1:32:52] but I will
[1:32:54] ask let me look when I die
[1:32:58] daily so the light of reconciliation can
[1:33:02] shine what is it that actually
[1:33:06] shines what is it that actually brings
[1:33:09] down the
[1:33:11] barrier of those
[1:33:13] attitudes those words those
[1:33:17] deeds it's this it's his faith his
[1:33:22] virtue his
[1:33:24] knowledge
[1:33:26] Temperance his patience his
[1:33:30] godliness and his brotherly
[1:33:34] kindness that's the light of
[1:33:39] reconcil how many times have you saw a
[1:33:44] situation mom and
[1:33:45] dad you knew a situation in the
[1:33:49] family there's barriers
[1:33:53] and it breaks your
[1:33:54] heart it breaks your heart right and so
[1:33:58] you're praying and you're crying and
[1:34:01] you're
[1:34:02] agonizing yeah Lord I want
[1:34:06] deliverance and one
[1:34:08] day the
[1:34:10] knowledge the knowledge of the Holy
[1:34:13] Ghost he quickens to
[1:34:15] you this is the root cause of the
[1:34:20] situation
[1:34:22] and she gets up and she says
[1:34:25] honey honey the Lord revealed it to
[1:34:29] me I know the
[1:34:32] answer and the husband
[1:34:36] says he
[1:34:37] still be
[1:34:40] quiet
[1:34:42] Temperance Temperance you may have the
[1:34:45] answer the lord gave you the
[1:34:48] answer but it's not time to say
[1:34:52] something it's not the right place to
[1:34:54] say
[1:34:56] something so you have to have
[1:34:59] Temperance with your
[1:35:01] knowledge well when when are we going to
[1:35:05] say something this is tearing me
[1:35:09] apart
[1:35:10] patience
[1:35:12] patience wait on
[1:35:14] God wait on his
[1:35:16] time that demon was was was persecuting
[1:35:20] and Paul and saying these men are men of
[1:35:22] God and Paul didn't say
[1:35:29] nothing one
[1:35:31] day when you're not even
[1:35:34] conscious you're going to find yourself
[1:35:36] in the
[1:35:37] situation and the Lord's going to say
[1:35:39] this is the time this is the
[1:35:42] place now
[1:35:44] humbly
[1:35:50] Softly
[1:35:52] whatever you know I just been thinking
[1:35:54] of this and just drop it
[1:35:58] in that's the light of
[1:36:03] reconciliation that's what I'm talking
[1:36:12] about so your
[1:36:16] cross is there causing you
[1:36:19] pain they causing you a financial
[1:36:23] loss
[1:36:25] right they they did you wrong you did
[1:36:27] them right they did you
[1:36:30] wrong and and all kinds of things right
[1:36:34] it creates barriers to Fellowship
[1:36:36] barriers to
[1:36:40] relationship and it's
[1:36:42] painful but in order for you to shine
[1:36:46] the light of reconciliation the power of
[1:36:49] the blood of Jesus Christ the power of
[1:36:51] the Holy Ghost is to express these Seven
[1:36:59] Virtues amen that's
[1:37:03] right there 59 minutes I don't have to
[1:37:06] ask Grace
[1:37:08] yet but let's come to the close thank
[1:37:12] you brother Caleb I I enjoyed myself
[1:37:15] being
[1:37:17] here God bless you
[1:37:19] richly we're going to two son
[1:37:22] for Sunday service pray for
[1:37:24] me I understand the Pastor's going to
[1:37:28] Poland tring Grace and God's
[1:37:33] mercy let's close with
[1:37:36] this so five minutes past one hour is
[1:37:39] Grace okay all right here we
[1:37:41] go what motivates a born again Christian
[1:37:45] to endure hardness as a good soldier of
[1:37:48] the
[1:37:50] cross
[1:37:55] what motivates you to do
[1:37:57] that the reason
[1:38:00] is you are
[1:38:02] [Applause]
[1:38:03] anointed for a kingly
[1:38:07] position now listen Okay the reason is I
[1:38:11] am anointed for a kingly
[1:38:16] position I have a promise in Revelations
[1:38:20] 3:21
[1:38:23] to him that overcometh will sit in my
[1:38:28] Throne amen amen I will sit in his
[1:38:31] throne as he sat in his father's
[1:38:36] throne and where did he
[1:38:38] sit inside the pillar of
[1:38:42] fire we have a
[1:38:44] promise the light has struck my
[1:38:48] heart now I'm walking in faith
[1:38:52] in virtue in knowledge in Temperance in
[1:38:56] patience in godliness in brotherly
[1:38:59] kindness and I want to be caught up like
[1:39:02] sunset Mountain and enter into that
[1:39:06] Glory cloud and to be placed in a kingly
[1:39:11] position where the Prophet
[1:39:15] said Lord what does this
[1:39:18] mean and something struck his hand
[1:39:23] the king's
[1:39:27] sword Revelations 3:21 being Vindicated
[1:39:31] before our very
[1:39:34] eyes because God will do
[1:39:38] nothing until he first shows it by that
[1:39:41] man
[1:39:43] there so you're anointed for a kingly
[1:39:48] position and and so that's why why we
[1:39:52] suffer and God foreshadowed it by
[1:39:56] David David was the Good
[1:39:59] Shepherd and he put his life on the
[1:40:02] line for his sheep his father's
[1:40:06] sheep and God had Samuel the
[1:40:10] prophet anoint
[1:40:13] David for a kingly
[1:40:16] position are you with me he had Samuel
[1:40:19] the prophet anointed for a kingly
[1:40:24] position before he could pour the oil on
[1:40:28] him he had to call
[1:40:30] David so he sacrificed the blood and he
[1:40:33] called
[1:40:35] David and when he sacrifice the blood of
[1:40:37] Jesus for you he called you to anoint
[1:40:41] you for your kingly
[1:40:45] position it's called the spirit of
[1:40:49] adoption it's called the Peter called it
[1:40:52] the spirit of
[1:40:54] Glory if we suffer for him that shows
[1:40:57] the spirit of Glory is on
[1:41:00] us and we're predestinated to
[1:41:04] Glory we're predestinated to
[1:41:07] adoption we predestinated to the kingly
[1:41:12] position where you have the kingly
[1:41:15] authority to speak the
[1:41:19] word that's what a king position is it's
[1:41:22] supreme power isn't it there's no
[1:41:25] greater power than the
[1:41:32] K and so when God anointed
[1:41:37] David for his kingly
[1:41:39] position he did exploits of
[1:41:43] Faith he conquered the
[1:41:46] Giants Saul killed his
[1:41:49] thousands David conquered
[1:41:52] 10,000 but then what
[1:41:54] happened did David go to the
[1:41:57] throne did David become the chief
[1:41:59] Shepherd of
[1:42:03] Israel he became a
[1:42:06] fugitive he became a
[1:42:09] fugitive he became under severe
[1:42:14] persecution Saul hated
[1:42:17] him why did he hate him because the
[1:42:21] spirit of the devil came on
[1:42:24] him where does hatred come
[1:42:27] from it doesn't come from God it's the
[1:42:30] anointing of the
[1:42:32] devil and when he hated
[1:42:35] David he wanted to kill
[1:42:38] David and so David became a
[1:42:41] fugitive he became on the
[1:42:44] run and there's no
[1:42:46] doubt I'm anointed for a kingly
[1:42:49] position
[1:42:51] I'm anointed for a spirit of
[1:42:53] adoption I'm anointed for that Cloud of
[1:42:58] Glory and this is
[1:43:00] happening and that is happening and this
[1:43:04] is
[1:43:05] happening and David was
[1:43:09] flustrated I've been to inti
[1:43:12] inti in Israel the desert it's hot it's
[1:43:17] Dr it's Mountain it's red and he's
[1:43:21] and he's on the
[1:43:23] run and he's enduring the fiery
[1:43:27] trials here's
[1:43:29] Saul a church
[1:43:33] split and here's the Philistines the
[1:43:37] world and he's caught between the
[1:43:41] two that's my life that's your life
[1:43:45] we're caught between the
[1:43:47] two and so he's just pursuing him and
[1:43:50] pursuing
[1:43:52] him and sa saying Lord what have I
[1:43:58] done and so one
[1:44:04] day he had David
[1:44:11] corner and so the question is in
[1:44:16] closing why did God
[1:44:19] permit
[1:44:21] Saul to persecute
[1:44:24] David why did God permit
[1:44:27] it and here's why and here's your
[1:44:31] answer why you bear your
[1:44:35] cross to shine the light of
[1:44:39] reconciliation because kingly
[1:44:42] power without kingly
[1:44:45] character is
[1:44:48] satanic it can't rain
[1:44:52] kingly
[1:44:54] power is
[1:44:57] destructive without the
[1:44:59] character to control
[1:45:02] it
[1:45:04] hmon
[1:45:06] Amon had the king's signature
[1:45:10] ring how many knows the
[1:45:13] story am had the king's signature
[1:45:19] ring he had
[1:45:21] the Seal of
[1:45:23] adoption they call this a high ring of
[1:45:28] mystery but for me it's not a ring of
[1:45:32] mystery it's the king's signature
[1:45:36] ring and he had that
[1:45:39] ring and what did he do with it he had
[1:45:42] the character of the
[1:45:44] devil and he wrote a
[1:45:47] proclamation to destroy and kill all the
[1:45:49] Jews
[1:45:52] but there was a man that was
[1:45:54] humble his name was
[1:45:57] Mor and he trained his his like uh
[1:46:01] Esther to be a
[1:46:04] queen and not only that but he saved the
[1:46:07] King's
[1:46:09] life so he
[1:46:11] projected the light of
[1:46:14] reconciliation he projected eternal
[1:46:17] life so one day when hmon was just about
[1:46:21] to execute his
[1:46:25] plan God brought it to the king's
[1:46:28] mind and he then said what shall be done
[1:46:32] for the
[1:46:34] man whom the king Delights to
[1:46:37] honor and there came the enemy of
[1:46:40] enemies through the door
[1:46:43] am amen what shall be done for the
[1:46:47] man and you know the story oh
[1:46:52] me and it was
[1:46:54] Mori he he put the king's ring on
[1:46:58] Mori now watch The King's word could not
[1:47:02] be
[1:47:04] changed the king's word cannot be
[1:47:07] changed but he took that and he wrote
[1:47:10] his own
[1:47:12] declaration amen and he brought
[1:47:15] Liberty so God permits the
[1:47:18] trials and the fiery
[1:47:21] trial so you'll Shine the Light of
[1:47:26] reconciliation to manifest the character
[1:47:29] you
[1:47:32] need enter The Cloud of
[1:47:35] Glory for the Crown of
[1:47:38] Glory to Crown the Lord
[1:47:42] Jesus with a body like his own glorious
[1:47:48] body and so there it
[1:47:51] was Saul had David pinned in the
[1:47:56] cave David had no way
[1:48:01] out but
[1:48:03] now the final test was
[1:48:05] here you'll come to your final test
[1:48:08] brother and
[1:48:09] sister and so God steps
[1:48:12] in and the Spirit of Slumber falls on
[1:48:15] Saul and his
[1:48:18] army oh he sleeps like a baby
[1:48:22] and David's men
[1:48:24] said David the Lord has delivered your
[1:48:28] enemy into your
[1:48:32] hand kill him
[1:48:34] David here's your chance kill him
[1:48:38] DAV it was the last
[1:48:40] test it was The Last
[1:48:43] Temptation kill him
[1:48:46] David but David was
[1:48:48] anointed for a kingly position and David
[1:48:52] had a kingly
[1:48:54] character and he said forbid to touch
[1:48:57] the Lord's
[1:49:00] anointed prophets no
[1:49:03] harm no matter whether you agree or not
[1:49:06] don't touch his
[1:49:09] anointed His prophets no
[1:49:18] hard so David takes the the king's
[1:49:22] sword the king's sword and he cuts a
[1:49:25] piece of His Garment
[1:49:27] off and they wake up Lord wakes them up
[1:49:31] they go out and they start to go and
[1:49:32] David calls
[1:49:33] them he says sa sa and he looks and he
[1:49:37] sees it's
[1:49:38] David and David waves the king's garment
[1:49:42] before
[1:49:45] him and and Saul
[1:49:48] sees that d David could have killed
[1:49:52] him and Saul
[1:49:54] says now I know
[1:49:57] David you'll be
[1:49:59] king now I know you'll be king for I
[1:50:05] rewarded evil for
[1:50:09] good and you
[1:50:11] rewarded good
[1:50:15] for Revelations
[1:50:19] 3:21 the kingly
[1:50:21] promise that we see starting to
[1:50:25] unfold where is it placed in the
[1:50:29] scriptures at the end of the seven
[1:50:31] Church
[1:50:33] ages after Faith virtue
[1:50:37] knowledge patience godliness
[1:50:42] kindness then the king of all
[1:50:45] power perfect love comes
[1:50:48] down seals it all up
[1:50:51] that power that ruled in Eden that power
[1:50:54] that there was no fear in animals there
[1:50:56] was righteousness
[1:51:00] there let us
