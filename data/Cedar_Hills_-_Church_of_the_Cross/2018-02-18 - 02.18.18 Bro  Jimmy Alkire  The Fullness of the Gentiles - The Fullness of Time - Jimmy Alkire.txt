the certain completo is let's it's hard to trust these things translate these things well so how are you going to be complete for ourselves you said still complete oh how am I going to be complete come over here so you complete oh man so now with that in mind let's go to this chapters chapter 1 of Ephesians sort of almost - you know and we'll pick up some of what we spoke on last week but I don't want to go back into that Palomas low team of Esperanto mucho Nessa if you want to just go online in and watch it and try this you'll see how these things fit together come on methadone internet yeah it's a killer stone and may the Holy Spirit put it together for you it'll speak to something as you pray and seek the Lord mantis was there or a buscar Senor praise the Lord Ephesians 1 if SEO suno and we're going to start here with verse 9 well known whether he meant how many brought your Bibles or your tablets or how every your phone telephone us have been made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself no no no connoisseur el Mysterio de su voluntad según su Vienna plasencia tow in Kuala Sevilla propuesto and sí mismo that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ garanito las cosas en Christo en a dispensation del complement o de los de los tiempos hace las que estan en los cielos como las Gaston in a pea era Amen now let's go to verse 20 vamos a ver so winter how many has he made known unto you the mystery of his well understand should consider in Mysterio of his will the super who done the will of God has the mystery right level intelligence is to Mysterio that mystery might be different from either in this for you it's awesome still different

will of God in your life Mysterio the Laputa use in su vida you have to find it out who still looking like in control that's why we must pray for so tenemos chorus Oh Lord every day he boosts California now I'd like to get the definition of the word dispensation because it's talking now about the dispensation of the fullness of time that if isn't soon this was consumed care of that poor kid as la defensa soon del tiempo de la penita tiempo you might say well this doesn't have a whole lot to do with the fullness of the Gentiles doesn't indicate an amateur corner playing into little scandalous if you don't get this part here so you notice he visto partaking when we go into what the fullness of the Gentiles is for no intermission applause continue okay yes you're not gonna understand no intend ever I'm barely understanding it myself a pianist we know a AutoKey to look at and we're going to get into why time came to be we almost have any poor kid if you know tiempo there's a reason why it came but this word dispensation una razón que vino por esta palabra dispensation was only put into use no most of Westar and and Posada until after the fall no kid of this Quizlet like I either won't get into it wasn't right but let's get the definition of the word definition de la palabra a man the act of dispensing or distributing a lot to these dispensers dispenser or these thieves distillery yield and I like to break it all the way down to where maybe even some of the children ever could understand a harder case like a los newsprint in that law the process are giving something out to each member proceso de dar de algo akhada miembro how many of the members want something once member skerin algo I want something you could well go amen so now let's go to Galatians chapter 4 galletas cuatro and then I'm gonna read a quote this one brother Eddie I don't think I gave it to you I forgot but that's okay you'll get it when I put it up Galatians 4:4 a lot s

woman nos you know them occur what does it say Teresa made of the woman made of a woman amen I want you to get that because they receive a Nestle made under the law it's a little a because when it says it's made of a woman but when this occurs in a true Poornima heaven you have three words senators palabras create clear form or Mar and make yourself make a sir it has to entail something that's created didn't give initial okay yesterday Cho know something that's created algo que sí allí Lucas creado because heo is made and something that is made Lucas ed Jones where God takes what he created this one a little maluca creado and takes an element of the earth or one elemental de la tierra and forms it together for Mukunda Mendte he made it it's okay the circular most of a creative power that
