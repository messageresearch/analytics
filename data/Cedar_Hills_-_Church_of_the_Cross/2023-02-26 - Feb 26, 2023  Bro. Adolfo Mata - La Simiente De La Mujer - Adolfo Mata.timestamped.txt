[12:15] [Music]
[12:22] the Jews and what was it determined for
[12:26] upon not only Daniel but among Daniels
[12:30] Holy City
[12:33] see Daniel holy city now class what was
[12:38] Daniel's Holy City
[12:40] Jerusalem
[12:41] 70 we started terminal 9 leave the holy
[12:44] seed to finish the transgression making
[12:46] the end of sin
[12:48] and uh to make reconciliations for
[12:52] iniquity to bring in Everlasting
[12:54] righteousness to seal up the vision and
[12:57] prophecy and to anoint the most holy
[13:01] that was a six-fold purpose of the
[13:05] visitation of Gabriel
[13:08] now let's start number one to go to
[13:11] market you got pencils number one
[13:14] to finish the transgression that's the
[13:16] first thing
[13:18] now
[13:20] to finish the transgressions
[13:23] of Israel
[13:25] who transgressed against God
[13:28] will be the Turning Away of the
[13:30] ungodliness of Jacob we were contrary to
[13:34] Nature aliens
[13:36] without Mercy without god with no hope
[13:39] at all and God by his Mercy to give us a
[13:44] chance cut off righteous Israel because
[13:48] of transgressions and turn them aside
[13:51] throughout the tame Olive Tree and
[13:53] brought in a wild olive tree
[13:58] contrary to Nature
[14:01] onto a good tree how much more
[14:05] shall these which be the natural
[14:09] branches be grafted into their own Olive
[14:13] Tree
[14:15] then poor miserable people cut off I
[14:20] down or not knowing where they're going
[14:21] and thank the gods in his Mercy did that
[14:24] philosophy thing uh blinded their eyes
[14:28] from their own Messiah
[14:30] shut their ears up that they could not
[14:33] hear him yet looked out of these
[14:35] miracles in the vanities Miracles and
[14:37] things that even through it number two
[14:39] make our end of sin
[14:45] [Music]
[14:47] now let's read again
[14:49] Daniel
[14:50] to finish transgressions and
[14:54] and make an end of sins that's the
[14:58] second purpose of coming first is The
[15:00] Finnish Israel's translation and to make
[15:03] an end of sins
[15:05] where did Israel sin where did they do
[15:09] their vital sin where did they separate
[15:13] themselves from God
[15:15] here's where she's done her life's sin
[15:19] and the reason she's in the condition
[15:20] today Matthew the 27th chapter of Saint
[15:25] Matthews
[15:26] the gospel
[15:29] and the 25th verse of the 27th chapter
[15:38] [Music]
[15:43] the governor answered and said unto them
[15:46] whether all these trained with you that
[15:49] I released unto you
[15:50] and they said Paramus now remember
[15:53] that's Israel
[15:55] is pilate said unto them what shall I do
[16:00] with Jesus which is called Christ
[16:04] listen at it
[16:05] they all said unto him let him be
[16:09] crucified
[16:12] remember that's their Messiah that
[16:16] Daniel said would come
[16:18] [Music]
[16:20] remember this morning in the lesson here
[16:22] and you'll be cut off not for himself
[16:25] not nothing you do
[16:26] let him be crucified and the governor
[16:30] said while one evil has he done
[16:33] but they cry out the Lord saying let him
[16:37] be crucified that pilot saw that he
[16:40] could Prevail nothing
[16:41] but rather a tunnel was made and he took
[16:46] one and washed his hands before the
[16:48] longitude said I am innocent of the
[16:52] blood of this just person see to it
[16:54] listen here's your mistake
[16:58] here's your sin
[17:00] then answered the people and said is run
[17:04] Beyond us and on our children
[17:07] that is worth it
[17:12] he was making it into sin for them
[17:16] how could he do anything else let's
[17:19] forgive them knowing if he has a blind
[17:22] their eyes that we could come in it's
[17:24] like his own children calling for his
[17:26] blood
[17:32] that's the reason he cried for
[17:34] forgiveness for them forgive them Father
[17:36] for they don't know what they are doing
[17:38] they were blind
[17:41] foreign
[17:45] they did this but when they see him
[17:49] again
[17:51] demand what I need to send what is sin
[17:56] they did not believe that was a messiah
[17:59] they could not see him to be Messiah
[18:01] yeah he thought every sign of Messiah
[18:03] was supposed to do
[18:05] but they could not see it they were
[18:07] blind so when you see people saying I
[18:09] don't believe in about anything I can't
[18:11] see it I can't see the scratches the
[18:13] Holy Ghost don't be angry with them they
[18:15] are blind
[18:18] but Dad can't see this message of him
[18:21] coming I can't see this baptism the Holy
[18:23] Spirit I can't see the serpent seat I
[18:25] can't see this stuff they're blind
[18:31] just pray for them
[18:33] all right you know I believe but when
[18:37] they see him when he comes again it will
[18:40] make us end of their Unleashed to make
[18:44] reconciliations for iniquity
[18:47] iniquity is doing wrong as they did at
[18:51] the cross he made reconciliations but it
[18:54] will not be applied to them it was not
[18:57] applied to them why
[18:59] because they were blinded and could not
[19:02] see it amen and why did they run you
[19:05] said well maybe today was all time blind
[19:07] you're a wealthy blind
[19:12] they were blind because God blinded them
[19:14] but you're blind because you're
[19:16] willingly blind there's no
[19:18] reconciliation for you
[19:22] if you believe that I am he said Jesus
[19:25] you will sign your sins
[19:30] that's right as soon
[19:35] as that was a messiah she was born again
[19:39] in one day make reconciliations
[19:43] Four Seasons a Reconciliation for our
[19:47] iniquities on coincidence
[19:50] oh my
[19:51] [Music]
[19:52] God
[19:54] they just got what was evil not which is
[19:56] wrong reconciliations was made for their
[19:59] iniquities number four to bring in
[20:02] Everlasting righteousness
[20:05] when Israel's
[20:07] transgression has come to an end
[20:10] Satan who is their accuser and our
[20:14] accuser
[20:15] Satan will be sealed up in the
[20:18] bottomless pit
[20:20] when one
[20:22] when bringing in Everlasting
[20:25] righteousness something that cannot end
[20:28] all that cause unrighteousness will be
[20:31] got away with let's get Revelations the
[20:33] 20th chapter the 13th verse just a
[20:35] minute and let's read here just a minute
[20:37] and I saw an angel come down from heaven
[20:40] heaven the keys to the bottomless pit on
[20:43] a great chain in his hand he laid hold
[20:45] on
[20:46] the dragon that old serpent which is the
[20:50] devil and Satan and found him a thousand
[20:53] years and casting into the bottomless
[20:55] pit and shut him up and set a seal upon
[20:58] him that he should deceive the nation no
[21:01] more until the Thousand Years should be
[21:03] fulfilled and after that must be loosed
[21:05] a little season
[21:07] make on Everlasting bringing Everlasting
[21:11] righteousness
[21:13] Satan in the Bottomless Pits
[21:16] and when he does that and seals up the
[21:19] devil which has deceived the people in
[21:22] other words when the enemy
[21:25] has been put away
[21:29] the end of sin has come
[21:32] the bringing in of everlasting
[21:35] righteousness has come
[21:37] Satan is sealed up in the bottomless pit
[21:40] and the knowledge of the Lord shall

[45:10] [Music]
[45:17] foreign
[45:18] [Music]
[45:22] foreign
[46:22] have fellowship with all of you
[46:25] so we're very happy for that is
[46:38] to the Book of Genesis
[46:41] chapter 3 verse
[46:45] 14 and 15.
[46:52] foreign
[47:25] foreign
[48:21] stick your seat yeah
[48:26] once again it's such a pleasure to be
[48:28] amongst you all
[48:31] about two weeks
[48:35] the lord gave me a small thought
[48:39] and when the thought came unto me
[49:34] and since then the curse fell upon this
[49:36] animal is
[49:43] was placed between the two seats
[49:47] in other words they are not friends
[50:10] in the heel
[50:12] is
[50:26] so there's something there that's very
[50:28] tremendous
[50:32] so if we could take the time if the Lord
[50:34] would help us to enter into that
[50:38] so it's not the
[50:40] of Satan
[50:42] is
[50:44] because the devil he is a spiritual
[50:46] being
[50:47] who was created by God himself
[50:50] is
[50:54] but in reality it's the seat of the
[50:59] serpentos
[51:01] in whom the devil or Satan went in yeah
[51:05] and throughout the century
[51:13] to work through it is
[51:20] so it's the form that the devil injected
[51:23] himself into humanity
[51:25] and he continues to inject himself
[51:35] through the tactics which he uses
[51:39] through the humanity
[51:44] so we see that the seed of the serpents
[51:48] continues to be used by Satan it is
[52:05] but really it's the that is
[52:11] so really it makes sense
[52:15] because he has been dragging himself
[52:18] through the time man
[52:44] that the woman in itself
[52:52] there is no seed in here
[52:56] but enough for there to be a conception
[52:58] neces
[53:12] could then have children without a
[53:14] companions
[53:28] but the Bible says
[53:33] but we know that God himself
[53:42] and he produced a germ of Life in Her
[53:45] he asked me small he was God himself
[53:50] reproducing himself
[53:53] to come and flesh
[53:58] just like Satan uses the seat of the
[54:00] serpent which is
[54:05] reproducing himself
[54:08] to make himself a human yes
[54:22] and the promises
[54:57] that he will come through the woman
[54:59] men men
[55:02] tell us to be the name of God
[55:05] he had to come as a man
[55:07] and suffer as a man
[55:11] and bear all that men suffered but in
[55:15] reality
[55:17] it was God in Christ
[55:22] the world unto himself
[55:29] to reconcile the world
[55:32] two hymns
[55:34] through his son okay
[55:42] to us
[55:45] blessed be him
[55:47] but
[55:50] the Bible speaks to us
[55:53] in the beginning
[55:55] was a word
[55:59] was with God
[56:02] and the Word was God
[56:12] the word
[56:14] was made flesh
[56:18] the word made flesh
[56:22] in a man
[56:24] is
[56:26] and he had the holy spirit in him
[56:29] without measures
[56:33] in other words he had the fullness
[56:37] the holy spirit in him
[56:39] full of grace yes
[56:45] made flesh in a man
[56:54] walking on two feet
[56:58] now that was Christ Jesus
[57:01] is
[57:04] a word
[57:08] now you're with me
[57:11] now
[57:13] we said prior to this okay
[57:17] for there to be children
[57:21] there needs to be a union
[57:25] between a man and a woman
[57:29] to produce sons and daughters
[57:39] all that wasn't gone foreign
[57:59] and the church
[58:02] to Christ
[58:06] physically is not here with us
[58:10] holy spirit yes which is the anointing
[58:14] yes Christo which is Christ
[58:17] the Holy Spirit
[58:19] now in the church
[58:22] now we all know that a church is
[58:25] likened into a woman
[58:52] of God
[58:54] man man
[58:57] this is
[59:00] and God continues to bring the seed of
[59:03] the woman
[59:04] now it's Christ the anointing
[59:12] the Holy Spirit
[59:15] working in his church
[59:19] bring forth new births
[59:23] children of God
[59:26] Como just badri the father
[59:32] and the sun are the same
[59:36] because now the word
[59:40] needs to be made flesh in someone
[59:45] so that the world can be alive
[59:50] it must live in someone
[59:54] it needs to live in his children
[59:57] his brain to Iglesias his church
[1:00:02] needs to come to be
[1:00:04] La Novia palabra the word bribe La Novia
[1:00:10] the word or the bride message
[1:00:14] see that's who we are I mean
[1:00:19] now in my particular case
[1:00:23] 46 years
[1:00:26] now we've been following this
[1:00:29] gee
[1:00:30] this is you could say it's easy
[1:00:34] but only I know
[1:00:36] foreign
[1:01:17] we are the message of the hour
[1:01:32] Is Us
[1:01:37] because the spirit
[1:01:39] has come down to the woman
[1:01:45] bring for children to existence amen
[1:01:48] amen
[1:01:51] the message
[1:01:54] produced a message called
[1:01:59] what was the Holy Ghost given for
[1:02:02] eign
[1:02:03] take a moment to think
[1:02:08] what's Spirit given for
[1:02:10] eign
[1:02:45] shall see me
[1:02:49] the Holy Ghost given for eign
[1:03:56] [Music]
[1:04:06] is dead see yes
[1:04:11] but it must be the Holy Spirit
[1:04:19] bring forth a new life
[1:04:22] the letter kill it
[1:04:26] but the spirit will sanctify our
[1:04:28] quickness then amen
[1:04:31] now we're in the church
[1:04:33] condition
[1:04:38] where God
[1:04:40] is
[1:04:43] low through individuals
[1:04:48] working through those individuals
[1:04:53] seeking for the Lost
[1:04:58] to bring them into the fold of the Lord
[1:05:02] back in the Garden of Eden
[1:05:10] and he will speak with the son you say
[1:05:14] Adam
[1:05:17] wherefore art thou Adam
[1:05:41] those that belong to him hello
[1:05:49] with him
[1:05:54] now when he works through his church
[1:06:03] what it works with individuals
[1:06:08] they have come to the position where God
[1:06:11] can use them
[1:06:12] to an adoption yesterday
[1:06:16] performs a ceremony of adoption
[1:06:21] he took three Witnesses
[1:06:32] located
[1:06:35] there's also Revenge
[1:06:41] he is positioning his son
[1:06:44] he should do his work
[1:06:47] is adopted
[1:06:50] adopted
[1:07:09] and now gone
[1:07:12] has children her sons on this age
[1:07:21] they are now fellow workers in in the
[1:07:26] work
[1:07:26] gold workers co-workers yes
[1:07:30] they're co-workers in this in this work
[1:07:34] amen amen
[1:07:37] that's why you see your pastor
[1:07:40] Yandel Africa go in Africa
[1:07:43] there's a work he must do
[1:07:46] yes yes and it is
[1:07:52] doing that work is
[1:07:57] unity of God and man that is
[1:08:07] continuing the works of Christ
[1:08:34] but until the last times
[1:08:53] until Every Nation
[1:08:56] and when I say preach
[1:09:00] I'm not talking about taking a pamphlet
[1:09:03] I started
[1:09:06] and speaking but get up with them any
[1:09:09] person can do that but to praise
[1:09:42] we are ambassadors of the good tidings
[1:09:46] on Abraham uh president
[1:09:50] there's a lot of ambassadors of bad news
[1:09:55] all they do is take the bad news
[1:09:58] but we are not that way
[1:10:00] we are ambassadors
[1:10:03] are good tidings
[1:10:07] he is not dead
[1:10:10] wealth in US
[1:10:14] of God
[1:10:16] woman
[1:10:22] it is promised
[1:10:25] to bruise the seed of the serpent in the
[1:10:29] head
[1:10:30] because in our time
[1:10:37] continues
[1:10:39] continues his works
[1:10:42] and to be able to finish with that
[1:10:49] in the body
[1:10:51] it still moves
[1:10:56] be a very beautiful very flowered
[1:10:58] message
[1:10:59] many
[1:11:03] Les but it harms not the devil
[1:11:06] Godly but we gotta hit him
[1:11:10] where it hurts him
[1:11:13] and very often I say
[1:11:16] yes I would like for the devil
[1:11:21] that I could physically hit him
[1:11:24] and if I could oh I'd give him a good
[1:11:27] slapping
[1:11:39] I have to use the shield that the Lord
[1:11:41] has given us
[1:11:50] he says it was going through this narrow
[1:11:52] way
[1:11:54] which is the way of the lord it's a
[1:11:57] narrow path narrow way
[1:11:59] of the world is a broad way
[1:12:02] but this is a narrow way
[1:12:15] cross the way
[1:12:18] so if I would have my gun
[1:12:21] and he says
[1:12:28] he says I want it that way then to hit
[1:12:32] him in the head
[1:12:33] but then someone told me don't do that
[1:12:37] brother
[1:12:38] take that stick is
[1:12:48] wounded
[1:12:50] went into a pool of water
[1:12:52] foreign
[1:12:59] hopefully it dies
[1:13:06] was going through a very difficult time
[1:13:09] the people
[1:13:12] we're confusing him
[1:13:17] we're confusing him with a very anointed
[1:13:19] one
[1:13:23] Christ Jesus
[1:13:29] they were turning their focus
[1:13:33] he was the Christ
[1:13:36] I can't bear that
[1:13:38] is and the saddest part
[1:13:42] it wasn't those out in the world
[1:13:46] he himself says if it would have been my
[1:13:49] own enemies
[1:13:50] I would have laughed about that
[1:13:53] but it was precious brethren but it's
[1:13:56] yours and precious sisters
[1:13:59] that were then telling me this
[1:14:02] until the angel came Let It Go
[1:14:06] es he says you know that already
[1:14:08] happened
[1:14:11] Israel had so many years
[1:14:16] they confused him
[1:14:19] for Messengers
[1:14:23] or must we seek another
[1:14:26] is
[1:14:28] the same
[1:14:32] it's been so long that there's been a
[1:14:34] prophet on the earth
[1:14:36] now they're confusing you with Christ
[1:14:38] I understand
[1:14:44] hopefully that wounded serpent should
[1:14:46] die
[1:14:47] well it didn't die
[1:14:53] giving problems
[1:14:57] it's still giving problem in our time
[1:15:01] a lot of people haven't understood
[1:15:05] that God has risen up a prophet
[1:15:08] with the spirit
[1:15:10] with a message
[1:15:13] for the preparation of a bride and I say
[1:15:17] Amen to that amen amen and that's the
[1:15:20] way it is
[1:15:26] but
[1:15:28] you know
[1:15:30] the word
[1:15:35] reproduces itself when it's genuine
[1:15:38] but when it's
[1:15:41] not the power
[1:15:44] to reproduce itself again
[1:15:48] it needs to be genuine words
[1:15:50] and it needs to be made flesh amen amen
[1:15:55] today
[1:15:57] a lot of people
[1:16:01] have our own churches
[1:16:06] have been getting away from us
[1:16:09] now I'm not your pastor I'm not going to
[1:16:13] go deep into that but
[1:16:15] if someone's watching us online
[1:16:19] and put pay attention
[1:16:23] there is a spirit
[1:16:25] that's dividing churches
[1:16:28] so that if you don't believe the way we
[1:16:30] do you're not going in the Rapture
[1:16:34] and you have to follow a worldwide
[1:16:37] pastor
[1:17:03] all around the world
[1:17:46] with that
[1:18:21] I believe
[1:18:25] then they shall be saved
[1:18:29] be the name of God
[1:18:32] now the word that's spoken
[1:18:37] is
[1:18:38] the Original Seed
[1:18:42] the spoken word is
[1:18:47] the Original Seed
[1:18:51] now that word once it's been spoken
[1:18:55] it doesn't go back
[1:18:57] it doesn't change
[1:19:00] it remains forever that's who it is
[1:19:09] [Music]
[1:19:23] and the scene
[1:19:30] it is a scene
[1:19:33] it has life
[1:19:36] as well original that's original no
[1:19:40] Ivory the hybrid that mix
[1:19:43] directly
[1:19:46] not just States
[1:19:50] not just books
[1:19:53] very good as both of those things
[1:19:56] that's why I take my inspiration that's
[1:19:59] my message this is That's My Messenger
[1:20:02] amen amen but there are things that are
[1:20:06] in the message
[1:20:07] I've always been there
[1:20:20] [Music]
[1:20:26] it is the same God
[1:20:30] but using different vessels amid amen
[1:20:35] it is the word
[1:20:40] finish the Redemptive work of Christ
[1:20:43] a lot of people
[1:20:47] they say just press play
[1:20:52] I could go into a lot of things there
[1:20:55] but the only thing I can say
[1:20:57] yes you want to hear me press play
[1:21:02] press my button and I play for you
[1:21:07] [Applause]
[1:21:10] a man a man
[1:21:12] yo
[1:21:13] I speak as well
[1:21:16] because that word has been made flash
[1:21:19] that's which I follow it's not a myth no
[1:21:23] no no
[1:21:25] it's not a religion
[1:21:27] it's gone way past that is
[1:21:37] can you change something like that
[1:21:40] no no
[1:21:42] you can't change
[1:21:45] when God's already changed them
[1:21:47] the spoken word does not die it lives
[1:21:53] and it shall live forever
[1:21:57] and if we are the ones who take or carry
[1:22:00] it
[1:22:02] says
[1:22:12] and with you
[1:22:23] to reproduce itself
[1:22:26] when it was necessary
[1:22:30] to give the message to a eunuch an angel
[1:22:33] came
[1:22:34] he took Philip foreign
[1:23:15] amen amen
[1:23:17] so then
[1:23:20] continues to do his work
[1:23:23] he's always been a crystal to Christ
[1:23:27] very few recognize them
[1:23:32] it went right over their heads present
[1:23:58] yes
[1:24:00] will the bride have a Ministry yes

[1:25:52] do you understand your own positions
[1:25:56] God can really do through you okay oh
[1:26:03] sometimes we say well obviously
[1:26:06] I can't do much but if you give that to
[1:26:10] the Lord
[1:26:11] God can use that nothing
[1:26:14] to do much worse
