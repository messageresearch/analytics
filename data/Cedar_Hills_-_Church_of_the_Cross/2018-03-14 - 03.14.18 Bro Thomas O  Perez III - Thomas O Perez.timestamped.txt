[34:45] failure now Italia in Sweden de la
[34:48] Montagna
[34:48] we so tell you so Joshua had something
[34:51] for him this was within the I'll go
[34:52] Piraeus and he knew that the alliance
[34:54] between the hammerites elsevier killer
[34:57] aliens Central's immoral and they give
[34:59] me a knife he looks carnitas because the
[35:01] Gibeonites was one of the main royal
[35:03] cities for killers Donita surrealist and
[35:08] there was mighty men of valor
[35:10] yeah VN hombres por los they were Lord
[35:12] that twirled with the Gibeonites yeah we
[35:15] tell uncle Donita
[35:16] what they had heard ages have Ionescu
[35:18] channel that God had told Moses if you
[35:21] live yet each one we safe when you take
[35:22] the land cuando se toma la tierra make
[35:25] no covenant with the people there no I
[35:27] got back to con la gente de don't do
[35:30] nothing like that
[35:31] walking are they so don't make alliances
[35:33] with them no I got yes that's Canadian
[35:36] because they will be a thorn in your
[35:37] side por que hace una de Kooning it'll
[35:41] vex you it affects you country's local
[35:47] street that I country style tape it
[35:49] affects you the country star outfit
[35:50] it'll get you to the place logic arrays
[35:53] a Luger well then I'm gonna have to
[35:55] curse you don't know yet tener que que
[35:58] Melissa Lee and whatever you do to these
[36:00] other nations but Campos again cable mm
[36:03] a few nice it'll be done unto you if you
[36:05] do this said I hate to produce this yes
[36:07] hazel so these armies knew that it is
[36:10] this - that is too heavy pistol don't
[36:12] you love that our enemies sometimes know
[36:14] more about us than we know about
[36:15] ourselves
[36:17] second loss moister than emil Mucha
[36:19] business so the scripture tells us no DC
[36:25] that Joshua careful swaying makes a
[36:27] covenant with them it's all impact upon
[36:30] ages
[36:30] my first instinct to us me pretty minute
[36:33] interface why would he do that or carry
[36:36] is the scripture says it he was right
[36:39] with Moses when it was said and it's how
[36:42] I call myself under fairly choice until
[36:44] the Holy Spirit came to me
[36:46] exactly minami that's what he wanted
[36:50] them to think okay again because he
[36:54] killed in sin because he was Canadian
[36:56] nice and he was gonna unite his enemies
[36:59] okay he got oh nice enemy go to beat him
[37:01] in one battle but uh I reckon analyst in
[37:04] the workplace a new Luger one time what
[37:07] it is
[37:07] he was gonna take him right down a loss
[37:09] you up tomorrow he was gonna fight five
[37:12] separate battles so you're a penny a
[37:14] team cool but that is disappearance he
[37:15] was gonna call everything out country

[38:15] neatness the amorite king's los Reyes
[38:18] are more real they hear of an alliance
[38:20] between Gibeon escuchando nelly and
