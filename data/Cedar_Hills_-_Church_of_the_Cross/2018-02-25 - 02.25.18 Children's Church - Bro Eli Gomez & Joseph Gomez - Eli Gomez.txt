maketh my feet like Hinds feet and set setteth me upon my high places he teach he teaches my hands to wars so that they both still is broken by my mine arms thou hast also given me a the shield of salvation and thy gentleness has have made me whole great who knows what a hind is a hind is a type of deer that it can climb up any mountain that it comes across who has goals that they would like to accomplish today well with God he can accomplish those goals for you he can set you in your high places and the scripture is talking about how with God anything is possible for example Samson was just a normal dude but he surrendered to God he surrendered he said it he surrendered to God and need to mighty things he ripped a line in half and lifted up iron fence by himself the battle is the Lord belonged to the Lord or Moses Moses was just a man and he stuttered a lot and he was scared to talk to people but he surrendered to God and he delivered the children of Israel to destroyed the young the Egyptian army or David David was just a boy and brother Rigo said that brother branham said that he's just a boy but he he took down a giant that was talking bad about our Lord so don't think so don't think you have to battle alone no more cuz God is on your side and he holds the victory god bless you him glory can you stand up to your feet I haven't heard anything that great and all week and I'm just so excited that God is alive and he's powerful and he's great and he's in our midst and he's the greatest thing that we could ever hope for to be in our lives and in our hearts and he's here tonight how many just loved the Lord with all of your heart a man welcome to children's church welcome everybody welcome welcome to God's house it's so good to see all of you so good to be in his house isn't it tonight well I guess I should introduce myself I'm kind of rude just coming up here not introducing myself god bless you everyone it's good to see all the little ones up front but I you may be seated my name is Professor Leviticus can everyone say professor Leviticus professor Leviticus and that is my name yes professor Leviticus and I am so excited to be here in first of all I guess I should I should mention before I get too far along how I came to be known as Professor Leviticus is an interesting story you see well my parents the name they gave me was Levi Alexander Cornelius okay and my first day at school so I come to school right then the teacher says come up and introduce yourselves everyone and everyone comes up and there was like a billy and a Jane and a Suzy right and I come up and I say my name is is Levi Alexander Cornelius and my teacher says I'm sorry come again and I say my name is Levi Alexander Cornelius and she says very well we shall call you Davidic is for sure take a seat so that is why I came to be known as the Vedic s and today I'm professor Leviticus and and I think it's important for me to tell you as well that I used to be a teacher in school and they would teach biology and the math and the English who goes to school everybody who went to school okay so you know what I mean when I say biology and and math and English right and and I was doing okay for some time but after a while I began to be discouraged who's been discouraged before about something anything you've been do so you know how I felt okay you know I've felt about being discouraged and the reason I was discouraged is that I began to tell the little children about biology about the trees and I was excited I love talking about trees and the rocks and the grass and and as I would look at my students everybody was falling asleep and I would say oh look at the beautiful trees and this tree is then the Elm and this is the the fir and this one and yawn and everybody was just yawning in my classroom and I would say the birds and all you're on and the bees Oh double yarn and they just get we're just getting border and border so I said what am I going to do yes thank you so somebody one day came to me and told me Leviticus I know what your problem is I said what is my problem and he said kids aren't excited about biology and about math and 2+2 in 10 times 10 and they get tired of it but you need to change what you're teaching you need to tell people about Jesus because Jesus is the most exciting thing in the whole wide world and I guarantee you Leviticus if you go around traveling the countryside and you find houses of God like this one like Cedar Hills Church of the Cross I guarantee you you go in there and you talk about Jesus people are gonna be on their feet people are gonna be excited because he's the greatest thing that ever happened to the and I said hmm it's a great idea so I began traveling the country and now I give my gospel journeys with Professor Leviticus so who's excited tonight about the gospel journey that God has for us amen so what I would like to do I would like to tell you first of all my thought tonight and what I'm going to be teaching from the gospel now who knows that the gospel is simply the good news this is the good news so the gospel tonight is lift Jesus higher lift Jesus higher higher lift him higher we need to lift them higher so two questions I want to answer for all of you tonight I know you have burning questions in your heart that's why you're here that's why you've come to receive from what the Lord has for you to know you have burning questions in your heart lift Jesus higher so two things I want to answer for us is number one how how do we lift Jesus higher number two is why I'm very thirsty forgive me why is it that we live Jesus higher so we know he must be lifted up Jesus himself says if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me all men unto me and that's important today because everybody deserves a chance to see Jesus who agrees with me everybody deserves the chance we shouldn't harden to ourselves that's why our pastor is going across the ocean to share the gospel to lift Jesus higher that's why our prophet William Branham he traveled around the world seven times sharing the gospel so that he could be lifted up so I'm going to teach you children today how is it that we lift him up and very importantly why we lift up Jesus and who's ready to learn from the gospel tonight yes very good so I want you to stand to your feet I'm going to read the scripture first of all in this scripture it's going to help us understand how we lift him up now I did want to if they could put up a picture because I think somebody one day had a bright idea that they would lift Jesus higher and this is what they did isn't that amazing has anyone seen that statue that's Christ the Redeemer who has seen that statue anyone in the front have you seen that statue that's in Brazil so Christ the Redeemer somebody had a bright idea it's lift Jesus higher but I only I have a problem with that it's beautiful yes it's beautiful but that's not Jesus that's just the rock that's shaped like Jesus but it's not really Jesus and it doesn't do anybody good everybody that lives around that mountain probably one of the most sinful places in the world who's not doing anybody any good it's not how you lift Jesus higher so do we want to find out how we lift Jesus higher how he meant to be lifted higher okay then let's read the scripture I want you to turn with me to the Book of Isaiah who has their Bibles you bring your Bible with you it's your most important tool you need to bring your Bible with you so Isaiah chapter 12 Isaiah chapter 12 and we're gonna read verses 2 to 5 keep in mind lift Jesus higher one thing I forgot to mention very quickly one thing I forgot to mention we have a word of the day who likes words of the day with professor in Leviticus we always get a word of the day the word today is salvation repeat with me salvation louder salvation salvation okay so what I what I want you to do when you hear throughout the day throughout this short afternoon I'm not gonna be here all day I promise but throughout this afternoon I want you to when you hear the word of the day which is salvation take your seats really quickly really quickly take your seats so the word of the day is salvation when you hear salvation I need you to stand to your feet and I need you to say Amen thank you Jesus okay let's practice stand to your feet amen thank you Jesus oh well that's when you hear the word of the day let's sit down again we're going to practice practice run because it's important for the word of the day are you ready all right salamander okay you got to pay attention it's the only word of the day there's no other word okay you ready again are you ready Sacajawea no that's not the word of the day very good you're paying attention I love it I love when my class pays attention okay salvation a man thank you Jesus one more time one more time Salvage oh I almost got you all right one more time salvation salvation yes a man thank you Jesus all right good everybody's got it awesome job everyone remember where did the day's salvation amen thank you Jesus okay so we're in chapter 12 verse 2 and it starts off behold god is my salvation yes he is he's my salvation i will trust i will not be afraid for the lord jehovah my strength my song he also has become my salvation very good yes he's our i can see that you agree with me there's nothing greater he's my salvation yes amen and in that day shall ye say praise the Lord yes praise the Lord little Jonah knows what it's all about praise the Lord call upon his name declare his comings among the people declare his doings I apologize among the people make mention that his name is exalted seeing unto the Lord for he have done excellent things this is known in all of the earth so there's some clues in the scripture that we just read what is our theme lift Jesus higher lift him higher so how do we lift him higher well the truth is the answers are all in God's Word if he tells us lift him higher then there's a way to lift him higher so let's find it in the scriptures and in that day shall ye say praise the Lord now it ends that all the earth knows all the earth knows this now the only way all the earth is going to know this is if you and you and you and you somebody that knows him somebody that has received their salvation somebody that has received their salvation has told them the good news of the gospel so in here I find four ways who can count to four four ways one two three four four ways how we can lift Jesus higher it says praise the Lord we lift him higher in praise who comes to service just to sit on the Pew who comes to service to yarn Oh who comes to see somebody else your brother your sister no we come to worship Him and praise him so we lift him with praises then it says declare his doings among the people make mention that his name is exalted I skipped one sorry call upon his name how do we call upon his name in prayer we get down on our knees and we pray to God and that's how we lift him higher in our lives that's how we make him known in our lives call upon his name that's number two praise prayer number three declare his doings among the people make mention that his name is exalted what's he talking about that's the preaching of the gospel the gospel of salvation the gospel of salvation amen declare his doings among the people and that's exactly what we are doing today we're declaring what he's done what he's doing today what he's going to do number three preaching so we have praise prayer preaching number four sing unto the Lord for he hath onyx excellent things this is known in all the earth so who likes to sing so number four we praise him in song if the Lord is giving you music a song inspiration that is how you lift him higher lift him higher and higher so preaching praising praying and in song can we all do that that's easy enough yes yes he's called us all to do that because that is our salvation it is our salvation that's exactly how God becomes our salvation yes thank you lord alright next so I promised you that I would answer two questions is that right so now we know how to lift him up who's learned something today do you think so how we lift them up preaching praise prayer in song we know how we lift him up wherever you go not just in church but you want to praise him in school in work wherever you are you're going to praise the Lord by preaching by praising him by praying to him in song now the most important part today that I need to get you is how or is why why do we need to lift him up now we're gonna get a little bit serious just because this is important that we grab on to this and we take it with us because the why is so important if we go out to the world and we're praising and preaching it and we're doing all of that and we don't know we don't know why then eventually it's gonna get boring like biology right it's gonna get boring like math why is it that we do it why why did why does he need us to do it so I invite you whoever wants to come to come sit up here cuz I'm going to tell you a story who wants to come sit up here with me anybody come sit up here the little ones come up come sit up here with me because I want to tell you story and the reason I want you up here is because it gets pretty serious okay and it's important that you understand why is it that we need to lift Jesus up are you guys interested in learning why is it that we lift him up so it involves a story okay and I really enjoy telling stories and I hope you can see that I'm excited to tell you the story except this story is not one of those that gives you the the fuzzy Fillies the nice you know cuddly teddy bear type feelings and it's not one of those stories I'm really sorry but it's not one of those stories although it's one of the most the most important story that you all need to understand and know okay so you guys are ready to hear this story okay this story comes right from the gospel right from the Bible it's important that you understand that Winry this Bible I have a really big Bible there too but that one is very heavy so I'm not going to pick it up right now okay so it's important to know that when you read this and you read who knows that there's an Old Testament there's a New Testament yes when you read the Old Testament it's like foreshadowing who knows what foreshadowing is anyone first out it means that that it's like a sign like when you see a sign that says bump ahead then you slow down the car right well I don't think any of you drive right but but anyway so if you you don't have a she doesn't have a driver's license so I kind of figured that much but just just for illustration when you see the bump sign then you slow down because something's coming so the Old Testament is full of such things it tells us something's coming something great is coming just wait for it it's coming though and that's why I love to read God's Word it's so exciting to see so there's a story in the Old Testament and the story is about Moses who knows Moses yes he did he spit the Red Sea see this is why I love this did the children love the stories from the Bible they loved the Lord so he split the Red Sea and he delivered the children of Israel sure did yes he turned the river to blood yes he did he turned the stick into a snake very interesting this is where we're headed so he the children of Israel saw many signs and wonders many things had been done but they get in this journey they're on their way to the promised land and they get very tired and they need water and they're hot and they just can't take it anymore they're tired of traveling right and yes 40 years see he knows it's 40 years they're traveling so who would be tired after traveling for 40 years anyone here would you be tired I would so be tired so so they're tired and they began to complain who complains here oh I hate this cereal oh this oh this shirt is horrible I don't want to wear it who complains oh I need new shoes these are ugly right we all complain so the children of Israel started to complain and they said Moses you brought us out here to die didn't you we're tired of this food you have us on the diet there's no Chicken McNugget I know but you know what I mean you know when you really like there's there's no whopper jr. and that they're very thirsty and they're very hungry and all they had was this light fluffy bread I mean God was so good that it fell from the sky every night but they were so tired of it they were didn't want any more they weren't he wanted something else so they begin to complain and they begin to be very bad people just complain so what does God do very true put up the picture for me he he sent fiery serpents in to the people snakes who's afraid of snakes they're horrible right snakes are horrible look at that thing yes yes he sent snakes in among them they're sitting and they're sleeping and here comes snakes and the snakes were biting them he said this is not a very fun story but I have to tell it to get to my point okay they they begin to fight them and the people begin to die they have to come to Moses and they said Moses we have sinned we're sorry so this serpent it was a type of their sinning they're complaining and God's remedy was Moses just put up a brazen serpent like this one in the picture put it up and anyone that looks at it all they have to do is look at it and they're going to be saved they're not going to die so he obeyed God it was up to the people to obey God to so he was testing their faith because how strange is that how is that going to save us from death how is that going to cure our snake bite but you see the very thing that Moses put up the very thing that was killing them they needed to see it they needed to see it powerless they needed to see it not living stripped of any power and they needed to see it raised up to give them courage and they needed to obey the voice of God so they looked and they lived and anyone that was bit all they had to do was look at the serpent that Moses had raised so remember I told you foresee how do we remember I told you foreshadowing so this is telling us simply telling us something great is coming who believes something great is coming their salvation that's funny salvation is coming so they needed saving they needed us out a savior this is foreshadowing so I want us to turn to the New Testament yes young lady god did God created this fiery serpents he sent him among the people because they were not being obedient they were complaining and it was a type of their sin and we know what sin is if we don't believe God we don't believe his word then we are sinning we are sinful we need to repent and that's all they did they repented they said Moses we know we sin we need a savior we need salvation we need it yes salvation we need it amen thank you Jesus yes so we need a savior so in John now this is this is where we're coming to this is why we need to lift him up who has their Bibles John chapter 3 verse 14 if you're fine you're fine here you can yes you can get it if you want to follow along very good children John chapter 3 verse 14 through verse 15 now John chapter 3 verse 14 verse 15 this is why he must be lifted up this is Jesus talking and he says just like Moses and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the Son of Man be lifted up there's one other must in this chapter who knows what it is there's one other must in this chapter who knows what it is something that you have to do there's one other place in this chapter where he says you must you must be born again you must be born again so he's telling us for the second time he wants us to be born again no conditions you must you have to do it you have to become a new creature in Christ so he tells us here this is the way you the Son of Man must be lifted up he must be lifted up there's no way around it that whosoever who's whosoever who's he talking to in the air whosoever believeth in him should not perish but shall have eternal life that is salvation a man thank you Jesus yes that is salvation so Jesus Christ he came and yes thank you just like the brazen serpent he said I must be lifted up that whosoever believeth in me can you put the crucifixion should not perish so this is the thing we were all born come here come here Ruben to me come here to me so we were all born with this thing called this flesh right this is our flesh now we can't see the real Ruben he's in here somewhere he's hidden away but this is the Ruben that we can see and this is the one that we were born with right this is your flesh and that's how Jesus Christ came he came in the same type of body we have in the skin and even though Ruben wants to do many great things he wants to do good things he wants to be a good boy I know he does sometimes this guy is so bad he lies and he cheats and he steals and he doesn't do what's right and this Ruben in here he feels really bad I don't mean to tickle you I'm sorry he feels really bad in here okay so the very thing that's killing us this guy out here you knows you get older you can eat weeds burdensome he's heavy and he weighs on you every day but there's a way to salvation there's a way to Liberty the very thing that's killing us the very thing that's hurting us the sin all around us it's been raised high it's been lifted up and we can see it right there it's bruised it's being it's helpless the life is gone out of it and there's been a victory over this thing that's killing us the very reason he was raised up is because it's a cursed thing the Bible says anything that's cursed is hangs on a tree the reason being if you can understand me a curse is something that shouldn't have been the earth didn't want it the heaven didn't want it so it's been lifted up and for our eyes it gives us hope and it gives us peace that this - this flesh that God gave us that's we're born with it's cursed but there's a victory over it we can see that we can win and how do we know that he won he he won and that's why he's lifted up if we lift him up through preaching through praising through song then everyone else can see that there's hope and they're gonna come to know Jesus but how do we know he wants mom and dad how do we know he won because we see it there it's lifeless it's being it's bloody and it had to die but he raised it up he lifted him up for everyone to see that there's hope but how do we know that he won did he win he did save us this is the way he saved us because he gave his life for us he gave it for us for our salvation he gave it for us but my final question how do we know he won how do we know he won yes it's in the Bible how do we know he won it is in the Bible thank God it's in the Bible because it's there plain for all to see that on the third day he rose up from dad and he was perfect and he was no longer beaten he was no longer bruised he was perfect and he gave us eternal life he proved to us that there is victory over this flesh there is a way to defeat it there is a way to beat it and to rise up again in a perfect form and to live with him eternally that's true she says the devil lost and he won that is very true his rise up to your feet and give him thanks I think you little ones you can go have a seat now that is the greatest story that I think human ears could ever hear that he came to this world to give us our salvation he gave us our salvation there's a way to Liberty to be free and I thank him tonight that I love him with all of my heart because he provided a way who's ready to see he's ready to worship Him in song yes we've done a little bit of preaching we've done some praising there's been prayer and now we just need to sing a song to him because we want to lift Jesus higher who wants to lift them higher higher higher higher lift them higher so we're gonna sing a song I need some volunteers yes come on up but you're gonna have to do some some moves for me okay are you okay with that somebody else brother Julian further Paul
