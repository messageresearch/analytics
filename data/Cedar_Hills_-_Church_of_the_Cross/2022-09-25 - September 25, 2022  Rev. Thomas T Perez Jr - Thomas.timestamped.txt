[45:24] the Lord
[45:27] and and we're grateful that you are here
[45:31] you know I I you you take a lot of
[45:34] things of uh in life
[45:39] and you that have children
[45:43] you're really responsible to how they
[45:46] turn out you say is
[45:51] amen
[45:53] I gotta say that one more time
[45:55] you really are responsible for how they
[45:59] turn out
[46:01] you know the Bible says train up a child
[46:04] in the way that he should go
[46:09] you should know how your child is going
[46:12] to go
[46:17] man
[46:22] see how simple it is this morning
[46:24] but you get a lot of your traits from
[46:27] your family
[46:30] I have been blessed by God
[46:33] that I never have to look outside of my
[46:36] home for a hero you don't know
[46:40] you saw one of them preach behind this
[46:42] desk last Sunday
[46:47] I don't have to go outside of my family
[46:50] to look for my heroes foreign
[47:07] or maybe your mother
[47:13] and these are my mama's last written
[47:16] words
[47:20] you might you might know him but there
[47:22] might be people here that don't know
[47:23] them
[47:25] last words that she wrote down on paper
[47:31] this was when she was already there with
[47:34] her cancer
[47:36] and they're in the very last of her
[47:38] times
[47:40] and she writes this is
[47:43] to God be all the glory
[47:46] Gloria for all things
[47:50] I'm feeling very grateful to the Lord
[47:55] For All His blessings
[47:58] I don't know where to start
[48:02] because he keeps adding more because
[48:06] first the most precious thing that I
[48:09] have
[48:11] is the desire to serve the Lord
[48:15] I thank God for my salvation
[48:19] though I don't understand about my
[48:22] sickness
[48:24] I thank God that I'm never alone
[48:29] God is always there just
[48:32] when I have a question
[48:35] and even even there even though he
[48:38] doesn't always answer okay
[48:41] I I am I'm I'm just thankful that he is
[48:47] there
[48:50] words cannot tell or describe
[48:56] this was the lady that that was stricken
[49:00] with cancer is
[49:02] and as far as I know just a little while
[49:05] later she passed on to be with the Lord
[49:10] you know those things get handed off to
[49:13] your to your children
[49:17] the way you view service
[49:22] when you come to the house of the Lord
[49:25] the way you act when you come
[49:29] the way you worship
[49:55] it is impossible to love anybody else
[50:00] it is impossible to like anybody else
[50:05] the Bible says that God so loved the
[50:10] world
[50:12] this is what he had created
[50:16] this is this was this the man which was
[50:20] his ultimate creation foreign
[50:44] but you know when we come to the house
[50:46] of the Lord
[50:48] I thought I taught my boys but you say
[50:52] man you say Amen
[50:58] hahaha
[51:00] when you fire a gun does it go off
[51:05] foreign
[51:17] or do we say as the term says in the
[51:19] world do we go up half
[51:22] um
[51:36] when I see people worship God and
[51:38] they're looking at the at the ceiling
[51:44] you're not engaged
[51:47] when people walk in and they're like
[51:49] this and they're they're they're they're
[51:52] corvatas like that
[51:57] you don't know where you're at because
[52:05] laughs
[52:08] but when you come to the house of the
[52:10] Lord
[52:12] you go to you go to the restroom that's
[52:14] why we have a restroom
[52:16] s
[52:19] and in the restroom you have a mirror
[52:21] yeah
[52:23] to make sure you're tired straight
[52:28] to make sure your hair is combed
[52:32] make sure that you look half presentable
[52:37] you know why because this is the house
[52:40] of the Lord
[52:45] around man
[52:49] right correct this is the house of the
[52:52] Lord
[52:52] you are going to meet God here
[52:57] you say well brother you know I I bring
[53:00] him with you
[53:02] how does he travel
[53:05] does he like where he lives
[53:10] I I say all of this for a purpose
[53:14] you say brother it doesn't matter how
[53:16] you dress
[53:17] it doesn't matter it's about your heart
[53:22] and I say Amen
[53:24] but you know when you're gonna go to the
[53:28] bank
[53:31] and you really want alone
[53:33] you kind of look your best
[53:37] when you're going to uh to a to a nice
[53:40] restaurant
[53:42] you want to look your best
[53:45] thing when you come to the house of the
[53:48] Lord
[53:49] you want to look your best
[53:52] not only here
[53:54] but when you come to the house of the
[53:57] Lord
[53:58] and you come in yanin is
[54:02] you don't know where you're at
[54:06] if you come in here to do your manicure
[54:11] you're in the wrong place
[54:14] if you come here to talk about your
[54:17] brother
[54:18] you're in the wrong place
[54:21] but if you come here
[54:23] as soon as you open the doors
[54:31] he says welcome to the house of the Lord
[54:35] come with expectations
[54:38] that expectation yes I expect a sales
[54:41] got to be born inside of the person
[54:46] coming to church because there's nothing
[54:48] else to do
[54:51] you know that's why that's why I give
[54:54] Jerry brother Jerry a hard time and he's
[54:56] because sometimes he says well we could
[54:58] be doing other things
[55:00] puedo
[55:08] Bueno

[56:59] thing
[57:02] you go to the house of God
[57:08] because he lives here what can be the
[57:11] key because his mercy endureth foreign
[58:08] foreign

[59:06] me give me give me give me something
[59:08] and it's overflowing
[59:11] overflowing we don't even know what the
[59:13] blessing because we can't even catch up
[59:20] because your cup is small
[59:23] you want to receive more make your cup

[59:52] make your cup bigger Grande
[59:56] come on Isaac practice
[1:00:04] this is how big your cup is
[1:00:07] that's the reason come to the house of
[1:00:11] the Lord if we do this number now she
[1:00:14] was just a new middle you don't want
[1:00:15] anything you said no kidding now
[1:00:17] when you come to the house of the Lord
[1:00:22] Brother when you come to the house you
[1:00:25] raise up your hands son Something's
[1:00:27] Gotta happen
[1:00:28] you know why
[1:00:34] why Emma Henry do you say do you want
[1:00:36] the praise of p-r-a-i-s-e okay
[1:00:40] and then and then I caught it right away
[1:00:42] and I said absolutely absolutely thank
[1:00:46] you Lord gracias well to make matters
[1:00:51] there was a man from Colorado
[1:00:54] amen offered cash for my house
[1:00:59] foreign
[1:01:03] [Applause]
[1:01:46] so brother Henry that's the p-r-a-i-s-e
[1:01:50] report is
[1:01:53] [Applause]
[1:01:59] now watch this
[1:02:02] Cain worship
[1:02:04] but it wasn't according to the word of
[1:02:07] God
[1:02:09] through the word of the Lord
[1:02:12] the Pharisees worship
[1:02:16] but not according to the word of the
[1:02:18] Lord
[1:02:19] now this puts us in a in a in a kind of
[1:02:23] a precarious situation
[1:02:26] because Lucifer in heaven
[1:02:30] was the director of the of the praise or
[1:02:34] the worship
[1:02:37] he was the director of the worship
[1:02:42] so it kind of puts me as a as a worship
[1:02:46] leader a kind of you kind of think well
[1:02:49] how are we going
[1:02:55] and this is what brother Branham
[1:02:58] Venom Cain worship
[1:03:00] but it was not according to the word of
[1:03:03] the Lord
[1:03:05] so when our worship is according to the
[1:03:08] word of the Lord
[1:03:11] it produces the presence of God
[1:03:16] you know I love when you add the
[1:03:19] adjectives when you when you come to to
[1:03:21] the Lord
[1:03:24] I love how brother Diego says
[1:03:32] there's no one like you
[1:03:37] you're so precious you're talking about
[1:03:39] God now Allah
[1:03:43] there's no one like you no I'm not here
[1:03:46] there's nothing no one before
[1:03:49] we worship you Lord
[1:03:52] we worship
[1:03:55] you are worthy of our worship when you
[1:03:58] do that
[1:03:59] he appears foreign
[1:04:03] [Music]
[1:04:12] I'm sitting in my hotel room in Mexico
[1:04:15] City
[1:04:17] capital of Mexico on Friday night
[1:04:20] and when I'm sitting I'm sitting at
[1:04:23] about 2 30 in the morning
[1:04:26] when all of a sudden the Devil comes
[1:04:28] right to me
[1:04:30] you've talked to the devil before right
[1:04:33] there's no
[1:04:38] how many talk to God
[1:04:42] oh come on even ministers didn't raise
[1:04:45] up your house
[1:04:48] you don't you you don't talk to God
[1:04:50] you're in trouble Christians
[1:04:57] all right don't get too excited
[1:05:00] but
[1:05:01] the Devil comes to you
[1:05:04] and he came to me on that 2 30 in the
[1:05:07] morning
[1:05:07] because I'm sitting down
[1:05:10] he says what are you doing here
[1:05:15] well at first it it's 2 30 in the
[1:05:17] morning
[1:05:21] you get a little little bit a little bit
[1:05:23] scared
[1:05:27] I'm sorry I got to replace the attack
[1:05:31] and and and and when that happened
[1:05:35] then then the spirit of Christ starts
[1:05:38] rising up in you
[1:05:41] know and I and you start saying things
[1:05:44] like this
[1:05:46] maybe not verbatim he said
[1:05:50] but this attitude
[1:05:53] don't be asking stupid questions
[1:06:04] right he wants to see if you're scared
[1:06:05] of him
[1:06:06] yeah
[1:06:09] you know what I'm here for
[1:06:14] eign
[1:06:41] um
[1:06:42] now now many people say
[1:06:44] why did christ come
[1:06:47] brother do you Brothers do you actually
[1:06:50] know that you were the Forerunner of
[1:06:52] Christ is
[1:06:59] I'm going to explain this because
[1:07:02] Paul tells us foreign
[1:07:26] man you gotta know what your job is here
[1:07:31] when we come to church
[1:07:34] we come for a reason
[1:07:37] we come to to see him
[1:07:41] that's why I I sang the song all yo
[1:07:45] quiero Verde
[1:07:47] that's why I sing the song Oh I want to
[1:07:49] see him you know why I want to see him
[1:07:52] this morning
[1:07:56] do you know that every time you wake up
[1:07:59] in the morning
[1:08:01] brother Jacob the devil trembles because
[1:08:05] you woke up man
[1:08:13] I don't think you believe that
[1:08:16] brother Isaac
[1:08:18] when you wake up in the morning
[1:08:21] my devil gets scared
[1:08:27] foreign
[1:08:39] [Applause]
[1:08:59] thank you
[1:09:03] we'll get a little stronger afterwards
[1:09:11] do you know the significance of our
[1:09:13] pastor in Jerusalem right now
[1:09:20] well brother isn't this supposed to
[1:09:22] happen
[1:09:24] and the other supposed to happen is
[1:09:27] it is it we're supposed to go with
[1:09:29] brother Branham
[1:09:31] what is this supposed to happen before
[1:09:33] we go yesterday
[1:09:36] and the tribes and the Pharisees
[1:09:41] said this and this is supposed to happen
[1:09:45] and Jesus when he comes he says
[1:09:49] Elijah's already come and you didn't
[1:09:52] even know
[1:09:55] there are promises happening before you
[1:09:59] I promise
[1:10:01] sometimes we don't even know
[1:10:03] because we have our mind made up
[1:10:08] this is the fourth Sunday of the month
[1:10:12] don't look good today
[1:10:16] and our mind becomes made up
[1:10:20] when you understand brother Branham
[1:10:24] and he says this is
[1:10:26] the scripture that identifies brother
[1:10:30] Branham
[1:10:33] above any other scriptures
[1:10:41] and when he comes to the well
[1:10:44] it comes at a certain times
[1:10:47] and he starts having a conversation
[1:10:53] and the conversation starts with the
[1:10:57] compensation
[1:10:58] worship adoration
[1:11:02] you know my our fathers worshiped in
[1:11:05] this mountain
[1:11:07] it all it all starts with worship
[1:11:10] it all starts someplace
[1:11:13] and your relationship with Christ is
[1:11:24] again
[1:11:26] the man el hombre did not
[1:11:30] complain anymore
[1:11:33] Hamas having choose
[1:11:35] until he saw the man without feet
[1:11:44] the book of the book of Hebrews chapter
[1:11:47] 10
[1:11:48] and verse and verse of those and many
[1:11:53] men I want to just make emphasis to two
[1:11:57] words in that in that in that verse
[1:12:02] talking about the worshipers
[1:12:06] I'm not going to go to the purging I'm
[1:12:09] just going to go for the worshipers
[1:12:16] do you know that during this time
[1:12:20] was it a coincidence yeah brother Caleb
[1:12:24] going to Jerusalem
[1:12:26] and they find five heifers in Texas I am
[1:12:31] Cinco bacas
[1:12:33] shipped at the same time
[1:12:39] what is the use foreign
[1:12:50] you can't even worship God
[1:12:53] and understand what he is
[1:12:56] until he comes and he picks you up out
[1:13:00] of the my requests
[1:13:03] he justifies
[1:13:08] justification
[1:13:10] it's enough for you to shout for the
[1:13:13] rest of your lives
[1:13:21] but
[1:13:23] we're further along brother you just
[1:13:26] don't know where I remember
[1:13:29] and as you hear our pastor say something
[1:13:33] and he says this tremendous quote
[1:13:37] the great something the great something
[1:13:40] that he says

[1:13:55] yourself

[1:14:26] hands
[1:14:27] the majority don't even think anymore
[1:14:35] dong leaders know this that's why
[1:14:37] they're always saying come home
[1:14:52] and then we can go for hours
[1:14:56] you know you know you know you know the
[1:14:58] the Simplicity of it

[1:18:55] I'm very deep
[1:18:58] in the things of God

[1:19:03] you're so deep you're stuck
[1:19:11] you're so deep you're stuck
[1:19:14] you don't know where to go but let me
[1:19:18] tell you the height of the revelation in
[1:19:21] the Book of Revelation
[1:19:24] 24 Elders
[1:19:31] the Bible says
[1:19:33] took off their crafts
[1:19:36] they threw their crowns
[1:19:38] what's the height of the revelations
[1:19:47] what has God done in your day
[1:19:50] he sent us an apostle
[1:19:53] who positionally place Us in order
[1:19:57] what does that do to us yes
[1:20:00] take off our crowns
[1:20:04] a revelation of the hours
[1:20:07] when you see our pastor preach to us
[1:20:12] words of eternal life
[1:20:15] you've never seen in your life
[1:20:19] it makes you take off your crap
[1:20:23] it's the height of the revelation
[1:20:30] when they very captures
[1:20:34] in Psalms 107 he
[1:20:41] says verbatim is
[1:20:45] oh give thanks unto the Lord
[1:20:49] for he is good okay
[1:20:52] somebody got to tell you some of your
[1:20:54] neighbor he's good foreign
[1:21:24] [Music]
[1:21:38] because he is good all right sit down
[1:21:42] now
[1:21:43] every American I'm both even if well
[1:21:46] whatever you are yeah I'm both yeah
[1:21:48] stand up twice I'm already standing up
[1:21:52] yeah we're all Heinz 57. every American
[1:21:55] does America you're an American under
[1:21:59] your feet
[1:22:10] be seated
[1:22:11] Give the Lord Jesus a round of applause
[1:22:14] amen
[1:22:17] [Applause]
[1:22:26] he is good president
[1:22:39] and then it says this
[1:22:41] Psalms 107 and verse 2.
[1:22:45] let the redeemed of the Lord say so
[1:22:55] am I redeemed
[1:22:58] I've been bought with a prize
[1:23:03] for the worshiper
[1:23:08] you you can't even get cleansed if
[1:23:10] you're not a worshiper you still know
[1:23:12] personally
[1:23:16] your brother he he cleansed me okay
[1:23:18] that's fine
[1:23:21] it says for the worshipers
[1:23:26] you can't even get clean unless you
[1:23:28] worship
[1:23:30] oh I know a bunch of scripture
[1:23:33] fine
[1:23:36] but for the worshipers
[1:23:41] that scripture is going to make you do
[1:23:43] something
[1:23:45] that scripture is going to make you do
[1:23:48] something
[1:23:49] that scripture it says will has the
[1:23:53] power in itself
[1:23:54] to produce the product
[1:24:04] so when it comes
[1:24:06] that word
[1:24:08] I'm going to say it again
[1:24:11] when it tells you raise your hands
[1:24:16] it produces the product
[1:24:20] I can't brother
[1:24:23] okay and let's go to another one
[1:24:28] when we ourselves
[1:24:31] we we come the worshiper would come
[1:24:35] in the old testamento in the Old
[1:24:39] Testament
[1:24:40] and he would come and he would bring
[1:24:44] Islam
[1:24:45] what would he have to do
[1:24:50] he had to put his hands on it
[1:24:54] right corrector meaning that he was
[1:24:56] transferring
[1:25:00] his sins suspected through that lamb
[1:25:04] in the old testamental testamento now
[1:25:07] then that lamb was killed
[1:25:13] would only covered
[1:25:18] the worshiper now he would he would feel
[1:25:21] all right
[1:25:22] for a little while he feel all right
[1:25:25] but it only had enough power to cover
[1:25:29] him
[1:25:32] but the blood of Jesus Jesus
[1:25:40] say it again amen but the blood of Jesus
