[Music] on the last Mays guns though the [Music] we do have a special this evening our sister Lana um as a poem for us god bless you and forgive me I didn't put my readers in my purse and these have readers and I'm not trying to be cool okay and I also had requested a short testimony and brother Branham says that will pay for our neglection he said you neglect to testify of the glory of God neglect to give God the praise and glory you'll find yourself cold formal and backslidden and I want to give this testimony of for the past 14 years I've been seeing a Rheumatologist for a very painful dangerous potentially dangerous arthritis condition and the treatment was very potent expensive weekly shots and it controlled the help control the pain and the the inflammation in my body and during these visits they would all check my blood and check my arm PRC level which is the level of inflammation in your body and for the past 14 years the the rate in my body was so high that it these shots had were to lower my immune system and so that it would it would you know help control the disease well I didn't write it down but I'll get it but anyway on the last visit oh I had been told by a few doctors I did my best of count was 5 doctors that I was at very high risk for a heart attack and that one doctor even told me I was a walking heart attack and so this last visit which was this past Monday I was there and he was reading my bloodwork and he said I don't know what's happened or I can't I don't know why he said but for the first time in all this time he said your CRP rate is normal and at the at the time he told me that I was I was feeling pain in my chest but you know what I I believe what the Prophet said and science has even proved it now that a disease can leave your body and these memories sales can tell your brain it's still there you know but today I stand before you with no pain whatsoever in my body I give all the honor and the glory and I testify to his goodness and his mercy and His grace another time thank you and I do have a poem that this morning I was just I was praying and the first to the poem is the the prayer that I was praying to the Lord and then I just got my pen and paper and started writing and I hope it's a blessing surely today Lord I want to thank you for Calvary but you're suffering did not just begin that day but it started when you were born wrapped in humanity accused since birth of being illegitimately born being scoffed for claiming a heavenly father and all the rumors humiliation and false accusations you suffered in the years that followed though we don't know much about your childhood how we wish we could take a closer look but it was not recorded since you never wrote a book perhaps it would have said how you were teased because maybe you acted a little strange the other children may have mocked you because you wouldn't play some of their games did your siblings overlook you out of envy and make you feel left out because your mother was probably very protective of you no doubt I imagine you were very proper and obedient your nature very humble and meek some may have thought you were a little slow because you would think before you would speak so many things you must have suffered because you were the son of God though you were not born privileged you were born well-equipped to do the job by the age of 12 you confounded the wise and well-versed but you were the Word made flesh and even corrected your mother when before them she denied your birth perhaps as a carpenter stepson you may have been assigned the harder work to be done I don't believe you would have complained or have shown a bad attitude but you may have slipped away and shed lonely tears no one knew but you as you grew older your trials and tests could have only become rougher because the word declares even you learned obedience through the things you suffered not protecting in the normal things that me and your age would do you were preparing for the greatest trial of all the purpose you were born to see it through you the master diamond would soon get the final cut for years you had been shaved and cut for us there's a part each diamond has to lose to make it Sparkle in direct light it will show the rainbow colors and produce fire when hailed just right now each of those colors represents gifts but only if by Christ that diamond is lit he was the one who was wounded and bruised and hid that he might reflect himself back to the whole world but God needs something in his hand to make something with the logos the great fountain the master diamond chose us in his plan and we are that something in he needs in his hand to reflect his light shades of green blue emerald and red to prove his alive today that he is not dead that his life and all his sufferings from birth to Calvary was not in vain but he rides this trail again giving and living through you and me amen may God bless her sister if you could please stand we're gonna be receiving our Minister for this evening it's gonna be our brother Jimmy Elk higher you can just sing this song with me come on now there are Mart they told me chorus oh oh there are media [Music] madness [Music] my flowers [Music] [Applause] [Music] only said I [Music] Oh [Music] the Oh [Music] Oh [Music] but I than you [Music] bah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
