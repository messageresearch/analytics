========================================

[Music] [Applause] [Music] dear Lord gracious and Heavenly Father Lord or we are so grateful and so thankful Lord to be called your people Lord to be called your bride Lord Jesus Lord for everything that has gone on through this week Lord but yet Lord Lord we are so grateful for your protection Lord for your guidance Lord and for for your love and your knowledge towards us Lord to that that we know Lord exactly the time that we're living in Lord and Lord we're so appreciative for all that you do Lord Lord we ask that you would be our invited guests here this morning Lord Jesus and Lord that we would hear right from your mouth this morning Lord what you have to say unto us Lord and Lord we ask that every person that is that will hear your word this morning Lord that it would take root in their hearts Lord and that our hearts would be open to you Lord and that we would receive abundantly above measure what we could ever ask of Lord Lord we ask all these things we place this service in your hands Lord and we place our lives in your hands this morning in Jesus name Amen you may be seated we'll be hearing the rest of demonology this morning god bless you to him as he spake to me for the Lord has written his kingdom out of the hands and has given it unto even daisen now many of his familiar with this how we want to go right in and God help us now for the a few moments to get into this now watch there was a man Saul who was once considered a prophet for he prophesied with the prophets is that right teachers now I hear the man was back slidden is that right but remember where Samuel said he would be with him at the next day prematurely gone see alright you won't mind God God will take you off the earth look in the Corinthian letter they're hot Paul set those people in order he said first I thank God for you that there's no such things among and so forth and how that as you come shorter no spiritual gift telling them what they was positionally in Christ then he begin to let the hammer down on them tell them about their women preachers and how they were doing and how they were eating at the Lord's table and even one man living with his stepmother and he said to this name in Christ turn him over to the devil for the destructions of the flesh that the soul might be saved that's it turn him over the Bible said for this cause many are sick and weakly among in matter sleep gone on prematurely because of sin God taking you out of the way good sign you was a Christian it is taken so now notice in year Saul was considered one of the prophets are among the prophets because he prophesied and now he had back slid because he disobeyed God and his kingdom was ran out of his hands and placed into the hands of David through God had anointed by Samuel with the cruciform notice then there was three ways that they had of finding out things from God the first was was the prophet the second was a dream and the third was the Ihram efendim and they neither would answer now you know what a prophet is you're a lot of spiritual dream is and you know what the year and the funding was you know what the other day I asked and then what about the Yerba and that man couldn't tell me what it was the Ihram of London of course was God answer but he see and the devil makes the counterfeit of every one of those the wizard the false prophet and the crystal glazier see now the Urim of thunder hormones Aaron's breast here and the Urim and Thummim covered over that stones and they hung it in the temple and when there wasn't sure they go before God an answer and a light but flash on that year a month on them which was well it was God's will or not now when the Urim of thunder moon answer now that was the direct answer from God now the Urim of thunder of today the fortune-teller took a crystal ball to pattern at a false thing gods in a trinity God's powers as in a Trinity and the Devils in a trinity and his powers as in Trinity now I can prove this by the viable and that year in the Sun um there was only the crystal balls the devil uses today and the false prophet back here today the one that we have now was our The Witcher the fortune teller out on earth took the place of the Prophet on the devil's side see what I mean now then the Urim and Thummim today is dis Bible if somebody has a give a prophecy or a dream and it don't compare a reco with God's Bible is false don't believe it a man come to me not long ago from India were mystics them to go a fine little preacher he said brother Rama I come over here said a woman had the Holy Ghost and said she was just a sweetest nicest woman he said and she's been married four times it was living with her fourth husband and I said well how could that be Lord and said I went to him and said Old Glory that gods that hallelu you praise the Lord just one of that's high to know that out of loo you praise the Lord so the Lord told me Jericho gave you dreams and said ah dreams at my wife I've seen her living in adultery and she come back to me and said all was you for Jimmie Victor was you for Jimmie I did why I said sure I'll forgive you take you back he said now that's what I did said CI for you I said Victor your dream was mighty lovely but the devil give it to you he said why I said don't compare with God's Word she's living in adultery absolutely she can't live with for man right she leaves that and goes back to her first she's worse off than she was beginning chefs live single the rest of her life I said you know that don't compare with God's Word so heard your dream was false and I said it won't compare with this and when a prophet I had a a give a prophecy and they spoke in morning she that prophecy was true they put it before the year of a Sunda and as a voice of God sold the lights on the Urim asunder then it was absolute the truth and if a man gives an interpretation gives a dream give something of the Bible and or something other and it don't compare with God's Bible it's false there's the Urim of funding today God's Word speaks annex direct the voice of God like a year of a thunder was before the Bible was written Hey I feel Kyra lidge's right now I don't take the air of fanatic if you do it I know I were mad I'm not excited that's right here is the truth God's Word I don't care what type of dream you add or watch have a prophecy given if it isn't God's Word it's wrong so don't compare with that word that's what's of trouble a date one has a dream one a disease you want to have the tongue one has a revelation it's got the whole thing so messed up and everything you got denominations and broke up everything you ought to bring it back to a final foundation and that's God's Word that's true churches are built upon once at all Jesus come out on a white horse I know I've seen in a vision they make the Church of that time all hallelujah come on the cloud they make it in that time break them up the separating coal or another buzzards roost and let's hang out and everything like that why brother go shoshone first place your heart's not right with God when you do that right we were brothers we must stick by one another we need one another now I look solid back slid and he goes up you have got eternity face from him anyone up that he acquired with the prophets the prophets went and tried to prophesy and God put all foot and give a vision prophet coming up to the Hawking all he never told me nothing about you well then he said large give me a dream not extra night no dream come then he goes into the Yerba Thunder and he said oh god I've tried the prophets of God the dreams now you help me with you it cut it all no life flash at all then he resorted to a which low degraded and he went to her crawled in our disguised himself and this which goes out he calls up the spirit of Samuel I know what you're thinking they said that wasn't Samuel but the Bible said it was Samuel and it was Samuel strange I checked that is inconsistent but that was Samuel the Bible said it was and that which could call him up and she called up Samuel and Samuel was somewhere else but was conscious of what was going on and was still standing with his prophets man alone he so brother when you die you're not dead you're living somewhere somewhere else let me stop just a minute to get this demonology down just a little bit she was a demon but she was in close contact with a spirit world now today there's many spirits that know really more about the spiritual and people who profess themselves to be Christians yet she's a demon in the Bible times is the same thing when Jesus was here on earth there was an professors and scholars and teachers some of the best was are the better seminaries and we could produce today and wholly renowned man they had to be if a Levi for sound he had to be found blameless righteous in every way and yet that man known the more about God than our rabbit note about snowshoes when Jesus Johnny failed a recognizing and he called Jesus a devil he said he's Beelzebub the Prince of the devil is that right and here come the lowest type of a demon that had a man bound on the tombs and everything and they called out the devil himself that we know who you are you're the Son of God the Holy One is that right witches and wizards devils recognized him the son of God while educated Theological Seminary preachers recognized in the deed Beelzebub which was right the devil of the preachers the devil of and brother it hasn't changed too much today they don't recognize the power of God no matter how much teaching you got you can drum that into you God's not in big word gods an honest heart you might send your speak these words like I don't know a lot that doesn't bring you closer to God you can stand and practice how to preach your sermon and say these things that don't get you closer to God you can learn dictionary to you sleep with one and it still wouldn't get you closer to God I'll humble submitted heart and the simplicity is what brings you to God that's true amen humble heart God love now no matter if you don't know your ABCs that don't make any difference just a humble heart God dwells in a humble heart not an education fountain schools not in theology seminary not in all these other different places not in big words non classical places God dwells in human parts Knowle or you can break yourself down the more simple you can become greater in the side of God let me give you something I see your fields are full of weed out here a full head of wheat always bowels a little sprig sticks up there flopping around like it knows everything they got us in the haze that's the way of a lot of these guys that thinks you got a hold on your head nothing about the power recognized Jesus Christ as the Son of God and believe he's works and he's the same yesterday all these recognizing sure in a historical standpoint but it's not a history thing people set up their outreach Pentecost for there's a great outpouring and things like that and paint afar a freezin man can't be worn by a painted fire painted far don't wanna that's what they watch what is it today if he's the same yesterday today and forever that's painted far some fella freezin s they look at that big far their head like that don't get you warm what they did if they cost what they had in the early testament we got today and as soon as God can get the thing on down the church set together rapture will come but we Shane even get paid for divine healing let alone the rapture because we're all twisted up one this way and one that way dr. Sean saw said it was this what my preacher said he was this a while ago a woman said he's just a faker so my priest told me so I wish her preach to come down here once would see was a faker we're see

brother branham sales tonight for us to leave the building so I'm going back at the back end and sit down he said they're fixing to exposing tonight here on the platform he said I've seen many hard battles who seen God take his place that I just going back to sit down I walked up I said I was just reading a little article here that were I was to be exposed tonight that's a platform here I said I want the FBI agents now to come forward and expose me up here on the platform I said I'm standing here in defense of the gospel don't you come and expose me oh it uh said maybe they're not here yet I know where I was that he'd already showed me my room up yonder what was gonna happen for left you see and I said I said maybe I'll wait just a little bit and I be saying him and somebody come up and sing a solo I said mister FBI agent or you inside or out I'm waiting to be exposed would you come forward nobody come I kept wondering where was that the Lord told me it was what it was this to backslidden preachers not I've watched it I've seen a black shadow hanging in the corner I knew what was that I looked over there it moved right up and went up into the gallery like it's a man with a blue suit on one with a grade I said friends there's no FBI what the FBI's got to do was preaching the Bible I said certainly not there wasn't to FBI agent to expose me but here's the exposure there they set that up there then to preachers rather in the gun out so don't get down like that and are doing them big textures to go to warfare and grab ahold about to know brethren this is not a flesh and blood affair just set still God will take care then so now brethren look while you're up there look this away I said if you said that I was Simon the sorcerer under witchcraft eyes bewitching the people I said if I am Simon the sorcerer then you are the man of God now you come down on this platform and if I be Simon the sorcerer let God strike me dead in a 5d God's prophet you come down and let gob strike few days now we'll see who's right and wrong now you come on down we're singing him out of that building they went and we've never seen him since I think I said come on if I'm Simon the sorcerer let God strike me dead and if I'm God's prophet then God will strike you dead when you come to this platform if I am truth before God goddess I let you die on this platform they know it better that's dry they know better than heard from other places that's right so don't never think of what God still God he answers now this which of interest she called up the spirit of Samuel and saw talk to Samuel now you might wonder how that could be done it cannot be done today no sir the calls the blood of bulls and ghost was only a waiting for the time of fulfillment when a man died in them days preachers back now if you think it's right when a man died he died under the atonement of an animal and his soul went into paradise and there he stayed until that to the to the day of redemption and his soul was in there let me draw you a little picture here how many read my article or the article they wrote about me and Reader's Digest here about an October at November's issue all right you notice how that was did you notice about two or three weeks before that this great famous medium here it's been tried since way long time ago parisa pepper did you ever a way we read that mr. peppers article in The Reader's Digest is the strange how them two spirits much time as I got not for just a loon for 28 or just I have to hurry I know he got look excuse me for a minute you know there's there's false is your true and a false of everything if I give you a dollar and I says this is good dollar and you look at it it has to look pretty much like a real dollar you and believe it is that right sortal have to be really a good imitation and the jesus said the two spirits and the light stays to be so close to it would just see the very elect if possible religious people now remember now there ain't nothing out there and then we'll call for coal formal outside they have just a form of godliness you see but these two spirits are real spirits to be supposed to deceive the very elect Howdy's working side by side in the last days did Jesus say that he did now watch fans will draw your little picture and won't you look at your just a minute you give me your undivided attention cause I'm gonna give you a parable and then you sit and the readers digest it wrote up there I was standing out there we had 2700 people waiting to get prayed for standing out there you read the article and a man come down from Canada and he had a little boy that had been two males and John Hopkins of serious brain disease that drawer - little hands in my kiss and drawl his legs up under and they said there's not even an operation nothing can be done so he took it back to chanting said I'm not whip chip you get November's issue of the Reader's Digest and let's call it the miracle of Donnie Martin and they said that in there that's that the man said I'm not whipped yet they called I know a faith healer named William Branham that's calls two of my friends who was deaf and dumb to speak in here and if we they called or trying to find where was that in America yet and I was over to Costa Mesa California and it's just article when you read it get ready to cry it just break your heart how you went through snowdrifts and everything else was that baby he said be careful Donnie so now we're not defeated in little boys couldn't even smile hardly you're so afflicted so we're not defeated we're going to ask God we'll go to God's prophet and asked him so then they come to the snow and they finally got down there and the mother was coming with him and it didn't have money never go by airplanes so the sense of mother back and the boy and daddy had to come on a bus and have they rode all the way from Winnipeg Canada to Costa Mesa California and the guiding their broken the father tells out I had just changed the little diapers on this little boy about seven or eight years old it's perfect they help us and how he would couldn't get a chance to eat there nothing and said his little boy could just hear him talking he could tell away his eyes looked at he was he was trying to smile you know I know that is telling different sites she was seeing over in America and when they got in there to California they said to the travelers aid why do you come to scene he said come to see a divine wat the big question mark course you can imagine what America said about it you see that's up we so smart we know everything you know on there's no need telling us anything we got it all ro down see so then so a divine watch come always from Winnipeg candidate well they thought that was horrible anyhow the newspaper touched a car and sent him over there and he said when they got to the line where is that's the 2700 people is waiting to be prayed for but say when they seen that deformed little oven boy and that poor daddy with his tap on his ragged coat said everybody just stepped aside and give him his place when he hit the platform it's against the rules to swap a car prayer card somebody must come to the meeting and get your own card if they're ever caught the line swapping prayer cards on somebody else the prayer cards dishonored see because you must come here the instructions to know how to receive it it's up to you you can't get it for someone else yet come get it yourself so you you're some big persons that are out I don't believe notes in this thing but maybe if you heal me I you see and then that causes the fuss at the platform so they just call that thing out before he gets there so when the boy started a father started on the platform ahead of the people Billy asked him for his prayer card he didn't have any said then I'm sorry sir said you'll have to wait you said alright so now wait said I'll just take my turn like the others and said I didn't know I had to do this and so I was talking to someone I had to hear it I've seen that father go away not to what was the marriage said he didn't have a prayer card then something sent me bringing back so I said bring him here and the father come up in the tears running down his face kneading shaving and he walked up and here's the Reader's Digest that this guy asked no questions but look right straight in the face the baby told a baby where it was from it had been two males clinic all about what was the matter with it how sick it had been and everything and so the father started crying and started to leave and said he started on four platform and he turned around he said that's right sir he said but will my baby ever live I said that I can't say I said just the moment I've seen a vision of here I said you won't want to believe this because males and Hopkins both said that operation couldn't be performed on that brain but I'll tell what you do you tomorrow you just go ahead with this baby within the next three days you're going to meet a black headed woman on the street and that woman's going to ask you watch the match that baby and then she's gonna tell you of some little country doctor out here that can perform that operation and you won't want to believe it because that males turned it down and says impossible to be done but that's the only chance your baby has to the power of God the mercy of God and that operation now if you bring me to be his prophet go do as I tell you like putting the figs on Hezekiah and so forth he said he turn around - thank you walked off two days or more passed in his downward street one day and a lady walked up said watch Mary your baby says it's got a brain disease and his going on talking aye captain well he thought it was awful bad you know so he said just a few minutes something taking place she said sir I know someone who can do that operation he said lady look Mayo brothers give it up and said it can't be done said of Madoff your supreme part name brother Branham said he's made a prayer for the baby she used to wait a minute black hitters weren't a great coach suit but that's her so worried that doctor and he told him tuck him up there and the doctor performed the operation the baby got well [Applause]
