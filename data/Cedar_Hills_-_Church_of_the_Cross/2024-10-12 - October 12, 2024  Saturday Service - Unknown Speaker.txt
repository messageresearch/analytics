themselves and call on Jesus where's the worshippers and they look to Heaven expecting as they pray oh I just feel like something [Music] good good evening God bless you I'm surprised uh not not that I didn't know it wasn't gonna happen but that happened so fast I was visiting the pastor during the week and he said that he was uh inspired by God and he wanted to do something different he was sitting on one side of the table and I was sitting on the other side of the table with our families and during the our conversation he said what do you think he he said he said big Fred is all do you think you can speak at the moment say an hour or two I was Brave at the moment but on the way home I like oh what am I going to do yeah I spoke with my wife and brother Loreno he said told Brother Cale was saying this and he said if he said Saturday it's GNA be Saturday I understand that he was saying that but I don't think so and I I wrote him yesterday I texted him yesterday I said I said brother Caleb I want to ask you something just to be sure he said I know you asked me to speak is it for this Saturday or for next Saturday and some time passed he said where he responded he said let me do the itinerary and I'll get back with you okay when I relaxed a little bit I said okay know I I have some time I had a few other things to do but this morning I got a phone call from Tommy junor and it's not very uh it's not very often that I had received that phone call I didn't answer at the moment but I then I returned his phone call and he told me oh well brother Caleb is asking if you can speak for about 20 minutes this afternoon I said sure that's fine and and obedience we're here to speak I have you down here in a moment let us read the word first second Corinthians 4 verse six and the word of God says this for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word now you may be seated it's not very common that I stand behind here forgive me and be patient with me and we just want that the Lord speak that it may not be me but it may be him before I start I I want to pray Heavenly Father we give you thanks Lord for the life Lord for you have provided a place so we can come and worship you Lord put me to a side and may it be you speaking to your people Lord as a testimony of what you have done through Lord because of ourselves we are nothing Lord but it is simply that you have put your eyes on us we give you thanks then we ask ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the reason why I uh this scripture caught my attention was the word Darkness caught my attention and I know that the word darkness is mentioned various times in the scripture and something that I've had for many years that the what the word Darkness means it's the the lack of lackness of light ignorance or confusion for lack of knowledge and uh I read this because there's a reason behind it I believe that my walk with the Lord was already set before the foundation of the world but came a time where it had to be made manifest and my walk with the Lord it became started some years back to be exact it was 23 years it's it's we say it uh Loosely but I thank the Lord for those years because he has allowed me to know him and to be able to allow me to see him and he has allowed me to serve him and the way I was I encountered myself uh before I I I came here was I was a completely different person and that's why I read the scripture and how it mentions the word Darkness because I was in darkness I was in in confusion and lack and and lack of light but when that light began to shine in me it wasn't of of myself it was that at that time through our brother Fidel which is he is my brother in the flesh um I uh through him I began to feel something inside of me and I have to be sincere I didn't know what it was because at that time I I didn't know the message and we uh you're raised and you grew up in Traditions and I didn't know nothing about the word of God but at that time I was no longer a a little boy of 10 years old I was 23 24 years old but as we have learned as they has been told us but as we have heard that this flesh is going to be real comfortable and I say this because Freddy In the Flesh at that time he didn't need anything he was fine where he was at he had a good job he didn't have the uh luxurious things but he was fine but that was according to the flesh now Freddy in the spirit he needed all things he needed everything because he was empty it was at that time that I felt the necessity to speak with my brother during that time brother Fidel he was already here in the the United States and not to take so much time a few I spoke to him a few times and I would tell him I want to go over there as a young man as a single young man my intentions were for something else but I knew that the Lord had other intentions for me at that moment like as I said I didn't know what it was I would be a liar if I said oh I felt this or I felt that no I simply want to be sincere I was ignorant of those things but in my heart I felt in me that I wanted something different and those who know brother Fidel during at that time brother Fidel he personally worked with uh with brother Tomas and if if there's something that he's got he's always been obedient if I'm gonna move this water bottle he's always going to consult it before he moves it and uh at that time that that's what happened and every phone call I he would tell me wait just a little bit but the the day came he said yes you're you're going to come he said but you know the life that I live it's no longer the life I used to live before here it is something different and that's what captured my attention about brother Fidel and the it was the way that the life that they lived I I I was different I I knew that in them was was something different that's when I began to look at the thing that's and that's at that time is when I began to say I I would say as I want what they have because it has to be a personal revelation it has to be something personal it can't be something that you're just GNA say and that's when I came here to this country and I have to give thanks to this country because this country has opened the doors for me and and I say this because it's been many years have passed and this is the best thing that has happened to in my life because in this throughout this process I began to know the Lord in this process and this time I I found out that the problems that there are no coincidences and to the youth I I believe that you haven't made you don't understand that many things that what happens to as a like as a as a for somebody that's a father and I want to impart to you something personal but I'm going to share it not just not so you can feel sorry for me because we're not here to uh Sor sentiment is really nothing it doesn't do nothing to God and he he knows the heart of each person throughout those 23 years um I'm G look see somebody and see if their parents are here James brother James are your parents here yes go give them a [Applause] hug I'm going to ask you how how did that feel how did how did it feel to be able to hug them to touch them glory to God glory to God because you they're here with you they're close to you in that process [Music] I haven't been able to to touch my mom or to or to hug my mom like like he just did but that sacrifice hasn't been in vain it's been that sacrifice has been worth it for [Applause] you because he paid a price for us but that there is is a promise that God has given me that if I can't hug her here on Earth and but I'll be able to hug her in a place that is [Applause] better because we are fighting for them and that's I simply just want to say that that God has been great and he has been merciful to me and I say that because and I haven't testified and I've and I've been embarrassed of it a year ago I broke my foot and it was something that I thought would never happen but there was a motive and there was a reason why it happened and I'm glad that it happened because I had an accident at home I I fell I practically broke my foot in half and the doctors would tell me well it's it's not going to be the same and the doctors told me that I would have 60 to 70% of a mobility in my foot but I I didn't depend on the doctors I depended on God because he told me that I was going to be fine and now I can say that I am fine the Affliction of the flesh is uh you feel the pain but I have cried out and I have said have confessed I am fine because the word has been spoken and that's where I maintain myself I am a man of few words that is not an impediment to it's not an impediment to give thanks unto God because here we we know each other some by name the sisters of sisters and the brothers with the brother but I remember brother William he preach he preached on the message experiences how are you going to know your brother or your sister or how are you going to know your brother or your sister if you don't know what has happened to them you don't know we see each other here for so so much time and I say for myself to you with respect do we really know each other we we haven't had Fellowship yeah and and I simply just want to say that each and every one of you have in one way or another have helped me you see me here working here in the church but but I I don't do that so I can look good I do it for God and I do it for him because I feel that desire inside of me I want to give you thanks for your your backup your support and if this is has been able to help your walk glory to God that it may not be me that it may be God that where I may be able to help you this evening because great testimonies God has given us our lives and I I believe it's time to to manifest that manifest what God has done for each and every one of us to to continue on the battle as our Pastor said not as a team but as a body because we are a [Music] body and the body is formed of many members and if I am a part of the body that you don't see and hopefully I can be that part to uh to push that you can see that other part so and that's what I wanted to share I forgive me forgive me that forgive me that's all uh it was so short but it was God's time not my time God bless you [Applause] all right put my timer on all right good evening church God bless you amen I'm so happy and blessed to be here tonight so amazed how God works this morning as I was getting ready to go for a run I was putting my shoes on I was praying and thanking God for everything that he has done for me and I was asking him to keep using me and show me what to do to help others and that's when I got got a text message from a friend and he said Marcus I've seen what you know your change and what you've been doing and I wanted to ask you if it's okay if I come over to your church and just as I was going to tell him to come tomorrow for service I get a call from Brother Tommy asking me if I you know if I would be sharing testimony tonight and then I tell my friend you know what we're having service tonight so they're here tonight and I want to welcome [Applause] them so before I get started let me just ask you a question how lucky and blessed are we to have a god of Second Chances and if God has ever given you a second chance can I get an amen sometimes it's even three four five 10 100 chances and he's always there ready to forgive us ready to help us and I want to start with this verse Jeremiah in 2911 under the new version and it reads for I know the plans that I have for you declares the Lord plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you hope in a future God add his Blessing to his word now I want to do a small prayer heavenly father thank you thank you for this beautiful day thank you for my brothers and sisters for my pastor and for the second chance that you've given in my life for fulfilling the promise that you will take our test and turn it into a testimony and be it tonight let the words the right words come out so that anybody sitting here tonight anybody online may find those words of Hope and know that there is a way that you are the way we love you and we thank you and I believe God has has two stories in our life there's two stories in our life there is God's story for our life and then there's the story that the enemy wants to sell you and I stand here tonight to share with you the story that God gave me not the one that the devil was trying to sell me uh I got married at the age of 18 I became a father by 19 and in my 20s I said I worked pretty hard was a hard worker growing up I always seen my parents struggle and I always said I want to have a better future for my family so I left school and started my business and I worked and worked Monday through Sundays and then in my 30s I thought I had made it I was living the life um I was getting to travel uh going to conference opening businesses and it was when the devil came right first he comes to what to steal so he came put me in the wrong groups starting partying and he will whisper in my ear and say hey Marcos you deserve this you've worked so hard in your 20s you didn't party now it's time to party and that one thing led to another thing and I found myself and hurting my loved ones you know I found myself consuming drugs on a daily basis lying to my family lying to my wife and just letting the devil sell me the the dream and what I found out my friends is that the devil makes you believe that he's adding something to your life but what he's really doing is he's subtracting something for your life but you see with God is the opposite with God he he first subtracts he says You must leave this you must get away from this he [Applause] multiplies so you know I was coming back from a trip uh from a conference from Utah and I had a connection flight in Las vasas and it was bad weather so the plane was going to be delayed for 10 hours and my luggage was carrying my my medication I was say medication it's not prescribed medication and at this point I was already consuming six seven pills a day and I was at the at the airport and I I was sitting in the shirt and I started shaking I needed and as the hours went by things started getting worse I started feeling my heart going fast I got out of the share laid in the in the ground and I was shaking in Desperate mode and I was afraid that I was going to die and I pray and I say God please please help me get through this and I got back to El Paso the first thing I went I got my luggage to try and and see the men medicine what came to find it wasn't end there so I said okay I'm GNA go home and I'm gonna call someone I drove from op Paso it was already past midnight I got home my family was already sleep I started making phone calls and everybody that would always Supply they didn't answer or didn't have none so out of a desperate mode I got a Bible from the house laying there in my living room and I remember prior to this I had already SE help I was going through a counselor yo yes and I remember the counselor saying Marcos in order to leave that medication it's not recommended that you do leave it from one day to another you must do it um little by little and as I got the Bible I said it might be impossible for a doctor but I know God can cure me from this and I prayed I fell asleep the following morning I woke up and I felt great and I said man it's a miracle Am I Dreaming or is you know like I feel very good it was Sunday it was Mother's Day I remember that they went by the following morning Monday morning as I was waking up I felt that I couldn't move like if a train had gone over my body and I was laying in bed and I was crying and I started remembering every all the bad things that I have been doing I was depressed my wife was already kicking me out of the house I received the divorce decree uh I was having to close my businesses I was losing money losing hope and I said maybe if you know maybe everything will be solved if I was just what if I died like maybe everything will be solved and I receive a text from my friend from Justin love you he sent me a text inviting me to go to a c plan she wanted to talk to me and I went and our conversation led to him inviting me to church and I remember I was sitting almost where just in sitting right now and I was I was feeling hopeless I was feeling tired I was feeling depressed I was mad at myself and I thought nothing can save me at this point and then there made an alter call I came to the front Pastor Caleb was preaching that day and he asked me what do you want son and I know it wasn't Pastor Caleb and I said I want my life and my family back he said you already got them back amen and that day I was just cried and I and I was praying kept on praying the following weeks they made a call to see if you want to get baptized and give your life to the Lord I came got baptized by Brother Tommy and it's the best decision I've made and you know by then I was already leaving out of my house I continue to come and every time I came I I just learned something new and I found that hope that I needed that day to fight the battle that I was fighting that week and I I and I kept on praying say God take away the people that don't need to be in my my life and put the right people in my life and then I get a message from my cousin Bob Robert he says Marcos I'm gonna go visit you in I'm gonna be visiting in Los Cruses let's get together probably hadn't seen him in a year or so and to be honest I didn't want to see him for the reason because I didn't want to I think as a man we go through this problem I didn't want him to know that I was already living out of my house because as a man I think sometimes it's difficult to show our weakness we always try and portray a strong person and he came and I I just want to say I'm so grateful for him and his wife family because it's been the rock that I need when I most needed help those times where I felt alone he's been there to help me I love you brother and no coincidence but that's not the only angel God sent in my life couple months later I met my brother Omar and it's hard to be sad around this guy even when I'm sad or when I was depressed he would make a joke and change you know made my day and pastor Pastor thank you you you've been that angel in my life as well I remember one of the first advice that I got from Pastor you know I was fighting a lot with my wife and arguments and he gave me a tip he said Marcos maros you must learn how to act instead of reacting that simple uh uh tip right there has been a lifechanging for me because I no longer react to things I act I no longer tell uh tell my God how big are my problems I tell my problems how big is my God and you can learn from anyone in this church man I can go around I remember uh brother Abraham saying um you know doctors are for non-believers the other day I was uh we were in a fellowship we were eating with Omar and David David and David said you know you know there's there's people in life that are raised Christian uh who have a you know a good Christian Life get married follow the the God and then there's the other ones that go through all this tests all these trials all this bad right the world and sometimes God needs those people because it's those people that can go and talk to others that go through the same path and I believe I'm that person um I can share a lot of things I just have 20 minutes I don't want to go by my time the other I it's it's been a battle but the blessings that I've received have prepared me to face the enemy I'm sure this the other night it was last week the middle of the night I was going through a nightmare and I woke up and I was shaking have you ever had those nights where you're still like you even woke up and you're still shaking like you I was feeling some anger and I remember saying oh thank God that was The Nightmare I feel like I wanted to hurt someone and I tried going back to sleep and as I was going to sleep I started hearing a noise in my [Music] window and I said maybe it's a cat or something and then it started getting uh stronger and stronger and I woke up and I said you Satan you're a liar you're the father that invented lies you can no longer do nothing to me because it's no longer I that decide I've given my life to Jesus so if you want to do something you got to deal with him and I went back to sleep and this was a tool that me and Robert were talking about a couple days before and it's been many the other day she shared with me that um brother Jimmie said Jim with God sometimes he will make you come down humble yourself so he can Elevate you amen and I want to share this photos before I finish if I may can put the photos this is a photo that was taken uh last year uh last year when I was on the medication and I saw it the other day and just seeing it show me all the pain that I was going through I want to show you the next photo and this is me now and I put there the two most important days in our lives are the day we are born and the day we find out why and last I want to share this photo with you you know I had already had a vision that I would be sharing a testimony here on stage and in my vision I could see my wife and my children here with me and telling you look God God can restore and I will I was looking I was see my parents in the full aisle of my family and not all of them are here today but tonight I have my brother and my uh stepmom here and I know pretty soon my whole family is gonna be here and let me just tell you before I leave whoever is here you're watching online if you lost hope if you feel like you're losing that everything that you've built is going away that all the odds are against you you should get excited because that's an indication that God is ready to change your life you God bless you God bless you everybody was here we are again thank the Lord first of all I want to thank our pastor for another opportunity I want to thank God for uh this opportunity to show my testimony and if we could stand to our feet to read the word please r we're going to turn to Romans 8 verse 30 moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say then to these things if God be for us who can be against us and let's go to verse 35 who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or P persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword let's go to verse 38 for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present or nor things to come verse 39 nor height nor dep nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord amen let's it be the word of the Lord I know that what we can say here as as people brother Bram says what I say may be wrong but the word of God will never be mistaken that's the truth so I want to share a little bit of of my testimony well I'm 38 years old you may be seated I was like am I speaking too loud I Want to Break My Testimony into two stages the first stage I see it as the stage of fear and the attributes of sin we know that sin is one thing and the attributes are all the actions so I believe that I'm the one that broke the record in all s also in what is fear ever since I was a kid I was carrying my chains I felt fear insecurity fear to be abandoned always threatened all the time even though my father always provided for home as a husband he was not a good husband so I learned all the bad things from him thank God I had a very good mother and I'm blessed for the mother I have truthfully she's not here but I want to tell her that I love her with all my heart they're at the cameras I know I wouldn't be here without her and she's an important part in my life and I truly appreciate her when I was growing up I met my wife she's a great woman beautiful thank God he gave her all the attributes she needed and since the moment I got married I wouldn't be the person I'm now without her [Applause] uh truthfully that part of my life carrying all the chains it hasn't been easy but I believe I know that than thanks to God I'm sure I've been able to break with all those chains I'm still fighting with many of them those negative thoughts but thank the Lord to his grace that I'm here and he gives me another opportunity the second part that's when I moved from Mexico to the United States I got here to this beautiful church with this beautiful family and thank the Lord I was able to get [Music] baptized and as brother Jimmy was uh talking or sharing the other day I I I pass justification sanctification and I'm receiving the baptism of the Holy Spirit I feel it with all my heart everything starts looking different I go to the stores right now where in the Halloween and I don't see it as I used to do it or see it before even the way I dress I start changing it and small details of myself I started changing them and I wouldn't have done that without God Christ in my heart last Sunday when God through our pastor was uh giving us the message that day I felt something different I I surrendered to God and I felt that the Holy Spirit was in me thanks to God thanks to that I could eliminate several negative thoughts when you come in here to become a Christian things are not easy or easier but they become harder or more complicated uh the battle in the mind starts and you have to feed your heart as they see to be able to fight that devil that mentality it is not easy but it's a it's good to feel Joy and the blessing and the love of God again I know there's a lot of things that I have to go through and I still have to learn but truthfully any person that thinks that he is in a bad situation bad position if God could do this for me I'm sure that they he can do that for them as well God is is a good god and he's a God that does not lie he has predestinated us as the word says we just have to surrender I just have to surrender and keep moving forward he's going to reveal everything he has for my life and he will fulfill his promises that's basically it I want to thank my mother my wife my pastor and all the church God bless you [Music] amen would you please stand would you just raise your hands to the Lord and worship [Music] him oh [Music] grand for [Music] for oh the [Applause] in [Music]
