frail and sad or photo he was the favorite of his father therefore a little for little party he was the one that his father didn't mind that everyone knew that he was the favorite and it can only poor duck he told Savion key infidel 42 Papa he got this special coat eldest you're the man the tunica especially that his father made him get soup a little asia but there was jealousy but oh yeah Philips he was sold into slavery we know we know the story goes Cano similarly storia sold into slavery bendito but I said it was close but I want you to know something about the life of Joseph pero quiero que se para hacer que la vie la for st. Joseph was robbed of everything that he had I sell it for a while todo look at the near everything todo imagine something imagine instead you're 17 years old between idiocy siete Anja your brother's

you have nothing to show for neither para mostrar you're a slave who stays soon is clever from being a prince they say the same principle from beings from being somebody they said again he became nobody she was her Nadya everything was stolen from Joseph todo celephais cattalo except for one thing except o una cosa his destiny su destino [Applause] everything was stolen from Joseph except his destiny totally freaky pero a Jose occipital luiseño his destiny was in God's hands who is he no estan las manos de reals we're gonna go back into the book of Genesis 39 I lived a little the Hennessey's capital training and we're gonna see why you almost have it poor King Joseph porque Hussein was the way that he was a da de la moneda couid i will start with 39 to 13th in my made those comments Olmos and the Lord was with Joseph Misawa is Telecom Kofi verse three vessel Tris and his master saw that the Lord was with him if you flunk a hill vais avec une le verse 5 where so simcha and it came to pass from the time that he made him overseer in his house and over all that he had that the Lord blessed the Egyptians house for Joseph's sake and the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the house and in the field yeah Kentucky is the Wonderlic the dueling Cargill is su casa de todo look at in here Wendy who like a Sara Lee heaps you a cow sorry Jose E Levin DC under here y stava Sol de todo lo que tenia a C in casa community Campo verse 21 verse event you know but the Lord was with Joseph pero here wife tower come Jose and showed him mercy he lives in do so mr. decody and gave him favor he lived Yoga Rossi verse 23 the keeper of the purse of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand because the Lord was with him known as he thought in the little cafe like Articuno in this case Tom on Ike we always Jose work here y estaba con Jose so what did you notice can the same thing in all these verses you know Telemachus entitled versus the Lord was with him el Senor estaba con el so he had first of all something evil step Renato to be needin a man that you have something good in Uruguay no but if Joseph pero SI Jose never nunca placed God put so adios in the middle in the middle of his perspective a super speck or in the middle of his problem when millions problemas there will heaven have been only evil that would have come out of this solamente madad o algo Malo here as a little did there would have never been anything good come out of this new career as a little I'll go way no de todo esto the perspective that we have la perspectiva Captain Nemo or that we need bikinis the system is to have God be the center is the her could you say event of the problems that we have in los problemas Captain Nemo because if we look at it porque si lo me Thomas without God team deals it is impossible is impulsively there's Joseph a kiss Tahoe say 17 years old did he associate the onions it would be another 22 years before he saw his
