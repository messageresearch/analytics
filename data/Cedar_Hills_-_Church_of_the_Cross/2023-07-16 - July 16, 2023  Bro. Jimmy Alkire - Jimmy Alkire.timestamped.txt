[32:37] Dios
[32:42] praise the Living God
[32:46] consider it such a privilege to
[32:49] have the chance to give a little bit
[32:51] more of what we started on Wednesday
[32:57] pray that the Lord will bring it in such
[32:59] a way
[33:05] and hold it with everything that
[33:08] sometimes
[33:15] but praise the Lord thank you
[33:21] thank you
[33:23] without you here will be no reason to
[33:26] preach
[33:29] the Lord Jesus will consider a new art
[33:33] subject the groaning creature
[33:39] so I don't mind all
[33:42] right
[33:45] let's open our Bibles to Psalms 38.
[33:53] how many brought your swords this
[33:55] morning
[34:00] Lord
[34:02] All My Desire is before
[34:11] and my groaning is not hidden from
[34:20] lordy in your Jesus
[34:23] and that means oh Lord Alma
[34:28] as the psalmist said unto their
[34:30] inspiration of your Holy Spirit um
[34:42] in our groanings it's not hidden
[34:47] we just thank you Lord for that
[34:51] says we enter into your words
[34:57] we ask it all on the precious name of
[35:00] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[35:09] yes
[35:12] I'm kind of somewhere else already
[35:15] you just pray for me that God will help
[35:18] the Lord
[35:20] I sure can't be nothing without him
[35:25] as we started the other day and we
[35:28] we left off
[35:31] and we were in Romans 8. and let's go
[35:35] back there again amen
[35:42] and we're gonna go back to
[35:46] first
[35:48] night
[35:57] Romans 8 19.
[36:00] woman
[36:02] for the earnest expectation of the
[36:06] future
[36:08] wait for the manifestation
[36:13] is
[36:21] notice in Spanish as we stated the other
[36:23] day in Spanish it says that ardent
[36:26] desire in Spanish
[36:31] that Ardent groaning is
[36:37] Grande
[36:41] that the creation knows
[36:47] this creature knows
[36:51] that without the manifestation of the
[36:55] sons of God is
[36:59] things will never be the way they were
[37:01] in the Garden of Eden
[37:06] this planet Earth that groans also for
[37:10] the manifestation of the sons of God is
[37:15] such a point that one day it will
[37:18] explode from within
[37:22] to cleanse all the impurities
[37:26] all the curse of sins
[37:30] it's groaning for us
[37:57] and you know that word creature there
[38:01] there the original formation is
[38:11] so without this creature being formed
[38:14] first
[38:17] there would never be a creation
[38:22] how many believe that that is being
[38:24] formed on the inside of you
[38:29] by the Holy Spirit foreign
[38:37] praise the Lord Jesus
[38:40] then we went into that word waiting yeah
[38:44] that verse down there says in verse 20 I
[38:47] believe 22 verse or verse
[38:53] it's no it's actually the same verse the
[38:56] creature waits for the manifestation
[38:59] is
[39:02] we're waiting for it
[39:05] but we found out that the Greek word
[39:08] there does not mean just sitting around
[39:11] waiting for something to happen
[39:17] but this creature
[39:20] this expectation is expectativa this
[39:24] Ardent desire is
[39:27] that this creature has
[39:32] makes them expect fully for it to happen
[39:39] it's not that it's waiting
[39:41] the way we think of the word waiting
[39:45] but because that Ardent desire
[39:51] that the other word was
[39:54] intense was an intense anticipation
[40:00] this creature
[40:03] this new birth is once it's born in you
[40:08] if you water that desire
[40:12] if you water that seed that's in your
[40:15] heart
[40:18] that desire has to grow
[40:22] oh my aren't you happy for that this
[40:24] morning
[40:26] you know
[40:28] I would like to go back to the quote we
[40:31] left the other day out of identified
[40:33] with Christo
[40:40] and you remember the scripture we quoted
[40:43] as as we go there is
[40:48] no this is not yeah okay
[40:51] anyway
[40:53] my thought left that's okay
[40:57] identified with Christ
[41:01] I've got it here
[41:04] it's paragraph 75 it says
[41:08] I call it B because there's two parts of
[41:11] the paragraphs
[41:14] but I challenge you tonight
[41:19] identify yourself with Jesus Christ
[41:25] and his death and in his resurrection
[41:30] and see where you'll be at the
[41:34] resurrection
[41:37] for if we suffer with him we shall reign
[41:40] with him
[41:43] God has given us the promise
[41:49] God
[41:51] has given us the promise
[41:55] let's repeat this together too
[41:59] my whole desire
[42:03] is to be like him
[42:09] my God is so good let's go down here to
[42:12] the end of paragraph
[42:15] 775 with Christo
[42:22] the very end of the paragraph is
[42:26] and it's no more than what is right
[42:30] it's no more than our duty to look at
[42:33] these things
[42:36] and to see these desires that we have
[42:43] that God put in us
[42:46] to create in us
[42:50] to make us
[42:52] want to be like him but I said
[42:56] oh my so we see that these desires
[43:01] it makes us want to be like him
[43:05] it's not that he's forcing us to be like
[43:08] him
[43:09] but this desires that he's creating in
[43:12] US
[43:14] it makes us want to be like him
[43:18] we realize that we're not like him
[43:23] talking about this fellow here is
[43:32] just Renegade this guy
[43:37] that I had a sour note there or what
[43:40] is
[43:42] praise the Lord
[43:43] I'm taking a little more time this
[43:45] morning I I just I I got so away from
[43:49] myself this morning at about three
[43:50] o'clock
[43:57] three o'clock in the morning president
[43:59] and I saw myself
[44:03] and I saw certain things happening
[44:06] it wasn't a vision I was actually taken
[44:10] here
[44:11] so I'm having a hard time
[44:15] just trying to keep myself out of the
[44:17] way
[44:20] because this morning
[44:23] at least for me
[44:25] and I believe for many of you
[44:28] we are going into a place we've never
[44:34] how many would like to go foreign
[45:00] the cup says he just finished saying
[45:02] creating in US these desires to make us
[45:04] want to be like him yeah
[45:14] and now if you can see it
[45:19] by faith before the real desire and
[45:24] Strikes
[45:28] wow if you can see it in other words you
[45:31] can't manifest it yet
[45:37] really hasn't taken over yet
[45:42] but if you can see it by revelations
[45:48] before
[45:51] before
[45:52] and I would invite anyone this morning
[45:54] that
[45:55] this is your first time here or you
[45:59] haven't surrendered your life to the
[46:00] Lord and been baptized I would encourage
[46:02] you with this is
[46:07] now if you can see it by faith before
[46:10] the real desire strikes
[46:17] come forward and be identified in him
[46:24] accept him with all your heart accepted
[46:28] so how is he gonna create this desire in
[46:31] us
[46:34] how more or what else can he use to
[46:38] create this desire in us
[46:42] it's his word in
[46:52] in a Libro
[46:55] it's his word
[46:57] and you know as I mentioned Wednesday
[47:01] a statement that our pastor made under
[47:04] the anointing
[47:07] how that coldness was coming in the
[47:10] church
[47:12] you know our enemy he's he's a pro let's
[47:15] throw an Amigos professional man he's
[47:18] got a lot of experience
[47:20] as far as time over 6 000 years
[47:24] before that you can't even count it
[47:26] because he came from eternity
[47:32] so what I saw on the people
[47:35] what I saw in a lot of our young people
[47:38] okay
[47:40] is that you come to certain stages
[47:45] you accept the Lord you get baptized
[47:49] you're just so in love with the Lord
[47:53] here we pray the Holy Ghost descends
[47:58] it feels so incredible
[48:02] how many have felt that way
[48:04] raise your hand you just man you're in
[48:08] cloud nine or you're walking in heaven
[48:10] or whatever you want to call it right
[48:13] you say devil nasty come on big boy
[48:20] you man you're you're strutting along
[48:22] there that's
[48:27] que pasa
[48:30] it goes through a period of time
[48:33] you feel numb is
[48:40] do you think
[48:42] what why do I feel this way did anybody
[48:45] spelled that way
[48:48] like if you were alone
[48:52] or you don't feel his presence like
[48:55] before
[48:59] because as humans we like to feel his
[49:01] presence
[49:04] not just in our souls but when our
[49:08] bodies
[49:13] experiences his presence
[49:16] it makes us feel so secure
[49:24] it's like he's not even there is
[49:31] all you know is there is
[49:37] what happened
[49:39] you know why he's doing that
[49:42] he's getting you into a state where your
[49:45] senses
[49:47] stand
[49:49] up
[49:53] because he has another sense
[49:59] he wants you to be conscious
[50:02] of his presence and every moment of your
[50:06] life
[50:07] and him understanding how we are
[50:11] he knows we love to be able to pick it
[50:15] up with our
[50:16] five energy to the body
[50:20] to receive
[50:22] smell share your taste all of it
[50:27] and as a spiritual being we like we like
[50:30] to to remember that what he did last
[50:33] week
[50:37] we like to reason within ourselves
[50:41] and we say oh I feel so much better
[50:46] why didn't I feel this way before
[50:50] and then our imagination
[50:53] oh we can begin to see ourselves walk on
[50:57] streets of gold in business
[51:01] we loved for these senses to help us
[51:04] pick up the presence of God
[51:12] but God says children
[51:16] where I'm taking you
[51:19] I didn't design these sensors
[51:23] to take you there
[51:26] has to be something else
[51:29] that will take you into a realm with God
[51:34] can't believe that all things are
[51:36] possible
[51:39] are you with me so far
[51:42] because now we're going to go back into
[51:45] eternity
[51:47] brother what are you talking about
[51:49] you're gonna die right here in the
[51:50] Pulpit or what I don't care
[51:54] in the Revelation
[51:56] that's what happened to me at three
[51:58] o'clock in the morning
[52:07] and waiting on the Lord because there's
[52:09] something
[52:10] that's what happens then
[52:16] I just saw I just saw I saw a lot of
[52:19] most of you there is
[52:25] and I saw you gathered around
[52:28] and you had your heads towards heaven
[52:32] and you had your hearts open
[52:34] you had your hands raised to the heavens
[52:38] with one
[52:40] of us you said Lord
[52:45] Jesus in your Jesus
[52:50] this morning up in the office that I
[52:52] could had a hard time staying there you
[52:54] know I don't know if you understand me
[52:56] well just pray for me
[52:59] but there's something going on here
[53:03] now let's go to the scriptures as we
[53:06] begin to see
[53:09] how we were formed
[53:13] and God Indios and the great Eternal
[53:17] Spirits
[53:19] as he changed from being Elohim interest
[53:24] that existed of himself and by himself
[53:31] and he changes to
[53:33] the Lord is
[53:37] my Jehovah's Witnesses
[53:43] they say they're your friends brother
[53:47] because I'm an original Jehovah Witness
[53:50] original
[53:55] now God was not going to be by himself
[53:59] anymore
[54:01] but he didn't just want to produce just
[54:03] anything
[54:07] he wanted to make sure
[54:09] that what came out of him
[54:12] would have the potentials
[54:19] so he could have fellowship with his
[54:21] children
[54:22] so that he could have fellowship with
[54:25] himself
[54:27] with parts of himself
[54:31] he's known Lucifer was there
[54:34] he knew he was watching everything
[54:38] he knew Lucifer was gonna get lifted up
[54:41] in his heart
[54:44] he was so careful to think about us
[54:50] but he wanted us to be when we would
[54:52] come to this earth
[55:00] Lucifer was there thinking he wouldn't
[55:02] get
[55:05] foreign right in front of his nose
[55:08] foreign
[55:34] I'm sure you've got that scripture up
[55:36] there my dear brothers
[55:40] First Corinthians
[55:47] how many brought their Bibles
[55:55] if I got this right
[56:00] no I don't have it right
[56:02] let me see here
[56:05] it's the scripture
[56:08] maybe I'm not supposed to read that one
[56:12] oh before I forget and I'm all ready for
[56:15] Kitty this is
[56:19] our condolences to sister birthday
[56:23] on the passing of brother Augustine yeah
[56:30] God would give them Comfort because they
[56:32] say
[56:33] Consuelo and consolation
[56:39] praise the Lord Jesus Christ well I must
[56:42] have marked that scripture down wrong
[56:44] maybe that's why they're not putting it
[56:46] up he says
[56:47] so let's go to our next scripture amen
[56:54] praise the Lord
[56:56] we love the Lord God
[57:03] amen
[57:05] here we go
[57:09] for then what they have not ceased to be
[57:12] offered
[57:18] but then they would they they not have
[57:22] been ceased to be offered
[57:24] had not ceased to be an offered man
[57:28] because the worshipers once purged
[57:33] foreign
[58:07] are you all happy conscious
[58:14] having mental faculties not told by
[58:18] Sleep
[58:24] also means to be awake the mean
[58:27] significance
[58:29] aware of something within oneself
[58:36] but notice the word it uses in Hebrews
[58:39] 10 too
[58:42] is not the word conscience as we just
[58:46] read it's the word
[58:48] conscience with as the word science in
[58:51] it
[58:54] and we're not talking about science but
[58:57] there's there's a little difference in
[58:58] these words but two words yeah the
[59:02] meaning of these two words
[59:04] were brought together
[59:07] by the interpretation that God gave
[59:10] through his Prophet
[59:14] this sense of Consciousness is
[59:23] of moral goodness or blameworthiness of
[59:27] One's Own conduct or intentions
[59:42] that you don't feel unworthy
[59:46] of things that you did
[59:48] your conduct or even the intentions you
[59:51] had of things that you never did
[59:53] [Music]
[59:55] if your Purge
[59:57] you would have no conscience of these
[1:00:00] things
[1:00:01] and at the same time
[1:00:04] you're conscience the first word
[1:00:07] then you will be come to a point where
[1:00:10] you're no longer dull yeah
[1:00:14] you will not be slow to peace
[1:00:17] you will not be slow
[1:00:21] you will be conscious
[1:00:24] you say what do you go into this this is
[1:00:27] an instrument
[1:00:29] if you have no desire for something
[1:00:34] how would you be conscious
[1:00:40] you're getting there
[1:00:43] if you approach from it you no longer
[1:00:45] the prophet says that means they're that
[1:00:47] conscience in Hebrews 10 means you would
[1:00:49] have no longer have a desire for the
[1:00:52] things of the world
[1:00:57] but when you go into the meaning of the
[1:01:00] words
[1:01:01] it's talking about having a sense of
[1:01:05] morally being right
[1:01:11] do you no longer feel guilty about
[1:01:13] anything
[1:01:16] you're worthy from I'll blame there's no
[1:01:19] blame that they can put on you
[1:01:22] because your conscience has been cleaned
[1:01:26] but the prophet says that means you no
[1:01:30] longer would have that desire for sin
[1:01:33] significance
[1:01:35] amen now the scripture came to me today
[1:01:38] I gave wrong first John two Primera de
[1:01:41] cuandos amen
[1:01:43] [Music]
[1:01:45] praise the Lord
[1:01:47] are you happy
[1:01:49] we're going to get into this
[1:01:52] and we're going to find out
[1:01:54] whether we were conscience is
[1:02:01] when we were in God
[1:02:05] may sound like Greek To You Right he
[1:02:08] says
[1:02:12] we're gonna find out
[1:02:15] the way God felt about us
[1:02:22] as he was forming us inside of himself
[1:02:28] amen amen love not the world either the
[1:02:33] things that are in the world if any man
[1:02:34] loved the world or the the love of the
[1:02:38] father is not in him
[1:02:39] he said
[1:02:45] for all that is in the world
[1:02:48] just say that all together
[1:02:51] for all that is in the world
[1:02:56] what does a-l-l mean
[1:02:59] is all the things of the world
[1:03:02] no matter how nice it looks to you
[1:03:07] if it's a part of this Fallen World
[1:03:10] System
[1:03:12] whether it be politics yes
[1:03:16] because we're not here just to be
[1:03:19] religious
[1:03:20] we're not just here to make our
[1:03:23] conscience feel better so that we we can
[1:03:25] go out of here feeling happier
[1:03:28] we want to please
[1:03:32] we want to walk with him
[1:03:38] is the religion that we cover ourselves
[1:03:40] with religion
[1:03:43] all that is in the world
[1:03:46] the lust of the flesh
[1:03:49] the lust of the eyes
[1:03:52] two things are physical
[1:03:57] and what does it produce
[1:03:59] the pride of life
[1:04:02] you're so proud of what you achieved and
[1:04:06] what you think you are okay
[1:04:11] it says it is
[1:04:18] and the world passeth away
[1:04:21] and the last thereof is but he that
[1:04:25] doeth
[1:04:26] he that continues to
[1:04:31] doeth the will of God
[1:04:35] forever
[1:04:37] it means all these things
[1:04:40] that surround us that our penetrated our
[1:04:45] bodies and our spirits
[1:04:48] that we've been so accustomed to because
[1:04:50] we were born in sinus
[1:04:54] we were formed in iniquity
[1:04:57] and we came into this world with a lying
[1:05:00] nature
[1:05:03] that's all we've ever known as the human
[1:05:05] all of our lives
[1:05:11] do you want to stay there
[1:05:13] give me the quote out of the questions
[1:05:15] and answers on Genesis
[1:05:21] amen
[1:05:22] amen
[1:05:24] praise the Lord
[1:05:27] now we're going to find out if we were
[1:05:30] conscious Indios
[1:05:37] brother you're crazy
[1:05:39] as they always say that's nothing
[1:05:44] when God created me William Branham
[1:05:48] and you can put your name there
[1:05:51] he's the son of God just like you and me
[1:05:54] we had a right to put his name there
[1:05:58] I was before the foundation of the world
[1:06:04] he made my my being at least said my
[1:06:08] spirit my Espiritu I wasn't conscious of
[1:06:13] anything
[1:06:15] as far as I know of yourself watch the
[1:06:20] way he's saying this he goes I wasn't
[1:06:23] he's talking here and now he's in flesh
[1:06:27] for the foundation of the world
[1:06:29] and now as the man is saying I was not
[1:06:33] conscious of anything yeah
[1:06:39] but I was there
[1:06:43] believe you're getting it are you
[1:06:46] getting it now just a minute Jesus told
[1:06:50] the disciples that he knew them before
[1:06:52] the foundation of the world
[1:06:56] and Paul said that here he chose us in
[1:06:59] him before the foundation of the world
[1:07:05] there was some part of me
[1:07:10] Neville or the rest of you all here
[1:07:17] was there some part of you
[1:07:21] there I.E before the world began
[1:07:25] and I don't want to read the last part
[1:07:28] of this quote
[1:07:30] because it's going to take me somewhere
[1:07:32] else
[1:07:34] so if brother brennam wasn't conscience
[1:07:37] as far as he knew because he's he's
[1:07:39] looking back to eternally from a time
[1:07:42] space from a body of cells
[1:07:49] he was in conscience
[1:07:52] remember
[1:07:54] conscience and Consciousness
[1:07:57] are tied to the desire is
[1:08:01] so it couldn't be a desire of William
[1:08:04] Branham nope
[1:08:06] it couldn't be your desire through the
[1:08:09] same it wasn't your conscience there no
[1:08:11] question he was conscience
[1:08:15] but you were inside of him
[1:08:19] his conscience is
[1:08:25] I'll leave that there just for a minute
[1:08:31] foreign
[1:09:09] so now because we're seeing a few
[1:09:11] thousand years before we came to earth
[1:09:15] oh my goodness right are you happy oh no
[1:09:19] no you're going to understand yourself
[1:09:21] better now
[1:09:23] if you can see yourself a couple of
[1:09:26] thousand years before you came to Earth
[1:09:32] Jesus in God's mind died for the sins of
[1:09:35] the world Jesus
[1:09:41] and your name was put on The Book of
[1:09:44] Life
[1:09:47] [Applause]
[1:09:58] he wrote Jesus's name there first
[1:10:04] Jesus name was written in the book
[1:10:08] was written
[1:10:12] hallelujah oh glory to God glorious
[1:10:16] blessed be the name senor
[1:10:21] ah I'm starting to feel a little bit
[1:10:23] better
[1:10:26] that's the Bible truth it is
[1:10:29] see your name was ordained of God
[1:10:32] and placed in the book of life
[1:10:35] before the foundation of the world
[1:10:41] you were there in his attributes
[1:10:45] and if I go there
[1:10:47] well
[1:10:49] like time will be gone I won't even get
[1:10:51] work what is an attribute
[1:10:57] it's a characteristics characteristic
[1:11:00] it's a nature
[1:11:03] of what he is
[1:11:22] you've always been that way
[1:11:24] once we were redeemed
[1:11:27] and washed in the Precious Blood of the
[1:11:30] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:11:35] amen let's go to the next paragraph
[1:11:42] and when that
[1:11:44] has gone in
[1:11:48] the egg and you become a part of your
[1:11:50] father is
[1:11:53] and your mother is a part of your father
[1:11:56] is Glory
[1:12:01] Gloria that lets all denomination out is
[1:12:05] all together in other words just not a
[1:12:08] system of man
[1:12:11] there's not just four walls the church
[1:12:15] they can save you that could give you
[1:12:18] the new birth that can reveal this to
[1:12:21] you
[1:12:23] certainly does God in all the only place
[1:12:30] the next
[1:12:33] identity
[1:12:36] it doesn't seem like we're in the right
[1:12:38] way
[1:12:39] can we go to the next paragraph
[1:12:44] I got it this part this is the part I
[1:12:46] got to get you to
[1:12:47] you got it
[1:13:03] well I don't see the paragraph that I
[1:13:06] won
[1:13:10] he says and listen
[1:13:14] when you were in him
[1:13:17] he says
[1:13:18] you don't remember them
[1:13:21] it's been one of those paragraphs
[1:13:24] no he goes because you were just a part
[1:13:27] of his life
[1:13:31] could say foreign
[1:13:58] you are not an independent being said in
[1:14:02] the independiente and you were conscious
[1:14:05] he was the one
[1:14:09] that was conscious of you
[1:14:13] while you were in him
[1:14:17] no wonder then when we came to Earth
[1:14:21] to live in a body of sins
[1:14:25] something on the inside
[1:14:48] that you
[1:14:51] know
[1:14:52] when we saw we were last
[1:14:55] perdidos
[1:15:24] he saw everything
[1:15:26] that you would ever
[1:15:35] and he
[1:15:36] he saw you saved
[1:15:40] that's when the lamb came out in his
[1:15:42] mind
[1:15:44] slain from the foundation of the world
[1:15:52] it would have never been manifested on
[1:15:55] Earth
[1:16:19] knowing the that you would be here today
[1:16:24] that I would be
[1:16:26] here we are not just here by chance
[1:16:30] we are here by the predestinated
[1:16:35] his Consciousness
[1:16:38] David said All My Desire is before you
[1:16:41] the video told us
[1:16:45] how many happy grannies
[1:16:51] and all my brownies
[1:16:54] they are not hidden from you
[1:16:56] how could they hide from God
[1:17:07] we could feel for you
[1:17:10] he was a high
[1:17:16] priests
[1:17:21] it must be his desire in us
[1:17:25] if you can see this desire
[1:17:29] that is creating in us right now
[1:17:35] at 11 13.
[1:17:38] this day esteria of July the Julio the
[1:17:43] 16th yes he says 2023. he is creating
[1:17:48] this in US
[1:17:52] continue
[1:17:54] until he sees the products
[1:18:00] that we will be choice in our Salvation
[1:18:07] if we hadn't even come to Earth yet
[1:18:12] perdonado
[1:18:22] before we everything
[1:18:26] in his Minds
[1:18:28] he would not
[1:18:30] failure and no matter what Lucifer would
[1:18:33] do is
[1:18:34] go there because I'll go back to the
[1:18:36] serpent again
[1:18:42] foreign
[1:19:25] that was you and I heard the truth
[1:19:32] we wouldn't understand it all
[1:19:34] but we would believe
[1:19:38] we would just believe it
[1:19:41] no matter what we've gone through no
[1:19:44] important
[1:19:45] when he saw that of us
[1:19:48] that increased his face
[1:19:56] he spoke about you and me
[1:20:03] it just said you know what Escape
[1:20:06] my faith is Justified in these people
[1:20:10] my faith is Justified
[1:20:12] because
[1:20:14] now they're pulling
[1:20:18] my thoughts
[1:20:20] and they're making them live
[1:20:22] We are Becoming blessed it's no longer
[1:20:27] just a thought
[1:20:28] in the back part of God's mind
[1:20:31] see them rejoicing
[1:20:35] in Las Cruces Tabernacles
[1:20:38] in Cedar Hills Church at the cross Cedar
[1:20:41] Hills Church
[1:20:49] and they are forgiven yes glory to God
[1:20:54] glorious
[1:20:55] and what's the problem with you and me
[1:21:00] we can't forgive ourselves
[1:21:07] that's where our complexes come from
[1:21:12] we know the Lord forgive us
[1:21:15] but we're constantly
[1:21:19] getting on our own case mismos
[1:21:23] oh and I've got chopped good on this one
[1:21:25] okay
[1:21:30] thank God you
[1:21:32] Godly men like brother tell me I said
[1:21:35] yes
[1:21:47] don't degrade yourself
[1:22:16] that intense
[1:22:18] expectations
[1:22:21] it can't hold you back anymore
[1:22:24] even when you want to hold yourself
[1:22:28] is there something in you that explodes
[1:22:33] the power of the Living God
[1:22:42] you can see the fall
[1:22:44] whatever it hurt him so deeply
[1:22:47] fundamentally
[1:22:51] even the separation he would feel unless
[1:22:55] to lose contact with us
[1:23:10] accessible satisfaction that is
[1:23:27] he will lose a part of himself
[1:24:03] now we're inside of the spirit of God
[1:24:08] stealing what he felt
[1:24:11] he was separated from us
[1:24:15] now as we come back into the presence of
[1:24:18] the Living God Redemption
[1:24:22] is
[1:24:34] the expectations
[1:24:36] of this creature that was still in God
[1:24:42] now it's in you and me
[1:24:48] I was with you before
[1:24:51] Jesus said father glorify me he is
[1:25:10] that we were a being yet it's not that
[1:25:13] we all were a being yeah
[1:25:17] but we were part of your life foreign
[1:25:29] real
[1:25:41] oh my
[1:25:43] God
[1:26:01] but now but I would always
[1:26:04] amen amen
[1:26:07] and that was that's what makes you feel
[1:26:08] bad it is look what makes you feel bad
[1:26:13] when you disobey him
[1:26:19] or if I let some
[1:26:21] body
[1:26:30] and I started looking at their mistakes
[1:26:37] I don't want nothing to do with
[1:26:42] us now that's not me that thought but
[1:26:44] this book was
[1:26:46] Sometimes some others feel that way oh
[1:26:49] yeah
