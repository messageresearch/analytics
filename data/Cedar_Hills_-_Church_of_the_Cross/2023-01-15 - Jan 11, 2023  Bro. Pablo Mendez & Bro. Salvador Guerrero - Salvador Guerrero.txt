congregations and I also give thanks to brother Caleb for his confidence we didn't come to be seen we came to speak of him and share what God has given to each and every one of us I believe in that in this place there's better preachers but I didn't come uh with confidence in myself I came with confidence in the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is the one that speaks and the man is just the instrument before we enter into his word I would like to speak with the author of the word let's bow our heads beloved and good Heavenly Father gracias we give you thanks for the opportunity to be here recognizing that your presence is in this place and it's because of all of your children we're going to open your word and we ask you Lord that the man would be taken away from the scene and the Holy Spirit would take control of all things the Holy Spirit has called us and fills our hearts that when we leave this place we live like those who went to Emmaus that said did not our hearts burn within us as he spoke to us because you have opened all scriptures let it be today in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen I would like for you to follow me in the book of Acts chapter 20 and verse 24. the team that we'd like to speak on this afternoon is goso is joy um knowing that we're going to start a week of services I believe that that's what we need we need to start it with joy amen amen Acts 20 24. foreign but none of these things move me what is it that doesn't that moves me nothing moves me estimo precious neither count I my life as dear unto myself so that I might finish my course with joy and the ministry which I have received of the Lord you can you may be seated the scripture it's speaking to us clearly there's there's there's nothing that that besets us nada nothing the the murmurings they don't beset us not we do nothing besides us unless I finish my my road with joy until the last breath that I have in my body that's that that Joy will make until my my body is is it's all dissolved your own I will have enjoy until then brother Branham Fred Bosworth speaks of his friend Fred Bosworth Elementary and brother Fred Bosworth he was an elder yes he was at the point of dying brother Brandon went and visited him and he said brother Fred do you believe that you'll recover Inferno well the Fred said I'm not even sick I'm going to return back home amen amen what a beautiful declaration many times we have the problem and we forget to have joy amen all right I want to read another scripture the the book of Nehemiah we're going to go to chapter eight universities and verse 10. this is and it says like this is then he said unto them go your way eat the fat and drink the sweet and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared for this day is Holy unto our Lord neither be sorry for the joy of the Lord is your strength amen when people go to watch football they're they're joyous I don't see him sad this is from the time that they're ready to enter the stadium they're dressed in their colors some some people take tambourines and it doesn't matter that people tell them that they're crazy they paint their face with different colors even before the game starts they already have joy out there amen and when they entered the stadium there's a spirit in the stadium and I don't see anybody sad before it starts they're already happy amen now I ask you if they is are happy about a game of football Cristiano how much more the Christians that should be joyous for yourself because the Lord paid the price how much more joy should be in each Christian amen amen Blessed Be Our Lord Jesus Christ let me tell you something there's a strategy that the devil has El Diablo Siempre the devil always the first thing that he does with the Christian is to Rob your joy because the devil knows that the that the life for the force is in the joy amen the strength Cristiano and the devil sees the Christian and he puts his foot on him amen and then he loses his side and he gets to church and he stays in church with a problem that was outside he loses it in the seat amen when we were coming crossing over here we had problems crossing over yes and and me and my family were a little bit uh disturbed no no no no no no no no no no no no no no and I said no no don't don't worry this is all that the devil has the devil wanted to take our job and get us all preoccupied because the Lord has something greater for us amen amen and if the Christian always does this like the scriptures Nothing Else Matters amen Nothing's Gonna Move Me amen I will finish my word my road with joy blessed be that Lord Jesus then we see that the devil is always trying to rob our Joy El Cristiano Christian should be strengthening himself amen amen in the physical when one wants to to strengthen himself and he puts on more weight not if there's no pain there is no gain amen amen or you wanna you wanna come to the church and keep on lifting five pounds [Applause] you got to lift more weight to be stronger the natural types of spiritual amen the Lord is preparing us for a war [Applause] and we have to be ready when the Christian is not strong then you're not going to go to church how come you're not going to go to church it's because the mosquito bit me it doesn't matter that there's problems if no one in the church wants to go I want to go if no one wants to sing then I will sing to the Lord no one wants to worship then I Will Worship the Lord odia Iglesia how come you didn't go to church because I fought with my wife and let the Lord fix you and your wife and then afterwards how come the church is so cold because we haven't resisted the trial amen here I believe there's brothers that have experience in the military or the Army how do they treat you in the Army Brothers amen amen they don't ask permission amen amen I need a volunteer amen amen and all the ones that are on the line they take a step forward and they said I'll do it Iglesia and this is sometimes in the church we need volunteers and then they start to look this person or that person is we're in a spiritual war amen amen we need to resist the training is hard man Amen brother Branham says that he had a trainer and the trainer would hit him very hard and brother Brown would tell the trainer you don't have to be so hard Billy cuando Tu Estes and he told him Billy when you're there in the boxing ring you're gonna thank me amen because there's going to be times that you're going to be by yourself and you have to resist it's better that you lose because your opponent is that much better than you that then if you lose because you got tired cancer I can take it there's people that get tired because they don't have the strength the devil stole their Joy amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the Bible there's a story that we all know the story of Samson chapter 16 in the Book of Judges we all know that Samson was a strong man killed thousands of men men he tore the doors off the Philistines and many things that the Bible says the example of Samson is for us Sansone Samson means like the sun and he married a woman named Delilah that means weakness a tremendous is something strong when the sun is at its highest point its strongest point you can't look at it if you look at it and you stay looking at it you'll go blind and there's there's many examples for teachings uh Cristiano how come a Believer can't marry an unbeliever itambien that are going to take them and pull them into the world amen amen and if someone says I mean that won't happen to me rather be careful in the few minutes that I have left I want to share something with you uh I'm not behind the pulpit because I'm someone or because I deserve it only because of the grace of God when I was younger or um or I'm going to say it like this I had the privilege to to grow up and be born in a in a Christian Church yes and that Christian Church was of the message in Mexico one of the churches Pioneer churches uh there in Mexico I I grew up and I grew up to be the president of the young people there in in Juarez and I'm going to say this with a lot of Shame I'm very ashamed of this and I share it because I I believe that it will will help somebody foreign I believe that that was all there was but I I lacked something I I lack being born again I lacked death I I hadn't died the Bible says fool don't you know that if the seed doesn't fall into the ground and die Sola queda it abideth alone it brings forth much fruit and those is then I I I didn't die and I started problems in the church and as a young person I started to lose my strength I started to lose my joy amen amen you know how things start in the church and and a lot of people are affected by it and I was not strong this is the scripture says in Psalm 16 and supresencia in his in his presence there's fullness of joy but when you leave his presence you start to lose Joy amen amen and that happened to me I started to lose the joy Iglesia and I would come to church and I didn't feel anything in my heart and I started moving one seat back and one more back until I got all the way to the chair there's right by the exit door in the regret and one day I didn't come back the Bible teaches us with Samson a es that he revealed to Delilah The Secret of his strength and when she knew the secret of his strength she cut his hair she cut his Joy Le cortos she cut his strength right amen says and then the enemy took control s they took out his eyes and they had them in Chains when the devil imprisoned me he took my strength Olo sojos he took my eyes I couldn't see him I couldn't see his miracles and he put me in Chains that's a terrible situation Brothers and I feel ashamed pero esto is but this is so that my life and my experience can be a footstep to you amen amen and that you can grow the Lord and his grace one one day remembered me you know something Brothers morir death is something that that's going to happen when you're alone it's an event where you alone are gonna die if you tell the brother we're going to go to the movie and I said yes we're going to go you say we're gonna go to football yes we're going to go but if you say brother let's go die all right now you're gonna die alone the Lord Jesus Christ even his own disciples they didn't stay with him amen and he was alone even one that said Lord I'll follow you denied him three times amen amen it's a it's a process it's an alone it's a lonely process and when you're there I remember that the Lord remembered me and I was totally alone uh I was in a hotel room far from home far from Mom and Dad for 10 years I left the church e is all the time that I would would leave on a trip I would prepare my suitcase Madre and my mom at night she would get my Bible and she'd put it in my suitcase and every time I would get to my destination I'd open my suitcase and I would see my Bible but I didn't open it for 10 years until one day the Lord touched my heart Heal Me knocked on my heart and I didn't know yesterday until one day I said Lord what is it that you want and I went and I knew the Bible was in the suitcase and I went and I took it out and I started flipping through it and I said Lord what is it that you want from me and in the middle of the Bible I found a letter and it was a letter that had been written by my mother the Holy Spirit inspired my mom to give me the message that I needed that message stayed for 10 years in my Bible but the day that I read it it did it did something in my heart and I and I couldn't go no more I was very far from home Australia I was in Melbourne Australia papa no no father no Mama no mother no Nadia nobody I was completely by myself and there I began to cry like I'd never cried before and the Lord forgave me and I said Lord one more chance Lord all I ask is that you let me come into the last last few and let me just hear and the grace of God was so abundant over me Lord continues to forgive sins I didn't know what Grace was I didn't do anything God did everything and he loved me brother when the troubles come no permitas don't permit your joy to be taken foreign because when you make a mistake you feel like you're you're like your strength is taken you feel like your joy is here but that's why David would say return unto me the joy of yourself of my salvation if someone needs Joy the Lord can bring it back to you but you have to enter into his book because in his presence there is a completeness and a fullness of joy God bless you brother foreign and as you open to your Bibles I want to thank uh or my brother and our my friend brother Caleb foreign for this opportunity that he gives me to be here in this place is [Music] I'm happy to see each and every one of you some that I've known for many years the Bible says here in Saint John 3 Verse 6 carne carne is that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit do we see two things there is we heard a few moments ago how that each and every one of us that when we come to the presence of God we have to have a beginning and an after and the the phrase I died it is written in in past time it marks a beginning at the end in time in Romans because clearly at the end of the verse because sin dwelleth in me yes in Psalms 51. my mother conceived me and in and wickedness now and that is the reason why I have to get closer to that death First Corinthians 15. Bible Purity says flesh and blood does not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven in Galatians says that flesh and blood is something that is contrary to the spirit and we heard it a few moments we are in a fight but the fight isn't with the brothers because the flesh yeah every day there is something has to die that is something very important it doesn't take the filter the flesh that filthiness is still there it's until you want them to be there nobody else is going to to uh take him away from you the the Lord Jesus Christ told Nicodemus you have to be born again born again you must be born again it's not going to be giveness you have to do it [Music] I want to show here a picture this picture here Lois Drew this with this pen is on the Whiteboard and he drew two human hearts you know possibly you've seen it for a long time but in one heart he drew a serpent it is the same thing that the Apostle Paul and that serpent Vida is his his life is there there it is his habitations oh and he's very comfortable oh he's very happy because he has a very delicious the person technology it's very comfortable it's growing oh it's feeding itself on delicious things but here there is also another house and this one here is one of those two conditions let us analyze ourselves because our brother said is the first thing and the joy is of course it's it's something that's pulling you to go forward and that is the first thing that the devil wants to remove the first thing he wants to remove from you and I is happening and where did you begin to build the paganism because the Apostle Paul says that I want to do good they don't know but I can't because this flesh does it per minute so then what must I do it's time to take out the story and begin to kill to begin to annihilate oh it is you can you believe it and here it is here he's got a life and he's very happy you think he's going to want to come out Romans chapter 8 says foreign or to be carnally minded as death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the current because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be Who Wants to Be an enemy of God raise your hand Who Wants to Be an enemy of God but I want to raise my hand because I want to be a friend of God you want to be a friend of God no there is what is born of the flesh is the there is the desire of the flesh the desire of the flesh is the enmity against God so then what must I do think okay I have to eliminate someone has to be eliminated you can't have both together I gotta take out the sword and begin to eliminate that this is something easy the first thing that happened that the heart stops it starts the blood stops circulating circulation without the circulation of blood the body the temperature begins so then the body has no longer has a temperature the skin begins to change he [Applause] his muscles began to get stood these muscles began to get stiff what happened brother oh you were walking fine you were the one that would invite me now what's going on who impregnated you were walking fine but now something happened to you you begin to hear things you shouldn't have been hearing you begin you begin to leave you begin to you were converted you were converted to a prize of Satan you're pale Frio called doodle hard stiff what needs to happen Colossians 3 5. I said Cinco can you put on the screen here foreign Therefore your members which are upon the Earth fornication uncleanness coma comma uh uh uh appeared means to stop it means a space it's so that you can reflect on it what has to die in me sometimes it has to be me I wanna I want the Flesh in him today but I have to have the the flesh to die in me that was my example he can see a greater light you can see a change not with words because words this world is is tired of words it is tired of words the question is how are you going to kill it when you have a mascot the first thing that you must do you're going to kill him the way the kill the the matter do you want them too there's going to be some resistance if you stop giving them food if you were to uh if you were feeding them with a lot of social media however you are feeding him only you and God knows nobody else because who knows I can't even see my wife so then I had to analyze how am I going to kill him I have to [Applause] [Applause] the prophet says [Applause] [Applause] seven times Padre which father is his children walk is it again what is it that you want in your life Castle this is Brother Branham says the prophet says in the uh let us escaping from pressure betting off the pressure we died yo Mori I died I was buried and it's not something that is easy but that's right there is where you separate the spirit the flesh gets buried no we no longer have the desires but now we must resurrect in the spirit and the spirit gives life pass peace these things there's no law against them now let me tell you another thing that death does it takes you a lot of time but it's got no more strength foreign Glory man Hallelujah evidence in Hebrews chapter 5 preached in September December 8 1957. when that changed which is called a New Birth has happened you don't have to do nothing to prove it your life is going to prove it the the way the way that you walk love is following you the peace is oh did you see the brother I don't know what's the matter with them I don't know what's going on with them but there's something I love to be with him oh there's such a piece oh there's a real love in trabajo use not without work nothing yeah it's not that he doesn't have a job I thought he had a lot of problems what's going on with him oh he should be down on the ground why is he even singing we're killing because he has found contrados he has found that line that happens to the human being that he has he has never lost foreign foreign but he chose the correct decision that your will be done oh what a crucial hour even to the point where the blood and the water separated he died more in Gethsemane than on the cross and here he is standing against with this great suffering the the sin of every person that one time he should die the innocent the innocent had to become sinful sin the gifts I returned to him [Music] how many years ago can you say you died the most shameful for me for me that I haven't died yesterday and that I am still well with the with the desires and I want to say this and I'm gonna finish this small church this small bride if she can only see Justin beyond the turn of time where there's no Affliction you want to change it for nothing exchange it for nothing of this world this world This World the Flesh that is it's an experience I want to be in that condition and joy begins to return it'll be about your head let us pray we're going to turn the service over he would take control this evening the holy spirit is here he is here to Comfort is here to liberate it's here to forgive he doesn't look at how you come whatever you did you did it but that was the last time make a commitment and tell him I died so that you can live so that you can change from time to Eternity you always been here God bless you [Applause] [Music] [Music] again [Music] oh that is [Music] the Lord is here to help you right now again [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
