[2:10] jesse
[2:22] is good
[2:43] is
[3:07] good evening i want to start this
[3:11] it is a privilege and an honor
[3:14] it should be like your note
[3:16] this evening
[3:20] of jesus christ
[3:25] we are
[3:27] hoping that we can finish chapter four
[3:29] tonight is
[3:54] open your bibles
[3:56] vivid
[3:57] and i want to say hello to everybody
[4:00] that's online whatever you are god bless
[4:02] you
[4:04] via internet
[4:09] hebrews 4
[4:11] verse 7.
[4:27] he again picks a certain day today
[4:30] saying through david after so long a
[4:33] time
[4:33] just as has been said before today if
[4:38] you hear his voice do not harm your
[4:40] heart
[4:54] hebrews 3 7.
[5:02] therefore justice the holy spirit says
[5:04] today if you hear his voice do not harm
[5:08] your heart is when they provoke me
[5:20] provocation
[5:33] said today
[5:34] if you hear his voice do not harm
[5:48] so you might say
[5:49] why do they keep repeating the same
[5:51] scripture
[5:56] we
[5:57] read it three times here
[6:04] first god spoken this wise
[6:09] then he spoke of the law
[6:14] and the third time
[6:17] she says again he limited
[6:21] a day
[6:25] so something happened here
[6:30] i don't think they have
[6:32] the
[6:33] definition of limit
[6:46] limit
[6:49] because he said he limited a certain day
[6:55] limit means a border
[6:58] limit
[7:00] a point
[7:08] [Music]
[7:12] in other words something that is
[7:14] forbidden
[7:18] to go any further
[7:22] so the third time that he said
[7:26] he limited another day
[7:55] if you don't mind it doesn't
[8:03] i passed through something
[8:06] let me say something to relax you
[8:09] silly
[8:12] when i was stationed in alaska in fort
[8:15] wayne right
[8:17] on fort wayne in alaska
[8:20] in uh is in
[8:22] banks alaska and fairbanks alaska
[8:26] so we went on maneuvers
[8:33] we went for about 10 days
[8:37] the weather was between 40 and 50 below
[8:40] zero era
[8:44] after we were through with the maneuver
[8:49] exploracion they told us take down your
[8:51] arctic tent because they're sending the
[8:54] two and a half trucks
[8:56] ton trucks to to pick you up
[9:06] that's that's the army hurry up and wait
[9:12] so we stayed almost close to two hours
[9:15] waiting for the trucks
[9:19] right in the open
[9:22] and it was so cold
[9:25] oh i mean
[9:27] you would just walk back and forth
[9:29] waiting for the truck
[9:34] from
[9:48] a
[10:16] that
[10:30] here a key
[10:33] here i was a kiss about you you won't
[10:35] believe it
[10:37] in their instant
[10:39] instant my bodyguard warmed up
[10:43] i felt a worm coming
[10:58] [Music]
[11:11] what you did yesterday
[11:53] and one of them started talking bad
[11:56] about jesus
[12:00] but the other one
[12:05] we are paying for the sins that we did
[12:13] [Music]
[12:23] jesus didn't say tomorrow
[12:25] jesus
[12:27] today because
[12:30] you will be with me
[12:34] we're always looking back
[12:57] [Music]
[13:00] you might be killed by a heart attack or
[13:03] a car crash out there
[13:07] accidentally the automobile he lived
[13:10] [Music]
[13:12] he forbaded to go any further
[13:17] so today
[13:30] i already took the kid glass away from
[13:42] because paul was an authority of the law
[13:44] of the old testament
[14:13] i'm used to hearing my scripture here
[14:16] but
[14:17] something happened
[14:21] so there it is brother he doesn't have
[14:23] it here but it's up there okay thank you
[14:28] for he is our god and we are the people
[14:32] of his pastor and the shift of his
[14:35] hand today if you will hear his voice
[15:47] therefore the people did child with
[15:49] moses and said give us water that we may
[15:52] drink and moses said unto them i child
[15:56] may we wherefore do you tempt the lord
[16:10] and the people thirsted therefore for
[16:12] water and later the people murmured
[16:15] against moses and said therefore is this
[16:17] that thou hast
[16:19] take us brought us out of egypt to kill
[16:22] us and our children and our cattle with
[16:24] thirst
[16:37] and moses cried unto the lord saying
[16:39] what shall we do unto these people they
[16:42] all
[16:43] almost told me
[16:46] this
[16:52] and the lord said unto moses go on
[16:54] before the people and take with you the
[16:56] elders of israel and thy rod for with
[16:59] those motives of the river take it in
[17:03] thine hands
[17:15] behold i will stand before thee upon the
[17:18] rock in horeb and thou shalt smite the
[17:21] rock and there shall come water out of
[17:23] it and the people may drink and moses
[17:26] did so in the sight of the elders of
[17:28] israel
[17:29] yesterday
[17:45] and meribah because of the childing of
[17:48] the children of israel and because they
[17:50] attempted the lord saying the lord
[17:52] is among us or not
[17:58] foreign
[18:10] ocho
[18:16] for if jesus had given them rest
[18:18] then would he and not afterwards has
[18:21] spoken of another day
[18:25] report
[18:40] wait a minute here esperanza momento
[18:44] this is how my bible reads
[18:48] he didn't say jesus doesn't say jesus
[18:51] jesus
[18:53] joshua in spanish
[19:09] 22 4.
[19:16] and now the lord your god has given rest
[19:19] unto your brethren as he promised them
[19:21] therefore now return and get you into
[19:24] your tents and unto the land of your
[19:27] possession which moses the serpent of
[19:30] the lord had gave you on the other side
[19:32] of jordan
[19:35] reporters
[19:50] to do the commandments and the law which
[19:53] moses the servant of the lord charged
[19:55] you to love the lord your god and to
[19:58] walk in all his ways and to keep his
[20:00] commandments and to live with him and to
[20:04] serve him with all your heart and with
[20:06] all your souls
[20:11] [Music]
[20:33] even the sienna
[20:35] lost this video
[20:37] so then we read here in the first verse
[20:40] in joshua that we read
[20:44] so it was not judgement when it gave
[20:47] them the rest
[20:50] judge was said to the land that moses
[20:53] gave you
[20:57] and another thing
[20:59] the word joshua in in the hebrew means
[21:03] jesus
[21:07] jesus
[21:10] the
[21:11] dispensations change with jesus christ
[21:14] does this penis
[21:28] something that god did
[21:31] you see remember that god was the taking
[21:34] them to the land of promise
[21:39] but he let satan tempt you along
[22:10] we know that
[22:39] the what called the commandment said
[22:41] that
[22:44] and then they went to the pocket and got
[22:47] the law for that commandment even allah
[23:34] now
[23:49] he can say
[23:50] so then in terms of how did the temp the
[23:53] devil tell moses
[23:57] one of the commandments
[24:00] all shall have no other gods before them
[24:06] so then the weak point of moses
[24:13] and when he came down from the mountains
[24:44] go
[24:47] so did jesus have a weak point
[24:52] after he tested for 40 days
[25:13] you if you are the son of god make these
[25:15] stones turn to breath
[25:22] [Music]
[25:24] alone
[25:49] [Music]
[26:08] don't think just because i i i can teach
[26:12] that i know everything no principle
[26:18] i always wondered
[26:22] maybe
[26:34] that my channels are
[26:58] [Music]
[27:27] the same thing
[27:30] that happened in the book of isaiah
[27:45] i have been anointed to bring good news
[28:01] and to proclaim the acceptable day of
[28:04] the lord
[28:07] that was on verse 2 of chapter 61
[28:14] is
[28:37] [Music]
[28:56] is
[29:09] so why did he
[29:23] it wasn't time to to
[29:27] preach about the fourth commandment
[29:32] he couldn't do it
[29:35] because he was going to be the rest
[29:52] in genesis the rest
[29:54] of israeli acceptance
[29:57] and kinesis
[29:59] there was no rest yes
[30:02] why did god rest rested on the seventh
[30:05] day of personal
[30:20] a commandment
[30:28] [Music]
[30:48] through when i need you
[30:53] hallelujah
[31:04] [Music]
[31:11] [Music]
[31:30] hebrews 4 verse 8 and 9.
[31:41] for if jesus had given them rest then
[31:44] would he afterwards have spoken up
[31:46] another day
[31:59] first night
[32:00] blessed anointing there remained there
[32:03] for a rest to the people of god
[32:11] if there was to be a sabbath
[32:16] if the seventh was to be a sandy keeping
[32:21] guard
[32:23] domingo
[32:24] he has spoken of
[33:01] come unto me all year that labor and are
[33:04] heavy laden and i will give you rest
[33:18] take my yoke upon you and learn of me or
[33:22] i am making lonely
[33:44] hebrews 4 9 to 11.
[33:50] say
[34:04] he also has ceased from his own works as
[34:07] god did from here
[34:16] let us labor therefore to enter into
[34:19] that rest
[34:20] lest any man fall after the same example
[34:24] of unbelief
[34:32] sounds
[34:43] [Music]
[35:00] he entered somewhere elentro in algon
[35:03] lugar he said come unto me all year that
[35:06] labor
[35:07] bengal
[35:11] and our heavy laden
[35:15] i will give you rest
[35:17] that is concerned what is the rest
[35:23] it is the holy spirit is in the spirit
[35:26] that is
[35:50] [Music]
[36:10] and he
[36:19] for a certain amount of time
[37:00] so god
[37:02] gave israel the seventh day for their
[37:05] seventh
[37:06] yes
[37:11] in
[37:11] commemoration in commemoration of his
[37:15] own work the supreme
[37:17] and when he finished
[37:19] creating a conde el
[37:36] [Music]
[37:45] so they all could keep a certain day
[38:14] about this sabbath rest
[38:30] what good will he do
[38:33] if you enter into his rest he enters in
[38:39] but you don't remain
[38:44] when you
[38:58] [Music]
[39:05] and the world is more appealing than the
[39:08] word of god
[39:26] and
[39:39] like i've said before
[40:01] [Music]
[40:13] [Music]
[40:21] that's why we
[40:23] we see why god could not give to us any
[40:27] certain day
[40:34] to give it to us it's a sabbath rest
[40:50] is
[41:04] which
[41:05] we enjoy
[41:09] now listen
[41:12] here's the commandment
[41:18] if he
[41:32] no matter the age
[41:35] like that i don't care if you're 10 20
[41:38] 40 60 70 years old
[41:45] no matter the age no important like that
[42:12] physically physically
[42:28] said he
[42:47] [Music]
[42:55] genesis 6.
[42:58] 3.
[43:04] and the lord said my spirit can always
[43:06] strive with men for that he also is
[43:09] flesh yet his day shall be a hundred and
[43:12] twenty years
[43:25] and god saw that the wickedness of man
[43:27] was great in the earth and that every
[43:30] imagination of the thoughts of his heart
[43:32] was only evil continually versus
[43:46] and he repented the lord that he had
[43:49] made man on the earth and he grabbed him
[43:51] in his heart is
[44:07] something for right right there in
[44:09] genesis 6 3.
[44:14] he was not resting physically anymore
[44:19] he says my spirit he said give me spirit
[44:23] we will not strive with the
[44:25] human race anymore
[44:29] he had no place to rest
[44:34] him that he had made man
[44:38] there was no place for him to rest
[44:42] genesis 1 1. enes uno uno
[44:47] in the beginning god created the heaven
[44:51] and the earth
[44:56] verse 2
[45:00] and the earth was without form and void
[45:03] in darkness when upon the face of the
[45:06] deep and the spirit of god moved upon
[45:10] the face of the water
[45:44] we heard our founding pastor picked
[45:46] wednesday on the light yes
[45:53] in the beginning
[45:57] the spirit of god moved upon the waters
[46:04] but in chapter six of genesis
[46:08] it was not the beginning
[46:11] it is the end of the beginning
[46:16] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[46:19] waters again
[46:23] upon the people
[46:33] [Music]
[46:41] principio
[46:47] genesis 8
[46:49] 6
[46:49] and this is also says
[46:52] it came to pass at the end of 40 days
[46:54] that noah opened the window of the ark
[46:57] which he had made
[47:15] sick
[47:26] and he sent forth a raven which went
[47:29] forth to and fro until the waters dried
[47:32] up from the earth
[48:03] used to be related to
[48:22] they're waiting for a car or somebody to
[48:25] kill a rabbit or get dead meat
[48:32] and they sit on the wire
[48:39] they sit on their smartphones and their
[48:42] tablets
[48:46] television
[49:01] blessed are they that hunger and thirst
[49:04] for righteousness
[49:08] so when noah led the raven out of the
[49:11] earth
[49:16] well he got tired of the
[49:20] catholic church so he went to the
[49:21] lutheran church
[49:25] so then he saw another dead body he went
[49:28] into the methodist
[49:42] important
[49:44] to save the water heater baited from off
[49:47] the face of the ground
[50:02] [Music]
[50:05] found no rest for the soul of her food
[50:08] and she returned unto him into
[50:27] [Music]
[50:38] [Music]
[50:40] god took it out of your hands and gave
[50:42] it to the nazarenes
[50:47] what happened to you
[50:52] you once had the light um
[50:56] but god took it out of your hands and
[50:59] gave it to the pentecostals
[51:05] so god moved all
[51:15] [Music]
[51:19] and until he found some people that
[51:21] would follow him
[51:27] so what is the sabbath
[51:31] what is the rest
[51:34] he needed to rest physically
[51:39] saying mark
[51:41] chapter 1 verse 9 san marcos
[51:46] it came to pass in those days that jesus
[51:49] came from nazareth of galilee and was
[51:51] baptized of john in the jordan
[51:56] versus
[52:08] and straight away coming up out of the
[52:10] water he saw the heavens open and the
[52:13] spirit like a dove descending upon him
[52:25] and there came a voice from heaven
[52:27] saying thou art my the power my beloved
[52:31] son in whom i am well pleased
[52:40] so that
[52:41] knew where to land
[52:58] he left him in the garden of gethsemane
[53:05] so where was he going to rest physically
[53:08] now hora dondiba repose
[53:25] let us go a little further
[53:29] isaiah 28 9.
[53:35] oh starting with verse 8 i'm sorry
[53:39] for all the tables are full of vomit and
[53:42] filthiness so that there is no place
[53:45] clean
[53:51] so where was he gonna go if all these
[53:54] dead bodies denominations are full of
[53:58] vomit
[54:05] brother venom said this is
[54:08] that in the last days
[54:10] there would be a predicament
[54:21] so
[54:22] if spanish
[54:37] situation is a conditional situation one
[54:40] that is difficult
[54:44] unpleasant
[54:45] no placentero or embarrassing
[54:50] situation
[55:03] ii peter chapter two
[55:08] verse 21
[55:12] for it had been better for them not to
[55:14] have known the way of righteousness than
[55:16] after they have known it to turn from
[55:18] the holy commandment deliver them to
[55:21] them
[55:33] but it is happening
[55:35] unto them according to the true proverb
[55:38] the dog is turned to his own vomit again
[55:42] and the south that was washed to her
[55:45] wallowing in the mire
[55:59] no
[56:14] when you leave the word of god
[56:19] and go to the taste in all the kind of
[56:22] things in the world
[56:28] can be said on there
[56:43] so where did he find rest donda
[56:49] here is the rest
[56:50] of the apostle isaiah 28
[56:54] starting with verse 10
[56:56] isaiah's

[57:05] precept or order upon order line up
[57:08] online
[57:09] they're here a little and they're a
[57:11] little
[57:23] verse 11
[57:26] lips and another tongue will he speak to
[57:30] these people
[57:33] that's verse 11 okay
[57:50] to whom he said this is the rest for
[57:53] which he may cause the worry to rest and
[57:56] this is the refreshing yet they will not

[58:34] god received it from his work
[58:39] the second rest in secular
[58:42] israel received it in the law
