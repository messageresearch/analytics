[1:46:33] divine plan and that one got ahead
[1:46:37] knowing the about a call from before the
[1:46:40] foundation of the world
[1:46:41] in essence he knew that we would be
[1:46:43] sitting here this and to do a work I
[1:46:48] believe that we have come for for one
[1:46:51] reason and that's to do our part to help
[1:46:53] find that new bride part of the bride of
[1:46:57] Jesus Christ that is included in Uganda

[1:47:25] translation work and that translation of
[1:47:29] course into the into the language of
[1:47:32] archery and so brother brother Thaksin
[1:47:37] here he did tell us about teach us a
[1:47:41] little bit of a but so we want to before

[1:47:58] all have brother brother beau Constance
[1:48:01] a few words to the people back home what
[1:48:05] everybody feels in his heart concerning
[1:48:06] the office that the Lord has provided
[1:48:09] for us to do the work and so the
[1:48:13] constant
[1:48:18] [Music]
[1:48:31] [Music]
[1:48:39] granted you permission for the wait
[1:48:46] coming to Uganda this is our D is
[1:48:59] concerned I contacted long time ago
[1:49:09] around 2005 we then accepted to send us
[1:49:22] some Bibles then we we received about
[1:49:31] 130 Bibles
[1:49:33] which we distributed to never judges or
[1:49:40] my sister's asses
[1:49:44] as our me as a believer of this entire
[1:49:52] message of this name I felt in my heart
[1:50:00] of us the English very well so I started
[1:50:12] to request Indian that is so he accepted
[1:50:25] to support the translation and
[1:50:31] fortunately impossibly and it had all
[1:50:37] program then I contacted again and I
[1:50:44] told him that there is a need of
[1:50:47] translation of the basis in actually
[1:50:53] language because also
[1:50:56] believers in this land do not understand
[1:51:01] English so he replied positively then he
[1:51:11] organized a day to come and meet us
[1:51:17] to me it is it was a opportunity for
[1:51:25] them to come and confirm that there are
[1:51:31] believers in this land that's why we
[1:51:35] came to talk to us a last time and they
[1:51:41] confirm it then we agreed that the
[1:51:49] translation should be started to hear
[1:51:53] so this is not my my my my my my plan I
[1:51:59] see it is a carnival this is not for my
[1:52:09] own benefit
[1:52:25] [Music]
[1:52:28] which is my I gratitude to a sentient
[1:52:59] and also the entire universe seven of
[1:53:05] the SATA he Church of cross because we
[1:53:10] have accepted to support us in this one
[1:53:15] we may call blessed in so Gracie
[1:53:20] [Music]
[1:53:22] a man
[1:53:31] amen and we want to - we want to also
[1:53:38] let you all know that
[1:53:41] brother brother Tito he is the pastor of
[1:53:46] the church in Fort Collins Colorado and
[1:53:58] along with him in his church if they are
[1:54:02] they have been a great help and try to
[1:54:04] name any books to bring things for the
[1:54:07] children so we want you all to know who
[1:54:11] are the people visit you man and the
[1:54:13] church they're calling out that is
[1:54:14] helping in this process then we have a
[1:54:23] brother Livingston now to me the
[1:54:27] beautiful thing is that brother brother
[1:54:30] Thaksin goes to brother Joel fries
[1:54:32] church
[1:54:33] yes yeah Joe three mother then he
[1:54:36] singles to brother Roberts church and
[1:54:38] then brother brother bozhil is a pastor
[1:54:40] of a church yeah and the beautiful thing
[1:54:43] is that that God is working
[1:54:46] amen to
[1:54:47] the churches together and it may be just
[1:54:56] problems but it's trouble is everywhere
[1:54:58] but it's endeavor e that means to make
[1:55:02] an effort to keep the unity of the
[1:55:05] spirit and so we say a few words
[1:55:21] really today was I was expecting a
[1:55:26] numbers of unites I never knew that you
[1:55:31] you plan was just like this having done
[1:55:36] this table
[1:55:38] so every possible I wanted to say
[1:55:41] welcome
[1:55:46] first we at the moment we are three in
[1:55:50] amis matter I think God's we the worst
[1:55:57] SAS may be the nominee may expand my
[1:56:07] plan was see this work this people but
[1:56:13] more people so I think our numbers are
[1:56:26] very difficult to beat world human and
[1:56:30] here we are then we have a brother
[1:56:35] perceived and we're thankful because
[1:56:39] brother Julius is a wonderful
[1:56:41] interpreter if he is one of the best we
[1:56:46] ever seen
[1:56:52] he's right there with the ones that
[1:57:01] interpreted for us when we do Minister
[1:57:03] last time and we have gotten over the
[1:57:06] Brazil is a tremendous see humanity
[1:57:08] needs a great communicator and we
[1:57:11] between speech and why and so anyway if
[1:57:14] you want to live a lives everywhere oh I
[1:57:19] really want to take this opportunity
[1:57:22] right may be honest I see we are very
[1:57:27] excited
[1:57:38] from the time we set a meeting with the
[1:57:41] team played by brother Perry we failed
[1:57:45] something unusual us study hard
[1:57:51] this is what I said because we wouldn't
[1:57:57] believe that the atmosphere that is
[1:58:02] seemingly becoming clear to us
[1:58:10] either way you can now suit
[1:58:14] he said miracle in itself to harvest
[1:58:17] produce the biggest challenge we have in
[1:58:22] Africa is not real personalities but the
[1:58:27] means to do it I want to appreciate my
[1:58:33] brothers for the real visionary man who
[1:58:39] has never anyway themed the direction
[1:58:43] for the Phaedo we dressed own army has
[1:58:47] always stood for such a message if you
[1:58:55] were dead so we would not have this try
[1:58:58] an arrangement natural and it was 20
[1:59:01] describe we are coming from different
[1:59:03] fellowships and some types of perception
[1:59:08] may be very person but for the simple
[1:59:11] act of God we would with pressed down
[1:59:16] all these other things and we show you
[1:59:18] the message
[1:59:21] I am happy that from our first meeting
[1:59:26] that we we were centering on the
[1:59:30] translation brothers and sisters from
[1:59:34] the judge of the cross to define to help
[1:59:41] us stand together not only for the
[1:59:44] translation
[1:59:45] but also beautiful measurements
[1:59:48] beginning today I am able to say that it
[1:59:54] will be very hard to to to bring your
[2:00:03] attention to other things like hi my
[2:00:07] purpose will come
[2:00:11] easy for you to help us man
[2:00:15] and to me I feel all that you are trying
[2:00:26] to show to us is that we wanted talk
[2:00:36] about the support available in
[2:00:38] intervention I must say the future of
[2:00:41] things and receive the convention you
[2:00:43] have contributed over 70% why because
[2:00:50] the pundit budget for the convention
[2:00:53] that there are condition that we made
[2:00:58] for the radio program which was
[2:01:01] originally not even foreign given honey
[2:01:05] - but every suggestion that we gave you
[2:01:09] that would be for the benefit of this
[2:01:13] project and for the people that are
[2:01:15] living to hear the message you did would
[2:01:19] be much question about how to be very
[2:01:21] happy to was announcing that brother
[2:01:26] Thomas they kind to me about sometimes
[2:01:31] of messages to him so many things and it
[2:01:33] was a nice okay
[2:01:37] I felt really loved in this atmosphere
[2:01:41] in my life my for my experience I am
[2:01:48] finally speak English breaths out words
[2:01:54] will not express our feelings I
[2:01:57] understand you will be the people you
[2:02:05] will see there are special
[2:02:35] [Music]
[2:02:49] so we as a as a team as a body we will
[2:03:15] realize that that God a'mighty de as I
[2:03:19] said before he had already ordained this
[2:03:22] time this is an appointed time the
[2:03:25] science that it wonderful this to happen
[2:03:29] this vision of Africa our profit for the
[2:03:33] William brand because such as you all
[2:03:37] know to the message love he always
[2:03:39] wanted to return to Africa to return to
[2:03:42] Africa and and our our founding pastor
[2:03:47] for the de MOSFET is senior which is our
[2:03:50] Father he he he captured
[2:03:55] and he had such an early the African
[2:03:58] people and those things is we have never
[2:04:02] been growing up we were never in a
[2:04:05] denomination we don't know anything else
[2:04:07] but this message and it has been
[2:04:10] instilled in us the love transferred
[2:04:12] that my father or the brand had that our
[2:04:15] father captured the vision of them that
[2:04:18] a message hasn't it
[2:04:19] our father captured it and then we have
[2:04:22] captured it that's that same vision
[2:04:24] there's a love for Africa that we we are
[2:04:28] not happy just sitting at home in the
