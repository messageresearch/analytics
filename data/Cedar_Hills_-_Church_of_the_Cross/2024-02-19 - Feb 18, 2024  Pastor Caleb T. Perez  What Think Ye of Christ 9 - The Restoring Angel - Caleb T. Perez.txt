bless him and help him in this time that he's going through amen we want to we want to get right into the word and uh we we want to this is number nine what think you of Christ with we we we we were talking yester yesterday yester yester Sunday uh we were talking about restoring the kingdom amen everybody remember now we're going to say it again number one what is the threefold purpose reveal himself in Christ and then preeminence in his bride and then restore the kingdom to its rightly position that's the key right there to its rightly position brother BR amen so if you can stand for the reading of the word this is such a it was such a hard study for various reasons but uh we we'll get into it in a little bit and and you'll understand what I'm talking about the restoring Angel the angel is uh it's not the restoring angle please change the angle to Angel and uh and but we know what they mean but we still need to get that get that right amen amen I'm waiting for the angel to come pleas oh there you go amen thank you my brothers for that remember Angel is a messenger amen so this is the restoring messenger or the restoring Angel the only way that the kingdom could be restored back to its rightly position Matthew 2241 42 while the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked them saying what think ye of Christ amen may God add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated I feel a good spirit today I feel a good atmosphere tell your neighbor hello shake their hands again and say it's good to have you good to see you neighbor amen when we talk about the restoring of the Kingdom two kingdoms come to mind and that is the Kingdom of Heaven and the kingdom of God yes all right so my question to you would be this morning are they two different kingdoms is it the same Kingdom what's with this hard to understand this your mind goes one way and you think it's a certain way and then you see something else you're like Well it can't be that and so ultimately you have to wait on God right you wait upon the inspiration you wait upon the revealing or the revelation of the word because these two things the Kingdom of Heaven and the kingdom of God they seem to at times they're used interchangeably you can hear here he the prophets say you know the the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and then turn around and say the kingdom of God is at hand the Bible speaks about both of course and when we look into this we we find out that that the the phrase the Kingdom of Heaven is used only in one book of the Bible and that is in the book of The Book of St Matthew very good all right I think it's like 32 times it's mentioned in the Book of Matthew and it's not used anymore after that and so like I said do you use you you hear it and it says the Kingdom of Heaven is is nigh or is at hand then you hear the kingdom of God is Not is at hand so so you think and you say well I I guess it's all the same well after a while you get to understand some things such as is is it two books or one book and and in one sense it's taught that it's two books in another sense it's it's the same book brother Adam says and so you see the different the different parts of it and this is what we want to to be able to to bring to you this morning we see the kingdom of of heaven and if you want to write these things down they're they're very helpful but the Kingdom of Heaven deals with time and events this is this is very very important to so you can get this it deals with Seasons it deals with the Earthly and it consists of the word all right so you got that again Kingdom of Heaven time SE events it's all about this okay and this is this is this is is so good but the kingdom of God is Not time it's not events the kingdom of God is is eternal etal it's the Eternal part now now this is this is like I said you got to get this because the kingdom of God God is the spirit so it is a spiritual Kingdom spirit of God kingdom of God is a spiritual Kingdom Kingdom of Heaven remember how the pattern that Moses saw in heaven and it was brought to Earth that pattern that's why he built the Tabernacle the way that he built it right was after the Tabernacle of or the pattern of what he had seen in heaven now now what we're looking for and Desiring is that the Kingdom of Heaven and the kingdom of God come together this is our greatest this is my greatest desire for me and for all of you we don't want the Kingdom of Heaven and the kingdom of God to be two separate things listen closely that's why I say is it two things or is it one we can't leave it at two it's got to come to become one and the same this is what we would know is known as the blending of Time and Eternity got that that's what we're trying to do we're trying to blend the events or blend time with eternity we belong to a kingdom and I want to know how many this morning say can say I belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in our life now Matthew the 11th chapter and and uh brother I I I thank brother Danny for showing he shared this with me this this goes this goes just right with with with h with my message so I said brother Dan is it all right if I use this and he he said sure yeah so this is where we we start our message then Matthew 1112 says and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence this is important because the kingdom of God doesn't suffer violence everybody understand this the Bible says the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force okay now when when we see this this is what brother Danny shared with me and this was the Aramaic translation of that verse this is this one's going to blow you away are you ready if you're writing this down get this because this is tremendous once again until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence now this is this is the translation from the moment that John stepped onto the scene until now the realm of Heaven's kingdom is bursting forth I can say God bless you good to talk to you today and I could walk away and be happy and content with just that once again from the moment that John stepped onto the scene until now the realm of Heaven's kingdom is bursting forth and passionate people taken a hold of its power can you give one to the Lord Jesus this morning it's not just Oh Brother John decided to come onto the scene huh no he stepped onto the scene and the realm of Heaven's kingdom are now this is the Kingdom of Heaven the realm of Heaven's Kingdom bursted forth I wonder if it could be told of of us the same way this morning that something burst forth when you and I came on the scene oh this is and the passionate people they've taken a hold of its power if I have to say this 10 times I'm going to say it 10 times passionate people I want to know how many passionate people we have we're here because we're passionate of what we believe we're passionate about the kingdom of godate about the kingdom of heaven with pass because I love him and I love his people that's what we're after this morning passionate people have taken hold of its power there's a power that deals with the Kingdom of Heaven that only the violent or the passionate one can take the power and do something with now watch now John the Baptist with the spirit of Elijah he foran Christ's first coming we all know that right and the moment he stepped onto the scene there was a burst that happened all hell they knew that something just went down there was such a burst that happened I can just imagine the Realms of Heaven's Kingdom had been waiting for thousands of years to get back to human being oh we know God above us we know God above us we know oh heaven we we all want to go to heaven is that right but there's something tremendous about this and that is that heaven didn't want to stay by itself Heaven wanted to come down to human beings one more time that's why we sing the song Heaven came down and Glory filled my soul imagine Heaven say are you ready you ready this is the beginning of the burst tell your neighbor neighbor it's the beginning of the burst watch this now oh I can imagine all hell began to shake because a burst had just happened where did that come from somebody came on the scene the realm of Heaven burst forth here comes the Forerunner the Forerunner of Christ the word made flesh and finally everything had come together for heaven to descend and Heavenly places to be visited once again by mortal men okay all right I'm going to say it again I I got to I got to say this to you again finally the path was being open for heaven to desend and Heavenly places going to be visited Again by mere mortal human beings my goodness is this a tremendous plan plan this is important to to remember because Johan's Ministry was not a Ministry of restoration absolutely nothing restored under the ministry of John the Baptist but it was a Ministry of for a forerunning christ first coming and it included a Ministry of repentance that's why you don't hear of any Miracles that John the Baptist did say it again What miracles don't hear about any why because he had a specific job to do the Kingdom of Heaven just bursted forth and he was to introduce let me introduce to you the word made flesh this is the Lamb of God takes away the sins of the world I like that that's why when you see Matthew 1710 and all this will start coming together watch this and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come and Jesus and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things now we're now this is restoring Angel Jesus never applied the restoration of all things to John the Baptist no no verse 11 is future so he separates verse 11 from verse 12 and then he goes on verse 12 to say but I say to to you that Elias is come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist so then why would they later on think about this Elias shall first come restore all things why then in the future or later on Acts chapter one they they came together and they asked him saying Lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel why would they ask him that question question when he had already told them that Elias was going to first come and restore all things my understanding is a l all means all that means the kingdom to Israel that means the kingdom of God that means that it was going to come by a restoring Angel okay then let's see where this is going to take us all things let's contemplate this for a moment Jesus is telling them now this is important Jesus is telling them the name of his first of the Forerunner of his first coming what was the name of the Forerunner of his first coming I want to know who Jesus said was the Forerunner of his first coming not a trick question I promise you once again who did Jesus say was going to be the Forerunner or was the Forerunner of his first coming ah Elias Jesus never said John the Baptist he said Elias shall truly first come right Elias has already come now take this now John was born they didn't know that his name was John is that right if you read the book of of St Luke the first chapter they had come to the temple on the eighth day to circumcise him and there's always nosy people all the all the time right does anybody here have have like nosy relatives do not answer that question but we all have nosy relatives and nosy friends and they come to the to the temple and the first thing they say the Bible tells you his name is Zacharias right the neighbors and it says and her family all those right they came his name Zacharias we're so happy zaras has come and then Elizabeth says no his name is not zaras his name is John John there's nobody in your family that's even named John anybody ever tell you that name your children you couldn't name it this or that they named their children and the funny thing about it is that they didn't ask you what you thought about it they said this is why we're naming them I don't like that name well name your own children but it is important that you name your children children right because that has a lot to do with their character so she says his name's going to be John anyways doesn't matter what you have to say so they look to Zechariah and of course he can't speak at the time right so he says something he needs something to write on a tablet and he writes down John and and the moment that he says it and seals it that his name is John his tongue is loosened he speak again now this is what I'm getting at some called him Zacharias some called him John but Jesus called him Elias this is important when you're when we're Kingdom of Heaven kingdom of God he calls Elias or John Elias based on the spirit that's anointing him he knows the spirit that's on him is the spirit of Elijah so they say Elias must first come and Jesus said he's already come Elias has already come he never identifies him once again as John the Baptist but as Elias and that's when they knew the Bible says that he was speaking of John amen now look notice this Luke 166 and all they that heard them laid them up in their heart saying what Manner of Child shall this be and the Hand of the Lord was with him Luke 7:28 and have your Bibles because we got a few scriptures you want to read Luke 7:28 says for I say unto you among those that are born of women there is not a greater Prophet than John the Baptist how many believe that the Bible says that there's not a greater one born of women all right but oh here we go born of a woman no one greater than John the Baptist but he that is least in the kingdom of God doesn't say Kingdom of Heaven here he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he who could be greater than the Forerunner but born of a woman he was the greatest but those that are in the kingdom of God they are not put in there by the birth of their or their physical they are born into this Kingdom by a spiritual birth and that's why the least of those that are in the kingdom of God is greater than John this is this is important that you get this now the kingdom of God can only be established in the heart of a person that has been born of the spirit born from above we're all born of a woman but now we are in the time where we must be born again was Caleb born of a woman sure I was born to my parents but I was born again I'm going to say it again I was born again and therefore I was transferred into this Kingdom he was forerunning the kingdom and why did they get so angry at John because of his Spirit I'm GNA say it again why did they get so angry at John because of his spirit yet because of his Spirit Jesus calls him Elias yet the rest of the world they didn't they were angry upset furious at him because the spirit he had was to call out what was wrong if you want to be friends with everyone you can't have the spirit of Elijah it's all okay you're going to heaven we're all going to heaven we just let's just love one another that's the cultures that's that's what they like to say just love everybody until you disagree with them they don't love you so much yeah am I the only one that lives in this kind of world the world we live in they were furious at him because they didn't like what he was preaching what was he preaching oh there you go somebody's got it now I he was preaching serpent seed yes or yes you Generation of Vipers other words your papa was the serpent back there what did he do he stood up and and said the truth it's not right for you to be to be taking your brother's wife what was he doing showing that it was the serpent seed he was preaching it and you know what it what happened to him we all know they chopped his head off why they didn't want to hear that anymore they wanted to silence the voice of God to them listen he's preaching serpent seed not right and yet people continue going on very religious what does he know barely came out of the Wilderness and camel clothed that's what he was eating all this it comes out and say hey repent yeah repent or perish get some honey in Grasshoppers and he was munching them right but he was preaching the truth why because the spirit of Elias was upon him now think about this Jesus is also not only identifying John as Elias but he's also identifying a future Prophet that was going to come to the Gentiles also as Elias I like that it was a prophet that was to rise up to the Gentiles that would rise up to the Gentiles and would bring a message for a complete restoration of all things he's coming but in the meantime elas was already here but you did with him whatever you wanted talking about John the Baptist now now where would this messenger in the spirit of Elijah start brother brandom in the paman church age I want you to be very careful here and see this God has promised that at the end time Malachi 4 is going to be fulfilled it has to be for it is the spirit Quicken word of God spoken by the prophet Malachi just before Christ comes the second time and by the time Jesus comes all scripture must be fulfilled say I want everybody to say it with me before Jesus comes the second time all scripture must be fulfilled the Gentile dispensation will be in its last Church age when that messenger of Malachi comes he will be right with the word he will take the whole Bible from Genesis to Revelation what he says and he will start at serpent SE that's good huh that's what John was preaching and so will this restoring Angel he will start at serpent SE carry on to the message in the latter rign and he will be rejected by denomination as long as he was praying for the sick the gift was in operation Bring It On in Bring It On in love you brother love you but when he says it's not right live with a woman that's not your wife that's right it's the whole problem from the beginning right what was it sex SE that's the problem of all majority of problems in the home hello everybody it's all about sex oh come on act like you don't know what I'm talking about not in church brother this is where it needs to be taught there nothing to fear could have been with our founding Pastor I he him the other day and he's like okay everybody say it together okay I want you all to spell it out with me I don't want you to be afraid of that word it's a wonderful thing if it's done correctly but the problem is is that's where it all starts it all starts with serpent seed do things and you and you say things and you think things based upon that and I can go on that but I'm not that's not my subject today but watch this is so I I just love how how how this is put together in God's word when he started to speak on serpent SE they rejected him why does serpent seed bring so much Scandal because it hits all the homes because this guy likes doing things he's not supposed to come on now come on now point to ourselves because this person likes doing things that's not part of the kingdom of God that's not part of the Kingdom of Heaven perversion yet it's an honorable thing when when two come together in marriage Genesis 3:14 and God said unto the serpent God is speaking to the serpent because thou has done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go th shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and I will put enmity we've heard many messages on this but watch I who say who's saying I God is saying I will put enmity nobody else I'm going to do this I'm going to put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel did you get that okay here's the enmity G to go on one more time it shall bruise thy head now Satan's hearing he's in the serpent right and he's hearing this it shall bruise thy head so he tries to get ahead of God's plan it shall bruise my head huh this is the way that he works this is the way he thinks I'm going to tell you something today you've heard this a million times now it's a million in one seed does not persecute seed that should be something we put on our refrigerator seed of God does not persecute the seed of God your neighbor neighbor the seed of God does not persecute the seed of God but the seed of God can can and will persecute serpent oh yeah I already know where you guys's mind is going I I can read you like a book this morning once again the seed of God can and will I'm not talking about physical that's right am because our fight's not against flesh and blood I'm talking about the spirit that anoints why are we not persecuting those spirits all we know today is this we're Christians and we're we're just getting persecuted and everywhere you look oh this parts of the world they persecute Christians it is true but when will the Christian start persecuting well well you know why we don't is because we're afraid we fear we fear the enemy tough as we say we are think we are we fear the enemy right oh I've been in the message and what does that mean you been in the message 150 years that doesn't mean nothing I'm talking about when the message has come to you live in the kingdom of God and the kingdom of heaven have come and United together that's right there is persecution going on absolutely but there's more of a spiritual persecution problem is we don't know how to fight back if you only knew what I go through only you conat congratulations and I'm not making light of it because we all go through hard times I'm getting at is this as we heard before when will you torment the Tormentor when will you persecute the persecutor what are we waiting for some right time or somebody to ding ding ding ding now this is it no no no this this is beyond that I'm talking about the kingdom of God and the kingdom of heaven coming together if not you're going to always be the PO look at me and look at my condition I'm going to bring it closer to home one person preaches the message and another one preaches the message why then do they persecute one another don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about here's the problem we're always looking at things from our Vantage or Viewpoint they're persecuting me oh they're coming against me you little child baby why don't you ever stop to try to look at at things from their point of view why don't we stop and say what are they going through you know why because the kingdom of God has not been established church has been established religion has been establish but the kingdom of God has not been establish seed will not persecute instead of looking at it we look what they're doing to me see what we can do for them I'm preaching to myself church I ain't throwing this to anyone else's yard I'm looking in the mirror of God's word I'm getting to something here why do they persecute one another why can't we see each other face to face because there's enmity there and enmity is hatred enmity is hostility and we're hostile to one another you're not close to the kingdom like that you can be close to the church you can be close to the pastor but you're far from the kingdom the other day the enemy comes there was a family and the enemy was trying to take them away I could have sat home and said well you want to go go God Bless you that's the easy thing but something in me didn't sit right and I could feel the spirit of David just start to raise up and I said no you ain't dirty devil so I took out my sling I took out my sword I went and I said the way David said I was tending my father's sheep when a lion tried to come and take one when a tried to take one of them and I slew them why cuz I went after the T Tor went the persecutor they were gone you could see the presence of God come back come back to their mind and they say I don't know what I was thinking because we've got to look after each other's Souls am I My Brother's Keeper yes I am yes you are in the Kingdom we are each other's keep but instead we fight each other what was I doing when I went I was persecuting the serpent oh come on now church I'm going to say it again I was persecuting scripture once again it shall bruise thy head here's here's Satan once again watch this watch how this unfolds saying knowing that the the blow to the head is a death blow so he's gonna blow he's gonna gonna bruise my head huh I'll get to it before he does we say anything I'll get it I'll get to it before God does I'll give God's kingdom a death blow and he does that by chopping off the head of the Forerunner I beat him to it not only did he chop John the Baptist head off but then he takes the Redeemer makes sure he's crucified at the place of the head go the skull amen I got the Forerunner and I've got the one he was forerunning beat but what he didn't know it had already been spoken I'm going to say it again he didn't know the word had already been spoken surely Elias must for [Music] and restore all things oh praise God me that's not the case today P will disrupt your families first thing he'll do is try to get rid of the head you know what I'm talking about the wife tries to be the head of the house the head has been cut off uhoh oh you guys are looking at me now again like you know what I'm talking about act the way the kingdom is supposed to act we don't act the way that we're supposed to in the Kingdom the wife wants to be the ruler she wants to be that's not restoring the kingdom to its rightly place but the man shouldn't treat her as a door as a as a as a match hello there's got to be an understanding I rule and I tell tell the man what to do from kingom like guys are in the the headlights right now cuz right now now you're thinking have I been ruling my house and they like it the women like that I'm I'm the one that we far from the kingdom because that's not your rightly position you want me to stop at least at least smile at me what I tell my daughters all the time I tell them dad jokes we've only heard that like 10,000 times can't you give me a courtesy laugh yeah at least that thank you watch this now he's he disrupts the family unit he removes the head from the home his position then he's got that but the problem was I'm going to say it again the problem was and that Satan didn't realize that he was a little too late tell your neighbor he's a little too late that by the time that Sayan got John's head chopped off the Realms of the Kingdom of Heaven had already bursted for and the kingdom of God had been introduced he was too late Church once again the Realms of Heaven's Kingdom had already bursted and the kingdom of God was already introduced Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world thy seed shall bruise the Serpent's head now he could not bruise it with the law he could not bruise it with the prophets but he did it when the woman's seed became the masterpie Christ what think you of Christ he bruised the Serpent's head what is the word bruise he put a bruise on it the word Bruiser means to crush it means to [Music] overwhelm I got a call the other day and my brother saying brother I'm overwhelmed this and this and this and I'm like don't worry about it we're all going through that this one's going through that this one's people are going through this people are going through that don't don't don't feel special we going but let's overwhelm him now oh come on church it's time that we overwhelm him Fe shall bruise his head it overwhel the case of the enemy it will overwhelm them the gates will be overwhelmed by the subjects of the Kingdom that are the passionate ones that have taken the power of the Kingdom know how to use that Hallelujah he was the stone that Daniel saw heed out of the mountain he was the one that could Smite he was the one that could bruise he proves what think he of Christ he's a Crusher he's a Bruiser he's a Bruiser he's a Crusher he's an overwhel do you know why we don't because we don't we don't want to put in that part of it in other words we we don't want to get on our knees so much anym because we have everything we need nice house nice car we're all we're good now good it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of the needle for a rich man to enter the king and it's okay if you if God's blessed you but that's not what governs or rules when all we think about how can I make my next dollar money want so rich end of it you're lost why you're far from the kingdom you can't get in you rely on your money rather than on on Christ let me go on now I got to get this good get get all this done today either so you're going to be feel hungry when we get to no no this this now are you still with me you keep pulling and I'll keep going he overwhelmed him and now in the evening time the head returned put me up the put me up that that cloud please if you have the picture of the cloud in the evening time I chopped off John's head that was the Forerunner but as John the Baptist ran my first coming your message run my second coming what happens the head appears again praise God hallelujah there arose a messenger with the spirit of Elijah restore all things says the Elijah of today is the Lord Jesus Christ he just he just has a different Veil brother BR says the only the only difference between Jesus of yesterday and Jesus of today he got a brown suit on today that's what he says right why he's the same yesterday today and forever he returns to do what to bruise the head to overwhelm him now these are for the subjects of the Kingdom you know why we don't overwhelm the enemy because we we keep hitting our head up against the wall by doing the same thing and I told my husband told my wife boom and you Ki your head over against the walled no I want to do it my way when are you going to stop that and finally surrender and say Lord I'm want to be the subject of your kingdom I want to do things my way I'm tired I don't get nowh this 30 40 years I'm it's the same thing our homes it's the same thing you all know it's the same fights over just you fight about it you regurgitate it and you fight about the same thingg and why nothing is ever dealt with apart from the kingdom but there was a restoring Angel yeah watch this now but this time watch to do what the head returns and this time it wasn't just the round of Heaven's Kingdom bursting forth I'm G to say this again and I want you to get this now in the days of John it was the realm of the Heavenly Kingdom but this time with this Elias to restore all things it wasn't just the realm of Heaven's Kingdom buring forth but the realm Realms of the kingdom of God were bursting forth now cuz it wasn't until the end time when the kingdom of God was fully unveiled it was the kingdom of God who is god well what is he he's a spirit but he revealed himself in Christ then he has preeminence now he's restoring the kingdom by a restoring Angel this is Christ now this is God unfolding himself now the kingdom of God is within you Hallelujah one of these days he's coming in glory he already did come on now his glory is his bride GL is he coming in you come on Church same church or we're or we're this is real we're waiting for for heaven to come be in Heavenly places why are we not in Heavenly places we're in a pew at church amen amen feel like much today I didn't feel like coming today oh I think I'm going to get sick I better not go it's a shame what Co has done huh finally told somebody the other day proba to get in trouble for this but I told somebody the other day don't even test just you want you want go get prayed for get go get prayed for oh no no stay away stay away get over here give me a hug we got to overwhelm those devil but we're afraid why are we afraid church because somebody's lost somebody has tattoos no they're not our kind what do you mean they got a soul just like you somebody's got to overwhelm them there's got to be a love of God bursting for church brother and sister that will love your neighbor and will even love your enemies overwhelm them with the love of God time to burst forth what's ins oh I think I'm a Christian I don't know if I should pray or not oh let it burst forth show the world who you are well they don't see things like I don't care don't care don't care anymore try to make it like like like we're some somebody so much greater than everyone else so far from the kingdom we are so far from the kingdom because when some of you are far from the kingdom I'm far that I'm accountable for all your how do I help you get to the kingdom watch this the Realms of God are bursting forth now I will sayth the Lord spoken word is the Original Seed that was bursting forth is the kingdom of God bursting forth now kingom of God bursting forth now when brother brandham referred to bursting forth earthquakes talk about volcanos what is he showing what is he telling us that this Earth is ready to to it's it's in labor pains ready for a new Earth to be pushed out of that's the way we should be church every time we come to service there be a bursting force a Son of God is trapped in there a daughter of God is trapped let him out this morning let him out this morning let be a bursting forth this morning it's the kingdom of God bursting forth we're looking for new heavens and new earth we're looking for a new government New Kingdom that will be ruled by the Lord Jesus and his bride it starts by looking the mirror because there's no such a thing as a kingdom without subjects and you can't have subjects and it Kingdom without a king you can't have a King Without a Queen hallelu we've we've heard this many times but I want you to get this the message Paradox brother brandom is having this vision and in there he's he's uh everybody remember he sees this this massive beastly snake and he asked everyone was afraid my question is is that us he said everybody was afraid I said what's everybody so afraid of and the voice says because there is such danger in these days somebody's got to put those fans on or something are you cold out there or is it hot [Music] you're I sanctify myself for your sake I sacrificed this morning I swe it out as long as you guys are comfortable there's such dangers he says and here come A huge monster snake the weeds he crawls up on the highway of course the snake represents he says sin and death I looked and he looked looked angry at me course he's preaching serpent seed he was angry he licked his tongue and here he come he got close he would run fast and get slower and slower and then stopped and something would hold him off could bite me and he would turn around on the other side try to approach from this side he come real fast and then he gets he couldn't move he couldn't strike me but then he turned and looked at my friend remember what we preached last Sunday restoring friendship there's a lot of friendships that need to be restored whether they agree with us or not they it needs to be restored the Lord comes on Wednesday and preaches reconciliation my goodness how much clearer does God have to speak to us looked at my friend and a way he went after my friend I see my friend jumping way in the air trying to strike him I said if it ever hits him it's instant death I threw my hands up I said oh God have mercy on my the holy spirit says the last time you asked that I would have mercy on your friend Church it's a humbling experience when you get into the presence of God not all joy jumping those are the blessings when you come into His presence you why haven't you called off that snake you have no answer you stand before a holy God I said oh God have mercy on my brother if it ever strikes him it'll kill him just then the serpent turned to me and I and looked at me again and a Bo voice came and says you have been given power to bind him the worst or any you've been given power to bind him come on now we're we're in serpent seed right now you've been given power to bind him I said God God what must I do he said there's one thing you must do you must be more sincere do you understand this church watch the kingdom being being restored it's not I I want the power to pray and they they those ideas of that be more sincere God's called each one of you each one to do you want to take hold and be passionate about the power be more sincere you must be more sincere said God forgive me for my unsin me I raised my hands to him something came over me that's the protection that's the kingdom lifted me up seemed like my whole body was charged with something I looked at that serpent he started towards me in name of the Lord Jesus Christ I bind you he said that thing just started crawling up began to choke itself and the brother was free just then the voice says you can unbind him too and I said then saying I that I might know I unbind you and when it did it started coming to life again and I said I bind you back in the name of Jesus Christ smoke flew out of him choked himself turned to a crystal and the voice said now you must be more sincere than what you are to do this I don't know how many of you but I want to be more sincere time that when you have to stand there that snake that that serpent is coming after you the only way be more sincere you can't play around with of God one day and be happy in the next day no it left and I was standing there watch what's bursting forth the sons of God are being made manifest and they are bursting on the scene oh come on church I'm talking to every one of you Son of God are bursting on the scene it's the manifestation of the sons of God other time were the sons of God to ever be made manifest but right now of all the times and brother Braham has just finished preaching I think it was the sixth Hill he's talking about questions and answers he said of all the times that I've been behind the pulpit have never never in any time of my Ministry ever worked into the Realms of God and the spiritual Realms has been this time beyond anything I ever did in any time of my Ministry in any meeting anywhere I am I am working in the Realms of God and the spiritual Realms and then he goes on in in the message look and I have been living ever since in the Glorious Realms of God because in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished the restoring the restoring it should be finished question it is it is it finished in your life come on now we're driving it home finished in your life where we are this morning coming around the corner you love him all right I'll notice this now how many of you want to go to heaven how can you go to heaven if if Heaven has come down just the question and which Heaven do you want to go to the Bible talks about a first Heaven third heaven what heaven are you going to go to the air up there brother Henry tells me that the higher you go the less air there is right harder harder to to breathe when we think about this that's why I I I understand very touchy Kingdom of Heaven kingdom of God and I see this I said now now notice brother brandham when he preaches is this is the sign of the the answer can somebody tell me what the first mystery that brother Bram talks about he gives a list of mysteries is that right gives a list of mysteries what's the number one mystery that brother B now the first mystery anybody know the mystery of the Kingdom of Heaven the first mystery is the mystery of the kingdom of heaven and if God speaks or sends you he backs what you say notice if you're an ambassador from Heaven All Heaven is behind you this is the key to the kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of God watch Heaven is consisted of the word all right you got the word all right we got Heaven Heaven's come down the word has come forth the Kingdom of Heaven is word but the gospel didn't come in word only watch watch it come together the gospel didn't come in word only heav is the word but the gospel didn't come in word only Power demonstration so if Heaven the Kingdom of Heaven is word the kingdom of God is power and demonstration if the Kingdom of Heaven is mechanic then the kingdom of God is dynamic king of God will make the Kingdom of Heaven do what it says it will do for the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink but righteous and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost the kingdom of God is established in the heart and soul of a man by a revelation of Jesus Christ that Upon This Rock I'll build my church acts 18 says but ye shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you shall be a witness for and then Luke 16:16 says and the law and the prophets were until John and since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presseth into it Our Gospel didn't come in word only it didn't come in just the Kingdom of Heaven watch what he says say this first Thessalonians 1:5 Our Gospel came not unto you in word only this gospel isn't just in the Kingdom of Heaven word only but also in the power and in the Holy Ghost is the kingdom of God and in much Assurance as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake 1 Corinthians 4:20 for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power are we getting somewhere did I lose you already you want me to I'm done then I'll be finished I'll be finished yeah no yeah half and half all right just give me a little bit more I'm telling you're going to be hungry when we're done with this neither shall they say low here or low there for behold the kingdom of God is within you oh my goodness the kingdom of God is established in the heart this this is I'm coming around a corner and then I'll and then I'll I'll let you go because I know it gets a little too much after a while so disciples if you if you look into into Matthew the the 13th chapter you that's where you find a lot of a lot of The Parables right kingdom of God the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man it's like a net it's like a man that's Pearl looking for pearls all these things in Matthew the 13th chapter but watch and this is this is where where the Lord was leading me this morning Matthew 13:10 and the disciples came and said unto them why speakest thou unto them Parable okay come on you're GNA have to pinch yourself this morning I can feel you starting to drift off come on overwhelm your bodies right now overwhelm your mind right now oh my go we can sit at meetings for hours and you can watch movies for hours church and all these Devils hanging on your eyelids good time trying to close those eyelids shake them come on overwhelm them come on do do like my my grandfather would do sit there and then he'd start to get une easy pinch himself and says you got it all right here we go why do you speak unto them in Parables a parable get this please a parable we can all repeat this and Earthly story and the Kingdom of Heaven is all about Parables deals with time events it's an Earthly story but it's got a Heavenly meaning there's a parable watch watch him bring together the kingdom of God and the kingdom of heaven here we go watch this now once again an Earthly story can you repeat after me because this is important a parable a parable is an Earthly story is an Earthly story with a Heavenly meaning why do you always preach or talk to to us in parable H number one mystery mystery of the kingdom of watch let's unfold this mystery real quick but watch what else it means it's the placing of one thing by the side of another thing Parable right Earthly story Heavenly meaning let's just say he's the heav I'm the Earthly it side by side oh come on now come on Church you're gonna have to pull a little bit on this one again it's an Earthly story Heavenly meaning why do you always speak in Parable that's what he says it's to compare one thing with another it's the the likeness or similitude it's to illustrate a Doctrine what makes and then brother Bram says we don't ever compel our women to do these things we don't compel them to not drink or the men to not drink or swear we just preached the gospel lay down the pattern of the Bible come on lay yourself next to the word and compare well they in that church they they make the women have long hair and they make them wear skirts and dresses do any of you do that I I I don't do that brother says we don't compel Force you got to do that or you're going to go to hell say you're going to go to hell if you do don't do that brother says we don't compel the women and the men to act or do a certain thing we place the pattern it's up to you to get by the pattern see am I living according to the word come on now Church come on now we're all here this is where we all live and we got to come next and see is is there a likeness between me and the word but there comes a point at which the word and you have to become one it's just the parable as long as you're side by side but when the word and you become one it's no longer just an Earthly story Church there's a Heavenly meaning to your life and my life that's why we want to be get after this morning there's a Heavenly meaning this morning it's not just an Earthly story where Satan gets us oh you're just a human being make mistakes that's the Earthly story that's the Kingdom of Heaven the Kingdom of Heaven and the kingdom of God come together it's now the Earthly story and the Heavenly meaning coming together time and eterni blending together oh he says men come to the Pentecostal faith and the Holiness a lot of things but it's not in our hearts and many women do the same we don't tell them what they have to do have I forced any of you to do anything have I forced you to you dress this way and you blah blah after a after a while it's just nothing but reformation and the kingdom of God is far from you're back in the church ages somewhere you're lost in the you're lost in the pyramid somewhere I'll tell you the mystery of the parable Kingdom of Heaven your Earthly story has a Heavenly meaning what were you waiting for some great mystery that's the that's the answer number one mystery of the Kingdom of Heaven your Earthly story has a Heavenly me my Earthly story has a Heavenly meaning the rest of the world don't see that they're living their life oh have a good time let's just enjoy life today we we live we eat and drink tomorrow we die Noory or meaning because there is no theop there's no Heavenly representation that you can come next to and say wow that theophany oh my that theophany is made in the image of God body like God that's why it's theop the is of God and that's why it's the kingdom of God come it's in you well our theophany is up there maybe yours well my theophany is next to me at some point but then comes the place where your theop is got to be inside heaven Church come on where's heaven you're looking out there I I got to stop here for a moment because this is good this and I'm going to finish up here but I got to I got to just get you this part right here when we think of heaven we always say like when when the Lord told brother brandom because you have chosen en the more excellent way a large portion of Heaven watch where we're at with this come on I'm finishing up a large portion of Heaven awaits man when I get there man I'm taking Mars Milky Way galaxy it all pertains means to me you're far from me listen to brother BR because we we quote that all the time a huge portion of Heaven awaits the message Paradox now that's what I wondered when I die what will it be then I happen to think Heaven is not portioned on off to different portions to us up there Heaven is the Kingdom of Heaven that's within you that one waits for okay here we go I want to go to heaven I believe I'm gonna have a huge mansion and I'm gonna mortal beings live in Mortal houses Immortal beings live in Immortal habitations is heaven a place it's a condition come on now a large portion of Heaven awaits him because you have chosen the the harder way portion awaits you of Heaven he says when I went beyond the current of time saw all was Heaven the place or was Heaven the people those are Brites no they your converts to Christ who we are coners to Christ because was not Eliah supposed to first come you're looking for heaven heaven in you right now Heaven consists of the word start listening to the word by hearing hearing of the word of God start listening it put the word inside of you then when the kingdom of God and the kingdom of heaven the word begins to do what it says it will do and then you understand the parable parable of the S parable of the of the man that that sold land to buy this this Pearl pares like the net you should see all parables in your life I'm G to say it again you should see all those par should throwing the net and bringing in people you realize Jesus Christ the pearl of great price is in you that's what makes the story Earthly story heaven meaning stand to your feet I could just go on and on there's too much here much the brothers would [Applause] come and I just want to end here and maybe I'll pick us up next time I'll pick this up next time the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence breaking forth or it is entered in by force what Rapture is Right Rapture is to take by force but then it becomes clear one last scripture it becomes clear because the seventh mystery is the mystery of God even as Christ as the Incarnate fullness of the godhead fully embodied and godliness is restored then I want to just leave you with this with this last scripture Micah 2 verse3 it's time to overwhelm the breaker has come tell the neighbor The Breakers come the breaker is one that breaks that's what the scripture says the breaker is come up before them they have broken up have passed through the gate and are gone out by it and their King shall pass before them and the Lord on the head of them there is the breaking forth bursting forth the breaker somebody's broken broken the wind for you I'm gonna say it again someone has broken the wind the breaker he's breaking forth this morning I don't know about you time is running short I want to make sure I want to make sure that I'm not looking at the Kingdom of God in the Kingdom of Heaven way out there know and see it in my own life I want my Earth this story no I want my Earth the story to have a heaven in I don't know about you I want a Heavenly meaning I didn't do this just because I I did that because there was a Heavenly representation me and showed me where to go what to do so if you want with every head bowed I stand here before you not just as a man but as a carer and take caretaker pastor of the Sheep it's my purpose Prophet says to try to help the kingdom of God to try to strengthen your churches and strengthen Brotherhood among men as we're waiting for the coming of the Lord I'm sure you all understand that he's waiting for that you to believe him there's got to be a bursting forth this morning that's what he said there's got to be a bursting forth there's got to be a new birth bursting forth seed bur forth God's calling some of you he saying come unto me give me your heart so I ask at this moment if there's anyone that has never been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ your life try to be the best you could try to be the best person but today he's saying let me

to read for her Granda today we thought we'd read it at at the at the Caps Fellowship Hall but I thought it'd be better if we could record it today of what God has given okay I was just making sure I could see you um celebrating somebody who's very special to me I thought it would be nice if I could try to write something for him and so I asked the Lord for his help in that and asking you shall receive because I ended up writing two poems so one is um on the tables there in the fellowship hall and I'm going to try to read this one without crying so puppy dogs and rainbows puppy dogs and rainbows this is called like him I always try but I'm never able to express the value of your impact world's best grandpa might seem like a compliment but with you it's a fact being your granddaughter feels like I've somehow won first prize because when looking at you it's like I'm staring at his eyes whenever we're together I often give a second peek because even though you're talking it's him I hear speak just to make sure you don't get get some crazy thought I'm not saying that he's Jesus I'm not saying that he's not some might think by saying this I'm going way out on a limb but I can't help it it's not my fault you're just so much like him growing up with you are some of the best times I've had you've been my grandpa my example my teacher and Dad you taught me about hunting eating hot chili and even how to drive but mostly you taught me God's word and that's what keeps me alive now it's not like you always spoiled us or even spared the rod but love is corrective and through you I've known only the love of God because there was a young girl cast aside and left alone but you took her in and cared for her as your own and being a witness to your life changed her whole story abandonment and shame replaced by love and victory similarities between you and Christ are not so hard to see because if you weren't a god-filled man just where would that girl be make no mistake all honor and Glory go to the Lord but I'm still thankful for a vessel in which his Spirit has been stored in school I had to write about my hero of course I wrote about you all these years later I'm still writing about my hero nothing can change my view all this time you've been with us how much do we know are we recognizing the sacrifice or wondering what's left to show like Philip telling Jesus show us the father and it will suffice while you must not have thought it robbery because every day you have shown us all Christ I love you wow who could have said that any any better amen God bless you Sister tab enjoyed that and uh yes we do we do love Uncle Abraham very very very very very very very very much amen well we have one more thing to do before we leave I was hoping brother brother uh Henry I was hoping they would dism miss the service and but I can't we got to do what we got to do so sing another song maybe we should do it after we eat huh of hry I'm kind of hungry right now well I'm gonna ask if sister or brother Elijah and sister Grace would come we have't we have an engagement this this morning I uh as hard as it is in one sense I'm very happy and honored in another sense it's what we preach what we stand for and you take a a young man and a young woman in the day and age that we live in I don't believe that he had another girlfriend I don't believe she had another boyfriend and uh you know you you you see what God what God has done and what God has has brought together when you have the world and the way that they live and the way that they do things no respect for one another no respect for God no respect for their parents young man and a young woman who has stood for God's word and um wow it's it's possible that's what I want to tell everyone here online it's possible the Lord to make him number one and it's possible to have a life worthy of the Gospel this the most terrible most treacherous time that there is so I'm very proud of both of them and uh though I fought her not in a bad way but uh ge I tried to bribe her I I got to admit I tried to bribe her everybody knows but it didn't help but uh anyways the time has come and uh gesh but we're here and I wanna I want to I I saw something the other day daughter Viola had sent me this but I I thought it very very appropriate to read this culture says fall in love God says walk in love because everything that falls breaks but everything that grows becomes strong culture s says love is a feeling God's word says God is love put him at the center culture says marry the person that you love God says love the person you marry and culture says if you find the right person you will be happy God you be the right person but in those things we we realize what God's word says and uh so we've come to this point that brother Elijah he is no longer on the market Grace is no longer in the market and uh he said uh he asked her he asked her to marry him on Friday what did say then have you asked my dad yet which is a good answer right yeah yeah yeah yeah hey wait a minute there's there's steps and of course she didn't know that we we had already talked the day earlier in the day and so after that she said said yes no stutter if she was she sounded pretty sure very sure very sure huh okay and so how did he do kind of grade do you give him for asking how he asked good 100% yeah 100% huh [Music] hey too excited here GE 100% amen and so so can you just kind of give us a little I mean tell the people a little bit how it happened can you tell us a little bit of the story like anybody like to know the story how how this happened I mean how it went down whoever either either one well we went and ate something first is what we did after we went said hey we're going to go take a drive on Baylor Canyon and if we get lucky we'll see something we'll see some deer something something cool like and so we pulled off the road on a good spot and when I bought the ring they didn't give me a box to go with it so I just kept it on an antler like the one you can see on the picture there by my but and so I had it on that I was able to hide it so while we were looking and as the sun was setting the golden hour golden hour golden hour everybody remember the golden hour message all right um I just grabbed it and asked if she would marry me he's got some romantic blood in there huh R oh that's great so as as hard as it is in one sense it's not hard in another sense I just have to take my dad hat off and put my pastor hat on and that's not easy to do but both way even with both hats I'm proud of both of you we loving the Lord first of all I believe that this uh do you do you have a date yet close all right you want to let them know I mean yeah we're planning on June 8th that's that's the date okay so June 8th I think it's a good good date all right hold on I got to interrupt here I didn't get a date from you all did we get finally get a date oh brother brother uh Noah and sister sister uh Rebecca's April 7 and I walked in the church the other day I was like what what is Noah doing what is doing sitting over there with I toally spaced that they had gotten engaged they're engaged now amen very proud proud of them and our young people how they are how God is serving the lord and what God is doing in their lives we appreciate the Lord we're thankful we got to see what kind of this ring still doesn't have a box K got ant he's got an antler yeah wow let me see if you guys can see that yeah that's beautiful amen so as we know in in our engagement we say it and we say it again time and time again there's no hanky panky oh none of that going on keep yourselves first time you kiss it should be at the altar you may kiss the bride if yourself God Honors that God loves that and so as this uh symbol that you have asked and in all reality in the eyes of God you're already married we need to go through the through the wedding and so forth go through the Finish going through the steps but the moment she said I I do that's her vow that she will stick to he asked you that's his vow that he will amen so grateful to God and as we bow our heads
