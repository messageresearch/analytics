[26:33] this time i'm asked sister
[26:35] if you would come and give your
[26:37] testimony
[26:48] just quickly when i say i'm something
[26:50] like
[27:32] so i tested her because i have kobe test
[27:34] at home right
[27:37] now
[27:44] okay let's go to the doctor and i called
[27:45] one of the sisters who went out to lunch
[27:47] with her
[27:52] [Music]
[27:55] so i went to the urgent care and i told
[27:57] her just wait here
[28:11] and they said what can i see her here
[28:12] and no doctor is going to say you have
[28:14] to take it to the hospital
[28:20] [Music]
[28:27] you know when you're a nurse you take
[28:29] care of a hundred thousand people
[28:31] through your three years
[28:36] and you can assist a doctor to see your
[28:38] own child
[28:42] they you know you probably will
[28:44] understand my feeling
[28:48] so i went home
[28:50] and i told you
[28:51] the worst you feel then you come you
[28:53] have to say by his wounds i'm healed
[29:14] so
[29:15] she obviously didn't have a doctor
[29:16] because i didn't change her from
[29:18] pediatrician doctor so she didn't have a
[29:19] doctor
[29:23] anyway so i went to the restroom without
[29:25] her knowing
[29:28] uh
[29:34] and i said
[29:36] satan enough is enough
[30:06] and i saw bradbury evie
[30:09] and that's dream he just said to me
[30:21] to read i have i've instructed you so
[30:23] that came right into my mind yes so and
[30:26] throwing me mentally just the power came
[30:28] to me
[30:30] angry at the devil
[30:33] has no right to put his hands over any
[30:36] of us
[30:38] and um so when i review can i say my
[30:41] daughter is the child of the almighty
[30:43] god
[30:47] and so am i
[30:52] i felt something in my back like a snake
[30:54] coming in between my skin going like
[30:56] that
[31:04] and then you come out of my body right
[31:05] now
[31:09] i was in sick
[31:11] my daughter next day was hill
[31:16] and uh of course i have a friend doctor
[31:18] she said maria you come anytime
[31:24] and so i call her and she prescribes
[31:25] someone to my house i think sister
[31:27] lauren i should pay for antibiotics
[31:45] is because sometimes just because
[31:46] sometimes you we don't know what's going
[31:48] on
[31:51] but uh but i i'm so thankful to the lord
[31:54] that he answered prayers
[31:58] and i feel so strongly that i'm not
[32:02] alone
[32:07] and i feel like we are not alone
[32:10] we just need to see with your eyes of
[32:13] faith
[32:16] and this is for the honor and the glory
[32:18] of my all my jesus
[32:22] christ
[32:25] [Applause]
[32:32] man let's all stand
[32:35] we have come to the most important part
[32:37] of the service and that's to hear god's
[32:39] word
[32:41] amen at this time with
[32:43] we're going to be introducing our
[32:44] brother jerry dello and our brother

[33:24] [Music]
[33:31] i
[33:32] do
[33:33] not know
[33:35] [Music]
[33:37] just why
[33:39] he came to love
[33:42] me so
[33:45] but he looked beyond
[33:51] all my faults and he saw
[33:55] my knees
[33:57] [Music]
[34:13] to
[34:14] view
[34:16] the cross
[34:19] where
[34:20] jesus died for me
[34:26] [Music]
[34:46] oh
[34:50] [Music]
[35:14] all the time
[35:17] god bless you this evening
[35:21] you're nice to see all your wonderful
[35:23] faces
[35:29] thank the pastor for the
[35:31] confidence in
[35:32] me to speak the word this evening
[35:38] kind of interesting how this came about
[35:41] is
[35:44] [Music]
[36:04] i guess i try to get out of it but
[36:06] but whatever the lord wants we we can't
[36:08] escape it
[36:11] whatever the lord wants not what i want
[36:15] what god wants amen
[36:18] we open our scripture real quick
[36:24] 36
[36:29] and when i want to start with verse 26
[36:42] and it says a new heart also will i give
[36:45] you
[36:46] and a new spirit will i put within you
[36:50] and i will take away the stony heart
[36:53] out of your flesh
[36:55] and i will give you a and heart of flesh
[36:57] [Music]
[37:06] on
[37:08] i will put my spirit within you
[37:12] and cause you to walk in my statutes
[37:15] and ye shall keep my judgments and do
[37:17] them
[37:20] [Music]
[37:31] may god add the blessing to the word of
[37:34] the world you may be seated
[37:38] you know i didn't i didn't really
[37:41] have a thought that that
[37:46] just had a hard time finding the thought
[37:51] i just started looking some of
[37:53] the old old old stuff but i wouldn't
[37:55] call it old but
[37:57] but some of my previous notes that i had
[38:00] it was
[38:01] it was
[38:02] not a schedule
[38:04] and this one really caught my attention
[38:08] because uh
[38:09] how many find it hard sometimes to live
[38:11] a christian life juantos
[38:14] is difficult
[38:17] especially in this day and age
[38:18] especially
[38:20] i mean it's it's the most wickedest age
[38:22] we'll ever live in
[38:23] [Music]
[38:25] there there's just so much going on out
[38:27] there
[38:29] and not i mean for older people younger
[38:32] people everybody in general
[38:36] there's just so much out there i thought
[38:39] but sometimes we find it hard right to
[38:41] live a christian life this is
[38:44] difficult
[38:46] you know and and um
[38:48] you know what one of the things you know
[38:50] you we must first do
[38:54] if we want the new birth
[38:57] we we must repent right
[39:00] and and
[39:01] repent probably everybody knows what
[39:03] repent means right
[39:08] you know i ask god for forgiveness of
[39:10] your sins and
[39:23] of course you got to confess your sins
[39:25] and you got to say you know forgive me
[39:26] lord i'm sorry
[39:28] [Music]
[39:30] but also to repent is you got to have a
[39:32] change of mind
[39:35] it's got to be a whole change of thought
[39:54] mind
[39:55] the demo chose
[39:57] the hair el diablo
[40:00] but god chose the heart
[40:02] so your mind is in your heart
[40:05] you do a lot of your thinking from your
[40:07] heart
[40:27] he's got to take out that stony heart
[40:31] because that's tony hart will get you
[40:33] nowhere else
[40:51] now let's not get confused
[40:56] maybe maybe because sometimes we we
[40:57] sometimes we get to this step
[41:01] and we and we get this heart taken out
[41:03] of us
[41:12] and maybe sometimes we confuse that with
[41:14] the holy spirit
[41:17] and maybe that's why we struggle when we
[41:19] get to a certain point and we said well
[41:21] i got a new spirit you know
[41:25] spirit but i got a new spirit
[41:29] what's going on i got a new spirit
[41:32] but brother brown says that that's a new
[41:33] spirit for you and my brother
[41:37] because it's part of the chain
[41:40] it's part of the change that's part of
[41:41] the because if you were to give you the
[41:43] holy spirit right then and there the
[41:45] real spiritual is a moment
[42:00] we can barely put up with ourselves
[42:05] sometimes we can barely put up with one
[42:07] another
[42:10] sometimes we can barely put up with our
[42:12] spouses
[42:15] [Music]
[42:41] bye
[42:56] you know you got repent
[43:00] you know that's a that's one r yes
[43:05] it's not like in like in school you had
[43:07] the three r's right
[43:10] in english
[43:20] [Music]
[43:24] there's a couple of ours in here
[43:29] and one of the r's is replacing
[43:33] replacer
[43:34] we replace the old mindset replacement
[43:54] you know
[43:55] it's it's it's like when when you when
[43:58] you read in uh if you read in a matthew
[44:01] matteo
[44:02] 9 17 mateo nueva de siete
[44:24] since neither do men put new wine into
[44:26] old bottles
[44:30] else the bottles break the rotometer
[44:33] and the rhine run it out
[44:34] vino
[44:47] and both are
[44:48] preserved so what we've got to do is
[44:51] we're getting this new heart servant
[44:55] we get this new heart
[44:58] but we can't put the old stuff back in
[44:59] it
[45:02] has
[45:15] it wasn't necessarily a bottle of water
[45:19] but it but it was made i i believe was
[45:21] made out of goat skins
[45:24] so when you when you put when you put
[45:26] the wine in there
[45:29] it's still in the formation process
[45:32] fermentando so that that bottle or that
[45:35] goat skin is appeal would conform to
[45:38] that wine
[45:41] because there's gases that are still
[45:43] that are still forming
[45:44] yeah and it's still the wine is still in
[45:48] process
[45:50] so when you take out when you empty it
[45:52] out
[45:54] it gets old and cracked
[45:58] because it's conformed to what was
[46:00] already in there before because
[46:03] so in our hearts
[46:05] on what was in there before
[46:08] we came up with an old crackled heart
[46:15] it was full of junk
[46:18] it's full of stuff that shouldn't be in
[46:19] there you know the questions
[46:21] so you would put this new wine in there
[46:25] into this old cracked honest viejo
[46:31] and it wouldn't last very long it would
[46:32] explode you know you know
[46:35] and then the wine would be no good
[46:38] but it's the same with our hearts
[46:53] it's our responsibility
[47:09] and you know somebody told me the other
[47:10] day i hear i hear messages all the time
[47:16] and there's nothing wrong with that
[47:18] there's nothing wrong because i read
[47:19] every day
[47:21] i do this every day
[47:36] but if i'm
[47:49] [Music]
[47:52] and then we wonder why we can't get any
[47:54] farther sometimes
[47:58] we struggle every day
[48:01] i still struggle every day
[48:04] the
[49:00] this evening
[49:14] let me read something in here
[49:17] this is brother branham
[49:21] he said god prophesied through a prophet
[49:24] and said i will write my laws in their
[49:26] heart
[49:34] it's showing that
[49:35] that that would be the dwelling place of
[49:37] god in the human heart
[49:51] amen amen i will write them in my heart
[49:56] in their heart
[49:58] and they'll keep my statutes
[50:01] and so forth saith the lord
[50:07] god said in another place over in
[50:08] ezekiel
[50:11] he said i will i will in that day the
[50:13] hoyo and aquel dia take out
[50:16] your your old fleshy stony heart
[50:22] and i will give you a new spirit there's
[50:24] a new of a spiritual
[50:32] he says a lot of times get mistaken
[50:37] now a lot of people even in pentecostal
[50:39] people a lot of times getting mistaken
[50:41] in that
[50:46] that you you get a new spirit
[50:49] of spiritual he says that's not god's
[50:51] spirit
[50:57] [Applause]
[51:12] run around a little bit and think you
[51:14] got the holy ghost
[51:18] that's not it yes
[51:33] and there's nothing wrong yeah i mean
[51:40] but we're leaving like like we got this
[51:42] new new new spirit in us or this holy
[51:44] spirit in us
[52:02] you know one of my biggest big biggest
[52:04] weaknesses
[52:08] one of my biggest weaknesses
[52:12] that every time
[52:13] the devil wanted to get me to go back
[52:29] and then a little bit of drinking
[52:33] and i struggled with that for years
[52:36] i thought so much that that i was an
[52:37] alcoholic
[52:39] but i i thought i could have one foot in
[52:41] and one foot out
[53:11] when i finally realized
[53:13] i got a new spirit
[53:16] but i didn't get the holy spirit
[53:19] and once the holy spirit comes in when
[53:21] they enter the spirit it'll change
[53:23] everything
[53:25] it'll change your life
[54:22] form of thinking
[54:26] i don't know what time i got here up
[54:27] here but let me finish with this
[54:44] we can go to to uh to romans 12. romanos
[54:49] dosa
[54:53] romans 12 and verse 2.
[54:59] be not conformed to this world
[55:02] but be transformed by the renewing of
[55:04] your mind
[55:06] that you may prove what is that good
[55:09] an acceptable and perfect will of god
[55:17] the westeros intending
[55:31] it's got to be in every single one of us
[55:37] brother branham says yes
[55:40] but what is unrighteousness
[55:43] it's righteousness perverted
[55:46] certainly the devil has a false thing
[55:51] what is it an old fortune teller out on
[55:53] the street
[55:57] a devil possessed person
[56:00] persona
[56:15] cabbages down cabbages on them
[56:19] but when we were when we're taught in
[56:21] the line of the bible
[56:25] then the holy spirit takes its place
[56:27] to santa thomas
[56:28] holy spirit takes it and places it into
[56:30] the church
[56:33] do you see then
[56:34] if you won't accept righteousness
[56:39] then unrighteousness will take over
[57:09] i didn't want to fully accept christ
[57:14] until the world took over
[57:17] i still wanted to do different things
[57:21] i still wanted to hang out with old
[57:23] friends
[57:35] because your old friends want you to do
[57:37] what they're doing
[57:53] now do we have friends of the world yes
[57:55] we are
[57:56] amigos
[57:57] but if christ is in us
[58:00] then we gotta shut the world out
[58:03] of
[58:04] whatever we can pay this world no mind
[58:06] no no
[58:35] you can't go out that door nope
[58:38] the same person you was coming in here
[58:42] you can't be
[58:44] the holy spirit brewing el espirito
[58:47] santo
[58:48] sombra wooing
[58:59] i will take away that stony heart
[59:15] amen god bless
[59:17] [Music]
[59:18] [Applause]
[1:00:12] hey man can you hear me
[1:00:15] i mean
[1:00:18] let's see if i can have each and every
[1:00:19] one of you stand please
[1:00:23] go straight into the words
[1:00:26] we can all open our scriptures open to
[1:00:28] luke chapter 7 verse starting with verse
[1:00:30] 36
[1:00:43] you know you hear the minister say it it
[1:00:45] sounds
[1:00:46] beautiful when you can hear the pages
[1:00:53] and when you're in the audience and
[1:00:54] you're the one turning your page
[1:00:57] [Music]
[1:00:58] at times it can feel like you're the
[1:00:59] only one turning your page
[1:01:04] but what a beautiful sound
[1:01:11] 7 36 reads like this
[1:01:16] and one of the pharisees desired him
[1:01:18] that he would eat with him
[1:01:21] and he went into the pharisees house and
[1:01:23] sat down to me
[1:01:28] [Music]
[1:01:32] before i get
[1:01:37] as started
[1:01:41] and behold a woman
[1:01:43] in the city which was a sinner
[1:01:45] when she knew that jesus sat at me in
[1:01:47] the pharisees house brought an alabaster
[1:01:50] box of ointment and stood i'm going to
[1:01:53] just go ahead and read in english to
[1:01:54] save a little bit of time
[1:01:56] and stood at his feet
[1:01:58] behind him weeping
[1:02:02] and began to wash his feet with tears
[1:02:05] and did wipe them with the hairs of her
[1:02:07] head
[1:02:08] and kissed his feet
[1:02:10] and anointed them with the ointment
[1:02:12] now
[1:02:13] when the pharisee which had bitten him
[1:02:16] saw it
[1:02:17] he spake within
[1:02:19] himself
[1:02:21] saying
[1:02:24] this man
[1:02:26] again you got to catch it's a thought
[1:02:28] he's thinking to himself this man
[1:02:31] if he were a prophet
[1:02:33] would have known
[1:02:35] who and what manner of woman this is
[1:02:37] that toucheth him
[1:02:39] for she is a sinner
[1:02:42] and you can
[1:02:49] [Music]
[1:02:59] and jesus
[1:03:01] answering said unto him
[1:03:05] so the previous scripture is this
[1:03:06] pharisee thought with in himself
[1:03:12] and jesus being the prophet that he was
[1:03:15] captures the thoughts
[1:03:20] and answers openly
[1:03:24] said unto him
[1:03:26] simon
[1:03:27] simon
[1:03:28] i have somewhat to say
[1:03:31] unto thee
[1:03:34] and he
[1:03:35] say it master
[1:03:40] there was a certain creditor which had
[1:03:43] two debtors the one owed 500 pence and
[1:03:46] the other 50.
[1:03:52] and when they had nothing to pay
[1:03:55] he frankly forgave them both
[1:03:58] tell me
[1:03:59] therefore
[1:04:01] which of them
[1:04:03] will love him
[1:04:04] most
[1:04:08] deep
[1:04:09] while they used
[1:04:12] answered and said i suppose that he to
[1:04:15] whom he forgave most
[1:04:17] and he said unto him
[1:04:19] thou has rightly judged
[1:04:36] and he turned to the woman
[1:04:52] thou this woman
[1:04:55] i entered into thine house
[1:04:57] casa thou gave me no water for my feet
[1:05:00] you know
[1:05:02] but she hath washed my feet with tears
[1:05:05] and wiped them with the hairs of her
[1:05:08] head
[1:05:13] thou gave me no kiss
[1:05:17] but this woman since the time i came in
[1:05:20] hath not ceased to kiss my feet
[1:05:26] my head with oil they'll dint they'll
[1:05:28] ditch not anoint but this woman
[1:05:31] has anointed my feet with ointment no
[1:05:34] histamise
[1:05:48] which
[1:06:19] i know it may not make seem like it
[1:06:21] makes sense
[1:06:25] because that's all i could think this
[1:06:26] doesn't make sense that doesn't go
[1:06:28] together
[1:06:44] and i'm going to read this just in
[1:06:45] english
[1:06:47] in english
[1:06:54] and this is talking on the story of
[1:06:55] samson by the way
[1:07:00] but the philistines took him
[1:07:02] and put his and put out his eyes and
[1:07:04] brought him down to gaza
[1:07:06] and bound him with fetters of brass and
[1:07:08] he did grind in the prison house
[1:07:11] how be it the hair of his head began to
[1:07:14] grow again
[1:07:15] after he was shaven
[1:07:17] then the lords of the philistines
[1:07:19] gathered them together for to offer a
[1:07:22] great sacrifice unto dagon their god
[1:07:25] and to rejoice for they said our god
[1:07:28] hath delivered samson our enemy into our
[1:07:32] hand
[1:07:34] and when the people saw him they praised
[1:07:37] their god for they said our god hath
[1:07:39] delivered into our hands our enemy
[1:07:42] and the destroyer of our country which
[1:07:45] slew many of us
[1:07:47] and it came to pass when the hearts when
[1:07:49] their hearts were married that they said
[1:07:52] call for samson
[1:07:54] that he may that he may make a sport and
[1:07:57] they called for samson out of the prison
[1:07:59] house and he made them sport and they
[1:08:01] set him between the pillars
[1:08:03] and if you interpret me from 26
[1:08:06] and samson said unto the lad that held
[1:08:09] him by the hand suffer me that i may
[1:08:12] feel the pillars were upon the house
[1:08:14] standeth that i may lean upon them
[1:08:26] now the house was full of men and women
[1:08:29] and all the lords of the philistines
[1:08:31] were there and they were upon the roof
[1:08:34] about 3 000 men and women that be held
[1:08:37] while samson made support
[1:08:49] and this is the key right here
[1:08:52] and samson called unto the lord
[1:08:57] and said
[1:08:58] oh lord god
[1:09:01] remember me
[1:09:02] i pray thee
[1:09:04] and strengthen me
[1:09:06] i pray thee
[1:09:08] only this once
[1:09:10] oh god that i may
[1:09:12] that i may be at once avenged the
[1:09:15] philistines for my two eyes
[1:09:33] and samson took hold of
[1:09:35] the two middle pillars upon which the
[1:09:37] house stood and on which it was born up
[1:09:40] of the one with his right hand and of
[1:09:42] the other with his left
[1:09:44] hand
[1:09:46] [Music]
[1:09:55] and samson said
[1:09:57] let me die with the philistines
[1:10:05] and he bowed himself
[1:10:07] with all his might and the house fell
[1:10:10] upon the lords and upon all the people
[1:10:12] that were therein
[1:10:20] so the dead which he slew at his death
[1:10:24] were more than they which he slew in his
[1:10:26] life
[1:10:30] [Music]
[1:10:32] amen and you may be serious
[1:10:45] now i want to ask one question
[1:10:49] concerning the first scripture we read
[1:10:55] who do you identify with
[1:11:14] which approach
[1:11:16] to the lord jesus christ to the lord
[1:11:18] jesus christ excuse me who i identify
[1:11:20] with
[1:11:30] do we identify with the pharisees
[1:11:35] or do we identify with her
[1:11:38] or no
[1:11:44] i remember a certain
[1:11:46] a certain message that was preached by
[1:11:48] one of our brothers by brother danny
[1:11:51] played
[1:11:53] and it had such an impact on my life
[1:11:58] when he talked about the good samaritan
[1:12:02] i don't know if many of you remember it
[1:12:03] or not no much
[1:12:12] but jesus in the book of luke pero jesus
[1:12:16] lucas talks about a certain man going
[1:12:18] from jerusalem to jericho
[1:12:21] [Music]
[1:12:46] and those two did nothing yes
[1:13:16] that saw
[1:13:25] and one of the things that struck me in
[1:13:26] that message
[1:13:29] is that one time
[1:13:31] we were all three
[1:13:35] one time we have we don't want nothing
[1:13:37] to do with it
[1:13:38] [Music]
[1:13:43] at another
[1:13:44] time maybe we'll check it out
[1:13:51] and the third person
[1:13:54] committed completely
[1:13:57] and so i say that
[1:13:59] in this regard who do we
[1:14:01] identify with in this first story
[1:14:10] have we been coming to church
[1:14:13] [Music]
[1:14:41] do i look down
[1:14:42] upon those at the altar
[1:14:45] [Music]
[1:14:48] do i look down at the center los miros
[1:14:51] pecadores
[1:14:58] you know one of the observations that
[1:15:00] i've seen
[1:15:02] the wrath of the bible
[1:15:05] is that the lord's
[1:15:07] people
[1:15:08] is
[1:15:21] i read it and i read it and i read it
[1:15:25] and i hear message after message
[1:15:28] i come to service i hear sermon after
[1:15:30] sermon
[1:15:34] and not at one time have i ever heard a
[1:15:37] minister say or a tape say or the bible
[1:15:40] read that the philistines and god's
[1:15:41] people were friends
[1:15:46] with
[1:15:50] you
[1:16:00] put out his eyes bound him kept him
[1:16:02] prisoner and then mocked him as they
[1:16:03] made a great sacrifice to their own
[1:16:06] [Music]
[1:16:11] now with the story of samson
[1:16:14] we have to think
[1:16:16] about ourselves
[1:16:32] you take the first story
[1:16:35] you take the second story
[1:16:37] and we have to understand it
[1:16:42] that we are not just one person
[1:16:45] a person
[1:17:16] just like the israelites were with the
[1:17:17] philistines
[1:17:22] and you can find that in romans chapter
[1:17:23] 7 if you want to write that down
[1:17:28] in 1956 on august the 14th
[1:17:33] brother preaches the message entitled
[1:17:34] divine love
[1:17:36] and sovereign grace
[1:17:40] and he says this now did you realize
[1:18:21] i have to be able to distinguish
[1:18:24] this thing
[1:18:31] are similar to the scriptures we read
[1:18:38] the
[1:18:51] my flesh doesn't want to serve the
[1:19:06] it's like a
[1:19:30] now i can only speak for myself
[1:19:36] how many times
[1:19:38] this is
[1:19:39] have i failed
[1:19:43] and as i asked myself
[1:19:48] again
[1:19:50] how many times have i failed the lord
[1:19:53] jesus christ
[1:20:01] especially when you're honest
[1:20:02] especially
[1:20:07] you know i know brother jerry
[1:20:09] mentioned the
[1:20:10] the influences and and the old friends
[1:20:15] you know
[1:20:17] amigos which prompts me to my next
[1:20:19] question
[1:20:22] how many times have i allowed myself to
[1:20:24] be in the wrong company just like samson
[1:20:29] is
[1:20:43] how many times have we allowed ourselves
[1:20:49] to be in the company
[1:20:52] estar in the company
[1:20:54] with the wrong people
[1:21:08] and he didn't give in right away
[1:21:11] he didn't give in right away enough
[1:21:15] and you can go back into judges and you
[1:21:17] can read the story
[1:21:19] [Music]
[1:21:20] but how many times
[1:21:23] this is
[1:21:25] the delilah ask him the
[1:21:40] this is how
[1:21:54] oh
[1:22:00] [Music]
[1:22:07] hey guys what's going on
[1:22:22] bro
[1:22:34] why do we allow ourselves to maintain
[1:22:36] ourselves in that company
[1:22:42] i'll never forget a message our brother
[1:22:43] tommy jr preached
[1:22:47] when he says before me are set two doors
[1:23:18] but if you want
[1:23:20] i got some for you too
[1:23:32] oh you take this
[1:24:00] i feel undeserving
[1:24:03] worthless
[1:24:06] i question everything
[1:24:10] am i a son of god
[1:24:14] hanging out with these people
[1:24:19] children of god don't do this this and
[1:24:21] that
[1:24:22] is
[1:24:30] how many trials
[1:24:32] one does
[1:24:33] have we gone through
[1:24:35] how many temptations have we faced
[1:24:42] but i want to tell you one thing
[1:24:46] i want you to understand that it's a
[1:24:48] test
[1:24:51] it's a test
[1:24:54] and in a test
[1:25:25] now god doesn't tempt man
[1:25:34] god tries
[1:25:36] men
[1:26:06] god keeps his word preaching the same
[1:26:07] year of 1957
[1:26:14] the testing time
[1:26:18] the testing time come for the lutheran
[1:26:19] church
[1:26:46] that you can ever know that you're
[1:26:57] [Music]
[1:27:03] that's right
[1:27:06] don't take nothing less
[1:27:10] or nothing
[1:27:12] in the same year brother brandon
[1:27:14] preaches the message then jesus came in
[1:27:19] and he stays in paragraph 58 and there's
[1:27:22] always a testing time
[1:27:26] every song that cometh to god
[1:27:29] must first be tested
[1:27:35] oh
[1:27:36] i love it
[1:27:39] oh i don't call for it
[1:27:43] but after it's passed
[1:28:03] through the ages went through that
[1:28:05] testing time
[1:28:09] we must learn
[1:28:11] i must learn
[1:28:22] and we have to make that conscientious
[1:28:24] decision it
[1:28:26] is
[1:29:10] make your confession aggressive
[1:29:12] breathe out
[1:29:15] once more
[1:29:18] because a lot of people
[1:29:21] will come to church being a legalistic
[1:29:23] they'll give their life to the lord
[1:29:24] dance
[1:29:26] they'll get baptized
[1:29:28] and then life hits him
[1:29:32] and then the testing time comes
[1:29:36] and the doubts come in
[1:29:38] and the questioning of it
[1:29:41] am i a son of god
[1:29:44] how can i be an elected son of god
[1:30:04] and this is for those who are still
[1:30:06] hanging out with worldly friends
[1:30:14] my dad took me aside one
[1:30:16] [Music]
[1:30:18] time and i told them what i was doing
[1:30:24] told them where i was going to be
[1:30:25] [Music]
[1:30:26] and i told them about what time i would
[1:30:28] be home
[1:30:32] and i was going through a difficult time
[1:30:34] in my life
[1:30:36] we've all been there
[1:30:38] we've all had to pass through the trial
[1:30:42] and my father told me
[1:30:45] he goes you know before you go son
[1:30:49] i want to share something
[1:30:56] you're a master of the sky
[1:30:58] i'm sorry you're a master of disguise
[1:31:14] us
[1:31:28] uh they think
[1:31:31] uspinson
[1:31:33] they think jospiensen that you're one of
[1:31:36] them
[1:31:41] want that to sink in
[1:31:51] and one of these days you know
[1:31:55] sooner rather than later
[1:32:21] one of the things that brother jerry
[1:32:23] struggled with i struggled with as well
[1:32:26] [Music]
[1:32:34] i think i would be considered an
[1:32:36] alcoholic by today's needs
[1:32:46] [Music]
[1:32:51] and i see my so-called friends over
[1:32:53] there
[1:32:55] um
[1:32:57] and i had an out-of-body experience
[1:33:03] i i'm not making this up i promise you
[1:33:06] no mr inventando
[1:33:19] and i saw myself sitting on the couch
[1:33:25] and i saw the people at the table
[1:33:27] [Music]
[1:33:29] and then the words played
[1:33:31] in my mind
[1:33:32] [Music]
[1:33:34] i heard
