oh okay there we go God bless you everyone so this uh special Bears a bit of an introduction and the reason being is that we're doing something a little bit different we've been anticipating and expecting this project to come to fruition and finally is here but uh a couple months back I talked to our pastor about an inspiration the lord gave me that is specifically designed for you all it is is a a labor of love on my behalf and it is a project where in short summary we would like to write a series of new hymns inspired and based entirely off of all of you so if you've ever had a scripture or a story or a message or a subject that you've always wanted a song about but you've never had one now is your time and so be meditating about this and thinking about it because uh I will be calling you soon and uh as we meet me together and we talk I'll get uh your what you would like and we'll transform it into a new hymn that we'll be able to sing here in church and uh and put forward for from now until until the end and so uh We've uh we've been composing a few pieces and we finally got one that's ready to go and uh the project is called The Ballad of Believers and so you all will be the ballad and it is specifically uh for you so on that note today's song is titled what is man and it was inspired by Psalms uh 8 3-9 and I might just read it here if we can go quickly but uh I would like to thank Seth and Felipe and Ruth for helping me compose this song I can't write music so uh I can only write lyrics but not compositions so I'd like to thank them and uh you know honestly everybody's ready why don't we just sing this thing and I'm sure you all have a Bible and you can read psalms 8 3-9 on your own but this piece is inspired by the psalmist David Avid and I like to look at this song like a connection between the two times we have David writing in the past talking about the great galaxies and everything that he would see then and we have me writing back to him here meeting him halfway and bringing what was then to now so I pray that this blesses you and uh and you enjoy [Applause] it when I look upon the Stars I see his glory that beauty is shining bright just like his face when I see the moon this great Celestial body the bride exemplified before all men ordained and placed within your heavenly places your painting art for all to see what is

I want to thank the Lord for this opportunity that he gives me of being able to be here and break the bread for his people want to thank my pastor my general the opportunity to speak to him yesterday

gener you have the best sheep people reported to service and we give thanks to God so I I would like to invite you this precious morning put everything [Music] aside and for a brief moment let me help your faith let me remind you what this precious blessed message that was brought by a prophet for by by a a major prophet for William BR by William Mariam brandham makes us the only Power that Satan has listen to this the only Power that Satan has is the one that we give him he has no more power the more that we know about ourselves and about our position less power will the enemy have to use against him we open the Bible in Hebrews chapter 10 verse one want to amp if I uh and bring a little bit more of information as Christians just just think about one thing one way or another the animal the the enemy has a grasp of our lives in one way or another some are going through pain through sufferings some are struggling in their marriage others their children are out in the world with others your econom is not so good it's one thing or another now imagine for a moment bringing the ministry of Joshua where God promises to Joshua and he tells him fight with with every battle he will have a victory and it will be Victory after Victory after victory until there is peace in the camp the Holy Spirit last year showed me I won't include you I'll I'll take it personal how I took this serpent a a black mamba and I grabbed it by its neck and and and I held it I took it and I took it out of a room and I threw it out far now think for a moment now I know that this belongs to the church when you say brother dieo you're speaking of the church yes brother because I'm speaking of myself I am the church the church it is not the four walls when I speak about the church in part I'm not speaking I'm speaking about myself when I saw that I took out the serpent out of this place taking it out of the church I was taking this serpent out out of the life of brother Diego and I'm telling you that if you believe this promise is also for you so that you can take Satan with your hand take him from the throat and take him out because that is a promise for the children of God I I I'm waiting on that and we we're beginning to see it if you could please stand Hebrews chapter 10 verse1 says says for the law having a shadow of good things to come I'll repeat it and please catch this for the law having a shadow of good things to come I will tell you a truth I love the word there Goods good things I love that because it's telling me something that belongs to me but the law it was only a shadow but through the shadow it can give me an understanding of what those goods are for me says and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offer year by year continually make the comers there on to perfect let us pray Lord Jesus Christ very good morning Lord take control Lord teach us Beed us heal us restore us baptize us Lord that all this may be done for the honor and please take your seat if today you tell me brother I heard you preach today and I think I failed I failed I said Lord Lord give me Grace have mercy upon me and give me Grace Lord that they may see Christ because a Pulpit it's not for people to show themselves a Pulpit it's not for people to see what you have a Pulpit is for the people can see Christ can see Christ through those that play the violin to see Christ those that play the organ to see Christ through the one that's song leading then they will see Christ through the preacher if that is not achiev then we have failed the law having a shadow I'll take a character and I like Moses very much Carlos when I heard this brother a a question came came to me because Moses and I I I am wonder how he speaks about certain things a man that God has given him wisdom now Moses Not only was he a wise man when I see Moses I can see the ministry the greatest Ministry that has appeared in the old T there is not one like the ministry of Moses a man that produced more miracles a man that produced most signs me a man that that produced the most and the most wonders a man that could see things God showed this man heaven and he could bring things to Earth he saw in heaven but did you know this man he had a a disability this man he had a complex he was a stutter he he he he he spoke like this now you can imagine a man that brought all these wonders and and I ask myself God never healed him could God not heal Moses when God calls Moses he gives him the commission the first thing that Moses says he says Lord I I ask you that you send another I cannot speak I don't know how to speak send another when I read the Bible God tells Moses who who made the D who made the blind who made the death you know before when I saw a blind man from birth I would say it was the devil and the death they were born death oh it was the devil thanks to God for his Mercy because I see here that it was not the devil God Did It For What when they asked Jesus master who sinned for him to be blind his his parents no it was not his parents oh was it him it wasn't him either then who sinned and Jesus tells him neither his parents nor did he sin but these are the works that God predestined before the foundation of the world so that in the books it would be written that God gave sight to the blind from birth then if you young people if you have a limitation oh brother you know I'm I'm too skinny oh I'm too fat I'm Too Tall and I hit the door I'm too short brother this this and that that is not an excuse when you surrender yourself to God if God could use a man with a stutter a man with a disability a man with a physical disability how will he not be God how will God not use anyone surrender to his will God says that he takes that which is not to to to put to shame what is you know why God does that you know why God did not heal Moses being able to do it because God wanted that each time that Moses spoke he would remember that it was not him that it was God doing the work Hallelujah each time that Moses spoke he knew that he was a limited man but when he could rest in God he was not a man that was limited he was a God the Bible says he was a god I want us to go to the scripture we'll go to De Deuteronomy or excuse me we'll go to Exodus 4 verse 12 Exodus 4 verse2 and the scripture says [Applause] God speaking to Moses says now therefore go now please this is not a a story this is a shadow this is what Diego Caston has to reflect there Moses reflected something it wasn't the image it was the shadow but that shadow projected an image for this time here is the very image here is the very image of what Moses reflected back there Exodus 4:12 now there go I will be with thy mouth God he tells Moses go I will be with thy mouth now that was a shadow and if I am the image [Music] that makes me feel special it's what this message has brought to my life it makes me special brother Diego what are you talking about there is a special lady there's very precious l with all due respect but there is one that is special when the service ends she goes to me and this is what brother BR says when I'm bringing this so that she the one that was purchased know that she is special I will be with thy mouth that was a shadow now you understand an how Hannah she comes to the temple and and she was being troubled and she suffered lots of bullying she could not have children and she came to the temple there was the the the priest Eli seeing that that lady and Eli says this this woman she got drunk and he goes up to her and says he says woman this is not a time to be drinking please go we you can't be here an now Hannah says no my Lord I'm just a troubled woman how many troubled women women do we have here how many do we have how how many troubled women are there when the priest realizes this she's a woman groaning in the spirit and watch what he says says Hannah may God give to you the petition of your heart the miracle of Hannah was not in heaven the miracle of Hannah was in the mouth of the priest I will be with thy mouth I will be with thy mouth the miracle came when the priest let loose the word Hannah receive it Hannah I bless you Hannah take what is yours do you understand when God told Moses I will be with thy mouth I I have a question now I'll I'll tell you this perhaps I I may be wrong and if I am I would like to be corrected come with scriptures and tell me brother Diego that's not so come with the messengers and tell me brother Diego right because I being sincere in what I'm going to say it catches my attention here reading this the the the the story of Moses let us go to Exodus chapter 7 x Exodus 71 and let's read this together remember this is the Shadow and the Lord said unto Moses I have made thee a God to pharaoh and Aaron thy brother shall be thy Prophet not my Prophet it shall be thy Prophet not my Prophet because a prophet of God thus sayth the Lord my question Moses your brother Aaron shall be thy prophet then when Aaron would go before Pharaoh he would not go with us say Lord he would go and he would go Pharaoh th say Moses the the the god of Israel that I am has appeared let the people go wow wow now this was a Shadow because of this was the reason they killed Jesus when Jesus came onto the scene Jesus said my father and I the religious people said hold on hold on your father God and you you say he's your father your you are his son if God has a son and he would have to be another God Jesus that's that's that's a blasphemy and they took up Stones the Bible say to Stone him and Jesus says hold on is it not written in your law says that God God said ye are Gods ye are gods un to whom the word of God came then why do you want to kill me if the prophets whom the word came were were made Gods then why I that say my father and I you want to kill me this message it came from the mouth of God this message it was brought by a prophet and the word cannot be broken then if the word came to the prophet not just any Prophet but a major prophet a scriptural prophet and this message that came to the prophet made him a man that could tell a storm be still are you ready if this man bring squirrels into existence what what did it do what was it that made brother Brandon bring things for the message that was given unto him put him in position to be the first son of this generation as the wave offering the the first fruit the the first fruits what what made him tell me who can create who can create God it was not him it was God our in our messenger producing what the sh was pointing to now amen Amen brother brother but brother Bram is no longer here in this message that produced the same in a Prophet this message it came to brother Diego put your name there if you put it to your neighbor then you count yourself out if this message that came through a prophet put you in a position to speak the word now this message has come into my heart and has taken me to a position where I have brother it's my duty my obligation to produce the same that produced there because the shadow is what is what the shadow tells me and here goes Moses uh before Pharaoh I'll make a drama and perhaps I'll make you laugh so especially the young people can understand understand I not trying to mock any anybody did you know that Egypt and Pharaoh represented the The Crib of civilization in in that time pharaoh they believe he was the the the son of the god R and that made him a God because he was the son of a God and that's what the Egyptians believed so then Pharaoh he was the god in flesh he was the representative of their God before the people of isra he was a God he had on his right hand all the witches and magicians the little which you see there that reads cards no real deal prove that to you go to the scripture in Exodus chapter 7 verse 9 I want to take off but I can't this is important uh chapter 7 verse 9 and here's God speaking when Pharaoh shall speak unto you show a miracle for you Pharaoh when Moses comes coming saying he's representing I am Pharaoh understands the language if we're speaking of gods here we're not including the human race because there's no virtue or power in them Moses you come with your God I have mine show me a miracle show me your God show me the power of your God and there it says when Pharaoh challenges Moses Moses throws the rod comes a serpent what a miracle what what a sign baroh didn't have hair I told he'd make you laugh this is a waste of time Moses you six come over here those that had their rod they they would they would throw their they turned into serpents but listen because this is a fight it's a battle and the idea is to Prevail to Prevail to Prevail is that when someone is fighting he that can withstand is the one who will win there was five six against one here comes Moses serpent he says Moses don't get nervous calm down leave this to me and he get all of them ask Pharaoh if he has more because I'm still hungry Barrow he was he he couldn't speak he was speechless hey come throw down all and I imagine these magicians and they all threw down their rods and the serpent there eating each one of them the serpent tell it tells Moses there's another 50 there Pharaoh got got angry he got angry because the sign of Moses prevailed before The Magicians this is where the challenge begins when Moses makes the first sign I'm bringing Revelation when he does the first sign he turns the water into blood the The Magicians they do the same thing they imitated the first sign then Moses comes brings the the the second plague the frogs he says I'm not impressed he calls his magicians produces they imitate the second sign but wait here comes Moses with the third Sign Here Comes Moses the third Miracle he brings life fleed into existence you bring sple into existence and The Magicians try to do it they realize that they couldn't this third they could not imitate it I imagine The Magicians saying buddy we have problems what are we going to tell pharaoh houon Houston we have a problem the scripture brother let's go to Exodus 819 and this is what I wanted to bring you right here now listen this is where I wanted to bring you here are The Magicians they go into Pharaoh Satan testifying to sat here comes the scene they could not imitate the third sign and here they come worried who's going to tell Pharaoh who's going to tell Pharaoh what does the scripture say then The Magicians said unto Pharaoh what does it say brother finger what does it say say finger Finger of God is this this is the Finger of God Satan testifies that God is using one of his fingers one of his ministries Finger of God is this we can't he's a superior God if God could do all these Miracles with a finger not just any finger a limited finger a finger that was a stutter a finger that had an incapacity God prove to the devil that with one of his fingers he has the power in him to make tear hell to Pieces Jesus he said these words we'll be finishing and we'll go to Luke 11:20 and we'll finish with this Luke 11:20 we'll read it I'll read it from there now there is Jesus speaking but if I with the Finger of God I cast out now it's not brother Diego I'm speaking of Jesus cast out Devils I know you haven't understand come here brother everyone can see you brother would you please help me stand right here I have one I had two I have one more please there we have three one more four the last one we have five now we have five here's Jesus now God has a hand what is the hand of God the ministry Ephesians 41 brother BR said it many times now here we have the Apostle we have the Apostle we have the Prophet evangelist the teacher and we have the pastor now here's Jesus and he says if I jesus if I jesus it doesn't say I the Evangelist I the prophet if I Jesus cast out Satan by the Finger of God which one I don't know because he gave some Apostles others prophets other evangelists other pastors and teachers Jesus says if I cast out devils if I with the Finger of God cast out Devils now come here this is an example he's sick he has a very serious problem in his spine my precious brother here's the hand of God I want to ask you which of the fingers of God because you have the privilege to choose some Churches don't have that privilege here in Las Cru we have the privilege to choose which Finger of God will make us free my friend finger would you like for God to heal your sickness do you like the apostle no I don't I don't like his face I want to get your attention oh look at the prophet you like the prophet oh what about the Evangelist oh he's fire what about the teacher or or the pastor which finger would you like for I jesus that have sent my hand to heal you which one by the prophet sit down my friends sit down if if God could do that back then how much more here we take that serpent that God showed I will take that serpent by the hand I'll take it out of my life if I take it out of my life the people of God will be so much stronger the devil's a bluffer now look let me stand right brother you me stand look and stay there standing my pastor called me last night to ask me how everything was going I said everything's going well we have people they're always attentive uh offering everything's good and I tell my pastor said Caleb are you prepared for I'm for what I'm going to tell you the Lord shows me in Poland this this and that is happening I'm helping your faith I'm I'm bringing bringing you from where you are to bring you to Heavenly places now says that's exactly right that's what's happening that is discernment I'm revealing things that are happening I said now look what will happen that is
