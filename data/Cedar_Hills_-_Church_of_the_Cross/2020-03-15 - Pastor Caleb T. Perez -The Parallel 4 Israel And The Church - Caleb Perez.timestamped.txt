[3:26] Lord that it would take root in their

[3:31] open to you Lord and that we would
[3:33] receive abundantly above measure what we
[3:36] could ever ask of Lord Lord we ask all
[3:39] these things we place this service in
[3:42] your hands Lord and we place our lives
[3:44] in your hands this morning in Jesus name
[3:47] Amen you may be seated
[3:49] we'll be hearing the rest of demonology
[3:52] this morning god bless you
[4:21] to him as he spake to me for the Lord
[4:25] has written his kingdom out of the hands
[4:28] and has given it unto even daisen now
[4:33] many of his familiar with this how we
[4:35] want to go right in and God help us now
[4:37] for the a few moments to get into this
[4:41] now watch
[4:43] there was a man Saul who was once
[4:48] considered a prophet for he prophesied
[4:52] with the prophets is that right teachers
[4:54] now I hear the man was back slidden is
[4:57] that right but remember where Samuel
[5:00] said he would be with him at the next
[5:02] day prematurely gone see alright you
[5:05] won't mind God God will take you off the
[5:07] earth look in the Corinthian letter
[5:09] they're hot Paul set those people in
[5:11] order he said first I thank God for you
[5:13] that there's no such things among and so
[5:16] forth and how that as you come shorter
[5:18] no spiritual gift telling them what they
[5:19] was positionally in Christ then he begin
[5:22] to let the hammer down on them tell them
[5:24] about their women preachers and how they
[5:25] were doing and how they were eating at
[5:27] the Lord's table and even one man living
[5:29] with his stepmother and he said to this
[5:32] name in Christ turn him over to the
[5:36] devil for the destructions of the flesh
[5:37] that the soul might be saved that's it
[5:40] turn him over the Bible said for this
[5:42] cause many are sick and weakly among in
[5:44] matter sleep gone on prematurely because
[5:46] of sin God taking you out of the way
[5:48] good sign you was a Christian it is
[5:50] taken so now notice in year Saul was
[5:55] considered one of the prophets are among
[5:58] the prophets because he prophesied and
[6:00] now he had back slid because he
[6:03] disobeyed God and his kingdom was ran
[6:05] out of his hands and placed into the
[6:07] hands of David through God had anointed
[6:10] by Samuel with the cruciform notice then
[6:15] there was three ways that they had of
[6:18] finding out things from God the first
[6:21] was was the prophet
[6:24] the second was a dream and the third was
[6:26] the Ihram efendim and they neither would
[6:31] answer now you know what a prophet is
[6:34] you're a lot of spiritual dream is and
[6:36] you know what the year and the funding
[6:39] was you know what the other day I asked
[6:40] and then what about the Yerba and that
[6:43] man couldn't tell me what it was
[6:45] the Ihram of London of course was God
[6:48] answer but he see and the devil makes
[6:50] the counterfeit of every one of those
[6:52] the wizard the false prophet and the
[6:54] crystal glazier see now the Urim of
[6:57] thunder hormones Aaron's breast here and
[7:00] the Urim and Thummim covered over that
[7:01] stones and they hung it in the temple
[7:04] and when there wasn't sure they go
[7:06] before God an answer and a light but
[7:08] flash on that year a month on them which
[7:10] was well it was God's will or not now
[7:12] when the Urim of thunder moon answer now
[7:15] that was the direct answer from God
[7:18] now the Urim of thunder of today the
[7:21] fortune-teller took a crystal ball to
[7:23] pattern at a false thing gods in a
[7:27] trinity God's powers as in a Trinity and
[7:29] the Devils in a trinity and his powers
[7:32] as in Trinity now I can prove this by
[7:34] the viable and that year in the Sun um
[7:37] there was only the crystal balls the
[7:39] devil uses today and the false prophet
[7:42] back here today the one that we have now
[7:45] was our The Witcher the fortune teller
[7:48] out on earth took the place of the
[7:50] Prophet on the devil's side see what I
[7:54] mean now then the Urim and Thummim today
[7:59] is dis Bible if somebody has a give a
[8:04] prophecy or a dream and it don't compare
[8:07] a reco with God's Bible is false don't
[8:10] believe it a man come to me not long ago
[8:13] from India were mystics them to go a
[8:15] fine little preacher he said brother
[8:17] Rama I come over here said a woman had
[8:18] the Holy Ghost and said she was just a
[8:20] sweetest nicest woman he said and she's
[8:24] been married four times it was living
[8:25] with her fourth husband and I said well
[8:28] how could that be Lord and said I went
[8:29] to him and said Old Glory that gods that
[8:31] hallelu
[8:32] you praise the Lord just one of that's
[8:33] high to know that out of loo you praise
[8:35] the Lord
[8:36] so the Lord told me Jericho gave you
[8:38] dreams and said ah dreams at my wife
[8:40] I've seen her living in adultery and she
[8:42] come back to me and said all was you for
[8:44] Jimmie Victor was you for Jimmie I did
[8:47] why I said sure I'll forgive you take
[8:48] you back
[8:49] he said now that's what I did said CI
[8:51] for you I said Victor your dream was
[8:54] mighty lovely but the devil give it to
[8:56] you he said why I said don't compare
[8:59] with God's Word she's living in adultery
[9:02] absolutely she can't live with for man
[9:05] right she leaves that and goes back to
[9:08] her first she's worse off than she was
[9:09] beginning chefs live single the rest of
[9:10] her life I said you know that don't
[9:13] compare with God's Word so heard your
[9:16] dream was false and I said it won't
[9:19] compare with this and when a prophet I
[9:21] had a a give a prophecy and they spoke
[9:23] in morning she that prophecy was true
[9:25] they put it before the year of a Sunda
[9:27] and as a voice of God sold the lights on
[9:29] the Urim asunder
[9:30] then it was absolute the truth and if a
[9:33] man gives an interpretation gives a
[9:35] dream give something of the Bible and or
[9:37] something other and it don't compare
[9:39] with God's Bible it's false
[9:41] there's the Urim of funding today God's
[9:44] Word speaks annex direct the voice of
[9:46] God like a year of a thunder was before
[9:48] the Bible was written Hey I feel Kyra
[9:52] lidge's right now I don't take the air
[9:54] of fanatic if you do it I know I were
[9:57] mad I'm not excited that's right here is
[10:01] the truth God's Word I don't care what
[10:04] type of dream you add or watch have a
[10:05] prophecy given if it isn't God's Word
[10:07] it's wrong so don't compare with that
[10:10] word that's what's of trouble a date one
[10:13] has a dream one a disease you want to
[10:14] have the tongue one has a revelation
[10:15] it's got the whole thing so messed up
[10:17] and everything you got denominations and
[10:19] broke up everything you ought to bring
[10:20] it back to a final foundation and that's
[10:23] God's Word that's true
[10:26] churches are built upon once at all
[10:28] Jesus come out on a white horse I know
[10:30] I've seen in a vision they make the
[10:31] Church of that time all hallelujah come
[10:33] on the cloud they make it in that time
[10:34] break them up the separating coal or
[10:36] another buzzards roost and let's hang
[10:39] out and everything like that
[10:40] why brother go shoshone
[10:42] first place your heart's not right with
[10:43] God when you do that right we were
[10:46] brothers we must stick by one another we
[10:52] need one another now I look solid back
[10:56] slid and he goes up you have got
[11:00] eternity face from him
[11:02] anyone up that he acquired with the
[11:04] prophets the prophets went and tried to
[11:06] prophesy and God put all foot and give a
[11:08] vision prophet coming up to the Hawking
[11:12] all he never told me nothing about you
[11:14] well then he said large give me a dream
[11:16] not extra night no dream come then he
[11:20] goes into the Yerba Thunder and he said
[11:21] oh god I've tried the prophets of God
[11:23] the dreams now you help me with you it
[11:26] cut it all no life flash at all then he
[11:31] resorted to a which low degraded and he
[11:39] went to her crawled in our disguised
[11:41] himself and this which goes out he calls
[11:44] up the spirit of Samuel I know what
[11:50] you're thinking they said that wasn't
[11:51] Samuel but the Bible said it was Samuel
[11:53] and it was Samuel strange I checked that
[11:58] is inconsistent but that was Samuel the
[12:02] Bible said it was and that which could
[12:04] call him up and she called up Samuel and
[12:07] Samuel was somewhere else but was
[12:11] conscious of what was going on and was
[12:13] still standing with his prophets man
[12:15] alone he so brother when you die you're
[12:19] not dead you're living somewhere
[12:21] somewhere else let me stop just a minute
[12:25] to get this demonology down just a
[12:28] little bit she was a demon but she was
[12:33] in close contact with a spirit world now
[12:37] today there's many spirits that know
[12:41] really more about the spiritual and
[12:43] people who profess themselves to be
[12:45] Christians yet she's a demon in the
[12:48] Bible times is the same thing when Jesus
[12:51] was here on earth there was an
[12:53] professors and scholars and teachers
[12:54] some of the best
[12:56] was are the better seminaries and we
[12:57] could produce today and wholly renowned
[13:01] man they had to be if a Levi for sound
[13:06] he had to be found blameless righteous
[13:10] in every way and yet that man known the
[13:13] more about God than our rabbit note
[13:15] about snowshoes when Jesus Johnny failed
[13:19] a recognizing and he called Jesus a
[13:22] devil
[13:23] he said he's Beelzebub the Prince of the
[13:25] devil
[13:26] is that right and here come the lowest
[13:29] type of a demon that had a man bound on
[13:33] the tombs and everything and they called
[13:35] out the devil himself that we know who
[13:37] you are you're the Son of God the Holy
[13:40] One is that right witches and wizards
[13:45] devils recognized him the son of God
[13:48] while educated Theological Seminary
[13:51] preachers recognized in the deed
[13:53] Beelzebub which was right the devil of
[13:56] the preachers the devil of and brother
[13:59] it hasn't changed too much today they
[14:03] don't recognize the power of God no
[14:07] matter how much teaching you got you can
[14:09] drum that into you
[14:10] God's not in big word gods an honest
[14:12] heart you might send your speak these
[14:15] words like I don't know a lot that
[14:17] doesn't bring you closer to God
[14:19] you can stand and practice how to preach
[14:21] your sermon and say these things that
[14:23] don't get you closer to God you can
[14:25] learn dictionary to you sleep with one
[14:27] and it still wouldn't get you closer to
[14:29] God I'll humble submitted heart and the
[14:32] simplicity is what brings you to God
[14:35] that's true amen
[14:39] humble heart God love now no matter if
[14:46] you don't know your ABCs that don't make
[14:48] any difference just a humble heart God
[14:53] dwells in a humble heart not an
[14:54] education fountain schools not in
[14:56] theology seminary not in all these other
[14:58] different places not in big words non
[15:00] classical places God dwells in human
[15:02] parts
[15:03] Knowle or you can break yourself down
[15:06] the more simple you can become greater
[15:08] in the side of God let me give you
[15:11] something I see your fields are full of
[15:13] weed out here a full head of wheat
[15:17] always bowels a little sprig sticks up
[15:21] there flopping around like it knows
[15:23] everything they got us in the haze
[15:24] that's the way of a lot of these guys
[15:27] that thinks you got a hold on your head
[15:28] nothing about the power recognized Jesus
[15:32] Christ as the Son of God and believe
[15:35] he's works and he's the same yesterday
[15:36] all these recognizing sure in a
[15:38] historical standpoint but it's not a
[15:41] history thing people set up their
[15:44] outreach Pentecost for there's a great
[15:47] outpouring and things like that and
[15:49] paint afar a freezin man can't be worn
[15:52] by a painted fire painted far don't
[15:55] wanna that's what they watch what is it
[15:57] today if he's the same yesterday today
[15:59] and forever that's painted far some
[16:03] fella freezin s they look at that big
[16:05] far their head like that don't get you
[16:06] warm
[16:07] what they did if they cost what they had
[16:09] in the early testament we got today and
[16:12] as soon as God can get the thing on down
[16:15] the church set together rapture will
[16:17] come but we Shane even get paid for
[16:19] divine healing let alone the rapture
[16:21] because we're all twisted up one this
[16:23] way and one that way dr. Sean saw said
[16:25] it was this what my preacher said he was
[16:28] this a while ago a woman said he's just
[16:30] a faker

[23:28] into the gallery like it's a man with a
[23:29] blue suit on one with a grade I said
[23:31] friends

[23:44] don't get down like that and are doing
[23:48] them big textures to go to warfare and
[23:49] grab ahold about to know brethren this
[23:51] is not a flesh and blood affair just set
[23:53] still God will take care then so now
[23:56] brethren look while you're up there look

[25:07] bulls and ghost was only a waiting for
[25:10] the time of fulfillment when a man died
[25:13] in them days preachers back now if you
[25:15] think it's right when a man died he died
[25:17] under the atonement of an animal and his
[25:20] soul went into paradise and there he
[25:23] stayed until that to the to the day of
[25:25] redemption and his soul was in there let

[27:01] out there we had 2700 people waiting to
[27:04] get prayed for standing out there you
[27:06] read the article and a man come down
[27:08] from Canada and he had a little boy that
[27:10] had been two males and John Hopkins of
[27:12] serious brain disease that drawer -
[27:14] little hands in my kiss and drawl his
[27:16] legs up under and they said there's not
[27:18] even an operation nothing can be done so
[27:20] he took it back to chanting said I'm not
[27:22] whip chip you get November's issue of
[27:24] the Reader's Digest and let's call it
[27:26] the miracle of Donnie Martin and they
[27:30] said that in there that's that the man
[27:34] said I'm not whipped yet they called I
[27:36] know a faith healer named William
[27:37] Branham that's calls two of my friends
[27:39] who was deaf and dumb to speak in here
[27:41] and if we they called or trying to find
[27:44] where was that in America yet and I was
[27:47] over to Costa Mesa California and it's
[27:49] just article when you read it get ready
[27:51] to cry it just break your heart how you
[27:53] went through snowdrifts and everything
[27:55] else was that baby he said be careful
[27:57] Donnie so now we're not defeated in
[27:59] little boys couldn't even smile hardly
[28:01] you're so afflicted so we're not
[28:02] defeated we're going to ask God
[28:04] we'll go to God's prophet and asked him
[28:07] so then they come to the snow
[28:09] and they finally got down there and the
[28:10] mother was coming with him and it didn't
[28:12] have money never go by airplanes so the
[28:14] sense of mother back and the boy and
[28:16] daddy had to come on a bus and have they
[28:18] rode all the way from Winnipeg Canada to
[28:21] Costa Mesa California and the guiding
[28:23] their broken the father tells out I had
[28:25] just changed the little diapers on this
[28:26] little boy about seven or eight years
[28:27] old it's perfect they help us and how he
[28:29] would couldn't get a chance to eat there
[28:31] nothing and said his little boy could
[28:32] just hear him talking he could tell away
[28:34] his eyes looked at he was he was trying
[28:36] to smile you know I know that is telling
[28:39] different sites she was seeing over in
[28:40] America and when they got in there to
[28:43] California they said to the travelers
[28:46] aid why do you come to scene he said
[28:47] come to see a divine wat the big
[28:49] question mark course you can imagine
[28:51] what America said about it you see
[28:52] that's up we so smart we know everything
[28:56] you know on there's no need telling us
[28:57] anything we got it all ro down see so
[29:00] then so a divine watch come always from
[29:03] Winnipeg candidate well they thought
[29:05] that was horrible
[29:05] anyhow the newspaper touched a car and
[29:09] sent him over there and he said when
[29:11] they got to the line where is that's the
[29:13] 2700 people is waiting to be prayed for
[29:15] but say when they seen that deformed
[29:17] little oven boy and that poor daddy with
[29:20] his tap on his ragged coat said
[29:22] everybody just stepped aside and give
[29:24] him his place when he hit the platform
[29:25] it's against the rules to swap a car
[29:27] prayer card
[29:28] somebody must come to the meeting and
[29:30] get your own card if they're ever caught
[29:31] the line swapping prayer cards on
[29:33] somebody else the prayer cards
[29:35] dishonored see because you must come
[29:38] here the instructions to know how to
[29:39] receive it it's up to you you can't get
[29:42] it for someone else yet come get it
[29:44] yourself so you you're some big persons
[29:47] that are out I don't believe notes in
[29:49] this thing but maybe if you heal me I
[29:51] you see and then that causes the fuss at
[29:53] the platform so they just call that
[29:55] thing out before he gets there so when
[29:56] the boy started a father started on the
[29:58] platform ahead of the people Billy asked
[30:00] him for his prayer card he didn't have
[30:02] any said then I'm sorry sir said you'll
[30:05] have to wait you said alright so now
[30:07] wait said I'll just take my turn like
[30:08] the others and said I didn't know I had
[30:09] to do this and so I was talking to
[30:12] someone I had to hear it I've seen that
[30:14] father go away not to what was the
[30:15] marriage said he didn't have a prayer
[30:16] card then something sent me bringing
[30:18] back so I said bring him here
[30:22] and the father come up in the tears
[30:23] running down his face kneading shaving
[30:26] and he walked up and here's the Reader's
[30:29] Digest that this guy asked no questions
[30:32] but look right straight in the face the
[30:34] baby told a baby where it was from it
[30:37] had been two males clinic all about what
[30:39] was the matter with it how sick it had
[30:41] been and everything and so the father
[30:42] started crying and started to leave and
[30:45] said he started on four platform and he
[30:47] turned around he said that's right sir
[30:48] he said but will my baby ever live I
[30:51] said that I can't say I said just the
[30:54] moment I've seen a vision of here I said
[30:58] you won't want to believe this because
[31:00] males and Hopkins both said that
[31:01] operation couldn't be performed on that
[31:03] brain but I'll tell what you do you
[31:07] tomorrow you just go ahead with this
[31:10] baby within the next three days you're
[31:12] going to meet a black headed woman on
[31:15] the street and that woman's going to ask
[31:17] you watch the match that baby and then
[31:19] she's gonna tell you of some little
[31:21] country doctor out here that can perform
[31:23] that operation and you won't want to
[31:26] believe it because that males turned it
[31:28] down and says impossible to be done but
[31:31] that's the only chance your baby has to
[31:33] the power of God the mercy of God and
[31:35] that operation now if you bring me to be
[31:37] his prophet go do as I tell you
[31:38] like putting the figs on Hezekiah and so
[31:41] forth he said he turn around - thank you
[31:43] walked off two days or more passed in
[31:45] his downward street one day and a lady
[31:47] walked up said watch Mary your baby says
[31:49] it's got a brain disease and his going
[31:51] on talking aye captain well he thought
[31:54] it was awful bad you know so he said
[31:56] just a few minutes something taking
[31:58] place she said sir I know someone who
[32:00] can do that operation he said lady look
[32:02] Mayo brothers give it up and said it
[32:04] can't be done said of Madoff your
[32:06] supreme part name brother Branham said
[32:08] he's made a prayer for the baby she used
[32:11] to wait a minute black hitters weren't a
[32:13] great coach suit but that's her so
[32:16] worried that doctor and he told him tuck
[32:19] him up there and the doctor performed
[32:20] the operation the baby got well
[32:23] [Applause]
