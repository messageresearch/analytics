the number amen amen amen amen tonight in the book of saint matthew the 16th chapter and everyone knows this scripture or should by heart and jesus answered 16 and verse 17 through 19. and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon by jonah for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven is i want to thank my good buddy my my my brother my good friend brother jimmy that always does a great job with us amen and we're grateful to to him tonight i i do as our pastor said this morning we do want to express our condolences there to to to brother king john's family as we as our pastor asked him to to the tabernacle here and you know when you see a king kneel down he's not kneeling down to a person he's kneeling down to to what we represent but to see the representation of of him do that representation haciendo i thought a lot of humility to the forefront and i and i always always was in awe of that s and king john left such a lasting impression on me as i was we were at his home church and uh there he said i've i've had people to teach me you see those things i remember him addressing his ministers and he would say these people have money and i asked him he asked them he says do you want a bicycle or a car you don't go nowhere he said these people need an when the the pastor approached him and talked to him about the message and we we saw his receptive spirit that the last one to come in might just be a black sheep without you don't find many people if it wasn't for this covet we sure would be there as quickly as possible you know foreign showed us so much kindness and so much i remember sister sarah his wife and i'll finish with this one [Music] today is a day of of sadness in one way but today is uh is a is a day of jubilation because one of ours have made it the one the one that said the last one to be come in might just be a black sheep and the black sheep of the colors are going to meet in a few days there is a time when i would like to to entitle my message tonight and as well as brother caleb says i'd like to to dedicate this to brother john now you're going to find out in a second that it's not a month can no sun mess it is not the presence of august it's the presence of nobility brother branham speaks to us 26 times about his august presence when you talk about the presence of almighty god his glory gloria his impressiveness his magnitude to magnitude his power to prevent his glory to glorious his majesty you are talking about his august presence this is what he has given us jesus said unto him blessed [Music] and the gates of hell cannot shall not prevail against it as whatsoever shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth but i'm going who he about 350 years ago a shipload of travelers landed on the northeast coast of america northeast coast of america north west the first year they established a town site the next year anya they elected a town government here plan to build a road five miles westward into the wilderness westward into a wilderness but in a few [Music] he continues with the contents of the vision well that was the seven sealed book sf now we never had books like this till lately the books in the old time were scrolls lost they if you wanted to read the book of isaiah you were turned down here to isaiah then unroll it we find that the lamb comes out now now we we we as as ourselves as believers we understand the sin kansas city is going to win anyways kansas city and tomorrow don't worry about it when we come to i'm kidding i don't know i'm a dallas this is the first thing that god tells his people israel israel the lord our god is one lord and then this is where he tells us thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart don't lose this now no with all thy soul and with all thy might he controls you and these and shall have the greatest pastor that we've ever seen today god has still had given us a pastor the greatest one we've ever seen it is the august presence but it takes the people to believe to understand that when you speak about the things of god he does not share his glory with nobody is beware beware unless you forget where do you see people like we have reached but nobility can also reach down to where there's nothing and pick him up for that person to be a son or daughter of god they saw now there's no more mercy yeah i know i missed without understanding that the august presence is also a lineage that means only nothing without understanding that he got up out of that throne and he sat down in another throne now you might not have no no grace on that side this is you may be [Applause] what is he talking about question the august presence of god the presidency that not only fills the heaven but also feels the earth brother branham emmanuel branham when he conducted his august president superstition comes in and blesses us and proves by the scripture it is and i i i i hear brother branham every morning and when he's in the prayer line i don't know how many people do this i'm not saying everybody has to be what i do [Applause] eight or ten people right here sitting right here where are they where are you eight or ten people one two three that is bringing his presence on the scene but he'll only come solomon if there's lineage you say you have to be a perez no no be a christian [Applause] i'm not is to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren and this is where you need to really get your just you can shout as much as you can [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] and what it is a done deal nothing could conquer christ i believe that our pastor this morning when he said that excitement he didn't mean not not to say amen what he meant i believe look piece of the scene was that he you don't get frustrated things don't just you don't you don't fly off the handle because of what things go around but nothing could conquer [Applause] nothing could conquer christ is that true brother brown says is all things are possible with god nothing impossible he says but all things are possible to you also nothing never yes i'm going to look at you like you look at me uh to or the authority that god has permitted to his church i'll give you the keys to the kingdom okay i'm going to give you keys to a lamborghini lamborghini i'm going to give you keys to your brand new house laura hallelujah it's already done why be patient let it develop i'm going to give you keys to whatever problem you have [Applause] i'm going to give you the keys to the kingdom whatever you bind on earth i'll find it in heaven my mind let's called this august president oh my i feel you whatever you bind on earth i give you the power over serpents and all and over all kinds of diseases is you know a man a man with 155 people aboard his plane plains about ready to go down going down they hit a flock of geese it's

sullenberg captain sully sullenberger guided the crippled u.s airway plane landed with a perfect landing on the hudson river not a single passenger died is anybody giving you keys to your brand new house when you give the key to somebody it comes with immense privilege he gives you your access to the throne of god and what has he given you tonight what has he given you when you accepted the lord jesus did he give you when you received eternal life authority how many were sick that god healed them how many were lost when god saved them don't get too emotional not upon us sick and god healed them upon your mind well i'm afraid brother that if they see me writing it they might think i'm a holy roller pencil about time people think that you're a christian it's about time that your neighbor knows you're a christian that the people that work with you know you're a christian you know there's a country that's uganda this was uganda right now they're hurting but i'll tell you one thing they would not have known about jesus jesus i remember ministering to a group of ministers throughout over 200 of them it was my turn to minister minister and i was talking to them and my i see a woman coming in through the to the to the inside the building brother the day before they wanted to throw us out of the building because we were making too much noise but then the queen shows up now the manager doesn't know what to do with us i'm so sorry he said this didn't know what kind of people you were anybody can shout but somebody he's giving me the power he's giving me access to him whatever look at him whatever now me me and brother patrick you you know yo yo mano brother patrick's brother patrick saying is this whatever okay whatever well he says it so much no this attempt is business that i bought a t-shirt and it says whatever it is you can say a lot with you know somebody tells you something and you just look at them and say let me just say this whatever look at that whatever
