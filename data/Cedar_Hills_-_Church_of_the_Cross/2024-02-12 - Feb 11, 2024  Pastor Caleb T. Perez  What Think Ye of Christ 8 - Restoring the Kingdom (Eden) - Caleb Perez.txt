the Cross and Voice of Truth Tabernacle and all whose efforts are worth mentioning as far as this Milestone I'm about to talk is concerned I'm your brother in the Lord's Kingdom from northern Uganda brother opio Bazil who ever since 2017 to date has has been in close collaboration cooperation and sincerely participating in spiritual Awakenings that have involved majorly two of four mentioned churches with also brothers and sisters I can't identify I along with the people in Northern Uganda have it that from May 2017 when the team first came to discuss how to effectively translate the message of the hour and subsequent launch in December also held a convention and witnessed many tremendous things what I marked as the beginning of our trolly land being healed as the translation began along with the radio program it was like both an aerial and ground attack on the enemy's camp at that time we had 11 message churches which had existed before where some were as early as 1986 then in a period of 6 years we now have 22 churches in operation these churches are spread in the districts of Gulu Noya and amuru which directly bord south the Sudan although districts like Amoro perer kitgum and L don't yet have message churches in them we believe if God's elected ones are there they will be reached we continue to appreciate and thank our Lord Jesus Christ for extending the ministry of Elijah by the hands of our brothers to our land and Country may God bless them shalom in our Northern office in Uganda brother Bazil and the team are translating the message into a chly since then we have translated 16 books the 70th week of Daniel Christ is the mystery of God revealed and the exposition of the seven Church ages are in the works now we are currently finishing why we are not a denomination this is the current map showing the regions and the number of pastures in each region that the Lord has called through the Revival and they total 934 [Music] [Applause] churches God bless you how many are excited I think that should excite us amen amen give somebody a high five say good job good to see each and every one of you and it's certainly good to see our brother and friend brother Henry God bless you Henry amen amen would you stand as we want to get to the word I know there's so many people that are sick this morning we won we won't have an evening service but I know it's cold out there and how many what a beautiful view of the mountains huh like that man that beautiful who but God can do such things as that amen we thank the Lord see there there is Beauty in the desert amen we are we are grateful to God once again for life we want to get into the word here continue praying for one another we want to greet everyone that's online you maybe that not maybe as many of us today but God bless you and God be with you may you receive what you are looking for as amen what think you of Christ number eight with a subtitle restoring the kingdom Eden amen amen so if you can be so kind the scripture it's been sheesh I think it's been like five weeks since I preach and uh not because I didn't want to just it's the way it turned out uh we we don't want to be the preacher this morning we want the Lord to to speak to us Matthew the 22nd chapter the 41st verse 41 and 42 and it reads like this we should probably already know this by memory while the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked them saying what think ye of Christ wow today we're going to really find out what we think of Christ amen and may God add His blessings to the reading of his word man you may be seated but we have heard some wonderful messages I'm telling you my soul has been fed being fed so as we have started with every one of these messages young people help me out here see if the girls can help me out here first there was a three-fold purpose God revealing himself is that right okay number one to reveal himself in Christ number two to have preeminence in his bride and number three to restore the kingdom brother Bram says to its rightly position let remember that to restore the kingdom can you repeat after me to restore the kingdom oh you're half asleep today like to restore the kingdom to restore the kingom to its rightly position to it rightly position amen wonderful now if I were to show you this Bible how many believe that this is God's true his unadulterated word everybody all right your neighbor okay everybody oh all right all right this is is true unadulterated word right and when we good to see you Rene God bless you bless you and so when we when we read this we always say that um this is a love letter it's a book of love yes or yes how your neighbor neighbor this is a book pick up your Bible your neighbor neighbor this is the Book of Love This is a love story everybody together this is a love story tell your neighbor neighbor it is a love story yes yes everybody in agreement the Bible once again raise him up how many like love stories all right I I think we all love we like or love love stories even even the the men that think they're all Macho right right they they they sneak watch uh their Hallmark movie I don't like this stuff like that but I done right we all we all we like love stories especially love stories that end well not love stories that don't end well so once again pick up your Bible this is this is a love story now I'm going to ask you the question whose love story is it oh we are all right we are on the ball this morning I guess now they're awake huh now they're awake this is the story of it's my love story it's the Story of My Love Story with Christ am I talking to anyone else here this this is our love story we know how it started and we know how it's going to end I'm going to say it again we know how it started and we know how it's going to end when then as we understand this there was some things that I had gone through as I was hearing a message of our pastor founding pastor a message he had preached a series of messages back to Eden and uh he preached them in 1986 and in there he's he's talking about he's back at the Garden of Eden but he's he's talking about something that was lost from the beginning and that's something was friend ship church I got to be honest with you here is that I had never put this these things together but but it it was like a a light bulb went off and so I I I want to put here and I want to put it up here uh this is is what our founding Pastor he always taught us as the young people he would teach us the the seven steps of marriage everybody know what they are yeah okay if you don't you can write this down write this in your Bible write it write it wherever you need to write it but these were the seven stages or steps of marriage and so if we can together if we can you can help me out here some you are looking to want to advance in this stages all right so number one was what friendship every relationship must start with friendship we're in Sunday school so you bear with me as we as we go through this and after a a bond of friendship comes comes then courtship we've talked about that and and courtship is when you take the relationship to court what the verdict is going to be we heard that right what is what it's going to happen here is this relationship going to go forward or is it not going to go forward where where we at and then as far as courtship and friendship we know that you can still walk away anytime right it didn't work out nice dud and that's why you you don't the the man the young young man and the and the young lady they don't mess with each other there's no touching there's no kissing there's none of these things we teach that yes or yes young people you see Hess okay now now that that the reason for that is that if it doesn't work out you know that there's you're clean between the two nothing H nothing happened and you can always look at each other in the eye and say God bless you years later you get married to someone else you can always say God bless you Sister God bless you brother and there's nothing between you all right Christian way to do things but we also understand that when you go to the next stage the next stage which is engagement that once he asked her to marry him and and she says yes remember it is your vow one to another that bind you and at this stage you can't walk away no no more oh you could walk the world walks away can't walk away and be right with God and then we find then comes after that is the wedding after that's the wedding supper the honeymoon and the home life now in seeing these things you say well where does brother Bram say all these things all through the whole message amen not something we just made up you can find it through the whole message what really got me about this was that we we we all believe that we're going back to Eden right am I the only one we're going back to Eden right but we're not going back in a fallen condition are going back to a restored condition a restored Kingdom now now this is important because as we as we search the scriptures we find out that through the Scriptures it shows us the way back we thank God for a prophet that brought a message of restoration to restore us back to where we were in the beginning now then this this and and as this unfolds you'll understand where I'm going with this so before we can understand the restoration of the Kingdom he has to have preeminence in us and before he can have preeminence in US we have to understand how God first revealed himself in Christ so then everyone then has asked the question about restoration because we're get we get tired of this this old pest house right you know especially as you get older and as you get sick and and when everything is okay we're like oh no everything's good then all of a sudden somebody gets sick or struggles come and the family has had some hardships then we began to think wow what will it be like we want we desire a restoration so in Acts the first chapter and we're going to go we have a lot of verses to go through today but I want you to really get this when they therefore were come together they asked him saying Lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel remember that's the third part of this to restore the kingdom will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel will you restore the kingship the Dominion the rule the authority will you restore all these things at this time and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father ha put in his own power do you see they were asking a question that they were not ready to handle they they had not come to a point in their walk with the Lord that they could really comprehend the answer to this you see watch this they were asking this question before understanding that they had to be in a position to receive the revelation of it they had not been born again yet and Jesus had already said as he told Nicodemus unless you're born again you can't see nor can you enter the kingdom are you with me I want you to get this now once again so they're asking are you going to restore the kingdom unless you're born again you you cannot see or even enter the kingdom you're asking a question that you can't handle right now then they went to the upper room and there they received the Holy Ghost now their caral Minds were changed from a carnality now it was changed into a spiritual mind right isn't that what the Lord told Nicodemus that which is born of the flesh is flesh but that which is born of the spirit is Spirit carnal mind cannot comprehend spiritual things so so this being being the importance of it they also then they come to the point that they wanted to understand what this restoration of the kingdom was that's why I said this is my love story this is the story love story with him what do I think of Christ everything he's the world to me my life is my groom it's the love of my life what more can we say this morning so because I know this and because I see him in every scripture that I read then I know then I I begin to know who I am now the kingdom is starting to be restored to its rightful position notice this now what kingdom was to be restored we look in the Bible we find the kingdom of heaven we find the kingdom of God we find uh the kingdom uh well here with us a church Kingdom I'm talking about the world there's a church kingom right there's our own personal Kingdom am I talking to anybody here right no no we all have our own personal kingdoms Kingdom Ros you know it's it's sometimes I sometimes you wish you didn't know too much but it's very sad in this world that we live in it's sad because when you see most churches there they have have their own kingdom they have their own mentality what they're doing and why they're doing it that's why when when we in when we go to Africa and Poland or wherever the Lord leads us I always invite ministers from other churches that mean I see somebody come come with us and I do that on purpose the reason being is that is that we are not trying to build our own kingdom everybody understand brother Caleb isn't trying to build his own kingdom not at all no no we're we're trying to establish a kingdom in the hearts of the people and that's why I say come come with us this is not we're not building up something for for me or for our church we are building this up because this is the restoration of the Kingdom I believe that we are in the last part of this and it's so important that we do our part bringing the Believers bringing the people to Christ so I would say then imagine what we could do if we work together but you ask people you want to work together no no I'm I'm busy we got our own thing going God bless you in that God bless anyone that does anything for the Lord I believe that we're trying to accomplish something here and we have to understand then that that when we talk about the kingdom we got to know that it's the kingdom of God that is is being established now when we see the Old Testament and I don't know how long my voice will hold up but you bear with me today in the Old Testament it was known as the kingdom of God brother Bram tells us this it was known as the kingdom of God I pray that you catch this they knew about the kingdom of God for that was what the known church was called in the Old Testament the kingdom of God for it was God's kingdom God originally he wanted a family became Jehovah began to build his kingdom and his kingdom had to do with his family in other words God is the king of this Kingdom and the church is his domain I want you to tell your neighbor this God is the king his church is the domain now I I I want to express it this way as long as the children of Israel were were in Egypt they were the people of God yes or yes amen once again as long as the children of Israel were in Egypt whether it is Egypt is the is the world or whether it's denomination they were the people of God but the moment they came out of Egypt they were no longer the people of God they became known as the Church of God because the very Word Church means the called out ones amen then the king operated from above his people I hope that you get all these little points okay cuz because you're going to need them here in a little bit this King which is the king once again he operated above his people he watched over his people what they were doing right yeah he was God above us in a pillar of fire watching over his Kingdom wow he wasn't just then God or or his kingdom was wasn't just here on Earth no all Heavens were his the universe was his is his kingdom but he wanted to get a little closer to man we know these things Psalms 103:19 says that the Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens and his kingdom ruleth over all Psalms 145 11-13 they shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom and talk of thy power to make known to the sons of men his mighty Acts and the Glorious Majesty of his kingdom for thy kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom and thy Dominion endureth throughout all generations now that's the Old Testament we say Amen to this but there was coming a day Church listen closely there was coming a day when the King was going to Tabernacle in a human body and would bring his kingdom down to earth now do we now this is ABCs This is this is ABC's here but he was going to become one of us the king becoming one of us imagine now the kingdom of God had come to Earth tell your neighbor the kingdom of God had come to earth now we're we're talking about restoring the kingdom but who would have known this because all the people knew was that the God above us he was over everything but he was not close to us there was no relationship because the relationship the Friendship had been disconnected okay you understand this is why we feel the way we feel we we need more than what we have once again this is my love story all right tell your neighbor again this is I love story now how many of you really believe this we could say yes because we're in church but every day of our life is this our love story this is this is what Satan doesn't want he knows it's a love story but he doesn't want it to be your love story all right so so here we are now watch watch this unfold the kingdom of God had now come to Earth wait wait a minute I got to stop here because I got I want you to catch what the kingdom is it's the restoration of the Kingdom to its rightful position okay now now now you got to hold down to that God has a kingdom and it's he's the king over all but my question is are all these things his kingdom or is he the kingdom it includes everything I understand but I'm going to say it again the kingdom of God had come to Earth who had come to Earth God had come to earth once again the kingdom of God had come to Earth he had come to Earth there's nothing outside of him you're looking for a domain that is outside his of him he came to Earth he left everything else yeah in in one sense but in another sense it all came from forth from him so wherever he goes the kingdom is with him do that does that make sense to you all because I don't want to go any further if it doesn't make sense watch watch now once again everything that he has everything he is is always with him all the time that's right and if you don't understand that then you'll never understand understand what you have when you receive the Holy Ghost when we receive the Holy Ghost we receive the kingdom and everything that the kingdom has belongs to you and I come on now either we believe that or we don't I believe that because all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church so what does the church have the church has it all okay watch watch where we're going with this now it had come to earth now Mark 1:14 says after John was put in prison Jesus came into Galilee and he began to preach the gospel of the kingdom of God okay let's stop there for a moment what is the gospel of the kingdom of God somebody help me out here what is the gospel of the kingdom of God John was preaching that the kingdom is on its road to being restored what is John preaching we can go back and we can see he's preaching repentance but let's go a little further and let's see what what he was preaching and saying this is verse 15 the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand that's what John was preaching the kingdom of God they're thinking way out in space somewhere the kingdom of God is at hand now as close to you as your hand is close to other words the kingdom of God is here wait a minute wait a minute the kingdom of God Heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot now it's that hand in other words words you're to be able to touch it now wait wait wait a minute you're going to be able to touch the kingdom of God absolutely that you're going to touch it now I'm going to say it one more time now you're going to be able to touch it that's John's gospel John is preaching that now the kingdom of God now it's touchable watch this now Luke 109 and heal the sick that are therein and and say unto them the kingdom of God is Come N unto you wait a minute that the god of Glory has now come n to you okay where are we at this morning is the kingdom of God at hand is the kingdom of God nigh where is the kingdom today now we want to know where this out because because we have different people some haven't given their heart to the Lord others have but they can't go any further but it's time to go farther now once again it's time to go further we can't be happy just being church members that doesn't cut it anymore the kingdom of God is not oh my it's n all right tell your neighbor neighbor it's n it's right here with us those who were not a part of that Kingdom couldn't come comprehend that what do you mean the kingdom of God is nine they were looking for Mansions streets of gold they were looking for Angels they were looking for all kinds of things and John says it's nine where where where where where's he at where's this Kingdom at where's this Kingdom looking for some castles looking for something nice better than what we have here oh it's that hand it's nigh unto you the Kingdom of Heaven has come now the kingdom of God Has Come forgive me now notice this now they were looking for other things then Luke 17:20 says and he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come got stop here because these are so important here comes the Pharisees that we heard John say that it's at hand we heard John say it's at it's n we heard all these things but actually when is it coming come on it sounds like a lot of people right even in the message when is the rapture oh you guys act like you don't know what I'm talking am I part of the Bride of Jesus Christ I don't know can you understand the kingdom you'll never know if you are or not if you don't know what the kingdom is amen that's right and when is this going to happen nobody knows not even the son knew it but it'll be revealed he said it would to who to the kingdom no man knoweth that's right no man knows but the kingdom will know okay here we go now this gonna get good okay man is it me or is it hot in here it's it's gon to get a lot hotter in a little bit put some hands on or something if you get cold just up a little bit if you need a jacket let me know we'll borrow his when should the kingdom when the kingdom of God should come and he answered and said the kingdom of God cometh not with with observation when is it coming when is it cominging God coming they're waiting for the Heavens to open and the King to come down when is it coming and Jesus is looking at them and he is the kingdom oh come on now I'm going to say it again the kingdom of God had come and what was the rightful position he was in the office of son that was the rightful position at the moment but they couldn't see the kingdom because they were looking for Mansions they were looking for streets of gold Crystal pearls and they see a man that there was nothing to be desired he wasn't a very handsome man that probably if you saw him today probably be like that can't be him amen or amen amen amen come on now notice this is wonderful the kingdom of God doesn't come with observation neither shall they say low here or low there for the kingdom of God is within you now we're getting somewhere now the kingdom of God is not out there the kingdom of God is within how do you put all that within Jesus said Jesus said let not your hearts be troubled you believe in God you believe in the kingdom of God believe also in me for I am the kingdom of God I have come to you you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house or domain or Kingdom there are many mansions if it was not so I would have told you but I go to prepare a place for you that where I am you can be there also oh my there's the the answer coming to that to the kingdom now where I am my domain you can be there also who's he talking to that where I am you can be there who is he talking to turn to your neighbor neighbor who's he talking to it's in the same book that's the love story he's talking to me Hallelujah I would have told you if it wasn't so I go to prepare a place for you watch watch this now the kingdom of God is within you I don't believe that he's telling the Pharisees that the kingdom of God is within them but I believe that he's telling them that they cannot observe this Kingdom because it's within the person the kingdom of God is within you how is it in me I want to know what the book says I want to know how the kingdom is in me anybody here want to know you got to wake up you can't be sleeping in church and and want to know Romans 14:17 just write these and go you can read them again for the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink but righteousness and peace how many of you have peace inside of you and joy Hallelujah sometimes we got to notify our face sometime the Bulldog huh bu but the kingdom is of righteousness of peace and joy it's okay to smile really even when you're going through a hard time it's okay to smile there should be joy in us all the time that don't mean we want to be laughing all the time Joy is one thing laughing is something else annoying huh here is something so beyond that I like the way it says it here and this is what this is what for the kingdom of God it is righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Ghost and they didn't recognize that the kingdom of God was right in front of them it's not that but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness okay he's got to have preeminence in you to be able to seek you can't him unless he has preeminence how many here does he have preeminence in that's that's an easy to raise your hand it's hard to live because we know the parts that we he doesn't have pre right see oh in church we are oh yes oh look at the brother got preeminence but let them get mad one time and mad their anger it'll get going just like that right yeah or no or no you're not with me right they got disconnected we lost the signal got to get it back back started here that's what they don't get seek first the kingdom of God not not second or third or fourth seek first there's where we fail we don't seek Him First seek him last we see what the doctor has to say we what the neighbor has to say and then at the end oh well we'll see what God has to say about that's not the kingdom in the Kingdom we are his subject and the first thing we know is what does God have to say about this we should live our life that way every day God what do you have to say about this Lord You're the king of this Kingdom I want to know what you think I want to know what you have in store I want to know where I need to change I want to have your perfect will in my life he's got to be the king and when he's the king everything else is second it's important that we seek Him First Mark 91 says and he said unto them verily I said to you that there be some of them that stand here which shall not taste of death till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power how many of you have seen the kingdom of God come let me see if you've seen the kingdom of God come now have you seen it come with power oh it's one thing to see it come but in power listen to what brother Braham says Revelations 4 is God's word infallible every word that he said will come to pass and a few days later he took Peter James and John up into the mountain apart to be a witness Peter James and John and they seen the kingdom of God come in power I'm going to say it again they seen the kingdom of God come in power they seen the kingdom of God rehearsed what what is being rehearsed we say the resurrection we can say all the dead in Christ we can say the rapture we can say a lot of things but I'm going to tell you really what is being rehearsed the wedding is being rehearsed I want you to get this because this is where the message lies today they seen the rehearsal don't you have to have a wedding rehearsal before the wedding there's a rehearsal going on who's there the groom and who else and Moses all the saints that had passed away but are part of elah those that won't see death but all together you see them one who is it the groom and the bride why are they rehearsing the wedding what is the resurrection is all about what do you think the Rapture is all about it's us being good people boys and girls and Lord changing my heart so that we can make it home no from the very first moment that we get to earth we are man being manifested to do what to go through the seven steps to get back to Eden what should have been from the beginning you me come on now I'm I'm going here now once again it's to take us back that's why we have to go through this process put him back up there again would you the seven steps when I look at this I see friendship but that's not all I see you know what I see justification come on now we're getting going to get down to some nitty-gritty now I see under friendship I see justification under courtship I see sanctification and under engag M the baptism of the Holy Ghost that brings you to a New Birth what has been birthed the relationship what is it coming for because there's a wedding and those steps is what helps us prepare for that wedding do is our love story I've been Justified my love story let me tell you how he justified I've been Sanctified let me tell you howed me I've been baptized with let me tell you heaped me born again and now we grow the stature what is it it's the wedding dress you got to try it on you got to rehearse it Hallelujah okay how many brides how many how many brides is there here I'm talking about the women in natural like how many bride let me see how many of you got married before okay all right how many of you didn't even try on your wedding dress went straight straight to the church I hope I hope it fits good yeah the train everywhere it's all stained Nobody Does that right you get in the mirror then you get all those mirrors all the way around I feel like crying right now but this is another thing be strong and of good courage so so here you are and you look in the mirror and you turn this way and that way back in the front man you sometimes you even get an aerial view wow wow it looks good I don't like this and I don't like I don't like this all right well let's adjust it you finally get it where exactly you want it right exactly it fits perfect it's the right dress it's in here the dress is in here and it's the word that's exactly we don't change the word like we heard to make it fit us no sometimes it's little this roll When the Roll is Called Up Yonder we'll be there right and so what do we got to do we got to get rid of some of the Roll sometimes because it doesn't fit right so then we try to starve our eles try to do to try to get rid of some of it stop eating for a little bit yeah it's not that hard so then finally it fits just right we have to adjust ourselves to the word all about this is this is our love story now now watch this now it's a rehearsal some of that stood there would not taste death until they had seen him come in power that's Mark 91 and once again brother brandham says the kingdom of God that was Old Testament there had to be a transfer from the kingdom of God to even though it's included a different kingom it's the same in one sense but it's different in another now it's talking about you and I we are Gentiles we don't deserve nothing but he grafted Us in made us part of this Kingdom and now he's saying the kingdom of God cometh in power but Matthew 16:28 says verily I say unto you there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see wait a minut wait a minute wait a minute I got to stop here because there's a this is loaded right here9 some will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God come in power that's one thing but now in Matthew 16 some shall not taste death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom now we're now we're getting somewhere now we belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in our life how many get that now I'm going to say it again this is the kingdom the word of God made spirit and life in our own life that's when you know the kingdom has come into you until then it's just now you how many believe that that brother brother Noah has the whole Holy Ghost if brother Noah is close to me and I know he's got the Holy Ghost say kingdom of God is is mine come on now and then when I shake hands say kingdom of God is at hand but now God is on your hand what are you going to do with him what are you going to do with Christ on your hand put it in your heart it's not hard just put him in your heart the kingdom of God it's not just n not just that hand the kingdom of God is within you that's what we're that's the word that the word the life has now come into our life and now we are the subjects of that Kingdom everything that the kingdom has is in here I don't know if we believe that or not healing is in here if you don't got it then make sure that it's at hand so that someone can lay their hand on the sick and they'll recover I don't know just just just things aren't going right change in your atmosphere bring somebody close that has the Holy Ghost change the atmosphere say oh it's N I feel different how many times do we pray for people and they say brother I I feel different Chang what's so why don't we do that but then comes the moment that we are our thermometry and we go from that's right that's what we're after right okay so here we are now John 14 I'm gonna I'm going to skip this because I don't know where I'm at but this is but I want to get to there's some things I want to get to it's a transferring from one Kingdom to another once again in the Old Testament it was the kingdom of God but in the New Testament it was given another name somebody help me somebody not Minister I want to see the people somebody help me out here it's part of the same but it's more intense because the throne has moved are you with me the throne has moved it's not the throne isn't in heaven the thr is over a domain now the throne has moved to Jesus but now from Jesus where's his throne at okay brother BR says it gets more severe now why because the relationship gets more severe the relationship gets closer more than just nigh or at hand there is a Unity a joining a uniting time and sign that is bringing us and him together where you can't separate us from Christ okay okay watch this now he said but in the New Testament it's called Almost you never know he was been speaking in tongu nobody knows oh what kingdom are you supposed to be in kingdom of God yeah but come closer it was God above us God With Us now it's God in us Kingdom called for us I ain't even going to preach no more sit down here you want to sit down with me let them figure it out you get it what is it called very good finally thank you Min not being obedient well I said don't say anything let the people figure it out we give it everything to them they got to work at it too but watch this now in the New Testament it's called the Messianic Empire or the messiah's kingdom where Messiah rules where Messiah is King now we're in the New Testament now we're not looking back in the old now we're bringing it Clos what think ye of Christ oh he's the king of this Messiah messah Kingdom what do you think of Christ this morning it is known as the Messiah Empire or messiah's Kingdom and the only way to understand this you have to keep in mind that when Adam forfeited that title deed book of redemption it went back into the hands of God here we are the kingdom of God it went back to that Kingdom so God had a plan to take that title deed and give it back to man but it could only be transferred back to him through the messiah's kingdom he wasn't going to give it just to any man to be a man the man the god man that could take what was his and could bring it and restore it back to his children which children his bride he did it for you and I but there had to be one man do it no one else could do it Christ okay are you with me are you with some of you are looking at like go back and hear it again I got watch the transfer after this man Jesus said pray like this Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth is that what it says that's not what the scripture say that's what we're always looking we're looking for observation on earth oh I can see it wow what doesn't come with observation kingdom come thy will be done in earth Earth the Bible says in Earth as it is in heaven the way it is in that Kingdom it's also got a throne that Throne is in Earth not on Earth in Earth point to yourself in Earth this is where it's at thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven God revealed in Christ for God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself the church is not an organization not a gathering of people the church is the people of God been called out of the world to serve in another kingdom we are living in a kingdom and it is called the Messianic Kingdom in other words where Messiah rules in every life that's in his domain you cannot be in that Kingdom he doesn't rule if he does not have a 100% ownership you're not in the Kingdom you may be n you may be at hand but it's time to make sure that we're in the Kingdom the prophet of God says oh we want Christ yeah we want him to save us from Hell Fire brother says but we don't accept him as Lord why we don't want him to tell us what to do he's the king and you don't want him to tell you what to do kingdom are you in uhoh uh oh come on now Church you got to be real with this I want him to tell me what to do because whenever he doesn't I make a big mess that's why I have to apologize and I have got to ask for forgiveness forgive me Lord when it's been me trying to be the Church brother Caleb's trying to Le the church boo but when the Holy Ghost the kingdom he dwells in and now through him using this vessel leading the church now we got everything in order that's the way he said he would set up his kingdom Upon This Rock of Revelation build my church and the gates of hell can't Prevail against because it's my kingdom nothing can come against his kingdom he is the king of kings and the Lord of lords how many of you Lord but don't just say yeah and then go we don't give him his time we don't give him number one place why why act like we're yeah we're we do we do oh yes don't should we better start I don't know when we're going to think about starting but I think we should have started like yesterday year or years ago but start today it's so important Church watch as we continue with this Christ is the head of this Messianic Kingdom you can't organize it you can't denominate it it is Christ Kingdom and he is the head that's part of the love story if a man is leading the church we failed but if Christ is leading the church through that manic Kingdom In Action now therefore she is a called out group she is the mystical body Christ set it in order before he died he spoke of it com coming what is it coming he said I will come and be king over this domain who is this domain I will be king over this domain what a love story story we haven't even got to the good part yet I'm I'm going to see if you guys are if you guys are not wi awake you're going to have to cancel it for till next time a little while in the world won't see me no more but you shall see you won't have nothing to do with the kingdoms of this world they said Lord how will you manifest yourself to us J not as scary as says Lord how will you manifest yourself unto us and not unto the world Jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abod with him there's a restored King there he is restored in the in a right position when will this when the subjects are restored the kingdom is restored a kingdom where you'll never die never be sick never have a heartache no more funeral no more Graves never again to be weary no depression sadness what a kingdom why wouldn't we want to go because the cares of this world we are to live in this Kingdom a kingdom where decency Holiness and power exist what a kingdom who's part of that Kingdom I'm part of that kingom I believe it believe that we are part of that King that is the promise the promised land is to live in this land of the Holy Ghost that's good stuff God's promise for the church to live in the power of the spirit another world it's another land it's another kingdom we can say look at brother Moses he goes to school and you help me brother mes he goes to school good young man love brother brother Moses mes awesome goes to school as many of you as all of us we go to work go to school we we are in this world but we are not of the world so what makes him different reminds me of the story remember that how they asked them why does this man this colored man why why is it harder he works but he always has his chest out he gives it his all why does he act like that why why does brother Moses act like that like he does a Christian young man at school or work or wherever he goes why does he act like that he acts different from everyone else oh he says I'll tell you why you know the land where he comes from his father's the king oh yeah so so thank you brother Moses so so why do you act the way you do because the land where you come from your father's the king so how what do we act like people run over over people will no joy we act like the son of the king because we are the son of the king we are children of the king and we should conduct ourselves like that at all times it is him the king messiah messiah is the kingdom of God this is this is the in the message Messiah brother says you see what Messiah is Messiah is the kingdom of God and we are Messi or little Messiah what are we we are in that kingdom do we act like that all the time do we speak like that all the time do we treat each other like that all the time no white not it's not going to be good enough on that day the kingdom of God was n me the kingdom of God was at hand I want to know I want to make sure that I can say the kingdom of God was Within Me is within me that's where it is I'm not looking for the kingdom somewhere else side and when I receive the Holy Ghost I receive the kingdom of God and all that the kingdom has is at my disposal in my hand Jesus said that all that the father has given me it is mine not a one will be lost I thought the other day when you search your life and you say you know you always got to make sure hard to ask you how many of you have the Holy Ghost wait a minute did I walk into a church what you're not in the Kingdom without the Holy Ghost that's right now don't just raise it it because I asked the question but after receiving the Holy Ghost and the power it brings to your life joy and the righteousness it brings I sat there the other day and I said Thank You Lord I could never have lived in the time of David listen closely church I could never never have lived in the time of the disciples I've already tasted like for the god of Glory dwell in this heart I could not even fathom the the the thought of God above me I can't fathom that no more I want you to go with me right now I can't faom what it was like for Isaiah and Jeremiah to have God above them I can't fathom what it was like the disciples to have God with them because now we have experienced God in us that is the ultimate goal church that the kingdom of God which is the Messianic Empire will now come in my day and would dwell in this heart and this would be a subject of the Kingdom I said Lord I couldn't have lived in those times wonderful but they went down with a promise I don't have to go down with the promise I've already been given the promise the Holy Ghost what to show and prove that I am part of that that I will be there I don't know if you believe that my conviction that's what I believe I couldn't live in those times this is a greater time they long to live in this time what is it that the kingdom of God could be inside they couldn't answer that question but we can answer it the kingdom of God has come and now it dwells in the hearts of the Believers Mah is the kingdom of God that's what makes it the Messianic Empire can I have a little bit more time barely heating up right now maybe some of you might be bored or whatever believe me if you knew what was coming forth you would you would eat it eat all of it watch what he says Messiah anointed one this blows me away this is in the the message messiah messiah anointed one a King to deliver a king write that down Messiah a King to deliver a king and then he says you're Kings and Priests your kings to bring in we have it in within our hands to bring people into the kingdom your king to bring in and we're priests to minister to a messiah Mah Messi that one if I said nothing now that that's that's an a bomb right there nuclear warhead Kings to bring in priests to minister to a messiah and everyone that is part of this Messianic Kingdom have a special anointing Messianic anointing but everything's in order that's why a prophet doesn't try to be an apostle because the prophet has a certain anointing an apostle has a certain anointing evangelist has an anointing a teacher has an anointing a pastor has a certain anointing certain what is it it's the way he set up his kingdom when I look at this I say gosh help me let us fulfill this let us fulfill this in our time we live in a time where everyone wants it easy yeah yeah everyone wants it easy people say I've been at this and I and I've seen this lately I've been at this a long time I've suffered a lot brother what do they do put their guards down and put at risk everything that they have lived for everything that they have suffered for put it all at risk say no one has suffered like me all because they don't want to suffer they want to put it on cruise control and just Cruise it all the way to no press the battle I don't have no strength brother perfect strength by Perfect weakness tell your neighbor neighbor press the battle this is the kingdom now press the battle come on tell your neighbor you're not telling your neighbor press the battle press the battle stop we belong to that Kingdom church that's why this Prosperity Gospel that gospel is not the gospel that John spoke about John preached his gospel got his head chopped off but this Prosperity Gospel did it all all we have to do is reap the benefits bunch of nonsense I don't know such a gospel nor do I preach a gospel like that that's not the gospel of the Kingdom that is a man-made gospel why they don't like scriptures like second Timothy 2:12 if we suffer we shall also reign with him and if we deny him he'll also deny us with me if I don't suffer with Christ I cannot reign with him why do you think that she doesn't have to go through the Great Tribulation because she's gone oh come on church because she comes to church church and she receives her judgment right now is going on the courtship I'm going to say it again the courtship is going on this is the Judgment seat of Christ and and in this judgment seat of Christ we're in a courtship with him see if we go on with him or not to see if we're going to be engaged with him or not that's justification brother BR says that Judas is SC he was justified and Sanctified even Jesus called him friend friend do what you came to do but when it went to court no no he was his name was not in that L that's what the courtship is for is come on church I'm going to say it again that's what courtship is all about you got to find out if your name is there or not if it is brother Bram says's Book of Life is the marriage certificate and if your name's you got a marriage certificate I'm getting married part of my love story the reason is that character is never made without suffering suffering because you made wrong decisions is not suffering for Christ a hard time brother this isn't made wrong decisions that's not suffering for Christ that's suffering for for our feel in the blank this sometimes our right this is some things even though you suffer God Will Make A Way if you're his now can I have just like like 10 minutes then you can kick back and you can the weather while I get ready for part two there's a price to pay to reach the sum the price is much is it worth the cost you get it so many times people say wow I don't know why this brother prays and oh the Lord hears him pray the don't seem to hear me I'll tell you the difference one is in prayer and fasting word and the other one is sitting back watching TV hearing music oh they need you prayer oh yeah yeah pray there's no anointing there nothing there am you part of the Kingdom then get into the groom word oh those ones don't hit very good huh [Music] like we must give him our hearts our bodies as a living sacrif no other way cost to be a Christian it costs to make sure to know that you're the part of the bride of Christ seeking him day day out but many don't want to pay that price because this guy he likes to kick back all the time feed me tomorrow today I'm gonna watch me a good movie prob watching movie here and there not saying that get get where I'm at makes the place of those things it might cost you everything you've got it might cost you your home you still want to follow him it might cost you your friendship it might cost you your parties it might cost you your place at your Club whatever it'll cost it cost you it'll cost everything that's worldly and pertains to the world he won't take away what he gave you everything the world has that you got from the world all those things let it go you'll have to separate yourself from everything that's worldly it shows that you're of a different Kingdom well I can't do it brother right you can't Henry Ford once said Henry you say I can't do it or if you say I can do it you're right either way that's Peter what he feared happened what he believed happened believed he could walk on water and he walked on water he feared that he was going to drown and he started drowning whatever you fear or whatever you believe will happen but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses this is where we want to get to now that the bride will follow the groom Back to Eden this will be the full restoring of the Kingdom the bride body must follow the head it is part of his resurrection and part of the mystery she is part of of the mystery watch Paul here this is so tremendous and and I'm going to I'm gonna start to close here up on this when we when maybe next Sunday the moment that man took of that tree of knowledge of Good and Evil friendship was cut off 1986 here's our pastor again he said the first thing that had to be restored is friendship why because friendship is the first step part of my love story the first thing I was an enemy to God but my friendship with God had to be restored he said that and it hit me like a like a ton of bricks I said Lord I had never I had never looked at it in this in this light friendship the first thing that God does he's looking for a man to be his friend why because because the friendship he had with Adam was was terminated looking I need I I just need one friend God found himself by himself again oh church if that don't break your heart want to be by himself he wanted a family he wanted a friend a son to be able to talk to walk in the co of the evening and have a discussion with his friend but when that friendship was broke he look for another friend where can I find me a friend where's a friend all of a sudden he finds a man oh he's from Earth of the Cal he's he's one of those idolators said I'm going to give him an unconditional Covenant make sure that Abraham he's going to make it he's going to be my friend he doing showing by example and shadows that friendship would be restored back with God that's why he said Abraham called him the friend of God because friendship had to be restored first even before courtship friendship had to be restored Hallelujah I don't know about you but I look at that and I like that was in the kingdom of God God that friendship but under the Messianic Empire let's see what else we find here Song of Solomon 516 how many of you men like reading Song of Solomon well if you want to be romantic read if I was getting married again watch what he says here 56 his mouth is most sweet y he is Al together lovely this is my beloved and this is my friend see that sister sitting right there yeah my are you with me oh you knew how much an expectation God is so much expectation he wants to he he doesn't ever want to be aart from you that's him it's the Messianic Kingdom it's a romantic Kingdom I'm going to say it again it's a romantic Kingdom it's my story can you raise up your Bible again say my story he made a way and if I and if I go into the next part of this I ain't going to get out for about a two more hours but I want to just say the first thing he restored was friendship and that's why Proverbs 18:24 says a man that ha friends must show himself friendly and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother who is that friend that sticks closer than a brother his bride I'm gonna say it again his bride that's the friend that's closer that's who she is my beloved I'm gonna I'm going to stop right there I feel the Lord telling me to stop but we'll pick it up from there this is where we want to we want to get to in the next one musicians come this is where we want to start with the next one is when Paul catches the inspiration I'm gonna let this everyone get to where they need to get Paul had the he had the Scrolls he had the Old Testament but he catches the inspiration inspiration is this you hear now a lot of people that'll say that picture is a hoax anybody hear that we heard that I gu think last Sunday was mentioned right that's not actually what it is I only have one thing to say one thing brother Henry Henry how could it be a FX when I came from that life I came from that from that logos from Christ the anointing I came out of him you came out of him you're his bride you came out of him because you were in him from the beginning this is what Paul caught he had read Genesis 1 in the beginning God created but all of a sudden he catches the inspiration he catches the inspiration and this is what Paul begins to write according as he has chosen Us in him before Genesis 1: I'm going to say it again he has chosen Us in him before Genesis 1 the foundation of the world was ever laid he already chose us in him woo when I seen this I said PA bless you brother pauloin the spirit that brother Paul in time the same light that said I am Jesus th we came from him I'm going to say it again church we came from him before there was a beginning before everything that there was before any part of the kingdom was ever formed in the Kingdom already that's why he says there is therefore now no condemnation to those that were in Christ Jesus not after the flesh but after the spirit thing what a revelation that and we'll start on there next God bless you you stand to your feet we're grateful to you to God for all he does for being a wonderful audience ly but that's okay we pray that it was something that would bless you and in your in your walk with the Lord forget who
