[33:08] God
[33:10] is good
[33:12] is now are you ready
[33:15] tonight because God is doing wonders
[33:18] around this
[33:20] world and all we're doing is fulfilling
[33:23] the
[33:25] commission that he's called us
[33:27] for do you believe it
[33:31] Church let's turn to the
[33:34] scriptures and this I chose this
[33:38] scripture because this has this whole
[33:41] trip wrapped in this scripture this how
[33:43] great he
[33:47] is Ephesians
[33:55] 3:20 wait for guys up top
[34:01] up now unto
[34:06] him that might be
[34:14] able now unto
[34:17] him that is
[34:19] able to do
[34:24] exceeding
[34:25] abundantly
[34:28] above
[34:29] all that we
[34:32] ask according to the
[34:35] power that worketh in
[34:42] US you may be
[34:45] seated
[34:47] so we read half of the
[34:52] scripture you guys missed a
[34:55] piece
[34:58] okay because when we come to
[35:01] God we don't we we expect sometimes just
[35:05] a little
[35:08] bit but he has the greatest to offer
[35:13] us he has AB exceedingly
[35:17] abundantly above all that we ask
[35:21] for you know so we go to this
[35:24] trip you know and and with with the
[35:27] calling that God has given our
[35:32] pastor you know he one thing we've
[35:36] learned that he won't move unless God is
[35:40] calling him to
[35:43] move because it's a continuation of our
[35:46] founding
[35:49] Pastor so we go to
[35:52] Poland you know this is our second trip
[35:54] to
[35:55] Poland you know these
[35:59] people they really got my
[36:03] attention you know these our people
[36:05] you've seen similar to like brother
[36:11] Morton Real
[36:14] reserved so we go on the first
[36:17] trip we preach the
[36:20] gospel and they begin to open up a
[36:23] little bit at a
[36:25] time and as we were leaving the first
[36:30] trip you know they began to explain to
[36:33] us on how the gospel had come to
[36:40] Poland and how that they wanted us to
[36:43] come
[36:45] back but at this point they were still
[36:50] reserved you know they still had that
[36:53] straight
[36:55] face
[36:58] with with it's it they don't have a
[37:00] whole lot of emotion in their
[37:04] face and so we go on the second
[37:07] trip you know and there's nothing that
[37:09] we could have done
[37:12] ourselves but just remember the power of
[37:15] God is beginning to work
[37:19] here so we start the
[37:23] convention and it's and it's like a camp
[37:26] meeting
[37:28] and the brothers began to start
[37:31] preaching but halfway
[37:36] through these brothers were expecting
[37:38] the power of God so
[37:43] much that they said you know what Friday
[37:47] night and Saturday night we're g to have
[37:51] an Evangelistic
[37:54] service and we're going to invite
[37:56] everybody in the
[37:59] town to come and
[38:02] see so we we we are here Friday
[38:06] night you know still the thing hadn't
[38:09] really broken out
[38:12] openly but as the power of God began to
[38:15] come
[38:17] down I want you to remember it the
[38:21] easiest way to to explain it's a a
[38:24] people that they don't jump and Shout I
[38:30] there are people that is so
[38:34] sincere that when they
[38:36] sing when they pray you can feel the
[38:39] presence of
[38:41] God but there're still are reserved
[38:45] [Music]
[38:46] people but come Friday
[38:49] night the presence of God began to open
[38:54] up and brothers were running to the
[38:59] front their
[39:02] expressions began to open
[39:05] up they began to
[39:07] cry you know and all this
[39:10] happened let me explain this here's
[39:13] brother Danny Friday
[39:16] night he is preaching the
[39:19] gospel but then he opens up an atomic
[39:23] bomb and he says Satan
[39:27] he says you when you talk about the
[39:30] devil he says all he has is a
[39:33] title he said that's all he had but then
[39:37] he began to speak on how when he
[39:39] stripped of
[39:42] that and then the thing began to open
[39:45] up and the people's Expressions began to
[39:51] change so we had pastors running to the
[39:55] front
[39:58] to get prayed
[40:00] for you know it was something powerful
[40:03] that
[40:05] happened you know and then they began to
[40:08] say some of the things that they
[40:10] said they said where have you guys
[40:14] been we've never heard of you
[40:18] guys are we raising ourselves
[40:21] up no we're raising almighty
[40:24] God because we I always
[40:28] wonder you know when when is this
[40:30] uniting time going to really take
[40:34] place but when you begin to see it
[40:38] unfold Church we're in the midst of
[40:41] it you talk about a Revival
[40:46] unleashing that's what's happening in
[40:49] po you know this thing that happened in
[40:53] Africa you don't realize
[41:03] 97,000 we're not talking about people
[41:06] that were in the message their whole
[41:10] lives we're talking about
[41:13] people that are coming to the
[41:16] message from
[41:18] denomination you know and now this is
[41:20] beginning to roll over the
[41:24] country the very same God
[41:27] El that we have here it's beginning to
[41:32] explode the gospel is being made
[41:35] alive why because someone showed
[41:39] us how to call God on the
[41:42] scene someone showed
[41:45] us that when we rely on
[41:48] him the word is going to
[41:51] do what it promises it's going
[41:54] to that's the only gospel that we
[41:58] know it's not a story but it's a
[42:02] gospel that's been made
[42:05] alive because Church show me has anyone
[42:09] else done
[42:11] this has anyone
[42:13] else died on the cross died on the
[42:18] cross has anyone else
[42:22] resurrected has anyone else made the
[42:24] word produced
[42:30] show me where it's
[42:33] happening and our founding Pastor he
[42:35] preached that many
[42:38] times show me where the gospel is being
[42:43] preached and be made
[42:46] alive so there's only one that does
[42:49] it there's only one that died on
[42:51] the there's only one that
[42:54] resurrected there's only one that makes
[42:56] his word come to
[42:59] pass it's not
[43:01] me it's not the
[43:03] team but it's God in this last
[43:07] dayself
[43:09] known but Church what what condition
[43:12] should that make us
[43:14] in that's why this scripture now let's
[43:17] read it
[43:20] right and unto
[43:22] him that is
[43:25] able to do
[43:28] exceeding
[43:30] abundantly above all that we
[43:34] ask according to the
[43:37] power that worketh in
[43:40] us that work in
[43:43] us but you still missed it brother
[43:46] J let's read it
[43:48] again this is what God is doing in this
[43:53] day are you
[43:55] ready two more
[43:57] minutes I just need your undivided
[43:59] attention for two more
[44:01] minutes we
[44:03] came not for another Wednesday
[44:07] service but because I came
[44:09] tonight because I knew God had a purpose
[44:12] in
[44:15] this now unto
[44:17] him that is
[44:19] able to do
[44:22] exceeding
[44:24] abundantly above all we
[44:27] ask according to the
[44:30] power that worketh in
[44:35] us this it
[44:38] again did anyone catch
[44:42] it
[44:47] hear you see that now we got
[44:52] it it's not just what we
[44:54] ask
[44:57] he said I'm going to do much further
[44:59] than
[45:00] that he say I'm going to do
[45:04] abundantly
[45:06] exceedingly
[45:07] abundantly above all you
[45:10] ask and
[45:12] think all you got to do is think about
[45:16] it that's the god that we
[45:18] know because the desires of your
[45:22] heart that's why he
[45:24] produces not just what we ask
[45:27] for but if you think it he will answer
[45:32] not just what you
[45:34] ask but
[45:36] exceedingly
[45:37] abundantly above all that and that's
[45:41] what happened
[45:42] our we went to take the
[45:45] gospel but it was made
[45:48] alive because this ministry does
[45:51] more there was this young
[45:54] man and and he kind of stuck to us like
[45:59] glue he said I see so
[46:03] many missionaries come
[46:06] through he says but you guys are
[46:10] different so I says how are we
[46:13] different he says you actually want to
[46:15] spend time with
[46:20] [Applause]
[46:24] me
[46:40] may the Lord richly bless you this
[46:41] evening I'd like to turn over to 1
[46:44] Corinthians 1
[46:46] 1013 you
[46:50] would
[46:54] 13
[46:58] GNA Go in English because I'm trying to
[47:00] losen up a little bit of my
[47:06] English says I I urge you I I urge you
[47:09] my brothers and sisters for the sake of
[47:11] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to
[47:13] agree to live in unity with one
[47:23] another amen
[47:26] I just want to say that it's a privilege
[47:28] to be part of this
[47:32] team was really a privilege to be able
[47:34] to go on this
[47:37] trip um to be part of the what the Lord
[47:41] is doing through to this through through
[47:44] this
[47:48] ministry and the most important thing to
[47:51] see that I see
[47:53] is how God is uniting in the
[47:58] bride how is it that God is uniting all
[48:00] all all the pastors and bringing them
[48:05] together to come and look into One
[48:10] Direction as he talk about in uh in
[48:12] Poland we we're always looking for the
[48:15] last one to come
[48:19] right but there is something that I that
[48:21] c my attention and and I'd like to read
[48:23] it to you brother B bam
[48:30] I believe this that in the great Realms
[48:33] of the church the only thing that is
[48:34] holding
[48:40] off the only thing that is holding off
[48:43] the coming of the of our Lord Jesus for
[48:45] his
[48:49] church and setting up of uh his
[48:54] kingdom
[48:56] is the difference between the Full
[48:58] Gospel
[49:06] people that's
[49:08] right as long one as long as one say I
[49:12] belong to
[49:15] this I belong to
[49:18] that I receive this I did
[49:21] that and don't recognize the brother as
[49:24] your brother
[49:27] I think that's one of the hindrances
[49:29] that we have
[49:31] now one of the hindrances of not
[49:34] receiving or Jesus or Jesus Christ
[49:40] coming that makes me think
[49:44] uh am I holding in any way he's
[49:49] coming you can put your name
[49:52] there I say is is julan holding up his
[50:00] coming BR the Mage as the eagle Spirit
[50:03] up her
[50:11] nest my Ministry is a Ministry trying to
[50:13] unite the body of Christ
[50:18] together no unite denominations to a to
[50:21] another
[50:24] denomination unite brothers and
[50:28] sisters as one group of
[50:31] people one in
[50:34] purpose one in heart one in
[50:38] unity to see the coming of the Lord
[50:42] Jesus to me that's very
[50:44] clear aren we doing
[50:48] this are we part of this
[50:52] ministry I think that's what we're
[50:53] living today that what brother BR
[50:55] speaking about here my
[51:00] Ministry is trying to unite the body of
[51:04] Christ and that's what I'm seeing on
[51:06] these
[51:08] missionary I believe the Lord has
[51:10] already started the
[51:14] work uniting the
[51:16] bride and God is using this ministry to
[51:19] break down difference between
[51:24] Breen wonderful to see the pastors
[51:26] coming
[51:29] together and starting to have Fellowship
[51:31] one one
[51:34] another you see not only in Poland but
[51:38] Africa and everywhere that we've
[51:41] gone Pastor that didn't talk to each
[51:45] other maybe for a long
[51:48] time coming together on
[51:52] agreement and I believe that God that
[51:54] God is is preparing his bride
[51:59] now brother and uh let's turn real quick
[52:03] to Matthew
[52:13] 2236 say master which is the great
[52:15] commandment of the law in the
[52:20] law Jesus say unto him th shall love the
[52:24] Lord that heart thy God with all thy
[52:26] heart with th with all thy soul and with
[52:30] all thy
[52:35] mind this is the first of the great of
[52:38] this is the first and great
[52:41] commandment and the second is like to
[52:44] like un to
[52:45] it thou shallal love thy neighbor as
[52:51] thyself brother the Church of God
[52:56] and all of them very fine
[52:59] men all the groups I just stood I just
[53:03] stood between them and
[53:06] say we're
[53:08] brothers don't argue one
[53:11] another now if Satan if Satan can't keep
[53:14] us can't keep us fighting at one
[53:18] another he don't have to
[53:21] fight but we train our guns unto him
[53:27] and away from one
[53:29] another go to loving one
[53:33] another fellowship fellowshipping one
[53:37] another then the Millennium will
[53:42] start the
[53:45] Lord I think we as a church we should
[53:48] set a
[53:51] sample everyone has to got everyone has
[53:54] to
[53:56] has got something to do
[54:00] now everyone uh of you get right in your
[54:07] church and work as hard as you can for
[54:10] your local
[54:14] church but don't ever
[54:17] criticize if you know something bad
[54:19] about the other
[54:22] side don't say and don't don't say
[54:25] don't say nothing about
[54:27] it see keep it keep that to
[54:31] yourself the enemy just leaves just
[54:33] listening to hear
[54:36] that see don't let don't let him know
[54:41] nothing don't speak nothing
[54:44] out then he won't know nothing about
[54:48] it see keep it to yourself and pray
[54:53] think my time is gone
[54:56] [Applause]
[55:24] Blan well there's other veterans don't
[55:26] don't
[55:28] misunderstood I don't want to talk about
[55:30] my age because I feel
[55:34] young but this trip meant a lot to me I
[55:38] I uh hadn't really planned on
[55:43] going I I thought the team that was
[55:45] going was going to
[55:47] just somebody
[55:51] else so two days before the trip
[55:56] I'm in there in the office with brother
[55:59] Caleb and he goes
[56:03] audible you know what audible means in
[56:05] the game of
[56:06] football we're going to change the
[56:09] play he says audible do you want to go
[56:12] to to
[56:15] Poland I go you know the answer to that
[56:21] question go well
[56:23] sure
[56:26] God got to be ready at any
[56:30] time to go do our
[56:33] part and I would like to read a
[56:35] scripture in Hebrews
[56:40] 11 and I have a little
[56:44] thought and I'm trying to keep my time
[56:47] here I've already used one minute I
[56:52] just but this thought is
[56:57] they without
[57:01] us Hebrews 11: 38 to
[57:08] 40
[57:09] amen of whom the world was not worthy
[57:12] they wandered in deserts and in
[57:14] mountains and in dens and caves of the
[57:23] Earth
[57:25] and these all having obtained a good
[57:28] report through faith received not the
[57:39] promise and I want you to really catch
[57:41] this next verse we've used it so many
[57:48] times and and we're always going to say
[57:50] well this is the the goal of this is to
[57:53] talk about the Saints of the Old
[58:00] Testament it just talked about how they
[58:02] were in the mountains and dens and how
[58:04] they were persecuted and so
[58:10] forth and they even obtained a a a good
[58:13] report through faith or
[58:19] revelation God having provided some
[58:23] better thing for for
[58:30] us would you all read that with
[58:33] me real
[58:36] slow God having provided something
[58:41] better for
[58:46] us so who is it
[58:48] for
[58:50] us okay I want to leave that right there
[58:54] just for a second
[58:57] you know the thing that really caught my
[59:01] attention in these meetings was an
[59:03] elderly
[59:07] brother and he uh he got up there and
[59:11] testified him and his wife
[59:17] sng and can you go ahead and give me
[59:20] that first clip
[59:23] please
[59:25] and as they he does that there it
[59:28] is there's the
[59:31] brother and his wife
[59:35] singing did you have that little audio
[59:37] clip
[59:39] Josh see if it's we can hear
[59:42] it it is concerning the
[59:46] Bible and the second song is about
[59:51] prayer the Bible has hundreds of years
[59:59] it gave me power and I believe it gave
[1:00:01] me power also to
[1:00:05] you yes so he's talking about how he's
[1:00:09] had this Bible and and he believes this
[1:00:11] Bible has survived hundreds of
[1:00:19] years and this brother his ministry was
[1:00:21] to take
[1:00:23] Bibles
[1:00:25] notice we we read about the Old
[1:00:27] Testament
[1:00:31] Saints they had all the books of the Old
[1:00:36] Testament as they were written by the
[1:00:40] prophets and the word became a written
[1:00:45] word and this brother his whole thing
[1:00:47] was to take Bibles boxes of
[1:00:53] Bibles
[1:00:56] and cross him to the border of
[1:01:01] Russia to me that is
[1:01:05] tremendous he res his own
[1:01:09] life that Bible is talking about he he
[1:01:11] he was taking it literally taking the
[1:01:17] Bible hundreds of
[1:01:20] Bibles and one time he gets there to the
[1:01:23] entrance to go into Russia
[1:01:29] and the soldier there that that's
[1:01:31] guarding the gate the entrance into
[1:01:36] Russia ask him well what do you have
[1:01:41] there he goes I have Russian
[1:01:47] Bibles the Russian soldiers said well
[1:01:49] you know you know I don't have to let
[1:01:51] you in with this
[1:01:53] right
[1:01:56] yeah they don't they're a Godless Nation
[1:01:59] overall
[1:02:01] right oh oh God God's there now but
[1:02:05] overall they are a Godless
[1:02:10] nation and the soldier says well give me
[1:02:12] a
[1:02:14] Bible so he goes to look at the
[1:02:18] Bibles he opens up the
[1:02:21] boxes and the Bibles were in the lane a
[1:02:25] Bulgarian am I saying that Bulgarian
[1:02:31] language these are Bulgarian
[1:02:35] Bibles but the Lord moved on his
[1:02:39] heart and at the end of of it
[1:02:43] all this Soldier says you know I know
[1:02:45] some little towns where there's a lot of
[1:02:48] Bulgarian
[1:02:52] people take these Bible
[1:02:54] to those little
[1:02:57] towns gives them Bibles in their own
[1:03:03] language that's how much this man wanted
[1:03:05] to get out the written
[1:03:10] word can you show me that second picture
[1:03:15] there and then this last
[1:03:19] picture and and the picture is courtesy
[1:03:21] courtesy of my buddy
[1:03:23] Tommy
[1:03:26] after he had given his testimony the
[1:03:28] previous
[1:03:31] service when I went around the back I
[1:03:33] saw him and I and I went like this to
[1:03:38] him and he started
[1:03:43] crying so when this happened is the the
[1:03:47] pastors up there giving the dismissal
[1:03:49] the meetings are basically
[1:03:53] over
[1:03:56] and he mentions now our brother was so
[1:03:59] impressed and so happy and glad because
[1:04:02] the brother Jimmy showing him this
[1:04:13] respect so he gets up out of his chair
[1:04:16] comes all the way around where I'm on
[1:04:18] the end and he gives me this big
[1:04:22] hug I see a man with a written
[1:04:27] word that now has the spirit in his
[1:04:30] heart he's talking about a Bible that
[1:04:33] survived hundreds of years and gone to
[1:04:34] many
[1:04:39] places but I represent not a written
[1:04:42] word
[1:04:46] anymore oh yeah it's written all
[1:04:49] right but not on
[1:04:51] paper it's not in a computer
[1:04:55] a taet it's a living
[1:04:58] word amen amen so let's go back to that
[1:05:03] scripture
[1:05:04] again amen my time is going
[1:05:09] I'm yeah no I've only been going nine
[1:05:15] minutes so far
[1:05:18] but brother
[1:05:21] Mark so let's go back to that scripture
[1:05:23] verse 4
[1:05:27] God having provided a better thing for
[1:05:29] us
[1:05:32] amen what is this better thing that God
[1:05:36] provided for
[1:05:42] us amen the message of
[1:05:47] what of the
[1:05:50] Resurrection the message of a better
[1:05:56] sacrifice because speaking of the Old
[1:05:58] Testament
[1:06:01] Saints was previously in Hebrews 11
[1:06:04] that's who it's talking
[1:06:06] about they had the the sacrifices of
[1:06:09] bulls and
[1:06:13] goats and
[1:06:15] Bulls but the blood of an
[1:06:19] animal the life that would come out of
[1:06:21] that animal when the blood left it
[1:06:28] could not come back upon the
[1:06:32] believer it covered their
[1:06:36] sin but it couldn't divorce their
[1:06:40] sin it couldn't kill the desire of
[1:06:46] sin so God provided us a perfect
[1:06:52] Sacrifice from a perfect
[1:06:55] blood that God himself became
[1:07:00] human and the spirit of God that was in
[1:07:05] Jesus when that blood cell
[1:07:09] broke it released the Holy
[1:07:12] Spirit and that Spirit now can come back
[1:07:15] upon
[1:07:17] us that is the something better that's
[1:07:21] been provided for us
[1:07:26] now let's read the rest of the
[1:07:28] verse because I never used to understand
[1:07:30] this
[1:07:31] verse but I saw that older brother he
[1:07:33] he's done his
[1:07:36] job he taken the written
[1:07:39] word he takes it to a place and then
[1:07:41] from there God gets it to where it's
[1:07:43] supposed to
[1:07:45] go what about us with this
[1:07:49] message have we taken this message to
[1:07:52] where it needs to go
[1:07:55] and then from there God will get it to
[1:07:57] the people that he has
[1:08:02] predestinated amen
[1:08:04] amen God having provided something
[1:08:07] better for
[1:08:11] us that
[1:08:15] they without
[1:08:18] us should not be made
[1:08:22] perfect
[1:08:26] doesn't that make you feel
[1:08:30] responsible they're waiting on
[1:08:38] us let's flip the coin
[1:08:44] now what are they to
[1:08:49] us if we don't have
[1:08:52] them
[1:08:55] huh do you ever think think about it
[1:08:57] like
[1:08:58] that what are we to
[1:09:03] them we're their
[1:09:08] completeness we're their
[1:09:11] perfection we're the ones that can bring
[1:09:13] them
[1:09:15] forth that through this better
[1:09:19] way better
[1:09:22] sacrifice this living
[1:09:25] message no longer just written on
[1:09:28] paper but living in the hearts of the
[1:09:32] believer can also change
[1:09:35] them you know going to finish with this
[1:09:39] one
[1:09:40] quote my time
[1:09:43] is oh gosh I only have two
[1:09:47] minutes amen amen out of the
[1:09:52] token full
[1:09:56] obedience to the full word of
[1:10:01] God
[1:10:03] entitles
[1:10:05] me did I read it
[1:10:08] right entitles
[1:10:11] us to the
[1:10:15] Token full obedience to the full
[1:10:21] word how can you have the full word
[1:10:24] without the full
[1:10:29] body are you a
[1:10:33] word you used to be a
[1:10:36] thought God
[1:10:38] spoke he created
[1:10:40] you you're a
[1:10:42] thought expressed by
[1:10:45] God so how are you going to have the
[1:10:47] fullness of the
[1:10:50] word without the
[1:10:52] fullness
[1:10:54] of the
[1:10:57] body praise the Lord
[1:10:59] Jesus just about done
[1:11:02] here that's how important in the
[1:11:04] fellowship
[1:11:06] is how is it that under the fellowship
[1:11:10] through Redemption by the
[1:11:14] blood the spirit of
[1:11:17] God can flow through the
[1:11:20] body and sanctify us through

[1:17:27] but you know I think we I think it's
[1:17:29] really easy to tell each other all these
[1:17:31] things in here
[1:17:34] right it's really easy to testify to
[1:17:36] each
[1:17:40] other but how many of us go out there
[1:17:42] and do it to people that aren't in
[1:17:47] church that's that's a that's a whole
[1:17:49] another ball game go try going and
[1:17:51] speaking to somebody that doesn't
[1:17:52] believe in God
[1:17:56] or maybe they're bounded by you know a
[1:18:00] denomination or
[1:18:04] religion that's no I don't want to say
[1:18:06] nothing because they won't believe
[1:18:08] me they're gonna get mad at me they're
[1:18:11] GNA fire
[1:18:13] me who
[1:18:15] cares who
[1:18:17] cares God will still take care of you
[1:18:19] don't
[1:18:20] worry that's not for us to worry about
[1:18:24] right and we shouldn't we shouldn't stop
[1:18:26] ourselves from doing
[1:18:30] anything just
[1:18:32] because we think they might not receive
[1:18:38] it you never
[1:18:41] know you just never
[1:18:44] know
[1:18:46] I it was a team effort to get me in
[1:18:51] here they they worked as a team my my my
[1:18:54] wife my
[1:18:56] grandfather
[1:18:59] grandmother and you know they put the
[1:19:02] bait on the
[1:19:04] hood and then I hear brother Jerry
[1:19:07] brother Danny brother Anthony first time
[1:19:12] well they sunk the hook
[1:19:14] in and then the Ley and brother Tommy
[1:19:18] just Reed me
[1:19:21] in
[1:19:23] but we're too
[1:19:26] scared the funny thing is though that
[1:19:29] sometimes we can act like we can go out
[1:19:31] there and act just
[1:19:33] as dumb as everybody else just be
[1:19:38] real we do
[1:19:41] sometimes well there was women over
[1:19:43] there in Poland that when we went to go
[1:19:45] eat not just women there was it was like
[1:19:47] a boy
[1:19:48] to was a
[1:19:51] boy out there on the street hey you're
[1:19:53] looking for some drinks you want to go
[1:19:55] to the strip club we'll give you
[1:20:01] discounts and after the first one
[1:20:03] brother Tommy's like man
[1:20:07] man look at how Brave they
[1:20:11] are imagine if we could be that
[1:20:14] way and I was like you're
[1:20:18] righto to
[1:20:21] myself so every time one came up to us
[1:20:24] again after that I just told him God
[1:20:26] bless you Jesus Christ loves
[1:20:30] you and that was always the end of the
[1:20:34] conversation but why can't we do
[1:20:37] that I mean sister sister Jen Jen sister
[1:20:42] Jennifer's got a awesome testimony
[1:20:46] jennif there's so many others that have

[1:22:00] the funny thing about brother

[1:22:07] Mark tried to hug him and he'd run so
[1:22:11] fast from you
[1:22:14] was and as as uh the years have gone
[1:22:20] by exactly we wore him down
[1:22:25] buddy now now he can't stop hugging

[1:22:34] you know what
[1:22:38] that's I'm
[1:22:40] just he's he's exactly
[1:22:44] right it's the love of

[1:22:51] um
[1:22:53] brother julan julan I I got him into a
[1:22:56] little bit of trouble little bit but

[1:23:12] know brother julan is going to be
[1:23:13] preaching you know one of the
[1:23:17] services so as a matter of fact that
[1:23:20] Thursday night the very first service
[1:23:25] he was he was upset at
[1:23:27] me he says I got to preach tonight
[1:23:31] now but what was amazing about
[1:23:35] that he preached s such a simple message
[1:23:39] that that
[1:23:42] evening he preached about
[1:23:44] love exactly what we've been preaching
[1:23:48] tonight and little did he know
[1:23:53] that message that he
[1:23:56] preached set up the the entire
[1:24:03] weekend wasn't
[1:24:07] [Music]
[1:24:08] flashy but it was it was spoken with
[1:24:12] such
[1:24:14] conviction that I remember um the
[1:24:17] following
[1:24:20] morning we met people from from all
[1:24:24] over Belgium
[1:24:26] Romania ROM um
[1:24:29] Ukraine
[1:24:31] UK some from
[1:24:34] Spain different other
[1:24:36] places and I I got to talking to a to a
[1:24:40] brother from Ukraine he had been he had
[1:24:42] been in there in uh in Poland for for a
[1:24:45] couple years
[1:24:49] now but he but he he said to me that
[1:24:54] morning he goes I don't know how many
[1:24:57] people captured what I captured last
[1:25:02] night he said I
[1:25:05] captured that you
[1:25:07] all came for
[1:25:11] me I like wow wow I mean you you got
[1:25:16] that through a couple of a couple of
[1:25:18] sermons last
[1:25:21] night
[1:25:23] he says the love that that was that was
[1:25:25] demonstrated last
[1:25:30] night as of right
[1:25:32] now he says I can never be the same
[1:25:37] again I'm like wow wow if that happens
[1:25:41] on a Thursday
[1:25:43] night I mean what's going to happen on a
[1:25:45] Friday
[1:25:48] morning what's going to happen on a
[1:25:49] Friday
[1:25:51] night what's going to happen on a
[1:25:53] Saturday
[1:25:54] morning what's going to happen on a
[1:25:56] Saturday night what's going to happen on
[1:25:59] a Sunday
[1:26:00] morning every single
[1:26:03] service it was it was
[1:26:06] something that led to something
[1:26:09] else and the way that the way that the
[1:26:13] way that God has constructed every every
[1:26:16] single time we go out God has
[1:26:18] constructed a
[1:26:21] team
[1:26:23] we don't we don't know what we're what
[1:26:25] really what we're going to
[1:26:28] preach there's no specific uh
[1:26:32] theme
[1:26:34] but it always it always just comes
[1:26:40] together and as I I just want to read a
[1:26:44] just a quick scripture
[1:26:47] here in The Second Epistle of
[1:26:50] John um there's only one chapter to it
[1:26:54] so it's John
[1:26:59] 15 and it reads like
[1:27:02] this and now I beseech thee
[1:27:06] lady not as though I wrote a new
[1:27:10] commandment unto
[1:27:12] thee but that which we had from the
[1:27:15] beginning that we love one
[1:27:20] another and this is love
[1:27:24] that we walk after his
[1:27:26] Commandments this is the
[1:27:29] Commandment that as ye have heard from
[1:27:31] the
[1:27:32] beginning ye should walk in
[1:27:35] it you know and that was that was kind
[1:27:38] of the the theme throughout this this
[1:27:41] entire uh this entire uh
[1:27:47] conference you know it took me back uh
[1:27:50] to December of 20
[1:27:55] 17 we were uh we were about ready to
[1:27:58] leave to to our second trip to to
[1:28:04] Uganda I was uh I was telling my telling
[1:28:07] my
[1:28:10] dad about what we're about what we were
[1:28:13] going to do and and where we where we
[1:28:15] were going to
[1:28:18] go and as we as we finished our convers
[1:28:24] ation he put his hand on my on my
[1:28:28] shoulder and he
[1:28:30] said
[1:28:31] finish my
[1:28:35] vision you know words like that they
[1:28:38] don't you don't take them
[1:28:43] lightly you can say well did your dad
[1:28:45] have a vision of of
[1:28:50] Poland because he always talked talked
[1:28:52] of
[1:28:53] Africa you better believe he
[1:28:57] did you better believe that he had this
[1:29:00] vision of
[1:29:02] Poland he had this vision of
[1:29:05] Norway he had this vision of
[1:29:08] Europe and
[1:29:10] why because he walked in
[1:29:14] it he walked in
[1:29:16] love he walked in
[1:29:19] righteousness and he told us
[1:29:22] and demonstrated to
[1:29:24] us the exact way to
[1:29:29] walk and his
[1:29:31] way he said you never walk
[1:29:37] alone say don't never walk
[1:29:39] alone don't never go by go out by
[1:29:44] yourself and I remember him telling
[1:29:47] telling uh brother cayb brother Tommy
[1:29:50] and I
[1:29:52] Cale Tommy his big his his big thing to
[1:29:58] us was he said stay
[1:30:03] together that wasn't just for us his
[1:30:08] sons but it was for us his
[1:30:14] sons amen amen when we have when when
[1:30:20] there is Success on the missionary
[1:30:24] field it's not just the ones that are
[1:30:28] there that have the
[1:30:30] success but it's all of
[1:30:34] us
[1:30:36] together why because as a
[1:30:39] church and as
[1:30:41] individuals we love the missionary
[1:30:45] field I love to hear when on that Sunday
[1:30:50] as we were leaving
[1:30:55] the one of the pastors
[1:30:58] there I got to know him really really
[1:31:01] well the first time we went to
[1:31:05] Poland got along great with his
[1:31:08] son but he says he told us he goes you
[1:31:12] have captured our
[1:31:16] heart you know when you hear stuff like
[1:31:20] that it makes makes you just feel so so
[1:31:24] humble makes you feel so so so
[1:31:28] small that somebody would
[1:31:31] say you have captured our
[1:31:35] hearts and to let everybody know they in
[1:31:39] New
[1:31:41] Mexico how much we love
[1:31:44] them you
[1:31:46] know every person that was
[1:31:49] there you know as you've as you've heard
[1:31:51] heard uh different
[1:31:54] stories I want to thank sister Abby for
[1:31:57] doing such a wonderful job on that video
[1:31:58] on
[1:32:02] Sunday
[1:32:05] everyone everyone that has that has
[1:32:07] given
[1:32:09] reports have done a fabulous a fabulous
[1:32:13] job you know and when you when you when
[1:32:16] you see people
[1:32:18] there you know as some of the ministers
[1:32:21] have already
[1:32:23] said they're not an emotional
[1:32:28] [Music]
[1:32:29] Bunch but I tell you that Saturday night
[1:32:32] that place was
[1:32:37] rocking I mean there was there was
[1:32:39] Brothers just going
[1:32:42] up I mean they were they were running up
[1:32:44] to the
[1:32:45] altar I mean there was there was there
[1:32:48] was young men just getting up off of
[1:32:50] their seat and just saying
[1:32:54] amen you know and and you see the work
[1:32:57] that God is
[1:33:00] doing is it based on emotion no it's
[1:33:04] not but when you see someone
[1:33:08] truly
[1:33:10] capture what what is being
[1:33:15] displayed what is being brought
[1:33:18] out and they capture that and you see
[1:33:23] how how hungry they are for the
[1:33:28] word you know we don't
[1:33:30] realize and I didn't realize this until
[1:33:33] then until this
[1:33:36] trip that in in the English or excuse me
[1:33:39] in the Polish uh
[1:33:41] language they don't have every
[1:33:45] book they don't have every
[1:33:49] tape that that brother brandham preached
[1:33:52] in their
[1:33:54] language they only have 500
[1:33:58] messages less than
[1:34:01] half of the messages that we all
[1:34:05] have we all can can hear every single
[1:34:10] message but for but for a uh but for but
[1:34:15] for a
[1:34:16] people to to just have maybe 40%

[1:34:26] it even if it's just
[1:34:30] 1% we believe it we have
[1:34:35] 100% And yet sometimes it feels like we
[1:34:37] only believe 1% of
[1:34:41] it you know we we have so many issues
[1:34:47] sometimes believing of what God has done
[1:34:49] for us
[1:34:52] what God is doing for
[1:34:54] us oh but I tell you brothers and
