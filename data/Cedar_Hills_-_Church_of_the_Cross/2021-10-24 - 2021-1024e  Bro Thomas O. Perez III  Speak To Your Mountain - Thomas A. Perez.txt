[Applause] [Music] [Applause] hey [Music] [Applause] amen let's all stand man we have come to the most important part of the service amen amen let me say that again we have come to the most important part of the service we have come expecting great things from the lord and man with this song we'll be introducing our minister our brother omar perez how many are ready for the word he healed the sick and he raised the dead oh five thousand hungry [Music] my god oh my god anything oh my god can't do anything oh my god oh he's got the power he's got the power he's got the power oh he's got the power

oh he's got the power [Music] anything amen how many believe that tonight can your god do anything i believe i believe tonight that and it says see and it says for for verily i say unto you that whosoever it doesn't just say the prophet it doesn't just say the pastor pastor it doesn't just say anybody onto this mountain how many have obstacles in your life how many have gone through obstacles in their life and sometimes it feels like the mountain is unmovable oh it becomes our bills all of a sudden life gets in the way all of a sudden we start messing around a little bit and then we start believing the word of the devil diablo see you ain't got what you think you got but much is lost as they say not a big deal no no no when you are a big deal you're a son and daughter of god that stood up with michaels and though they were outnumbered they could spread to the mountains is because everybody wants to be in charge of everybody else's mountains here was lucifer and the bible tells you that this guy que este hombre he could sing better than anybody else he could sing in his worship to the lord was incredible but one day there was a problem found in him the mountains except for their blood and content every morning the scripture tells us he doesn't say that you have to have this big huge face you could just have the faith of a mustard seed which is about the size of a grain of sand we think it is there anything too hard for our god is there anything i i'll go have you found something that's greater than our god [Music] way like give me a blanket i'm only up here for a few more minutes but i want you to get this he said lord senor if that be you see it is still then bid me to come with you you're not talking about walking on ground where there was the sea and there was nothing to there was no rock system is he began to see his inadequacies and he began to sink but peter he can pick me up he didn't see the waves anymore because he could say to the waves and god come because the bible that nobody cared about it you might say us how do you know that because my cousin carlos carlos nobody wanted him but one you see a man full of success and i just i i'm just like only god could do that for you carlos what a great god we serve we come to this a lot of times jealousy cellos becomes a dangerous thing so what happens a lot of times so i see my brother he has success and then we act like there's no promises coming to us it's not us to say oh how come he got something and i did it is sense no nothing uncertain you gotta give god the praise you've got to give him the glory you gotta give him the honor because my god with men abraham when hermano avraham gave you young people a big key lesbian he wakes up in the morning first thing he does la primera costa que la say praise you have nothing to worry about i got the great opportunity of going to hawaii hawaii aloha from hawaii aloha to hawaii so we were there and last year during the pandemic i
