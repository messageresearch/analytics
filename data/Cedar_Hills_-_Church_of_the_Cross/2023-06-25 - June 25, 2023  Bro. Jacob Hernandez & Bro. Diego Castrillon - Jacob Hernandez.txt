San Mateo blessed are they which do Hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled verses another scripture says the place says they will be satisfied amen do you have any tonight I believe God can satisfy it is because he's done it for me just back up just a little bit in second Samuel chapter 15. absolutely the rebellious son of David Absalom expels him out of Jerusalem and he's standing back at a distance he's fleeing for his life is soldiers and he's watching Jerusalem from a distance yeah and he can remember how he praised and worshiped God in Jerusalem yeah somebody had taken it from him he wanted to go back it's a deep is the deep in Jerusalem was calling at him he was pulling at him foreign and Desiring he was maybe in despair he's never in this respiration I want it tonight do you want the Deep to call the Deep yes Lord must have that desire because if there's the Deep there has to be a response and God is the response it is adios attention is a young man what's your age 18 16. Keisha King said this is like a little older into my young adulthood I will sit in church yeah as many of you know I was raised in the apostolic belief I would sit there and listen to them but something in my spirit is and and I hesitated as a young man you you you see the brothers up there and did you foreign but as they read the scriptures my spirit was telling me there's more to this I must there's more to this and I want that more yo quiero ESO I'll go I want more of that what you're telling me there's more to this I must there was something deep in me that was calling for the Deep because I if you dig deep and you search in the Deep you will have a responsibility but you gotta dig deep says we have to go a little deeper he did right he encouraged us correct Aya my mouth is getting dry but I found a Fountain of Life so as a young man I had this desire in my heart did I asked my brethren that was before me yo the bishop is a practice deacons ministers where's the fivefold ministry ministerio where is I knew it was necessary and I know and I can see that in this church there is a faithful Ministry it's effective it's effectivo and it's powerful yes and they are men they are men inspired inspiragos by the spirit of God foreign and they're going to help you and I hey to go the last smile and prepare us for the sickness that was my question and I waited yesterday until I entered the ministry if I were to ask when I was a young man they would have said um where is the Bible Ministry you understand their answer to me was that's Old Testament news yesterday I know there's an Old Testament I know there's a new testament there's a division two divisions but this is written in the New Testament there is written over there in Ephesians why are you telling me it's Old Testament news Prophets yes teachers evangelists amen amen that's written over there you know your Bible better than I do is Yo Mi Corazon Iglesia perfecting of the Saints amen so there was a hunger and a thirst in my spirit is and ever since I walked in that door yeah ever since I walked in that door brother Daniel opened the door for me casa you don't even know me you need me you're home and since I got home I have been satisfied yes I have been satisfied you young people grew up in this is you grew up in the message I didn't grow up in the message it was a hunger and still a hunger for me we have to have a hunger on a and a thirst on a daily basis a daily basis you were today our daily bread daily bread let me tell you what we got this morning let me tell you something yeah before I continue continue I was nervous as it was as it is and they squeeze me between the teacher Maestro and the prophet yeah wow glory be to God oh glorious but as we continue this hunger in my spirit is constant it's constantly constant constant power more of God get on Master deals I want to get deeper and I know that there's a response if there's a deep there has to be rich I won't mention something else this brother that stands right next to me yes which do you believe I'm asking you right now do you remember he remembers amen I never forget that thank you for that brother Jim gracias thank you brother amen which do you believe what let's do the Bible or the message and in my Apostolic mindset in memente Apostolic you can imagine what my responsibility the Bible the Bible Brothers this has traveled with me to the prisons Boston Austin uh Boston California California 10 15 years and I know God's in the house because he's wearing a red coat okay he's in the house this is what I grew up with but yet growing up in this there was a hunger amen I needed it satisfied and I keep passing God in my heart there's more to this father there's more to this Lord give it to me Father damn it share with me Lord compartment you know my heart you know my heart is searching for you I need you alone a man after God's Own Heart so again my response was the Bible Brothers the brother's asking me a question but if I answer it this way disaster but the Bible has an answer for everything and you know what brother you were saying the other day four or five Believers from Genesis the old apostolics apostolicos would see us in Spanish we Are Witnesses amen just raise up the banner let's raise up the banner we Are Witnesses amen some of Genesis Revelation yeah so not to Brother Jimmy's response there's no wrong answer is it no no I that felt pretty good yeah the right answer yeah right in the fifth grader won the spelling bee okay and uh and he says Whoa really brother Jim yeah it goes the Bible the Bible without the message has no interpretation and we need help with interpretation I need help and God sent a prophet yes he sent them to me say that again and I got the tail end of brother Tommy seniors Ministry and brother Abraham I heard him play the trumpet his mouth was a trumpet he didn't play Trumpets he didn't play trumpet he was a trumpet and you

afternoon thank you for your prayers last week you didn't see me here there's a character that I'm passionate about it's King David David God testifies about David a man after my own heart David David a man with Glory he gave him Powers give him a great name armies he gave him everything his heart is man of that caliber he said these words it is hard on him that had fell in love with his life sacrifices spirit [Music] the spirit of God David was different in the morning because he was thirsty not of any God of the Living God you are thirsty [Applause] got to do is to look for God when the generals when they were preparing themselves and they would get to the Palace they would tell the priests we need to speak to King David we are ready to go to battle the priest would say you're gonna have to wait because David is praying looking for the presence of God I'm gonna put a little bit of flavor when David knew and he would find his army man King David we're ready to fight Los Angeles armies are ready I imagine King David look at the priest and say four or five days King [Applause] [Music] never lost a single battle did you know that okay he didn't let anything but sometimes we get it that hinders us to look for the one has given us the things in a in anywhere else let's open up our Bibles 11 17. 10 days ago injections trying to help the nature of this to keep myself with energy to work Under the Sun God has delivered me of Allah of a lot of them but what if he wants to examine that yes what if he has chosen simple moment a time a moment foreign [Music] by faith Abraham get it I've paid Abraham when he was tried Christians that we are examined if Abrahams of faith you say why it's important where he was claiming God has delivered me from a lot of things and he wants us I'm speaking about myself I'm speaking about myself imagine this is that I would tell the Lord Lord why me that made my body go crazy a kidney infection and from there on everything got infected and everything that could have gone wrong and even a little bit more in conclusive and conclusions I found myself under pain I'm a military man and I was I was trained to bear with pain and I don't complain but this time I believe I gave birth or I conceived two children because literally dying of pain pero what if I had told the Lord why me I'm your child what are you test me Lord you said you would heal me senor Lord I don't want to go through this pain father help me I'm not gonna go back to church I'm not going back this hurts so much does it make any sense it was my opportunity to be able to Peter seven parakeets of your faith who is he talking to us [Applause] that the trial of your faith being much more precious than a gold Perez though it be tried with fire at the appearing of Jesus Christ we are not and that is of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit we are not in that dispensation to test his children Trump says yasun drama and he dramatizes it he said the father says do you think that my children are mature enough [Applause] mature enough the holy spirit says yes yes they are I have thrown all diseases I have killed his wife I have taken away his children I have taken away Lord that's my church [Applause] what are you gonna do why me that we are ready to adoption day that's right Hallelujah you're not going to be able to get to to go away for to escape forecast

thousand dollars it's gonna get there you cannot escape from that yeah and in the middle of that situation I told my wife so did you see and hear that he said yes I did here come there the Lord made himself present and the scene totally changed for the trials I will never forget that message it is an honor you believe that you're mature enough if the musicians can come forth how do you know that you're mature because the children they fight when a child has a toy electron the other child feels Envy Christian videos it's because we haven't been mature enough but church today is the time and
