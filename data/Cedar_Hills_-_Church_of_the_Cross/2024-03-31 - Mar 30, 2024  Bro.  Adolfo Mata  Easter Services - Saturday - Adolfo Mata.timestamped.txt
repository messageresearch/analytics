[57:43] cough and I can't avoid
[57:46] it so if you can forgive
[57:49] me I begin to cough because I'm speaking
[57:53] in
[57:55] tongues
[57:56] God bless
[57:57] you I know that you're
[58:02] standing open your Bibles to the Book of
[58:05] Matthew chapter
[58:07] 16 and we'll read verse
[58:25] four
[58:27] says a wicked and adulterous generation
[58:29] seeketh after a sign and there shall no
[58:32] sign be given unto it but the sign of
[58:34] prophet Jonas and left them and
[58:38] departed let us
[58:40] pray beloved
[58:43] God lord we give you thanks this
[58:47] evening for allowing us to be here
[58:49] congregated
[58:52] Lord to sing those songs
[58:55] of
[58:56] to speak of your
[59:00] word Lord It's a privilege not given to
[59:05] everyone but we give you thanks for this
[59:11] time we ask that you may accompany us
[59:13] from beginning to
[59:16] end we ask in the name of Lord Jesus
[59:18] Christ amen
[59:21] amen you can please take your seat
[59:25] SE
[59:28] now I don't speak too
[59:34] extensively I've learned to be that I'm
[59:37] a believer of the message of the
[59:40] hour so I Don't Preach over the
[59:47] hour I believe we're we're we're
[59:49] Believers of the
[59:51] message our message to follow this
[59:55] evening
[59:56] is the sign of the
[1:00:00] Resurrection now the scripture that we
[1:00:02] just
[1:00:04] read it's when Jesus
[1:00:07] Christ speaking to the
[1:00:10] Pharisees and the SES were
[1:00:13] there and these two
[1:00:17] groups they ask for the Lord for a
[1:00:22] sign and for them to give them a sign of
[1:00:24] Heaven
[1:00:28] so the Lord responds to this
[1:00:33] petition and he says you know the
[1:00:40] times when you go out and you see that
[1:00:42] the skies are
[1:00:44] red he says it's a good
[1:00:50] time when you see that the sky is red
[1:00:53] and and it's dark
[1:00:54] clouds
[1:00:56] is because a storm is
[1:00:59] coming so you have
[1:01:06] learned to discern or see the the signs
[1:01:09] of the
[1:01:12] time and then he tells them you are
[1:01:17] hypocrites a hypocrite is a person that
[1:01:19] is
[1:01:24] not says you are hypocrites because you
[1:01:27] can discern the
[1:01:30] sky but the signs of the
[1:01:34] time you cannot discern
[1:01:41] amen so they could see what was going to
[1:01:47] happen but they could not see what God
[1:01:50] was doing in their
[1:01:52] time and then he says unto this
[1:01:54] generation
[1:01:57] he says I will not give you another
[1:02:02] sign but rather the sign of Jonas the
[1:02:08] prophet if you can go it's Matthew
[1:02:11] 12 and it's verse
[1:02:24] 40
[1:02:28] for as Jonas was three days and three
[1:02:31] nights in the whale's belly so shall the
[1:02:33] son of man be three days and three
[1:02:35] nights in the heart of the
[1:02:39] earth so this is what Jesus was speaking
[1:02:44] today so now we have something to
[1:02:46] compare
[1:02:48] to the days of prophet
[1:02:51] [Music]
[1:02:52] Jonas and the days of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:58] Jonas was in the in the belly of of the
[1:03:00] great fish for three
[1:03:04] days and also
[1:03:07] Jesus was in the heart of the
[1:03:11] Earth the same time three
[1:03:16] days so we can enter a little little
[1:03:19] further into
[1:03:21] that let's just see for a moment
[1:03:24] Jonah
[1:03:26] we know he was going to a different
[1:03:30] place they cast him out of the
[1:03:33] boat a great fish
[1:03:36] comes swallows
[1:03:41] him if I could just imagine the thoughts
[1:03:44] Jonah must have
[1:03:48] had to be inside what the belly of that
[1:03:51] will
[1:03:54] had
[1:03:56] but the whale said the the Bible says
[1:03:58] the whale spews Jonah
[1:04:01] out and when he comes out of the
[1:04:05] fish he begins to
[1:04:11] preach I believe after experience like
[1:04:16] that he was preaching very
[1:04:21] anointed he was preaching with a lot of
[1:04:24] will to speak
[1:04:27] and it was so much the preaching of
[1:04:32] Jonah that the people of nineve
[1:04:38] repented we know that the people of
[1:04:40] Nineveh were the
[1:04:41] worst they were
[1:04:43] idolators they were Wicked
[1:04:46] people but to see Jonah
[1:04:50] preach they
[1:04:53] repented and then the Lord tells us
[1:04:56] that that
[1:04:58] generation will rise
[1:05:01] up and will condemn Our
[1:05:04] Generation because in our
[1:05:07] time a great prophet has
[1:05:10] arose the message of the hour has
[1:05:14] risen a great amount of word has been
[1:05:18] preached and this generation shall rise
[1:05:21] up to be
[1:05:23] witnesses that they repented
[1:05:28] aside from how they
[1:05:33] were so we see that in the same
[1:05:36] way
[1:05:41] Jesus after raising from the
[1:05:45] tomb he rises from the heart of the
[1:05:51] earth and he tells them I was the one
[1:05:54] that was dead
[1:05:57] but now I live
[1:06:00] amen and the scripture
[1:06:03] says that he presented
[1:06:06] alive before his
[1:06:10] disciples they were a bit
[1:06:13] fearful but he said I'm
[1:06:17] Jesus you should
[1:06:19] eat or give me to eat give me
[1:06:24] fish
[1:06:26] touch touch my
[1:06:27] hand they pierced me
[1:06:31] here that's a
[1:06:35] sign that even though he ascended up
[1:06:39] high it shall never take away from from
[1:06:42] from from the hand of
[1:06:43] Jesus it's a
[1:06:46] memorial of what he did for
[1:06:49] us but he presented himself
[1:06:52] alive and he said I am Jesus
[1:06:57] he said now I am among
[1:07:00] you and I am proving to
[1:07:02] you that I am
[1:07:05] alive that I am not dead
[1:07:12] amen so the theme of this
[1:07:19] meeting is you're celebrating a
[1:07:22] historical
[1:07:24] Resurrection or a
[1:07:26] sign of the
[1:07:30] Resurrection it's one thing or the
[1:07:34] other we celebrate a historical
[1:07:39] Resurrection right now all the
[1:07:41] denominational
[1:07:43] churches the churches of the message of
[1:07:45] the
[1:07:48] hour there are special meetings this
[1:07:50] this
[1:07:51] weekend and it's
[1:07:54] everywhere they're celebrating the
[1:07:58] resurrection of of the Lord of Our Lord
[1:08:00] from the from the
[1:08:02] dead but
[1:08:05] truly is he alive Among
[1:08:07] Us
[1:08:10] amen is there a
[1:08:15] sign that shows us that he is alive amen
[1:08:19] that is what we seek
[1:08:21] for we search for a
[1:08:24] sign and the Church of the Living
[1:08:28] God must have a
[1:08:32] sign that he is among us because he
[1:08:38] said the things that I
[1:08:41] did
[1:08:44] you ye shall do
[1:08:48] also and greater than these things shall
[1:08:50] you
[1:08:52] do because I go unto the father
[1:08:56] and I will send you the
[1:09:00] comforter so you will do Greater
[1:09:05] Works you'll do greater things more
[1:09:08] things so the
[1:09:10] church the called
[1:09:13] out they must have the
[1:09:17] sign of the Resurrection in our
[1:09:20] mid that he is alive amen
[1:09:24] amen
[1:09:27] blessed be the name of the
[1:09:31] Lord now what did Jonas
[1:09:33] do because we go
[1:09:38] parallel of Jesus and
[1:09:41] Jonah so
[1:09:45] Jonah after coming out of the belly of
[1:09:48] the great
[1:09:50] fish he said I was as a dead
[1:09:54] one
[1:09:56] I considered myself a dead
[1:09:58] person but I came
[1:10:01] out and he came out
[1:10:05] preaching
[1:10:07] Glory now what did Jesus
[1:10:10] do didn't he do the same
[1:10:14] thing he began to
[1:10:17] preach even before
[1:10:20] resurrecting he was preaching to the
[1:10:22] Lost
[1:10:24] Souls but he rose
[1:10:28] preaching and then he began to
[1:10:33] commission what is called the Great
[1:10:35] Commission go ye to all the
[1:10:39] world and preach this
[1:10:42] gospel to every
[1:10:45] creature and all he that repenteth shall
[1:10:48] be baptized shall be saved amen
[1:10:54] amen so he gave the
[1:10:57] commission same as
[1:11:00] Jonah to preach the
[1:11:03] gospel here's where I want to make a
[1:11:06] parenthesis to
[1:11:10] preach does not mean to
[1:11:15] speak every one of us can
[1:11:19] speak everyone can
[1:11:23] speak but not everyone one can
[1:11:26] preach because to
[1:11:30] preach is to take the
[1:11:32] demonstration and the
[1:11:35] power that he is alive
[1:11:40] amen today we have a lot of people
[1:11:44] speaking but very few are
[1:11:50] preaching there are people that are
[1:11:52] dedicated just to give pamphlets out
[1:11:55] that's fine I have nothing against of
[1:12:01] that there's other people that are
[1:12:03] dedicated just to press the button
[1:12:06] play that's
[1:12:09] fine but that is not
[1:12:12] preaching that's not
[1:12:14] preaching and
[1:12:16] Jonah he was preaching amen
[1:12:23] amen right now with the technology of
[1:12:28] Internet anyone who has access to
[1:12:34] Internet they have access to all the
[1:12:36] message of the
[1:12:41] hour so it's not that we're lacking more
[1:12:44] message we have the message
[1:12:47] already the
[1:12:50] Bible has been distributed
[1:12:54] everywhere there are people that still
[1:12:55] need
[1:12:57] Bibles but the great part of the
[1:12:59] world they have a
[1:13:03] Bible but not because of
[1:13:06] that does that mean that they're
[1:13:10] preaching doesn't mean that because of
[1:13:12] that they have the
[1:13:15] sign of the resurrection of
[1:13:19] Jesus because he is
[1:13:23] alive and for Jesus to be
[1:13:28] alive he must be dwelling in
[1:13:33] someone Jesus
[1:13:37] Christ needs to be dwelling in a
[1:13:41] person so that he can present himself as
[1:13:44] a living Christ amen
[1:13:47] amen that's why Jesus
[1:13:50] said I was the one that was
[1:13:54] dead but I have
[1:13:57] resurrected and what sign is of
[1:14:01] this well give me to eat so that you can
[1:14:04] see that I can
[1:14:08] eat there's no problem that we show the
[1:14:12] sign especially if they give us a burger
[1:14:14] a hamburger or
[1:14:17] something with pleasure I'll I'll show
[1:14:19] you the
[1:14:21] sign many have just the word
[1:14:25] but it's a word that is
[1:14:27] deaden
[1:14:30] amen the word
[1:14:33] kth but it's the
[1:14:36] spirit that quickens that
[1:14:40] word in other words it gives life to
[1:14:43] that
[1:14:45] word that's why Jesus said the words
[1:14:47] that I
[1:14:49] speaketh they are spirit and they are
[1:14:54] life
[1:14:55] this word is
[1:14:57] alive it's
[1:14:59] Spirit you can't see
[1:15:03] it you hear the voice that I
[1:15:06] have and it's
[1:15:08] invisible but
[1:15:10] nevertheless that it's a spirit and it's
[1:15:14] life amen
[1:15:18] amen blessed be the name of the
[1:15:23] Lord when Jesus
[1:15:26] Rose Among the
[1:15:29] dead he said if the
[1:15:33] spirit that has risen me from the
[1:15:38] dead if that spirit is among
[1:15:42] you they will resurrect
[1:15:45] you even though ye be
[1:15:49] dead dogmas trans transgressions or
[1:15:53] anything but when Spirit should
[1:15:56] come it will give you
[1:15:59] life and you will know that you are
[1:16:04] alive you will know that you serve a
[1:16:06] living
[1:16:08] God because it's easy to serve a
[1:16:11] religion but when you know
[1:16:14] him
[1:16:16] personally you
[1:16:18] know that what you
[1:16:20] have is not just any
[1:16:23] religion it's not just the
[1:16:28] message it's the living word
[1:16:33] amen blessed be the name of the
[1:16:40] Lord what was the Holy Ghost sent
[1:16:44] for we know the answer to
[1:16:47] that the Holy
[1:16:50] Spirit was sent to
[1:16:53] continue
[1:16:55] The Works that Jesus
[1:17:00] began he says there are many things that
[1:17:02] I can't tell
[1:17:04] you but when the spirit of truth shall
[1:17:09] come it will show you these
[1:17:13] things so there was a work to
[1:17:17] do he began the
[1:17:20] work but he didn't finish
[1:17:23] it
[1:17:25] now it's
[1:17:27] depending in men and
[1:17:31] women that they can take this
[1:17:35] seriously and do the works of
[1:17:39] Christ because when this Holy Spirit
[1:17:41] would
[1:17:43] come he will show
[1:17:47] them because they won't speak of
[1:17:53] themselves they will speak speak of
[1:17:59] him time will lack us to speak of him
[1:18:02] amen
[1:18:04] amen blessed be the name of the
[1:18:09] Lord recalculate
[1:18:13] again I won't be too extent my
[1:18:19] preaching A great miracle happened in
[1:18:22] the time of
[1:18:23] Jonah
[1:18:26] that he came out of the the
[1:18:28] whale began to
[1:18:31] preach but
[1:18:33] Jesus speaking on
[1:18:37] that he said I
[1:18:41] now or now there's a one greater than
[1:18:47] Jonah now here among
[1:18:52] you there is one greater than Jonah
[1:18:57] for how tremendous the work of Jonah
[1:19:00] was but the resurrection of
[1:19:03] him and to show himself
[1:19:06] alive he said that is something
[1:19:10] greater that what the prophet Jonah
[1:19:17] did that he was now shown
[1:19:22] alive in these last times
[1:19:28] it was a an old
[1:19:30] story but there was
[1:19:33] someone that arose him from the story or
[1:19:36] from
[1:19:37] history and presented him alive Among
[1:19:43] Us what serves us good to just know the
[1:19:47] history if we don't have the Christ
[1:19:50] resurrected amen
[1:19:53] amen Blessed Be
[1:19:57] him let me just turn the corner
[1:20:02] here in the time of prophet
[1:20:08] Jonas a great Eclipse a solar eclipse
[1:20:12] happened just think on
[1:20:18] that this was someone in according to
[1:20:20] someone an expert on the theme the
[1:20:22] subject Donald wi man brother or from
[1:20:25] Donald
[1:20:29] wisman he said that he can
[1:20:34] testify that the in the inhabitants of
[1:20:38] nineve they saw a solar
[1:20:43] eclipse and then his the history of the
[1:20:45] story uh
[1:20:47] spread that
[1:20:51] Jonah had come out of the womb or the
[1:20:54] belly of the well just think on
[1:21:00] that two great
[1:21:06] signs to see the sun
[1:21:14] blacken and to see a man come out of the
[1:21:17] god that they
[1:21:19] served it wasn't just anything for
[1:21:23] them with great re
[1:21:27] reasoning they paid attention to this
[1:21:32] man they paid attention to the preaching
[1:21:34] he
[1:21:36] had it was something
[1:21:39] Supernatural but I I I I say
[1:21:42] again Jesus
[1:21:45] said one greater than
[1:21:48] Jonah is among
[1:21:51] you in in April
[1:21:55] next
[1:21:57] month we have a solar
[1:22:00] eclipse I was talking
[1:22:05] to he was telling me
[1:22:08] thatb he preached a message on the
[1:22:13] E I haven't heard it I don't know what
[1:22:17] he said about
[1:22:18] that neither do I want to take his
[1:22:22] message but this is what the lord
[1:22:25] gave so there will be a solar
[1:22:30] eclipse the eth next
[1:22:36] month and what I was searching
[1:22:41] for in the trajectory of this
[1:22:45] Eclipse there are two
[1:22:47] cities n that are called
[1:22:51] nineve indana one is in in Indiana
[1:22:55] and then the in
[1:22:58] Ohio and there are other
[1:23:04] five that are close to the TR trajectory
[1:23:06] of this
[1:23:09] Eclipse so in total we have Seven
[1:23:13] Cities and one more in
[1:23:15] Canada that is called
[1:23:20] nineve that the solar eclipse will pass
[1:23:23] through
[1:23:28] isn't that something similar to what
[1:23:30] Jonah was going
[1:23:36] through and during that solar
[1:23:40] eclipse up in the
[1:23:43] stars there is a
[1:23:46] constellation called
[1:23:49] satus now this
[1:23:53] constellation is called the
[1:23:55] constellation of the
[1:23:56] whale or the
[1:24:00] fish
[1:24:03] am so we have above the
[1:24:06] eclipse the
[1:24:08] whale or the great
[1:24:12] fish is that a coincidence
[1:24:16] oh it's a
[1:24:19] sign something very
[1:24:23] interesting that
[1:24:25] n in the
[1:24:29] Hebrew it means the place of the
[1:24:33] fish it was a place of
[1:24:36] fishermen it's the place of the Fish
[1:24:42] N so in the place of the
[1:24:45] fish came out that great
[1:24:49] fish and came out Jonah
[1:24:53] preaching
[1:24:55] so the the scripture that we read in the
[1:24:59] beginning Jesus is speaking to the
[1:25:02] Pharisees speaking to the
[1:25:05] SES and he calls them
[1:25:12] Hypocrites and he said you can see the
[1:25:14] signs in in the
[1:25:17] heavens and you're asking me of a
[1:25:20] sign and I'm telling
[1:25:23] you I will not give you another sign
[1:25:28] ex except of the sign of Jonah the
[1:25:35] prophet but they could
[1:25:38] discern by the color of the
[1:25:40] sky if it was a good
[1:25:47] day or the color of the sky if a storm
[1:25:49] was
[1:25:52] coming he said but I won't give you
[1:25:53] another
[1:25:56] sign but the sign of Jonah the
[1:26:00] prophet as he was in the belly of the
[1:26:03] whale
[1:26:05] also the son of the man shall be
[1:26:10] also
[1:26:13] wow
[1:26:15] now the
[1:26:18] Pharisees they could
[1:26:21] discern how the time would be
[1:26:26] if we bring it to our
[1:26:28] time the
[1:26:32] scientist they'll tell you the clipse is
[1:26:34] going to pass through
[1:26:38] here there are so many cities called
[1:26:44] n there's a constellation called
[1:26:48] setus which is the whale a great
[1:26:53] fish
[1:26:57] they can discern the signs that are in
[1:26:59] the
[1:27:01] heaven today is the
[1:27:04] same it was the same as those
[1:27:11] Pharisees they could discern the time of
[1:27:13] their sign of the
[1:27:16] sign but it was going over their
[1:27:21] head the greatest sign ever given to man
[1:27:25] it was Jesus
[1:27:27] Christ it was
[1:27:30] Emmanuel that God is with
[1:27:33] us the greatest
[1:27:36] sign it went over their
[1:27:39] heads the Lord give us ass signs in
[1:27:43] Heavens you
[1:27:47] Hypocrites you can discern the signs of
[1:27:49] the
[1:27:52] heavens and you can't see what present
[1:27:54] before
[1:27:58] you once again that scripture is
[1:28:01] fulfilled and it said that that
[1:28:04] generation shall rise up against this
[1:28:07] generation because they they
[1:28:13] repented and now
[1:28:16] we we have one
[1:28:18] greater than
[1:28:21] Jonah we have someone
[1:28:25] that has resurrected from
[1:28:29] history and has presented him alive
[1:28:32] Among Us amen
[1:28:36] amen blessed be the name of the
[1:28:39] Lord throughout
[1:28:41] time us or
[1:28:43] we we have been
[1:28:47] witnesses that Jesus
[1:28:50] Christ has visited us in our time
[1:28:55] I am a
[1:28:57] witness of What the Lord Has Done in my
[1:29:03] time and I have a well
[1:29:07] knowing to know that he's
[1:29:11] alive that he spoke to
[1:29:15] me that he could be my
[1:29:17] friend
[1:29:22] brothers that is a great
[1:29:25] Revelation and the
[1:29:29] scientist they could discern the
[1:29:31] trajectory of the
[1:29:34] eclipse but they can't
[1:29:38] see who is the one living among
[1:29:41] us they can't
[1:29:44] see the holy
[1:29:47] spirit that the holy spirit in
[1:29:50] itself is a sign of the res Resurrection
[1:29:55] amen
[1:29:56] amen the the holy spirit is a sign of
[1:30:01] the
[1:30:04] resurrection and when you see the Holy
[1:30:06] Spirit
[1:30:07] preaching it's God's preaching or
[1:30:12] speaking that's a
[1:30:14] sign and right now the
[1:30:17] world they're seeing the the
[1:30:21] skies and they can't see what's among
[1:30:23] them
[1:30:25] that Jesus Christ is alive among
[1:30:28] us that he is not
[1:30:31] dead he has
[1:30:34] resurrected he has
[1:30:36] resurrected and lives in me lives in
[1:30:41] you we Are Witnesses of
[1:30:47] this what a tremendous time we are
[1:30:49] living
[1:30:52] in the time of Jonah
[1:30:56] is fulfilled once again in our
[1:30:58] time the Lord
[1:31:00] said you ask a
[1:31:02] sign and I won't give you a
[1:31:06] sign except the sign of Jonah the
[1:31:12] prophet that he was dead in the
[1:31:15] womb but has
[1:31:18] resurrected and when he
[1:31:21] resurrected he didn't go giving p
[1:31:25] he went
[1:31:26] preaching to show to demonstrate that
[1:31:30] Jesus Christ is
[1:31:33] alive amen
[1:31:36] amen that's the sign that we have today
[1:31:39] the best
[1:31:40] sign that he is alive Among Us amen
[1:31:47] amen blessed be the name of the
[1:31:50] Lord are you following

[1:32:02] word and I dedicate all my
[1:32:04] time unto the
[1:32:08] word personal
[1:32:11] comments I've always left them
[1:32:14] aside because I give
[1:32:16] priority to the
[1:32:18] word because the
[1:32:21] word he is the word
[1:32:24] in for in letter
[1:32:25] form he is the
[1:32:27] word in form of
[1:32:30] spirit and he's the one that speaks to

[1:32:57] times likened unto those of
[1:33:04] Jonah that the people wanted to see a
[1:33:06] sign in
[1:33:07] heaven and they could not
[1:33:10] see the great
[1:33:14] sign that Jesus Christ was among
[1:33:18] them Lord
[1:33:22] today we live to similar times to
[1:33:28] those that we can see so many
[1:33:33] things yet we ignore to see
[1:33:36] Jesus that he is
[1:33:39] resurrected that he's
[1:33:42] alive and he lives in his
[1:33:46] people we are the
[1:33:49] sign of his
