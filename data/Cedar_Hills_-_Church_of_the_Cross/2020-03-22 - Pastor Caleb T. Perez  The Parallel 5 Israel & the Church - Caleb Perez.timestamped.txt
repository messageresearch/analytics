[28:28] things
[28:28] Amit is kind of like a Mosin todo esto
[28:30] we simply see implement the vemos that
[28:33] those messages are more relevant right

[28:43] message after message hemos oído
[28:45] mistress and they've been tremendous
[28:47] eunseo tremendous but when it comes to
[28:50] the time of the manifestation or the
[28:52] complete unfolding of these messages
[28:54] pero cuando viene a la manifestation oil
[28:57] development oh the toast in circus it's
[28:59] amazing to look at s-sir pendentive and
[29:02] because we see for prophecy being

[29:06] prophecy a complain to see our world our
[29:09] country an austere mundo Nostra pious
[29:12] our way of living Denmark the vimana as
[29:15] we know it is rapidly changing
[29:17] rapid evidence that Camby end oh there
[29:19] are things that we cannot imagine or
[29:22] we've never been through many things i
[29:23] muchas cosas que no pony machina dos por
[29:26] que nunca hemos pasado as I was thinking
[29:27] about that III realize you know how many
[29:30] things have happened through the years
[29:32] to the ages amita's esto pensaba up
[29:35] instead total scores campus alone that
[29:37] is how can we possibly understand what
[29:39] it was like to go through the Great
[29:40] Depression
[29:41] como podemos
[29:43] case pasar por la grande press never
[29:44] been through a Great Depression por una
[29:47] we hear it and it doesn't have a lot of
[29:49] meaning to us now in most there are not
[29:51] any significant oh I remember working
[29:53] years ago for a certain family acuerdo I
[29:56] see tiempo y ou K no familia and the the
[30:00] the the son was was he was free a free

[30:20] meter scale of una vez con la ma dijo SK
[30:23] yo pasé por la grande de pasión
[30:24] policeman I know what it is not to have
[30:26] nothing to eat your steak is not
[30:29] anarchic and we possibly understand what
[30:31] it was like in for those living in the
[30:34] times of World War one
[30:35] Omo p.m. assent and there alguien que
[30:37] pasado por la primera verse over 16
[30:41] million people died during that war the
[30:44] velum told me one is the hint is ok can
[30:48] you imagine the war going on
[30:49] it ends in 1918 in my head like a rock
[30:52] about an El Nino and that the same year
[30:55] influenza gets going he'll miss mine
[30:57] you're welcome inside and here's another
[30:58] 50 million people not Auto cincuenta
[31:01] million is a him I don't know what it's
[31:03] like to live in a world like that
[31:04] Colonel Snickers even air with us
[31:06] morning I don't know what it's like to
[31:08] live in a world like that
[31:09] I don't you know say case we didn't room
[31:11] obviously comprehend the black death
[31:13] plague como vamos Anton de la la Muerta
[31:16] negative like over 50 million people in
[31:19] my Toma de cincuenta Muniz the hint that
[31:21] was about over 60% of the of Europe's
[31:25] entire population in that time here as
[31:28] the set up was the por ciento de la la
[31:30] gente de la ropa how can we understand
[31:33] what it was to those 68 million
[31:36] Christians that have lost their lives
[31:38] through the ages yes a cent I owe two
[31:41] million as the cristianos rk4 Oh Marty's
[31:43] house and I say that is that were
[31:44] martyred what Marty dasta's owes how
[31:47] they gave their lives so that we could
[31:48] have what we have today
[31:49] usiness will be there para que no so no
[31:52] one here is toy the song says it's
[31:54] dripping with blood
[31:56] or a sonnet country said this Holy Ghost
[31:58] and gospel is dripping with blood OS
[32:01] they were kill you around is Dustin
[32:02] Graham the blood of the saints who dies
[32:04] for the truth that's not smart it is
[32:07] this Holy Ghost gospel is dripping with
[32:09] blood
[32:10] Haley over del espíritu Santo we look at
[32:13] all those things and yet we understand
[32:15] they cannot even compare to what's
[32:16] coming
[32:17] it almost of course as I know second
[32:19] panel okay beginning the judgments that
[32:21] are here and those that are yet to come
[32:23] estan aqui y los que vienen but yet even
[32:26] through all of this is that although
[32:28] it's a Christian has such a great
[32:31] promise if Christianity nanogram promise
[32:33] that I have not seen nor ear has heard
[32:36] it often released on you know he neither
[32:39] has it entered into the heart of them
[32:41] that love him the book went rather
[32:44] critical Scalia the things that God has
[32:47] prepared for those that love him dearly
[32:50] put it but I lost my tequilas Kelly God
[32:52] wants us to be prudent in this time uski
[32:54] because their most prudent is that he
[32:56] wants him to be vigilant during this
[32:57] time is that mostly he lamented he wants
[33:00] us to be lighthouses that guess that was
[33:02] my finals and I want to tell you this he
[33:04] catalyst theory that right now is the
[33:07] greatest time in all of history to
[33:09] preach the gospel is this temple must
[33:11] remember but uh pretty kinda live on
[33:13] Katie Saudia people began to put their
[33:15] guards down now like hit the lamp beside
[33:17] like water the because of fear I come so
[33:20] that what do you think when somebody
[33:22] says what do you think it's a door open
[33:24] for you to preach philosophy won't that
[33:26] get business is to opportunity putting
[33:28] everything that we have heard don't look
[33:30] a Muslim everything that we have lived
[33:32] for but look at Mosby visa it is for
[33:35] this time right now Church this ferai
[33:37] state impose this is the time to lift
[33:39] your heads and know that our Redemption
[33:41] draws nigh
[33:42] I skip without sadness tears rose
[33:44] proceeds dimension is tell em I know
[33:46] what sayin wants is for us to focus
[33:48] totally on coronavirus okay so my skin
[33:51] is skin no self ok muslin is TV Rose
[33:53] Corona and it does that because he wants
[33:55] people to be in fear he lost a
[33:57] particular hint ain't anymore cuz when
[33:58] people are in fear or killa hinted
[34:01] tomorrow
[34:01] anyone can control them instead of
[34:03] controlling that right watch that that's
[34:05] what Satan wants hey Lucas at an ASCII
[34:08] people that are so obsessed with it
[34:10] think it's it says you're not every two
[34:13] minutes oh my gosh what's going on how
[34:15] many more got the system yes oh yes I'm
[34:17] gonna say this again yes we are aware of
[34:20] coronavirus those that we've got to be
[34:24] aware of what's around us that was at
[34:26] Percival's they look but we are not
[34:28] fearful of these things better look at
[34:30] Moses that's because we know who and
[34:32] whom we have believed in cinema screen
[34:35] that's where we stand today ie Islam
[34:37] then esperamos we must be aware of all
[34:40] that is going on around us same as a
[34:42] severe kid looking under there but we
[34:44] should also be aware if our anger is in
[34:46] Christ or not I'm insulated and notice
[34:48] that and Klan honest what is this
[34:50] coronavirus showing us he knows my
[34:52] stress Toledo's Khurana that our God
[34:54] Kenner Studios is the one and only true
[34:57] God

[35:44] Rodya
[35:45] God is showing something your system was
[35:47] try and if you pay attention to what's
[35:50] going on in the world is eponymous
[35:52] attencion and lo que pasa el mundo we
[35:54] often try to figure out how will these
[35:56] Muslims even leave the Temple Mount I
[35:58] say I said you'd been supposed to
[36:01] Muslims are selling this with templo and
[36:02] yet in a matter of a few weeks a month
