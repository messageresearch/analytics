[0:00] you know they see it
[0:02] that
[0:03] we're gonna go into dangerous territory
[0:06] tonight
[0:14] if i ever studied for a message
[0:20] what
[0:21] we're going to speak about tonight
[0:28] it's such a delicate subject
[0:31] did i have to confess
[0:35] i was afraid to
[0:37] preach honest for many years
[0:43] oh yeah i would i would
[0:45] highlight it a lot of times
[0:52] but i will never go deep into the grain
[0:55] of what we're going to
[0:58] talk about tonight
[1:07] yesterday
[1:10] you can see how delicate it is
[1:14] i started since i got up until five
[1:17] o'clock in the evening
[1:23] of course not straight i would take a
[1:25] little break because
[1:26] [Music]
[1:30] because it's very delicate
[1:34] and
[1:34] these
[1:35] messages
[1:38] is not just to you people that are
[1:40] sitting here
[1:44] it's not only to the people that don't
[1:46] come to bible studies
[1:48] they're on our online
[1:53] so studio not only
[1:55] for you and for them
[2:00] to go to africa
[2:04] africa
[2:05] norway to brother
[2:07] martin
[2:09] it goes to many places
[2:13] so i am responsible for what i teach in
[2:16] tons of responsibility
[2:18] because in that in that day i will
[2:20] answer to what i teach
[2:25] and i want to be sure
[2:27] when i get before you your brothers and
[2:30] sisters
[2:34] there is
[2:57] god bless you my faithful brother i know
[2:59] you're always there for me
[3:01] here
[3:08] he said if we ever need to get close to
[3:11] god it's right now
[3:16] you just see what's happening around the
[3:18] world
[3:22] and
[3:23] the
[3:25] everybody's worried about the russians
[3:31] well let's go into our lesson
[3:35] this will be
[3:37] chapter 6
[3:41] and uh open your bibles to hebrews 6.
[3:55] therefore leaving the principles of the
[3:57] doctrine of christ let us go on unto
[4:00] perfection
[4:01] not laying again the foundation of
[4:03] repentance from dead works in a faith
[4:06] toward god
[4:11] protection
[4:21] of the doctrine of baptisms and of
[4:23] laying on of hands and of the
[4:25] resurrection of the dead and
[4:36] and this will we do if god permitted
[4:47] we already know this from years back we
[4:50] know this
[4:54] this
[4:55] is only
[4:56] church reforms
[5:02] carnal reformation
[5:06] but it says leave those behind
[5:27] [Music]
[5:37] i am not perfect we ain't going to where
[5:39] we think we're going you see
[5:41] perfect
[5:44] and it says unto eternal judgment
[5:53] there cannot be reconciliation
[5:56] for
[5:57] for judgment
[6:04] that is why god had to take his own
[6:07] medicine
[6:10] medicine when he condemned man for
[6:14] sinning
[6:18] the only way he could reconcile
[6:23] was to take the place of man
[6:28] himself enemies and he became a sinner
[6:46] give
[7:02] yes
[7:04] and though i be scout of all my goods to
[7:09] feed the poor and though i give my body
[7:12] to be
[7:13] a burn and have
[7:42] it won't work
[7:56] we
[8:07] your father and mother were born
[8:09] condemned
[8:39] for you were judged by the sexual desire
[8:43] of your father and mother
[8:49] because of their act
[8:52] and
[8:59] [Music]
[9:19] we see that jesus by one sacrifice
[9:24] he perfected forever his church
[9:28] iglesia are you in the church of the
[9:31] firstborn estas
[9:44] so then we know that man never seeks god
[10:00] no man can come to jesus except god
[10:04] draws him first
[10:10] then god breathes the breath into your
[10:13] nostrils
[10:18] and god came in with a new nature
[10:24] the old carnal nature died
[10:29] so then let us go into perfection
[10:36] so you have everything in gonna have
[10:39] everything in order
[10:42] the churches that paul visited
[10:48] [Music]
[11:07] [Music]
[11:27] told farmers
[11:30] god is good yo bueno we talked to him
[11:35] even
[11:36] when he resurrected we already talked to
[11:38] him
[11:52] sid when you
[11:55] blessed are they that have not seen but
[11:58] yet they believe
[12:04] they will have their reward
[12:08] so it's talking about us right
[12:11] now
[12:12] we never knew brother brennan
[12:16] but we believe the message that he
[12:17] brought
[12:20] brother vernon said hey
[12:22] that's
[12:36] time
[12:39] he said that's the hardest healing that
[12:42] satan can give
[12:44] him
[12:47] so then paul is trying here
[12:50] to separate law from grace
[12:57] we have
[12:58] two pictures here
[13:02] one is
[13:06] [Music]
[13:18] it means to turn from a certain course
[13:21] or doctrine to the truth
[13:27] to show the jews
[13:30] that's quite this letter to the hebrews
[13:35] trying to show the pattern of the old
[13:38] testament type in the new testament
[13:45] leaving the principles
[14:00] i really want you to learn this
[14:05] i want you to give me your undivided
[14:07] attention
[14:12] that we had
[14:16] we find out how we are perfected
[14:23] absolutely spotless and blameless
[14:28] not
[14:56] because we are not noticed because we
[14:59] are in him
[15:08] let me go back
[15:13] we do we do we sin every day
[15:17] and we have to be
[15:19] perfect
[15:23] yet we are perfect
[15:27] perfect because we are in him
[15:31] and god could no more judge us
[15:36] god
[15:38] and he if god would judge us
[15:43] then he would not be righteous
[15:47] because he already judged us
[15:52] when he judged christ
[16:00] he judged me
[16:04] so then
[16:05] he if he judged
[16:08] [Music]
[16:19] [Music]
[16:22] or when he judged
[16:24] christ upon the husband christo he took
[16:29] my judgment ertomo miguel
[16:32] i've been redeemed
[16:36] the holy ghost has given us the ministry
[16:42] to warn the people of what's happening
[16:56] [Music]
[17:17] their solarize false christ and false
[17:20] prophets
[17:21] and shall show great signs and wonders
[17:24] and so much that if it were possible
[17:27] they shall deceive the very last
[17:43] behold i have told you
[18:10] he doesn't say
[18:13] christ singular
[18:16] notice christo singular jesus christ
[18:20] plural is a crystal plural
[18:23] they shall arise
[18:25] false
[18:37] and false prophets
[18:40] so if they
[19:01] [Music]
[19:22] they have a message
[19:32] it's the genuine holy ghost of god upon
[19:37] them but they still are false
[19:46] then you say
[19:48] brother long hey
[19:50] how can this
[19:52] be
[19:55] anointed
[19:56] false teachers
[19:58] maestros
[20:00] saint matthew
[20:02] chapter five verse 43 matteo
[20:11] you have heard that it has been said
[20:14] thou shall love thy neighbor and hate
[20:17] thine enemy
[20:24] but i say unto you love your enemies
[20:27] bless them that curse you do good to
[20:30] them that hate you and pray for them
[20:32] which despitefully use you and persecute
[20:36] you
[20:45] oh
[20:50] that you may be the children of your
[20:52] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[20:57] his son to rise
[20:59] on the evil and on the good and send its
[21:02] reign on the just and on the unjust
[21:09] chaos
[21:11] uh
[21:19] [Music]
[21:27] oh here we go into the very nitty gritty
[21:36] like i said commodity
[21:38] all these years
[21:42] i've mentioned a lot of these scriptures
[21:51] you know
[21:52] i
[21:53] was afraid
[21:54] to teach
[21:56] in on this
[22:11] a lot of these scriptures is not so easy
[22:14] to come and teach to you people um
[22:21] do you think it was easy for me and
[22:23] caleb to teach in the book of revelation
[22:26] to the people in uganda
[22:31] apocalypse
[22:33] uganda there's a few things that we
[22:36] still do not understand
[22:44] [Music]
[22:46] and we don't try to say something just
[22:48] so you can think that we are we know
[22:50] everything in october
[23:01] i mentioned these scriptures a few times
[23:21] says can you see the man of branham when
[23:23] you have need of it
[23:25] necessity that god will come on the
[23:28] scene
[23:30] i thank my savior

[26:05] and have tasted of the heavenly gift
[26:08] egos taran
[26:10] and were made partakers of the holy
[26:13] ghost
[26:16] and have tasted the good word of god and
[26:19] the power of the world to come
[26:26] if they shall fall away to renew them
[26:30] again unto repentance then they crucify
[26:34] themselves
[26:35] the son of god afraid and put him to an
[26:38] open chain
[26:47] exponential
[26:55] have tasted
[26:57] not of the gifts
[26:59] uh gift

[27:18] for those
[27:27] [Music]
[27:32] and tasted of the good word
[27:38] they never got it
[27:42] they were borderline believers
[27:46] from what happened to them
[27:51] because it was impossible
[27:54] and what happened
[27:57] they perish in the wilderness perez

[45:33] okay
[45:42] hebrews
[45:45] [Music]
[45:59] those 300 and some ministers in chicago
[46:04] in chicago they were going to come to be
[46:06] baptized in the name of jesus christ
[46:11] of christ
[46:26] they
[46:38] for those that were enlightened
[47:08] gospel business
[47:11] you said you were coming in
[47:15] you turned away from the message
[47:19] he says some individuals will come out
[47:23] as individuals
[47:25] and that's the sign of his coming
[47:30] churches
[47:32] who have seen and heard the truth
[47:50] and i indicted
[48:21] [Music]
[49:13] and the same thing
[49:39] [Music]
[49:43] capital losses
[49:47] verse one verso uno
[50:01] [Music]
[50:10] it is impossible for those who were once
[50:13] enlightened and have tasted as a
[50:15] heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[50:17] the holy ghost
[50:24] in participated
[50:26] and tasted of the good word of god and
[50:28] the power of the world to come
[50:35] in age of halloway to renew them again
[50:37] and to repentance seeing they crucified
[50:39] to themselves the son of god afresh and
[50:42] put him to an open shame
[50:53] the question is
[50:56] do you sing daily
[51:00] because
[51:02] yes or no see or no
[51:06] i thought it's gonna
[51:10] [Music]
[51:20] john
[51:22] 1 8
[51:24] juan
[51:26] uno
[51:28] if we say that we have
[51:30] no sin we deceive ourselves and the
[51:33] truth is not enough
[51:42] method
[51:57] sorry
[52:24] if we confess our sins he is faithful
[52:27] and just to forgive us
[52:28] our sins and to cleanse us from all
[52:30] unrighteousness
[52:34] verse 10 he says yes if we say that we
[52:37] have not sinned we make him a liar and
[52:41] his word is not enough
[53:02] first john
[53:04] chapter 3
[53:05] verse 6. remember juan capitulo
[53:09] says
[53:11] whosoever abandons in him
[53:14] whosoever sinneth had not seen him
[53:17] neither known him
[53:43] little children let no man deceive you
[53:45] he that was righteousness is righteous
[53:48] even as he is righteous
[53:57] either committed sinners of the devil or
[54:00] the devil's sinner from the beginning
[54:02] for this purpose the son of god was
[54:04] manifested that he might destroy the
[54:07] works of the devil
[54:20] whosoever is born of god does not commit
[54:23] sin
[54:24] or his seed remaineth in him
[54:27] and he cannot sin because he is born of
[54:31] god
[54:49] if you say you don't think that you make
[54:51] god a liar
[54:55] but he says here there is
[55:25] [Music]
[55:45] does not commit sin
[56:03] [Music]
[56:29] is still in you when you were born
[56:35] because you are of the world
[56:39] that is the reason you cannot have
[56:41] reformation
[56:53] and you cannot have birth without
[56:56] crucifixion
[57:09] in order to be resurrected in christ
[57:20] how can you make a man a sinner come up
[57:25] when the bleach of the blood of jesus
[57:28] christ
[57:31] is between him and god
[57:34] that would scatter sin all
[57:38] to be nothing
[58:06] on the wall in brenham
[58:11] what was happening
[58:18] he said let me see if i can take this
[58:20] out
[58:44] he said let me take this crucifix
[58:47] off the wall
[59:02] how do
[59:37] [Music]
[59:44] and free from the judgments illegally
[59:47] they'll wish you so then how can we sing
[59:50] enthusiastically
[59:52] you cannot sing
[59:54] because there is a blood sacrifice i
[59:57] sacrificed you the same
[1:00:20] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:00:23] to them which are in christ jesus who
[1:00:26] walk
[1:00:27] [Music]
[1:01:21] take
[1:01:25] gracie gracie which is the first color
[1:01:28] in the rainbow
[1:01:30] color
[1:01:32] thank you
[1:01:33] is correct
[1:01:37] [Laughter]
[1:02:18] and you know that's what we got we had
[1:02:21] to get a blood transfusion
[1:02:26] am i it purified
[1:02:28] our blood purification
[1:02:31] and eternal
[1:02:39] [Music]
[1:02:46] and god cannot see nothing but the blood
[1:02:49] of his own son
[1:02:54] because jesus is making intercessions
[1:02:57] constantly
[1:03:29] notice as we
[1:03:31] are getting ready to finish speaking
[1:03:33] segments
[1:03:38] but by the way as we read here
