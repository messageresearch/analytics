1 26 i'll pick it up wednesday when god made man before he made man he called himself l e l l e l h l l elohim the word means in the hebrew the self-existence all by himself nothing existed before him he was all the existence he ever was self-existence was mighty self-existence but in genesis 2 when he made man he said i am y a h u j u b u h yahuwah jehovah what did it mean i am the all existence one who has created something all for myself to be a son of mine are a temporary are an amateur little one of mine why he gave man jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur god because he is father god and he made a man an amateur god so he isn't self existence anymore he exists with his family [Music] now now he is jehovah jehovah meaning the one who exists with his family now god made man to be the predominant over all the earth he had dominion and the earth was man's dominion is that scripture then if that's his domain he was god over the earth he could speak and it would be so he could speak this and he would be so there he is god jehovah the one who once existed in self-existence but now exists with his family and his little ones with him amen there you are hallelujah all right brother neville you got first peter 120 but read 119 and 120. but with the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who verily was foreign before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you when was he for ordained before the foundation of the world brother pat read revelation 17 8 for me this the thou son was [Music] they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation who's going to be deceived who's going to be received by this religious person like saul was that was just so cunning and so perfect to it would deceive the white very e if if possible all right revelations 13 8 let me read it for you and all that dwell upon the earth shall all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names were not written in the book of life of the lamb's slaying before the foundation of the world when was our names put in the lamb's book of life when the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world when god was jehovah el ely elohim the self-existence one just like one great big diamond and he could not be nothing else but inside of this diamond his attributes was a savior amen in this attributes on the inside of him was a healer well there was nothing to save and nothing to heal but his attributes produced it election looks back to foreknowledge and predestination looks the destiny don't forget that that election looks back here here it is but all of a sudden i become a wheat grain how did it happen uh that what is that election god before the foundation of the world elected that the cocker bird was to become a reign of wheat now i know i'm a grain of wheat because i'm saved how do i do it now let's read just a little farther and then we'll have to close pretty sharp according as he chose us and him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy without blame before him in love having [Music] predestinated us unto the adoption predestinated unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will what did he do he by ford knowledge foresaw us knowing that he was a savior self-existence but in him was a savior amen well what's he going to say there's nothing lost knowing that that he know that this great attribute in him would project something out on her that he could save then when he did that by four knowledge he looked down he saw everyone that would accept it and while he did that he did that that he might save you who wants to be saved do you see what i mean by for knowledge amen the infinite god who wrote all things saw the lamb and he slayed the land before the foundation of the world and he put your name on the lamb's book of life and he's seen the deceitfulness of satan what he would do so he put your name on there by election he chose them and by predestination they know where they are go in amen now who could doubt that that's what paul said that's paul's scripture that's paul's writing that's what he taught his church the church positioned before the foundation of the world when god and his labor pain was bringing forth bringing forth you knowing what you would do he positionally placed you into his own body amen to be a housewife to be a farmer to be a preacher to be a prophet to beat this or to be that and then on next sunday morning we're going into the physician league placing the church positionally placing the church where they belong each one how we're called by the adoption god has adopted us unto the sons we're sons by birth adopted and positionally placed by the holy spirit [Applause] good evening everybody what a what a time we had this morning and uh grateful to be again here in the house of the lord and uh we could we could we could just about just after that just go home but we got a job to do tonight and we're grateful to the lord for what he's done for us this is that we are going into tonight the whole series is called the adoption the series and this is uh part two of the adoption the adoption if you would ever look it up in the old books it would be the manifestation of the sons of god manifestation but in the new in the new books is they just call it the adoption part 2. we're grateful to to the lord that he has given us what he in the book of joshua the first chapter of josue [Music] we will be and i i just want to go really quick into that as the first part was the ephesians parallels joshua josue let's take the book of joshua after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of nun moses is minister saying moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this jordan thou and all this people unto the land which i do give them even to the children of israel our your foot shall tread upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses and he says preaching usually catches the sinner brings him under condemnation by the word but teaching places the man positionally what he is and we can never rightly be able to have faith no podemos correctamente nerfe until [Music] in the dispensation of the adoption of children and you that are writing this down the word dispensation is a period of time in history in which a particular divine revelation has predominated in the affairs of mankind so then right away we we will go into into just that opening that openly opening uh declaration so there is then no outpouring of the holy ghost since we live in a different dispensation because it's very important to understand when we're saved and this bible study this this panel is not is not so much to discuss even though it goes all together yes it's not too it's we're not speaking about being saved or being filled with the holy ghost or being a son of god what we're doing what we're dealing with tonight to be positionally placed in the body of jesus christ so then we are living in the dispensation notice that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and that's what you're on earth even in him and each one of these dispensations that my brother just mentioned hermano the mosaic [Music] the dispensation of grace in crystal but in the dispensation of adoption in the dispensation he is taking all of that that was was poured throughout all those times so but in order to get the value of what we're doing in the dispensation of adoption now in the dispensation as it all comes together junto it's the spirit of god being poured into one vessel persimismo thank you brother jim brother jerry you have something to tell me gary amen amen god bless you jesus yeah this is kind of new to me because and i didn't get very far until something caught my attention and if i i'll read a scripture and it's in ephesians one when you have it you can say amen it says paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus and christo jesus and and that caught me right there faithful in christ jesus christ and christo jesus because if you look at the word in right there the way it's used it means position significa but also when you go in there you're also in your position so that that caught my my attention there because it says faithful in christ jesus jesus and who is he speaking to there lando do you find yourself there because he's not speaking to the outside world right there he's speaking to the church if you're in christ jesus christ jesus then you're part of the church then you're in your position but then it also goes in if you read verse two in verse it says grace be unto grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ and he said bless bless be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christian so so the question maybe some of you might have is how do we get in christ well if you read it in second corinthians 12 second first corinthians 12 and verse 13 for by two spirits now for by my spirit for me no it says for by one spirit of the spirit again how many spirits church are some of us baptized by one spirit are we all how many how many belong to the all right it didn't it didn't exclude anybody it says all. says it could be methodist presbyterians it means all by one spirit or gentiles whether we be bond or free escalators and have all and have been all made to drink into one spirit so how are we how do we get into christ we are baptized by one spirit so again here as it says blessings in heavenly places again it means position significant position yes what is that position who does that position pertain to esta position i believe if it's i believe it would be me positioned by the holy ghost the position of the believer of the believer so so as we look at here but but but once we're in christ and cristo it's not a revolving door no una puerto i believe you can't you can't decide one day you're in christ and the next day you're going to be out if you're going to be in christ you got to be in fully you got to give your whole heart to christ we we we can't walk with with with one foot in one foot out nope we got to be we got to be right now because what does the scripture so if you're going to be in christ then you got to be all in christ but you got to be all-in you can't decide one day i'm going to be in christ so one day i'm going to be out nope because once you're in christ and you found your position in control in heavenly places then all the promises pertaining to you and i le partners like the things that you you you can have your healing every single promise is yours your children are yours every blessing is yours but you gotta find your position in christ not in a church no no no iglesia because because when we get baptized cedar hills church of the cross doesn't baptize you cedar hills uh church of the cross not about yes you get baptized by the church in by a minister it is but you're baptized by one spirit by one holy spirit and that places you positionally yes brother says paul an apostle by the will of god pablo apostles says not his will to the saints which have been faithful hello and what are they faithful in question brother branham says they're faithful in the word [Music] blessed us in heavenly places what is heavenly places question here it is brother jimmy it is a believer's position in christ and when you have climbed that ladder it'll quicken your mortal body you won't say the things you used to say amen we always say this in a ministerial meeting back to what brother brother jerry just got through saying okay you cannot teach faithful how to be faithful and teach faithful faithfulness is something that is a quality that that that that is not thought of and can you be faithful yes you can be a faithful to a certain cause but when you're faithful to god there are some there's a reason why you're faithful when they sing the plan of salvation that's what keeps you in faithful that's what keeps you coming back to church putting your name on the book when he thought of christ dying for you when pence he counted your name with his contoso he associated your name with his associates he didn't write it in his book because we no no our name was written in the book before it was written he spoke our name somebody got to tell your neighbor god spoke my name tell your neighbor oh somebody tell you tell your neighbor shout it to them that's what we did in the beginning when the sons of god shouted for joy you see the plan of salvation you see him wrote your name on the book okay brother calm me down god bless you brothers said it's also my my first time not my style but i like to be running something i'd like to add [Music] the sin of the world whether you want to live there that's a different story or something i i meditate a lot and i was asking myself god said let us make man to our image [Music] according to our likeness where does it say whether god did it for that he was ready already ready to understand a little bit better i read the message and the prophet of god says here is the true manager oh so seeing the whole process the prophet of god says god knowing that you would be a drunk this morning we heard about wisdom knowledge but here the word says or knowledge [Music] no one will interfere there the holy spirit is the promise it is the promised land when you enter there into that promised land the prophet says the first thing the holy spirit does he places the church in order he says he corrects her so the first thing that we need entering it is to be corrected they don't like me but if you read the message the prophet of god teaches us that love is correct uh how many of you read that you know one of the things the prophet says the first thing that god does he places an apostle foreign when we see him when we appoint one person and we don't appoint him according to the scripture that's where we're gonna miss it the scripture says he himself has hath placed he wasn't placed by any other person but he himself to enter into the promised land you need to be corrected established we'll go to a scripture dclc of god they have heard the father how many have heard of the father juan when he's the aunties before the foundation of the world and romans chapter 1 verse 21 is they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations the scripture tells us everything came out of him whether the good and the bad okay but one the the bad part belonged to him the reason they can take possession of that land because it belongs to them yes god bless you brother [Music] not sure how it says it in english we know it was wisdom and knowledge in spanish at least you shall be like god good and evil because they knew good luck [Music] amen amen for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation jesus conversations receive by tradition from your father but with the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot como un corderos in mancha who verily was for ordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times where are you manifest right all right brother jerry right brother jerry god bless you tonight god bless you um so this um the subject of adoption tremendous i know my brother jimmy likes it now because it is uh it's showing us who we are where we are you know positionally placing of sons positions [Music] it speaks on [Music] having pre-destinated us in the adoption of children by jesus christ according to the good pleasure of his will but look at verse 6 and lots of paraphrase so i don't read so much the next one it says to praise to the praise of the glory of his grace [Music] wherein he has made us accepted so i see the way brother branham the way he explains adoption here in part two [Music] we know what the scripture says obviously an adoption of sons but the way he uses it like we've been hearing is positionally placing of the believer [Music] so right away i went like i said i like to define words to help me understand it better so so look at some of the definitions okay [Music] [Music] or to use something the third one says to accept formally and put into effect [Music] this is it's a change in a result of an action essentially this is to take up and practice or use essentials to take or accept formally and put into effect and then i also saw some of the synonyms and what that means is words that are very similar to the to the word being defined and just to name some of them it's an endorsement and this is another message it's a promotion it's a validation it's choosing and a choice it's election it's a selection it's a nomination and it's an acceptance yes so in ephesians 1 6 we saw about being accepted so we read we heard in part one where it says ephesians parallels joshua just a little bit of like i said just so i can get my point across here so we know that he parallels that because he joshua plays he divided the land [Music] i began to look at ephesians now empire he gave some apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors so we see that this is a formula like we heard this morning the formula of creation so the only way the perfection can come from to the saints perfection and the edification of the spirit the way it comes and brings it positionally placed together brother jimmy the infilling because we know it's the holy ghost it's god in all things remember [Music] because it is because god has your the only hands you could use is your hand is your hands in my hands so without that or seen they said there's there's no the adoption cannot come and i'll explain more so how do we know that we're sons and daughters of god how do we become and bring this manifestation out come on there's no way we can do any type of justice in 10 minutes and no doubt what great theologians have struck that knows who he is has adopted this process that has adopted the formula so in other words has adopted what we heard this morning that we adopted and does this process here here's the formula formula he can bear with the man when he's wrong he lost suffers again let's start over and an attribute is not separate from the person so he's faithful he's filled with the spirit he's never negative negative the process [Applause] the fruit of the tree is it seen on the inside of the tree or the outside of the tree enlighten me okay so so we're sons of god jose dios he's already seen all this video where the sons of god were to be manifested outside of this time they couldn't be manifested any other time outside of this time is that true yeah why until those that would deliver all nature this time you couldn't have delivered on everything and the other time and then he says this statement i'm quoting i'm quoting the old adoption book yeah it's pretty messed up [Applause] he says the ministry of these plural man singular el ministerio de estos plural hombre singular so close like his tan circus como el singular singular that it will unite him and the church together plural um [Applause] the ministry of these man and a and singular in the version they just changed because they can see in the context there has to be a plurality context is that the ministry must be like one man a ministerio tiene [Applause] even unto the great river al grand rio the river euphrates all the land of the hittites and to the great sea to toward the going down of the sun shall be your host there shall not be any man able to stand before thee all the days of your life as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not fail thee i will not forsake thee be strong and of good courage yes foreign you might just be the that's what the adoption of god and children come to give us jesus christ never gave us our inheritance to receive the inheritance of god just before the foundation of the world what we don't understand at times have a i don't wouldn't know what it is to fly an airplane that's brother henry brother henry could tell you hey henry i would be a fool to tell a doctor or a pilot what to do where he tells you your position and the adoption of child of son in that own adoption but this is where christianity failed because we think that adoption is the baptism of the holy ghost it is a public ceremony it is is you are the most privileged people on the face of the world don't ever give up your crown don't ever give up where you're at because adoption is not an old testament word this is the new covenant this is the new testament in my blood and me the adoption of children in my mind when god said this was my son yesterday it's simple it's simple he's saying you know what he said 7k my boy is so much like me me me muchachos i have no doubt no tengo ningunaduda that not even one word that comes out of his mouth will be from another god brother jimmy you're telling me that the sun's signature was as good as the father absolutely yes jimmy so you're telling me it's amazing no that the son's signature was as good as the father's signature absolutely [Music] watch this adoption part two paragraph 132. oh papa got sitting back there in the beginning [Music] before the foundation of the world so they want to beat us all up kill us we have to resurrect 20 times playing with him before the foundation jesus god all right well you this is not to conclude because you can't conclude it would be it would be forever to try to do justice but we have a question from the audience and it says this when brother branham refers to joseph dismissing his bride and his children is and the the the the simple answer even though it's it's a profound response it's found in paragraph 74. i'm sorry 70 72 [Music] and joseph brings in ifrian and manassa entrance joseph brings him to his father jose and the custom is to give the blessing to the elder la costumbres which so he goes to bless them here's my here's manasseh [Applause] you'll find out he's one of the tribes later that isn't in the book of revelation when joseph dismisses his pride jose the and now he's going to reveal himself to his jewish brothers crosses back over from gentiles ahudio wow you've been a wonderful audience once again and we don't want to take more time but we could take ten more hours and we still would not we're not going to do it so we're thankful to to our pastor for this privilege that he has given us and the next the next time that it's our our turn again we'll have another three
