okay me too foreign amen all right now that we all giggled and and you know this is the fifth time i've uh been blessed to go yes so it was really um it was really a pleasure and honor to be able to see all the the young men that have gone for the first time and i sure did enjoy it to see the lord jesus christ work in them and you begin to see an establishment within the body in each one of them and and for for for any of us that have the holy spirit we have we have one desire and that's to serve the lord jesus christ all we want to do is stay in his perfect will and our main but the most precious thing to him on this earth so when you see the body start to get established in yourself in others and you you start to see another half of you coming together i just very very proud of just to be part and to be side by side with each and every one of the men that went on you know brother going with brother jimmy the endocrine jaime he uh he just never ceases to amaze me i mean this guy deserves a hand of a cause honestly este he said he said he's never been uh spoiled before like he was this truth and it's because the spirit of jesus christ is in him and so as that maturity starts to grow it just starts to pour out so it was just a pleasure with our brothers in colorado you think it's over and they come in and just start just letting off rounds out of their their mouths okay yeah yeah so if we can stand and you know and if we can turn to the second book of timothy chapter two capital dose go for it thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus jesus and the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men we shall be able to teach others also edonias thou therefore endure hard hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ no man that worth entangled tingleth himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who have chosen him to be a soldier you know that um i read that scripture up there in in africa in africa that scripture has always stood out to me recently the lord's been working with me on that scripture and if i can i want to read it in the new kings james version just so maybe some of our young or some of a soldier can grasp it a little bit but i can just do something to try to break it up in phrases and i'll just okay i don't have to read it you then my son be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus jesus and the things you have heard of me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified against no one serving as a soldier gets entangled in civilian affairs but rather tries to please his commanding officer we heard we heard brother tommy this morning say that we are blessed and i know we hear that time and time again and i know we say yes we are you simply give us almost and i believe that most of the time we believe it is if this was let's say i hadn't had a bottle of water or i had to drink water all week long this is my first bottle yes well after that it's gone and probably by the end of the night i'll forget that hunger or desire that i had for that water especially i know i can go pick it up and drink it any time but if i could if if that can be a type of what i'm trying to say siesta i made this statement up there i have been five-fold trained every one of you also has yes and for me but i mean you can see paul instructing his his men telling him to at first when i read this i thought uh he's just telling timothy to be but the reason why he's telling timothy this is because he's starting to feel a little bit of pressure there is and going up there i was able to see i was able to see the pieces of the body it wasn't just cedar hills and and we know that because our pastor never says it's just us they both taught us to be servants uh and to be a servant to the lord jesus christ we have to be servants to his children so you you start to put yourself aside instead commence your opponents and you start to just focus on his children and i could see i could see the man up there basically the same thing i think i've said that before it's the same thing that goes on up there that goes down over here maybe in a different level as far as poverty corruption of the world the word but as i i was able to see it um it really started to hit me because you start to hurt for people's souls you and brother branham even faced the same things while he was going you got to say what you got to say what we're going to tell you or we're going to cut you off you can't be part of it [Music] sometimes i don't get it because maybe it's not just that reason but maybe i wouldn't be here i wouldn't be coming to church if it wasn't just to praise the lord jesus christ i mean if we're not coming to serve the lord and to praise him to me it's to me it's just a waste of time but we know that we come over here to serve to listen to fill ourselves to praise him and we know that it shouldn't stop when we leave these four walls and there was a within saying all that there was this young man that would always be around us but since money came into the picture with him and his family he he couldn't be with us and i was able to see just the hurt inside of him i was able to see all the the lies and the deceiving tongues that have been put inside his ears it just wasn't my same little buddy no more yeah and it really hurts strange it was strange to see but then i i caught myself and i said well don't you you see the same thing over here too so what i'm going to end with saying is the missionary doesn't stop or start and stop once you leave the country i don't man these people that the grandest of us i have a pastor that i know that we may for me when when correction comes all the time i'm not like oh yeah okay no i'm not you know you'll see sometimes i might be kicking and screaming like a little baby before i know what he has inside of him and i know what that office is to me so remember this when you're out there one thing he taught me our pastor our desire his desire is always to be so much like jesus christ so we should be we should be building our temple up because we're a living temple of the living god and we should shoot for every day that he may be pleased to dwell in us to use this temple to speak out of our mouths to listen from our ears and to get our brothers and sisters to where they need to be amen amen [Applause] they say that in africa there are lions but let me tell you one thing we have some tremendous here behind the pope because these men over there there is it's not the same for somebody to tell you alaska let's go to vacations to alaska onto a cruise it's not the same thing in a picture to be over there there on the ship with your wife with your family or somebody said that we're going to hawaii all beautiful photos but you've never been there i was afraid to go to africa with them because i didn't i don't speak english and they help me in all things i came and i met brother julius and he was my my roommate dialogue god bless you brother if tommy junior was there navier nobody was there solo and me by myself and and me and my english and and he and me english hello my brother hola god bless you and i wanted to tell him much more but i couldn't and then what did in spanish he doesn't speak spanish he would say god bless you every time we would find each other you know brother he's fiery god bless you amigo mio my friend yes and that was our language between us we would see each other in the restaurant is here and he would tell me dear serendiga god bless you amigo my friend and he would hug me oh brother we did not need to speak a language and that's the way we passed our time all the time we were there i have a scripture so that we would read it in the book of acts chapter 4 and verse 20 it says but we cannot for we cannot but speak [Music] after they had raised up a lame man in la puerta in the gate called beautiful pedro but you know that peter pania was coming from denying jesus remember we have a lot of errors i would say and he forgives us and he gave the confidence to peter peron but he had to go as well the leader went away so that peter would understand but nosotros that's why us we give thanks to god because we have a leader i always say [Applause] that's why always be on your leader's side el hermano thomas brother tom como de si del mano tomasito esta manana as brother tommy jr would say this morning he would tell them don't forget africa don't forget africa there was a transference orlando in terminus speaking on in the terminology of a bank when you do a transfer it has to be received at times it's not received or there is a bad receptor we have they have received it and they are putting it to work i saw it in africa i started it i see it here that's why i want you segan will continue on on the on the side of your leader very quickly hallelujah hallelujah there was our baggage this was marvelous for me you know what is in that luggage i prayed for that because we took food in that baggage quest what did we take we we took bookmarks la pisceros we took we took pens espresso we took the sanitizer we [Applause] [Applause] and and i asked myself can i go on to be perfect can i get to the place to be perfect he will do the work in me and that's why este trabajo this work continue but we're gonna we're gonna go with some more pictures iglesia look at the church entire there on the ground kneeling down on the ground if they would get dirty nada it didn't matter to them it did not matter the color of their shop or because of their trousers they only wanted to hallelujah hallelujah can you help me hallelujah hallelujah and everyone would say hey man feliz i would communicate with you especially after so much to be able to tell you about uganda let's go to the next picture much to speak upon another one that was the material those that carried the bags because they got their fines i opened up the baggage everything was packaged the seven churches and they would jump and they would shout hallelujah hallelujah and they would dance and sing everyone singing in chorus if we could understand what we said they would dance would dance with them if you want something good uganda go to uganda dear live india god bless you man god bless you i do you love indigo that's your brother amen if you may stand for the reading of the scripture we'll be reading in second kings chapter eight seconds amen and it says and it came to pass as he was telling the king that he had restored a dead body to life that behold the woman whose son he had restored to life cried to the king for the for her house and for her land and gehazi said my lord o king this is the woman that is her son whom elijah restored to life and when the king asked the woman she told him so the king appointed unto her a certain officer saying restore all that was hers and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land even until now or not and now matthew chapter 13. verse 45 and 46. again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls who when he had found one pearl of great price went and saw all that he had and bought it buenos like to thank our pastor for the opportunity and for the opportunity to be able to to go on this trip with all these great men and before before we left our pastor he he gave me this discern word a certain phrase which by now you have heard for this cause have i come into the world now you hear certain things and you you may say well you know that sounds good yeah [Music] oh it sounds so good but it's not until you you get the revelation of it it takes someone to receive that word and to catch the revelation of it so that it can change your life it's life changing it can be right about a a year and four months ago i arrived here in las cruces i said in las cruces and and i would have never imagined myself here perhaps two or three years ago much less to to go on a trip like this for this cause i [Applause] it'll be it's a different kind of food it's not the food of denominations it's not the food or nothing else no it's the food of the world and christ is the word so when you start to change and then we go home oh [Music] so when you see something like that you see all these seasoned ministers or pastors [Music] and you begin to ask yourself you begin to to take inventory but the lord has restored all things right all the things that that you need that the lord needs from you they're already inside of you they just need to be stirred you need to stir the gifts i don't believe isaiah felt very worthy a man of unclean lips but yeah he said lord here am i send me on me i hope it's something i i can relate to our youth today right we we i i came from georgia georgia and i found a pearl of great price you come here and and the word doesn't come back there's a substance here are you not substantial and a lot of times we can take it for granted but i i hope that you can say that you've sold everything so that you can buy this pearl of great price also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified me and it is the reason why we've come into this world and every day there was a brother there and he would say he'd say thank you for loving us each day he would say the same thing thank you for loving it gracias it is a pearl of great price they were able to to come into these meetings and they were able to hear from these great ministers and i believe it's done the same for all of you right it was such a tremendous trip it changes the way you the way you look at life we take all these things for granted and you think you have you think you have problems you say but you go over there and you step up but if you take something from from what i speak today someone from the outside looking in post i can tell you first hand this is the best there is so god bless [Applause] you all want to know the story of who are you brother william and william i i was very impressed by brother william william not only the way he spoke in uganda tell them william i i saw i saw my grandpa preaching my grandpa preaching through brother williams i had no words to try to get him an amen to encourage him or nothing all of a sudden brother alex comes through alex and he says who are you bro nobody can believe brother william was just like oh my gosh who is this guy and that's how i felt towards every person that went on this trip i watched brother noah's speak via manonova and i and i would hear him say that time and time again i would hear our pastor say the same thing i'd hear brother benji brother benji would get a little bit more forceful with me what is your problem bro let's go and uh and and you know what you can hear all day long the greatness of god to build up a thing in your on the trip that you know we are made up of many members not just one of us could do it by ourselves it pushes you to limits that you didn't think you could go i i as i went on this trip i i used to be upset at every missionary trip to africa i had a dream and in this dream i saw all these african people and i could see like a far away off i could see our pastor brother caleb i could see and i turned and i million dollars it was not dollar-wise i want you to give me all that you are okay give it all to africa you can hear daddy and mama do all these great things for the lord year after year and you know i'm gonna tell you something you will die in your pew vara that you'll never be as great as them you have no business giving god all your heart and let me tell you something don't make mistake after mistake after mistake you start losing your desire to want to do the will of the lord that's where i found god in africa and i'm going to read this in a different version but it says this verse 5 it says for i the lord your god am a jealous god punishing the children of the sin of their parents to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me quebecois but but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments we always like to think that it's just the iniquity that visits us because one thing that we know in this church is that our parents and our grandparents they serve the lord no matter what grandchildren you got to get your mind right and say this that's the love of god and this tender mercies jesus because of what my grandparents had loved that's the same love and i couldn't stop crying you see levels of poverty that that shouldn't exist you see them have nothing you came to church because you wanted to us mama and daddy grabbed you and yanked you into church when's the last time ultimate came with an expectancy in your heart nowadays you have to force people in the door hey bro what'd you get drawn for it what do you want to eat afterwards no no no no that's not what they're talking about they were already singing praises to the lord they were already i never been so excited to go to church in my life like that they don't look at you the way you're looking at me right now no no no no no no what's going on and i thought they get crazy when they're worship like they get like charismatic with their worship they don't no but i'm sorry but they don't know no there's a sincerity to their worship and that was the moment i waited for my whole life i never wanted to preach in any country of the world but i wanted to preach in uganda in uganda and let me tell you becoming the civilized it was hard as i began to minister i saw the very thing that held me back my life and i saw him standing in the middle of the aisle and it was a demon it wasn't none of the brothers from africa it was the demons in africa and i went to him and i told him today i used to be a little boy and i used to be afraid you know the devil comes when you see what these brothers sacrificed just to be in church you know i don't feel too good today maybe i'll go maybe i won't it's not boring it's not their expectations as they waited all week long to go to church and when you see them and their hunger but i'll tell you this as i get ready to close i got a few few minutes here i i had never never been so happy to be there be a part because brother mark's background is he's a fighter i as i got sick over there i didn't need uncle caleb to tell me quit being a baby and go up there no no no no no i had brother mark to tell me the question brother mark just looked me in the eye he said you know it's just the devil trying to hold you back so just go up there and knock him out so i looked at brother mark yo mark i said okay bro i got this ho bueno you think weston he goes yeah because you have the most important part get up there yes sir let's go you know i appreciate those things because you learn how to rely on your brother as we were there as as i've talked a lot of times i i've grown up with complexes of of of a great man named tomas perez because i've always wanted to be like i've always wanted to be like my father and here in the united states people don't understand generations anymore i'll never forget this for the rest of my life he told me thank you and i said brother no no thank you for being here he said no i began young people yes you ever want to see something good in your life take the tools that god has given you and put them to work you can sit in church by leaving all that you knew why not step out of your comfort zone why not leave your family behind okay and tell somebody and you'll thank you thank you for never losing the vision i i you know sometimes i i look at him and and sometimes i i i i hold back with him we have a true leader here we are a great leader god bless you [Applause] the bible tells us in acts chapter 19 and it says and god wrought special miracles by the hands of paul so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them acts chapter 19. and we just want to to brother abraham gave us this handkerchief on behalf of one of his friends the the amigo and and so we want to pray for this i'm going to ask if all the ministry would come and we're going to believe god and take him at his word jesus foreign have the father we thank you so much for your mercy and grace thank you for the power father that you died for us and your resurrection resurrected and father we thank you for for your
