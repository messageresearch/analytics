the musicians the song leader I'll bless each one of you because we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen we also want to greet our church back in Las Cruces that are online with us in Las Cruces and all the brothers that are online from different places God bless you guys we are very grateful to brother misael one of our friends Amigos we have been able to be all different places and be together soon the gospel together we are happy to have a friend like him in and his wife and family esposa Familia amen man that's the ministry that's here from the different places how many have had a good time you see your hands if you had a good time amen we've had a wonderful time I think we could just read a scripture and go home and be happy but let's see what the Lord has for us this morning forgive me I've been a little bit under the weather I don't know if my voice will hold up [Music] man but you pray for me but this morning is Sunday school it's a different it's a different anointing the different spirit is the same Holy Spirit but we want to just then just calm down a little bit and see what the Lord wants to tell us so is that okay we study a little bit this morning how many are here want to learn amen and so we we put a title to the message restoring the family restaurant La Familia I say it again restoring the family restaurant La Familia I believe that that is so important today as we see the theme of the services it is the unity of the one God in the one Church how many gods cuantos dioses not very sure how many gods cuantos dioses and how many churches why are there so many churches how many gods cuantos dioses how many churches Iglesias okay then let's see what the Lord has for us Genesis 1 1. he's going to help us read and it says you know that by heart in the beginning God created the heavens Earth sientos man and so we find out here that in the beginning God the word God here is Elohim tell your neighbor this is this is ABCs all right this is easy in the beginning who created the heavens and the Earth was Elohim Elohim a man amen now we want to set a stage here because we want to see really it's almost bad how these things unfolded I want to start with reading the from the message the adoption number one element before he made man he called himself l Ella Elohim the word means in Hebrew la palabra significa the self-existence all by himself completamente solo how many of you like to be all by yourself I think you're here in church because you you don't like to be by yourself too much once in a while it's okay to be by yourself right yeah yeah we were not created to Veronica solos because God in the beginning he was by himself well he he wanted something more than what was there but okay and he began to think about foreign says he was all by himself he was the what's this he was the all-sufficiente one that existed of himself but in Genesis 2 he says he said Hennessy's dos when he made man he said I am Yahweh Jehovah I like that because that's including me and you now what did mean yes significo what does Jehovah mean this this is simple Yes simply well it means significa says I'm the all-existent one who has created something off of myself to be a son of mine but I said or a temporary or temporal or an amateur little one of Mineo Jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur God because he is Father God yes and he made a man an amateur God so he isn't self-existence anymore the moment that he created man he would never again be self-existent once again the moment he created man he was never lonely or by himself now he has a family family how many here have a family Familia amen now notice this this is what we want to we want to establish here in Genesis chapter one and and you can look in your Bibles and we're going to go really fast here and we spoke a little bit about this in in Colombia foreign but notice how the scriptures read Ura verse one oh that's it God yours Elohim ah okay number three oh ah okay number four yenville ah and number five ah verse 8. ah verse 9. ah okay amen turning to chapter two we find out that verse three the EOS something will change something's about to change and that is verse in English this is right it is okay para you want to stop here it's time to read the Bible I read for today I read the Bible today yeah I'm good yes that was just just for our conscience but to stop and notice that as we heard last night just one word una palabra what yeah okay so now we want you to take note to this and that is in verse something changed that it was no longer just God but now it is Lord God is it has changed now in the days go ahead and finish reading it who created so now now hello him Elohim that existed of himself but now he and now now is the Familia because you and you and you and you and you are familiar come on shake hands you are part of the family of God it is you know your name neighbor does you know you it is are part of the family of God Amen simply okay very simple now from here on to the rest of the chapter you don't see just God anymore everything is Lord God let's read a few of them or on verse seven I'm sorry who formed on that Lord God eight yeah he is not alone amen verse 15. is verse 21 you know three here Peyton has entered the serpenters and now the serpenter is coming to part of what God has created he could not get to the man so he goes through the woman now he's gonna say something that I want you to catch because he he twists it and that's what he always does with the words he always takes something out of it now understand this because satanas does not have a problem saying he's Elohim not in a problem he will say he's God he's all powerful but Satan is after something he's after worship and he's after he wants to destroy the family the church should be a family what is he trying to do he's trying to destroy the churches he's trying to destroy the homes trying to destroy the individuals so the first thing he does comes to the woman and he will not say yoga I'm gonna say it again will not say Jehovah he'll say God but not Jehovah because he does not want God to be one with his family so the first thing he says now go ahead and read it mice better here what did the serpent say oh no no they said also the Lord God has said when he says he doesn't want to pronounce so he says listen oh God hath said oh that was the platform let's see where we go now Peyton's goal as I said to destroy the family do not permit the unity to come now now many of us uh muchos that are message Believers all that are here if you go to the book of Ephesians you're gonna find out that that that that he placed in the church and Prophets evangelists for the perfecting of the Saints the work of the ministry of the body of Christ but it goes on to say until release that's what we need to come to uh the problem is is that we know that scripture very well but we do not read three of the same chapter and you put it up there Ephesians 4 3 if uh press what does it say brother Julian Ephesians 4 3. solicitors the unity of the spirit you cannot have the unity of the faith until first of all you have Ephesians 4 3. thank God you've got to have the unity of the spirit the Bible says You must Endeavor Endeavors what would the word endeavor mean [Music] you gotta have the half the spirit first you can have the right doctrines don't have the right Spirit to correct and you have nothing sooner or later the wrong spirit will damage or destroy you but the right Spirits bring you into the unity of the right Faith now now this is where we're going this morning that's why we should fight so hard for our families how many here are fighting for your family you got loved ones that are out there still is turn around and look keep your hands up look at your neighbor look at all the hands that are UPS how many are fighting for their families we've gotta fight for eign [Music] [Music] churches that are splitting and contramos Iglesias que estan dividendo we find marriages that are crumbling in contramos casamientos but I always tell the people there's no such a thing as a broken marriage any broken marriages in here today there's no such a thing as a broken marriage what is broken are the people in the marriage is if you fix the people you can fix the marriage amen a man hello hola let's see this he knew that if he could make man fall is there would then be a Chasm between the Son and the father ISM how how they used to walk we know this this is basically we want you to get the picture God would come down in the cool of the evening and he would say how are you doing right yes how was your day do you like the garden I made you okay ah you know I made the garden for you so he says I didn't make you for the garden I made the garden for you because I knew everything that you would love you like but Satan knew that if he could get between then cause a chasmismo and cause a Chasm between God and his son he would feel like he won and now the chasm was so great I could just see God looking over there you mean his heart was sad I miss walking with my son do you not knows church God you every day know that he wants to get in that secret place with you but he sees that we are we are on the other side of a chasmos man didn't know how to get back to God because he had become Lord I need a job Lord I need a car Lord I need this Lord I need that we know him as God we know him like that we know him in the intimacy do we know him in a relationship do we know him because we've talked to him or we just like his power to do things for us think about it because we use him like a light switch huh notice after the fall you can sit down not knowing the beginning from the end he begins to roll out his plan get this church this is important important his plan that will bring Unity to him and his family for the rest of chapter three he's still known as Lord God but at the end of chapter three he's kicked out of the garden the the man and his wife right they're they're kicked out of the garden at the moment they get out of the garden is the moment that the scriptures tells us it never shows us Lord God again they're outside of the garden there's an angel there watching yeah he's not gonna let no one in nobody and now you begin to read the scriptures and it'll either say Lord but it doesn't say Lord God he's looking for something when all of a sudden Genesis 9 26 is watch how the thing changes the same ah this is the first time since the fall that the scripture says blessed be the Lord God oh Peyton better watch it on us is getting back his family esta Familia de Nuevo there's no more Greater Joy that's why the Bible says there's no Greater Joy ladies and when one sinner repents one son comes back and now come on he's not over there anymore one son comes back and he comes back and he meets up with oh one of my sons has come home you know come back and say I want to give my life to the Lord joy in our hearts joy in the church now come home now imagine how excited God is give him our whole life now watch he's not looking really at at the carnal parte carnal he's now watching his seed estabiendo susimiente and when he sees through Shams the same he knows okay now I'm gonna start my family here on Earth now this is Sunday school it's the same Escuela Dominican from Shem that's the Sam who came from shembino the same gem was one of the one of the sons right and he began and he began and he began finally someone came from Shem but that was the reason that God said watch what he says he knows the beginning from the end so now he's looking through time and he knows who's going to come through Shem else anyone again let's come a little bit closer there you go Abram Abram and when he sees the line yes the genealogy the lineage I'm gonna say it again and that is Abram yes Abram neces yeah I don't know maybe it don't excite you but it excites because the family is gonna start being restored families now watch the unity here so here Abraham says Lord God what will you give me sin I go childless finally from human lips comes the words Lord God again oh I don't know about you but but from Abram's lips he said Lord God he didn't just say God this is the first time and it's powerful yes that he not only recognized him yes but now he's recognizing him is one of the descendants of Abrams Isaac isak now here's where we find Lord God again Genesis 28 13. and this is Jacob he has the dream yes see he has this dream and he sees this ladder in elsewhere and the Lord stood above it the Bible says I am the Lord God of Abraham Abraham now Abraham had already said Lord God and now he has accepted him and now he says I am not the not just the gods he said I am the Lord God of Abrams but notice how the scripture reads Here I Am the Lord God of Abraham thy father wasn't Abraham Jacob's grandfather nowhere yes but in the family of God God is not a grandfather foreign [Music] and we always try to understand Oriental and you can't no puede thank God for a propheta notice this not this we're always trying to understand this is but the Hebrews they do not see things the way that you and I see them our Western culture Cultura Occidental focuses us on us as individuals you see your phone somebody this is Western culture is here I am in church let me show you what I have look at my new car Nuevo I've done all this yo is I I am an astronaut too yeah I'm just just a humble man but I have a lot of money in the bank too much I don't think I have a lot of money we are a western people trying to understand an Eastern book that doesn't work that way we think of ourselves as individuals this is who and what I am is so yo brother Branham says when that bride recognizes what she is not just who but what she is question is what are you we heard last night it's not who is the Holy ghosts and more ask your neighbor that come on it's okay to talk in church ask your neighbor what are you yes we focus on the individuals on a person's achievements more than we do the family but in the Eastern culture listen to this a person's identity comes almost entirely completamente from his family lineage come on you got to think about this hello everybody hola are you awake come on now you got to go with me on this right teaching positions you uh there's different services for different things but we want to help make sure that your position properly you gotta know what you believe in whom you have believed notices now once again their identity is almost entirely from the from their family or from their lineage he is the lion of the tribe of Judah foreign lineage of preachers [Music] a pastor we can't do anything else but my father was a preacherous we can't do anything else but be a preacher that's who we are somos that's why when you see one of us up here it's not just one man you get a lineage you get a tribe come on now vamos if one preaches everybody's preaching if one prays for the sick everybody it has been restored back yes he's not just God to us no solos in the Philippines there was a translation that they made and in that translation of that of the Bible they left out the Matthew chapter one the genealogy of Jesus imagine that so and when a new translation was published some years later it included the genealogy of Jesus and the native said so do you mean yet as a seed that this Jesus was an actual person Jesus because without the genealogya some of them had believed that the scriptures were fables and it was talking about a fictional character or hero yeah but I'm here to tell you that Jesus is not a fictional character Jesus he has a genealogy come on sure I'm going to say it again he has a genealogy the Bible says in the beginning was the word says this is the genealogy of the logos the word was with God the word became flat yes he brought his genealogy they were taken from Heaven transfer to Earth God had become a man I wanna I wanna get this now this is important I think Mike got a little bit of time this is the Epic story it is tremenda of the family of God the La Familia come on where's your Bible this esta is the Epic story is tremenda of the family of God and that's why yes we find our identity oh I'm gonna say it again I I don't know who I am I don't know what my purpose is find out who your parent is kindred Find Out Who Your lineage oh we got your attention now find out who it is then you'll find out what you are man how many of you know can you imagine you know who my grandfather was my grandfather was this and this is [Music] what have you done yeah essential too [Music] I'll tell you what I am because what you see my family come on you got to take it to the spirit when you see my family you see the kind of Brothers I have what kind of Brothers do you have classes I got some good Brothers they were in the Lion's denes they weren't afraid of nobody what about you contender's Shadow would heal the people Al Pueblo [Applause] is that anybody's Brothers I can keep on telling you I have a lot of brothers I have brothers that have called fire down from heaven Hermanos I have brothers that have turned the water into blood Hermanos I have brothers that have called and raised up the dead I have brothers Hermanos and that is what and who we are today not just any kind of people the devil just run all over and I don't know what's going on with me find out who you are being afraid because Satan fears find your position does not want to say Studios now I'm gonna turn a corner because I'm I'm my time is leaving me but there was a man all the men in the old testamento he was a special man special reason he was special because of the spirit that he has each one had a job to do but God loved this Spirit of this man so much I don't know how many of you could could you say Lord do you love the spirit that I have he loved it so much that he used it five times you know who I'm talking about now right come on now now we're getting into the base part of our message who was this man yeah Elijah Elias and First Kings 18 21 says you know this is the first time now that a man will challenge the world Al Mundo concerning Lord God my brother Hermano you know he's my brother Elias Elijah for the first time for primerves somebody has risen and says I challenge I challenge the political system your ritual Systema political of Ahab and Jezebel yeah I challenge the religious world of the prophets I challenge the people of Israel that the Lord foreign well kind of I know that's a mental Spirit of Enlightenment that is a coward Spirit as soon as all those message Believers they're Cults are you a message believer um well I'm kind but no no no not really no no no no no no no that's not the spirit of Elijah the spirit of Elijah says I want to challenge the whole world and he's won with his family the whole world and say Jehovah is one with his family watch what he says oh this is the problem do you believe is it your opinion opinion is it your opinion that the message is true I believe it is it an opinion or is it a fact is it an opinion or is it reality messages I think we have the truth what do you mean we think the spirit of Elijah doesn't think that they have the truth and the spiritually is and it don't matter who come who come against them watch what he says then if the Lord be God is follow him some people have one foot in the church and one in the world but if the Lord be God follow him and come on now if the Lord be God follow him and when he becomes Lord God to you yeah he is and when you say he is Lord God and then he turns around and says yes yes he says see I am their lord and when he says okay I know we got something going on we got something going okay how many are with me this morning got something going now now you have said all right he begins to say I am your soy that I am your soy that I am I am yourself foreign it was the spirit the spirit of Elijah the Elias I want you to see something here now like 10 15 minutes yes because I want to get this that list last thought out you know Turkey who was this Elijah the Bible just says he was a Tish bite nothing much more is told about him they don't know his genealogy yeah we do but he was a word Prophet let's let's go because I want you to get this he was a man the Bible says I was subject to like passion is we're taught in the scriptures does not an immortal being said Immortal it was a man subject to like passions the Bible says he never died he went up in a whirlwind and that Spirit of Elijah it's a spiritual Alias was actually the spirit of God well Espirito de dios on the man Elijah which is what made that yes the immortal Elijah is Elias immortal not so much the man but the spirit that was on the man the immortal Elijah's Immortal Elijah me now this this brings the message all together Elijah Elias means significa of all the prophets that those Los prophetas he chooses Elijah come on somebody tell me what Elijah means good question huh gunta anybody again we'll wait peramos why did God even choose this man is foreign I gotta let that one soak in a little bit Elijah means is Elias significa my God is Jehovah medios now you know why it matters what you name your children imagine them put in the name is my God is Jehovah says that sounds like a good name my God is Jehovah a declaration just by his name declarations here's where it starts getting good his characteristics were so amazing that they even fought Jesus was Elias Elias yes or yes doc watch how close it is who is this Genesis but some say you're Elias I thought he was Elias watch this unfold here just for a moment the spirit Elijah was upon John the Baptist it was the spirit of God with that word and he had to identify the Christ but he had to identify the Christ so here comes John the Baptist he is Anointed with the spirit of Elijah now now just listen to this for a moment John chapter one one I'm not going to read it but you can read it when you get home Jesus come to and the Levites come to Jerusalem and they asked John how old is this now they asked John he has the spirit of Elijah on him he says that's the question to each one of you and he confessed I am not the Christo I'm not the Messiah and they asked him what yeah then aura what okay we thought for sure you were the cries he says he said are thou Elias it is Elias and he said I am not soy this is the scriptures I am not no soy are you that Prophet it is and he says well you're not the Christ you're not Elias you're not the prophet give us an answer because we need to take it an answer back to those that sent us he identifies himself by what one of his brothers said about him I'm gonna say that again he identifies himself by what one of his brothers said about him that was his brother Isaiah the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness yeah my brother spoke about me oh prepare ye the way of the Lord make straight in the Dead uh a highway for our God remember everything must be established by two or three Witnesses so now they come to Jesus about John the Baptista Matthew 11 if you want to read it when you get home Jesus began to say what went you out to sea Jesus propheta he is bringing out the two witnesses and Isaiah had spoken now Jesus says for this is he says I send my messenger before thy face we have one Witnesses Isaiah I like something brother Jimmy said yesterday I can't find that in the message we are the message and we are the manifestation of the message that is watch this now so then they asked him they said okay I am the Final witness that word made flesh if you will receive it this is Elias which was for to come almost sounds like the Forerunner yes he says and the cries are on two different pages John says I am not Elias Jesus said if you can receive it is this is Elias so is there a contradiction foreign okay yo if you can receive it is John the Baptist was saying are you Elias it is yes I am not the Tish bite no soil that's my brother is oh you are who you are it is you can't be another person you were made original you were made unique no one else made life you're part of uh this is Elias is so many people today says are you say anything brother branham's Elijah uh no no not the Tish bite he's not that man well some say brother Branham that you are Jesus Christ no you're making me an antichristo brother Branham was one man Jesus Christ was another man if you try to make me the person of Jesus Christ that the spirit of Christ is upon me and it's doing a work through me yes you can receive the prophet in this day you can receive it is to restore the family foreign [Music] that alohim felt in the beginning Jesus then felt alone my father had left the Sun and now you see them and their they're not together it's separated again I got the family again let me tell you something church he calls for Elias he's calling for the to save him and everybody's waiting are you the Elias they don't realize they've had a lot of Elijah's mantels but in all reality the mantle of Elijah is the responsibility is the responsibility and he put it on [Music] what's the purpose of the message of restoration no I am one but also you know yes [Music] it is the voice of Elijah is [Applause] to keep it alive come on church I'm gonna say it again no other Prophet could do it because Elijah's name means my God is and that's why he had to use the spirit fight manana that he's still trying to break up the family Familia I know some of you are struggling maybe your families are struggling as you bow your heads when I ask at this moment if you see your home struggling he promised to send Elijah the prophet El promise for the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord shall turn the hearts heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children back to the fathers so I'm gonna ask you is he just God the Lois Dios or is he Lord God yes is he one with his family are you one with him ask yourself the questions are you one with him or are you is there still a Chasm between you I can't answer that you gotta answers so if you say brother I need some help that's where why we're here is there a brother
