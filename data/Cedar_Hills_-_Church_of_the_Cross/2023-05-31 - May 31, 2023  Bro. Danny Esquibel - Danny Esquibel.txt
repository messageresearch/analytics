I changed it up on you brother yeah but uh we're going to start with John 8. um 31. right so we can then we'll read this and then you can take your seats and then set Jesus to those Jews which believed on him you continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed Jesus and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free amen and may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word the truth you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free right no okay so you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free right so how many free people do we have here tonight right so we got quite a few hands this evening how many people that didn't raise your hand want to be made free tonight right okay so we don't have no hands foreign and now the other half that didn't raise their hand said they wanted to be free but they didn't raise their hand that they wanted to be free so let's start let's go with another scripture here and we're going to go to John 4. and we all know the scripture very well right so we're going to start with actually verse 13. and uh so this is Jesus speaking to the woman at the well amen Jesus and so I'm going to read it to you in another version while you follow along there it says then Jesus answered Jesus if you drink from Jacob's Well you will be thirsty again so we gotta stop right there and find out what the word if means right it's just a two-letter word amen so if see is introducing a conditional Clause is right so it's a conditional Clause right if f c it's a conditional Clause right and so you would use the word if in conditional sentence in in France sentences to introduce the circumstance yes in which an event or situation might happen might be happening or it might have happened right but if anyone drinks The Living Water I give them they will never be thirsty again so if you can put that scripture back up so they can read along right uh for they will never be thirsty again for when you drink the water I give you it becomes a gushing Fountain of the Holy Spirit flooding you with endless life right man okay so you know when the woman replies uh let's drink that water so I'll never be thirsty again then you'll sit as that old that I won't have to come back here to draw water Jesus said go get your husband and bring him back here and she says I have no husband right that's true right that's the next verse there and so I'm reading it in this version right for thou has had five husbands but it says here that's true Jesus said or you've been married five times and now you're living with a man who is not your husband you have told the truth right so first of all we got to be truthful you want to be made free tonight then you got to be truthful right nothing happened for this woman here she could have simply said uh she could have said something else other than that she had no husband he could have said he's out of town oh my husband he's not a Believer no but she says I have no husband and Jesus said you have said truth right so you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free right and Jesus also said Jesus that my words are spiritual and they are live right so how many want to be made free again right okay so not everybody wants to be made free but right because you're going to be made free one way or the other because Satan also has Freedom right we're living in a day and age everybody wants their freedom right nobody wants to be told what to do right uh everybody wants to be free oh I'm free at last the young people young young people nowadays they they say uh when I'm 18. I'm gonna move out of the house I'm gonna go get me an apartment I'm gonna do whatever I want to do I'm gonna be free all right okay okay go ahead but everybody wants their freedom so to be free the definition for free is that you're not under the control is and able to act to act able to act foreign I would be free so you're not so everybody today wants to be made free right they want their freedom but we know that there's only one free and that is in Christ right that's God's Freedom today and the only way to receive that freedom is to have the truth now that's word their truth is something that a lot of people today don't like is mucho is right nobody wants to hear the truth but we know in the scriptures as we've heard that God is seeking so you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free now we know that worship and spirit and Espiritu right they're all connected into truth right so people say today I worship God right I hear it all the time right everybody claims to be Christians nowadays right everybody's Christian oh I met this guy at the store he's a Christian is I met this guy he wants us to pray for him he's a Christian right so everybody today is Christian right but we all know that a Christian is to be christ-like right and there was only one who came to show us what Christ was amen right so there'll be a lot of so-called Christians well we know so so let's read what brother Brown says here yeah now he's speaking in the message God's provided God's chosen place so now the title of the message is right but if I was to have a third title and take a page out of Brother Jimmy's book right it would be God's chosen place of worship now what does all that have to combine right we want to be made free right okay so now notice brother Brandon here he says the second verse so this is out of God's chosen place of worship paragraph 26 but foreign I want to worship him we all here tonight to worship him we're sitting here tonight Jehovah Witness Christian Science but we're all thinking something we want to know truth the Bible said You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free somebody again you can't know what you're doing you don't know how to do it until you know how to do it right you know how to do it rather rather entonces you must know what you're doing and how to do it so you might say I'm gonna go to church I'll go over I'll go to church that's fine but unless you know what you're doing you won't know how to go to church what do you mean how to know how to go to church you get in the car you drive to church it is you just think okay and if you don't know how to go to church and why you go to church you won't know what you received when they're preaching you won't know what it's all about you won't know the truth now who wants to come to church in the time that we're living in is right that would be that'd be insane right but you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free and you won't know how to do it [Music] you must you must know what you're doing and how to do it this shows us that God has a meeting place for his worshipers in one certain place in that place only God meets his worshipers now also the place he has chosen for his worshipers he claimed he would put his name now that's the funny thing about the name right because we hear it so often said wherever two or three are gathered in my name there I am in the midst of them but that's the secret there that is it's the name in el nombre thank you also worship Earth he claimed this shows us that God has a meaning place for his worshipers in one certain place in that place only where God meets his worshipers he claimed he would put his name now let's search out and find through the scriptures where this place is surely if God said he would put his name in this place where he had chosen to meet the people in worship with them or them worship Him that's that it's somewhere in the Bible is for it was all ages and the great unchanging God cannot change man changes but you can put your life upon anything that God ever said at any time because it is for you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free if you're ever in jail how many have ever been put in jail oh yeah I remember I'll see you my question I remember yeah me and brother Jerry Gonzalez right we stopped at your house put in jail one day I was going to work five o'clock in the morning and got pulled over they put me in jail oh my goodness oh my God right but when you go to jail you can be set free it's like I always say about diets right well say I'm gonna go on a diet oh it's just a set free mentality right you're set free from that Donuts right but that donut will come again and haunt you a little later on down the road right because it's got to be a changing of the mind right it's got to be a changing of your habits or it can be like the doctor will say okay if you don't stop you're gonna die tomorrow right that puts a little uh fire under you right a little problem comes up in the church right that's why you can go to church if you don't know what you're doing just right a little problem will come up in the church I'm not going to church no more oh yeah right I'm gonna I'm not gonna go to church no more right little tiny prong oh my that guy hurt my feelings over there I'm not going to church you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free now you want to be made free so you know why people don't come to church right because they pick up a morbid Spirit right we heard right it's not for any other reason think about it yeah your feelings hurt based on your emotions right and then all of a sudden you got this spirit that gets a hold of you yeah and morbid meaning to have a disease or the symptoms of a disease right you say oh I got I'm not gonna go I'm just going to leave it to God I'm gonna put it in God's hands right like if God's a magician right right but his word says he has a chosen place where he has chosen to place his name so there's no other healing you're not going to throw it in the laps of God's going to take care of it right my heart is broken my heart is in right but God's going to take care of it well God has a chosen place of worship the place where he meets the worshipers in his words his word is but if we find out that people don't really want to be made free so God has a place where he has placed his name right and we say oh no there we're all Christians no we don't get bad spirits right no no nothing ever gets a hole no no no no talking about nothing ever gets a hold of me you know who I am I've been a disciple for 30 years right so let's find out one time Jesus Jesus he was talking to Peter and the disciples and he the Bible says that he began to talk about his crucifixion and we find it in Matthew 16 21 right and so we're going to read it and I'm going to read it in this version here okay from then on Jesus began to clearly reveal to his disciples that he was destined to go to Jerusalem and suffer Injustice he also explained that he would be killed three days later for life again [Music] verse 22 Peter took him aside and representatives to correct him privately he reprimanded Jesus Jesus over and over God forbid Master Senor prepare yourself you must never let this happen to you and right away Jesus recognizes that was the same message because your thoughts and so I'm gonna go help somebody you become a hindrance and his truth people say oh I'm gonna go help this brother well what if that brother needs a heart transplant neces and you're a chiropractor Pedro [Applause] right so you want to be made free only by the truth what is truth did you hear the truth now you can come to church that's great you can hear the prophets that's great we should do that and still not know the truth so I hear tapes every day you still might not know the truth oh but when he reveals himself in his chosen place of worship he Reveals His name so he has a name right he reveals it to you in Galatians 1 15. he said but when they please God is when did it please God he consented to the death of Stephen Madre hey man yes sir but he consented to the death we heard that right and he called me by his grace to be a good church member did he call you here to be a good church member no he called us to reveal his son and each and every one of us it don't do no good brother Branham if he doesn't know himself if he doesn't reveal himself then we're just good church members it doesn't implemented but we shall know the truth and what are we here to do in me that it might preach him amongst the heathen he revealed himself call me by his grace that I might preach amongst things A good sermon on Wednesday we got those a dime a dozen of this right good sermons everywhere right correct to preach A good sermon sermon no the truth no La verdad Jesus said he who hears my words he hears the truth is you hear his words not the words of our pastors but the words of the ministers they're Jesus's words see I am not the light no man is the light Jesus said Jesus my spirit is the oil that lights the candle Jesus is the light Jesus without Jesus we can do nothing but when Jesus lights cannot be here but he wants to reveal himself Iglesia what did Brother Branham do revealed the Mighty God Amen that little girl if Jesus was here right he would lay his hands upon you but in his status but he wants to reveal himself there's only one way right and in John 8 34. Glory Jesus answered verily I say unto you whosoever committed to sin is the servant of sin yes and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth ever yes right and so brother Brandon says here now there's only one way for you to receive truth brother Brown says I was telling someone this afternoon in a little meeting I said every son that's born of God has to be tried first primero Jason I remember when I had mine do you remember when you had yours he said I remember when I had mine oh my greatest hours when when a man is born again there's a little spot like size of a fingernails that God get yours injects into his system in susiastema okay God does that says cooperate with me hmm for when you're born again there's a little spot the size of a fingernails but you must be proven Luke 22 Lucas verse 31. right so we say oh it's gonna be a Bed of Roses right and I'm reading it in the translation version here Peter my dear friend listen to what I am about to tell you is Satan has obtained permission to come and sift you like wheat and test your faith right he obtained permission so we must be tried but here's Jesus Jesus okay so Jesus is in the garden Jesus is praying is right how many know that he's praying right no where was Jesus given the power Jesus right he says in in John 17 he's saying he says all power was given to me right well was that fulfilled right then and therefore was it fulfilled right then and there no he had to go to the Cross he had to be tried he had to be proven to look as a problem brother Brown says that in injection to his system and it falls into his heart and their anchors makes him prove it you say you're a Christiano Satan satanas make him prove it you say that you're this or that makes him prove it but in the garden Jesus Jesus was praying he said all power has been given to me right but he first had to go to the Cross right he had to be go to the cross and he had to die right and in that scripture there is Jesus says I am no longer in the world no longer in the world the Bible says that he was in The Garden of Gethsemane Elizabeth and he was praying yes and he says I am no longer in the world or was he not in the world no but as he was in the garden he was praying not my will no me volunteer but I will be if at all possible but not my will nevertheless but I will be done I am no longer in the world right he asked the question is you think that the disciples had the answer you think the disciples had the revelation of who Jesus was yes or no right Peter got a revelation right right Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God but you think Peter had a full revelation of who he was was Jesus didn't even have a full revelation of who he was Jesus he said I come from God I go back together he knew that much but when he was in the garden and he said I am no longer in the world what happened he gave up his will he says and he came face to face but he had to give up his will first we have to be proven but they don't John 8 one Ocho 36. didn't they say we want to be made free tonight if the father no right we so much we often repeat this scripture he whom the son had set free okay it's free indeed is no that's not what it says it says see introduce the circumstance in which an event or a situation might happen it might be happening right now it might have already happened therefore you are free indeed wow it says in this version here so if the sun sets you free from sin then become a true son and be unquestionably free um so if the sun sets you free from sin he's gonna set you free so [Applause] by his name or sunombre so he has a place where he has put his name in Galatians 5 1 in galatas it was for Freedom that Christ has made us set us free is it was for Freedom that Christ has set us free okay you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free if you if you said if see if see there's the condition there is if a man drinks from this well set you free you're no more a slave daughter of God he don't set you free and you become a prisoner now Matthew 16 14 in closing so I like to read this I don't like a lot of other things about this but I like to read these in this version here right so I want to be free then Jesus said to his disciples if you truly want to follow me you should at once completely reject and disown your own life and you must be willing to share my cross and experience it is experience no we're we're in Matthew 16 24. and you must be willing to share my cross and experience it as your own as you continually surrender to my ways I mean for if you choose self-sacrifice foreign is this great news noticias yes I got some great news Jesus loves you Jesus and he wants to make you free Jesus Loves You Jesus and he wants to make you free oh but brother you don't know my life oh I'm I'm this oh this is Jesus loves you and he wants to make you free oh brother but you don't know what happened to me when I was in the past Jesus Loves You Jesus and he wants to make you free but there's some bad news bad news is Jesus Loves You Jesus and he wants to make you free so just as he died you're gonna have to die the same way you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free if the sun makes you free you are free indeed you might be in jail you might have already been set free but when you're made free actually all you're waiting foreign was a thief it was a thief well guess what you know what the difference is like my daddy used to say all the time you know what's the difference between a thief in jail outside of jail foreign right and so he found himself on the cross well the son Elijah was there hanging on the cross if thou canceled and he said I know you'll say that you are you stays who you say you are interested is a kiss remember me remember me if the Sun hijo he says you will enter into Paradise can you imagine the scene Jesus died Jesus right his body goes to the great his soul Goes to Hell the spirit goes back to God right right and so that beef is the one who was at the gate my name is okay again what church did you go to I I didn't go to church well when were you baptized
