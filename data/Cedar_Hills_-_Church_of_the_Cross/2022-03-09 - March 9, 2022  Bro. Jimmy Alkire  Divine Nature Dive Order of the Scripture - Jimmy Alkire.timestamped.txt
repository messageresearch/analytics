[38:12] oh yeah that's the stature of a perfect
[38:15] man
[38:18] what a thing
[38:20] let's go ahead and read
[38:22] simon peter a servant
[38:25] an apostle of jesus christ to them that
[38:28] have obtained life precious faith with
[38:32] us
[38:33] to the righteousness of god and our

[39:14] up to us all things
[39:17] that pertain unto life and godliness
[39:20] through the knowledge of him that have
[39:22] called us to glory and virtue
[39:26] with allah
[39:36] amen and i still needed to stay back
[39:39] and
[39:40] yeah
[39:41] is this verse 4 okay it's right very
[39:44] well wherefore are given unto us
[39:46] exceeding great
[39:48] and precious promises
[39:50] that by these you might be partakers of
[39:54] the divine nature
[39:56] having escaped the corruption that is in
[39:59] the world through lust
[40:07] participated
[40:16] and beside this
[40:19] giving all
[40:21] diligence i like that
[40:37] and to knowledge temperance
[40:39] temperance patience
[40:41] to patient's godliness
[40:49] amen and i think we'll stop right there
[40:50] because i'm not going to really go into
[40:52] those details
[40:56] but let's go to our next scripture in
[40:58] first peter 1
[41:00] verses 23 through 25
[41:06] why don't we read this one together
[41:10] but when we when we say the first word
[41:12] being i want you to hold it
[41:18] just hold it just make it long you know
[41:21] so it might just anchor inside of you
[41:24] the plot will say
[41:26] you ready okay
[41:29] [Music]
[41:31] born again
[41:46] oh
[41:48] not of corruptable seed but of
[41:50] incorruptible by the word of god which
[41:53] liveth and abideth forever
[41:59] is
[42:13] all the glory of man has the flower of
[42:15] the grass
[42:18] with rest
[42:20] the flower faded away
[42:26] but the word of the lord endureth
[42:28] forever
[42:31] and this is the word which by the gospel
[42:34] is preached unto
[42:41] hello
[42:55] it never gets old lord
[43:06] where
[43:07] we prepare ourselves to
[43:10] be in your
[43:24] that you would make us more like you
[43:26] lord jesus christ
[43:29] we all together as the church of the
[43:32] living god
[43:33] is
[43:53] i'm gonna probably focus a little more
[43:55] tonight on what
[43:57] the new spirit actually is
[44:05] you're gonna like
[44:18] oh i'm sure you understand the words
[44:26] i'm referring to how you and i
[44:29] read the scriptures
[44:34] are
[44:50] we look at it like something is
[44:52] something that we don't have
[44:58] it's basically an external thing to us
[45:01] yes
[45:05] but we do not understand how it applies
[45:07] to us internally
[45:12] so i'm going to start with a few
[45:14] questions
[45:27] by a seed which is the living word of
[45:30] god
[45:37] a word that has not been touched by the
[45:40] intelligence of the carnal mind
[45:58] mess around with god's word
[46:04] because that changes the life of the
[46:06] scene
[46:10] there's many different things that we
[46:11] don't want to get into
[46:12] much
[46:20] [Music]
[46:41] is it out here is
[46:44] that
[46:45] or is it in here
[46:48] amen
[46:50] how many will say raise your hand that
[46:52] you're born again
[47:07] did you know that inside of that seed
[47:12] is everything you'll ever need in this
[47:15] journey
[47:18] inside of that seed
[47:21] is what will produce a man or a woman
[47:25] made in the image of god
[47:31] all the potential is inside of that
[47:34] scene
[48:01] there has to be a channel
[48:08] here's the one we really have a hard
[48:10] time
[48:13] who is the real you
[48:18] your true identity of who you are
[48:31] that you have been born
[48:55] christ christo one more time
[48:58] where is it
[49:00] christ christo
[49:02] this is abc you always believe christ
[49:07] is christ in you
[49:10] now in our divine order
[49:14] of the scriptures
[49:17] it's not that god has to
[49:19] to put it that way for himself
[49:24] but he put it in this order
[49:26] for you and me
[49:41] and that when we see ourself identified
[49:44] in god's word
[49:47] and we stay with god's plan
[49:52] nothing can stop us
[49:55] from being a manifested
[50:10] of
[50:23] why because we can't see what's on the
[50:25] inside
[50:28] so we separate everything
[50:30] and the way we judge everything
[50:34] everything
[50:35] is based
[50:37] on
[50:48] and that's why satan chose the head over
[50:51] the heart
[51:06] because he knew he could put man in this
[51:08] condition
[51:12] and as he attacks your mind with things
[51:15] that you can see taste film smell here
[51:21] he turns you into an external
[51:24] feature
[51:28] externa everything in the physical realm
[51:31] controls
[51:36] and this is where we're going to start
[51:37] getting into
[51:39] a new nature
[51:42] praise the lord jesus i know i'm
[51:44] speaking slow but i'm doing it on
[51:45] purpose
[51:48] the holy spirit wants you to get this el
[51:50] espiritu
[51:52] he doesn't only want you to get this
[51:56] he wants you to apply it
[51:59] amen
[52:00] let's continue
[52:04] an external creature that has no
[52:06] conscience
[52:07] of what is happening
[52:25] see when we read the scriptures we don't
[52:27] understand the divine order of god of
[52:30] how he will open and reveal
[52:33] the scriptures to us
[52:42] how he will open
[52:44] up
[52:58] the scriptures
[53:12] but our approach is from the outside to
[53:16] the inside
[53:21] god's approaches from the inside
[53:24] out
[53:25] is
[53:54] that emptiness remains permanency
[53:57] we just don't get it no no no
[54:00] it doesn't work
[54:02] there is no true change internally
[54:08] we
[54:14] i tried but it didn't work
[54:19] don't tell me you've never felt that way
[54:22] no sentiments
[54:54] you know
[54:55] what about almost a month ago three
[54:57] weeks ago my brother jerry
[54:59] de la preached
[55:03] and he went into institute
[55:18] but it says i will give unto you a new
[55:20] heart
[55:22] and put a new spirit in you
[55:24] spirit
[55:26] young people what does that mean
[55:28] significance or homelessness
[55:30] god's gonna put a new heart in me yes
[56:15] now when you are reborn you don't
[56:18] get a new speech
[56:22] you get a new nature
[56:26] spirit
[56:28] it is the same
[56:41] how does he change
[57:20] now i'm going to change the order of
[57:21] this little bit guys i want to go to the
[57:24] definition of the word nature
[57:28] amen
[57:31] now this might seem like a little bit of
[57:32] greek to you at first
[57:36] it may seem like a little bit of greek
[57:38] to europe
[57:41] you might not quite catch it just the
[57:43] way
[57:44] i believe the holy spirit will help you
[57:47] see it
[57:51] stick with it
[58:01] maybe it was my writing bro or thing
[58:04] but it it's hand thing all right
[58:20] this position will take you to the word
[58:22] composition
[58:26] what does that mean
[58:29] what makes you tick
[58:34] your makeup
[58:36] amen
[58:38] the way you work on the inside and out
[58:43] and the enemy knows that
[58:46] from the time you were born in this
[58:47] earth
[59:01] and you came into this world speaking
[59:03] lives
[59:05] even though you didn't want to lie
[59:08] okay
[59:09] a creative or controlling force in the
[59:12] universe
[59:16] what is that god this is divine in
[59:20] nature
[59:22] all the scientific world can call
[59:24] whatever they want
[59:27] said why if there was there's a great
[59:30] center
[59:45] how in the world do you think god
[59:47] created you bro
[59:50] you're wonderfully and beautifully made
[59:54] you the same way he made himself
[1:00:12] is
[1:00:26] so are you living in the world that
[1:00:27] you're creating
[1:00:30] well the truth is we are living in the
[1:00:32] world with work you've created
[1:00:37] the right
[1:00:38] world solo no es el mundo
[1:00:55] or oh
[1:00:57] the sum
[1:00:58] of such forces in
[1:01:01] an individual
[1:01:03] in an individual
[1:01:05] do you know what's in you
[1:01:08] instead
[1:01:31] [Music]
[1:01:34] but then i have to study the scripture
[1:01:36] and the message to see if that was
[1:01:38] the right spirit
[1:01:42] amen
[1:01:43] okay
[1:01:45] the fifth one i won't get into that one
[1:01:47] much because
[1:01:48] i might lose
[1:02:05] did you know the prophet says
[1:02:08] that the church is not an organization
[1:02:12] is an organization it's an organization
[1:02:16] an organism an organism has life within
[1:02:19] itself
[1:02:20] then through the sea but an organization
[1:02:22] an organization it's a system
[1:02:26] you try to keep a certain portion of
[1:02:28] god's word
[1:02:31] but closest to the door to the further
[1:02:34] parts of the word that need to be
[1:02:35] revealed
[1:02:41] let's go back to where we were at
[1:02:46] amen now brothers
[1:02:49] uh can you give me the next quote
[1:02:54] okay
[1:02:59] the greatest battle ever fought
[1:03:14] then what does that do
[1:03:18] from the middle of the heart which is
[1:03:20] the soul
[1:03:23] there it goes forth feeding every
[1:03:24] channel
[1:03:27] the trouble of it is the problem is
[1:03:30] we're standing in here with a lot of
[1:03:32] doubt
[1:03:35] trying to accept what's out here
[1:03:39] oh wait we can read the word
[1:03:42] we're trying to
[1:04:47] and satan's approach is also from the
[1:04:49] inside yeah
[1:04:52] well i thought he chose the
[1:05:13] oh
[1:05:22] now before we go to the definition of
[1:05:25] the word nature
[1:05:28] definition
[1:05:30] how many of you eagles
[1:05:33] what is
[1:06:03] praise the lord brothers can you
[1:06:05] put up the next one the interval
[1:06:10] amen
[1:06:14] this is in paragraph
[1:06:16] 60.
[1:06:29] he said after he gives us your new
[1:06:31] spirit especially
[1:06:34] that's
[1:06:36] you yes
[1:06:39] that's the nugget
[1:06:42] it's not the kernel of the nugget yet
[1:06:44] no es el centro
[1:06:57] now don't confuse that with god's spirit
[1:07:03] it's your new spirit
[1:07:05] so you can get along with the holy
[1:07:07] spirit
[1:07:10] you can't even get along with your wife
[1:07:24] m
[1:07:29] how are you ever going to get along with
[1:07:31] god
[1:07:35] he has to give you a new spirit
[1:07:39] or he can get
[1:07:40] along
[1:07:54] i
[1:08:20] gives you a new outlook
[1:08:36] there
[1:08:39] how can this new spirit be you como este
[1:08:42] no spiritu
[1:08:44] brother sammy where did that spirit come
[1:08:46] from
[1:08:51] who created that spirit
[1:08:56] now it's going to get a little
[1:08:57] crazy
[1:09:02] genesis 1 26 we're not going to turn to
[1:09:05] it
[1:09:08] where god said
[1:09:10] let us make man in our image and in our
[1:09:13] life
[1:09:16] what kind of a man
[1:09:31] and he marks that spirit
[1:09:34] marcus espirito was the generic code
[1:09:39] of the
[1:09:40] let
[1:09:42] us the agamos
[1:09:44] not let me
[1:09:57] does your spirit say
[1:10:00] does your spirit say
[1:10:02] let us agamus make me
[1:10:06] is it still saying the same thing
[1:10:12] in our image
[1:10:14] isn't that what god's doing here
[1:10:18] god never stopped making men
[1:10:28] to me but i mean
[1:10:30] that shows me that that spirit
[1:10:34] that was created there
[1:10:37] god knew
[1:10:39] i was gonna fall
[1:10:42] down
[1:10:57] he knew his plan of redemption
[1:11:01] that he had laid out
[1:11:04] before the foundation of the world
[1:11:07] that it would never fail
[1:11:10] he also
[1:11:51] but through the plan of redemption
[1:11:59] this spirit that we have
[1:12:02] he created there
[1:12:04] and it's been restored back to the
[1:12:06] discussion
[1:12:19] my
[1:12:24] where were you when i laid the
[1:12:26] foundations of the earth
[1:12:29] fundamentally ask yourself that question
[1:12:34] verses
[1:12:48] thank you
[1:12:51] where was that when i laid the
[1:12:53] foundations of the earth declare if you
[1:12:56] have
[1:12:57] thou has understanding don't establish
[1:13:02] intelligence
[1:13:05] imagine god tells jobs you stand up like
[1:13:07] a man
[1:13:12] i'm gonna speak to you
[1:13:14] and this world then comes down
[1:13:27] who have laid the measurements thereof
[1:13:59] [Music]
[1:14:33] whereupon are the foundations they're
[1:14:36] all fastened
[1:14:38] and who laid their quarters though
[1:14:40] there's
[1:14:46] [Music]
[1:15:22] i'm going to read it
[1:15:28] amen
[1:15:29] you're going to remember tonight
[1:15:32] but my whole goal is for you to remember
[1:15:50] before
[1:16:04] before there was a foundation of the
[1:16:06] world
[1:16:08] before there was
[1:16:10] them angels
[1:16:14] and everything was happy
[1:17:40] was to bring me from the spirit
[1:17:55] oh brother seed oh my gosh
[1:18:51] he knew he was going to turn on him
[1:18:55] he didn't waste no time
[1:18:59] he laid out his plan
[1:19:03] retention is not something new
[1:19:15] [Music]
[1:19:59] that god's plan will produce
[1:20:02] actually
[1:20:41] it's right what he said
[1:20:43] but you go look up that word water spout
[1:20:49] video of what a water spot was located
[1:20:52] it's
[1:20:53] a tornado
[1:20:55] that goes off the shore
[1:20:58] into the ocean
[1:21:10] and it's making a
[1:21:13] and when it noise
[1:21:14] to the top because
[1:21:15] it sprays up the water in a circle
[1:21:21] as far as it has pressure to throw it
[1:21:23] out
[1:21:25] that's in that space he can stay in this
[1:21:28] area he's gonna get saturated
[1:21:32] anybody in that space
[1:21:38] with the holy ghost
[1:21:40] with the water
[1:22:21] it's not just one little
[1:22:47] why
[1:22:53] the really
[1:22:56] the original spirit of who you are
[1:23:02] before the world ever began
[1:23:18] let's
[1:23:28] the divine order of the scriptures
[1:23:34] amen simon peter a servant an apostle of
[1:23:37] jesus christ with them and have obtained
[1:23:39] like precious faith with us through the
[1:23:42] righteousness of god
[1:23:43] and our savior jesus christ
[1:23:57] that the only way to build this that
[1:24:00] you're the perfect man
[1:24:14] these people here
[1:24:17] is the pueblo same like precious space
[1:24:22] amen
[1:24:23] amen and he was going to build on that
[1:24:27] uh
[1:24:42] is
[1:25:33] you're not going to get this from the
[1:25:34] office of the sun no
[1:25:38] you gotta
[1:25:52] but i'm telling you peter
[1:25:54] pedro you got a glimpse beforehand
[1:25:58] do you know why peter
[1:26:00] pedro
[1:26:05] but now jesus has returned to the office
[1:26:08] of the father jesus
[1:26:10] and now we get this revelation
[1:26:14] from that eternal spirit is this a
[1:26:16] spirit to eternal
[1:26:18] nature
[1:26:20] and it's what he's building his church
[1:26:22] on yes
[1:26:24] that's why there's no message like this
[1:26:26] message
[1:26:28] takes us back to the foundation of
[1:26:30] apostles
[1:26:33] prophets
[1:26:38] i want you to notice something let's go
[1:26:39] back to that scripture again in a second
[1:26:41] peter right
[1:26:45] on 45 46 i'm going to try to stay to 50
[1:26:48] if i can
[1:26:49] let's go down to verse three
[1:26:52] please
[1:26:54] if you can here we go
[1:26:56] according as his divine power had given
[1:26:59] unto us all things that pertain to life
[1:27:01] and god
[1:27:30] he doesn't identify what it is
[1:27:32] no identification because there are
[1:27:34] things that he put in man
[1:27:39] that this divine power
[1:27:42] has to bring out
[1:27:59] access to all of these things
[1:28:04] let's go to verse 4
[1:28:08] same scripture
[1:28:10] thank you
[1:28:12] whereby are given unto us
[1:28:22] exceeding greats
[1:28:25] igrandissimus
[1:28:28] and precious promises
[1:28:31] but why would we need these great and
[1:28:33] precious promises if by this divine
[1:28:35] power he gave us all things
[1:28:40] because by these great
[1:28:42] and exceedingly great promises
[1:28:47] he would put into action you open it in
[1:28:49] action
[1:28:50] the divine power of god el porter
[1:28:52] divided to bring these things
[1:29:04] amen
[1:29:06] that by these you might be partakers of
[1:29:09] the divine nature
[1:29:11] having escaped the corruption
[1:29:13] of the world through last year
[1:29:22] wow
[1:29:24] next verse verse 5 versus
[1:29:28] amen
[1:29:30] and beside this
[1:29:33] giving all diligence
[1:29:36] add
[1:29:37] to the like precious faith
[1:29:40] did you catch it
[1:29:42] add
[1:29:44] to your faith
[1:29:48] becomes your faith
