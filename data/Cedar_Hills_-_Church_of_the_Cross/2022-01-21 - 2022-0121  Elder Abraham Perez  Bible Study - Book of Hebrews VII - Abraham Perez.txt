[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you so here [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] so [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] you god bless you this evening anytime we can come it's a privilege and i thank each and every one of you of making the effort not to hear me but to hear right from the [Music] hebrews 4 1. you have it you can see ma'am let us therefore fear lest a promise be left us of entering to his rest many of you should seem to come short of it heavenly father we give you thanks lord as we hunger and thirst to learn more about you because the scripture states that in the last days there will be a famine that you help your humble servant this evening i'll try to explain this chapter 4 of the book of hebrews because without your help how am i going to help your children so i place this and everything into your hands en susmanos for your honor and glory to andre is to gloria in the name of the lord jesus christ you may be seated good to see you brother reasons sister pena again you know yes and everyone else it's good to see you guys as we go deeper into the book of hebrews it's gonna get deeper and deeper yeah yeah but it's gonna get cooler and cooler amen amen because many times we ignore more than what we know so we are going to start off where we left off the last time now paul in the last chapter was trying to tell them about these things and paul met him in pablo line control face to face kara akara that pillar of fire este pilar de fuego and since he was unconverted it caused him to have eye problems the rest of his life so we see here these pilgrims on a journey [Music] have test masters ordering them what to do not as the the pillar of fire led them because [Music] but that was not the rest that was talking about here it we're talking about another arrest the the promise was to enter his rest the promised adventure and so reposter there's a difference i i start a difference here there is a promise and don't come sure of it what [Music] so the gospel was preached to them but the bible says and we did not profit them it is not lost a prophet saw and you say well that happened to them what the heck do we preach from behind this pulpit so we praise the gospel is it the pastor presses many hours starting and he doesn't profit hours and hours we have to study but because it is the good and all of you i don't care where you came or who was your father or mother you were in bondage to something important so the good news is i hope that that does not happen in this congregation you people are so privileged can you imagine who founded this church the greatest teacher we've ever heard and on the line of him under the and i believe it is profit each and every one of them what would happen if the pastor said we're going to have service every day of the week oh no sunday morning is enough so people that think that way [Music] a the rest of the day yeah don't eat your breakfast don't eat the rest of the day see how it goes yes it's what you're hungry hunger for it is [Music] it was it was not mixed with faith on those that hurt him romans 10 16 romanos yes this he says but they have not all obeyed the gospel for isaiah said lord who have believed our report not all foolish galatians who have been wished you that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes jesus christ has been evidently served forth crucified among you representative this only would i learn of you receiving the spirit by the words of the law or by the hearing of faith go ahead are years of foolish having begun in the spirit are ye not made perfect by the flesh have you suffered so many things in vain if it be yet in vain here for the ministers of you the spirit and workers miracles among you that it doesn't it by the words of the law or by the hearing of faith [Music] but [Music] to condemn for we which have believed do enter the rest as he said as i have fallen in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day and these wise and god did rest the seventh day from all his words so the seventh day is god's rest how did god rest come up with [Music] but brother branham said so how can god rest physically there used to be when i was a teenager i mean the kimly and there used to be a unilateral holder there was a cigarette called camo and they publicized it i'll walk a mile for a camel remember what if you didn't have a car and you have to walk a mile to this church look at the testimonies that caleb and these brothers that go to uganda what they walk their brother how many [Music] they don't come in brand new cars and trucks 80 miles ah but in the day of judgement everything will be [Music] [Music] like brother caleb said le sandy and he made also the question does god have a finger you know well how did he write the ten commandments how did he write the handwriting on the wall does god [Music] and he said thou cannot see my face for there shall no man see me and leave and the lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand my glory passes by that i will put thee in a cleft of the rock and will cover this with my hand while i pass by gloria and i will take away my hand and thou shalt see my back part but my face shall not be seen apart and the lord came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood in the door of a tabernacle and called aaron and miriam and they both came and he said hear now my word if there be a prophet among you i the lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak unto him in a dream my servant moses is not so who is faithful in all my house is with him will speak mouth to mouth even apparently and not in dark species in the similitude of the lord shall he behold wherefore there were ye not afraid to speak against my servant moses in the hebrew it does not say similitude he said moses is in the form of the lord and allah john among the candlesticks see someone in the similarity of the son of man juan novyo los candoleros but now he says in the similarity of the lord but already he looked just in like just like god and the form of the lord foreign and he shall be thy spokesman unto the people and he shall be even he shall beat him instead of a mouth and thou shall be to him instead of he was in the form of god and he looked just like god and the lord said unto moses see i have maybe a god to pharaoh and ever thy brother shall be thy prophet is moses was the god to the people remember what moses had told the people pueblo today if you hear his voice you'll get us to us hard not your heart but the gospel preached to them did not profit them without faith so they provoked god and made him angry provocative for the whole human so now race threw himself in the bridge for his role remember moses was the only one who could speak to god we read that in numbers 12-8 remember who else in the bible could talk you made a promise to these people now you want to kill them you were supposed to take them to the land of promise but now you will not kill them so what's wrong with you you imagine a man talking their way to god he said you're going back on your word it seemed that god was going to do something contrary to what he already has spoken nobody else could talk to god that way all right muy bien i won't destroy them now oh no that's true but i will is mouth in that old house in hanover that we lived in there were cracks on the wall and we would wake up in the morning i mean we couldn't even open our [Music] it we both ambus we had to get water from a whale we wore hand-me-down clothes i would go to school with one shoe different from the other eva and the kids would make fun of me one time i had to wear my brother moy's combat boots to school you should have seen how the kids were so cool they made a lot of fun the stove that my mother had was a wood stove so we would have to go cut wood in the hills and come bring it home [Music] would load other trucks a lot of the coal would fall on the ground so me and my brother danny and brother tommy would take some bags and pick up the cold from the side of the railroad tracks so we use some of that coal to heat the put in the wood stove it's [Music] civilization is traveling got to the time that we had a stove that burned kerosene or petroleum and then further on this place we've got to burn butane propane civil not people get have solar panels look at the civilization if you buy those solar panels the sun will give energy inside your house when we were all in the world or in different denominations we were burning wood and coal is amen amen have you found your position do you know that teaching put you in your position and do you know that that's what the devil hates the most i hope each and every one is from their position like the pastor priest foreign he can say and on the seventh day in el dia septimo receptive god completed his work [Music] he blessed the seventh day of the year he sanctified the seventh day what does the word bless me to consecrate the consequences he said it is to keep and protect yes so he rested physically how did he rest and in whom did he rest he rested on his son because he was a god like moses was a god to the people that was his son he put all the trust on his son so he rested [Music] [Music] [Music] to the the fence around the garden and put no trespassing it was going to be a one day or a thousand years of rest but [Music] genesis and revelation are my favorite books and i've explained this about about there was not a man to till the soil until yesterday that the lord told me something that i had missed there was not a man to kill the soil and put the man whom he had formed and also in genesis 2 dominic genesis god took the man and put him in the garden illo poso before he made the garden or planted the garden it says there was not a man to kill the soil but if you go with them he says the god put the man in the girl not to kill but to countervail because therefore the lord god sent him forth from the being to till the ground when he was taken since adam was going to be the god eva why would he have to do manual work to tilt the lab he didn't until until he was thrown out from the garden of eden foreign [Music] hebrews 4 5 and 6. and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest therefore he remained the psalmist into the ring and they to whom it was first priest intern not because of unbelief it would be impossible for either to be correct [Music] because if it was so there would be many of these seven days and many first days so then if saturday and sunday are not the lord's not in the time of john no era en el tiempo de juan he went in the spirit to the lord's day in the spirit because this is the day of men because paul was picked up and got into the spirit of the sabbath the word transmit going from one place to another he said i don't believe he was taken like paul up into the third heaven pablo uh his ideas call was speaking of being judged by men in that day let a man saw account of us as of the ministers of christ and stewards of the mysteries of god moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful but with me it is a very small thing that i should be judged of you or of men's judgment by myself yet am i not hereby justified but he that judges me is the lord yes therefore just nothing before the time until the lord come who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the councils of the hearts and theirs tell every man have praise of god on paul was speaking of being judged by men in man's day pablo a time when men's work is glorified they spend billions and billions of dollars to go to the moon [Music] a wasted effort oh so man's day is glorified by knowledge which came by satan so in 1960 father said this in the mount of banham but the day of the lord is coming when these kingdoms become the kingdoms of our lord in his christ remember the scripture is compounded i may it can never get old i can still fulfill my commission siempre apollo completed my commission and made arrows to yoga young ministers he said last pledge us by are we in the day of the lord estamos en el dia del senor i thought we were in the day of man in 1960 he said that there the lord is coming is it coming or did it already come i john who also have your brother and companion in tribulation in the in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the isle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ i was in the spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me a great voice s of a trumpet did he what remember he went in the of the like a trumpet in the day of man or in the day of the lord something important is at hand [Music] without faith she said you're hearing the gospel trumpet tonight you come sunday morning and you hear the gospel something against more than ever you should get closer to god each the word of prophecy and i turned to see the voice that stayed with me and being turned i saw seven golden candle sticks in my body to hear the voice to insist to see the voice who is the voice and the person and in the midst of seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man close with a garment down to the food and gird above the pep with a golden girdles his head and his hairs were white like wool as quiet as snow and his eyes were as the flame of fire daniel 7 13 i saw in the night vision and behold again one like the solomon came with the clouds of heaven and came to the ancient of days and they brought him near before him you see daniel was saying the same thing that john saw daniel which was the office of the lord jesus christ one of the him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people nations and languages to serve him his dominion his everlasting dominion we shall no not pass away and his kingdom that we shall not be destroyed [Music] is is that happened since genesis 1 and god bless them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion go ahead and that are you in the day of man or that day you said my brother said that we were in the day of man he said that in aren't we the royal seed of abraham [Music] we crown him lord of lord and king of kings doesn't a king have a throne the thrones were cast down and the engine of death did seat whose garment was quite snow and the hair of his head like the pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame and [Music] to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne so as christ is the throne ruler of this time say that again christ is the throne ruler at [Music] in ignorance and ignorance when we were in denominations in a denomination we always say we were in the day of men they said we didn't understand beings about the day of the lord but in february 28 first 1963 4 16 prime minister sanchez cuatro decision for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout out that's all i want right now the lord himself and senior mismo shall descend i went in the day of the lord and i heard a voice the lord himself shall descend with the gospel trumpet seniority we were in the day yeah but when that gospel voice came he came down and said come out of her my people [Music] i'm ashamed on my first birth cause this body is gonna stay here but when he says come out of here and the only way we could receive [Music] then jimmy would you know and then he would get tired but we got our pastor to finish [Music] every culture [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] jimmy will you dismiss them with the word of prayer lord jesus we just thank you tonight for this great great privilege to be together lord and just to hear words lord of life your servant lord what i call my professor lord i just thank you for him lord and pray that you continue to give him strength give us all strength now and protect us may your angels encamp around about us as we go to our homes until we come back and meet again on sunday yes we commend ourselves to you in the precious name of our lord and savior jesus christ amen amen god bless you god you
