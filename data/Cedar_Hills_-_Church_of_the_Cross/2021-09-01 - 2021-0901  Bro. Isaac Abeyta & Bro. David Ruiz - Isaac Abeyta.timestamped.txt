[36:10] of course think thank the lord for the
[36:12] visitation to
[36:14] our pastor
[36:20] and for
[36:21] or like i always say not something i say
[36:24] but we what we've been taught
[36:31] that things don't happen by coincidence
[36:36] but by visitation
[36:49] before i get started i gotta i got a few
[36:51] sets of
[36:54] [Music]
[37:05] yes
[37:07] all right well this
[37:09] this uh
[37:13] this august that just passed
[37:19] it was uh
[37:21] my wife and your anniversary
[37:26] and i'd just like to thank her for for
[37:29] standing with me
[37:33] i put her through a
[37:48] i just uh i got her a new ring in it
[37:52] and it didn't fit her so we gotta get it
[37:54] sized
[37:58] but uh can we give them to my wife
[38:02] [Applause]
[38:17] like we've always been taught that glory
[38:19] and honor always goes to the lord jesus
[38:20] christ
[38:25] but also also this summer
[38:29] it marks 19 years since me and my family
[38:32] have lived here in los angeles
[38:38] a lot a lot of rough times
[38:41] at a good time
[38:44] but as our prophet has taught us
[38:48] some through the waters
[38:50] some to the waters
[38:52] [Music]
[38:54] some to the floods
[38:57] some through deep trials
[39:03] but all through the blood
[39:06] and i'd just like to thank him and his
[39:08] his family for
[39:09] being such a great friend
[39:19] he saved me from a lot of
[39:21] a lot of people
[39:28] i met a lot of ministers a lot of
[39:30] pastors in my years
[39:35] not just because he's our pastor but
[39:37] i've never met a pastor like
[39:45] as he's always taught us and i've always
[39:46] taught my family that we don't take a
[39:48] step unless we feel light of the holy
[39:49] spirit
[40:11] [Music]
[40:26] [Music]
[40:48] so
[40:49] we are the same age
[40:53] we were born in the same year
[40:56] in the same month
[40:58] i think the only difference is one of us
[41:00] was born in the evening and one of us in
[41:01] the morning
[41:03] [Music]
[41:14] he's a little bit taller than i am
[41:18] and he's a little bit better looking
[41:22] but that's uh that's brother brother
[41:24] hammy really abraham
[41:26] is
[41:36] he already told you how old we are the
[41:37] other day so i don't think i got it
[41:39] [Music]
[41:41] how young we are okay
[41:44] it's almost
[41:45] but uh
[42:00] you know where the
[42:02] [Music]
[42:11] man
[42:13] [Applause]
[42:22] uh
[42:23] your time don't start right
[42:25] [Music]
[42:34] let's turn in our scriptures to james
[42:36] chapter one
[42:39] starting with the 22nd verse
[42:58] but be ye doers of the word
[43:03] and not ears only
[43:07] deceiving your own selves
[43:23] he is like a man beholding his natural
[43:25] face in a glass
[43:28] break
[43:28] [Music]
[43:32] or he behold it himself
[43:37] and go with his
[43:38] way and straightway forgetteth what
[43:42] manner of man he was illegal
[43:46] amendment may the lord have the blessing
[43:48] to be in your word and you you may be
[43:50] seated
[43:51] [Music]
[44:06] is
[44:08] because it uh it belonged to our
[44:10] founding pastor
[44:13] and when i see our founding pastor
[44:15] preach with it
[44:18] i mean
[44:20] i love blue i mean i don't know if you
[44:22] can tell
[44:23] no
[44:25] brother he told me pick anyone
[44:34] thank you brother
[44:39] who's
[44:40] who's been seeing these these little
[44:42] little creatures
[44:44] migrating or investing whatever you want
[44:46] to call who's been seeing it we're wrong
[44:59] do you have a message going on
[45:02] because if you do i'm not going
[45:08] he gave me the green light okay for
[45:10] those who didn't see
[45:11] put up that first picture
[45:19] those are them and i mean i'm talking by
[45:21] the hundreds
[45:26] and
[45:27] when
[45:29] i know i noticed them after children's
[45:31] first
[45:32] on sunday
[45:37] we took the back road through through by
[45:39] eight mountain
[45:41] camino
[45:42] [Music]
[45:43] i i started to i think i was the only
[45:45] car that was dodging him
[45:49] and i i told i told the family i said we
[45:52] gotta pull over
[45:55] i said we gotta check this out
[45:58] then all
[46:06] [Music]
[46:08] and then a car would come in and the
[46:10] kids would start screaming and say no no
[46:23] [Music]
[46:26] they were going for their lives
[46:29] and a car would come and they'd roll up
[46:31] into a little ball
[46:34] and roll and then keep going
[46:39] and then i heard the lord tell me
[46:43] the journey's got to be completed on
[46:46] its own
[46:52] they gotta do it on their own
[46:56] uh so we we left and me and my wife
[46:58] begin to talk about it
[47:03] and then
[47:04] we started talking about how brother
[47:06] branham would go into nature a lot
[47:16] and then she looked at me and she said
[47:18] man you could preach a message
[47:22] i just kind of looked at her and i was
[47:23] like
[47:25] yeah see
[47:27] so
[47:28] i uh
[47:30] i left it alone and i thought it brother
[47:31] will i really will
[47:33] that's that's his wheelhouse
[47:50] and as
[48:33] and then uh they they transform they
[48:34] don't transform into a butterfly they
[48:36] transform into a bot
[48:38] no no
[48:39] no
[48:41] you know
[48:42] but that that just ain't any moth it's
[48:44] it's it's called the hummingbird park
[48:48] the german is the hummingbird or or the
[48:51] hawkman
[48:52] and then you don't need uh
[48:54] you don't need your clothes in your
[48:55] closet
[48:58] nectar
[49:03] so
[49:05] me and uh and my wife go get some ice
[49:07] cream
[49:11] and we look out the window at these
[49:12] these powers
[49:30] but
[49:32] the last known of of this this i'll just
[49:35] give you a little backstory this this
[49:36] migration or this infestation whatever
[49:38] you want to call it
[49:42] conditions
[49:55] and you might not see him again for
[49:57] another 20 or 30 years
[50:01] i should say it happens only once every
[50:04] 20 to 30 years
[50:08] and the last last time this happened was
[50:10] about 15 to 20 years ago
[50:15] and then it took me to a flower that's
[50:17] called the oregon mountain bros
[50:21] [Music]
[50:26] now there's a lot of prim roses but
[50:27] there is only one oregon mountain
[50:33] that that specific one only grows in the
[50:35] oregon mountains yes
[50:41] and the one
[50:43] that pollinates it the most
[50:47] is the hummingbird mall it says the
[50:50] hummingbird
[50:51] and as i began to see these caterpillars
[50:59] it was something amazing to see
[51:04] you know
[51:05] nature has a sense that god put in it
[51:08] [Music]
[51:11] and they don't waver on it
[51:13] they don't waver on it
[51:16] but they trust the instinct
[51:20] and regardless of what things happen
[51:25] they have they have one mission
[51:28] get to the destination
[51:34] even if it costs them their life
[51:38] they're going to do whatever it takes to
[51:40] get there
[51:40] [Music]
[51:43] and their mission is to get
[51:46] to the
[51:47] to the softest the most fertile ground
[51:49] that they can find
[51:58] now it may seem a little insignificant
[52:01] this is
[52:10] but i've seen some caterpillars
[52:13] go with everything they had i mean with
[52:14] everything they had
[52:24] i've seen some that went
[52:26] and they they were on their journey and
[52:28] they gave up
[52:32] and they were just
[52:33] rolled up in a little ball
[52:37] and i mean they tried and they tried and
[52:39] they tried it
[52:42] and they gave up
[52:59] but you know what happens
[53:11] when they got their wings they became
[53:13] life-giving
[53:17] and they go pollinate the primrose ivan
[53:24] being a true genuine christian
[53:26] christian it means to be contagious
[53:31] it means to be contagious
[53:34] [Music]
[53:36] being contagious means to spread life
[53:39] from one to the other
[53:50] for you to give life
[54:08] when they were getting to the
[54:09] destination they didn't help each other
[54:13] but whoever taught us to leave your
[54:14] brother in the dark
[54:19] who taught us to to kick your brother to
[54:22] the curb
[54:24] [Music]
[54:36] i want to show you
[54:39] what it's like when you're when you are
[54:42] a influence killer
[54:43] understood
[55:22] do you know this this mo only lives from
[55:25] about 10 to 30 days
[55:30] that's its lifespan
[55:39] [Music]
[55:46] what
[55:58] but you cannot get to the destination
[56:10] yes sir
[56:14] it's an
[56:23] [Music]
[57:09] giving up i don't know how to do that
[57:16] as a true christian you're only supposed
[57:18] to do what you're taught
[57:23] we are supposed to be life-givers
[57:27] no you know what you're supposed to do
[57:29] when he's when he can't make it
[57:34] put your hands on his back
[57:38] get behind
[57:48] [Music]
[57:52] but if i want him to get to that place
[57:56] i've got to be the one that pulls
[58:00] get behind your brother
[58:02] i've got to be the one that pulls he's
[58:03] not going to be the one that pushes yeah
[58:11] you can't be afraid to get yourself lost
[58:13] to go out and find the one that's lost
[58:18] you've got yours
[58:19] yourself so that he can increase
[58:25] [Music]
[58:30] so if you
[58:32] are the one that ain't afraid you're the
[58:34] one that gets back here to push you're
[58:36] the one that gets back here
[58:41] because that sets this
[58:43] this train in a perpetual motion meaning
[58:45] that it's a motion
[58:47] that can that won't stop
[59:00] thank you guys
[59:02] [Applause]
[59:08] it reminds me of an african proverb
[59:13] that i that i once heard
[59:58] you got to rely learn to rely on each
[1:00:01] other
[1:00:04] because that's really the only way
[1:00:06] you're going to make it
[1:00:09] i remember as a young person
[1:00:12] the pastor i was i was about
[1:00:16] about your age about a sophomore in high
[1:00:19] school
[1:00:20] in high school
[1:00:22] and he preached a message on a wednesday
[1:00:35] [Music]
[1:00:51] i was on a wednesday thursday morning i
[1:00:53] go to school
[1:00:57] and if anybody remembers how i used to
[1:00:59] dress back then you you understand
[1:01:05] and i went to make sure i was and i have
[1:01:07] nothing on my face and you
[1:01:12] [Music]
[1:01:41] i had on a shirt
[1:01:43] that was large or extra large
[1:01:50] wasn't my size
[1:01:52] i had on ants that were
[1:01:54] about two three times my size
[1:01:57] [Music]
[1:01:59] that was the baggy era
[1:02:03] that was the baggy era back then
[1:02:05] [Music]
[1:02:15] [Music]
[1:02:23] [Music]
[1:02:42] [Music]
[1:02:46] it is the living christ inside of you
[1:02:52] and he's looking through your eyes
[1:02:56] and he's looking at his own reflection
[1:02:59] so do you see christ when you look in
[1:03:01] the mirror
[1:03:04] that changed my life forever
[1:03:10] what they do
[1:03:12] guessing
[1:03:14] by having a taste and knowing it's the
[1:03:16] truth
[1:03:19] and then turn around and deny it
[1:03:26] you might say well i go to church
[1:03:41] that's what this whole nation has done
[1:03:44] that's what the churches have done
[1:03:47] they've turned it down and they
[1:03:49] crucified the message
[1:03:51] [Music]
[1:03:55] they cast him out because they had no
[1:03:57] use for him
[1:04:00] and by my life
[1:04:07] [Music]
[1:04:09] i claimed to be something that i wasn't
[1:04:25] even though i was in church every
[1:04:27] service
[1:04:29] i knew the message
[1:04:32] and yet i didn't know the message
[1:04:35] because it was not yet revealed to me
[1:04:49] but it wasn't revealed to me who he was
[1:05:06] when you made that step to become a
[1:05:08] christian
[1:05:11] christian it comes with a responsibility
[1:05:16] it's not just all my life changed
[1:05:30] [Music]
[1:05:54] [Music]
[1:06:00] [Music]
[1:06:28] but now you don't got an excuse
[1:06:44] but understand this
[1:06:46] it comes with a responsibility
[1:06:50] if the lord puts somebody in your path
[1:06:57] you're accountable who
[1:07:03] now there was a time
[1:07:04] when
[1:07:08] tiempo when a friend of mine from high
[1:07:11] school came to get a haircut
[1:07:13] [Music]
[1:07:27] and she
[1:07:29] he was down he said
[1:07:31] the baby is going to be born without an
[1:07:32] arm
[1:07:37] and my first thought was
[1:07:39] let's get a handkerchief and we'll pray
[1:07:40] for it and i believe that that baby will
[1:07:43] receive it
[1:07:49] but then i said
[1:07:50] what if it don't take place
[1:07:58] [Music]
[1:08:09] and i within myself i went back and
[1:08:11] forth back and forth
[1:08:13] [Music]
[1:08:15] long story short
[1:08:18] i didn't i didn't do what i felt
[1:08:34] until i see a little boy walk into the
[1:08:36] shop
[1:08:39] [Music]
[1:08:50] across
[1:08:56] [Music]
[1:09:04] if the lord puts somebody
[1:09:06] in your path
[1:09:10] he'll never call you to do something
[1:09:11] without equipping you
[1:09:16] the lord comes to solomon yes
[1:09:32] but he
[1:09:38] and he said lord give me a hearing heart
[1:09:43] that i may be able to discern the good
[1:09:45] from the bad
[1:09:50] [Music]
[1:09:56] you didn't ask for all these things
[1:10:31] [Music]
[1:10:42] we all know the story
[1:10:47] of when brother branham was was
[1:10:48] baptizing the in the ohio river
[1:10:50] [Music]
[1:10:52] ohio the reason i love this message so
[1:10:54] much
[1:10:58] because of all the visions not because
[1:10:59] of all the miracles
[1:11:02] but because it's scriptural
[1:11:05] it's 100 scriptures
[1:11:24] and
[1:11:25] it came three times look up
[1:11:28] i was scared to look up
[1:11:32] when he did that's when you know the
[1:11:34] story that some had different different
[1:11:36] according to the life story there was
[1:11:37] close to about 10 000 people on the
[1:11:39] banks
[1:11:43] i was just a boy i was scared
[1:11:48] some heard a thunder some heard a voice
[1:11:53] somehow have different experiences
[1:11:58] and then the clergy asks what does this
[1:12:00] mean brother
[1:12:03] he says this thing
[1:12:05] this didn't come for me
[1:12:26] that was the message to forerun the
[1:12:28] coming the second coming absolutely
[1:12:33] but when the message put on flesh
[1:12:37] we become the forerunner
[1:12:41] similar similar thing happened in the
[1:12:42] scriptures
[1:12:45] jesus is speaking here he's saying
[1:12:47] father glorify thy name and make
[1:12:52] [Music]
[1:13:02] and the people that stood there stood by
[1:13:04] there
[1:13:06] some heard and said it thundered
[1:13:09] an angel speaking
[1:13:11] orlando it was it was the same
[1:13:12] experience that people had
[1:13:14] experienced
[1:13:16] but jesus said
[1:13:18] this voice came not because of me
[1:13:22] for your sakes
[1:13:27] so you know you would know that i'm
[1:13:28] telling you the truth
[1:13:55] [Music]
[1:13:57] to spread life from one to the other
[1:14:01] [Applause]
[1:14:09] hey man can you hear me
[1:14:18] thank you brother isaac for that if we
[1:14:19] give him a round of applause as we stand
[1:14:21] to our feet
[1:14:24] let's go straight into the scripture
[1:14:27] proverbs 3 5.
[1:14:34] and can you all hear the interpreter as
[1:14:36] well
[1:14:40] hey amen is it up there
[1:14:43] glory
[1:14:45] proverbs 3 5 reason this matter trust in
[1:14:47] the lord
[1:14:50] stop there
[1:14:52] probe
[1:15:14] very similar to brother isaac i had
[1:15:16] something different
[1:15:17] that i
[1:15:19] thought i would come up with
[1:15:24] initially the title was going to be i
[1:15:26] hit a rock or a rock hit me
[1:15:29] uh
[1:15:33] for those who can see it's still on my
[1:15:35] ipad i'm not lying
[1:15:40] but then the next part of that title was
[1:15:41] going to be but the rock
[1:15:43] caught me
[1:15:46] la piedra
[1:15:49] not a rock caught me no um
[1:16:15] how is it that my knee feels better
[1:16:17] today than it did 71 days ago when i had
[1:16:20] my accident
[1:16:25] i can't tell you why
[1:16:29] and and because of this it
[1:16:32] the title that i initially had right the
[1:16:34] rock
[1:16:35] it drew me to look for a message that
[1:16:37] had the rock in it
[1:16:45] and on february 24th of 1955 brother
[1:16:47] brandon preached the message entitled
[1:16:49] water from the rock
[1:16:56] and then there paragraph three he says
[1:16:58] this part
[1:17:01] i saw adam leave the garden of eden
[1:17:04] willfully
[1:17:05] because
[1:17:06] dot dot dot
[1:17:08] mi de again
[1:17:17] and it stopped me because i had already
[1:17:18] listened to the tape one two three times
[1:17:20] already
[1:17:24] but he pauses
[1:17:27] adam i saw adam leave the garden of eden
[1:17:31] wilfully
[1:17:36] because
[1:17:38] he went out because he loved his wife
[1:17:50] the very next sentence reads
[1:17:52] i seen jesus come out and go out with
[1:17:55] fully he said you'll be a jesusa
[1:18:12] we hear that the lord did bless and fill
[1:18:16] with the holy spirit and save the lost
[1:18:18] eske
[1:18:22] santos
[1:18:26] after all that's the main thing we're
[1:18:28] here for
[1:18:32] now speaking with brother noah up top
[1:18:38] we kind of talked about proverbs 3 5.
[1:18:43] and if they could put it back up there
[1:18:45] please
[1:18:47] as you can see it says trust in the lord
[1:18:48] with all thine heart
[1:19:03] i i literally looked up what to lean on
[1:19:05] means
[1:19:10] and it literally means trust significa
[1:19:13] so trust in the lord with all thine
[1:19:15] heart and trust not in thine own
[1:19:17] understanding
[1:19:24] [Music]
[1:19:27] for those who have gone to school
[1:19:28] there's this awesome thing called the
[1:19:29] dictionary
[1:19:33] you can find it on your phone
[1:19:47] the definitions from
[1:19:49] merriam webster one of the definitions
[1:19:51] of medium webster
[1:19:54] is a mental grasp
[1:19:59] a comprehension
[1:20:02] and understanding comes from the root
[1:20:03] word understand
[1:20:09] understand means again from the
[1:20:11] dictionary means to interpret in one of
[1:20:14] a number of possible ways intended
[1:20:20] [Music]
[1:20:29] and depending on the life you've lived
[1:20:39] how you feel
[1:20:41] you'll understand it one way uh
[1:20:56] [Music]
[1:20:59] and the way you understand it maybe is a
[1:21:02] million miles away from what i meant
[1:21:11] is the scripture still up there
[1:21:27] and i've always had this
[1:21:29] mental conception
[1:21:33] that we don't trust
[1:21:35] with our heart
[1:21:36] [Music]
[1:21:39] we trust with her with her head with her
[1:21:41] mind
[1:21:44] that's what i've always thought is
[1:21:46] because that's where the decisions are
[1:21:48] made
[1:21:49] on the vienna
[1:21:50] where my understanding comes from
[1:21:53] comes from my
[1:21:54] mind but the scriptures are perfect
[1:21:59] from a to z
[1:22:02] and if we go into the greatest battle
[1:22:03] ever fought preached in 1962 on march
[1:22:05] 11th
[1:22:21] when this great battle started on earth
[1:22:27] there had to be a mutual meeting place
[1:22:33] there had to be a place selected for the
[1:22:36] battle to begin
[1:23:05] begin and that is because that decisions
[1:23:08] are made from the mind the head
[1:23:12] is decisions
[1:23:17] because the battlegrounds where you've
[1:23:19] got to meet your enemy is in the mind
[1:23:27] you've got to make your choice
[1:23:32] and i never realized this till i copied
[1:23:35] it into my tablet
[1:23:38] the very next sentence is
[1:23:42] it
[1:23:45] meets
[1:23:46] you
[1:23:51] and from there we're gonna go to first
[1:23:52] john
[1:23:54] chapter four verses one through three
[1:23:56] primera de juan capitulo quatro versus
[1:23:59] remember the battle is in the mind okay
[1:24:04] [Music]
[1:24:14] [Music]
[1:24:19] and every spirit that confesseth not
[1:24:22] that jesus christ is come in the flesh
[1:24:24] is not of god
[1:24:38] how on earth are you supposed to trust
[1:24:40] in the lord
[1:24:56] and you
[1:25:08] but you have to make your
[1:25:57] now
[1:25:58] in that same message lean not unto your
[1:26:00] until that unto thy own understanding
[1:26:02] preached in 1965 brother branham says
[1:26:04] this and they say was saying it yeah
[1:26:30] the word of god
[1:26:32] is not altogether true la palabras
[1:26:47] i don't know about you but but when i
[1:26:49] heard him say it when i read it it don't
[1:26:51] sit well with me
[1:26:56] how can part of something that has holy
[1:26:59] in the title
[1:27:15] praise god that brother brown doesn't
[1:27:32] now brother brown then follows up with
[1:27:33] this how can you have faith in the bible
[1:27:41] if part of it is inspired and a part of
[1:27:44] it it's not
[1:27:46] no
[1:27:49] if one
[1:27:50] see you
[1:27:51] if one quotation is wrong
[1:27:56] then the whole thing might be wrong
[1:28:00] and it's all got to be right exactly
[1:28:03] right
[1:28:05] [Music]
[1:28:08] luke 24
[1:28:09] 25 through 27.
[1:28:12] and i
[1:28:19] and it reads in this manner then he said
[1:28:21] unto them all fools
[1:28:24] and slow of heart to believe all that
[1:28:26] the prophets have spoken entonces
[1:28:34] ought not christ who have suffered these
[1:28:36] things and to enter into his glory
[1:28:39] necessarily
[1:28:44] and beginning at moses and all
[1:28:47] the prophets
[1:28:52] he expounded unto them in all the
[1:28:54] scriptures the things concerning
[1:28:56] himself
[1:29:02] i love that verse 27
[1:29:05] beginning at moses
[1:29:08] and
[1:29:22] just the old testament prophets
[1:29:24] no old testament prophets only
[1:29:28] no
[1:29:28] no
[1:29:30] how about just the new testament
[1:29:32] prophets
[1:29:35] yes or no
[1:29:36] no no no no all the prophets
[1:29:39] prophet
[1:29:40] he expounded unto them in all the
[1:29:42] scriptures
[1:29:46] all the scriptures
[1:29:49] criticized the prophets
[1:30:00] now we're going to skip to 1965. brother
[1:30:02] brown preaches the message entitled if
[1:30:04] that's made clear by prophecy paragraph
[1:30:06] 14.
[1:30:12] now the bible is a different book
[1:30:15] from all other
[1:30:17] sacred books
[1:30:22] so right there you know it's in that
[1:30:25] category of a sacred book
[1:30:30] but there's more to it
[1:30:32] it's not
[1:30:44] a book of prophecy
[1:30:46] foretelling future events
[1:30:50] and it's also
[1:30:54] the revelation of jesus christ
[1:31:00] all the way from genesis
[1:31:04] to revelation apocalypses brings him out
[1:31:09] in his fullness in soup lenny tooth and
[1:31:12] what he was and is
[1:31:17] okay hold on so so luke 24 25 through 27
[1:31:21] oh flu falls of heart uh oh fools and
[1:31:23] slow of heart to believe all that the
[1:31:25] prophets have spoken
[1:31:30] 27 and beginning of moses and all the
[1:31:32] prophets he expounded unto them in all
[1:31:34] the scriptures the things concerning
[1:31:36] himself
[1:31:56] it's mine it's meal if it's yours it's
[1:31:59] yours yes you said that's your stead if
[1:32:01] it's not and you want it
[1:32:04] it's free
[1:32:07] whoa i'm sorry i don't mean to yell but
[1:32:09] i get excited
[1:32:12] the prophet that was sent to me
[1:32:15] tells me
[1:32:18] that from genesis
[1:32:20] to revelation
[1:32:23] it brings out
[1:32:26] in fullness and plenty to who jesus
[1:32:29] christ is
[1:32:31] jesus
[1:32:33] the new testament hadn't finished being
[1:32:35] written yet
[1:32:42] wow
[1:32:43] the new testament had not been finished
[1:32:46] written yet
[1:32:49] and yet he expounded to them
[1:32:54] beginning of moses and all the prophets
[1:32:58] all the scriptures
[1:33:01] the things concerning himself
[1:33:05] now continue reading and the whole
[1:33:07] complete book revelation one one two
[1:33:09] three said the book is a
[1:33:11] book of the revelation of jesus christ
[1:33:26] the revelation of jesus christ
[1:33:32] the word of god
[1:33:59] i'm serious look at your bible
[1:34:06] he's not coming back for a book
[1:34:10] libro
[1:34:12] he's not coming back for a book
[1:34:15] if he was coming back for a book
[1:34:19] why would we be here it's already
[1:34:20] written
[1:34:24] john 1 14.
[1:34:28] and the word was made flesh
[1:35:06] but when i see that title when yo velvet
[1:35:09] i think yo pienso and i trust he can
[1:35:12] feel
[1:35:26] the
[1:35:39] yes
[1:36:08] the lord is not slack concerning his
[1:36:12] promise
[1:36:16] how many have been given a promise
[1:36:20] how many have had to wait 1 2 5 10 15 20
[1:36:23] years for the promises
[1:36:28] does that change the fact that it's
[1:36:30] still promised to you
[1:36:34] no
[1:36:35] no no no no
[1:36:38] as some men count slackness
[1:36:46] but is
[1:36:48] long suffering to
[1:36:50] us words
[1:37:03] but that all should come to repentance
[1:37:28] because he is not willing that any of us
[1:37:30] should perish
[1:37:46] you know very very few people
[1:37:50] know
[1:37:51] my entire testimony
