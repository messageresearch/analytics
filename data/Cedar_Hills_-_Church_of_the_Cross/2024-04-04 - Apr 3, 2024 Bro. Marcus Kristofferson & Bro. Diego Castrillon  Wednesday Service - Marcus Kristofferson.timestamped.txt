[26:57] Sarah
[27:03] God bless you
[27:04] everybody I I got inspired with this
[27:07] poem on Saturday and I thought I was
[27:10] going to read it on
[27:14] Sunday and that didn't happen so here we
[27:18] are and uh honestly uh it's been a bit
[27:22] of a troubling
[27:26] week but not because it's been bad it's
[27:29] just there's been a lot of anxiety
[27:30] around
[27:33] me and today was especially
[27:37] bad and I almost didn't want to read
[27:39] this because of
[27:42] it but uh I'm going to read it and I
[27:45] think you'll see why the devil didn't
[27:46] want me
[27:49] to so anyway uh this poem is called
[27:55] rise and because of how long it is I'm
[27:58] just just going to read it in English to
[27:59] save
[28:01] time but if you'd like a Spanish copy
[28:04] just let me know and I'll I'll print you
[28:06] one and get you one in
[28:09] Spanish on that note here we
[28:14] go dark days are upon us the children of
[28:17] Darkness act as stakeholders of an earth
[28:19] to which they shall not fall air it is
[28:22] not theirs it is ours for the meek shall
[28:25] inherit it the new Earth cometh but who
[28:28] stands ready to claim it a great deal of
[28:31] evildoers have stood against the gospel
[28:34] some are more worldly than others and
[28:35] others are more religious than the world
[28:37] even the sun is shrouded in darkness as
[28:39] the time of the eclipse takes hold
[28:41] Behold a great Shadow crosses America
[28:44] and the country does not see it the
[28:46] heavens and earth are moving now more
[28:48] than ever who moves with them is it to
[28:51] the unknown neighbor that he should
[28:52] inherit the buck or should we desire the
[28:55] Lord like the heart that panteth after
[28:57] the waters wherefore is our Destiny or
[29:00] wherefore is our identity is it in
[29:02] Christ to the believer the answer is
[29:05] Swift but to others it remains unknown I
[29:08] have hope that the Believers will abound
[29:10] that Joy will fill their hearts as the
[29:12] light do fill the lantern for though the
[29:14] times are dark the Believers are bright
[29:18] if nothing else I say I have the light I
[29:20] will stand before the world of the
[29:21] wicked not alone but with he who has
[29:23] overcome it even still I see the body in
[29:26] him for when my eyes are opened I behold
[29:28] the Vindicated unveiled and there she is
[29:31] the bride beside me now she shouts the
[29:34] bridegroom cometh and he who has an ear
[29:37] hears the children of Darkness have been
[29:39] here many years but now the children of
[29:41] God have arrived we who have access to
[29:44] the fullness of the word and all the
[29:46] power of the Holy Ghost are acting
[29:48] representing our Lord and walking as
[29:50] Giants in a Land of demons who scatter
[29:52] when hearing our footsteps they hear the
[29:55] Eagles cry and flee hear the Lions Roar
[29:58] and tremble watch The Oxen work and
[30:01] sweat and when they look to see either
[30:02] of the three instead they see a man
[30:05] Jesus Christ walking within the Sons and
[30:07] Daughters of God how do we know this is
[30:10] true many are the spreaders of Lies the
[30:13] doers of misdeeds and the deliverers of
[30:15] deception under such circumstances can
[30:17] anyone be
[30:20] saved if it were not so he would have
[30:22] told us but instead he stated that the
[30:25] devil cannot deceive the elect for they
[30:27] hear the proven promised through the
[30:28] parable of the prophet and cannot be
[30:31] shaken what grounds does the enemy have
[30:33] to speak on what have they done besides
[30:36] lie they have not come close to the
[30:38] truth that is Jesus Christ he beat every
[30:40] one of them for he is the one above all
[30:43] who among them has come back from the
[30:45] beating who among them has risen from
[30:47] the dead only God has he is the only
[30:50] truth one way and one life provided by
[30:53] the perfect sacrifice that was and is
[30:56] and is to come Jesus Christ Christ when
[30:59] he was crucified there we were those who
[31:01] would believe it when he was placed in
[31:03] the Tomb we were put there with him when
[31:04] he conquered death we did too by this
[31:09] assurance we sing Oh death where is your
[31:11] sting grave where is your Victory he is
[31:14] risen and with this Faith this hope we
[31:17] know now is our time now we rise rise to
[31:22] the challenge of the adversary for what
[31:24] challenge is there in an adversary who
[31:25] is already defeated rise to higher
[31:28] places symbol of John for what do we
[31:30] have to hear to fear when the Eagle's
[31:32] Wings carry us rise to the occasion for
[31:36] what better occasion is there than the
[31:37] occasion of the coming Christ rise above
[31:40] the Waters of man for what Terror do the
[31:42] depths distribute when Christ has
[31:44] already walked them we are Overcomers of
[31:47] the world for Christ overcame it first
[31:49] when he overcame it there we were for
[31:51] though we are the last as the scriptures
[31:53] State we are also the first we are the
[31:56] predestinated bride though those who
[31:58] many seek but few shall find We Are The
[32:00] Chosen those who were called out of the
[32:02] world and made the Third Temple where he
[32:05] is delighted to dwell we have been given
[32:07] the power to take the inheritance given
[32:08] to us before the foundation of the world
[32:10] and that was unjustly stolen from us
[32:12] today yay though the Giants of Jericho
[32:15] gaw they have not met they have yet to
[32:18] meet you the real you the Holy Ghost
[32:21] filled you the properly and the properly
[32:24] and perfectly placed you the powerfully
[32:26] positioned you the one who was called

[32:32] you of this one they have not seen if
[32:36] you want the promise the blessing and
[32:37] the bride needed to bring the Rapture
[32:39] then the unveiling must begin now now we
[32:42] must act yet the cast asks how do we
[32:45] take action what of the gate the answer
[32:47] is do as our Lord did before us step by

[33:01] inheritance to be claimed so unto you my
[33:03] revelatory people I give you a word a
[33:06] word so simple yet so powerful by the
[33:08] Revelation that it could save millions

[33:12] what our Lord did that we must do in our
[33:14] day for the sake of those who are within
[33:17] and those who are without and that word

[46:23] you so may you add the blessing over the
[46:27] reading of your word

[46:40] seated you come with an expectation this
[46:44] morning are we happy this
[46:47] morning you know why we should be
[46:51] happy because we are in the house of the
[46:55] Lord and when you look around
[47:00] yourself you will see the people that
[47:03] you will spend eternity together
[47:07] with so that should make us
[47:11] rejoice and be
[47:14] happy and
[47:17] thankful and also
[47:18] [Music]
[47:20] humbled so
[47:24] once I want to thank Caleb for the
[47:29] confidence and also my pastor brother
[47:34] Morton for letting me come
[47:39] along and I'm so thankful for the
[47:42] hospitality you you all have
[47:47] shown brother Julian and sister
[47:52] Mara opening up their
[47:55] home I feel so sorry for
[47:59] them because I only sleep
[48:03] there and then I
[48:05] leave and then they are sleeping when
[48:08] I'm coming
[48:12] back so but we trust the Lord that he
[48:16] has a
[48:19] plan and I also want to greet from our
[48:23] little church in
[48:25] Norway they wanted to be here amongst
[48:30] us so if the Lord
[48:34] teres you will see them
[48:38] soon and I also got a text message last
[48:44] Sunday from The Interpreter that we use
[48:47] in
[48:49] Russia I have never met him in
[48:53] person but we used him in our church for
[48:56] nearly two
[48:59] years to
[49:01] interpret our sermons from English to
[49:05] Russian for the Ukraine families that
[49:07] was together with
[49:12] us so he is sending sending greetings to
[49:16] you
[49:18] all so somebody from Russia are sending
[49:23] their
[49:25] greetings
[49:34] the
[49:37] vision that was a unknown word to
[49:45] me I had never heard
[49:48] it so I didn't understand
[49:51] it but two years
[49:54] ago I came to lasus for the first
[49:59] time
[50:01] and I was up up at the
[50:05] office and talking to all the
[50:08] brothers and the service
[50:12] started and most of of the men left the
[50:19] room and while brother Caleb was
[50:23] supposed to
[50:25] leave
[50:27] he stopped in the
[50:31] door and he said if you want if your
[50:35] brothers want to stay
[50:39] stay so we
[50:42] stayed so it was my pastor brother
[50:46] Morton and my brother Jerry Gonzalez
[50:51] Jerry Gonzalez and brother Ronnie
[50:54] Gonzalez Ronnie Gonzalez
[50:58] and we sat at the table and talked
[51:02] together and then suddenly brother
[51:04] Ronnie he asked me the
[51:07] question where do you see yourself in
[51:10] the
[51:14] vision and at that
[51:17] moment I didn't catch what he
[51:21] asked because it was an unknown word for
[51:25] me
[51:28] but the picture has been
[51:32] developed and now I have catched that
[51:38] word so from from that
[51:41] moment it was a turning point in my
[51:45] life it became personal to
[51:51] me so when you ask yourself the
[51:55] question
[51:57] where do you see yourself in the
[52:01] vision is there a lot of Visions
[52:06] around or is it One
[52:10] Vision because we are we are a lot of
[52:16] people and it seems that everybody has
[52:20] their own
[52:23] vision and I had my own vision
[52:28] I'm an
[52:30] Explorer I like to climb to the top of
[52:32] the
[52:35] mountains to the very top
[52:38] peak to get R
[52:46] myis and then jump
[52:52] out and that was the vision I
[52:55] had to have the
[52:58] feeling of flying down the mountain
[53:05] side exploring the nature that God had
[53:11] created but you
[53:14] know if that had been continued to be my
[53:19] vision I wouldn't be here
[53:23] today so I understood that I need to
[53:26] find my position in that
[53:32] Vision because brother Ronnie he talked
[53:34] about a
[53:38] vision that I didn't
[53:40] understand but I knew that I need to
[53:44] live according to that
[53:48] Vision I need to get in line with that
[53:52] Vision so I started to
[53:55] search
[53:57] and you know you can't place
[54:03] yourself somebody has to recognize
[54:09] you and place
[54:12] you so three months after the experience
[54:16] at the
[54:19] office I was placed in an
[54:24] office and I had no
[54:28] clue and when I got
[54:31] placed I had still no
[54:35] clue what that
[54:37] meant but I
[54:40] knew I saw that something was true about
[54:46] it I saw a life in the brother that
[54:49] placed
[54:54] me so I could have continued in the
[54:58] vision I
[55:02] had and if you for some
[55:06] reason have your own
[55:09] Vision it can
[55:15] seem that you are walking together with
[55:19] the bride and your
[55:24] pastor but at one
[55:27] point you will
[55:30] recognize I don't have the same
[55:34] vision it can take one
[55:37] year 10
[55:39] years eight
[55:41] years we don't
[55:44] know but if you don't have the same
[55:47] vision at one
[55:51] point you will
[55:55] depart
[55:59] so like the woman woman with the blood
[56:04] issue we need to force our ourself into
[56:08] the
[56:11] vision it's PL placed a great commission
[56:14] for
[56:18] us to go out to all the world and preach
[56:23] the
[56:25] gospel
[56:26] to find that last
[56:31] soul and we need to force ourself into
[56:35] that
[56:38] Vision by
[56:40] force it doesn't come
[56:43] easy my walk was very
[56:46] hard my walk was very
[56:50] hard because I had to let go of a lot of
[56:55] things I even had to to leave a
[57:01] church my
[57:03] friends
[57:06] family it's
[57:08] hard but you
[57:10] know you have to force your
[57:17] way
[57:19] so when I came here the first
[57:24] time I was so
[57:28] skeptical you know brother Tommy Tommy
[57:31] he was standing here and he was singing
[57:33] and he had he had a nice time and he was
[57:39] shouting it was crazy to
[57:42] me I saw that man this is a crazy
[57:48] man and then his son brother
[57:53] Omar he ran up and he took the
[57:58] microphone and he was shouting even even
[58:03] higher and then the
[58:06] drums for me that was like a
[58:11] devil he was get going
[58:16] crazy and I was sitting
[58:18] there how can this be the Church of
[58:24] God but you know what
[58:27] I saw the love amongst the
[58:31] people and I knew something is is
[58:35] according to the
[58:39] word it is a love that are uniting the
[58:47] people so I told my dad my pastor about
[58:52] it and he said don't pay attention to
[58:56] the
[58:59] music listen to the
[59:02] preaching and then you'll
[59:05] see and
[59:07] now I'm so thankful for brother
[59:11] Tommy
[59:20] Tommy
[59:21] so you know why I was so
[59:25] skeptical
[59:26] because I used the wrong touch
[59:35] Stone I had a man's
[59:39] idea of how the music was supposed to
[59:44] be what instruments there was supposed
[59:47] to be in a
[59:49] church but
[59:51] then I took this
[59:55] Touchstone
[59:58] and I
[59:59] saw that this is according to the
[1:00:03] word because I saw the signs
[1:00:10] following and that was
[1:00:16] wonderful so
[1:00:18] now using
[1:00:20] this this book as my
[1:00:24] Touchstone I can look at the
[1:00:28] people and then I look at
[1:00:32] this and I
[1:00:34] know I'm at the right
[1:00:37] place so it doesn't matter if I'm in
[1:00:40] this
[1:00:42] church if I'm in
[1:00:45] po if I'm in
[1:00:48] Norway or
[1:00:51] anywhere if I can look at the
[1:00:54] people and I use this as my touch
[1:00:59] Stone I know I'm in the right
[1:01:10] place like we read in Joel
[1:01:15] 2:25 I will restore to you the years
[1:01:19] that the lus had
[1:01:23] eaten the canker worm
[1:01:26] and the
[1:01:27] caterpillar and the polymer
[1:01:30] form my great great Army which I sent
[1:01:34] among
[1:01:37] you and we know that this
[1:01:43] warm ate
[1:01:48] something ate
[1:01:52] something it took away the the the fruit
[1:01:57] the
[1:01:59] leaves the
[1:02:01] bark and it started to hit the
[1:02:08] roots but it it lays a promise
[1:02:13] here I will
[1:02:16] restore and what time are we living
[1:02:21] in is this the end
[1:02:24] time do we see the signs in the
[1:02:28] heavens we understand that so that means
[1:02:32] that this pertain to this
[1:02:36] age so when I came and I saw all of
[1:02:42] you I
[1:02:45] recognized something has been
[1:02:49] restored and I need
[1:02:54] it that is restored
[1:03:01] we live in the dispensation of the
[1:03:04] manifestation of the Sons and Daughters
[1:03:07] of
[1:03:10] God you believe
[1:03:13] that you really believe
[1:03:17] it make sure you really believe
[1:03:24] it that is Romans 8 verse
[1:03:31] 19
[1:03:33] because when Satan
[1:03:37] comes we start to
[1:03:40] doubt is this the time for the
[1:03:43] manifestation of of the Sons and
[1:03:45] Daughters of
[1:03:49] God Satan is still tormenting
[1:03:53] me he's giving me a hard time
[1:03:57] it's so hard to
[1:03:59] live he took this away from
[1:04:02] me I had to do
[1:04:05] this and it seems that I'm falling in
[1:04:09] sin every
[1:04:13] day isn't this supposed to be the
[1:04:16] manifestation the dispensation
[1:04:18] dispensation for the manifestation of
[1:04:20] the Sons and Daughters of
[1:04:24] God and and I'm still
[1:04:27] falling how can that
[1:04:30] be young
[1:04:32] people we all go through
[1:04:36] it
[1:04:38] everybody the pastor the
[1:04:41] ministers all of
[1:04:44] us and Satan he's using his gun at
[1:04:53] us and he has more bullets than ever
[1:04:59] before and the more he shoots at
[1:05:04] you the more you know that you got
[1:05:09] something that he is trying to
[1:05:14] hide because he's
[1:05:17] scared because he knows that this is the
[1:05:20] dispensation of the
[1:05:24] manifestation
[1:05:27] you know something
[1:05:30] revealed Satan ain't scared of
[1:05:34] that because that doesn't put anything
[1:05:37] in
[1:05:39] action but when you have the
[1:05:43] manifestation then Satan is
[1:05:50] scared so when Satan shoots at
[1:05:54] you and when Satan did shoot at
[1:06:00] me we are
[1:06:02] standing in front of a
[1:06:11] choice we have a lot of bullets in our
[1:06:19] body but the prophet
[1:06:21] Joel he
[1:06:23] promised I will res
[1:06:26] rest so we have a
[1:06:29] promise we
[1:06:31] know that I have these bullets in my
[1:06:35] body but I have a
[1:06:38] promise so whenever you
[1:06:41] doubt read
[1:06:43] Joel because the promise is for you and
[1:06:49] me so we're standing in front of that
[1:06:54] choice what
[1:06:56] to do with these
[1:06:59] bullets should we let them stay
[1:07:02] in in our
[1:07:05] body or should we take them
[1:07:09] out and throw them under the
[1:07:14] carpet what do you
[1:07:16] think throw them under the
[1:07:20] carpet then you're rid of
[1:07:24] them isn't that a good
[1:07:27] thing isn't that a good
[1:07:30] thing the bullets has
[1:07:35] disappeared or should we take those
[1:07:39] bullets up to Heavenly
[1:07:43] places take
[1:07:46] them to the offices that is placed in
[1:07:49] the
[1:07:52] church the gifts that is placed in the
[1:07:55] church
[1:07:57] and receive our
[1:08:01] healing and then still you have the
[1:08:05] bullets you have you have now received
[1:08:09] your
[1:08:11] healing but
[1:08:14] then use these
[1:08:16] bullets to torment the devil
[1:08:20] back to show
[1:08:22] him that we have a promise
[1:08:28] in this day the bride tree will be
[1:08:33] restored so
[1:08:36] devil your poor
[1:08:40] toolbox you won't trick
[1:08:45] me and I will show these
[1:08:48] bullets to every
[1:08:51] man on this
[1:08:53] Earth so they know
[1:08:56] that this
[1:08:57] bullets pertains to
[1:09:00] you and that will help the
[1:09:04] bride but if we throw them under the
[1:09:08] carpet Satan will
[1:09:12] continue and he did that to me for many
[1:09:17] years I went to the
[1:09:20] wter got prayed
[1:09:22] for took the
[1:09:24] bullets under the
[1:09:27] carpet and I was so
[1:09:30] happy and when I turned my back to the
[1:09:34] altar he shot me in the back without me
[1:09:40] noticing but
[1:09:42] now we have the
[1:09:45] promise this is the
[1:09:48] day when the evening light is
[1:09:53] shining so
[1:09:56] I'm not sure when I
[1:09:59] started but we'll
[1:10:04] see so my
[1:10:08] title is a true
[1:10:11] witness I will
[1:10:16] restore when we were in
[1:10:22] po brother Mark Chavis Mark
[1:10:26] Chavez he was preaching on
[1:10:29] this being a true
[1:10:34] witness and that was tremendous for
[1:10:38] me a true
[1:10:42] witness I
[1:10:45] realized that I have been telling people
[1:10:48] about this
[1:10:52] Bible oh it's written in Joel that is
[1:10:55] it's supposed to be a
[1:10:59] promise and the prophet for this age he
[1:11:02] did this and this and
[1:11:06] this SEC secondhand
[1:11:10] Revelation I wasn't a true
[1:11:16] witness but you
[1:11:18] know when I was up in that
[1:11:22] office I'm a true witness of what
[1:11:24] happened
[1:11:28] there because that changed my
[1:11:31] life and the restoration of the Bright
[1:11:34] Tree started for
[1:11:44] me and you
[1:11:46] know why God allow allows Satan to shoot
[1:11:51] at
[1:11:54] us he placed him here for a
[1:12:01] reason because the only
[1:12:05] way for the
[1:12:08] manifestation of God's
[1:12:13] attribut is to let him shoot at
[1:12:18] us so we can be
[1:12:23] wed and show
[1:12:26] and
[1:12:28] manifest God's
[1:12:32] attributes so it isn't anything wrong
[1:12:35] with
[1:12:37] you when he shoots at
[1:12:40] you and Satan is actually doing a big
[1:12:45] mistake because he shoots at
[1:12:47] you and then you
[1:12:51] manifest God's
[1:12:54] attributes
[1:12:56] and you
[1:12:57] know he regrets so
[1:13:01] hard that he was shooting at
[1:13:04] you but he will still
[1:13:07] try maybe this time it will
[1:13:12] work and you know to his to to God's
[1:13:17] people it will never
[1:13:21] work because this is the dispensation of
[1:13:24] the man man estation of the Sons and
[1:13:28] Daughters of
[1:13:31] God this is the
[1:13:35] dispensation that we will torment the
[1:13:41] devil remember that
[1:13:44] promise it's nothing wrong with
[1:13:47] you when he shoots at
[1:13:51] you because he is shooting at you for a
[1:13:54] reason
[1:13:57] and I think he doesn't understand the
[1:14:01] reason could because it only brings the
[1:14:05] manifestation of go God's
[1:14:10] attributes the restoration of the Bride
[1:14:15] free so when you look around you around
[1:14:19] you you see your brother and
[1:14:23] sister then you know
[1:14:26] that that promise is
[1:14:30] true because it
[1:14:33] happens Malachi 45 and
[1:14:39] 6 behold I will send you Elijah the
[1:14:46] prophet I will send
[1:14:51] you not somebody else I will send you
[1:14:59] the it's a specific message to
[1:15:05] you and that
[1:15:08] message needs to be
[1:15:12] manifest it's not enough that it it is
[1:15:15] revealed to
[1:15:18] you that you run
[1:15:21] around it's revealed to me I have it
[1:15:26] no it's not
[1:15:28] enough but when this can lay
[1:15:32] here and you can
[1:15:34] say
[1:15:36] Satan I
[1:15:39] know where your destiny
[1:15:43] is then it has become a
[1:15:48] life and you don't need to say anything
[1:15:50] to the people around
[1:15:53] you because they see the
[1:15:56] life in
[1:15:58] you so now you have received this
[1:16:03] Prophet the
[1:16:06] message a specific message for
[1:16:12] you and you know
[1:16:15] what why did I come to Las
[1:16:19] cruus I was
[1:16:22] reading behold I will send you Elijah
[1:16:25] the
[1:16:27] prophet oh that that is
[1:16:30] wonderful I don't need anything
[1:16:33] else I can just sit
[1:16:35] here I received the
[1:16:38] message it's so
[1:16:40] wonderful and I still can see the snowy
[1:16:45] mountains and I have my skis
[1:16:49] here and I have all
[1:16:53] possibilities no no
[1:16:55] I
[1:16:57] knew he also sent this message to
[1:17:00] somebody
[1:17:05] else and when I read this
[1:17:09] book and I have this book as my touch
[1:17:14] Stone I know that it is supposed to be a
[1:17:20] bride and I need to hear the message
[1:17:24] that the rest of the Bride has
[1:17:29] received because my
[1:17:32] part is not
[1:17:34] enough it's not enough for
[1:17:37] me in order for me to become a part of
[1:17:40] the
[1:17:42] Bride when I understood the word
[1:17:47] Vision I understood that
[1:17:51] this is a
[1:17:53] way that will will bring me
[1:18:02] somewhere so
[1:18:04] now I
[1:18:06] saw that this is
[1:18:09] really the day for the
[1:18:14] restoration but I still had a lot of
[1:18:19] questions because when I left the church
[1:18:21] I was
[1:18:23] in
[1:18:26] I started to study the
[1:18:29] message for
[1:18:33] real I'm working as a
[1:18:37] carpenter and I have my
[1:18:40] headphones and I'm able to listen to
[1:18:43] four or five sermons a
[1:18:47] day and I was
[1:18:49] listening and I was
[1:18:52] listening and I understood
[1:18:55] there is something
[1:18:57] more it must be something
[1:19:00] more this can't be
[1:19:07] it quote 183 from the third
[1:19:19] seal the bride the noia hasn't had a
[1:19:24] Revival
[1:19:25] [Music]
[1:19:27] yet see there's been no Revival
[1:19:33] there no manifestation of God to stir
[1:19:37] the bride
[1:19:40] yet see we're looking for it
[1:19:45] now it will take those seven unknown
[1:19:48] Thunders back
[1:19:53] there to make her up
[1:19:57] again see
[1:20:00] yeah he will send
[1:20:02] it he promised it now
[1:20:06] watch okay okay I'll sit
[1:20:10] down I'm
[1:20:14] watching can I see
[1:20:16] it it's supposed to
[1:20:19] come I will sit
[1:20:22] here and I will listen to more sermon
[1:20:28] but I
[1:20:30] understood this can't be
[1:20:33] it because we're living in the end
[1:20:37] time you
[1:20:40] know I had received the
[1:20:45] message and I heard about the
[1:20:49] future but I was looking for the
[1:20:53] path That was supposed to take
[1:20:57] me to the
[1:20:59] future I was
[1:21:01] looking and I was
[1:21:04] thinking I just had to
[1:21:07] wait something is
[1:21:09] coming maybe one day at
[1:21:12] work when I have listened to seven
[1:21:17] sermons The Heavens will
[1:21:21] open uh Shining Light will
[1:21:27] and tell
[1:21:28] me the Revival is
[1:21:32] on so I was walking and walking and
[1:21:37] walking nothing
[1:21:41] happened but
[1:21:45] then when I was
[1:21:49] placed in the body of
[1:21:53] Christ I started to
[1:21:56] realize the restoration is
[1:22:00] on oh something is
[1:22:05] happening I see great man of
[1:22:09] God they lay their hands on the
[1:22:13] sick and they
[1:22:18] recover I see great man of
[1:22:22] God that Grant
[1:22:25] people their
[1:22:29] needs you're praying for a
[1:22:34] child you will
[1:22:37] receive it's a
[1:22:40] promise and I can see
[1:22:42] it in a people and I
[1:22:48] understand the
[1:22:50] Revival must be here
[1:22:53] now
[1:22:56] but
[1:22:57] still I can't see in the
[1:23:01] message because in the third
[1:23:04] seal it says the bride hasn't had a
[1:23:07] Revival
[1:23:09] yet and I ask people
[1:23:13] around and they
[1:23:16] say something great will
[1:23:19] happen we're
[1:23:22] waiting everybody's standing
[1:23:25] we're waiting for
[1:23:28] something but I could see something
[1:23:33] happening something happening to a
[1:23:38] people quot
[1:23:40] 83 from recognizing your day and its
[1:23:48] message why do they do
[1:23:51] that why do they do that
[1:23:55] they want a Great
[1:23:57] Awakening they're
[1:24:00] crying believing that they will be an
[1:24:07] Awakening they're good
[1:24:09] people why is
[1:24:12] it what have they
[1:24:14] done they have not
[1:24:17] recognized The Awakening of the
[1:24:22] Bride see
[1:24:25] by being a
[1:24:27] Christian they feel they feel the pull
[1:24:30] of the
[1:24:31] hour but they haven't
[1:24:35] recognized what is being
[1:24:40] done that's what's making them feel that
[1:24:44] way they know something is supposed to
[1:24:49] happen but see they're
[1:24:52] looking for it
[1:24:56] way off in the
[1:24:59] future to
[1:25:01] come what is happened already happened
[1:25:05] right by
[1:25:14] you already happened right by
[1:25:20] you look to your
[1:25:23] neighbor it has happened right by
[1:25:27] you you see a
[1:25:29] people and it's

[1:25:40] shining the restoration of the
[1:25:44] gifts the
[1:25:46] manifestation of the Sons and Daughters
[1:25:49] of
[1:25:50] God it's no more time for revealing of
[1:25:55] the
[1:25:58] message it's the time for the
[1:26:00] manifestation of the
[1:26:03] message and it
[1:26:05] happens I'm a true
[1:26:08] witness and we see it we went to
[1:26:13] PO and the restoration of the Bride tree

[1:26:26] they have used the years to clean their
[1:26:31] dress but now they are
[1:26:36] restored you know
[1:26:38] why because of a
[1:26:42] vision we're

[1:26:58] God has been placed
[1:27:02] there for us to
[1:27:06] realize that the Revival is going
[1:27:10] on and why is he using the word
[1:27:16] Awakening because it will end with this
[1:27:22] revival it won't continue
[1:27:26] but if you're looking for the word
[1:27:28] Revival in the
[1:27:32] message you will end up with a
[1:27:36] quote that the bride hasn't had a
[1:27:39] Revival
[1:27:42] yet but now we are
[1:27:48] awake so brother and
[1:27:51] sister the Revival is going

[1:35:58] verse
[1:36:09] 25 the scripture says Mark
[1:36:17] 7:25 for a certain woman whose young
[1:36:20] daughter had an unclean Spirit heard of
[1:36:22] him and came and fell at his
[1:36:30] feet let us read the next verse 26 the
[1:36:33] woman was a Greek a serap phenician by

[1:36:37] would cast forth the devil out of her

[1:36:47] control we surrender ourselves to your
[1:36:50] presence we give you all honor and Glory
[1:36:54] you may be
[1:36:58] seated during this week I I told the
[1:37:02] Lord I said Lord put me to a
[1:37:07] side for these five minutes that is the
[1:37:09] desire of my
[1:37:11] heart if you see brother
[1:37:13] Diego brother Ronnie I I
[1:37:17] failed because my prayer
[1:37:20] brother is that I I I not stand here
[1:37:26] because I have nothing good to offer
[1:37:30] you and even though God made me a
[1:37:32] minister a preacher it is my
[1:37:36] duty it is my
[1:37:39] responsibility to have something to be
[1:37:42] able to
[1:37:44] offer because if I don't have
[1:37:47] anything to to
[1:37:49] offer and then I'm going to
[1:37:51] go then I I I go to the
[1:37:54] Fountain I go to the Fountain
[1:37:58] brother because he is the unexhausted
[1:38:01] Fountain and when he ministers to
[1:38:04] me then I can stand before
[1:38:07] you and to minister to the
[1:38:10] people that is the
[1:38:13] duty that every preacher every
[1:38:16] Minister can be able to take the
[1:38:19] word and not only speak it but to live
[1:38:23] it
[1:38:24] and to preach
[1:38:26] it if
[1:38:28] we if we are not
[1:38:30] capable to
[1:38:32] manifest that what we
[1:38:35] speak then don't come behind this
[1:38:38] P go to the
[1:38:44] Cross find yourself with
[1:38:46] him and everyone is going to
[1:38:50] say oh that wasn't the brother that was
[1:38:55] God the scripture
[1:38:58] says that a man
[1:39:00] came looking for
[1:39:05] Jesus because his disciples weren't able
[1:39:08] to cast out a
[1:39:10] demon now this man now
[1:39:13] watch this
[1:39:15] man he wasn't just any man he was a
[1:39:21] Jew he was a man that was under the
[1:39:25] promise he was a man that obeyed the
[1:39:29] law a
[1:39:32] man that was waiting for the presence of
[1:39:34] the
[1:39:35] Messiah now here is the Messiah Jesus
[1:39:40] God the fullness of God the
[1:39:44] Messiah is speaking to this
[1:39:47] man watch the
[1:39:49] words he
[1:39:52] says
[1:39:55] he he tells the
[1:39:59] father to him that
[1:40:01] believeth if you can
[1:40:05] believe to him that
[1:40:07] believeth all things are
[1:40:14] possible Jesus isn't
[1:40:17] saying for me all things are possible
[1:40:20] because for God there is nothing
[1:40:22] impossible
[1:40:24] he is telling
[1:40:25] him if thou can't believe it's not in me
[1:40:30] it's on
[1:40:31] you for you to believe for him that
[1:40:35] believeth all are
[1:40:37] possible so
[1:40:41] then now I'm going to take that
[1:40:44] promise now I'm going to take it out of
[1:40:46] context and I'm going to put it in
[1:40:50] another
[1:40:51] place a many
[1:40:55] so that you can
[1:40:57] understand and catch the
[1:40:59] Revelation the Bible
[1:41:01] says that there was a woman a
[1:41:05] cenan a Greek a
[1:41:10] woman that she did not have the the the
[1:41:12] the promise the right to the
[1:41:15] promise that woman that according to the
[1:41:18] law she was a
[1:41:20] curse she was evil because she oby the
[1:41:22] law
[1:41:24] evil to him that doesn't obey the law a
[1:41:29] woman that knew nothing about the
[1:41:31] Messiah a
[1:41:34] woman that according to the
[1:41:36] Jew that she was a
[1:41:39] dog that's what the Bible
[1:41:41] says now this
[1:41:44] woman we've heard it many
[1:41:46] times but I want you to catch it catch
[1:41:49] the
[1:41:50] inspiration that God has for you this
[1:41:52] evening
[1:41:54] now this woman
[1:41:56] comes and she be she she comes to
[1:41:59] Jesus she he says heal my daughter Jesus
[1:42:02] now
[1:42:05] Jesus he ignores
[1:42:08] her like if I like if I was
[1:42:11] there
[1:42:13] until until this
[1:42:15] woman when this
[1:42:18] woman she doesn't look to the answer of
[1:42:21] Jesus the Bible says
[1:42:24] that this
[1:42:25] woman she she falls out his she humbles
[1:42:29] herself she humbles in the feet of Jesus
[1:42:32] the Bible says that he who humbles
[1:42:35] himself shall be
[1:42:37] exalted but even
[1:42:39] though even though she is
[1:42:41] humble Jesus ignores her for the second
[1:42:46] time for the second time
[1:42:48] Jesus because the Bible says I I came
[1:42:54] to obey the law to fulfill the law and
[1:42:57] by the
[1:42:58] law she did not have the right to
[1:43:01] him when Jesus ignores
[1:43:05] her she says again
[1:43:08] Lord my daughter is
[1:43:11] tormented
[1:43:14] now now here is
