be moved water [Music] shall i shall not be moved just like a tree that's planted by the [Music] not wine moved hello so grateful to be here see all my friends i'm also so grateful that my pastor let me preach this afternoon so let's get started by turning your bibles to luke 3 21 and 22. say man when you have it okay now when all the people were baptized it came to pass that jesus also being baptized and praying the heaven was opened and the holy ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him and a voice came from heaven which said thou art my beloved son indeed i am well pleased may you please bow your heads lord we want to thank you today for letting us come this afternoon and thank you for letting us be here we're so grateful for you lord may not be me preaching lord but you in jesus name amen you may be seated so luke 3 21-22 says that jesus is getting baptized so god took the form of a dove to show and came down to show everyone that he was pleased with the son now you might be thinking a dove what makes a dove so special that god which is that to come down as is god he could have come down as anything most of us would probably come down as a dinosaur but god isn't like that so you might be thinking what makes a dub so special that god chose to be represented by that animal out of all out of all of his animals he created lucky for you i did my homework brother branham says that the dove not only represents god but a true christian how many of those do we have here good then you'll be able to relate with the dove a dove and a pigeon are in the same family a dove can find its way back home better than any other animal that's why they're used as messenger birds during gores one bird from england was taken all the way to africa and still found its way home it was a 55 day journey for the dove now does anybody know what the word meek means no no one humble nice and gentle well the dove is the meekest animal in all the heavens the dove is also the cleanest animal because he has oil inside of him so all the filth just comes right off how many want only one side of them amen that's the holy spirit now we can see in why in heaven a dev represents god on earth it's an eagle but in heaven is the meek dove i'm sure many of us are familiar with the story of noah's ark can anyone tell me how many windows were on ozark one there was one window on the ark kind of pointed straight up to heaven so during the flood they didn't have to worry because all they had to do was look up to god but this made it pretty hard for noah to know when dry land was out so he sends out a bird but he sends out the crow and the crow never comes back because the crow was feeding on dead carcasses and the dead carcasses represent resent resembled the denominations brother branham says that the crow represents a hypocrite because he can just eat dead carcasses all day and then go fly to eat wheat with the dove but the dove resembles a true christian the dove can't stomach all the junk most humans and animals have a gallbladder a gallbladder helps you digest all the junk we put in it in our body but doesn't but dove doesn't have one because it doesn't need one it only thing eats things that are clean and pure like god's word so when noah sons sends out the dove he comes back because there's nowhere to rest his feet so eventually now sends the dove out again this time the dove comes back with an olive branch which represents peace so no one knew they were close to being able to get off the ark after some time noah sends the der the dove out a third time and when the dub didn't come back he knew there was dry land but wait a minute why didn't the duff come back i thought the dove always finds its way home let's find out exactly where the dove went can you please turn our bibles to isaiah chapter 60 verse eight say amen when you have it who are these that fly out the cloud and as the doves to their windows so the third time the dove was done out he never came back because he went to the woods new to a cabin outside its window where brother branham was born and that's my prayer for each one of you that the whole that the heavenly dove would visit each and one of your windows god bless you okay i can do this i can do this oh no i can't do this there's a lot of people out there it's not just people it's little people you can do this bear just look over the curtain and speak what happened now there's little people in the front row you know how i get around the little ones bear of course there's little people we're at children's church remember oh i thought you said was this was a honey promotion bear you know god's word is sweeter than honey sweeter than honey let's do this all right on the count of three one two three bear oh i'm just kidding how's everybody doing today i can't hear you how's everybody doing today my name is mr bear and i'm so happy i'm happy my name is happy bear i know your

bear just beautiful well thank you happy so today we're going way back in time to learn of an ancient incredibly young king named king josiah raise your hands if you would like to learn about king josiah wow there's a whole lot of them i can't see them i don't got eyes well i can't either but i just assumed there was a lot of them i hope so well let's get this show on the road but first let's hear some words from our prophet to help set the scene wait happy what if someone out there in the audience doesn't know who our prophet is doesn't know well good point wait what if we ask someone in the audience to answer a few questions about the prophet well now don't you worry about that i went ahead and interviewed one of these little cubs a few hours ago wow bear you never cease to amaze me i sure don't audio gentlemen roll the tape sister daddy and today our mr bradley is going to answer [Music] is is [Music] is [Music] [Applause] that was amazing you all know who our prophet is now all right now let's hear a few words from our prophet [Music] [Applause] [Music] my my and that's my deepest desire of my heart is to live for jesus and i'm here today all because of love so with that we're going to introduce a very special story there once was a young boy named josiah he was probably like most boys his age except for one small difference josiah was the king of judah he was only eight years old but he was king josiah was a good boy who loved god and wanted to serve him but there were many people in josiah's country who didn't serve god there were people in the land who worshipped false gods and had forgotten how god had cared for the hebrew people they worshiped statues and idols instead of the lord they loved the things of the world instead of the things of god and they had forgotten how to keep god's laws and commandments josiah wanted his kingdom to trust in the lord so things had to change go tell all the high priests to get the money that has been brought into the house of god and use it to hire workers to rebuild the temple of the lord well you heard the man get to work narrator please so the people did as their king commanded and work began on the temple right away then something incredible happened well working on the temple they found the scroll of the law of moses it was god's word that had been missing for hundreds of years they immediately took the scroll to king josiah and read it to him you're not going to believe this what please don't tell me you're painting another selfie of yourself no even better while i was moving all the junk from under the closet i found this ancient scroll you don't think it's the law of moses well let's read it and take a look thou shall have no other gods before me thou shall not make any graven images hello open it come on happy thou shall not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for i the lord thy god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me yup we're doomed wow you mean that there's people who actually hate god well you see when people choose to disobey god and start worshiping other false gods like money fame music games we prove with our actions that we don't believe god i didn't know that my video games could be a god why sure a god is simply just an object of worship and anything you put before god the one true god is false that is why king josiah has commanded us to rebuild the house of the lord to destroy all the false idols of worship we must get this scroll to king josiah right away he needs to see this king josiah king josiah while we were cleaning out the house of the lord we came across this scroll yes your highness and we're sure it's the law of moses the law of mode this it can be read it read it yes your highness we must read it to you and it says don't worship fake gods respect god's name respect your parents don't kill people don't steal don't lie and don't be jealous i've heard enough go inquire of the lord for me concerning the words that are written yes sir in this scroll for great is the wrath that is poured out upon us because our fathers have not kept god's word go right away sir so the two men did as king josiah instructed they went to jerusalem and found the prophetess holda the two men told her everything that had taken place concerning the law of moses the prophetess told the two men that god was going to bring evil upon jerusalem and because of their disobedience to god's word all the curses written in the law of moses would be poured out and nobody would be able to stop them but she also told the men that the lord had heard the cries of king josiah people of judea i come to you this day with the change that needs to happen the law of moses has been found and truth is we are not living according to the ways of the one true god you all serve and worship these false idols made of material that do nothing for you we as a nation must turn away from these false idols i declare that it is time to tear down these idols rip them to the ground destroy them anything in your life that is not of god needs to be torn down yeah you there yeah yeah you uh destroy your idol and turn to the lord yeah yeah come on come on come on big guy do it do it yeah wow he's tough get him get him lorry hallelujah come on come on who else any takers who anyone yeah get them get him come on come on no one wants to destroy idols come on do not hear me destroy him in the name of the lord there you go there you go yeah hallelujah [Applause] glory wow do we still have a church left after that i almost tore down the church oh my gosh we have to rebuild the altar too yeah well i guess that's what i wanted and guess that's what i got you got what you asked for and because he was humble and acted upon god's word king josiah along with all those who followed him would not see the evil that would be brought upon jerusalem king josiah took out all the abominations out of all of the countries that belonged to israel god promised to protect them and give them peace all the days of their lives josiah gathered all his people and made a covenant before the lord and promised to always keep his commandments wow can we give one to the lord did all you kiddies enjoy that lord you know i sure enjoyed that it sure is amazing how king josiah did so much for the lord at such a young age he was only eight years old when he became king you know what that means what does that mean it means you're never too little to give your life to god no matter how evil and scary the world looks today god can use you to turn everything around for his glory yes sir all you got to do is tear down those idols in your life and put god first how many love him amen it's been a pleasure being with you today and i just pray that you continue serving the one true god his name is the lord jesus christ god bless you god bless you [Applause] let's give a handclap to
