[31:44] [Music]
[32:01] [Applause]
[32:15] amen god god bless
[32:17] amen
[32:18] all right
[32:21] his word that's what we have
[32:23] to look forward to
[32:40] it is safe to
[32:55] the bible says in the book of saint john
[32:57] the first chapter in the first verse san
[32:59] juan capitol verso uno and uh we want to
[33:02] appreciate all the panelists that have
[33:05] that have voiced the word of god up here
[33:07] in this behind this desk
[33:19] what a fine job that that they were did
[33:21] with brother abe
[33:22] brother benjamin
[33:28] brother jimmy they should be illegal in
[33:30] all 50 states
[33:36] that's just such a tremendous word that
[33:38] that they gave us
[33:41] this is part number two
[33:43] uh uh on the three curtains
[33:49] and let's just go to our foundation
[33:50] scripture
[34:05] in understanding uh
[34:07] the the the three curtains that we went
[34:10] uh into the other day brother henry and
[34:12] and brother aaron
[34:14] de los tres cortinas
[34:17] they did such an outstanding job
[34:21] we had we had some some things that we
[34:23] that we could come and to
[34:25] maybe uh clarify it a little bit maybe
[34:28] bring it to a better understanding
[34:36] and knowing the scripture as it says in
[34:38] second peter 1 19.
[34:43] we have also a more sure word of
[34:46] prophecy
[34:58] as unto a light that shineth in a dark
[35:00] place
[35:15] to want to greet the the listening
[35:17] audience those that are are on the
[35:18] internet
[35:21] via internet god bless you
[35:24] may the words that are spoken tonight
[35:26] may they accomplish the purpose they
[35:28] were sent
[35:39] one of one of them is the iron curtain
[36:10] [Music]
[36:13] he's the one that started the ball
[36:14] rolling of taking down the iron curtain
[36:22] gentlemen it's uh
[36:24] i don't think it's by coincidence
[36:29] he passed away yesterday
[36:33] so
[36:34] in understanding all of these things
[36:38] is
[37:05] what we do is we're careful of that
[37:08] purple curtain
[37:12] because that one is the one that comes
[37:14] into into all the world and it's got its
[37:17] fingers and it's got his hands into
[37:19] every thing that there
[37:26] as we as we as we have the the brethren
[37:30] uh
[37:30] speak to us tonight
[37:34] i
[37:47] one of them is commerce
[37:50] the second one is religious
[37:52] religion and it winds up to being into
[37:55] satanic powers
[37:58] this is what you have is when you have a
[38:01] prophet yes
[38:15] that was moving things behind the scenes
[38:22] you can see the ship on top of the water
[38:24] sailing really well
[38:28] but very very
[38:30] it's not very often that you actually
[38:32] see the motor or the engine that is
[38:35] pushing this ship through the water
[38:42] likewise
[38:44] you're seeing all of these things that
[38:46] are happening in the world
[38:50] what it is
[38:52] it was just uh something that was let
[38:54] loose
[38:56] well what was behind
[39:15] and especially us that we know the the
[39:18] word of god especially
[39:21] those steps brother the the pro the the
[39:23] word of god tells us
[39:25] the footsteps are the r of the
[39:27] righteousness
[39:30] ordered of the lord
[39:33] so then we must know where we stand
[39:37] the beginning never forget
[39:53] is
[40:18] all right so
[40:20] last time we spoke
[40:23] the question was asked to us
[40:27] is this purple curtain as we see it
[40:29] really a bad thing
[40:34] and at first you might say well yeah
[40:36] it's linked to catholicism it's linked
[40:38] to rome
[40:41] catholicism
[40:42] but we know our adversary the devil
[40:46] el diablo
[40:47] he only imitates what god creates
[40:52] and we found out through a very good
[40:54] teaching through brother henry
[40:59] henry that purple's associated with
[41:01] with the holy things of christ
[41:07] he brought out the curtains in the
[41:09] tabernacle that's right
[41:12] yeah it had to do with adoption
[41:16] but you see satan gets a hold of it is
[41:21] and he perverts it
[41:23] so the next day i was thinking you know
[41:27] on this iron curtain
[41:31] i was thinking on communism ben santos
[41:34] and i was what really got me was the
[41:36] word communion
[41:39] and i began to think you know is
[41:41] communism really bad
[41:44] communism
[41:46] of course we know what it is now
[41:50] but in the beginning was it so
[41:54] so real quick let's go to the book of
[41:56] acts chapter two muy rapido si
[41:59] podemosira libro de los echos
[42:07] and it reads like this
[42:10] and they continued steadfastly in the
[42:12] apostles doctrine and fellowship
[42:14] and in the breaking of bread and in
[42:16] prayers
[42:17] and fear came upon every soul and many
[42:20] wonders and signs were done by the
[42:22] apostles
[42:23] and all that believed were together
[42:26] and had all things common
[42:29] and sold their possessions in good goods
[42:31] and parted them to all men as every man
[42:34] had need
[42:40] lost
[42:52] [Music]
[43:06] so i know in spanish it says had all
[43:08] things in common
[43:10] espanol
[43:14] but the way the scripture reads in
[43:16] english is had all things common
[43:22] now we're going to get to that in just a
[43:24] little bit vamos
[43:38] amen
[44:02] is only a revival of the devil communism
[44:08] you see pentecost had real communism
[44:13] everybody sold everything freely
[44:18] divided among them
[44:33] and that's russia que
[44:37] so
[44:38] the question was asked is communism
[44:40] really bad
[44:41] pregnant
[44:44] so i want to talk on these two words
[44:46] today if that'd be okay the first one is
[45:02] so what's so interesting about these two
[45:04] words
[45:08] is they both come from the same greek
[45:10] word ambassador palabra
[45:14] and it's coinonia quesa oh
[45:28] and what that word means
[45:32] it's the christian fellowship or body of
[45:34] believers
[45:38] it's an intimate spiritual communion
[45:44] and you see these words are so closely
[45:47] linked
[45:49] [Music]
[45:52] they share the same greek root word
[45:56] but where these two
[45:58] words and ideas start to
[46:01] separate
[46:05] as communism says
[46:08] what's yours is mine
[46:11] and i'll take it
[46:22] you know
[46:23] you can give one to the lord for that
[46:27] [Applause]
[46:28] say it again say it again
[46:30] so communism says what's yours is mine
[46:32] and i'll take it by force communism
[46:37] but true christian fellowship says
[46:39] what's mine is yours
[46:53] you know that's what's so special about
[46:55] our pastor
[46:59] is no matter who he meets
[47:03] he's so quick to just freely give them
[47:05] the word without limitations
[47:20] and that's why the scripture did not say
[47:21] in common
[47:25] [Laughter]
[47:35] this is
[47:41] so real quick 244 says and all that
[47:44] believed were together and had all
[47:46] things common
[47:49] established
[47:53] if that word in would have been used
[47:54] there
[47:59] it would have put limitation
[48:02] qualification qualification and
[48:05] circumstances and circumstances so what
[48:08] would have been in common between those
[48:09] believers
[48:14] but it wasn't so
[48:16] no fuel
[48:18] and so we see right here miramos aqui
[48:22] brother henry actually shared this with
[48:23] me yes
[48:26] communism is not the action communism
[48:30] it's the spirit behind that makes the
[48:33] difference
[48:36] between having all things common
[48:38] entrepreneur
[48:40] and all things in common
[48:44] so your limitation is going to be
[48:46] whatever you put your faith in
[48:48] limitation
[48:50] as we heard on sunday escuchamos domingo
[48:53] there's many man-made revivals that are
[48:55] now coming to their end
[49:00] you see so many people are
[49:02] you know they've been in churches for so
[49:04] long tanta gente and estado iglesias
[49:07] portanto tiempo and finding themselves
[49:08] empty is encuentran vasils looking for
[49:11] something more buscando
[49:14] and i stop and ask myself you know
[49:18] what would cause that
[49:22] is it maybe they were searching to have
[49:23] things in common
[49:28] come
[49:29] you know these man-made revivals
[49:33] come to their end
[49:36] and so brother branham says what what
[49:38] causes the revival to stop
[49:43] well he says history shows he says
[49:46] that a revival only lasts about three
[49:48] years
[49:52] and then an organization
[49:54] and then an organization is birthed
[49:56] after that illegal
[49:59] and god can no longer do anything with
[50:01] that revival
[50:05] but there is a true revival
[50:08] it is the bride's revival
[50:20] and it's up to you and i ask the
[50:22] question what is what are you feeding
[50:23] your revival fire
[50:36] you know and i just started to think you
[50:38] know the hottest burning wood there is
[50:39] is hickory
[50:41] pencil
[50:46] it's so thick and dense
[50:49] that it burns hot okay
[50:53] and it's no coincidence that hickory
[50:55] noise coincidence
[50:56] it's actually used in the old days to
[50:58] make a switch to spank the kids
[51:03] and i was thinking lord maybe that's
[51:05] what i need is a good old gospel
[51:06] spanking with some hickory pencils
[51:10] and then i'll throw it in my revival
[51:16] but that's just a little bit on
[51:18] is communism really that bad just a
[51:20] little preview for you
[51:26] go home and read the whole chapter of
[51:29] acts chapter 2.
[51:35] so the problem with communism there was
[51:37] the forced actions
[51:41] and what happened on the day of
[51:42] pentecost
[51:45] was not anything forced
[51:48] it was god
[52:01] that's why we don't believe that
[52:03] pentecost is a denomination
[52:07] it is an experience it's an experience
[52:10] and that's that that was awesome you
[52:11] know
[52:14] when you find out just those words and
[52:16] that now
[52:30] when we come to the understanding of why
[52:33] the message came in english
[52:38] because it's very it the word of god
[52:41] came
[52:42] to us
[52:57] so when the word of god comes
[53:26] last time you were
[53:39] we go into the iron curtain the bamboo
[53:41] curtain
[53:45] the purple
[53:47] and you find out that the the tent or
[53:50] the tabernacle
[53:53] of all these
[54:09] good good evening god bless you thank
[54:10] you
[54:11] i want to start this uh just before we
[54:13] continue uh i was very curious what you
[54:15] were saying i really liked that
[54:17] fellowship
[54:21] two fellas
[54:22] [Music]
[54:36] um
[55:00] what a great point um
[55:03] in continuing talking about this a
[55:05] continuous
[55:07] uh
[55:08] really the point
[55:10] is it's um
[55:14] just just to clear out
[55:17] just to clear the air because things
[55:19] gonna close
[55:20] and and the question might still be
[55:22] asked within the person
[55:27] we're taught
[55:31] as bible believers
[55:34] message believers
[55:37] really every teaching of the word
[55:42] goes to fear not
[55:46] because there is no virtue in fear
[55:49] whatsoever
[55:52] there is only power there's only virtue
[55:54] in faith
[55:56] and brother branham did not say fear the
[55:59] purple curtain of nordica
[56:14] said exactly don't fear communism
[56:19] but you fear catholicism
[56:22] catholicism so how we go from
[56:24] don't fear you're not
[56:28] to fear catholicism
[56:31] catholicism well
[56:33] i don't believe in contradictions
[56:37] in the in the bible or the message
[56:41] outside of that you'll find them all
[56:42] over the place
[56:45] but the perfect word of god there's no
[56:47] contradiction
[56:50] there's no contradiction in the message
[56:52] no contradiction in mensah it's the same
[56:55] word
[57:08] do we
[57:10] you know
[57:11] revere it
[57:16] what is there that we need to know
[57:21] because every time we talk about fear
[57:25] we go right away to the nation's going
[57:27] to go into war yeah
[57:31] people are going to come around and
[57:32] going to take our stuff
[57:36] they're going to kill us if we don't
[57:38] follow their ways
[58:06] so much like we recognize the land right
[58:11] we know that that there's only one lamp
[58:15] that has the ultimate power
[58:18] ultimately so so it's going to come in a
[58:21] way
[58:25] well it's not that's going to come you
[58:27] know
[58:28] i think it's already in so many areas
[58:33] because if we want to help ourselves
[58:37] all this that we're speaking of
[58:40] we need to bring it down to the
[58:41] individual
[58:44] communism communism we'll find it
[58:47] ourselves
[59:01] we find a lot of things
[59:03] influenced by the same spirit
[59:08] in the individual and the individuals in
[59:11] the family in the family in the church
[59:13] in the community
[59:15] and then he grows to the nation
[59:31] people yeah
[59:33] but then the little hunter got things to
[59:34] move within us
[59:38] got things to move within our homes
[59:42] nobody want to hear about that nothing
[59:44] we
[1:00:12] grows on to then we find the vatican in
[1:00:15] rome and all that right
[1:00:18] it's very easy to see it there
[1:00:21] so in this study in this studio how how
[1:00:24] it was represented in in curtains
[1:00:38] but not separating the sense of you know
[1:00:40] what i'm done with you you're that way
[1:00:41] i'm this way
[1:00:46] in the order of how god does things
[1:00:50] uh it separates it
[1:00:53] so as we as we were looking at last um
[1:00:57] last time
[1:01:02] there's
[1:01:02] something to do with purple
[1:01:06] catholic church they're so powerful they
[1:01:07] could pick any color yeah
[1:01:20] is considered one of the purples you
[1:01:21] know there's a there's a rosa is
[1:01:23] considered
[1:01:25] they have a layout of purple this is
[1:01:26] about 12 colors
[1:01:33] it goes from from light pink to yeah
[1:01:36] there was like
[1:01:51] the the the the art behind getting the
[1:01:54] color
[1:01:58] which was it was they had to harvest
[1:02:00] these shells the seashells
[1:02:04] and it was a very difficult and very
[1:02:07] tedious job
[1:02:11] so they had to get him out and
[1:02:13] beat him up and bowling and all this
[1:02:17] and it was it was it it requires so much
[1:02:20] to produce this color
[1:02:24] you have to go out and
[1:02:26] be in the water for hours
[1:02:30] to gather all these snails
[1:02:34] and then go through all that process
[1:02:37] and i don't have the the number but you
[1:02:39] have to get like a drug load of of
[1:02:42] snails
[1:02:47] or a little bit
[1:02:48] of
[1:02:49] product left
[1:02:52] it's so expensive that only high class
[1:02:55] people could afford it
[1:03:01] more than the color it was the process
[1:03:07] that's what defined only royalty yes
[1:03:14] there's more that we can say about this
[1:03:16] but
[1:03:18] the the concerning the purple curtain
[1:03:22] how this spirit
[1:03:26] took it
[1:03:27] from
[1:03:45] where his glory will descend
[1:03:49] and such order and such anointing
[1:03:54] and how they took that
[1:03:56] tomato
[1:04:01] [Music]
[1:04:10] and there's nothing in the world
[1:04:13] that exists
[1:04:15] that happens
[1:04:16] i don't care what movement it is
[1:04:20] it all starts in the scriptures
[1:04:24] and we know that already by
[1:04:26] the message
[1:04:30] that uh
[1:04:31] the devil just perverts
[1:04:35] he can't come up with something on his
[1:04:37] own
[1:04:40] you know that should be enough for
[1:04:41] somebody to say i cannot follow the
[1:04:43] devil he can't even come up with his own
[1:04:45] stuff
[1:04:51] he's not that smart hello
[1:05:12] and i would like to maybe pick it up in
[1:05:14] on this where we left last time
[1:05:18] how purple was used
[1:05:35] bosswork as he was commenting in service
[1:05:41] that after after a son he didn't know
[1:05:43] what his son was going to become
[1:05:48] we have children but we don't know what
[1:05:49] they're going to turn into
[1:05:54] they get their influences they go back
[1:05:55] and forth and unless
[1:05:59] you come to to find a point that if you
[1:06:02] got a trust that there is a seed in
[1:06:04] there
[1:06:08] and in the old times where brandon says
[1:06:09] that we don't know what they're going to
[1:06:10] come up with
[1:06:15] if we're going to be a gangster if he's
[1:06:17] going to be there's going to be that eva
[1:06:21] but
[1:06:22] he put he puts him under
[1:06:24] tutors
[1:06:27] and now this is the old times
[1:06:30] and antigua
[1:06:45] and and
[1:06:47] it would take it was about 40 years old
[1:06:49] correct brother caleb
[1:06:52] adoption was a person was about 40 years
[1:06:55] old
[1:07:12] in bible times
[1:07:15] a boy would have to show himself
[1:07:19] and it was about the age of 40 years old
[1:07:23] they were ready to be
[1:07:25] adopted
[1:07:51] that was when the father put a purple
[1:07:53] robe on the sun cuando el
[1:08:08] so we go back to what david said when he
[1:08:11] was he was wondering about the tempo
[1:08:18] what he wanted to do
[1:08:19] do a temple a house for the lord
[1:08:32] then he approaches the lord in psalms
[1:08:33] and i like to read this
[1:08:36] in solomons
[1:08:51] is
[1:08:55] bless the lord oh my soul
[1:08:59] oh my god
[1:09:02] thou are very great
[1:09:18] a garment como vestidura who stretches
[1:09:22] out the heavens like a curtain
[1:09:28] amen so the covering of the lord was to
[1:09:31] be a light
[1:09:32] it
[1:09:50] but then
[1:09:52] systems they just took the color and
[1:09:53] took the meaning of it and the anointing
[1:09:55] behind it
[1:10:00] we see that what david saw
[1:10:05] was actually an adoption in the
[1:10:08] in the event of a doc
[1:10:13] which is matthew 17 4 correct
[1:10:21] uh
[1:10:34] let's just read let's just read just
[1:10:36] today so we don't have to read a lot
[1:10:37] let's read 17 5.
[1:10:42] verses
[1:10:56] a bright cloud overshadow them
[1:11:01] behold a voice out of the cloud say this
[1:11:03] is my beloved son
[1:11:07] in whom i am well pleased hear ye him
[1:11:23] [Music]
[1:11:38] so i'm trying to see why brother branham
[1:11:40] said fear catholicism
[1:11:46] and the truth is
[1:11:49] those
[1:11:50] original communists
[1:11:52] communist
[1:12:03] the true catholicism
[1:12:08] that was the real thing
[1:12:10] that means universal
[1:12:12] catholic means universal catholic
[1:12:14] significant universal so so uh
[1:12:18] speaking of communism abroad
[1:12:26] what's so bad about it
[1:12:32] in our realms as
[1:12:33] as christians
[1:12:39] the same meanings that you gave us i
[1:12:41] mean
[1:12:44] what makes it bad that we
[1:12:46] look at the
[1:12:47] systems more than the word
[1:12:59] so we're more kind of forced into things
[1:13:03] legally
[1:13:05] and but
[1:13:08] diario
[1:13:10] so he wants to make us
[1:13:13] he wants to have us in
[1:13:30] circumstances
[1:13:45] when you bring them all together
[1:13:49] when we separate them
[1:13:52] wound up going one way with anti-god's
[1:13:54] spirit
[1:13:57] with the
[1:13:58] anti-christ
[1:14:03] you know you said something about those
[1:14:04] three powers one is commerce right
[1:14:09] which is the merchants of the earth
[1:14:24] the merchants of the earth started to
[1:14:26] grow
[1:14:27] [Music]
[1:14:45] that the catholic church started to
[1:14:47] expand with its doctrines worldwide
[1:14:54] because
[1:15:08] but
[1:15:23] principle
[1:15:24] but there were so many languages that
[1:15:27] was
[1:15:28] and at that time spain was very strong
[1:15:32] espana
[1:15:33] spain was super strong espana
[1:15:36] so they said yeah well spanish uh has to
[1:15:39] be
[1:15:41] the language because most most is ships
[1:15:46] the strength of of of uh
[1:15:50] ocean travel
[1:15:54] and freight and all this
[1:15:56] spain
[1:15:57] espana portugal portugal and then
[1:16:00] england
[1:16:02] so they say well spanish
[1:16:15] and they did it in the newfound world
[1:16:17] which was america is
[1:16:23] but
[1:16:24] there was a point that was very strong
[1:16:25] in in this merchants of the earth
[1:16:30] and that was peru yes
[1:16:35] and
[1:16:36] when they got this had this gathering
[1:16:40] and they said that means they brought
[1:16:42] the strongest richest man on earth
[1:16:51] and they voted for the one language that
[1:16:54] was to be the universal language
[1:17:00] of course
[1:17:15] we talk english we speak english because
[1:17:18] we live here
[1:17:21] but you have no clue what the lord had
[1:17:23] to do to make english a language
[1:18:06] are highly dominated by the catholic
[1:18:08] church so
[1:18:10] dominar
[1:18:13] so those little things that we don't
[1:18:15] value really much
[1:18:18] it's all in that two-two letter word all
[1:18:20] in that little
[1:18:25] it is it's amazing
[1:18:28] but for god to bring a prophet to this
[1:18:30] land
[1:18:33] look what he had to do
[1:18:36] to bring him in that condition
[1:18:39] catholic church or you know we don't
[1:18:41] want to call that name yet but we see
[1:18:43] him the scripture what he calls here
[1:18:48] and the merchants of the earth
[1:18:52] to an agreement to find a universal
[1:18:54] language
[1:18:57] universal and against everybody's
[1:18:59] expectations
[1:19:02] the fight came very close between
[1:19:04] english and spanish
[1:19:16] that vote will decide the language
[1:19:19] is
[1:19:24] [Music]
[1:19:31] you want to know why peru has been so
[1:19:32] miserably poor um
[1:19:45] the one vote that gave english the
[1:19:46] victory was was a spanish-speaking
[1:19:49] country
[1:19:55] and they suffered tremendously
[1:19:59] because they were a really a powerful
[1:20:01] country
[1:20:23] so we see all the stuff all the things
[1:20:25] that move
[1:20:26] us
[1:20:28] that we don't really appreciate for us
[1:20:29] to have a bible the way it is
[1:20:34] and the the little things
[1:20:38] so uh one one thing
[1:20:41] i wasn't gonna talk as much yeah that's
[1:20:44] all right correct right
[1:20:47] i like to maybe mention something on the
[1:20:49] you got it got it just closing this is
[1:20:51] the purple curtain
[1:20:57] is
[1:20:58] the let's go do that scripture real
[1:21:01] quick
[1:21:03] when you go when you go back to what
[1:21:05] brother henry said on do not fear
[1:21:08] hermano henry joseph
[1:21:11] the bible mentions that
[1:21:13] time
[1:21:18] one for every day of the year
[1:21:24] including
[1:21:34] let's go to the book of proverbs the
[1:21:36] last book i know we kind of mentioned it
[1:21:38] last
[1:21:42] verse
[1:21:44] chapter 31
[1:21:49] verse 10.
[1:21:52] i hope you're enjoying this as much as i
[1:22:01] it says
[1:22:03] who can find a virtuous woman
[1:22:05] for her price is far above ruby's rubies
[1:22:17] well
[1:22:18] that's where the fight comes on this
[1:22:20] catholicism
[1:22:36] a what did john see here camilo juan
[1:22:41] pues aqui
[1:22:47] 174 right
[1:22:49] capital
[1:22:50] apocalypse
[1:23:19] stones and pearls
[1:23:24] having a golden cup in her hand full of
[1:23:25] abominations and filthiness of her
[1:23:27] fornication
[1:23:36] the catholic church took this
[1:23:39] that spirit it's a spiritual knowing
[1:23:42] that christ will come for one.
[1:24:08] and how to force people into their
[1:24:09] beliefs
[1:24:15] that catholic spirit is a spiritual
[1:24:17] catholic it's not only catholics
[1:24:22] i mean catholics believe so many things
[1:24:26] that kind of like christians
[1:24:31] but then they start changing it and say
[1:24:32] well christians don't believe like we do
[1:24:36] los cristinos
[1:24:38] so he started like we're all the same
[1:24:41] logo
[1:24:47] the catholic church and other christians
[1:24:48] believe this
[1:24:51] christian
[1:24:52] the ten commandments
[1:24:55] believe that god knows everything
[1:25:00] and has unlimited power it is
[1:25:03] they believe that jesus christ died for
[1:25:05] the sins of the world
[1:25:08] rose again
[1:25:11] and one day you and dia will come again
[1:25:13] in glory
[1:25:15] in gloria to judge the living and the
[1:25:17] dead
[1:25:19] the importance of worshiping god
[1:25:22] these are the fundamental beliefs of the
[1:25:24] catholic church is fundamental
[1:25:27] catholic they believe that the
[1:25:29] infallibility of the bible
[1:25:35] and then it starts changing labor
[1:25:36] communicating they believe in the real
[1:25:39] presence of christ
[1:25:43] you pronounce this
[1:25:45] eucharist the eucharist in the eucharist
[1:25:48] so now we're adding something to our
[1:25:51] estamos
[1:25:53] believe that god forgives mortal sins
[1:25:55] through the sacrament of reconciliation
[1:26:04] which is performed through a priest
[1:26:06] question
[1:26:08] and then they go this this is this all
[1:26:09] comes from catholic documents
[1:26:14] while most protestants do not believe in
[1:26:16] the sacrament
[1:26:20] sacramento catholics hope to the
[1:26:23] authority of scriptures and tradition
[1:26:30] which is the teaching of authority of
[1:26:31] the church
[1:26:34] which is
[1:26:48] which is the only believe in the bible
[1:26:50] alone
[1:26:53] see how they went against this that the
[1:26:55] infallibility infallibility of the bible
[1:26:57] that all that changed
[1:27:03] and he goes on to say you know like we
[1:27:05] read last time
[1:27:07] once again
[1:27:08] they have a better bible because they
[1:27:10] got 72 books but we still have 66.
[1:27:14] those liberals
[1:27:16] is
[1:27:26] and the catholics are defined as a
[1:27:27] visible society of baptized christians
[1:27:29] professing
[1:27:59] it
[1:28:00] started to tighten up as a forceful
[1:28:02] thing
[1:28:08] well they said that in 2012 there was
[1:28:10] 1.1 billion catholics worldwide
[1:28:22] but there is another aspect to this i
[1:28:24] got to aspect
[1:28:26] is as they go into what they believe
[1:28:30] there is a teaching of
[1:28:34] speaking you know catholics believe in
[1:28:36] praising and worshiping their their
[1:28:38] saints
[1:29:07] we only see catholicism as catholic
[1:29:11] catholicism
[1:29:13] but
[1:29:14] brother can you put these pictures up
[1:29:15] here
[1:29:18] if you have him
[1:29:32] the one to your right
[1:29:43] and it represents that you know the
[1:29:45] mother taking care of the sun
[1:29:49] she's the mother of jesus which is
[1:29:51] really the mother of god
[1:29:53] jesus christ
[1:29:55] and then we do appreciate the son but we
[1:29:57] do worship the mother more
[1:30:02] that is that elaborate mariology is
[1:30:29] these are the only two religions that
[1:30:32] practice that
[1:30:34] religion
[1:30:36] this one be the catholic church
[1:30:44] believe just as much
[1:31:03] because there's more converts from
[1:31:04] catholicism to the islam
[1:31:09] islam
[1:31:10] to any other religion
[1:31:13] and there's more christians
[1:31:17] that in in refusing to go
[1:31:19] to to to the catholic church
[1:31:23] they become muslims
[1:31:26] and the muslims have that they don't
[1:31:28] they don't take anybody i mean if you're
[1:31:30] not from their line you're not a muslim
[1:31:32] it was an exception
[1:31:38] but they did open up a department here
[1:31:43] you're welcome to join or believe but
[1:31:45] you're not really a muslim but we'll let
[1:31:47] you
[1:31:48] know
[1:31:49] on islam
[1:31:54] and that's where with a lot of the this
[1:31:56] communist terrorism sits
[1:31:59] that hybrid
[1:32:04] so it is a woman with virtue as far as
[1:32:06] power
[1:32:10] but it's not a virtuous woman who shall
[1:32:12] find her that the lord is looking
[1:32:16] at
[1:32:18] that's awesome
[1:32:22] this is this is where where you come
[1:32:25] into when he made the
[1:32:26] the the
[1:32:28] the connection between
[1:32:30] between catholicism
[1:32:32] and and islam
[1:32:34] the connection is this
[1:32:40] according to dr rivera which was an
[1:32:42] ex-jesuit priest
[1:32:47] and this is why we've said this before
[1:32:50] the jesuits met muhammad in a cave
[1:33:18] and the different things of that that
[1:33:20] are that are being that are taught
[1:33:23] within that religion
[1:33:27] that's why when you when you come and
[1:33:29] you see them in their fingers and their
[1:33:32] threads in every country
[1:33:38] who's the one that said the other day
[1:33:39] that that one of the best friends i i
[1:33:41] believe that that it was the last panel
[1:33:43] brother jim you said that the best
[1:33:45] friend of the of the pope was was
[1:33:49] oh god man of saudi arabia or
[1:33:52] anyway
[1:33:55] yeah they're buddy buddy so they're
[1:33:56] buddy buddies it's all it's all all of
[1:33:58] it together
[1:34:00] when you when you find this then then
[1:34:02] you you it's when when the prophet of
[1:34:05] god says it's not the people
[1:34:08] pueblo the system is the system this is
[1:34:11] this is the sim this is the simplicity
[1:34:13] of
[1:34:14] the same as when you go into the bamboo
[1:34:17] curtain
[1:34:20] of bamboo about a chinese bamboo tree
[1:34:24] uh bamboo takes five years to grow
[1:34:30] it has to be watered and fertilized in
[1:34:32] the ground
[1:34:36] where it had been planted every day
[1:34:40] it does not break ground for five years
[1:34:52] it will grow 90 feet 90 feet tall in
[1:34:56] five weeks
[1:34:59] what are we trying to say about this
[1:35:03] in 2015
[1:35:05] bill gates goes to wuhan china bill
[1:35:08] gatesbach wuhan china and he says that
[1:35:11] in five years this second cinco a virus
[1:35:14] is going to hit up it's going to be a
[1:35:16] pandemic around the world
[1:35:23] what we what we understand through all
[1:35:25] of this
[1:35:27] it wasn't a virus of corona that was let
[1:35:31] loose
[1:35:34] it was a virus of fear
[1:35:38] that engulfed the world
[1:35:54] do not fear
[1:35:57] and spear was let loose
[1:36:00] and once fear and we we have we have bro
[1:36:03] brother diego that's a man of god
[1:36:07] that's the prophet that that sees that
[1:36:08] he's a fightful prophet that sees these
[1:36:11] visions
[1:36:14] he said in the vision
[1:36:17] that coronavirus was little el corona
[1:36:21] but it was accompanied
[1:36:36] what was being let loose
[1:36:39] they said this
[1:36:41] they said those that controlled and
[1:36:45] dominated the world a chaos
[1:36:48] we need your help necesita
[1:37:04] so that you will go into your country
[1:37:08] and break the economy of your country
[1:37:13] to re-establish
[1:37:16] establishment new financial order
[1:38:12] that's why the order was
[1:38:24] because once fear is established in the
[1:38:27] heart of the person
[1:38:56] this is what brings the confederation of
[1:39:00] churches
[1:39:02] when you see when brother branham talks
[1:39:04] about confederation of churches
[1:39:08] when you enter into the internet entra
[1:39:24] any league or union of people
[1:39:29] or bodies of people
[1:39:32] the term in modern political use
[1:39:38] politics is generally confined to a
[1:39:41] permanent union
[1:39:46] permanente this is why the united states
[1:39:48] of america
[1:39:51] was a confederation first of all
[1:39:54] confederacy
[1:39:56] federation

[1:40:21] themselves
[1:40:25] to work together
