[12:07] Jesus
[12:08] Christ
[12:13] amen so we uh we we have in front of us
[12:17] tonight
[12:21] a theme a topic of of course portals and
[12:24] dimensions
[12:28] and uh
[12:29] you know it was this was uh pretty
[12:32] pretty rough topic to study
[12:36] but by the grace of almighty God
[12:41] you know we have we have a uh we have an
[12:44] our amazing Pastor that that stepped in
[12:51] and being being that
[13:52] obviously to the church
[14:08] by the grace of God
[14:12] so without further Ado let's let's open
[14:15] our our Bibles to the Book of John
[14:17] chapter 10 verse 9.
[14:23] and we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna
[14:25] talk about about some things here so
[14:27] let's let's let's read the scripture and
[14:29] it says I am the door
[14:32] by me if any man enter in
[14:36] he shall be saved
[14:38] and he and shall go in and out is
[14:43] amen so let's start there brother Jerry
[14:47] and and we're gonna we're gonna start
[14:49] off with with the definition of of a
[14:52] portal okay
[14:54] and and get into that and we're going to
[14:57] take it we're gonna take this this this
[14:59] study tonight maybe guys maybe from from
[15:02] uh from an outside in perspective
[15:09] I I think we look at it from maybe uh
[15:13] um Outer Outer Space to um
[15:19] all right so so definition of a portal
[15:23] is a door
[15:26] um an entrance
[15:27] especially
[15:29] a grand or imposing one
[15:31] [Music]
[15:34] uh some of the some of the synonyms uh
[15:37] basically the the words that mean the
[15:38] same thing
[15:42] a door foreign
[15:56] [Music]
[16:03] um and and and you'll see later on
[16:06] from one thing to another
[16:11] um and and so so I'm gonna I'm gonna go
[16:14] ahead and go ahead and and uh see if the
[16:15] guys want to start talking here brother
[16:17] Jerry can you can you talk to us
[16:20] about in about outer space where we
[16:22] found ourselves
[16:28] so taking what we know
[16:31] so we create a kind of an outline
[16:36] so we took what brother Brandon would
[16:38] say that above us is
[16:49] so so starting off like I said starting
[16:51] with what we know principiano
[16:54] we know that um obviously like I said
[16:56] it's a doorway into something
[17:00] and uh so we got to bring him down from
[17:02] God above us in space
[17:05] and the reason that we have to do that
[17:08] is
[17:10] God above us that he's not reachable
[17:13] sovereign
[17:48] and the topic itself is full of portals
[17:54] right you start studying one one line
[17:58] before you know it you've transported to
[18:01] you know over there yeah
[18:04] so so uh so yeah let's let's let's take
[18:07] that so outer space got it got above us
[18:10] uh
[18:14] can you can you tell us a little bit
[18:16] about
[18:18] um the Tower of Babel give us the
[18:20] starting point of the Tower of Babel
[18:22] there
[18:23] see because on that really kind of
[18:26] sideways so so what they were trying to
[18:28] do look at
[18:29] but humans always try to do
[18:33] they always try to reach God right
[18:36] so they were trying to find that portal
[18:39] even at
[18:41] portal so
[18:44] speaking about speaking of outer space
[18:48] we'll get we'll get to that here in a
[18:50] little bit absolutely
[18:52] but um
[18:54] you know I growing up when I came into
[18:57] this message I think it was about 115
[18:59] going on 16.
[19:02] and uh we're talking about outer space
[19:05] and Inner Space
[19:07] we know that there's portals that are
[19:09] out there
[19:11] right out in space that's that's truth
[19:16] we know that there's portals in in in in
[19:19] us we'll get we'll get at least growing
[19:23] up you know a lot of things happened to
[19:25] me that I didn't understand until until
[19:27] now that I've I've been in the message
[19:29] you know so many years
[19:33] and visions
[19:36] that I thought I thought was just crazy
[19:39] crazy you know I used to call my cousin
[19:42] Jerry a lot
[19:44] I had some weird some weird things
[19:46] happen to me
[19:48] and I remember one of the first this
[19:50] wasn't the first but
[19:53] one of the first was
[19:57] um
[19:57] I I was I was at home one time yesterday
[20:00] and I don't know I was probably about 20
[20:02] I think
[20:04] and we all have hard times right in our
[20:06] lives
[20:08] and I was going to be going through a
[20:10] really rough time with with my family
[20:12] yesterday
[20:16] and I remember I was praying to God so
[20:19] much that night he just did
[20:22] and this sounds crazy but this guy can
[20:25] vouch for me but what I'm going to say
[20:27] because
[20:30] Tommy you indicated it
[20:34] so I'm praying to God at night
[20:38] and asked Lord I said Lord you know I
[20:42] don't want to commit suicide or anything
[20:43] like that
[20:46] I want you to take my life I
[20:49] want to feel what I feel you know I just
[20:53] want to be out of here
[20:55] so that night I went to sleep and I fell
[20:57] asleep on the couch
[21:01] and uh I remember all of a sudden I was
[21:04] out I was outside outside of myself
[21:07] looking at myself
[21:11] and uh
[21:13] uh I just I remember taking a breath out
[21:18] and when I did that but whether it be my
[21:21] spirit Soul whatever you want to call I
[21:23] just I just saw it just start floating
[21:24] up in the air and it was just floating
[21:28] and uh
[21:30] when they get kind of got out of this
[21:33] atmosphere I remember just it just boom
[21:35] it went into space
[21:39] I know this sounds weird but what you'll
[21:42] see at the end
[21:44] it was weird to me
[21:47] um but I remember just going through
[21:49] passing stars and and going through like
[21:52] like when I was going through a path
[21:56] I mean not Jet Fast just I mean stars
[22:00] are so far apart but the stars were just
[22:01] passing just really really really really
[22:02] fast
[22:05] and I remember that I was going to a
[22:09] place
[22:10] and I remember that I could think
[22:17] but I remember thinking oh my gosh this
[22:21] is this is real like he really did take
[22:23] me
[22:27] and I was going to this place
[22:30] at this you know the speed of light I
[22:32] don't know what you would want to call
[22:33] it
[22:34] and I remember the first thing that I
[22:36] thought when I was going to this place
[22:40] I'm gonna miss my mom and dad too much
[22:44] and as I was going that fast I just came
[22:47] to a complete stop
[22:50] and when I came to a complete stop like
[22:52] that started going backwards and I
[22:56] started seeing the stars going this way
[23:00] and I remember getting back into you
[23:03] would want to call Earth's atmosphere
[23:07] Earth's atmosphere
[23:09] [Music]
[23:13] and uh I remember just starting to float
[23:16] again
[23:18] and I saw myself on the couch again
[23:22] and I took a breath in this time
[23:26] to myself
[23:28] now
[23:29] I remember thinking to myself oh my gosh
[23:31] like I woke up and I put it like two in
[23:34] the morning and I was like so scared and
[23:36] freaked out uh
[23:39] that's what we kind of God started
[23:41] dealing with me and things like that yes
[23:45] well you're so you forgot to say this
[23:48] you were so scared that you called me at
[23:50] two in the morning
[23:54] I was so scared that I I got up and and
[23:57] I called my cousin Jerry because I was
[23:59] like
[24:02] and I started to tell them exactly what
[24:04] happened
[24:05] and I said man I know that sounds weird
[24:08] but it just felt so real you know
[24:14] um and I said I told Jerry this I said
[24:16] you know Jerry the only way that I can
[24:17] explain it
[24:20] if you've ever seen that movie
[24:23] contacts
[24:25] the only way that I could more or less
[24:27] describe it is
[24:31] so that's that's what I had told you
[24:34] correct so then anyway I don't know two
[24:36] three weeks later come over here
[24:39] and uh uh we have some services in
[24:43] Silver City so Tommy calls for all of us
[24:45] to go over there
[24:48] and uh well he's preaching he's going to
[24:50] town and he's you know he's you know you
[24:52] know
[24:53] I'm gonna say right he's he's just under
[24:55] the 19 and just and he starts talking
[24:58] about you know death and traveling like
[25:01] that
[25:03] I happen to be looking I think me and my
[25:06] cousin Jerry were either next to each
[25:07] other across each other I can't remember
[25:09] exactly
[25:11] as he's talking about this traveling
[25:15] he says you know what
[25:17] you know what it's a lot like
[25:20] you guys should watch the movie contact
[25:24] and I looked at Jerry and I was like
[25:27] whoa
[25:29] all but we were both like that right so
[25:32] so brother brother Lorenzo could could
[25:34] you have called that an out of Body
[25:36] Experience
[25:39] okay and we've we've heard a lot of
[25:41] examples of that right yeah
[25:44] who died and they they go and they come
[25:48] back
[25:52] and so in a lot of ways that's that's
[25:55] that's where where we were we kind of we
[25:57] kind of where we're going with with the
[25:59] Tower of Babel yes
[26:01] trying to reach God right trying to
[26:04] reach God having some sort of out of
[26:06] out-of-body experience
[26:10] right man trying to reach God
[26:13] in a way that's that's not really
[26:15] intended
[26:17] and so at the Tower of Babel we all know
[26:21] what what went on there and
[26:23] a little bit deeper and kind of explain
[26:25] some of it
[26:27] I mean we all know what they were trying
[26:30] to do was they brother Branham says
[26:33] man tries to reach God
[26:36] and they do it in a perverted way
[26:40] and they're doing all this stuff trying
[26:43] to reaches and of course they're all in
[26:46] one language
[26:47] and God comes and he scrambles up all
[26:50] their languages right
[26:53] to put a stop to that
[26:55] they started to to get into God's
[26:58] Laboratories
[27:01] and that's that's God won't he won't do
[27:04] that
[27:06] so brother Jerry if that's the perverted
[27:09] way Hermanos
[27:10] and that's that's outer space right
[27:14] so so what we need to find out is is
[27:17] what's God's intended
[27:19] and furthermore what what is our role
[27:23] what is what do portals mean to us what
[27:29] what do we do what what does that have
[27:31] to do with us
[27:33] right so so that's where we're gonna
[27:35] we're gonna maybe turn the corner and
[27:37] let's let's go interspace
[27:41] let's go there the Inner Space and and
[27:44] and and let's talk about that Jerry if
[27:46] you wanted
[27:48] that quote there and we can kind of kind
[27:50] of finish up the thought there
[27:53] let me let me just uh go ahead insert
[27:55] this year yeah we're talking about that
[27:57] above us
[27:59] unattainable unreachable yes
[28:03] the Tower of Babel literally means the
[28:05] Gate of God as part of the root word yes
[28:11] so a man with his own ideas
[28:43] so we we see how that the the god of of
[28:47] Heaven the you know Elohim
[28:50] regard he was manifested in the flesh
[28:55] he's bringing them down from the
[28:57] constellations
[28:59] down to the human being okay so he's
[29:03] showing you
[29:04] it's it's the model is the model is of
[29:09] what we need to be and we're going to go
[29:10] into that more
[29:12] but but you see like I said
[29:28] because you got to remember like us as
[29:30] human beings
[29:36] and we're going to talk about that
[29:38] there's an eternal part of you
[29:42] but before we jump into you got in us I
[29:44] wanted to make sure that we talked about
[29:46] the portal God With Us first
[30:01] that's what things get interesting so
[30:05] that's like I said so make sure you put
[30:06] your spiritual thinking cap
[30:09] is
[30:12] because there's some good stuff in there
[30:17] all right so so do we want to go and
[30:20] read this quote here brother Jerry
[30:23] um
[30:24] you want to read that if you want to
[30:26] read the highlighted part and and kind
[30:27] of go on that okay yeah sure so it's 41
[30:29] right so do you see that uh I don't know
[30:31] if they were able to get the hopefully
[30:33] they were
[30:35] but okay so it's a quote the Inside Man
[30:40] 41.
[30:42] so watch watch how he he brings them
[30:44] from light uh
[30:47] what he talks about in when he's in that
[30:49] form
[30:51] watch there he is in the pillar of fires
[30:54] no one could touch him he's holy no one
[30:59] can come near him
[31:00] no sir no Senor and when he settled on
[31:04] that mountain
[31:06] is
[31:08] Commandments
[31:12] because remember when he would speak to
[31:14] the children of Israel back then
[31:18] it was God above them right but they
[31:21] were scared
[31:23] they would tremble because
[31:26] he said the mountain would Shake
[31:29] even to the point where Moses he he
[31:31] would say was fearful he was fearful of
[31:34] that is
[31:38] so great to leave him Moses himself
[31:40] dreaded it
[31:43] says
[31:45] and the people said don't let God speak
[31:48] thus we die
[31:52] let Moses speak to us
[31:56] but you see how it's coming down now
[31:58] from the from the Heavenly us
[32:01] to the human being
[32:03] and even if a beast touch that mountain
[32:06] I want to see soon killed
[32:21] he said now watch the love of God and
[32:24] Allah to make you start praying for a
[32:26] Revival
[32:27] um
[32:35] condescending coming down
[32:37] unfolding himself
[32:40] then God appeared there in a pillar of
[32:43] fire
[32:44] then the next time he appeared
[32:48] was when he appeared in his son
[32:51] Christ Jesus Christ Jesus he
[32:54] overshadowed a virgin
[32:57] real the blood cells
[33:03] that brought forth the Son of God
[33:06] and God was in Christ
[33:09] reconciling the world to himself
[33:13] and so we have we have
[33:17] outer space right we have yeah
[33:21] right and he begins to condescend down
[33:25] he begins to to to make a journey
[33:29] down into mortal man
[33:32] right and so so the Inner Space that we
[33:36] want to talk about it
[33:40] is is when God comes in and dwells
[33:45] inside of the Believers
[33:48] and he and he begins to occupy that
[33:51] space inside
[33:54] and then and then that that Inner Space
[33:58] it it pertains to to the Inner Man where
[34:02] that inner man dwells
[34:05] because the reality of it is is that's
[34:08] who you and I really are
[34:10] yes
[34:11] we're not this Corporal body that you
[34:14] and I see
[34:17] there's an inner man inside
[34:19] that's that part that pertains to God
[34:23] right and so so we want to we want to
[34:26] focus on that and and we see that we see
[34:29] now God and
[34:31] Jesus Christ becoming the ultimate
[34:33] portal
[34:37] God became man
[34:40] and he opened up the ultimate portal
[34:45] and he came to redeem back right
[34:49] read John 14 4 6.
[34:52] and whether I go eat and whether I go ye
[34:56] no and ye the way you know Thomas saith
[34:59] the next one Thomas saith unto him Lord
[35:02] we know not whether thou's go
[35:05] and how can we know the way
[35:07] Jesus saith unto them I am the way the
[35:11] truth and the life no man cometh unto
[35:14] the father but by me so notice not only
[35:20] is is is he the ultimate portal is
[35:26] but he's making it plainly clear
[35:31] I am the way Jose I am the only way
[35:36] right he's making he's making a
[35:38] statement here
[35:40] that the majority of the world didn't
[35:42] understand
[35:44] but the statement he's making is
[35:48] I am the ultimate portal
[35:50] you want you want to get to the father
[35:53] there's only one way
[35:56] there's not there's not a not an end
[35:58] around there's not a secret passage
[36:02] it's right here
[36:04] and so and so we see that in that
[36:06] scripture and how beautiful full that
[36:08] scripture is
[36:16] Jesus saith unto him I am the way the
[36:18] truth and the life
[36:19] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[36:25] I want to make sure we clarify that amen
[36:27] get those scriptures correctly correctly
[36:31] quoted there
[36:33] so so
[36:37] the last part so Jerry the the last part
[36:39] of that quote
[36:43] he he appeared in the visible form of
[36:45] Jesus Christ
[36:47] and and he overshadowed a virgin
[36:52] he creates the blood cells
[36:55] right and and it's God in Christ is
[37:00] brother Enzo he's reconciling he's
[37:02] working to reconcile the world to
[37:04] himself
[37:06] so he's in process
[37:09] right so very much like like the
[37:12] believer
[37:13] we find ourselves in a process right
[37:18] the stature of the perfect man
[37:21] and it's it's a it's a process but it's
[37:25] it's also a portal right
[37:28] because that stature
[37:30] is is the it's the return path is it is
[37:36] so so let's let's go down a little more
[37:39] here
[37:42] oh yeah no no um I was saying um so
[37:45] during that process
[37:46] we go through low Times Hard Times
[37:51] right does that correct anybody have a
[37:54] hard time
[37:56] to get rough sometimes
[37:59] but but there's a very interesting point
[38:01] here that brother Lorenzo is gonna
[38:04] um
[38:05] I thought it was really good on Jacob
[38:07] Jacob's troubles yes we we went in in
[38:10] Los Angeles so
[38:13] with Jacob's uh
[38:15] Jacob's troubles uh Jacob's Ladder they
[38:19] they had cope
[38:21] um we see here that when Jacob when he
[38:23] was running away that
[38:28] Jacob rested his head on a stone
[38:35] he rested his head on a rock because
[38:40] there was gonna be a a a place there was
[38:43] going to be an encounter that's why
[38:46] and uh but if you if you notice this is
[38:49] he rested his head on a rock
[38:53] how many have a nice fluffy pillow at
[38:56] home right maybe even a couple one that
[38:59] you hug
[39:00] but he did he rested his head on a stone
[39:06] to make him uncomfortable
[39:09] [Music]
[39:10] yet he rested his head on the Revelation
[39:17] when brother Branham when brother
[39:19] Branham uh uh went beyond the current of
[39:21] time
[39:23] he said I preach what Paul preached
[39:27] and the Saints say yeah
[39:33] Jesus said Upon This Rock
[39:36] I will build my church
[39:39] so it's crazy it's it's it's it's it's
[39:42] crazy because
[39:43] Jesus wants you uncomfortable
[39:47] in order for you to rest
[39:50] because when you're uncomfortable
[39:53] you can continue to go forward
[39:58] that's when you continue to have to
[40:00] strive for Jesus Christ
[40:04] that's when you have to get your
[40:06] relationship even closer to Jesus Christ
[40:11] as we were studying you know we had
[40:15] night upon night upon night Studio
[40:19] and uh uh my cousin Jerry yeah
[40:22] with different things different
[40:24] experiences that have happened in my
[40:25] life that that I'm understanding a
[40:27] little bit more now
[40:30] uh you know our he asked me the question
[40:34] one night
[40:35] before we left he said what triggers
[40:38] that okay okay
[40:41] maybe a dream
[40:46] he said what triggers that okay and I'm
[40:49] looking at him I don't know I don't know
[40:53] and let me just say we went round and
[40:56] rounds
[40:58] we were we were everywhere but thank the
[41:01] Lord that that our pastor knows yeah
[41:07] because our pastor then he's he's there
[41:10] the following the following uh uh
[41:12] studies
[41:15] and uh we're talking and and brother and
[41:18] you know he doesn't know that we asked
[41:19] this question right that brother Jerry
[41:20] had asked me this question
[41:22] but we were talking about different
[41:24] dreams and things like that
[41:29] and then brother Caleb he looks at me
[41:31] and he says what triggers that
[42:03] exactly right that's exactly right
[42:06] so here we we we see that J doesn't
[42:10] really start to interject it's a place
[42:12] of encounter
[42:14] to see what decision you're going to
[42:16] make
[42:19] amen so we see here that Jacob he sees
[42:23] he sees a ladder right
[42:26] and what does he see in this in this
[42:28] ladder
[42:30] he sees Angels now I wanna you guys take
[42:35] this take this into into mind okay keep
[42:38] this in the mind the Bible says that the
[42:40] latter came from the earth up to heaven
[42:46] okay so it came from the earth up to
[42:49] heaven
[42:50] from the earth up to heaven he saw
[42:53] angels ascending evil
[42:58] and what were these Angels doing
[43:01] these angels you think that your prayers
[43:03] aren't heard
[43:07] these angels for taking everybody's
[43:09] prayers
[43:11] it would take them up to the Lord and
[43:15] they would descend with angels back with
[43:17] answers
[44:17] the Saints of cedar
[44:32] like we said the latter came from Earth
[44:34] up to heaven can we put that picture up
[44:36] please
[44:43] now
[44:45] here's here's the thing here
[44:51] let me get into this real quick here
[44:54] I'm going to read this uh brother
[44:56] Branham he says
[44:58] he says about the latter I wasn't going
[44:59] to read this but I like this
[45:02] he said he gets a ladder
[45:05] you know like what that play Leo
[45:10] where the man put the ladder outside of
[45:13] the house
[45:15] Romeo and Juliet
[45:18] that's right put the ladder up and stole
[45:22] his bride away
[45:24] now he's just coming down Jacob's Ladder
[45:29] and saying yeah
[45:32] whatever
[46:12] it had to have been a spiral
[46:16] because this ladder was a portal
[46:21] let me read here
[46:24] it said and did you ever think of the
[46:27] Tower of Babel
[46:29] is and compare it with Jacob's Ladder
[46:35] how that they were trying to build
[46:37] stairs around
[46:42] and we'll reach up to heaven
[46:47] only trying to pervert Jacob's Ladder
[46:53] which reached from the Heavens to Earth
[46:57] and the angels descending is
[47:04] now I say I say this
[47:36] [Music]
[47:44] that produced
[47:57] the ultimate portal
[48:00] Tommy says something
[48:02] when I look at the cross I look like
[48:05] through the cross
[48:06] I'm looking through the portal
[48:10] can we can we uh can we play that that
[48:13] uh tape please momentum
[48:20] look at the cross
[48:23] you know they they felt that they had to
[48:25] do
[48:26] certain things
[48:30] so they saw grief and pain and sorrow
[48:39] but I don't see the cross
[48:43] you don't see the crossbar parents
[48:47] I see through the cross
[48:51] through the cross is the promises
[48:56] if you see to the Cross
[48:59] you see pain and grief
[49:02] but you see through the cross
[49:05] you see joy and happiness
[49:09] you see the promises you see the best of
[49:13] God the trust of God wasn't on the cross
[49:16] the best of God
[49:21] what I see but when
[49:24] the best of God was through the cross
[49:27] turn around and look at your name
[49:31] look at the best of God that's the best
[49:34] of God Amen if I ask if if I ask brother
[49:37] Benji
[49:38] who's your better half
[49:41] you're gonna say well your wife says
[49:49] that's tremendous but we gotta hit this
[49:53] point here
[49:54] because you look at you you just turn
[49:56] around and looked at everybody
[49:59] and we saw that ladder that was going to
[50:01] heaven
[50:03] and we saw the Angels ascending and
[50:05] descending
[50:06] what are they descending to I don't
[50:09] understand that picture that you put up
[50:11] is
[50:11] none other than what's called a double
[50:13] helix
[50:16] double helix so the double helix is the
[50:19] DNA stranded
[50:22] is it a coincidence that it looks like
[50:24] that spiral ladder yeah
[50:28] I see you see it shows the portal
[50:32] but it's showing you where he's gonna be
[50:36] watch the scripture what's the scripture
[50:38] first John 4 1. beloved
[50:44] believe not every spirit
[50:46] but try the spirits where they're there
[50:48] of God because many false prophets are
[50:50] gone into the world
[50:52] espiritus
[50:54] is
[50:59] the spirit of God
[51:03] is
[51:04] watch this every spirit that does not
[51:07] confess that Jesus is coming the flesh
[51:13] Jesus come in the flesh is of God
[51:17] and every spirit that confesses
[51:21] that Jesus Christ Has Come In the Flesh
[51:27] and this is the spirit of antichrist yes
[51:30] you see he's showing you the process now
[51:35] because God was manifested In the Flesh
[51:39] in Jesus Christ the scripture doesn't
[51:42] say that
[51:44] the scriptures now says
[51:47] that Jesus now has come in flesh
[51:51] so the question is
[51:53] as Jesus come in your flesh is
[52:02] foreign
[52:41] hate it when you call me Lance man
[52:46] she'll do it 15 years later you still do
[52:49] it yeah
[52:55] but when I look at Brother Carlos when I
[52:59] look at brother Jerry
[53:00] and I look at the Christ in them
[53:04] there's a connection there
[53:06] not even a razor blade can get
[53:10] I remember our founding pastures
[53:15] he said what is it that you love about
[53:18] me
[53:22] and our Pastor said while he said a few
[53:25] different answers I believe
[53:27] um
[53:32] and he said but there's nothing like
[53:35] that I love more than the Christ that
[53:37] lives inside of you know
[53:49] maybe we need more of looking through
[53:52] the cross at one another
[53:55] as opposed to as opposed to just at one
[53:58] another right
[54:00] remember brother he said well you see a
[54:04] beautiful woman
[54:05] walking down that I put across there
[54:10] when I looked that beautiful woman
[54:12] I look at the cross
[54:17] keeping that in mind
[54:20] remember it's not it's not Nails scarred
[54:23] hands
[54:24] it's scarred men and women
[54:29] that's looking through the cross
[54:33] bringing it to today
[54:35] bringing it to now Inner Space
[54:38] has he come into your flesh this is
[54:45] and put in the the picture of our
[54:48] Prophet there is
[54:50] I want to show you the the Heavenly and
[54:53] the Earth
[55:05] and see how that portal was wide open
[55:09] all the God was important to Christ
[55:14] amen all he was important to Christ
[55:18] all the Christ was important to the
[55:20] church
[55:21] so we see in that picture of the
[55:23] emptying out into into this man
[55:27] and through his
[56:23] let me ask you this yes sir can you say
[56:26] that that remember through that
[56:28] condensation
[56:29] condensation through all of God pouring
[56:32] from one to the other to the other right
[56:36] could that be portals opening up
[56:39] that's why he preached doors and doors
[56:48] let me prove it to you did it stay in
[56:51] brother Branham
[56:53] if you did we're lost
[56:56] we saw now how we went to the apostles
[57:01] you see man like brother Bernie
[57:05] hermano Tomas are founding pastors
[57:17] the condensation of God
[57:20] all the Christ was
[57:22] going out to these men
[57:25] and now these men interns
[57:53] the portal never stops
[57:56] that portal that that portal it just
[57:59] keeps opening
[58:02] you see you didn't even mention this
[58:04] word forget it
[58:08] he laid his head
[58:10] so he rested on that Revelation
[58:14] Revelation he rested on his head
[58:19] the Revelation was on the head
[58:23] remember the Gateway Babylon and Babel
[58:29] was man's ideas trying to reach
[58:34] they didn't have leadership
[58:37] tried no had a perverted a perverted
[58:40] method right absolutely amen amen so we
[58:44] see remember first base right Jesus
[58:48] Christ he's all in all he's he's the
[58:51] whole thing he's the whole reason
[58:54] right second base you have the prophet
[58:58] all that God was he poured oh look
[59:02] Third Base your pastor the ministry
[59:06] ministerio we become portals
[59:09] and this is where it gets really
[59:11] interesting
[59:13] because it doesn't stop there church
[59:17] that portal does not stop
[59:21] it didn't stop at brother Brown
[59:27] there's an ongoing thing that
[59:42] to become the portal
[59:45] it becomes it becometh all of us
[59:50] to fulfill that part of God
[59:53] to fulfill that action of God that he
[59:56] started in the beginning
[59:59] which was to become the ultimate portal
[1:00:04] to become the doorway to someone
[1:00:08] who became the doorway to someone
[1:00:12] who became the doorway to someone
[1:00:16] and so on and so on Brother Carlos is is
[1:00:20] that why Hermanos when when Christ lives
[1:00:23] inside of you
[1:00:24] and you go into a home that's maybe
[1:00:27] broken or having a hard time
[1:00:57] because our human Minds the first thing
[1:00:59] that we process with that statement is
[1:01:04] I'm gonna go create a planet right next
[1:01:06] to Mars
[1:01:09] but it doesn't have nothing to do with
[1:01:11] that
[1:01:13] it means that I can create a world here
[1:01:19] because Having the Holy Spirit is having
[1:01:21] full control of this
[1:01:25] you walk into a rough situation
[1:01:29] and then have the ability
[1:01:32] to use God's creative Powers
[1:01:37] through the portal of Jesus Christ
[1:01:41] and become a portal to those people
[1:01:45] to look through the cross
[1:01:48] and bring life and peace
[1:01:58] man
[1:02:32] that's what we have to be today
[1:02:35] so that's what the whole process of the
[1:02:37] individual of cleaning out these
[1:02:39] channels like you've heard is
[1:02:44] preach those messages
[1:02:49] that's the issue that we have that holds
[1:02:51] us back
[1:02:53] is those our channels are so clogged
[1:02:56] with so many things
[1:02:58] our own portal absolutely
[1:03:01] what what what what portals right we're
[1:03:04] a true iron Bean right right so what
[1:03:06] what are our books
[1:03:22] affection conscience consensus
[1:03:25] imagination imagination
[1:03:27] uh to the soul it's just either Faith or
[1:03:31] doubt
[1:03:32] so now as we as we start to bring this
[1:03:35] down
[1:03:37] and we start to see God coming all the
[1:03:41] way down to the individuals
[1:03:45] then we start to to get an understanding
[1:03:48] of of what happens inside of us
[1:03:53] and brother Jerry alluded to to the
[1:03:56] conscience and subconscious
[1:04:00] bro Jerry can you can you tell us a
[1:04:03] little bit about why a prophet is so
[1:04:04] special
[1:04:06] um
[1:04:08] what we know for him to have a vision
[1:04:14] right he's always he's in that and he
[1:04:17] can be in two places at once
[1:04:21] that's why there's this thing going
[1:04:23] around on the internet
[1:04:25] where they say they brother Brandon
[1:04:28] blind gay recently because he was he
[1:04:31] hunting javelinas
[1:04:34] or with you where the cloud was right
[1:04:38] it's simple it's simple he was in two
[1:04:41] Dimensions at once
[1:04:43] so I don't know what the what the deal
[1:04:46] is
[1:04:49] a simple one right number one I think we
[1:04:51] have seen that like the first night this
[1:04:53] question came up
[1:04:55] but you see the you see the portals
[1:04:57] right yeah go ahead as far as the sub uh
[1:05:00] the conscience the subconscious
[1:05:03] you know and I don't know why I felt
[1:05:06] like saying this but but
[1:05:08] I remember brother Tommy once saying
[1:05:12] be careful
[1:05:14] he said be very careful
[1:05:17] and who you dream about
[1:05:22] because your contact you you may start
[1:05:25] to contact their theophany
[1:05:30] man so so you see you see the things
[1:05:33] that a lot of times we don't understand
[1:05:35] why do we why do we have maybe bad
[1:05:39] dreams
[1:05:40] why do we dream things that we that we
[1:05:43] that we we do sometimes
[1:05:46] and as you as you start to see this
[1:05:50] these portals unfold
[1:05:53] you start to get a glimpse of the
[1:05:56] dimensions
[1:05:58] and and so as as you see them these
[1:06:02] different portals and these different
[1:06:03] things that open and I mean
[1:06:08] you start to understand
[1:06:10] hang on a minute
[1:06:12] there's there's there's things that
[1:06:15] influence
[1:06:17] there's things that affect us
[1:06:19] that that are that are Beyond this world
[1:06:22] they're Supernatural is
[1:06:24] and you start to understand that that
[1:06:28] you know we have these dreams we have
[1:06:30] Vision
[1:06:32] sometimes we we travel
[1:06:35] I I like just share an experience that I
[1:06:37] had and this was years ago
[1:06:41] I'd share this with our pastor
[1:06:44] and uh this is regarding uh uh the fifth
[1:06:47] Dimensions
[1:06:50] I fell asleep and
[1:06:53] uh I woke up in this place
[1:07:08] and
[1:07:12] he had three creatures uh running after
[1:07:15] him yeah
[1:07:19] now picture this okay
[1:07:23] picture yourself running a full Sprint
[1:07:25] from here to your car oh
[1:07:30] okay from here to there you're gonna be
[1:07:32] tired
[1:07:34] that place you're in a full I remember
[1:07:37] being there and
[1:07:38] I said wow there's levels to this place
[1:07:41] is
[1:07:46] these creatures just after them and and
[1:07:48] yeah
[1:07:51] and uh it's a place you know I don't
[1:07:54] care what you're going through uh um
[1:07:57] it's a place that you don't want to yeah
[1:08:01] it's a place where a nightmare never
[1:08:03] ends
[1:08:06] I remember it being so hot in this place
[1:08:10] and knowing that I was only at a first
[1:08:12] level
[1:08:14] but it being so hot yes but I remember
[1:08:18] thinking if I could just have a little
[1:08:20] bit of water on my tongue
[1:08:24] a rich young roller yeah
[1:08:28] and I remember that this person couldn't
[1:08:31] see me
[1:08:34] but there was a little
[1:08:37] a little uh dot like this
[1:08:41] and it opened like this is
[1:08:45] a person was able to see my face
[1:08:48] and the person saw me and said
[1:08:51] so and so was my only hope now is
[1:08:57] now if I could just continue just a
[1:09:00] little bit more
[1:09:02] with that being said
[1:09:04] there's a better place
[1:09:07] there's a place that where the Saints Go
[1:09:10] Santos there's a there's a place called
[1:09:13] the sixth Dimensions
[1:09:16] I remember that and I had said this
[1:09:18] before
[1:09:21] that I had seen just some Rolling Hills
[1:09:25] and there was something that I didn't
[1:09:27] understand about about this this dream
[1:09:29] is
[1:09:31] but our pastor again not knowing what
[1:09:34] was going on
[1:09:39] I I saw sister I saw sister Viola
[1:09:43] and my dream I had said I Stay it put I
[1:09:46] didn't I didn't walk towards hernia
[1:09:50] but he was walking towards me
[1:09:54] and and again uh when she came to me she
[1:09:58] said what's the matter
[1:10:02] again I was bothered in trouble
[1:10:06] I started to tell her all these things
[1:10:09] that bother me
[1:10:17] and I remember saying well she kind of
[1:10:20] giggled and put her head up a little bit
[1:10:23] a couple times that I've been able to
[1:10:25] see her she reminds me so much of
[1:10:27] brother brother will love us
[1:10:30] and I remember her saying
[1:10:32] all those things
[1:10:36] you'll find out it really didn't matter
[1:10:40] well let me get to what I didn't
[1:10:42] understand
[1:10:45] what I didn't understand I said Lord was
[1:10:46] that dream of you or was it just
[1:10:49] whatever because
[1:10:55] humans after the after the witch of
[1:10:57] indoor and all that humans can't no
[1:10:59] contact anymore
[1:11:09] and I kept that with me for I don't know
[1:11:11] a couple years but I just a month
[1:11:16] I happen to be having lunch at brother
[1:11:18] Caleb's house
[1:11:21] and he mentioned this that I wouldn't
[1:11:24] even mention the dream but
[1:11:27] I can't remember what what part of the
[1:11:29] conversation we were in
[1:11:33] but he said brother Bernie
[1:11:36] had said
[1:11:38] Rachel he said
[1:11:41] it's one thing if you're trying to
[1:11:43] contact the dead
[1:11:47] now I know why I didn't go to school
[1:11:55] he said it's another thing when they're
[1:11:58] coming to you man
[1:12:03] so we see we see that at these portals
[1:12:07] they open
[1:12:10] but brother Jerry
[1:12:12] why is it so important that um
[1:12:16] to both our our body and investors
[1:12:20] why is it so important that then that
[1:12:23] those are are are clean and right and
[1:12:25] pure and good it's an important
[1:12:29] well it's imperative right
[1:12:32] but let's show you how so how do we get
[1:12:34] there how does that happen
[1:12:37] many different ways but to sum it up a
[1:12:40] little bit for the for the teaching here
[1:12:44] so if you put up the put up the picture
[1:12:46] of the two pyramids
[1:12:57] yeah
[1:12:58] so so I had him so so this is a message
[1:13:01] I don't recall the message okay
[1:13:04] but I have the quote brother running uh
[1:13:07] you know he gave it to me
[1:13:09] so I don't remember the message in
[1:13:11] particular
[1:13:12] but I remember this
[1:13:18] so he was talking we're not pyramid
[1:13:20] teaching
[1:13:21] the reasons
[1:13:24] because number one we know that that The
[1:13:27] Pyramid in Egypt
[1:13:30] the second Bible right and we see that
[1:13:34] the statue of a perfect band is is the
[1:13:36] pyramid shape
[1:13:41] but I found something very interesting
[1:13:43] the way he teaches it is
[1:13:49] put your spiritual caps on okay
[1:13:52] spiritual just follow me on this little
[1:13:54] journey okay
[1:13:55] he hits the stages of Grace on towards
[1:13:58] the bottom of that pyramid
[1:14:00] and it says um
[1:14:05] pictures of being there in the in both
[1:14:08] pyramids okay
[1:14:11] like if we were before them
[1:14:14] stages of Grace justification
[1:14:16] sanctification baptism of the Holy
[1:14:18] ghosts
[1:14:21] so that brings you into the pyramid and
[1:14:25] then he says are you born again
[1:14:32] you still have to climb today
[1:14:35] you still have to climb that mountains
[1:14:39] you still have to climb the statue of a
[1:14:41] person
[1:14:44] but he the way he hits it in the natural
[1:14:46] pyramid
[1:14:50] he says you enter at the base of the
[1:14:52] pyramid this is
[1:14:54] and you can look at pictures in on the
[1:14:57] internet of where they go inside the
[1:14:58] pyramid
[1:15:01] he says but you go up a little bit
[1:15:04] service Poco
[1:15:06] and he says there's a little shaft there
[1:15:08] like a little window
[1:15:10] you can see the star there is
[1:15:13] and he says I'll read it to you if I had
[1:15:18] a Blackboard
[1:15:21] I would I would put a pyramid here
[1:15:26] and I will show you the stars
[1:15:30] that brings light to the passageway
[1:15:34] is but I would also show you
[1:15:39] a turning of a corner
[1:15:42] where no more stars
[1:15:44] [Music]
[1:15:46] where there's no more they're a star
[1:15:49] Estrella but it comes to a place
[1:15:51] where the person entering into the
[1:15:54] chamber
[1:15:55] entrance of the king Del Rey when the
[1:15:59] person enters into this chain
[1:16:02] he doesn't see a story anymore
[1:16:06] Guided by like a magnet is
[1:16:09] so I wonder what pulls that Capstone
[1:16:11] down
[1:16:15] excuse me
[1:16:17] but pulling him towards that chamber
[1:16:21] in other words it's an instinct inside
[1:16:25] of him already
[1:16:30] let me let me read this uh this um these
[1:16:32] other ones I got to get this point out
[1:16:34] really quick
[1:16:35] so he you see we enter into the pyramid
[1:16:39] we're going through the steps of a
[1:16:41] perfectness
[1:16:43] you get to the point where we can see
[1:16:45] the profit
[1:16:48] but if you stay there
[1:16:50] well I mean we always have number one
[1:16:52] it's Christ in all things
[1:16:56] it's Christ in all things
[1:17:00] if you stay just with your eye on just
[1:17:03] the profit
[1:17:06] you're going to end up in outer space uh
[1:18:10] but now think of this in an individual
[1:18:13] mode
[1:18:15] on an individual level
[1:18:19] each person each individual Persona has
[1:18:22] to climb the mountains
[1:18:24] to get to the king's chamber uh
[1:18:29] so the angel of the church
[1:18:35] and right there there's an angel
[1:18:38] let me ask you a question is
[1:18:43] I'm talking about personally to you now
[1:18:48] the individual
[1:18:50] the only one I see is
[1:18:54] so this Angel of the church
[1:18:57] brings you to the realization
[1:19:01] because climbing the status
[1:19:04] these channels we get to get unclogged
[1:19:07] right
[1:19:09] and we began to see how natural now
[1:20:10] to the fourth mentioned
[1:20:14] we're gonna we're gonna enter in
[1:20:16] Dimensions right at the fourth dimension
[1:20:19] and why people because that's the
[1:20:22] dimension
[1:20:23] that pertains to us
[1:20:25] and right now there's a squatter on our
[1:20:29] land
[1:20:33] there's a there's a squatter on our
[1:20:35] property
[1:20:39] Satan has control of that fourth
[1:20:41] dimension
[1:20:43] that fourth dimension is
[1:20:45] where you find all the different
[1:20:48] television waves
[1:20:52] all the different you know all the
[1:20:54] different wavelengths and frequencies
[1:20:55] they run through that Dimension
[1:20:59] but notice that that when you when you
[1:21:02] dream and you have a nightmare
[1:21:07] that portal opens up
[1:21:11] and you contact the fourth dimension
[1:21:15] all the different all the different
[1:21:17] horror movies
[1:21:20] and all the junk that you see on TV and
[1:21:23] all that comes out
[1:21:26] all the junk that you see on YouTube and
[1:21:28] all those different things
[1:21:32] it's because there's somebody there
[1:21:35] that's opening a portal
[1:21:39] and they understand how to do it
[1:21:42] they understand how to get into that
[1:21:44] Dimension
[1:21:46] and how to how to pull down all of those
[1:21:50] influences
[1:21:52] and then they take them and they turn
[1:21:55] them into movies and they turn them in
[1:21:56] the books yeah they turn them in all
[1:21:57] these things
[1:22:03] uh I remember in high school
[1:22:07] I had a I had a teacher
[1:22:10] Maestro he was like a retired military
[1:22:13] way up there
[1:22:14] foreign
[1:22:27] [Laughter]
[1:22:42] in a nutshell he just said if we know
[1:22:44] this much in the military
[1:22:47] he said we know that voices travel
[1:22:50] around the world
[1:22:53] and we're so Advanced
[1:22:56] that our top secret weapons he goes and
[1:22:59] he goes you guys won't believe me
[1:23:20] but we're afraid
[1:23:24] so so we we see this this fourth
[1:23:27] dimension
[1:23:29] and every time that either brother
[1:23:31] Branham or our founding Pastor is
[1:23:34] they always describe it as a faster
[1:23:37] Dimensions
[1:23:40] it's so much faster than we could ever
[1:23:42] comprehend is
[1:23:45] but what I really want to get to in the
[1:23:47] time that we have left is
[1:23:49] again we think of when we talk about
[1:23:52] Dimensions
[1:23:54] we think I'm outerworldly we think of
[1:23:57] outer space
[1:23:58] but I want you to know
[1:24:01] if one of us has a fourth dimension
[1:24:04] inside of us
[1:24:07] so the question is what is in our fourth
[1:24:10] dimension
[1:24:13] right it's not the television that's the
[1:24:15] problem
[1:24:17] it's what we channel
[1:24:20] it's not the internet that's the issue
[1:24:23] it's what
[1:24:38] and you type in your search
[1:24:42] and you open that portal
[1:24:44] and you can open the fourth dimension
[1:24:47] and you can look straight into that
[1:24:50] place
[1:24:51] so going back to the Statue of a perfect
[1:24:54] man
[1:25:27] again we keep we keep thinking outer
[1:25:30] space right
[1:25:31] we keep thinking in the future
[1:25:37] but casting Satan down from the fourth
[1:25:39] dimension
[1:25:40] is a daily thing
[1:25:44] [Music]
[1:25:46] it's every hour
[1:25:48] every minute every second that's why the
[1:25:52] Bible says You Gotta Fight for every
[1:25:56] inch of ground
[1:25:59] because every step you take
[1:26:02] that fourth dimension gets a little
[1:26:04] closer
[1:26:06] because when when the when when the
[1:26:10] Bible says that we'll meet him in the
[1:26:11] air
[1:26:14] it's not talking about somewhere out
[1:26:16] there in space
[1:26:18] it's talking about that fourth dimension
[1:26:22] that's the place that belongs to us this
[1:26:25] is the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:26:28] and it become with us
[1:26:30] to evict the squatter
[1:26:34] every day
[1:26:36] every minute every hour so
[1:26:40] I guess to sum it up guys
[1:26:44] keep your portals clean
[1:26:47] keep your channels clean
[1:26:53] that you are a clean portal
[1:26:58] that you can become a clean portal
[1:27:02] to someone else because that's what
[1:27:06] Jesus Christ came to do
[1:27:09] amen amen
[1:27:13] man let us stand
[1:27:16] oh I'm sorry no please hold on hold on
[1:27:19] hold on we got some it just got good now
[1:27:23] it would not be complete
[1:27:26] if the portal of the church
[1:27:32] hey hey
[1:27:34] [Applause]
[1:27:39] all I can say is wow look at places
[1:27:41] that's good stuff
[1:27:44] you know I I there's not a whole lot I
[1:27:46] mean you can say a few things but
[1:27:48] there's to add to what was said it's no
[1:27:50] it's the president
[1:27:54] put a cherry on the top
[1:27:57] the Bible says in Matthew the seventh
[1:28:00] chapter
[1:28:04] it's so important to understand this is
[1:28:07] the Bible says enter ye in at the
[1:28:12] Straight Gate
[1:28:15] this portal that we're talking about
[1:28:18] the Holy Ghost is that portal
[1:28:22] now it says entering at the Straight
[1:28:25] Gate
[1:28:27] for wide is the gate
[1:28:29] and Broad is the way that leadth to
[1:28:32] destruction
[1:28:34] and many there be that will go there
[1:28:38] because straight is the gate
[1:28:42] and narrow is the way
[1:28:45] which leads unto life
[1:28:48] and few there be that will find it
[1:28:52] you're gonna find that this is
[1:28:54] tremendous tremendous now now this is
[1:28:57] what I was just telling the telling
[1:28:59] these men and and while they're they're
[1:29:01] they are capable more than capable of of
[1:29:03] uh of dealing and And discussing this
[1:29:06] this subject is
[1:29:10] but I I said I want you to notice how
[1:29:13] the Dimensions change
[1:29:16] if you're in a certain place something
[1:29:20] can be one-dimensional
[1:29:22] you start getting into different places
[1:29:27] four dimensions
[1:29:29] but but this is this is what we're
[1:29:32] getting now is that as they were
[1:29:34] speaking about Jacob's Ladder
[1:29:37] the Bible says that that ladder was from
[1:29:42] and Angels ascending yeah
[1:29:46] now that's what the scripture says but
[1:29:49] if you notice there is only one other
[1:29:52] place
[1:29:55] there is only one other place
[1:29:58] in the in the whole scripture that talks
[1:30:01] about angels ascending and descending
[1:30:06] and that is in the New Testament yes and
[1:30:09] this is this is the scripture if you
[1:30:10] want to write it down now now just for a
[1:30:13] moment I'm not going to keep you long
[1:30:14] but but it happened when when Philip
[1:30:19] went to call Nathaniel
[1:30:21] Felipe and he says he says he he comes
[1:30:25] back and he's and he says well
[1:30:26] Nathaniel's saying anything good come
[1:30:28] out of Nazareth
[1:30:31] are you serious
[1:30:33] the main portal came
[1:30:38] so he gave him the best answer that he
[1:30:40] could give anyone was come and see
[1:30:43] you want to see what came out of
[1:30:45] Nazareth
[1:30:49] and there he begins to tell him and he
[1:30:53] says how did you know me
[1:31:16] and then he added this is John 1 and
[1:31:20] it's 47-51 but you can you can read it
[1:31:22] when you get home
[1:31:23] and then he added verily truly I tell
[1:31:26] you
[1:31:27] you will see Heaven open
[1:31:31] and the angels of God ascending and
[1:31:35] descending
[1:31:36] not from Heaven to Earth anymore
[1:31:39] you'll see Angels ascending and
[1:31:42] descending but now
[1:31:44] it's a descending on the son of man
[1:31:53] it was always that you would go to a
[1:31:56] certain place
[1:31:58] every civilization has for those places
[1:32:06] but when Jesus Christ it wasn't any
[1:32:09] specific Place anymore
[1:32:12] because the portal now was from heaven
[1:32:15] and you'll see them descending on the
[1:32:18] son of man now
[1:32:19] he's not coming to this earth it's
[1:32:21] coming to this earth now
[1:32:23] and he is the portal and that's why
[1:32:27] anywhere he went is
[1:32:31] it didn't have to be in a specific point
[1:32:34] anymore
[1:32:35] wherever he is
[1:32:38] if he dwells in you then you become
[1:32:43] now now it didn't stop there though I'll
[1:32:47] get going I won't stop looking lucky but
[1:32:49] I'll just I'm just gonna end with this
[1:32:51] then
[1:32:52] when else was those angels ascending and
[1:32:55] descending when else was
[1:32:59] simply if he says it'll they'll descend
[1:33:02] on the son of man
[1:33:04] and the son of man was revealed again in
[1:33:08] our time
[1:33:09] in a prophet and that's why February 28
[1:33:13] 1963 an angel an Earthly Angel
[1:33:18] send it on high from
[1:33:22] eternity
[1:33:23] came seven angels and they met together
[1:33:27] they were descending upon the son of man
[1:33:33] God bless you
[1:33:39] we were able to cheat just a little bit
[1:33:42] less
[1:33:48] [Applause]
[1:34:09] thank you
[1:34:11] [Music]
[1:34:22] amen God bless his word this evening
