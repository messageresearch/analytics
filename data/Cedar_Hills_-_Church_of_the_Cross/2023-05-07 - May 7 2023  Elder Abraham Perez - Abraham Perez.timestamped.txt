[24:38] [Applause]
[25:04] God bless you
[25:07] um God placed on my heart a inspiration
[25:11] for a poem last weekend and I just
[25:14] wanted to share with you a little bit of
[25:17] the testimony behind it
[25:20] um but I'll thank you and when I was 21
[25:24] I made this decision to give my heart to
[25:27] God and when I did I fell in love with
[25:29] God the message his people and I
[25:32] couldn't get enough of the word I would
[25:34] read message book after message book and
[25:37] it was a new life for me I had lived a
[25:40] very worldly life behind my parents back
[25:42] so when I came to know God and this
[25:45] message it was life transforming for me
[25:48] these past few years I felt myself dying
[25:51] due to many things in life but we truly
[25:54] make a choice in life we have to make
[25:56] that choice and God has an appointed
[25:58] time for us
[26:00] during our prayer last Saturday I was
[26:02] founding myself with the church calendar
[26:04] and as I looked at it it read the day I
[26:07] died and that was a revelation that hit
[26:10] me
[26:12] and on Saturday as our pastor led us in
[26:14] prayer he said we first need to empty
[26:16] ourselves out of everything and as I
[26:19] knelt down I told God this is the day I
[26:22] die
[26:23] and I went through everything that so
[26:25] easily beset me I made the decision just
[26:28] as the eagle has to in its 40th year it
[26:31] makes the decision to go up to the
[26:33] mountain
[26:36] and pound his beak on the Rock to take
[26:38] off all the build up on its Beak from
[26:40] years so it can live again
[26:42] and I had to make that choice too I had
[26:45] to go to The Rock The Rock of Ages and
[26:47] die out to myself so he can live in me
[26:49] again
[26:51] last Sunday we visited in Silver City
[26:53] and brother Eli Castillo was preaching
[26:56] and we went to see our family
[26:58] and that's when God
[27:00] inspired this poem to me so I I hope it
[27:02] blesses you
[27:05] it's 25 years too long to Tarry don't
[27:08] turn from side to side take one step at
[27:11] a time
[27:12] but what if starting down at the bottom
[27:14] looking up seems too long of a weight
[27:17] just take the step you'll be closer for
[27:20] each step I take is mine it's possession
[27:22] each and every step
[27:24] each step was different there were
[27:26] victories laughter and joy days and
[27:30] steps sometimes even seemed filled with
[27:32] losses tears weary and even falling down
[27:35] but I have an appointed time a time
[27:38] where I receive my victory victory in
[27:41] God the footsteps of the righteous are
[27:43] ordained do not stop walking press
[27:46] toward the high Mark forget the things
[27:48] of the past for God is our victory
[27:57] thank you
[28:29] God bless you all
[28:32] so I heard for the brand I'm singing
[28:35] this song actually
[28:37] this past week and I kept listening to
[28:39] it and I fell in love with it
[28:41] because it reminded me of that dream
[28:43] that brother Enzo had of my grandma that
[28:45] she told us
[28:47] if you could just look past the curtain
[28:49] of time you would see that all of this
[28:50] is so small on it
[28:56] and that's been that's been a real good
[28:58] help to me lately so I pray that this
[29:00] song blesses you all

[31:16] touch me

[42:13] you get prepared to go to school
[42:17] you well there's so many things
[42:20] prepared repairs
[42:23] I remember a couple of years ago
[42:27] they had told me to go official
[42:32] a funeral
[42:37] and it was nothing but Catholics around
[42:41] me
[42:44] I had no backing from nobody because it
[42:47] was
[42:49] Sabrina
[42:58] anyway uh
[43:02] four days what rodeos
[43:05] before she passed away
[43:09] they put her in hospice
[43:14] and she told me that she wanted me to
[43:16] officiate her funeral
[43:21] so when the day came when she passed
[43:24] away
[43:31] and it says the service will be in Holy
[43:34] Cross Catholic Church
[43:39] and the prison was officiating
[43:45] was stressed you know in a white robe
[43:49] and the big cross and all the things
[43:51] ornaments that those priests put on
[43:54] themselves
[44:01] when they took the body to the cemetery
[44:06] I said at least I'm gonna officiate here
[44:12] it's not so much because I've officiated
[44:16] a lot of funerals
[44:19] it's because it's a best time to throw
[44:26] them
[44:47] he's not even the devil wants me before
[44:53] anyway when we got to the cemetery
[44:59] I said well at least I'm going to speak
[45:00] here they have problems
[45:08] and another Catholic priest got down
[45:15] a big heavy set priest this one was not
[45:19] dressed in white he was dressed in black
[45:21] Grande is
[45:25] about a mile long because
[45:30] and he got there and talked and when he
[45:33] was through you know he starts you know
[45:36] how they sprinkle on the caskets
[45:41] oh my God I was burning I wanted to get
[45:45] in you know

[46:00] my nephew give me sobrino
[46:03] he said wait a minute
[46:06] yeah my uncle wants to speak
[46:13] foreign
[46:31] everyone from the church was backing him
[46:33] up backing me up
[46:40] I got up there
[46:42] and I knew a lot of these Catholic not
[46:46] all of them but I appeared
[46:50] and the problem is
[46:57] when Moses came down from the mountains
[47:02] he had to put a veil over his face
[47:07] glory of God shining because he had been
[47:10] with God for 40 days and 40 nights
[47:19] the scripture says
[47:23] uh
[47:25] with a community
[47:32] there is a no man that has honor in his
[47:35] own home yeah oh no

[48:42] you buy insurance for your car
[48:47] you buy insurance for your house
[48:50] you buy insurance to put you in the
[48:53] grave compress
[48:56] I'm giving you insurance to take you out
[49:00] of the grace
[49:07] but you know what
[49:08] you tell them what scriptural well
[49:14] and then it goes one year and comes out
[49:16] the other entrepreneur
[49:19] let me ask a question
[49:21] how many of you were in the Boy Scouts
[49:27] Boy Scout
[49:30] s
[49:36] don't you know nothing about Boy Scouts
[49:39] ah
[49:42] yeah
[49:45] we're still here though the Boy Scouts
[49:48] had a little badge here they said be
[49:52] prepared right
[49:59] but nobody prepared more than the Apache
[50:02] Indians
[50:04] Los Indios Apache because the United
[50:06] States Cavalry on one side is
[50:12] a Mexican Army on the other side
[50:16] we're always after them
[50:19] when a boy was born
[50:23] they dried the naval chord uh
[50:28] foreign
[51:30] nurses
[51:35] and then later they went to a
[51:39] higher Mountain it is
[51:42] preparing them for Wars
[51:45] the enemy was after them
[51:51] in the winter time
[51:54] they have to take a bath on the Cold
[51:58] Stream
[52:01] not only for cleanliness
[52:05] but to harm their bodies
[52:18] and then the final one final
[52:24] because
[52:27] and they had to take
[52:29] water in their mouth
[52:33] and not follow it
[52:35] and they made them run up a hill
[52:42] and come back and with the water still
[52:46] in their mouths
[52:55] look we have our mouth dry and and we
[52:58] drink that we would drink that water you
[53:00] know why
[53:01] because we breathe through
[53:04] out
[53:14] I wake up with my throat dry in the
[53:16] morning
[53:20] I hear you snoring from the other room
[53:24] foreign
[53:49] Daniel 9 2 Danielle nuevos
[53:57] in the first year of his Reign I Daniel
[54:00] understood by books the number of years
[54:10] el numero
[54:12] thank God
[54:16] Emilio then we had the best book in this
[54:21] church
[54:25] too bad that he's
[54:27] very sick right now we inform our arita
[54:31] but
[54:33] he was an open book
[54:36] around the world
[54:40] foreign
[55:18] I could venture to say
[55:23] is the way the world is going all the
[55:27] politics and all the evil while Mundo
[55:30] and La political malignant I would
[55:33] venture to say that we don't have two
[55:35] more years to go adventurous
[55:43] that's not God says the Lord
[55:47] I'm just you know by studying and by
[55:50] seeing World politics and everything bro
[55:52] foreign
[55:57] to get prepared
[56:01] this is a message of preparations
[56:08] Saint Matthew
[56:11] 24 3 Mateo
[56:16] and as he said upon the Mount of Olives
[56:19] the disciples came unto him privately
[56:22] saying tell us when shall these things
[56:25] be what shall be the sign of thy coming
[56:28] and of the end of the world is
[56:43] verse 14
[56:46] and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be
[56:50] preached in all the world for a witness
[56:53] unto all nations and then shall the end
[56:57] to come is
[57:05] this
[57:16] the word has been preached
[57:20] [Applause]
[57:21] in the times
[57:23] of of Wesley
[57:26] Wesley they had an open door
[57:31] open door
[57:34] hearing the word
[57:39] for a lot of things
[57:46] yes
[57:56] but that's not the gospel is
[57:59] that is just Christian you know what
[58:03] they how they believe the world uh
[58:08] I told her Jehovah witnessed
[58:13] I told him that God had healed me from
[58:17] cancer
[58:21] they don't believe
[58:23] Divina
[58:31] I would quit and go find me a one
[58:33] because
[58:39] the Bible says Jesus Christ the same
[58:42] yesterday today and forever
[58:57] tell me one thing or another number
[59:02] so then entonces
[59:06] there was another Open Door via
[59:10] there was another Open Door
[59:14] John was in the Isle of Patmos
[59:18] and the Lord said
[59:21] I cannot tell you
[59:24] what I need to tell because you're still
[59:26] down there in the earth
[59:32] in a Partners all with all the snakes
[59:35] and the Scorpions and lizards scorpions
[59:46] anyway don't say
[59:48] you know
[59:50] when you be preached all over the world
[59:55] and there'll be rumors of wars and Wars
[1:00:02] in 1906
[1:00:05] the Holy Ghost came
[1:00:09] the Revival lasted three years
[1:00:13] but the people refused it
[1:00:17] and God sent the plague
[1:00:22] Espanol
[1:00:25] the Spanish blue
[1:00:27] Millions died Millions
[1:00:34] Brothers
[1:00:37] I believe we are in the preparation of
[1:00:41] the last destruction this world will
[1:00:44] ever know hello
[1:00:50] God doesn't call a man to judgment
[1:00:53] without first warning him
[1:01:01] because before a coming judgment
[1:01:07] there is a preparation mate preparation
[1:01:12] God cannot send destruction
[1:01:16] until people get into the spirit of the
[1:01:20] last days
[1:01:27] it has to be a spirit of destruction
[1:01:32] and God not send a prophet is
[1:01:41] because the the Revival in Azusa
[1:01:46] Lester from 1906 to 1909
[1:01:52] and in 19090s when the prophet was born
[1:01:58] and brothers
[1:02:02] is a sign of preparation
[1:02:06] as we have been one
[1:02:11] what is going to happen
[1:02:14] and I say to you people this morning
[1:02:22] and
[1:02:24] it it is
[1:02:29] where is it going to come from
[1:02:33] you either reply or you're gonna cry
[1:02:39] what is going to happen
[1:02:44] from the book of naom I think I never
[1:02:47] said from this book
[1:02:55] chapter one
[1:02:57] foreign
[1:03:48] in the Bible the most famous river that
[1:03:51] you face is getting brighter and
[1:03:53] brighter
[1:03:55] this is
[1:03:58] even the lakes are all getting dry
[1:04:04] and uh flower of Lebanon language
[1:04:21] and the hills melt
[1:04:24] s and the ear is burned and his presence
[1:04:37] who can stand before his indignation
[1:04:43] and who can abide by the pureness of his
[1:04:46] anger
[1:04:49] his pure is long
[1:05:00] we're gonna find out where the heat is
[1:05:03] going to fry those that are not prepared
[1:05:10] that's why you come to church
[1:05:13] and those tremendous messages that the
[1:05:16] pastor has brought us yes tremendous
[1:05:21] we all should be prepared
[1:05:25] my brother now who's real sick
[1:05:30] he told us in Silver City youth that
[1:05:34] we're in Silver City you heard this
[1:05:36] is
[1:05:45] there should not be no foolish virgins
[1:05:48] in this congregations
[1:05:58] like he said
[1:06:00] but it's better
[1:06:02] to be a foolish person then
[1:06:09] brother Branham says
[1:06:12] I'm not saying that none of the summer
[1:06:14] you're a foolish versions
[1:06:23] should be glad
[1:06:27] there is an atomic bomb atomic
[1:06:33] why did he say that
[1:06:36] you don't have to go through that great
[1:06:38] tribulations
[1:06:47] amen amen oh we're gonna find out where
[1:06:50] that heat is coming from
[1:06:53] you give me your utmost attention
[1:06:57] the sun deposit
[1:07:01] 342 watts of energy
[1:07:08] what's the energy into every square
[1:07:11] meter of the Earth
[1:07:15] where does the sun's heat go
[1:07:20] why is it the whole Earth heart
[1:07:25] [Music]
[1:07:28] because most of the sun's head is
[1:07:31] deposited into the Tropics of the Earth
[1:07:38] this is because the Earth rotational
[1:07:41] axis is
[1:07:47] almost perfect
[1:07:53] perpendicular means perpendicular
[1:07:55] significa upright rectal vertical
[1:07:59] vertical
[1:08:01] trade-off or direction
[1:08:03] to the plane of Earth's orbit around the
[1:08:08] sun alplano Del orbital
[1:08:11] Del Sol
[1:08:14] I know I'm gonna lose some of you here
[1:08:16] okay
[1:08:19] but if it was a movie in the theater you
[1:08:22] wouldn't lose one second of it
[1:08:28] take the cobwebs out of your mind your
[1:08:31] brain
[1:08:34] is
[1:08:37] more important than anything else is
[1:08:52] the polar latitude the latitude
[1:08:57] receive far less sunlight receiving
[1:09:01] menus loose Del Sol
[1:09:03] get off of you
[1:09:06] look at this butterfly they received far
[1:09:08] less sunlight than the equal receiving
[1:09:11] men
[1:09:15] always wonder why the equator is so hot
[1:09:18] and the poles are so cold
[1:09:25] it is
[1:09:32] they were exactly
[1:09:34] perpendicular
[1:09:35] perpendicular to the orbit plane around
[1:09:39] the Sun alplano orbital Del Sol there
[1:09:51] a spring primavera
[1:09:58] Verano the climate in January
[1:10:03] would be the same as in July
[1:10:07] all over the years
[1:10:12] says the road tasty foreign
[1:11:03] A Day In Summer under
[1:11:09] latitude in Latitude polar receive most
[1:11:14] almost as much solar as the tropics
[1:11:18] tropicos
[1:11:23] and you don't have to tell me I
[1:11:25] experienced that when I was stationed
[1:11:27] two years in Alaska yeah
[1:11:33] is
[1:12:01] I have never
[1:12:05] so from
[1:12:09] because
[1:12:34] and last year
[1:12:38] very poor because of the Heat
[1:12:44] but people hardly go out no more so they
[1:12:46] will know
[1:12:53] and uh my brothers Danny and Tommy is
[1:12:59] we were so poor is
[1:13:03] we have no toys to play with
[1:13:06] we even played
[1:13:08] with my sister Ruth and my other sisters
[1:13:14] in the wintertime
[1:13:16] there were no televisions
[1:13:20] you know what we would play
[1:13:23] my mother had those you know
[1:13:26] those are like rings of aluminum that
[1:13:31] they fused for her embroidery you know
[1:13:34] what I'm talking about
[1:13:37] and we put bottles
[1:13:43] inside the house
[1:13:50] Xboxes or Xbox cell phones they're well
[1:13:54] not even a regular phone regular
[1:13:59] about five five six years ago
[1:14:03] I went for uh my daughter Wendy she was
[1:14:07] living in curc
[1:14:10] and in the Black Range
[1:14:16] the alternator gave out at night
[1:14:23] there was no cell phone
[1:14:27] we walked 13 miles to San Lorenzo
[1:14:33] San Lorenzo and in the that station in
[1:14:36] San Lorenzo yeah in San Lorenzo there
[1:14:39] was a phone those ones that you're gonna
[1:14:41] put Carlos at the border of time
[1:14:54] um
[1:15:05] you know foreign
[1:15:17] by the grace of God I said exactly one
[1:15:22] dollars and I call my wife
[1:15:27] two o'clock in the morning
[1:15:30] and she called my son-in-law and he came
[1:15:33] for us to San Lorenzo yeah
[1:15:36] my daughter couldn't be able to walk I'm
[1:15:38] gonna have to leave her there and walk
[1:15:40] myself
[1:15:45] but the Earth is getting hard as an oven
[1:15:53] but follow me closely
[1:15:58] notice
[1:16:00] how many would have passed through that
[1:16:04] time
[1:16:07] none of you when the Lord will pick up
[1:16:11] his right
[1:16:15] hey you will not prepared
[1:16:19] Sinister preparado if you wanna eat
[1:16:24] you're gonna have to join that
[1:16:27] Confederation of churches
[1:16:30] and you say I'll never join the Catholic
[1:16:33] Church is
[1:16:38] you're the guy you got small children
[1:16:41] and your children crying for food
[1:16:44] they're hungry
[1:16:48] and they'll give you food
[1:16:51] if you
[1:16:52] no nothing let me read something here
[1:16:56] then he hits something here
[1:17:01] Daniel
[1:17:02] 3 19. Daniel dress versus
[1:17:09] then was Nebuchadnezzar full of Fury
[1:17:15] a form of his visit was changed against
[1:17:18] cataract massage and a bad Eagle
[1:17:26] therefore his faith and commanded that
[1:17:29] they should hit the furnace one seven
[1:17:32] times more than it was
[1:17:51] but the king had already put his seal on
[1:17:55] Earth
[1:17:59] also those Holy Rollers whose boss
[1:18:02] around here is
[1:18:06] everyone that is a witness for God
[1:18:11] will have to go through fiery trials
[1:18:19] and no matter how hard it is
[1:18:23] if you are not right with God
[1:18:27] you will go to a harder place
[1:18:32] the closer you get to God
[1:18:39] foreign
[1:18:58] how can you burn fire with fire
[1:19:01] is the Holy Ghost Empire
[1:19:03] they want to throw you in the oven
[1:19:06] how can they burn fire with spiders
[1:19:13] no
[1:19:15] no
[1:19:19] we'll burn that religion out of them
[1:19:25] you will never possess the question
[1:19:30] Drake message
[1:19:32] they possessed the gates
[1:19:42] so they would not bound bow down yes
[1:19:50] hit the furnace seven times
[1:19:58] these young ministers in this
[1:20:00] congregation many times
[1:20:07] yeah just don't preach the historical
[1:20:10] God no predictions
[1:20:12] you can preach on Daniel in the Lion's
[1:20:16] denial
[1:20:17] and these Hebrew children in in the
[1:20:20] furnace yes
[1:20:23] that's okay
[1:20:26] then lifts up your face
[1:20:28] but I'm gonna bring it now to our time
[1:20:33] are you living at the same the same
[1:20:36] Spirits don't die
[1:20:40] those Spirits are still here
[1:20:43] let me tell you what brothers
[1:20:53] the time is coming again
[1:21:04] [Music]
[1:21:15] thank you is in the heat in the this
[1:21:19] world is an oven it is
[1:21:26] seven times
[1:21:42] though
[1:22:08] [Music]
[1:22:15] you read the news
[1:22:17] it's nothing but bad news
[1:22:21] do you ever read good news
[1:22:29] civilization
[1:22:30] civilization has traveled from the East
[1:22:34] to the West
[1:22:38] California
[1:22:45] this in California in California all the
[1:22:49] rubbish
[1:22:50] Austin was dumped in California
[1:22:55] and brothers
[1:22:57] this has become the says
[1:23:03] foreign
[1:23:36] and carbon dioxide carbon dioxide absorb
[1:23:40] the heat absorbent
[1:23:43] emitted from the surface
[1:23:52] and because atmospheric temperature
[1:23:55] decreases with altitude
[1:23:59] temperatures
[1:24:04] decreases
[1:24:07] the Heat and mission of the atmosphere
[1:24:12] is a much lower temperature
[1:24:18] than the surface
[1:24:20] so the earth and the atmosphere
[1:24:24] they keep heating up
[1:24:28] until the heat trapped by carbon dioxide
[1:24:31] foreign
[1:25:13] that is one of the causes of this
[1:25:16] climate change
[1:25:18] the Earth itself acts like a huge
[1:25:23] magnetism Grande
[1:25:27] the North Pole of a magnet
[1:25:31] the sixth the North Pole of the earth
[1:25:36] and the scientists are afraid
[1:25:40] that the magnetic field of the earth
[1:25:46] will reverse its direction
[1:25:51] in versa the Earth creates a magnetic
[1:25:55] field
[1:25:58] magnetic that Shields most of the
[1:26:01] habited parts of our planet
[1:26:08] from the church particles they come
[1:26:11] mostly from the Sun
[1:26:15] but without our planet's magnetic fields
[1:26:19] we know
[1:26:21] the Earth will be subject to more Cosmic
[1:26:24] radiation
[1:26:29] Cosmetics
[1:26:31] could not call power grid is
[1:26:39] would increase
[1:26:41] no the increase would knock out them
[1:26:46] and it will scramble the communication
[1:26:49] system is
[1:27:01] and what is all this yes it will affect
[1:27:05] the birds
[1:27:08] and the peace
[1:27:10] and there will be no Bees
[1:27:16] the the births and bees
[1:27:19] they rely on the Earth's magnetic fields
[1:27:27] how would a birds know like the
[1:27:29] hummingbirds they go in the winter to
[1:27:32] Mexico
[1:27:38] and come over here to the United States
[1:27:42] and they know when to turn go back
[1:27:46] how they know
[1:27:50] they need the magnetic field to navigate
[1:27:56] so I say
[1:27:57] so how did this come about
[1:28:02] there was no cold
[1:28:05] no Seasons In The Times
[1:28:09] They were more advanced in science
[1:28:11] technology
[1:28:15] but we know that history repeats itself
[1:28:25] God destroyed them
[1:28:30] in the times of Norah were destroyed the
[1:28:33] people in the world
[1:28:39] not destroyed like we but it just clings
[1:28:47] the atomic bombs
[1:28:51] and through the Earth out of orbit is
[1:28:57] [Music]
[1:29:01] which the Earth rotates rotation
[1:29:06] if they didn't mind
[1:29:10] oh which is the Earth rotates
[1:29:14] and the Earth started to Incline
[1:29:22] God had to intervene in order to give
[1:29:26] the humanity a second chance
[1:29:34] the inclination foreign
[1:30:07] neither
[1:30:09] perpendicular or horizontal
[1:30:11] perpendicular or horizontal it is the
[1:30:15] angle between the Earth's rotational
[1:30:17] axis and its orbital axis is
[1:30:25] the angle of zero
[1:30:29] the excess points in the same direction
[1:30:35] but the Earth
[1:30:41] foreign
[1:31:16] [Music]
[1:31:34] because it's losing its speed at the
[1:31:37] rate that it's going around the Sun
[1:31:39] how many of you like to play with
[1:31:42] seven days
[1:31:53] yeah
[1:31:56] children nowadays colors they don't know
[1:31:59] when we were kids we played with
[1:32:03] but now they got so much junk yeah
[1:32:09] oh man how many of you have ever played
[1:32:13] with tops
[1:32:17] we are Ruby and the girls
[1:32:20] and Andrea you pay me Andrea I'm proud
[1:32:24] of you I'm proud of you yesterday
[1:32:28] no well you got an excuse
[1:32:37] can I is
[1:32:44] a sixth grade teacher
[1:32:48] he would make a circle on in the dirt no
[1:32:51] subtle noons
[1:32:54] didn't have not even a penny in our
[1:32:56] pockets
[1:32:59] you take change and throw it in the
[1:33:02] circle
[1:33:03] and we all had our top
[1:33:07] and whoever would hit one of the
[1:33:11] the coins they would jump out of the out
[1:33:13] of the circle
[1:33:20] Nathan doesn't want us to keep going
[1:33:36] as long as you you like me you want me
[1:33:38] to keep going
[1:33:44] I wasn't very good I couldn't take one
[1:33:47] coin I was never good my sister Ruth was
[1:33:50] better than me
[1:33:52] my sister was a queen
[1:33:57] marbles
[1:34:00] you could get a marble out of the circle
[1:34:08] hit that marble foreign
[1:34:12] would fly out everywhere
[1:34:16] I wasn't even good for that brother
[1:34:23] mercy of me
[1:34:31] the wobble uh
[1:34:40] the Earth
[1:34:42] because it is wobbling is
[1:34:48] getting closer and closer to the Sun it
[1:34:51] is getting closer to the Sun the second
[1:34:54] soul
[1:35:02] the angle does not change too much
[1:35:07] it causes
[1:35:11] to be directed
[1:35:14] more toward the sun
[1:35:18] on one side of the orbit
[1:35:22] and the other pole
[1:35:24] on the other side
[1:35:27] it is
[1:35:33] we have four seasons
[1:35:42] on the earth

[1:38:57] colder is is
[1:39:01] a midnight sun in Paris France in summer
[1:39:05] Rivers
[1:39:07] in Paris Francia I experience
[1:39:12] I used to play third base for the Army
[1:39:16] baseball team foreign
[1:39:28] why does the Earth rotate
[1:39:32] on its axis
[1:39:34] rotations
[1:39:36] and stays that way
[1:39:39] because of gravity
[1:39:42] gravity is
[1:39:51] gravities will keep you on the ground
[1:39:58] I Don't Need No song lyrics
[1:40:06] to
[1:40:07] raise my hands when they're gonna sing
[1:40:12] and I know many of you song leaders say
[1:40:15] that
[1:40:17] you know why I don't
[1:40:19] and
[1:40:31] I think gravity lift up my hands
[1:40:34] but the song leaders
[1:40:39] they have to tell them to some of you
[1:40:42] that not even with a crane can lift up
[1:40:45] your hands downstairs
[1:40:50] they tell you still Danny they don't
[1:40:52] lift up their hands
[1:40:55] I don't need for them to tell me you
[1:40:57] know they necessity
[1:40:59] it seems like your hands are anchored to
[1:41:02] do that is
[1:41:07] foreign
[1:41:33] foreign
[1:41:52] foreign
[1:42:40] flows through an electric wire
[1:42:46] electrical it creates a magnetic field
[1:42:50] magnetico the greater the electric
[1:42:52] current is
[1:42:55] the stronger the magnetic field
[1:43:00] in a similar way
[1:43:03] human electricity in the brain and
[1:43:06] nervous system the electricity
[1:43:11] create human magnetic fields as a
[1:43:15] compost magnetico sumanos
[1:43:18] so
[1:43:20] Andrea
[1:43:23] when the battery on your cell phone is
[1:43:26] dying
[1:43:29] you don't have to plug it into your
[1:43:32] electric outlet nothing I can to follow
[1:43:36] Allah
[1:43:38] just hook it to your body implementation
[1:43:41] and it'll charge
[1:43:43] that's why they call it a cell phone
[1:43:46] yourself
[1:43:54] uh
[1:43:55] only it'll take 70 hours
[1:44:03] you know
[1:44:06] it'll take 70 hours
[1:44:10] amen man he creates enough electricity
[1:44:13] to charge an iPhone in 70 hours
[1:44:20] because everything we we do
[1:44:24] is controlled by electrical signals
[1:44:28] running out of your bodies
[1:44:33] and because the Earth is still dead
[1:44:39] the world is out of Taylor El Mundo
[1:44:43] stuff
[1:44:45] Revelation 16 8 apocalypse is he says

[1:45:02] Hombres con fuego
[1:45:05] and men were scored with great heat and
[1:45:08] blessed him the name of God which is
[1:45:11] power over those plagues and they
[1:45:13] repented not to give him glory
[1:45:18] place
[1:45:24] that they will rot in their flesh and
[1:45:27] foreign
[1:46:17] Thessalonians
[1:46:32] give me the privilege of staying as long
[1:46:36] as I want to but I don't want to abuse
[1:46:38] of the Privileges
