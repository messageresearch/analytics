Lord it has been a very rough month but God has still with us I'm very thankful to all of you to the pastor to the ministry to the man that have uh prayed for me for the last couple of weeks it's been a very very rough even today was very rough when the pastor called me and I was battling with my myself he said he said are you ready to hit it I was like Gideon I was like Gideon are you calling me a brave man I'm right there in the corner Satan is taking away from me everything and you're telling me to go up there and fight I feel like that thank you Pastor confidence am amen he has blown me so hard that I have to blow him back again sometimes we forget what really Christian is to be and we see it that Christian is to be nice and dandy this this month God really has taught me how to be a Christian and let's read the scripture so I can tell you why Philippians chapter 3 verse 10 yes I think this is the one of the the the scriptures that our pastors likees to read read the most I guess he he repeats it because he wants us to get a hold of it and he says like this that I may know him in the power of his resurrection and everybody's going like w yes Glory okay let's keep reading and the fellowship of his sufferings being make conformable unto his death he's not just talking about the resurrection he's speaking about the until until we get a reward okay you can you may be SE it the reason I read this because Christian is it means Christlike and Christlike we always see it you know uh racing up the death praying for the sick seeing Miracles and wonders but we don't see the other side of the coin we don't see when he was weak when he was hungry when when everybody turned their back on him oh we don't want to see that picture we always see that picture that he's always smiling but see when he was at the cross he was suffering he's father where are you I need you right now that's right I'm suffering right now we don't want to go through that stage we don't want to get sick I don't want to get sick but I have to how are you going to know the power of his resurrection if you're not dead that's right and we get all happy and we sing his resurrection power is moving in this hour but how are we going to know if we're not dying to ourselves the only ones who can know that is the ones that are coming through those doors looking for a a last piece of Hope [Applause] am he said I am the of the valley the of the valley has a special characteristics he suffers when he comes out and he suffers when he's gone what do you mean brother it struggles to come out through all this filthy mud I struggle with myself to let the Holy Spirit come out through this filthy M and then that's not it and everybody says he it looks pretty that's not the best of it yet the best of it comes when it has to be smashed let me tell you brother every piece of juice got got on me this month I had no strength and I thought I thought it was like woo God gave me a car God gave me a carom oh nice it feels good oh I'm a Christian I have a house I'm a Christian and that's the power of the Resurrection but the price that comes with it nobody wants to go through it when you're there on the dumps we brother brother David thank you for that song I want to raise up my hands oh really God's going to say really you want to raise your hands let me see Lord why that's a question I said for a whole month I went from Doctor to doctor to doctor to doctor nobody was able to find anything and yet I was still fighting trying to believe that I had something and this last Sunday I came up woo let's pray for the sick and the surpr surpris one was me all of a sudden one of the ministers comes and tells me everything's fine he didn't know about it he didn't know what was going through and I was hoping to hear something says Satan cannot hurt Satan cannot hurt you oh you're talking about worshiping God in the worst moments we don't know how to here's the Lord Jesus Christ he's praying for the sick bringing Miracles raising up the dead and everybody's like wow I want to be like him I want to bring that yet he comes and says the fellowship of his sufferings but nobody wants to suffer every everybody wants to get everything nice and dandy you want to get your healing you come to the altar you think it's going to be easy when you leave the doors no God wants to say okay you really got a hold of the power of Resurrection let me Smash you a little bit and then now now we can say I want to raise up my hands lord lord I can't no more I want to be that Temple of worship you don't you don't worship when everything's at his best you worship when you're at your worse when you're in your pain when you're suffering then it really comes a worship from your [Music] heart here's a woman at the here's the woman with the blood issue she was she was dying she didn't know what the power of the Resurrection was but she was worshiping in her heart because she said I know if I just touch him right now I know Lord that you're going to heal me when you're dying when the doctor tells you you're goingon to die I didn't worship I was crying out that the crying out was coming at his best why because I have a car no no I don't worship like a but God cannot accept my worship like that because everything's nice and D but if I want to be Christlike then I have to suffer then I understand brother Caleb what me told you you want to be where I'm at you have to walk the same path that I walked you want to be a Christian you have to walk the same steps he walked sometimes you have to be the lamb for your family the lamp of sacrifice cuz you have to sometimes intercede I didn't know what I was going through this but now I understand that God had to allow this because maybe it was going to hit one of my kids was going to hit my wife which though she's hurt because because of of what I've been going through but I have to be a lamb nobody wants to be a lamb everybody wants to eat of the Lamb everybody everybody in the time of Moses everybody ate the lamb but po poor lamb he's the one who had to pay the price nobody wants to pay a price I I I I I I remember this here comes TL Osborne Osborne and he says I'm a Pentecostal have you heard of TL Osborne well he in his campaign he brought up a lot of Miracles [Music] too he didn't go what Brad Brandon went through but he says I was always used to you demon you get out of this woman right now and here comes a man from Kentucky that have paid he has gone through the sufferings of the Lord Jesus Christ Spirit of blindness leave this child now there was not a lot of emotion do the power of Resurrection brings emotion yes it does but now what what is what what does the power of Resurrection cause to the to the person that is dying have you been in un condition have you been in that condition have you been suffering lately oh wait oh when you can see the reward oh it's hurting oh but when it comes the smell out of that Lily comes the most expensive perfume on Earth even though comes through the mud have you ever been in the mud have you ever been in the mud have you struggled to come out of the mud oh we struggle and right now we're going through the Smashing process Oh Sister you have cancer or I don't know what you have oh it's mashing time raise up your hands and bring me worship that that that that the prostitute he took the best to Jesus Christ in an alabaster box so the best is inside of a box it's not the box it's inside of the Box the best of you is not this outside even though we work out huh to keep it to keep it firm supposedly but the best the best of you is inside of you now I can understand Paul said exercise in thy faith not in the body exercise thy faith because the times of Trials when he comes when you think you can beat anything let me tell you you better make sure you work out your faith brother Bram says faith has muscles you don't get muscles by an instant drink you have to work it out right now at the point that I'm at I really have to work out my faith why do you say this Brother start closing now I thought Christian was being all nice and dandy coming to church worshiping God clapping my hands paying my ti paying my my my my my my my offerings I don't even think that's even 10% you have to suffer that's the life of a Christian is to suffer you you born you suffer and you go to the tomb suffering because take up thy cross he didn't say take up your car or your house take pick up your cross and then start suffering with me everybody oh yeah I'll go walk with Jesus yeah everybody was over there 5,000 follow him then when they when they started seeing the needy greedy of it not even the 12 apostles were able to handle it they didn't want to suffer Lord do you want to go too do you want to leave you don't want to suffer anymore go ahead at the time of the trial at the time of the tribulation when not even your family can understand you what you're going through are you still are you still do you still want to walk do you still want to follow him when it's about to take your husband away when it's about to take your wife away when even your family doesn't want to follow you anymore do you want to go too okay that's not that's not it it says that being made conformable even his de when when you're by yourself in your dead bed when people are throwing at you if you're a Christian how come you're sick if you're a minister how come you're sick I thought you should you should be the the strongest man of the earth I'm sorry people let me tell you they are the ones who have to pay the price the most the pastor you see him behind the pulpit you don't even know what price you have to go through you see the Elder how many tears has it cost them to bring the Holy Spirit into our hands and to bring it so easy to us you want to know the scripture that says he's moved by the feeling of our infirmities oh he moves because when I'm sick the only way let me tell you the only way he can move in our midst by the feeling of our infirmities is when you feel the same pain as your brother God is a spirit let me tell you he cannot touch brother Bon says the only hands he has is mine the only hands he can move are yours you want to heal you want to see your brother being healed don't expect the Holy Ghost to move automatically you make sure you feel the sickness of your brother amen if two are in an agreement God will move on the scene now imagine he talking about only two I wonder why he what can he do with a bunch of people like us right now there's more than two here my question is are you willing to suffer the pain of your brother no let him deal with it let him fix it he's dying let him die he doesn't heal because he doesn't want to God's waiting for you to feel the infirmity then God can move on the scene wow there was a bunch of group of men in the in in in in in in the in the pastor's office and they told me I was going to have some some some stones in my gallbladder and here comes a pastor and a group of men says everything's going to be fine the ultra sound here comes a girl oh when they tell you can you worship yeah when I went to the AL yeah they're not going to find anything woo and as they were pushing the ultrasound what did they tell you that I have stones in my gallbladder oh she find something worse yeah she found something she found something that God can heal wow even though I've been struggling through it it's gone amen it's gone why because this group of men fail my infirmity God bless you [Applause] amen God bless you tonight don't you love him amen there's nothing like when you hear the word of God through the voice of experience am amen many many times it's easy to come up here and preach the word of God preach the gospel but if if that word has no effect in our lives if it doesn't mean anything to us then there's going to be no effect amen that's why they say don't repeat but it's got to be something that's alive amen you we don't just want to repeat the word tonight we want to become alive amen amen amen bear with me tonight I believe God is about to do something Mighty great amen I didn't think I was going to be up here tonight you know seemed like yesterday my body fell apart you know and our pastor called me earlier today and you know within my heart I was saying no but in the middle of our conversation God bring back to my remembrance all that our pastor has done for us all the blood that he has shed in his life for us Pastor you can't do that he said I need you amen and and and we come i' I've I've had a message boiling within me for a while now you know and I went back and I began to ponder on Paul's life you know and and I find a man that was so caught up in himself so caught up in what he had accomplished they had made him Pharisee of Pharisees everybody thought that Paul was the master of theology he was brought and taught BYO one of the best that there was at that time and Paul was chosen they thought so highly of Paul they said you are such a great Pharisee that we want you to persecute the Christian and Paul was so stuck in that position that he forgot the very thing that God had called him for he had studied so much of a Christ that was to come but because he was so caught up Christ had come and he didn't even recognize it that's where we find ourselves today but you know what sometimes we get so stuck in ourselves of what we've accomplished I'm a minister I'm a deacon I'm this one I'm that one but we forget what he's doing right now that God has to come into the scene Church he's got to get our attention he's got to shake us as say look what's happening the coming of the Lord is thee but we are just trying to live in our regular lives there's no urgency in our lives the word that our Prophet brought us is the Church the coming is ahead it is right here but we're so caught up in ourselves we cannot see what's happening think about it every prophecy is coming to pass we look at it oh that's all news already no urgency no urgy you know that's where Paul found himself in a life that he thought he knew what was the truth and Christ had come and he did with him what he wanted but you know what thank be to God that he doesn't look at our faults but he looks at his plan you know as Paul talks he says yet when I was yet his enemy he loved me and I wanted to hit your heart tonight when I was yet his enemy he loved me you know and many times we we want to say that's that's where Christ found me but how many did that happen today in your lives Church how many were you his enemy today how many were you his enemy that he looked past that he looked past our fault but he said you know what I'm going to place you in a place that you can stand behind this ministry CU he loved us so much that's why it's got our walk with him church has got to be personal every single day if not we're going to find ourselves like Paul was don't worried about what he had studied not realizing that he had missed the mark but do you know what God did he took a man because remember what our what our pastor had brought Sunday he said until but you know what Paul one day looked right into the face of God and found out he had no one till how many have looked at God in his eyes and S there's no until for me the road I'm on right now there's there's not an until how how many have seen seen the eyes of death and you just want to give up on everything enemy comes against you you give up your head goes in the gutter and and there's no one until for you but you know what I remember what our pastor had said he said your name is tied to something your name may be tied to someone else and that's where Paul found himself you know because one of the greatest messages that was preached in the Bible was the message of St okay and I want to just tell you real quick about it you know the Pharisees they found themselves and they got upset because they were so focused on the apostles that they had this crazy deacon and I want you deacons to pay attention here they had this crazy Deacon that he was going he was Healing The Sick he was saving the Lost he was preaching a gospel that was alive you know he was doing the works that he was called to do he wasn't trying to get a higher office he said this is what I am this is what God called me to do and he was doing such a great and mighty work that those Pharisees they said you go get that Steven and you bring him before the council we got to have a talk with that so you see what was happening in those those days is every Apostle all these great men they were running scared of Paul because Paul was going persecuting the Christians they were hiding from the law they did not want to get caught so they find Steven they bring him before every Pharisee amongst great Council and here's St they said so what do you have to say about this and here stepen Steven now here comes the Deacon coming out of Ste all right you guys want to know here you go he preached such a mighty message that impacted Paul so much that that's when Paul looked he looked into the eyes of God and he saw where he had failed thought there was no ideal for him there's no hope for me everything that I know it's wrong everything that I can see there is no God in my life because what did Paul have to do he had to clean that table because it was full of vom there was sin on his table there was unbelief on this there was no hope for him but you know what Steven was a wise man he did not just preach them any message but he showed them where they went wrong and most of all he showed them the way back because in that message what he accomplished he says you uncircumcised Philistines stiff necks here comes a correction but he said you know what let me take you back and let let me show you where you guys missed it he took them if if you read Acts chapter 6 and 7 you you you can see his whole message but in there he takes them all the way back to Abraham to Moses and then he goes all he he shows how Joseph was the type of Christ and how he came and where there was a pharaoh who knew not Joseph but he said but you are still L that seed he showed them the way back he say Moses he says they all died in the wilderness he says but what have you done with them you did the same things as your fathers they thought he was talking about Moses but he took him back to Moses and told them how Moses look to Christ that's when when Paul realized I missed it he was in such confusion and they were so upset with him that they stoned him and they killed him by the order of Paul but you know what confused the heck out of me is that they looked at Steven and the Bible in chapter six the last last verse of the chapter they saw him as an angel remember every SC every scripture has a compound meaning the prophet of God says he says they looked at him as an angel he says because they found no fault in his teaching everything that he brought messed up to what they knew was the sces they knew every scripture by heart they found no fault in that but you know what but Paul didn't just see that Paul saw a natural Angel standing in the m and then what did he say I see Jesus standing on the right God now Paul was really Shook Up Paul Paul ordered his death but then Paul leaves the scene and he says bring me his garments bring me bring me his garments he was confused he didn't know what happened but within him he began to cry un the Lord he said give me these garments give me his garments he kept him with him and he began to ponder how did I go wrong Lord Lord I need you Lord how did I miss it Lord Lord he saw you standing he saw this man Jesus standing at the right hand of God lord I don't understand Lord but I saw something in that man Lord what did I do Lord is there no hope for me Lord the very promise that Abraham that Moses had promised that you would send that anointed one Lord did I just destroy the every the very evidence did I destroy it Lord will there no Resurrection Lord did I just murder you Lord did I did I kill the hope for the pardon of my sins Lord did I kill it is our Humanity ruined is there any hope Lord Lord what's going on Paul we have another order for you you need to go to Damascus and you need to persecute those I could just imagine Pauling that order Lord see Paul knew every scripture and in the scripture what Paul found he was the first Mar of Christians he saw that he saw S as a murderer he said I've killed the man almighty God now I got to go persecute these Christians if I tell them what's going through my mind they going to kill me now what have I put myself into what have I done Lord clean my table Lord clean What I've Done lord I can't take it back lord so Paul is such a mess his way to persecute those Christians he took the clothes of Sten how can I make this right but all of a sudden as he was on his way to Damascus a bright light shine before him him knowing the scripture he knew that was the same light that led the children is he said Lord what would you have me do what would you have me do how many of you tonight are in that same position that sometimes we think we know everything we think we have our lives figured out we have persecuted we have become a martyr a Marty in this last day because we're persecuting God's word when we have such a mighty testimony we have such a mighty word in our midst pers we have the clothes in our hands ste's clothes in our because why cuz we thought we had it all figured out when we left God on the side we just pushed him oh the pastor has it that's all we need he's bringing such a mighty powerful message that's all we need yeah that's what you need you need it inside of you that's why he says it over and over the word inside of you now get these TV shows inside of you get this Facebook inside of you these cell phones inside of you but get the word inside of you because God his Mercy is still here so Paul here God gave him a chance God gave him an opportunity because you know why he needed a man like Paul afraid to take the gospel afraid to cry out sin so the greatest message that was put forth Paul was that message of Steven Paul looked at that he was so determined with God's word so eted to make it right with God that he went with the gospel he started building churches he said God is still alive it's not me he said I used to be a Pharisee he said but it's not me anymore but it's Christ it's Christ that lives inside of me and that message is still going on the message of St you're marching on that no matter what confronts you he's more than able as you stand he's more than able more than able tonight that it doesn't matter your circumstance I don't care if you're down if you think you don't have a purpose your life can't be any worse than Paul's but now Paul got up his work was so hard he had to convince the people hey I'm not here to kill you anymore but I'm here to give you life so he had to convince the people that Christ was no longer dead but that he was alive [Music] with every eye closed tonight you know God is still calling you know we could turn God off but when we were yet his enemies he had loved us you see many times we think God owes us something he doesn't know it's nothing you see grace is an an unmerited favor he did it because he loved us he continues to do it because but you see church one day there won't be Grace anymore one day he will call for his judgment but you know what church we that congregate here can never say that the clean and true word has not been preached in our midst God gives us opportunity after opportunity and I don't know about you church but I wake up every day and it seems like I have failed God over and over but that's when we have to get up church and say Lord Lord I want to do something for your kingdom today I want to be able to go go to sleep tonight Lord knowing Lord that I took one step to further your gospel in this world Lord oh and I was on his oh he knew me and yet he loved me oh he who CL Glory makes all the heaven shine I'm so worthy Lord have So Unworthy oh such Mery and with he was on the cross that day you had I her a
