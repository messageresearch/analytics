moms dad you redeemed you really know what that means to be redeemed you guys should be a little bit more excited than you are if you're really redeemed I'm excited that I'm redeemed but I kind of understand what it means because it means that you were lost one day you were worthless you were hopeless you were without God you were without light you were without anything and one day God reached down his hand and he picked you up from that place where you were and he bought you with a prize with the greatest price that could ever be given and he bought you with his own blood and he purchased you and he redeems you so you kids should be really excited tonight you should be excited to be in children's church worshiping God and serving our Savior you guys excited are you ready alright so we're going to read a really quick scripture and then we're going to take our seats because we have a little story to share with you all y'all want to hear a story tonight awesome ladies are you ready ladies are you ready are you ready let me hear you say an Amen really really loud Amen come on one more time amen all right so let's read a scripture who brought your Bibles all right so we're going to open in Matthew chapter 7 verse 7 Matthew chapter 7 verse 7 and this this is Jesus Christ speaking to us giving us really good instruction something that we can base our life and base our foundations in and we can grow up and become strong men and women in the Lord so I want you guys to pay attention to what Jesus is telling us you're ready ladies ready young guys pay attention to what Jesus is telling us he's saying ask and it shall be given he's saying see and you're going to find you will find got a seek first and he says nah nah and it's going to be opened unto you and that's a blessed promise from Jesus Christ you may take your seat so so this is a big problem with with little children and as you get to be big people like your moms and dads and like be one day you're going to be big I'm going to be grown up and this is a big problem because many times we're afraid to ask for anything we're afraid to go up to that big scary door not right we're afraid to seek for something that we really need or that we really want and we're afraid to ask and why is that why do you think that is any of the little guys why do you think that is what's so scary about asking anyone ladies what scares you about asking if you have to come down here what's scary about asking when you go and ask your mom and dad for something what's kind of scaring you what's holding you back there's something holding you back you're afraid to ask why she might say no she might say no and no it's not a fun word who likes to hear no does anyone like to hear no but the truth is that we here know way more than we hear yes who would agree with that as children you're always hearing though and you come and you ask and you really really want something and you're building up the courage and you come and you ask dad and mmm he says no and it breaks your heart and you don't like the way that feels and you come and ask mom and she says whatever your dad thinks and he already said no so you go away with your shoulders down and you're sad and they said no so you grow up fraid to ask afraid to seek an answer afraid to knock from that big scary door because what are they going to tell you so then we go through life and we pray who prays kids who prays ladies you pray raise your hand high if you pray that's something to be proud of I pray who prays for their food yes you pray for your food who prays for their day that God will just be with you through this day and he'll bless you who prays for your mom and dad and you go on a trip you pray that God be God will be with you on this trip and that's all great and we should pray for those things but do you realize that the God you're praying for when you say blessed be peace he's the one that parted the red seas with one blow of his nostrils he parted the Red Sea and he made a way for the children of Israel to get through on dry ground that's the same God it's going to come down and bless your little pile of peas do you realize that do you realize that when you're praying for God to bless this day be with me through this day lord I pray in Jesus name Amen and those are easy things to ask for but that same God that you pray for that's blessing this day one day he stopped the Sun in its tracks and he said son stand still earth moved no more until I tell you to move he stopped it right in the sky can you guys imagine that God could stop the Sun so the thing is that we grow up and were afraid to ask for things but Jesus tells us he says ask ask me seek me pray get on your knees and pray but ask me something that's going to get me up that's going to get me moving God likes to move on his people who believes that he likes to move he likes to exercise his power and we go through life just asking for the little things and afraid that if we ask for the really big things the scary things that the answer is going to be no or maybe there's not enough power in the world or enough resources in the world to do to even imagine to begin to do what we're wanting in our heart so I'm going to talk about somebody or give me just a second I'm going to talk about somebody today who wasn't afraid to ask who wasn't afraid to see God because you're going to find as you go through life and you get a little bit older right you're in school now and maybe there's a bully who has whose experience to bully out there in school somebody mean and vicious and rude and cruel and they probably definitely don't know the Lord that you know so they don't know how to treat people they mistreat you and they mistreat others around them and you go through life and you realize right away you're young and you don't want to go to school today because that bully is going to bully you he's gonna mess with you he's going to hit you he's going to possibly hurt you and you realize right away that you need God even in that situation you need God so you pray for God to bless you on that day because you're afraid and you're going to go through life and you're going to realize that the more and more things you go through the more things that you face that you're going to need God more and more and more and I love something our prophet tells us brother Branham tells us if you want more of God well there's more of God to have and that should excite you guys tonight because we need more of God and we should want more of God so we're going to talk about somebody that who wasn't afraid to pray and ask God for the really big things the impossible things the things that are just mind-blowing that God would you really do this for me and Jesus tells us seek and you're going to find knock and it's going to be open to you you guys can't be afraid to ask God for all of the things that you're going to need in your life because God is our resource and he's our supplier he's going to supply our needs so who's heard of hezekiah there's a guy a couple um who's heard of let's let's let's tell you the name of the bad guy who's heard of Sennacherib Sennacherib he's the bad guy in the story there's there's always he like there always has to be a bad guy why can't we have a story with just a good guy right that's just not the way life is there's got to be a bad guy because the bad guy helps us or helps to prove that the good guy really is the good guy he's the best and this was the best that God had in this time so Hezekiah and it's in Hezekiah chapter 19 that you can read this story you guys can read it at home we won't read the whole story but I want to tell you about Hezekiah because he's pretty inspiring he inspired me and he made me realize that God is able and he's more than able and he's willing to help us out if we only come and ask I can't imagine what would have happened if Hezekiah didn't come before God and pray and ask because you see the sky Sennacherib it was a bully in the days of Hezekiah and all around the countryside all up and down the coast Sennacherib had come and he was destroying he was pillaging he was killing he was murdering he was taking entire countries and entire cities and here he comes down the coast headed towards Jerusalem or Judah where Hezekiah was the king and he was a king but there was this army that was mighty and they were scary and they were coming and they were going to come for him and how he knew this is he sent a letter in advance and Hezekiah receives this letter and this letter tells him Hezekiah don't even let your God deceive you the God that you serve don't let him deceive you into thinking that he's going to deliver you because he might just do that but he said look at all these countries I've destroyed did their God save them they didn't look where they're at they're all dead there demolish I've uh Turley he says I've uh Turley destroyed them so don't let your god deceive you into thinking that you're going to be safe so Hezekiah gets this letter and Hezekiah 19:14 we'll just read this verse Hezekiah 19:14 just to see what Hezekiah does so Hezekiah receives the letter of the hand of the messengers he reads it it's a pretty scary letter and Hezekiah went up into the house of the Lord and he spread it out before the Lord this very letter that this evil man Sennacherib had sent him he spreads it out before the Lord in the presence of God and there he prays first fifteen says he prayed before the Lord and said O Lord God of the Israel which dwelleth between the cherubims thou art to God even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou has made heaven and earth Oh Lord bow down your ear and hear open up Lord dine eyes and see and hear the words of Sennacherib which has he has sent to him to reproach the Living God so there Hezekiah is he could have been there all night long praying because the Assyrian army approaches 185 thousand men you guys know how many men that is all in one group how many is that that's a lot of men in one group and here they come and they're going to demolish Jerusalem and Hezekiah only hope is to seek and to pray and to knock and he comes to the temple and he's knocking on the door that great door and he's knocking and he's seeking an answer and he could have been there all night praying and he says in verse 19 therefore Lord I beseech you save us out of his hand and all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord God so what do you guys think God did for Hezekiah what do you guys think happens next with this great Assyrian army any idea god save them gee that guy think God is going to save them from this army well let's read about it let's see what God does because God is an awesome God you guys believe that he's a he's a he's an all supplying God he supplies our needs he's there when he needs us we just have to seek Him we just have to search we have to knock we have to find and we're going to find our answer so verse 32 verse 35 let's go down to verse 35 so here Hezekiah is and I'm sure the entire city is scared to death what's going to happen this army is coming it's going to destroy them and they already know this army has destroyed everybody around them all the nations all the cities they've been demolished they've been destroyed and it came to pass that night that the angel of the Lord went out imagine the angel of the Lord going out and fighting for you going out before you in places that you were afraid to go but here goes the angel of the Lord and he smoked in the camp the Assyrians a hundred forty score 104 score five thousand when they arose early in the morning behold they were all dead corpses so imagine here is Hezekiah he'd been praying all night he comes through the city wall in the morning and he sees the entire Assyrian army and there they were laying dead in the fields and on the hillsides and not a single I love that the Lord said says to Hezekiah they're not going to shoot an arrow here they're not going to come and do this city they're not going to even enter the walls and there goes Hezekiah and he sees and the entire Assyrian army is out laying like dead corpses so what do you guys what are you afraid of tonight to come before God and to ask him imagine asking him very simply from your heart Lord this thing that I'm facing this trial this hardship it doesn't even matter what it is it doesn't matter how hard it is what you're facing and as you guys grow up and become young men and young ladies there's nothing that God can't do he stopped the mouths of lions he parted the Red Sea he created the universe the galaxies of stars and what he wouldn't do for one of us that he loves more than anything and that's why he redeemed us so if you're redeemed go ahead and stand to your feet we're going to sing a little bit more brother will and I want you guys to really worship the Lord I want you to stand to your feet who can raise your hands with me young men if you can raise your hands to the Lord young ladies raise your hands don't be afraid to worship Him because he is worthy of our praises folk just like Hezekiah here comes the devil to each one of you and doesn't matter how little you are how old you are how smart you are here comes the devil and his only goal is to utterly destroy you to make nothing of you to make an ash heap of you and to walk away feeling satisfied and good with what he did to your life and he's going to do it in very in many many ways there's many things just like the bully at school there's other ways that he's going to come and he's going to try to destroy you and he's going to fight and he's going to try to kill you to try to harm you try to hurt you and that's why we say our prayers every day but we can't be afraid to ask God for the really really big thing because maybe the answer is going to be no sometimes but believe me when when you're it's your life your soul is on the line God is going to come through for us who believes that tonight when you need him the most he's going to be there for you and if he has to slay 185 thousand people just to save you because you're his child you're his daughter you're his son then he's going to do it and he's going to come through big for you guys and I know because in my own life I've seen him come through really big in really big ways and in ways that surprised me and amazed me and that's why I love him tonight so who loves him raise your hands high if you love him if you love him and let's mean a song together every promise every promise in the book is mine we'll sing it kind of slow every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line I am trusting in His grace divine and if you guys believe that every promise just raise your hands with me young guys raise your hands sing it to him and just believe and hold on to every promise in the

news is it's not going to make you very sick because he's on our site gods on our side amen all right so I know we have a very special occasion this evening and we have another soul that has come to the Lord is ready to give his heart to the Lord to surrender himself so that God can use him and be with him through his whole life and that's brother Abraham and he's going to get baptized tonight so we can give him a round of applause because his decision is the greatest decision that he's ever going to make in his life the greatest decision so very proud of brother Abraham for that decision and wanting to do is you come to this back room and you can change and we're gonna ask our Baptist to get ready and we're going to have a baptism tonight I'm excited for that that the Lord is still saving souls he's still bringing people to the cross and he's still alive in doing very well so as brother Abraham gets ready for his baptism let's sing another song if we could brother will consume that song again I've been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb I've been redeemed they've been sanctified I am if you guys are redeemed don't be afraid to clap your hands to say Amen to raise your voices to the king of kings and the Lord of lords I've been reading by the blood of the Lamb I'm a bit greedy [Music] laughs I've been redeemed by the blood of the left they dancing define I am all my fins are under the blood Javed breeziness Jubilee is Jubilee and I am free is you call me and I am free it's people need and I agree see the died on Calvary of my friends are under the blood habit me D the devil mad he's mad tonight but I'm so glad the name old man but I oh man but I'm so glad he loved the dinner that he thought he had all my things are under the blood happy reading if you movie and I am freedom it means free raise your hand Jubilee are you Green Ranger green you've been wave on if you're free Lee and I every he's the star of Calgary all my sins are under the blood happy reading [Music] how old are you yeah so you might say she's too young say so for age do we start baptizing nowadays you got baptized and young nothin mean the founding pastor words he says uh not against the house gurus Aronofsky no Stan of Chico's yeah these guys according to the Word of God and the last day they would be weaker but wiser if we wanted to know anything we would have to burn our eyelids and get books or go to the library and study and study now like the Prester said this morning I don't like instant things now all these young kids young people they're instant geniuses you know you wanna know something get a smartphone there it is we didn't know nothing we didn't have telephone we didn't have TVs we had nothing but ourselves and a bunch of gurus again and over but it made a strong the finalist it'll be weaker we were strong we were real skinny but strong and we burned our eyelids to learn but now they are so far advanced at his age we not all that I was like I said we were just mischievious kids you know just to a little testimony we were caught me and tongue in any killing cherries and apricots from triskin imagine and they call the cops you know because there was a lot of discrimination the angles on one side and the mexican-americans in another side and because we were stealing from the angles they call the COS and they took us to trial I think to scare us it to scare the boots out of me and tell me you know so let's that's hard to do in a Halloween you know what would we do everybody has the Mexican Americans did not have indoor plumbing we had a toilet outside from Halloween we would throw the toilet in one time there was somebody sitting on the toilet and we knocked it down with it there's what we used to do so now the questions back should we baptize young kids they should know how to do this they know how to smoke drugs and do these in there so I think now is the time is when they God speaks to them but let me say something for the parents before we baptize this young boy when you have your children there are as they say and down you the parents should be responsible for this tree to grow straight because if they get baptized and you don't come to church or you just leave them alone don't run the things of that at home then that tree will grow crooked so I pray also for the parents of this young boy that God will help them raise this boy in the ways of the Lord so when they grow they will not depart from it we have here this young boy my great grandson and they named him after me so we have a bunch of Abraham Paris so anyway Abraham I'm going to pray precious and Heavenly Father as we come before your presence Lord God you've been knocking on his heart and he's been asking for baptism for a little while I already talked to him a few times and I'm sure his parents have also and Lord we just ask him then for his parents that you might help them you know frame this young boy in your ways north of this tree can grow straight and in due time it might bear good fruit Laura and my hippie as he grows an example in school as he goes and plays with boys his own age but Lord were right now we're gonna baptize it in your name Lord the only name that has power the only name that says their name that has redeemed us as we heard this morning so Lord I'm just praying this prayer for him Abraham Paris is a minister of the endtime gospel to baptize you unto the name of our Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and the Lord will give you the gift of the Holy Ghost I'm to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] and I am free if you believe and I am free it's too bold II and I every Jesus died on Calvary all my sins are under the blood I've been greedy there's water and I tell you what it's nice and cool I remember in Silver City Tommy when we were there years back this sister didn't wanna get into the waters was it was so cold it took us about 20 minutes together because of water was cold and I was him there I said it's coal only all your best Baptist they have baptize you know this it's John that you go in you feel that your but once you're in there the Holy Spirit is fired and the Holy Spirit wants the water and it's not cold anymore and but in July you know like right now in artists when it's hot that water is nice even I wish I could be in there now it feels worse anybody else you know this might be your less opportunity you know now there's water what hinders you you know God's knocking at you holla we heard this morning you know we'll give you one more chance if there's somebody now's the chance you know opportunities don't come this often now the time you know to get to the calling of the Holy Spirit I've been redeemed I be ready by the blood of the Lamb I'll be ready by the blood of the Lamb and my be reading probably the left they distinctive but I am all my sins are under the blood I've been reading those nobody else may God help the beautiful Amen Gordon
