[20:30] see notice when the antichrist
[20:35] they have them revelations and the
[20:37] presence of that
[20:39] ball of fire hanging there in a room to
[20:41] the whole brother
[20:43] although i've seen since a child every
[20:46] time it
[20:46] comes near me the larger he almost puts
[20:49] in an unconscious condition
[20:52] you never get used to it you can
[20:55] you're sacred now notice
[20:58] not in the ninth verse souls under the
[21:02] order
[21:04] now here's where i'm going to get some
[21:05] real
[21:08] disagrees but i just watched yesterday
[21:12] yes see i thought that too but it didn't
[21:15] come that way
[21:17] we've i've always thought that these
[21:20] souls
[21:21] are the altar or the the the martyrs
[21:24] of the early church and i'm sure that
[21:27] well
[21:27] dr uh smith and everyone says it is
[21:31] but i thought so myself but when the
[21:34] holy spirit showed the vision to it it
[21:36] wasn't
[21:39] and isn't the soul now who are these
[21:42] souls
[21:43] that's the next thing who are they that
[21:45] if they're not the early church
[21:46] [Music]
[21:49] this is israel that's to be
[21:53] saved as a nation all
[21:56] them that are predestinated that's
[21:59] israel
[22:00] that's israel itself for i would not
[22:04] brethren
[22:05] that you should be ignorant of the
[22:07] mystery
[22:10] unless you should be wise in your own
[22:12] conceit
[22:13] [Music]
[22:17] the blindness in part
[22:20] is happened to israel until the
[22:22] fulfilling
[22:23] fullness of the gentiles become in
[22:27] as it is written there shall come out of
[22:31] sound
[22:31] or deliver and shall turn away
[22:35] ungodliness for jacob
[22:38] what israel was blinded
[22:43] for the very purpose of us being saved
[22:48] notice now i want you to watch this real
[22:52] close
[22:54] they were given robes
[22:57] they didn't have they were given robes
[23:01] white robes each one of them now the
[23:04] saints
[23:05] [Music]
[23:07] now i have already had one they get it
[23:10] here
[23:11] [Music]
[23:12] but there they were given roles and the
[23:15] saints already had theirs and gone on
[23:18] okay see they had
[23:24] these uh souls understanding now that's
[23:27] under the altar
[23:29] why they were martyred by sinful men
[23:32] like
[23:33] eichmann see they're holding out on
[23:36] millions of them but they remain
[23:39] jews now remember what was it
[23:43] they were killed for the word of god say
[23:48] not for the testimony of christ did you
[23:49] understand that but remember
[23:51] the church come in also the martyrs of
[23:53] the church
[23:54] was for the word of god and the
[23:57] testimony of jesus christ
[23:58] i mean it was that your condition all
[24:00] right now but these
[24:02] didn't have a testimony jesus christ for
[24:05] the word of god
[24:06] and for the testimony which they helped
[24:09] the jews and hitler hated them so
[24:12] tonight
[24:12] started stalling all the rest of the
[24:14] world
[24:16] but they stayed true to what they
[24:17] believed
[24:19] and they killed them because they were
[24:21] jews
[24:21] [Music]
[24:26] that's right and for the testimony they
[24:28] held they were
[24:29] martyred and your souls are the altar
[24:33] after the church had been gone now what
[24:37] [Music]
[24:39] they had in their blindness martyred
[24:42] their messiah and now
[24:46] they were reaping for it they realized
[24:49] that they recognized edge has gone on
[24:51] they've seen them when they come before
[24:52] the altar of god
[24:54] but now watch the grace of god comes to
[24:57] them
[24:58] and jesus gives them each one a white
[25:00] robe
[25:02] [Music]
[25:03] watch well over after the church is gone
[25:08] like joseph did to his brother a time
[25:12] look when joseph stood there and when he
[25:14] finally he made himself going
[25:16] there with the altar his own offer
[25:21] and his balance his throne
[25:24] he said everybody leave amen his wife
[25:27] was
[25:28] over in the palace
[25:30] [Music]
[25:31] and he said john he said don't you know
[25:34] me
[25:36] hey speaking of hebrew now i'm your
[25:39] brother
[25:40] joseph
[25:46] god did that for a purpose i had you to
[25:49] throw me out in order
[25:50] to save life
[25:57] don't be angry with yourselves remember
[25:59] joseph said that which is the type of
[26:01] 144 thousands we'll get later
[26:04] what he did he just run right quick to
[26:06] when fellow his name started
[26:07] hugging
[26:08] his little brother that had been born
[26:10] into the family
[26:11] after he had been gone by
[26:15] his mother the first church
[26:19] the orthodox church the 144 000
[26:23] for the barn in his asses while he's
[26:25] away
[26:28] [Music]
[26:29] oh my don't let this do something
[26:33] so we see who they are these
[26:36] jews 144 000 is to be
[26:40] called out by the two witnesses of
[26:44] revelation 11. now remember
[26:48] there was the prophesy notice these
[26:50] souls
[26:52] are to wait a little season
[26:55] for the 144 to be martyred
[26:59] oh isn't that isn't that just puts the
[27:01] bible together well listen
[27:03] i just got something to tell you it's
[27:04] just so good it's just burning right in
[27:06] my heart
[27:07] i hope you haven't forgotten
[27:08] [Music]

[27:13] by
[27:14] his grace he also
[27:17] let me see my people not long ago
[27:21] and white ruins you remember
[27:26] you remember the story not long ago

[27:41] if there's no altar of sacrifice
[27:45] in heaven where is a sacrifice
[27:48] for sin land
[27:51] the land
[27:56] there has to be a place for that slaying
[27:58] lamb bloody
[27:59] and laying there or the blood or i do
[28:02] think rather by the opening of this
[28:05] fifth seal as i believe that it's open
[28:08] good
[28:10] i did it with good conscience
[28:13] with clear revelations before god
[28:17] not trying to just make it think because
[28:19] i always was against the organization
[28:21] never would belong to him
[28:23] but it's open to me now

[54:02] the lord for that
[54:06] first corinthians the second chapter in

[54:10] and it reads like this and i brethren
[54:12] when i came to you
[54:13] came not with excellency of speech or of
[54:17] wisdom
[54:18] declaring unto you the testimony
[54:21] of god
[54:36] there's a there's there's it all goes
[54:38] together but there's a difference
[54:43] where i determine not to know anything
[54:45] among you
[54:46] save jesus christ and him
[55:02] the next scripture would be we're going
[55:03] to be reading a lot of scriptures
[55:07] hebrews 11 5 and 6.
[55:11] remember this is we're talking of the
[55:13] testimony of jesus christ
[55:17] says by faith enoch was translated
[55:21] that he should not see death and was not
[55:23] found
[55:25] because god had translated him
[55:28] for before his translation
[55:31] he had this testimony
[55:34] that he pleased
[55:46] to
[55:50] he had this testimony
[55:55] amen what was his testimony
[55:58] was it that he did this or he did that
[56:01] or this where he came from
[56:04] he only had one testimony that mattered
[56:09] that's all i want care about anything
[56:12] else i just want this morning to make
[56:14] sure that
[56:15] i please god or without faith the bible
[56:19] says but without faith which is
[56:21] revelation
[56:22] it is impossible to please him
[56:25] or he that cometh to god must believe
[56:27] that he is
[56:29] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[56:31] diligently seek him
[56:35] necessary
[56:41] amen for you young people i i gave you
[56:44] those notebooks
[56:46] of course if you have your own notebook
[56:47] you can use your milk but i
[56:49] gave you those notebooks so that you
[56:50] could write some notes
[56:52] so that you can go back home and you can
[56:54] you can remember what was
[56:56] spoken and over and again again
[56:59] and again
[57:03] there's something that is connected with
[57:06] this testimony
[57:09] bible says once again that he had
[57:12] this testimony that before his
[57:16] translation
[57:18] he pleased god and there's nothing
[57:21] greater to me
[57:22] once again like i said than pleasing god
[57:27] you see all the heroes of the faith
[57:30] the revel of hebrews the 11th chapter
[57:34] they all had a testimony
[57:38] that it was by faith
[57:42] by faith that all was accomplished
[57:47] i'm going to say it again all the heroes
[57:49] of the faith
[57:51] had it their testimony was by faith
[57:55] they did these things
[57:58] they had the testimony of god
[58:03] for the word is the testimony of god
[58:18] this is what paul is talking about in
[58:21] first corinthians
[58:23] i didn't come with to you with nice
[58:25] words
[58:26] i didn't come to you with polished words
[58:30] or with some great education i came
[58:33] declaring unto you the testimony of god
[58:37] once again the word is the testimony of
[58:40] god
[58:42] i want us to reflect on our lives this
[58:45] morning
[58:46] what has our testimony been
[58:50] testimonial is our testimony
[58:53] look what i've accomplished in my life
[58:58] think about that that does not please
[59:01] god
[59:17] i want you to get that this morning
[59:19] because it's very important where we're
[59:20] going
[59:24] says in the message god hath the
[59:25] provided way
[59:29] like you are
[59:58] is
[1:00:12] oh how great it is when god does the
[1:00:14] miraculous
[1:00:15] in our lives and we testify about
[1:00:20] what god did in our lives
[1:00:23] i think of abraham and sarah
[1:00:26] waiting
[1:00:37] wait a minute that was their testimony
[1:01:07] mary had a great testimony
[1:01:10] she was the first and only one
[1:01:14] to ever be overshadowed by the holy
[1:01:16] ghost
[1:01:18] and to produce us a son nobody had never
[1:01:21] happened to anyone
[1:01:36] this is the son
[1:01:50] your
[1:02:05] this is why it's so important young
[1:02:07] people old people
[1:02:09] middle aged people it's so important
[1:02:13] to guard our testimony
[1:02:18] i
[1:02:31] the testimony was all the things that
[1:02:33] god had given
[1:02:34] in commandments
[1:02:38] when he gave the ten commandments there
[1:02:40] was more of course we know than ten
[1:02:42] yeah but they were kept in an ark
[1:03:11] that god even placed two cherubims over
[1:03:14] it
[1:03:29] can can grasp where we're going this
[1:03:30] morning
[1:03:34] jesus said in john 14 15.
[1:03:38] he loves me see my mice keep my
[1:03:41] commandments
[1:03:42] how
[1:03:52] it means to build a fortress around it
[1:04:09] but for future generations
[1:04:24] you will abide in my love
[1:04:27] now that is the response or that is what
[1:04:30] jesus said
[1:04:32] now we're building a platform here today
[1:04:36] don't forget everything that i've said
[1:04:38] so far
[1:04:50] young people any of the young people
[1:04:52] here what is the testimony of god
[1:04:58] you're sure all right brother abe says
[1:05:01] the word
[1:05:02] you agree with him all right
[1:05:06] the word is the testimony of god
[1:05:11] exodus 25 20.
[1:05:14] and as the holy spirit puts this
[1:05:16] together we pray
[1:05:39] and thou shalt put into the ark

[1:06:15] that right it's typing christ

[1:06:37] commandments

[1:06:42] the ark
[1:06:44] the testimony which i shall give
[1:06:47] you in testimony
[1:06:51] and the cherubim shall stretch forth
[1:06:53] their wings on high covering the mercy
[1:06:55] seat with their wings
[1:06:57] and their faces shall look one to
[1:06:58] another toward the mercy seat
[1:07:01] which shall towards the mercy seat shall
[1:07:04] the faces of the cherubims be
[1:07:06] lost
[1:07:18] and thou shalt put the mercy seat above
[1:07:21] upon the ark and in the ark
[1:07:24] thou shalt put the testimony that i
[1:07:28] shall give thee
[1:07:31] verse 21
[1:07:38] here is the here is another version then

[1:07:42] put the atoning cover on top of the arc
[1:07:51] you shall put the testimony which i will
[1:07:54] give you
[1:08:01] [Music]
[1:08:05] can he meet us there if the testimony is
[1:08:07] not there
[1:08:28] now watch this now this this is so good
[1:08:30] to me
[1:08:31] and i will commune with thee from above
[1:08:34] the mercy seat
[1:08:36] from between the two cherubims which are
[1:08:39] upon the ark of the testimony
[1:08:42] of all things which i will give thee in
[1:08:45] commandment
[1:08:46] unto the children of israel
[1:09:04] out what are the three things that were
[1:09:07] inside the art
[1:09:08] quest anybody number one
[1:09:18] hey
[1:09:32] gay brother elijah the knot
[1:09:37] okay the next
[1:09:42] what is it
[1:09:47] all right thank you young people
[1:09:51] amen you're young
[1:09:55] it's all relative huh there you go you
[1:09:58] compare yourself to methuselah you're
[1:10:00] really young
[1:10:28] yes
[1:10:57] that was natural bread for a natural man
[1:11:02] but today we have spiritual bread
[1:11:06] for the spiritual man now number three
[1:11:09] then we have numero tres
[1:11:18] okay we got the pot of manna for the
[1:11:20] next was what
[1:11:22] you got to speak louder
[1:11:46] [Music]
[1:12:07] once again remember all these three
[1:12:09] things must be
[1:12:10] in the arc my question is how many of
[1:12:14] you have all these three things in your
[1:12:16] heart
[1:12:18] how many have a testimony that he
[1:12:35] or the arc of the testimony and you'll
[1:12:38] find it you'll find
[1:12:39] all these three things and they they're
[1:12:40] all go together
[1:12:42] but what's important to understand
[1:12:46] is that wherever the testimony was
[1:12:48] placed
[1:12:53] i want you to get this the testimony was
[1:12:56] so
[1:12:56] sacred testimony that anything
[1:13:00] or wherever it was placed
[1:13:11] but the moment that the testimony was
[1:13:14] placed
[1:13:15] in the arkansas testimony
[1:13:55] in other words the testimony was laid in
[1:13:58] the ark
[1:14:13] but because the ark was in the
[1:14:16] tabernacle
[1:14:19] now the tabernacle became known
[1:14:24] as the tabernacle of the testimony
[1:14:28] now now this i want you to get this okay
[1:14:32] it's so important to understand it's
[1:14:34] important
[1:14:35] how sacred once again how sacred this
[1:14:38] testimony is
[1:14:58] but thou shalt appoint the levites
[1:15:01] over the tabernacle of the testimony
[1:15:22] and they shall minister unto it and
[1:15:25] shall then camp round about
[1:15:27] the tabernacle
[1:15:31] wow if you have if you're spiritually
[1:15:34] minded
[1:15:36] this morning
[1:15:49] thou shalt appoint the ministers which
[1:15:52] is the levites
[1:15:54] over the residence
[1:15:58] is what tabernacle is i'm going to
[1:16:01] appoint them over the residents
[1:16:13] that's how important this testimony is
[1:16:17] testimony we're getting to some i'm
[1:16:18] going to get to something good
[1:16:21] hold your horses
[1:16:24] the testimony the testimonial is
[1:16:28] the words of the covenant
[1:16:34] make sure you write that down young
[1:16:35] people i'm going to say it again
[1:16:38] testimony the words
[1:16:41] of the covenant that's why together yes
[1:16:44] it's the ark of the covenant
[1:16:57] and we the bride of christ
[1:17:14] look at your neighbor and say neighbor
[1:17:17] you are the words on the pages
[1:17:21] of the lamb's book of life
[1:17:25] can we give one to the lord jesus this
[1:17:26] morning
[1:17:28] my goodness watch how this
[1:17:31] all comes together revelations 15
[1:17:35] 5. cinco
[1:17:40] watch how it all comes together now
[1:17:44] how many remember that that moses built
[1:17:47] the tabernacle
[1:17:49] according to the pattern that he saw of
[1:17:51] the temple
[1:17:54] let's see how powerful this testimony is
[1:18:22] not only this is how contagious the
[1:18:24] testimony
[1:18:49] it's all about the testimony
[1:19:18] your your understanding of religion and
[1:19:21] of christianity is so different than
[1:19:23] mine
[1:19:28] i don't care what your gender is
[1:19:31] important
[1:19:32] [Music]
[1:19:33] or or what color hair you have okay
[1:19:41] and all you can see is him vomiting it
[1:19:44] out
[1:19:47] that's right
[1:20:02] how sacred it is to keep yourself young
[1:20:05] ladies
[1:20:08] how sacred it is to to watch and keep
[1:20:11] your eyes
[1:20:14] things that you're not supposed to do
[1:20:30] raptured he had a testimony
[1:20:35] this testimony is god
[1:20:39] okay we're going to get to this now
[1:20:42] the testimony the testimonies
[1:20:59] [Music]
[1:21:01] the testimony of god himself
[1:21:05] on mount transfiguration
[1:21:08] this is god's testimony
[1:21:11] this is my beloved son
[1:21:16] hear ye kim that's
[1:21:19] god's testimony this is the testimonial
[1:21:22] and when the when so many in the world
[1:21:24] say ah jesus don't exist
[1:21:49] why is this so significant significant
[1:21:52] because the earthly tabernacle in the
[1:21:54] wilderness
[1:22:00] it is typing you and i lo
[1:22:04] it's types the church that's right
[1:22:23] a tabernacle is a habitation
[1:22:28] and a testimony in testimonial is
[1:22:30] something that's evidential
[1:22:34] when i look at this we read it
[1:22:38] the way it should be read
[1:22:42] a sacred place of the habitation
[1:22:48] of the testimony or the evidence
[1:23:00] it is cry it is god in christ
[1:23:18] amen
[1:23:33] is the word of god in seed form
[1:23:36] and that was the word of god in the old
[1:23:38] testament
[1:23:41] it was the word of god once again in
[1:23:43] siege form
[1:23:46] foreign
[1:24:27] and was manifested before then manifesto
[1:24:31] from law to grace they could not
[1:24:35] fathom that think about this
[1:24:39] i'm going to try to try to uh dramatize
[1:24:42] this just for a moment
[1:24:44] right it's so small you can fit it on
[1:24:46] your finger right
[1:24:49] that's the word of god in seed forms
[1:24:52] what is the seed waiting for
[1:24:55] good ground to be planted it finds the
[1:24:59] good ground
[1:25:00] and it grows and it's manifested in your
[1:25:02] lifestyle wow out of this little seed
[1:25:04] you should say wow this doesn't mean
[1:25:06] it's a big old tree
[1:25:08] all these apples wow that's amazing
[1:25:22] you preach what you have
[1:25:39] promise of the promise
[1:25:42] but right before their eyes see
[1:25:45] now the word becomes flesh
[1:25:49] and produces manifest what it is
[1:26:02] if you would have known your prophet
[1:26:20] become
[1:26:34] see
[1:26:49] he was a man after god's own heart
[1:26:54] came forth god's own heart
[1:27:01] did you get that why
[1:27:04] because it was still a seed in him
[1:27:08] says that seed needed the rain
[1:27:13] is the holy ghost but the holy ghost had
[1:27:16] not
[1:27:23] [Music]
[1:27:56] when it begins to produce it no longer
[1:27:59] is a mystery
[1:28:01] it is what it is ah that's right
[1:28:05] when i look at this growing up in the
[1:28:08] message
[1:28:10] i find out found out real quick that
[1:28:13] doesn't give
[1:28:15] are you listening to me how many of you
[1:28:17] young people grew up and have grown up
[1:28:18] in the mess
[1:28:21] okay i'm going to give you an alert
[1:28:24] growing up in the message does not give
[1:28:25] you a free pass into heaven
[1:28:41] sometimes oh my mom and dad will stand
[1:28:43] for me so people find me myself all that
[1:28:45] you love and never love will be there
[1:28:46] and so they'll stand for me
[1:28:48] don't look at the job all twisted up
[1:28:52] that's not the way it is
[1:29:07] testimony must be inside the ark
[1:29:12] okay let's stop here for a moment
[1:29:16] each must have their own experience
[1:29:20] in the church you'll find all kinds of
[1:29:22] different people
[1:29:33] that never grew up in a christian home
[1:29:50] now is that anybody here praise god look
[1:29:54] at the hands
[1:29:55] then there's others that were raised in
[1:29:57] church
[1:30:01] and returned back like the prodigal son
[1:30:04] come on
[1:30:29] what happened to the hands
[1:30:35] and it always seems like the worst
[1:30:38] sinners
[1:30:41] they got the best testimonies
[1:30:45] and the one that's been sitting in
[1:30:46] church their whole life is
[1:30:50] yeah wow wow that was awesome
[1:30:56] what happens the wheels start turning
[1:31:00] maybe i need to go out and taste of the
[1:31:02] world
[1:31:10] what a lie of the devil
[1:31:16] there was a preacher that once said that
[1:31:19] he was raised in church he always
[1:31:22] thought that he had to go into the world
[1:31:24] and sin
[1:31:26] so he could have a testimony
[1:31:30] you know as human beings we have
[1:31:31] everything so backwards all the time
[1:31:36] okay why do we cry at funerals
[1:31:40] and are happy when babies are born
[1:31:52] the bible says that a man born of a
[1:31:54] woman um
[1:32:10] and
[1:32:38] they're coming in they've come home
[1:32:42] they've graduated that's the way we
[1:32:45] should be
[1:32:47] why are we are we wired wrong foreign
[1:32:54] satan likes to play both sides
[1:32:59] as well as i do never been out in the
[1:33:02] world
[1:33:03] you got to go out and sin and it is a
[1:33:05] powerful testament
[1:33:20] he plays both sides
[1:33:34] is
[1:34:02] that's awesome
[1:34:09] but how is it that it's lesser in our
[1:34:11] minds
[1:34:14] that in this most wicked age
[1:34:19] god could keep you guarded
[1:34:23] from going out there
[1:34:26] now that doesn't make somebody greater
[1:34:28] or better than someone else that's been
[1:34:30] out all right
[1:35:11] or he wants to deposit in your heart
[1:35:17] can you protect it with everything
[1:35:22] this testimony is testimonial
[1:35:26] what he's trying to do this morning
[1:35:29] trying to get you to focus on this
[1:35:32] testimony
[1:35:35] is not my testimony
[1:35:40] that's what we focus on too much
[1:35:43] sure we all have a story sure we all
[1:35:45] have a testimony
[1:35:47] but what good is that testimony
[1:35:50] without the testimony testimonial
[1:35:54] watch this now find yourself in this and
[1:35:57] quintus is and i'm going i'm going to go
[1:35:59] down these my
[1:36:00] lord i don't know don't worry about
[1:36:02] water
[1:36:04] watch this now they can say the rich
[1:36:07] young ruler
[1:36:08] el rico
[1:36:37] him to sell all that he had to take up
[1:36:40] your cross
[1:36:41] follow me he went away
[1:36:47] he couldn't sell out
[1:37:03] have you done all these the commandments
[1:37:06] all of them then you still have just the
[1:37:09] seed
[1:37:11] now i'm inviting you to get the seat to
[1:37:14] grow
[1:37:14] okay chris come follow me but you got to
[1:37:17] get rid of everything
[1:37:46] here comes the woman jesus to the woman
[1:37:48] at the well
[1:37:49] jesus she must have been a church member
[1:37:52] at one time
[1:37:56] because she knew about the father father
[1:37:59] jacob
[1:38:14] maybe she thought there was no hope for
[1:38:15] her
[1:38:17] she had been married five times
[1:38:20] the one she was living with now was not
[1:38:22] her husband
[1:38:25] maybe in the eyes of man she would never
[1:38:27] be justified
[1:39:09] maybe he came from a broken home
[1:39:12] no one could teach him not in lansing no
[1:39:15] one to raise him in the admonition of
[1:39:17] the lord
[1:39:19] but he recognized that the man on the
[1:39:22] cross
[1:39:22] next to him
[1:39:36] then you have a ruler of the jews
[1:39:42] a man of experience
[1:39:45] a man of dignity of authority
[1:39:49] amongst the religious people
[1:39:52] may be raised to be a ruler
[1:39:59] yet knew nothing about being born again
[1:40:04] i always scratched my hair
[1:40:19] we would have preached the message of
[1:40:20] worship to nicodemus
[1:40:24] this woman that's been married you need
[1:40:26] to be born again
[1:40:30] but he preaches to a ruler
[1:40:33] he must be born again
[1:40:43] [Music]
[1:41:30] without
[1:41:44] who were
[1:41:59] form the seed
[1:42:02] the word had become flesh
[1:42:05] and he's persecuting the ones that are
[1:42:07] following the manifestation of this
[1:42:10] again get
[1:42:22] somebody that maybe matches or we can we
[1:42:25] we can we can see and say you know that
[1:42:27] that sounds like me
[1:42:30] and each one had their testimony
[1:42:33] there was a point at which jesus showed
[1:42:36] up
[1:42:38] there was a point at which jesus came to
[1:42:41] them
[1:42:43] he is the word and they either accepted
[1:42:46] him
[1:42:48] or they rejected it and those that
[1:42:51] accepted him
[1:42:53] are the ones that fulfill the scriptures
[1:42:57] thou shalt put into the ark
[1:43:00] the testimony that i shall give thee
[1:43:03] testimonial
[1:43:04] let me tell you something saying don't
[1:43:08] fear your
[1:43:22] watch how i say this very important
[1:43:28] well i came from this walk of life or
[1:43:30] that walk of life do you mean
[1:43:32] i used to do this i used to do that and
[1:43:34] be that kind of person
[1:43:45] because if a person really wants to be
[1:43:46] morally speaking burning you leave
[1:43:48] start doing things better
[1:44:02] the testimony that pleases god
[1:44:06] and that is the testimony of jesus
[1:44:09] christ
[1:44:12] that's the thing that he fears the most
[1:44:14] think about it
[1:44:16] god call the disciples train them
[1:44:30] still they were not witnesses
[1:44:49] oh no i'm not saying that they have to
[1:44:50] throw that away because that didn't
[1:44:51] matter don't get me wrong
[1:44:55] they would not become witnesses till
[1:44:57] later on
[1:44:59] something was still missing all right
[1:45:02] how many are still with me this morning
[1:45:05] this morning amen watch now now you can
[1:45:08] see
[1:45:09] when we see this and we see what how god
[1:45:14] does
[1:45:27] returned again with joy
[1:45:30] saying lord even the devils
[1:45:33] are subject unto
[1:45:37] us
[1:45:51] this is their own testimony it is
[1:45:55] well like it's like i got it now
[1:46:04] subject unto us praise god we've got it
[1:46:09] we're not even witnesses yet
[1:46:24] when jesus
[1:46:36] but rather rejoice because your names
[1:46:38] are written in heaven
[1:46:48] your names are written in heaven
[1:46:51] so don't get excited because some
[1:46:53] spirits are
[1:46:55] they they're subject to you
[1:46:58] and you see so many people think yes
[1:47:01] because they cast out devils
[1:47:02] pray for the sick too many miracles
[1:48:16] didn't
[1:48:58] let's take away our funny little ideas
[1:49:02] watch this now no wonder jesus said in
[1:49:05] acts 1 8.
[1:49:08] but you shall receive power after
[1:49:37] but not until after the holy ghost has
[1:49:39] come upon you
[1:49:40] especially
[1:49:53] is one that has a true testimony
[1:49:57] think about it it wasn't the acts of the
[1:50:00] apostles
[1:50:03] because then they would have said look
[1:50:04] what we're doing especially
[1:50:08] foreign
[1:50:22] in
[1:50:28] this is this is something so good to me
[1:50:31] then when i see the word unfolding
[1:51:05] yes two thousand years ago yes it was
[1:51:07] missing the same lord jesus
[1:51:10] and forever he perceives the same in
[1:51:13] every detail
[1:51:14] yes he is cece okay we're all witnesses
[1:51:18] now
[1:51:18] someone's told
[1:51:32] this now revelations chapter 1 verse 1
[1:51:37] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[1:51:39] gave unto him to show unto
[1:51:41] his servants things which must shortly
[1:51:42] come to pass he sentenced signified it
[1:51:44] by his angel
[1:51:46] unto his servant john then let me go to
[1:51:48] verse 2 and then you can you can
[1:51:50] open me there who bear record of the
[1:51:53] word of god
[1:51:56] that's the jews yes
[1:51:59] yes
[1:52:12] who bear record of the word of god
[1:52:26] and of all things that he saw
[1:52:30] [Music]
[1:52:36] and companion in tribulation and in the
[1:52:39] kingdom and patience of jesus christ
[1:52:41] was on the isle that is called patent
[1:52:43] patmos for two things
[1:52:54] for two things i was on the owl of
[1:52:57] patmos
[1:52:59] because of the old testament
[1:53:02] and because the new testament
[1:53:07] that's why he's there what is this he
[1:53:09] says for the word of god
[1:53:12] and the testimony of jesus christ
[1:53:16] he was on the isle of patmos
[1:53:19] because of the things that he bare
[1:53:21] record of foreign
[1:54:53] this testimony of jesus christ is the
[1:54:54] most incredible thing
[1:54:58] brother says in the message of witnesses
[1:55:02] and in court in cortes
[1:55:05] a witness has to know something
[1:55:09] just anybody can't be a witness
[1:55:13] that's the way it is when we are
[1:55:14] witnessing for the lord
[1:56:05] isaiah 43 8-12 says this
[1:56:09] write them down and read them again at
[1:56:12] home
[1:56:18] this is the testimony of god
[1:56:21] bring forth the blind people that have
[1:56:22] eyes and the death that happens
[1:56:26] is
[1:56:30] let all the nations be gathered together
[1:56:32] and let the people be assembled
[1:56:35] who among them can declare this and show
[1:56:38] us former things
[1:56:40] let them bring forth their witnesses
[1:56:42] that they may be justified
[1:56:43] or let them hear and say it is truth let
[1:56:46] me go to verse 10 now
[1:56:48] and you can start ye are my witnesses
[1:56:52] say it
[1:57:14] and my servant whom i have chosen that
[1:57:16] ye may know and believe me
[1:57:19] and understand that i am he
[1:57:22] before me there was no god formed
[1:57:26] neither shall there be after
[1:57:30] what is testimony this is the testimony
[1:57:32] of god
[1:57:35] or me there was no god formed nor will
[1:57:39] there be one after
[1:57:41] this quest that's my testimony
[1:57:43] testimonial but i will say that
[1:57:44] hey yo this is my beloved son
[1:57:49] i am so pleased
[1:58:12] we have too much of that in the church
[1:58:14] sometimes
[1:58:16] the pastor said this or the brother said
[1:58:17] this is
[1:58:23] [Applause]
[1:58:27] therefore no man can exactly witness to
[1:58:29] the resurrection of christ
[1:58:32] only
[1:58:53] who are professing to be christians the
[1:58:55] professors are christians i'm not
[1:58:57] living like it is that's the thing see
[1:59:00] yes
[1:59:13] living with partners and not being
[1:59:15] married
[1:59:17] it's the thing that's hurting us and i
[1:59:20] have some of them come time come to me
[1:59:21] sometime
[1:59:26] i'm talking to him and witnessing him
[1:59:27] about the words
[1:59:34] that's right you're trying to tell
[1:59:35] someone of god's word and of church and
[1:59:38] all these things
[1:59:41] totally contrary to the word
[1:59:51] [Applause]
[1:59:56] you can't be a correct witness without
[1:59:58] living right
[2:00:02] yet they want all the benefits
[2:00:05] of getting married in church
[2:00:08] with a minister and a white
[2:00:22] hello everybody
[2:00:36] and let every man examine himself
[2:00:52] convictions are happening
[2:00:56] it's emotion for the majority of the
[2:01:00] time in church

[2:02:32] an indictment
[2:02:35] formal charges there's a hearing

[2:06:50] when he had opened the fifth seal i saw
[2:06:53] under the altar the souls of them that
[2:06:55] were slain for the word of god and for
[2:06:58] the testimony
[2:07:02] we just we just saw this right
[2:07:06] the drawing earlier
[2:07:09] see the souls
[2:07:39] but they never had the testimony of
[2:07:41] jesus christ
[2:07:43] they were blinded they have not received
[2:07:45] jesus christ
[2:08:00] and they overcame him by the blood of
[2:08:01] the lamb and by the word of their
[2:08:04] testimony
[2:08:06] and they loved not their lives unto
[2:08:07] death verse 17
[2:08:11] and the dragon was wrath with the woman
[2:08:14] and went to make war with the remnant of
[2:08:16] her seed
[2:08:17] which keep the commandments of god and
[2:08:19] have the testimonies
[2:08:32] the remnant of the woman's seed i want
[2:08:34] you to notice
[2:08:49] that's the jews watch the dragon coming
[2:08:52] forth
[2:08:56] which keep the commandments of god those
[2:08:58] are jews

[2:09:09] very important you get that and neither
[2:09:12] one of these is talking about the bride
[2:09:29] when i see this
[2:09:51] and they have the testimony of jesus
[2:09:53] christ
[2:09:55] and when i look at this lord i i don't
[2:09:58] get it i thought the bride was the only
[2:10:00] one that had the testimony of jesus
[2:10:02] christ
[2:10:08] that's the way that i lord how can they
[2:10:11] have the testimony of jesus christ
[2:10:27] the testimony yes testimonial
[2:10:33] i don't know about you but i gotta give
[2:10:35] one to the lord jesus this morning
[2:10:38] i looked at that and i said wow

[2:10:54] he doesn't just
[2:11:08] she's the only one that is the testimony
[2:11:11] is the testimonial because in her
[2:11:15] is his spirit he dwells
[2:11:18] what is his testimony testimonial that
[2:11:21] i'll never
[2:11:22] leave you nor
[2:11:30] that's the testimony of jesus christ
[2:11:34] he is living proof yeah
[2:11:49] of jesus christ
[2:12:04] that's
[2:12:31] has your deed been cleared
[2:12:44] potentially you're going to be raised
[2:12:59] against it has been stricken off
[2:13:04] abstract to it now you've got the seal
[2:13:10] it's yours john 3 33 says
[2:13:14] this is that
[2:13:28] testimony of jesus christ
[2:13:34] you are enriched by him in all
[2:13:37] utterance and in all knowledge even
[2:13:40] as the testimony of christ
[2:14:23] i have the testimony
[2:14:38] testimony
[2:14:50] he says you will recall that i mentioned
[2:14:52] at the beginning of this message
[2:14:56] this book we are studying
[2:15:00] actual revelation of jesus
[2:15:04] in the church and his work
[2:16:14] but he that doeth the will of my father
[2:16:16] which is in heaven
[2:16:57] but the word to them is still in seed
[2:16:59] form
[2:17:02] then a prophet comes on the scene oh
[2:17:04] church this is it i'm finishing here
[2:17:06] then a prophet comes on the scene
[2:17:09] you know what he says he said that's
[2:17:11] thus
[2:17:12] saith the lord
[2:17:17] [Music]
[2:17:26] divine interpreter of the word
[2:17:30] testimony which is the word
[2:17:33] the life of jesus christ is the spirit
[2:17:37] of prophecy
[2:17:39] that's why he can say thus saith the
[2:17:41] lord
[2:17:43] and spirit then he can say well they
[2:17:46] prophesied
[2:17:47] we prophesied in his name
[2:17:50] but it took a prophet to line it up with
[2:17:53] the word
[2:18:17] [Music]
[2:18:21] knowledge of them
[2:18:32] the token brother branham says is the
[2:18:34] testimony of jesus christ
[2:18:53] but somebody sent this to my wife
[2:18:56] i think it might have been so successful
[2:19:00] but it's a little story
[2:19:04] of a person that had land had had some
[2:19:07] sheep
[2:19:10] says that one of the lambs got bit by a
[2:19:12] rattlesnake in its face
[2:19:17] said that it's they swelled
[2:19:32] is see what the serpent
[2:19:35] also doesn't know
[2:19:38] venom is most often made with
[2:19:42] sheep blood
[2:19:46] and after two days the blood of the lamb
[2:19:51] destroyed the venom of the serpent
[2:19:56] the owner said i was worried
[2:20:41] flowing through the veins of the bride
[2:21:00] she doesn't have the testimony of jesus
[2:21:02] christ
[2:21:04] again she is the testimonial
[2:21:08] and everything that she does
[2:21:22] do you have your own testimony still
