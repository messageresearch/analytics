[Applause] this is Taba sudden surprise well it's that thank you very said thank you very much as enjoying those songs I like to hear their you know I love good singing and I hear plenty of it want to come down here usually I'm not want to come down having heating services or something out that's County stay along by the south and then the boys get these tapes and then when I get home I have some work to do in the office and I sit down and listen to those tapes over and over I hear everything had said and I'm glad to see brother careful so here this morning an old friend the gospel it many years ago was out in this same work praying for the sick perhaps years before I ever knew about praying for this city and so another man here personal friends I see great post your last night in the tabernacle of a Jeffersonville and so we're very glad and I met brother young brown I said brother Jack said his name was young and it fits him when he told me he was 60 something years old I can hardly believe he hasn't changed a bit since the first time I hear he forgot you this looks the same well God is good to us and I like those away them songs this morning with with a dick to it something it's real something and it means something you can drink it in I could hardly refrain crying right out loud when I've heard them singing that song about talk about the 23rd psalm there and then then come over in this lovely song and they just sang a trio there just to think of the there's something in it that you feel on the inside of you your emotions pulsating knows that the kingdom of God is near hand all these things that we've talked about and wondered about is now fixing to take place some of us may fall asleep before that time comes but that will not prevent our resurrection because it gives us the privilege of coming before those are changed trumpet of God's will sound the dead in Christ rise first then we which are alive and remain do you notice all of the Resurrection shall be caught up together with them when you meet each other before you meet him they caught up together to me then with them to meet the Lord in the air see he's God and then when he wants us to be worshiped that's what his very nature it is to be worshiped because he's God and he knows if we were there be looking at a quarry rise if the other ones there but and then it wouldn't be there completey way of free worship when we stand there and and we know we've met each other first and greeted each other and then to stand by him who calls it all in saying the songs of redemption as brother Jack as many times made the statement when an Angels encircle the earth with bowed heads not knowing what we're talking about they because they never been redeemed but we had to be redeemed and how many crowning the king of King and Lord of lords I don't know what to say I didn't think about Sammy and just come up here I guess it's testimony time just to give a testimony and so tonight the Lord willing I think I've looked at the little schedule and this services I think I'm to bring my message tonight on the Easter or hardening Thanksgiving a message tonight and then we want to take then perhaps the risks the week if the Lord willing and praying for the sick won't you gather a patch of this little Jubilee of Thanksgiving which is a memorial of a great meeting that was held here one time and stream for a few about three years ago when you had this revelation of coming in and the Lord did bless all nightly here in that meeting and I trust that the Lord will continue and maybe there'll be sold saved here until the last names on the book in God's great recording station on how those who accepted Christ as Savior then fill with this spirit now let's this batter hits a moment I'm thinking about Scripture Lord Jesus we are most grateful people this morning but yet we just limited with expression if our hearts could give away to what we what we want to we don't know how we behave ourselves and there are no wonder you said there are not be room enough to contain the blessing advise before a life honest and we're grateful for this and we just pray Lord as we bow our heads in adoration of you that you will receive our Thanksgiving there's so many things that we have to be thankful for and we could not express them but we just say thanks be to God above all things that we're thankful power is that great gift of God to the world and when God gave his son to make a way for our Redemption we're so grateful for that and we have face that and have sense nor I can remember since a little boy that's what happened live now as I'm getting old know that the Sun will instead of not many more times to lobby something what I'm living for I gonna enjoy know Lord that there's many fellow citizens of the same Kingdom that waits likewise this morning for that time to come for that which we have taken the journey far to serve Him and to try to direct our fellow man alive eternal that great hour is soon approaching we can just somehow feel it down in us that it's it's near then maybe we are able to think and we pray that you'll bless us now and continue with our blessings that thou has been given us this morning and now as we read portion of that word are a verse or two we pray that the great Holy Spirit will take these verses in a testimony to his honor in Jesus name we pray amen I thought of a place your believe it's town and Corinthians Secretariat's 9 the fourteenth verse and fifty father prayers for you which long enter you for exceeding grace of God in you thanks be to God for His unspeakable gift Paul you're speaking of the grace of God that's in you the unspeakable gift of the Holy Spirit that dwells among the people he was thanking God for that that they had the Holy Spirit to come upon these people the unspeakable gift of God so rich and pure nothing in my mind exactly so I thought I just can't give a little testimony my experience with Christ in the last few days has been most glorious all my life you know you've heard me many of Ian's I thought I'd say this for some of the tabernacle people that's sitting here at my congregation of the tabernacle is made up from about three nations of the morning when we speak Mexico Canada United States preneur every year another day there were 28 different states for one little sunday-school servicing 28 different states representing I want to say this to the glory of God and traveling I think that to prayer and supplications being a mouth cast as we were rejected by the church world as so called today that Tabernacle has grown into the mightiest headquarters of God's grace of any place that no in the world I've never seen such as a large doing there it's just it's unspeakable how what he's doing there just the humility just the people coming in from everywhere and we're grateful for that little station of were some of the people around the country gathering to enjoy the Grace and spread grace to the others now all my life it seemed I wanted to go west in many areas read these stories and hear the tapes if the tape ministry is the worldwide thing everyone think it's one way God has got scattered and the message back into the headon lands back and more they has to be translated in a Germany and so forth they got tapes to go to their congregations of hundreds and hundreds of people I put a little things in their ears and run onto a tape and just as I'm speaking the minister stands there I'm making the same expressions and in the other languages and brings it out before hundreds and hundreds are being saved and heal this studio tapes going out across the world all in English but being translated in many many different language and tribes around the world we hear from them back through the mail and I'm saying this it's going to be a personal test monie to the glory a vibe that it might be that you'd understand in the coming nights of Laura I want to say if the Lord willing you'll understand like I'm trying to say last night the world coming to a place is falling apart politically socially economically you say economics more money yes but where's it coming from we're borrowing taxes will be paid 30 years and today she's broke she's bankrupt nation not this nation of our own and there's no way ever getting it back and it's a trap set exactly to swing this nation into something out of your lies on that well who's got the wealth of the world who owns it sure does wrong want it and whenever we do and we get broke instead of these big merchants to back of whiskey and so forth like have to get the money what will they have to either change the currency or borrow money and when they do it's a birthright so right back exactly this is perfect you just watch the scripture said it's about it I'd like to get a place some time the Lord willing when a tip comes on the scene and I believe that soon I've seen going worldwide I got a worldwide meetings coming now and I'd like to get a place where I just set out for about six weeks just to take those things and go through them you see it back and forth through the scripture and it's astounding to see the ire that we're living it frightens me it frightens me not because in my heart the jar bells are ringing knowing that the coming of the Lord is so close to hand but what frightens me is to know that so many is unprepared for the hour we're crazy that's the bad part I mean he ever heard the story about the squirrels up at that time eh oh of course I gets everywhere I lose something like that happen of the day and I was you've heard the story about the Mount is coming down when the law brought those things on the mountains the other day not my life I'm not a preacher anybody knows it I'm not a preacher but it's made up in a spiritual form of watching things and seeing things moving for warning people things that's coming to pass and it's just that's my makeup I can't help that the more than you can help your makeup but God has put us each one in the body to do certain things now move every objective every movie because everything is governed by some governed by spirit this church is put here for a purpose it is a spirit behind this church certainly spirit behind your home behind every building behind everything there's a spirit motive and objective this church come here to greatly exhaustion system or something then it's Modi's is not right but if it's year to try to achieve something for the kingdom of God then their motive and objective both is rises directly that way now I've been thinking since the ministry and the first second and third phase of the ministry when I first come to Shreveport I told you people that the Lord you lay your hands upon my hand and it would signify the same in the Holy Spirit never fail on time I what told you exactly what was wrong with you I told you then after he told me that day that there would be a time that when you know the very secret of the heart not knowing that the word says that will be I didn't know that but the word does say that the Word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart Hebrews the fourth chapter now that word you see you must never leave that word you stand exactly with that word the way it's written but no private interpretation to it just say it just the way it's written that is God's Word and that is God God and His Word is the same just the same and as I said last night there's a postive word laid for every age and there 790 comes down that projects that hosts a word for that age and you see where we're at today they read what we're supposed to be doing and you'll know how far we are I only see one thing left the coming of the Lord Jesus at any time a rapture for the church and we're to meet him in the air now these things has got to come to pass in this day just as he promised they would do it and now about five years ago after the duck had served its time each one of those phases had served his time and he give visions and may even take listeners and so forth know that there was coming one more phase and he simply dropped that out so perfect there's man sitting right here now I'm looking at right there and seen it take place as perfect as I ever seen in my life and even took pictures of it of what the Lord God said would take place we went right there in there it was just exactly like he said just about like the March 17th a March issue of the Life magazine you see that circle of light in the skies 30 miles high 27 miles across while marchers only about 9 miles high and they can't even make up what it was in right standing beneath that a man is sitting right president now was right stay there by me when seven angels come down from God visibly standing right there and told me about the end time and these revelations and things of The Book of Revelations to seven seals and said return home and one by one will bring the message that's right and it went right up and get turned why does it went up all up and a blast that shook the mountains to rock size of a of a bucket fell out of the mountains like that in nothing was around even a newspaper said they check to see if there's a sound breaker a plane or something there was nothing Elaine's up there nothing besides a plane breaker could not do that and then it was foretold it be that way six before it happened six months there it was in the science searching it today right there our Tucson in different places they can't understand what was that up there now if you'll get the magazine you're looking even see the shapes their wings and still in there they're going up to seven angels and we're know that these things are correct friends or if there ever was a time that the church ought to be in deep sincerity it should be right now now just it's done something to me uh-huh myself for five years now I've wondered that was wrong I felt in my heart like I was I was all crushed down with something and I couldn't make out what it was doing the time of this great crushing and so forth I've just plaster around around across the country and the government had me under an investigation and because when we have the meeting somebody write a check Julia Brandon and hard to sign up and hand it back and then we got a package of all of all of our meetings and when they look through there and found out that if went into the pay the campaign yet as I sign my name to it identified the check to myself they had me out of the governor $300,000 and they wouldn't let me leave and had to stay here and so forth for a great time to search through all of this and and I'm not everything went they said yes it went into the campaign but the people made the check to you and when you endorsed that you identified yourself with the check and you owe taxes on it if you never even held in a second in your hands you still yours because you're endorsed it I don't know what I don't all the mechanics of this laws and things I supposed to have a stamp to stamp it instead of sign it want to sign it it means it's mine and then they cut right into the package and find there it was placed right into the phone and spin out like that I draw a salary from the Church of $100 a week their sets of Trustees sitting right there it knows that's right and that's all I get from that and otherwise it goes right into the campaign now I felt like I was crushed for last four or five years when I went up into Canada just recently on trip of going hunting and what I did the Lord helped me Authority lead a whole tribe of Indians to the Lord Jesus and I hope to go back when the when the well the prick star up up there and things to baptize the whole tribe in the name of the Lord Jesus because the healing of an Indian woman dying in a heart attack that the priest wouldn't come to we were back in the jungles were ahead ride for hours horseback there are those sitting here now who is present when it happened and now then coming down and had to stop over in Colorado to visit some of my friends there some ministers them I'm a guide in Colorado and I was taking them on a hunting trip to three of those men five of them are studying right present now to know this has been awful dry in Colorado this years it has been across the nation and fires were very would be very bad so they delayed the hunting season awhile but while we were up there there come forth an issue that there was coming a blizzard and it's dangerous to be in the mountains at that time cause you sometimes I've seen you couldn't even see your hand before you four hours after hours and 30 foot of snow dumped right out in one time just in a few hours right I'm talking in your parish so I told my brethren that morning when was leaving out I said now the blizzard practically a hundred manner more had been back in behind us and Here Come jeeps trucks and everything going right on up because they know what was going to happen no one left back but the cow man himself back there which he winners back there and we were the only pepperoni truck it stayed in and I asked the brother and they said we'll go to state so then all right I said now be ready we went out got some a Methodist minister and I went and got some more bread and stuff so we could find it it's about 30 miles in and Bank so we come back brother John and then sitting here they heard that in a way they went they got out at the time so the blizzard struck but we was going to stay over and I was going to Tucson for a meeting and I Apollo my wife and told her that we had if I didn't get there to let somebody else substitute in my place and the next morning we started out I said I have the first time is real cloudy you hear the rain for anything get back to that camp as quick as you can cause within 10-15 minutes you'll never see your way back again and so I have the man place top went up over the top of the ridge walking up trying to run deer down on them and I'd few days before that shooting my rifling down in Tucson coming back up there sold it out a little bit to the right I shot a big buck that I've been looking for for many years and it hit him too high and I he had died down there and I couldn't find him the weather was getting bad I thought I run up to take a look and if when I got up on top of the mountain I noticed the rain started the sleet falling and no big drops of snow a size of a silver dollar just plastering everywhere in the winds twisting I knew everyone was on the run back to the camp thing but I waited a few moments and I thought I'll never be able to find this deer at this time under this storm so on we went started down the mountain just could see about ten feet in front of me in about as about four miles or more to get into the place knowing to come down the mountain nor the country so well cause of herding cattle there or years and years coming down the mountain I've got about a half a mile from the saddle the wore out the crossing like this across the range or world was that and there was I've been feeling that horrible burden I've cried I prayed I've confessed what can I do what is it that I've done like you've done something real evil or I could hurt somebody you know you ought to make it right that was I condemned about I knew not I said Lord if you only reveal it to me I'll make it right but whatever understand and preach and do all that I know to do and I've tried will they have cleaned clear and just according to your words but what have I done and still that burden would not let up year after year I thought about it on the mountain that morning and I started down the day before was my anniversary to my wife and I were married 20 years before that and I've never been home for my anniversary and I always go up to the mountain a little place raised some quakin ass the first year we were married I didn't have money to take a honeymoon for a little trip and then take a huntin trip to so I took my wife on hunting trip or the honeymoon so that look like honey getting it or got both at the same time now I remember a little feller out I pick her up lift her over logs and things then we got up to a little place now Tucker picture it's always kind of a convent fair I'll think of that and think of her black hair and how pretty she was now gray and just a few years has done to her I thought I believe I'll go up there but it's too hard snow was too hard then I know I had to get in because they broadcast a severe blizzard on the road you broadcast across the nation I don't work on Simpson setting here this morning out coming down from Canada he was told by radio not to even go through that country at all everybody said don't go through there go that way called a horrible blizzard is sweeping across and I started down the mountain thinking about that about 10 o'clock in the morning and how all the sudden just as plain as you hear my voice the voices stop and turn around and go back and I couldn't tell this amongst people it's unbelievers you only have 30 believers and then because this unbelievers will never understand it you got to have a spiritual mind to understand spiritual things the word is spiritual it's interpreted spiritual and it's a it's God's Word and I stopped I thought if I go back up there another half a mile back up the storm raging like it is and David would and make me a sandwich and it was I think he's getting eaten with me for making his father one month time we didn't have nothing but some onions and honey and bread I put it all together we made us the salmon and you go to hardly eat his I think he was trying to get even with me for that so he put all of war all kind of walk and going up the mountain the rain falling so fast they got it wet is just one big water I thought well I'll eat that wait while I was standing there thought that was nothing I just the marriage as a wind probably waist blowing twisting through these trees and I started to walk on I just could not walk and I thought well I believe I'll go back I heard it again go back where you come from it said that I start up the mountain stop my thought maybe I I was getting scared to go back to world was that because the the winds were so terrific sometimes God makes us do things that it seems very dangerous and out of line how about Moses let's stick going down to take over Egypt and everything we find I can that God asked the Impossibles see so that he does the Impossibles that man will know that it isn't him it's God that's doing it I went back up to the top of the mountain again we'll find him away through the blowing twisting trees now sit down and touch my gun keep the scope and getting up I got bear around in that kind of time and so I put the scope back on him a shirt like this and set down and woman I thought what am i doing sitting here but bad works in mysterious ways his wonders to perform their past finding out to the carnal mind and never catch a glimpse of it and as I walk back up and sit down sitting there thinking on God what a while I'll come back I thought my time to get the bomb to heal that storm getting more terrific all the time closing in you couldn't see very far ahead of it and I thought if you don't have to believe this but this is true a voice spoke to me is that I am the Lord God I've created the heavens and the earth nature obeys me and I sit there a little bit jerked off my head nutboy somewhere I couldn't see it only thing I hear is rounding them trees somewhere I thought usually you see that light that all of you know about usually it's there but I looked at every word I couldn't see the light as it were you Oh God my Creator looked around I couldn't hear no more here is violence I waited a few minutes he said I am the Lord God that had you to speak those squirrels into existence and all of you know about that and it's so healthy for this Bible before me on this Thanksgiving morning if that isn't true God may strike me dead platform now it's true he's still just as much of God a God that could provide a ram for Abraham can provide she still Jehovah Jireh Lord can provide word Abraham get that Ram look three days journey from civilization up on top the mountain where there's no water and apathy and he had need Abba RAM and there was a ram foot in the wilderness by its horns in Abraham it went around and picked up rock all around there to make this altar but God still remains Jehovah Jireh the Lord will provide for himself whatever he's promised that he's able to do that's that word in Mathew there I mean mark 11:22 if you say to this mountain I I never could understand that you know the story about that and so help me that's true he said I am the one that provided that them squirrels he sat down one day listen again and see what he would say nothing stop wind just howling going on I have to bite myself oh let me tell you something real spiritual minds is one step from insanity did you know that a scientific research will tell you that here you are down you're slow and slumpy then you come up a little more spiritual then you're about like this then you go to like a dull ax and then to a home razor now either which side you follow there the man tries to lift the step up there he's sure to go on the wrong side if God lifts him up there he's far above the average person there's word visions and things break through there's where the kingdom of God is ports prophets and oil or considered neurotics Jesus himself is called a crazy man so if we know you're a madman got a devil mad means crazy look at all the ports and prophets through the ages have been considered that that extremely try Wow if you try to pull yourself up there you're gone you'll never make it it takes a hand reaching down from glory to hold you on that edge there between the right and wrong things you're standing all them ages were you look across interview LaLanne then on that very hour it spoke again to that very same time setting up there he said I am the one that stood on the ship that night and made the winds and the waves deceased said rise up on your feet and rebuke this storm and it'll obey exactly what you say that's been that third stage of the ministry coming it's been moving up for years I look like he's stopping it keeps worried I think oh don't but that's exactly what he done and this is him again it's just exactly his spirit again just exactly but I've had so many carnal impersonations up on the other it makes me scared to even think about it cause you're sure there's the world is always the mixed multitudes and that carnal impersonation has to follow it it did in his days it did Moses days he'll do it every day it'll do it in this thing when the Holy Spirit's trying to do the work but still if a person is spiritual the carlyle impersonation only magnifies the right one that the real article of God and standing there at that time I raised that I said Lord God great creator of nature I believe that that you speaking not one time if you ever showed me anything that was wrong not one time have you let me say anything but what come to pass I said therefore I say to this storm that's raging go to your places go back leave this alone and I a command that the Stein will shine for the next four days to these men can get their trophies and yet I can help them get me get out of these mountains and the lad God who is my solemn judge this morning that rain and things twisted within a moment's time there wasn't a bit of it I'm looking as a wind come from the other way across the top of the mountain and lifted up those clouds like that within just a matter of a few minutes the Sun was broke up right to the top and shining right down this is pretty as it could be just the same way did in Germany you remember the story in Germany when them which is 15 on one side took a scissor and cut a feather parted back this way she stood there going through their enchantments and said they'd build a tent away 30,000 people a brother argue right let's stand there and here come the star on the cloud coming right up he stood there but brother lost or many of you know the American born a German here there's my interpreter he he stood right there sighs so don't interpret this lesson Lord God you give me a vision sent me to Germany these witches and brought up the storm you're the god of creation let it be knowing that you're God no one but one could understand the English that was he does in there that no Hera was speaking about just then the tent raising up like this with 30,000 people been either jumping up and down like that settle down and the clouds and thunder roared away in less than five minutes the Sun was shining right down through one about fifteen thousand Germans came to the Lord Jesus Christ he's still God he's just as God as much as the everyone well as I stood there on that hill coming out about four days later anyone here knows the truth not one cloud was in the sky from that hour for four days now come down and go up went by gasoline when we come out of the mountains I said have you been pretty dry stood yes that's been dry said he said we're looking for a storm they come out but we don't know other things stopped me and went on down to the other side of Colorado stop and get some gas Billy Paul my son back there we were together I said let's just see what this stopped down here I drove in I said morning so we started talking to the man he said morning and I said I'm sure a beautiful day said yes you old sons coming out hot again so she sure burn us up this summer I said hey I said well that's all across the nation he said yeah I understand now this is getting almost time for your storms he said you know how said I know the papers radio and everything else to give the storm coming in the clouds come and the storm started and all at once we don't know what happened to it it all away he's still bad just as much bad as he ever was but how can a man say those things unless God tells him first to say it see not under impression but you know what you're saying then do it but wait don't try to say oh that's why many people are think and in gifts of God wait to know it's you know it's God see wait till advice comes in you hear it no it's it then you can say it's thus sayeth the Lord if it isn't thus saith the Lord then it's your impression it's what somebody else thinks people request people say this for me do this for me how can you do it if you're honest with God until God first tells you how can I tell you Gus said Jack Moore and Jack Moore hasn't said nothing to me it's got to come first from God I'm not impressed it's got to be God and then it'll happen or it is then thus saith the Lord my everybody won't have that no sir it won't be that way it never was that way it never will be that way that deals with an individual he did in the days of Noah didn't elevation of Joshua he did in the days of Moses he's always he's never made a system it's been an individual most two men either like no time they never did do them all but everybody didn't have to be Moses they didn't understand they just followed and the holy spirit of a man is a man of God will let you to part of the Holy Spirit the Bible for he is the one who does these things Jesus Christ and the farm of the Holy Ghost working in the people standing there I have started walk back down and stood there a crowd I couldn't help it to see what had happen right there in a moment and the Brethren up there now how many was there somebody here on Oh fred sauceman and him he sure was up there a little afraid what's written in to the other place is there any here now that was up theirs brother banks would say I'm in here yet is there anybody here besides Billy Paul that was up there these boys had just left yeah and brother Woods and brother Taylor are I forget the other brothers need four or five of them were standing there these brother here brother Martin had just laid left the day before all the cow the storm coming you all remember the storm the broadcast they said it was coming not what's that you met her you met them and I notice standing there I thought well I guess I'll go on the hill and I made a bow to God a few years ago going out with a full gospel businessman but I wouldn't shoot game for somebody else unless it's emergency I just wouldn't do it and your brother Jack Palmer is he here brother Jack he's from Georgia he usually comes up here he was stand there and the night before he said brother Branham hit me a deer and my just shot because I know I vowed I wouldn't do that four or five years ago calls that year I kill nineteen head of elk alone just for them businessman to sit around talk through business not have go out and kill her game and then just it seemed like pup in a murder case but I wouldn't do it take them horse at but it won't shoot it so I promised God I wouldn't do that so then I got let the place going back to start dive down the hill and a voice spoke to me said wanna walk with me I said Lord God if that's you I know that only the hand of God could part those clouds and do what you've done here in the form stun shining down drying my shirt out the steam coming up from it I said great Cathedral virgin partial and I said I believe I'll wrap up this way then Lord if you have no certain direction I want to go up there standing just in a few minutes for a little memorial to my wife by bar of our first and only honeymoon you know that we ever had a chance to go and I took her on a hunting trip and Here I am up here this year again hunting with these brethren and her down in Tucson to keep things going now start walking down through there now I got to thinking now this is going to sound very funny and I hurry because I know your service starts at about 10 minutes and so I was walking along through there and I was thinking oh why does she never had a set of words in here about going anywhere and this morning I won't tell you what happened in a few minutes I ever man ought to think this I think there's not a woman in the world like my wife she's just a wonderful person little pie stay at home she's always had my clothes ready not be I've gone on the trips or they come in say teacher a little bit say I'm your husband you - like that and kiss the children kneel down had a prayer put on my clothes to keep from having to lose my mind nearly from the crowds and things take off we go fishing or hunting way from her she's had to bear it all alone herself then I got to thinking well maybe when I'm home the only thing I'm always the only thing I know is God and His Word now I'm closely talking with now it's going on there and a presented to me said well maybe she just lets you go because it keep the people away and so forth like that and she can be a little more peaceful when your weight and I begin to accompany that thought I went like that in what I did I seen the whiskers on my face from about a week old and they were better than half grade I thought bill you're just poor you're headed you're headed right on out now you're getting old you already crossed that 50 mark so I just thinking that going on with my rifle hanging on my shoulder walking along like that and all of a sudden something happened it seemed like it ever principal I was a boy again I don't know what nidalee taking place or what it was and I look stand in front of her and there is honey and there she stood just the way she was when I married her I set my gun now to rub my eyes a look at her she held out her arms like this looked at me I bowed my head down close to going right up there for a little memorial for our anniversary stand by those trees a bunch little trees up earthquake and ask just like was up in the North Woods when we went up in Adirondack and I always go up there each 23rd day of October when I'm up there and there she was now done set my rifle down look there now I stopped a minute and I bowed my head I look back and she was still standing there with her arms yeah no I haven't surely lost my mind I looked again I thought why would this be here I was a young fella I looked at my hands I said I lord my responsibility in the world to bring your message surely this is something happened to me and I looked again then it just faded away and I picked up my rifle put on my shoulder I said maybe that you let me know that the reason it does break her heart when I have it when I come and go out hunting and things like that but as a star walking on I took off my head again I said God I know that you're here there's no doubt in my mind but what you're here and I believe you ever were you should you make that sun shining down on my back you're the one who does these things your Creator I've been so dilatory it looks like I'm afraid to take a hold I'm afraid I'll I'll do something wrong I said is one thing I will actually do lift the burden from my heart there's no need of me trying to confess anymore because for five years of constantly cried out to you what about done tell me what it is and I was talking up the little hill then right close to where I was going to stand for a few minutes just to thank the Lord for my life and for successful marriage to God to give us and the love we had for each other these years and our children I'll do that ever 23rd day of October and there's a little quake and asked him about or 10 inches thick and come up about like this and went out kind of L and went up and just as walking uphill I got real weak and I just leaned over against that tree like that now you hear something patting on the leaves just a minute now the leaves have done dried thyme I've walked there about 300 or 400 yards and I look it was water coming from my own eyes dropping off through the Greybeards down onto the ground I said Oh God oh what a failure I and standing there and that Ganesha said I trust that you'll be merciful to her I'll said ain't worthy to ask for mercy I said someday I know I'm getting grain I got a go Lord and I guess people think it's crazy but I find God out in them places that's that's it's real to me that it's just this is realest this right here and I frankly a little more so cause G all of your part there it looks like I've been standing with him alone talking to nobody but him and as I stood there I heard the brush break and I kind of raised my head up with a red shirt on now and a red band around my my hat red handkerchief wrapped around one of those Western head you know and I look and you're stood two three deer standing right by me just walked up there me and that red all that shooting over a hundred man they've been shot a forty times I guess what sure that is scattered right now but they did they just stood looked at me and find me two full-grown ponds and a big doe and something said to me there is a deer for brother Evans one for brother Welch and one for the Methodist preacher there's exactly what the Lord God has given to you now they can't get away there's no way for him to ahead a rifle hanging on my shoulder right here and before they could even got turned around I killed all three of them like that before they could even move they were dried in my hands and I and I thought there they are just the three easy to roll them right down the hill you're and then told them right on out and I thought that'd be very easy there's the three then we could go home from there take out and get out of the mountains and as a lookout in there they're standing looking at me just as tightly about 15 yards 20 well I just stood still and I don't worry you fellas hunt deer or not but there are one year they're don't or not certain they'll fix your feet like this goal and then they've watched me well there it is on things throw my coordinate they're gone then I remembered I promised God that it wouldn't do it now remember them I thought no I can't do it but isn't right I promised God that I wouldn't do it when you make a promise you stay with it God expects you to and there I thought we're just perfectly in my hands but yet I promised him I wouldn't do it I said gone mother take your babies and wanted the woods enjoy yourself I love this too you're in my hands but I don't go to Kenya and there come a little closer all how unusual that is for deer and they look at me you know and turn your head and me stand there dressed in red with a rifle stand in my hand and they walk real close to they could almost like feed him on my head and they just nosed around there a few moments turn around walk on back a little piece they stop come back again something kept saying they're right in your hands they're right in your hands the Lord is putting in your hands but I said but I promised I promised that I wouldn't do it since then I thought you know one time David was led right to the very side or job was lame and I were king Saul was laying job said to him said the Lord has delivered him into your hands but he said god forbid it odd touches him on see you must watch when you make a promise and I said I promised God that I wouldn't do it so I won't I said mother take your children along out no I'm not gonna body in my hands you couldn't get away if you had to but I'm not gonna hurt you belong to the woods and they come right back again right around I stood there I thought what is this a strange thing I'm a nature person I watch God in nature the sunset and rived that yeah like the barrel the death the resurrection again everything like the trees how Joel said about hiding the grave he keeping a sacred place and see the safley the trees and go down into the grave of the roots and come back up in the spring the resurrection everything speaking of life and the resurrection is a stood there watch them they got closer closer then they turn and walked on out in the woods and I just stood there just dumbfounded and when they went away that Bosch spoke down again that sun shining on my back do you remember your promise didn't you I said yes Lord I remember you if not promise I don't let you I can't see you Lord but you're here somewhere I said I don't see but I'm here your boss I know you're here then you kept your promise you remember your promise I remember mine too I'll never leave you in our Pacific I haven't felt the same sense I come off the mountain all day afternoon vision after vision happened that taking place come on down and seem like everything's been different since then a burden has gone about when the ministry first come to me with feeling that the person's hands what it was is a life in them and we know how it went one night in California I was setting with the malakian family a brother more remembers and brother Brown the Maliki famine and the little lady or it's going to take milk leg from childbirth and I had to put her hand I said there I didn't see the vibration of it think and I say you're going to take milk like us it's already working any and she did almost lost your mind and brother Mallika said to me sir program how do you do that I don't know Aki ji this is God and so I hand up like that I say here here's my life I know there's nothing wrong with her lay your hands upon mine honey and she did and their tumor vibrated I said sweetheart you have a tumor honey in the female glands and she said I feel no effects I said sweetheart here it is on my end raise your hand up she raised up then lay it back that's it well when we won't come along we got a very fine dr. Frayn and which school with him we took her down the examination said Billie there's nothing wrong with her but she's alright no tumor there I said salmon oh Lord not sure were see because you're examined his tumor yeah everybody over three or four years when I go to get my physical want to go overseas she goes with me for a physical and when it was never seen him about two years ago I come in one day I must tell all truth so you don't want this bypass anything you must tell all truth and I've expressed you my love for my life but yet we have to watching them things I'm telling you the truth the Heavenly Father who is my witness right here now knows is truth or if the house heart is just this that and everything the portal thing is going through the change of life at this time menopause and for the last couple years about two years ago when we had a physical then the doctor found a tumor on the left ovary it grow to about the size of a belong he said let me examine again brother branham said about three months and that goes bran has come out well then we but just before that I got something to tell you forgot that one day I come in and from the house and I was come in to do something I turn around and went out and I said she said can you go downtown with me bill and I said not right now honey and she said what are we going to do about Becky certain sorenson well honey I don't know just what to do and there's something come up and she was so nervous she could hardly hold herself together people at the house all night long like night for last even one o'clock Ramona here were people in around the house around the windows and everything so then she was real nervous and she said something to me snappy that you haven't have said it see she said then bill you're always gone and I have to take care of these children myself she said your number here we can't make our decisions together you're either a guy did she started crying when he shut the door right then I said a whole poor little powerhouse mom I started out and said read ii chronicles 22 if I Mariam rebuked Moses for marrying an Ethiopian girl be better that her father had spit in her face and to do this and I a and I said sweetheart you said the wrong thing and she was crying I said you said the wrong thing honey God's gonna make you pay for that you shouldn't have done that I tore up myself you should have said that and she said well the bill I get so tore up and I just turn him off back cause I know she wasn't that in the mood to receive it so I went back out and the next examination about a month that showed the tumor last year here come again once you try to get not was up the size of an orange the doctor said don't put it off any longer you must operate that set of fast growing tumor is malignant you consult that over and gets hooked into the side or do you go to do it's a doctor we have faith in God I never said to the church and that's let it go we start praying nice and hard god help us please I pray you help us and I'll not get tumor growing on and on then when we left to go to Tucson our doctor at home sent word to a doctor friend of his there said if you must take this tumor from miss Branham at once said if you don't return malignant told him said the tumor has already grilled within a year from the size of the longer until the size of about a grapefruit it had gotten so big there it was pushed out on her side like that the other day she she pulled a score and I said try we prayed we cried we begged everything that's going to take place then she's going had to go place let's see like yesterday but yeah yesterday she went to the doctor for the final I said well I hate to do it but we'll probably have to give in and then honey you you just have to to give in to have the habit take now closes getting some big our faith it's not sufficient so day before yesterday before I left no one she said don't call me to actually have brother Jack's service that night then tell me what kind of a meeting you had and how other people are down Shreveport and said I'll give you what the doctor said I said alright honey and I hung up yesterday day before yesterday want to start leave they're in the house I went in and always from we leading you've all the kiddies and all of us get together and needle around there and parade and the Lord we tell the Lord on a born overseas I say Lord Jesus take care of my family and they pray for me that God will help me and we can meet together again then all the kids start crying and things you know call you know how it is talk about President Kennedy being shot I've had to be guarded in any time some being shot with an infrared scope and maybe just three or four hundred yards away at nighttime they see just the same as can daytime through that spotter scope at night and I've been in Catholic countries where radicals and everything down in Mexico there where they're sent back there and send word telegram messages wrote them everything will get you tonight and so forth like that going in and out and looking for it and perhaps I will get it sometime that's alright but I've got something to take care of me when that time comes okay and then when I started to leave again just by myself the other day I knelt down one day before yesterday and out down in the room I looked around I've been there a couple days long some nobody there at the house I said Heavenly Father I pray be merciful man help me I'm going down to Shreveport to do everything I can to help your kingdom other how many times is my wife and I knelt here in the room like this we prayed and today I'm so lonesome far I said tomorrow she goes in and perhaps I'll not be able to finish my meetings because she'll perhaps they take me to the hospital for this great tumor that we asked you to take away his grow to grow up to now it must be taken away I said I I beg to you and I said Lord if she said something wrong when she won there I was torn up if she said something wrong I said Lord just think she's never one time not one time has she ever said one thing to me going in your meetings I said you she's always had my clothes cleaned ready and told me about the hand and crying pray and say if I could just do something to help the Lord and I said look at their conditions Lord and don't do it don't please don't go and I said God and help her I pray that she'll be merciful to her and she has to go through that operation help her through loser now don't want to do I'm an old man and a little kids to be raising what could I do be merciful to or large no my lover and I thought I'd pray that your helper and as I was praying I heard something say stand up on your feet I just want to hit praying cause I sought
