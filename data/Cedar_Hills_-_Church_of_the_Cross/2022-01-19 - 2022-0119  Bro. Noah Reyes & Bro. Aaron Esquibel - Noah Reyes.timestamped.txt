[48:28] amen
[48:29] i'd like to thank our pastors this this
[48:31] evening
[48:45] samuel 12
[48:58] [Music]
[49:00] m
[49:10] amen amen it says but when david saw
[49:13] that his servants whispered david
[49:15] perceived that the child was dead
[49:17] therefore david said unto his servants
[49:20] is the child dead
[49:21] and he said he is dead
[49:35] the endeavor arose from the earth and
[49:37] washed and anointed himself and changed
[49:39] his apparel and came into the house of
[49:41] the lord and worshiped and he came to
[49:44] his own house and when he required
[49:47] he set bread before him and he did eat
[50:04] then said his servants unto him what
[50:05] thing is this that thou has done thou
[50:07] didst fast and weep for the child while
[50:10] it was alive but when the child was dead
[50:13] thou didst rise and eats bread
[50:27] and he said while the child was yet
[50:29] alive i fasted and wept for i said who
[50:32] can tell whether god will be gracious to
[50:34] me that the child may live
[50:47] but now he is dead wherefore should i
[50:49] fast and i bring him
[50:51] back again i shall go to him but he
[50:54] shall not return to me.
[51:04] amen the lord has the blessings to the
[51:06] reading of the word you may be seated
[51:12] and i'd like to take as a title this
[51:14] this evening
[51:15] until the glory of god
[51:35] right and we notice david he's entered
[51:37] into prayer
[51:42] right he had gone into fasting
[51:46] and and the bible says he he had fasted
[51:48] for nearly seven days
[51:53] now
[51:54] and and the reason we we take the
[51:56] scripture
[52:01] we often expect for the lord to tell us
[52:04] yes in prayer
[52:11] we have this petition in our hearts
[52:16] and we expect for the lord to always
[52:18] tell us yes
[52:24] but
[52:25] we know that sometimes the lord tells us
[52:27] no
[52:30] no
[52:31] i don't know about you but there's been
[52:33] times where the lord tells me no no
[52:39] and it can be a difficult concept to
[52:40] grasp
[52:56] whenever we're in prayer or when we have
[52:58] a need upon our heart
[53:12] second corinthians 1 20 it says for all
[53:13] the promises of god in him are yea and
[53:16] in him amen and we'll stop there
[53:26] amen
[53:30] we
[53:31] read that first part of the verse
[53:35] and our faith goes to the roof
[53:40] all the promises
[53:52] unto the glory of god by us
[54:06] but sometimes we don't realize sometimes
[54:08] the needs that we have
[54:14] they don't always bring glory to the
[54:16] lord
[54:20] and you may ask
[54:47] but the problem is god knows the
[54:49] beginning to the end
[54:55] and when we think that we know better
[55:00] god is the one that knows best
[55:06] now if you keep reading that
[55:09] that that story there you see
[55:13] we read a small part of it
[55:17] i like what david did
[55:22] after david had committed this
[55:24] this terrible sin
[55:29] yet he was a man after god's own heart
[55:41] he gets up and he goes into the house of
[55:43] the lord
[55:58] and yet you go into the house of the
[56:00] lord
[56:03] and you worship
[56:05] and it says then they brought bread unto
[56:07] him
[56:14] after the lord
[56:41] against god shall the thing form say to
[56:43] him that formed it why has thou made me
[56:46] thus
[57:10] sometimes we we might have a good job
[57:14] lined up
[57:18] and we pray lord this job would be
[57:20] awesome for me
[57:38] you don't know what the future holds for
[57:40] you
[57:43] right i was speaking to a cousin of mine
[57:49] and we we were kind of talking about
[57:50] courtship yesterday
[57:56] you know often times you know we think
[57:58] oh lord this girl she's the one for me
[58:06] i mean she's is a good christian girl
[58:09] yes
[58:11] don't you want me to marry a good
[58:12] christian girl
[58:16] sure he does
[58:19] but maybe the lord doesn't want her to
[58:21] marry you
[58:26] you might make her life miserable
[58:31] right we have to be honest with
[58:33] ourselves
[58:36] so we
[58:37] let's get to this here for a moment
[58:41] how many know that the abc's of the
[58:43] bible
[58:47] someone can shout it out that's right
[58:50] always believe christ
[58:54] we could hold on to that
[58:57] that would keep us out of a lot of
[58:59] trouble
[59:02] right sometimes we have questions in our
[59:04] minds
[59:07] we have certain doubts
[59:10] and if we were to hold on to that
[59:16] always believe christ
[59:19] that the lord would reveal to us those
[59:22] questions
[59:26] the devil he comes to take advantage in
[59:28] those moments
[59:37] and he comes and he tries to plant some
[59:38] seed of discrepancy
[59:44] he wants to place unbelief in your life
[59:48] [Music]
[59:50] and we know we know the message says
[59:52] unbelief is sin
[59:54] [Music]
[59:56] where brother branham says always
[59:58] believe christ
[1:00:03] to know him is life
[1:00:10] so we want to know him is that right
[1:00:23] it looks great things are going right
[1:00:55] do we turn the other cheek
[1:01:00] and say as our lord jesus christ
[1:01:05] lord forgive them
[1:01:08] for they know not what they do
[1:01:12] what a statement from our lord jesus
[1:01:14] christ
[1:01:18] in the ultimate act of love
[1:01:23] the lord utters these words
[1:01:29] forgive them
[1:01:32] they don't know what they do
[1:01:36] and many times we think these these uh
[1:01:38] these attacks come from our enemies
[1:01:45] but what happens when it comes from our
[1:01:46] friends
[1:01:49] amigo and it comes from our own brothers
[1:02:03] and one shall say unto him what are
[1:02:05] these wounds in thy hands
[1:02:12] and he shall answer
[1:02:15] those with which i was wounded in the
[1:02:17] house of my friends
[1:02:43] we
[1:02:45] begin to pray for all these things
[1:02:49] and then suddenly our brother
[1:02:51] this brother he's always late
[1:02:57] this is just the lord trying you yes
[1:03:11] what happens when we can't cope
[1:03:27] what happens when we can't cope
[1:03:54] a backpack of circumstances
[1:04:21] in the book of james it says and at the
[1:04:24] end when sen is finished
[1:04:35] bring his first death
[1:04:41] brother will mention something during
[1:04:42] the the panel on on sunday
[1:04:49] mingo where we we want to change people
[1:05:05] why do you do that brother
[1:05:19] and what your brother is struggling with
[1:05:23] hermano sure that was easy for you to
[1:05:26] overcome
[1:05:29] but in this other thing over here
[1:05:34] it was between life or death
[1:05:39] you had to fight hard to overcome that
[1:05:43] right so so we try to change people
[1:05:48] yet we
[1:06:26] desperate is god which worketh in you
[1:06:28] both to will and to do
[1:06:30] of
[1:07:40] surrenders itself unto the will of god
[1:07:46] as paul said
[1:07:50] it is no longer i that lives
[1:07:54] it
[1:08:08] and
[1:08:48] and lord if it takes a broken heart that
[1:08:50] you need
[1:09:19] it isn't because the lord wants to
[1:09:20] punish you when when he says no
[1:09:27] it's because he loves you
[1:09:30] right he knows what's best for your life
[1:09:47] you gethsemane
[1:09:50] he said lord
[1:09:52] if this cup can pass
[1:09:55] but lord not my will
[1:09:58] your will be done
[1:10:12] whom god would make known what is the
[1:10:15] riches of the glory of his mystery
[1:10:19] of this mystery among the gentiles
[1:10:21] which is christ in you
[1:10:23] the hope of glory
[1:10:28] gloria
[1:10:36] john 16 21
[1:10:40] a woman when she is in travail has
[1:10:42] sorrow because her hour has come
[1:10:45] but as soon as she is delivered of the
[1:10:47] child she remembers no more the anguish
[1:10:49] for the joy that a man is born into the
[1:10:52] world
[1:11:08] whenever you
[1:11:11] there's times where
[1:11:12] you see your brother
[1:11:15] or he's going through a rough time
[1:11:20] but
[1:11:21] as brother branham teaches us
[1:11:31] as brother will said we can't change
[1:11:33] people
[1:11:37] we try and force them to to change
[1:11:42] but what we are able to change
[1:11:50] brother brown says we're creators of
[1:11:51] atmospheres
[1:12:06] it changes the atmosphere
[1:12:08] it begins to create an atmosphere
[1:12:12] an atmosphere in that fellowship yes
[1:12:16] it begins to sanctify
[1:12:18] vienna

[1:14:33] amen god bless you all this evening
[1:14:36] sure is good to be in the house of the
[1:14:37] lord
[1:14:38] give one to the lord this evening
[1:14:43] like to thank our pastor for giving me
[1:14:45] the opportunity to speak here this
[1:14:47] evening
[1:14:51] as i just read this title here i get
[1:14:53] inspired
[1:15:07] we're just going to start at verse 14 to
[1:15:08] save some time
[1:15:15] when you're happy
[1:15:16] man
[1:15:18] meet all those online i know there's
[1:15:19] many that are in their homes sick
[1:15:20] afflicted
[1:15:24] but as the word of god goes forth this
[1:15:26] evening i pray that you reach out and
[1:15:27] claim what's yours
[1:15:34] verse 14 reads
[1:15:36] and he took the mantle of elijah that
[1:15:38] fell from him
[1:15:40] and smote the waters
[1:15:42] and said where is the lord god of elijah
[1:15:46] and when he had also smitten the waters
[1:15:48] they parted hither and thither and
[1:15:50] elisha went over
[1:15:52] it
[1:16:01] hey man what is
[1:16:17] so how many remember the title from
[1:16:18] sunday's
[1:16:30] the fingerprints of god amen
[1:16:37] [Music]
[1:16:45] we know that god vindicated his prophet
[1:16:47] by taking his picture with him amen
[1:16:53] and this just goes to say yes
[1:16:56] this is god saying you know i'll i'll
[1:16:58] get man's best expert to verify this
[1:17:00] photo
[1:17:19] now what's so interesting about
[1:17:21] mr george lacy here
[1:17:24] george lacy not just that he worked for
[1:17:26] the fbi no solamente que trabajo
[1:17:41] and the only conclusion that he can come
[1:18:05] what a beautiful thing that is when god
[1:18:07] can put his fingerprint upon our lives
[1:18:15] so as our pastor was speaking on sunday
[1:18:19] domingo and he was hitting on the point
[1:18:21] of timothy and paul
[1:18:24] pablo and he was saying how
[1:18:27] you know paul knew that timothy had a
[1:18:29] gift of faith inside of him
[1:18:37] and there came a point where
[1:18:39] in timothy's life you are
[1:18:42] excuse me he goes on to say on sunday
[1:18:44] that what a thing it is when a son or
[1:18:47] daughter of god can
[1:18:48] recognize that they do have that faith
[1:18:50] that maybe their fathers or their
[1:18:51] grandparents had
[1:19:00] [Music]
[1:19:17] and maybe elijah had uh had noticed that
[1:19:20] elisha had a gift inside of him
[1:19:25] maybe elisha knew that he had a gift
[1:19:27] inside of him
[1:19:31] but maybe that gift hadn't been stirred
[1:19:33] up yeah
[1:19:39] [Music]
[1:19:44] tonight that there's some shaking going
[1:19:46] on
[1:20:31] but i believe elijah found himself in a
[1:20:33] in a tough situation
[1:20:40] the one that he looked at for so long
[1:21:40] is
[1:21:45] [Applause]
[1:22:24] that word's gotta be inside of our house
[1:22:27] okay let's try to throw the word at your
[1:22:29] problem
[1:22:32] you gotta live it
[1:22:34] you've gotta be backed up
[1:23:04] is
[1:23:18] and that's why i appreciate
[1:23:21] you the job that brother julian is doing
[1:23:25] what is he doing
[1:23:27] he's not just getting a bunch of stories
[1:23:31] no what he's doing is getting a bunch of
[1:23:32] blueprints together
[1:23:37] maybe there's some elijah's in here
[1:23:41] they just need to be a little bit
[1:23:42] inspired
[1:23:45] i believe each one of you have a gift
[1:24:00] just sitting on the bench
[1:24:08] it's no coincidence
[1:24:09] coincidence yeah satan two is trying to
[1:24:11] stir gifts
[1:24:13] is
[1:24:41] he knows it with our children
[1:25:07] whatever you have in your hand you've
[1:25:09] got to use it for the honor and glory
[1:25:18] and we stopped at a travel center
[1:25:23] and normally i don't like coffee from
[1:25:25] gas stations
[1:25:30] it tastes like water and it's just yes
[1:25:36] but we were on the road and peros
[1:26:07] the uh um
[1:26:09] cafe escudo i was like damn they got a
[1:26:10] pretty good setup
[1:26:14] so i go ahead and give me the coffee and
[1:26:16] i get in the car
[1:26:20] i take one sip
[1:26:31] i was thinking man that's how christians
[1:26:33] have become today
[1:27:18] religion i want to serve a living
[1:27:20] resurrection
[1:27:23] touched by the feeling of my opinion
[1:27:27] i gotta know i have a direct line with
[1:27:28] you
[1:27:30] yes so this takes me to my
[1:27:33] little testimony here yes
[1:27:37] a couple weeks back
[1:27:42] my dad and i decided to go on a deer
[1:27:44] hunt
[1:27:59] i had two great opportunities a really
[1:28:01] nice buck
[1:28:06] and
[1:28:07] i just didn't sell the deal with him you
[1:28:09] know
[1:28:11] and so i had asked the lord that he
[1:28:12] would you know give me a buck and it
[1:28:14] didn't happen
[1:28:19] so we came home that weekend
[1:28:23] and i was just thinking you know what
[1:28:24] maybe i just blew the opportunities
[1:28:37] do you feel like the situation could
[1:28:39] have been any better it's not it builds
[1:29:08] so
[1:29:31] [Music]
[1:29:36] and he wasn't going to stop you know eva
[1:29:39] so i kind of gave out a little grunt
[1:29:42] he stopped and looked at me for about
[1:29:43] two seconds
[1:29:48] and it looked like he was a good shot
[1:29:52] [Music]
[1:30:04] long story short i didn't find the deer
[1:30:06] no no no yeah i know i had hit him
[1:30:08] because he was leaving little drops of
[1:30:09] blood thank you very much
[1:30:14] and so i pray to the lord
[1:30:16] i said lord
[1:30:29] and so we spent that whole day looking
[1:30:31] for that book he is
[1:30:44] so
[1:30:46] it was the the next day
[1:30:49] right when we're leaving the place that
[1:30:51] we're hunting
[1:30:55] we turn the corner
[1:30:57] and he was just standing there
[1:31:00] he
[1:31:12] and i was 14 yards away from this buck
[1:31:22] by the way the first time i had just
[1:31:23] nicked him maybe just enough to just
[1:31:25] draw some blood out of his brisket area
[1:31:27] here la primera
[1:31:33] and i just got tunnel vision because i
[1:31:36] was caught up in the moment
[1:31:38] in the moment i noticed there's a big
[1:31:40] branch hanging out about 10 feet in
[1:31:42] front of me
[1:32:10] this is it you gave me another
[1:32:12] opportunity this book is mine
[1:32:18] well i didn't find the buck
[1:32:24] so then this last weekend
[1:32:27] we go out again
[1:32:29] spend all day looking for the hurt
[1:32:35] find the deer again but the buck's not
[1:32:37] in there yeah
[1:32:40] i told my dad well let's go ahead and
[1:32:41] leave because i want to be back by youth
[1:32:43] prayer that night
[1:32:50] so we're leaving where we're hunting
[1:33:05] and i
[1:33:06] even had to take a double look yeah
[1:33:15] and i wanted my dad to take him
[1:33:19] so we parked the vehicle
[1:33:22] and we get out and i'm even filming my
[1:33:24] dad
[1:33:28] and my dad could have easily made this
[1:33:30] shot
[1:33:33] it was 48 yards
[1:33:37] and the buck's just standing there
[1:33:40] slowly making his way into the open
[1:33:42] camera
[1:33:44] he doesn't even know we're there
[1:33:47] all of a sudden he just takes off
[1:33:49] running out of nowhere
[1:33:52] he wasn't spooked he was just no no
[1:33:55] we're thinking he smelled some dough
[1:33:56] here and he just takes off running
[1:34:02] well before that my dad had taken a shot
[1:34:04] at him
[1:34:09] so i was standing there my dad went
[1:34:11] after him and i was standing there with
[1:34:12] my phone i was like well i better
[1:34:14] establish
[1:34:15] it
[1:34:19] i better grab my bow and just go in
[1:34:20] there maybe there's some another buck
[1:34:22] with him
[1:34:26] and so i start you know walking real
[1:34:28] quietly into some thick brush
[1:34:41] and there's nothing between me and him
[1:34:42] he's about 80 yards away
[1:35:13] would look at me and i would just freeze
[1:35:18] and you look back at my dad and i just
[1:35:20] start you know sneaking in real quiet
[1:35:25] so i got to about 48 50 yards
[1:35:31] and i said lord this is as far as as i'm
[1:35:33] going to get on this deer
[1:35:38] um
[1:35:40] i just pray
[1:35:54] and he looked right at me again
[1:35:57] and he must not have seen me because i
[1:35:58] was just standing there and right when
[1:36:00] he turned his ears i light a narrow flag
[1:36:06] and it nailed him
[1:36:08] well he takes off running island
[1:36:11] jumps into some private property
[1:36:15] and he cleared about a seven foot fence
[1:36:21] so i was thinking man maybe
[1:36:35] so i went to find some blood and there
[1:36:37] was no blood if we uh
[1:36:41] and so my dad said well wait here i'll
[1:36:42] leave my bow and i'll go in there and
[1:36:44] see if i can at least spot him and see
[1:36:46] if he's bedded or what's going on
[1:37:58] inspire my dad to go just the right way
[1:38:00] so he doesn't pressure him too far
[1:38:02] inspira
[1:38:04] correct
[1:38:06] those of you who hunt no a wounded deer
[1:38:09] will just keep going and going and just
[1:38:10] let them be lost
[1:38:26] there was coyotes all over the place
[1:38:41] i was expecting the deer just to come
[1:38:56] m
[1:39:24] and i just i just broke down
[1:39:28] lord you heard my prayer
[1:39:32] and what was more tremendous about it
[1:39:36] my dad said that the deer was actually
[1:39:38] trying to make his way to
[1:39:51] and
[1:39:52] so i was just so overjoyed that the lord
[1:39:55] would even hear my prayer at that moment
[1:40:01] and i never doubted that the lord don't
[1:40:03] hear my prayers
[1:40:55] i just want to
[1:40:57] give all honor to the lord jesus
[1:41:00] christ i want to thank you all for
[1:41:05] for listening this evening
