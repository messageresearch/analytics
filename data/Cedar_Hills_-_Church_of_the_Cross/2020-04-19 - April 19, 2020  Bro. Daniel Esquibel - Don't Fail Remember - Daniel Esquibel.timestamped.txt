[21:31] to be in the house of the
[21:34] Lord welcome you all God bless
[21:39] you I never shall forget the
[21:43] day I think it was uh uh last week when
[21:46] we
[21:48] heard I think it was brother Tommy junr
[21:50] who said he had preached to one
[21:55] person right but I'll never forget the
[21:58] the
[21:59] day that one day I was
[22:02] down my my my dad had just passed
[22:07] away and and our pastor had just gotten
[22:12] sick and I was down and
[22:19] out I was at the lowest point in my
[22:23] life and that's when Satan came to
[22:26] me and he said I'm going to kill
[22:29] you but I'll never forget that
[22:33] day there something inside of
[22:36] me something started to
[22:38] move and all of a sudden I began to
[22:42] preach and I preached for 30
[22:45] minutes to
[22:47] myself and it was a
[22:50] jubilee and I'll never forget that
[22:53] day and I'm sure that if you're going
[22:56] through anything tonight
[22:59] I know that there there's something that
[23:01] you can anchor on
[23:03] to and that's the day that he came and
[23:08] he showed
[23:09] up what an awesome God we serve
[23:15] amen amen if we can get right to our
[23:17] scripture
[23:20] this I I want to give you we've heard we
[23:22] heard tremendous message this
[23:26] morning and the tremendous sermons that
[23:29] we have
[23:31] heard uh the series of our pastor the
[23:39] parallel and every week you just
[23:43] think it just can't get any better than
[23:48] that and then it does
[23:52] wow so I'm GNA make a statement right
[23:56] now but you're not going to understand
[23:58] understand it until the end of the
[24:00] service or the message
[24:02] yes what a terrible God we
[24:08] serve right so you of you that don't
[24:11] know
[24:13] Spanish you're going to have to wait for
[24:15] the
[24:19] interpretation but we're going through
[24:21] things in
[24:24] life that I hear every day
[24:28] if God is so
[24:31] good why do these things
[24:35] happen and he sends his
[24:38] word what a terrible
[24:41] God Amen all right so you can take your
[24:44] seats I'm
[24:46] gonna before we take our seats I'm going
[24:48] to read a scripture
[24:51] for and it's simply Ephesians
[24:56] 4:30 and it says
[24:58] says and grieve not the holy spirit of
[25:04] God whereby you are sealed into the day
[25:07] of
[25:12] redemption amen you may be seated
[25:16] amen grieve not the Holy
[25:20] Spirit we really like the
[25:24] scriptures when it says look
[25:28] up your Redemption draw
[25:32] nigh right and we're real happy with
[25:37] that because of our Redemption dry
[25:42] nigh but the holy spirit says
[25:47] today grieve not the Holy
[25:51] Spirit whereby you are
[25:56] sealed until the day of your
[26:02] Redemption amen amen so we find
[26:05] ourselves in a
[26:07] test so my title tonight
[26:13] is don't
[26:15] fail don't fail the
[26:20] test with a
[26:23] subtitle
[26:26] remember right
[26:28] I never shall forget the
[26:31] day but the prophet of God
[26:35] says in possessing the gates of the
[26:39] enemy paragraph nine he
[26:42] says God had been testing the
[26:47] patriarch because he had given him a
[26:51] promise and when God makes a
[26:56] promise he wants to be
[26:59] sure that this person is worthy of the
[27:06] promise so God has many promises for
[27:12] you and we can hold on to those
[27:17] promises because they're
[27:20] true but there's something that we have
[27:22] to do on our
[27:25] part and he says before he fulfills what
[27:27] he
[27:31] says or what he
[27:34] promises so Abraham had been
[27:40] promised that through his seed the whole
[27:43] world would be
[27:49] blessed and he would have a
[27:53] son and this
[27:55] son out of whom should come forth a
[28:01] seed that would bless the whole
[28:05] earth and Abraham when he was Pro when
[28:09] the promise was given to
[28:12] him was 75 years
[28:17] old and Sarah his wife was 65 years
[28:23] old but the Bible tells us that Abraham
[28:27] stag Ed not at the promise of
[28:32] God and God Time After
[28:41] Time Ted him amen but he had come to
[28:46] that final
[28:49] test before the blessing was going to
[28:54] happen and that's the way it is with all
[28:57] the Seed of
[29:00] Abraham God gives us a final
[29:05] test just before he gives the
[29:11] promise and if it was
[29:14] possible I'd like to say something
[29:18] here personally but I will withhold
[29:23] it that final
[29:26] test to see how you'll react upon
[29:36] it and when he had gave Abraham this
[29:42] test he found Abraham just as true as he
[29:45] was when he
[29:51] started now what a blessing it would be
[29:54] this
[29:56] morning if we who take his promise of
[30:02] healing would stand just as true as we
[30:09] did when we stood here and accepted
[30:15] it now there's a
[30:19] test will you
[30:22] pass or will you
[30:24] fail
[30:26] right now
[30:28] we find ourselves in circumstances
[30:32] today but I want to tell
[30:36] you as you hear on the
[30:44] radio this is only a test of the
[30:49] broadcast right this is only a
[30:53] test so I want you to know
[30:58] but that what we're going through right
[31:01] now that you can be sure of one
[31:06] thing that God is
[31:11] merciful and he's
[31:14] graceful that he would give you a
[31:18] test what Mercy that God had on
[31:24] us that he would give us a test
[31:27] because without a
[31:29] test there is no
[31:32] promise you can read the
[31:34] Bible but the promises are not for
[31:39] you if there is no
[31:42] test now we are in a
[31:46] test now up until the
[31:50] test everything that you
[31:53] say or every thought that you have
[31:59] does not mean absolutely
[32:02] nothing you can
[32:04] say I'm a
[32:06] Christian you can say I go to
[32:09] church you can say I'm
[32:12] anchored you can say I can
[32:16] stand but until the
[32:19] test everything you
[32:22] say means absolutely
[32:26] nothing as we heard this
[32:29] morning Elohim El he was there by
[32:33] himself existing all
[32:36] alone but inside of
[32:39] him there was
[32:41] attributes he knew that he was a
[32:44] God he knew that he was a
[32:46] father he knew that he was a
[32:49] savior he knew that he was a
[32:52] redeemer but what
[32:54] happened is that he had to believe
[32:58] his own
[32:59] word that's why without
[33:03] faith it is
[33:05] impossible to please God because in the
[33:09] beginning God himself he had to have
[33:13] faith in his own
[33:15] word and that is the standard
[33:18] by which he gives
[33:20] us is his
[33:23] word
[33:25] now we're going to go to the
[33:28] Natural okay okay
[33:32] now
[33:34] today we should
[33:36] be in is a time that we should
[33:40] be in our
[33:46] tiptop not
[33:49] physical right but we should be in good
[33:51] physical
[33:55] condition but we should be in
[33:59] tiptop spiritual
[34:02] condition
[34:04] right we should be okay so we call
[34:07] ourselves Christians
[34:10] right okay so we should be
[34:14] tiptop in
[34:16] condition
[34:18] Christians right amen so if it's in the
[34:23] natural so you take an athlete for
[34:26] instance
[34:28] now uh a football
[34:31] player or a track
[34:34] star right he's got to be in tiptop
[34:37] physical
[34:39] condition that's his
[34:42] craft right so do we take a fighter for
[34:47] example right so everybody is born a
[34:51] fighter right you fight
[34:55] to that's that's seed fights to get to
[34:58] the
[35:01] womb it's a fight to get out of
[35:05] there it's a fight just to take your
[35:10] breath everybody's born a
[35:14] fighter now you take a a fighter for
[35:19] example now he
[35:21] believes that he can
[35:24] fight with the best of them
[35:27] right amen amen inside of him is a
[35:31] belief that he can match
[35:34] up with the world's
[35:37] best right so he
[35:40] trains he gets into the
[35:44] gym now it's first a
[35:47] thought right so many of
[35:50] us a lot of times we
[35:52] think oh I can hit the I can hit the
[35:55] gym right and I can I'm gonna I'm gonna
[35:58] do a mile
[36:00] today right and we start off I'll never
[36:04] forget when we were kids they had a
[36:08] marathon in in Silver
[36:10] City Silver City and I remember our
[36:12] pastor ran in
[36:15] it and my sister
[36:18] Janette and my
[36:20] cousins I used to think man my cousins
[36:22] are tough
[36:25] man
[36:27] I bet you those guys those guys could
[36:31] go I was just a little
[36:34] guy and there the race
[36:37] started and and I saw Janette take
[36:41] off I was like man oh my God my cousin
[36:46] was right behind
[36:48] her and they were
[36:52] G man they're
[36:54] bad right oh see and so then when you
[36:59] get to the Finish
[37:02] Line I saw another
[37:05] guy and our pastor right I think you
[37:09] either took first or second
[37:12] right right right and I thought
[37:15] man and and our pastor he was small
[37:20] thing he was a little
[37:22] scrawny and here he comes running at the
[37:25] end of the race
[37:27] [Applause]
[37:29] right and that's how we do many
[37:33] times we take off real
[37:38] fast now we're talking
[37:41] spiritually we go into
[37:44] hiding right we begin to do what's told
[37:47] of
[37:48] us and we begin to run real
[37:52] fast but then all of a sudden we're not
[37:55] in spiritual condition
[37:58] and all of a sudden we begin to fade
[38:03] back We Begin to Fall
[38:05] Down We Begin not to read our
[38:09] BBL we revert
[38:12] back social
[38:15] media to the things of the
[38:17] world and the
[38:19] promise begins to go
[38:24] far how come
[38:27] because we
[38:28] haven't been
[38:30] able to pass the
[38:34] test now a
[38:36] fighter in his mind he can do it every
[38:41] fighter you hear them all the
[38:44] time in the
[38:46] natural oh I can
[38:49] easily I am
[38:52] easily can beat Floyd
[38:55] Mayweather Mayweather I'm bigger than he
[38:59] is I'm faster than he
[39:02] is I'm this and I'm that and he believes
[39:07] it right he's got to believe
[39:10] it but up until the
[39:14] test he's just all
[39:18] talk right amen they say I hit harder
[39:21] than he
[39:22] does right so he begins to
[39:25] train
[39:27] and he begins to train his
[39:29] body and he trains and he
[39:32] trains and then all of a
[39:35] sudden he's got to reach that final
[39:40] test and the day
[39:42] comes that it's time to get into the
[39:46] ring and then all of a
[39:49] sudden he trained his physical
[39:53] body but then all of a sudden he
[39:58] realizes you can't
[40:01] train
[40:04] heart you can't
[40:06] train
[40:08] spirit and you can't
[40:11] train your
[40:13] soul right amen those are Promises of
[40:17] God but all of a sudden he gets in the
[40:21] ring and physically he can hold up for a
[40:23] little
[40:25] bit but then all of a
[40:28] sudden he hits
[40:30] him and nothing
[40:33] happens everything that he was built
[40:35] himself
[40:38] on was that I'm more
[40:42] powerful and he throws his
[40:45] punch and he walks right through
[40:48] it all of a
[40:50] sudden because he didn't train his
[40:55] mind because the Bible
[40:59] says trust in the Lord thy
[41:02] God with all of th
[41:06] heart with all of th
[41:09] mind with all your
[41:11] spirit and all of your
[41:13] soul all of a
[41:15] sudden he finds
[41:18] out that he doesn't have the mental
[41:22] capacity his mind isn't strong enough
[41:27] and all of a sudden unbelief sets
[41:31] in oh he was walking real
[41:35] high but then all of a
[41:37] sudden unbelief sets
[41:40] in and the minute unbelief sets
[41:45] in fear takes
[41:50] over and that's what's
[41:52] happened and that's what happens
[41:55] today
[41:57] because we're not in spiritual
[42:01] condition We Begin to Fall
[42:03] Down we begin to fail the
[42:07] test so no matter your
[42:10] potential if there isn't a
[42:14] test it's all
[42:19] talk so and then you talk to the
[42:23] trainer what happened to your fighter
[42:27] oh man he's fast in the
[42:29] gym I mean he's he's he can go he's
[42:34] powerful
[42:35] right but he's not at an
[42:39] elite he's not at the elite class
[42:44] yet well what happened what do you think
[42:46] it wasn't
[42:49] happening he just didn't train his
[42:53] mind right amen well what what happened
[42:56] I don't
[42:57] know what do you think trainer what what
[43:00] what what can you tell
[43:02] him he needs to learn to let his hands
[43:09] go cuz fear sets
[43:12] in right amen
[43:16] Jeremiah the word
[43:19] says before I formed thee in the
[43:24] belly I knew thee
[43:27] right
[43:29] amen how much more confidence could you
[43:31] have than
[43:34] that that when God himself
[43:37] says before I knew before I formed
[43:42] you I knew you and I chose you and I
[43:47] ordained you but let me tell you one
[43:51] thing he says fear
[43:53] not in verse eight
[43:56] it says Be not
[43:58] Afraid be not afraid of their
[44:02] faces no matter what they tell
[44:05] you it doesn't matter if they're
[44:07] laughing at
[44:08] you he's saying don't be afraid of their
[44:14] smiles be not afraid of their
[44:17] faces for I am with
[44:21] thee to deliver Thee sayi the
[44:25] Lord says fear
[44:28] not so but that word there
[44:31] fear does not
[44:34] mean
[44:36] afraid says fear
[44:38] not that's why the Bible
[44:41] says fear not don't be
[44:45] afraid of him that can destroy the
[44:49] body but
[44:51] fear that's a different fear it's not be
[44:54] afraid
[44:56] [Music]
[44:57] it's a
[44:59] reverence but fear
[45:01] Him in other words he's
[45:04] saying don't be afraid of him but trust
[45:08] him trust him believe in him don't be
[45:13] afraid of
[45:14] him but trust
[45:18] him believe
[45:20] him that can
[45:23] destroy the body
[45:27] and the
[45:28] soul but he says here in verse uh let me
[45:33] get my glasses
[45:36] here all right let's
[45:39] see and he says over here in verse
[45:43] 17 he says Thou therefore g g up thy
[45:49] loin and that's what I'm telling you
[45:53] today a word of encouragement
[45:57] therefore G up thy
[45:59] loins and

[46:06] Slumber arise from your
[46:10] Slumber wake

[46:18] me G up th
[46:21] loin and arise and speak unto them all
[46:24] that I command thee

[46:29] dismayed don't be
[46:32] afraid be not
[46:34] dism or and we and we jump and Shout
[46:37] with that
[46:39] right oh we don't have to be
[46:42] afraid no we don't have to be
[46:44] afraid no he's saying not to be afraid
[46:48] he's saying be not
[46:51] dism trust
[46:53] me fear me h
[46:59] fear me trust me believe
[47:02] me be not
[47:04] dismayed be not
[47:07] confounded don't be
[47:09] confounded right am but what he's
[47:12] telling you if you don't believe
[47:15] me or you don't trust
[47:17] me L I'll confound
[47:21] them I'll confound
[47:24] you right amen saying Be not Afraid be
[47:29] not
[47:30] dismayed be not
[47:33] confounded but if you don't believe what
[47:35] I'm telling
[47:36] you if you can't believe the
[47:40] voice of the sign that I have
[47:44] placed I'm going to confound
[47:46] you you're going to be
[47:48] confounded you're not going to know
[47:51] what's up and what's down because you
[47:55] don't
[47:56] believe but you have become
[48:03] afraid now that's words of encouragement
[48:05] for
[48:07] you now as we heard this
[48:10] morning we heard from our
[48:15] prophet he says now it started in the
[48:19] beginning what started in the
[48:22] beginning just believed one
[48:24] word
[48:26] right we heard that this
[48:29] morning just believed one
[48:32] word broke one
[48:36] word it's got to be word by
[48:40] word you have to believe the
[48:44] word by word he
[48:46] said now that
[48:49] word is
[48:51] Christ
[48:54] right
[48:56] that one
[48:58] word was Christ and we found out that
[49:02] Eve she took that one
[49:06] word she took that one
[49:09] word Lord which was Christ which was
[49:14] ownership now you can say I believe in
[49:18] God and you can say that you
[49:21] believe but brother Brown said this
[49:24] morning
[49:26] if you don't live
[49:27] it you don't believe
[49:31] it
[49:32] right
[49:34] so how do I
[49:36] believe as we heard from our brother
[49:40] Abraham how do I
[49:43] believe separate
[49:46] yourself right God wants a
[49:51] separator you got to separate
[49:54] yourself can you give me Exodus
[50:04] 9:119 and this was uh
[50:08] Moses and and he had gone to
[50:12] pharaoh and the word of the Lord had
[50:14] come to
[50:16] Moses and it said send therefore
[50:20] now and gather thy
[50:22] cattle and all that thou Hast in the
[50:25] field
[50:27] for upon every man and every
[50:30] Beast which shall be found in the
[50:34] field and shall not be brought
[50:37] in or brought
[50:39] home the hail shall come down upon them
[50:42] and they shall die and they shall
[50:45] die so look at the mercy of
[50:50] God God didn't have to warn
[50:53] him God didn't have to send them a
[50:58] warning but you know God doesn't find
[51:04] pleasure in
[51:06] judgments the Bible says he doesn't find
[51:09] pleasure in
[51:14] pestilence give me the verse
[51:18] again he doesn't find pleasure in those
[51:21] things but what's his
[51:24] purpose is so that you can
[51:27] repent and draw an eye unto
[51:31] him that you can go into your secret
[51:36] chamber the secret chamber as we
[51:41] heard is not the
[51:43] Internet it's not
[51:48] folies different
[51:50] things he says I've giving you an
[51:54] opportunity
[51:55] to seek my
[51:58] face and there's only one secret
[52:03] chamber and that's the secret closet of
[52:09] prayer he's giving you the
[52:12] opportunity to get calluses on your
[52:17] knees he wants you to draw n unto
[52:21] him and all they had to
[52:24] do
[52:26] believe
[52:27] Moses he said I'm going to send a hail
[52:32] stor get all of your
[52:35] stuff get all of your
[52:39] gains everything that you
[52:41] got get your
[52:43] children get your family get your cattle
[52:48] get
[52:49] everything get inside the
[52:52] house and stay in there and all they had
[52:56] to
[52:57] do was believe
[52:59] Moses but we find out in
[53:02] Isaiah in that they said we don't we we
[53:06] have other things that we have built
[53:10] up we can escape The
[53:12] [Applause]
[53:14] Hil we can escape the
[53:17] pestilence and it says how are we going
[53:19] to do
[53:20] it they said we're going to take all of
[53:22] our
[53:24] money we're going to write this
[53:29] out we're going to write it
[53:31] out let me tell you the Bible says that
[53:36] if you didn't believe
[53:39] Moses that the hell would
[53:42] fall and it would run into your
[53:46] house and wipe out all your
[53:50] gain why because they didn't believe
[53:54] Moses
[53:56] and that's all we have to do
[53:58] today God has given us God has been
[54:04] merciful to give us a
[54:06] test and to give us a
[54:09] man of Holy Ghost filled
[54:14] man that can stand
[54:17] here and tell
[54:19] you my children get into your
[54:23] houses stay there for a
[54:27] while get into communion with
[54:31] God and sometimes and most of the
[54:35] time we find ourselves failing the
[54:41] test God told
[54:43] Moses he said come up to the
[54:47] mountain God gave him two
[54:50] calls right he said Moses come up to the
[54:55] the
[54:56] mountain right Aaron and the
[55:01] priest there was only one
[55:05] man was called to the top of the
[55:10] mountain halfway up the mountain if you
[55:12] read
[55:14] it I don't have time to read it right
[55:18] now but a halfway up the mountain he
[55:20] told the
[55:23] others you stay down
[55:26] right amen that's right he called him he
[55:29] said Moses come up and that's what he's
[55:31] done to us
[55:34] this that's what he's done with these
[55:36] messages of the
[55:41] parallel in these series that we've been
[55:46] hearing come up to where I
[55:50] am and if you read the
[55:54] scripture he said he said Moses come
[55:58] up to the top of the
[56:01] mountain and be
[56:07] there like Moses come on to the top of
[56:09] the
[56:12] mountain do this do that do
[56:15] that he said come up to the
[56:19] mountain be
[56:23] there that's it
[56:26] just be
[56:28] there and guess
[56:30] what six
[56:33] days mes just stay
[56:37] there quietly the Bible
[56:43] says we can't even sit for two
[56:49] minutes that's
[56:51] right we can't even sit for two
[56:53] minutes
[56:56] before before people start getting
[57:01] itchy they start getting
[57:03] nervous
[57:11] neotic I'm gonna check I'm gonna check
[57:13] the
[57:20] news or you know you're another
[57:23] page wow look at that
[57:27] wow

[57:40] me trust in the Lord your
[57:44] God Moses was
[57:48] there all of a sudden the Lord
[57:52] came the God himself came
[58:01] down he told Moses stand on that
[58:06] rock stand over
[58:09] there oh brothers and sisters

[58:15] Rock we have that same hiding
[58:19] place he's given us his
[58:22] word and that word is Christ
[58:25] and we're anchored in the Rock of
[58:29] Ages so if I can encourage you
[58:33] tonight fear
[58:35] not be not
[58:37] afraid if you can give me Nehemiah
[58:44] 414 and I looked and I this was
[58:48] Nehemiah he was building the wall of
[58:52] jerus he he was rebuilding it
[58:56] and he was standing on top of the
[59:00] wall with the other
[59:04] Watchmen and the Bible says that he had
[59:07] a tool in one
[59:11] hand and he had a sword in the other
[59:15] hand and he was looking
[59:17] around and there were still holes in the
[59:20] in the
[59:22] Gat but the Bible says
[59:25] he says and I
[59:27] looked and I rose
[59:30] up and I said to the
[59:32] Nobles and to the
[59:34] rulers and to the rest of the
[59:37] people be not afraid of
[59:41] them
[59:44] remember remember the
[59:47] Lord which is
[59:50] great and
[59:53] terrible he's
[59:55] great and he's
[59:57] terrible and fight for your
[1:00:02] brethren keep
[1:00:05] working keep
[1:00:07] working keep the tools in one
[1:00:11] hand and the sword in the
[1:00:14] other it doesn't matter what comes
[1:00:16] against

[1:00:19] afraid be not
[1:00:22] dismayed be not confounded
[1:00:26] for our
[1:00:27] God he's great and he's
[1:00:31] terrible what a terrible God that we
[1:00:37] serve my if I can read you and and
[1:00:40] Deuteronomy
[1:00:45] 7:17 oh if Thou shalt say in thine
[1:00:48] heart these nations are more than
[1:00:52] us that sounds a lot like Jeremiah
[1:00:57] he says for I'm just a
[1:01:00] child no no no before you were even
[1:01:05] formed I knew you but if you say in th
[1:01:10] heart these nations are more than
[1:01:14] I how can I dispose of
[1:01:18] them the next
[1:01:23] verse
[1:01:30] and thou shalt not be afraid of
[1:01:32] them but shall well remember what the
[1:01:35] Lord thy God did unto
[1:01:40] pharaoh and unto all of
[1:01:43] Egypt next
[1:01:46] verse the great Temptations with which
[1:01:49] Thine Eyes
[1:01:52] saw and the signs
[1:01:55] and the
[1:01:56] Wonders and the mighty
[1:02:00] hand and the stretched out
[1:02:04] arm whereby the Lord thy God brought
[1:02:07] thee
[1:02:09] out so shall the Lord thy God do unto
[1:02:12] all the
[1:02:15] [Music]
[1:02:19] people of whom thou are
[1:02:23] afraid verse
[1:02:28] 21 Thou shalt not be AF frightened of
[1:02:32] them for the Lord thy God is among
[1:02:37] you a mighty
[1:02:39] God and
[1:02:43] terrible but what
[1:02:45] happens you don't
[1:02:50] remember we don't
[1:02:53] remember
[1:02:55] and another scripture in
[1:02:58] Deuteronomy me see if I can find it real
[1:03:02] fast and I'm Gonna Leave You with
[1:03:07] this oh Excuse excuse me it's going to
[1:03:10] be in Psalms
[1:03:20] 106 I'll leave you with this
[1:03:23] here
[1:03:26] verse
[1:03:27] n he rebuked the Red Sea
[1:03:31] also and it was dried up so he led them
[1:03:35] through the
[1:03:38] deps as through the
[1:03:40] Wilderness and he saved them from the
[1:03:42] hand of him that hated
[1:03:45] them and redeemed them from the hand of
[1:03:47] the
[1:03:51] enemy and the waters covered their
[1:03:53] enemies
[1:03:56] there was not one of them
[1:04:01] left
[1:04:03] then believed
[1:04:09] they they saw him at the Red
[1:04:13] Sea with the Red Sea before
[1:04:17] them and the enemy coming behind
[1:04:22] them and all of a sudden
[1:04:25] he opened up the
[1:04:27] sea and they walked upon dry
[1:04:33] land then belied they his
[1:04:37] Works they sang his
[1:04:43] praise it's
[1:04:45] easy with no
[1:04:47] test it's easy you can talk everything
[1:04:51] that you want
[1:04:53] to
[1:04:54] but when they were at the Red
[1:04:57] Sea and the enemy behind
[1:05:01] them they said what did you
[1:05:03] do did you bring us here to
[1:05:07] die and all of a sudden he said trust
[1:05:11] me believe me trust me why
[1:05:18] cry and he opened up the
[1:05:21] sea and then they believed him
[1:05:26] it's
[1:05:27] easy to sing
[1:05:29] songs when the seed's already been
[1:05:33] open but what about when he needs you to
[1:05:35] trust
[1:05:41] him to trust
[1:05:43] him and after all that he did for
[1:05:47] them and after all that he does for
[1:05:51] us verse 13 they soon forget his
[1:05:57] works and they waited not for his
[1:06:02] counsel we are not
[1:06:05] orphans he has not left
[1:06:07] us he has given us Christ the spirit of
[1:06:14] truth yes sir we are not
[1:06:17] alone but let me tell you until the
[1:06:21] test until you've been tested
[1:06:25] and you've been
[1:06:28] tried there is no promise in
[1:06:31] here for
[1:06:33] you or for me and you know the only way
[1:06:36] that I know that there's promises for
[1:06:42] me is that if I open this book
[1:06:45] up and I read it and you know how I know
[1:06:48] that of his
[1:06:50] love is that when I get on my knees
[1:06:54] and I search
[1:06:56] him and he shows
[1:07:00] up we don't deserve that many
[1:07:05] times that's all he's asking
[1:07:09] for believe me trust me stay in your
[1:07:14] homes stay there for a
[1:07:17] while just be
[1:07:20] there amen amen God bless you tonight
[1:07:26] I love each and every one of
[1:07:29] you and I hope this was just a an
[1:07:32] inspiration to
[1:07:36] you don't fail and as we heard this

[1:28:06] Christ we don't have to speak about the
[1:28:08] circumstances of the situation in the
[1:28:10] world right
[1:28:12] now because we already know through the
[1:28:16] word that we would come through
[1:28:19] dangerous days and bad times or evil
[1:28:25] times when our Prophet spoke of the
[1:28:27] plagues of
[1:28:29] God to execute the his purpose and he
[1:28:34] spoke of three things that were
[1:28:36] important there would be a economic
[1:28:41] depression a pandemic or a
[1:28:44] virus and the third
[1:28:48] one that there will
[1:28:51] be the condition of the people will fall
[1:28:54] completely as we see it
[1:28:57] today and also the threats of the atomic
[1:29:02] bombs so knowing the condition that
[1:29:04] we're
[1:29:05] in we only have left to thank the
[1:29:11] Lord that this is a wonderful time for
[1:29:13] the Believers to be at
[1:29:16] home and restore the family
[1:29:20] Altar and put everything in
[1:29:25] to make sure that we are dressed as the
[1:29:27] bride and the Seal of the Holy
[1:29:30] Spirit which is the the
[1:29:35] warranty not just to present it with our
[1:29:38] prayer but is the
[1:29:41] requirement to be able to do
[1:29:44] Rapture in the SEC secret coming of the
[1:29:47] Lord for his
[1:29:50] bride

[1:29:56] here on
[1:29:58] this the seven Church ages in the age of
[1:30:02] Philadelphia of the diagnostic of
[1:30:06] God towards the
[1:30:08] time and
[1:30:10] circumstances and the state of the world
[1:30:13] for his
[1:30:14] coming the holy prophet
[1:30:18] says Jesus will come in a time of great
[1:30:22] disorder and
[1:30:25] confusion and along with his
