[0:00] notice now we're going to read in the
[0:03] bible
[0:04] in the the seventh seal
[0:07] that's found in revelations the eighth
[0:09] chapter
[0:11] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[0:13] there was silence in heaven about the
[0:16] space of a half hour
[0:19] that's all we have
[0:22] now
[0:23] we're going to notice i remember
[0:26] after
[0:26] the fourth chapter of revelations the
[0:29] church is gone
[0:31] after the
[0:32] the uh four horse riders has went out
[0:37] the church is gone
[0:39] see
[0:41] and then
[0:42] they were
[0:43] satan and his angels was kicked out
[0:46] and then they come to the earth and the
[0:47] battle set in again because eve broke
[0:51] down the barrier from where she was uh
[0:53] isolated behind the word of god
[0:56] you believe in god's mathematics
[0:59] you don't you sure lost
[1:01] you'll sure get lost in the word if you
[1:02] start putting a four or six or
[1:05] or something besides system of
[1:06] mathematical words running an order
[1:09] you'll sure have in your
[1:11] cow picking grass on top of a tree
[1:13] somewhere you'll certainly run out
[1:15] because god does not his whole word does
[1:19] run completely in
[1:20] in mathematics
[1:22] yes perfect the most perfect there's no
[1:24] other literature written like it like it
[1:26] so perfect in that mathematics
[1:29] now
[1:30] the
[1:31] the eighth chapter
[1:33] only reveals the scene of uh the scene
[1:37] of the seventh seal where nothing else
[1:40] is revealed not nothing
[1:43] all the way back from genesis the
[1:46] seventh chapter the seven seals
[1:48] spoke of
[1:50] from the very beginning in genesis
[1:53] the seventh jesus christ and speaking
[1:56] himself told of the end time and when he
[1:58] got told all set six seals when he got
[2:01] to seven he stopped
[2:04] there it is it's a great thing
[2:06] and no where through the church age
[2:10] since in the early apostolic church
[2:13] has the protestant church ever had a
[2:17] prophet
[2:19] tell me who it was
[2:22] never
[2:23] but we are promised in the last day
[2:28] that to return to the church again
[2:30] for the benefit of straightening up all
[2:33] that has been missed
[2:35] undone left undone
[2:37] of course predicted here that the
[2:40] seventh angel's message would finish the
[2:43] mysteries of god amen
[2:46] now we've went through it all we see
[2:48] that it's perfectly in harmony with the
[2:51] scripture that's the reason now could
[2:53] you imagine when this person comes on
[2:55] the scene
[2:57] when he does
[2:58] remember it'll be so humble and thanks
[3:01] to the churches are missing a long ways
[3:05] if there be one among you
[3:07] who's spiritual or a prophet
[3:09] i the lord my god will make myself known
[3:13] to him and speak to him in visions
[3:16] through dreams and interpret dreams
[3:18] somebody have a dream the prophet will
[3:20] be able to interpret it
[3:22] and if if he has a vision he speaks it
[3:25] i'll make myself known to him through
[3:27] visions
[3:28] and dreams
[3:30] make myself doing and if what he says
[3:33] comes to pass then hear that prophet
[3:37] because i'm with him now
[3:41] we'll turn now to the eighth verse
[3:45] of the uh or the first verse i mean of
[3:47] eighth chapter
[3:49] revelation
[3:50] uh eight one
[3:52] we must remember
[3:54] that this seventh seal
[3:56] is the end of time of all things
[4:02] right
[4:03] the things written
[4:05] in the seventh seal book
[4:07] sealed up of the plan of redemption from
[4:11] before the foundational world it ever
[4:14] been ends
[4:16] it is the end
[4:18] it is the end of the struggling world is
[4:20] end of struggling nature it's the end of
[4:23] everything in there is the end of the
[4:25] trumpets it's the end of the vials it's
[4:28] the end of the earth it's it's even the
[4:30] end of time
[4:32] time runs out
[4:34] the bible said so
[4:36] it's the end of the vials
[4:38] and even in the ushering in of the
[4:41] millennium
[4:44] that's on the seventh seal
[4:46] it's just like firing a rocket into the
[4:48] air
[4:49] and that rocket explodes here and it
[4:51] goes up then it explodes again it puts
[4:54] out five stars one of those stars
[4:57] exploding blows out five stars from it
[5:00] and then one of them starts explodes
[5:02] goes out five stars submit see it fades
[5:05] on out now how is he going to do it
[5:07] that's what we don't know
[5:10] we don't know
[5:12] notice
[5:13] the breaking of this seal was so great
[5:17] that heaven
[5:19] was hushed by it in silence for the
[5:22] space of a hammock
[5:26] ah is it great
[5:28] what is it
[5:30] it was hushed
[5:32] heavens it was a thing move
[5:35] for a half hour
[5:37] when the seventh sealed mystery in the
[5:39] book of redemption broke over
[5:42] [Music]
[5:45] think of it but it's broke
[5:48] the lamb breaks
[5:52] you know what they were all about i mean
[5:56] they didn't know
[5:57] there was it just stopped
[5:59] why
[6:00] what is it
[6:02] i'm going to tell you my
[6:04] my revelation
[6:06] and now
[6:08] uh certain
[6:10] as i stand in the plant park
[6:13] tonight
[6:15] i
[6:16] had the revelation that revealed it's in
[6:20] a threefold manner
[6:22] sitting there
[6:23] when this left me
[6:25] something has come to me and said don't
[6:26] fear i didn't hear no voice like on the
[6:29] inside of me spoke
[6:31] i have to tell you the truth just
[6:32] exactly what happened something hit and
[6:34] said don't fear this is that third pull
[6:38] i was standing with a a little baby shoe
[6:41] when he told me saying make your first
[6:42] pull and when you do the fish will run
[6:45] after the lure so then watch your second
[6:47] pull said because it'll only be small
[6:49] fish
[6:50] he said then the third pawn will get it
[6:52] and there's three great things that goes
[6:54] with it
[6:56] and one unfolded
[6:58] today or yesterday the other one
[7:01] unfolded today and there's one thing
[7:04] that i cannot interpret because it's in
[7:06] an unknown language
[7:08] but stand right there and look right
[7:11] straight at it
[7:12] and this is the third poll coming up
[7:15] amen that's the reason all heaven was
[7:18] solid
[7:19] remember
[7:20] the seventh messenger was
[7:23] the seven messengers
[7:25] was
[7:26] the
[7:28] noted one to me the seventh angel it
[7:30] seemed more to me than any i see they
[7:33] were standing like this
[7:35] and i was standing here
[7:37] and i was watching those other see one
[7:40] first bunch of little purrs feathers all
[7:42] beat down you remember them
[7:44] and they all flew eastward
[7:47] and the
[7:48] second bunch were brighter
[7:51] bigger birds looked like doves pointed
[7:53] wings
[7:55] they flew eastward first pool
[7:58] second bull
[8:00] then the next was angels
[8:02] and it's i'm standing right there and
[8:04] this explosion left and i was looking
[8:07] this way towards the west and they come
[8:09] and just pick me up in there and i went
[8:11] out of my knowing
[8:14] and the one of them coming was the one
[8:16] that splits the streams to me was the
[8:19] one on my feet to left where i entered
[8:22] the constellation at but counting from
[8:24] the left to the right it would have been
[8:26] the seventh angel
[8:28] coming across now
[8:31] remember the seven messengers do you
[8:34] remember the pyramid of white rock
[8:38] now notice this
[8:40] that now
[8:41] when this taken place
[8:43] junior was standing in a field that had
[8:46] a had a big pyramid to it like that and
[8:48] there was something right on the rocks
[8:50] and i was revealing that to the people
[8:52] is that right junior
[8:54] about a year before it happened
[8:56] and notice the next thing now i took
[8:58] some kind of a bar and cut it off and on
[9:01] the inside was white rock that had
[9:03] nothing wrote on it
[9:04] and at that time i started to the west
[9:07] and i told them all i said don't go out
[9:10] west stay here
[9:12] and look on this until i returned
[9:16] went west for the blast returned back
[9:20] to the east
[9:22] with the holy spirit
[9:25] interpreted this unwritten word amen
[9:30] amen if that isn't personal thank you
[9:32] god almighty
[9:34] but i know that it was them seven
[9:37] thunders putting themselves right close
[9:39] together just banging seven different
[9:41] times and it unfolded into something
[9:44] else that i see
[9:45] then when i've seen that i look for the
[9:48] interpretation flew across there and i
[9:50] couldn't make it out
[9:51] that's exactly right
[9:53] the
[9:54] hour isn't quite yet far amen
[9:57] what happens
[9:59] is that
[10:00] those seven thunders
[10:03] he heard thunder
[10:05] and was forbidden to write
[10:08] that's what the mystery is laying behind
[10:10] those seven consecutive thunders rolling
[10:12] out
[10:13] now why let us prove it why it is the
[10:18] secret that no one knows about john was
[10:21] forbidding to write about it even even
[10:24] not a symbol about it why
[10:27] this is why
[10:28] there was no active in head active in
[10:31] heaven
[10:32] it might give away the secret
[10:36] do you see it now amen
[10:38] but here is seven straight thunders
[10:41] right in a row one two three four five
[10:43] six seven
[10:46] that perfect number
[10:48] then
[10:50] heavens couldn't write that
[10:52] heavens can't know about it nothing else
[10:55] because there's nothing to go on
[10:57] it's relaxing time it was so great till
[11:00] it's kept secret from the angels
[11:03] now
[11:04] why if satan should get a hold of it
[11:09] he might do great damage
[11:11] that's one thing he don't know
[11:15] if they made one move it might give
[11:17] something away so they just shut up
[11:20] quit harping
[11:21] everything stopped
[11:24] uh seven god's perfect number
[11:27] seven
[11:29] just right down the road
[11:30] seven
[11:32] thunders utter
[11:33] straight together
[11:36] like you're spelling out something
[11:38] notice at that time
[11:42] started right he said don't write it
[11:46] jesus
[11:47] never spoke of it
[11:50] john couldn't write it
[11:52] angels know nothing about it
[11:54] amen what is it
[11:56] it's the thing that jesus said even the
[12:00] angels of heaven didn't know nothing
[12:02] about it see
[12:05] he didn't know it himself amen he said
[12:08] only god would know it amen
[12:10] now what this great secret is that lays
[12:14] beneath this seal
[12:15] i do not know
[12:17] i don't know it
[12:19] i couldn't make it out
[12:21] i couldn't tell it
[12:23] just what it means what it's saying
[12:25] but i know that it was them seven
[12:28] thunders uttering themselves right close
[12:30] together just banging seven different
[12:32] times but it's moving into that cycle
[12:36] it's coming up close
[12:39] so the thing for you to do is to
[12:41] remember that i speak to you in the name
[12:43] of the lord amen
[12:48] hallelujah and here when the seventh
[12:50] seal when he opened it he also omitted
[12:53] it again see so we see that it is a
[12:56] complete mystery therefore the hour is
[13:00] not yet for this mystery to be known
[13:02] therefore we're this far and the rest of
[13:05] it will be known
[13:07] right around about the time that jesus
[13:09] appears on earth again for his bride or
[13:12] whatever takes place at that time now
[13:15] until that time let's just all pray
[13:18] live good straight christian lives
[13:20] looking forward for his coming now the
[13:23] vision plus the word plus the history
[13:26] plus the church ages and all blend
[13:29] together so i could
[13:31] truly say
[13:32] that to the best of my understanding and
[13:35] according to the word of god and the
[13:37] vision and the revelation
[13:39] the interpretation thereof is thus saith
[13:42] the lord now may the lord bless you all
[13:45] each one real richly as we
[13:49] stand now and sing
[13:52] this good old song of the church
[13:55] god bless you each one amen
[14:04] you
