[36:55] [Applause]
[37:05] [Music]
[37:07] [Applause]
[37:20] waiting
[37:36] [Music]
[38:17] pretty long i ever thought
[38:19] because i had not heard from my friend
[38:24] i was nervous
[38:26] but as i began to think about him
[38:29] because
[38:30] i was talking to brother chris and his
[38:33] wife and brother tommy his wife and
[38:36] my family yeah
[38:40] as i was sleeping
[38:43] the phone rang so no
[38:56] [Applause]
[39:12] and truthfully speaking
[39:15] i feel as bad as
[39:18] for two weeks like if my wife hadn't
[39:20] talked to me
[39:25] such
[39:26] was the love that was between david and
[39:28] johnson
[39:31] more than the love of a man for a woman
[39:36] and why is that love
[39:40] because of
[39:42] [Music]
[39:54] sometimes you don't know from one day to
[39:57] another who will be standing or who will
[40:00] fall
[40:01] [Music]
[40:06] and it's very tremendous thing that
[40:09] prophet said we live in the golden age
[40:22] a lot of times in in our midst
[40:27] we find we find people
[40:30] there and ministers that still preach
[40:33] the dark ages which is
[41:03] there are times in me like for example
[41:07] friday night
[41:08] [Applause]
[41:11] you know i i sympathize with people
[41:16] where they have no patience
[41:38] [Applause]
[41:43] we see people sincere people that are
[41:45] trying to serve god i'm
[41:55] [Applause]
[42:01] [Music]
[42:11] garbage is because when you say
[42:12] something
[42:13] that is
[42:23] i've made many many many many many
[42:26] mistakes
[42:27] in my walk with
[42:35] [Music]
[42:36] [Applause]
[42:49] [Applause]
[42:53] and probably many will not receive that
[42:56] statement
[43:04] [Music]
[43:09] so then
[43:11] we don't live in dark ages
[43:14] we live in the most glorious age
[43:19] of possession
[43:22] we live in a time when god has opened
