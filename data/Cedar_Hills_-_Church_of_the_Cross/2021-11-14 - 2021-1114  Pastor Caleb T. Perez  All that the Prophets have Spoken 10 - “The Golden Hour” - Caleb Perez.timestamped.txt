[30:47] here today
[31:03] we were we had gone up this steep hill
[31:04] to go on top of this ridge
[31:07] if we could find some deer
[31:10] on the way down but
[31:13] a big old rock in the middle of the road
[31:16] a
[31:23] i went around the rock to try to try to
[31:26] not not not get myself off off of uh
[31:29] not to get too much sideways but
[31:34] when i did the the side of that road
[31:37] it gave way that the the will gave way
[31:40] to it
[31:44] it was me and brother evans in the front
[31:45] and brother daniel was on this side with
[31:47] me
[31:49] was in the back on that side
[31:52] here goes the whole side by side
[31:55] you know it this whole thing and once it
[31:58] made that last turn it was going to go
[32:01] down the hill
[32:04] as the rear split off the road
[32:09] started tilting
[32:12] by the grace of god only only god knows
[32:16] it was his hand that was holding it up
[32:20] and uh
[32:22] it uh brother brother evans got off
[32:26] and then when he saw
[32:54] it was about to go and we were trying to
[32:56] hold it in all i could think is what am
[32:57] i going to tell mark
[33:01] am i going to tell you buddy
[33:03] i know what he would have said as long
[33:05] as you're okay i don't care about the
[33:06] bike
[33:20] here comes this this old man trying to
[33:21] help us and he
[33:35] well i've been praying this whole time
[33:37] but i'll pray again
[33:41] brother evan said a really beautiful
[33:43] prayer
[33:45] he said lord
[33:46] we have done all that we know how to do
[33:48] it
[33:49] now we need you
[33:54] you can hear the testimony of brother
[33:56] daniel and but i kid you not the moment
[34:00] right around the corner here comes this
[34:02] big old ram
[34:04] big old
[34:17] we sure can use your help
[34:22] we
[34:24] had a rope and we tied off the back end
[34:26] so that it wouldn't tilt and i ended up
[34:28] having to turn it and then i found a
[34:30] path to go down and
[34:32] we didn't damage
[34:47] were out they were out they wanted to
[34:48] squirrel hunt
[34:52] he asked the man
[34:54] that was with him he's the brother he
[34:55] says can you go ask the rancher for it's
[34:57] okay if we
[34:58] hunt his property
[35:14] nobody can hunt my
[35:42] turned around and says i give that man
[35:45] eternal life
[35:48] give the other man many chances
[35:54] and so when he said that i said well i
[35:56] know where you're going with this
[35:57] brother evans
[36:00] speak it and give those men that helped
[36:02] us out eternal life
[36:05] that is the greater works
[36:08] the greater works is to be able to
[36:11] impart eternal life
[36:13] and we cannot impart eternal life if we
[36:15] do not have eternal life
[36:20] that's why i'm glad to be here this
[36:21] morning
[36:24] an
[36:24] adventure but

[37:30] opportunities to preach to your people
[37:32] lord

[37:52] that's the years of the listeners
[37:55] of revelation lord
[37:58] we pray that you begin to reveal
[37:59] yourself lord today
[38:02] thank you once again lord we leave this
[38:03] service and ourselves in your hands
[38:07] precious name of the lord jesus christ
[38:09] amen amen
[38:11] we want to go as the scripture we've
[38:13] been reading luke 24 25.
[38:27] and it reads like this then he said unto
[38:29] them
[38:31] a fool's
[38:32] slow heart
[38:35] to believe all
[38:36] that the prophets have spoken
[38:43] we can go to first kings the 18th
[38:46] chapter
[38:48] let's see what one of these prophets
[38:50] spoke
[38:54] first kings 18 17 and 18 reads
[39:00] and it came to pass when ahab saw elijah
[39:04] that ahab said unto him
[39:06] arthao he that troubleth israel
[39:12] it is
[39:15] watch what the prophet elijah answers
[39:18] back
[39:20] he answered i have not troubled israel
[39:24] but thou
[39:25] and thy father's house in that ye have
[39:28] forsaken the commandments of the lord
[39:31] and thou has followed baylor
[39:42] amen may god add his blessings to the
[39:44] reading of his word you may be seated
[39:49] the last time we spoke
[39:52] i'm going to remember didn't even
[39:53] remember what the what the subtitle was
[39:57] yes we spoke on the witch's party
[40:01] quite a strange topic
[40:05] but in that in that scripture or in that
[40:07] that teaching there in essence we found
[40:10] out how that there is more witchcraft
[40:13] that goes on in the church than people
[40:14] realized
[40:17] people always looking to the outside
[40:21] from outside
[40:28] when we spoke on this and i want to just
[40:30] kind of give a little background
[40:34] it was paul that was
[40:36] the galatians
[40:50] what a question that he was asking the
[40:52] people of that day
[40:58] what a thing it was when he when he
[41:00] confronted the issue
[41:03] he said all foolish galatians who have
[41:05] bewitched you or who have put a spell on
[41:07] you okay
[41:10] and we found out how much that uh that
[41:12] goes on in a church
[41:16] bewitching
[41:33] i want you i want to make sure that you
[41:35] remember what we were talking about
[41:39] this jezebel system is like a web
[41:45] that once you're in it it is almost
[41:47] impossible to get out of it
[41:51] notice i didn't say it was impossible i
[41:54] said almost impossible
[41:57] because when the when christ comes on
[41:59] the scene
[42:11] trying to help the people get out of the
[42:14] system that
[42:24] and we want to bring you into a system
[42:26] that god has placed
[42:54] it has infiltrated almost every area
[43:17] it is the system that the beast and the
[43:19] image of the beast both
[43:21] use is
[43:35] why the subtitle is the golden hour
[43:48] those things they deal with the the the
[43:50] catholic church and and the
[43:52] denominations
[43:58] the bible says that everyone whose name
[44:01] was not written on that lamb's book of
[44:02] life
[44:20] the bible says they will be deceived
[44:24] that's why jesus told the disciples
[44:28] because the devils are subject to you
[44:32] but because your names are written
[44:41] it controls
[44:43] every aspect of people's lives today
[44:47] this is why jesus said in john 14 19
[44:55] and the world sees me no more
[45:02] because i live
[45:42] church system will see me no more
[45:51] that's why it's not limited just to the
[45:53] world system
[45:55] it's not limited just to politics
[46:12] beast uses
[46:24] yet a little while in the world or the
[46:26] church system would see me no more
[46:30] why
[46:31] because he is now outside of the church
[46:37] how can they see him when he's not even
[46:39] in there with them
[46:52] but it is made up of members
[47:08] things
[47:10] that so many people are not seeing him
[47:13] no more
[47:17] william branham
[47:19] brother bernie and then
[47:20] brother tommy and then
[47:22] many
[47:35] golden times
[47:50] more we go on
[48:03] as long as we abide by that system
[48:07] we will see him
[48:10] the moment we get out of that system
[48:16] we will see him no more
[48:46] hello everybody hello coming to church
[48:48] don't save us
[48:51] amen
[48:53] this is how blessed
[48:55] we are
[48:58] yes
[49:29] what what is the system we talk about
[49:33] it's a boat
[49:34] that's right
[49:37] the system is a boat
[49:41] well i want you to get
[49:42] that up this system oh my gosh this is
[49:44] the man this is a big old complex thing
[49:48] it's just a boat
[49:49] let's put it as a boat
[49:52] that people are in
[49:54] right
[49:55] and in this boat
[49:58] we as the ministry
[50:01] are crying out to you
[50:03] every time we minister every time we
[50:06] preach
[50:08] we're not crying out against the people
[50:10] no
[50:38] jump
[51:06] church member
[51:20] sometimes people i don't want to go to
[51:21] church no more look at this yeah
[51:26] they cannot handle the pressures of the
[51:28] day
[51:30] i mean we have this we have this great
[51:32] man
[51:34] great
[52:02] our founding pastor he he mentioned this
[52:06] to the church
[52:08] he said i'd get up in the middle of the
[52:10] night at three in the morning
[52:13] and where was my wife you don't
[52:14] understand
[52:15] was it interceding
[52:31] no
[52:33] in what she was doing as a prayer
[52:34] warrior
[52:37] who was helping to hold or stem the
[52:39] tides
[52:42] so when these great men god takes them
[52:44] off the scenes
[53:13] to god our pastor's still here
[53:16] there he is that has him in a resting
[53:18] place
[53:21] i was asked a question
[53:26] i used
[53:54] what the
[53:57] it's either it's easier just to put all
[53:59] of all of the responsibility on the
[54:01] profit
[54:04] let's just listen we don't have to do
[54:06] anything else
[54:20] we are called to take on the
[54:22] responsibility
[54:50] many times the brethren think
[54:52] that i'm against my brothers
[54:57] i'm not against my brothers
[55:01] but it's the system
[55:16] and that is
[55:17] yes every church must
[55:24] but if that doctrine
[55:25] causes me to hate my brother
[55:29] that doctrine causes me to put a
[55:31] division amongst between me
[55:54] what happened to the quote
[55:57] that if you can't bitterly disagree with
[55:59] somebody
[56:11] something is wrong we better go back to
[56:13] the altar
[56:28] keeps us from being brothers
[56:32] did you get that look i thought i'm
[56:33] going to say it again that's why in a
[56:34] church where's the canadian language you
[56:36] have a lot of systems going on
[56:39] and the system that you join in with
[56:56] you want to join into that system
[56:58] that's up to you
[57:00] in the church there are many systems
[57:03] many clicks
[57:04] and you're sooner or later you're going
[57:06] to join in with one system or the other
[57:09] person
[57:10] did you
[57:38] themselves they canceled what happened
[57:45] almost always impossible
[57:52] possibly i want you to get this because
[57:55] we always think of the system as oh this
[57:57] is the great beast and oh my it's out
[57:59] there
[58:05] the same antichrist
[58:09] side by side in the church
[58:12] spirit of christ
[58:19] watch this watch what he says here
[58:23] it's the system we join into is
[58:26] that keeps us from being brothers
[58:30] i don't go to church no more because you
[58:33] are well
[58:34] you're a part of another
[58:42] you know if somebody didn't want to come
[58:43] to church that's that's fine
[58:47] i'm sorry but i gotta hit these devils
[59:02] that they were at the church
[59:07] i'm not speaking about one person in
[59:09] particular
[59:12] why can't they still love the people
[59:56] ah no you don't know what what they did
[59:58] i don't care
[1:00:11] it does not allow me to hate anybody
[1:00:14] on the other hand
[1:00:15] can't hate
[1:00:17] i'm sorry he can't love it
[1:00:20] it's against his nature
[1:00:23] he's not able to love no puede
[1:00:26] but when we can't
[1:00:54] as
[1:01:08] abraham and his seat after him that's
[1:01:09] the message
[1:01:12] poor hypocritical
[1:01:15] so-called christian oh this
[1:01:19] is the
[1:01:22] mouse shame on you
[1:01:27] your hour
[1:01:29] is at hand
[1:01:32] god will punish you for that
[1:01:35] as soon as i be his servant standing
[1:01:38] here
[1:01:40] why would god punish them
[1:01:43] because you're separating the laity
[1:01:48] and you're making differences between
[1:02:18] but he was against those systems
[1:02:22] that was keeping him away
[1:02:25] and he says keeping them away from him
[1:02:30] and that's the thing
[1:02:32] now
[1:02:46] it's the antichrist spirit
[1:02:49] that finally gets them to a place
[1:02:54] till they won't hear the truth no more
[1:02:58] i'm gonna remember what we talked about
[1:03:00] last time
[1:03:14] you ever hear people say that i know you
[1:03:16] don't care let me ask you the question
[1:03:17] have you ever said it
[1:03:22] you like it or not
[1:03:24] that's just the way you're being carnal
[1:03:25] you like it or not
[1:03:27] why don't you be spiritual
[1:03:31] and then you'll say
[1:03:32] lord this is the way i am and i don't
[1:03:34] like it
[1:03:37] i don't care
[1:03:38] 50 60 70 80 years lord i don't like it
[1:03:40] and i wouldn't still need to change
[1:03:56] ahab wasn't such a bad man brother
[1:03:59] branham says
[1:04:02] but he made his choice by marrying a
[1:04:04] beauty queen
[1:04:08] that was a pagan
[1:04:09] an idolater
[1:04:25] jezebel wasn't
[1:04:27] actually on the throne of israel
[1:04:32] but she was the main head
[1:04:34] behind the throne
[1:04:37] and the catholic hierarchy
[1:04:40] is not on the throne in the united
[1:04:42] states
[1:04:44] but she's the system
[1:04:47] that's behind it
[1:04:50] because he is
[1:04:58] john f kennedy john f kennedy the
[1:05:00] president el presidente he said he's not
[1:05:03] such a bad guy
[1:05:05] but he's married to that system
[1:05:08] that's why
[1:05:09] when the system is in place
[1:05:12] somebody runs for president
[1:05:15] i really mean well
[1:05:17] they want to do better
[1:05:19] they want to help the people
[1:05:31] he says but the system is already in
[1:05:34] place
[1:05:48] come
[1:06:02] say
[1:06:30] jezebel system
[1:06:35] they withstood many great persecutions
[1:06:38] and martyrdom
[1:06:41] under that false system of jezebel
[1:06:45] and this jezebel system
[1:06:48] was set up for one reason
[1:06:54] anybody tell me why it was set up
[1:06:58] this jezebel system was set up for one
[1:07:00] reason and one reason alone
[1:07:05] to conquer
[1:07:07] a servant of god
[1:07:26] and that system rose up
[1:07:29] and conquered the servant of god
[1:07:32] no idea
[1:07:33] jezebel system was created for that
[1:07:35] purpose
[1:07:40] that
[1:07:40] that servant of god that prophet of god
[1:07:42] was to bring but
[1:07:45] to keep it out of the hands
[1:07:50] watch this
[1:07:51] when jezebel got the power of the state
[1:07:54] behind her
[1:08:08] that's the antichrist spirit that is
[1:08:10] behind the whole system
[1:08:14] but we are so blessed
[1:08:17] not only to see christ
[1:08:20] but to recognize the antichrist
[1:08:25] i don't know how we take that for
[1:08:26] granted
[1:08:29] i don't know how many people no
[1:08:31] in the world
[1:08:33] millions and billions
[1:08:35] do not recognize the antichrist
[1:08:39] they don't recognize that spirit no
[1:08:40] recon
[1:08:42] yet you're blessed to see that
[1:08:47] church maybe that system has come into
[1:08:49] your life
[1:09:08] i don't know if you're ready to or not
[1:09:11] come on i said it's time to kill the
[1:09:13] witch
[1:09:14] it's time to kill that system
[1:09:31] that makes you rebel against god's word
[1:09:35] heal the system
[1:09:37] trying to keep you from every promise
[1:09:40] and blessing that god has given us
[1:09:44] you say brother where did you get that
[1:09:46] helmet
[1:09:58] somebody read it out loud
[1:10:24] now that's what a true prophet a true
[1:10:27] servant of god does
[1:10:32] how many times have you heard brother
[1:10:34] branham say that
[1:10:36] i am not against the church
[1:10:39] against the people
[1:10:42] nominations
[1:10:54] what we can do is cry out against it
[1:11:08] let's go on
[1:11:51] it was your
[1:11:52] decision after that dude every one of
[1:11:55] you has a decision to make
[1:11:58] this he said you'll serve the lord or
[1:11:59] not
[1:12:01] against his word
[1:12:04] why he says rebellion is as the
[1:12:34] we want to get somewhere
[1:12:36] we don't want to stick a
[1:12:38] sucker in your mouth and say oh
[1:12:39] everything's wonderful
[1:12:43] we're getting into the golden hour here
[1:12:49] isn't that when we get into trouble
[1:12:53] when we
[1:12:54] we go after strange things
[1:13:00] you're the one that troubles
[1:13:30] they had murdered neighbors
[1:13:33] they wanted his vineyard
[1:13:36] and then the word of the lord came hello
[1:13:41] first kings 21 19 and 23. remember
[1:13:46] this is the fulfillment of what exodus
[1:13:48] was saying
[1:13:51] and thou shalt speak unto him saying
[1:13:54] thus saith the lord
[1:13:55] hast thou killed
[1:13:57] and also taken possession
[1:14:07] and thou shalt speak unto him saying
[1:14:09] thus saith the lord
[1:14:10] in the place where dogs lick the blood
[1:14:13] of nabeth shall dogs lick thy blood even
[1:14:16] thine
[1:14:19] enough
[1:14:26] and of jezebel also speak the lord
[1:14:28] saying the dog shall eat jezebel by the
[1:14:31] wall of jezreel
[1:14:40] and it happened just exactly the way
[1:14:43] that the lord had spoken it through
[1:14:44] elijah
[1:14:48] the witch was killed
[1:14:51] and this modern-day jezebel system is
[1:14:58] read it in the book of revelation you've
[1:15:00] read it many times read it again
[1:15:03] this modern day jezebel system is coming
[1:15:06] to and gonna come to an end at one one
[1:15:07] of these days
[1:15:20] that's what we found
[1:15:21] in
[1:15:22] 1st samuel 28 9.
[1:15:30] this is what he had done
[1:15:33] verse 9.
[1:15:34] and the woman said unto him
[1:15:36] this is this is that witch of endor
[1:15:39] when he was he was trying to deceive her
[1:15:41] right not letting her know who he was
[1:15:46] what saul hath done
[1:15:48] what did saul do
[1:15:51] how he had cut off those that have
[1:15:53] familiar spirits and the wizards out of
[1:15:55] the land
[1:15:59] there's like
[1:16:01] one for saul good job saul
[1:16:04] point for you saul
[1:16:06] the bible says that in leviticus 20
[1:16:08] verse 6
[1:16:10] and the soul that turneth after such as
[1:16:12] have familiar spirits
[1:16:15] and after wizards to go a whoring after
[1:16:17] them
[1:16:18] i will even set my face against that
[1:16:21] soul and will cut him off from among the
[1:16:24] people
[1:16:31] i'm sorry
[1:16:40] so saul had rid the country of those
[1:16:42] with familiar spirits and wizards amen
[1:16:56] this is where people get into trouble
[1:17:00] out of desperation and impatience
[1:17:07] and less than 24 hours later
[1:17:12] leviticus
[1:17:13] 20 was fulfilled
[1:17:23] you can play around
[1:17:25] you can have your good time you young
[1:17:26] people
[1:17:28] you go out there
[1:17:42] it's a
[1:17:52] well we know we've seen those things
[1:17:54] happen in the old testament
[1:18:38] hermano
[1:18:40] i'm in a position to take care of you
[1:18:42] and and to feed you
[1:18:45] better than anyone
[1:18:47] hello everybody
[1:18:59] to whom they all gave heed from the
[1:19:01] least to the greatest saint this man is
[1:19:03] the great power of god
[1:19:22] as the story goes on then philip
[1:19:24] witnessed him in philippi he ended up he
[1:19:26] ended up getting baptized
[1:19:29] let me know what is understanding but
[1:19:30] watch in verse 18.
[1:19:33] but when simon saw
[1:19:35] the apostles lay hands
[1:19:38] and the holy spirit the holy ghost was
[1:19:40] given
[1:20:16] the gift
[1:20:59] and he tells a brother do you want to go
[1:21:00] i forget if it was hunting or fishing i
[1:21:02] think it was fishing
[1:21:04] and he says he said the brother says
[1:21:06] yeah yeah
[1:21:07] let's stop it i got to stop and and have
[1:21:09] a a council session with a brother
[1:21:25] he's impatient he gets his hat off he
[1:21:27] said it was a nice stetson hat i don't
[1:21:29] know
[1:21:30] he threw it on the ground
[1:21:32] and he kicked the hat
[1:21:35] and then he saw her brother brown was
[1:21:36] coming he picked up the hat
[1:22:07] many times
[1:22:08] it's not some great thing that needs to
[1:22:10] be done
[1:22:13] in the corner because i'm getting into
[1:22:14] my message
[1:22:20] it's
[1:22:21] not some great some big thing that needs
[1:22:23] to be done sometimes
[1:22:26] maybe just an upgrade to our system
[1:22:29] system
[1:22:32] on your phones and it tells you uh
[1:22:34] upgrade
[1:22:35] available on the tenacious
[1:23:04] i don't know when i can get this upgrade
[1:23:07] put things in the spiritual sentence
[1:23:14] because those things become so important
[1:23:18] and we we let it go we let it go
[1:23:21] and finally you're forced to yeah
[1:23:24] will not function until you do this
[1:23:29] maybe i can forward the calls he says
[1:23:31] that happens
[1:24:15] but maybe like our phones
[1:24:17] we're just not in sync with the right
[1:24:19] tower
[1:24:23] you know when you when you're when
[1:24:24] you're
[1:24:25] out they close to the border
[1:24:28] last
[1:24:29] saturday
[1:24:32] right before the time change
[1:24:34] we're very close to the arizona border
[1:24:37] we're an hour behind right until we
[1:24:39] change in the fall then we same as them
[1:24:57] you're because you're getting
[1:24:58] some cell service from pasta across the
[1:25:01] way
[1:25:04] so then you say oh shoot i thought it
[1:25:05] was this late
[1:25:07] and then we
[1:25:08] the phones and then they're
[1:25:10] updated
[1:25:20] you go to a certain place and then you
[1:25:21] gain signal you know what we're keeping
[1:25:23] calls
[1:25:37] maybe it's time to
[1:25:39] clear them out
[1:25:42] update our services
[1:25:45] let's update our system
[1:25:48] we don't have the wrong system but maybe
[1:25:50] it just needs to be updated
[1:25:54] when you look at it
[1:25:56] and you see
[1:25:57] the difference in time
[1:25:59] maybe it's the lord telling you he says
[1:26:01] he says
[1:26:02] you better know what time it is
[1:26:06] because when you keep putting one foot
[1:26:07] in the world and one foot in church
[1:26:11] two different systems
[1:26:19] there are many that live our their lives
[1:26:24] as if the lord's coming is a long way
[1:26:26] away
[1:26:30] it's often a distance somewhere
[1:26:32] established
[1:26:34] later than
[1:26:35] iglesias
[1:26:37] we've heard that for a long time it's
[1:26:38] still later than you think
[1:26:42] and the holy spirit told me to tell you
[1:26:44] this
[1:26:47] you can take it if you want
[1:26:48] to
[1:27:01] that the time on their clocks
[1:27:04] make sure that it reads exactly the same
[1:27:06] as mine
[1:27:11] now this is what this is where i get the
[1:27:13] inspiration from this message
[1:27:29] this is
[1:27:39] i said lord sometimes it seems like
[1:27:41] maybe i'm
[1:27:42] maybe i miss a few things
[1:27:59] that i'm supposed to be doing
[1:28:02] is there something lord that i'm missing
[1:28:04] or i'm overlooking
[1:28:05] your case
[1:28:06] i don't want to find out at the end that
[1:28:08] i missed this or missed that
[1:28:12] are there things that
[1:28:26] show me tell me what i need to do
[1:28:29] i want to please you more than anything
[1:28:31] else
[1:28:33] i finished saying what i had to say
[1:28:36] i continued to drive and i went up this
[1:28:38] little hill
[1:28:54] and all of a sudden here comes a truck
[1:28:55] right behind me
[1:28:58] i kind of turned around to look to see
[1:28:59] who it is
[1:29:01] it was one of the ranchers
[1:29:07] looking up at the
[1:29:33] and so so i i need to make sure that
[1:29:35] everything's functioning right
[1:29:39] the more he talks to me the more i hear
[1:29:41] the lord answering my prayers
[1:29:45] said if the lord could speak to balaam
[1:29:47] through a donkey
[1:29:50] speak to me through
[1:30:01] yeah he said well i'd come to check
[1:30:03] because
[1:30:04] the water's flowing really well
[1:30:08] it's actually overflowing
[1:30:12] but i'm gonna have to make some
[1:30:13] adjustments here
[1:30:17] now he's got my attention
[1:30:52] he said i i knew i got to make some
[1:30:55] changes here
[1:30:58] now now here's the thing is is that i'm
[1:31:01] up here to do that but do you hear that
[1:31:03] noise
[1:31:06] what is that
[1:31:08] i hear the air coming out of my tire
[1:31:12] i'm going to have to change that tire
[1:31:15] and i said
[1:31:16] i'll help you change it
[1:31:19] this is when i knew beyond a shadow of a
[1:31:21] doubt
[1:31:23] somebody do that and it was the lord
[1:31:24] speaking
[1:31:26] he looked at me
[1:31:28] and he said no
[1:31:30] he said
[1:31:31] this is your goal
[1:31:36] would a rancher be telling me this is my
[1:31:37] golden hour
[1:31:41] he walked away
[1:31:55] what is this golden
[1:31:56] hour this is this is my golden hour
[1:32:00] and when he says that to me he's talking
[1:32:02] about the church
[1:32:06] this is our golden hour
[1:32:08] there's just some some tweaks we got to
[1:32:09] make
[1:32:23] made up of 60 minutes
[1:32:38] significance in prophecy
[1:32:40] significance in prophecy and i noticed
[1:32:43] that the word
[1:32:45] is only found in one book in the old
[1:32:48] testament
[1:32:50] can anybody tell me what that is
[1:32:52] i didn't know until i looked it up
[1:32:55] don't anyone want to give it a gift
[1:32:59] what book is the word
[1:33:01] is it in what book
[1:33:04] but what book of the old testament
[1:33:09] i said i didn't know either no
[1:33:12] it's only found in the book of death
[1:33:16] why
[1:33:18] because it tells you the beginning
[1:33:20] and the ending of the gentile
[1:33:22] dispensation
[1:33:25] think about this the jews were given an
[1:33:27] exact amount of time
[1:33:30] foreign
[1:34:01] he's breaking it down to us gentiles
[1:34:29] he's breaking it down
[1:34:45] two different things and i was saying
[1:34:46] lord just just i this is i know it's
[1:34:47] from you yo
[1:34:50] and then i hear brother branham saying
[1:34:54] can you meet the
[1:34:56] challenge
[1:34:57] of the day
[1:35:11] but let's break it down
[1:35:12] who's going to meet the challenge
[1:35:18] these men these apostles these great men
[1:35:20] of god
[1:35:22] they met
[1:35:24] the challenge of the day it
[1:35:27] but was the holy spirit tells me
[1:35:32] meet the challenge of the hour
[1:35:36] all the way down now
[1:35:39] he's breaking it down and here's brother
[1:35:40] branham in the message just once more
[1:35:42] lord pakistan
[1:35:45] knew one thing
[1:35:47] and i wonder if the church realizes it
[1:35:49] today
[1:35:52] is a backsplitting condition
[1:36:36] with these denominations
[1:37:18] you're pulling good i can feel it
[1:37:20] your intellectual strength
[1:37:24] doesn't meet the challenge of the hours
[1:37:27] i wouldn't notice it
[1:37:29] so many ministers
[1:37:31] are on the on the on the theological
[1:37:34] side of the message
[1:37:36] everything i just explain every detail
[1:37:38] no split controller
[1:37:42] lost what it is you receive the holy
[1:37:44] ghost
[1:37:55] your intellectual strength doesn't meet
[1:37:57] the challenge of the hour
[1:38:09] that nothing can dare challenge
[1:38:28] the
[1:39:23] john 11 9 says
[1:39:51] what is done with the night hours
[1:39:56] jesus then says jesus what's the hour

[1:40:01] system the system has a time

[1:41:15] i mean it's not even just to young
[1:41:17] people it's even the old people
[1:41:19] all day long
[1:41:22] the system does not let you manage your
[1:41:24] time
[1:41:26] it's very challenging to get time alone
[1:41:44] the
[1:42:12] people rarely get time in which they're
[1:42:14] focused
[1:42:17] when's the last time you set some time
[1:42:18] aside and you're really focused
[1:42:22] okay i'm ready to read my bible now
[1:42:24] here
[1:42:40] you rarely get time or you're focused
[1:42:42] and undistracted
[1:42:45] consider what is constantly tugging at
[1:42:48] you all right
[1:42:50] i want you to consider this more what's
[1:42:52] tugging at you
[1:43:35] i don't care

[1:43:58] no right away it's prompting it's
[1:44:00] tugging at you right away
[1:44:02] answer me answer me
[1:44:04] the
[1:44:19] with all these things
[1:44:21] is that they are all
[1:44:23] other people's priorities
[1:44:27] that has you
[1:44:28] spellbound
[1:44:30] oh foolishness
[1:44:59] of the lord
[1:45:09] what are you doing with the hours jesus
[1:45:10] said there's 12 hours
[1:45:13] wow what a thing he's saying
[1:45:15] brother branham uses this
[1:45:17] he's talking about ours
[1:45:20] and we've experienced all of them
[1:45:22] especially
[1:45:23] the hour of fear brother branham says
[1:45:26] power of confusion
[1:45:28] distress
[1:46:10] this morning what the hour is
[1:46:13] you're looking on your clock
[1:46:16] god's timepiece
[1:46:19] that hour is not talking about seconds
[1:46:22] or or hours or minutes in that sense
[1:46:35] when god's prophetic time comes to pass
[1:46:44] but he knew that god promised to bring
[1:46:45] them out with a strong hand
[1:46:50] and then when the hour of the time of
[1:46:53] the promised brunei
[1:46:57] pharaoh who knew not joseph
[1:47:00] jose
[1:47:03] this is god's system
[1:47:05] this is god's time peace
[1:47:34] when
[1:47:48] or the hour
[1:47:52] because he could come for you
[1:47:54] young people
[1:47:57] be prepared
[1:47:59] whatever god wants to do here
[1:48:03] oh my goodness mark 14 says
[1:48:06] my soul is exceedingly sorrowful and to
[1:48:08] death
[1:48:10] and he went a little forward and fell on
[1:48:12] the ground and prayed
[1:48:13] and said if it were possible
[1:48:17] that the hour
[1:48:19] might pass from him
[1:48:22] he goes on in john 17. i'm just going to
[1:48:24] i'm just going to go through this real
[1:48:25] quick
[1:48:27] he says father the hour is
[1:48:45] the hour is at hand
[1:48:47] matthew 26 and the son of man is
[1:48:49] betrayed into the hands of sinners
[1:48:53] it's the hour that's calling out
[1:48:57] did you get that i'm going to say it
[1:48:58] again it's the hour of the calling out
[1:49:04] there's darkness over egypt
[1:49:07] but before the calling out
[1:49:09] was applied
[1:49:12] for the church to get
[1:49:25] but i'm under the right system
[1:49:30] i want to be under your system
[1:49:32] in the church
[1:49:34] apostles
[1:49:37] teachers
[1:49:39] you gave a prophet first with a message
[1:49:44] why don't the people want what the what
[1:49:46] the message has produced
[1:49:49] there are false apostles
[1:49:52] prophets
[1:49:54] but in the midst of it
[1:50:06] i was going to ask for the pianist but
[1:50:07] then i'd have to go reach the
[1:50:22] but whatsoever
[1:50:36] you become
[1:51:29] but probably
[1:51:30] brother brother will you you know what
[1:51:32] the golden hour is right
[1:51:35] it's in photography
[1:51:38] it is
[1:51:40] the last hour
[1:51:42] before
[1:51:43] sunset
[1:51:46] and it's the first hour
[1:51:48] right after sunrise
[1:51:51] i didn't know that but that's what it is
[1:51:55] you can catch images
[1:51:58] and the details that you've never seen
[1:52:12] an hour before the sun goes down
[1:52:40] the church is so broke up
[1:53:08] and then the mysteries of god would be
[1:53:10] declared
[1:53:12] seventh angel begins to sound his
[1:53:14] message
[1:53:16] not the healing service
[1:53:19] what everybody focused on
[1:53:22] it's not the healing services
[1:53:38] is there any hope left esperanza we've
[1:53:40] got to do something and do it quickly
[1:53:43] that's for today
[1:53:45] we got to do something we got to do it
[1:53:46] quickly
[1:53:48] for the hour of the rapture
[1:53:52] your
[1:54:02] i want you to raise your hand this
[1:54:04] morning
[1:54:05] because he says here
[1:54:19] you're coming out of there
[1:54:47] there ain't no excuse to be in the wrong
[1:54:48] system anymore
[1:54:51] you that are sick
[1:54:54] faith in god
[1:54:55] have faith
[1:54:57] cause this is the hour of your healing
[1:55:00] believe now with all your heart
[1:55:17] is the 60 minutes
[1:55:20] following an injury or a trunk
[1:55:26] that if you don't get medical attention
[1:55:30] the time that will determine what will
[1:55:31] happen
[1:55:34] it's very critical
[1:55:36] well i've been hurt brother
[1:55:38] we've only got an hour
[1:55:41] not 60 minutes
[1:56:10] the golden hour is not just for
[1:56:11] traumatic situations
[1:56:15] but the first hour
[1:56:18] such as a heart attack or stroke
[1:56:23] medical attention
[1:56:25] has a profound impact on a person's
[1:56:27] survival
[1:56:30] take it to them
[1:56:33] at least 50
[1:56:35] of all fat fatalities
[1:56:40] if the victims
[1:56:55] really even though they say it's an hour
[1:56:57] okay
[1:56:58] sometimes 20 to 30 minutes
[1:57:02] once again
[1:57:04] this is your golden yes
[1:57:08] but it only lasts 30 minutes
[1:57:11] that's right
[1:57:12] we are the people
[1:57:14] of the half hour of silence
[1:57:17] ah i'm going to say that again did you
[1:57:19] get that i'm going to say it again we
[1:57:21] are the people
[1:57:36] will take place
[1:57:48] i love that i'm going to say it again
[1:57:50] the
[1:58:17] don't don't come out to help me no no
[1:58:20] this is your golden estas
[1:58:22] and i say this morning arise and shine
[1:58:25] easy
[1:58:26] for the light has come
[1:58:29] in the glory of the lord

[2:00:00] when
[2:00:02] jesus loves

[2:00:08] tempter's power
[2:00:10] is broken
[2:00:22] i'm white
[2:00:39] with glory

[2:02:19] he could not see
[2:02:25] he
[2:02:26] clutched
[2:02:28] his rats
[2:02:38] but this is the good news but then jesus
[2:02:51] when jesus comes
[2:02:53] when jesus
[2:03:03] is
[2:03:14] tears
[2:03:15] are wiped away
