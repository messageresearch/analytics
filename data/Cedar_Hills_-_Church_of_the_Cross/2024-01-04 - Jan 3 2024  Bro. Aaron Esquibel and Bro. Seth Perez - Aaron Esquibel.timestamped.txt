[20:28] [Music]
[20:34] amen God bless the song leader
[20:38] musicians thank you for creating such a
[20:41] beautiful
[20:44] atmosphere amen while we're standing let
[20:46] us open our
[20:50] Bibles to the Book of
[20:54] Matthew chapter
[20:56] 5 verse
[21:01] 48 and can you just smile at your
[21:04] neighbor
[21:07] Shake bless you brother
[21:16] Ronnie amen and as we heard on Sunday
[21:19] the word of God reads be ye therefore
[21:21] perfect even as your father which is in
[21:23] heaven is
[21:27] perfect
[21:32] amen you may be
[21:36] seated now we remember on
[21:40] Sunday that we are not perfect in our
[21:42] own
[21:46] doing we're not perfect because we don't
[21:48] make any
[21:51] mistakes but we're perfect because we
[21:53] serve a perfect
[21:57] God and we've accepted a perfect
[21:59] sacrifice
[22:01] amen and as I heard the word coming
[22:04] forth on
[22:07] Sunday I felt like our pastor just
[22:10] making arrows for
[22:16] us so I didn't have to look very far for
[22:22] inspiration I'm just going to continue
[22:24] on with what I felt the Holy Spirit led
[22:26] me to
[22:31] and now we heard that we must see Christ
[22:33] in every scripture
[22:36] amen amen and it's easy to pick the
[22:39] Bible
[22:41] up and maybe I'll just pick a random
[22:44] verse and it says and it came to pass
[22:46] when they
[22:50] came and looked on
[22:53] elab and they looked upon
[22:56] elab if I don't get that portion of
[23:02] scripture well as we instructed well we
[23:04] go back and we read it
[23:10] again and we read it till we can see
[23:12] Christ in the
[23:16] scripture but then we took it a step
[23:20] further and we found
[23:22] out if I can't see Christ in every
[23:25] aspect of this Bible
[23:31] in every aspect of my
[23:33] life then I've got to go back into my
[23:38] heart and I got to find out who's in
[23:41] control
[23:43] there and that's when things start
[23:45] getting
[23:47] rough because our lives are the greatest
[23:50] message that will ever be
[23:55] preached and nobody else has to tell me
[23:58] where I'm
[24:02] lacking I believe each one of us know
[24:05] within our heart where we
[24:10] lack or we fail the
[24:13] Lord and I have a little uh title that
[24:16] the lord gave
[24:19] me and it's the small
[24:25] details and under there I put I've got
[24:27] to be my
[24:31] meticulous now if you don't mind I'm
[24:33] going to just read a quote for you of
[24:34] our founding
[24:38] pastor and it reads like
[24:42] this this is what the Holy Spirit told
[24:44] me
[24:48] yesterday the reason people are not
[24:50] getting
[24:54] it is because they don't have details
[25:00] they don't take care of the small
[25:02] details in their
[25:07] life and I
[25:09] said I don't understand you right
[25:13] Lord he said
[25:17] simply they have despised the day of
[25:20] small
[25:24] things small things he says again
[25:30] they are up here trying to get big
[25:36] things when they don't take care of the
[25:39] details down
[25:43] here as you are with your
[25:46] car as you are with your
[25:49] house as you are with your own personal
[25:52] appearance
[25:55] am that's the way you are with God
[26:00] you've got to be
[26:03] meticulous now that word
[26:06] meticulous it means showing great
[26:09] attention to
[26:14] detail very careful and
[26:22] precise and I believe that's the time
[26:24] we're living
[26:26] in I don't know about you but I want to
[26:28] be
[26:31] meticulous from the way I
[26:34] speak the way I think the way I act the
[26:39] way I present myself to
[26:41] people the way I am in the wherever I
[26:47] am I want to be conscious of these
[26:51] details now I just happen to look up
[26:55] what details meant of course I had an
[26:56] idea
[27:01] but I thought this was pretty good
[27:05] details it's a small Detachment of
[27:13] troops given a special
[27:19] Duty it's an
[27:23] ingredient and if we go back to
[27:26] Sunday our Pastor said we pray for
[27:31] help but when the help
[27:33] comes we're blinded because it's not in
[27:36] our
[27:39] taste he said you don't want
[27:43] him in other words you don't want the
[27:47] details you don't want this
[27:51] ingredient you don't want this
[27:54] element amen amen and so if we could
[27:57] open our
[28:00] Bibles we're going to read about a man
[28:02] in the
[28:05] Bible who was given some specific uh uh
[28:13] details if we could I'm not going to
[28:15] read it I'm going to just kind of tell
[28:16] you all story but it's going to be 1
[28:18] Samuel chapter
[28:24] 15 and so we find out
[28:29] that there was a man in the Bible named
[28:33] Saul and one day God anointed prophet
[28:38] Samuel he came to
[28:43] Saul and he said the Lord sent me to
[28:48] you I'm GNA you're going to be anointed
[28:51] king over
[28:54] Israel and he goes on to say and verse
[28:59] three he says now I got a special uh
[29:03] Duty for you to
[29:06] do a special
[29:09] Duty kind of like those details we read
[29:11] about
[29:13] earlier he says I want you to go to the
[29:16] land of the
[29:20] amalekites and I want you to destroy
[29:23] them their
[29:25] children their men their
[29:28] women their
[29:31] o their
[29:33] sheep all their
[29:36] livestock everything that has to do with
[29:39] them I want you to annihilate
[29:44] it so Saul gathered the people
[29:49] together he got a couple thousand men
[29:54] together and the scripture said that
[29:56] Saul came to the city of
[30:04] am and he laid waiting in the
[30:14] valley and so when he was waiting there
[30:16] in the
[30:18] valley he got his own smart
[30:24] idea he thought you know
[30:26] what
[30:28] I think I'm going to those are some
[30:30] pretty goodlooking
[30:34] goats those Ox look pretty
[30:39] fat I think I'm GNA keep those
[30:44] oh and so what he
[30:46] did instead of destroying everything as
[30:48] the Lord commanded
[30:51] him he began to hide certain
[30:56] things the things that the Lord told him
[30:58] to get rid
[31:02] of he put them to the
[31:05] side I can use these for a rainy
[31:09] day and I began to think of
[31:14] that you know we can come and get advice
[31:17] from the ministry or even the
[31:22] pastor and he tells us exactly what to
[31:24] do in our
[31:26] lives
[31:30] and what do we say
[31:32] sometimes H I'm going to do it
[31:37] anyway I got to just try it for
[31:40] myself has anybody ever thought
[31:43] that you hear somebody tell you hey you
[31:45] shouldn't go down that
[31:49] road but we say I'm just going to I got
[31:51] to just try
[31:54] it and what that is is it's stubbornness
[32:07] it's
[32:08] stubbornness and that's the way we
[32:11] are we get stuck in our own
[32:16] way and God can't do anything for
[32:19] us because he gives us the
[32:22] remedy and we refuse to take
[32:26] it
[32:27] you know it's you see people as brother
[32:29] Bram says dying on the footsteps of the
[32:31] doctor's
[32:37] office the doctor has the prescription
[32:40] for
[32:42] you he tells you what to take how to
[32:44] take
[32:46] it but because we're
[32:49] stubborn and we're stuck in our routines
[32:53] and and
[32:56] habits
[32:58] we don't take the
[33:01] prescription and it comes to
[33:03] this we can't blame God for
[33:09] anything everything we have need
[33:12] of it's laying right at our
[33:15] fingertips you can receive anything you
[33:17] have
[33:20] needed so I believe it's time to look
[33:22] into the
[33:25] mirror stop looking at other
[33:30] people there's no excuse for our
[33:35] actions prophet of God said God God has
[33:38] the
[33:41] joy he's got the power
[33:45] unlimited he's got
[33:47] healing
[33:49] salvation Glory glor
[33:52] goodness
[33:54] Mercy but if the subject refuses to
[33:57] receive the
[33:59] remedy then it's his
[34:04] fault so whatever I go through in
[34:08] life me
[34:10] personally I never look to blame
[34:14] anybody if somebody gets gets me
[34:18] upset they really didn't get me
[34:22] upset I let myself get upset at
[34:25] them
[34:28] if same thing with being hurt you
[34:32] know I let that person get to me in that
[34:37] way that's when I got to go back into my
[34:42] heart and find out if I'm reflecting
[34:45] Christ in every aspect of my
[34:49] life so back to
[34:52] Saul you know he started to put all
[34:55] these things to the side
[34:59] and when he returned
[35:01] back uh the prophet Samuel was not very
[35:04] happy with
[35:07] him he walks up and he says well how did
[35:10] it
[35:12] go she went great I did everything you
[35:14] told me to
[35:17] do and while Samuel's talking to
[35:21] him he says uh he hears sheep bleeding
[35:25] in the
[35:25] background
[35:29] he can hear all the cow
[35:31] and he says well what's that what's that
[35:35] sound and and then so Saul wants to
[35:38] blame the
[35:43] people and he says uh oh it was the
[35:46] people that wanted to keep all these
[35:49] [Music]
[35:52] animals not only that but he didn't even
[35:55] kill the king when who he was instructed
[35:57] to
[36:01] Smite and that King was standing
[36:05] there and Samuel had to kill
[36:09] him and the Lord didn't visit
[36:14] Saul until his dying day the Bible says
[36:19] until his death
[36:21] bed and as I was just thinking on
[36:25] that I said Lord
[36:28] let me not be as
[36:32] Saul just getting rid of the things that
[36:34] I want to get rid
[36:39] of picking and
[36:42] choosing but let me just get rid of
[36:44] everything that's not
[36:48] you from the biggest thing to the
[36:52] smallest he said to kill it
[36:55] all
[36:58] and
[36:59] so in closing I just want to share a
[37:02] little story with
[37:05] you and I'm sure we've all heard it but
[37:07] I'm sure there's a lot of new people
[37:09] here
[37:13] too and it's just uh you know sometimes
[37:16] we we've heard the story many
[37:20] times that or the phrase the pardon is
[37:23] only a pardon if it's accepted as a
[37:25] pardon oh
[37:33] but I've always asked
[37:35] myself how do I know I've been
[37:39] pardoned and how do I know I received it
[37:42] as a
[37:46] pardon well if you pay attention you'll
[37:48] be able to answer that question at the
[37:49] end of the
[37:54] story and it says during the time of the
[37:57] Revolutionary in the United
[38:03] States it was said that a soldier was
[38:05] tried and court marshaled for a certain
[38:13] crime this Soldier was to be shot at a
[38:15] certain date in
[38:22] Sunrise the day
[38:25] before some of them went to this notable
[38:28] president and begged for their friend's
[38:36] life and the president being in a
[38:41] hurry picked up a small piece of
[38:46] paper remember it's the day of small
[38:48] things
[38:50] right and he wrote on
[38:53] it I pardon this man
[38:57] signed his
[38:59] name Abraham Lincoln Abraham Lincoln and
[39:03] the carrier brought the piece of paper
[39:04] to the
[39:08] cell and he told the
[39:10] man you're
[39:12] free as the man looked at this little
[39:15] piece of
[39:19] paper it doesn't seem
[39:22] official I just don't believe it I'll
[39:25] never leave here oh
[39:28] he rejected it because it was on a small
[39:30] piece of
[39:34] paper it wasn't on a great letter
[39:39] head stamped by the
[39:42] president so the next morning the man
[39:47] died he was sentenced by a firing
[39:51] squad then the paper was written with
[39:53] the president's
[39:55] name
[39:59] the man is
[40:01] pardoned and they shot him after the
[40:04] president had pardoned
[40:08] him so it was tried in federal
[40:11] court and here was here was the
[40:15] decision that a pardon is not a
[40:19] pardon except it's received as a
[40:23] pardon so John
[40:25] 3:16
[40:27] is a pardon to every Mortal
[40:31] man and woman if it's received as a
[40:37] pardon but if it's not you're still
[40:41] condemned so back to our
[40:45] question how do I know that I've been
[40:48] pardoned how do I know I've received the
[40:52] pardon well you've got to ask yourself
[40:54] the question
[40:57] are you relieved from that guilt that's
[40:59] inside of
[41:02] you if you're still carrying the
[41:06] guilt then you haven't been received
[41:08] that
[41:10] pardon see After we receive our
[41:15] pardon we receive Purity with that
[41:20] pardon the Bible says the worshipper
[41:22] once
[41:25] purged
[41:29] has no more conscience of
[41:32] sin so if you're really
[41:36] pardon the very
[41:39] guilt the very
[41:41] desire it's left
[41:44] you it's all
[41:47] gone Purity goes with genuine
[41:52] pardoning pardon generates
[41:55] purity
[41:58] and as I think on those
[42:01] things that's what I have been
[42:04] meditating
[42:06] on ever since I you know a couple weeks
[42:09] ago our brother Tommy
[42:13] Jr heach preached a beautiful
[42:17] message and it was just simply the
[42:18] scripture you know whatsoever things are
[42:20] pure
[42:25] holy meditate on these things so I mean
[42:28] as soon as a negative thought comes to
[42:30] my mind
[42:33] now instead of sitting there thinking
[42:35] man where did this thought come
[42:39] from before you know it you're already
[42:41] living back in the
[42:46] past but if you just do a quick
[42:52] abstract it doesn't take very
[42:55] long it's just that
[42:58] quick you shut that thought
[43:01] out that's not a pure and holy
[43:05] thought and the enemy starts to lose his
[43:08] his his grasp on your
[43:14] mind but the only thing that's gonna
[43:17] really set you
[43:21] free is to have that life that was
[43:23] released on
[43:25] Calvary
[43:28] living in our hearts
[43:30] amen amen as brother Seth comes
[43:34] up God bless each one of
[43:36] you amen
[43:51] amen bless
[43:54] you may the Lord bless you this this
[43:58] evening and let us stand for the reading
[44:01] of the
[44:05] word and open our books to the our Bible
[44:08] to acts chap 7 verse
[44:17] 55 and the word of God says
[44:21] this but
[44:24] he being full of the Holy Ghost looked
[44:29] up
[44:30] steadfastly into heaven and saw the
[44:33] glory of God and Jesus standing on the
[44:36] right hand of
[44:48] God and said
[44:50] behold I see the heavens opened and the
[44:53] son of man standing on the right hand of
[44:55] God
[45:04] then they cried out with a loud voice
[45:07] and stopped their ears and ran upon him
[45:10] with one Accord
[45:21] and may the Lord Jesus add blessings to
[45:24] the reading of the word
[45:29] and let let us
[45:32] pray dear gracious Heavenly
[45:37] Father what a privilege it is to be here
[45:39] in your house
[45:43] Lord something Lord that I never want to
[45:46] get
[45:49] old and Lord I ask that you just Lord
[45:51] just just bless your people tonight
[45:54] Lord
[45:56] Lord whatever need they may have here
[45:58] tonight
[46:01] Lord Lord you are very much alive
[46:05] Lord as you were way back then
[46:09] Lord and we love you with all our heart
[46:13] Lord in Jesus
[46:16] name amen amen may be
[46:21] seated well we started uh the
[46:24] inspiration for
[46:31] Steven was given to us by our
[46:37] pastor earlier in the
[46:40] year last
[46:42] year and once you read these
[46:50] stories of these
[46:53] Martyrs it it makes you take a good look
[46:57] at your
[47:01] life because we are very privileged in
[47:05] this in this
[47:07] country and even though we've some have
[47:10] felt
[47:14] oppression everybody in this country has
[47:16] some sort of
[47:21] Rights and I've never been
[47:24] arrested
[47:26] for saying how much I love the
[47:30] Lord we have that freedom
[47:33] here and you can look at a different way
[47:36] and say well I don't think you
[47:40] do based on the spirituality of this
[47:46] nation but I'm talking the physical
[47:50] part and someone like
[47:54] Sten what a courageous man of God that
[47:58] he
[47:59] is it blows my mind how courageous he
[48:05] was to be able to face the religious
[48:07] leaders of that
[48:14] day and tell them that they were doing
[48:19] wrong they were absolutely doing wrong
[48:21] in the sight of
[48:24] God
[48:27] and they
[48:29] themselves these
[48:31] leaders you saw the
[48:35] play and they had their own
[48:38] agenda their own political uh
[48:43] purpose to control this
[48:46] church Ste wasn't going to have anything
[48:48] to do with
[48:52] that and the Bible said
[48:56] it says that he's being he him being
[48:59] filled of the Holy
[49:02] Ghost I don't know if there's anybody
[49:04] that's full of the Holy Ghost
[49:08] tonight if you need some encouragement
[49:12] tonight I want to tell you
[49:15] something the Lord Jesus
[49:17] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[49:22] forever does it thrill your soul
[49:27] to know that he's the
[49:30] same when everything in our
[49:34] lives are so out of
[49:37] control when people are trying to
[49:39] persuade
[49:42] you or influence
[49:44] you to see their point of
[49:49] view Jesus Christ is still the
[49:53] same Chang and he sent his holy ghost
[49:59] here he's in this
[50:02] house it was noised at one point in
[50:07] Jerusalem even in the city of
[50:12] Capernaum that Jesus Christ is in the
[50:16] house does it still through your
[50:19] soul know that Jesus Christ is in the
[50:22] house of
[50:24] God thrill
[50:26] you when the world comes against you
[50:30] when the world comes against
[50:32] you maybe a brother with the wrong
[50:36] Spirit maybe some sickness is coming
[50:39] against
[50:40] you even
[50:42] cancer but you could stand up and
[50:46] say Jesus Christ he's in my house what
[50:51] should I fear
[50:53] today and stepen
[50:56] being filled with the Holy
[50:59] Ghost looked
[51:01] up dead
[51:05] fastly now they were about to Stone him
[51:09] at this
[51:11] point but it didn't
[51:13] matter how courageous that this
[51:17] man how courageous that this
[51:23] man even after he told him
[51:27] he stiff
[51:29] NE why he scolded
[51:33] them for the wrong things that they were
[51:37] doing and as they got
[51:40] together they had enough they were
[51:45] angry they said we will not have that no
[51:48] more with you Stephen we won't have that
[51:50] no more
[51:52] with they're not going to put that put
[51:54] up with that
[51:56] this is our
[51:57] Temple but they forgot who was standing
[52:00] in front of
[52:03] them you see
[52:06] Jesus
[52:08] was
[52:09] Jesus died for our
[52:12] sins and in himself what a great
[52:15] sacrifice he
[52:18] was the great sacrifice that he laid
[52:23] down and many in time of our
[52:27] life have
[52:29] someone maybe a Jesus in our
[52:33] life where when someone needs help from
[52:40] you you can say look to
[52:43] Jesus and that's
[52:45] fine it's
[52:47] amazing to point people to the
[52:51] Lord but there's got to be a point
[52:56] when you point
[52:59] people or people should be able to
[53:03] say that the Lord is in
[53:06] you they should be able to identify that
[53:09] the Lord is in your
[53:13] house has anybody ever said
[53:18] that wow that man's full of the Holy
[53:22] Ghost has anybody ever said that about
[53:31] and maybe you need to do some
[53:35] homework I want to be courageous like
[53:40] Stephen see he focused on
[53:44] something let me rephrase that he
[53:48] focused on
[53:51] someone in
[53:53] heaven it was the whole reason for his
[53:56] purpose in
[53:59] life and the one that gave him
[54:03] life it was the Lord
[54:05] Jesus and even though when they were
[54:10] angry and they wanted to beat him to
[54:13] death they were they grabbed all their
[54:18] Stones he still focused on the
[54:24] Lord he was focused with the
[54:29] detail they were going to do whatever
[54:31] they were going to do to
[54:33] him he didn't say oh guys let's uh
[54:38] rethink this
[54:41] right I was just kidding you
[54:45] know you know uh you guys can still have
[54:47] your
[54:49] church you can believe one
[54:52] way I'll go over here and I'll believe
[54:55] this way right this is the
[54:58] truth but you can believe your madeup
[55:05] truth and that wasn't good enough Sten
[55:09] that wasn't good enough for
[55:10] him because he was full of
[55:13] faith it was the belief in God that he
[55:18] had because the word
[55:22] martyr it means it's a witness
[55:26] you all been
[55:29] Witnesses haven't you seen the glory of
[55:33] God doesn't it like move you or
[55:38] something doesn't it fill your
[55:41] soul so when the world
[55:44] says your Prophet made a lot of
[55:49] mistakes why you know that's not
[55:53] true there something inside of
[55:56] you you can say no that's not
[56:01] right watch not on my
[56:05] watch he God don't make no
[56:09] mistakes you know this you are the
[56:12] people of
[56:15] promise and he looked
[56:17] up up to
[56:19] heaven why it reminds
[56:22] me reminds me of a story
[56:27] with
[56:28] Peter and John and they
[56:32] go past the gate called
[56:37] beautiful and there is a lame
[56:41] man at the
[56:42] gate and he's asking for
[56:45] Ms he wants somebody to help him
[56:49] out only he's
[56:53] expecting maybe a little money
[56:56] little bit of
[56:57] Charity little bit of
[57:01] food but he hit the right
[57:05] guys he hit the right the right guys
[57:08] came
[57:10] along the men of God came
[57:12] along the apostles
[57:16] came and they passed by
[57:19] him do you have any arms for
[57:22] me now this man being
[57:26] lame he was on the
[57:29] ground he was on the
[57:32] ground and all he could do is ask for
[57:35] some help
[57:41] up he was already at the
[57:45] bottom he didn't have anywhere else to
[57:48] go and he thought he might spend the
[57:51] rest of his
[57:53] life
[57:56] charity a little something to get him to
[57:58] the next
[58:01] day but he said do you have any silver
[58:04] or gold for
[58:07] me you know what they
[58:10] said Silver and Gold Have we
[58:13] none he he touched the right
[58:17] guys filled with the Holy
[58:20] Ghost who didn't were very
[58:23] rich
[58:25] but they had something far more precious
[58:30] than but they told
[58:33] him look on
[58:35] us we're
[58:37] here the same Lord
[58:41] Jesus you seen him go
[58:44] away he's not totally
[58:47] God you don't see his physical body here
[58:52] today but I tell you today
[58:56] it's my
[58:58] responsibility to tell the
[59:01] people I want to be just like
[59:04] Peter and if you need something
[59:07] tonight don't be afraid to look
[59:11] up don't be afraid to look on
[59:14] me and don't see me say the Lord Jesus
[59:19] in me because the Lord Jesus is here for
[59:22] you
[59:23] tonight touch your
[59:26] body start of seeing you on the
[59:31] ground just look
[59:34] up don't look at
[59:36] me look at the Lord Jesus in
[59:39] me and that's what we need to do this
[59:43] year we all have been
[59:46] Witnesses I've been able to see
[59:48] different
[59:50] things to see how the Lord is using our
[59:53] pastor and our ministry
[59:57] around the
[59:58] world what an amazing
[1:00:01] job I'm so happy to be a part of
[1:00:05] it but there's got to be a point in your
[1:00:09] life when you will
[1:00:12] say Lord send
[1:00:15] me when you will
[1:00:18] say not just throw all the blame hey go
[1:00:21] go this guy will help
[1:00:23] you even though
[1:00:25] will my P my father go hey go if you
[1:00:28] need some help go yeah go talk to my
[1:00:30] dad but there's got to be a
[1:00:33] point when we
[1:00:36] reach
[1:00:38] say the same Lord Jesus is that in the
[1:00:42] ministry is the same Lord Jesus in my
[1:00:45] heart why the Lord can use
[1:00:48] you in different
[1:00:51] ways but there's got to be a point of
[1:00:56] responsibility when we just don't let
[1:00:59] brother Caleb he can do
[1:01:03] everything and what you
[1:01:05] can but it's a body and you got to
[1:01:11] move you got to move
[1:01:14] somebody because the Bible
[1:01:16] says when he Peter went to talk to that
[1:01:19] lame
[1:01:23] man
[1:01:26] arise take up your
[1:01:28] bed go
[1:01:31] walking who will go walking
[1:01:34] today who can arise from that lowly
[1:01:39] stature their lowly
[1:01:42] situation focus on the
[1:01:45] Lord and obey his
[1:01:48] voice who can do
[1:01:50] that who is
[1:01:53] willing to even be a
[1:01:57] sacrifice lot of
[1:02:00] times even in
[1:02:03] youth I
[1:02:05] feel that
[1:02:08] sometimes the kids want to see what are
[1:02:10] we gonna get out of
[1:02:14] you what is brother Seth gonna do
[1:02:17] today oh what's brother Aaron going to
[1:02:19] do oh that's the same we've been doing
[1:02:22] that for the past 10 years
[1:02:26] but many times we complain about these
[1:02:29] things and we have these negative
[1:02:34] expectations so as soon as I mess
[1:02:38] up we say oh wow that was a waste of
[1:02:43] time it's a waste of
[1:02:46] time because you haven't looked
[1:02:49] up you're too busy looking
[1:02:53] down what people are going to do so what
[1:02:56] are you going to
[1:02:57] do the Bible says let no man despise thy
[1:03:06] youth that despises like looking down on
[1:03:11] you what can the youth
[1:03:14] do and they're always
[1:03:17] selfish on their
[1:03:20] phones I don't see them do much around
[1:03:22] the
[1:03:23] house
[1:03:26] what will they
[1:03:27] do but I tell the
[1:03:30] youth it is our
[1:03:33] time
[1:03:38] rise you're not hearing me to arise from
[1:03:42] the situation you're
[1:03:45] in maybe a spiritual
[1:03:50] death maybe you're paralyzed spiritually
[1:03:53] in your legs
[1:03:57] and you can't
[1:03:58] walk and you can't it's hard to make a
[1:04:02] sacrifice and it's hard to go to
[1:04:05] youth it's hard to go to
[1:04:08] church all they're having another
[1:04:11] service but I tell you
[1:04:14] today there is still hope for
[1:04:17] you this is a new
[1:04:19] year and the Lord
[1:04:22] Jesus is telling you to R from your
[1:04:28] condition
[1:04:29] get it's time for you to
[1:04:33] stand it's time for you to stand
[1:04:36] up for the
[1:04:38] Lord for
[1:04:40] Jesus you are
[1:04:43] actors in The Great
[1:04:45] drama and he's
[1:04:48] looking to see if you're going to fill
[1:04:50] your
[1:04:53] position don't be down this
[1:04:57] year maybe you need some
[1:05:01] encourag the Lord Our
[1:05:04] God he is the one
[1:05:06] God he is The Great I
[1:05:09] Am there a nobody like my
[1:05:12] God the same Lord
[1:05:15] Jesus I would
[1:05:17] heal the
[1:05:19] lame the blind those that are sick that
[1:05:24] have a broken
[1:05:26] heart the that needs some
[1:05:29] help is here
[1:05:32] today do you believe that he's the same
[1:05:36] in every
[1:05:38] detail there ain't
[1:05:41] nobody like the Lord
[1:05:43] Jesus and nobody like the Bride of Jesus
[1:05:48] Christ praise the
[1:05:51] Lord if you need some encouragement
[1:05:55] let me tell you what David
[1:05:58] says because David was a man of
[1:06:04] encouragement and most of the
[1:06:07] time you find him crying out to the
[1:06:12] Lord but he knew
[1:06:15] something he would say in Psalms
[1:06:19] 2 verse
[1:06:23] three
[1:06:24] but thou oh
[1:06:27] Lord oh maybe I have it
[1:06:30] wrong just go with me right
[1:06:33] here that's the wrong
[1:06:40] one but David would
[1:06:44] say oh
[1:06:46] Lord thou art a shield for
[1:06:49] me my glory and the lifter up my head
[1:06:56] I don't know if you know that
[1:06:58] tonight you feel some you feel down
[1:07:04] tonight maybe gained a little weight
[1:07:06] over the
[1:07:09] holidays and there's a lot of sickness
[1:07:11] going
[1:07:12] around but I want to tell you he's going
[1:07:15] to lift your
[1:07:17] head but you got to look
[1:07:20] up say you need to
[1:07:22] focus come on
[1:07:25] Focus but you got to get from your lowly
[1:07:30] station maybe you're a little
[1:07:32] tonight you're a little
[1:07:35] tonight but you got to do everything in
[1:07:38] your
[1:07:40] power instead of looking at your
[1:07:44] phone lift your
[1:07:47] head
[1:07:48] body instead of just looking at your
[1:07:52] phone lift it
[1:07:54] up I watch The Miraculous
[1:07:59] happen David
[1:08:01] says I will lift up mine
[1:08:05] eyes unto the
[1:08:08] hills from which cometh my
[1:08:12] help my
[1:08:14] Help Cometh From The
[1:08:17] Lord heaven he made the Heaven and the
[1:08:22] Earth and he's coming here
[1:08:25] tonight and he wants to lift your
[1:08:28] head he wants to see your
[1:08:30] eyes he wants to gaze into your
[1:08:34] soul and he wants to tell you
[1:08:39] he have you ever told somebody you love
[1:08:44] them you got to
[1:08:48] focus love you Pop love you because it's
[1:08:51] very
[1:08:52] important
[1:08:54] maybe you young people understand or
[1:08:58] not there's nothing wrong telling your
[1:09:02] parent love
[1:09:04] them
[1:09:06] because our
[1:09:08] father always wants to see your
[1:09:11] eyes he wants you to look up to
[1:09:16] him because there's great healing for
[1:09:20] you he's a shield for you
[1:09:25] I will lift up mine eyes unto the
[1:09:29] hills from whence cometh my
[1:09:33] help my
[1:09:35] Help Cometh From The Lord which made
[1:09:38] Heaven and
[1:09:40] Earth and as the musicians
[1:09:43] come it's very
[1:09:48] important because
[1:09:51] sometimes I need straightening up
[1:09:55] and I got good parents to straighten me
[1:09:59] up they're very good at
[1:10:01] it and I need
[1:10:04] it sometimes you get beaten up by the
[1:10:11] ministry and it
[1:10:15] hurts but it's all for a
[1:10:18] purpose and we heard that on
[1:10:21] Sunday how God could use these different
[1:10:26] men who sometimes is like wow the Lord
[1:10:28] used
[1:10:32] him but I want to tell
[1:10:36] you God gives you a little bit of
[1:10:39] whiping once in a
[1:10:42] while maybe he turns you around a few
[1:10:47] times and it's all
[1:10:51] about he lays you on your back
[1:10:57] for a
[1:10:58] purpose maybe when I can't pay
[1:11:02] attention I need some tough
[1:11:06] love but he lays you on your
[1:11:10] back this is our Prophet here
[1:11:14] speaking he lays you on your
[1:11:17] back so you can look
[1:11:19] [Music]
[1:11:20] up but Lord it hurts
[1:11:24] why am I going through these
[1:11:27] things why is these sicknesses
[1:11:30] afflicting my
[1:11:33] body don't you think that they always
[1:11:35] said that about the people that Jesus
[1:11:37] would
[1:11:42] heal which one of his family
[1:11:46] sinned what did he do he must have done
[1:11:50] something bad that he deserve
[1:11:52] that
[1:11:54] and the Lord Jesus would tell
[1:11:57] them all this
[1:11:59] is is to show the glory of
[1:12:05] God why Steven just didn't die in
[1:12:10] vain who was watching
[1:12:13] St who was watching
[1:12:16] him he came for one
[1:12:21] maybe SA
[1:12:24] everybody knows who Paul is
[1:12:28] now but
[1:12:30] St decided to make a stand for the
[1:12:34] Lord he decided to sacrifice his
