[28:56] apparently you're privileged to be in
[28:58] god's house this evening
[29:02] amen how many enjoyed the message this
[29:04] morning
[29:07] amen let's give unto the lord jesus
[29:16] let's go straight to the scripture so we
[29:17] can have you be seated so you're not
[29:19] standing too long
[29:24] and it's found in second timothy chapter
[29:27] 1 verse 12.
[29:34] for the which cause i also suffer these
[29:36] things
[29:38] nevertheless i am not ashamed for i know
[29:41] whom i have believed
[29:43] and am persuaded that he is able to keep
[29:46] that which i have committed unto him
[29:48] against that day
[30:07] i want to read that again
[30:11] and i want brother jimmy to interpret it
[30:13] for me as it reads in spanish
[30:20] in espanol so read it in spanish and
[30:22] then and then english translate it for
[30:23] me
[30:26] for this cause that i i suffer
[30:30] but
[30:32] no
[30:33] i am not ashamed
[30:44] and i am sure that he is powerful enough
[30:47] to keep my deposit
[30:50] until that day
[30:53] wow amen
[30:54] now you have to have a certain assurity
[31:01] to know what has been deposited
[31:30] how many can say amen to see them in
[31:33] now i gotta tell you all
[31:36] if uh for some reason
[31:40] because it's feeling i'm feeling a
[31:42] little dizzy up here
[31:58] all right
[32:13] i said you're supposed to if uh i was to
[32:15] die in church
[32:18] i would be just perfectly content
[32:23] so don't worry about it
[32:35] [Applause]
[32:41] now what do you know establish well you
[32:44] ask people today
[32:46] or you tell people
[32:49] especially young people especially
[32:53] you need to do this
[33:21] uh like let me ask you a question
[33:24] how many brought your bibles
[33:28] and so i'm only going to do this because
[33:29] i heard this this morning
[33:34] how many were able to catch the sermon
[33:36] of uh that brother caleb preached this
[33:38] morning
[33:43] right well as soon as we left church
[33:45] this morning i got onto their website
[34:12] what's wrong you don't catch your bible
[34:14] oh no no people yeah like well then
[34:16] borrow one from somebody to raise it
[34:42] that's almost like uh when you ask
[34:44] there's three kinds of believers in
[34:46] every church right
[35:03] no
[35:04] can somebody here point out the
[35:05] unbeliever to me
[35:09] because that's what we tend to do right
[35:13] i know that brother oh yo
[35:53] and the doctor tells you here's your
[35:55] prescription
[36:11] amen
[36:12] i'm not gonna uh doctor gives you a
[36:14] prescription
[36:16] and you go back to for your checkup
[36:51] and as human beings what's the first
[36:53] thing that we do
[36:57] right
[36:59] i want to know
[37:02] i want to know
[37:03] something now there was a man in the
[37:05] bible of your number
[37:32] that sounds pretty simple right tell
[37:34] your voice and see you it would be
[37:36] pretty simple if we said take turn off
[37:38] our phones and don't bring them pictures
[37:45] let me tell you how i think i can only
[37:46] tell you how i think it is
[38:29] oh
[38:41] and then i thought well i have a lot of
[38:42] notes on there oh
[38:56] then i have to do something else
[39:27] reputation
[39:30] and what we find out
[39:33] that he was a leper
[39:36] right
[39:38] so
[39:39] one day
[39:42] there was a
[39:43] little young handmaid avia
[39:46] and she had been taken captive during
[39:48] the war
[39:51] and she was serving in the in the house
[39:53] of neyman
[40:08] um
[40:19] there are certain levels of of preaching
[40:37] so there was this man and he was like i
[40:39] said so this girl she was in the house
[40:41] of neyman
[40:44] and she knew yeah
[40:46] that the days of miracles hadn't passed
[40:48] in israel abraham
[41:47] bought alright
[41:49] but not the way that we think but
[41:52] right we think that it costs money
[41:56] but we find out
[41:58] salvation
[42:00] is free
[42:28] kind of like some people i know
[42:33] right i've traveled around with some of
[42:35] the ministers
[42:38] some guys they come with the
[42:40] duffel bag how did i what the backpack
[42:44] from
[42:50] right i think it was when we went to
[42:51] colombia
[42:53] colombia he didn't say nothing but he
[42:55] kind of like looked at me
[43:38] they got four big old uh stupid cases on
[43:41] wheels
[43:42] [Music]
[43:45] all right that was neyman
[43:47] right so here he goes now
[43:50] and so when the king of israel
[44:21] uh you know he probably was like a lot
[44:23] of us
[44:26] right
[44:27] when he got over to the house
[44:30] he expected for the prophet to come out
[44:34] because he was
[44:48] right
[45:46] he didn't even have the courtesy to come
[45:47] outside
[45:51] right
[45:52] he says go dip myself in the jordan
[45:57] well i can get myself over in syria
[46:02] i came all the way over here to hear
[46:04] that
[46:08] there's a lot of cleaner rivers over
[46:09] there
[46:12] right
[46:13] amen but then naaman's servant
[46:18] he said
[46:19] my lord
[46:22] right
[46:24] he said he go
[46:26] do all that he has told me to do
[46:32] right
[46:33] let's have if he would have asked you to
[46:34] do something
[46:37] unimaginable
[46:56] right correct
[46:58] that's what happens with many of us
[46:59] today
[47:03] we despise the day of small things
[47:36] we get all upset
[48:18] and i am persuaded especially
[48:21] and i am persuaded
[48:23] that nothing
[48:25] that there's nothing in this life
[48:28] but for him
[48:30] to come
[48:32] in and deposit
[49:41] why does worldliness come into
[50:02] like we start to worry about like
[50:04] it goes like this with neyman
[50:07] we start worrying about
[50:09] a nap
[50:38] our
[51:20] living inside
[51:48] you must
[52:02] now brother branham says
[52:05] he says now how does worldliness creep
[52:07] into the church
[52:10] oh it comes in by netflix
[52:14] right
[52:16] it comes in by uh
[52:18] intraport hulu
[52:21] or it comes in by
[52:23] twitter or twitter
[52:26] hey
[52:29] how does it come in almost
[52:41] see this way i like to write notes
[52:58] gotta be
[53:08] [Laughter]
[53:11] i have it on my phone though
[53:24] oh yeah i have it right here
[53:33] then you go to read in the bible and you
[53:35] find out
[53:39] none of these things that jesus said was
[53:41] going on in the church
[53:46] signs shall follow them that believe yes
[53:51] but it doesn't follow
[53:54] and don't follow what jesus said
[53:56] they shall follow them that believe
[54:00] not maybe
[54:04] perhaps they will
[54:06] they will for a certain amount of time
[55:15] why certainly it will rouse the
[55:17] indignation of a true servant
[55:58] you know preaching is the easiest thing
[56:00] you can do
[56:24] oh just get the nerves out after a while
[56:41] right because when we preach
[56:55] the minute you say something
[56:59] somebody's going to start watching
[57:06] as soon as the minister says one thing
[57:10] i'm going to
[57:23] i'm gonna find out something about him
[57:27] that i can get him
[57:31] no we don't do that
[57:36] how many how many amen
[57:38] right
[58:06] a
[58:18] right
[59:29] this is the word of god to me
[59:32] this was the prophet's word
[59:36] no wonder we're getting world but
[59:40] right
[59:43] no wonder the world's creeped into the
[59:45] church
[59:48] so what he's telling me here
[59:52] is this your fault
[59:58] my fault right it's me
[1:00:00] but right away
[1:00:02] we want to blast somebody
[1:00:06] again because they're worldly okay
[1:00:10] oh that sister oh i started my she did
[1:00:12] this
[1:01:03] [Music]
[1:01:08] we don't want to accept that
[1:01:10] responsibility
[1:01:13] but we want to preach
[1:01:16] we want to hear amen
[1:01:18] we want to hear glory to god
[1:01:21] i want to hear jump and shallow
[1:01:51] now how many wants to displease god
[1:01:57] no no
[1:01:59] right correct so we don't want to
[1:02:01] displease him
[1:02:04] so what do we do
[1:02:18] and lead you like a daddy
[1:02:21] papa would lead his children
[1:02:25] you are my children
[1:02:27] i have begotten you to christ
[1:02:30] through the gospel
[1:02:46] that day as paul said
[1:02:49] a chaste version
[1:02:52] virgin not a version
[1:02:57] sin don't have
[1:02:59] course
[1:03:18] [Music]
[1:03:25] i'm going to skip that he starts to talk
[1:03:27] about a young man who killed
[1:03:30] more limit of squirrels
[1:03:39] oh
[1:03:41] he says here
[1:03:43] so get christ in your heart
[1:03:47] that's real
[1:03:49] christ and the holy spirit the same
[1:03:51] thing
[1:03:55] holy spirit christ means holy spirit
[1:03:59] the anointed one
[1:04:01] and the holy spirit is the anointing
[1:04:06] you are the one that's anointed
[1:04:10] and
[1:04:22] then he can use you to do anything he
[1:04:24] wants you to
[1:04:35] but to
[1:04:36] have one of those gifts outside the body
[1:05:47] you're a new
[1:05:48] creature
[1:05:50] any little thing that's wrong
[1:05:53] he'll tell you that's wrong
[1:05:58] don't do it
[1:06:00] father i didn't mean to do that
[1:06:15] that many false christs shall arise
[1:06:51] he wants to make us think that we're
[1:06:53] strange
[1:06:56] we heard our testimony of our brother
[1:07:11] all of us
[1:07:21] so
[1:07:22] you know
[1:07:24] in closing we're going to get ready to
[1:07:25] close
[1:07:54] this is the most critical time to know
[1:07:56] that
[1:07:59] right
[1:08:00] how many believe that
[1:08:02] we're living at the end
[1:08:05] this is this is the end time
[1:08:08] now if you think things are bad now
[1:08:13] i'm not going to go into that
[1:08:15] but brother branham says
[1:08:18] that there's more hideous things to come
[1:08:22] right i think
[1:08:36] absolutely sure absolutely
[1:08:38] what has been deposited
[1:08:42] and what god will keep
[1:08:44] that for that day
[1:08:46] as we know many times
[1:08:49] the question is
[1:09:04] he wants to just unify us
[1:09:06] who need now i remember
[1:09:09] i remember
[1:09:10] one day
[1:09:12] we were in silver city
[1:09:15] and brother tommy calls me
[1:09:30] i said absolutely sure did you look them
[1:09:32] at the casino
[1:09:34] we we i get to his house
[1:09:36] and it's me and brother anthony
[1:09:38] anthony and we're in the car we'll be
[1:09:40] talking we're driving
[1:09:44] and we come to las cruces to a funeral
[1:10:00] we're going home
[1:10:03] and brother tommy's in the back
[1:10:08] and he says
[1:10:12] ask me whatever you want
[1:10:41] you know sometimes they would irritate
[1:10:42] him
[1:10:44] when people would bombard him with like
[1:10:46] questions
[1:10:49] and he's like oh brother omar was with
[1:10:51] us when we were going to colorado
[1:10:54] right oh and omar was driving
[1:11:36] then brother anthony asked questions
[1:12:07] and this has been hitting me
[1:12:10] every day
[1:12:14] and so i started thinking i thought you
[1:12:15] know what all these ears
[1:12:19] i've never looked to see what stick
[1:12:20] together means
[1:12:25] it means to unite
