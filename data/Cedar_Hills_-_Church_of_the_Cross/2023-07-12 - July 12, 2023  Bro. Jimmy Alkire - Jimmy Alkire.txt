song God bless you we don't have any written instructions but if you have a need Make a known by the lifting of your hands like Believers like his children we have to fulfill scripture where two or three are gathered there I would be in the middle you just open your heart either way ask him he already did it foreign good evening Lord we just want to tell you thank you thank you Lord because you extend Mercy you tell us through your word every day is a new Mercy we are here Lord in spirit and in truth you know our needs the pain in our bodies as time goes on and this flesh and we understand

to serve him oh he loves to be exalted God is so good are you happy to be in the house of the Lord amen amen got it amen don't be speaking about something that's simple okay simply but something that's way deep Advocates down in your soulma and we have a hard time recognizing is knowing when that Supernatural part of you is to speak foreign I just feel like we could walk through heaven right now are you walking through heaven right now remember the seven thunders in heaven is but those seven thunders in heaven will connect us down to the last seconds and the only place you're gonna hear that is in Heavenly places praise the Lord our subject today is the groaning creature is [Music] let's start in our scripture with verse uh starting at chapter 19. of Psalms and verse 7 through 12. what time it is I've already been up here three minutes amen Allah the Lord is perfect converting the soul the testimony of the Lord is sure making wives the simple the lady who was perfect the statues of the Lord are right rejoice in the heart amen the Commandments the heart Rejoice I don't want to talk about that makes the heart Rejoice maybe not your flesh but your heart Commandments of the Lord are pure enlightening the eyes the fear of the Lord is clean enduring forever the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous all together more to be desired are they than gold yay than much fine gold sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb established moreover by them your servant your servant warned and then keeping of them there is great rewards who can understand his errors who can understand in other words the mistakes you make I say you I'm talking about I'm talking about everybody right how many understand the mistakes you make us and why you make those mistakes and even though many times after you already know that it's wrong to do it and I'm not talking about adultery or or witchcraft or rock and roll music I'm just talking about just their everyday walk with God it's just these little things that make us get in the flesh is just not conscience of his presence no wonder we make mistakes how many make mistakes man a lot of young people don't make mistakes well maybe I better sit down yes hello amen watch this then this last part of the verse really gets me is cleanse thou me from Secret quotes by Secrets Lord there's things that I'm doing and I don't even realize that I'm doing them and they're they're wrong but they're hidden to me why I do them Lord Jesus we just thank you for your word Lord you bless your Holy Name Lord just to feel that presence yes your children have come and worshiped you and created that atmosphere where you can move and Speak Lord and move Lord Jesus we just thank you Lord God bless your children may there be brutal Hearts ready to receive it Lord we ask all these things in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ you may be seated you know the Holy Spirit has been speaking really tremendous to us lately right ultimate and a few Services back when the our pastor under the anointing of the Holy Spirit he said wholeness is entering in the church well when he says colonist centers in church I'm not turning and looking at you I'm not looking at nobody else I'm looking at myself in the mirror of God's word and I believe all of us should do that and so I asked the Lord Lord show me something that will help your children to realize what is allowing this coldness to hit them when it hits you and you you seem like you're funny and then all of a sudden you just and you just get these weird thoughts and desires and things like when you go what in the world what's wrong with me you know make it as simple as simple as we can now let's go to our next scripture Psalms 37 and we know this in many of us why don't we just read it together Psalms 37 4. now break it up Delight thyself also in the Lord and he shall give Thee the desires of thine heart yes petition is now notice how it says in Spanish it calls it petitions nothing oh if I Delight myself in the Lord and I praise the Lord and is the desires I have God's Gonna fulfill them well I can say yes to a certain degree but the whole key of this is if you delight yourself in the Lord he will give you the desires so how many want God to put those desires how many when you repented and got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Jesus all of a sudden you started you know I don't think I should do this anymore you had a sense of morality you had a sense that does this please God or not you didn't have that before but you've been justified by the Precious Blood of the Lord Jesus but at the same time the desires of the flesh the pride of life the pride of the eyes the desires they're still new but this new desire has been born in you so now you have multiple kind of desires you know how Satan calls you off remember I got three points he short circuits the real desire foreign when the spirit of the world begins to attack you it finds no place in you anymore because that desire inside it's gonna shake it off the gym we know all this oh yeah we do amen praise the Lord Jesus now let's go to our next scripture in Isaiah 26. verses seven through nine ve amen how many love God's word the way of the just is uprightness thou almost upright just weigh the path of the justice the just shall live by faith you're living by faith El PESA he says he knows how much he can depend on us and he desires to depend on us and in totality and this is and the purpose that he created US foreign because in that way that you're walking there's so many things that come they want to deviate you from the past so he's constantly waiting he's constantly balancing you out how many are thankful for that I've only been at this a few years because sometimes the years really don't mean that much you could be here 40 50 years and still just barely you'd be getting to the New Birth hey you get the new birth that's the main thing right but the Lord's not coming for a baby girl coming for a mature if you're born you're saying but unless you come to Ocho yea in the way of thy judgments the Lord have we waited for thee meaning the desire of our soul is to thy name is oh my goodness oh the soul has one desire and that desire is done to thy name yes so has that desire unto his name and to the remembrance of him why remembering him because we are the foreign how are we not going to enjoy when we hear his name spoken under the anointing of the Holy ghosts that soul is shouting to you but when the enemy short circuits that desire never comes from here to here okay and you start getting cold you stay safe and then you feel bad I remember when I was a little baptist boy we had a custom we had a customer or tradition are rededicating your life the only thing is I did it every month because I didn't have no new birth I didn't really understand myself I didn't understand what God was trying to do with my soul I had never heard his name is that I was with him on the banner of Eternity when he asked me when he asked you what age would you like to live in yeah what age would you like to live in he goes this is the most glorious times the history of mankind and Historia amen amen now we're going to jump to Genesis 2 7. the surprise popcorn began okay Genesis 2 7 for me up there please there it is and I'm gonna stop every time there's something important even if it's one letter that's one cup because all those things means something significant but here's the way we read it the Lord God formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground and God within two's nostrils the Breath of Life push button instant Cream of Wheat la cremita or Novena yeah it all happened just instantaneous no no the prophet taught us to read the Bible and the Lord God brother Danny the Lord God someone says that's incredible stuff and the Lord God formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground foreign tempo so here's this man he's pointing out of the Dust of the ground first question is is he alive yet is he walking around yet anybody and even if you say something it seems like the wrong answer it's not yeah you just are learning how to read the Bible the way the message so time goes by and breathe into his nostrils the Breath of Life time went by there's a conjunction which means he's going to connect one thing with the other and when he connects this one thing with the others and he's not supposed the Breath of Life more time ask them okay okay and the first part of the verse where God formed him from the dust to the ground foreign okay I won't torture you too much I'm not trying to do that give us the quote out of the blasphemian's names now they take the scripture and God breathed breath into his nostrils and he became a living Souls no I want to ask you something if he was a man what kind of breath was he breathing before God breathes his breath of life see Ben what kind of breath he was breathing foreign man but then when God brother Brown says if you read this message like the Jehovah's Witnesses the breath you breathe every day just to live as a human man not that no esto he said it was the breath of eternal life came into him and what inside of his soul now he has one desire man let's go back to the quick let's go back to the quiz who was the first one to speak to him once his soul was quick anybody come on that's a that's the easiest one I've asked so far oh God yours oh yeah God would come walking in the garden and here's Adam he comes up out of the earth President says his toes or his roots he's like a tree he was a tree of Life yeah he puts his feet out of the ground he is walking around and then the voice of God comes walking in the garden in the call of the evening he had never heard anybody speaks I don't personally think he even knew he was The Man Child I won't go there right he was dementia so he hears God speak the holy spirit is in his soul he has one desire the only thing that he hears when God speaks to him every day on the call of the evening and that's the way it's got to be with you when you are born quickens your soul then your soul comes alive it's got to be God speaking to you first I feel for everything else got it okay who was the second one to talk to him Amos who's the second one Segundo you buddy again you remember if you say something it's not exactly you're not wrong you're wrong right because you desire to do what's right this is where even theologians in the message now in the creation he was the last one created on the sixth day because he was the crown and the crowning of the creation he was going to have dominion over the Earth who what species was created right before Adam was created in this in the first in the Six States especially foreign of the field beast of the field which includes that animal that we now call the surf remember he wasn't the serpent yet because Lucifer had not got into him yet this is lotenia he had a nature of the spirit of Soul spiritual Alma God said okay this guy thinks he's so sure I had things in the back of my mind this animal I made it specially just for him and I'm gonna alert him to get into this animal and turn him into a serpenters I can do like what brother Tommy said it comes to negotiate with this Beast you know if you just let me take control of you you see how Adam does all these tremendous things how he can speak in the Rocks moving you can do the same thing so yeah and he enthroned himself in that animal he said and Moses under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit looking back through before that's the serpents that's Lucifer Revelation says he's been working over 6 000 some odd years he's a professional at what he does amen amen and he approaches Adam is no she's in him it's that Beast it's a baby that's the missing link now the evolution starts going down from the highest order all the way back to the lowest order don't have time to go into but it's engine and read the whole chapter of Genesis amen so who was the second one to talk to him once he was going to try to make him fall um but before that Adam would go in and talk with God and I personally don't think that that animal could go with him when he went into that place is a big old giant of a pillow about 10 feet tall [Music] he wanted to know what God said sometimes I don't like share a few things with him this atom is tremendous hey so they had they were bodies as brother Tommy would say but there was no wrong desire they say open correct there was nothing out of cater no Aviana now God says okay okay I gotta bring out part of the plan because I know the angel of Light Lucifer Lucifer that I cast out of Heaven yes and I cast him out when the Earth was nothing but volcanoes [Music] and I know he's watching everything that's happening do you think that this devil just lets you go by free when you surrender your life to the Lord Jesus he knows who you are he knows he's losing you so he's going to look for a way how to get to you by short circuiting your desire to the sale and getting you to be distracted amen are you with me so who's going to be the second person to talk to you after you're born again the devil is Diablo yeah nothing different than what happened with Adam amen amen so now let's go to our next scripture amen to Proverbs Chapter 13 and now let's start focusing in on this desire correct desires the one that you've got to be awakened to the one that you have to be able to identify the moment it gives you a little nudge us it's just a little pool and right away ah wait wait the repentance I I can't receive that no puedo receiver that's contrary to my new birth control that's contrary to what God is doing in my life just a little nudge from the inside and the nature of your soul that's been changed what do you see how he can make you react to his trash somebody's getting a hold of it oh oh no I gotta turn it up a notch now I I gotta do something because this this person's gonna give me a hard time this person is gonna win souls to the king this person is going to influence their friends to get to know the Lord this person is going to become so sweet and full of the Holy ghosts I just can't stand a person like that is so please make us so sweet is that nobody can ruffle our feathers anymore you know how you get a cat I mean you know this one is just foreign [Music] I love him as a good enemy well you know hate is love perverted right hey I love you guys so I hate the devil with his own the audience because he will promise you everything oh I'll give you this I'll give you that way she's gonna have new cars you can have new house girlfriend in the whole wide world should be the prettiest one more stronger than what it was in the beginning he'll promise you everything but when it comes time to deliver foreign living off the Flesh of his own people oh yeah he'll turn on you when the desire cometh it is the Tree of Life something you're hoping for and this doesn't come it just doesn't happen the way you thought it was gonna happen it makes your heart sick when this desire comes and it continues to come up but I love him so much he goes what if he would send me to hell yeah I was loving from hell yeah how could I be a demon not bad oh how long has it been maybe did I can't run okay oh my goodness I better hurry up let's go to our next coach and identified with Christ isn't difficult amen watch this but I challenge you tonight identify yourself with Jesus Christ and his death and his resurrection resurrection and see where you'll be at at the restaurant how many would like to know where you're going to be at that Elizabeth we shall reign with him God has given us the promise my whole desire is to be like him no these are the desires that distracted me they no longer weigh on me they no longer control me my desire is not hiding between Christ in the world I have no desire for the things of the world my whole desires it's no longer hybrid my whole desires and the coldness goes right out of the church this will be so warm spirit will move the Holy Spirit Will manifest all the gifts oh my goodness what a living God is to be like him take me Lord me make me ask me take me and everything though is God it's yours yeah I know the next guy is going to show up three seconds praise the Living God Romans 8 real quick for I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US why because the world don't understand us amen they're never going to understand us don't even expect them to this you'll be constantly disappointed sooner or later you can't even compare what you're going through right now with the glory that's being revealed in us next verse 19. for the earnest expectation of the creatures in Spanish it says creation and English it says yes and no see you know because the Christian refers to Something in its early development it's been formed estacion this creatures being formed oh yeah it's a creation but it's not complete it's a creature the earnest expectation it says in Spanish the burning desire of the creature the Greek word says with great anticipation Grand anticipation because that desire has come forth It's produced in the Tree of Life creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God is it's already been so long yes well that is not what that means there no it's located in the Greek it means it's fully expecting it to happen looking forward to happen is it's gonna happen because that burning desires once that comes to life to you you'll never did the same again even if you want to go back even if you want to go back it's not gonna let you know they're gonna give you such a strong desire coldness won't even get close to you it's afraid it's going to turn into five next verse no foreign agamos make make memory in our image my time's up I can't I can't continue there okay because God was gonna have to send you into your body that would fight against you your whole life you're gonna have to fight against planet in your whole life he'd just do that and leave you without help he says subject to penalty not willingness not a hope I hope this happened but the Hope was perfect sacrifices and they would raise to the life again that creature that began to form in this creation is Gonna Come into full view now foreign because the the creature itself point to yourself the creature itself shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption in the Glorious Liberty of the children oh my goodness oh for we know that the whole creation uses the word creation that means everything that God is the planets the whole creation pain together until now
