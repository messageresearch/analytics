[22:55] her accusers had stones in their
[22:59] hands
[23:01] they turned to jesus
[23:04] just to see what he'd say
[23:07] and the lord
[23:08] just rode in the sand
[23:13] they all walked away
[23:16] when they heard him saying
[23:19] that the sinful
[23:20] cast the first stone
[23:24] and with tears on her face
[23:27] her past was erased and she stood
[23:32] in a moment of grace
[23:38] now
[23:39] the thief on the cross
[23:42] who his life was lost
[23:45] he must pay
[23:46] for the crimes of his past
[23:51] he had done nothing right
[23:54] he would sure lose this fight
[23:57] as time was running out fast
[24:03] he took his last shot
[24:05] said to jesus why not
[24:08] remember me
[24:10] when you reach heaven's gate
[24:14] and jesus forgave
[24:17] all his sins were he raised

[32:03] 19 20 and 21.
[32:07] amen and our subject tonight
[32:09] will be the crowning
[32:11] of the asian
[32:25] and the lord help us get to where he
[32:27] wants us to get tonight
[32:31] and we're very thankful
[32:33] amen amen
[32:35] my little children verse 19 of whom i
[32:38] travail in birth
[32:40] again until christ be formed
[32:45] in you
[32:54] amen the next verse
[32:56] i desire to be present with you now
[32:59] and to change my voice
[33:02] for i stand in doubt of you
[33:05] is
[33:12] tell me that you desire to be under the
[33:14] law
[33:16] do you not
[33:18] hear the law
[33:22] no based
[33:36] for this grand
[33:40] and to
[33:42] do our best is to be in our position and
[33:44] to help your children
[33:48] we thank you lord
[33:52] in the precious name of the lord jesus
[33:53] christ we pray
[33:56] amen and amen you may be seated
[34:04] i would like to read the quote
[34:08] notice how paul is saying here
[34:11] pablo
[34:13] i'm in travail or i'm suffering for you
[34:16] again
[34:34] but look what happens here
[34:37] they had come out of the law avian
[34:39] salido
[34:40] they had received the revelation of
[34:42] jesus christ
[34:45] and they had been born again
[34:48] but now they were desiring to go back
[34:51] and be under the law
[34:55] notice they were going back to want to
[34:59] have the desire to be under the law
[35:04] they were going forward
[35:08] they were going back and they had a
[35:10] desire
[35:27] one of them is you can't drive down the
[35:30] road looking in the rearview mirror
[35:36] somebody tell me what happens if you
[35:37] drive down the road looking in the river
[35:44] but what's going to happen when you
[35:46] don't
[35:47] you're going to cry
[35:50] amen
[35:52] then another statement our messenger
[35:54] says
[35:56] he goes
[35:57] you cannot live in the light
[36:00] of a age that's gone but
[36:05] and this is exactly what was happening
[36:07] here
[36:09] after paul by the grace of god
[36:13] was able to get these people to come to
[36:16] the lord jesus
[36:18] jesus and be born again
[36:21] their birth was paralyzed
[36:44] people say well that was this one that
[36:45] was just for them
[36:49] how many of us come in and we receive
[36:51] the lord jesus
[37:05] gentrification was the third
[37:19] notice not the
[37:34] you see
[37:35] ben
[37:36] they were looking back to the past it
[37:38] just it's not miranda alpacado trying to
[37:41] do things the way that you were used to
[37:44] that
[37:46] but the birth that they had was not
[37:48] based on what they could do as humans
[37:55] was based on jesus christ revealing
[37:57] himself to them
[38:05] and that's why paul said oh my goodness
[38:09] i've already been through this one time
[38:13] but now i'm in travail
[38:17] to give birth for you to give birth
[38:19] again
[38:21] because you're never going to get to
[38:23] your position in the body
[38:28] if you're living in the light of the
[38:30] past age
[38:46] and what is this
[38:50] are you with me so far
[38:53] praise the lord jesus
[38:55] jesus
[38:56] and this is speaking about adoption it's
[39:04] the last message i preached we hit on
[39:06] why jesus had to be baptized
[39:13] why would he have to be baptized if he
[39:14] wasn't a sinner
[39:22] the sacrifice had to be washed
[39:34] say it louder
[39:37] that's that's part of it yeah
[39:42] the scripture and the scripture he had
[39:43] to fulfill was
[39:45] completed
[39:47] numbers chapter 29 we're not going to go
[39:49] there
[39:52] but aaron and his sons
[39:55] to enter into the office of the priests
[39:58] to go into the holy of holies
[40:03] the priest had to bear the high priest
[40:05] had to be
[40:06] washed with water before
[40:33] this is my beloved son this is
[40:49] why would he have to be adopted
[40:53] if he was the son of god
[40:56] honey would like to know the name
[41:00] now the adoption when we think of
[41:01] adoption
[41:04] we're thinking of say a couple maybe
[41:06] that has had problems having a little
[41:09] child
[41:12] or a family that would like another
[41:14] child
[41:16] and they go through the legal process
[41:33] because the adoption here doesn't
[41:35] necessarily refer
[41:37] to bringing another member into your
[41:39] family
[41:44] him coming to maturity
[41:56] verses one through five brother let's go
[41:58] ahead and go there del verso uh
[42:02] amen
[42:05] and let me get there i'm keep forgetting
[42:07] i don't have the screen but that's okay
[42:11] amen here we are
[42:13] chapter 17.
[42:16] we'll start with verse one
[42:22] and after six days jesus takes peter
[42:24] james and john his brother and brings
[42:26] them up into a high mountain apart
[42:36] and was transfigured before them and his
[42:38] face did shine as his son and his
[42:40] raiment was as white as the light
[42:48] and behold there appeared to them moses
[42:52] and elijah
[42:54] not just appearing
[43:04] moses was saying i see now that you're
[43:06] the fulfillment of the lord
[43:36] part of that was fulfilled in the life
[43:38] of jesus
[43:40] we know the other parts fulfilled in the
[43:42] end time
[43:45] and moses is pointing to jesus
[43:49] as the fulfillment of the lord
[44:02] why you're the very one that raptured me
[44:05] from the earth to
[44:33] and elijah now pointing
[44:54] and then answered peter and said unto
[44:56] jesus lord is it good for us to be here
[45:01] bueno espana
[45:07] he says if you will let us make sure
[45:08] three tabernacles one for you
[45:11] one from moses and one for elijah
[45:14] is
[45:19] and here brother branham says in many
[45:21] messages
[45:24] god shut him up
[45:27] because it's the tendency of man to want
[45:30] to make a tabernacle for this one
[45:34] another tabernacle for this one
[45:36] and another tabernacle for this one
[45:39] but while they said that
[45:42] dennis says while they yet spoke verse 5
[45:49] behold the bright cloud overshadowed
[45:51] them and behold the voice out of the
[45:53] cloud which said this is my beloved son
[45:58] in whom i am well-pleased
[46:11] notice it's the exact same phrase that
[46:13] he said in matthew 3.
[46:18] this is my beloved son this is me
[46:21] i am i'm really having a good time
[46:23] living in him and can tango complacency
[46:39] it gives them a ceremony of angels
[46:42] and now he doesn't just say this is my
[46:44] beloved son
[46:47] please
[46:49] but now i'm getting off the scene
[46:54] i don't want you to think that it's me
[46:56] anymore
[46:59] in the office of the father
[47:01] bringing the law
[47:03] i want you to listen to him
[47:06] you're not gonna have to listen to me
[47:08] anymore
[47:21] he had grown up into the adoption
[48:17] you begin to receive the baptism of the
[48:19] holy ghost
[48:22] because the baptism of the holy ghost
[48:25] it's not just one little gusher no solo
[48:28] is
[48:30] that's verbatim brother brown
[49:26] it's the same holy spirit
[49:43] to try to do it ourselves
[49:49] and we think by
[49:51] just being good people
[49:54] no i'm not saying you should be a bad
[49:55] people no no
[50:10] to try to
[50:11] justify yourself
[50:14] make ourselves feel better
[50:17] by doing little things
[50:22] then we begin to do the same thing
[50:43] [Applause]
[50:50] oh my goodness these people are
[50:52] paralyzed

[51:15] in your heart
[51:18] i would like to be something that denzel

[52:04] you
[52:06] by a new nature
[52:09] any desire
[52:12] when the sale is that it's god's proof
[52:14] is
[52:28] is
[52:45] in iglesia
[52:48] and you might think oh gosh man they
[52:51] don't like me here
[52:55] i made one mistake and now nobody wants
[52:56] nothing to do with me
[53:12] he says that desire is the sale that it
[53:17] is
[53:19] how many have you just something that
[53:21] gets it when you talk about the lord
[53:25] and you wake up in the morning
[53:38] that's god's proof to you this
[53:54] not just your birth
[53:57] but the spiritual bro birth of that
[53:59] little baby that's born inside of your
[54:01] heart
[54:05] what the scripture says the creature
[54:20] but then here comes
[55:03] but then when he saw they were
[55:45] if i would have depended on that when i
[55:47] first came in the message
[55:51] i would have been dead and gone a long
[55:52] time
[55:56] tommy says it's okay
[55:58] back then he don't say that no more he
[56:00] says
[56:05] he goes man
[56:07] i know the body is strange to the world

[56:59] at least 20 years
[57:02] you say but brother jimmy you're over 60
[57:04] i should have died a long time ago
[57:10] you're making you look through the river
[57:12] mirror
[57:13] now drive down the highways
[57:17] when it's about time for that cell to
[57:19] die
[57:21] he quickens that memory
[57:24] card
[57:37] that's the
[57:38] truth well
[57:44] if i don't get to getting into my notes
[57:46] we'll never get in you have i got
[57:48] well actually i have about
[57:51] 30 minutes left me in
[58:04] you know what happened then when that
[58:06] boy come to a certain age
[58:12] that boy was adopted into the family
[58:17] now what did that do
[58:20] they took him out in a public place
[58:24] but a special robe they put a special
[58:27] robe on him
[58:30] oh my
[58:32] i don't want to get on that because
[58:33] it'll be 10 minutes on that no quiet
[58:48] and the father had a ceremony of
[58:50] adoption
[58:55] was adopted
[58:58] his name on the checkbook was as good as
[59:01] his daddy
[59:16] and when you
[1:00:12] that's where god's trying to get his
[1:00:14] church
[1:00:18] just to say to this mountain be moved
[1:00:22] and it will move
[1:00:24] authority
[1:00:26] sons of god the whole creation is
[1:00:29] groaning
[1:00:32] waiting for the manifestations of the
[1:00:34] sons of god
[1:01:08] the prayers
[1:01:11] aren't you thankful that he answers
[1:01:12] prayers
[1:01:14] but watch what he says
[1:01:16] we pray for it now
[1:01:20] but then
[1:01:21] commanded
[1:02:47] i said they'll cast out devils
[1:02:50] not i will
[1:02:53] they will
[1:02:56] are you part of the day
[1:03:00] if
[1:03:29] i would like to go to a scripture in
[1:03:30] genesis 1.
[1:03:34] how many enjoyed that first video about
[1:03:36] adoption
[1:03:41] you see i've been already working in
[1:03:42] that so this is where i'm at is in
[1:03:44] adoption
[1:03:47] and in there brother brennan made this
[1:03:49] statement
[1:03:52] and when they are born
[1:03:55] and
[1:03:56] he
[1:04:21] did you know that adam had to be born
[1:04:36] it's right here in the scripture
[1:04:38] hey amen
[1:04:40] let's go now to genesis 1.
[1:04:44] uno and we're going to actually start
[1:04:46] with verse 21.
[1:04:52] amen and this is actually on the fifth
[1:04:56] day that starts
[1:04:59] but as we go i'm going to ask you a few
[1:05:01] questions
[1:05:05] and if you have a notebook
[1:05:44] and god created great coils and
[1:05:46] everything living creature that moves
[1:05:48] which is in the water and waters brought
[1:05:50] forth abundantly after their kind in
[1:05:52] every wing foul after its kind and god
[1:05:55] saw that it was good
[1:06:06] are there already whales
[1:06:08] and he says this are there already
[1:06:10] whales are there already birds are they
[1:06:12] already living
[1:06:13] upon the uh crawling along the earth
[1:06:30] anybody want to answer
[1:06:32] there's really not a wrong answer so
[1:06:34] don't be afraid
[1:06:40] you think so okay
[1:06:42] i'll say amen big woman because god in
[1:06:45] genesis 1 created the spirit of
[1:06:49] everything
[1:06:56] but they were not yet physically
[1:07:26] what's
[1:07:37] that they would take physical forms
[1:07:49] i need it
[1:07:51] and the evening let's go down to verse
[1:07:53] 23 because i can keep meeting there
[1:07:57] in the evening in the morning
[1:08:01] now that was about the heavens and in
[1:08:03] the ocean in the ocean
[1:08:07] now as he begins to speak about the
[1:08:08] sixth day
[1:08:11] he's speaking about what he's going to
[1:08:13] do on the earth
[1:08:17] okay
[1:08:18] and god said let the earth bring forth
[1:08:20] the living creature after its time
[1:08:36] after its
[1:09:04] and he was the most subtle of all
[1:09:13] already there
[1:09:18] but his spirit was no
[1:09:21] god created
[1:09:22] his spirit
[1:09:24] it's the seed chapter of the bible
[1:09:29] and god made the beast of the earth
[1:09:30] after his kind the cattle after his kind
[1:09:32] verse 25
[1:09:34] everything that creepeth upon the earth
[1:09:37] after his kind and god saw that it was
[1:09:40] good
[1:10:24] [Music]
[1:10:28] if
[1:11:00] verse 26 and we've read this so many
[1:11:02] times
[1:11:04] and god said let us make man in our
[1:11:07] image
[1:11:10] imagine
[1:11:21] is that scripture still alive today
[1:11:38] not
[1:11:50] getting awful milky up here already
[1:11:53] that's okay
[1:11:55] let us make man in our image and after
[1:11:57] our likeness and let them have dominion
[1:12:00] over the fish of the sea over the fowl
[1:12:02] of the air over the cattle over all the
[1:12:05] earth over every creeping
[1:12:21] state see there were already animals
[1:12:30] and god was recreating a spirit man
[1:13:01] and guess what that was
[1:13:16] feminine sure
[1:13:20] i can get into another subject
[1:13:25] but make sure that that companion comes
[1:13:27] out of your theater
[1:13:44] it only confirms
[1:13:58] oh
[1:14:26] my pastor even told me one time don't
[1:14:27] you say that no more
[1:14:30] mad at me
[1:14:31] you degrade yourself
[1:14:33] because you're not just anybody
[1:14:36] you're not a son of god
[1:14:38] you're a general of god
[1:14:40] don't speak about
[1:14:51] amen
[1:14:53] verse 27
[1:14:56] so god created man in his own image
[1:15:02] in the image of god created he then
[1:15:07] male and female
[1:15:23] and god blessed him
[1:15:25] 28 and god said unto them
[1:15:28] be fruitful
[1:15:30] and watch fruitful comma that means time
[1:15:37] tiempo yes
[1:15:38] anytime you see a comma it's it's an
[1:15:40] opening of time
[1:15:47] oh it's going to take time for that
[1:15:48] fruit to come out right
[1:15:50] now
[1:15:55] the multiplication was going to come by
[1:15:57] the word the multiplication
[1:16:00] then it says comma
[1:16:02] oh when they would begin to multiply it
[1:16:04] would take time
[1:16:10] and replenish the earth
[1:16:14] and subdue it
[1:16:16] and have dominion over the efficiencies
[1:16:44] [Music]

[1:19:32] let's start with verse 4.
[1:19:57] [Music]
[1:20:05] watch this
[1:20:06] in chapter one it already said there was
[1:20:08] plants and there was trees and there was
[1:20:10] everything right
[1:20:15] and people in in the world who read the
[1:20:17] bible they say oh yeah i was already
[1:20:19] there
[1:20:30] and
[1:20:52] praise the lord jesus
[1:20:54] and every herb of the field before it
[1:20:57] grew italian
[1:21:00] for the lord god i love that brother
[1:21:02] danny i don't know if you're here
[1:21:03] tonight
[1:21:06] he might be at work or whatever but man
[1:21:08] when he preached on the lord
[1:21:22] because he did not recognize
[1:21:32] for the lord god had not caused it to
[1:21:34] rain upon the earth
[1:21:39] and there was no man to kill the soil
[1:22:03] and there was not a man to till the
[1:22:06] ground
[1:22:10] brother jimmy you just said god created
[1:22:11] a spirit man in genesis one he was
[1:22:13] walking around
[1:22:19] and the messenger says
[1:22:22] no telling
[1:22:33] but there went up a mist from the earth
[1:22:38] and water the whole face of the ground
[1:22:44] and the lord god formed man from the
[1:22:48] dust of the ground
[1:23:03] and
[1:23:04] man became a living soul
[1:23:08] i'm not going to turn to it because my
[1:23:10] time is gone
[1:23:14] but i'm not such blasphemous names if
[1:23:16] you want to mark it down
[1:23:18] famously the prophet says not like the
[1:23:21] jehovah's witnesses teach that
[1:23:24] he breathed into him the wind okay
[1:23:30] and any and he came alive
[1:23:34] he says he was already a living man
[1:23:40] he said what kind of life did he have
[1:23:42] before god breathed into his nostrils
[1:23:46] breath
[1:24:01] he goes what is that crown
[1:24:04] oh what what is that crown that god
[1:24:05] crowned his creation
[1:24:09] he turned away
[1:24:12] that was the crown that crowned adam
[1:24:55] and the lord god planted a garden
[1:24:58] eastward
[1:25:03] and he put the man that he had formed
[1:25:09] and out of the ground made the lord god
[1:25:11] to grow every tree that is pleasant
[1:25:18] and good for food
[1:25:20] a tree of life also nominates the god
[1:25:38] where
[1:25:43] [Music]
[1:26:05] but you're still
[1:26:48] adam that was born
[1:26:52] that had eternal life
[1:26:55] god placed him to the purpose
[1:26:57] of which god had
[1:27:42] may you reveal that to your children
