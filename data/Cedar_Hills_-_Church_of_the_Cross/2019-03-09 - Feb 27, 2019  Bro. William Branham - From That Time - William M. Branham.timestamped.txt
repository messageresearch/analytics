[23:59] let us bow our heads down for a word of
[24:02] Prayer II will start right into the

[24:06] Jesus to bless his word that we read now
[24:10] our Heavenly Father we come tonight to
[24:15] ask you to receive us as a people as
[24:20] your church and this building which is
[24:24] call here the Madison Square Garden of
[24:27] Phoenix
[24:28] I pray the Heavenly Father that you will
[24:32] sanctify this building that the angels
[24:37] of God will move in or we realize that
[24:42] it's not the building that we're in it's
[24:44] the people in the building it's not the
[24:48] building that makes the church it's the
[24:50] people inside of the building and I pray
[24:55] thee Heavenly Father that this the
[24:57] purchase of that blood tonight being
[24:59] gathered here the people that will live
[25:04] forever in a world that is to come and
[25:07] we've come here for the purpose of
[25:09] fellowshipping through the Holy Spirit
[25:12] and enjoying the Word of God as brother
[25:16] David du plessis our teacher and many
[25:19] others are bringing the word and that
[25:23] the Holy Spirit might come and convince
[25:26] sinners are there wrong I am with
[25:29] brainiest present soap near on to us
[25:33] that all the peoples would want to serve
[25:37] Him granite Lord and there's no man
[25:42] that's able to open the book our to
[25:45] loose the seals thereof but there was a
[25:48] lamb that had been slain from the
[25:50] foundation of the world he come and took
[25:54] the book out of the hand of him that
[25:56] stood upon the throne for he was worthy
[25:58] Oh
[26:01] of God come tonight in our tents farming
[26:05] power and take the words that we shall
[26:09] read and reveal them to us in the power
[26:13] of the Spirit
[26:15] when this service shall in tonight may
[26:19] ever unbeliever that's present become a
[26:22] believer may lows that are fallen from
[26:25] the way renew their vows the sick be
[26:28] healed and when we were on our way
[26:30] across the city in different places may
[26:34] we say like those who came from Emmaus
[26:36] that day did not our hearts burn within
[26:40] us as he talked to us along the way then
[26:45] father we would pray that you would do
[26:46] something outstanding tonight that would
[26:50] attract the attention of the people
[26:52] through thy word make thy word alive to
[26:56] us we are able to read it who has enough
[27:00] education to read we can read it but we
[27:02] cannot make it live it takes the spirit
[27:07] the Holy Spirit to make the word live
[27:10] may it live in every heart here tonight
[27:13] we asked in Jesus name Amen
[27:20] do you are keeping record all the texts
[27:23] that we read I would ask you tonight to
[27:26] turn to the fourth chapter of Saint
[27:29] Matthew's Gospel the fourth chapter and
[27:32] we will read the 16th and 17th verse for
[27:41] a reading and the the people which sat
[27:47] in darkness saw great light and to them
[27:50] that said in the regions of the shadows
[27:53] of death light is sprung up from that
[27:59] time Jesus began to preach and to say
[28:02] repent or the kingdom of heaven is at
[28:06] hand
[28:07] may the Lord at his blessings to the
[28:10] reading of his word now for a
[28:13] I wish to take the let the first three
[28:18] words are the 17th verse from that time
[28:27] you know there's we as people tonight
[28:31] can think back of certain times certain
[28:35] things began there's no doubt in my mind
[28:40] but what many people here can recall
[28:45] certain time that something happened and
[28:49] you say and from that time things were
[28:55] changed like a child he can say that I
[29:02] was a good child a good obedient boy or
[29:09] girl I'm one day I met up with a
[29:15] companion and they persuaded me to to do
[29:22] a certain thing and from that time it
[29:28] started how many times can we think of
[29:33] things like that that's happened in our
[29:36] life and we mark it from that time
[29:46] then we can think of the immoral woman
[29:51] she might say as a girl I was raised in
[29:56] a Christian home I was brought up with
[30:00] good parent and good Christian teaching
[30:05] and I was married to a fine Christian
[30:10] boy and our home was beautiful and we
[30:16] had two little children our soul and one
[30:22] day I was down in this city and I'll run
[30:28] into a girlfriend that I used to live in
[30:32] the neighborhood with her and she
[30:33] persuaded me on a date
[30:37] and from that time my home has ever been
[30:43] the same it could be all so that's the
[30:47] jump the alcoholic might say I was
[30:52] raised in a home that did not believe in
[30:56] drinking alcoholic beverages and I never
[31:02] drink in my life until one day such and
[31:09] such a thing happening from that time
[31:14] here a few years ago I was on my Road
[31:16] just south africa and i had to stay over
[31:20] two or three days in New York because I
[31:22] thought I could get by without having
[31:25] the yellow fever shot but they just
[31:28] wouldn't let me board the plane and I
[31:31] had to take the shop and wait for so
[31:33] many days and I had a meeting and there
[31:37] was a minister brother bird an
[31:39] outstanding noted full gospel minister
[31:42] of New York witches was a chaplain in
[31:46] the last war and they have missions down
[31:50] on the Bowery and he said to me brother
[31:53] branham how would you like to go with me
[31:55] tomorrow down
[31:56] diary that's what we dislike Skid Row in
[32:00] Chicago and I said brother Berg I'd be
[32:04] happy to go with you to the berry and we
[32:08] went down there and my heart ached when
[32:14] I seen man lay on the streets that was
[32:19] in such a terrible condition laying up
[32:25] against an automobile and their clothes
[32:29] all soil from the waist down and not
[32:34] even knowing what they were doing and
[32:37] some laying back in their alleys and
[32:40] cross each other just at the end of the
[32:45] road we went into a mission which the
[32:50] church sponsored and the pastor after
[32:54] meeting him he said we taken 180 carts
[32:59] from this building in a year
[33:01] of those alcoholics that came in to this
[33:04] mission and died here all services going
[33:07] on or doing the night a hundred and
[33:11] eighty and then I went out on the
[33:15] streets I thought is it there something
[33:18] can be done about it and as we walked I
[33:23] said brother Barry I suppose all these
[33:27] man year was raised up in the slums and
[33:30] never had a chance all he said you'd be
[33:34] surprised brother branham you should
[33:37] talk to some of them and I said I would
[33:41] like to he said if we can find one
[33:43] that's not so far gone that we could
[33:46] speak to him I'd like for you to talk I
[33:48] said all right and a certain fella
[33:52] we raised up and he spoke team said can
[33:56] you hear me said give you a drink I said
[33:59] I'm a a minister I would like to know
[34:03] why that you would throw your life away
[34:06] like this when I said minister
[34:10] roused up and looked at me and he said
[34:14] excuse me sir for asking you for enough
[34:17] money to buy me a drink but you don't
[34:20] know my chase I said sir I sympathize
[34:25] with you
[34:27] my father drink any drink all until
[34:32] death tucking I'm not making you the
[34:38] worst person in the world but I would
[34:39] like to know a man that's got enough
[34:43] decency about him to excuse his self
[34:46] when he sees that he's done wrong how
[34:49] could you ever throw your life to this
[34:53] he said son I can almost point my finger
[34:59] and show you with my eyes the bank that
[35:03] I was president of I said sir is that
[35:08] truth he said my name is such-and-such a
[35:11] name you might go to the bank and see if
[35:14] that's right or not I said how did you
[35:16] come to do this he said I had Christian
[35:19] training and I was once the member of
[35:23] the church a simple what caused you to
[35:28] do this said one day I'd come home from
[35:32] work I had a lovely family and a
[35:35] beautiful wife he said that I found what
[35:40] we call a Dear John letter laying on the
[35:43] table my wife had gone and from that
[35:48] time I tried to drown my sorrow with
[35:53] drinking oh I said I wished I could take
[35:57] you back to that time that time if he
[36:03] could only go back to that time I talked
[36:09] to a young woman some time ago who was
[36:11] in the emergency room she was from the
[36:15] psychopathic they're a great meeting at
[36:19] Flint Michigan and
[36:21] they had maybe 30 cases of insanity in
[36:25] the room and they said you could not
[36:27] bring him out in public because they
[36:29] were in straightjackets and in all kinds
[36:32] of conditions and I went into the room
[36:36] and one man went with me and when we
[36:39] went in there there was a beautiful
[36:41] young woman looked to be about 20 or 25
[36:45] years old sitting there I said how do
[36:48] you do she said how do you do and I said
[36:52] well it's hard to know which way to
[36:53] start and some of them out of their
[36:55] minds and screaming and and people
[36:58] watching them and she said if you don't
[37:01] mind sir I'd like for you to start with
[37:03] me
[37:04] I said with you
[37:07] she said yes sir I said you're not a
[37:10] patient are you she said yes sir I am
[37:12] well I said you seem to have your right
[37:15] mind she said I wonder and she said
[37:20] could you listen to my story just a
[37:22] moment
[37:23] I said certainly madam and she started
[37:26] telling me she said I was reared in a
[37:30] good home she said in my mother taught
[37:34] me not to do wrong to a shun evil and to
[37:38] embrace the right thing she said and I
[37:42] live that kind of life for a number of
[37:44] years and I got mixed up with a young
[37:47] man and she said if the calls the
[37:52] disgrace to me I accept I just started
[37:58] and told myself away you know I become
[38:00] an alcoholic said then they picked me up
[38:03] and sent me to a Catholic institution
[38:05] called the Good Shepherd's home so there
[38:09] I was under correction for a number of
[38:11] years and then they release me and as
[38:14] soon as I got out from that I started
[38:17] drinking again and said then I'll serve
[38:21] a year or two and woman state prison and
[38:26] said then I had changed from Protestant
[38:30] to Catholic then doing this time I
[38:32] changed back the Protestant again
[38:35] from the chaplain talking to me and said
[38:39] I'd come out and try it again but said I
[38:42] went right back into it again into
[38:45] prostitution drinking and I said to your
[38:50] mother she's dead your father dead I
[38:56] said what do you think they would think
[38:59] about you now she's a no if I could only
[39:02] go back in here
[39:04] I said a lovely young woman like you
[39:08] don't you desire to be married and have
[39:11] babies like all mothers do and so forth
[39:15] she said I would love to sir but look at
[39:17] me what could I offer anyone I said
[39:22] you've got one thing you can offer she
[39:25] said what's that I said you're sold to
[39:27] Jesus Christ she said sir he wouldn't
[39:31] receive it I said oh yes he will so how
[39:36] do you know he would have tried I said
[39:38] yes you're just turning pages but you
[39:41] really come to him she said what could
[39:45] he do with me I said make a lady out of
[39:48] you said not me I'm too far gone I said
[39:52] he can take you back to the time when
[39:55] you was a virgin innocent girl the blood
[40:00] of Jesus Christ is sufficient and
[40:03] powerful to transform the vilest sinner
[40:08] to a blood wash I got this before God
[40:14] she said I've tried that so many times I
[40:18] said I want to tell you I believe your
[40:21] case has never been diagnosed right I
[40:23] said you don't want to be like that she
[40:26] said certainly not so just what you
[40:29] mentioned a while ago is what I want to
[40:31] be a mother with husband with babies
[40:38] someone to love in someone that loves me
[40:43] I never spoil a man's life
[40:45] I said you don't have to I said that
[40:51] this may sound old-fashioned sister but
[40:55] it's the truth nevertheless if some
[40:59] devil it's done that to you it's the
[41:02] devil it's got a hold of you driving you
[41:05] to things that you don't want to do she
[41:09] looked at me with those big dark eyes
[41:11] and said I've always believed that was
[41:13] the truth I said would you kneel here
[41:16] with me she said now they tell me I'm
[41:19] I'm a mental case I said you are but
[41:24] upset Jesus Christ restores right mind
[41:29] there's nothing too great for him and
[41:34] she said do you think he would for me I
[41:37] said certainly but we've got to get that
[41:41] devil out of there before he can war he
[41:43] entered when he was a young girl he'll
[41:46] go out and you'll go right back to that
[41:47] place again and she got down on her
[41:50] knees and I asked her to pray and she
[41:53] prayed for a few moments she looked over
[41:56] at me and she said brother Branham ah
[41:59] now I'm going to make a new start
[42:01] I said sis they won't do one bit of good
[42:04] you're going just exactly the same road
[42:07] you've been over it won't work and she
[42:12] said I I don't mean it in my heart I
[42:14] said I know you do but that Devils more
[42:17] stronger than any mental powers that you
[42:19] could to him that's the reason I
[42:22] don't believe in an intellectual
[42:23] religion I believe a man's got to be
[42:26] born together the holy just got to be
[42:30] deeper than you're thinking got to be an
[42:34] experience and she said what must I do
[42:39] us and just stay right there and we
[42:44] prayed and prayed I went ahead and pray
[42:46] for some more people and come back she
[42:47] was praying I come back to her again and
[42:51] a chihuahua come back and she was
[42:53] getting deeply in sincerity in a few
[42:56] moments she
[42:57] dump of tears running down her cheeks
[43:00] she look me in the face
[43:01] she said brother branham what things
[43:04] happened I say you don't have to turn
[43:08] though new pages now the woman's married
[43:11] you got a family a lovely sweet board to
[43:15] get the Holy Spirit filled st. gall God
[43:20] could take her back to a place or she
[43:23] started to do wrong that's his goodness
[43:27] and from that time she was a changed
[43:29] woman from the time of a young girl to
[43:33] at one time she was evil God take her
[43:36] back and from that time she was
[43:38] different those things of turning new
[43:42] pages that's good we think that's very
[43:45] good just like after the First World War
[43:48] many of you man in women can remember
[43:51] that perhaps I was a little boy of about
[43:54] eight or nine years old I remember well
[43:58] I've even ministers saying war is over
[44:01] we'll never have no more Wars that's all
[44:03] settle down we just can't have no more
[44:06] Wars because we got poison gases and so
[44:09] forth many you remember that the nation
[44:12] told us waters are settle for good they
[44:15] omit that from that time they said
[44:18] they'll beat him all along but we had
[44:20] them just the same when they begin to
[44:23] see rumors rising up nation turning
[44:26] against nation they formed what was
[44:28] known as the League of Nations to police
[44:31] the nation's they tried that see that
[44:34] was mental but it did not work if
[44:37] daughters tied into one of the greatest
[44:39] wars we ever had after that now they've
[44:43] got what they call the UN police the
[44:46] nation's again but it will fail just as
[44:49] sure as two twos are four
[44:52] it's got to fail they think it's good
[44:57] which it is but as long as mental
[44:59] thinking it doesn't do it it takes
[45:02] Revelation spiritual revelation all
[45:06] those things as good as they may be
[45:08] trying to join
[45:10] Church that's good I think everyone
[45:14] ought to join church that's good as far
[45:17] as it goes but that's not secure I think
[45:22] that everyone ought to take their choice
[45:24] as American citizens to join any church
[45:27] that they want to and I think that we
[45:30] ought not to dis fellowship that person
[45:32] upon their convictions I think we should
[45:35] all fellowship with one another asking
[45:37] God's mercies on us all but that's not
[45:43] the thing yet every new year's man will
[45:46] make a pledge go out and write on a book
[45:49] maybe on the Bible sheet and say I'll
[45:52] never drink again I'll never smoke again
[45:54] I'll never be untrue to my wife again
[45:57] and less than five or ten days they've
[45:59] broke every vowel delayed see they're
[46:03] making it by mental conception that's
[46:07] why many people join churches because
[46:10] they fear hell and they come and put
[46:14] their names on books and go out but it
[46:18] doesn't not lasting all those things are
[46:24] temporal but there is a time when a
[46:29] certain thing can happen and from that
[46:32] it's different really different
[46:34] that's when man meets God things change
[46:39] when man meets God a man can never meet
[46:44] God and ever be the same again
[46:47] you will either be a better person or a
[46:52] worse person you'll be better off or
[46:56] worse off after you meet God it depends
[47:01] on what you want to do about it but a
[47:06] man can never meet God and ever be the
[47:08] same
[47:10] whatever your attitude is towards God
[47:13] healed your eternal destination you can
[47:18] walk across the line between grace mercy
[47:21] and judgment
[47:23] and when you spurn grace so many times
[47:26] you can separate yourself from ever from
[47:29] the presence of God or you can accept
[47:32] him and have eternal life and never
[47:36] forget at the last day in the general
[47:39] resurrection oh no I am that there's
[47:44] something that we can point back to and
[47:46] say from that time something happened
[47:51] let's take some man that met God that
[47:55] changed their destination in the
[47:57] destination other their generation let's
[48:01] take for instance Abraham he was just an
[48:05] ordinary man he was not a saint he was
[48:09] just a man and all I'm so glad that we
[48:14] don't have to be born in a certain liner
[48:16] or be some great somebody we just have
[48:20] to be humble God's graces what does the
[48:26] word Abraham just the name down perhaps
[48:32] in the bushes one day in the valleys of
[48:35] the Shanghai Valley in the south of city
[48:38] of error wandering about out of the bush
[48:41] maybe with his sheep or so forth and God
[48:44] met him I spoke to him at blasting off
[48:50] believe that a man comes to God and ever
[48:53] has a definite experience or maybe you
[48:58] think I'm beside myself but look I don't
[49:04] need an impersonation of an experienced
[49:06] we've got so much of that today till it
[49:09] makes a real Christian sick to look at
[49:12] it somebody trying to impersonate
[49:14] somebody else God has ever made to the
[49:19] same he never did any never will God's a
[49:25] God of variety makes big hills and
[49:27] little hills and deserts and swamplands
[49:30] and want more he's a god
[49:32] body don't try to impersonate anyone
[49:34] else be what you are what God made you
[49:40] Abraham God spoke to him he had a
[49:44] definite experience and it changed his
[49:47] life and the strange thing is when a man
[49:52] meets God he can never be the same and
[49:56] can always point back to that time when
[49:58] he met him God spoke to Abraham and
[50:04] Abraham acted different and every time a
[50:08] man meets God
[50:10] from that time on he'll act ever if he
[50:15] rejects God
[50:16] he'll be on infidel right or he'll be an
[50:20] impersonator a hypocrite or he'll be a
[50:24] godly hated person and a lot different
[50:27] talk different less different at
[50:29] different peculiar odd letter the Holy
[50:34] Spirit let me tell you something is my
[50:37] brother and sister I have never had a
[50:41] god help me to never be that ever tried
[50:45] to be somebody that's when you're
[50:48] nothing twist myself and such great big
[50:52] things still have to have thousands of
[50:54] dollars tonight the sponsor some program
[51:00] let me be just brother branham let me be
[51:05] just what God would make me to be no
[51:10] matter what it is if it's the Saudi
[51:12] crackers and Drake Greenwich Water Well
[51:14] overhauls whatever it is let me be what
[51:18] God would have me to be never tried to
[51:21] be something that you're not Abraham he
[51:25] was different from the times God met him
[51:28] and the sometimes when God meets a man
[51:32] it looked like Abraham could have had
[51:35] the world in his hand the apostles with
[51:38] great powers could ahead
[51:41] their hand as it was the same go to
[51:46] spread fame everywhere but that kind of
[51:49] fame soon dies the only lasting fame is
[51:52] when your name is humble life
[51:57] that's when Fame is real thing this
[52:01] earthly things so decays now look at
[52:04] Abraham God told him to believe it and
[52:09] accept the miracle that had not yet
[52:12] happened and was impossible only with
[52:15] God for it to happen that was to believe
[52:17] that he is going to have a baby by Sarah
[52:19] and he believed God and called anything
[52:22] contrary to it as though it was not
[52:24] Abraham from the time he met God he was
[52:28] a changed man Moses was that inter
[52:34] lecture giant he had all the wisdom of
[52:37] the Egyptians that he could teach their
[52:39] teachers
[52:40] he was intellectualist he could be
[52:43] smarter far smarter than our most
[52:45] brilliant man today cause the Egyptians
[52:48] had things that we don't have today they
[52:51] could build her fear made we cannot they
[52:54] could embalm the body and make it look
[52:56] natural for hundreds and hundreds of
[52:57] years 72 hours is our limit they could
[53:00] put dying clothes that would never fade
[53:02] out we cannot do that many things that
[53:04] they had dig up things that they had
[53:06] that we could not we could not do the
[53:10] same today they were way smarter more
[53:13] intelligent and Moses could teach them
[53:16] but all of these intellectuals have
[53:19] never met God oh I'd like to see the
[53:23] preachers in here just a minute do you
[53:26] see brethren my fastest Methodist
[53:30] Presbyterian Pentecostals whoever you
[53:32] may be you can have a call of God on
[53:34] your life you can know that you're
[53:37] called to the ministry but you have no
[53:40] right to preach the gospel until you've
[53:42] had an experience with God of being born
[53:45] again
[53:47] Jesus told the disciples you wait in the
[53:50] city of Jerusalem until your new with
[53:51] power from on high
[53:53] Moses could not go down and deliver the
[53:57] children of Israel until first he met
[54:00] God paste the face and talk to him
[54:03] Wow most can say I was learning all the
[54:06] wisdom of the Egyptians but one day I
[54:09] was hurting my father-in-law's sheep at
[54:11] the backside of the desert I uh seen a
[54:14] bush burning and from that time he was a
[54:20] different man
[54:21] he didn't rely upon his intellectuals he
[54:24] was running from Egypt where God had
[54:26] called him but as soon as he met God he
[54:30] took a mule and his wife and his tongue
[54:33] and a little crooked stick and went down
[54:37] to Egypt while he had met God and from
[54:41] that time he was changed there was
[54:44] something different his intellectuals
[54:47] were lost he didn't think about the
[54:48] danger while he admit God he could point
[54:51] back to that time no man has a right to
[54:56] preach the gospel no person has a right
[55:00] to call themselves a Christian until
[55:03] they can go back to a certain time their
[55:07] life where they can come on that sacred
[55:09] sands at the backside of the desert
[55:11] where they know that they have met God
[55:15] all the infidels in the world needs
[55:18] intellectual Giants taken the Bible to
[55:20] explain the way all the days of miracles
[55:22] are passed there's no such a thing as
[55:24] divine healing all this stuff like
[55:27] speaking with tongues interpretation of
[55:29] tongues and gifts of healing and the
[55:31] baptism of the Holy Spirit they can
[55:32] slickly and take your mind and twist you
[55:35] in such a way until they can take that
[55:36] away from your memory they can explain
[55:39] it away I want you to get this and don't
[55:44] you never let it pass from you but if a
[55:46] man's ever stood on that sacred sand
[55:49] that's the backside of the desert when
[55:52] he needs God face to face there's not
[55:54] enough Devils at all
[55:57] get away from him he knows he met
[55:59] balance he knows he had an experience he
[56:03] talked to God regardless of what the
[56:06] opposition is he can say something oh
[56:13] well I can call the time and a little
[56:17] saloon that's being used as a church
[56:20] where some colored people was preaching
[56:21] the gospel how does a southerner net
[56:25] like colored people and a vision Kenan
[56:27] told me where to go find it and all the
[56:30] white girls that I've worked with both
[56:32] not all of them for five standard said
[56:34] Billy you're not going in there there I
[56:36] said yes I got to go so don't ever ask
[56:39] me for another date it doesn't make any
[56:41] difference on miss Garland
[56:45] Ventris that time has changed and point
[56:49] back to that time I was changed no man
[56:55] has right to forbid until he's got an
[56:59] experience no matter what the
[57:01] intellectuals can say you know you met
[57:03] God why intellectual knowledge would've
[57:07] told or just walked into his own death
[57:10] but he knowed he had met God and God was
[57:13] fun and still God the reason I'm so glad
[57:19] I can stay here just arena tonight gives
[57:23] shapes an uppercut that says Jesus
[57:26] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[57:27] forever and can prove it by His Holy
[57:30] Spirit here now
[57:36] not altogether with the word the word
[57:39] only porn Swaney but the Holy Spirit
[57:41] declares it and he's the same learn his
[57:46] blessings and his his promises we can
[57:49] say from that time something happened
[57:53] Mary was just an ordinary girl a good
[57:56] girl a virgin I'm go to say she is 16 or
[58:00] 18 years old engaged to a man Joseph now
[58:06] she was just an ordinary girl she loved
[58:10] God she believed in God but one day on
[58:14] her way to the welcome to get some water
[58:26] not because she was a virgin
[58:29] thousands of virgins millions we still
[58:33] have virgins but we can only have one
[58:35] Mary she can pull her finger from that
[58:38] time Oh God take us tonight to the wells
[58:46] of water that we can say from that time
[58:52] at Madison Square Garden Phoenix Arizona
[58:54] from that time something took a whole
[58:58] journey I had an experience doubts fell
[59:01] away from that time that time sure it
[59:08] was from that time Paul a persecutor of
[59:12] the church oh that little hook knows
[59:15] June show the power of decision of the
[59:18] church they had the keys that's true i
[59:21] watch how they made their decision
[59:23] talking about what the church can do the
[59:27] church has only got one key that's bad
[59:30] the church doesn't save you you remember
[59:34] the church by birth but the church
[59:37] doesn't save you is Christ that saves
[59:39] you
[59:40] it's not coming in contact with the
[59:41] church is coming to contact with Christ
[59:43] and then automatically you're in the
[59:45] church the church had the keys Jesus
[59:50] told him he gave him the keys look how
[59:52] they used it they said now it's written
[59:54] in the scriptures the scripture must be
[59:56] fulfilled but let another take his
[59:59] bishop read talking of Judas and he said
[1:00:02] let's choose one that has been in out
[1:00:04] among us and they had to they fine fine
[1:00:07] cultured man good man
[1:00:10] justice religious as they could be to
[1:00:13] the key man that were good reputation
[1:00:15] and they cast her lots and chose the
[1:00:19] Phoenix for what good did it do there
[1:00:21] isn't one thing record in the Bible
[1:00:24] that's if they ever did not one thing
[1:00:27] just a good old deacon or something
[1:00:29] another light but it is supposed to be
[1:00:30] an apostle God went over and chose a
[1:00:33] little old hot tip no church hater it
[1:00:38] shows that God didn't take nothing and
[1:00:40] make something out of it that's what me
[1:00:44] that's the reason I join myself tonight
[1:00:46] in the people at faith in this world is
[1:00:49] called holy rollers people of life up
[1:00:53] way up in some great bracket but many
[1:00:56] women spin of the gutters take it away
[1:01:04] from the things of the world home let's
[1:01:07] met God peace - peace and God has made
[1:01:10] Saints out of the enemy
[1:01:12] it's Amazing Grace how sweet the sound
[1:01:17] god does it that way they can point back
[1:01:20] say yes I was no good I took the name of
[1:01:23] the Lord in vain I did this I smoke I
[1:01:25] drink I was this way that way but from
[1:01:28] that time
[1:01:30] God things change no more drinking no
[1:01:35] more things in the world like past some
[1:01:37] death under life and from that time I
[1:01:39] become a new creature in Christ Paul
[1:01:43] Church hater Saint hater very religious
[1:01:48] hot-tempered persecuting the church
[1:01:51] sassy but a very intellectual man God
[1:01:55] said I'll just choose him now today half
[1:01:58] the church' deny him I'm God tuck him
[1:02:02] down on his road to Damascus that comes
[1:02:06] the killing of fire that led the
[1:02:07] children of Israel before they blinded
[1:02:09] him and made him fall to the earth he
[1:02:13] took that man and Paul could say this
[1:02:15] one time I was a religious Pharisee a
[1:02:18] Pharisee of the Pharisees I had good
[1:02:21] reinter let your back trainings but all
[1:02:23] of our education and all my
[1:02:26] intellectuals I had to forget to know
[1:02:29] how did you do it Paul I was on my road
[1:02:32] to Damascus to rest those people and a
[1:02:34] light shot from the heavens and struck
[1:02:36] me back I did from that time a man from
[1:02:44] that time he was a changed man Peter the
[1:02:50] fisherman would have liked was hired by
[1:02:54] blind boy you miss that late at the gate
[1:02:58] as we talked up last night the blind man
[1:03:02] could say I was blind or come in contact
[1:03:05] with God and from that time I could see
[1:03:08] oh yes if your spiritual blind come in
[1:03:13] contact with him in from that time you
[1:03:15] can see everything that comes in contact
[1:03:18] with God is changed the leper one time
[1:03:23] come in contact with God and he was
[1:03:26] changed from the leper to a well man
[1:03:31] that was the immoral woman one time met
[1:03:34] Jesus at the well she was full of sin
[1:03:37] her heart was heavy fat versions were
[1:03:41] too
[1:03:41] to better society uptick drought she
[1:03:46] stood there and seen just an ordinary
[1:03:47] Jew a fella honey aged for his looking
[1:03:52] age for his age I think the scripture
[1:03:55] claims that he looked to be 15 when he
[1:03:57] was only 30 and he said you're a man yet
[1:04:00] not over 50 years old and say you have
[1:04:02] seen Abraham you said before Abraham was
[1:04:04] I am
[1:04:06] so he is only 30 or 32 years old I'm a
[1:04:09] young beautiful woman come up one day to
[1:04:12] the well or he was setting tired and he
[1:04:15] said to her woman bring me a drink and
[1:04:18] she said it's not customary for you to
[1:04:20] ask me such things that I'm a Samaritan
[1:04:23] your Jew segregation he said but if you
[1:04:26] knew who you were talking to what was
[1:04:28] that woman doing she is meeting God she
[1:04:31] met a man but it wasn't a man it was God
[1:04:37] let that soak in the scripture said
[1:04:43] you've entertained angels not knowing
[1:04:44] what you were doing unaware of it
[1:04:48] same as Abraham entertained angels and
[1:04:51] immediately at the angel lesson have
[1:04:53] performed the miracle before him he
[1:04:55] called the man god help him
[1:04:58] they Almighty God painter eaten steak
[1:05:01] sandwiches drinking milk from the cow
[1:05:04] eaten cakes and he was Almighty God the
[1:05:09] woman little did she know look what have
[1:05:13] done for Abraham man it changed him and
[1:05:16] Sarah from role man role 100 years old
[1:05:20] back to you they met God
[1:05:25] that's like none of the difference this
[1:05:28] immoral woman she met Jesus and she
[1:05:30] spoke to him watch Haim 8701 he said
[1:05:33] woman go get your husband and come here
[1:05:35] she said I do not have any husband he
[1:05:38] said you said well boy you've had five
[1:05:42] husbands and the one you're now living
[1:05:44] with is not your husband you've said
[1:05:46] well and from that time she was changed
[1:05:50] oh what a difference but Jesus when she
[1:05:56] met him there looked like a man and when
[1:05:59] I could imagine seeing those big pretty
[1:06:02] eyes tears coming out of them she said
[1:06:06] sir I perceive that you're a prophet but
[1:06:12] who are you Jesus
[1:06:27] then the sign on the earth
[1:06:30] she's tarnished a few hours before that
[1:06:34] the city would Elias at her she couldn't
[1:06:37] even come to the well with the rest of
[1:06:39] women what happened what face of a
[1:06:42] listen to her if you ever been in the
[1:06:44] audience they would listen to a woman
[1:06:45] like that some oriental rug was trying
[1:06:48] Timmy said the woman wasn't constituted
[1:06:50] cause the man was a listen listen to her
[1:06:52] I said what brother you fail to see I
[1:06:56] don't know you could have been a
[1:06:58] drunkard you could have been a
[1:06:59] prostitute
[1:07:00] you could have been anything that you
[1:07:02] wanted to be but when you need from me
[1:07:09] from that time on she had a message that
[1:07:12] she had missed him aside because she
[1:07:14] seen the sign of the mesial she know
[1:07:17] that that was he or she said herself
[1:07:21] we know when Messiah cometh he'll tell
[1:07:24] us these things but who are you
[1:07:26] jesus said I'm he and she got the water
[1:07:30] pot of the way she went if she just
[1:07:34] spent on the platform tonight she said I
[1:07:35] was foul and him oil but I had read in
[1:07:39] the Bible where he used to be a god
[1:07:40] prophet when this man told me the fact
[1:07:43] that just a man but when he told me in
[1:07:45] my life I knew that that was the sign of
[1:07:48] the Messiah so a prophet has the potion
[1:07:50] of the massage spirit so I said sir you
[1:07:53] must be a prophet we know when Messiah
[1:07:56] cometh he'll tell us all things
[1:07:58] jesus said I'm he
[1:08:00] that speaks to you she note if a man who
[1:08:04] could do that would say why he was hip
[1:08:07] was right because back it up who can you
[1:08:14] get do you go over speaking home when
[1:08:17] God promised to send the Holy Spirit we
[1:08:22] saw it word this what we have tonight
[1:08:27] are the blessing of the Holy Spirit
[1:08:29] proves that a man's life if he's not
[1:08:31] impersonating something if he's not
[1:08:33] trying to act like something trying to
[1:08:36] act like something that he isn't if he
[1:08:37] really is God back something work with
[1:08:40] the person to the woman that was one
[1:08:43] steal of fame smoke cigarettes drain
[1:08:46] constitute that woman claims that she
[1:08:50] met God is still in the same things I
[1:08:52] doubt forward if a man tells me that he
[1:08:56] met God I don't bleed there is such a
[1:08:58] thing as divine healing I doubt his
[1:08:59] experience called God Kate lie about his
[1:09:03] own work if the Holy Spirit spoke the
[1:09:05] word when he comes in it'll say Amen to
[1:09:07] every word God no man says he don't
[1:09:12] believe in the baptism Holy Ghost
[1:09:13] I've doubt him every meetin gone he
[1:09:16] might be called he might be intellectual
[1:09:18] he might be a great man he might be an
[1:09:19] auditor neither lecturer our auditor
[1:09:22] some sort but he's never met God the
[1:09:24] Holy Spirit of God in a man who speak a
[1:09:26] man they ever word God's man he can say
[1:09:30] I once did not believe in divine healing
[1:09:32] but one day I met God and from then from
[1:09:35] that time it changed there's something
[1:09:39] come into me the transform me and give
[1:09:40] an experience I've never been able to
[1:09:42] forget it nothing to meet God without
[1:09:47] being changed somewhere Oh Judas met God
[1:09:51] yes one Steve is a man walked around the
[1:09:54] street but after meeting God into coming
[1:09:56] up a trailer he become a devil many
[1:10:00] times we find that you're not for saying
[1:10:02] but everything it comes into contact
[1:10:04] with God is changed now listen one day
[1:10:10] don't pay to get this Oh God
[1:10:14] one day death come in contact with God
[1:10:19] death come in contact with God the devil
[1:10:23] never could hardly believe that that was
[1:10:24] the Son of God or God made manifest he
[1:10:28] BB was a man just an ordinary man he
[1:10:31] couldn't see that God having a son so
[1:10:34] you never up on the Mount that day when
[1:10:36] he met him he said if thou be the Son of
[1:10:39] God command these stones to be made
[1:10:41] bread if thou be a little bit of doubt
[1:10:43] let me see you perform a miracle so I
[1:10:45] could believe you
[1:10:46] yes a lavinia so he had that hip if you
[1:10:50] until one day what do you see it
[1:10:52] defeated thought he was defeated here he
[1:10:57] was spit all over his face his face
[1:11:00] bleeding one of jerked handfuls of beard
[1:11:03] out spit his face put a rag around his
[1:11:06] head around his eyes took a stick and
[1:11:09] hit him on top the head it said now if
[1:11:11] you'd be a prophet
[1:11:12] tell us who hit you you could discern
[1:11:15] the thoughts of their heart and you
[1:11:17] could tell the woman not blood issue is
[1:11:19] stopped and all these things thought
[1:11:21] you'd be a prophet tell us who hit you
[1:11:23] see the devil's agents working there
[1:11:26] Jesus never opened his mouth he did what
[1:11:29] the father said to do is never gone and
[1:11:33] they nailed him up on the cross and he
[1:11:35] said now if you be the Son of God come
[1:11:37] down he could have done it but if he
[1:11:41] listened to the devil he could have done
[1:11:43] it but all he's rolled up there
[1:11:45] I'd imagine there was a decision when
[1:11:48] the devil looked down again and he says
[1:11:51] if that is life then I'm ruined but if
[1:11:56] it isn't life I know how to kill even at
[1:12:01] the cross
[1:12:02] that's a conference and helm the devil's
[1:12:06] angel was sent forth the Angel of Death
[1:12:08] and Jesus is going up Mount Calvary
[1:12:11] dragging the cross behind him it looked
[1:12:14] like it was defeated it's so simple
[1:12:16] catch this many times
[1:12:19] my van is so simple that it goes all the
[1:12:22] way over the head of people look like if
[1:12:25] you just say well I look like we can
[1:12:27] ever do this or do that don't look at it
[1:12:29] at all
[1:12:29] just obey the Holy Spirit no matter what
[1:12:32] he says you do it
[1:12:34] jealous God manifested in flesh boy up
[1:12:38] Towery bleeding blood dragging mouth
[1:12:42] hanging over them cross dragging out his
[1:12:44] footprints God the devil said God
[1:12:48] couldn't do a thing like that
[1:12:50] oh look at there how could God be
[1:12:52] manifested in him defeated look at the
[1:12:54] mockery spit on these things wonder if
[1:12:57] we as Christians could do that can you
[1:12:58] go the Second Mile can you turn the
[1:13:00] cheek the other side that's why the test
[1:13:03] Christianity see how far you can go and
[1:13:08] love fellowship Brotherhood that's how
[1:13:11] you test Christian you say from that
[1:13:13] time hold I know I was changed when you
[1:13:15] can do that could that be God could that
[1:13:19] be God's done going there Jehovah made
[1:13:22] manifest in flesh going up there with
[1:13:24] handfuls of beard pulled out his face
[1:13:26] while no one could stand that mockery
[1:13:29] spit in his face
[1:13:29] my agents voting on the head and said
[1:13:32] now I'll give you a prophet you got some
[1:13:34] kind of a make up work you you got
[1:13:35] somebody hope she put on the people now
[1:13:38] if you'd be a real prophet tell us who
[1:13:39] hit you will bleed in uh he couldn't be
[1:13:42] God here he goes on up and when he gets
[1:13:45] up the on the cross in a lean to the
[1:13:47] cross and today we'll set our body now
[1:13:50] after a while a weakness begin to set in
[1:13:52] from loss of blood
[1:13:53] what was it the be of deathless buzzing
[1:13:57] around him fixin to sting that be of
[1:14:00] death coming around in the sand oh I
[1:14:02] doubt that
[1:14:03] how could he be virgin born how could
[1:14:06] God dwell life that great Jehovah God
[1:14:08] who has all powers in the heavens and
[1:14:10] earth let somebody spit his face and
[1:14:12] take him on like that he couldn't he
[1:14:14] I was stuck the stinger into him brother
[1:14:17] he didn't know what he does when he put
[1:14:20] his finger into that flesh it took you
[1:14:23] stinger out one of e1 stains
[1:14:27] deeply it loses its stinger
[1:14:30] a honeybee insect that's got a stinger
[1:14:32] when it stains the flesh anchors and
[1:14:35] pulls the Stinger out and when death met
[1:14:39] God death lost its standard now death
[1:14:44] has no stinger
[1:14:45] it can buzz and make a noise and say
[1:14:48] I'll take you I'll kill you I'll do this
[1:14:50] the other but it has no stinger it lost
[1:14:53] at gathering Calvary no wonder Paul
[1:14:55] could say when he's coming out to either
[1:14:56] old Oh death where he is your stinger Oh
[1:15:00] grave where is your victory but thanks
[1:15:03] be to God who gives us the victory
[1:15:05] through our Lord Jesus Christ how that
[1:15:09] from that time death has no standard for
[1:15:12] the believer Christ took the sting of
[1:15:16] death out for the believer that's where
[1:15:20] he was wounded for our transgressions
[1:15:21] bruised for our iniquities the
[1:15:22] chastening with His stripes we were
[1:15:25] healed from that time Satan was stripped
[1:15:28] of everything that he had he's nothing
[1:15:30] but a bluff death is just a block that
[1:15:33] has no stare I'll help the hands of
[1:15:36] saints when I'm looking up towards
[1:15:38] heaven and say oh brother pancakes you
[1:15:40] see him standing there sure it has no
[1:15:44] stinger I help my own wife's hand when
[1:15:46] she looked into the glory she said Billy
[1:15:48] don't you never fail to preach this
[1:15:49] wonderful gospel oh it's the most
[1:15:51] glorious thing she said I'll never
