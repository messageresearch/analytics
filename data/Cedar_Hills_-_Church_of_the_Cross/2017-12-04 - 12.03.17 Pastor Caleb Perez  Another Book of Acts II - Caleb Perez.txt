us a man what an awesome God we serve amen [Music] around the middle of November and it's it came from the message off a super since and since writing this I've learned some really valuable lessons on not relying on these five senses because you know what they'll fail you what there's an old saying that goes don't believe anything you hear in half of what you see and I thought well how could that be if you see something with your eyes but you know you you can't believe everything you see and I had been prior to this I'd really been seeking the Lord about that substance of faith to possess it not to just profess it but to really make sure that I have that substance of thank you now I just it's just a simple poem but I pray it's a blessing to you now faith is the substance of things hoped for through faith we understand how the worlds were framed and through it the elders a good report obtained so that things which are seen were not made by things which do appear we cannot rely on what we see taste feels smell and hear the way our lives are controlled depends on what we yield our senses to by no means were these five image to the Spirit given to lead and guide you but there is a sixth sense superior to the other five which were given for earthly contact the sixth sense better known as faith given only to Christians fact it's the only one that governs and guides you the other five only lead to doubt its casting away everything contrary to what God said and this sense we can't live without for without faith it is impossible to please God with our tears and supplications he does not sympathize Oh but what touches and stops him is when our faith cries by his stripes I am healed that's what he wants us to testify not saying I'm not doing so well or I am trying to believe you are healed you are saved all is well do not deny if we could only realize the power in the words we speak Satan listens to every word we say so speak the word check let's check our motives let our yeas be A's and our nays Benes the correct mental attitude toward any divine promise of God will bring it to pass so we should pray daily for our minds to be renewed adjust our attitudes and simply ask being scornful and complaining robs us of the power of the Holy Ghost it drains us of oil of our oil I want to fix my heart mind soul and body on heavenly things and not for not toil we are his temple his chosen place to dwell a work in progress we stand let's allow him to complete the work he started in us till we reach the statue of a perfect man amen god bless you sister Lana for that

them back up again this morning and let's see what little battle but he takes our life nothing those keep them as trophies I'm gonna say that today no one takes our lives not in those people's we give

of Acts they'll promote libro de los nature's would he not remove all fear from another book of Acts no la dia de los libros de los they chose how many people are cold and indifferent today the second which I hate their fear indifferent take how many feel coldness coming into your life sometimes is the upon the free you and if you're honest sometimes you're on fire in church we can do lips and just raised and just do somersaults or so serene because he might make us and sometimes we can't even get in we can say well the preacher or the song leader shouldn't have to tell you to raise your hand it pretty cannot move it is usually scarce but if we did it automatically they wouldn't have to see Lucy Ramos automatic we received enough sometimes you gotta just when it shouldn't be that way you know areas that I see because when the day of Pentecost has fully come in your life or if you can the diplom in this area has a continual revival upon people oh the outer man may not always feel good he says I see the object to the inner man let us alone we have two minutes else you can tell us only ghosts inside of them there should be a revival inside of us constantly people nosotros yes or yes

feels yes ministered not even doing a good job I mean it's in the song later he's not making us feel good anything like that can't resist until the end I'm gonna tell you why the way of saying porque

blog we'd love to be entertained jokes and movies and everything else haha we love entertainment and those who Stella why because we walk after the flesh and not after the spirit and that was that this better than ago by the time we get to church one day God was any less yeah let me see if the preacher will do a backflip or somersault thus it was Erica over Sarah no matter what he can do to get me excited today because I'm not very excited I wasn't freaked out Naraku more very poor can you need to get to the altar no no get a hold of the Parakletos resident particulate oh I don't come here to be entertained you know anything either do I come here to entertain me but I'm here to give life and looking for a lot that one it accounts to the hey come here as a part of the product let the people of fun to lead for the Clippers but a significant I will gonna be a consoler to the people of Romana calm it's not for entertainment purposes what is the way you look but they did another yeah it's a shame when Jesus loves you doesn't turn you on anymore yep in a condo that his Luhan is on the look on wedding Jesus died for you that has no effective would you put a stay is the only message I heard from now until the coming of the Lord it would be more than enough yes in misaki's not cope with that captures it should be more than enough there must be some oh man we read a scripture it should be enough to cover letter said about something why are we in this condition porque estamos any stuck on this wire why do we get cold but caetano's enviable simply it's not hard no it's dude oh it's because the word doesn't have preeminence in us it's Kayla alive and I'm not even but I mean in cno's no it's the bottom line why is look for anywhere else what can we scared of one of the Masters it's not what the preacher of the song leader whoever does know look yeah that's it buddy not just God of the of the preacher no services just a song literally victories God of the laity of the audience you should be just as holy as the one appears cos then a car are you with me Church it's thank God me go it's for you it's for me it's for all of us as far as this but I miss but at those that's why if I went to Africa without the bata kleptos I don't want to go where is this kiss you you are you know I'll take a student but I'll go with fear yoy condom hoarder right but when he is there a token then it's time for a klepto says I'm gonna go with you but I collect a boy because I am gonna be their console er but can you be their advocate is gonna be this these things to them Joe a sin across it is the Holy Ghost was given for her but I stuff with all this beer I'd never book about put the church into action unless you're not the old instead of sitting in a Pew and know what the Thurston thousand unless these days maybe even the other stuff he says one of these days will never come oh yeah there's the new colony let's go on see gamos where then if the day of Pentecost had fully come and those who that's the idea but it was there's been no plan I mean there's the Pentecostal blessing that should be in the church okay I guess I'll just eleven this yoke it is not any less

the last age was no colloseum and Hadera says but when brother Branham drew out these seven Church ages said oh come the remember Gandhi wholeness yet Adonis he's the one that put that little bit of
