[13:49] in your life first placement everything
[13:52] that you do or what you are God must be
[13:55] first
[13:56] he doesn't want the second place he
[13:59] doesn't deserve the second place he
[14:02] deserves the best and the first and all
[14:05] that we've got he deserves it
[14:08] Blessed Be His holy name
[14:10] [Music]
[14:12] poor God also bearing Witness
[14:18] he gave testimony both were signs and
[14:22] wonders divers Miracles and Gifts of a
[14:26] holy ghost according to his own will
[14:32] not what man say what the church said
[14:35] but what God's will was
[14:39] oh we need to seek the will of God
[14:44] not to favor of your neighbor
[14:47] not the favor of your children
[14:49] that's a favor of your husband or your
[14:52] wife but seek the will of God
[14:55] do that first
[14:57] let everything else the will of the wife
[14:59] and the will of the children will fall
[15:01] right in with it but Place God first
[15:05] oh God
[15:08] he became Lord and his creation
[15:12] that he might redeem man homeless
[15:16] helpless man and give them a home in
[15:19] heaven
[15:20] he left the glories of Heaven
[15:23] he left the highest name that could be
[15:26] called and when he was on Earth meant
[15:28] give him the lowest name that they could
[15:31] give him
[15:32] said he was an illegitimate baby to
[15:36] start with born in a manger
[15:39] wrapping Rags off the back of the Yoke
[15:42] of an ox no place to go had no home to
[15:46] go to
[15:48] and was called the algebra the chief of
[15:52] the devils
[15:54] he was mistreated he was spit on he was
[15:57] made fun of he was rejected
[16:00] prostitutes
[16:06] that's what man done to him but God
[16:09] raised him up so high that he didn't
[16:12] have to look down to see heaven
[16:14] man get in the loyal seat given the
[16:16] worst place the lowest thing God raised
[16:19] him up getting the highest seat and the
[16:21] highest name
[16:23] that's the difference what man done with
[16:26] the Son of God and what God done with
[16:27] the son of God
[16:30] he stooped that we might be lifted
[16:33] he become us that we do his grace might
[16:36] become him
[16:37] he come to the homeless and became
[16:39] homeless himself that we might have a
[16:42] home
[16:42] he came to the sick and was made sick
[16:45] himself that we might be healed
[16:47] he came to the center and made sin
[16:49] himself that we might be saved
[16:52] no wonder he was exalted
[16:55] no wonder he is who he is tonight
[16:58] God has exalted him
[17:00] and all the powers and heavens and earth
[17:02] is give to him oh how we can only stop
[17:06] just in him
[17:08] who are you anyhow
[17:11] what does that job you got me either
[17:13] what there's a little house we hold mean
[17:15] what does the Clarion mean
[17:18] pretty little girl you little sassy
[17:20] thing what does that little look that
[17:22] you have now at you young man with a
[17:24] shiny slick hair
[17:27] straight shoulders you'll bend down
[17:29] someday with stupid AIDS
[17:33] blessed be the Lord
[17:35] you've got a soul that's bothered again
[17:38] you will live forever and ever because
[17:41] he become you that you through his grace
[17:43] might become him
[17:45] make a place for him
[17:47] oh we who think that we gotta change our
[17:50] clothes and a few groceries in the house
[17:52] what are we
[17:54] God could take it in a second
[17:57] you're very breath holes in his hand
[18:01] and even our midst
[18:07] and to foretell and every time perfect
[18:11] and even concerned us to bring a little
[18:13] dead fish back to its life again
[18:16] in the midst of us the Bible said he has
[18:19] set it on high and give gifts on the man
[18:22] that was the atmosphere hung over the
[18:24] Earth
[18:25] of Darkness of Gloom of death and weary
[18:29] the prayers can come up because the
[18:32] atonement was made but he broke through
[18:35] that Veil
[18:37] he opened up the way
[18:39] he broke the veil of sickness he broke
[18:42] the veil of sin he broke the veil of
[18:44] weary he broke the veil of depressed he
[18:48] broke every veil in me the highway
[18:52] foreign
[18:56] [Music]
[19:14] [Music]
[19:16] put all things in subjection under his
[19:19] feet he left nothing
[19:21] that is not under him
[19:23] but now we see not all things but under
[19:28] him that's dead
[19:30] we don't see death yet because we're
[19:32] still dying
[19:33] we see their butt nice person but we see
[19:38] Jesus amen
[19:42] for it becometh him for whom all all
[19:46] things that by whom we have all things
[19:51] and then again many sons if he made the
[19:54] chief captain of our Salvation through
[19:57] suffering the only way he can become the
[19:59] captain of our Salvation he had to
[20:01] suffer listen to these beautiful words
[20:03] you know
[20:04] Allison
[20:06] horrible he that Sanctified and they
[20:09] that are Sanctified are all one
[20:13] oh don't you see the bar and the branch
[20:15] there all one
[20:18] for which cause he is not ashamed to be
[20:21] called
[20:23] brethren
[20:24] see why
[20:26] listen to the next verse saying I will
[20:30] declare thy mean unto my brethren
[20:34] in the midst of the church will I Sing
[20:37] Praises unto thee
[20:39] and again I will put my trust in him
[20:43] and again behold I and the children
[20:46] which thou has given me or so much then
[20:49] as the children are partakers our flesh
[20:52] and
[20:53] blood
[20:55] he also himself likewise took part
[20:59] all the same that through the death he
[21:04] might destroy him which has the power of
[21:07] death that is the devil and deliver them
[21:10] who through for the through for death
[21:14] were always kept subject into
[21:19] bondage
[21:21] men always feared death
[21:24] Christ became sin made low to take death
[21:28] upon himself and he's not ashamed to be
[21:31] called
[21:32] our brother for he was gifted just like
[21:37] we are tempted so don't you see brother
[21:39] sister the whole thing is Grace
[21:42] all of it is Grace
[21:44] it's not what you do anyhow it's what
[21:47] he's already done for you
[21:50] now you can't do one thing to marriage
[21:52] your salvation your salvation is a gift
[21:56] Christ became sin
[21:59] that you might become righteous
[22:02] and he's the right kind of a chief
[22:04] Captain for our Salvation because he
[22:08] suffered just like we suffered he's been
[22:11] tempted just like we're tempted and he's
[22:13] not ashamed to be called our brother
[22:16] [Music]
[22:17] because he knows what we go through with
[22:22] God may we never neglect this great
[22:24] salvation but may we embrace it and
[22:26] accept it and be revered and live by
[22:28] until the day that Jesus comes to take
[22:30] us home

[50:07] please
[50:15] versus
[50:23] 1-13 First Corinthians chapter 12.
[50:30] and then we're gonna read Philippians 1
[50:33] verses 20 to 27.
[50:39] foreign
[51:11] whoever I give you to understand that no
[51:14] man speaking by the spirit of God calls
[51:16] Jesus a curse
[51:21] can say Jesus is the Lord but by the
[51:25] holy ghosts
[51:30] now there are diversity of gifts but the
[51:33] Same Spirit yes
[51:36] and there are differences of differences
[51:39] of administration but the same Lord yes
[51:47] and there are diversities of operations
[51:50] but it is the same God which work works
[51:53] all in all manifestation
[51:58] but the the manifestation of the spirit
[52:01] is given to every man to your Prophet
[52:02] without
[52:10] for the one is given by this the spirit
[52:12] the word of wisdom and to another word
[52:14] of knowledge by The Same Spirit
[52:20] into another Faith by The Same Spirit to
[52:23] another gift of healing by the same
[52:26] Spirits
[52:33] so another working of Miracles to
[52:35] another prophecy to another Discerning
[52:37] of spirits to another diverse kinds of
[52:39] tongues to another the interpretation of
[52:41] tongues
[52:48] that all these works the one and the
[52:51] self-same spirit divide into every man
[52:54] severally as he will
[52:57] soon Christo
[53:05] or as one but for the body is one and
[53:07] has many members and all the members of
[53:10] that one body being many are one body
[53:12] though also is Christo
[53:19] for by one Spirit we are all baptized
[53:22] into one
[53:23] bodygues
[53:28] whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether
[53:31] we be boundary and have been all made to
[53:33] drink into one spirit
[53:38] for the body is not one member but many

[56:29] um
[56:31] your subtitle is teamwork
[56:41] I'm just going to give you what I
[56:44] received from God
[56:46] cuando
[56:49] Caleb I remember when I called brother
[56:51] Kayla is
[56:55] to make an agreement on the date when I
[56:58] would come when
[57:00] I hung up the phone
[57:03] um
[57:08] hung up the phone I thought the leading
[57:10] the recipe to Santo of the Holy Spirit
[57:15] and he told me to go to the book of
[57:18] Philippians
[57:19] he
[57:20] is a
[57:23] yellow yellow
[57:27] I've been reading it in weeks before
[57:31] and and I I looked at the topic again
[57:42] I'm going to share a few scriptures with
[57:44] you in a little while but that just
[57:46] jumped out at me
[57:49] and that's where I got the stock from
[58:06] reinforce the teamwork
[58:14] the privilege to to congratulate your
[58:18] pastorio together with the ministry
[58:22] and all the church here in Las Cruces
[58:25] for the great work that they have done
[58:31] I know it's not man doing the work
[58:34] is is it's God doing the work
[58:39] we are just servants he
[58:42] foreign
[59:02] I was reading in the message Oneness
[59:06] he
[59:08] is
[59:10] and the prophet of the Lord says
[59:27] amen
[59:29] of course they say it again
[59:33] make it up
[59:38] God calls us by the Holy Spirit
[59:40] we are baptized
[59:43] to be part of that body
[59:46] to be able to occupy a place
[59:50] for a certain function inside of the
[59:53] body
[59:54] the mystical body of the Lord Jesus
[1:00:02] [Music]
[1:00:09] as the body is
[1:00:12] and has many members
[1:00:16] and all the members being many Sonos
[1:00:23] so also
[1:00:27] isados for by one spread we were all
[1:00:30] baptized into one body
[1:00:34] with Jews or Gentiles
[1:00:40] and it has been made all to drink into
[1:00:43] one spirit
[1:00:46] for the body is not one member many
[1:01:01] because I am not the I am not of the
[1:01:04] body is it therefore not of the body is
[1:01:22] the hearing if the whole body were
[1:01:25] hearing the smelly Masa colocados
[1:01:31] but now God has said the members of
[1:01:34] every one of them in the body as it has
[1:01:37] pleased him
[1:01:38] foreign
[1:01:47] but now are they many members yeah but
[1:01:51] one body
[1:01:53] necesito and the I cannot say to the
[1:01:56] hand I have no need of you
[1:01:59] New York again the head to the feet
[1:02:09] much more of those members of the body
[1:02:12] which seem to be more evil are necessary
[1:02:15] yeah
[1:02:24] and those members of the body which we
[1:02:27] think to be less honorable upon this we
[1:02:29] bestow more abundant honor in our in our
[1:02:32] uncommonly parts have more abundant
[1:02:34] Communists
[1:02:44] for our commonly Parts you have no need
[1:02:46] but God has tempered the body together
[1:02:49] having given more abundant honor to the
[1:02:51] part which Lacks
[1:03:01] there should be no Schism in the body
[1:03:04] but that the members should have the
[1:03:06] same care one for the other
[1:03:10] um
[1:03:19] a family where part of the body of
[1:03:22] Christ
[1:03:24] but sometimes we don't seem to care
[1:03:27] about our brothers
[1:03:30] our sister
[1:03:33] the way we should treat them and behave
[1:03:37] uh
[1:03:40] participation is
[1:03:48] the same way in the spiritual for the
[1:03:50] body to work together it has to work it
[1:03:53] is commonly in the same way the Body
[1:03:54] Works in the naturalness
[1:03:57] it's teamwork
[1:04:03] there can be advancements and you can
[1:04:05] see the results
[1:04:25] it's also the quality to maintain
[1:04:28] themselves United
[1:04:32] and to be able to create an atmosphere
[1:04:34] of positive work
[1:04:40] and how the members of that body
[1:04:42] recognize the the efforts of each member
[1:04:45] of the body
[1:04:57] a combined effort
[1:05:00] to give and take armonia Harmony
[1:05:11] and partnership
[1:05:17] I want to look in English that said
[1:05:20] partnership
[1:05:27] compellation is fellowship they said
[1:05:30] partnership you know in English it says
[1:05:33] partnership
[1:05:34] that is different
[1:05:36] it is the partner is the the companero
[1:05:39] partner is a companion or an associate
[1:05:44] somebody that's in aligned one with the
[1:05:46] other is
[1:06:12] there will be no second one there to
[1:06:14] pick him up
[1:06:19] how beautiful it is to be able to work
[1:06:22] and as one as a team
[1:06:26] the Lord has called us to be a part of
[1:06:29] the mystical body of the Lord Jesus
[1:06:31] and through the New Birth
[1:06:34] by the Holy Spirit
[1:06:38] first he deals with us individually
[1:06:43] then collectively El is
[1:06:49] to be a part of this mystical body of
[1:06:52] the Lord Jesus
[1:06:54] and each one of us have a function
[1:07:00] is not the function that you have chosen
[1:07:04] it's like the body
[1:07:07] your body
[1:07:11] God put your hand here
[1:07:15] if you would have wanted it to be the
[1:07:17] head with us it would not be here
[1:07:22] many times
[1:07:26] we do not understand
[1:07:29] what God has called us
[1:07:34] and it's because of the lack of that new
[1:07:37] birth
[1:07:38] you can have a gift
[1:07:48] because gifts are without repentance
[1:07:52] there are men that have tremendous gifts
[1:07:54] of God
[1:07:56] but if that new birth
[1:07:59] or without that new birth they do more
[1:08:02] damage than good
[1:08:04] but how wonderful it is
[1:08:07] that God has given them a gift
[1:08:32] to be a blessing not only for the local
[1:08:34] church
[1:08:36] but wherever God would send you
[1:08:39] that is something very tremendous
[1:08:42] and something that I admire very much
[1:08:47] of the Servants of God of the ministers
[1:09:01] maintain yourself humble and simple
[1:09:06] really that is the Holy Spirit
[1:09:13] can we give an Applause to the Servants
[1:09:15] of God
[1:09:24] and amongst us there's quite a few of
[1:09:27] them
[1:09:29] they have been an example to me in
[1:09:32] my walk
[1:09:35] if it wasn't for those men
[1:09:40] what would happen with this message
[1:09:42] what happened to us
[1:09:46] we would not have touched
[1:09:51] we would not have footprits in the sands
[1:09:53] of time
[1:09:55] that we could follow them
[1:09:58] those examples
[1:10:01] those great Servants of God
[1:10:09] I had the great privilege to meet the
[1:10:12] founding and know the founding pastor of
[1:10:13] this church
[1:10:17] a while back
[1:10:43] or I would come here to the United
[1:10:45] States
[1:10:48] it was always a great privilege and a
[1:10:52] great honor
[1:10:53] to see him
[1:10:57] and to see the way that God would use
[1:11:00] him
[1:11:02] you see the Simplicity of that man of
[1:11:05] God
[1:11:07] that's why his sons are just like him
[1:11:10] foreign
[1:11:21] I would not be here
[1:11:25] I don't like to get together with just
[1:11:26] anybody
[1:11:28] I don't make an alliance with just
[1:11:31] anybody
[1:11:33] I like to see the heart of the man first
[1:11:37] I'd like to discern his Spirit
[1:11:40] but their motives and objectives
[1:11:46] they're the same ones that I have
[1:11:50] and that is to help the people of God
[1:11:56] to be able to take the good news
[1:12:00] maybe help one or two Souls
[1:12:05] I say those are the ones of my team
[1:12:09] because that's the Holy Spirit
[1:12:12] the men of godinero they don't look for
[1:12:15] money they don't look profane
[1:12:21] they only look to be the servants and to
[1:12:24] serve but because
[1:12:27] eternal life is to live for others
[1:12:31] you don't think about yourself anymore
[1:12:35] that's the Holy Spirit
[1:12:37] when you have the Holy Spirit
[1:12:41] you don't just all the time think about
[1:12:43] yourself
[1:12:44] but you are thinking
[1:12:47] and which way you can help
[1:12:50] if you're a member of the church
[1:12:53] and you speak to the pastors
[1:12:57] what can I help
[1:12:59] is to to serve him
[1:13:02] uh
[1:13:06] may God bless various Brothers here in
[1:13:09] Las Cruces
[1:13:11] some of them knew I was coming here and
[1:13:15] they called me
[1:13:16] they said Brother David
[1:13:19] we are so happy you're going to be with
[1:13:21] us
[1:13:25] I'm just reporting to see it in any way
[1:13:27] I could help you yes and that is
[1:13:30] wonderful yeah you know there's one
[1:13:35] that calls me quite often
[1:13:38] he called me very early
[1:13:41] he's standing back there in the corner
[1:13:43] there I know that yeah brother Daniel
[1:13:45] the Brother David just checking if
[1:13:47] everything's okay
[1:13:53] I know my pastor has everything covered
[1:13:57] if anything that you need just give me a
[1:14:00] call yes and that is very good that is
[1:14:32] and that is eternal life
[1:14:42] each member of our body is so important
[1:14:48] each one of the Sons and Daughters of
[1:14:50] God that have been called
[1:14:52] to take for a work
[1:14:57] how simple or small that work is
[1:15:00] important
[1:15:04] less than nobody
[1:15:07] never feel better than anybody
[1:15:11] you're number one
[1:15:13] and what God has called you
[1:15:16] no one can do the work
[1:15:19] foreign
[1:16:16] last night
[1:16:20] that gives follow the beliefs
[1:16:23] we don't have to be following anything
[1:16:29] miracles
[1:16:34] of a true Christian
[1:16:57] which of your fingers doesn't do any
[1:17:01] good for you
[1:17:03] okay
[1:17:12] it's okay
[1:17:14] that's the teacher that's the teacher
[1:17:17] that's very good
[1:17:22] they're all important
[1:17:25] they are all so important
[1:17:28] and that is the way it is with the sons
[1:17:31] of God
[1:17:33] all of us are important
[1:17:38] the Devil Comes sometimes and says
[1:17:40] you're no good for nothing
[1:17:42] you don't know how to do anything
[1:17:45] and that is not true
[1:17:49] if God noticed us
[1:17:54] and before the foundation of the world
[1:17:56] he predestinated us
[1:17:59] and then he called us
[1:18:03] that we could come now and be manifested
[1:18:09] be justified and Sanctified
[1:18:12] and then filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:18:17] and positionally placed
[1:18:23] by revelation
[1:18:26] Dios
[1:18:30] God will tell us then what our position
[1:18:32] is
[1:18:34] that's what pastors are foreign
[1:18:57] we are your trainers or your coaches
[1:19:03] it says also when God calls a man he
[1:19:07] equips that man
[1:19:10] you're not you're just for any mistake
[1:19:13] or Reason
[1:19:15] God knew is
[1:19:18] God knew that Kelly Paris would be the
[1:19:21] pastor here
[1:19:25] brother Caleb cannot do all the work by
[1:19:27] himself
[1:19:28] and I don't care how tremendous he is
[1:19:32] but God
[1:19:36] he sent him a team of men from different
[1:19:40] with different gifts officials different
[1:19:44] offices
[1:19:46] different
[1:19:48] abilities
[1:19:51] that were going to help the ministry of
[1:19:54] the pastor
[1:19:55] and together form a team
[1:20:00] to not only just help the local church
[1:20:05] likewise internationally to help
[1:20:09] that is something so tremendous
[1:20:13] men that have been obedient
[1:20:17] and subject to the pasture
[1:20:23] they don't they're not running around
[1:20:25] all Loose by themselves
[1:20:29] a pastor he deserves respect
[1:20:32] yeah Pastor you should take him in the
[1:20:35] couch
[1:20:43] is
[1:20:44] that the lord gave me
[1:20:47] um
[1:20:48] when I hang up with you
[1:20:55] I like you I like to read this uh it's
[1:20:58] the New Testament Modern English
[1:20:59] Phillips
[1:21:02] Pastor gave it to me many years ago um
[1:21:06] and I want to read it in English were
[1:21:10] you at Okay so
[1:21:13] Philippians chapter one
[1:21:16] verse 27. versus
[1:21:33] chapter 1 verse 27.
[1:21:36] says but whatever happens make sure that
[1:21:38] your everyday life is worthy of the
[1:21:40] gospel of Christ
[1:21:47] so that whether I do come and see you or
[1:21:51] merely hear about you from a distance I
[1:21:53] may know that you are standing fast in
[1:21:56] the united spirit
[1:21:58] battling with a single line for the
[1:22:00] faith of the gospel and not carrying two
[1:22:03] straws for your innings Helio
[1:22:18] amen
[1:22:20] you you may be seated
[1:22:23] standing first in a United Spirit but I
[1:22:27] was unanimous
[1:22:38] the subject of Oneness was a subject
[1:22:41] they didn't give enough importance to
[1:23:04] because he knows what unity means okay
[1:23:09] realize
[1:24:10] Associates with God
[1:24:16] and they don't realize that a bad spirit
[1:24:18] is anointing them
[1:24:21] and instead of being one with their
[1:24:23] brothers
[1:24:26] instead of being one with the deacons
[1:24:29] instead of being one with your pastor is
[1:24:32] contrary they are contrary spirits
[1:24:40] anointing anointing anointing anointing
[1:24:43] anointing
[1:24:44] first they come here
[1:24:48] it's an anointing
[1:24:52] then it becomes an obsession
[1:24:55] then it becomes a possession
[1:25:01] that's why we must be so careful
[1:25:05] the scripture is so simple
[1:25:08] it's so simple
[1:25:11] I'm going to read it again I may know
[1:25:14] that you are standing fast in a United
[1:25:16] Spirit battling with a single mind for
[1:25:19] the faith of the gospel and not carrying
[1:25:22] two straws for your enemy amen verse 27
[1:25:25] again yes
[1:25:30] it's so difficult to do that
[1:25:33] Johnny is that so hard to do it's not
[1:25:37] hard
[1:25:39] on espanol okay verse 27 okay okay
[1:26:03] you know what the most successful teams
[1:26:06] are
[1:26:07] brother Tim brother Tim uh what sport
[1:26:10] did you play Chuck you were talking last
[1:26:12] night
[1:26:20] was it soccer or
[1:26:22] no no but but the one
[1:26:25] no America football
[1:26:34] you know what the most successful teams
[1:26:36] have
[1:26:38] they're not the ones that always have
[1:26:40] the best players
[1:26:43] in Europe there's a team
[1:26:47] that they have the best players you can
[1:26:50] have
[1:26:51] but they've never won
[1:26:55] you know why
[1:26:58] because among them
[1:27:01] I mean there's such a diversity of
[1:27:04] different things and there's Envy
[1:27:38] so that he doesn't get to go
[1:27:41] that he doesn't get the glory
[1:27:45] that's why that team will never win or
[1:27:48] never wins
[1:27:49] the best teams
[1:27:52] are those
[1:28:02] instruction there in Mexico
[1:28:05] and he says anybody can make up a team
[1:28:08] he says the typical
[1:28:11] that the members of that team
[1:28:14] that they can play together
[1:28:17] they can identify themselves
[1:28:20] and they can back up one another yes
[1:28:24] and to be in the same Spirit
[1:28:27] that's the most difficult thing
[1:28:36] whatever you want to call it
[1:28:39] it's tennis shoes or whatever he's
[1:28:41] wearing
[1:28:43] Diablo that's the work of the devil
[1:28:46] yesterday
[1:28:56] we should be a good Sportsman
[1:29:07] so much money
[1:29:09] there's goalkeepers that they earn
[1:29:12] Millions
[1:29:15] only just to block the ball so it
[1:29:17] doesn't go into the goal
[1:29:20] s there's a lot of money in the midst of
[1:29:23] all that is
[1:29:25] you know the devil likes football
[1:29:28] he likes to put in the gold himself
[1:29:32] he likes to put a goal against the
[1:29:35] pastoros but if there's good blockers
[1:29:38] they're not going to get not one bow

[1:31:58] dismissing themselves from one another
[1:31:59] they hug each other

[1:33:48] foreign
[1:33:55] what happened
[1:33:58] what happened
[1:34:01] where did the love go to
[1:34:05] then it wasn't the love of God
[1:34:14] something got in there
[1:34:17] a disagreement
[1:34:21] misunderstanding no say I don't know
[1:34:25] but why did they permit that
[1:34:28] is
[1:34:29] whatever it might have been
[1:34:32] that it would disunite them
[1:34:39] any disagreement there might be
[1:34:42] we have the word
[1:34:47] we have a pastor
[1:34:55] yeah
[1:34:56] sometimes the pastor doesn't even know
[1:35:01] and all of a sin says what happened with
[1:35:03] this sister and this sister
[1:35:07] what happened no
[1:35:09] I I don't know
[1:35:12] I don't know either
[1:35:16] that's that's bad
[1:35:19] we're not helping the unity
[1:35:24] and God desires
[1:35:27] for us to fight together
[1:35:29] that we stand together
[1:35:33] for the truth Brothers
[1:35:42] I would like to be Philippians chapter
[1:35:45] 2.
[1:35:47] verses verse 4. doing uh verse 12 to 4.
[1:35:51] 2-4 of Philippians yes
[1:35:54] now if you have known anything for
[1:35:57] Christ encouragement
[1:35:58] and love means anything to you
[1:36:01] if you have known something of the
[1:36:03] fellowship of his spirit and all that it
[1:36:05] means in kindness and deep sympathy to
[1:36:08] make my best hope for you come true
[1:36:11] live together in harmony live together
[1:36:14] in love as though you had only one mind
[1:36:17] and one Spirit between you
[1:36:22] it's verse uh one and two okay this
[1:36:26] second yeah if you'll be there for any
[1:36:29] consolation in Christ
[1:36:30] in English
[1:36:32] um
[1:36:58] and then
[1:37:00] and then the verse two did you read
[1:37:02] verse yeah I just read Mystique live
[1:37:04] together in harmony live together in
[1:37:06] love as though you had one mind and one
[1:37:08] Spirit between you
[1:37:12] dance
[1:37:20] and sometimes we don't feel that way
[1:37:23] we don't feel like
[1:37:26] happy
[1:37:35] happy
[1:37:43] if I don't feel happy
[1:37:47] something's been wrong with me
[1:37:50] um
[1:37:53] or I'm jealous
[1:38:17] I
[1:38:20] preached on a few of them
[1:38:31] there's thousands and thousands of
[1:38:33] demons
[1:38:43] and we are invaded by demons
[1:38:47] the prophet said those demons
[1:38:51] he said they were going to come against
[1:38:54] us
[1:38:56] he was going to try to divide us to
[1:38:58] separate us through here
[1:39:00] to destroy the headquarters of God
[1:39:03] this is the headquarters that's what the
[1:39:07] prophet said
[1:39:13] take insides with Jesus that's where he
[1:39:17] says it
[1:39:21] this is a point to advance
[1:39:28] what I'm talking about he's the military
[1:39:30] man
[1:39:31] this is a headquarters
[1:39:35] that's why God sends soldiers
[1:39:38] that's why he puts captains
[1:39:41] Pastor is a captain
[1:39:43] and he puts me
[1:39:45] to instruct you
[1:39:54] to gain more souls
[1:39:57] there's just a little time left
[1:40:01] last one comes in we're gonna leave this
[1:40:05] place
[1:40:11] if we're not ready
[1:40:14] the rapture's still going to go anywhere
[1:40:30] do people are worried about their deaths
[1:40:37] they want this they want that they want
[1:40:39] to get so much money or whatever
[1:40:41] it's nothing but vanities
[1:40:48] you should be worried about they're not
[1:40:50] worried about it at all
[1:40:52] because the spirit gets in there
[1:40:56] you're conformed I go to church
[1:41:00] I'm a good person
[1:41:02] I pay my taxes
[1:41:05] I help the Widow
[1:41:08] yes okay and that what does that mean
[1:41:10] that's that's fine
[1:41:13] but the question is
[1:41:16] do you have the Holy Spirit
[1:41:19] have you been born again
[1:41:22] as your nature truly been changed
[1:41:28] are there still things that you are
[1:41:30] struggling with
[1:41:32] and you haven't been able to overcome
[1:41:35] them yet
[1:41:43] and speaking on the Seal of God
[1:41:48] The Boxcar the train
[1:41:51] the Train the Box The Boxcar the train
[1:41:54] in general General Motors in in Mexico I
[1:41:59] work for General Motors 33 years there
[1:42:01] in Saltillo I worked at the engine and
[1:42:03] transmission plant
[1:42:17] once in a while I would like to go into
[1:42:19] the plants
[1:42:25] and I would like to see how they would
[1:42:27] get ready everything to put the motor
[1:42:29] together prepare the ship prepare the
[1:42:32] shipments of the motors of the engines
[1:42:34] the motors he
[1:42:52] until you see that everything is in
[1:42:54] order
[1:42:55] he's speaking of the heart
[1:42:59] I will go there into the plant
[1:43:05] I will put in their place the motors and
[1:43:09] their
[1:43:10] in the robot in the real box
[1:43:37] the north part of the United States many
[1:43:39] different places
[1:43:42] and not everything was put in order
[1:43:45] the movement of the train
[1:43:48] is
[1:43:53] against things and it would damage the
[1:43:55] motors
[1:43:57] the supervisors
[1:44:01] see that everything's in its place
[1:44:04] everything very well located
[1:44:09] if you see that the locks were closed
[1:44:12] and everything was ready
[1:44:19] then he will put a seal I'm sealed
[1:44:28] it's the same in the spiritual brother
[1:44:43] that are not right
[1:44:49] but God can take that away from your
[1:44:51] brothers
[1:45:03] he can take any bad habit away from here
[1:45:08] whatever bad Spirit
[1:45:14] sometimes we inherit espiritus Spirits
[1:45:18] they are inherited
[1:45:24] one day she asked the prophet
[1:45:27] says
[1:45:29] I already got baptized
[1:45:33] I do the best that I can
[1:45:36] Christiana I try to be a good Christian
[1:45:40] that I have a spirit
[1:45:43] that I haven't been able to get rid of
[1:45:45] it
[1:45:46] and he asked her what
[1:45:50] foreign
[1:45:53] I am stubborn
[1:46:03] I hope there's no stubborn sisters here
[1:46:06] yes
[1:46:10] very loving obedient subject
[1:46:17] yes
[1:46:18] amen no no no
[1:46:27] you know what the prophet answered her
[1:46:32] Mana he said sister
[1:46:36] under discernment
[1:46:40] he says God showed me
[1:46:43] that spirit is not yours
[1:46:46] they say this is
[1:46:51] if you go back in your genealogy your
[1:46:54] family
[1:46:56] you had a
[1:47:00] great grandfather
[1:47:03] that he was so stubborn yes Espiritu and
[1:47:07] that spirit said
[1:47:09] came down to your grandparents
[1:47:12] then he came down to your father
[1:47:15] and then when you were born
[1:47:18] It Came Upon you
[1:47:22] but he says go to the altario surrender
[1:47:26] to God
[1:47:28] and don't pay any attention to that
[1:47:32] [Music]
[1:47:41] and it will never bother you again
[1:47:44] if you want to come ignore
[1:47:47] ignore it don't pay any attention to it
[1:47:55] oh this is
[1:47:57] you say why do I struggle so much with
[1:47:59] this you might ask I don't want that
[1:48:04] yes but if we can go back
[1:48:08] somebody had it
[1:48:12] there was another sister
[1:48:17] with thunder and lightning and with rain
[1:48:20] yeah
[1:48:25] and she would get so nervous
[1:48:28] in such a bad way yeah yeah
[1:48:32] for me can you pray for me
[1:48:35] I have a bad Spirit
[1:48:38] he says something
[1:48:53] ugly comes into me I don't understand it
[1:48:56] and brother Branham
[1:48:59] when he was praying for her before he
[1:49:03] prayed he waited
[1:49:06] and God shot him
[1:49:09] okay
[1:49:11] her father
[1:49:13] when he was young
[1:49:17] he was on riding his horse
[1:49:21] he was going up into the mountains
[1:49:25] and a great storm came down and he got
[1:49:30] scared
[1:50:00] experience he had was that great storm
[1:50:04] he says let us pray yes and that is
[1:50:08] going to leave you
[1:50:09] the
[1:50:47] those pigs died
[1:50:49] but the spirits
[1:50:53] they pass from one generation to another
[1:50:55] generation Los mismos Diablos the same
[1:50:58] Devils
[1:50:59] the same Spirits
[1:51:01] the same Pharisees
[1:51:05] that were in the time of Jesus
[1:51:08] they're here today also
[1:51:12] it's the same Spirits
[1:51:19] criticize the word yes
[1:51:22] they only want to see mistakes
[1:51:26] you see the negative things
[1:51:30] those Spirits have not died brethren
[1:51:34] OS but also of the good spirits
[1:51:38] that were in that time
[1:51:41] that Holy people
[1:51:43] the people that were consecrated
[1:51:48] that also passed from one generation to
[1:51:51] another generation
[1:51:53] we are the children of the prophets
[1:51:56] we are Kings and Priests
[1:51:59] we are the people of God foreign
[1:52:35] you have to be more spiritual
[1:52:57] that's the most beautiful thing
[1:53:00] the devil can imitate any gifts
[1:53:04] but not the Divine love no puede brother
[1:53:08] Tim you cannot do that
[1:53:10] he would be a hypocrite
[1:53:14] you can see that right away
[1:53:16] foreign
[1:53:49] foreign
[1:54:03] but the heart we do not know I know
[1:54:06] Henry brother Henry
[1:54:10] there's a good Mexican chains
[1:54:14] Columbia has some real good ones also we
[1:54:16] have maybe haven't heard them yet
[1:54:18] they also have good sayings in Colombia
[1:54:21] it's true we see the faces
[1:54:30] should be clean
[1:54:46] the holy spirit is here
[1:54:49] he can come
[1:54:52] that great sweeper that he has
[1:54:56] he can take out anything
[1:54:59] whatever anointing that whatever it is
[1:55:15] a little bit of time left he's going to
[1:55:19] be burnt
[1:55:20] together with his angels
[1:55:24] together with all of them that are doing
[1:55:27] bad things
[1:55:34] the word I know
[1:55:37] tears
[1:55:42] that are causing divisions among the
[1:55:45] people of God
[1:55:47] they're going to be burned
[1:55:49] they're going to be burnt
[1:55:52] I don't want to be burnt
[1:55:58] give Robert just your little finger
[1:56:00] before
[1:56:02] it hurts does it hurt a lot
[1:56:06] of you no no you don't know
[1:56:11] God did not call us for that
[1:56:17] service and handmaidens of the Lord
[1:56:20] to be a United people
[1:56:23] to back up the work
[1:56:25] to pray for one another
[1:56:28] to help one another
[1:56:35] for which God called US foreign
[1:57:08] and what does that have to do with it
[1:57:15] rivalry
[1:57:21] there are many rivalries
[1:57:25] you should not be rivalries Among Us
[1:57:32] we need more of the love of God
[1:57:35] in our lives
[1:57:42] it's like to read this letter
[1:57:44] foreign
[1:58:22] [Music]
[1:58:24] will also collide with misunderstanding
[1:58:27] and Prejudice of the in the world
[1:58:41] and I ask you to guard the letters as
[1:58:44] long as necessary years decades until
[1:58:46] Society is events enough to accept what
[1:58:49] I will explain below
[1:59:00] identification
[1:59:11] there is an extremely powerful force
[1:59:13] that so far science has not found a
[1:59:16] formal explanation to you it is a force
[1:59:19] that includes and governs all others and
[1:59:21] is even be behind in any phenomenon
[1:59:24] operating in the universe and has not
[1:59:26] yet been identified by us
[1:59:29] is
[2:00:02] when scientists looked for a unified
[2:00:04] theory of the universe they forgot the
[2:00:06] most powerful unseen Force love is light
[2:00:09] that enlightens those who give and
[2:00:11] receive it love is gravity because it
[2:00:13] makes some people feel attracted to
[2:00:15] others love is power because it
[2:00:17] multiplies the best we have and allows
[2:00:19] Humanity not to be extinguished in their
[2:00:21] blind selfishness love unfolds and
[2:00:24] reveals for love we live and die Love Is
[2:00:27] God and God is love
[2:00:30] celebrity
[2:00:56] the this Force explains everything and
[2:00:59] gives meaning to life this is the
[2:01:01] variable that we have ignored for too
[2:01:03] long maybe because we are afraid of love
[2:01:07] because it is the only energy in the
[2:01:09] universe that man has not learned to
[2:01:12] drive at will
[2:01:15] to give visibility to love
[2:01:17] it
[2:01:22] and I have made a simple substitution in
[2:01:25] the most famous equation
[2:01:29] or
[2:01:51] equals mc2 we accept that the energy to
[2:01:54] heal the world can be obtained to love
[2:01:57] multiplied by the speed of light squared
[2:01:59] we arrive at the conclusion that love is
[2:02:02] the most powerful force there is because
[2:02:04] it has no limits
[2:02:07] foreign
[2:02:35] in use in control of other forces of the
[2:02:39] universe that have turned against us it
[2:02:41] is urgent that we nourish ourselves with
[2:02:43] another kind of energy if we want our
[2:02:46] species to survive if we had to find a
[2:02:48] meaning in life if we want to save the
[2:02:51] world and every
[2:02:53] sent in it being that it happens that
[2:02:56] love is the one and only answer he says
[2:03:03] perhaps we are not yet ready to make a
[2:03:06] bomb of Love
[2:03:11] is
[2:03:16] powerful enough to entirely destroy hate
[2:03:19] and selfishness and greed that devastate
[2:03:22] the planets
[2:03:32] however each individual carries within
[2:03:34] themselves a small powerful generator of
[2:03:36] Love whose energy is waiting to be
[2:03:39] released
[2:03:54] when we learn to give and receive this
[2:03:57] Universal energy my dear daughter we
[2:04:00] will have affirmed that the love
[2:04:02] conquers all it is able to transcend
[2:04:04] everything and anything because the love
[2:04:07] is the Quint essence of Essences of life
[2:04:12] is
[2:04:31] deeply regret not having been able to
[2:04:34] express what is in my heart which has
[2:04:36] quite quietly beaten foreign
[2:04:42] it's too late to apologize but at this
[2:04:44] time as a relative I need to tell you
[2:04:46] that I love you and and thank you that I
[2:04:49] have reached this ultimate answer to

[2:05:06] we need more of God
[2:05:12] this is
[2:05:15] that we have got
[2:05:18] This Love amen
[2:05:23] where is

[2:36:17] Isaiah 6.
[2:36:20] verses one through eight say yes in the
[2:36:23] year that King uziah died I saw also the
[2:36:26] Lord sitting upon a throne
[2:36:28] high and lifted up and his train filled
[2:36:31] the temple
[2:36:32] above its stood the seraphims each one
[2:36:35] had six wings
[2:36:36] with Twain he covered his face and with
[2:36:38] Wayne he covered his feet and with Twain
[2:36:41] he did fly
[2:36:42] and one Cried unto another and said holy
[2:36:45] holy holy is the Lord of hosts
[2:36:48] the whole earth is full of his glory
[2:36:50] and the post of the door moved at the
[2:36:54] voice of him that cried in the house was
[2:36:56] filled with smoke
[2:36:58] I want you to I'm going to read from
[2:37:01] verse 5 to verse 8 and then you can read
[2:37:02] those also okay
[2:37:04] then said I woe is me
[2:37:07] for I am undone because I am a man of
[2:37:09] unclean lips and dwell in the midst of a
[2:37:12] people of unclean lips or mine eyes have
[2:37:15] seen the king the Lord of hosts
[2:37:17] is
[2:37:29] then flew one of the seraphims unto me
[2:37:32] having a live coal in his hand which he
[2:37:34] had taken with the tongs from off the
[2:37:36] altar
[2:37:38] foreign
[2:37:44] and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo
[2:37:46] this hath touched my thy lips and thine
[2:37:49] iniquity is taken away and thy sin
[2:37:52] purged
[2:37:53] he is
[2:38:02] also I heard the voice of the Lord
[2:38:04] saying whom shall I send and who will go
[2:38:07] for us then said I hear am I send me
[2:38:12] in
[2:38:18] a
[2:38:19] Queens
[2:38:23] Mark the 16th chapter
[2:38:27] verse 15 through 18.
[2:38:32] and he said unto them go ye into all the
[2:38:34] world and preach the gospel to every
[2:38:37] creature
[2:38:41] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[2:38:44] be saved but he that believeth not shall
[2:38:46] be damned
[2:38:56] and these signs shall follow them that
[2:38:59] believe in my name they shall cast out
[2:39:01] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[2:39:09] they shall take up serpents and if they
[2:39:11] drink any daily thing they sh it shall
[2:39:13] not hurt them they shall lay hands on
[2:39:16] the sick and they shall
[2:39:19] recovering
[2:39:24] I'm going to ask if if the ministry
[2:39:26] would come at this time
[2:39:30] oh God
[2:39:35] even if you're not from church here
[2:39:39] would you help David
[2:39:58] in the message ordination
[2:40:02] says that's exactly the way they did it
[2:40:05] in the Bible times
[2:40:08] was lay hands upon them
[2:40:10] in ordination they laid hands upon the
[2:40:15] deacons
[2:40:16] they put them in the church
[2:40:18] everything was by the lean on of hands
[2:40:23] not signing up a bunch of papers and
[2:40:26] joining a certain Creed no Fernando
[2:40:28] papelles
[2:40:30] or something like that or they laid
[2:40:33] hands on
[2:40:34] and turned him loose in the Holy Spirit
[2:40:40] and let him go
[2:40:42] amen amen God led him in the way he
[2:40:47] wants to
[2:40:48] that's all that's the way we believe in
[2:40:51] doing it
[2:40:54] if you got a commission from God
[2:40:57] you got an ordination from God to do
[2:41:00] these things
[2:41:02] when we lay hands on them
[2:41:05] we aren't giving them their gifts we
[2:41:10] aren't giving them their Ministry
[2:41:12] that was all already placed by God
[2:41:16] in them from before the foundation of
[2:41:18] the
[2:41:24] to sanction them
[2:41:28] because we have recognized that there is
[2:41:30] a gift there
[2:41:32] so they might ask you four brothers
[2:41:36] you'll get a card of credentials
[2:41:40] or a certificate to put on your wall
[2:41:43] certificate
[2:41:44] we'll probably will give you one of
[2:41:46] those
[2:41:47] but that's not your credentials
[2:41:51] your credentials is a life worthy of the
[2:41:55] Gospel
