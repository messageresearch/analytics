[11:22] ready I I want to get
[11:26] ready I want to get nice and comfortable
[11:31] tonight's going to be something
[11:36] different the scripture that we
[11:41] read it cannot be written read
[11:47] correctly unless I would have taken that
[11:53] off here I am
[11:57] brother
[11:59] I'll just now I'm going to read
[12:02] correctly this
[12:04] scripture now I feel like I'm
[12:08] ready before we read this scripture
[12:13] again I want you to understand the
[12:18] context when and
[12:22] how that our Lord and savior said these
[12:27] words
[12:30] he did not speak these words in a
[12:31] synagogue or in a
[12:35] temple he Jesus did not say these words
[12:37] in the midst of a big
[12:40] Campa in the midst of a multitude no
[12:43] no these words that Jesus
[12:47] said he said these words in a specific
[12:50] place and they were
[12:54] directed to a special
[12:57] people and a specific
[13:02] people Jesus
[13:06] was he was in a place in a room with his
[13:16] disciples these
[13:19] words he he had kept these
[13:23] words and he could not pronounce
[13:27] them until he sat
[13:30] down at a
[13:34] table and there were his 11
[13:38] friends the ones that he had
[13:41] chosen Judas was no longer
[13:45] there but so I want you
[13:49] tonight I want to bring such a big
[13:53] table where we can all sit
[13:56] down and we can see Jesus
[14:02] before saying
[14:06] this I want you to say brother Diego I'm
[14:08] already sitting at that
[14:11] table and now are you sitting at that
[14:15] table now you can see the other 10
[14:19] disciples and you can see
[14:24] Jesus there in that
[14:27] intimacy
[14:31] now God wants to speak to your
[14:34] soul Jesus said these
[14:41] words these words have I spoken that in
[14:44] me you might have
[14:48] peace who is Jesus speaking
[14:55] to in the world you will have affliction
[14:57] or tribulation
[15:00] young
[15:01] people Jesus knows
[15:06] everything and he was telling us that in
[15:08] the world we would have
[15:10] affliction the word
[15:13] Affliction it's something where you you
[15:15] feel like you've been misled or
[15:18] deceive
[15:22] it that somebody has has been a traitor
[15:24] to
[15:27] you
[15:29] that means we would be hurt in our
[15:35] emotions to such a way that our friends
[15:37] would deceive
[15:39] us and and and they they would turn
[15:42] their backs on
[15:45] us and Jesus knew how you and I would
[15:49] feel he was telling
[15:52] us in the world you will have
[15:56] affliction but don't fear
[15:59] because
[16:00] I have overcome the
[16:03] world these
[16:08] words Jesus said these words to his
[16:11] intimate to his
[16:14] disciples to his
[16:17] [Applause]
[16:18] friends when I read these
[16:23] words I have to read chapter
[16:27] 13 chapter
[16:31] 14 and chapters 15 and
[16:35] 16 and even chapter
[16:40] 17 because all of these things happen in
[16:42] this one
[16:43] place
[16:45] Jesus with his
[16:48] friends with his
[16:50] disciples telling
[16:52] them that in the world you will have
[16:56] affliction and the world there's deceit
[16:58] and there's
[17:00] pain but don't be
[17:03] fearful because in him they would find
[17:07] peace therefore young
[17:12] people sometimes when we feel
[17:18] hurt and we feel like our friends our
[17:22] parents they they let us
[17:24] down we get
[17:27] frustrated
[17:29] and we begin to get
[17:31] depressed those
[17:34] emotions they don't have a
[17:37] place in a
[17:40] Christian because Jesus said these words
[17:44] he says
[17:46] never well I will never leave
[17:51] you I will never abandon
[17:54] you ge two
[17:57] words that Jesus
[17:59] used to
[18:02] to what to
[18:05] leave and to
[18:09] abandon Jesus when he was on the
[18:13] cross he said
[18:17] father why have you forsaken
[18:22] me you know what the word forsake
[18:26] means it's what it's when somebody could
[18:29] help
[18:33] you it's when you you confi in somebody
[18:36] that has the capacity and the recourses
[18:38] to help
[18:41] you and he turns his back on you and
[18:44] leaves he abandons you he forsakes
[18:49] you
[18:51] Jesus the son of
[18:53] God when he was on the
[18:56] cross he took your sin
[18:59] he took your sin he took my
[19:04] sin for that
[19:06] cause the
[19:09] father forsakes him the
[19:13] father because God is
[19:16] Holy and there's no communion between
[19:19] Holiness and
[19:20] sin
[19:22] Jesus being
[19:25] innocent he had never committed sin
[19:29] for you and for
[19:31] me he became
[19:34] sin and God forsook
[19:39] him but he tells you and me I will
[19:44] never I will
[19:46] never will never psake
[19:50] you our parents can maybe let us down
[19:54] we're
[19:57] hum our brothers in the flesh can let us
[20:00] down our
[20:03] friends they they can like turn their
[20:05] backs on us sometimes but there's
[20:08] one that promised that he would
[20:12] never abandon you that he would
[20:16] never forsake
[20:20] you isn't he
[20:26] worthy to receive all our wor ship and
[20:28] all of our
[20:31] confidence our our confidence
[20:33] friends it should not
[20:39] be in the in the
[20:42] people when I speak of
[20:49] confidence sometimes we we give oursel
[20:53] completely to a
[20:55] person and and and when when they turn
[20:58] their back on
[21:00] us we remain without any
[21:03] foundation that's what I'm referring
[21:06] to we have to
[21:09] confide
[21:10] totally in him that
[21:15] promise that he would never abandon us
[21:18] that he would never forsake
[21:20] us we are young
[21:24] people and we have a
[21:27] testimony for this
[21:30] world God
[21:32] confides in you and you and you and
[21:38] you that
[21:41] you will be able to maintain your
[21:45] testimony because you're not going to be
[21:48] alone he would be with
[21:52] you because he would never forsake
[21:56] you your friends can put you to the
[21:59] side your friends can reject
[22:03] you even maybe your parents could reject
[22:06] you but there's
[22:10] one that will never abandon
[22:14] you I want you to go with
[22:22] me first
[22:26] Chronicles
[22:28] 1 Chronicles
[22:55] 28:9 I believe I have your attention
[23:04] now we can know the Bible from cover to
[23:08] cover we can know all the
[23:12] message and go to
[23:20] hell what is the thing that guarantees
[23:23] us eternal
[23:26] life
[23:28] it's not just to know the
[23:31] Bible because we've got to know the
[23:35] Bible but brother Benham told
[23:38] us that eternal
[23:40] life is to know
[23:45] him him him he is the the interested
[23:49] person he's the one that wrote the
[23:54] Bible why wouldn't we want to know him
[23:59] the one that said he would never forsake
[24:04] you the one that said he would be with
[24:07] you the one that said he would walk with
[24:10] you when they reject
[24:13] you they're not rejecting
[24:15] you they're rejecting
[24:19] me he says well he doesn't like the
[24:23] women because he doesn't flirt with the
[24:26] women
[24:28] they're not discriminating against
[24:32] him they're discriminating against him
[24:34] that is
[24:37] walking because he has an
[24:41] objective to be obedient to the one that
[24:44] has called
[24:49] him when she walks down the
[24:52] street and the people make
[24:56] fun
[24:58] there goes that one with the
[24:59] dress look at that
[25:02] hair they're not making fun of
[25:06] her they're making fun of the one that
[25:08] is walking with
[25:12] her because he's speaking of
[25:17] those that which the world is not worthy
[25:19] of
[25:21] them what a
[25:24] privilege what a
[25:26] privilege
[25:28] not just to know
[25:30] him but to live for
[25:35] him stand for
[25:40] him as you stand for
[25:43] him one day him over
[25:46] there will stand for
[25:51] you the King
[25:55] David oh I love so much that that
[25:57] character of
[25:59] David because he was a
[26:03] man that knew the heart of
[26:07] God I love that so
[26:11] much she knows what I
[26:16] like and when she does the things that I
[26:20] like she doesn't only have my
[26:24] attention she has everything that is in
[26:26] me
[26:30] because she pleases
[26:32] me now
[26:36] David he he he put so much effort into
[26:39] knowing the heart of
[26:43] God you know what David found
[26:50] out that God loved one
[26:54] thing is that we would worship Him
[27:00] you didn't get
[27:01] it
[27:03] David found
[27:04] out that God
[27:06] loved that they would worship
[27:10] Him brother Bram
[27:12] said and God loves for
[27:15] you because
[27:17] God cannot be
[27:19] God if he's not
[27:22] worship if I don't worship
[27:25] him he's still
[27:28] God but he is waiting
[27:31] on that his
[27:33] children that his
[27:35] daughters that would worship
[27:38] him and that pleases
[27:41] him when that
[27:43] worship gets to
[27:48] him as my
[27:51] wife she has my
[27:53] attention when she pleases
[27:55] me when you
[27:58] please
[28:00] God worshiping
[28:02] him you have the attention of
[28:06] God you know that
[28:10] David he was the only King in the
[28:14] Bible that never lost not even one
[28:19] battle brother Diego what is that have
[28:21] to do with
[28:23] it
[28:25] we are in a battle
[28:28] we get sick we have problems
[28:33] situations we
[28:36] know the success that David
[28:39] had
[28:43] imagine how old
[28:49] are
[28:52] Imagine to live all your
[28:56] life and all of your
[28:58] problems and all your
[29:01] sickness in every situation you would go
[29:06] through vict going to Victory to Victory
[29:08] to Victory to
[29:10] Victory
[29:13] imagine can you get that a hold of
[29:16] that he has a a
[29:19] smile that's the way David
[29:21] smile there was no
[29:24] enemy that could stand in front of David
[29:32] when hundreds of soldiers would come
[29:33] against
[29:35] David David would not look at the number
[29:38] how many of they
[29:41] were David would worship
[29:44] God and God would only send one
[29:49] angel that would fight the fights of
[29:52] David
[29:55] imagine that God
[29:58] would send an
[30:01] angel that he would fight your fights
[30:04] that angel would fight your
[30:06] fights what kind of life would we
[30:11] live
[30:20] then yeah he's going to say I'm going to
[30:22] get draw a pathetic picture for you
[30:26] now
[30:27] when brother benam speaks about
[30:30] that is is how
[30:33] Jesus is outside of the
[30:36] church of his own
[30:39] church his own
[30:41] business they left him
[30:44] outside that's a pathetic picture
[30:48] brother now I'm going to bring a
[30:50] pathetic
[30:52] picture to see a young
[30:54] man to see a young person
[30:58] sad
[31:02] frustrated
[31:05] depression all those
[31:08] symptoms that's a pathetic
[31:10] picture when
[31:14] God he hasn't only given us just the
[31:18] Bible but he has sent us a
[31:23] prophet he sent a
[31:26] prophet he sent a prophet to you he sent
[31:30] a prophet to
[31:31] you William Mariam
[31:34] brandham with a
[31:37] revelation
[31:40] then you see this pathetic
[31:45] picture
[31:47] what do not be a part of that
[31:50] picture because of
[31:54] that we're going to erase that pathetic
[31:56] picture
[31:58] and
[32:00] today now we're going to
[32:04] write the history
[32:07] correctly come
[32:12] here
[32:15] Li stand
[32:18] here look over
[32:24] there when the book of the life of
[32:27] sister Eliza is
[32:29] read it's going to be read like
[32:34] this Ela lived the life the Victor and
[32:37] Victor and Victor and Victoria and
[32:39] Victor and Victor and victory and
[32:41] victory and victory and victory and
[32:45] victory she never knew what defeat
[32:50] was because she found out how to please
[32:55] God and God B all of her
[32:58] battles and that book will be
[33:02] [Applause]
[33:08] closed let's go to our last
[33:10] scripture it's in
[33:17] Proverbs Proverbs 8 verse
[33:24] 17 it's us
[33:30] that are going to
[33:32] write how our history is going to be
[33:37] read and when there is a
[33:42] problem what when Satan sends you a
[33:50] cancer when Satan sends you a destroyed
[33:54] life you're going to look him right in
[33:56] the face
[33:58] you going to say
[34:00] Satan that's not what I want for my
[34:03] life and I'm going to erase
[34:06] it because I'm a daughter of God because
[34:09] I'm a Son of God and my
[34:12] history my
[34:15] story you're not going to write
[34:18] it my
[34:20] story it's going to be written like
[34:25] this Proverbs 8
[34:29] 17 I love those that love
[34:40] me and I found of those that look for me
[34:45] early I love those that love
[34:49] me you know how David
[34:55] prayed
[35:00] David would
[35:03] say oh

[35:38] Lord give me to drink of that
[35:41] water you're so
[35:44] wonderful David would worship him he
[35:47] would worship
