[41:59] Bible God calls his prophet steagle a
[42:01] jury realized over in the Bible we find
[42:04] and now count for that we're promised
[42:06] that in the last days now he likes his
[42:08] promise to eagle he calls himself eagle
[42:11] he's a great Jehovah Eagle he's able to
[42:14] achieve to himself a bride was going to
[42:18] you in the life states be able to get a
[42:20] bride that with a ministry that's so
[42:23] exactly that like a man in his wife
[42:26] becomes one man way Jehovah gets his
[42:30] people like him that he lives in his
[42:33] people they are one it fulfills the

[50:19] had an aviator you know yea though this
[50:21] was back in the 1860s mr. Fuentes they
[50:25] went up in a gas balloon went on the
[50:27] noon and don't glow or they gas and
[50:29] there was a couple of reasons why they
[50:30] went up he have you not a son is por que
[50:32] sube I don't number one they wanted to
[50:34] break the record hey on current record
[50:37] for for the highest ascent of a gas
[50:40] balloon
[50:41] as and in Sierra Leone globally gasps
[50:43] and then they were also up there to
[50:45] record to record some observations of of
[50:48] the weather
[50:50] yay Tamika Daniel's gonna run a dimple
[50:52] and come on I think at the time it was
[50:54] like the record was like twenty two
[50:56] thousand nine hundred feet or something
[50:58] like that in the air.you record this we
[51:00] didn't like was he well as they began to
[51:03] ascend emit a thousand personas and
[51:05] there they they got to that level in I
[51:08] don't know anything and and they
[51:10] couldn't go no higher yeah yeah no
[51:12] matter what what's happening he looked
[51:15] around they're looking at all the stuff
[51:18] they brought him you know they're either
[51:20] glaze big old machines that they brought
[51:22] do these observations everyone else but
[51:25] I set up set up a steel and after a
[51:27] while they realized they were too heavy
[51:29] to go any higher machines that they that
[51:34] they are taken up there is a máquina
[51:36] yucky all right well all they could do
[51:37] was sorry whoever's down there but this
[51:42] fence entire in Turkey they started
[51:43] throwing stuff off the balloon and
[51:45] persona things that way did the blue
[51:47] down Chris's killer little by little
[51:50] they're gonna slap again logo on persona
[51:53] send their Pro till they got to a then
[51:55] record-breaking 37,000 feet up into the
[51:59] air that's the case here on that link
[52:00] they see at the mill PS yeah but the
[52:03] problem was in Peru Lima as they began
[52:05] to ascend in intercept is honest in
[52:07] there and and and the media
[52:09] meteorologist began to put down his
[52:12] observations yet come serve our yes
[52:14] yellows upon tests he realized that that
[52:16] in different different at different
[52:18] heights it's a joke winter care as if it
[52:21] interests and to dance he realized that
[52:22] the wind speeds are different that right

[53:12] they were freezing to death one of them
[53:14] passed out mysticum who knows my own and

[53:53] this time I'm preparin Mantinea you know
[53:55] as I was as I was reading this and
[53:57] looking at this story is the story I
[54:00] thought about how tremendous it is in
[54:02] the spiritual even if you have yoga
[54:03] Tantra min because everything that goes
[54:05] on in the natural we understand is a
[54:07] type of the spiritual porque lo que pasa
[54:09] not relent and demos and I asked the
[54:11] question this this morning are we really
[54:13] prepared to to ascend into the heavens
[54:17] prepare us for us and we're really ready
[54:20] to to fight the good fight the higher
[54:23] you go the more Devils there are entry
[54:26] must move it must a more sort of higher
[54:28] you go it there must be no more winds of
[54:30] doctrines you run into the guard must be
[54:32] higher you go the colder it becomes it
[54:35] must do we must allow us and that's why
[54:37] the Bible says that many many are called
[54:40] few are chosen this is Lavinia Corazon
[54:42] muchos on your mouse key focuses and a
[54:44] man said one day many are cold and few
[54:46] are frozen in the phenomena rest which

[1:14:31] ha I think brother brother Jerry for
[1:14:35] this the aggressions in the manager he
[1:14:37] knows about this more than I do
[1:14:38] it's how a mucho mas this Tokyo but
[1:14:40] after I preached that there is a
[1:14:42] critique and she was excited and I
[1:14:43] reckon more videos I did you

[1:15:32] and becomes energized en esta bien a
[1:15:35] bein you know the key message on
[1:15:37] that on Oprah Cattlemen's Hockaday so or

[1:15:50] excited that you're stuck in con movie
[1:15:53] knowing this happens it's under store a
[1:15:55] continued excited electron the electron
[1:15:58] Caribbean movie though moves from its
[1:16:01] ground state somwhere del Estero in la
[1:16:04] tierra understand I don't know about you
[1:16:08] know stage stairs I can't even go
[1:16:10] anymore that's too much for me
[1:16:11] yeah so mucho para minute when she
[1:16:13] commits ground state and where they list
[1:16:15] all around right can it get the NetBIOS
[1:16:18] from the ground state the - is tell it
[1:16:21] put on your your spiritual caps this
[1:16:24] more than sucrose because the only way
[1:16:26] we got a move from our ground stage sous
[1:16:33] vide account he said it moves from its
[1:16:34] ground states and where this is the
[1:16:36] theater normal position around the
[1:16:38] nucleus who pushes your normal another
[1:16:40] the nucleus and it moves into an excited
[1:16:43] state is then where our nest our must
[1:16:45] con move either a position farther from
[1:16:48] the nucleus una posición mass liquid
[1:16:50] game look like electron yes to say
[1:16:52] electronic a tank on mojitos
[1:16:54] amidst the energizing energy
[1:16:56] me 10 assign their here as photons that
[1:16:59] come off photons of visible light when I
[1:17:02] loosely Sibley
[1:17:03] that's the way light is produced ice is
[1:17:06] kamala losses producing about now the
[1:17:08] natural types the spiritual matter LT
[1:17:11] physical knows P so a light it says
[1:17:13] loose is made up of little packets of
[1:17:16] energy called photons it doesn't lose
[1:17:18] that compost at least as well says the
[1:17:19] photons and most of these photons those
[1:17:23] photons are produced when the atoms in
[1:17:25] an object heat up some procedures
[1:17:27] control us at the most Akali intend not
[1:17:29] cold
[1:17:30] no it will get it in a cold state no
[1:17:32] Laura see Western own s towelette was
[1:17:33] heat excites the electrons porque lo
[1:17:36] caliente become waving that are inside
[1:17:38] the atoms contentos de l'otan and they
[1:17:41] gain extra energy receiving and they're
[1:17:43] here extra this energy extra energy is
[1:17:46] the extractor here is then released as a
[1:17:49] photon river sultana como photon or a
[1:17:52] visible light of human ellos be simply
[1:17:55] now unless we receive what al menos que
[1:17:58] receive almost a stimulation of the
[1:18:00] revelation less stimulus you de la
[1:18:02] revolucion you're gonna stay close to
[1:18:07] the nucleus there occurs circuit our
[1:18:09] cell nucleus you're gonna stay
[1:18:10] earthbound Rockapella Tierra right but
[1:18:13] when the Holy Ghost and fire begins to
[1:18:15] move and from the dispute was not the
[1:18:17] focus I'm aware it it excites the the
[1:18:19] the different parts of the body of
[1:18:22] Christ is that como eres partisan what
[1:18:24] does it do okay look at it excites the
[1:18:26] body where else particles parts of the
[1:18:28] body
[1:18:29] suspect is l1 and then what does it do
[1:18:31] it begins to produce light is the
[1:18:33] suppose you lose too many people cold
[1:18:38] which I'll get there leather because
[1:18:39] they're trying to get up into space
[1:18:41] something they gotta space and they're
[1:18:43] not prepared to live or be there
[1:18:46] why don't we gotta do we gotta come back
[1:18:48] down mascara sour listen we gotta guess
[1:18:50] the necessary thing don't ask us on this
[1:18:53] so we can go back up but I can take this
[1:18:55] is in there okay we can learn to live in
[1:18:57] heavenly please every Loretta still
[1:18:59] Astellas this is what we're after today
[1:19:01] yes to look at numbers together look
[1:19:03] Jerry for that gracias hermano gee
[1:19:05] that's why the rapture is a revelation
[1:19:08] what's the scale Raptor soon ah
[1:19:10] because it's the stimulation of the
[1:19:12] revelation that will give us our flight
[1:19:16] another a loco guarantee watch the
[1:19:22] revelation now mark 16 Marcos DC says
[1:19:26] I'll just read it real quick in English

[1:19:47] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:19:50] trying to excite it and Otakon movin is
[1:19:54] trying to excite all these atoms atomos
[1:19:57] he's trying to excite the body and where
[1:19:58] it flows she can put her into action to
[1:20:01] move Patapon lnx this is her submission
[1:20:04] this is what gets her going it's looking
[1:20:07] like oh man there's nothing that'll get
[1:20:08] a church-going missionary mind I'm sorry
[1:20:18] but I'm running you over these signs
[1:20:20] shall follow them that believe

[1:20:38] they shall lay their hands on the sick
[1:20:41] and they shall recover deep intense
[1:20:43] monotheism so then after the Lord had
[1:20:46] spoken unto them in his Pacific as near
[1:20:48] listen lo he was received up into heaven
[1:20:51] where is he villainous yellow and sat on

[1:21:10] come I saw servants to church come on I
[1:21:12] want you to get this once again he's
[1:21:15] speaking the Great Commission

[1:21:28] brother Bram says and after he finishes
[1:21:30] speaking that is it get there Emilia
[1:21:32] bloody honkers gravitation and there
[1:21:36] under his feet yeah but what's the spear
[1:21:38] there becomes light under his feet now
[1:21:40] IV I lose the rock for this PS what is
[1:21:43] the like a salute it is the revelation
[1:21:45] of the word stimulation of it look at
[1:21:50] like that old emulate you get less thing
[1:21:53] will happen to the light Carol it was
[1:21:55] the power to push him on out of here for
[1:21:58] a sec Alleluia can the same light de la
[1:22:00] misma Lourdes the same power what'll
[1:22:03] take you and I out of here what is graf
[1:22:07] schwerin face is felling Raptor they
[1:22:11] never said rapture in motivational
[1:22:14] speeches because they see a doctor
[1:22:20] watch what one of these days we're gonna
[1:22:22] send into glory to sustain their a most
[1:22:25] likely they'll be light under our feet

[1:26:23] enemy watch where we're going now or I'm
[1:26:25] thankful to the God for being so mindful
[1:26:27] Josie says the first pen Saturday you
[1:26:29] know in order to come up higher in the
[1:26:32] new Kamal this would be like we've gotta
[1:26:33] clear out our app my son so first cinema
[1:26:35] scalene pls atmospherics watch this now
[1:26:37] we can see we live in three dimensions
[1:26:39] baby muslin tres immensely out would you
[1:26:41] I do then may seep weddin
[1:26:43] light time and matter
[1:26:48] Lucy material but the random says
[1:26:51] there's a fourth dimension and the
[1:26:53] amount of rent and they say we
[1:26:54] understand a 56 and seven but we're not
[1:26:56] we're not going there today in tandem
[1:26:58] was a la Souris tambien that kintel
[1:27:00] authority mansion consists of what like
[1:27:02] what time is joined a kick insisting the
[1:27:05] fourth dimension we know is a faster
[1:27:07] dimension right pseudonymous you're not
[1:27:09] happy that in other words this fourth
[1:27:10] dimension is going right through the
[1:27:12] building right what time is your pasa
[1:27:14] por esta officio yes
[1:27:16] okay what is in that fourth dimension
[1:27:19] okay and it's a quarter even radio waves
[1:27:24] or a key pass on we cannot pick them up
[1:27:28] nos vemos no vamos the capitana because
[1:27:31] our bodies were not made to pick up
[1:27:33] mechanical signals working appointment
[1:27:36] capitalist signal is mechanical watch
[1:27:38] now fix it but in this way in this this
[1:27:42] dimension destiny means here are radio
[1:27:44] waves waste on the road yeah let's
[1:27:46] television pictures that imagine is the
[1:27:49] television diseases
[1:27:51] enfermedades they call cancer and all
[1:27:55] these sicknesses fourth-dimensional
[1:27:57] sicknesses the geminal can survive
[1:27:59] information that's what's going on
[1:28:02] there's so many things going on right
[1:28:05] now that we can't see you and osaka boku

[1:29:01] open suspicious I rebuke that spirit
[1:29:04] that is not me thinking it is under
[1:29:10] somehow one of those thoughts came and I
[1:29:12] picked it up and I said no time to fight
[1:29:27] now let's get with a piano we've sat for
[1:29:29] too long no simple scales and thumbs
[1:29:31] parading your defensive windows I said
[1:29:34] the other day come on we're on the
[1:29:36] defense got the sword of the Spirit they
[1:29:39] would last for the shield of faith there
[1:29:41] was a cool helmet of salvation
[1:29:43] go ahead of us we got all these season
[1:29:45] but we're like oh here he comes again
[1:29:47] no it's gonna go pay it doesn't say

[1:30:20] so the Bram says but we can't pick them
[1:30:23] up no bones live and that is the saying
[1:30:25] Ellis because it's fast it's too fast
[1:30:27] for a new recipe and you need a device
[1:30:29] that will pick up these signals right
[1:30:32] anything Ellis turn on a radio and it
[1:30:34] picks up the radio waves vision Randall
[1:30:38] a television and you know saying he's so
[1:30:40] sly is that a gas that it used to be
[1:30:43] that way yeah in the end in the horse

[1:31:44] will pick up all arrows away a device
[1:31:50] that will pick up all these things
[1:31:51] coming through the fourth dimension
[1:31:53] caminar por la cuarta dimension is right
[1:31:55] in the palm of your estan las palmas us
