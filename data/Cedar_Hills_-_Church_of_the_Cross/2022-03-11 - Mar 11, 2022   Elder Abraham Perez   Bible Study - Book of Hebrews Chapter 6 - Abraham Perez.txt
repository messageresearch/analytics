========================================

no we don't have membership in no church not here on the earth here we have fellowship around the world so then when your spirit bears record with his spirits when the love of god is in your heart in other words a this is a different anointing from the young ministers that have preached something domingo let me say one thing let me give him his flowers because i preached to you everybody takes flowers to the grave wednesday miraculous it to me one of the best messages this man has praised [Music] everybody was saying amen amen he's my buddy it's me god bless you oh man oh my god i have to say something david i didn't like the way he was but now oh my god one of caleb's right hand man and you're my professor oh [Music] you can tell me afterwards notice hebrews 6 11. and we decided that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end nuts lost for the followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises for when god made the promise to abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing i will bless thee and multiplying i will multiply them now abraham received the covenant without any merit at all not because abraham was a better man okay or a even though he was a gentleman he was a good scribe he was a scholar he was a diplomat he never did nothing he didn't do anything but god took a little hook knows it because it will lead you into temptation because the day you eat you shall surely die and then there in the garden of eden the first woman preacher came on the scene because the first preacher was adam he had a [Music] and just because she was co-equal with aaron can you people see the spirit of lady ocean i remember i don't know how many of you knew who billie jean king was and you know to you and on her day she was one of the best woman tennis players and she loved it for equal payment on the on the tournament that spirit of lady ocean didn't come in the seven church age it was there since the beginning so she said if you preach to me i have the right to preach to you also and besides i have more wisdom than you do of course he wasn't telling because allah teacher of the serpent was satan who was perfect in wisdom he was the one that prayed to eve the elf working pretty cool ever he then he told me that if i were rid of the fruit my eyes would be open [Music] venom adam said i wonder what it is all about and brother says that adam was tempering he abraham would have been lost a long time ago but in pre-figure it was christ galatians 3 15. brethren i speak after the manner of man though he'd be but a man's covenant yet if it be confirmed no man dis analyse or add us there too hermanos hablando de interminus now to abraham and his seed were the promises made he says not end to seeds as of many but as of one into thy seed which is christ and we've been dead in christ and baptized into his body we are abraham's seed and our ears of the promise so how are you ever going to fall if god made the promise to you so how are you ever going to backslide well you say can we backslide us absolutely absolutely because the prophet told us that we backslide every day because abraham and them got it and you will get it also but knowledge it's just not that easy here's what the prophet said and because of that don't you think that you have the right to sin you know you rip what you tubs where they would wash all the clothes in the old time that's what you reap it does not mean that you are in love [Music] not only bible studies because the pastor gives tremendous teachings the first words that i read about the minister he does not give you the right to sin it means that you are lost let us go back to hebrews 6 verse 4. for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost if they shall fall away or have tasted the good word of god in the power of the world to come yes if they shall fall away to renew them again until repentance seeing they crucified to themselves the son of god afraid and put him to an open shame i got a phone call about four days ago i he said do you believe that we'll be living the earth forever if you do the will of god but not on this earth it's going to be cleaned and he said he started saying that he was going to be 144 000. and i said do you know that those 144 000 is not the gentiles he said there is no jew that is going to be saved don't you know that the jews rejected christ and then he said i'm going to tell you something you probably don't know oh i said that guy is barking up the wrong trees is and he started to to explain about mount zion in 144 000 and this is one of the things that we were talking about the bible says that all of israel israel is not israel so if all israel will be saved and remember brother says we are not talking about the wall street group is the wall street so then in town says how do we become israel israel being dead in christ take on abraham if you don't walk up to the correction when you do something wrong cristiano god will warn you just about their teeth and then if you don't take the warnings at their tension we're gonna go into something good he will take a preacher friend of brother brethren oh amigos and he went to a a service station a man who used to service his car foreign [Music] and he was a close friend of brother brennan and brother when he came from the meetings overseas he went to select service his car says how are you brother ramsey he said i am doing fine he said i would like for next time i go to overseas that you go with me no he says i wouldn't go oh you know how come you don't want to go [Music] i know you were just joking the other he said if i love god i would be a christian christian brother branham so this dr ramsey he hired a colored brother and one one day on the holidays the liquor stores were closed where he go across the river and bring me a case of beer [Music] and he started getting sick and started going down and he died now i ask the question to you people what's this man saying and the reason that i tell you this years ago in in the church in silver city even before [Music] and i'm not going to mention names you really have to go into the into the message and scriptures and do [Music] doing those the scripture people you want to know why yes [Music] i believe brother ramsay was saved you're croquet lemon ramsestava salvo and one of the main reasons that he was taken of the scene and many even in sanctified him and he counted the covenant an unholy thing and because what he was doing he [Music] nothing in but if you are really truly a child of god you because you fall down you'll condemn me if you stay there but you get off and says i'm going ahead this is and this i say that the covenant that was confirmed before of god in christ the law which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot disannounce that it should make the promise of non-effect ratification the law came after they left egypt for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promise but god gave it to abraham by promise [Music] romans 4 13. romano for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith for they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise made of non-effective because the law worketh wrath but where no law is there is no transgression was therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be true to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of allah not anything you do or any law or joining church it was a grace act of god galatians 3 19. destiny yeah go ahead okay wherefore didn't serve the law it was added because of transgressions till the seed should come to whom the promise was made and it was ordained by angels in the land of a mediator it was added to serve until the seed came and in the hands of a whereas by one man's disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous foreign moreover the law entered the the offense might abound but for sin about abounded grace did much more reigned unto death even so my grace reigns through righteousness unto eternal life by jesus christ our lord has for when god made promise to abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself so you people can understand let us go back to galatians 3 16. now to abraham and his seed were the promises made he said not and to sit a plural as many many bodies of one and thy seed which is christ now the seed of abraham was one of the abram which was christ in three figures but abraham had many children he had one before he made head isaac which showed that sarah was sleeping to sleep because he wanted hagar to bring the child thinking that he was too old and for god to bypass and make some other way and they are at war all the time because thou has kept the word of my patience i also will keep thee from the hour of temptation we shall come i will come upon all the world to try them what does he mean by the word of his passion after he had patiently endured especially he obtained the promise of you see the spirit is speaking about the word of god which is given to us who wait for the fulfillment of the world it requires patience yes did in the case of abraham why if god fulfills his word [Music] when we pray for you you'll come here in church to the altar and some you can get your healing you don't have to come to the front just by sitting there yeah then [Music] hebrews 11 17. by faith abraham when he was tried offered up isaac and he did receive the promises offered of his only begotten there and today we are all overcome with impatience hebrews 6 16 says he says for men barely swear by the greater and he knows for confirmation is to them and end of all stripes it tells what you are that's why brother branham priest the lady of the prayers be sure that your sins don't find you out because your life always reflects what's inside of you so it's all the answers saint john 5 24. san juan capital verily verily i said to you he that speaks in tongues [Music] immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lake hold upon the hope set before us those god is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent has his seed said and shall he not do it or has he spoken and shall he not make it good as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast which the veil is what keeps us from seeing god it the veil is what keeps us from seeing the angels at their [Music] [Music] i told you the angels of the lord in campus run above them that fear him and deliver the veil is what keeps us from living the way and when the veil was turned into what happened when the bell was turned into god became god again and he raised up the veil that he hid himself that's the resurrection of the lord jesus christ proven to us that in this veil that we're here now is down in flesh to show himself he had to hide himself yes condescending because we could not see him but the spirit of the living god that dwells in here he calls those things which were not as though they were so if god [Music] because they want to be with us as much as amen the insurance agent went to sell insurance to brother brenham and brother bradham says i don't need i don't need i already have insurance agents what kind of insurance was quite productive i got i got blessed assurance like i said a hundred and twenty eight dollars to put gears he said my husband said you better feel the thing because the prices are going up and up every day that full tank probably gonna have to last me six um my truck will pass anything on the road except a service station in and we'll finish with this well we'll never finish i remember we will have bible studies at the house [Music] because this this uh studies go online for cases to use one via internet and then they wouldn't hear what you were saying you know even oh yeah but i'll say i'll say this question how many forerunners in the bible how many justin justin name them for runners in the bible aaron harry john the baptist was the first one in um hebrews 6 20 whether the forerunner is for us in turn even jesus jesus was a forerunner jesus is a high priest [Music] [Music] otherwise the indians would attack them he was the one that would warn you and help the people yeah it is one time unless satan with a machine gun he said he had thank god for that foreign is [Applause] lord jesus we just thank you for your mercy and your goodness lord for your precious word lord that goes inside inside the veil lord and brings out your divine nature lord we just thank you lord jesus bless each one knows they go to their homes may your angels as the scripture said encamp around about us defend us protect us we thank you for that lord in your precious name we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen you're actually gonna get you
