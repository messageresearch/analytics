foreign jesse is good is good evening i want to start this it is a privilege and an honor it should be like your note this evening of jesus christ we are hoping that we can finish chapter four tonight is open your bibles vivid and i want to say hello to everybody that's online whatever you are god bless you via internet hebrews 4 verse 7. he again picks a certain day today saying through david after so long a time just as has been said before today if you hear his voice do not harm your heart hebrews 3 7. therefore justice the holy spirit says today if you hear his voice do not harm your heart is when they provoke me provocation said today if you hear his voice do not harm so you might say why do they keep repeating the same scripture we read it three times here first god spoken this wise then he spoke of the law and the third time she says again he limited a day so something happened here i don't think they have the definition of limit limit because he said he limited a certain day limit means a border limit a point [Music] in other words something that is forbidden to go any further so the third time that he said he limited another day if you don't mind it doesn't i passed through something let me say something to relax you silly when i was stationed in alaska in fort wayne right on fort wayne in alaska in uh is in banks alaska and fairbanks alaska so we went on maneuvers we went for about 10 days the weather was between 40 and 50 below zero era after we were through with the maneuver exploracion they told us take down your arctic tent because they're sending the two and a half trucks ton trucks to to pick you up that's that's the army hurry up and wait so we stayed almost close to two hours waiting for the trucks right in the open and it was so cold oh i mean you would just walk back and forth waiting for the truck from a that here a key here i was a kiss about you you won't believe it in their instant instant my bodyguard warmed up i felt a worm coming [Music] what you did yesterday and one of them started talking bad about jesus but the other one we are paying for the sins that we did [Music] jesus didn't say tomorrow jesus today because you will be with me we're always looking back [Music] you might be killed by a heart attack or a car crash out there accidentally the automobile he lived [Music] he forbaded to go any further so today i already took the kid glass away from because paul was an authority of the law of the old testament i'm used to hearing my scripture here but something happened so there it is brother he doesn't have it here but it's up there okay thank you for he is our god and we are the people of his pastor and the shift of his hand today if you will hear his voice therefore the people did child with moses and said give us water that we may drink and moses said unto them i child may we wherefore do you tempt the lord and the people thirsted therefore for water and later the people murmured against moses and said therefore is this that thou hast take us brought us out of egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst and moses cried unto the lord saying what shall we do unto these people they all almost told me this and the lord said unto moses go on before the people and take with you the elders of israel and thy rod for with those motives of the river take it in thine hands behold i will stand before thee upon the rock in horeb and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of it and the people may drink and moses did so in the sight of the elders of israel yesterday and meribah because of the childing of the children of israel and because they attempted the lord saying the lord is among us or not foreign ocho for if jesus had given them rest then would he and not afterwards has spoken of another day report wait a minute here esperanza momento this is how my bible reads he didn't say jesus doesn't say jesus jesus joshua in spanish 22 4. and now the lord your god has given rest unto your brethren as he promised them therefore now return and get you into your tents and unto the land of your possession which moses the serpent of the lord had gave you on the other side of jordan reporters to do the commandments and the law which moses the servant of the lord charged you to love the lord your god and to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and to live with him and to serve him with all your heart and with all your souls [Music] even the sienna lost this video so then we read here in the first verse in joshua that we read so it was not judgement when it gave them the rest judge was said to the land that moses gave you and another thing the word joshua in in the hebrew means jesus jesus the dispensations change with jesus christ does this penis something that god did you see remember that god was the taking them to the land of promise but he let satan tempt you along we know that the what called the commandment said that and then they went to the pocket and got the law for that commandment even allah now he can say so then in terms of how did the temp the devil tell moses one of the commandments all shall have no other gods before them so then the weak point of moses and when he came down from the mountains go so did jesus have a weak point after he tested for 40 days you if you are the son of god make these stones turn to breath [Music] alone [Music] don't think just because i i i can teach that i know everything no principle i always wondered maybe that my channels are [Music] the same thing that happened in the book of isaiah i have been anointed to bring good news and to proclaim the acceptable day of the lord that was on verse 2 of chapter 61 is [Music] is so why did he it wasn't time to to preach about the fourth commandment he couldn't do it because he was going to be the rest in genesis the rest of israeli acceptance and kinesis there was no rest yes why did god rest rested on the seventh day of personal a commandment [Music] through when i need you hallelujah [Music] [Music] hebrews 4 verse 8 and 9. for if jesus had given them rest then would he afterwards have spoken up another day first night blessed anointing there remained there for a rest to the people of god if there was to be a sabbath if the seventh was to be a sandy keeping guard domingo he has spoken of come unto me all year that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me or i am making lonely hebrews 4 9 to 11. say he also has ceased from his own works as god did from here let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief sounds [Music] he entered somewhere elentro in algon lugar he said come unto me all year that labor bengal and our heavy laden i will give you rest that is concerned what is the rest it is the holy spirit is in the spirit that is [Music] and he for a certain amount of time so god gave israel the seventh day for their seventh yes in commemoration in commemoration of his own work the supreme and when he finished creating a conde el [Music] so they all could keep a certain day about this sabbath rest what good will he do if you enter into his rest he enters in but you don't remain when you [Music] and the world is more appealing than the word of god and like i've said before [Music] [Music] that's why we we see why god could not give to us any certain day to give it to us it's a sabbath rest is which we enjoy now listen here's the commandment if he no matter the age like that i don't care if you're 10 20 40 60 70 years old no matter the age no important like that physically physically said he [Music] genesis 6. 3. and the lord said my spirit can always strive with men for that he also is flesh yet his day shall be a hundred and twenty years and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually versus and he repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and he grabbed him in his heart is something for right right there in genesis 6 3. he was not resting physically anymore he says my spirit he said give me spirit we will not strive with the human race anymore he had no place to rest him that he had made man there was no place for him to rest genesis 1 1. enes uno uno in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth verse 2 and the earth was without form and void in darkness when upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the water we heard our founding pastor picked wednesday on the light yes in the beginning the spirit of god moved upon the waters but in chapter six of genesis it was not the beginning it is the end of the beginning and the spirit of god moved upon the waters again upon the people [Music] principio genesis 8 6 and this is also says it came to pass at the end of 40 days that noah opened the window of the ark which he had made sick and he sent forth a raven which went forth to and fro until the waters dried up from the earth used to be related to they're waiting for a car or somebody to kill a rabbit or get dead meat and they sit on the wire they sit on their smartphones and their tablets television blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness so when noah led the raven out of the earth well he got tired of the catholic church so he went to the lutheran church so then he saw another dead body he went into the methodist important to save the water heater baited from off the face of the ground [Music] found no rest for the soul of her food and she returned unto him into [Music] [Music] god took it out of your hands and gave it to the nazarenes what happened to you you once had the light um but god took it out of your hands and gave it to the pentecostals so god moved all [Music] and until he found some people that would follow him so what is the sabbath what is the rest he needed to rest physically saying mark chapter 1 verse 9 san marcos it came to pass in those days that jesus came from nazareth of galilee and was baptized of john in the jordan versus and straight away coming up out of the water he saw the heavens open and the spirit like a dove descending upon him and there came a voice from heaven saying thou art my the power my beloved son in whom i am well pleased so that knew where to land he left him in the garden of gethsemane so where was he going to rest physically now hora dondiba repose let us go a little further isaiah 28 9. oh starting with verse 8 i'm sorry for all the tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there is no place clean so where was he gonna go if all these dead bodies denominations are full of vomit brother venom said this is that in the last days there would be a predicament so if spanish situation is a conditional situation one that is difficult unpleasant no placentero or embarrassing situation ii peter chapter two verse 21 for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than after they have known it to turn from the holy commandment deliver them to them but it is happening unto them according to the true proverb the dog is turned to his own vomit again and the south that was washed to her wallowing in the mire no when you leave the word of god and go to the taste in all the kind of things in the world can be said on there so where did he find rest donda here is the rest of the apostle isaiah 28 starting with verse 10 isaiah's must be upon precept precept or order upon order line up online they're here a little and they're a little verse 11 lips and another tongue will he speak to these people that's verse 11 okay to whom he said this is the rest for which he may cause the worry to rest and this is the refreshing yet they will not here must not away when did the stammering uh lips come dead was on the day of peninsula that's when the rest came on the day of pentecost [Music] god received it from his work the second rest in secular israel received it in the law israel and the third dress is you have never entered into god's rest case the rest is only for the one that has ceased from their labors over us if you say you have the holy ghost they're still like things of the world you have never entered into the rest of you still haven't finished your worldly work that's when god rested on the seventh day person when he finished his work terminology revelation apocalypses and i heard a voice from heaven heaven saying unto me right blessed are the dead which died in the lord from henceforth yes the spirit that they may rest from their neighbors and their works to follow him so there is my wife isa caleb your mother calipso
