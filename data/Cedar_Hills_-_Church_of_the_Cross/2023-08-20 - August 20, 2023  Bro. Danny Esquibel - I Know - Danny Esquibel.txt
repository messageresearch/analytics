thank my fans foreign I'm watched Pretty extensively amen but amen well we thank the Lord for you all that are online God bless you yeah it said that Jesus was given the borrowed tomb is Jesus I was giving some borrowed eyes this evening couldn't find no cheaters so I said anybody I ask Emilio do you have cheaters and remember my dad said one time he said uh you know as you get a 40 because he had heard what the prophet said right when you turn 40 your eyes oh I was about 12 you know I'm like right let's go fly out yeah I don't know about that I can see a gnat on the back of her ear oh yeah right but uh I found out your eyes go flat and every year after they go flatter and flatter so praise the Lord I can see maybe all right so let's turn over in our scriptures and let's read uh John 4 Juan capitolo cuatro chapter 10. versus yes and so let's read the scripture real quick and then we'll we'll explain something here so this is Jesus talking to the woman at the well because the Jesus and Jesus answered her and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee give me the drink that would would have asked have asked him of him and he would have given the Living Water respond Jesus is amen and if we would skip down to verse 24 it says God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth the woman said unto him I know say Amen you can be seated and may the Lord have his blessings right so she was looking for a messiah right and so she had all this information of what the Messiah was gonna be us right and so when it presented himself to her at first it was a rejection so kind of a strange title right and then a subtitle I know right but it's not in the way that it's written there little noise it's in the way of the way you pronounce it in the tone so it's I know you'll see I know Jose right see the difference yeah so we live in a day and age right so this is an information age and today in the world that we live in everybody knows it all right you can't don't can't say anything right because right away they're gonna fact check they're going to go to Google right away let me find out what it says a lot of information right information correct we have we have a bunch of know-it-alls what we say and even uh when I'm sometimes out working in the yard and Patio I'll tell my granddaughter something says the five-year-old I used to just play with her I said says a three-year-old yes no I'm four no no all right so it's it's that everywhere that we live in the world is you you can't tell people anything right you tell them hey you're supposed to do this and this is right so in my job right I have the opportunity to to be the boss and so you tell people hey don't forget that you need to do this and this and this is and then and you're like I thought they knew right and then it continues the next day hey you forgot yesterday to clean your station don't forget that this is what you need to do oh see you'll see and then they forget right you tell people this is the policy of our uniforms right follow this policy oh I know I know they forget half their uniforms right see so they know everything right and so God says my people perish for the lack of knowledge right but we know it all right so there are things that we must know now there are things that this lie in this life in this Christian walk that you must know so we know that the Bible says You must be born again it's not a it's not a maybe no it's like okay it's not uh possibly that it's must you must be born again right so there's things that we must know and the first thing that we need to know tonight is that I need a savior is Right does that excite you that there is a savior if you're in need of a savior so I need to know that I need a savior the Bible says in Romans 3 23 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God so we are in need of a savior this is that I need to be redeemed in order to be redeemed something has to give up its life right the Bible says that without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins so in order for there to be life there has to be death something has to give its life and that's a must there's a must for life to come there has to be a death so for in order for you to be sitting here tonight and sitting where you're at today is somebody died we understand that right that somebody died and gave their life just so you can be where you're foreign in a press it was squeezed foreign [Applause] somebody was squeezed somebody was put through the fire again just so that we could be where we're at today and now order everybody they they all believe in God right so we hear it said so many often times nobody has to tell me to raise my hands right we hear it all the time we stay here right nobody has to tell me the song leader don't have to oh when I feel the spirit moving I'll raise my hands problem is that when the spirit is a lot of times because we're not in tune that's why God places worship leaders men that are in tune that when the spirit moves [Music] amen amen not a lot of amens right Menace but pero they're in tune now we all need a savior tonight now I want you to know that Jesus Jesus Is My Savior is me Salvador Jesus loose he died he did that for me Jesus did it Jesus Jesus did everything for me all that Jesus did Jesus was because he loved me that's my Revelation he did it for me for me Jesus Jesus Paid It All Lopez all to him had left the Crimson Stain say that again sin had left a Crimson Stain a mancha Jesus blood hath washed your wife let us know I know I was lost amen you have to know you were lost now I was reading and I like to read these stories that about the average of about 100 to 150 people or 100 to 150 hikers because of lack of preparation lack of knowledge right so I like to read these stories right and and these people is they they go out hiking right they go out for an evening stroll foreign right they they get to a place oh what a beautiful place right and they they just head out on a on a little nightly stroll he's telling us and they die because they were not prepared and it's always asked well what happened well they went out with their sandals and they were just hiking up in the rocks and fell down and broke their legs right they were just unprepared and they they say uh well this person went out hiking and they they didn't take no water you know right no water they were just out there in the wilderness they didn't know of the precautions or the dangers precautions what happened to this person he went out into the wilderness they weren't out there trying to be safe and I thought I asked him where did they shoot this elk at yeah okay I'm gonna wear my tennis and so when we got there it wasn't by the road it was up in the hills it was a place where you shouldn't be in shoe tanning shoes I was unprepared right and when I got in that situation I I said oh nothing will ever happen to me I got the reflexes of a cat oh yeah all right see I got the speed of a mongoose right I've been hiking these Hills for my whole life and and there are one there I was Sister Andrea Andrea call your dad Yeah I broke my leg so there I was was a busted leg because I was unprepared but we we get all Brave and we say oh I would never do that I would never go out prepared and then we get real religious I would never do what that brother does I'll never do what that sister does oh you're never going to catch me doing what that person all right yet every day in the spiritual guys God gives us a guide and we're living in a day that if not prepared or out of pocket in that if not prepared because you know or you're out of pocket I don't know if that's a word foreign he got lost amen amen he went chasing after a deer and he got lost now how many has ever been lost all right you've been lost now it's a feeling that you can't make up is you can't make it up you can't almost be lost I would purposely try to get myself but you you you can't fake it is being here you can't make it up let me see if if I can be lost no you can't make it up you have to be lost you're not really lost if you if you know your way back right if if you're lost right you you get scared if you could see the picture of a man who was lost if you could take his picture the expression on his face would be something you've never seen before there would be something that an artist couldn't draw you would be lost you would be lost and undone and one day each and every one of us and maybe here tonight you might find yourself don't know your way back let me tell you the prophet of God he said I knew there was a power line electricity from the cabinet I began to walk with my hands up that's the first step that you have to do is I was walking for miles my hands will get tired and cold but I knew if I would put my hands down I would miss that line tonight we need to do a reconfiguration of Our Lives until we reach that powerless no you would be scared and if you don't get back on track the consequences could be harsh last consequences brother Brown tells the story that he says if I don't make it back this is in that cabinet in our lives to get back on track in which God has placed in the church yeah those are the helpers that's the compass is placed in the church and you tell people you need a five-fold Ministry I know you'll see it's like the brother one time and we don't mention names but uh he he went hunting one time and uh he had bought a compass yeah these supplies and accessories we're getting ready to leave to go hunting when we're getting ready he says hey should I bring the compass did I bring my water yeah no no no you you brought it all this way to leave it here that's what you brought it foreign you have to use it for what it's intended foreign my wife is supposed she buys these rugs buys rugs okay I need a rug for the door for the kitchen well the intention of a rug right so that you walk in a home you track the dirt from outside oh you don't take the contents of what's on your feet who the next room so its intention is stepped on wipe down right but every time I'm looking for a rug it's hanging on a chair it's hanging on the tub it's hanging over here well I say what where are all the wrongs I'm wiping that one off oh that's what they're intended foreign am en and swallowed they put inside of us now why now order people today they say listen you tell them you need a you need a counselor Jesus said in Mark in Marcos he said what did he say are you home he says it is expedient it's experience it's necessary it's necessary it's necessary it's a must it's a must that I go away they want to get back and this is that Greek word means is right and we say oh the comforter is going to come and he's gonna come for me he's gonna come for me this and that now okay yes he'll do that but he's also going to come we walk alongside to reprove the world he's gonna guide you to stay with your come back is he right beside you that's where we find the problem today but it's experience is necessary and he's going to come now everybody says listen they all say oh I I believe right you ask everybody do you believe how many believe everybody says oh I believe I believe you're clear right everybody believes nowadays now you can only believe in something you don't know right it's only oh I believe it I might not understand it no you know I don't understand at all but I believe it I might not know at all but I believe it so you believe on what you don't know right but Jesus said now that's a pretty big you believe by faith now there's there's a difference in believing and Believing by faith but you have to believe no um to be it's that easy now sometimes we say oh I I believe right we we're sick we go to the doctor and uh we we ask for prayer and we say um do you believe so out of fear well we we say oh I believe or or I look at my neighbor and we say uh I believe because our neighbor said we believe right now prophet of God says foreign in Reading in the message I know you'll say he says uh now he says why should a Christian ever be perplexed why wouldn't not everything run just run perfect as a for a Christian perfect that's that's why when if you're going to be a Christian Cristiano right you you can't be a call it a Sith right sister a little sister no no people say oh I'm going to be a Christian and now my walk is going to be just old peaches and creams but it doesn't and we know it and sometimes we have more troubles when we become a Christian we did when we were Sinners it is many are the afflictions of the righteousness God promised many afflictions strange feelings and strange things that would be beyond our understanding what it's always done for our Goods are you sick tonight all right it's done for our good Ness help us to understand that I remember when my when my son he would have an episode or a seizure and then all my I know get those I know you'll say oh I know you're saying I know you said they would become I don't know why you know oh God why why why don't you do this why why why are I know because I don't know and it would really affect me I would feel like why doesn't God do this now without those trials without those now [Music] in our last scripture reading I wanted to read some other scriptures I don't notice what time it was but I think it's about that time and so let's turn over in our our scripture to uh first Peter Pedro First Peter chapter one it says here Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ to the stranger scattered throughout pontus galathea Cappadocia Asia and Bith United elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit upon obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace be multiplied so what Peter's saying here is you are not forgotten for you have been chosen and destined by father God the Holy Spirit has set you apart to be God's holy ones obedient followers or followers of Jesus Christ who have been gloriously sprinkled with his blood yes may God's grace and peace Cascade over you many times over muchas business in verse 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy hath begotten us begotten us again unto a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead now that's shaunting material where are my Believers at that's shouty materials so maybe that didn't make you shout maybe this one will maybe this one will see yeah it says he we would just read verse three so Peter's saying celebrate with praises to God our Father yeah just follow me at this doesn't say just celebrate with praise the god of the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has shown us his extravagant Mercy again for his foundation of Mercy has given us a new life we are reborn to the experience of a living energetic through the resurrection of Jesus Christ so this is the only place in the New Testament where the Greek verb and this shows that God himself is the one who gives us New Birth you must be born again but you're not because many times we say oh I I know you take a man like job there was not another man like job maybe you know but I don't know better General saying of a man that went through what job went through okay we've heard stories [Music] those people lose something here and there yeah but job lost everything that he had said he lost it all and now now you say oh I lost a lot too I had how much did you have I had five dollars job had it at all foreign work building I know this one's good I promise you this one's really good right and it's found over in in Romans in Romanos uh chapter eight Romans chapter eight there's uh there is therefore no condemnation how many people condemned tonight maybe your life has been in shambles and ruins but [Music] there is therefore no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit let me bring it to you in terms that might make you ciao so now this is a passion version so now Oda the case is closed there is therefore no condemnation so now the case a castle it's closed there remains no accusing voice of condemned me in life unions well Jesus the anointed one Jesus Jesus the Christ Jesus Christ Jesus the Jesus has liberated us from the love standing there they are late if you want to be liberated from that level lay surrender to him give your life to him not to me nor me not not to the church maybe you might find yourself walking for 45 years 50 years there's just no more fire in me he says he's the he's the power he is the gasoline Gasolina and he can light your fire yeah with our hands raised to the Lord Jesus Christ Lord I Want to Love You More don't you want to do that tonight [Music] Lord I want to [Music] move [Music] you're so easy [Music] oh Hallelujah do you love him tonight foreign [Music] I can face [Music] yes I know [Music] whoa hold on [Music] everybody [Music] is gone because I know [Music] [Applause] [Music] with our heads about tonight if there's somebody here yeah yeah that has never experienced [Music] the soul-saving of our Lord Jesus Christ [Music] he is here for you tonight would you raise your hands say Lord yes I Surrender my life to you Lord I want you to come to my life and reign in me foreign [Music] dear Lord Heavenly Father you see the hands father we ask Lord Lord that you are come and touch their lives Lord may you reign in their lives show to them that you are a savior Lord it writes down on the page Lord pardon [Music] Harden and we accept that party Lord I pray for the hands that are raised Lord I pray father that you would give him courage give them strength Lord for those that have raised their hands the Lord they may just need another brand new touch [Music] Another Touch of you father I pray father in your name don't you love him let's sing that song I know yes I know Comey sinners [Music] Hallelujah aren't you thankful that you're lost and he found you [Music] [Applause] [Music] and make you free [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] Jesus [Music] [Applause] near me [Music] [Music] Hallelujah [Music] yes Hallelujah foreign [Music] [Music] he will keep [Music] singers [Music] how [Applause] it all must work [Music] oh good morning now thinking like you know [Music] Jesus [Music] and I know oh yes I know [Music] again hallelujah amen let's give

her brother Dan for that beautiful word amen thank you God has sure blessed us this evening you may be seated just a couple of announcements um of course our service on Sunday it will be at 11 A.M here at the church and it will be streaming from Tucson Arizona excited for that at 11 A.M here at the Tabernacle Manana and then also of course you want to remember the services in Tucson on Saturday [Music] at five p.m on Saturday to be a youth service services and but it's for everybody and then of course our brother Tommy Jr will be preaching on Sunday morning and I left the address upstairs but I believe they have it on here there will be 2555 North Stone Stone Avenue if you want to write that down those are going and we hope to see you all there is and we'll have a good time in the Lord amen amen and before we go uh you know brother Danny has an announcement and then after that our brother Jonathan will have an announcement amen so we just want to let you know there will be no Sunday school this Sunday you know Domingo they'll take off this week and so from here on out um we're not going to be sending the children right away to the uh to the fellowship hall from Sunday schools so what we'll do is um you can just come in bring your children with you and then uh when uh they announced to bring the minister up to the front will dismiss the children to their classes and then once the preaching is over we'll just bring the children back can you help us with that amen just uh for the reason that sometimes the services go a little longer it sometimes gets a little tiring just remember I said it gets tiring for the children no [Music] no but uh yeah um it'll help them and help our teachers as well amen God bless you we just want to go over a couple of church order items just a refresher on things that we've kind of gotten relaxed on number one is uh please watch the speeding in the parking lot we've had issues where you know if you're late what happens when we're late we speed right now nobody speeds we see people speed from turn into here you can hit 25 miles an hour keep watch for our children in the parking lot they sometimes take off from the doors and they run across and we don't need an accident please be vigilant to our children when entering or leaving the parking lot and big children too we're all children of God right uh number three is when deacons and ushers are finished locking up the churches feel free to Fellowship thank God we'll give you some time to Fellowship out there but then once the lights go out and we're ready to leave you're welcome to continue fellowshipping companies but just lock the gate for us and usually when we ask individuals to lock the gate they say no no no no we're going to our cars but we've we have had a couple issues where some individuals kind of got upset with the ushers and deacons and we don't need to have that either is open I think 24 hours IHOP is open 24 hours please please no gum chewing inside the church we've gotten relaxed us as ushers and deacons but we will tell you to spit it out okay um stairs cry room is for nursing mothers foreign now there are some nursing mothers who have younger children that do walk that's understandable there's not a problem with that but we do have some some mothers that are expecting and it's it gets really crowded back here so we would just ask that children that do walk if the parents mothers can take them to the upstairs cry room uh let's see uh we asked uh to please keep your children seated during the service and uh parents please don't get offended if you're approached but it is [Music] and asked uh to take your child to one of the cry rooms we don't wanna disrupt the service with with the ministers up here while the services is a we all need to have reverence and respect for our church amen amen I haven't heard one Amen on that one that goes for all of us we're not pointing fingers this pertains to each and every one of us if you have any questions on any of these items it is thank you thankful to you for the life you've given us for the opportunity to come into your house and to hear Words of Life foreign [Music] air is going to be a meeting in the air in the sweets and I am going to meet you meet you over there in that home beyond the sky
