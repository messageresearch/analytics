Sinha survival and oh it makes me reflect on the thousands upon thousands of messages that we have been blessed to hear through the years massively harami todo esto I lost me lism and sir his game was supposedly a great message of restoration and of grace that we have received from our or prophet grandmas sake cameras a vida de Gracia de nuestra Profeta the messages that we have received through our fivefold the fivefold ministry misaki's cameras video they struck into play into play me stereo that has kept the voice of Elijah alive I'm Anthony de la voz de leus debo as we reflect on all these things Amit is kind of like a Mosin todo esto we simply see implement the vemos that those messages are more relevant right now than they ever have been mr. Kazama relevant disorder can do we have heard message after message hemos oído mistress and they've been tremendous eunseo tremendous but when it comes to the time of the manifestation or the complete unfolding of these messages pero cuando viene a la manifestation oil development oh the toast in circus it's amazing to look at s-sir pendentive and because we see for prophecy being fulfilled ork

Great Depression a meter scale of una vez con la ma dijo SK yo pasé por la grande de pasión policeman I know what it is not to have nothing to eat your steak is not anarchic and we possibly understand what it was like in for those living in the times of World War one Omo p.m. assent and there alguien que pasado por la primera verse over 16 million people died during that war the velum told me one is the hint is ok can you imagine the war going on it ends in 1918 in my head like a rock about an El Nino and that the same year influenza gets going he'll miss mine you're welcome inside and here's another 50 million people not Auto cincuenta million is a him I don't know what it's like to live in a world like that Colonel Snickers even air with us morning I don't know what it's like to live in a world like that I don't you know say case we didn't room obviously comprehend the black death plague como vamos Anton de la la Muerta negative like over 50 million people in my Toma de cincuenta Muniz the hint that was about over 60% of the of Europe's entire population in that time here as the set up was the por ciento de la la gente de la ropa how can we understand what it was to those 68

gave their lives so that we could have what we have today usiness will be there para que no so no one here is toy the song says it's dripping with blood or a sonnet country said this Holy Ghost and gospel is dripping with blood OS they were kill you around is Dustin Graham the blood of the saints who dies for the truth that's not smart it is this Holy Ghost gospel is dripping with blood Haley over del espíritu Santo we look at all those things and yet we understand they cannot even compare to what's coming it almost of course as I know second panel okay beginning the judgments that are here and those that are yet to come estan aqui y los que vienen but yet even through all of this is that although it's a Christian has such a great promise if Christianity nanogram promise that I have not seen nor ear has heard it often released on you know he neither has it entered into the heart of them that love him the book went rather critical Scalia the things that God has prepared for those that love him dearly put it but I lost my tequilas Kelly God wants us to be prudent in this time uski because their most prudent is that he wants him to be vigilant during this time is that mostly he lamented he wants us to be lighthouses that guess that was my finals and I want to tell you this he catalyst theory that right now is the greatest time in all of history to preach the gospel is this temple must remember but uh pretty kinda live on Katie Saudia people began to put their guards down now like hit the lamp beside like water the because of fear I come so that what do you think when
