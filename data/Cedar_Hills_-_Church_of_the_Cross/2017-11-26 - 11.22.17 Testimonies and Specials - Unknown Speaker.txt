is now boring by king of all kings today man can we get one to the Lord at this time we have a little video we'd like to show you so if they'd go ahead and put that up and turn the lights off and God bless you my name is philip garcia this is the tractor that I was bush hogging in the back pasture on July 25th when I my son Silas Garcia fell off of the tractor and got ran over and I'd like to share with you the testimony that the Lord did for me and my family we were in like I said the back pasture here is back over here behind the woods we were Bush Hagen and I had Silas sitting in my lap right here we've gone around the perimeter one time already there's a lot of tree branches that overhang the perimeter and so he's sitting in my lap right here and he's kind of he kind of hangs on to you gets his arm wrapped around you and so forth and we're moving along on the fourth gear on this end on this tractor run at about 2,000 rpms we're moving along and every time a tree branch comes you kind of duck down or you may have to lift the branch over the stack or something and you're just kind of moving along and we got around the whole perimeter once and we're almost done with the second second pass where we were completely away from the trees and we're we're moving along and we're like right where we only have one or two more trees that we got to get underneath and then we're back into the open pasture and a sycamore branch was hanging real low and he was sitting in my lap right there and I had him and he was hanging on to me and I went to lift the branch over I believe I believe on that one I had to lift the branch over and somehow he he just slipped out and douve for the ground right there I'm I don't sure he wasn't hanging on to nothing and I guess I wasn't hanging on to him good enough and when I saw him go I just knew like the devil just pounds in your mind that you're gonna run over your son and kill him and that yes that's the end there's there's no way in the world you can you can stop a tractor fast enough I reached for him I remember trying to grab him I couldn't get him it was too far gone I slammed in the clutch I pushed on the brake but my feet weren't on those I'm just kind of launched a lot ly driving so I slant I find the clutch I find the brake I stop and when I finally get stopped I looked down there and I kind of this right here in Silas his feet are sticking towards the bush hog and as it is square underneath that back tire and I just screamed out to God I said oh god you gotta help me you gotta save my boy it's his feeder back there I have an independent PTO system which was engaged automatically pulled my three point up as fast as I could and and I keep looking back there and he's just he's he's squirming underneath that that tire and it just it didn't look right I mean it doesn't so I reached down here I kicked my pto out and I'm already in fourth gear and I go to move out real slow and for some reason I I knew that the PTO was out I squared it up obvious when it's in it it makes these pretty significant click noises and I kicked it out of independent PTO I went to take off and I don't know why but that that PTO spun and when it did it it caught its little foot and it smacked at one time I threw the clutch back in and I believe I said out loud why is the PTO going I was very confused at that point and I kept crying out to the Lord Lord save him Lord Almighty God you got to help me and I I kicked it over put it back in neutral and I pulled forward in that time it didn't it didn't it didn't spin and I eased off of it and I kind of rolled forward and I stopped to where his head was right between the tire in the bush hog and and I put the tractor in neutral I jerked the ebrake up as far as I could and and little Silas his head was still on the ground there and he's just laying there and he kind of lifted up his head and and turned and he he looked at me and his little face was smashed he had blood running out of his nose and it wasn't a real muddy spot hadn't rained here for like two weeks and it had sprinkled that morning but it wasn't real muddy there was no mud on his face but he had all the grass all matted up on his face and everything you could see that the lines of the grass and the seeds on him and his face was just his skull and everything was just very it was disfigured and I said Silas go that way and I was I was being very loud because I had the tractor I believe the tractor was still running I killed the tractor I I jumped off the tractor and he was trying to get up back over there and I just ran back and I grabbed him up in my arms and I picked him up in my arms and I grabbed his foot cuz I could tell his foot had been hit and I I just screaming out to God I was like God he got to help us and little as he was in a lot of pain he was squirming and he screamed for the first time and they don't the only thing he said was Lord heal me he just screamed Lord heal me and he just kept saying it over and over again as I I started running back to the house as hard as I could and I was just just holding holding them to me and I kept saying Lord Lord you gotta help us Lord and I kept crying out to the Lord and I'm making it about halfway up it's probably about 200 yards I made it about 200 yards up and just the Lord he just the Holy Spirit moved down and I started to cry and I couldn't scream out to the Lord anymore I just was trying to pray and little Silas just quit squirmin he quit screaming he quit everything he just started he just kind of just started hugging me and he at that point he tried to you kept trying to look at his foot and I was holding his foot up as I was carrying him and I wouldn't let him look at his foot I kept I said just hold me Silas and it was so precious because the Holy Spirit just moved down I started weeping and that's little Silas he just it was just the Lord he just goes dad I'm gonna be just fine God already went to Calvary for me now it just it has boosted my faith and then I just encouraged him I said Silas that's right he's the high priest of our confession and you just confessed that he went to Calvary for you you're going to be just fine you're going to be just fine that's right Silas I said the Lord's gonna take care of you we're gonna be fine of course the devil keeps hounding your mind with brain injuries all the things that go along with that he's trying to hand you that box the snakes and just just trying to reach out to the Lord and he just gave us the faith to accept his healing nothing was going to be wrong with him he was going to be fine I almost made it to a gate over here I'm getting close to that gate and getting up to the house and I called my wife and I was up at the house with the other three children when I got a phone call from Phillip and when I answered he was very frantic and he just was saying get a hold of brother Joseph right now call brother Joseph and ask him to pray and then call 9-1-1 and so I started getting a little worried and I hung up the phone and then I just dialed him right back because I I didn't even know what to tell brother Joseph I figured he must have had some sort of accident on the tractor so I called him back and I said Philip what do you want me to say and he said just get a hold of brother Joseph so I hung up the phone and I I opened the back door to see where two of the kids were and they were up by the house and I just told him pray for Silas and brother Joseph picked up the phone and I just told him what I knew that Philip had been in the back field on the tractor with the bush hog and Silas was with him and that he told me to call you and pray for Silas and he told me that he would go to prayer right then and as I got off the phone with with brother Joseph I could hear Philips voice at that point I was almost to the gate I was getting through that gate over there and and i called 9-1-1 and i told him that i had ran over my son with the tractor and a bush hog and so I went to the door and opened a and and I saw him with Silas and my first reaction was like he looked like he was ok but I was wondering if he was unconscious because of how still he was there was just perfectly calm and but I notice Silas was moving and responding and he seemed normal and his his head looked a little discolored like something had happened you know and and his foot I could tell was gashed open pretty good but so Philip brought him in and you know was just calling out to the Lord and we all were at that point and and I I made it into the house and I took Silas and I laid him down on the couch after I hung up with 911 they got my address and they said help was on the way I laid him down on the couch and my wife had sent the kids out and I got got they're laying out on the couch and I believe she was just like there what's wrong with them I'm like honey I ran over his head with the tractor and I'm sitting there looking at his head and I'm going that ain't the same head that was out there cuz I head out there was mashed it wasn't ever flat but it was just it was disfigured and just looking at his head and he had a ridge on the side of his head where the the tractor Ridge where he was stuck underneath there went right across the temple of his his head right across at the bottom of his jaw and and the other side just had some capillaries that burst that he had some red spots on his face and that's all it was wrong with his head it was just just so so precious you know what I mean the Lord had moved on the scene already so while we were there and the paramedics were kind of assessing him they they said that he was cut all the way through on his foot and they were just trying to keep him really still because of his head and they put like a collar around his neck to keep his neck still and they told us they were gonna be taking him in then in the ambulance and then they said they were gonna go ahead and fly in a helicopter so Silas was worried concerned he wanted to make sure I could ride with him and but that was the only thing he was really bothered about through the whole thing they would ask him are you hurting is anything wrong and he would just say well my foots kind of hurting a little bit you know and so so they they were able to load him up into the ambulance and they drove them out to the helicopter which landed in the neighbor's yard and they loaded him up and as they were asking him questions and everything he was just acting completely normal just really calm anytime they asked him to to do anything physically whether it was squeeze their hands or whatever it was he was just completely just doing whatever they asked and so when we landed and they took us in in the hospital there were just people rushing around assessing him and everything and and the one doctor came up to me and yeah I was just kind of standing there and and he said well the reason everyone's rushing around we're just assessing him and everything and he said but really he said I'm not I'm not gravely worried about and he's acting really good he looks really good the doctor he came over and he said well I need to let a few other people look at it the radiologists and things he said but as far as I can see there is nothing wrong with his head everything everything looks fine he said I'm gonna let some other people look at it but I'm not I don't see anything through the whole thing he was completely calm and he never he never cried which I thought was really strange because he's normally reacts in even small situations so then later that night the specialist finally came and looked at his foot and at first they had told us well his foot is more of a crush injury so I'm not sure what the specialist is gonna want to do whether it's gonna be surgery or or what he decides and so when a specialist finally came in and he said well there are a few fractures he said but the bones are really in the right place I just I think I'm just gonna leave him alone and just let him heal up on their own and put a few stitches in so by the next day it was less than 24 hours later when they discharged us the final specialist that came in to to say okay Silas is good to go home he said the thing we're really gonna watch right now is we just want to make sure that no infection gets in the cuts you know now after having your little boy run over by a tractor an infection in the cut so we thought you know the Lord can take care of that I'm not even worried so Silas has been been acting great and the hardest thing has been keeping him stills to let his foot heal but we're just so thankful for the Lord for what he has done for our family we're shocking the feel of their own shovel off through this grate the back wheels off my head and then the bush aren't got my foot so and then iid like throw them in Mike when Titus heard that is like that he said I didn't fall on the ground I just fell in Jesus's hands I just want to thank the bride around the world were praying for us and this and everything and thank the Lord for sparing the life of our son just feel
