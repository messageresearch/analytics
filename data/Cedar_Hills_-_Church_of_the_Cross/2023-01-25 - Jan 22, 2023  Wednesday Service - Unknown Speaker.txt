bless each and every one of you tonight how many are happy to be here tonight let's go ahead and just uh get right into the scripture in Psalms uh 109 verse 26 nueve and this is how it reads it says help me O Lord my God oh save me according to thy mercy ayudame and you can take your seats uh so I just had a little uh thought tonight and um I want to go back to when we had went to Mexico City back in July and um so I was um oh it was like a week before the services uh I was just kind of you know at home and at the time I was doing some work and just different things and uh something kept telling me uh I heard a voice in my head that kept telling me well you know both and it kept saying yeah make sure that you're ready and you know at the time I was just thinking myself ready for what you know uh so as the weekend comes for the Mexico City meetings we had gotten on the plane and uh under you know seated down and uh again I heard the same thing you know it said make sure that you're ready so then I was thinking to myself well you know the services are coming up I'm assuming get ready for that is but in my head I was like oh there's no way I'm gonna go up there and speak you know it's Mexico City you'll probably sure have some brothers from out of town that'll speak I won't go up there yeah well I thought wrong and brother Kayla said can you go up there and give your testimony so I said oh well you know he meant ready for that oh so I got up there and I you know gave my testimony and you know I spoke about how I came from two different households you know and that my dad was struggling a lot with you know drugs and alcohol so uh after I had after uh the service had ended I think it was like a Saturday night or something like that I was talking to why was there in like a little group with a couple of these young guys and we you know we're just talking getting to know each other and stuff you know and one of them uh was right here on my right side and I don't remember his name or his face but I do remember he said he was like a year younger than me foreign and uh he looks at me and he gets my shoulder like this and his eyes start tearing up and my first thought was oh man did I say something or hurt his feelings and I was like in my head I was thinking oh my God I was trying to like remember what I had said because I don't know if I said something to offend him so anyways um he looks at me and he says he said brother the testimony that you gave is the exact same situation that's going on in my household and I just I was thinking to myself like wow like that's just crazy and he was saying you know all the the words of wisdom that God gave you and that you spoke it out uh he said now I know now I know uh now I found the balance that I needed in my life and he says um that's that's how I got this that verse was from him because he was uh he was telling me that he was kind of like getting into the message you know you know his his mom was in the message and you know his dad was out there and he was saying you know I I don't know what to do he goes the only thing that I've heard was the song uh to read psalms 109 26. and he said oh I just kept I kept on asking the Lord to help me um because you know he was thinking that it was his fault you know and he goes you know brother I I really needed help and I didn't know who to go to or what to do and he says but I believe that God sent you to give that testimony to help me and my family and and you know I I was just I was just lost for words because I you know I it's just crazy how you're you know saying just your testimony you know maybe you don't realize it no realizable you know even if it's just one person you know it has a big impact on their life so I was just you know in my mind I was just like thank you Lord you know gracias and um so then I told him you know told them but don't don't just stop there no no I said you you pray for your dad you know he'll get into the message and I said I know what I'm telling you because I've gone I'm going through the same thing you'll say look look at this is and I told them you know you're going to pray and pray and pray for your family your dad and at the same time see it's gonna come right in your ear and tell you you know your dad's not gonna make it or you and your family aren't going to make it and I told them but don't believe that don't listen to that stuff because even though you know your dad's had his struggles you know he's human like all of us and at the end you know he has a soul and I said that's uh just like me and my dad that's a soul that you need to win to the Lord and I said you know it's going to get tough and tougher and maybe you feel like you just want to give up maybe sometimes you really feel like it won't happen but that's when you get up is and you just dust yourself off and you say satanas it will happen because he's part of the Lord's plan God's plan and after that you know he just he really started just not like crying and crying but he was just tearing up really bad you know and he just said you know thank you brother for your testimony said it really really good so you know like I said just saying you know just your testimony you know it could really impact somebody you might not even know it is [Applause] foreign God bless you this evening you all look very beautiful this evening if we could please stand for the reading of God's word we're going to turn to the scripture uh Isaiah 43. is verses one and two verses any reason but now thus saith the Lord that created the order oh Jacob and he that formed thee foreign share a little bit about my experience and my experiences that followed after that is for those of you that don't know I was born and raised in Phoenix Arizona Phoenix Arizona I'm in this beautiful message that we have I wasn't technically brought up in this message you could say that I came from the outside the life that I was living was was not a good life at all but thank God that there was one day progress somehow the algun Manera in this thick head of mine that I have tengo and in such a cold heart that I had at the time I'll tell you there's nowhere that God cannot go yeah he put a fire so hot in my heart I could no longer ignore him uh to give you a little detail and background it was the year of 2017. many don't know this but at the time I was actually Afflicted with with the disease I mean the doctors told me that I had to be on medication the rest of my life um I went into a really bad dark depression yeah my wife at the time she was she was there every step of the way with me and there was just something that sparked in my heart in my mind when I was younger my grandma would always tell us the testimony of hers yeah and at this time it would come back to me over and over and over again she would always tell me about the time that she had cancer is and she was so proud when she would tell me this is she said mijo I went to the doctor one time they told me I had cancer medicine and I believe that I was healed she said I was healed and that always stuck with me so at the time living in Phoenix I would get online and watch Services it wasn't a coincidence the first service that I watched it was the very first message of restoration of the bright tree and I believe that's me um you know I gave my life to the Lord um I and I asked him I said Lord if you hear me I'll serve you the rest of my life but the funny thing is he said no you're going to serve me the rest of your life and I'm going to heal you um you know after I gave my life to the Lord and I moved here to Las Cruces um the battle wasn't over no terminal if anything it the battle got even more hot and heavy for him um I went through and I'm still going through many birth pains to this day there's a struggling nature inside of us that we battled daily yeah Paul says I Die daily daily we face this enemy uh the area and we know that brother Brown says that our greatest enemy is ourselves a man in Genesis 22 17 it reads and Genesis and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies like our pastor says that sounds real nice right you could read it and that gay so and I see Star presence the Gate of his enemies I'm going to read it like it's for me Sami Ronnie shall possess the Gate of his enemies hey man put your name there tonight and now we are more than conquered we just walk right into it as an inheritance more than conquerors now I love this part here now we are dealing with the defeated enemies sickness is defeated death is defeated hell is defeated everything is defeated says oh my this is I wish I was twice myself twice as good and now we are defeating with the disputed enemy we are defeating with a we're disputing with a conquered enemy estamos amen my question to you all tonight maybe you haven't died yet maybe there's a gate that's standing in your way I know that I'm not the only one that struggles I know there's many struggles and many of us have a gate with the name on it what's the name of your gate tonight the lord gave us the key to these Gates is your gate sickness what's the key to that so by his stripes Sammy's Hills Ronnie estanado is your gait anxiety or depression depression the joy of the Lord is my strength yes the joy of the Lord is Sami strength I went through a little uh just to give a short testimony these past couple weeks I actually went through a really bad uh I don't know what you would call it depression depression there was actually a tormenting spirit that was over me at the time and you know it's the little things that we leave out that keep these Spirits bound is I had talked to my pastor uh pastor and you know I was trying to get everything big out of the way to deal with this enemy or this gate but my pastor had told me Pastor to go make things right with a certain Persona and you know I'm scrambling here and there trying to deal with this every day and I'm putting that in the back burner in my mind at the end of the week I'm going down the list and I'm saying I did this this this is and the Lord tells me you forgot to do this here yes such a small thing but that small thing that I left out that small thing was keeping this nasty demon of Torment yes it was allowing it to stay around me and no matter how much I prayed how much I spoke to him he was there because there was a way for him to get in now uh Friday night the Deliverance service our pastor told us and challenged us so go make things right with anyone that you have wrong person he said or even if you know someone has something against you let's go make things right in that night I did that yes and I'm telling you church I felt such a Deliverance I've never felt such a freedom at the very moment that I made things right that spirit that demon has no more controller power over me so I'll make that same challenge to you tonight if there's something small in your way maybe the gate is small but that key is very simple tonight just take God at his words [Applause] thank you foreign thank you Lord let's turn to Ephesians chapter 2 and we'll start with verse 1. I'll read all the verses in English and then you can read them okay okay and it says and Aaron hathy quickened who was dead and trespasses and sins wherein times past Aaron walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that worketh now and the children of Disobedience among whom also Aaron had all his conversations and time passed in the lusts of his flesh fulfilling the the desires of the Flesh and of his mind and we're by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who was rich in Mercy for his love wherein he loved Aaron even when he was dead in sin hath quickened Aaron together in Christ by his grace Aaron is saved foreign foreign I'm just relying on the Lord right now but this thought came to me we're either gonna kill or we're going to be killed you know we have a real enemy that's out and it's good that we had the week-long services yes a lot of us died out to ourselves but that has to keep going now you see because Satan he don't care how how you come to church and how you start feeling good he's ready to attack you as soon as you get your blessing and you know the thought just came to me we've got to seal up the leaks in our lives how is it that we can come and we can get a blessing of God and before you know it the blessing is gone as quick as we got here and I believe it comes down to what we heard on Sunday Heavenly place isn't isn't just sitting here in church it's not when you young people come to youth meeting though it can be that but you can be in Heavenly places wherever you're at and it all comes down to having those three key elements that we heard about on Sunday Domingo who can tell me what has to be there in order for God to receive your worship there was three things we got temple temple alter Altar and the worshiper right t-a-w them they are yeah laughs yeah so you know I was thinking stop in sandal you know I was a little kid Como Nino I always used to feel like I didn't fit in anywhere um with my own family members with the other kids at school I didn't like to talk mucho and I just felt like there was something different about me and I remember when I'd be with all my cousins or whatever and we'd be you know playing or doing this for that I just always remember thinking like you can't do things that the other kids are doing [Music] and not that it was a bad thing or a good thing I just that's how I always felt and as I got a little bit older I remember I remember going to church on Wednesday nights and I think man why in the world was I born into this uh this message why do I have to come to church on Wednesday nights I used to love playing sports I remember my mom would pick me up from practice and I'd be changing in our our car on the way to church and I hated it I always thought man why can't I be like my friends and just be a Catholic Pennsylvania not that it's bad but I mean I would go to church with him and you uh should they wear casual clothes after church the parents would get together and drink and party is and the kids could just do whatever they wanted because their parents were all getting drunk no I thought man this was the family I was supposed to be born in I remember I had a friend named Noah and I always think man this I was supposed to be like this guy yes it is and they could go through live get away with whatever they wanted yes this is and before you knew it I was just living that same way I didn't want to Fellowship have fellowship with the mystery like we heard on Sunday I didn't care to be around the Youth of the church when we would have uh fundraisers I'd go hide so that my friends wouldn't see me outside of Walmart washing cars Amigos just to put it plainly from church the youth um and uh and it just stuck with me till I got older I mean I was probably a junior in high school yes and like I said I continue playing sports and just continuing besides me coming to church I was not a Christian I didn't care to serve God and one night I was uh I've had the day written down like it was in April our I just turned 18. oh I know it was the day that uh Saddam Hussein was killed and I was in a car accident I had uh pretty much stolen my mom's car without asking because I wanted to be the cool guy at prom and take a vehicle muchacho important wind up getting in a rollover car accident that it was that morning probably three four in the morning my mom gets a knock at the door and there's two police officers stand there was it too or yeah and they said yes are you or Charlotte Esquibel yeah and she said yes you'll see and they say well your son just been in a terrible car accident and he's in the hospital well on my end party I don't remember anything all I remember is waking up in the hospital my all my immediate family was around me crying and I didn't know how bad of a condition I was in you know I just remember trying to console everybody like no I'm gonna be okay and here I was all busted up my hair was all blown off from the airbag my brain was bleeding out and I remember just that ended up taking me to the hospital well long story short I ended up recovering I had to have a brain surgery I had a surgery on my brain and I thought man I'm I'm good to go so my senior year rolled around you thought I would have straightened myself out yeah no I probably got worse and what's crazy is I'll never forget I was sitting somewhere over here and I had just started coming back to church actually my whole family just started coming back to church Satan was just having his way in our lives it got to a point where we were just spiritually dead as a family and I believe brother Rod Rhodey was visiting one time and after he was done preaching brother Tommy Jr started song leading is and I just remember he said uh you know if the Lord has done something for you just stand to your feet and again I had never cried in church I never raised my hands I never did and that day man something just ignited in me and I stood to my feet and I just started raising my hands yesterday and I had never heard my parents really cry in church or my family like the whole family started crying and I believe that day I started dying yes but I wasn't completely dead and you know you all know that I'm a nurse and there's a process to dying and I'm talking more people who are terminally ill yes or somebody who's reached the end of life so like the first thing that happens is you'll see a change in their appearance their skin starts to change colors [Music] the next source is and then it becomes like a burden to even eat it's rather than a joy illegal is and so anyways I just got to a point where you know that happened and fast forward you know two years not even that change brother Caleb asked me shortly after you know would you like to start parking cars but I was still hanging out with friends in the world yet coming to church and parking cars I'm serving the lord I can go hang out with friends then all of a sudden one day I started having these seizures and those of you that have been around when it happens it was just uh it totally rocked my world because I went from being just completely normal what I thought was normal to the point where I couldn't go anywhere by myself there was just always this fear like uh yeah you're gonna die and that feeling followed me everywhere first thing when I woke up in the morning you know my mind I go to bed like am I going to wake up to see the next morning because they always came in my sleep so just imagine you're trying to get some nice good sleep and you just wake up and I feel like somebody's choking you is all you have is yourself and your thoughts and at first I thought man I'd rather be dead than have to go through this and I had a terrible attitude towards it is yes until one day I thought you know what I can either just be like this the rest of my life or I can choose to get real with God so what I started doing is simple I started hearing the message of the Inner Man and in there brother Brown tells us that there's a man on the inside who feeds on things of the spirit and it really clicked with me because I loved working out and it's simple like you go to the gym why because you want to get bigger you want to get your muscles to grow you want to put weight on yes but on the inside I was just a little anorexic shriveled up man I wasn't in any condition to fight anything you understand conditions and so what I started doing is just hearing messages looking businesses and I write them out word for Words the greatest battle ever fought I'd hear song Services I got to the point where I wanted to start singing and I'd never done any of that before but I started to find out that I there was a God who actually cared about me I learned about how I felt I found out I didn't have any friends oh I could say I had hundreds of friends people go in the shop all the time and say oh I knew Aaron and this and that but amigos amigos I didn't have one friend but I had Jesus Christ and once I just started to get a real true intimate relationship with him [Music] I'd wake up every morning I'd go sit outside just pray and it's something real yeah I talked to him like like I talked to my wife he's my first love is me perimetamor and when you get to a point in your life where God is so much higher he's jealous he don't want to be shared with anybody or anything else and if you want things to go right in your life get to the point where God's more important than anything and it sounds easier just to say but as a young people we want to do things life is so new to us and a lot of times they say like oh well they're just saying that because they're already old and they they got to have their fun businesses no the reason that we tell you guys these things is because the world scars you [Music] and it's simple Yes simply you know one of you all came up to me on Sunday and asked me what is the sin question what is it can somebody yes no it's actually simple just ask yourself do I find more joy in the things of God than the things of the world where are you getting your joy from Carlos preached a message on that one time if I'm still out looking in the world to find joy in this for that it just shows I don't have joy but when I have Christ when I have the joy of the Lord that I can go do those things that we like like basketball or football or college whatever you want to do basketball football and you're not looking to find joy in it something like to do to pass the time but uh I believe that's just where I'm gonna stop this evening but just know that man once you just give your life over to God stop running and you find your position as a Son of God you'll look at your life all the hard things you have to go through maybe it's sickness and you realize it was all that gets you to a point where you can help somebody else all those all that sickness I had to go through I never would have knew that God was a Healer and I not have made all the mistakes in my life I never would have known that he could save me and that I just I'm humbled people and I just stand here today as just a mortal man just telling you is about a God who can change your life and somebody online if you needed to hear that see again all you have to do is just open your heart he'll take you as you are hello but you won't stay that same way amen God bless you [Applause] thank you don't be sad because he is sweet Hallelujah will you
