[16:32] appreciated yes
[16:35] Psalms 119 verse 10.
[16:39] here the psalmist is saying
[16:46] with all my heart I have eyes
[16:50] let me not Wander from thy Commandments
[16:56] now let's go to Jeremiah 29
[17:01] Jeremiah 29 verse
[17:06] is 12 and 13.
[17:09] This is
[17:12] Jeremiah 29 12 and 13.

[17:34] is
[17:42] and ye shall seek me and find me
[17:45] porque
[17:47] when maybe
[17:51] search for me with all your heart
[17:56] Lord bring the controls
[17:59] that your Holy Spirit would lead us
[18:03] through prayer
[18:05] that we can have that correct
[18:09] to be able to enter into the spirit
[18:12] and have communion with you
[18:17] in the prayer in the name of the Lord
[18:19] Jesus Christ is our prayer
[18:22] please have a seat make yourself
[18:24] comfortable
[18:36] it was about this man that would tell
[18:38] his Pastor yes
[18:49] I can put rocks in this wheelbarrow and
[18:52] go and nothing will happen to me
[18:56] how many have heard the story
[19:05] I can also put you on that wheelbarrow
[19:08] and and go to the same road
[19:12] oh the Pastor said no no no wait a
[19:15] minute
[19:16] when it gets personal
[19:19] that's when things change
[19:22] when we speak about prayer
[19:26] and we don't speak that this is personal
[19:29] effect it will have no effect
[19:37] he recommends that the ministers
[19:40] that preach the gospel
[19:43] before speech
[20:05] let me open my heart to you a little bit
[20:09] and share something with you
[20:14] yeah we'll help you have a more intimate
[20:16] relationship with the Lord
[20:21] I love so much the character of David
[20:24] porque
[21:11] when he said to the Lord take not thy
[21:14] Holy Spirit from me
[21:15] he found something foreign
[21:36] in Psalms 119
[21:39] they say
[21:44] I have searched for you with all of my
[21:47] heart
[21:51] that my heart might not Wander from your
[21:54] Commandments
[21:58] importante has the most important part
[22:02] when we speak about prayer El Corazon
[22:05] the heart is
[22:13] that's what God has chosen for it to be
[22:15] his throne
[22:17] God is a holy God
[22:21] is the god of righteousness
[22:24] glows in your heart in my heart
[23:26] they will be in your favor
[23:41] those are the clean Hearts
[23:45] because they shall see God
[23:51] they shall see God
[23:54] what is that word see there means
[24:00] that's when you can have access
[24:03] face to face hold up
[24:07] to be able to see you face to face
[24:10] I have to have access
[24:17] because they shall see God
[24:20] they will have access to God
[24:24] they also have confidence with God
[24:27] it will have intimacy with God
[25:31] to be able to go into the spirit
[25:34] you can pray
[25:38] but if your heart is not right
[25:41] you will never see God foreign
[25:50] it seems like the more you pray
[25:53] those things go worse
[25:55] because the devil laughs at you
[25:59] because these are the keys the keys
[26:08] to be able to go into the spirit
[26:11] to go to hell
[26:13] and tell
[26:15] satanos lose my brothers
[26:20] sickness just get out of here
[26:26] if I can search my own heart
[26:30] and before you can have an audience with
[26:32] God
[26:35] I gotta find out if I have anything
[26:38] against anybody
[26:54] if your heart condemns you not
[26:57] confiance you have confidence with God
[27:01] I'm again my friend
[27:04] puedo better when I can see God
[27:09] just give me five more minutes
[27:13] you're gonna need maybe not tonight
[27:17] it's for all your life
[27:34] but Jesus
[27:39] because you have done what I have said
[27:42] he is my friend Amigo and now friends
[27:48] I like to walk with my friends
[27:51] and when I'm walking with my friends
[27:55] the problems my friend has
[27:58] problems
[28:01] because he's my friend
[28:04] yes maybe
[28:12] I can stop at any time in the day
[28:41] what is happening
[29:14] give me
[29:51] with this I'm going to finish
[29:59] deity of Jesus Christ there
[30:02] is
[30:12] I want you to understand the plan
[30:18] the Bible says
[30:52] those that are waiting
[31:02] because they could not enter in
[31:05] timidated and intimacy with God
[31:09] to be able to know his plan brother
[31:16] it's just the body of the Lord Jesus is
[31:19] the most sickest body
[31:21] we all claim to believe
[31:25] but when God sends the instrument
[31:30] when God is going to use the agent
[31:34] we rejected
[31:39] because our heart is not clean
[31:43] because your heart is not clean they say
[31:46] Jesus Jesus says
[31:52] the Kingdom of Heaven as a child
[31:56] as a child
[31:59] the children now fight yes
[32:03] playing with one another
[32:05] personal because the little children
[32:08] don't take it so personal
[32:11] the heart of the child is pure I played
[32:14] oh there's there's bitings among the
[32:16] little children
[32:18] but there's nothing that marks their
[32:21] heart
[32:22] brother Venom says
[32:30] a paragraph 97
[32:34] this is
[32:38] and today that's what's the matter with
[32:40] the church La Esperanza de Gloria the

[33:07] that you can get a hold of this is
[33:11] where the Holy Ghost comes foreign
[33:41] or something like that
[33:45] but that it is
[33:56] and giving you all the powers
[34:10] we are members of that body
[34:16] and you're in possession of anything
[34:18] that he's had
[34:22] it also is
[34:25] you're also in possession of the same
[34:26] thing
[34:28] it's also in you

[1:20:30] my chicken
[1:20:32] and everything seemed like it was okay
[1:20:36] the only thing that I had it was like a
[1:20:39] burning sensation that went from my hand
[1:20:41] all the way up to my shoulders
[1:20:47] the whole thing I just wanted to get
[1:20:49] home
[1:20:51] we had service that night
[1:20:54] and I kept telling myself
[1:20:59] if I could just get there
[1:21:03] he's the same yesterday today
[1:21:07] and I believe I'll be all right
[1:21:10] well I never got here
[1:21:14] it was a long night
[1:21:19] no feeling in my arm nothing yes
[1:21:25] stubborn as I am
[1:21:28] did not want to go see a doctor
[1:21:31] finally went to see the doctor
[1:21:36] long story short
[1:21:39] Caleb was praying here Sunday morning
[1:21:43] he felt
[1:21:46] he felt inspired to to pray for me that
[1:21:50] morning
[1:21:51] he says there where you're at just raise
[1:21:54] your hands
[1:21:56] and I did
[1:21:59] and uh the minute I raised my hands even
[1:22:02] before the prayer ended
[1:22:05] all the feelings just started to come
[1:22:07] back to my house
[1:22:14] so when I went back to work on Tuesday
[1:22:18] after electrician who wrote all the
[1:22:21] reports
[1:22:24] they're waiting for me
[1:22:26] and he says Abraham I I have some issues
[1:22:30] with what you're saying happened
[1:22:36] for 277 to hit you foreign
[1:23:14] keep sending jolts through you until it
[1:23:17] burns everything inside
[1:23:21] he started to go on about the laws of
[1:23:24] electricity
[1:23:26] and he started to tell me he says
[1:23:29] there's just no way
[1:23:36] you had to be kicked off
[1:23:42] a brand new Airman
[1:23:45] [Music]
[1:24:02] why in the world would you stand up
[1:24:07] he said your your vision towards the
[1:24:10] boxes is off
[1:24:52] since I was a young boy
[1:24:57] that protection of grace and mercy
[1:25:00] followed me everywhere
[1:25:03] and I started to tell the master
[1:25:05] electrician
[1:25:07] I sat here and told you all the times
[1:25:10] that the Lord has intervened infection
[1:25:13] has reached out to me and and changed my
[1:25:16] circumstances
[1:25:22] as I started to tell him he says you
[1:25:25] know you're not a religious man
[1:25:29] he says but I know there was something
[1:25:31] there with you
[1:25:33] just because I just can't make make
[1:25:38] any sense of what you're telling me
[1:25:42] that I had to question another Airmen
[1:25:46] the Airmen
[1:25:48] make sure that you weren't telling me a
[1:25:50] lie question
[1:25:54] but he says I have both the Airmen and
[1:25:57] your reports
[1:26:03] so this reminded me of a story of the
[1:26:07] Three Hebrew children in the fiery
[1:26:09] furnace
[1:26:13] I told him
[1:26:16] and I said in that fiery furnace
[1:26:21] as they begin to look upon that fiery
[1:26:24] furnace
[1:26:26] there was a Fourth Man In The Fire
[1:26:30] And I told him I said
[1:26:33] that Fourth Man
[1:26:35] was the one who good between me and
[1:26:38] death
[1:26:42] and I just wanted to share that with you
[1:26:46] I want to tell you that the same Lord
[1:26:49] God that was alive way back then
[1:26:55] he's producing the same exact works
[1:26:58] right here
[1:27:00] and I'm just so happy that I'm able to
[1:27:03] be here and give my testimony
[1:27:06] because according to all science to all
[1:27:10] everything that everybody looks at
[1:27:13] I should not be here right now
[1:27:16] and I want to thank the Lord for always
[1:27:18] intervening for me
[1:27:21] proving that he is in
[1:27:26] God bless you
