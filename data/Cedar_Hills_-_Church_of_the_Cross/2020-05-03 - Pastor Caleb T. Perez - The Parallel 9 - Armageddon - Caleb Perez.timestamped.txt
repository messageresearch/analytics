[4:10] they can only see a man but those
[4:14] predestinated seen God one saw a man the
[4:21] other saw God and it was God failed in
[4:27] the human being making both of a right
[4:29] but your faith in that what you don't
[4:31] see you believe it anything God fail in
[4:37] the human being he was in that flesh
[4:41] that flesh was his Veil the veil was
[4:44] ripped thing that God might be made
[4:46] manifest in the Old Testament God was
[4:49] hid when he was on his mercy seat on the
[4:54] mercy seat by a veil in the Old
[4:57] Testament God was in his temple but two
[5:01] people come in worship like this but
[5:03] remember there was a veil that hid God
[5:10] they know God was there they couldn't
[5:13] seem that pillar far never appeared
[5:16] anymore there did you notice there's not
[5:21] one time in the scripture from the time
[5:24] that pillar apart went in behind that
[5:27] Bailey never showed again to come from
[5:29] Jesus Christ
[5:33] cloud was veiled when he stood already
[5:38] set up I come from God and I go to God
[5:41] then Paul at his death burial and
[5:43] resurrection on his road to Damascus
[5:45] there was that pillar of fire what
[5:48] wasn't out from behind the veil floor
[5:52] even behind the veil now he's behind
[6:02] what skin veil they badger skins behind
[6:07] the veil and when that veil was rent on
[6:09] the day of crucifixion the veil that he
[6:13] was wrapped in was rent on the day of
[6:16] the crucifixion the whole mercy seat
[6:19] came into view now the Jews cannot
[6:21] understand how that God could have mercy
[6:25] upon a sinful foul people like we are
[6:28] but they couldn't see this one who was
[6:30] getting mercy because he was hid he was
[6:33] behind the mercy seat on the inside with
[6:37] badger skins hanging down covered him
[6:39] before it bit before if any man walked
[6:44] in behind that bale it was sudden death
[6:50] oh we're gonna get a lesson here in a
[6:54] matter you can't receive it the walk
[6:59] behind them skins even one of the
[7:02] priests nuns tried to do it one time and
[7:04] died don't go behind that veil the man
[7:09] that walked behind why there's no
[7:10] redemption yet and that is potentially
[7:12] it's just potential and anything
[7:15] potential is not the real thing in me
[7:18] just potentially it was Redemption
[7:20] seeing must covered not omitted remitted
[7:23] rather not remit 'add remitted is
[7:26] divorced and put away and so the blood
[7:28] of sheep and goats could not do that
[7:30] so Jehovah was hid behind a veil now
[7:38] back behind this veil or he was hid to
[7:41] enter into that a man drop dead to try
[7:43] to enter into it
[7:44] but since Pentecost since the
[7:47] crucifixion when that veil was rent from
[7:50] the top to the bottom for that
[7:52] generation Jesus was that God failed and
[7:59] when he died at Calvary God set fire and
[8:04] lightning and ripped that veil from top
[8:08] to the bottom that the whole mercy seat
[8:11] wasn't playing you but they were too
[8:14] blind to see it as Moses said here are a
[8:17] power set reading of Moses when Moses is
[8:19] read yet that they are still on their
[8:21] heart hold brother or sister that's what
[8:25] the Jews did when the veil was rent and
[8:27] from God in the pain to hang on the
[8:30] cross he wasn't playing you but they
[8:34] couldn't sit could it be possible to the
[8:38] Gentiles it hit the same thing
[8:39] Oh God when they've had the church ages
[8:43] of the son of God but when now the
[8:46] biggest denominations of these this veil
[8:50] of tradition that we've got since
[8:52] Pentecost when the church traditions has
[8:55] been whipped the things that the people
[8:57] said days of miracles is passing these
[8:59] things and God has tucked the bay off of
[9:02] it and brought it in plain you crucified
[9:06] again just exactly
[9:11] the unveil God plainview they should
[9:16] have seen him standing there yet he was
[9:19] too common he was an ordinary man they
[9:23] couldn't see it see there stood a man
[9:26] well they said this guy what scooter he
[9:28] come from but I remember when that spear
[9:31] stuck his body the spirit left him the
[9:36] temple of sacrifice blocks turned over
[9:40] and the Lightning went down to the
[9:43] temple in rent the veil Calvary and
[9:50] there were too blind to see had brought
[9:53] him an open view and still they don't
[9:55] see him there a blind God been healed in
[10:00] a human being you remember he returns
[10:02] and the pall add to that and the Peter
[10:05] in the prison as a pillar of fire
[10:07] remember then but in the last days he's
[10:11] supposed to return again but a pillar of
[10:14] fire is supposed to come back again to
[10:16] manifest the Son of Man the show the
[10:21] word why the traditions has been will be
[10:25] wiped away there's nothing going to
[10:26] bother it's going to be done anyhow God
[10:30] just chair them denominations and
[10:32] traditions down what kind of spirit will
[10:34] they do it like you did in the first
[10:35] place look what he done the days of
[10:37] Elijah the days of John don't you think
[10:39] to say that yourself you have Abraham to
[10:42] the Father cause God's able of these
[10:43] stones to rush Sunday for him do you
[10:45] think cause I belong to this not belong
[10:47] to that God tearing off the veil see the
[10:52] show who you watch the veil when it
[10:55] rents here now let me fly down now
[10:59] one time if the name walked through that
[11:02] veil it was sudden death yes death not
[11:05] to go through it
[11:07] Amen if you can't break that veil of
[11:11] tradition break through that wall of
[11:13] denomination to see God in his power
[11:18] it's dead once were it was death to go
[11:23] in now it's death to stay out the whole
[11:25] mercy seat set in plain view anybody can
[11:30] see it the veils rim glory to God
[11:33] old mercy seat comes into plain view how
[11:38] God could have mercy on foul sinners as
[11:41] us when he hid himself was a mystery and
[11:45] now I said planed you are in full view
[11:48] revealed by his word it's always the
[11:52] word constantly that is God it's a word
[11:55] that opens it up if those people to know
[11:57] the Word of God that day when Jesus died
[11:59] there to seen the mercy seat they would
[12:02] have seen who he was who has that then
[12:05] why did the BAE Arendt remember his
[12:08] death - going - nobody could see it
[12:10] Moses saw it in a farm it was a world of
[12:12] it was a man's back well here it is a
[12:16] bleeding back that same man what wasn't
[12:19] God wanted to show them the mercy seat
[12:22] God wanted to show him who he was
[12:25] so the veil of the temple from the hand
[12:27] of God above was ripped from top to the
[12:30] bottom and showed God it blamed you it
[12:32] was Jesus Christ hanging on the cross
[12:35] the mercy seat and what was it the
[12:38] people were too blind to see now it's
[12:42] repeated again the traditions how
[12:44] they'll all the day of Pentecost the
[12:46] word came and was in a form of son of
[12:49] God and they began to organize didn't I
[12:51] see a Roman the first thing he went to
[12:53] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[12:54] Pentecostals and so forth it's organized
[12:56] tradition - men don't know where he
[12:58] stands gourds of God he promised in the
[13:02] last days what he would do
[13:05] he would show his wordid playing view
[13:08] open before us to him open up if they'd
[13:12] only know the word that have known who
[13:14] Jesus was if a man only know the Word of
[13:17] God he had know the hour we're living
[13:19] and what's going on they just refused to
[13:22] listen to that word their traditions
[13:25] what caused those Jews to see that what
[13:28] God look like they could actually see
[13:30] because the thing was tore open it was
[13:32] tore open for a purpose
[13:34] what's history but I haven't gone far
[13:36] now how could it prosper how could it be
[13:40] blessed I don't care how many
[13:41] impersonations of Scott or anything else
[13:44] at all when Moses went out there's a
[13:45] mixed multitude went with you but what's
[13:49] it done for its Jehovah himself taking
[13:53] the Bale off of God show the difference
[13:56] between right and wrong which is
[13:58] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian who's
[14:00] riding God's Word is right that every
[14:04] man's word be aligned mind the truth God
[14:07] needs no interpreter he does his own
[14:09] interpretation he manifests it to make
[14:12] it gives the interpretation God
[14:15] unveiling yourself o ride in the midst
[14:20] of us we see these great hand telling
[14:23] these things you say got something on
[14:25] that tonight think of how to watch the
[14:27] hand of God what it does how it unfolds
[14:30] itself seeing people say oh that's
[14:32] nonsense that's fanaticism there there's
[14:35] nothing to that that's nonsense
[14:37] that's dlz but that's a devil that's
[14:39] fortune-telling yes this see the same
[14:41] thing they said about him
[14:42] Oh church and if this tape goes out
[14:45] can't you see ministers of the gospel
[14:47] where you're living case you see that
[14:50] our that we're in God showing himself
[14:56] setting aside look he took that temple
[14:59] veil and tore to pieces that they might
[15:01] see God in plain view and there was too
[15:04] blind to see it and he's done the same
[15:07] thing today
[15:11] putting his word right out in front what
[15:13] he promised ever promised in the word
[15:15] lien right divorce in plain view
[15:17] you know what the Gentile Church stuff
[15:18] the same thing the Jewish Church did too
[15:20] blind to see that's all it'll be on
[15:23] their hearts just as it was in that day
[15:25] notice best to stay away from it now you
[15:29] must go into it through this veil or you
[15:32] won't
[15:32] how God could have mercy on them but
[15:34] remember what it was that God is
[15:37] manifesting what was behind that veil
[15:39] watch what was behind the veil the word
[15:44] what did it they'll the word what was it
[15:48] is in the ark it was the word that that
[15:52] veil hid and Jesus was that word and he
[15:58] is that word and the veil of his flesh
[16:01] hidden and today the veil of tradition
[16:04] hides a word against and it's not so but
[16:08] it is so God's testifying of it
[16:10] blasting itself right out as bright as
[16:12] the Sun before everyone and if you ever
[16:15] see a man your heart it being merciful
[16:18] and tight
[16:20] Moses coming from the presence of God
[16:23] with the Word of God for that age now
[16:26] watch we're now in Exodus 19
[16:29] don't miss this now that Exodus 19 Moses
[16:34] is coming from the presence of God or 22
[16:37] 21 20 19 20 21
[16:39] Moses is coming from the presence of God
[16:42] he has been into the word the words been
[16:46] wrote and he in the presence of God with
[16:51] the word he had the word for that age
[16:55] there's a word for each age and Moses
[17:00] coming forth his face shouted so see the
[17:05] word was in him ready to be manifested
[17:09] give out to the people the true word God
[17:13] had wrote it and it was with Moses
[17:18] notice it was with Moses and was ready
[17:21] to be manifested
[17:23] he was the word to them he was a living
[17:26] word hid bailed himself Moses had to put
[17:31] a veil over his own face why he was that
[17:36] word amen
[17:39] until that work was made known Moses had
[17:41] to bail himself wherever the word is
[17:51] it's failed Moses have the word remember
[17:58] after the workers made manifest Moses
[18:01] and Moses again but while that word was
[18:05] in him to be give out he was God well he
[18:10] wasn't Moses no more he had the word of
[18:13] the Lord for that age nothing could
[18:16] touch him that was over had that word
[18:19] with him
[18:20] so therefore when he come to people
[18:21] turned their heads they couldn't
[18:23] understand they've been changed he was a
[18:26] different fella you come with that word
[18:29] and he put a veil the Bible said over
[18:31] his face for he had the word he was the
[18:34] word to them hello if Moses oh brother
[18:39] here's going to be an insult but of
[18:42] Moses as Paul said here in 2nd
[18:44] Corinthians the 3rd chapter if Moses had
[18:50] the bailius faced with that type of
[18:53] glory a phony see because that was
[18:56] natural glory that was a natural law and
[18:59] of Moses knowing that that law had to
[19:02] perish but the glory was so great that
[19:04] invited the people so they had to put a
[19:06] veil over his face how much more will it
[19:10] be
[19:14] spiritual blinded people that glory was
[19:20] to fade away but this story won't fade
[19:24] away see Moses had the carnal laws the
[19:30] condemnation no grace no that has
[19:32] condemned you
[19:33] but this we're speaking about that had
[19:36] no pardon that just told you what you us
[19:40] this gives you a way out and when that
[19:43] word is unveiled
[19:44] Oh what kind of face will it be he'll
[19:48] have to be veiled it's got to be they
[19:50] gonna notice so the Spirit is veiled in
[19:56] a human temple see he to speak the
[20:00] natural words with a natural veil now
[20:04] Paul speaking here and in this this
[20:07] sense the spirit word we are ministers
[20:12] not of the letter the law but able
[20:15] ministers are the spirit that the Spirit
[20:19] takes the letter and manifest it that
[20:22] was just slow you had to go look and say
[20:24] thou shalt not commit adultery thou
[20:25] shalt not steal thou shalt not lie thou
[20:27] shalt not do this there the other thing
[20:30] you had to look at that but this is
[20:33] spirit that comes up on the promise word
[20:36] for this age and brings forth and
[20:40] manifests about two tables of stone but
[20:44] the presence of the Living God not a
[20:48] mythical thought somebody made up or
[20:50] some Houdini a trick but the very
[20:53] promise of God revealed and made
[20:56] manifest right before us what sort of
[20:59] available that be back into the lose a
[21:05] key that was so great to even the people
[21:07] said they said when they see Jehovah
[21:09] come down this pillar and fire and begin
[21:11] to shake the earth and and the things he
[21:13] done then will about long far and even
[21:15] if anybody tried to go to that mountain
[21:18] perished it was so great even
[21:22] is feared the quake that if that firm he
[21:26] shook just the mountain this time he'll
[21:30] shake heaven earth what about this glory
[21:34] if that was failed by our natural veil
[21:37] this is there a veil by a spiritual day
[21:40] so don't try to look at the natural
[21:41] break into the spirit and see where
[21:43] you're at
[21:48] does it make sense to you it's a
[21:52] spiritual veil it's over the people
[21:54] think I'm Methodist I'm as good as
[21:55] anybody
[21:56] I'm badness I'm Pentecostal don't you
[21:59] realize if that thing is a traditional
[22:02] veil it's hiding God from you that's the
[22:09] things that keeps you from enjoying oh
[22:10] boy say I shout and jump up and down he
[22:12] said every word he believed every word
[22:15] but one thing it's the full Word of God
[22:19] the promise of this hour made manifest
[22:23] notice now as we go on got plenty here
[22:26] to speak of it I got about 20 pages but
[22:29] it of notes but I I just want to speak
[22:32] on them all see a hurry
[22:34] he is veiled by the natural veil before
[22:37] he could speak the word to the people
[22:39] now God has to Bailey step as he
[22:42] promised in human flesh God do you get
[22:47] it
[22:47] God has to Bailey self in human flesh
[22:50] and put a spiritual available room say
[22:54] well I'm this and I'm that in order to
[22:56] speak to the people when that's avail
[22:58] which is the traditional veil is tore
[23:01] apart then the that what they see while
[23:03] the days of miracles is passed a guy
[23:05] said to me the other day a little
[23:07] Baptist preacher out there come to me
[23:08] brother green and he said brother
[23:10] Branham here's one thing I got a kiss
[23:12] she said you're trying to make the
[23:14] people is down through the Ramada Inn
[23:15] when we hear the meeting I said you're
[23:17] trying to make the people believe in an
[23:18] apostolic age to live today like they
[23:20] were in their first all occasion said
[23:22] that apostolic aids ceased with the
[23:24] Apostles I said it did yeah I said who
[23:28] was a spokesman in the Apostolic age he
[23:31] said that Twelve Apostles in the upper
[23:33] room and I said then Paul was out
[23:35] I said the spokesman was Peter and Peter
[23:41] said on a day of Pentecost when they
[23:44] seen all this going on and holy goes
[23:46] where he said the promise isn't to you
[23:48] and to your children and to them it's
[23:50] far off even as many as the Lord our God
[23:52] shall ever call if he's still calling
[23:55] then the same thing is sure when did
[23:58] they have a Stalag age ceasing the
[24:01] Apostolic age ceases when God ceases to
[24:03] call never said a thing but picked up
[24:06] his hat and walked away it takes the
[24:08] word to do it it's a word Jesus told
[24:12] Satan it's written that's it it's
[24:15] written I said Peter said that it would
[24:18] never end as many as the Lord called
[24:19] this best thing was far now you say you
[24:21] stopped when no hard I said well sir
[24:26] Peter said that it was for everyone God
[24:29] would call for would receive the same
[24:31] apostolic blessing that's that's the
[24:34] word of the Lord
[24:34] see now the natural veil God the word
[24:38] veil in human flesh
[24:39] what was it God was bailing Moses God
[24:43] was in Moses failed in the presence of
[24:46] God was any he was so perfect for that
[24:48] word a mic actually had to Bailey's face
[24:49] and it was a vindicated prophet that
[24:52] unfolded the word and told him I shall
[24:54] not that I shall I shall not see to give
[24:57] his word to that generation he bailed
[25:01] himself in a human being or the word
[25:04] would have blinded even the called out
[25:08] see even the people that was out there
[25:11] they could not stand to see that in
[25:13] Exodus we find that they said let Moses
[25:15] speak not gone see why the pillar far
[25:19] don't appear too much
[25:22] God said how do that I'll raise him up a
[25:24] prophet hey I'll raise him up one and he
[25:29] came all right and he'll head be the
[25:32] word he said if they want to see what
[25:34] the word is and I'm Moses I appeared you
[25:36] are a burning bush so I'm gonna come
[25:37] down and set that pill on the fire they
[25:39] don't see that you've told the truth
[25:41] I'll appear here what the st. burning
[25:44] way I'll appear you're improved to the
[25:45] people I love vindicate your ministry
[25:47] that's what he told Moses here
[25:50] so many words noticed he said nah I'm
[25:53] gonna Matt I'm gonna glorify you before
[25:55] the people said now you told him and I
[25:57] met you out there in a burning bush now
[25:58] I'm going to come down same bar now I'm
[26:00] gonna let the people see that you never
[26:01] lied about it
[26:02] I mean scientifically proven even if you
[26:04] want to see I'm going to come right down
[26:06] a little go and when he begin to thunder
[26:08] once your all's started thunder the
[26:11] people said no no no don't let Jehovah
[26:13] speak will Perdue he'll die see he had
[26:17] to be bailed so God bailed himself in
[26:21] Moses and give Moses the word and Moses
[26:24] come down and spoke the word of the Lord
[26:27] and a veil over his face all right
[26:30] Jehovah failed in the form of a prophet
[26:34] calls it were absolutely and claude said
[26:36] he wouldn't speak to them any more like
[26:38] that he would only speak to him by a
[26:40] prophet that's only way he'd ever speak
[26:42] from then on that's the only way he's
[26:43] ever spoke that's right
[26:45] never any other way notice only moses
[26:50] had the word now there was a group came
[26:53] down there wasn't just the pharisees of
[26:56] the Sadducees or it wasn't a certain
[26:58] sector clan it was Moses he got one man
[27:04] he can't get two or three different
[27:06] minds he takes one man Moses had the
[27:11] word and Moses alone Joshua even didn't
[27:16] have it no one else had hey man Joshua
[27:22] was a general Joshua was a commander in
[27:26] the army Joshua was a believer a

[53:18] [Music]
[53:20] I greet you in the precious name of our
[53:25] Lord Jesus Christ my brothers and
[53:27] sisters I thank God for this opportunity
[53:30] he has given to me through our pastor
[53:33] courage to speak a few words of
[53:36] testimony to you first of all I want to
[53:39] thank God so much for the way he has
[53:42] kept you all during this time when the
[53:48] pandemic the coronavirus comedy 19 is
[53:51] affecting the whole world as we thank
[53:55] God by the way he has taken care of his
[53:58] bride as he promised she'll never here
[54:02] to take care of his own I found God
[54:05] first of all for the world that he has
[54:09] given to us in this day through our
[54:11] pastor carob and all the ministers that
[54:14] are around him this way we are always
[54:19] able to tune in online and I really want
[54:23] to thank God for those brothers behind
[54:25] the machines to see that we are able to
[54:27] receive these services online may God
[54:30] bless them so much it's such a blessing
[54:33] to us that we are able to hear the word
[54:35] mainly during this time when the world
[54:38] is in a crossroads when everything is
[54:42] outcome is confused up with thank God
[54:45] that we can still hear the voice of God
[54:48] in our day and when we hear the word of
[54:51] God that's where our strength is that's
[54:55] where our faith is we get encouraged
[54:58] then we know where we are at and we are
[55:01] not you know then Passard like the world
[55:04] is puzzled because he has revealed his
[55:07] will to us and we know where we are
[55:10] exactly at and I really found God for
[55:12] those ministers may God bless them so
[55:15] much they are such a blessing to us I
[55:19] want to give it God a testimony for the
[55:23] great things he has done many during
[55:25] this time though if I had time I would
[55:29] go
[55:30] right from the beginning but I want to
[55:32] say God has been such gracious to us
[55:35] here in Uganda right from the time the
[55:38] revival broke out the way God has used
[55:42] you brothers to stand behind a bride of
[55:46] Jesus Christ to support the work of the
[55:49] Lord I don't have words to explain it
[55:52] all
[55:53] I already robust economy that if I could
[55:56] borrow another leverage somewhere to be
[55:58] able to describe to explain to someone
[56:01] what God has done through you to the
[56:04] bread of Jesus Christ and what God is
[56:06] doing in this country I could but since
[56:10] we are still in this motor body we are
[56:14] limited but like the Prophet said one
[56:17] day the greatest statement that a monta
[56:19] man can speak to a mountain man is God
[56:22] bless you I'll say I'll start by saying
[56:25] god bless you for whatever you've done
[56:28] to the bride of Jesus Christ if I come
[56:32] to this time I'll say it's amazing it is
[56:38] supernatural the way God has really
[56:41] helped his children I remember one time
[56:44] when they had just announced the
[56:46] lockdown and I was hearing pastor Qaeda
[56:49] preaching in one of the series of
[56:51] parallel and he mentioned and said
[56:53] please pray for the brothers in Africa
[56:56] that God will multiply the food on the
[56:59] table oh my god I'll tell you God Hornet
[57:04] that prayer and when they you know when
[57:07] they looked down on the whole country
[57:10] and no moving out no up everybody was
[57:13] like oh god what are we going to do you
[57:16] know I hope only remain in God I'm sorry
[57:20] isn't God so brothers we know what to do
[57:24] in how we are going to go through it all
[57:26] but we trusted God in all I found God
[57:30] because down through the rock down you
[57:35] know when people are not working here it
[57:37] is very tricky
[57:39] yeah maybe in Uganda people always win a
[57:45] meal when they go out to work a day so
[57:48] if they don't work it is very hard but I
[57:51] found God that in such a time of trouble
[57:55] the scripture sounds for the six verse
[57:58] one has come to pass
[58:00] really God is our strength God is our
[58:03] refugee present halt in the time of
[58:06] trouble God has used you so much my
[58:10] brothers and sisters to be such a
[58:12] blessing to us
[58:13] I want to thank you so much for what
[58:15] you've done for the bride here during
[58:18] this time thank you for all the support
[58:20] that you have sent there's one time when
[58:23] one of the families brother poured me
[58:26] was a pastor and he was just shedding
[58:28] tears he didn't know what to do
[58:30] the family had spent days without any
[58:32] food but shortly after pastor Kariba
[58:35] calls me and says God has provided
[58:38] something and when I caught back his
[58:40] brother and told them that God has
[58:42] provided something they just broke into
[58:45] tears of joy and this is what God is
[58:47] doing for us I don't have enough words
[58:49] to explain it all but God bless my
[58:52] brothers and sisters for all that you
[58:54] have done and that you've always done
[58:56] for us may God bless you so much I will
[59:00] say that if I look the way board has
[59:03] reeled out with the bride during this
[59:05] time supporting her his current
[59:07] spiritually
[59:08] I only will say like the Prophet said
[59:12] one time you know everything can fall
[59:16] apart but God is Kingdom whenever fall
[59:18] apart the economy of the world is locked
[59:20] but God is economy's not locked God's
[59:24] kingdom is not locked I'll just finish
[59:27] my reading for you a quote here in the
[59:31] book preached by in 1962 that is the
[59:36] falling apart of the world a prophet
[59:38] saying so when this word falls apart we
[59:41] are born into a kingdom that cannot fall
[59:44] apart you believe the world is falling
[59:46] apart is systems
[59:48] falling apart do you believe that you
[59:50] believe the economical system is falling
[59:53] apart the political system is falling
[59:55] apart the National UN system is falling
[59:58] apart
[59:59] the church is falling apart the
[1:00:01] denominations are falling apart
[1:00:03] everything is falling apart but we got a
[1:00:06] kingdom that cannot be moved it is a tan
[1:00:08] kingdom of God it cannot be moved and
[1:00:11] that's why we belong I cannot say much
[1:00:14] more but God bless you for choosing you
[1:00:17] to be such a blessing to us and I can't
[1:00:19] forget to say God bless our founding
[1:00:21] pastor pastor Peres Sania for the love
[1:00:24] he had for Africa and that love has been
[1:00:27] displayed through you to us may God
