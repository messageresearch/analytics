ready yeah the pastor called me yesterday yeah how when he killed me how are you feeling this is I know I'm gonna minus a second I feel good yeah man I I might be look old but uh anyways it is good to be with you people as we wanted to start consideres Mi Pueblo we're going to have a change of pace tonight because in the weekend you're going to have a lot of preachers even here the young ministers that we have here they can preach circles around me I have another calling so remember when there used to be panels in Wednesday's here it'll be a panel tonight and you say well the panels are three or four guys up here you know that Moses conquered Egypt by himself I am the one I don't that I'm going to have upon me yes I thought thank you anyway and uh living in Silver City I heard there's no bound over there let us this evening and the as you see the the title of my message announcer to the Lord the Lord and the subtitle is the verb and adverbs Isaiah 19 19. is in that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt and a pillar at the border of the Earth to the Lord the Lord had his Blessing to the arena of the world you may be seated and uh and the pastor were talking yesterday he mentioned uh says but you know that the United States needs more missionaries so when I got home I kept thinking so the United States needs more missionaries verse 4 Universal cuatro these are the generations of the heavens plural Esther San Los originales De Los Cielos plural because here he is not Elohim no more Elohim here he is Jehovah the one that exists with his family existed Familia God had provided everything for his family he even planted them a garden unless then he said let us make man in our image but in the image Adam had no fellowship with the animals and they belong to him yes I don't want to lose you pay close attention attention so God made a home for the image and he made it out of the ground but Satan came down and he found we can see in the serpente and the serpent was made out of the same material it is foreign but we find out that Adam and Eve lost their inheritance and they became homeless because brother Venom said that God was a great contractor and he had all my materials there in the beginning says I was there this is contract Satan wanted to have a kingdom and he took away the inheritance from Adam and he took control of the Building Material Company you can see he put Lucifer and his sons the imps is that is why you were born and I were born in sinus and you must be born again Genesis 4 11 and this is from the earth which has opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hands maldito says when thou kills the ground it shall not hand sport yield unto thee her strength a fugitive and a vague abundant shall thou be in the Earth there was few and me is dead yes so for you [Music] there is a huge difference between a house that's why we were fugitives and wonders you never came to Earth in a home the only one that came to Earth in a home we're done casa follow me closely you give me the circus he is the only one that came in the image of God yes and the reason that you did not come in a home but in a house because Satan owned the building materials amen so if Satan supplied the minerals materials and gave you a house because this body is not made in the image of of a God where is your body is notice you have a hand like a monkey a food like a bear himself if you get a small bear you take the hide off and put him next to a human being they look almost the same because we were made in the image of a beast and Adam there was his uni what was that Adam there was his duty to lead the animals remember we were homeless when we were in the world we exhibited three stages if I would tell you how honest you are and if you pass through the whole three stages for three stages I'm not saying you until the three stages foreign but after I uh no I'm not gonna embarrass you no no no that's why I'm very concerned says I won't throw you under the bus I might throw you out the window no no no no no no no anyway and those mothers all of you that like to drink whatever collector you drink ing oh you drink a few beers or whatever and you start telling jokes you have a lot of jokes during the stage of a monkey and then you start drinking more and more and then you think that you're Mike Tyson local princess Mike Tyson I can whip every one of you here in this building you get into the stage of a lion and then you start drinking some more Mike okay oh we're over there oh my goodness you're in the state of a pig you're throwing up and just three stages of all of others like to drink but like then he said that man is dead he does not exist anymore he left in a house but thank God we got a home now amen amen Satan became the prince of the power of the years and he won the victory Victoria but no man could see into glory and like I said we had a house but not a home because when sin was committed in the garden oh heavens were shut off from Mankind and when the law go there went out of God in the beginning he did not come down he was made lower than the angels and he came down and took the form of a bondsman foreign so what is what is a a bondsman yes someone who takes responsibilities foreign needles but the son of man has no place so he came down to make a way for homeless men and women like you and me yo we were wonders Saint Luke 9 57 San Lucas and it came to pass that as they went in the way a certain man said unto him Lord I will follow thee where Peters whoever thou goeth yeah and Jesus said unto him the foxes have fold and birds of the year of Nest but the son of man has nowhere to lay his head is and he said unto another follow me but he said Lord suffer me first you go and bury my father is can you see this why we lived in a house and we did not have a home because we worried more about the that the family and the things that in the world and what does the scripture says Let the dead bury the dead next scripture and another one said Lord I will follow thee but let me first go beat them farewell which are at home in my house and Jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is Faith for the kingdom of God is so what did God do into the case Studios he stressed his tent is from being Jehovah to become men Emmanuel leaving the house for a home God stretched his terms and gave us a home and he got a home tomorrow Perez put your name notice he can say Saint John 1 1 San Juan Uno Uno in the beginning was the verb in the verb was with God and the verb was God you see in Spanish he does say the verb is verse 14. and though the verb was made flesh and dwelt amongst us so notice verse 1 is the verb es el variable verse 14 verse because he's see the verb was made flesh we're talking about the verb and the adverbs you know what Jacob when I was going to high school I did not like the course of English I think I hate it you know we were stubborn not knowing that later in life you would need all of this animals so we learned about all these punctuations so now we're learning about the verbio Vero I told you it was going to be a panel because you're gonna have a lot of preaching during the weekend so I want you to learn this evening Hey Brother Abraham is giving us an English lesson yeah I'm not trying to boast you know I'm going to school mostly I was Australian students and then I went to high school and I I was kind of lazy and I got one leg at Ace for the one-legged eight take one legal Avenue it was true as we would go to a church as young people Jesus we want to see Mary remember I mean say that to anyone you know say the truth but like Danny said that man already leap in a house thank God he's got a home now amen amen ad signifies Direction and it modifies the verb because it changes the form of a morphism I know I got to say what does morphine and all that means I know I have some of you in suspenders but pay attention and you learned Genesis 14 verse 18. king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God is and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abram of the most high God processor of Heaven and Earth is not the verb he was the Earth it was the verb it is let's go a little further okay the word More film the problem it is a transformation as una transformation from the image of one object into another how if you go to revelation chapter one apocalypse is one like the son of man they say was it was there by the Candlestick is that one a verb or red verb yes okay let me give you another scripture because I know some of you are not getting it it's a problem first test you don't have to turn for it says the Lord himself shall defend from heaven with a shout yes so I asked the question who descended the verb or the adverbio we morpheme and More theme it brother says he came down in morphejo come from the word more films it was someone just like him and it was the verbio so but you can understand there you know what we had more problems with ministers in that in that scripture than almost any other stuff because still still a lot of ministers Muslim ministers worldwide believe that there is Jesus Christ the coming down when we know that the heavens must retain him until the restoration of all things so the one that came was the adverbs Direction what does it expression it expresses time Express place so God said let us make at the adverbs and he will have control and Authority here on Earth and notice that in Genesis he can say in kinesis he the Lord said he will have my name what was the name of God tell us nowhere well did Moses says well who is said sending me Andrea hello um you're looking at me strange Bruce what was the name of God oh my god oh yeah tell him Elijah Elias thank you he's telling the I am send you your soul so then Adam had his name is the same name is so in the beginning when he made the Stars the Planet Las planetas the constellations he was making the first Bible which is the name of the first Bible was what is Mariah huh thank you gracias Co because he was in the office of fatherhood okay and man always looks up and the Zodiac starts with the constellation of Virgo or virgin La constellation primero in zodiaco is it's the first coming is and it ends with a constellation of Leo the Lionel and Leon the second coming God declares things in heaven just declaration before he does on Earth and all their Heavenly hosts it always not one of them is other places every one of them keep its time perfectly and disrupted the whole plan of god notice the verb and the adverbs God the verb had given them the adverb of prophets to the first Bible propheta job 9 7. siete which commendeth the sun it trusted not and seal this up the Stars can you make it he put a seal through the Stars which alone spreaders of the heavens and prayers upon the waves of the sea is Del Mar which make it a tourists Orion and Pleiades in the chambers of the South here is in the planets because he was the dead Prophet is you know can stop buying the sweet influences of the plei 80s or lose the bells of Orion Orion can thou bring forth Nazareth in his season Arkansas guide our tourists with his sons Tierra but they were [Music] disobedientes and God had to destroy them so God gave them another prophet this Isaiah 1919 again in their day shall there be announcer to the Lord foreign mama Zoe Zoe in history who made that altar where are you that thing helper destiny gorilla huh thank you enough Enoch Enoch their altar was like a pyramid that he not made remember it was made to the Lord there was a second Bible yes amen and that altar yes altar was put in the center of the earth and it it was powerless with the first Bible is aligned with three stars it was called the belt of Orion the Orion absolutely what is the absolute in the sky absolutely somebody again what is the absolute in the sky yes if I look at them they get scared I thought that that Spirit had passed away because they used to get scary in theater Hills remember scary if I start walking through the eyes I anybody the North Star is thank you gracias amen amen the absolute is the North Star is the only star that doesn't move and the chef in the king's chamber is he said that it was the pathway into the heavens that the pyramid had a 144 000 cases is in that Bible is 144. revelation 21. apocalypse is 21 15. and either talking with me had a golden Reed to measure the city and the grace thereof in the world and the city's last Foursquare the pyramid is Foursquare and the length is as large as the bread he and he measures the city with the Reed 12 000 furlongs is in 12 000 prolonged 144 000. they say because the pyramid is tuned to the Earth magnetic frequency is an effect of the people around it is so the pyramid means a measure of light causing ancient times when they originally built the pyramids it would shine at night you know why pyramid is covered with polished Jews I wonder how long those groups lasted before the thieves tolerance the pyramid is a Bible is foreign I like to read books and and [Music] you know I have a home now in the message so you see where we learn this message these Mysteries estos mysterious have been hid understood Escondido since the foundation of the world waiting for the manifestation of Abraham Paris Esperanto La manifestation [Music] waiting for the manifestation of the sons that don't live in a house but live in a home Pickens it they're waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God to display them to the church I am displaying them right now to you studies originalismo the Ark of the Covenant Del pacto have the same measurements is a stone copper in the king's chamber okay or you don't know that the copper is means the coffin oh the inner chamber of the temple where the holy of holies words you see how it goes together because the great Granite sarcophagus is a was in direct alignment with a down-powering ray of cosmic life cosmica through the shaft that was pointing to the North Stars and in the king's chamber in a camera Del Rey it was a great force centered since Granite is saturated with minute crystals and the voltage came from that incredible Cosmic form this Granite inside the king's chamber granitos they came from Mount Sinai been on Del Monte where Moses got the Ten Commandments that is why the priest to her church the war protective garments charged with cosmic power that was cosmica there had to be in harmony we can say Crystal Crystal to maintain its potency each Ark had to be constantly recharged with a Creative Energy [Music] of tremendous voltage and the principle source is foreign energetically you are electric instead is electrical do you have electricity inside of you is foreign [Music] generating a charge of almost two volts at a specific frequency [Music] for that Organo you are more than simply an electrical being electrical the electricity there are produced by our bodies let me tell you this evening without their electricity flowing through your body could not read the Bible Korea you couldn't read the Bible because your brain will not work eat that one um Home Alone everything is made up of atoms and since our bodies are huge masses of atoms so Grandes masses the atomos we can generate electricity electricity and Adams are made up of protons there's a positive charge positivo are made up of neutrons neutronis that's a natural charge this is made up of electrons the electronics it's a negative charge so the atoms can carry a positive or A negative terms by gaining or losing electrons so the flow of electrons between the atoms electronics that is what we call electricity the scientists the syntheticos agree is that your body when it's at rest can produce a hundred watts of power siento is in other words you have enough power you have enough electricity unless you die you have enough electricity in your body that you can get a life buckle and make it like yeah see the scientists prove that losiniticus and you would like to jog or go sprinting you can have the ability to Output 2 000 watts of power in your body is remember the ones that carried the arka they had to be recharged and we carry electricity but let me warn you that like if you buy one of those electric cars they wouldn't do you no good is that companies well I couldn't afford one area it takes Quentin almost 26 000 years and it's called the precession of the equinoxes of which the Earth Transit Transit through 12 signs of the zodiac for Las doses did we just read it job prophesied are tourists with his sons our tourists our tourists was Jacob and his 12th song is so then the notice he can say the Sun as he goes around it takes 12 000 years on each son or the Earth twelve thousand years and so to go around it takes all these years there is a black hole in the middle of the Milky Way so everybody has seen it and the sun will cross the Milky Way right in the middle of the black hole negro and it will form a Celestial cross celestial it'll be the first time in 26 000 years and the conversion was on the sign of Leo the Lion he is the lion means judgment is the the last scientific before judgment is so the reflection reflection between the ground and the sky it causes a Causeway crucified that goes from the Great Pyramid and the sunrise Del Sol and those things yes foreign in the face of our Angel a female so you see you see the first coming the The Virginian and the last one was the lion they had joined together in the springs looking directly at Leo they made the pyramid to align with three stars but now at the end for the first time it's not gonna be three stars to align with the pyramids has never happened a line with the pyramids and that's Jupiter is amen amen foreign because and I'll close with this it was okay when Jupiter condo we said and it has happened every presidential election presidential and they all die in office okay and this happens every 20 years when Saturn and Jupiter come almost together in 1840 in military William Henry Harrison William Harry Harrison died in office of pneumonia established then 20 years more in the 1860s Abraham Lincoln was assassinated foreign [Music] uh
