[12:43] so I veered to my left lane so that I

[13:05] night so we just went to bed as soon as

[13:25] sticking out of my tires
[13:30] on the sidewall
[13:42] it's probably about almost three inches
[13:45] long yes
[13:48] and he told me man you're so lucky

[23:17] the confidence
[23:18] to to be able to
[23:20] study his word and try to try to impart
[23:23] something to to his people amen famous
[23:32] does brother Benji mentioned we're going
[23:34] to be uh the topic we have uh today is
[23:36] the New Jerusalem
[23:42] um and I don't know about you guys but I
[23:43] I really I enjoyed I enjoyed studying
[23:45] this topic I don't know about you but
[23:46] Dan brother will brother Jerry no
[23:48] serious
[23:51] it was it was uh it was a big eye-opener
[23:54] and and you know there's a lot of things
[23:55] that go along with this
[23:59] and you sometimes you don't realize how
[24:02] how deep a subject is until you really
[24:03] start jumping into it and then
[24:08] and then you get kind of lost
[24:12] but but uh so we want to kind of start
[24:15] out today and I'm just going to kind of
[24:17] go real briefly into
[24:19] um you know the New Jerusalem where is
[24:20] it found in the Bible so
[24:22] um you can if everyone will turn their
[24:24] Bibles Revolution Revelations 21 when
[24:27] you drop people almost
[24:35] um and it uh and it reads like this
[24:38] we'll just start with verse one and two
[24:39] because it's basically
[24:41] the large majority of this chapter is
[24:44] describing the New Jerusalem and so
[24:45] forth okay
[24:48] so we'll just read one in queue real
[24:50] quick to start here
[24:52] and it reads like this and I saw a new
[24:55] Heaven and a new Earth
[24:57] for the first Heaven and the first Earth
[24:58] were passed away and there was no more
[25:00] seats
[25:06] and I John saw the holy city New
[25:10] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[25:13] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[25:17] her husband
[25:19] is
[25:25] and I want you to pay attention to that
[25:27] second verse and and remember the fact
[25:29] that everything in the Bible has a
[25:31] compound meaning okay
[25:37] and there's there's a number of places
[25:39] in the Bible where you find the the New
[25:41] Jerusalem mentioned
[25:45] [Music]
[25:46] Hebrews chapter 12 verse 22 everybody
[25:49] else
[25:51] The Book of John 14 verse 2 and 3. uh
[25:58] Isaiah 65 18-19
[26:04] Hebrews 11 verse 10 is
[26:08] and many many other places in the Bible
[26:11] where where the Bible speaks of or talks
[26:13] in in relation to the New Jerusalem
[26:19] so what we want to do tonight is take
[26:22] take the New Jerusalem to start off with
[26:24] in the natural sense
[26:29] because the New Jerusalem it will it
[26:32] will be a city right guys it's actually
[26:34] going to be a place
[26:38] and it also has another meaning that
[26:41] we'll we'll get to as we go here in the
[26:43] in the spiritual sense
[26:47] so I'm going to ask brother will uh in
[26:50] the Book of Revelations can you can you
[26:52] give us the the New Jerusalem its
[26:54] description as the Bible gives it to us
[27:03] yeah brother Carlos said it uh it was a
[27:06] uh
[27:08] I'm sure awesome uh studying about this
[27:14] and I think it's uh when you're with
[27:17] these panels it's it's great
[27:19] when you study by yourself but when
[27:21] you're studying with with the other
[27:22] brothers
[27:27] as we win
[27:31] that's that's what it brings out a lot a
[27:35] lot of a lot of light for your for
[27:37] yourself
[27:40] excuse me so we're gonna uh be talking a
[27:44] little bit uh what the
[27:47] a little bit of the description of what
[27:49] the New Jerusalem is
[27:53] and I want you to to
[27:57] for for a minute here try and imagine
[28:05] a a place
[28:10] um that is as the Bible will say it's
[28:13] it's 12 000 furlongs
[28:19] and I want you to keep in mind the
[28:22] number 12.
[28:26] as we as we know the number 12 is
[28:29] worship
[28:32] so the number 12 plays uh quite a big
[28:36] role when we when we talk about uh about
[28:40] the New Jerusalem um
[28:47] so when we when we see the the
[28:50] dimensions of 12 000 furlongs
[28:57] and what we know
[29:00] um of of our measurements is
[29:05] equal to 1500 miles yes
[29:11] so when the Bible says it's 1500 miles
[29:14] wide
[29:18] the angel It's 1500 miles in length is
[29:27] what's what's incredible about this too
[29:30] is that it's 1500 miles
[29:36] so imagine something as as massive as
[29:41] this I mean I can't even fathom this
[29:43] honestly
[29:47] can you put the uh put the uh uh picture
[29:51] of the U.S up on the map here
[29:55] so if you would if you would uh so that
[29:59] would be 1500 miles
[30:03] so as you see with stretch from Canada
[30:07] into Mexico hasta Mexico from California
[30:11] there's the California to Missouri
[30:14] Illinois that area Illinois so imagine a
[30:18] place in my Altura
[30:35] it's three point almost 3.8 million
[30:38] square miles
[30:43] if you would if you would maybe uh look
[30:47] at it as a as a as a building I guess
[30:50] you can say see
[30:53] and if you would measure each each story
[30:57] as 12 feet
[31:02] it would be equal to 600
[31:05] 000 stories
[31:08] pisos
[31:12] now this city
[31:18] this city is
[31:22] as you can see
[31:24] it's just so massive Grande
[31:28] once again we're going to go to the
[31:30] number 12.
[31:33] and we're going to talk about stones
[31:38] and when you when you see what what the
[31:43] walls first of all are made of
[31:48] the Bible says that the wall is made of
[31:51] Jasper
[31:54] the walls had 12 foundations
[31:58] fundamentals and in the names of the
[32:01] foundations
[32:04] where the names of the 12 tribes of
[32:07] Israel
[32:11] and in them the names of the 12 apostles
[32:18] so if you can imagine how how big these
[32:23] walls are
[32:26] the Bible describes them as the these
[32:29] walls are 144 cubits thick this is
[32:35] 144 cubits thick
[32:40] so that's 216 feet thick so doses
[32:49] um
[32:52] so you so we see
[33:13] you know we were as as we were
[33:16] discussing
[33:17] um the walls and the dimensions and all
[33:19] that
[33:22] you know uh the Bible starts with
[33:26] uh with these Stones here
[33:30] and we're going to get into those right
[33:32] now
[33:33] the First Foundation was Jasper El
[33:36] primer fundamental I can put the
[33:40] that is that this is actually the the
[33:42] German
[33:45] so this so so the German the urum and
[33:49] thumb in every everyone knows kind of
[33:51] what that is right but
[33:56] but uh they are they are stones
[34:01] and and these Stones
[34:04] if uh were were significant to to the
[34:07] children of Israel
[34:10] now these were precious stones
[34:14] stones in general were very very
[34:17] precious to the children
[34:22] if they go into Joshua four nine
[34:27] we can see
[34:29] what these Stones were for and why
[34:33] the Bible was using stones
[34:38] uh Joshua 4 9
[34:40] .
[34:46] actually let's start with uh
[34:49] with verse uh verse 3.
[34:54] and command ye them saying take your
[34:56] hands out of the midst of Jordan out of
[34:59] the place where the priest feet stood 12
[35:01] Stones and ye shall carry them over with
[35:05] you and leave them in the lodging place
[35:07] where ye shall Lodge this night
[35:22] Las cuales
[35:24] was
[35:31] then Joshua called the 12 men whom he
[35:34] had prepared of the children of Israel
[35:36] out of every tribe a man
[35:43] trivo
[35:53] and Joshua said unto them pass over
[35:55] before the Ark of the Lord your God in
[35:57] the midst of Jordan and take you up
[35:59] every man you a stone upon his shoulder
[36:02] according to the number of tribes of the
[36:05] children of Israel
[36:14] news Israel
[36:26] verse 6 that this may be a sign among
[36:30] you amen that when your children ask
[36:33] their fathers in time to come saying
[36:35] what mean ye by these stones
[36:49] so these Stones
[36:52] they were meant as a memorial
[36:56] so when you see
[36:58] Elijah
[37:00] as he's building his Altar
[37:04] and as as all those prophets come
[37:07] against him
[37:09] he also makes an altar of 12 Stones
[37:15] amen amen so the walls of of this New
[37:19] Jerusalem
[37:22] they had 12 foundations fundamentos and
[37:26] like we said before
[37:28] the foundations were of the tribes of
[37:30] Israel and the and the Twelve Apostles
[37:32] fundamentos
[37:35] is
[37:36] so you can see
[37:39] that it's something with the old
[37:43] testamento with the tribes and also the
[37:48] New Testament with the apostles
[37:52] so let's go to the stones
[37:54] now these are what we call precious
[37:58] stones
[38:01] what's amazing about these precious
[38:03] stones
[38:06] is that did we know
[38:09] did you know that Lucifer also had
[38:11] precious songs
[38:17] Lucifer had precious stones
[38:21] but
[38:22] he only had nine minutes
[38:27] this New Jerusalem is
[38:37] a significant
[38:40] because it's worship
[38:42] adoration
[38:44] the First Foundation was Jasper El
[38:47] primer fundamentura the second
[38:50] Foundation was Sapphire El Segundo
[38:52] zafiro the third was calcidoni
[38:57] Agata the fourth was
[39:00] emeralda the fifth was
[39:03] excuse me look the sixth is logo
[39:31] so as you see Como vemos these Stones is
[39:36] they were set up into
[39:38] into four rows
[39:40] Cuatros uh
[39:45] three letters
[39:50] all right
[39:52] so
[39:54] when you see these walls
[39:57] well these walls also have to have uh
[40:01] they also have to have Gates now
[40:06] as the Bible says each gate
[40:11] was of pearl
[40:13] amen amen so so you're thinking
[40:17] well it's made of of a bunch of pearls
[40:20] yes
[40:21] well it's made up of Perla
[40:29] in in 2018
[40:33] they they ended up selling the world's
[40:36] largest pearl at the vendironment
[40:40] it was known as the sleeping lion
[40:46] so they sold it for three hundred and
[40:49] seventy four thousand dollars
[40:53] the largest pearl
[40:56] that we have to this day
[41:02] 5.4 ounces
[41:08] yes and it's 2.75 inches long yes
[41:14] so imagine that guy
[41:17] yeah yeah that's going to be yeah that's
[41:20] going to be a small game right yeah
[41:22] we're gonna need a big big big big pearl
[41:26] right exactly
[41:28] so
[41:29] this gate esta Puerta it has to be
[41:33] something spiritual
[41:36] it has to be something Supernatural
[41:40] because you can't find this on the earth
[41:45] it reminds me of the story of the pearl
[41:48] of great price
[41:51] amen Yes Man how many pearl of great
[41:54] prices do we have here
[41:58] we're we're not something insignificant
[42:03] I mean this
[42:05] if you look at it in a way
[42:08] brother Jerry this is our home is
[42:13] there was there was no
[42:16] I want to say no expense spared in this
[42:19] place
[42:21] I mean you you you have a place that's
[42:25] that's that's of gold
[42:28] um
[42:29] you're walking down uh uh streets of
[42:34] gold
[42:36] of Jasper oh uh and not just not just a
[42:42] gold that we see now
[42:45] but it's it's gold
[42:48] you can actually just see through
[42:53] transparent transparent gold that's
[42:55] right and oh my goodness what what a
[42:58] place oh that is
[43:00] this isn't something that's a fairy tale
[43:05] this is something that is actual that is
[43:08] that is that is tangible
[43:14] I have a question yes sir
[43:19] did he not say that I go to prepare a
[43:22] place for you
[43:23] so on this and we'll hear about it more
[43:25] when we talk about the on the Millennium
[43:27] I will have to build
[43:32] keep in mind that in this city we don't
[43:34] have to lift the fingers
[43:37] in this city God himself has built the
[43:40] city
[43:42] so like so we'll hear about that a
[43:44] little bit more go ahead brother
[43:47] so when you say God has built the city
[43:49] brother
[43:53] it reminds me of the of the of the of
[43:56] the the quote that we read right brother
[43:57] Dan about about the Divine Architects
[44:02] and we we find out and brother Branham
[44:05] describes this so beautifully he is
[44:09] because he talks about God who is the
[44:12] Divine architect of the New Jerusalem
[44:16] architect
[44:18] and brother Brown says
[44:21] oh what will it look like
[44:25] did you ever think now bride oh no
[44:29] what will it look like
[44:31] he says it's prepared and designed
[44:36] by the Divine Architects
[44:40] then he says the Divine architect has
[44:43] prepared it
[44:47] designed it
[45:00] doesn't he say that he designed it
[45:02] according to her touch that's exactly
[45:04] right in the next quote here yeah
[45:09] brother Branham says can you imagine a
[45:12] man marrying a wife
[45:18] that's able get
[45:21] he how he builds and puts every little
[45:25] thing
[45:30] just exactly to her touches
[45:35] just what she would like exactly
[45:39] now the Divine architect
[45:42] has designed the new city
[45:49] that's where he says it but Jerry says
[45:52] where he will live with his bride
[45:56] just to her touch eyes
[46:00] so just when you think
[46:03] that maybe you don't matter
[46:07] or that you're not significant enough
[46:11] there's a Divine architect
[46:14] that considered everything that you like
[46:17] yeah
[46:19] there's no expense no
[46:23] the greatest pearl of great price
[46:27] the finest gold
[46:30] the most beautiful diamonds in gems
[46:33] brother
[46:35] danosas golden walkways brother will
[46:40] a River of Life flowing from the midst
[46:43] of it
[46:45] all just the way each and every one of
[46:49] you like it is
[46:52] whatever little thing that you like
[46:55] it waits for us there now
[46:58] because that Divine architect
[47:00] architecture
[47:04] he built it for us
[47:07] amen so so isn't that tremendous
[47:13] and guys that's just the natural City
[47:18] that's just the natural part is
[47:22] so
[47:27] brother Jerry can you can you tell us
[47:30] about
[47:31] the first Redemption the cleansing of
[47:33] the earth as we start directing
[47:35] ourselves over into the spiritual aspect
[47:37] of it
[47:38] is
[47:45] you see both parts here
[47:48] we see that the Earth has to be redeemed
[47:53] just like we have to
[47:55] right A lot of times we think that all
[47:58] this is going to happen all at once
[48:01] just like the Rapture oh when does The
[48:04] Rapture happen brother
[48:06] we've been in the Rapture all this time
[48:10] so the building of the city
[48:13] brother branches has been going on for
[48:16] thousands of years already
[48:19] but you see the the parallels how they
[48:22] run
[48:23] we know that the Earth had to be
[48:26] baptized
[48:49] through the stages of Grace
[48:52] you have to go through sanctification
[48:55] justification sanctification
[48:57] certification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[49:00] so you see how they run parallel there
[49:03] is
[49:04] so as we speak in all this
[49:07] whether it be the natural or the
[49:09] spiritual yes
[49:12] remember how we always say put your
[49:14] thinking caps on
[49:17] always remember that spiritual aspect of
[49:20] it
[49:23] so I asked I asked her pastor
[49:26] Pastor because I I so there's a question
[49:29] right the New Jerusalem and Zion
[49:33] how can you separate them
[49:35] you know what's the difference
[49:38] well he said in all reality you can't
[49:40] separate them
[49:44] that's why I wanted to use with the
[49:46] Earth being purified along with a
[49:48] Believers
[49:51] so we can't separate these things so
[49:54] keep that in mind okay
[49:57] man that's right
[49:59] so we we find
[50:01] you know the the Earth has to go through
[50:04] a purification right
[50:08] just like the bra just like the bride we
[50:11] have to go through the purification
[50:12] process
[50:15] you know to to understand that
[50:18] so we it it takes us it takes us to to a
[50:23] word brother Danny the brother Branham
[50:24] uses right
[50:29] Danny can you can you what was that word
[50:31] that that that brother Branham uh used
[50:41] thank you
[50:42] that is
[50:45] yes sir yesterday can you can you tell
[50:48] us kind of what what that what that
[50:50] meant there is
[51:00] to go past is or to pass by uh
[51:06] of persons moving forward personas is
[51:16] an act continuing for a Time
[51:19] continuance right man or to pass away
[51:28] right
[51:31] so what's the changing right that's
[51:33] right so
[51:35] how are we going to get to a New
[51:37] Jerusalem
[51:39] right so it's got to be something new
[51:43] the Bible says if any man be in Christ
[51:45] Jesus
[51:48] Christ Jesus he is a new creature is
[51:52] right that's right
[51:53] and so so just talking naturally a
[51:57] little bit so
[52:01] as Brother Carlos just said and or
[52:02] brother Jerry just said and as he was
[52:04] talking to the pastor okay
[52:08] so this is kind of important so I want
[52:10] to read this
[52:12] because a lot of a lot of this that
[52:15] we're talking about
[52:17] it's a lot of mathematical right
[52:21] a lot of dimensions and sizes
[52:28] how many are interested
[52:33] you want to go that's my home yes sir
[52:36] so how many like where you live uh
[52:43] it depends on where you're living right
[52:46] if you're if you're living in Christ
[52:49] where we're living right the life that
[52:53] we're living right
[52:55] so all of this can get a little
[52:57] confusing
[52:59] so just a natural sense let's so
[53:02] Zechariah 8 3 says
[53:06] it says thus say it the Lord yes it is I
[53:10] have returned to Zion
[53:12] and I will dwell in the midst of
[53:14] Jerusalem
[53:16] you can't separate nothing here
[53:20] and Jerusalem shall be called the city
[53:22] of Truth
[53:24] in the mountain of the Lord of hosts the
[53:27] holy mountains
[53:30] so Jerusalem
[53:34] Jerusalem is mentioned 813 times
[53:40] this is just Jerusalem okay so
[53:43] it's mentioned 813 times
[53:47] in the Bible Well 670 times in the old
[53:53] testamentes
[53:55] 143 times in the new
[53:58] testamento more than any other place in
[54:02] both books
[54:05] so that's just natural Jerusalem right
[54:08] Jesus
[54:09] we're talking about New Jerusalem though
[54:14] so it's the New Jerusalem a place
[54:18] yes sir is it a place how many here say
[54:22] it's a place
[54:25] not everybody's short right
[54:29] so is it a persona persona yes sir
[54:35] yes or maybe getting a little confused
[54:38] quick question
[54:43] so
[54:45] in the natural
[54:46] it's mentioned 813 times
[54:51] more than any other city in the book
[54:55] so if it's a person then
[54:58] that's how much God thinks about it
[55:02] right so when the natural God God
[55:06] of Christ through David
[55:10] he said oh Jerusalem Jerusalem
[55:14] how oft would I have hovered over you
[55:17] yeah
[55:19] was he talking about a place of dirt
[55:24] oh Jerusalem Jerusalem
[55:27] oh New Jerusalem
[55:30] so that's just natural right yes I don't
[55:33] want to take too much more time
[55:35] read this quote
[55:37] because like I said it's confusing
[55:41] so how many knows what the news we've
[55:44] already been talking about it so how
[55:46] many knows what the New Jerusalem is
[55:50] how many are sure
[56:00] bye
[56:02] everybody that says it's a place say yes
[56:04] amen
[56:08] everybody that says it's the person say
[56:09] Amen
[56:15] so this is our founding pastor pastor
[56:20] I was talking to a preacher
[56:22] and he said oh it will be nice when we
[56:26] get to the Millennium to inhabit the new
[56:27] city
[56:30] watch that uh well let me let me slow
[56:34] down okay
[56:36] oh it will be nice when we get to the
[56:39] Millennium to inhabit the new city
[56:45] and I said where where where where where
[56:48] have you been reading
[56:52] where have you I I even stuttered
[56:55] where have you been reading
[56:58] he said well brother Branham says that
[57:01] the New Jerusalem will be here
[57:04] I said but not that not the city
[57:09] not the city the New Jerusalem you can
[57:13] put it like this
[57:16] it is a city
[57:18] but it is the bride
[57:22] and the reason I read this is for this
[57:24] next
[57:26] and when you confuse one with the other
[57:30] you'll stand all scripture and
[57:33] everything into chaos into confusion
[57:36] a lot of people says
[57:39] while we're all going to be in heaven
[57:43] in heaven
[57:46] what part of Heaven
[57:51] what part of Heaven
[57:55] so you want me to keep going or today
[58:02] so then now what is heaven
[58:09] okay
[58:11] so Heaven is a condition right
[58:14] all right so as we're talking about the
[58:16] dimensions of all this right here
[58:19] you're thinking about the map that we
[58:21] just saw right
[58:23] oh man it's gonna be from from
[58:26] Illinois is all the way over here
[58:28] Illinois so you're trying to
[58:32] make this place is
[58:36] right why the three dimensions that we
[58:38] live in that's right
[58:40] so you're trying to imagine it like oh
[58:43] it's gonna be like from from Las Cruces
[58:45] to to California you're making like a so
[58:49] you're you know what you in your mind
[58:50] you're thinking all the Rocky Mountains
[58:56] so you you can't make this spiritual New
[59:00] Jerusalem
[59:03] because brother Branham says
[59:06] I have not seen
[59:09] an ear hath not heard
[59:12] it's a place where the Divine Architects
[59:17] Jesus Jesus he's gone to go prepare a
[59:20] Dwelling Place foreign
[59:27] I'm on my mind it's a condition right
[59:29] now
[59:32] we see here that John himself
[59:36] he said I saw the New Jerusalem come
[59:39] down right
[59:41] but in order for John to even see that
[59:45] he had to be in a certain condition yes
[59:50] so you have to be prepared
[59:53] that's why Jesus said I go to prepare a
[59:56] place for you
[59:58] so we got to be prepared
[1:00:01] all right so I'll let you go ahead
[1:00:03] brother
[1:00:05] we're gonna and then we'll go back to
[1:00:07] man that was good
[1:00:09] so so brother Branham brother Branham to
[1:00:12] read this quote as we kind of as we kind
[1:00:14] of go go into this
[1:00:17] brother says and the anointing will be
[1:00:21] upon the New Jerusalem
[1:00:26] that descends from God out of Heaven
[1:00:32] prepared as a bride
[1:00:35] adorned for her husband
[1:00:38] esposo but watch the way he puts this
[1:00:41] last part
[1:00:44] the anointing
[1:00:46] will be upon them
[1:00:52] okay so like brother Danny says there
[1:00:55] you see two okay you remember there's
[1:00:57] you see the the natural side of the New
[1:01:00] Jerusalem
[1:01:03] but as we go we're gonna we're gonna
[1:01:06] bring that spiritual side so you you see
[1:01:08] where that that applies
[1:01:19] because in order to understand how it is
[1:01:22] that that we get a new city here and so
[1:01:25] forth but
[1:01:28] we have to understand how it is that God
[1:01:31] God changes and God cleanses things
[1:01:34] right
[1:01:37] if you if you don't understand the
[1:01:39] process you'll never understand the end
[1:01:44] resultado so so God has a method right
[1:01:48] and when we heard that earlier
[1:01:54] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:01:57] the Holy Spirit
[1:01:59] but but notice that that in order for
[1:02:03] the New Jerusalem to to to to be here in
[1:02:06] both the natural and the spirit
[1:02:12] there's a cleansing that has to take
[1:02:14] place right
[1:02:18] but but but I think there's a there's a
[1:02:21] lot of misconception around this
[1:02:22] cleansing
[1:02:27] because we we think of of when the earth
[1:02:31] is cleansed
[1:02:34] both naturally and spiritually
[1:02:38] that that it's just done away with okay
[1:02:42] right we think that it's annihilated
[1:02:46] right brother we think many times that
[1:02:49] we're it's just wiped out and we're
[1:02:51] gonna just start fresh
[1:02:52] this is a
[1:02:56] yeah
[1:02:57] aniki level but but watch what brother
[1:02:59] Branham says here
[1:03:02] he says heavens and earth will pass away
[1:03:08] now this word means
[1:03:11] and he's referring to the word parade
[1:03:17] passing from one
[1:03:20] Forma to another
[1:03:24] okay
[1:03:25] it does not mean Annihilation as the
[1:03:28] English word would mean
[1:03:33] pass away
[1:03:36] it's annihilated yes
[1:03:39] but the Hebrew word
[1:03:42] or the Greek word here
[1:03:46] does not mean pass away no significa
[1:03:50] it means dignifica from passing from one
[1:03:55] thing
[1:04:00] here you go brother Danny
[1:04:02] look Mira but to pass
[1:04:07] from one condition
[1:04:11] to another
[1:04:14] so so it's not done away with in the
[1:04:17] sense that that we're done away with and
[1:04:19] this Earth is done away with it
[1:04:24] but that it's changed
[1:04:28] but that weird change
[1:04:31] from one form the one condition
[1:04:35] watch the way brother Brandon puts it
[1:04:37] here in this quote
[1:04:39] he says Paul is using the same word
[1:04:44] regeneration of man significance the man
[1:04:48] has passed from a sinner to a Saints
[1:04:53] not completely annihilated
[1:04:56] thank God because where would I be
[1:04:59] when a man is changed he isn't
[1:05:03] annihilated
[1:05:04] but he's a changed persona persona he
[1:05:09] has been changed from what he was to
[1:05:13] what he is
[1:05:14] he says not Annihilator he said
[1:05:18] that's right
[1:05:19] so brother Danny now now we find that
[1:05:22] the believer's gone through
[1:05:24] justification the believer's gone
[1:05:26] through through sanctification and those
[1:05:28] are monody
[1:05:31] we've gone through the baptism of the
[1:05:33] Holy Ghost
[1:05:36] and and as we as we go through the
[1:05:40] stature of the perfect man
[1:05:44] perfect and many times as a Believer I
[1:05:47] think sometimes maybe we we don't
[1:05:49] understand muchas
[1:05:52] maybe what are what are end game what
[1:05:55] our end goal is
[1:05:56] like we've got all these steps and and
[1:05:59] we understand the steps
[1:06:03] but but what is what is the end goal of
[1:06:06] that right
[1:06:08] and so and so brother brother Danny if
[1:06:11] you would continue on the on that line
[1:06:12] that that you were on there
[1:06:16] can you take this into what's our end
[1:06:19] game goal what are we shooting yeah
[1:06:25] so we're going to the New Jerusalem
[1:06:29] right see and so brother Branham says in
[1:06:33] Fellowship by Redemption
[1:06:36] it says mortal beings as the only ones
[1:06:39] who lives in Mortal habitations
[1:06:45] Immortal beings live in Immortal
[1:06:48] habitation
[1:06:51] so many like where you live
[1:06:58] immortal
[1:07:00] Visions
[1:07:03] then the place that we go into is
[1:07:07] until we return back
[1:07:11] is not a place of brick and mortar no is
[1:07:17] or precious stones
[1:07:20] or Jewels it's a place of condition
[1:07:26] now how many are in conditions tonight
[1:07:30] am I to see him
[1:07:34] all right well John said Juan Diego
[1:07:37] uh we we said a word about John right
[1:07:40] that he had to be prepared
[1:07:42] I said I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[1:07:45] day yes sir
[1:07:47] condition right
[1:07:49] now how many are in condition to go see
[1:07:52] him
[1:07:55] are we can we raise our hands
[1:07:57] we're in condition to go see him right
[1:08:00] now
[1:08:13] so either we're asleep
[1:08:16] we're talking naturally and spiritually
[1:08:19] here
[1:08:21] right so so we got to wake up right
[1:08:25] so the question was asked in 2018.
[1:08:30] rapturing conditions how many are ready
[1:08:34] for the route to to meet this condition
[1:08:39] very few hands went up
[1:08:43] that was 2018
[1:08:46] or 2023.
[1:08:50] we got just about the same result
[1:09:00] it's a place of conditions Now we move
[1:09:04] out of this Dimension that we live in
[1:09:05] salimos esta Dimensions into another
[1:09:08] dimension
[1:09:10] and it's a house yes
[1:09:14] a dwelling place
[1:09:17] it's a place of conditions
[1:09:22] so
[1:09:24] I'm going to leave the next
[1:09:26] related
[1:09:29] so so brother Branham brother Branham
[1:09:32] calls that brother Brandon this and this
[1:09:34] quote here he says Calvary raises
[1:09:38] that tied for the Old Testament yes
[1:09:43] to them who Justified looked for it
[1:09:49] and in this new dispensation
[1:09:54] at the coming of the Lord
[1:09:57] and watch how brother Branham says this
[1:10:01] remember when when the believer when the
[1:10:04] believer goes through these these stages
[1:10:07] at the process
[1:10:13] it's not Annihilation noise
[1:10:18] the brother Brown says at the coming of
[1:10:21] the Lord
[1:10:24] at the new Earth
[1:10:27] nutiera
[1:10:30] so
[1:10:32] who's Earth anybody anybody here is
[1:10:38] right what about new
[1:10:41] Earth
[1:10:45] right
[1:10:46] the Rope of Salvation
[1:10:53] the blood La Sangre the redeeming power
[1:10:57] that I'm talking about
[1:11:01] and through the same
[1:11:05] Systema has redeemed both man
[1:11:12] and Earth
[1:11:15] will raise right up into eternity again
[1:11:22] so he's redeemed both man brother Danny
[1:11:25] Romano Danny Al hombre andier La Tierra
[1:11:29] a man
[1:11:31] brother Jerry I wonder if this would be
[1:11:33] if this would just be a good place maybe
[1:11:34] to go and and kind of just briefly touch
[1:11:36] on the timeline of events
[1:11:42] and and and run through that a little
[1:11:45] bit
[1:11:46] we'll just skim through them because
[1:11:48] obviously there's so much here
[1:11:51] so what do we see what are we waiting
[1:11:54] foreign
[1:12:02] there's a and then we're waiting for the
[1:12:03] Rapture we're in the Rapture
[1:12:06] the actual catching away
[1:12:08] so then we know he comes through the
[1:12:11] tribulation period
[1:12:14] the three and a half years that the Jews
[1:12:16] received this message
[1:12:23] the Armageddon it ends the tribulation
[1:12:27] we know that after that
[1:12:35] so there's many people that get stuck
[1:12:37] there
[1:12:38] they think that that's our destination
[1:12:42] and keep in mind
[1:12:45] the bride she's already Eternal at this
[1:12:47] point
[1:12:49] because we know the Millennium to be
[1:12:51] What's called the seventh day
[1:12:54] or the day of rest
[1:12:56] but in all reality
[1:12:59] there's still time Tiempo there's still
[1:13:02] building of homes
[1:13:05] there'll still be a war today all these
[1:13:08] things will still happening
[1:13:11] so they asked the question will the
[1:13:13] literal body of the Lord Jesus Christ be
[1:13:15] there in the Millennium
[1:13:18] is
[1:13:23] because the Earth the physical Earth has
[1:13:26] not passed through Paradise
[1:13:29] the Earth has not been cleansed yet
[1:13:33] so the precious feet of our Lord Jesus
[1:13:35] Christ losses
[1:13:40] so so it's a day of rest
[1:13:43] but he's resting now
[1:13:50] in all reality the bride is already
[1:13:53] Eternal she's on her Eighth Day they
[1:13:55] call it
[1:13:58] what what what's that what's that word
[1:14:13] [Laughter]
[1:14:16] and brother Danny
[1:14:22] it's the holy convocation right that's
[1:14:24] right but brother random getting points
[1:14:26] so good that he says it's a holy
[1:14:28] conversation
[1:14:33] that's right right so this is what we're
[1:14:35] having today is a holy Compass that's
[1:14:37] right
[1:14:39] that's right he sure does he says that
[1:14:41] he gets he brother brought him in that
[1:14:43] message have you ever heard that message
[1:14:47] he gets so excited when he talks about
[1:14:49] the Holy convocation
[1:14:53] he calls it about 12 different things
[1:14:57] the holy conflagration
[1:15:02] so so we end up brother Jerry at the
[1:15:05] Eighth Day yeah
[1:15:08] so so back here really quick go ahead
[1:15:11] Melina so people get stuck there
[1:15:13] it's the eighth day but then it goes
[1:15:15] back to the first day brother says
[1:15:19] so we got to complete a day with God
[1:15:22] which is a thousand years
[1:15:25] so then we know that Satan is loose for
[1:15:28] a little season after that
[1:15:31] and he starts to deceive those Nations
[1:15:34] that are left over
[1:15:38] because we know in Armageddon there's
[1:15:41] still Nations that are left over
[1:15:46] so those Nations that are left over have
[1:15:48] to pay tribute or tithe to the bride
[1:15:54] so when saying when he's let loose for a
[1:15:57] little season he begins to deceive those
[1:15:58] Nations
[1:16:02] honest and they began to murmur and
[1:16:04] bicker
[1:16:06] Plato they began to say well there there
[1:16:09] are a few it is
[1:16:11] and why should we have to pay tithesis
[1:16:20] they began to say well why do we have to
[1:16:22] do these things
[1:16:24] so they come against the bride now
[1:16:28] but at that time
[1:16:33] God himself comes down
[1:16:35] the Battle of God is
[1:16:41] away with it
[1:16:43] she doesn't have to lift the fingers
[1:16:47] and brother Jerry to that point there
[1:16:50] of of when Satan is loosed
[1:16:55] his brother Branham says he's in a chain
[1:16:59] of circumstances
[1:17:00] so when he's lose
[1:17:06] uh telling all these all these nations
[1:17:09] okay
[1:17:10] look at Israel
[1:17:13] Israel at the time Israel it looks very
[1:17:18] vulnerable
[1:17:21] you know it doesn't have any walls it's
[1:17:25] just it's just uh it's just a place
[1:17:28] where it looks like like
[1:17:33] so when he's when he's deceiving them
[1:17:37] look how it's look how easily it's going
[1:17:40] to be
[1:17:41] look how they are
[1:17:44] it almost looks as they are complacent
[1:17:51] because there hasn't been any any War
[1:17:54] there haven't been any there there
[1:17:57] hasn't been any deception
[1:18:00] thousand years of peace
[1:18:02] there's no need for for all this
[1:18:06] so when he's loose well and he has this
[1:18:10] this deception
[1:18:12] he brings all these armies like you said
[1:18:14] brother uh Jerry again
[1:18:23] that God himself
[1:18:26] he reigns fire
[1:18:30] and brimstone
[1:18:32] all right and and in the Book of
[1:18:34] Revelation
[1:18:37] it says that the casualties
[1:18:42] or the death or or la muerte is so is so
[1:18:47] incredible
[1:18:49] there's so much blood
[1:18:51] that it takes them six months to get all
[1:18:55] these bodies out of the way
[1:18:59] so much destruction
[1:19:03] but the bride but a la Novia where's she
[1:19:06] at honeymoon
[1:19:10] glory to God all right go ahead reject
[1:19:13] so so he fights and tells us and then
[1:19:16] the gray went through judgment
[1:19:18] let me ask you a question
[1:19:24] or we know that the Saints is
[1:19:40] tonight
[1:20:21] anybody
[1:20:24] say it the way he said it on the tape
[1:20:26] anyone brave enough anyone brave enough
[1:20:31] so I we I think we listen to this we to
[1:20:35] be honest with you I couldn't find the
[1:20:36] answer
[1:20:38] I had to listen to that message about 50
[1:20:41] times
[1:20:44] but the way the brother the way the
[1:20:46] brother Tommy answers it is the way the
[1:20:47] brother brand amounts
[1:20:51] and that time frame is
[1:20:54] dependent upon depende the sentence
[1:20:59] of the worst person that is sentenced
[1:21:04] that the great white Throne
[1:21:09] whether it be Adolf Hitler yes yeah
[1:21:12] Hitler whether it be whoever it be
[1:21:14] Genghis Khan
[1:21:16] Genghis Khan whoever it would be
[1:21:19] because remember brother Danny that that
[1:21:22] brother Branham says that that each
[1:21:24] person receives a judgment
[1:21:27] in a degree right
[1:21:30] there's no reason that that somebody who
[1:21:33] has not done what Adolf Hitler did
[1:21:36] so Hitler would suffer as long as he
[1:21:39] does
[1:21:42] so what is the time frame between
[1:21:46] the Millennium in the New Jerusalem
[1:21:51] however long it takes for that sentence
[1:21:53] for that person to be fulfilled
[1:21:55] Persona
[1:21:59] during that time
[1:22:07] Tiempo
[1:22:37] that's a good question that's a good
[1:22:40] question okay what do you got
[1:22:42] so I I don't know
[1:22:45] to be determined suspenders
[1:22:53] so the burning of that sentence
[1:22:57] as I'm saying is that during that time
[1:22:59] that everything ignites yes
[1:23:03] pastor says yes
[1:23:06] because remember the Earth has to go
[1:23:08] through its chains
[1:23:11] the only way Jesus will come back on
[1:23:13] this Earth
[1:23:16] has to be changed it has to be a new
[1:23:20] Earth
[1:23:20] just like with the believer exactly
[1:23:23] exactly the only way Jesus can live in
[1:23:26] your heart
[1:23:28] it's got to be a change
[1:23:32] is
[1:23:33] hold on hold on
[1:23:37] you're unloading the atomic bombs
[1:23:38] already yeah
[1:23:41] hold on okay all right okay all right
[1:23:45] brother Jerry our brother Danny here we
[1:23:46] go so to bring this back around and and
[1:23:49] to finish this up okay we're going to go
[1:23:51] into Revelations 3 12. uh apocalypse
[1:23:54] okay we're gonna we're gonna set it up
[1:23:56] for brother Danny and brother Jerry here
[1:23:57] to finish it out okay uh uh
[1:24:00] that's where you're the moderator thank
[1:24:03] you
[1:24:03] and this is this is this is where the
[1:24:08] believer
[1:24:11] becomes a part
[1:24:13] becomes that New Jerusalem
[1:24:17] Revelation 3 12 tells us him that
[1:24:19] overcometh is
[1:24:26] in the temple of my God
[1:24:29] and he shall go no more out
[1:24:32] and I will ride upon him
[1:24:36] the name of my God
[1:24:39] and the name of the city of my God
[1:24:43] which is New Jerusalem
[1:24:46] which cometh down out of Heaven from God
[1:24:51] and I will write upon him
[1:24:56] my new name
[1:24:58] brother Danny no Lenny
[1:25:03] okay so the name Jerusalem
[1:25:07] the name the meaning of the name is
[1:25:09] quite astonishing significance
[1:25:12] okay so the core word in this name is
[1:25:15] s-h-a-l-e-m
[1:25:25] Ama
[1:25:28] I'm gonna put these back on
[1:25:32] which means a significa completeness
[1:25:38] I might
[1:25:41] and wholeness
[1:25:43] so the word
[1:25:45] shalom
[1:25:47] shalom how many remembers the message
[1:25:50] that was preached
[1:25:52] how was your peace
[1:25:58] it's a place of peace right
[1:26:03] the Melchizedek was there wasn't he the
[1:26:05] king of Salem
[1:26:10] how many remembers that message
[1:26:12] okay so it's a
[1:26:16] um
[1:26:17] which means uh Peace So peace significa
[1:26:20] pass Shalom comes from this word as well
[1:26:23] and so any peace depends on both
[1:26:26] completeness
[1:26:29] um
[1:26:43] so keep in mind that the New Jerusalem
[1:26:45] must be a place of completeness
[1:26:52] because it is a Dwelling Place of the
[1:26:55] Lord God
[1:26:58] as he himself attested as we read in
[1:27:01] Zechariah
[1:27:04] 3.3 Ocho Tres that he will dwell in the
[1:27:07] midst of Jerusalem and
[1:27:10] shall be called the city of Truth
[1:27:14] so the first part of the name Jerusalem
[1:27:16] is
[1:27:24] oh
[1:27:26] which can mean either they will see yes
[1:27:29] or they will fill the office
[1:27:35] that's Jerusalem
[1:27:38] that's but we're talking about the New
[1:27:41] Jerusalem
[1:27:43] so they're gonna see or they will fill
[1:27:47] the ah
[1:27:53] when you put the first part together
[1:27:56] you fully understand the name Jerusalem
[1:28:03] they will see the wholeness or they will
[1:28:06] fill the uh
[1:28:11] or they will fill the all of the
[1:28:14] completeness
[1:28:18] and so from this point
[1:28:21] we need no interpretation regarding
[1:28:25] interpretation the identity of the
[1:28:27] wholeness
[1:28:29] or of the completeness of the New
[1:28:32] Jerusalem
[1:28:35] stairs there he is there is the bride oh
[1:28:40] my God
[1:28:42] the bride La Novia let's see what he
[1:28:45] said here now
[1:28:46] we make sure that we don't miss it
[1:28:49] he come he got out over come there's
[1:28:54] this way of Adventure will shall be a
[1:28:56] pillar in the temple of my God
[1:28:59] and shall not go out anymore
[1:29:03] the bride's standing there with the
[1:29:05] bridegroom
[1:29:09] if we could have the time to take that
[1:29:13] that out
[1:29:15] for the book over there over in
[1:29:17] Revelation
[1:29:20] all the kings of the earth bring their
[1:29:22] honor into it
[1:29:25] that's like the type the tribe of Levi
[1:29:28] is
[1:29:30] as we heard all the rest of them pays
[1:29:33] ties to him
[1:29:36] and he goes on but he says
[1:29:41] what is it guess it's the bride yes the
[1:29:46] bride is that City LA Novia is
[1:29:48] the bride is that church Tiempo
[1:30:40] uh for eternity right
[1:30:43] yes go ahead brother Jerry hey Matt
[1:30:46] wow wow so watch let me interject this
[1:30:49] okay
[1:30:51] a very important crucial component um
[1:30:56] a message that are preached by our
[1:30:58] pastor brother Caleb um
[1:31:00] and here on this Isaiah 65 17 yeah
[1:31:06] he says for behold
[1:31:09] I create new heavens and a new Earth
[1:31:15] and the former shall not be remembered
[1:31:19] nor come into mind amen
[1:31:22] how many remember our pastor preaching
[1:31:25] that
[1:31:26] I'm not holding on to things no no uh
[1:31:31] not letting those old things drag us
[1:31:33] down
[1:31:36] not letting those old grudges Hold Us
[1:31:38] Down
[1:31:40] how many remembers
[1:31:43] I do because I have to practice that
[1:31:45] every day
[1:31:48] you haven't seen the universe
[1:32:00] so we have to keep those things in mind
[1:32:02] that's crucial
[1:32:32] because remember it comes down in the
[1:32:34] shape of a pyramid it says
[1:32:38] so so I see the pyramid coming down
[1:32:44] climbing a pyramid
[1:32:47] so when those both unite
[1:32:51] so this is the New Jerusalem we're
[1:32:53] talking about
[1:32:55] we know that every born-again believer
[1:32:57] is a Jew
[1:33:00] so what symbol does it shows
[1:33:16] one of them is upside down they said
[1:33:20] let me show you this little Point here
[1:33:24] hopefully I can find it here
[1:33:29] okay here we go so we must apply the
[1:33:32] word remember that okay
[1:33:34] Jerusalem comes down in the shape of a
[1:33:36] pyramid
[1:33:38] but the bride has to go up the pyramid
[1:33:43] it's not that one
[1:33:44] I found it
[1:33:47] watch in the future home and
[1:33:49] so John saw the holy city
[1:33:53] the New Jerusalem
[1:33:55] descending like a comet um
[1:34:00] Paloma well you see how the comments
[1:34:02] they come down here first then come on
[1:34:04] so we see the New Jerusalem coming down
[1:34:07] and that's going up you know it's the
[1:34:11] sign that Unity is
[1:34:14] of almighty God in his people
[1:34:18] together not for a thousand years
[1:34:24] all tears are wiped away
[1:34:26] oh problems
[1:34:29] everything that we've had to go through
[1:34:31] it pales in comparison to this
[1:34:36] that's right that's right amen
[1:34:39] I have not seen nor your third riper
[1:34:41] down my
[1:34:45] eternity is what it is located that's
[1:34:48] what we're after
[1:34:49] the Millennium the Millennium is still
[1:34:51] time is temporary
