We're going to be singing this song It matters to the Master because all things Matter to the Master. And we just hope that it's a blessing to you as it has been to us. [Música] When life gets you down and you feel more broken than whole, when The woods go deeper than worse. And you can't tell a soul. I may not know what you're going through. I may not can make that high mountain move. One thing I know that I really want you to know. If it matters to you, it matters to the master. He wants to share the burdens you bear. Whisper peace when your world gets shattered. If it's your greatest joy or your deepest pain or you're really needing an answer, if it matters to you, it matters to the master.

So we're going to be asking our sister Hope to be coming forth and give her special her poem. And then after that we'll have the Cloud City Courtech come up. Good afternoon. God bless you. Have a poem to share with you all and I pray it be a blessing. Think about his love. Think about his goodness. Think about his grace that's brought us through. For as high as the heavens above, so great is the measure of our father's love. In the year 2007, a group of deepsea divers discovered a female octopus cling to the jagged ledge of a canyon located 4,600 fet below the ocean surface. She was guarding one hundred and sixty minute milky teardrops cemented to the rock. Her eggs, her children. For the female octopus laying eggs marks the glorious beginning of an inevitable end. She covers them, defends them, wa them so they continuously have fresh oxygenated water. The longer she watches them, the greater chance they have of surviving. In 2011, the deep sea divers returned and found that she remained there for 53 months. For 53 months, she watched over them, guarded them, fed them, protected them. for 53 months remaining, never leaving her side, never even taking a moment to eat, her skin turning pale, her body shrinking. They found that her eggs had successfully hatched, only the husks, the capsules of what they once were remaining behind. Her body was nowhere to be found. that that constance that determination that persistence that sacrifice that is the love of a true mother and as our prophet is said if the love of a mother will do that what will the love of god do the love of god sent his son to unfold to suffer as a sacrifice for me And for you, the love of God saw me at my rock bottom and said, "You, I choose you always, forever." The love of God steadfastly declares, "I have begun something beautiful in you and I will be faithful, so faithful to finish it." The love of God shelters, conceals, protects, sets you upon a rock. The love of God in our hearts makes us his children so much more than conquerors, so much more than able, so much more than alive. The love of God is unfathomable, immeasurable. It is deep. It is wide. It is great. So great. And forever. Forever I will sing great is the measure of our father's love. [Aplausos] Aleluya. Ah. God bless [Música] Living in his word, I will overcome. Standing on his promises one by one.

Lord, we bless your name in all things, Jesus. At this time, we're praying for the offering and for the tithing, Father, that you bless those who give freely. Father, we thank you for everything, Lord. In your name we ask, in Jesus name we pray. Amen. We're going to sing that song, brother. Praise the Lord.

Praise the Lord for the chains that seem to bind you. They serve only to remind you that they drop powerless behind you when you praise him. When you're up against the struggle that shatters all your dreams and your hopes have been crushed by Satan's manifested schemes. And you feel the urge within you to submit to earthly fears. Oh, don't let the faith you're standing on seem to disappear. Praise the Lord. He go to those who praise him. Praise the Lord for God in habits. Praise, praise the Lord for the chains that seem to bind you. Serve only to remind you that they drop powerless behind you when you praise him. Amen. At this time you may be seated. It is my pleasure to introduce the minister for this evening, brother. And we're going to be asking that his his family come forth to sing a little special to do a little special to introduce him.

[Aplausos] Estamos contentos por las iglesias que han venido en esta noche con los jóvenes y a la iglesia local. Queremos entrar directamente a la palabra en esta noche, esta tarde. Toman sus biblias, se ponen de pie otra vez en el libro de Génesis, capítulo 24. Esta mañana paramos en el versículo 9. Quisiéramos iniciar con el verso 10. for all the goods of his were in his hand and he arose and went to the hizo arrodillar los camellos fuera de la ciudad junto al pozo de agua a la hora de la tarde, a la hora en que salen las doncellas por agua. dijo, "Oh Jehová, Dios de mi señor Abraham, dame, te ruego de tener hoy buen encuentro. Haz misericordia con mi señor Abraham. Y aquí yo estoy junto a la fuente de agua y las hijas de los varones que están de esta ciudad salen por agua. And let it come to pass that the dancil to whom thou shall say, let down thy picture, I pray thee, that may drink, and she shall say, drink, and I will give thels drink also. Sea pues, clancella a quien yo diere, "Be tu cántaro, te ruego para que yo beba." Y respondier, bebe y también yo daré de beber a tus camellos, que sea esta que tú has destinado para tu siervo Isaac. En esto conoceré que habrás hecho misericordia con mi Señor. Verso 15. Y aconteció que antes de que él acabase de hablar, he aquí Rebeca que había nacido Betuel, hijo de Milka, mujer de Nacor, hermano de Abraham, la cual salía con su cántaro sobre su hombro. Y la doncella era de aspecto muy hermoso, virgen a la que varón no había conocido, la cual descendió a la fuente, llenó su cántaro y se volvía. Oremos. Querido Señor Jesús, pedimos bendigas tu palabra esta mañana, en esta tarde. Bendice a cada uno. Los comiendo en tu mano. Nos cometemos en tu mano. Estamos aquí para servicio en el nombre de Jesús. Amén. Dios les bendiga. Pueden sentarse rápidamente. Tomamos dos escrituras en el libro de Apocalipsis. En Apocalipsis 219. And there came unto me one of the angels of vino entonces a mí uno de los siete ángeles que tenía las siete copas llenas de las siete plagas postreras y habló conmigo diciendo, "Ven acá, yo te mostraré la desposada, la esposa del cordero." Apocalipsis 22 verso 16. Yo, Jesús, he enviado mi ángel para daros testimonio de estas cosas en las iglesias. Yo soy la raíz y el linaje de David, la estrella resplandeciente de la mañana. Y el espíritu y la esposa dicen, "Ven." Amén. Regreso nuestra escritura en Génesis 24. Así un poquito retrocediendo, así como esta mañana nos dimos cuenta quién era Abraham, quién era Isaac, quién era Eliazar y quién era Rebeca. Nos dijo el profeta de Dios que la Biblia fue escrita en el cielo antes de la fundación del mundo. Puede usted decir amén. Fue preplaneada, fue preescrita con una mente eterna en vista. No fue un libro hecho para ser leído una vez y puesto otra vez. Porque es una palabra eterna. Cuando usted se acerca a la palabra es más profunda. El día de hoy una escritura significa esto para usted, pero en 5 años en tiempo la misma escritura significará algo más grande porque tiene una vista eterna y es un libro escrito para el Dios por el Dios todopoderoso, él mismo. Amén. fue preplaneada, preescrita antes de que llegara aquí. Cuando llega aquí, usted la encuentra en sus manos. Usted sabe entonces los tipos y sombras. Hay un tipo y una sombra y tiene que ver cómo se encuentra o se coloca en su vida a través de la palabra escrita. Llevamos esto un poco más lejos con Isaac y Rebeca. Este caballero Eliazar tenía la tremenda tarea de encontrar una novia para Isaac. Él juró a su maestro de que no iba a tomar una novia de las otras escogencias de mujeres mundanas allí. Pero una dama específica nacida en cierta casa y tiene las calificaciones que tiene que cumplir antes de que la tome como novia. Ahora, Eliazar no está escogiendo novia para él mismo. Está escogiendo una novia para Abraham. Ahora, con esta responsabilidad tan tremenda, él va en oración. Es una decisión tremenda y cada tremenda decisión que usted y yo tenemos que hacer, solo se puede hacer propiamente decisión cuando estamos en nuestras rodillas en oración. La oración siempre es apropiada. A veces la predicación no es apropiada, a veces el cantar no es apropiado, a veces hablamos mucho, ayúdeme, pero oración siempre es apropiado. Cuando Nehemías, que era el copero del rey, él estaba en servidumbre y llegó a la presencia del rey con una con un semblante decaído. Le preguntó el rey, "Neemías, ¿cuál es el problema? Yo escuché que las paredes de mi pueblo están todas caídas. Entonces, es una carga sobre él. Y dice el rey, pues, ¿qué pides tú? Dice la escritura. Entonces oré y luego le respondí al rey. En ese momento, tome su Biblia, Nehemías oró antes de darle al rey lo que él pedía. Oré. Entonces luego le respondí al rey y este hombre Eliazar no era una relación de sangre, pero era un siervo a un verdadero hombre de Dios. Y este ter hombre de Dios, está llamando para que él busque una novia para su hijo. Con esta tremenda responsabilidad, él va en oración y lleva 10 camellos, no cinco, no siete, llevó 10. va a esta ciudad, se encuentra allí en la fuente en el pozo y coloca cada camello allí al lado de la fuente y ya está todo puesto en orden. Y luego él hace una oración y en su oración él está llamando a Dios que responda por amor a Abraham. No solo por amor a él, por causa de la necesidad de su siervo Abraham. Y él hace la oración, dice, "Señor, que sea que a la dama a la que le pida de beber, ofrezca darme de beber a mí y no solo a mí, pero a mis camellos." Y mientras él está orando, la respuesta para usted quiere que el Señor responda. En ocasiones oramos y ni dejamos que eso desarrolle. Queremos que algo pase ahora mismo y queremos al Se tiene que orar y luego esperar, luego encontrar lo que usted quiere en la escritura. Y luego ore otra vez. Y luego espere otra vez. Luego ore otra vez. Luego espere otra vez. Esa oración tiene que desarrollarse entre una oración contestada porque la oración tiene dos partes. Es la oración contestada y la que no es contestada. Él ora la oración y mientras está terminando de orar dice, "Amén." Y aquí viene Rebeca. Cuando él empezó a orar, quería decir que ella ya estaba en camino para aparecer al final de la oración. Oh, él lo trabaja para usted. Él va a hacer que las cosas trabajen para usted. El Señor que servimos dice el Bran que Jesús nunca andaba en apenas porque todo estaba bajo control. Si usted es un creyente, usted tiene que creer que todo está bajo control y todo lo que está aconteciendo, lo que tiene que acontecer y todo lo que está aconteciendo antes que yo sabía que iba a pasar. Alabado sea el Señor. En esta oración, aquí viene la amada Rebeca. Ella viene, aquí está el hombre, 10 camellos y la Biblia anuncia que ella era una mujer hermosa. Dice la Biblia que era muy hermosa. ¿Correcto? Es el detalle que tenemos que saber. Obviamente está en la palabra, es una una muchacha bonita. La escogencia de la novia, en el mensaje que predicó el hermano BR, dice, "Primero, encuentre carácter y luego si la amas, no que la ames y a ver si si tiene carácter. Pero encuentra el carácter. Luego si la amas, el carácter, belleza es un es un don. Si usted nace bonita, si usted nace bonita o o o apuesto, los apuestos saben que son apuestos, actúan como que no. ¿Saben cómo moverse suficiente? Lo suficiente. Yo sé lo que un canto bueno suena. Yo sé como cuando su piano suena bien, yo no puedo tocar el piano, pero yo sé cómo suena un piano bueno. Entonces, cuánto más que si es malo en el órgano y si es un mal músico, usted no sabe que él sabe que es malo. Las muchachas bonitas saben que son bonitas y en ocasiones es el problema. El hombre que es apuesto sabe que es apuesto y el hombre que tiene un don sabe que tiene don. Aquí está una muchacha bonita, es un don natural para ella. Ella es hermosa, es virgen, pero tiene carácter. Su oración que lo oró, si está respondida correctamente, le va a mostrar a Elías que esta muchacha tiene carácter. No dijo cuando ore que le Señor, dime el nombre de ella. Señor, que ella haga esto, esto y esto y ella será aquella. Si tiene un pañuelo. Oh, sorry. Aquí está la prueba para el carácter. Ahora sabemos que es bonita y cualquiera, cualquier puede decirle eso. Ella sabe que es hermosa para mirar, pero la oración dice esto. Señor, que me de beber y que ofrezca darle bebida no solo a uno de mis camellos, pero a todos mis camellos. Regresemos un poco. Primero que todo, una muchacha bonita no le va a dar agua a un cabello. ¿Saben por qué? ¿Saben por qué? Porque ella es una muchacha bonita. Las muchachas bonitas no le dan agua a los camellos. Tenemos que encontrar quién tiene carácter. Y la muchacha que le de un camello tiene carácter. Pero la que le de a los 10 camellos, yo quiero que mi hijo la conozca a ella. Sí, esto esto es esto es serio. Una muchacha que le dé agua 10 camellos es una muchacha de carácter. Ahora tiene que darle pago. Ella no se le pidió que lo hiciera. Ella ofreció. A ver, la escritura por tienen biblias. Génesis 24. Luego leemos unas citas para ustedes. Verso 17. Leamos el 16. Me gusta ese detalle. La doncella era de aspecto muy hermoso, virgen a la que varón no había conocido, la cual descendió a la fuente, llenó su cántaro y se volvía. Entonces el criado corrió hacia ella y dijo, "Te ruego que me des de beber un poco de agua de tu cántaro." Ella respondió, "Bebe, Señor mío." Y se dio prisa. Y bajó su cántaro sobre su mano y le dio a beber. Y cuando le dio, acabo de darle de beber, dijo también para tus camellos sacaré agua hasta que acaben de beber. Un camello puede tomarse de 20 a 40 galones en una vez, de 30 a 40 galones de una vez. Está dando agua 10 camellos. hasta que digan, "Estoy lleno." Le está dando agua a 10 camellos, no a uno. Y tampoco le pidió, "¿Puedo darle agua a sus camellos?" Lo que lo que dice, dice, "Yo le daré de beber a tus camellos." El carácter sabe lo que se necesita que hacer y lo hace. un un carácter bajo. Tiene que pedirles una vez, otra vez. Fíjese que cuando va a tomar el agua dice que se da prisa, la hace rápidamente. Entonces ve la necesidad y cumple la necesidad. Hay una necesidad allí que necesita ser. Si usted va al hermano y le dice, "¿Podría usar unos pocos dólares?" Usted ve que él está quebrado, que no tiene carro. Sabe que él necesita un poco de dólares. Por eso hate la pregunta. Si ves que lo necesita, el carácter no pregunta, el carácter simplemente hace. Cuando vio que los camellos necesitaban agua, dijo, "Yo le daré agua a tus camellos." Ven la diferencia de carácter. No solo es hermosa, pero tiene la habilidad ahora de humillarse a sí mismo y darle agua a los camellos. Y ni siquiera sabía que esos camellos le pertenecían a ella. Es correcto. Si hubiera leído la parte de atrás del libro o el fin de la historia, esa muchacha va a montar los mismos camellos, pero no puede decirle eso ahora. El carácter tiene que salir primero. Cuando encontramos el carácter, entonces podemos hablar de quién es la novia. Vamos un poco más adelante. Ella le da agua a los 10 camellos, le da agua al siervo. Dice la Biblia quear solo se echa hacia atrás un poquito. Si pudiera darle un cinco a alguien, se lo daría. Porque es una mayor oración respondida así de rápido. Ni siquiera terminé de orar y mi respuesta estaba ahí. Oh, me siento como adorando a Dios. Me siento como dándole la gloria. Pero se esperó un poquito, hizo la pregunta, ¿quién eres? ¿Y de qué casa naciste? Algo está edificando. Ahora se da cuenta quién es ella. y coincide con su oración. Es hermosa, es es hermosa. Le dio agua los relación directa con mi maestro. Oh, esto es completo. Momento de celebrar. Es un DM5. Puedes hacer eso. [Aplausos] Eso es lo que estaba pasando en su Oh, sí. Tengo la respuesta de mi oración. Estoy listo para irme. Ahora es una muchacha de carácter. Si dice eso, digámosle a mi familia lo que lo que transfirió. va a la casa de su familia, le dice este hombre, le dice, "¿Quién es él? ¿Cuál es su misión?" Y ella está de acuerdo en ir. Aquí hay una cosa extraña. Ahora, si tomas sus biblias, el mismo capítulo 24, verso 50. Entonces yuel respondieron y dijeron, "De Jehová ha salido esto, no podemos hablar hablarte malo ni bueno." 51. He aquí, Rebeca, delante de ti, tómala y vete. Será mujer del hijo de tu señor como lo ha dicho Jehová. Todos estuvieron de acuerdo. Verso 52. Cuando el criado Abraham oyó las palabras, se inclinó en la tierra ante Jehová. Y sacó el criado aljas de plata, alajas de oro y vestidos y dio a Rebeca. También dio cosas preciosas a su hermano y a su madre. Y comieron y bebieron él y los varones que venían con él y durmieron. Y levantándose de mañana dijo, "Envíame a mi señor." Verso 55. Entonces respondieron su hermano y su madre, "Espera que la con nosotros a lo menos 10 días y después irá." Y les dijo, "No me detengas, ya que Jehová ha prosperado mi camino. Despách para que me vaya a mi Señor." Aquí entonces la respuesta a la oración ha llegado. Es la familia correcta. Dios obró en ambos lados. Yo hice mi obra como Eliaer. Yo vi quién es ella. Ahora es tiempo de irnos en el tiempo de decisión, cuando Dios se revela a sí mismo, a usted hay un dicho que dice, "Doble el doble el metal cuando está caliente. No lo puedes doblar cuando está frío, pero cuando está caliente lo puedes doblar. Es el tiempo de hacer la movida. Ahora su oración está respondida. Viene la mamá y el hermano. Espérense. Ahora es una trampa ahora porque un día se vuelven 5 días, luego 10 días se vuelve 20 días. La la la oración ha sido respuesta. Yo sé quién es ella. Es tiempo de ir. Pero la mamá y el hermano le dieron un problema. En este momento aquí, este momento aquí dice Branam, un real siervo de Dios, él conoce su comisión y él lo sostiene a esa decisión. Ahora él pone la presión, dice, "No puedo esperar 10 días. Es más, no puedo esperar dos días. La oración ha sido respondida. Es tiempo de ir. Mi misión es completa. No, no, que espere 10 días. Ahora me preguntaba, ¿qué es esto?" Dice, "Hermano Branham en el mensaje, tiempo de decisión", dice él. Ah. tiempo de decisión. Fíjese en la en la superseñal, fíjese, él tuvo que lidiar con dos gentes diferentes. Hablando de Eliazar, ella tenía familia. Pero el único con el que Eliasar tenía que lidiar fue con la mamá y su y el hermano de Rebeca, pero él iba tras esa novia. Le dijo Abraham, "Ve y toma una novia de entre mi pueblo. No tome una de estas extranjeras por una novia. Que si que si la mujer no viene, si ella no viene, estás libre de este juramento. Luego puso su mano en su muslo y juró que Eliazar, fíjese que él encontró la mujer. É sabía que era ella y fíjese, tuvo que lidiar con dos personas, con su mamá y con el hermano. padre y el resto no tenía nada que decir, pero la mamá y el hermano también el mensajero, el Espíritu Santo de Dios, en este último día tomando una novia, tuvo que lidiar con la iglesia que se llamao la madre, la católica, y el hermano El predicador es exactamente tenía que lidiar con estos dos. Entonces, regresemos un poco en nuestra escena aquí. Abraham era tipo de ¿quién? Dios del padre. ¿Quién era el hijo? Isaac. tipo de Jesucristo. Elar es un tipo de el hermano Branham en el mensaje avergonzado dice eso. Tuvo que encontrar esto, pero el mensaje le dijo que él era el Eliasar. Si el hermano Branham es Eliazar, entonces, ¿quién es Rebeca? Rebeca. los que siguen el mensaje de Eliazar. Y Eliazar tuvo que lidiar con dos personas, dos personas en llamando una novia. Era la mamá y el hermano, la madre iglesia y el hermano el predicador. Y si yo he visto más problemas en cualquier cosa, no solo predicadores, eso muchas de las iglesias. Si usted pone sus ojos en el predicador o las iglesias, usted definitivamente va a estar desanimado. Usted encuentra falta. Usted encuentra una razón de rendirse de de cuitear. Hay hay cualquier tipo de fallas. Hay muchas fallas entre los hermanos predicadores. Pero, ¿hay alguna falla con Eliazar? No, en el mensaje estaba hablando con alguien de este mensaje, no digo con otra gente del mensaje o yo les digo lo que dice el mensaje, lo que dijo el mensaje el profeta, la palabra. Se lleva a alguien a Cristo, usted no los lleva a otros cristianos, usted lo lleva a Cristo la palabra. Estaba en una discusión con un caballero, en un hombre de la del séptimo día dentista, estaba hablando que la Biblia tantos errores y cuál es correcto y cuál no. Dije, "¿Qué Biblia usas tú? Si es un si es un cristiano joven, yo le doy este tipo de Biblia. Y si es un cristiano mayor, yo le doy este tipo de Biblia. Eso suena confuso para mí. Dije, "¿Qué sigues tú? Yo creo que Dios envió un profeta en estos días. Su nombre es William Branham. ¿Sabe qué hizo él? se enojó conmigo. Dijo, "Usted es gente con su retrato. Un momento, apenas te conocimos en una pelquería. Apenas te conocí y di usted es gente, apenas nos conocimos." Dije, "No hablemos de de ustedes gente. Yo no lo estoy llevando un grupo de gente. Yo quiero que me muestre por la palabra, donde por la palabra lo llevé a la escritura. Jesús dijo, "Si no puede creer en mis obras, si no quiere no cree mis palabras, entonces crean en mis obras, porque mis obras ellas hacen qué dan testimonio de quién soy yo." Si usted no cree mi doctrina, entonces crea en las obras. Y estaba discutiendo con él. Él fue al su carro y trajo un montón de libros de este tamaño, lo puso allí en la barbería y yo tengo estos libros. dijo, "Yo no voy a escutir con la escritura, solo muéstrame un hombre que tuvo un ministerio como el ministerio, pero las obras solamente cualquier hombre en o fuera denominación que tenga esas obras, podemos discutir doctrina, lo que queramos, pero las obras dan testimonio. Las obras dan testimonio del tipo de ministerio que era. Entonces, Eliazar tenía el reto de mantener esa novia y en en paso con su mensaje y la mamá y el hermano querían impedir, dice el profeta de Dios. Entonces, como el mensajero, el Espíritu de Dios en este último día tomando una novia, tuvo que llamar lidiar con la iglesia que se llama la madre católica y el hermano, el predicador es exactamente, tenía que lidiar con estos dos. Ellos fueron los que tiraron pataleta al respecto. Ahora, si usted es Rebeca, aquí está ella. está encontrando un hombre por primera vez y este hombre le dice a ella que ella tiene un novio, un un novio para que ella se case con él y le describe a ella como quién es Isaac. Ella no podía entrar a Facebook, no fue allá al match.com. Estamos a ver si sí o no. Tantas cualidades a ver si podemos hacer esto funcionar científicamente. Cuando naciste tú, cuando nací yo, ¿saben cómo lo hacen hoy? Ella no tenía esto. Ella solo tenía la palabra de Eliazar. Y aquí dijo, pregúntale a la muchacha si irás con este hombre, si estás anhelando de dejar la comodidad de tu hogar, tu mamá y tu papá. Todo lo que amas está aquí, todo lo que sabes está aquí. y estás anhelando irse con este hombre. Puede ser un fraude. No sabemos quién sea. Y pusieron la decisión en en en ella y esa decisión está puesta en nosotros hoy. Ahora, mira quién está aquí. ¿Está usted anhelando? ¿Está usted dispuesto a sacrificar las cosas del mundo para ir a otra tierra a que ver un hombre que usted nunca conocí? que usted no sabe nada de él, pero usted está anhelando y dispuesto a dar su vida por este sueño, por este sueño de ir al cielo. Ahora, no todos pueden hacer eso. Y fueron a probarlo. Dio, pruébame. Yo nunca he estado en el cielo. Yo nunca he visto a Jesús. He visto retratos. He visto la columna de fuego, pero nunca he visto al hombre. Él nunca me ha dado la mano. Yo no lo he conocido aún, pero algo en mi corazón, gloria, pero algo en mi alma me hace hacer la decisión correcta de decir lo que dijo Rebeca. Yo iré. Irás, irás tú. Yo iré a un lugar que no he ido antes. Yo iré a ver un hombre que nunca has visto antes. iré y yo pongo mi vida y yo pongo mi orgullo y pongo mi prestigio y vendo todo, doy todo para ir en este. Yo iré. irá usted parece ridículo para Rebeca de dejar su hogar para ir a un lugar que nunca ha estado antes, nunca conoció a este hombre antes. Pero es tan ridículo como usted de decir que va al cielo. ¿Ha estado usted en un rapto? Su cuerpo ha sido cambiado. Es todo un sueño. Contrólese, muchacha. Rebeca, ¿para dónde vas? ¿Quieres entregar todo? Parar de fumar, parar de beber, vas a dejar que tu cabello crezca. Vas a lavarle los pies a los santos. al a la iglesia el domingo en la noche o el miércoles de la noche. Oh, ¿qué pasa, muchacha? Póngase a ni siquiera sabes si es una historia verdadera. Pero Rebeca dijo, cazó el mismo carácter, fue el mismo carácter de de cuando alimentó los camellos. Le alimenté a 10 cabellos, recibí los dones y ahora estoy lista para irme. Estoy lista para irme con el hombre, con el que nunca ha ido antes. ¿Puedo o ir poco más? Rebeca era la hija del del sobrino de Abraham. El hermano de Abraham tenía un hijo y ese hijo tenía una hija y esa hija era Rebeca y estaban relacionados, relacionados por sangre. Y aquí está ella, viene y y le da beber a los camellos. Ahora miremos a darle agua a los camellos, porque en darle de beber a los camellos habla de un asunto de carácter allí. Esta palabra carácter es el atributos o o las cosas que que lo componen a usted, quién es usted, ese es su carácter. Gracia es un don. Eso es correcto. La gracia es un es un don, pero las palabras, las obras de lo que usted hace en apreciación al al don. Santiago dice, "Muéstrame tus obras y muestra tu fe." Pablo dijo, "Muéstrame tu fe y prueba tus obras." Dice hero Branam que Pablo estaba hablando como Dios vio a Abraham. Dijo que Santiago estaba hablando como el hombre se ve Abraham. Gracia es lo que Dios le da a usted. Obras es lo que usted hace en apreciación a él. obras son asuntos específicos del carácter. Si sus obras no son correctas es porque su carácter no es correcto, no es un don. Su carácter es lo que usted hace cuando usted no tiene que hacer. Su carácter las cosas que usted hace de las que usted no está obligado a hacer, pero usted las hace de todas maneras. Usted llega, usted va a la milla extra, usted hace lo que debe de hacer, son obras. Eso no lo salvan, salvo por gracia, pero de apreciación de usted está tan apreciado que usted lo hace. ¿Usted quiere vivir correcto? Obras están en usted, no están en Dios. La gracia de Dios te dio a ustedes. Gracias. Lo que Dios hizo por usted, nadie más lo hizo. Pero la manera que usted le sirve, habla el tipo de carácter que usted tiene. No todos se quieren quedar, no se quieren quedar, no quieren orar, no todos quieren llegar temprano, no todos quieren esta milla extra, pero Rebeca con carácter no esperaba a que se le pidiera. Ella lo hacía porque el carácter en ella, ella fue levantada correctamente. Su carácter era correcto cuando vio los cabellos. Ella no se movió así. Usted le pedí a alguien que haga algo. Okay. Oh, está bien. Yo lo hago. Y así es. Así es. Usted le dice a a un adolescente que limpie su cuarto, como que es su cuarto, como que usted hizo el desorden. Saque la basura a levantar leche. ¿Saben cómo cómo lo hacen? Así sirve mucha gente al Señor iglesia y si me mueva que me vas a bendecir esta mañana. No puedes decir nada que me haga decir amén. vienen a la iglesia como que están en un cuarto de espera en el dentista, como que le van a sacar los dientes. Pero esta no es Rebeca ahora. Rebeca está buscando por los camellos. Ella está buscando, está buscando. [Aplausos] El carácter hace cosas sin tener que le digan todo el tiempo el carácter. Encuentran los camos. Oh, aquí hay un camo. Yo quiero darle agua. ¿Quién le dijo que le agua? Nadie le dijo. Yo me dije a mí, dale agua a los camellos. Dale al camello. Dale agua al camello. Dale agua al camello. 10 camellos. Eso es carácter. Yo lo hago. ¿Cuánto me pagas por ahora? ¿Sabes cómo es? ¿Y qué hay para mí? Rebeca lo hace por lo que quién es ella. Ella viene a la casa del Señor buscando por una oportunidad para decir amén, buscando para para adorar. Ella busca por ungimiento para que llegue sobre ella, para adorar al Señor. El espíritu y en verdad. Esa es Rebeca. Eso es carácter. Los los los directores de Ces aman a Rebeca. Usted no tiene que decirle a Rebeca que levante la mano. Ella va a levantar su mano. Ella va a darle la alabanza a Dios. Sí. El carácter lo hace porque necesita ser hecho el carácter. Lo hace porque es una oportunidad de hacer. No tiene que es una oportunidad. Si vamos un poco más adelante. Aquí está Rebeca. Yo pienso que la hermosa Rebeca esta tarde dándole agua a los camellos, dándole agua a lo mismo que la iba a llevar. Ven, es lo que es el agua y el camello. Representan poder. La iglesia del Dios viviente hoy se regocija e dándole agua al poder del Espíritu Santo, que la levantará un día y llevarla al más allá donde está Isaac. Allí en el aire para las bodas del cordero. ¿Cómo es que Dios obra en ambas partes? Aquí está vaciando todo lo que tiene y dándole agua a los camellos. Le da agua uno, le da agua dos, le da agua tres. ¿Qué hora es? Le da agua cuatro. Agua cinco todavía en la iglesia. Le agua seis, le agua a siete. Oh, no está acabado. No es que yo no he acabado todavía. Yo tengo el agua [Aplausos] aquí. Yo tengo que darle agua a mis camellos. Yo tengo que darle honra. Y si hay 10 camellos, voy a estar aquí toda la noche dándole agua a los camellos. Porque los camellos que les doy agua, un día me van a llevar de aquí. Una mañana entre las 7 y las 6 y las 9 va a venir y va a llevarse a la novia y llevarla allí. [Aplausos] Dele agua, agua. Dele la alabanza, dele la adoración. Gloria. En el libro de la vida. Ella en realidad era dueña de los camellos. le perteneciera a ella antes de la fundación del mundo, pero tuvo que cumplir esta parte y cuando volteó y se da cuenta que yo soy la novia, yo soy una novia de Isaac. ¿Cómo se ve él? ¿Qué tan alto es él? Oh, dígame más de él. Y luego Eliazar empieza a decirle a Rebeca lo que de qué se trata Isaac. Y en el camino de regreso al hogar est ella está montando en el poder, está montando en el poder que la trae en la presencia del rey y lo ve a él y ella salta del camello y lo encuentra allí en el aire. Amor a primera vista. Isaac y Rebeca vivieron feliz todo el tiempo. [Aplausos] Adórele, dele adoración a él. Amén. [Aplausos] Gloria. El profeta de Dios dice esto en preguntas y respuestas. El mismo camello, el mismo poder. La bestia en la Biblia representa poder. Y el poder al que le damos agua de adoración y alabanza, agua, vida, alabanza a la palabra, es la misma cosa que nos van a llevar a la gloria, a encontrarnos con el novio. Ahora, alguna gente no quieren darle agua a los camellos, pero quieren irse en el rapto. Pero el espíritu del que usted adora y y le da alabanza, ese es el espíritu que lo lleva a usted en el rapto. ¿No es eso maravilloso? Ahora, ¿quién es Rebeca? Si usted es Rebeca, usted tiene que ser profesional que le da agua a los camellos profesionalmente, porque la novia es la única que va en el rapto y el poder del rapto era el camello. Y ella le dio alabanza al camello al darle de beber. ¿Sabe usted cómo adorar? ¿Usted sabe cómo cómo dar adoración? Tenemos que decirles todo el tiempo, tenemos que decirles que aparezcan temprano o que oren todo el tiempo. No deberíamos de el carácter lo hace porque necesita ser hecho. Yo hablé esta mañana mientras cierro. Como en Marcos 16, Dios nos dio a todos una gran comisión. Si en la visión de la novia, el hermano Branham se sintió responsable por la iglesia, que se presentó como el grupo mundano. Dijo, "Señor, ese es lo mejor que nosotros ministros podemos hacer." y se sintió avergonzado como que si le hubiese fallado a Dios, pero no lo hizo. la carga que él tenía. Cuando usted piensa en el mundo morimundo y y nosotros que somos parte de este gran mensaje de la hora, si usted vio a un bebé de estos autopistas con una bola en en su en su mano, jugando a la orilla del camino de la carretera, Usted estaría moralmente obligado de parar su vehículo y ir y salvar ese bebé. No importa quién era, si era blanco o negro o café, que no fuese cristiano, solo usted moralmente obligado. Si usted está en un barco y ve a alguien ahogándose, es su obligación moral como ser humano de tratar de salvar esa persona. Esto es solo siendo seres humanos. Ahora, ¿qué qué de ser cristianos? ¿Qué ser miembros de la novia? El profeta de Dios dice que él no fue al infierno. Él fue a las regiones de los perdidos y regresó y nos dijo, "Usted no quiere que su peor enemigo vaya allí. Y usted ha visto esta gente que son como un bebé que se está ahogando y sabemos cuál es la verdad nosotros, pero hemos perdido nuestra carga y la novia real de Jesucristo definitivamente que ella es la novia, ella tiene una carga en su corazón por los perdidos, por el Espíritu Santo. por la palabra de Dios. Ella no deja que ninguna iglesia se interponga, que ningún predicador se interponga. Ella es la novia, ella tiene carácter y su carácter lo hace parar su vacación para salvar a un hombre si es lo que se requiere. Oye, no estaba esperando salvarle la vida a nadie hoy. Voy a divertirme. Es vacación. Usted está moralmente obligado de parar su vacación y salvar a ese hombre, salvar a ese bebé. ¿Qué usted y yo, novia de Cristo? Queremos irnos en el rapto. Creemos que nos vamos en el rapto. Pero hay hay una carga y una vida que tiene que encajar. Ustedes jóvenes, ¿qué quieren hacer? Lo que quieren hacer es dedicar su vida al Señor Jesucristo y pedirle a él que tome no solo los dones que les ha dado, pero que moldee un carácter en ustedes. Porque el carácter no es un don. carácter. El carácter es una virtud, algo por lo que usted pelea, algo por lo que usted corrige. Y Jesús regresa por una novia que no solo tiene talento, que no solo es hermosa, no es solo limpia y bonita, pero él regresa una novia que tiene carácter, carácter. Y le pedimos que Dios conceda eso a ustedes. Algunos de ustedes jóvenes se empiezan a ser mayores y pueden ir a tener tiempo solos y nadie los ve ahora. El carácter lo hace hacer lo que es correcto cuando nadie está vigilando. Eso es carácter. Pídale a Dios que ponga en usted el carácter de Jesucristo. Muchos grandes oradores en nuestro día, pero nunca ha habido un carácter como el Señor Jesucristo. Y ese es el carácter que queremos tener. Amén. Dios los bendiga. No solo un don, pero carácter. Dios los [Aplausos] [Aplausos] bendiga. Alaba a Dios. Can you just worship him with me and tell him how great he [Música] is? Dios no rechaza oración. Oraciones, [Música] alimento. Nunca vi un justo sin respuestas o quedar en sufrimiento. [Música] solamente esperar lo que Dios irá hacer. Levanta tus manos. Oh, cuando levanta tus manos es hora de vencer. Oh, alabar. Simplemente alabar. Estás llorando. Alaba en la prueba. Alaba. Estás sufriendo. Alaba mi te alaba. Tu alabanza él escuchará. Escuchará. Dios va al frente y abriendo camino, quebrando cadenas, sacando espinas. Manda sus ángeles contigo a luchar. Él abre puente, nadie puede ser. Él trabajar para los que confían conmigo, contigo de noche, de día. Levanta tus manos, tu victoria llegó. Comienzo a cantar y alaba a Dios. Alaba a Dios. Alaba a Dios. Alaba a Dios. Alaba a Dios. Alaba Dios. Alaba a Dios. Alaba a Dios. [Aplausos] La gente necesita entender lo que Dios está hablando. Oh, aleluya. Oh, cuando él da en silencio es porque está trabajando. Lo creer. Oh. Basta solamente esperar los que Dios irá hacer. [Aplausos] Oh, cuando él extiende sus manos es hora de vencer. Oh, alaba. Simplemente alabar. Estás llorando. Alaba en la prueba. Alaba. Está sufriendo. Alaba y porte alaba. Tu escuchará. Escuchará. Oh, Dios. Para la frente abriendo camino, quebrando cadenas, sacando sus espinas. Manda a sus ángeles contigo luchar.
