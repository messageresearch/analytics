colleagues as you know Max and Romero the Caritas but you o primeiro Corinthos 40 and 1214 dos de condor fellow for autosequence collisions forever for continue to speed up because this is rare now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit and there are differences of administration's but the same Lord and there are diversities of operations but it is the same God which worketh in all mm-hmm but the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal mm-hmm for to one is given by the spirit of the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit mm-hmm to another faith by the same spirit to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another divers kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these worketh that one and the same self same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will continue my brother for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ 14:14 for the body is not one member but many mm-hmm if the foot shall say because I am NOT the

pleased him and if they were all one member where were the body mm-hmm but now are they many members yet one body journey my brother the eye cannot say unto the hand I have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet I have no need of you name much more those members of the body which seem to be more people are necessary so does one who said it's also a ok so no here is decent small lots of
