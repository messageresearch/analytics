[42:00] there are many ministers from different

[42:04] department of lugarus that came and
[42:07] they had spent like 20 years without
[42:09] talking to each other
[42:47] and instead of joining the bride you are
[42:49] separating
[42:54] that's why you think that brothers we
[42:56] are not working together
[43:05] but when a brother came
[43:07] to los hermanos
[43:09] we are broken
[43:28] i remember when when when the brothers
[43:31] were preaching
[43:35] there was a girl who had to come and
[43:38] hear the demonic spirits they are the
[43:39] holy spirit at their home
[43:46] and
[43:46] because of the world the demons started
[43:48] seeing fires singing angels
[44:28] [Music]
[44:36] i will say the other spirits calling
[44:38] calling
[44:43] she shows us if she has gone mad
[44:48] but through prayer
[44:50] at the end of the service
[44:52] i'll find the services because you
[44:54] should continue like that and we had a
[44:55] minister's services
[45:02] at the end of the service she came when
[45:04] she's normal
[45:10] hallelujah hallelujah so uh we saw
[45:13] science and wonders
[45:16] the sign
[45:31] the brothers were able to come que los
[45:33] hermanos put here on the benign and uh
[45:37] uh after that i'm i'm just looking at my
[45:40] time so that i mean i'm able to
[45:43] so uh there is a mighty revival going on
[45:47] in uganda
[45:51] in uganda because of what the what the
[45:53] brother left behind
[45:56] her
[45:59] baptism over hundreds and hundreds
[46:04] of personas being baptized
[46:08] we have never seen that before
[46:12] because
[46:18] [Music]
[46:26] continuing to

[46:38] continue
[47:07] so and i'm so happy that they are they
[47:09] have they have been doing the
[47:10] translation work
[47:17] and we are so much blessed in uganda

[47:35] the most when

[55:04] and said privacy blessed are the eyes
[55:07] which see the things that you see
[55:09] for i tell you that many prophets and
[55:12] kings have desired to see those things
[55:14] which you see and have not seen them and
[55:18] to hear those things which you hear and
[55:20] have noticed
[55:55] and my inspiration is christ is the
[55:57] mystery of god revealed it means
[55:59] spiracion viene del mensah
[56:33] [Applause]
[56:56] that
[57:08] the prophet said that god had a purpose
[57:10] and
[57:38] the self existence
[58:05] but because of that nature is his
[58:08] attributes
[58:11] attributes he started to speak out
[58:13] hallelujah
[58:17] let there be lights
[58:20] he created the heavens
[58:23] and begin to create the things of the
[58:25] earth
[58:28] existed but where was creating those
[58:31] things he had an idea pero quantity
[59:02] oh
[59:30] and everything was passing through
[59:31] before adam
[59:35] and adam was naming them
[59:38] but after naming all those things still
[59:41] he remained lonely
[1:00:12] then god put him to sleep and doctor
[1:00:16] then he made him a help man
[1:00:20] and when adam stood equando
[1:00:26] he looked as a being that looked like
[1:00:27] him
[1:00:31] because he was like a god
[1:00:33] commodity he had the mind of god in him
[1:00:38] he said this is born of my body
[1:00:40] is west
[1:00:53] and when god created them
[1:01:08] and god gave them his word
[1:01:12] lesbian
[1:01:13] super lover to protect them from evil
[1:01:18] but he left them on uh
[1:01:21] uh on a free will pero los vejo and
[1:01:23] libre al del rio because told him that
[1:01:26] if you if you eat on the tree of life
[1:01:32] you you you live pasta
[1:01:35] if you eat on the tree of knowledge of
[1:01:36] good and evil
[1:01:42] then you you die
[1:01:45] but god knew that they will fall peru
[1:01:50] because he knew that they would not what
[1:01:52] they would not be able to stand
[1:01:56] he wanted to reveal himself
[1:02:00] oh great to god or gloria
[1:02:02] when when when he gave them they from
[1:02:04] three moto
[1:02:06] uh agents they are free to choose
[1:02:14] hallelujah hallelujah of course adam
[1:02:16] could not fall okay adam nope
[1:02:47] famous layering conscious genesis
[1:02:50] you love him they are man
[1:02:57] you say there yes chapter 1
[1:02:59] yes and god says let us make man in our
[1:03:02] image after all likeness and let them
[1:03:05] have dominion over his the fish of the
[1:03:08] sea and over the floors of the air and
[1:03:11] over the cattle and over all
[1:03:14] the earth and over every crippling
[1:03:16] things that people are upon the earth
[1:03:33] created a man in his own image in the
[1:03:36] image of god created in him may and fear
[1:03:38] created in them
[1:03:46] and
[1:03:47] and god bless them and god said unto
[1:03:49] them be fruitful
[1:03:51] and multiply and ravish the earth and
[1:03:54] seduce it and have dominion over the
[1:03:57] fish of the sea and over the floors of
[1:04:00] the air and over every living thing that
[1:04:02] moves upon the earth
[1:04:09] is
[1:04:37] so we see that god had a family on the
[1:04:39] earth
[1:04:43] which was in a fellowship in harmony
[1:04:44] with him
[1:04:49] and was no problem at all he not be
[1:04:51] another program man
[1:05:34] and he started his campaign in heaven he
[1:05:36] commenced comments to companies
[1:05:39] and was kicked out of heaven
[1:05:44] and you see him creeping down into eden
[1:05:46] yeah
[1:06:58] discovered
[1:07:01] how we are going to bring children
[1:07:05] that was not god's way
[1:07:09] hallelujah hallelujah you've never
[1:07:10] waited enough
[1:07:27] because god already told him that he are
[1:07:29] going to
[1:07:30] multiply upon the earth
[1:07:35] but the woman was deceived
[1:07:39] and he came running to adam
[1:07:43] adam knowing that the woman is deceived
[1:07:49] he had the right to reject
[1:08:09] she agreed to join her in disobedience
[1:08:18] so adam was not deceived adam knew what
[1:08:21] he was doing
[1:08:36] was
[1:09:03] fear came in his heart
[1:09:14] [Music]
[1:09:28] pain
[1:09:29] pain fear automates you brings pain to
[1:09:32] you
[1:10:00] did you eat on the tree come mr delarvol

[1:10:08] us
[1:10:09] and he certainly now bringing excuse he
[1:10:13] excused he comments so
[1:10:28] so god goes again to the woman now
[1:10:34] because before god brings judgment
[1:10:40] if i see how to investigate primarily
[1:11:30] [Music]
[1:12:06] is going to crush your head

[1:45:30] touched them so much
[1:45:35] the presence of god
[1:45:39] because of this nature they are made
[1:45:40] they are free to release themselves
[1:45:58] the weakness in them is the nature that
[1:46:00] they are made la fragile
[1:46:35] because they have left their position
[1:46:38] or the
[1:46:52] because of the nature that we have made
[1:46:57] the way he made him
[1:46:59] alone
[1:47:05] no
