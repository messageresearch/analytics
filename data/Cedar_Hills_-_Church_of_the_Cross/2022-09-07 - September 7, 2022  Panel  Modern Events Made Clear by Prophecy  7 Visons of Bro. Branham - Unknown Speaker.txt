[Music] lord [Music] yes yes [Music] foreign [Music] when that name was first called upon nino avida a little child came to life and was filled with the holy ghost and this night we will also once again want to be full of his presence and to delight herself is it's our privilege to speak a little bit and bring a little bit of light upon what the prophet spoke of the seven visions that was given to our prophet and brother william branham [Music] [Music] i didn't think god would ever give me this privilege to be with my brother in the flesh he was the baby of the family just a minute for a minute not to be so tense pray for me i have about five things bothering me i fell off of my bed but i did tell my wife why did you knock me out of bed there are things that happen in life to see just how much we could speak on what can we say what's in our hearts what a pastor we have okay because he calls us and sometimes we don't want to do the job we get scared but what he wants us for us to do is to participate and it's better to obey brothers all our lot to speak on the seven divisions and nothing is by coincidence today is the 7th of september 7 visions here to speak a little bit on the first vision the first vision the lord shows to brother brennan is the invasion of mussolini of mussolini and he's seeing it very clearly i was thinking when i was contemplating on division this was a very cruel man he was a dictator yeah you know what a dictator is he does everything according to his luck as the mexicans as we say he said ethiopia invading such a poor nation almost [Music] they use the most horrible thing they could use against atrocities a and it was occupied by italia cruelly for 10 years mussolini from italy from mussolini and that began in 1935. it does not give you a lot of material this gives you the vision you have to go and dig out the information what the vision is declaring ethiopia is the land of the queen the sabbath the sheba is one of the most important figures of the old testament went to jerusalem all the way to jerusalem and it had a purpose and this vision is the first vision that god shows to brother branham so much death another invasion into africa but to show life and life in abundance at that time back then is life and you have seen it and your witnesses because this ministry is not going to bring down it's is establishment of that vision god bless you important fact about mussolini and this to chastise them with such horrible things millions of italians died because of the orders that was given by mussolini their leader mussolini when we see the idea of mussolini we see a man very wicked and very bad he wanted to go in such a way that he wanted to go and get trained to be a priest he becomes one of the worst dictators of the 20th century he communicated nothing to anybody on what his plans were and it is a type that reflects to us even within christianity [Music] it is things like those that cause disasters deaths yes and it's the same in the spiritual experiment i've been able to experience it not here i come from another country i've seen brethren families that die on the way because of the decision of a bad leader 2020 once again we thank god for sending a prophet william marion a message that we love so much and then we embrace as the scripture says they went forth in the wilderness as they went forth jehoshaphat stood and said hear so shall you be established to give us the opportunity the first coming of christ and that we believe lord bless this service and we support ourselves in the name of the lord jesus christ you may be seated in the second half he will rise as a dictator in germany and he would conduce the whole world into a world war mostra la lina siegfried he made the siegfried line and i saw that our troops would have a very strong battle to be able to overcome it division also showed that hitler would have a mysterious end adolfo hitler adolf hitler [Music] um he was born on april 20th 1989. he was born in austria it was about when he was three years old when his parents were familiar they took their family their children [Music] hitler was the third among the children and they they moved to to germany when hitler had the opportunity to go to the war it was one of the most fantastic and great experiences that he could have had i think but here's politico he associated himself with a political party there in germany this political party was called national socialist the national party of socialism that they work in he began to place new laws himself into a dictator he he put aside everything he was not interested in democracy and to make these laws it made strong his dominion and his sovereignty he became a dictator and authoritarian and fulfilling exactly what this vision said it would be okay for hitler this young man he would be the vision also spoke of the la lignia sacred about the siegfried line estalini amigo this sit-free line is a tunnel it was 300 kilometers long this secret line loquera is stalin what this line was it had approximately in its construction 18 000. [Music] it had 18 000 to 20 000 bunkers constructed in concrete in that whole line they put all these military artillery and these bunkers there's also a tunnel where they would drive cars germany took nine years to construct this wall on this line from about 1936 about to 1944 he spoke of how these bunkers of concrete would be constructed and how all the artillery would be placed in these bunkers the prophet saw clearly and described it very well june 6 1944 and hundreds to liberate europe from the germany's control and to be able to do that they had to break through that line aberlin when of these planes in sientos americanos hundreds and thousands of american soldiers and uh of the soldiers of the alliance that was the warning that the boy spoke to brother brenham how united we received believe in the lord and your god and you shall be established believe his prophets if the united states would have heard this voice how the united states would suffer a great loss there and the the armies of the alliance and human lives they would lose so many estados to the united states in all their alliances it took them six to seven months to break through their lines and to be able to liberate yeah germany from the control of of uh hitler how many lives were sacrificed the prophecy was fulfilled exactly the united states was suffering a great loss it wasn't until 1945. when of germany remember division that hitler would have a mysterious end and it was on april 30th 1945. when the publications first came out through radio television television hitler had died they declared that he committed suicide but russia could never prove that they and he took the world and germany to a world war he created that line almost 620 kilometers where the united states and all that their alliance suffered such his mom was a christian impressive it's just something too here's just something that says in broken cisterns these dictators feel so powerful established broken i'd like to add something i get excited you see the natural and also in the spiritual i i don't i hope not to get into problems with anybody and i'll ask the question how many nazis are here not so lucky not only here oh is and but within that lifestyle there began to be separations amongst themselves they came to have lots of power and then communism arrived and we must understand these are spirits that are evolving and many times as christians we put it in lines as i say back in my land you would go to a certain place and ask you what line are you from you know wow you'd say wow what what line i understand that i and according to the message there should only not be any more but one line by which the germ of god runs so seeing all this it brings me back to the same point what kind of a spirit is it that i have [Music] if i don't share with brother diego and i make a line and the prophet of god he also gave us a bomb and he says the most powerful bomb that god has upon the earth it is love solomon and the third vision was about the political dominion it showed me there was great three great isms and communism to speak on these issues we hear the word fascism we don't even understand what that is even when we hear the news these two faster these two political movements they drug within millions of people europa this is what was moving in europe it was something so fascism was born very intelligent did he he loved so much to read books the literature he liked the books of philosophers he's the one that puts in literature and writes this on fascism this happened in 1920 [Music] as you said at the beginning but when it's written in a constitution now it's not a thought now it's allah it opens up the way for it to become a dictatorship that's what fascism that's where it was born just to know that the characteristics of what it is fascism capitalism it's against capitalism they're racist about all about themselves they're very military-minded this power one is born here the fascism power this [Music] it was a national moment of the workers when it was headed up by adolf hitler did he adopt it forms certain characters in them where it talks about to purify the races we're speaking now on nationalism the isn't is of one idea now there's no longer political parties it speaks only of one person okay you hear people raise up to want to adopt these nasa's everything is public property and it proclaims social equality for allah sister there's there's isms fascism nazism and communism but it got my attention what ism means why would he say that ism i i looked at the word ism it was a significant term and i looked at what that was just a little bit more i found out just like it says here it's a systemic form significa that can mean doctrine school or movement that's the the term of the word isn't it mechanism or doctrine out of this one person can be a denomination the seven visions of the prophets like to read that verse for the bible says 37 amos 3 7. but he revealed his secret unto his servants the prophets the meaning of the word vision is it was headed up in the vision of a plastic car yes the car was running down very beautiful streets with a by remote control the people appear to be seated in this car without a steering wheel and they were playing some sort of game i'd like to go a bit further back to the times of noah because this was just a little bit costly candace says in genesis 6 8. it says but noah found grace in the eyes the end of all flesh is come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold i will destroy them with the earth make the an arc of gopher wood room shall that make in the arc convent and shall pitch it within and without with pitch is to have a reference with the time that we have revelation chapter 4 and this is part number two and he preached that in january i don't speak too much but now i'm speaking a little too much and i'll try to read it [Music] foreign abraham for the little help he gave me and now and uh and the only thing he done was foolish in sensato silly do exactly with his science exactly god never destroyed the world man destroys the world god don't destroy nothing destruction god tries to preserve everything the in the same paragraph a little further down so some fanatic only one and some of them these are the egyptian pyramids and we have the sphinx as well and how could we imagine that that would take place and something that caught my attention as part of the vision that there were supernatural powers and now this comes to fit in something that brother thomas preached in one of his his messages and god's astronauts as many people in this time have a mind music it's very scientific and it's good to go into science but this is a good part here science only proves that the materials we use hormonal are only things that we need to form to form something science cannot form it they can fabricate it they cannot create they can fabricate it science is something that we have that we can do we can do things with it without the substance you cannot then it is impossible to please god speaking of division where brother adam saw the cause in these uh cars that were bubble shaped or an egg shape and these self driving vehicles they would no longer use pedals or steering wheels but the the word of god the the word of the prophet does not like i said it's a reality what we are living now in california you're announcing in california if they get to the year of 2035 electricity quickly when you break your promise and your covenant with the word of god that is what has caused so many illegitimate members in the church is significance a group of men gathered together and declared well it that simply doesn't mean that organization and that caused all of the organizations we believe that because dr jones has said he said all a word of man be a lie the line of life also breaks and also the line of time has broken the covenant is broken [Music] it was all ruined what caused all of this that is what broke the covenant if you desire to read it in genesis in genesis chapter 3. and the prophet says it was given unto men to govern over the woman by the word of god she was no longer equal to you she was no longer equal to him you know she was the same as him but when she broke the word of god god decreed for man to govern over her genesis 3 16. the prophet says having done that being in that elevated order is she was at the same level as man she lost her equality with man cuando peco when she sinned idiot he was everything except the creator he was everything established he was at the right hand of god in the heavens and he was a great leader of the cherub the cherubims it was not formed as a part of the original creation there's nothing designed that could be so easily deceived as a woman there's nothing designed that could go to such a low level of vulgarity as a woman think closely there's nothing in all creation that could go down to such a level sweet wife begins to go out with another man and you see that poor man seated crying with his children that is how she is designed see you and i continue we are listen says he says it is the woman who is more beautiful not the man if it is the man then something is wrong in some place the seed crossed originally originally it was soul because she was made that to deceive is still working in here in these last days go to the beach they're no longer women but plastic and we need the he that picks up to recycle we need him to come by diablo i was reading and i said my god okay and the prophet says who began to work in her allah it is his principal weapon to make man fall and worldliness uncleanliness it's what the prophet saw in this vision how woman would fall into such a condition i want to add something to give a tradition to the next vision and according to the law she had to be stoned jesus implemented and jesus he knelt down and he began to write on this on the on the ground the bible says when jesus stood back up he asked where are them that condemned you but there was no one there in about this time or for this time and thanks god for we thank god for a profit i believe the greatest sign for his people as a prophet in that time there was a man who stood up he took a rock a stone and he threw it up in the air and when it fell almost all the coast of alaska sinks because there was someone worthy to throw a rock god bless you to the next vision states grows up a very beautiful woman but very cruel she had the people completely under her control i thought this was the rising of the catholic church the roman catholic church in america that it could also be a woman rising up with great power in the united states elected by the popular one a vote of women i want to take the words of brother when he says is a lot of people are normal people teachers and preachers of this message they've gotten ahead to try to bring what judgment means i stay with what brother branham said that god introduced his own word that's why i want to bring these words when brother brenham speaks algunas de las prophecies many of the prophecies are compounded they have a double fulfillment and he gives an example this is now we begin to see how this prophecy of this woman begins to be fulfilled this vision unfolded in 1933 woman that took israel into idolatry they were in such a backslidden state to permit is begin to see how this prophecy unfolds siegel mensah man following hearing the message that's the way it is when ahab was on the throne you say she obligated ahab to do it he's not speaking about his wife he's talking about the religion the catholic religion that's behind the scene the she he couldn't say nothing because it was his wife see how she's infiltrating very discreetly speaking of the catholic church at that time we were a christian nation the world news is that until now she's on the throne he's speaking about the roman catholic system el trono de la casa blanca the throne of the white house apoge but this system behind will push him to do that but she was the principal head behind the throne catholic and the roman hierarchy is not on the tone of the united states the bible says this the nation arise and an image likened to the beast the seventh vision it potentially was fulfilled kennedy the message in reality is you're seeing that fulfillment here clearly of the sixth vision but it doesn't finish there is in church catholic we've had one but it's in the message mark of the beast in my heart it says by grace the united states is what it is in the seven division i heard a horrible explosion when i turned around did you see what i was saying everything was right there there were craters smoking craters over all the lands no problem what are the signs at the end everything that is happening it would be plagues what happened with corona virus in in america i look and think how many of those they had to drop in order to destroy america i remember the angel said because the message teaches us and how we're lacking oil right now and there are many nations that have many reserves and the united states is one of them this president before wanting to do it and he can for his purpose against this god bless you brother and what will be glory we give you all the glory in the name of the lord jesus christ [Applause] amen thank you god servants may god richly bless you thank you for the word and applause to the creator can you give the lord jesus a mighty hand of a praise [Laughter] [Music] oh [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] there [Music] yes [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] is [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen god bless his word once again [Applause] a lot of interesting things going on in this world today but god there's no announcements of course
