everybody's having a blessed day today I sure amido I was asked to speak in front of you all today um and um Lord knows how much I like talking to people I'm a little shaky it's because I'm probably a little nervous but just work with me please all right now before I get into uh the details about this trip and uh how it personally uh I experienced it is I'm going to start us off with the scripture if you all good we stand yeah thank you and then you guys can say man if you haven't when this is so it reads yeah see he came unto his own and his own receipts now let's start off a couple days prior to this trip I remember when I was asked to go on this trip I was a bit nervous to give my answer yes or no if I'm being completely honest with you I thought to myself Joe you just moved here you opened said what makes you think that you're ready to go on such a big trip like this and that was just a reoccurring thought that happened for days in my head is so I took time and I prayed about it and I told myself Joe your pastor himself asks you if you would like to accompany them on this trip is I thought to myself the Lord wants to strengthen my faith he has opened doors that you've never would have thought would have been open and only the Lord knows how much I've told my parents how much I wanted to travel the world one day and see the beauty that God has created and little did I know that he was taking me to Jerusalem where my Lord and Savior Jesus now let's move on to take off I've only been on about three or four flights my whole life so I don't know much about what to do on a plane but I do know this aren't you supposed to sit down for the majority of the plane flights I have never heard about anybody standing up socializing while the plane is moving and honestly I was a bit confused I didn't really understand it India until I realized that everything that these men are doing they're doing for God like ours like our Pastor said um they stop whatever they are doing no matter where they are to go into prayer yes and I'm sitting there in a plane with about a handful of Americans the rescues and then some others so English at this point it was nowhere to be heard and I personally sat in the way back of the plane away from everybody however I did sit next to this young lady out in her mid-20s and yes she was Jewish so of course time went on in about the five hour mark we decided to introduce ourselves uh we began to talk about the Casual stuff you know like hi my name is Joe what's your name stuff like that and then the conversation kind of took a different direction conversations she asked me why are you going to Jerusalem who are you with so I told her who I was with and I began to explain my faith and our beliefs yes and I was I was I was going in I I started to say the name Jesus and she gave me this weird look she was almost a bit confused on why I was mentioning and she stopped me in my mid-sentence she said wait wait wait you think Jesus was the Messiah [Music] so of course I said yes too and she began to tell me that they believed that Jesus was just a man to them and John 1 11 came to me and I realized he came to his own and his own received him it was clear I I seen the bill that she had over her eyes so I I thought I was led to tell her about Moses and Elijah and I had mentioned the 144 000 Jews and I was going into depth about everything is and I could see her face start to light up with almost this hopeful feeling and I thought to myself maybe I'm speaking to one of those 144 000 Jews that would give their life to Jesus is so after a long flight we finally arrived this was and I'm sure the other brothers will talk about a few things that we did here and there and places we went in but I'm just going to focus on one thing and this is the garden and I believe I have a picture so you guys could see I don't know if they want to put it up here it's the first three pictures that I Monday so this is the garden tomb yes and let me tell you this place was something special the presence of the holy spirit that I felt La presents it was on fire in Fuego I remember before we went in recuerdo centrar the tour guide had told us before you guys came in this place was packed but you guys came at just the right momento perfecto it was pure Stillness it was beautiful all you can hear was the gust of winds moving in the trees and the birds chirping above you could ask and I was speaking with sister Ruth and she said Joe the Lord is speaking can you hear him she said come little bride I have something to show you and man when she said that the Waterworks just started flowing out of my eyes I truly believe he made a way for the bride that evening he wanted it quiet he needed to show us something and when it was our turn to enter history my aunt and my uncle Caleb actually entered first and as soon as they came out I heard her say I have good news he's not in here he is risen and as I went in I can confirmar Matthew 28 6 Mateo he's not here but he is risen as he said come see the place where the Lord and overall there's so much that I could talk about and go into detail about each and every site we've seen right each had their own filling each location moved you in a different way and in some areas where the other religions believe Jesus was buried or crucified you didn't really feel anything it really comes down to letting the holy spirit guide you and speak to you Mora and to be able to witness the amount of childlike love uh and what I mean by that is is the innocence and and the joy okay that my pastor brother Morton and fellow brothers and sisters had Mis Hermanos Hermanas it's it's Indescribable to try to describe it is it was like an instant Connection in some locations and because I can't really put it into words I have a few videos and pictures that I'd like to show you guys videos and uh I want to give all the glory to the Lord and I want to thank my uncle Caleb for giving me this opportunity I hope God blessed you guys with this pictures photos there we go and then on the I sent another set of videos of where um my uncle Caleb was actually racing brother Morton and that's kind of the child of love I was part of the video Sunday I don't know if you can see them and also greetings from the church out there yeah [Music] that's about it boys thank you brother Joe I can't remember go ahead buddy go ahead all right guys the last video that you've seen there can you put that back up there and just freeze it the one of them singing sorry not that one you can stop it but there was a they were singing the same song brother Joe in Cantonese and Grace just to give you a picture of how it is in Jerusalem but uh that is they were singing in the street okay not ashamed of the Gospel not ashamed to be singing of Jesus in a place that they didn't receive Jesus as the Messiah Jesus but as they began to sing in the street people began to come around them and they were so fascinated and they were listening they were taking pictures and to me Jerusalem is probably one of the most peaceful cities I've been in this world um you you think you're you're living in a Christian atmosphere you don't see a pair of pants walking down the street you may here and there but it you see nothing but long skirts totally different places you know so when we talk about this trip you know we we didn't go to find Christo you know we we accepted him as our savior a long time ago but I believe each one of us is at a different stage in our life reflect on this trip many things within me I believe I needed this trip you know because it's it's an eye-opener you know we started the trip on the plane and you you see all these Jews and the first thing that comes to your mind is that these people are don't listen to nobody these people are so indisciplined isn't it done in disciplinators you know and I'll try to be honest with you those are the thoughts that are coming to your mind but then as ours because this is a 10 hour fight it's just um and you began to see dang these these guys are serious about what they do you know the flight attendant or actually the the pilots getting on on the microphone saying you guys gotta sit down that's got to put your seatbelts on and they do not care of anything that said they couldn't even deliver food to us can we give us our drinks but they were not ashamed of who they were so when you go to the scripture that he read he came to his own and his own received him you know I always just looked at the second part that's all I cared about yes which is verse 12 but as many as received him which is us you know but you see the type of people there's a reason why they act this way to me it means that people is I don't know if you remember when we're reading a panel was chapter 83 in the Book of Psalms you go all the way back in in as far into the Bible as you can and it tells you about verse of chapter 83. these people that they were God's people they were his people he gave them promise after promise but this whole world has been coming against them Time After Time thousands and thousands of years they believe that they're God's people so we as Christians when you see that that's why I had to stand up it lights a fire within you yes if they believe that how much more should we believe being God's elect right how much more should our lives reflect Christ you know they they they're waiting for a messiah to come because they were blinded to the Messiah coming but they're still his chosen people because God and does God get their prayers she deals receives I believe he he sure does your girl can see you know we one of the things that we we did when we're down there we had the pleasure to to go to the Wailing Walls I believe this is the only remains of of the original wall of the temple is they go and they prey on that wallet because they believe just like the word says they would go and they would face the temple I tell you when your hands touch that wall to prayer you talk about the presence of almighty God you know because they believe so much in God you know they believe the light that is given to them us as Believers when we touch that wall Church talking about an experience you know it was such an experience you know some some of the things that some of the things that that we see in there was not what what I expected you know many we've preached this gospel many times but when you can see with your plain eyes things that we've preached on things that we've heard you know when when we pulled up to to the Jordan River where John the Baptist baptized Jesus not what I expected I expected this beautiful place yes okay so see if you can freeze that right there so this is this is the Jordan River where they say that Jesus was baptized Jesus it's a muddy Little River right there is is it is 30. you see all those green trees that's just right there by the river you look across the river you look this way of the river you're in the middle of the desert you know and and you see like what was Jesus doing out there so then you can you try and you like the scriptures start to make sense he went into the desert you know and you you could see many times how he would take his disciples they would be in the middle of nowhere we went to mount Temptation I don't know if they have those when was the middle of the desert you know it says high high mountain in the middle of nowhere is it you see how high and that's a good picture right there because you could understand where he was tempted it was hot he had fasted for 40 days just to walk up there we're out of breath we are being babies that we're dehydrated we were so Miserables and then you go and you see you see Mira how he was tempted we're Miserables I could imagine how Jesus feltia Jesus you know so you see these you see many things that were were not what what we are our our minds would think that we're gonna see is but then we would go local iwamos to the Garland Gethsemane you know that that was that was probably the top three of the places that we went yeah you know we we're walking down the garden because when you when you look from the Eastern Gate this is like in the valley you're going to kind of look down where the Garland Gethsemane was that is and then it goes up to the top where Mount Olive's the Mount Olive is so in your head you could you go and you start imagining and he came to the garden and you could imagine the agony that he was in and to me the presence was was more than bearable when we were there and it's told right there there are olive trees everywhere you go in in Israel you see nothing but all of trees how old those are on the size of the trunks you steps you know but to me that the presence that that we experience there's something that you know you can't words words can't explain that still is in that place just like anything else everything's commercialized every place that they knew something happened with Jesus or or where Jesus was something took place they established some type of church there yes but that still didn't take the presence that was that was there you know and then I know our pastor talked about the eastern the Eastern Gate you know but as we were standing on the Eastern Gate and our pastor began to play a couple of messages that brother Branham was was talking about on about the Eastern Gate you know and and the presence of God was was um you know I don't know how how to how to explain it you know probably because he had preached the message to us you know on how that Eastern Gate was sealed up come on but just to see it in Persona you know what and as the voice of of our Prophet was was uttered there is you know how how he he was he was crying out yeah I will meet you okay and I believe that he's going to meet us in the morning there in the Eastern Gate you know you know those you know the experience for me no experience you know it it made me really check my life to make sure am I really giving God every thing that I should be giving him God gave us an opportunity to go to Jerusalem and you you think on how these Jews dedicate their lives completely to him you know and then you hear you hear the prophet says have I done all that he's called me to do you know it makes it makes this this the Bible it makes it not just a history lesson but it makes it something to life to us you know I I believe you know I wasn't like Joe you're okay I wasn't invited but I said I'm going with the pastor I invited myself so you know I think they scrapped my pictures that I had up there yeah because the pictures that I had up there were all the faces Grace was making on this trip everybody's that was sleeping we got some good photos I guess those questions but you know this trip was sure was was a blessing to me and my wife and yes to experience it with with these these three youth that went with us was very very proud very proud of them you know seeing that you know and and it's it's who you go with it depending on Ken bus you know we we went with our brothers you know Martin brother Marcus and their families you know we we sure had a we sure had a blast and you know you know I believe our pastor needed a you know this more than anything I believe he he was totally you know in in relaxed mode you know but one of the one of the things as I turned over to Brother Carlos one of the things that just breaks your heart because when we went to the church in Jerusalem you know as the pastor was he was talking to brother Caleb Memphis you know and he told how he had no Fellowship but we don't realize you know we're where they're like the foreigners there in a place that that's full of Jews they can't have a church service freely and have meetings like we can Services it's almost like they're under persecution they get it's a hard time and your heart goes out to to a church like that is because we could come here and worship freely and many times we take advantage this is you know take advantage of just being able to come to church services you know but I truly was truly was blessed our time brother Joe yeah you started I said you know on this trip you go to many places but you know when you're sitting in front of the Wailing Wall you're sitting in front of the Eastern Gate it's just we have the best conversations that we've had in a long time and it wasn't with each other [Music] that is with God talking you know those you know when you're you're in silence you're you're at that Eastern Gate and you could God begins to talk to you in those comments then you appreciate it you can say I appreciate you Pastor about how they sell that Eastern Gate and how that Moses and Elijah would come and those Jews you you could see how how stubborn they are used yeah and how that they'll kill Moses and Elijah but then when they resurrect that's going to be a that's going to be a finale day because the same message that we have heard I believe with all my heart those Jews will here but I'm going through your mind while you're you're in Israel you're hearing the message in your head you're like you're all this is real everything we've heard all our lives this is the real thing you know and then when you feel the presence of God then you can raise your hand your head up and then you can say I'm a Child of God you see how highly God has favored us that there would be hope for us because if he wouldn't have blinded them there would have been no hope for us and that's why we live today that's why we serve him but you know it was an experience I know Brother Carlos is going to come up here foreign thank you brother Ben this is my Round of Applause yeah I like like the guys have said I mean it's it's something that I believe that I believe that every believer should do in their life and and I never could understand how they're there was people that would go back four and five and six times yeah and and so uh you know you we went we went I think we were there eight or nine days and we went hard like sun up the sun down we went to everything we could get to is and I think we hit maybe 30 of the stuff that that there is to to to see and and experience and and go through and all that stuff yeah it's vast it's it's it's just so uh it's 66 books of the Bible in in one place any other any other way it's it's a synthesis it it takes the Bible and it brings it to a level that you cannot comprehend unless you go there God's word becomes alive in a way that is Indescribable I can show you pictures I can tell you about it but to understand what God did in that place and to see it firsthand is is I I can't even I can't there's no words so we're gonna start off with this slide and I love you very much sister Lorraine and sister Grace and spirits but they are modeling the latest in in Muslim fashion this is at the temple Mountain which is completely controlled by the Muslims and the ladies have to cover from head to toe um I don't know Lorraine was about 95 degrees that day it's about 95 degrees and and it's like the middle of the day and those things are like like thick burlap heavy things so all we heard was okay everybody hurry up we're gonna go through this part really really fast oh so we went through this area kind of quick um so and that you can skip that slide and go to the next slide and I'm hoping uh that some of this is is will play as a video so guys I don't know if you can try to play that video I can maybe maybe not anyway um so this was it at Nazareth when we were at Nazareth are our guide this lady here um that lady right there was she was amazing because she was she was going through each thing as we were experiencing Nazareth in Eva's Nazareth is Tiny it was a city of like 300 people it's about the size of a good sized dirt lot I mean it's not it's not real big but the Tierra Grande but this is the this is is is is kind of a model of of where Jesus was was was teaching Jesus and she's showing how that Jesus had gone into the the temple there Jesus and he had picked up the scroll yeah and he read and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled is completed and when she read that and when she said that holy cow like it was it it brought that portion of scripture to to to life and you can imagine Jesus Christ standing right there and reading that and the crazy part was it meant nothing to nobody in that room no significance and and to me that was one of the things that was so incredible is we went to the Eastern Gate oriente and we had the most incredible experience with the Lord there Louis experience and we were the only ones to this day is the blindness doesn't just cover the Jews it covers all of the denominations because we were the only ones with the prophet that told us what would happen at that Eastern Gate and taught us what the significance of that Eastern Gate meant is there was not another Soul around but if you went to the Church of the Holy sepulchers thousands of people were there inside the city walls tens of thousands of people going around hustling bustling doing their things [Music] crying at different little churches that were around the way robbing the rock where they say that Golgotha was inside the Church of the Holy Sepulcher uh nobody Nadia so that was that to me was incredible I think they got it to work scriptures [Music] [Music] until a little later after Jesus started preaching and telling them some stories something happened and it went so amazed anymore and so um what did he say you might wonder so we have to go back a little bit to see historical background of where he was so he was in Nazareth Nazareth was a Jewish City or about maybe 300 people look so small um and so Israel had been ruled over by Foreign Foreigners for years and he had hundreds of years and right now the world and Romans and life was hard taxis were high and it was just they were waiting for messiah to come and to set them free to chase out the foreigners and everything would be happy and happy ending and there was Jesus he said meet the Messiah and they started telling them the stories about Naaman and about the Widow who didn't have any food and God helped her but it's my story now well actually the the stories he picked well foreigners that's right and people didn't like that what do you mean you're the Messiah and you came for the foreigners the ones who are oppressing us surely this cannot be right that must be a false prophet and they decided that they're going to kick him out and throw him off the cliff and so they actually took him out of the synagogue ready to throw him off and Tyler says Jesus just walk through between them and let's left Nazareth and he never returned here again he lived in I don't know how many of you guys caught that um but basically what she said was Jesus was saying really awesome things in that in that synagogue until he started kind of getting into more doctrinal points and because all of his examples that he was using we're all Gentiles and foreigners and the minute that he started talking about those people they said there's no way this could be the Messiah because it was only supposed to come to the Jews and they kicked him out of the synagogue so we when you hear things like that it blows your mind is uh so so uh next next slide is is this is Brother Morton is a I I love brother Morton that that man is he is so much fun he's amazing but he set us up he totally set us up from the get-go principle right so he told us okay I'm gonna take you guys to where they say that Jesus was crucified and buried and then I'm going to take you to where he actually was crucified and this is where they say yes please call the Church of the Holy Sepulcher is and then like like Ben said every place that they consider a holy spot or something where Jesus did something built church and edification Iglesia at a little church really really big church and there's gold everywhere and it's ornate and it's all this wow just amazing wild you know oh wow it's amazing and the place where you know that Jesus was buried Jesus and the place where you know that Jesus was crucified they built a bus station foreign next slide this is in Jericho when we went to Jericho he is Jericho's one of the ugliest places I've ever seen and I'm sure at some point it might have been a really pretty place but by the time I got there it was really really ugly boys so we get on this tram and and we're because the the mount temptation is there outside of Jericho and you can start kind of climbing up and that's the old walls that's the base of the old walls of Jericho right there yes that Joshua brought down so that was pretty that was pretty awesome next slide when we have some Bros uh oh um okay so this is the Al-Aqsa mosque and so this is one side of the Temple Mount is [Music] then on the other side of the Dome of the Rock and this is where they say that Muhammad was was transported to from Mecca and this is where he supposedly LED Jesus and Abraham and Moses in prayer and then he crossed the courtyard to the Dome of the rocks and that's where the that's where the Muslims believed that he was transported up you have an experience with God and that's so that's the significance of the two mosques that are inside the Temple mount but it's that Dome of the Rock what do I say is that that really you get there and that's the Abomination that's the one that sits on the holy of holies where the Shekinah Glory should be yes that's the one that it's got this it it's gold it's the gold the Dome is like like 24 karat gold it's real the auto is real and it's you get you walk there and it's the it's the worst feeling is because you know that that's where God belongs you know that belongs to him and that don't yeah it is you can see it from anywhere in the city it's just this blaring thing that just flies in the face of almighty God is and so yeah we we were we went through real fast this was this was really really tremendous I walked into a little shop and and I happened to see this picture and and and Jeremiah 7 11 if the guys I don't know if the guys can put it up there um but it says but go now to my place in Shiloh where I shall put my name right and and and so this image was only captured recently he said okay and this image was only taken recently yes and the way they found this image right here is they were building a hotel and the hotel wanted the Shiloh in Jerusalem Valley yeah like like the satellite image they wanted it like in their Lobby blown up so they they go to Google Maps and they they get the satellite image of the you know the flyover Google foreign and they're messing around with a little bit kind of flipping it around and they look and the the name of God is right there inshallah the mountains testify who that Valley belongs and he wrote his name right there so when the the gentleman that was in there he was talking to us and he says you know you know why they never found that it is he said because it was for this time it was for this time and so it would that was you know that was something tremendous next slide please aqui is the golden Menorah is the the Jewish people those who deals know exactly who they are they know exactly where they stand they know God's word better than anybody and they know that one of these days they'll rebuild the temples and the evidence of that is they've begun rebuilding all of the Holy elements that go inside the temple Santos Elementos there's a place called the temple Institute and they have gone through and rebuilt all the lovers and all the things and the different you know uh pots and all the different things that the priests use and then and they have it there and they are waiting is next slide please is where Jesus Jesus and when you walk into this little place the anointing that's there is out of this world I don't think I stopped crying the entire time walking in to walking out next slide this is uh I don't know if they can they can play the audio on this is in the middle of a city about I don't know how many million cows Darkness [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] that's good guys next slide [Music] they sang two or three different songs and had a had a group around it was tremendous Sea of Galilee is beautiful blue water crystal clear uh beautiful place Mark's kids were swimming in it it was cool everybody was rubbing their feet in it and it was it was awesome it was a beautiful place yes uh oh that's the front talking about the whole ornate thing I mean gold jewels and the whole bit that's where they say Jesus was buried Jesus can you see the difference between that and that other little place it's totally different yes we understand there's hundreds of people in this thing everywhere and you walk in there's nothing inside of you that that that there's no deep that causes there's nothing there's nothing next slide um this is where they say Golgotha was this is where they say he was crucified crucified and it's just a stone people walk in and Kiss It cry on it [Music] there's nothing there next slide that's the outside of the Church of the Holy sepulchers next slide the throttle that's the mosque of Omar which is literally right next door to the Church of the Holy Spirit so if you walk outside at the right time they do their prayer a sincere over loudspeaker uh and it's kind of eerie it's kind of an eerie sound the dung gate really kicked all the Poo out but yeah that was Mark and tab and uh David's there boy so that was the dung gate we we got to experience at dungate right inside the dung gate is is you go around the corner it's the Wailing Walls next slide that's the mount olives right there the Mount of Olives right there there's the Temple Mount is there's the Al-Aqsa mosque is that is Greek Orthodox uh Calvary Orthodox because they're hot it's like this cool fuzzy like like feathery thing that goes on top uh and that's Brother David but they start the Orthodox Jews they they grow up that way they they start that little and littler at the Wailing Wall there's the ninos there's guys like two years old there hey and they're reading their prayer books and they they understand what they need to do at that wall so they they they they they are born into that life next slide now I'm almost done I apologize guys uh Jaffa gate we were real familiar with that gate we came and went through that gate a lot next slide guys um okay Parable the sower this blue my brain I I didn't have the brain the rest of the day in in Israel in Israel Israel is like this Israelis I see it's just Hills and Valleys Hills and Valleys Hills everything's just goes up and down when you find stairs there right across from the Wailing Wall they call it the Wailing stairs because when you leave the Wailing Wall it's like like 10 million stairs just straight to climb out of that area you they build these Terraces and they pack the dirt behind the rock
