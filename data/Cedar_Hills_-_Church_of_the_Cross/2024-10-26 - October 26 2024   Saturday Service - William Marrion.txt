the Lord so sweet he's so wonderful at this time I'd like to introduce our Prophet William maram Bram Willi Bram we'll be continuing the message I have heard but now I see and I pray at the end of this we can all say that amen amen the 17th chapter and the 30th verse that he said in the last days that the son of man would reveal himself as he did just before Sodom and gomorah and the same conditions would exist you told about Moses about and I beg your pardon not about Moses uh but about Noah how that the people was eating drinking and so forth married and giv a marriage then he come around he said now as it was in the days of L so shall it be at the time when the son of man is being revealed now watch the son of man was revealed to Abraham's group as a man a prophet in a form of human flesh or ordinary man with dust on his clothes and Abraham called him Elohim now Jesus promises here that in the last days the son of man will be revealed again to that same type group The Royal Seed of Abraham just before the fire falls remember the church never received any more witness Abraham and then then the promised son that they were looking for was brought right away after that and the church is looking for the promised son he will come right after the days of this ministry be revealed from the heavens now we see it too plain it's got to be now the only thing there has to be is something Fates gets into a man God vindicate and tells him and shows him that that is the thing that happened and you your go to like Moses did he didn't want to deliver those children but God spoke to him in a burning bush he didn't want to go but he had to go Moses had heard of him being the great Jehova but then he could see he was in the form of a pillar of fire I've heard of thee but now now I see thee what was he seen in his word Vindicated God told Abraham that his people would sojourn in a Strange Land for 400 years but he' bring them out with a mighty hand and notice this Burning Bush gave Vindication to what the prophet Abraham had said would take place Moses said I heard of it but now I said now we've heard amen that in the last days that the son of man will come among his people and reveal himself to the people in the same way that he did at the just before the destruction of Sodom the son of man what did he do he know the secrets that was in Sarah's heart also give the promise to Abraham Abraham had heard God's voice he might have seen him in many different ways I don't know how I talked to him through dreams or through prophecies but this time he saw him I've heard of you now I see you and the church has heard of God they've read of him and what he did and the promises he made but now we see him with our eyes Hallelujah just the same as J I've heard of thee but now I see thee my what a difference Moses in that crisis cried out and we find out in Exodus the 14th chapter 13th to the 16th verse Moses and that great strain there with the children of Israel inspiration struck him and he said what he was supposed to say not knowing he said it see stand still and see the salvation of God God had never spoke to him yet see the inspiration struck him they said why did you bring us out here we are to have died in Egypt was because there's no Graves down there bring us out here and let us die we could lived in peace as slaves until we died but you brought us out here Moses a prophet knowing they had access to God was inspired and he said stand still and you'll see the salvation of God for the Egyptians you're looking at today you'll never see him again how did he know it was going to happen how did he know he didn't know what he spoke but his immediately after you spoke it God told him how to do it said Moses don't cry to me take your staff in your hand and stretch out over the sea and tell the children of Israel to walk amen the inspiration that's what it strikes you if you're sick that's what it strikes you if you're Afflicted something's revealed to you and you see that's been revealed you speak out I'm Healed then God tells you what to do rise up and start walking amen then it's all over when you can do it that way that's the way God does it then you see God manifested through yourself it was God that told him to do it now then all that was present all of Israel that was present saw that inspiration that struck Moses they seen God with their own eye blow that water back from one side to the other and that pillar of power let him right across the the sea he heard of God then they seen God Joshua was in an hour of crisis when the armies was routed and the sun was going down Joshua was a prophet and he knew that if them armies ever had a chance to unite again and come against him he would lose more man so in that hour of crisis when something had to be done there's only one thing if he could keep him running he'd rout him everyone down but there wasn't enough light to do it so Joshua stood raised his hand and said Son stand still and moon hang over aelon till I get to it this battle and the son stood still they heard Joshua speaking then they seen God with their own eyes in action Hallelujah sure see of course it was a paradox yeah to see something that seems to be impossible yet it's true but the sun Stood Still says the Bible I don't know what you people think it thinks the world's run now but anyhow the sun Stood Still perhaps Joshua never have tried to figure out how he was going to to do it how God was going to do it the only thing he said but son stand still he said it perhaps not knowing what he was saying because it was God that give it to him and he worked same thing in Mark 11:23 if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said will come to pass you can have what you said but you can't stand there fumbling your mind and say you've got to be inspired to say it amen excuse the expression but that day sitting there that woods and God's my judge and I can fall dead on this pull pit that scripture stumped me all my life sitting there that morning in the woods I was thinking on that and that boy spoke to me he said that scripture is like all scriptures is true and I thought well how could it be and he said you're I said he said speak and it will be that way don't doubt it and I was talking to somebody sitting out in the woods no squirrels been there for three days there's no squirrels there and I sit in a sycamore Thicket squirrels don't even come anyone H squirrels know they're not Sycamore and I've been sitting there wind blowing real hard about 10:00 in the morning and I was thinking again and he said you're hunting and you need squirrels just the same as Abraham needed a ram I thought that's always told me the truth but this sounds funny I got up from where I was sitting looked all around where is that person that was talking to me nothing wind is blowing real hard I thought could I fell asleep and dream that no I wasn't asleep I set up against a tree there watching supposed to pick up brother the woods and brother sopan back there just a little bit around 10:00 in the morning Farmers all out there working Gathering their corn I heard it again say you are hunting and you need game how many do you need and I thought now I don't want to overdo this I'm just going to ask for three Three Squirrels I want young three red squirrels I want them he said then speak about it and I said I am going to get three young red squirrels he said which way will they come well I thought I went this far there's something talking to me here just same as you hear me talking God in heaven this Bible over my heart knows that that's true and he and I said well I picked out a ridiculous place an old dry limb hanging out there about 50 yards where my rifle was shot in I said the first one will be right there and there he was I rubbed my eyes and look back I turned my head and I thought I don't want to shoot a vision so I looked around again there set the squirrel I throw a shell up in my gun aimed up I see his blacke young red squirrel I thought I I maybe I'm sleeping I'll wake up in a few minutes see I'm dreaming about this well I level down shot the squirrel and it dropped off the limb I thought well don't know I thought should I go over look for it and I walked over there and there it laid I picked it up blood run out of it a vision don't bleed you know so I picked up and it was a squirrel I got real numb all over I looked around I said God that was you I said thank you for this now he said but you said do you doubt what you said wow you said you get three now where will the next one come from I thought well if I'm Dreaming I'm going to continue on so I I said I picked out an Old Post over there of a tree that's all wrapped up with this sh poison ivy you ever get a squirrel in that so I said the next one will come right out of that poison ivy and there set that young red squirel looking right at me I set my gun down rubbed my eyes turn around again I thought there he said turned his head sideways I sh the squirrel and then I started to go home but said you said three do you doubt what you said I said no Lord I don't doubt what I said for you're confirming this is one scripture that stump me not if I say but if you say not if Jesus said it but if you say it yourself now I thought somehow I broke into that channel and I know he's here because I'm almost beside myself I thought I'll make this one ridiculous sure enough I said there' be a red squirrel come down off that hill come right down this way and right by me and go out and sit on that limb and look down at that farmer here he come down the hill went right out and sat looked at the farmer and I shot him Satan said to me you know what the woods is just full of now I sat there till 12:00 and not another thing happened it goes to show that when God he's the very creator of heavens and earth Hallelujah listing in in Jeffersonville now there's a family named R brother woods and I went out to see them they make the communion wine for the church little Edith was sitting there in the room a little girl and she' been sick all her life and so we'd always look to God to heal her her sister a widow her husband had been killed her name was Hattie very humble little woman and while brother Banks and I went out to get a rabbit they cooked a big Cherry of cober and made me sit down and eat was all sitting around the table we were talking about this it just happened a few days before and while I was sitting around the table talking about this all at once I said what could have happened I said brother right you're an old man honey squirrels all your life brother Shelby you're an expert squirrel Hunter brother wood so are you I've had sents a kid did you ever see a squirrel in a sycamore Locust Thicket no I said it just wasn't there I said the only thing I know is just the same God when Abraham needed a ram he was Jehovah Gyra he could provide for himself I said I believe it's the same thing and little old hadie sitting back there said brother renom that's nothing but the truth she said the right thing when she said that the Holy Spirit dropped over into that channel again every one of them felt it I raised up I said sister hadie thus sayth the Lord you said the right word like the sopan woman said the Holy Spirit speaking to me now and said for me to give you the desire of your heart I said now if I be God's servant if it is it'll happen if I ain't God's servant then I'm a liar and it won't happen I'm a deceiver I said now try and sense the spirit of God hallelujah she said brother ROM everybody was crying said what shall I ask I said you got a crippled sister sitting there I had $20 in my pocket to give to her that she had put in a donation woman don't make a Capal of $200 a year on that little old Poor Farm her and two boys her boys had got to be regular Ricky that school days you know and just sassing their mother 15 16 years old and all they were standing over there laughing what I was saying and I said you You' got a father and mother sitting your soul you haven't got any money ask for the money and see if it comes in your life ask for your sister see if she don't get up and walk I knew them like joob there's just something you know when you're strike it said I no here I stand before about 10 people I said if this doesn't happen then I'm a false prophet said what shall I ask I said it's up to you to make your decision I cannot make your decision she looked around the little woman and all at once she said brother brandom the greatest desire in my heart is the Salvation of my two boys I said I give you your boys in the name of Jesus Christ them snigger laughing fun making boys fell across her mother's lap and surrendered their life to God and was filled with the Holy Ghost right [Applause] there wow that is truth God has the authority to kill me before these people across the nation many of you here in in Jeffersonville I can hear the Tabernacle ring out now amen because we're sitting out there listening because it's a truth sir what is it it's when the God by his Sovereign Grace it happens outside of there it won't happen in that crucial moment think of the man and the people that I'm acquainted with God bypassing all the celebrities and everything to give a poor little old humble woman can't hardly sign her own name and he know that what she' asked for that's the greatest thing for her sister is now dead and her mother and father has to Die the money would have perished but the souls of her boy is eternal and that was an hour for them to catch it and just as soon as I said I give you your voice in the name of Jesus Christ there they call across your mother's La how many of your knows that to be true hallelu wow inspiration now I have heard of thee that thou could create squirrels I've heard of thee that thou could create a ram but now I see thee with my own eye a manifestation the vision made visable when God promised anything that's what he'll do notice when you have need perhaps like Joshua he had a need he never thought of the circumstances he spoke it and it was God you believe the son stood still so do I how did it do it don't try to figure it out but it did it Joshua did it and raised his hands that crucial moment he had access to God that's what happened it was timely the spirit of the Living God had seen the need of it and pushed upon Joshua to say it the same God seen the need of Abraham the same God seen the need of confirming this scripture to me that that scripture is true too the same God seen the need of those two predestinated boys and it was that moment he proved it and confirmed his word St Mark 14 we see a woman believed on him she had had need and se he had need for his feet to be washed she had only to be inspired to go into action I listen close to before we close she only had to be inspired to go into action because she' already heard about him she heard did he forgive a woman of her sins a harlot and said which one of he is without sin cast the first stone she'd heard about him but now she seen him she was inspired to Ser him that's the only thing you have to be let the Holy Spirit tell you that you're a sinner let the Holy Spirit tell you you're wrong let the Holy Spirit proved you by the scriptures that you're scripturally wrong and what because it'll only stir through one straight channel of every scripture of God it won't bypass for nothing if you do it'll never do you any good because the Holy Spirit can Inspire to you but if the soul isn't right with God as we've been through this week it's no good anyhow remember false anointed ones will rise in the last days not false Jesus is false Christ anointed ones and will deceive the very elected if it were possible notice she had a certain service to do for him she had heard of him now she's seen him with her eyes she had a service to do and she had nothing to do it with so she rushed forward anyhow to do the service God fished the water and towels to wash his feet she had heard of a living God all of her life but now she's seen him with her eyes she knew it was him and inspiration struck her said this is the messenger he needed a service she had nothing to serve him by his feet was dirty but she rushed forward anyhow to do him a service because she was inspired to do it oh backsliding church member denominational man or woman can't you see the need Jesus has tonight inspiration can only strike you this is the hour to do it but you seen with her eyes the others there were even mocking him they didn't believe his message frankly the host the pastor Hosto Simon had got him down there to make fun out of him they didn't believe he was a prophet so then when it seemed like the devil worked it just right in for him to say this he said in himself if this man was a prophet he would know what kind of a woman that was at his feet if he was a prophet see it wasn't even revealed to him who he was there couldn't be any inspiration strike him because there's nothing there to strike to but it was struck to her her eyes had seen Beyond his criticism she believed he was see the word of the prophets she know that that was all the words of the prophets was Vindicated in him she had heard he was on Earth but now she seesing watch what she done she seen the word made flesh the Messiah the Emanuel when she gave vent to her pulsation of faith of revelation of who he was in the time she was living that he was God's lamb for such Sinners as she was she went forth to serve his needs without knowing how she would do it wow that's where a genuine healing comes when is revealed to you that he was wounded for your transgressions bruised for your iniquity and with his stripes you were heal when it's inspired to you to see his pres here of St Mark 11 or St Luke 1730 that he's going to reveal himself in the last days among his people in human flesh like he did before Sodom when you see that and something strikes you the doctor might say the Cancer's still there the patient might say I I I uh uh I don't know how I'm going to walk but I'm going to walk anyhow we don't know how it's going to do she went farward to serve him because inspiration struck him struck her that that was the hour that was the messenger that was the Messiah who was the heal and she believed it and he needed a service unto him and she went farward without anything showing that she could do it she just went up on her inspiration watch God broke up The Fountains of the tear glands in her eyes the same eyes that had hurt hairs that hurt him the eyes that seen it broke up with joy then that Earth god-given long hair with them tears flowing down God furnish her towels with her hair and with her tears she served his needs the need of the Living God she had heard about but now she's seen him she could do him a service oh sinner why don't you do likewise as you see the needs now that he needs you your service now you see the one who once you heard about in the Bible we seen him last night come in here and what he done we see him meeting after meeting and sometimes we set this as cold and indiffer say yes I know the scripture says it oh I've seen it done see we have no enthusiasm it don't seem to strike us right they don't seem to be something like if you was um a pouring uh taking a match and strien it if the match hasn't got the sulur right on the head of the match it cannot strike and you can rake and rake and rake but if some chemical has killed the sulfur on there it will not strike there'll be no light but if that chemical the sulfur to strike against the metal will still on there when it strikes it'll light and when the true genuine Vindication of the scriptures of this life Day message and you see the presence of Jesus Christ that you would heard what he done in his life and here the scripture say he's the same yesterday today and forever and just before the Sodom condition is fired over with the wrath of God see Jesus return amongst his people formed in human flesh and do the same thing he done my or our souls to Glory it ought to do something to us why it's dropping on that you heard in the Bible what he did how the woman touched His Garment he turned around and told her what her trouble was and her faith made her whole now he promised that he would do that same thing again just before the world would be burnt and the world would be in a Sodom condition the New Testament the prophet the god Prophet the prophet of prophets the God of all the prophets the fullness of the godhead bodily God manifested In the Flesh the creator of genis hallelujah it's his word he said it would happen and we see Sodom condition we see the world in that condition now we see him come down and do exactly what he said he would do now we've heard of him now we see him I've heard of you with my ears now I see you with my eyes amen amen hallelujah I seen with my own eyes what an hour it should be what a time it should be the confirmation of his word always when the word is confirmed that's God speaking in his word making himself visible that you can see now here's a little old prostitute off the street she falls at the altar before Jesus and she washed his feet with with the tears and WIP with her hair God honored he said wherever this gospel is being preached let this be stole for a memorial to her why look how filthy she was but something struck she seen the word of the promise from Garden of Eden This Woman's seed shall bruise the Serpent's head she seen the Messiah that had been born of a virgin she heard us was to be born of a virgin but they heard that man was on Earth she heard that there was a young Rabbi Prophet who healed the sick she believed that and here she come down the street walking around looking around and she looked over there and seen that great party going on she slipped up to the fence and looked to and there he was there he was something said that's him that's all she need to be inspired see what happened she seen the word of God made flesh she heard heard with her ear now she saw with her eyes now everybody knows that we have a promise of the church condition in the last day the church in its present condition can never fulfill the Commandments of God the Great Commission can never call a bride out which one would do it amen the Pentecostals I should say not no n the rest of them that's a shuck that's on the wheat they come out look just exactly like the wheat but there was no wheat to it it opens up but the grain comes out of that they organize they killing themselves there's where they di there stalks but the wheat has come up through there and now it's begin to farm in the bride Farm the carnal wheat that fell into the ground through the Dark Ages it had to die that critic saying why would a god of Mercy could open up the Red Sea stand up that poor Christians be eat up with lies and burnt and everything instead of just like he laughed about it the poor ignorant did he not know except the cornal wheat fall into the ground it had to die through those Dark Ages like any other cornal wheat has to go beneath the Earth and be buried to bring forth in the First Reformation them two blades of Luther the stall it had come forth in the west out to bring forth the pil and the toss was the great missionary age had to come forth into the Pentecostal for the restoration of the gifts almost to deceive the very elect it looks like a wheat grain open it up there's no wheat there at all it's only shook but back in there then they begin to form the Oneness organization the Trinity organization the tunist organization the Church of God organization and all that organizing just death exactly and now what happens but it's a shelter for the wheat it's been growing through it all the time now it's beginning to pull away the wheat's begin to be seen this is not a Pentecostal age this is a latter age this is a bright age this is the evening lifeall this is when Malachi 4 must be fulfilled the follow God's pattern this is Luke 17:30 to be fulfilled this is the of Jeremiah and all the rest of them that Joel has spoke of these days this is that dayall I have heard Lord it was coming but now I see it with my eyes no many how many false impersonators r that jambers and jambers with all their gimmicks come do everything that Moses did never shut him Aon at all they know word like job they they know who their inspiration come from they know it was thus sayith the Lord and the same Bible spoke of them said they come in the last days impersonators amen those religious denominations when something started who started first Moses or them if they had started first first Moses been the inter the mimic now we got all kinds of discerners and everything else it's trying to draw your mind from the genuine thing of God which God has proven to be the truth by scripture Hallelujah we heard of it with our ears amen now we see it with our eyes amen hallah amen you believe it yes sir all our hearts inspiration and in that day when the son of man is being revealed the son of man Jesus Christ made manifest amongst his people a man walked down there before Abraham and his group just an ordinary looking man dust on his clothes had his back turned to the tent he said where is your wife Sarah not s a r r a s a r a h a b r a h a m not a r m called his name amen say where is it say she's in a tent behind you said I'm go to visit you according to the time of life and she laughed up her sleeve said why did she laugh now he promised them people was the one that was looking for a promised son now I don't care how much the people act in these denominations that they're looking for Christ their actions prove they're not right your actions speaks louder than your words all going think about making denominational members but there's some people one here and there that's looking for the coming of they're watching for those only those will he reveal himself to only those will understand just the elected understood who he was just think there's about maybe three million people Jews on Earth it wasn't onethird of them every know he was there till he's done come and gone but he revealed himself to those who were waiting John the Baptist and uh the apostles that have been called by John and so forth and blind an in the temple Simeon the priest that was revealed to him by the holy ghost that he's going to see the Christ all those great religious leaders theologians and things blind as they could be only can the rain raise the seed if the seed's already there and as you was a germ first in your father and he didn't know you yet you were in your father but through a beding ground of your mother you were made manifest in his life likness and then he could talk to you God the great God if you've got eternal life then the germ of eternal life was in God at the beginning and you were there you were in his thinking your name and all and he by for knowledge ordained you to see this and you that was not ordain will never see it but remember in the name of the Lord Jesus the hour is your won't you believe it am give your lives to him I have to stop it's after nine let's bow our heads I have heard Lord Of Thee now I see thee Lord Jesus bless this people as they wait now I'm going to ask you a question I'm going to let the Holy Spirit I trust that he will search out your mind try try your soul and see if you really believe and if you find there's a little bit of Doubt there will you raise your hand say Lord Jesus let me see you I've heard of you but I've never really seen you let me see you I'll believe all right it's fine is there some here that doesn't know him as your savior raise your hand say if I I'm a sinner but if I if you if you just let me see you Lord Jesus Manifest this word that they're talking about I know that that's how job seen you I know that's how Abraham saw you I know that's how all the rest of them saw you because it was a your promised word being Vindicated I've heard all kinds of things and gimmicks and everything but I understand that there's a Last Day message in the land that was spoke of by an Angel on the river in 1933 I heard the healing Services going forth and I know when that takes place it can't stay in that same old denominational rut it wasn't sent for that never did stay there what if Moses would come say let's build an ark like Noah did float out of Egypt down the river oh no no he had a message from God he was a manifestation that Prophet arising on the scene ought to approve to Israel right there they hadn't had a prophet for 400 years they hadn't had a prophet and here a prophet Rises on the sca they ought to know that something's going to happen Israel again hadn't had a prophet for hundreds of years and here come Jesus on the scene and the woman at the well said sir I perceive that you are a prophet now we haven't had one for 400 years because because he know what was in her heart see now we promised the church age to reformers and we've had him but he promised in Malachi 4 he'd keep his pattern in the last days what would take place to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the apostolic father for that very purpose and the church is so broke up in denominations and isms it's so tore a pieces to it's dead it's been a carrier and then he promised in the hour of the seventh Angel's message Glory the Seven Seals would be revealed and the mysteries of God would be declared Revelations 10 when the seventh angel begins to sound his message not the healing service the message that follows the healing service Jesus is a great guy as long as he can heal the sick but he said when I and my father are one uhuh that was wrong job was great till something happened to him see it's all always that way believe will you accept him now raise your hand say I do believe him I want to accept him God bless you God bless you that's fin I set real still and pray just a moment dear God in this solemn moment it's going to be a time like this when there really will be a clap of ther th someday and the Son of God shall descend from the heavens with the Shout with the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God the dead in Christ shall rise and each one of us knows and aware tonight father that we're going to have to answer for every

known among his people like he did to Abraham by his promise here that the son of man would reveal himself in the days that the world become in a Sodom condition and there was three Messengers went forth come down from heaven and there was a denominational group down in Sodom now Billy grim and Oral Roberts went down there and remember as I've told you nowhere in the history of the church has there ever been a messenger sent Universal to the church until now with his name ending like Abraham h g r a h a m six letters the world man's number but Abraham had seven letters in the name God's complete and perfect number see notice what the messengers did that went out in there preached the word called him out told him to repent but the one who stayed back with Abraham see performed a miracle by telling Abraham what Sarah was doing and thinking in the tent behind him and Jesus who was the one that was in this person said when the world gets in a Sodom condition like it was then the son of man will be revealed again and all the other scriptures confirming that to be so the in the beginning was the and the Word was with and the Word was and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us is that right now we see that same promised word of Luke of Malachi all these other promises from the day made flesh dwelling Among Us that we heard with our ears now we see him with our eyes
