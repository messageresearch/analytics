will be going to mexico city uh this coming weekend in mexico you would pray for so let's let's get into the word this is the third message on where do you stand and we learned that perfection is maturity perfection remember everybody remember from last week and today we want to find out how mature or perfect is your love so we pray that it would bless you i know some of you maybe had a rough week this week he says into the word and to the depth of it the enemy don't want you to mature he wants us to stay as little children but how many want to go on to perfection i want to go on to perfection or maturity so let's open our bibles if we can to the book of first john the fourth chapter primera de juan capitulo and it reads like this and we have known and believed the love that god hath to us how many have experienced that experiment let me see your hands you gotta i want to see if you know the the love that god hath to you and to us god is love can we all say that together god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him now here's here's where we're getting the the subtitle of our message herein is our love made perfect how many would like your love to be made perfect that we may have boldness [Music] [Music] he that feareth is not made perfect [Music] for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love god whom he hath not seen como peda maradios que no abis and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth god love his brother also am i am a tambien god add his blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated i pray that this can be a help to you this this morning i believe that when we speak of love it is probably one of the most misunderstood or misused words in all the human vocabulary vocabularies it has been used so loosely that the real meaning of love has been lost to many people it's simply that fuzzy little feeling you get in your in your stomach when you get around a certain person you hear people say oh he or she completes me let me see anybody ever heard that how many of you have ever said that pontos landicho you ain't going to tell me huh and all that is simply what you would call movie love it did you get that i'm going to say it again it's just movie love it's right we've watched too many movies and it has watered down love so much that many people are not even capable of loving them in the greek one of them is called phileo love and el gregos that's the love that you would have for your wife is the love it is divine love is and yet we put it all together if it's as if it's all the of [Applause] of those types two types of love and i'm almost sure and this is what i want to make sure we hit home today and i'm almost sure that many of us has been deceived i'm here this morning because i don't want to be deceived how many can say i don't want to be deceived preacher and thinking that it's agape love or divine love love is intellectual agape love comes from the heart godly love doesn't question human love questions everything human love reasons but godly love does not reason it just produces faith when you really that produces then you're loving him with a filio or human love did you get that i'm going to say it again there are many that have been deceived thinking that they love god which i don't doubt that they do okay but they're trying to love god with the human love and you can't love him that way when you love him like that your love has not been perfected yet how many are going to go on this trip with me this morning wants me to ask the question how much of you really love the lord jesus christ if you really love the lord jesus christ now my question is on what level do you love him it's important that we answer these questions because we cannot be deceived thinking that we love god with agape agape and yet we hate our brother or sister then your love is only a human love and you are deceived many of us has been deceived he says revelations the 12th chapter and the ninth verse and i want to put all this together and it reads like this and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and many of us has the whole world by making them think that they have agape love spencer and all they really have is affiliates think about that for a moment okay because we want to know we want to check ourselves this morning when we live by filio love instead of agape faith is not produced on that level understand that's why there's so much lack of faith today because there's too much deception oh i love i i love the lord oh you i'm one senior you love me he it would be so very close the bible says that it would deceive the very elect if it were possible thank god this morning that we know that it is not possible for the elect to be deceived has deceived the whole world but he has not deceived the elect satan then is deceiving today satan cannot love he puts a front as if he does love he doesn't come at you saying giving a hate speech no he comes and says let us all love one another he uses the same word and let's or one would go against what he's trying to do then you see the real nature of satan of lies who spews hatred mark 13 6 make sure you have your bibles because we're going to read quite a few scriptures here marco treste says 13 6 when you have it you can say amen says you got it all right for many shall come in my name is saying i am christ and shall deceive many i'm almost sure that many of us has been deceived they have a gopher love simply many would come in his name he says say i am christ why would there be such a deception we live in a day and age where there is more deception than there has ever been in the history of mankind why is it a deception because many are saying i am the christ i am christ is the anointed one and he is the very expression of god's love we read in first john four lamos and therefore god was in christ reconciling the world to himself love is not a feeling of the lord jesus christ there's no such a thing as agape love in your life do you love him on that level it's a question you gotta answer the question do you love him on the level that abraham did once again i quote our founding pastor there is a test i know you've loved me here yo i know you've loved me here i know you've done this for me i know you've done that yeah but i want to make sure that what you have is worthy of the promises all your qualities will be determined everything in you your whole disposition he wants you to love him on that level first timothy chapter 2 and verse 14. primera timothy but the woman being deceived was in the transgression what a type que tipo it was not jesus that was deceived nor jesus it was us the church that was deceived of a woman you know the other day i mean he is 80 or 81 years old and i began to tell him where the giants came from he looked at me as i was explaining to him i said now don't just take my word for it i want you to to know it by the scripture that what i'm telling you is not some man made something that we made up when i finished with him explaining the seed of cain and so forth serpent seed and i explained that to him he says and just to know it's been there the whole time why hadn't i seen it 80 years and i had never even heard this before ochenta ano it shows it when he wants when he chooses to reveal it to you when when the woman this is genesis chapter 3 verse 6. and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it you know that that's why it's such a surface thing when they when they say oh eve ate an apple table a lot of things but i want you to get this now it was a tree to be desired to make one wise he took of the fruit thereof and did not to see what really happened in the garden of eden it makes you realize that you're naked we should be passing out the apples today so many without their clothes maybe it's time to pass the apples but it was never about apples notice this now a treat to be desired to make one wise he took of the fruit and did eat and gave also one to her husband with her the serpent showed her something that she had never experienced the door was opened the door of desire la puerta forever that's why the bible says it was a tree to be desired to make one wise if we jump to verse 9 it says and the lord called god called unto adam and said unto him where art where are you standing come on that's that's the title of the message where do you stand this morning there's so many things that are pulling you know and here with us and here with and he said i heard thy voice in the garden it means perfect love is not present what happened to this perfect love perfecto by a perfect man that was in a perfect garden i was afraid because i was naked and i hear myself and he said who told thee hast thou eaten of the tree whereof i command thee that thou should is not easy that if he could control your desires he can control you come where do you think the greeks and the romans got their stories about their gods was the greek god of passion and fertility the god of love and sex means desire eros now i'm going to go back to what i said in the beginning with having filio erotic love attraction i pray you get these things write them down and you can study it when you get home for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish disobedient deceived serving divers lusts and pleasures living in malice and envy hateful and hating one another malicious i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee that's not a very popular scripture nowadays but what a thing it is when god tells the woman your desire shall be to her desire would be to her husband but watch the book of song of solomon's chapter 7 in verse 10. i am my beloved and his desire is toward me in other words her desire i want you to see this on another level we'll get to it in a moment when this happens and your desire has found its home is if you're looking around is because your desire nothing in this we look around and many times we become wandering stars we're wandering here and there and our eyes are wondering our hearts are wondering better is the sight of the eyes than the wondering of the desire i want to tell you today that you must as i have to do it all the time is but better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire do you see why there is such a fight that is going on today it's a fight for your desire and who will you give your desire to yeah james four verse one santiago cuatro verso uno from whence comes wars and fightings among you you can look you can look at this in your relationship with your spouse look at this in your home you can look at this in your church you can look at this worldwide why are there wars and fightings come they not hence even of your lost concupiscencias those are your desires your pleasure that war inside your members i want you to point to yourself this morning war inside your membership lord give me this and lord i need that always to satisfy what our lusts are the bible goes on to say ye adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity whoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of god then why do we have one foot in church and one foot in the world hello everybody ask yourself that question why do we have one foot in the world and one foot in church is it accompanies jealous amorphy genesis 4 chapter 6 and this is cuatro versus we're talking about the desire a little bit here and the lord said unto cain if thou do as well shalt thou not be accepted this is and if thou doest not well the end sin lieth at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and i'm going to say it again sin is lying at the door for every one of i want you to tell your neighbor that because this is important this morning [Music] hippocrates hypocrisy was a greek position they say one of the most outstanding figures in the history of medicine and he said this before curing someone them if they are willing to give up the things that got them sick hello everybody hola i'm going to say it again before curing someone ask them if they're willing to give up the things that got them sick we do the same thing over and over and over the same thing that gets us sick all the time are we willing to give up those things that got us sick why do we go out and do the same thing over again we're being led by the lust of the desires of our flesh but the only way to give up all those things that are making you sick a new heart also will i give you and the new spirit will i put within you what's that new spirit guess it's a spiritual level a new desire a new nature luke chapter 13 verse 31 reading all these scriptures they helped very much ayudan mucho verse 31 the same day there came cern of the pharisees saying unto him get thee out and depart hence for herod will kill thee. and i do cures today and tomorrow yeah and on the third day i shall be perfected go tell that fox that is because it's him in you god is love tell him that i'm curing today under justification and tomorrow under sanctification that's the place he's perfected brother and sister perfection he's perfected in you and i then mark 11 24 can be fulfilled in our lives therefore i say unto you that what things ye desire you see the natural types the spiritual so the church is in its complete maturity now you say well brother i wasn't even born when he said this is the church is in its complete maturity now and right now we're reading this right now you and i are on the scene and right now you and the church is in its complete maturity now perfect some man would insult her you'd shoot her shoot his brains out because it creates a jealousy but that's filial love and that's his secondary love then comes lust for another man's wife then comes filth it just becomes perverted perverted but all of this is a kind of love perez it had no beginning not any appreciation it'll have no end you know what for you are the son of god a daughter of god and your affections are placed on things above it is this scripture seems to always give people a hard time these are things that many many people even christians they say it's okay for us if any man verse 26 come to me and hate not his father mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters and ye and his own life also he cannot be my decision watch how we can be so carnal about things that means brother i gotta hate my father and mother hermano huh uh-oh you look like you like a deer in the headlights okay how many got a handle on what what what the bible's telling us here what simply means to love less it means that listen to this if any man come to me and doesn't love his father mother wife children brothers sisters even his own life if you love your father and your mother now we're going to get now into my message now i said all this to get to here now but if everybody understand where we're going with this those are very important because you've got to get and now pinch yourself i know sometimes oh yeah we start to fall asleep in church but i want you to get this now you've got to love him more than anyone else okay i'm going to ask you husbands are you wives i'm sorry how many of you wives love your husband more than you love the lord jesus says jesus you're not going to raise your hand because you know what i'm after already yet in our lives we prove it that we love our spouse our children we love them all more than christ yeah watch this now in the message the sixth seal and we we have gone through this but but watch as it pulls it all together i think they have it actually they can put it up up there on the okay on the screen for instance what if i dressed up and i went downtown i guess immediately but start putting your arms around me hugging me he's asking his wife this now what would you think she said i don't think i would like that very well if it had to be a showdown me or the lord jesus jesus he said now that's family talk he said the lord jesus jesus yes bill as much as i love you t-bill and but before i would give him up i would give you up now now watch what brother branham he's he's trying to get across now prostitute came and put her arms around me i wouldn't like that no no would want to roll up their sleeves and throw down i said now what if the same little woman that little prostitute would come up to jesus throw her arms around him and say jesus i love you jesus but with the lord jesus it's a higher many of us have had loved ones that have passed away even though we know that that the next the next stage or or event is the dead in christ will rise but let me ask you a question are you more excited to see your loved ones come on now i'm trying to see get you to see something here okay our [Music] trying to show our love to god with the same filial life i think you're tired i might as well quit okay i'll quit now i've had enough preacher yeah yeah well let's go just a little farther then it isn't jesus christ that we love the most senior jesus that's what he's after this morning the church they love me more see me and they love their families familiar do you love him more than anything else if we don't say no it's time that we doesn't when we love each other we love creation more than the creators of i show my love to god by by loving my husband loving my wife absolutely who gave you your husband he gave us your children you'll love before you can have faith so if you say you got faith and don't divinely love god your faith is in vain when i was your age i don't know what you're thinking i was your age you didn't answer that a little bit i was about to get married i was coming from colorado de nia de colorado couldn't wait to see my bride i'm going to get married all the way it is yeah yeah don't let me get in an accident lord bless them what a thing but do we love him how many can say i love him more than anything i love him more than life itself you're a free moral agent it is delivered you act on whatever you desire to act upon what's your whatever your soul is charmed for lo que tengai en su alma that's what you'll eat and since our soul is the nature of the spirit whatever nature we have dictates what our desires let me see how many how many have that desire there's a desire to want more of god there has to be more of god somewhere foreign to satisfy the desires that's in the body say it again desire over here and over here back and forth and then we hear him say i'm almost sure many of us have you can tell who is on your throne amen by your desire you can tell who is on the throne of your heart god deals with that subconsciously stop for a moment okay and i'm coming around the corner and and then we'll be stopping here god deals with the subconscious how many knows that we have a conscience and a subconscious mind and the way that our subconscious works is that it stirs you from within up here you're trying to think of something in your head but way down in the soul there's something else that's moving over i believe you were conscious about believing god and hearing his word but it had never come down to the subconscious i think now notice this now if they believe down here this is for all of us if you believe down here the way that you believe up here things would be different las cosas instead we walk around with a mental conception glory to god i'm healed but in your soul it's not saying the same thing think about this why we don't get when we ask the lord many times we ask a mistake healing to take place your soul it all has to be in cooperation with god with the channel of god and then the blessing can flow right to you we're so caught up with the conscious mind what we've seen what we say we have no idea what the subconscious mind is thinking okay and therefore see what our subconscious has been thinking wow we're talking about our love being made perfect jesus said have faith in god jesus you say to this mountain be moved it conscious and the subconscious and the harmony with god's word watch what will happen we've got to be in perfect harmony when i look in the mirror do i see myself in complete maturity love produces faith faith cometh by hearing why do you think you know sometimes they call it entertainment everywhere you go it's all about entertainment but in all reality it's not entertainment it's containment it's about controlling us what the world tries to do over and it becomes recorded then after a certain amount of time it becomes it becomes recorded in your subconscious and the more that your conscious mind hears something then it feeds it to your subconscious mind hello everybody hola say it again once it drops to your subconscious it becomes part of who you are how do you think how you act and that in turn will determine your destination you're safe as long as it's just in your conscious mind because you can forget what's in your conscious mind but once it's transferred into proverbs 23 7 says for as he thinketh in his heart you hear a bunch of gossip over and over and over again how you think in your heart and then you wonder why do i have these dreams and whoever can get the most information in your heart controls information that's why the greatest battle ever fought is there in the minds you work on this conscious mind by repeating repetitive things over and over the conscious mind makes the transfer into the heart that's why the battle goes on and we wonder why when we've done so many things for years and years and years we want to change they're on fire for the lord it's an infuego and what happens they go back to the same thing regressing what happened que paso they weren't able to wipe the subconscious [Music] you're conscious of it those things are building a kingdom inside of it but when it's been wiped clean olympia by the blood of the lamb that desire is no longer for [Applause] hello brother will would you come to the piano or else i ain't gonna see this are you with me estanco amigo i'm going to say it again become the word you receive the word i asked him this this morning how many of you can say i'm tired of loving him just as a human being you say brother i i haven't loved him like that he says if you're mature already god bless you guys but how do you know when you've loved him with a failure love hello everybody i'm going to say it again this is how we know we've loved god with a filial love estas because we get upset at god video love como se es que llamas con amor filio because when things go bad in our lives we want to blame god [Music] why could did you let this happen it stands there and knows that it's god's will there's a purpose for everything we go through loves him beyond any shadow of a doubt it is the love being perfected wiring of you and i that's why the capstone is the capstone of love corona is the piece of the ammonia even when we don't get what we think we want when we try to put the blame on god for something in our life you did it for them and not for me it the battle in life is for the soul of man we can win your body for you're here in church today [Music] we can win your spirit because we for god has found his resting the soul of your spouse is by far the hardest thing there is you can get someone excited about something but unless the desire is you say brother would you pray with me you can just say lord i i raise my hand with yours and i said lord idiosenor never do i want to serve you lord or love you with just a human love lord i want to love you with all my heart and soul lord i want to love you with all my mind lord with my body my spirit my soul where for me i want to present it all to you this morning [Music] i really love you on that level lord i pray that you forgive us lord peace but i raised my hands with them lord i humble myself this morning lord forgive me lord [Applause] i pray that you touch every heart lord every hand that's been lifted now and i say lord jesus receive them lord i have them lord the desire of their hearts lord [Applause] with everything that we have [Music] how i loved [Music] is [Music] because he first loved me [Music] and to me he is [Music] me [Music] is [Music] listen to this when i should be yet [Music] they are really and my heart is singing always wonderful to know [Music] and to me and to me [Music] is [Music] oh don't you love him i said don't you love him he's worthy to be praised and adorable just shake your neighbors and say no neighbor i love you too because i cannot love god without loving his children i gotta love my brothers and sisters that in itself shows that i really love god oh to me can you tell your neighbor [Music] tell your neighbors [Music] [Music] [Music] he's so wonderful to me how i love the lord jesus i love him more than life itself he is so wonderful [Music] oh yes he is let me tell you about my god to me he is so wonderful oh you know that jesus [Music] my beloved is mine and his desire is to you know [Music] just just for a moment don't be in a hurry just for a moment just tell him just as you bow your head say lord i love you [Music] oh he's so wonderful to love him on that level [Music] oh [Music] i'll never forsake you tell them lord i'll never forsake you lord [Music] i'll never forget [Music] let me ask you for a moment do you remember when you first gave your heart to the lord [Music] and then little by little he blesses you and he gives you illegal and it seems like the more he gives us the more starchy we become nos and then we sometimes think we're a little too good to raise our hands and cry thanking him and telling him how much he means i love you lord jesus with all my heart don't ever stop crying to him [Music] don't ever stop telling him he loves to hear the praises of his children we ask him and ask him and the next thing you know we're in church what's the matter huh you didn't get moved too much you wanted to jump up and down or what question go into the subconscious a little bit this morning find out what's really inside there from the subconscious comes that perfect love perfect
