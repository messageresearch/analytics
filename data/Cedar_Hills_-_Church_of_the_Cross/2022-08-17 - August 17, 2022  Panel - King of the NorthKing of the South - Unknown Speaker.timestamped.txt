[19:52] [Music]
[19:59] and Lord haste today
[20:02] foreign
[20:07] [Music]
[20:38] and we
[20:39] approached the author tonight and it was
[20:42] foreign
[20:58] Lord knowing all that you've done for us
[21:00] Lord over
[21:02] the years of Our Lives
[21:08] throughout history Lord what your Mighty
[21:10] Works have done
[21:14] or we see the current events yes
[21:18] eventos modernos right before our eyes
[21:20] Lord the land of the man was
[21:23] and we truly know how much you love us
[21:25] Lord
[21:26] [Music]
[21:28] or there's nothing that we could say
[21:30] tonight
[21:32] but it's what your word says
[21:35] we place ourselves in your hands Manos
[21:40] or just let the miraculous happen
[21:42] amongst your people tonight Lord
[21:47] in your name we asked
[21:49] amen amen you may be seated
[21:56] amen we have
[21:58] quite a topic tonight
[22:03] [Music]
[22:05] our founding pastor and our pastors
[22:07] always taught us
[22:11] how powerful the word is and we don't
[22:13] take a light anyway
[22:19] and the topic that we have tonight is
[22:21] the King of the North and the King of
[22:23] the South noches
[22:28] and we we've had plenty of time to get
[22:30] ready for this one
[22:34] and I first want to thank the ministry
[22:36] tonight
[22:40] because each group was constantly
[22:43] throwing some nuggets at us
[22:48] and I remember I I called unclean
[22:55] because he's the one who
[22:59] came up with this question is
[23:03] and so I thought I was gonna get the
[23:06] inside of it
[23:11] and he said I asked that question
[23:14] because I didn't know the answer
[23:17] is
[23:20] so when we approached this tonight
[23:24] you know the prophet God tells us who
[23:27] the king of the north is
[23:31] you know but when it comes to the King
[23:34] of the South he doesn't mention a whole
[23:35] lot of things
[23:38] but with the confidence that the Lord
[23:41] has given us I believe he's going to
[23:43] answer that for us
[23:49] hey man we're gonna I'm gonna read a
[23:52] scripture in the Book of Psalms chapter
[23:53] 83 to start this off
[23:59] address
[24:01] and let's start off with verse 3 to
[24:03] verse 5 Verso Tres a Cinco
[24:08] and they have taken crafty Council
[24:10] against like people
[24:12] and consulted against thy hidden
[24:16] onesultado is
[24:27] protegios
[24:31] they have said come and let us cut them
[24:34] off from being a nation that the name of
[24:37] Israel may be no more in remembrance
[24:45] Israel
[24:52] for they have consulted together with
[24:55] one
[24:55] consent
[24:58] they are Confederate against thee said
[25:09] and I want you to remember I hope hope
[25:10] y'all remember when when our brother
[25:12] Tommy Jr had started talking about the
[25:15] Confederate is
[25:25] Confederation you know so all the panels
[25:28] that have leaded up to this this this is
[25:31] kind of taking us to not the last panel
[25:33] but to one of the the finalities of of
[25:36] what we've been studying on it
[25:44] you know and then the pic the picture
[25:46] that gets painted for us
[25:49] you start seeing that Nations they may
[25:52] not agree with each other
[25:58] but through time you see how they have
[26:01] joined together
[26:05] always fight against Israel
[26:08] Israel and so when we go through this
[26:10] don't forget about that part
[26:14] you know because because brother Branham
[26:17] he tells us he warns us
[26:20] he said when the vision had came to him
[26:25] he says look at Russia look at Russia
[26:28] Mira Russia it didn't say fear Russia
[26:32] but I said look at Russia
[26:35] look at the picture that's been painted
[26:38] before our eyes
[26:42] and I think president it's so such a
[26:46] beautiful picture
[26:49] because of the scripture that is our
[26:51] base is
[26:54] going to be Daniel chapter 11. is Daniel
[26:57] capitolonse but it paints a picture for
[27:00] us
[27:01] and in many cases it's so plain to us
[27:05] muchas versus
[27:07] let me read this I kind of want to start
[27:09] off with this and then I'll hand it over
[27:11] to brother Jimmy
[27:13] um
[27:15] our pastor just came back from uh
[27:18] some great successful meetings in
[27:21] Colombia
[27:23] juntas exitos in Colombia and as he was
[27:27] as he was telling us about it I I had
[27:30] this you know the back of my notes
[27:35] and I said I gotta read this
[27:39] because this is basically where we're
[27:43] leading and where God has brought us to
[27:45] today
[27:49] in the message the angel of God
[27:54] God always causes trouble
[27:58] problems mostly always to bring the
[28:01] people together
[28:04] he said did you know that
[28:07] I believe there's a time
[28:11] when there won't be any more divisions
[28:14] amongst the people of God
[28:20] such as I belong to this church and I
[28:23] belong to that church
[28:24] is
[28:27] I believe the persecution will run all
[28:32] the way big Ransom Church all together
[28:35] will be one Church in Jesus Christ
[28:51] the Church of God together and will be
[28:53] one in Jesus Christ
[28:56] then he will take her home and
[29:01] we won't have to argue about this
[29:04] Doctrine or that Doctrine
[29:08] yes and I believe we're at that point
[29:11] where it's we're at that time it's time
[29:17] you know uh
[29:20] when we start to speak on the King of
[29:22] the North
[29:25] and the 11th chapter of Daniel Capital
[29:30] we must understand the Canon of the
[29:33] scripture
[29:34] or the totality of what chapter 11
[29:39] entails
[29:45] there's a more concentrated form of
[29:49] Prophecy in the 11th chapter of the Book
[29:51] of Daniel
[29:56] and it
[29:58] brings in a period of time of over 2300
[30:01] years
[30:05] and uh
[30:08] that's why there's no way we'll be able
[30:10] to do it justice we're not going to try
[30:12] to explain it all even though we can't
[30:14] to begin with
[30:21] but there's a reason why as you know we
[30:24] we look at this and we study this and we
[30:26] dig into it
[30:32] uh the theologians and the historians
[30:35] the hardly any of them believed that
[30:38] Russia is the King of the North little
[30:39] historianos
[30:46] and on the King of the South they'll say
[30:49] the King of the South is Egypt and
[30:50] they've got all these opinions
[30:56] but that's because they couldn't receive
[30:59] a little Prophet that came to interpret
[31:01] the symbols of the Bible
[31:07] and they don't realize the compoundness
[31:10] or how the scripture is compounded
[31:16] now why is the scripture compound
[31:21] as as I'm studying this I see what we're
[31:24] dealing with a period of time of over
[31:27] 2300 years
[31:32] and there's certain parts of this this
[31:35] prophecy that's in the 11th chapter
[31:40] that historically has already come to
[31:43] pass
[31:46] and that's all they can see yes
[31:50] they can not see an application of the
[31:54] components of how it means something
[31:56] today uh
[32:04] and why is the scripture calm down
[32:08] because as the prophet would say
[32:12] people will come and go la Gente vendra
[32:16] Generations will live and die
[32:20] hundreds of years ago
[32:23] but those Spirits never die
[32:29] and when the spirits have a course they
[32:32] say is
[32:35] to come to their finality
[32:38] or to come to the complete fulfillment
[32:41] of the scripture
[32:46] and that's what the people cannot see
[32:48] without a prophet is
[32:51] so I would like to start with the
[32:55] scripture that brother Branham referred
[32:57] to me
[33:00] even though it's at the very end of the
[33:03] chapter
[33:06] but let's go to
[33:08] Daniel 11
[33:14] . let me get it real quick
[33:19] Daniel 11 he's going to have it up there
[33:21] I'll just read it off
[33:26] I want you to notice
[33:29] it up until this point in in all the way
[33:32] to verse 39 hasta is
[33:36] talking about many periods of times
[33:42] he's talking about Kings and princes
[33:46] but all of a sudden in verse 40 he says
[33:51] at the time of the end shall the King of
[33:55] the South push against him
[34:00] that's against the King of the North
[34:04] and the King of the North shall come
[34:07] against him like the Whirlwind
[34:15] if you put that in modern terms we could
[34:17] say with military vehicles and tanks
[34:24] military with Horsemen yeah
[34:28] and with many ships
[34:34] and he shall enter into the countries
[34:37] and shall overflow and pass over
[34:43] verse 41 verse you know and he shall
[34:48] also enter into the Glorious land and
[34:51] many countries shall be overthrown
[34:58] but these shall Escape out of his hand
[35:01] even Edom Moab and the sheep of the
[35:05] children of Amen my sisters
[35:17] but he shall have power over the
[35:19] treasures of gold and silver over all
[35:23] the precious things of Egypt
[35:27] is
[35:34] the Libyan Libya libyans and the
[35:38] Ethiopians shall be at his death
[35:45] verse
[35:48] now watch this here
[35:51] but Tidings out of the East and out of
[35:55] the North shall trouble him
[35:57] foreign
[36:09] therefore he shall go forth with great
[36:12] Theory to destroy and utterly to make
[36:16] away many is muchos
[36:25] and he shall plant the Tabernacles of
[36:29] his powers between the Seas and the
[36:32] glorious holy mountains
[36:38] Glorioso yet he shall come to his end
[36:42] and None Shall help him
[36:48] you know and and the peoples of the
[36:51] world read the description and go wow
[36:52] what's his end
[36:54] is
[36:58] the beginning and ending of the Gentile
[37:01] dispensation
[37:08] starting with paragraph 100
[37:14] now Daniel has given this assurance and
[37:17] at the end of the Gentile dispensation
[37:26] when you go home tomorrow read 11 the
[37:29] 11th chapter
[37:33] and you can see how the King of the
[37:36] North is coming down
[37:41] which is nothing else but Russia
[37:46] coming down to press against it between
[37:57] and the great battle of Armageddon will
[37:59] be fought right they're near the Gates
[38:02] of Jerusalem is
[38:13] and when you go home read paragraphs
[38:18] 101 to about 112 and he's talking about
[38:22] Daniel 12.
[38:30] paragraph here because I don't want to
[38:32] get to reading too much
[38:36] Michael the great Prince shall stand up
[38:39] for what Miguel principles
[38:43] foreign
[39:11] I'll be overlap one with the others
[39:16] it's not that one event's finished and
[39:18] then another one starts
[39:23] as one is ending the other one's already
[39:26] starting
[39:28] and it shows you the picture or
[39:32] I like the way it says it in Spanish
[39:41] the scene
[39:44] so we'll we'll stop right there on that
[39:47] and say uh
[39:49] now since we're starting with the the
[39:53] end part where the King of the North
[39:55] comes and then it goes all the way to
[39:57] Armageddon how many want to be here when
[40:00] the King of the North goes all the way
[40:02] in the war of Armageddon takes place
[40:09] no we don't want to be here
[40:13] and now another question might arise
[40:15] here
[40:17] why doesn't brother talk practically he
[40:22] mentions the King of the South in a few
[40:24] places
[40:28] but he never goes into what it is
[40:33] but what he's going into is exactly what
[40:37] the scripture indicated in reverse the
[40:39] 40.
[40:43] the message at the end time
[40:46] and that's why God showed him what
[40:48] retained remain to this age so impresso
[40:51] is
[40:53] based on this brother Ben
[40:58] what is The Six Day War that happened in
[41:02] Israel in 1966 okay what does it have to
[41:06] do with the King of the North because
[41:13] when we look at the I know I talked
[41:16] about this a little bit conflict
[41:29] you know the answer
[41:31] is
[41:34] okay so when we talk about how Russia or
[41:37] the King of the North which is Russia
[41:39] starts to come down
[41:44] because I know we've talked about this I
[41:46] know we've talked about with Uncle on
[41:47] also
[41:49] um
[41:51] as far as when the bride's taken away
[41:54] when do you how do you see this
[41:56] happening will the bride still be here
[41:58] when the King of the North starts
[42:00] heading down versus you know and I I
[42:02] know
[42:07] [Music]
[42:09] but that's why I I stated right now how
[42:12] the prophecies and the ages of overlap
[42:15] foreign
[42:29] and he's gone into Ukraine yeah
[42:32] but in the combination or the complete
[42:35] manifestation of that
[42:39] [Music]
[42:40] prophecya he says this happens and he
[42:43] says it right here in this quote in
[42:45] these times is when this is going to
[42:48] take place is when the resurrection is
[42:49] going to come
[42:54] but right now the Gentile dispensation
[42:57] is very rapidly fading out but I can say
[43:02] it that way
[43:09] but when
[43:11] it gets down to the nitty-gritty and he
[43:14] starts going through wiping out these
[43:16] other nations
[43:21] if we were to read the scripture here in
[43:23] Daniel 11 it even states that Egypt will
[43:26] not Escape
[43:31] no Egypt will not escape
[43:35] and Egypt is directly south of Israel he
[43:41] Israel it's going to be destroyed
[43:44] then Israel which is right next to it
[43:46] why isn't it destroyed
[43:50] well that's about the time Revelation 19
[43:53] happens
[43:58] I wanted you to get into that part with
[44:01] Egypt
[44:04] so you you know when we look at before
[44:06] we start entering into the six day word
[44:13] so you you see the you kind of wanted
[44:16] the picture painted with brother Jimmy
[44:18] on that last part
[44:23] because to me when you look at the Six
[44:25] Day War it was to me it seemed like the
[44:28] first time
[44:35] that Russia wanted to do what the
[44:38] scripture states that he will do
[45:39] that's where you hear how a lot of a lot
[45:43] of these would talk about how that
[45:45] bullets would even turn a Corner
[45:50] Las Vegas
[45:53] that they didn't know why they didn't
[45:55] get killed and how they survived this
[45:57] Ware
[46:01] what was
[46:03] what was so powerful when I started
[46:06] getting into this is
[46:10] who was behind the wall
[46:14] and it was Russia
[46:17] you say how did Russia if Russia never
[46:19] step foot there is
[46:24] why couldn't they do nothing
[46:28] because the Angels were holding them
[46:30] back for the gym Los Angeles
[46:33] what happened to their airplane
[46:36] so so one of the one of the things
[46:39] Russia did not want to get involved in
[46:41] this war
[46:42] Russia
[46:44] you know they say that towards the end
[46:47] of this war
[46:49] yeah
[46:50] Russia was going to get involved yeah
[46:55] but by some reason they couldn't get
[46:58] their planes off the ground no
[47:03] uh
[47:05] so by the time they got the rack
[47:08] together
[47:10] I believe it was God that stopped that
[47:13] Ware
[47:15] but the way the war started
[47:20] is Russia sent a fake signal to Egypt
[47:23] Russia
[47:28] and what that fake signal was was that
[47:31] Israel was about to attack the Egypt is
[47:43] [Music]
[48:00] all those Arab countries go and start to
[48:03] attack Israel spices
[48:06] but months before this happened somehow
[48:23] began to arm
[48:25] Egypt
[48:28] so what was what was happening
[48:32] Russia knew all along what they were
[48:34] going to do Russia
[48:37] but they began to build Egypt up
[48:42] so that's why you see how why the
[48:45] scripture that brother Jim had white in
[48:48] chapter 11 why it says it that way
[48:57] is how that not even Egypt was going to
[49:01] escape
[49:03] because we could go back to the chapter
[49:06] 11 and you're gonna see
[49:11] and I believe our brother Abram's gonna
[49:13] touch on it in a little bit
[49:16] how through flatteries
[49:22] foreign
[49:28] they began to get
[49:31] to be able to work one month to another
[49:35] to work against Israel
[49:40] so as we've heard in the last pounds why
[49:43] is everybody wanting to go against
[49:45] Israel Israel
[49:53] we're talking about the Arab countries
[49:57] it's because
[49:59] they're the children of who is
[50:04] Ishmael right the Ismael you know and
[50:07] then you we could go into even details
[50:09] and there's some of the children of Esau
[50:11] there
[50:14] and that's why they hate Israel
[50:17] so that's why it here comes Russia with
[50:21] flatteries I I even Ivan Russia on
[50:28] um
[50:30] to get them to work with Russia
[50:34] or the King of the North to go against
[50:38] them but
[50:40] but when you start look when you start
[50:43] seeing the whole picture
[50:47] Russia is sitting back there
[50:50] and starts working to go against Israel
[50:56] but as we know what ended up happening
[50:59] is they couldn't
[51:00] god with his Mercy stopped it and he
[51:02] didn't let it go past itself
[51:10] amen how many understood that
[51:13] so the historians see this is
[51:20] Russia's already fulfilled that part it
[51:23] is
[51:25] and as we read in the very last verse of
[51:28] chapter 11
[51:29] verses what troubled the King of the
[51:32] North
[51:34] was movement in the north and in the
[51:37] East
[51:40] and then if we had a map up of of the
[51:44] way the Middle East and Europe looks
[51:45] right now
[51:50] and Europe Europa Europa
[51:55] at the very top of Russia
[51:58] Russia there's nothing further north
[52:01] than Russia
[52:04] but they don't understand the historians
[52:07] don't understand
[52:09] that at the beginning of the Russian
[52:12] Empire El principles
[52:16] it was called the Russian Empire
[52:23] and I'm not pronouncing that word right
[52:25] he says
[52:27] and they they even had Kings or Empress
[52:31] called Alexander their first Alexander
[52:33] II and third and so forth the Reyes
[52:36] Alejandro is
[52:40] these things are important but when we
[52:43] see the full manifestation or all those
[52:45] spirits that have gone through all those
[52:48] generations of people
[52:50] manifestations
[52:54] from
[53:00] and maybe someday we can get into Daniel
[53:02] too but we would not have time
[53:06] to get into that tonight we've got 30
[53:09] minutes left
[53:12] but here's where I would like to go with
[53:15] this I would like to go to another quote
[53:18] yeah
[53:19] in the entire Charming Church age I
[53:22] believe you guys got it up there
[53:28] and it's paragraphs 136 and 137. thank
[53:32] you guys foreign
[53:51] and I'll give you a little thing on that
[53:53] is
[54:00] have you ever
[54:01] or have I ever quote it to you that in
[54:05] the last conference they had up there
[54:08] for a cruise ship took off his shoe and
[54:11] beat the table with him
[54:23] there were five eastern Nations gathered
[54:25] there again since
[54:31] where did the pressure come from
[54:35] the East Del oriente all right watch
[54:38] this and then there were five Western
[54:41] Nations
[54:44] Gustav headed the Eastern nation
[54:49] is Eisenhower headed the Western Nation
[54:52] Eisenhower in Cabeza Las naciones
[54:55] occidentalis there's the two main
[54:58] leaders yes
[55:00] principales the two big toes
[55:16] and Russia
[55:21] means clay the seed
[55:24] Eisenhower Eisenhower in America in
[55:28] English means iron in English
[55:34] Okay
[55:36] based on this and there's a lot of
[55:39] things we could go into right there
[55:42] but brother Ben here's a question for
[55:45] you I want you to hit on this
[55:51] what's significance significance does it
[55:54] have
[55:56] this conference here with Eisenhower
[55:59] this was
[56:01] Eisenhower what significance did the son
[56:04] of Khrushchev play significance
[56:09] well we first got to start off with you
[56:11] know the Weber
[56:14] the debate in the kitchen you know that
[56:16] is
[56:19] is actually
[56:21] um
[56:22] wasn't Eisenhower but it was um Nixon
[56:25] Nixon was the Vice President
[56:29] Nixon
[56:31] they had this discussion and if you if
[56:34] you when you started getting into Cruise
[56:36] shipment
[56:39] you um
[56:41] he was a very cas
[56:43] charismatic
[56:45] Persona bien charismatica so you know he
[56:48] took over from where Stalin left off
[56:51] Stalin and just like brother Jim was
[56:54] talking about spirits earlier
[56:58] you know those that same Spirit of a
[57:01] mighty conqueror in the north is
[57:06] it went from one roller to another ruler
[57:10] and Stalin was before him
[57:15] and talking about conquer to their
[57:18] people
[57:20] you know they didn't care if they had to
[57:22] kill their own people
[57:26] they were major dictators
[57:44] so so you have here
[57:49] very charismatic
[57:51] Persona bien charismatic he's talking
[57:54] with Nixon
[57:55] Nixon and he's pushing Nixon
[57:58] Nixon he begins to challenge Nicki
[58:02] and which we know was the race to the
[58:04] moon
[58:07] but he kept on pushing that Nixon
[58:10] pushing that Nixon
[58:13] which caused this this race this
[58:17] competition well because Russia and the
[58:19] United States
[58:24] which when we go you go to the scripture
[58:27] and you start seeing it more clearly
[58:30] yes and from that dictator yes
[58:35] what really caught my attention
[58:39] the USSR broke up in 1991.
[58:49] and it was it was so many people wanted
[58:52] to know what the answers were
[58:57] many went to the files foreign
[59:29] either repente
[59:32] his son moved to the United States
[59:36] and becomes a U.S citizen
[59:40] of the Americano in 1991.
[59:44] and they began to sit down with him and
[59:47] try to pick his brain on his father
[59:49] information
[59:54] that that's incredible this is
[59:57] incredible
[59:59] there's another place I don't know if
[1:00:01] brother Branham said or I read it in
[1:00:02] news many many years ago
[1:00:08] the politicians were in a meeting
[1:00:13] one of the Russian Representatives rose
[1:00:15] up and said you know
[1:00:18] we will defeat you without ever firing
[1:00:21] one gun it is
[1:00:27] we won't have to go to a literal world
[1:00:32] yes we will beat you from the inside
[1:00:39] if that's not exactly what happened you
[1:00:43] see no excitement
[1:00:44] because what we see today and and the
[1:00:48] world order and then which includes
[1:00:50] religion and politics
[1:00:56] you can see now that this nation has
[1:00:59] been eaten out by communism foreign
[1:01:25] political party which I don't want to
[1:01:27] get in no
[1:01:29] communism
[1:01:31] is
[1:01:33] our nation because why
[1:01:37] because when God sends a prophet
[1:01:41] it's warning before judgment
[1:01:45] he sends that Prophet when there's time
[1:01:48] to turn back in real Professor
[1:01:50] but when they turn that down now
[1:01:56] the judgments begin to line up
[1:02:01] hermano Jimmy let me read this quote
[1:02:06] brother Jim on this one
[1:02:09] so
[1:02:10] very you know we look and everything
[1:02:13] that the prophet has given us
[1:02:19] when you see he spoke so many things
[1:02:23] that was meant for our day
[1:02:26] when brother Jim was saying that this
[1:02:29] code that I have just like literally
[1:02:30] popped out
[1:02:36] in baptism of the Holy Spirit 1958
[1:02:43] that's the reason Russia is playing
[1:02:45] exactly into the hand of God
[1:02:49] [Music]
[1:02:51] to rock this thing out of here
[1:02:55] the Bible says
[1:02:57] God is using communism
[1:03:01] he will use communism
[1:03:04] is communism that will destroy the whole
[1:03:07] thing is
[1:03:10] according to the scriptures
[1:03:13] and we are at that time
[1:03:19] now with this I'm I'm going to ask
[1:03:23] brother Abraham to comment on Daniel 11
[1:03:27] verse
[1:03:31] where brother Bennett makes a strange
[1:03:33] statement after saying everything we
[1:03:35] just said look at the the Simmons
[1:03:40] he says that communism and Catholicism
[1:03:43] will unite is
[1:03:46] and you go after all this how how is
[1:03:51] that you said the event so it is
[1:03:53] once we get to go a chance to go through
[1:03:56] the order of Daniel 11.
[1:04:00] which We're not gonna have time for
[1:04:02] tonight
[1:04:04] we'll see that in the verse verses three
[1:04:08] through six of Daniel 11
[1:04:12] says
[1:04:14] it started talking about the rise of
[1:04:16] another king in pieces
[1:04:24] and how his kingdom it wouldn't be as
[1:04:29] the way he had it before
[1:04:32] but it would continue but not of his own
[1:04:35] posterity uh
[1:04:43] foreign and when you study history you
[1:04:46] find out that that is
[1:04:48] Alexander the Great you're not going to
[1:04:50] go into that this is
[1:04:52] Alejandro Grande
[1:04:54] and it goes from there and it goes
[1:04:57] through each one of those things that
[1:04:59] Daniel saw on the vision right
[1:05:04] the head of gold yeah silver brass
[1:05:08] and then it all ended up in the wrong
[1:05:10] brother
[1:05:12] and roma brother Abraham now you hit
[1:05:15] that
[1:05:16] um what you've got on Daniel 11
[1:05:23] well they said that uh
[1:05:26] that brother Brenham didn't talk too
[1:05:28] much about or talk about the King of the
[1:05:30] South
[1:05:33] but he really talked a lot about the
[1:05:36] queen of the South
[1:05:39] could the King of the South be from the
[1:05:41] same place
[1:05:45] just think about it
[1:05:48] they say that Spirits don't die
[1:05:54] and we see that Putin
[1:05:57] he's the one that's gonna attack the
[1:06:00] King of the South
[1:06:03] and the spirit that anoints him
[1:06:07] Was the Same Spirit that anointed Adolf
[1:06:10] Hitler element
[1:06:13] because when Hitler
[1:06:16] started World War II in 1939.
[1:06:24] I hate to say but that's when I was born
[1:06:29] you know what Jackie it's good to see
[1:06:31] you amen
[1:06:34] I can still say like your empty route
[1:06:42] he says I can still sing in the choir
[1:06:45] so amen so anyway
[1:06:49] when Hitler attacked they call it the
[1:06:52] blitz Creek
[1:06:56] it means that he went from country to
[1:06:59] Country conquering country significance
[1:07:03] and you're gonna see here in the King of
[1:07:05] the North he's gonna start doing the
[1:07:07] same thing
[1:07:10] he's coming down and we're gonna start
[1:07:12] conquering all a lot of those countries
[1:07:15] that are in the South
[1:07:20] let me read here
[1:07:22] and I'm going to start with 11 27.
[1:07:30] and both these king's heart
[1:07:33] shall be to do Mischief amen that's the
[1:07:37] King of the North and the King of the
[1:07:38] South yeah
[1:07:43] and they shall speak lies to add one
[1:07:47] table
[1:07:50] um
[1:08:09] he was a prophet a prophesied it it will
[1:08:14] happen
[1:08:18] shall be at the time appointed yes
[1:08:24] it has already been appointed
[1:08:27] foreign
[1:09:06] [Music]
[1:09:08] but yet
[1:09:10] the end shall be at that time appointed
[1:09:17] then shall he returned to his land with
[1:09:19] great riches
[1:09:23] and his heart shall be against the Holy
[1:09:26] Covenant
[1:09:29] there is no way we can speak in the holy
[1:09:31] cows
[1:09:34] and he shall do exploit and return to
[1:09:37] his own land
[1:09:40] here we go again
[1:09:43] and at the time appointed he shall
[1:09:46] return
[1:10:00] or laprio Como La Primera what verse 30.
[1:10:06] or the chips
[1:10:09] shall come against him therefore he
[1:10:12] shall be grieved and returned and have
[1:10:15] indignation against the Holy Covenant so
[1:10:19] shall he do he shall even return and
[1:10:22] have intelligence with them that forsake
[1:10:24] the Holy Covenant
[1:10:36] Santo
[1:10:51] the ships they
[1:10:55] think who is
[1:11:00] it is Cyprus it is
[1:11:06] the
[1:11:12] young guys what does the word
[1:11:15] Mediterranean means
[1:11:22] young ladies
[1:11:24] what does the word Mediterranean mean
[1:11:30] the word self tells you what it means
[1:11:33] there is a guess tell him Hector
[1:11:37] Hector
[1:11:41] right it's it's
[1:11:43] the middle of the Earth yes
[1:11:52] but the ships
[1:11:56] because Cyprus is a country on an island
[1:12:00] of the Mediterranean it's Cyprus
[1:12:07] and is between turkey and Syria as as
[1:12:11] entered turkey
[1:12:16] and Cyprus is a member of the British
[1:12:21] Commonwealth
[1:12:23] Essie
[1:12:27] so here comes the King of the North
[1:12:32] and probably there was a blockade with
[1:12:35] all the British Commonwealth has 52
[1:12:38] States
[1:12:52] he saw all this
[1:12:55] probably all these countries of places
[1:12:59] and he says he got upset and with
[1:13:02] indignation
[1:13:12] verse 31 verses
[1:13:17] stand on his part and they shall pull
[1:13:19] with the sanctuary of strength and shall
[1:13:23] take away the daily sacrifice and they
[1:13:26] shall place the Abomination that makes
[1:13:29] their solid he said
[1:13:36] proof
[1:13:38] profan Naran El santuario is
[1:13:50] what is the Abomination that makes
[1:13:53] desolations
[1:13:58] well many of you will just say it's a
[1:14:00] mask
[1:14:05] but how long is
[1:14:11] and like uh Jimmy was saying is this is
[1:14:15] compound is
[1:14:23] because brother Venom said the
[1:14:28] Temple worship will be restored at the
[1:14:32] end times
[1:14:36] so I asked the question
[1:14:38] how are they gonna rebuild the Temple is
[1:14:42] a mosque of Walmart
[1:14:50] they cannot do it without mask of um
[1:14:55] so how are they gonna remove it
[1:15:00] it's where you and have to understand
[1:15:02] that you have to read between the lines
[1:15:06] to understand the message of yahwehies
[1:15:15] because it has to be rebuilt forget
[1:15:18] and another thing
[1:15:22] how even when they remove the mask of
[1:15:25] Walmart
[1:15:28] how are they going to build another
[1:15:30] Temple
[1:15:32] if they don't have a red heifers
[1:15:39] you need a red heifer
[1:15:45] and the red heifer has to be three years
[1:15:48] old
[1:15:53] so you tell me how come all this time is
[1:15:59] do you know when they destroyed the
[1:16:01] ashes
[1:16:04] because
[1:16:05] were made the red heifer was in their
[1:16:09] ashes were made in the times of Moses
[1:16:12] foreign
[1:16:21] become consumed they would kill another
[1:16:25] Helper and mix the ashes from the times
[1:16:28] of Moses with the other heifers
[1:16:34] until they sacrifice all this time nine
[1:16:40] hairs
[1:16:48] so who are they gonna get it nothing
[1:16:55] dozen
[1:16:57] Elijah has the power to bring fire from
[1:17:00] heaven
[1:17:06] so
[1:17:08] I think that's the way they're gonna get
[1:17:10] rid of that the temple is
[1:17:19] because they need to get rid of it
[1:17:23] because remember after the Rapture
[1:17:26] porque required
[1:17:28] then the comes the great tribulations
[1:17:33] and you're gonna see the great exploits
[1:17:37] done by Moses and Elijah foreign
[1:18:16] notice
[1:18:22] the Abomination that makes desolation
