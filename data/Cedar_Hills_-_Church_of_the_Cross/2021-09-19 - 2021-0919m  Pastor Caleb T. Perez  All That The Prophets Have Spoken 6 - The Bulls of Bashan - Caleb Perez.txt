taking some time off and others are sick keep them in prayer we greet you all in the precious name of the lord jesus christ of christ we are grateful to god we want to can you just maybe turn around just look at that camera those of you that can let's get to the ones that are online this morning wherever you are different countries and across the the nation different espacies different parts god bless you we love you blessed help [Music] and all that the prophets have spoken number six and maybe a strange subtitle the bulls of bashan but you know what i'm talking about yeah yeah how many know what the who the those bulls of bashan are what the scientists know well it's a good subject than to know right we will get to know this morning and then the scripture we have been reading luke 24. we have some people that we want to pray for afterwards and also we want to keep brother fidel in prayer also not feeling well amen luke 24 25 and 26 it says then he said unto them all fools and slow of heart you believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory necessarily amen one more scripture before we we sit down we want to take a look at david's life and see how perfect it typed christ remember and here we find in psalms 22 in salmos capitol in verse one person good to see all the young people and all of you with your bibles fills my heart to see that it reads like this and david crying out says my god my god why hast thou forsaken me why are thou so far from helping me and from the words father almighty god we come before you this morning lord the atmosphere has been made created we bring greetings from brother brother caleb duron and the tabernacle there in in tucson in tucson we were able to go and visit them last sunday had a wonderful time and it sure was pleasing to my heart after all these years to take brother diego especially amen you know i i gotta give a testimony before i get into the message but how everything happened was very it was so supernatural i don't wanna i'm gonna get myself into some trouble here but how the lord opened up the way for him to go ask him and i don't want to tell the details but but the lord opened up a window and here we find out as as i said uh psalms 22 1. david crying out to god my god my god why hast thou forsaken david imagine the condition that david was in imagine what a condition he found himself when he wrote this phrase or this this psalm a condition of such urgency desperation how many of you have ever prayed that before how many of you have ever felt so lonely and it's not it doesn't matter how many people are around you you can be in a room full of people and still feel lonely am i talking cry out to god and say god my god my god why have you forsaken me why are thou so far from helping me from the words of my roaring is the last david brother branham says in the message why little bethlehem david was in his worst of times it's when he was a fugitive and yet he was hated he was standing between two great deep fires here was the philistines on one side after him how in the world can it ever come to pass we ask the questions many times the devil on both sides driving at david he had taken refuge david's sitting there david center continue reading his throat burning him it was in the middle of summer the philistines was taking advantage of the split between david and saul and the philistines were looking for david also and the philistines were also looking for the israelites talk about a time of confusion just about like it is now everyone against everyone yes that's meant time we live in right then he got up on the mountain [Music] hot middle of summer and the heat was tremendous and here you've got he was fighting church of god if you know what you are then i want you to tell your neighbor say neighbor i know what i am saying she knew what she was yes because the anointing has been poured on her now that you know the back story now let's get into the message i know some of you are tired out hunting and pushing fire and going hunting gets a vacation and then you you you come back and then if you kill something then you gotta drag it out of the canyons and it's fun we enjoyed doing that but now that you know the backstory because there's there's quite a few hunters that are have come back so they might be a little bit tired this morning is that right bob ben sure had you all over those hills huh david and the condition and in the night season i'm not silent verse six but i am a worm and no man pesos a reproach of man and despised of the people verse 11 be not far from me for trouble is near porque language for there is none to help what can i nadia and i cannot do this here's where we're basing our of that's verse 16 at the assembly of the wicked having closed me they pierced my hands and my feet peros how tremendous it is and with jesus it was the same way the dogs lost we understand dogs is what gentiles who were who were around him the high priest and religious people anointed by satan in order to try to slay him surrounded by bulls and dogs i want to ask is is that right we choose no no i'm going to say it again demonology in the physical realm demonologia and physical demons in physical form demons but we also see demonology in the spiritual realm in the religious realms demons in spiritual form in the soul demon spiritually controlling right go to the you're surrounded by people people that don't believe unbelievers incarnate we see dogs and bulls everywhere what's going on surrounded however you want to pronounce it have beset me around let's take a look at these bulls of bashan that had surrounded david they don't like people coming into their territories amen they're territorial animals they're there and have been there for years generations and they control the region that they're in control now i i say this because those of you that that remember the first time that we we went or the second time i believe it was that we went into uganda the lord had showed brother diego a a big bull how can you remember that but as time goes on you you get to understand things a little bit more because these balls signify demonic presence nobody they're not bothered by religion because many of them claim to be christians but if you ever want to see bulls that make these texas longhorns look puny those two horns are two powers and those powers are what controls the people remember what those two horns were those powers not in the book of revelation i'm talking about the division here remember what's there there's two things that control the the people over there one power is poverty and the second one is violence those are the two horns that they control the people with that connector they keep the people poor man no wonder amos writes in amos 4 1 if you can turn real quick too hear this word ye kind of bashan khan word kind there is is cows right they can talk of a go ahead it can speak a kind can speak of a female cow masters bring and let us drink once again you see the two horns here sovereignty oppresses the poor violence crust the needy to kill anyone that comes into their region now we know that we have a real enemy is that right how many know that i mean by now we've had quite a few battles huh he saw a skull and we've heard this before a skull with a jawbone these are ministers that are beginning it looks like a dead body a skeleton a part of the mystical body of the lord jesus is being formed there in uganda in uganda how many how many love the lord for that santos now watch now we're all a they're okay if they're in their denominations anything that is a threat to these bulls they're going to fight you to the death toll why do you think men that have risen up such as brother rogers in monopoly manufacturing as they were baptizing all these people through the country who do you think ran brother julius and brother changi off the road and nearly killed him who do you think has tried to silence all these pastors even many of them that have died through the cover ministers of the gospel and not just there but through the whole world balls of bashan having camped about lost they have come past and they're after one thing to destroy and i can hear david crying out even more now amen amen though he's there doing his work that's not what we focus on now now we don't we don't focus on those things because our groom said in luke 4 18. spirit [Applause] but the spirit of the lord is upon me but the gospel is being preached all the violence that's going on with the other horns and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised when we talk about these bulls but did you know a stronghold can even be an incorrect way of thinking when we don't think properly we don't have the mind of christ an incorrect thinking pattern is formed when a person pays attention to the bull when the person rather [Music] something about our thinking pattern is not right that's the reason that we many times reason it's not our minds the word and it doesn't matter many times what you tell people maybe you don't i do i get in trouble every time i think demons thrive on strongholds because they are stubborn spirits the word strong horror stronghold literally means a fortress and the one controlling israel who controls your fortress skin control who's your king you some it's smoking others it's drinking got to ask yourself the question am i a stronghold for the lord or for saying a stronghold is a demonic force of pots [Music] you they become words for the good or for the bad parallel holo this bulls of basin i want you to really get this oh god that's your brother benjamin back there i i don't know if you you that that have not met him yet brother ben you can turn around this is brother benjamin he's from he's from uh from ghana and remembers the guy who's down here going to his school you pray for him and if you anybody wants to invite brother ben to your house to eat or whatever you can look him up after service but it's good to have him here again now brother henry preached a message sometime not too long ago and he talked about the king of the king his name if i'm not mistaken brother henry that king aug he was he was the he was like like the last of the of the giants is that right and and and this is where bulls of ba batian or bashan can you put that map up real quick just so that people know this this is part of israel israel but if you can see this pink part this is that would be known as as the area or territory of bashan now now notice something because we're going to get to this in a little bit notice up in the northern part of that is a town a city called caesarea philippi now you you you just notice that take note to that because it's going to help you that area was controlled by ing who was ruler of that territory and as the israelites they they began coming from egypt and they they they were right before they got into the promised land they had to come conquer him that part of bashan deuteronomy 3 1 if you can turn in your scriptures this is a good sunday school lesson and i sure enjoyed studying this i have no idea what time i started but that's okay deuteronomy 3 1 says then we turned and went up the way to bashan and og the king of bashan came out against us and he and all his people who battle at edre camino de abbas rey de basan para now remember the bulls the strong bulls of bashan they're around me david watch watch where this comes from but the lord said unto me don't fear him and he's telling you this morning you know jesus here are the strong bulls don't fear the we're going to find out how big this giant was notice this now he could say he says don't fear him or i will deliver him into your hands that should be enough of the remnant of giants his bedstead was a bad state of iron goes on and says it was nine cubits the length of his bed remember how how long that was brother henry yes it says nine cubits approximately 13 and a half feet long and it was six feet wide is a safe piece the anchor that's a big man he may not have been 13 feet i'm sure he was a big man that slept in that bed and there would come another king that was likened unto moses but there was something in it and just just just put all your thoughts to one side right now and just focus on the word this morning there was something so much more evil about bashan not just a giant king you know you go to certain cities right and there's certain parts of the city they say stay away from that area were considered gateways to the underworld realm of the dead [Music] this verse starts getting good i got their attention this morning pinch yourself if you're gonna fall asleep and at the base of that mountain was a town called caesarea of philippi now now those of you that know that know history you know that mount transfiguration many that they argue about where it really is many of them believe the majority in christianity believe that it's mount tabor but the bible says that that that he was taken up to a high mountain and there are many that believe that mount hermon is the place of the trans the transfiguration but whether it is or not i wanna i wanna i want you to focus on caesarea of philippi you got that amen tell your neighbor because you got to repeat it sometimes to learn it caesarea philippi known as the gates of hell in addition in the mount herman area apart they have found 20 temples of various pagan gods who have surveyed on or that they found in mount hermon and its surroundings and this caesarea philippi felipe was a city because it stood at the base of a cliff where spring water flowed it is known as the headwaters of the jordan river i want you to tell me somebody to tell me what great event happened in caesarea philippi media question of the day for you all i'm gonna go to the back have a couple should be the most well-known one of the most well-known cities in your mind in your heart because something great happened in caesarea philippi anybody alien i'll let anybody ministers or not anybody can answer ministers oh this is a good subject we picked on esther somebody help me philippi go ahead that's exactly right we should all know it was the great rock confession that happened in matthew 16 go now this is important all this is important i'm telling you come here for a moment you get brother emilia too come come with that's brother here's jesus okay think about this for a moment i want this to settle in good this morning he's taking his disciples and says come on let's go on we're going on the journey this was a little bit before his triumphant entry into jerusalem i i gotta tell you some things but we gotta go to a different town pueblo and you're gonna ask me where where where are we going you hold on hold on i can just see that here's the drama part of it jesus saying you just hold on i'm going to tell you in a moment but but it's a little ways get your walking shoes on the road for a while it wasn't somewhere real close it was in the northern part of the bayshon here comes jesus and he says okay as you're walking you know where i'm taking you all sabina and lo to the gates of hell you ever been to a pagan temple before temple pagano they have a bunch we're going to caesarea and i can see the the the disciples saying why are you taking us there sacrificing they finally get to the set them down but it could not be measured and therefore that's why they gave it the name the bottomless pit there at the very gates of hell the rock confession was made who do you say raises his voice father which is in heaven everything in the plan of god is perfect standing at the gates of hell never forget caesarea feel a pie from here build my church edifica is god gives us all this this armor is protect ourselves there's truth in that but we always look at the church of the living god always on the defense come on church that's not the church that jesus christ said he would build it he is not on defense all the time this why don't we go forward and attack and he's still making the announcement at the gates of hello i'm going to say it again jesus shows something different he is on the attack he goes to the gates of heaven he doesn't wait for caesarea philippi to come to heaven to invade satan's realm he went to invade saints gates god was so happy with the pergamian elect of that day because they had the same spirit sometimes i wonder if lord are you proud of us i didn't say that because i might hurt somebody's feelings [Music] don't say that because we're you got to be politically correct when you talk like that this is he was so proud of that brigade elect group they were through the name and faith of jesus christ right in the camp of the leaders of darkness they must have known what happened in caesarea quenching water brought the water of i don't matter what the pastor says check it with the word though let's say it again check it with the word we look at those things and we see such a there's always as i said this this kind of like oh we don't want to bother the devil he's asleep right now going good in my life right now he's not having no problem there's no in the message why christ speak there's no place to retreat let's go forward uh i can't give this up oh no go forward bye if your home says that you're going to be a fanatic the church turns you out like let's go forward there's no retreating back we have makes you jesus never promised to build a church that would be ashamed he promised to build a church of health cannot prevail [Music] so that caleb could understand as a man and now he will face the now this but it had to happen he would have just went back and seen the oh i'm going to say it again he's more powerful because he's deaf burial resurrection crazy he's gone crazy but there's something he has that's greater than his intelligence anybody know what that is i'm so proud of and he says that's what you think hey look it's there's been something but you see the blood of the blood that i shed come to take away the keys never again pedro don't even get me coined in that let me see where i start oh my lord it's already i'm going to stop there wait a few more minutes or okay let's take a vote let's take a vote two more minutes raise your hand [Music] there's a few of you like it got a lot to chew on brother las puertas they had we're either going to take down the enemy's strongholds in our lives or he's going to take us absolutely amen brother says god le man this is your strength the heart of every preacher in here when the world is by creeds and denominations and brotherhood is separated people are becoming worldly when god requires holiness for no man shall see the lord we can't rest in zion right now can we rest in him but there's a showdown this is the church of the living god that doesn't there is although we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnals but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds down the ass down pass it down it's a battle every day it's a battle down imagination we have so many imagination imaginative spots that we get one of them why they do that casting down imagination and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god amen amen we are surrounded no more and we have surroundings and it ain't going to get any easier it's going to get harder my next message that i could get into yes we're going to have to get into a lord willing unless he changes it we're going to have to get into the show that's a showdown yes sir amen brother branham says this said when they voted in the wrong presidency that's where the stronghold started boy does it got a grip now because no wonder psalms 22 20 says what are those bowls of on today 200 000 000 spiritual charges down the church of the living god only can go one way we're going forward not your neighbor neighbor we're going forward it's hard oh yeah but he already did it he already overcame yeah yeah what more do we want this morning how many of you can just raise your hands and thank him and praise him this morning and say lord i love i give you my mind i give you my strength lord i give you everything i have this morning as the holy ghost now goes to the congregation and i can hear many crying lord through their hearts because maybe they're they're not saying it with their mouths but i can hear some of your hearts crying out this morning my god my god why is that has made a circle around the enemy now circled around the enemy they have nowhere to go because the angel of the lord encamps about those that fear the enemy thinks they got [Music] they've surrounded and when he opened his eyes and that's what we hold on to yes a sister's sister would you come sister virginia hey [Music] do you need something oh just right where you're at i don't understand raise your hands you say hear my cry oh lord [Music] and he's been that to sister sister all these things that you asked the lord this morning sister he's [Music] here it don't matter how many bowls of baishan are around you trying to take your health trying to take your joy your peace the angel of the lord encounters about those that fear his name and in the name of jesus lord everything that has been asked now i stand with my faith joining with her faith and the word of god cannot be broken that you are the same yesterday today and forever and by your stripes we are healed and that cannot be broken receive it sister in jesus name it's all there for you praise him give him honor give him glory it's done [Music] oh father you see you see the hands of those that have lifted up who is this father their hearts are
