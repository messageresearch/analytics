[1:02] [Music]
[2:05] [Music]
[2:21] we were driving in his vehicle he was
[2:24] driving I was sitting in the passenger
[2:27] side and Blaine Southwick was in the
[2:30] back seat I don't know what Blaine was
[2:32] doing at this moment but brother
[2:35] brandham
[2:37] was just
[2:40] driving and it was a gravel Alaska
[2:43] Highway was still gravel
[2:45] there and he said he tilted his head
[2:48] back a little bit and he said brother
[2:52] Eddie what do you think of this
[2:55] ministry do you think it could be that
[2:57] of Elijah the prophet as its for told in
[3:00] the scripture and then he mentioned
[3:03] several time several places and then he
[3:06] said into Revelation and then his voice
[3:09] just trailed
[3:10] off well I want to stop
[3:14] there brother bram's voice when he
[3:18] was I would say deep under anointing in
[3:22] the deep in a
[3:24] vision he's actually in another
[3:27] world and he would say uh-huh
[3:31] uh-huh you notice when he was when he is
[3:35] has people before him and he starts
[3:38] telling them in detail about their lives
[3:42] and about why they're there and you're
[3:45] praying for someone and he was in the
[3:47] war and you have a letter from your
[3:50] daughter in your purse and uhhuh uhhuh
[3:54] and his voice would just get what I call
[3:57] thick kind of Deep thick and trails off
[4:02] and sometimes not very clear in what
[4:05] he's
[4:06] saying not too hard not too easy to hear
[4:10] well that's how the voice went and so I
[4:13] knew that he was just
[4:15] under uh in a deep somewhere in a deep
[4:20] Vision said what do you think of this
[4:23] ministry he did not say my Ministry he
[4:26] said this ministry you think it could be
[4:29] that of Elijah the prophet as it's
[4:31] foretold in the scriptures in the
[4:33] Revelation and so on and then he just
[4:36] trailed
[4:38] off I said
[4:40] well for I felt very
[4:43] inadequate to answer that kind of a
[4:46] question I didn't feel spiritually
[4:49] adequate you know I didn't
[4:52] feel as though I was adequate to answer
[4:55] that question and I looked down at the
[4:57] glove box
[5:00] and I said well for all I know brother
[5:03] brandom it must be it has every
[5:06] appearance of being and and and then he
[5:09] said I kind of think so
[5:12] myself and at that
[5:15] instant with the complete Union of what
[5:18] our agreement in agreement at that
[5:20] instant all I can tell you is that it
[5:23] was a
[5:24] person I believe the angel of the Lord
[5:28] just between us and slightly forward not
[5:33] right here but just slightly forward the
[5:37] presence of a
[5:39] person and I literally I froze I thought
[5:43] I was going to die I thought I was going
[5:45] to pass into some other place I didn't
[5:49] know anything about and I was just
[5:51] staring at the box and I was afraid to
[5:54] move and the presence was so
[6:00] holy the presence was
[6:03] so all
[6:05] consuming you just could not not that
[6:09] you wanted to escape it but it was
[6:13] just
[6:14] um just
[6:17] all complete complete presence gripping
[6:21] you and I just stared at the
[6:24] box and I I looked up I only knew one
[6:27] thing to do and that is to see how
[6:30] brother brandom is reacting to this and
[6:33] I just looked I cast my eyes kind of
[6:36] sideways to look at him we had about 4
[6:41] days beard on 3 4 days beard I would say
[6:46] we we we we had been out in the
[6:49] bush and his beard was sticking out
[6:52] prickling like very
[6:55] prickly and and his face was pale
[7:00] and I thought he looks like a person
[7:03] near death I'd only seen it once before
[7:06] in my
[7:08] life and I'd been with a very good
[7:10] friend of mine I just came to his house
[7:13] I just pulled in and he had been pinned
[7:16] between two heavy pieces of equipment
[7:18] with his
[7:19] temples and a Truck and a loader behind
[7:22] it and he was pinned between the two and
[7:25] he used all of his
[7:27] strength probably a super natural
[7:30] strength at that moment and just to
[7:32] press the push the two pieces of
[7:36] equipment apart and that
[7:37] freedom and when I happened to drive in
[7:42] they had him laid out on his
[7:44] sofa and I noticed that his beard from
[7:47] the shock to the system his beard had
[7:51] prickled out and he was just pale and
[7:54] that whole image just flashed to my mind
[7:58] in an instant when I looked at brother
[8:01] Brenham and that I just thought that and
[8:05] brother Brenham kind of rolled his head
[8:07] back looked over to
[8:09] me he said I guess he's come to me
[8:12] brother Eddie 10,000 times 10,000 and
[8:16] that's every time the same it's just
[8:18] like I could
[8:20] die and at that instant we were just
[8:23] driving a curve in the highway and there
[8:26] was a big bull moose standing right in
[8:29] the middle of the
[8:32] road and it it startled me oh I said I
[8:36] said brother brandham there's a
[8:38] moose and I hadn't gotten a moose and I
[8:41] needed a
[8:42] moose and he just kept driving he never
[8:45] slowed down we were we weren't not going
[8:48] fast he said it's all right brother
[8:51] Eddie just get your gun in your shells
[8:53] and kind of like he's yours sort of
[8:56] thing and he just kept driving
[9:00] he drove up so
[9:01] close that that and I shot that moose
[9:06] and uh we dressed the Moose out and
[9:09] brother bam sat here just on my left and
[9:12] he sat on the log and we just dressed
[9:15] the Moose out and when we were done we
[9:18] walked back to the
[9:20] car and I I stepped into the car and
[9:22] disclosed the door and I can't describe
[9:25] the atmosphere it was it was just
[9:30] so Serene and so
[9:33] marvelous the after effect of the whole
[9:36] thing and the presence of that
[9:40] person and brother Bram
[9:44] said every time he
[9:46] comes something good
[9:48] happens and I've used that phrase many
[9:51] times every time he comes whether it's
[9:54] in a church service or in a family's
[9:57] life or a home is's a distinct
[10:02] atmosphere of the person of the Lord
[10:05] Jesus Christ and every time he comes
[10:08] something good happens
[10:10] [Music]
[11:20] [Music]
[11:48] I was here in
[11:50] Vancouver attending a
[11:52] wedding and we heard I got a phone call
[11:55] that brother Bram had been in an
[11:58] accident and and was hanging between
[12:01] life and death and in the in amarella
[12:06] Texas and we I went I caught the plane
[12:10] first thing in the morning went home
[12:12] called brother Tom Brown asked him to
[12:14] keep me
[12:16] informed and my wife and I were sitting
[12:19] in our home on December the 24th
[12:22] Christmas
[12:24] Eve and then I just had an Awakening
[12:29] I said just think I said just think
[12:34] dear here the airwaves are filled with
[12:37] Joy to the World the Lord Has
[12:40] Come Joy to the World and It Came Upon a
[12:44] Midnight Clear I said and all the store
[12:47] windows are filled with the manger scene
[12:50] and people are singing carols and
[12:54] churches are having special meetings or
[12:57] whatever more at this
[12:59] season it's the same
[13:02] as they were singing the songs of the
[13:07] Psalms of Christ and his crucifixion
[13:10] when they were crucifying him and I
[13:14] [Music]
[13:15] said they have
[13:18] missed the John the Baptist and now I
[13:23] said here we've had a most phenomenal
[13:27] Ministry in brother
[13:29] brenham's
[13:31] Ministry if and we believe he's the
[13:34] Forerunner of Christ second
[13:37] coming if he's had that such a
[13:40] phenomenal
[13:41] Ministry and so Supernatural and you
[13:45] know
[13:47] so uh it was like reaching into another
[13:51] realm another world so many
[13:54] times I
[13:56] said if he lives beyond Christmas
[14:00] and just dies I said I will not
[14:03] understand that but I said just think
[14:06] I'm speaking to my wife just think if he
[14:09] should pass
[14:11] away right at this Christmas season I
[14:15] said what a remarkable thing that would
[14:18] be to a nation that is a drift from God
[14:23] and about two hours later I got a phone
[14:25] call that brother Bram has just passed
[14:28] away on Christmas
[14:32] [Music]
[14:46] Eve I thought the only thing that would
[14:50] be left to do is go across this country
[14:53] and scream out
[14:55] it's it's over it's too late it's it's
[14:59] over and uh so that was on my
[15:03] heart and I was expecting to go and now
[15:07] brother brandham was gone the
[15:09] messenger's
[15:10] gone we're not going to be going back to
[15:13] Jeffersonville to special meetings to
[15:16] hear him uh kind of the bottom had
[15:19] fallen out of
[15:20] everything and we had to find
[15:25] ourselves the hunger for God was not
[15:31] Abad and I I had felt now for some
[15:34] months I had felt that I should return
[15:38] West and uh I gave the company where I
[15:42] was working they were very good to me I
[15:45] gave them several months
[15:47] notice and then I left Toronto but I had
[15:51] no job no income no nothing and moved
[15:57] here to Cloverdale
[16:00] and after about 3 4 years I was
[16:03] supporting myself doing my best to
[16:06] support myself which we continued to do
[16:11] and then we built our our home a new
[16:14] home another home and made the old house
[16:19] which we had bought we turned it into
[16:22] Cloverdale bway house or Bible Way house
[16:26] and from it it grew to a log Church
[16:29] from the log Church to the church where
[16:32] we presently are today in the school in
[16:34] the
[16:35] camp um but I consider all the
[16:40] blessing of God upon the work has been
[16:44] solely off for one thing and that is
[16:46] because we always were putting forward
[16:50] the message the message to us is Christ
[16:53] we're putting forth Jesus Christ this is
[16:57] Jesus Christ
[16:59] and and this is what he's doing now
[17:02] today and he sent a word he sent a
[17:04] message for us and whether it was on the
[17:08] radio where we had radio for about 9
[17:11] years cleaning the tape so they could
[17:14] hear Brother bram's
[17:16] voice and H have the same effect that
[17:20] it's had on us and then we wanted to
[17:22] print the message
[17:24] books it
[17:26] was it was just a p passion with us we
[17:30] were absolutely obsessed with getting
[17:33] the message to other countries to get it
[17:37] in their language I felt that was the
[17:40] most honorable and the most privileged
[17:42] thing we could do and we have continue
[17:45] to this day
[17:56] [Music]
[18:01] they had a a luncheon and I think there
[18:05] was 122
[18:07] ministers to a international and they
[18:10] call it the first
[18:12] International it was all Philippine done
[18:15] by the Philippine people and done by the
[18:17] Philippine church I sat
[18:20] there one of the ministers who I
[18:23] understand is even a lawyer he said I've
[18:26] wanted to translate a certain certain
[18:28] mage message I can't find that message I
[18:31] happen to have a copy of that message in
[18:34] my Bible and so I just slipped it out
[18:37] and I said here's a copy right here you
[18:39] can have this one and he was so
[18:43] happy then I got I went to my hotel room
[18:47] while the dinner was still going on and
[18:50] I went to my hotel room and I I just sat
[18:53] there in front of my computer and I I
[18:56] started typing on a clean page
[19:00] um Minister's
[19:03] profile your name your
[19:06] address I just asked a whole lot of
[19:09] questions one of the main questions was
[19:12] how many tapes do you have of William
[19:16] brandham because all kinds of people
[19:19] were spreading their tapes and I want to
[19:22] know how many tapes they had of William
[19:24] brandham how many message books do you
[19:27] have of William brandham
[19:29] and
[19:31] uh how can we help you to serve the
[19:35] Bride of Jesus Christ
[19:37] better and they could write their little
[19:40] note there and then I asked them to sign
[19:44] their name and they could attach some
[19:47] pictures if they wished and if they wish
[19:49] to fill one out fine if they didn't that
[19:53] was fine and after that one single visit
[19:57] we came home and after about three weeks
[20:00] I asked sister Leo would you please make
[20:05] a
[20:07] summary of all the returns that we've
[20:10] had thus
[20:11] far and there was about
[20:15] 150 that had filled it out even though
[20:17] there was only about 122 there but about
[20:21] 150 had sent in uh these return these
[20:26] profiles ministers profiles
[20:29] and this was a shock that broke my
[20:32] heart of the
[20:34] 150
[20:36] 92 didn't have a single tape of William
[20:41] brandham
[20:43] 92 and I just shook my head how does
[20:48] this country have ministers from America
[20:53] going over year after year after year
[20:56] after year having meetings and
[20:59] conventions and preaching what in the
[21:01] world are they
[21:03] preaching these people don't have the
[21:05] message and that has always been my
[21:08] passion I just felt that my
[21:12] time my
[21:14] energies are have to be aligned
[21:18] to presenting Christ to these people and
[21:21] making him available to them
[21:24] [Music]
[21:38] I called the trustees from our
[21:41] church and this was the initial
[21:45] movement and I can't tell you I didn't
[21:48] have any particular Vision or dream but
[21:51] I just knew I could see it and uh we
[21:55] went out for a dinner at a restaurant in
[21:58] Fort Langley and I said I have a vision
[22:03] that I would like to present to you and
[22:06] I began to draw a a unit I said this is
[22:10] called a message
[22:12] kiosk and it's about 5T High about 18 24
[22:17] in wide and about 24 in deep has a
[22:21] screen here I could see kiosks and the
[22:24] people were using it in the industry and
[22:27] and and we have the the best product
[22:29] there is
[22:32] so uh shortly after that I was making a
[22:36] trip to Africa and I
[22:39] stopped in
[22:41] Amsterdam and I was in the hotel late at
[22:44] night around
[22:45] midnight and asking for a room and the
[22:49] girl was at the desk just one girl and
[22:51] she was making out my forms and I looked
[22:56] and here was exactly the same color
[22:59] here was a like a
[23:02] aluminum uh unit about 5T tall sitting
[23:06] there with a big sign on it says print
[23:10] 22 pages of your favorite
[23:12] newspaper and I said to the girl I said
[23:15] what is that she said that's a that's a
[23:19] newspaper
[23:21] kiosk I walked over to it and there was
[23:24] a screen and I just touched it and up
[23:28] came the map of the
[23:30] world I thought that's how incredible
[23:33] this is exactly what I've drawn and is
[23:37] what I see in fact is we had a whole
[23:40] aspect that this didn't have so they
[23:42] would print out part of newspaper what I
[23:46] envisioned
[23:48] was the flags of Nations coming up
[23:52] because it has to be
[23:53] International people who don't speak or
[23:57] read English they maybe speak just their
[24:00] own language tribal language but they
[24:04] one thing they would know is their
[24:06] flag uh this flag so they touch the flag
[24:11] and it brings up the
[24:14] languages that the message is available
[24:17] in and they could and then it would be
[24:19] in their language and they could
[24:21] understand that and down here is a
[24:24] finger coming to a button to print and
[24:27] they touch that touch the button and
[24:30] there's a little printer in there and
[24:32] out comes a fully printed message book
[24:35] in that
[24:37] language the internal workings of the
[24:43] unit really is the translation and the
[24:47] storage of it in a computer system and
[24:51] they could have any kind of printer and
[24:53] they would have different printers and
[24:55] we realized that they would have to get
[24:57] their own and not only that a lot of the
[25:01] ministers today because computers are
[25:04] cheaper and they have their own laptop
[25:07] or whatever more
[25:10] and so we could just provide them with a
[25:14] or put it on the internet The Hub and
[25:17] that's what that's where the Hub came
[25:18] from the Hub is the internal workings of
[25:22] the chaos and the Beautiful part of it
[25:25] it doesn't it doesn't come from Bible
[25:27] believers
[25:29] it's not connected to our church it just
[25:32] belongs to the bride it's anybody's and
[25:34] everybody's God has allowed us to go
[25:37] into China to go into Africa to go into
[25:42] places like the Congo and there's been a
[25:44] huge work in the Congo but it's not over
[25:48] the people still need to have access to
[25:52] the message to be able to search the
[25:55] message uh there's people in Mala and
[25:58] Zimbabwe and Nigeria and Uganda so we
[26:03] just keep surging ahead and translating
[26:07] the King James version of the Bible I
[26:10] just couldn't sit here hold my Bible in
[26:12] my hand and know that the Chinese people
[26:16] 1 billion
[26:19] 300 million people maybe closer to 400
[26:24] million that don't have an accurate
[26:29] King James version of the Bible and it
[26:31] took about 18 years for this Bible to be
[26:36] I'm enthused about it I'm very very
[26:38] enthused about it and I just think
[26:41] nothing can stand in the way no matter
[26:44] whether it's governments or who it is
[26:46] and to be able to put the message to put
[26:49] that prophet's voice up into the
[26:52] heavens for me and my belief is it's a
[26:57] great voice from
[26:59] Heaven as the Bible speaks of and is
[27:03] there
[27:04] permanently and they can have all the
[27:06] rubbish up there but we have a
[27:08] Vindicated voice up there and if I were
[27:11] a young man today I would want to do as
[27:16] you Brothers do know everything I could
[27:20] know about that technical world so I
[27:24] could utilize it for the gospel for the
[27:29] industry but
[27:31] yet looking back in
[27:34] retrospect I can see where God allowed
[27:37] me to become in
[27:39] contact with the printing press for
[27:42] commercial per purposes and and the
[27:46] world and business and all the rest of
[27:48] it and on down the road a few years what
[27:52] is that to God that's nothing it's just
[27:54] a breath I I needed to know about paper
[27:58] and about ink and about printing presses
[28:01] and so on the first time I went to India
[28:04] I had to buy a printing
[28:07] press and it was a platin hand handheld
[28:11] press I knew all about platin presses
[28:13] and I knew all about the different
[28:15] manufacturers of it and so on so forth
[28:18] that's when I could just turn around
[28:19] quickly and say that's what that was
[28:21] about that's why I had that work and
[28:25] whatever whatever field you're in
[28:29] if your life is given over to God you'll
[28:33] you'll find that what you learned in
[28:35] life will be useful in the kingdom of
[28:40] God thy kingdom come and thy will be
[28:44] done so I believe that uh I in fact is I
[28:49] can say
[28:50] authoritatively that what and how God
[28:54] has led a life even from Youth and up
[28:58] through the teen years into married life
[29:01] and so on so
[29:03] forth how God has led that's how God
[29:07] wants to use a person and he will use
[29:13] them so I I'm very very pleased and very
[29:17] happy to be able to say that and I'm
[29:20] very happy when I see young ladies young
[29:24] men want to give their lives to God let
[29:28] their lives be a testimony and I think
[29:31] of the words brother bradam said a true
[29:36] witness of the True
[29:39] Vine and that has always been a slogan
[29:42] with me a true witness I want to be a
[29:45] true witness of the True Vine
[29:50] [Music]
[30:52] [Applause]
[30:53] [Music]
[31:25] that I wanted to convey
[31:28] in this episode
[31:31] is the feeling that I had the feeling of
[31:37] disappointment the feeling of
[31:39] disillusionment that I had with what I
[31:42] was seeing amongst the what I would
[31:45] consider a first class people of
[31:50] Believers uh we believed a Full Gospel
[31:55] and I have here uh a couple of the
[31:59] magazines this is uh a March
[32:04] 1958 this is I simply are bringing this
[32:06] up to let the people see what was taking
[32:11] place and uh this is a a picture of the
[32:17] evangelists uh just a very very few of
[32:20] them and then as we open it up there is
[32:23] a article by one of the evangelists
[32:28] and then as we open up the next page and
[32:31] I'm BR bringing this so that you
[32:34] can uh
[32:36] see what was taking place during that
[32:39] time there were large enormous meetings
[32:43] taking place
[32:45] everywhere and uh just dozens of
[32:48] evangelists and healing meetings taking
[32:51] place this first meeting is uh one of
[32:55] brother bram's meetings it's reporting
[32:57] on written by Gordon Lindsay and you can
[33:00] see the crowd here is there's just tens
[33:04] of thousands of people and
[33:08] then uh I think the first article was
[33:12] more
[33:13] cell and then this article has to be
[33:16] winning the nation's
[33:18] Crusade one of these men here is Lou
[33:22] Petrus who brother brandham refers to
[33:26] and then uh on this page here is all
[33:32] different evangelist brother Brenham is
[33:34] there in the corner uh Tommy Hicks is
[33:37] here I believe one of these men is Jack
[33:40] Cole I'm not certain and uh so we can
[33:44] see there's uh 4 8
[33:48] 12
[33:50] 16 uh 20 24 men on the on this page
[33:54] alone these are all very notable event
[33:57] list and healing meetings everywhere
[34:01] this is RW col
[34:04] pepper I was never in one of his
[34:06] meetings but he was very very well known
[34:10] and had tens of thousands if not
[34:13] hundreds of thousands of people in
[34:15] Bombay India and that's the crowd in
[34:17] Bombay
[34:19] India uh that was
[34:21] 1958 and then in this
[34:24] 1958 magazine here once again we open it
[34:29] up and across the top is just uh number
[34:35] of
[34:36] evangelists and uh tent meetings all of
[34:40] them had tent meetings with maybe 25
[34:43] 30,000 people it was an
[34:48] atmosphere that caused a young man like
[34:51] myself a young
[34:53] Minister I thought that you know they're
[34:56] going to win Nations for Christ this is
[34:59] what they're doing and there was such a
[35:02] move of God brother bandam calls it a
[35:04] Revival of the restoration of the gifts
[35:07] and it was remarkable
[35:09] manifestation and something that I want
[35:11] to have you understand is that while
[35:15] this while these magazines which are
[35:19] this is worldwide
[35:22] Revival I don't even know who put this
[35:24] one out this one was put out uh I think
[35:27] think by Gordon Lindsay there was voice
[35:30] of healing that was taking place but
[35:33] then a lot of these people had their own
[35:37] magazines or Roberts Tommy Hicks Tommy
[35:41] osbor they all had their own EV
[35:45] Evangelistic uh uh meetings and showing
[35:49] the large crowds and the tents and the
[35:52] Revival this was taking place all over
[35:55] from one state to the next uh from
[35:57] Indianapolis to Minnesota to to Texas
[36:02] and all over the states and shareport
[36:04] and so on
[36:07] and incredible meetings and
[36:11] overseas and Tommy osbor was overseas
[36:15] and in Holland and made movies of it
[36:19] which I I saw their
[36:21] film I saw Tommy hex's film of Argentina
[36:25] and I understand that uh the president
[36:28] of Argentina gave him the keys to the
[36:31] city so with this kind of move of God I
[36:35] also saw it begin
[36:38] to diminish and this was
[36:41] 1958
[36:43] 1958
[36:45] 1958 then we come to
[36:49] 1961 and
[36:52] 1965 if we get into 1965
[36:56] [Music]
[36:58] just leafing through the magazine this
[37:01] is Bishop Stanley who gave brother
[37:04] brandham the Bible in birth pains I
[37:07] believe it
[37:09] is and then I would like to
[37:13] say and I would like to make this point
[37:17] emphatically it is these
[37:21] people that said certain things about
[37:24] the ministry of William brandham
[37:28] and when you get to the end of these
[37:33] meetings this magazine here for
[37:36] example which is uh
[37:40] 1978 you see nothing of these meetings
[37:44] this is Ern Baxter an article by ER
[37:46] Baxter who is Brother bram's first
[37:49] manager in his article he does say that
[37:53] of all of the times of discernment when
[37:57] the prophet of God was speaking to the
[38:00] people and Discerning their sicknesses
[38:03] and diseases and why they were there he
[38:07] said there was never once there was an
[38:10] error that's what they said he said
[38:14] there's never once that's been an arror
[38:16] and I
[38:17] also I would like to share this
[38:21] magazine this is a Full Gospel men's
[38:25] voice very po popular this is put on by
[38:29] the businessmen the elite I would say of
[38:35] America and this is what they
[38:37] said and I wish to read
[38:41] it in Bible
[38:43] days there were men of God who were
[38:46] prophets and
[38:48] seers but in all the sacred records none
[38:53] of these had a greater Ministry than
[38:56] that of William Brown
[38:58] a prophet and Seer of God whose
[39:02] photograph appears on the front cover of
[39:05] this issue of Full Gospel men's voice
[39:09] brandom was
[39:11] used brandom has been used by God In The
[39:16] Name of Jesus to raise the dead and this
[39:20] article is beyond the curtain of time
[39:23] and that's why brother Brenham sent the
[39:25] article sent the magazine to me me and
[39:28] perhaps knew that we were going to once
[39:31] again Face the
[39:34] People it's not us who said that that's
[39:38] what they said back here that's what all
[39:41] of these great evangelists and
[39:45] ministers and furthermore I have also
[39:49] another volume here which
[39:52] is uh been written and authored by
[39:55] Professor David Edward Harold professor
[39:59] at the University of of Birmingham
[40:03] Alabama and he said in his book Upon A
[40:09] Revival of 1947 to 58 he said this most
[40:14] of the
[40:15] participants of the Revival looked upon
[40:19] brandom as its
[40:21] initiator out of his massive Union
[40:24] meetings in 1947
[40:28] spread reports of hundreds of Miracles
[40:31] and
[40:32] marbles brandom seemed an unlikely
[40:36] leader he was introduced to the
[40:40] Pentecostal uh World by the despised
[40:43] Oneness
[40:46] Pentecostals but his preaching was
[40:48] halting and simple beyond
[40:51] belief but William brandham became a
[40:54] prophet to a generation
[40:58] this is Professor David Edwin Harold we
[41:01] did not write this book this is what
[41:06] they
[41:07] said this is what the Full Gospel men's
[41:11] said this is what these magazines have
[41:15] said that he was the initiator and I can
[41:20] say as one who has traveled the world
[41:24] there is an ongoing Supernatural
[41:26] Ministry in Russia in Africa in China in
[41:31] Europe and all over North America of
[41:34] people who caught the voice and heard
[41:38] the
[41:39] voice of of this prophet he was they
[41:42] missed it they thought he was just there
[41:44] to heal the sick that wasn't it a
[41:48] prophet is sent always to call the
[41:51] people back to the word of God and that
[41:54] was his call his Commission
[41:57] his message should forerun the second
[42:01] coming of Jesus Christ and it has done
[42:03] so and there are churches everywhere and
[42:06] I'm here to declare
[42:09] [Music]
[42:26] that for
