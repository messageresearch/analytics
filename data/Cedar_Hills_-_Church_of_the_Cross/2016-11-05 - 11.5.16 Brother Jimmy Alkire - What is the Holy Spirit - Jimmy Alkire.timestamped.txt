[0:00] today we're starting this series of
[0:01] messages entitled what is the Holy
[0:06] Spirit and As We Lay a foundation for
[0:08] this message let us remember one very
[0:10] important thing that without the correct
[0:15] preparation to receive the Holy Spirit
[0:18] there is no way to retain the spirit
[0:20] within you the Holy Spirit can and will
[0:24] come as we seek after him but the
[0:28] question is when he comes
[0:30] will you be a place or will there be a
[0:33] place in you where he can
[0:36] dwell there is so much being taught
[0:39] today among Christian religions as to
[0:42] what the Holy Ghost is how do you
[0:45] receive the Holy Ghost how do you know
[0:48] that you have the Holy
[0:50] Ghost what will it do in your life once
[0:53] you receive
[0:55] it what is the evidence of the Holy
[0:58] Ghost is it speaking with tongues or a
[1:02] certain gift or is it the fruits of the
[1:06] spirit as we find in Galatians 5: 22 and
[1:11] 23 but the fruit of the spirit is love
[1:15] joy peace longsuffering gentleness
[1:18] goodness Faith meekness meekness
[1:23] Temperance against such there is no
[1:26] law when we talk about fruit we talk
[1:29] about a
[1:31] tree and in the Bible there are many
[1:34] places that types man as a
[1:37] tree as we find in Matthew
[1:39] 7:
[1:41] 13-2 enter ye in at the Straight Gate
[1:45] for wide is the gate and Broad is the
[1:47] way that leadth to destruction and many
[1:50] there be which go in there at because
[1:53] straight is the gate and narrow is the
[1:55] way which leadth unto life and few there
[1:58] be that find it
[2:00] beware of false prophets which come to
[2:03] you in sheep's clothing but inly they
[2:07] are ravenous wolves you shall know them
[2:10] by their fruits do man gather Grapes of
[2:14] thorns or figs of thistles even so every
[2:18] good tree bringeth forth good fruit but
[2:22] a corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit a
[2:26] good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit
[2:29] neither can a corrupt tree bring forth
[2:32] good fruit every tree that bringeth
[2:34] forth not good fruit is heun down and
[2:38] cast Into the Fire wherefore by their
[2:41] fruits ye shall know
[2:44] them so by the fruits you will know them
[2:48] in Christianity Today you have those
[2:50] that teach that the evidence of the Holy
[2:53] Ghost is the fruits of the spirit
[2:57] another group says that the evidence of
[2:59] the Holy holy spirit is speaking in an
[3:02] unknown tongue or some
[3:04] gift I am saying these things for our
[3:08] children that are growing up and for the
[3:10] new people that are coming to the Lord
[3:14] but we know that the gifts and the
[3:16] fruits of the spirit can be imitated or
[3:21] perverted so what does the spirit
[3:24] Quicken to bring the genuine gifts and
[3:28] fruits the word of God then the evidence
[3:32] of the holy spirit is when you can
[3:34] punctuate every word with an amen which
[3:38] means so be
[3:40] it also our messenger told us when you
[3:43] can see your life lining up with God's
[3:47] word that's another evidence and when
[3:51] you can see your life lining up with
[3:53] God's word then the fruits and Gifts in
[3:56] your life will prove what kind of tree
[3:59] you you are let's break this down a
[4:02] little
[4:04] more we've talked about fruit and
[4:09] trees how will you know that the that
[4:12] tree by the fruit it
[4:15] produces now let's talk about the birth
[4:18] of that
[4:19] tree before before there is
[4:23] fruit you have to have a
[4:26] tree to have a tree there has to be a
[4:29] birth of that
[4:31] tree and before there can be a birth
[4:34] there has to be a seed planted and
[4:37] watered in ordered for that tree to grow
[4:41] and bear
[4:42] fruit right here is where the religions
[4:45] of the world today are so confused they
[4:48] don't have a clear understanding of how
[4:50] to prepare themselves to receive not
[4:54] just the baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[4:58] the infilling or in dwelling of the Holy
[5:01] Ghost the seed of their teaching has
[5:04] been perverted by modernism I want to
[5:07] say that
[5:09] again the seed of their teaching has
[5:11] been perverted by
[5:13] modernism they truly do not understand
[5:16] the true New
[5:18] Birth and without the true New Birth you
[5:22] have nothing to receive the Holy Ghost
[5:25] with First Peter
[5:28] 1
[5:30] starting with Verse
[5:33] 18 for so much as you know that ye are
[5:36] not redeemed with corruptible things as
[5:38] silver and
[5:40] gold from your vain conversations
[5:43] received by tradition from your
[5:45] fathers but with the precious blood of
[5:47] Christ as a lamb without blemish and
[5:50] without spot you see first of all
[5:53] without understanding the Redemptive
[5:55] work of the blood of
[5:57] Christ and where the the Holy Spirit
[6:00] proceeded forth
[6:02] from then you do not understand why you
[6:06] need to receive the Holy Spirit let's
[6:09] explain this a little bit Jesus was the
[6:12] word of God made flesh right and the
[6:18] father came and indwell
[6:20] him and as we understand the scriptures
[6:23] the father and the Holy Spirit is the
[6:27] same person so when Jesus bled and died
[6:32] on
[6:32] Calvary when that blood cell was let
[6:35] loose from his body it released the holy
[6:39] spirit that was within him his body was
[6:44] taken back up to heaven and his Spirit
[6:48] the spirit that dwelt in Jesus was sent
[6:51] back to Earth later on in this teaching
[6:54] we'll go to the scriptures that relates
[6:57] this very thing so we know here then
[7:00] that it's with the precious blood of
[7:03] Christ no longer just the chemistry of
[7:06] his blood because as a human being he
[7:09] only had so much blood in his body just
[7:12] like you and me and that literal blood
[7:15] it spilled out upon the ground and dried
[7:18] up but the spirit that proceeded forth
[7:22] or came from that blood is what we
[7:25] received today that is the Holy Spirit
[7:29] let's go to verse
[7:31] 20 who verely was for ordained before
[7:34] the foundation of the
[7:35] world but was manifest in these last
[7:38] times for
[7:40] you I want you to notice how the
[7:42] scripture says it it was manifest in
[7:45] these last times for you you know the
[7:50] word you can be a very general thing and
[7:52] mean a group of people but what we are
[7:54] after today is for you as an individual
[7:58] to put your name there
[8:00] there that it it was foreordained this
[8:03] lamb was before the foundation of the
[8:04] world but it was manifest in these last
[8:07] times for you you've got to understand
[8:10] that this is a promise to you otherwise
[8:13] why would you want to receive it verse
[8:17] 21 who by him do we believe in God that
[8:21] raised him from the dead and give him
[8:23] glory that your Faith and Hope might be
[8:26] in God seeing that you have purified
[8:29] ified your souls in obeying the truth
[8:33] through the spirit unto unfe love of the
[8:36] Brethren seeing that ye love one another
[8:40] with a pure heart
[8:42] fervently being born
[8:46] again not of corruptible seed but of
[8:49] Incorruptible by the word of God which
[8:52] liveth and abideth
[8:54] forever for All Flesh is as grass and
[8:58] all the glory of man as the flower of
[9:01] grass the grass withth and the flower
[9:04] thereof fth
[9:06] away but the word of the Lord endureth
[9:10] forever and this is the word I want you
[9:14] to notice how the Holy Spirit through
[9:17] Peter here is putting this all in
[9:20] present tense it says but the word of
[9:23] the Lord endureth forever and this is
[9:26] not was not will be this is the word
[9:31] which by the gospel is preached unto
[9:36] you very tremendous
[9:39] scripture notice the word here in verse
[9:43] 21 it says being born
[9:47] again that word being is a word that has
[9:51] a
[9:52] beginning but it's a it continues it's
[9:55] not well he was born or will be born but
[9:59] being born again it has a beginning but
[10:03] it's not all done at once it continues
[10:07] until you are fully born but
[10:10] brother
[10:13] now how by a corruptible seed how does
[10:17] the seed become
[10:19] corruptible and when is the seed
[10:23] Incorruptible it's by the word of God
[10:25] that it we can retain this purity
[10:29] of not being
[10:30] corrupt it's by the word of God which
[10:33] liveth and abideth forever so being that
[10:36] the word is that seed what can corrupt
[10:39] that
[10:41] seed let's go to verse that verse 25
[10:44] again in that same
[10:46] chapter but the word of the Lord
[10:48] endureth forever
[10:51] notice The Incorruptible
[10:54] seed that's the only thing that will
[10:56] endure forever because as you know know
[10:59] when you mix a seed and natural life of
[11:02] a plant and you hybrid
[11:04] it it can no longer produce the Original
[11:08] Seed it has a time span set to it to
[11:12] where it can produce the seed that it is
[11:16] but the word of the Lord when it's
[11:17] maintained in its
[11:20] Purity it will endure
[11:25] forever notice The Incorruptible seed
[11:28] and this is presently the
[11:31] word by the gospel which is preached to
[11:34] you you see the first and original
[11:38] Ministry of preaching the word by the
[11:41] gospel was before anyone else could put
[11:45] their own ideas to
[11:47] it you know in Ephesians 2: 19 and 20 it
[11:52] says that we are built on that
[11:54] foundation of the Apostles and
[11:57] Prophets watch where the seed begins to
[12:01] corrupt or to be perverted into another
[12:05] seed and that seed will bring a false
[12:09] birth now let's turn to Second
[12:14] Peter chapter
[12:19] 1 you may wonder what does this have to
[12:22] do with the Holy
[12:25] Spirit and the preparation of the Holy
[12:27] Spirit we don't want a birth of a
[12:31] religion we we don't want just another
[12:34] church Gore we want the original
[12:37] Believers just like they were in the
[12:39] book of Acts when God first spoke his
[12:43] word through his Apostles and
[12:45] Prophets and brought that original
[12:48] baptism of the Holy
[12:49] Spirit that's what we want
[12:52] today not just a little portion not just
[12:56] an ism not just a gift not just fruit we
[13:00] want the fullness of God's word which
[13:02] was the seed that could produce the true
[13:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost so until you
[13:09] can get to this point in your life
[13:13] there's no way for you to really take
[13:15] advantage of receiving the Holy Spirit
[13:19] what good would it do you to know what
[13:21] the holy spirit
[13:22] is if you don't know the results it's
[13:26] going to bring in your life you would
[13:28] have no idea of what you had received
[13:32] when you received it and if you didn't
[13:35] know what you had received how would you
[13:38] be able to use what you have received or
[13:41] how could God use you by the Holy Spirit
[13:46] to for a specific purpose so it's very
[13:50] very important to understand what the
[13:53] holy spirit is and to understand the
[13:57] preparation now preparation what is it
[14:00] it's an experience where you come to the
[14:03] Lord Jesus Christ as a sinner condemned
[14:07] to hell all of us were condemned by our
[14:10] own actions by our own unbelief because
[14:13] true sin it's not smoking and drinking
[14:16] and carousing around and partying no
[14:21] true sin it sounds horrible to say it
[14:23] that way true sin is unbelief right
[14:27] there reason people do those things is
[14:30] because they do not believe and why do
[14:32] they do those things it's because the
[14:34] seed of their spiritual life is
[14:39] corrupt so we must understand today in
[14:42] this world of religion that we live many
[14:46] many many different churches thousands
[14:48] probably of different denominations each
[14:51] teaching something different or each
[14:53] teaching just a a portion of God's word
[14:57] and relating that the holy spirit is
[15:00] received just by accepting the Lord in
[15:02] your heart and when you accept the Lord
[15:04] in your heart then you receive the Holy
[15:08] Spirit Well in principle that might be
[15:12] fine but it's so sad to say that it's
[15:16] not that's not the way it is but now
[15:19] let's see where the seed begins to be
[15:22] perverted let's go to First Peter as or
[15:25] second Peter as I
[15:27] said chapter CH 1 and we're going to
[15:30] start let's go
[15:32] back to verse
[15:35] 16 for we have not followed cly devised
[15:39] fables when we made known unto you the
[15:43] power and the coming of our Lord Jesus
[15:47] Christ but were eyewitnesses of his
[15:51] majesty for he Bes received from God the
[15:53] Father honor and
[15:55] Glory when there came such a voice to
[15:58] him from the excellent Glory this is my
[16:02] beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
[16:08] and this voice which came from heaven we
[16:11] heard when we were with him in the Holy
[16:16] Mount can you imagine such a thing to be
[16:19] an
[16:20] eyewitness these first and founding
[16:24] Apostles at this point when they went up
[16:27] on the mount they were just called
[16:28] Disciples which is a follower but after
[16:31] they received the Holy Spirit and were
[16:33] sent of God they became the apostles for
[16:37] the word Apostle one of the meanings is
[16:40] a sent
[16:42] one and you imagine hearing that voice
[16:45] speak in the on the
[16:47] mountain but watch this
[16:50] now from that it changes and it says in
[16:53] verse 19 we also are more we also Al
[16:58] have a more sure word of Prophecy where
[17:02] unto ye do well to take heed as unto a
[17:06] light that shineth in a dark place until
[17:09] the day Dawn and the day star arise in
[17:13] your
[17:14] hearts knowing this
[17:17] first I want to stop
[17:20] there knowing this
[17:22] first first things must be put first how
[17:28] many when you went to school the first
[17:30] thing they taught you was how to count
[17:32] from 1 to
[17:34] 10 and how they taught you your
[17:36] ABCs it I want to make it so simple that
[17:40] even a child could understand it but we
[17:43] must take first things first and here's
[17:47] God telling us about this of the word
[17:52] and how it came and he goes
[17:54] first that's the thing that's first no
[17:58] knowing this first verse 20 that the no
[18:01] Prophecy of the scripture is of any
[18:04] private
[18:06] interpretation for the prophecy came not
[18:09] in Old Time by the will of man but by
[18:14] holy men of God spake as they were moved
[18:19] by the Holy
[18:22] Ghost you see where the seed has been
[18:26] corrupted that's why we have so many
[18:28] different searches today and the people
[18:30] don't know what to
[18:33] do now in verse 21 it gives us the key
[18:36] to know and receive The Incorruptible
[18:39] seed for the prophecy came not in Old
[18:43] Time by the will of man but by holy men
[18:48] of God spake as they were moved by the
[18:52] Holy Ghost did you catch that it didn't
[18:55] come by the will of man in the past
[18:59] trying to interpret the word but each of
[19:02] these holy men in his
[19:05] time or age spake which at that time it
[19:11] was present it wasn't a thing from the
[19:14] past it wasn't a thing that was going to
[19:17] be in the
[19:18] future but it was in the present time
[19:22] they spake present tense as they were
[19:25] moved by the Holy Ghost
[19:28] so today after man has corrupted the
[19:32] seed what would it take to restore the
[19:35] Original Seed back to the way it was
[19:39] when it was spoke the first
[19:43] time for truly God's spoken word is the
[19:47] Original Seed it would require a holy
[19:51] man not holy in himself but the Holy
[19:56] Spirit moving in him to speak the pure
[20:00] Incorruptible seed word of
[20:02] God these men were and are God's
[20:08] prophets that's why we have a Bible
[20:11] today that's why we believe that God
[20:13] sent a prophet to our day to restore the
[20:17] Original Seed word by bringing the
[20:20] correct
[20:21] interpretation of the scriptures from
[20:23] Genesis to
[20:25] Revelation taking the totality of God's
[20:29] word in its continuity to finish the
[20:33] mystery of God in this last age so we
[20:36] can go in the catching away or what we
[20:39] call the
[20:41] Rapture now as we approach the first
[20:45] scripture that the prophet used to open
[20:48] his message on what is the Holy Ghost
[20:51] let's review what we've talked about and
[20:54] apply another scripture actually several
[20:57] other the scriptures so we can approach
[21:01] this most important subject of what is
[21:04] the Holy
[21:05] Ghost we talked about how many churches
[21:09] teach that the evidence of having the
[21:12] Holy Ghost is the fruit of the spirit or
[21:14] gifts such as unknown
[21:17] tongues but we found out that the
[21:19] evidence of having the Holy Ghost is
[21:22] when we can punctuate with every word of
[21:25] God with an amen when we can see our
[21:28] life line up with the word of God in its
[21:30] fullness we talked of man as a tree that
[21:34] brings forth fruit but then we saw that
[21:38] the tree had to be born first and grow
[21:42] and then produce
[21:43] fruit we also saw that we have to be
[21:46] born again of The Incorruptible
[21:49] seed the word so the true New Birth is
[21:54] what prepares us to receive the Holy
[21:57] Ghost
[21:59] that's what I want you to
[22:02] get if that preparation isn't correct
[22:06] there is no use of finding out what the
[22:09] holy spirit
[22:10] is it will only dwell in those that are
[22:14] prepared now let's go to a scripture
[22:18] that can relate to each one of us
[22:20] remember we are speaking to a wide
[22:22] spectrum of people from many different
[22:25] backgrounds let's go to ISA Isaiah chap
[22:29] 42 and let's start with verse
[22:33] 5 thus sayith God the Lord he that
[22:37] created the heavens and stretched them
[22:40] out he that spread forth the Earth and
[22:44] that which cometh out of it he that
[22:46] giveth breath unto the people upon it
[22:49] and spirit to them that walk therein I
[22:53] the Lord have called thee in
[22:55] righteousness and I will hold thy hand
[22:58] and will keep thee and give thee for a
[23:01] covenant of the people for a light of
[23:05] the Gentiles here this prophecy is
[23:08] speaking actually of the Messiah
[23:11] himself that he would
[23:13] be a a a light to the Gentiles which by
[23:18] the way most of us that we're talking to
[23:22] on this tape we're all Gentiles
[23:25] right watch the purpose of why this life
[23:28] would come to the Gentiles verse 7 to
[23:31] open the blind eyes to bring out the
[23:34] prisoners from the prison and them that
[23:37] sit in darkness out of the prison
[23:41] house so how many of us we're at one
[23:44] point in our lives no matter what Walk
[23:47] of Life we come from We're
[23:51] blind you might say well brother Jimmy I
[23:54] see very well you must understand that
[23:57] I'm talking not about a natural
[23:59] blindness I'm talking about a spiritual
[24:03] condition that we were
[24:05] blind we we we were
[24:09] totally blind if I could say it that way
[24:11] we we did not understand one thing about
[24:14] what God was we did not understand one
[24:18] thing about what God wanted to do in our
[24:21] lives what the purpose of God would be
[24:23] in our life and we were in a prison we
[24:26] were enslaved within our own selves our
[24:28] own desires our own sin our own way of
[24:33] life our own way of
[24:35] thinking but he was going to come to
[24:38] open the blind eyes and to bring the
[24:41] prisoners out of prison and them that
[24:43] sit in darkness out of the prison house
[24:45] verse 8 I am the Lord that is my name my
[24:49] glory will I not give to another neither
[24:52] my praise to graven images behold the
[24:55] former things are come to pass and new
[24:57] things do I declare before they spring
[25:00] forth I tell you
[25:02] them amen so can you relate that to that
[25:06] today that you were once blind as the
[25:09] song says I was once blind but now I see
[25:12] now let's go to verse
[25:14] 16 I will bring the Blind by a way that
[25:18] they knew
[25:21] not I will lead them in pass that they
[25:24] have not
[25:25] known I will make Darkness light before
[25:29] them and crooked things straight these
[25:32] things will I do unto them and not
[25:34] forsake them aren't you happy for that
[25:38] so what is this scripture why would I
[25:41] bring this scripture in relation to what
[25:42] is the holy spirit is that really until
[25:46] God reveals to you what the holy spirit
[25:49] is what it was given for what it will do
[25:52] in your
[25:54] life you're in this condition you don't
[25:58] know the way of God I don't know the way
[26:02] of God so he has to take us notice how
[26:06] the scripture says I will bring the
[26:09] Blind by a way they knew
[26:12] not that shows that God from the very
[26:16] time that we were born on this Earth has
[26:19] been dealing with
[26:21] us even though we didn't know what he
[26:24] was
[26:25] doing he's been bringing us all
[26:28] along that's why many of you today that
[26:31] will be listening or in the future
[26:32] listening to this podcast on this series
[26:36] God has brought you to the point you may
[26:39] not have even understood or understand
[26:41] today why but you've come to the point
[26:44] where now God can bring you by a way
[26:50] that when you begin you really did not
[26:53] know how it was
[26:56] happening I will lead them in paths that
[26:59] they have not
[27:01] known I will make Darkness light before
[27:04] them what a
[27:06] promise and crooked things straight
[27:08] these things will I do unto them and not
[27:11] forsake
[27:12] them they shall be turned back verse
[27:16] 17 they shall be greatly ashamed that
[27:20] trust engraven
[27:22] images that say to the molten images ye
[27:26] are our gods
[27:28] hear ye
[27:30] deaf look ye
[27:33] blind that ye may
[27:35] see who is
[27:37] blind but my
[27:40] servant or deaf as my messenger that I I
[27:45] sent who is blind as he that is perfect
[27:50] and blind as the Lord's
[27:52] servant that is so hard for the
[27:55] intellectual mind to
[27:58] understand how what God is talking about
[28:01] you
[28:02] notice we miss we now we came to him
[28:05] blind
[28:07] right but now he's speaking to the de
[28:10] and saying
[28:12] here he's speaking to the Blind and he's
[28:14] saying
[28:16] see that's you and me no matter where we
[28:19] come from what race we are what part of
[28:21] the world we live in that's you and me
[28:24] but notice how he changes here it seems
[28:26] like even though he's using the same
[28:28] word he asked the question who is blind
[28:32] but my
[28:37] servant and then the question would be
[28:40] blind to
[28:44] what blind to
[28:47] anything that would lead him away from
[28:50] the Lord blind to
[28:53] anything that is contrary to God's word
[28:57] plan and
[29:01] purpose that's the kind of servant that
[29:03] God
[29:04] needs somebody that won't follow their
[29:06] own understanding are what the modern
[29:09] ideas of this world are
[29:14] today are are deaf as my messenger that
[29:18] I
[29:19] sent how could he be a messenger if he
[29:21] was if this was talking about natural
[29:24] deafness he would not be able to hear
[29:26] the voice of God
[29:28] but what it is saying is he would be
[29:30] deaf to anything that isn't the voice of
[29:37] God and that's the way you and I must
[29:41] become watch
[29:44] this who is
[29:47] blind as he that is
[29:50] perfect and blind as the Lord's
[29:56] servant is isn't that so
[29:59] tremendous who is blind but he that is
[30:02] perfect why because he's not being led
[30:05] by anything except the perfect almighty
[30:11] God aren't you all happy for that
[30:14] today amen
[30:18] so let's go now to chapter 43 are you
[30:21] being able to relate to this see this is
[30:24] part of our
[30:26] preparation why would you want the holy
[30:30] spirit in your life if you're not going
[30:33] to follow
[30:34] it if you would follow your own ideas if
[30:37] you would listen to all the different
[30:39] voices of the
[30:41] world if you wouldn't learn to get to
[30:43] the point where you were deaf to
[30:45] anything that wasn't God's
[30:48] voice why would God even give you the
[30:50] Holy
[30:51] Spirit God is very wise we all know that
[30:56] he is the fountain of all
[30:59] wisdom he's only going to give the Holy
[31:01] Spirit to them that ask for it but them
[31:03] that ask for it are those that truly
[31:05] desire to walk with him let's go here to
[31:10] chapter 43 as we finish this little part
[31:13] here on the the preparation or the
[31:16] introduction to this
[31:19] message chapter 43 of Isaiah verse 5
[31:23] fear not for I am with thee
[31:27] I will bring thy seed from the
[31:30] East and gather thee from the
[31:33] West I will say to the north give up and
[31:37] to the South keep not back bring my sons
[31:41] from afar and my daughters from the ends
[31:44] of the
[31:45] Earth even everyone that is called by my
[31:49] name oh my goodness we're going to get
[31:52] to something good on that here in a
[31:54] minute even those that are called by by
[31:57] my name for I have created him for my
[32:01] glory and have formed him yay I have
[32:05] made him here we go again bring forth
[32:10] the blind people that have
[32:14] eyes and the deaf that have
[32:19] ears verse n let all the nations be
[32:23] gathered together and let the people be
[32:27] assembled who among them can declare
[32:30] this and show us former things who can
[32:34] show us the plan of God and what's from
[32:37] the times past to the present and to
[32:39] show us why God is calling us why God
[32:43] wants to give us the holy
[32:49] spirit that they may be
[32:53] justified or let them hear
[32:58] and say it is the truth notice that it
[33:01] says those that will be justified it
[33:04] says let them
[33:05] hear why because Faith cometh by hearing
[33:10] and the hearing by the word of God let
[33:15] them say hear and say it is the truth or
[33:20] let them hear and say it is the truth ye
[33:24] are my Witnesses sayeth the Lord and my
[33:28] servant whom I have
[33:30] chosen that ye may know and believe me
[33:34] and understand that I am he before me
[33:38] there was no God formed neither shall
[33:41] there be after me I even I am the Lord
[33:47] that's present progressive tense that's
[33:49] the emphatic variant not I was not I
[33:52] will be I
[33:55] am like when that light that appeared to
[33:58] Moses in the burning bush and he asked
[34:01] who will I say sent me and the light
[34:04] simply answered I am that I am and here
[34:09] he's saying in verse 11 I even I am the
[34:13] Lord and beside me there is no
[34:17] savior I have
[34:19] declared and and have saved and I have
[34:24] showed when there was no strange God
[34:27] among you therefore ye are my Witnesses
[34:30] sayeth the Lord that I am God what a
[34:36] tremendous thing so can you see yourself
[34:39] in these scriptures can you see that
[34:41] he's calling his sons from every nation
[34:44] under the Earth and he's bringing these
[34:47] blind people from the east from the west
[34:50] from the north to the South to what for
[34:52] one purpose and that is to receive the
[34:55] Holy Spirit
[35:01] you know it talked
[35:03] about his name the name of the
[35:07] Lord and now I would like to read a
[35:10] quote out of the message the Patmos
[35:14] Vision preached in
[35:17] 1960 in it's paragraph
[35:22] 132 the greatest of all Revelations is
[35:25] the deity the Supreme deity of our Lord
[35:30] Jesus
[35:31] Christ you can't get to first base until
[35:34] you believe that and here the messenger
[35:37] of the Lord is saying until you receive
[35:40] a
[35:42] revelation of the Supreme deity of our
[35:45] Lord Jesus
[35:46] Christ you can't even get to first base
[35:51] until you believe that now
[35:54] notice it didn't say that you have to
[35:57] understand everything about it you must
[36:00] believe that in order to get to first
[36:07] base that's what Peter said
[36:10] repent and see the
[36:12] deity and be baptized in the name of
[36:16] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[36:19] sins and then you are ready to go in the
[36:24] spirit notice this is the first part of
[36:28] the
[36:31] preparation the first thing you have to
[36:33] KN to know is the deity of
[36:36] Christ I am Alpha and Omega I am from A
[36:41] to Z there there's no more but me I was
[36:47] at the beginning I'll be at the end I am
[36:50] he that was which is and shall come the
[36:54] almighty think of it that's what the
[36:57] trumpet said notice it's saying the same
[36:59] thing that that the book of Isaiah said
[37:02] he says I am God there's no other God
[37:06] that's been formed before me I alone am
[37:09] God and here he's saying the same thing
[37:12] but now in the New Testament God has
[37:15] revealed to us the name of
[37:19] God which is the Lord Jesus
[37:23] Christ I think that for this first part
[37:27] I would like to stop here and we will
[37:30] continue on in the next part we will go
[37:33] into the first
[37:35] scripture that our messenger used to
[37:38] start the message what is the Holy
[37:42] Spirit
