that we do pero parece que todo lo que hace the media the news los de comunicaciones mas word the people around you la la gente results through you even the religious realm it seems like everything is there to stress you out as a catalyst is Paris Teresa you know you know that stress and anxiety specifically stress heal and see that especially amongst younger women especially men say in Harris Albany for younger girls muchacha Hoeven is it said that between between 1999 and 2014 desync and Miller is in - no intern where al dos mil Couture say there's been an increase of stress or anxiety I have no mentos an illustration and Ciara and we're talking about clinically acknowledged depression okay hablando de una depression is that Linda comenteis a talent but it's increased 24% there are all mental and inventive Quattroporte oh they're wondering what's happening SE preguntan entonces que esta pasando exciting and especially predominant in younger females and girls buzz dominant a in Moorhead is hope in it so there's a lot of studies going on right now which is a studious our wondering what it is and what's going on but I would understand que esta pasando what has the people stressed out que lo que tiene la gente stress out what has them anxious get lost in attendance you so what has them going crazy in caelis I say queso you even even in young people upstairs holiness I'm gonna say a few things I'm gonna try to help you we're akunis cosas para que les at you day but you look at the young people through well as holiness even though the younger children all those Nino's pequeños okay and there's no one in particular okay not a not en particular event do you ever talk to a child just say three four or five years old I couldn't I knew it it was Tracy's inquiry and you talk to them you start lookin at you and they don't hear they're sick they don't hear you but I think an OL escuchan it's like they they don't even know that you're talking about it me sound like usted habla hey I'm talking to you it's all on the contig oh you know it have you ever say have you seen anyone notice that I get something on it so what is it that's going on with with the mines are mine esta pasando Coulomb NT and not just young people but but everyone knows oh la la hora es para todos it seems that this correlation with the anxiety but is a canonical correlation : cierra and it says our relationships and communities ties are weaker case in que lo que lo que se hace más de vidas en nuestra relations Kanaka were focused more on goals such as money fame and image volcanoes fo compose mass and metas como se llama el dinero which Tim castles work Alima Han KK Tim karate team castle he's a psychologist Suzy koloko has shown is correlation that has correlation with anxiety and depression uh middle is that is the correlation concea that leprosy on our expectations are too high investors expect that even some Realtors follow because the emphasis on you can be anything you want possibly when temporal emphasis they came step where they said look you state Kira and highly positive views he vistas positivists so what happens when when things don't go your way does this kept a second de las cosas no Selene de su manera young people what happens when you don't get the job you want it give us a call if still Athenian to receive al trabajo near it when you funk a course cuz if they appeared in Caruso when when maybe that boy that grow that I wanted to talk just talking to someone else like ad hablando con alguien mas it seemed like the young people don't know how to handle things a Cohen is a metro condo some equipment Harris and I'll say I'll see why in a little bit they will porque in a moment this is in general I'm not just I'm not saying about this church ok Rolando soloistic lacy in general will talk about about the generations here in a bit estamos hablando Alejandra sumos are like in memory in a moment our expectations are too high that suspect that he was some Realtors and we never teach the younger generation how to deal with failures or mistakes in Orleans in Yama's Alejandra seumas woman is kamala gr confide yes yeah Rory's but we're in a message brother we don't we don't fail there's no there's no mistakes almost enemies I don't know if I almost no I wrote it since I want thing you better you better believe that there's failures and there's mistakes ago that was ok I wrote is if I yes and the thing is we have to teach the people how to deal with them get their most kids in yellow so to escamole the air coalition because there's a lot of times when we pray for certain things ok i basis code I was poor sailor maybe doesn't want you to have that he does no quiere usted thank I so when your eyes it's a failure into so hose is una una fight you're a doctor and all reality it's just a plan of God for you pero angrily that is case el plan de espera space so especially especially the younger generation this elemental I ended a SEOmoz Hoeven we have to bring your expectations down to earth illness gave a heartless suspect that he was a lot of that we have to know how to deal with failures Lydia call as fight when things don't go our way when the las cosas Australian an Islamic because those things will come for K so v-ne and if they're not prepared Houston estar preparado then they don't know what to do entonces no sorry can they're freaked out to say say say say soos done so and and and we seem like we always talk about this but is it I see a problem exist but the explosion explosion in social media in general paralyze policy on a los medios sociales in general they say is a direct correlation you think is directamente una una una correlation with depression con la depression you say because you have less face-to-face interaction be a name menos interact young Caracara you isolate yourself they say in a solace and and I'm not throwing at her you know stricted and earlier I deal with a lot of work is what I do is okay I go your way and I'll give you an example we have a young man that works with us it is doing so true and he's a he's a sharp he's a sharp young gentleman it's all open muy inteligente he's a go-getter it is alguien que que que isn't enthroned but he's a millennial better soon millennial and he's very sharp okay yes muy inteligente e but he did not know how to deal with failure pero no sorry commonly they are con con fight even though he's a least experienced technician that we have okay LLL technical Menace experimental he's the most verbal and most opinionated I still came a subpoena Elmas verbal but he's the one who knows less the raziel case now a menos so anytime I have to go and correct him novice ki KI recorder here Lou I have to come at a certain angle they work earlier this year terminator I have an older gentleman that works with me tango I come here oh my Orkut raha conmigo have a baby boomer that works with me you know kk opinion seok-ki any pillows the loss in Quintus I have a couple of Generation Xers they go oh no that I handed a C on it and I have one millennium you millennial and so the reason I started studying this lettuce okay is to us because working in and where I work for kid on the trabajo you so the company got bought out by a bigger corporation a control company ala computer corporation masculine and in this corporation they're a little more strict he saw mass is strict so we have to be careful tenemos que tener mucho cuidado we have to be politically correct and everything that we do we political mental correct dose and okay same so we can't sing a lot just anybody nope I'm also know this is you know mas because now we're liable for lawsuits for controls estamos pendiente cycle golly so we had to find a harder reach these different groups a most k-code como el cáncer estos group and it's tricky because one I can correct one way es algo complicado kakora he denominator but the millennia he's special pero los millennial is on a specialist and and and there's an all reality I don't know what he's thinking half the time yeah really dad maybe attempt was a que piensa he's very passionate what he does who said we Appassionata low-caste he means well it k de ser el bien he wants to excel today el caso de salir there's no one more motivated in in that office that him knowing that he must motivate onl oficina kill but just he's different pero es diferente so what so what is yeah so I started studying these generations and just to give you a little just just to set a little foundation get this para para fundamentalist we understand here a Sione's 19 24 and 25 to 45 or 46 the bin low has hit 220 Quattro and T Cinco al corriente sink liquid they say they come the Silent Generation the Geminid a C&C Lin they were stair home mom's errand mom asked is a cannon La Casa demands pledged their job their loyalty to one job dos hombres de la vuelta al trabajo the children grew up during

divorce in ratio america trajo divorce you divorce was beginning to be tolerated at that time in is a pro campus austere totally leveled awards you so it looks like the because those were the child and a Silent Generation porque no los hijos de la nación ceiling so looks like they came out of the shower he salieron a Justin tone says that they look at ward off Generation Xers and that that's where I fall in it on the coyote online interesting there was a key error the two income families later they lost interest they lost those batteries the rising divorce rates cemento I'll divorce you the first dig here children they call them latchkey kids the person who knows what that here's the ninos because the both parents had to work work on flawless Palestinian at Rama had or because

this and this is okay this is the the studies that we're done okay it's just on a studio Eskimos at you rather than having the parents tell them what is right and look at this the kilo spider is let's dig a locust a correcto their their lives are not run by smart gadgets those whose leaders are so money has purple instrumentals intelligent this and because they have this entitlement the sense of entitlement sheep or cows I like a pianist this until the k-state allows at all they have difficulty dealing with pressure pressures of the world in which is difficult as Liendo kalispera Sione's they're the most educated so lose muscle who cows yeah they're one of the group's I have the least jobs jobs as you know their loss group was keen in May no straw they're the smartest so Loomis

trend of the millennium pero si en las pastillas millennion the only thing that that they know lonely coca sorry is that they're just as depressed isn't and de premios so we see these generations and each one tries to avoid or be better than what their parents had a dozen Ascona Vitas air or quiere ser mejor que sus Padres you know and and there's and there's actually there's one thing that I wanna really wanna touch on is a you know one of the things are really affected me because I go to karaoke Kimberly uh efekta cuz cuz I have a sister also that's a millennial tengo una rata Minkus

within 100 meters masse kid will go on testimony but I read an article layin artículo and and it really stood out to me after the pastor's message on Sunday he's so very salut was Dante's put dimensional pastoral Domingo it says a scientist in China physical scientific oh and Gina has he claims to have created the world's first genetically edited baby this is a que aquí el el primero a way I ended up kinetic Amenti creado in a potential groundbreaking controversial medical first in a noon noon territorial put the sale meant a controversial America meant the controversial I don't know if you guys how many I've ever heard on the gene-editing you've heard on other editing jeans supporters which are the converse K edit antennas so they've been able to add a genes like in mice it was this edit and heinous component only certain mushrooms in in cierto Tsongas and apparently now they have human studies are para tomato retinas to you tomorrow so they don't know how true it is yet no sorry kitten better than a racist uh but so what they do the purpose of this tape repositories to is and it says all realities to see you so you can you know lay up our studies but ok ok so so this kind of gene editing is banned in most countries as they people edition the henna says esta stop it in module realises many mainstream scientists think that is too unsafe to try muchos científicos principalis
