you were gonna a goose casino huddled in Tracy easy harem but a kiss yeah a taste of this yet but for me so we see here there was a key now we know that all scripture is compound so a mosquito's

Prophet no sentimental via then Profeta not just in the days that the Apostles no solamente no theaters a post on it but it has to make itself alive that Athena case they assess Aveda today ie by me and you or stay yo otherwise were just reading a history book the otra manera solamente stubbornly into Libra historia so you young people stays holiness it's got to be real Enoch is a reality it has to be real in your life Enoch is a reality Sylvia's not an impersonation no-name personification because we know that the word Pharisee porque most couple of the fatty sale how many knows what the word in Greek Pharisee means scientist I mean look is the block to significant a palau de funny sail in Diego anybody again it's an actor it soon act or somebody that acts I can get do I like something that they're not come I go que no son so it's gotta be real genuine in a Cathedral in window you have to be a real Christian who say they rest in occasional Christian or realm in T not an

me intellect a sense in your eyes or air then it's gotta be genuine and it can we know so let's just see how genuine it is like condemn escape and we know and how we can identify ourselves oh come on those beliefs cannot I mean was where the scripture that we just read Alaska to the K account of the day now we read in mark Babel st. Marcos that a woman kill a Mook in having an alabaster box in Yendo Nicastro came to Jesus he knows his sooth but if we turn over in our scripture over to John she will give us an escape to the sock one we want to find out who this woman is vamos arose quintic irresistible here right correcto so then Jesus six days before the Passover John 12 windows he came to Bethany where Lazarus was dia de
