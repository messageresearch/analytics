[44:01] Book of Life Teresa Lewis Thomas and

[44:51] know my sister or you though it's
[44:55] talking about something on the inside of

[44:58] understand you know Romans 10 says
[45:00] Romano's DSD sir faith cometh by hearing
[45:03] the Fabian important for Louie karma
[45:09] come on that means time
[45:11] yes okay listen tiempo and E that's a
[45:15] conjunction
[45:15] yes a looky-loo Kunta so this has to
[45:18] connect with this in social technical
[45:20] kinetic we start our party or it ain't
[45:22] gonna work on over function our faith
[45:24] cometh by hearing Vienna / oh yeah oh
[45:27] yeah comes into our mind you know knows
[45:29] those men how many believe the word when
[45:31] you hear want to scream the political
[45:32] little scooter it's God trying to get
[45:34] inside of you you're stuffed under the
[45:36] understand but it has a process or to
[45:38] know process so faith cometh by hearing
[45:40] in a portaloo year comma comma and the
[45:45] hearing he enter you oh now it's not
[45:48] talking about just this no no master
[45:50] long Solomon Tedesco D hearing
[45:53] and oh yeah in other words that which
[45:55] gives you the ability to receive the

[46:04] hearing I said that I'll owe you so that
[46:06] you can hear like a boiler or you the
[46:08] world la palabra not let it go in one
[46:11] ear and go out the other okay internal
[46:13] use a lame man praise God I like that
[46:16] faith cometh by hearing favorite lawyer
[46:18] and the hearing you know you by the word
[46:22] for now everything is by the word
[46:25] although is for louder amen so now we
[46:28] notice then it says that the names these
[46:31] names were not are not written in the
[46:34] Lamb's Book of Life its life slain from
[46:37] the foundation of the world those normal
[46:38] new person and liberal la vida por el
[46:42] mundo and we saw how about that that to
[46:45] the human mind doesn't make any sense he
[46:47] almost came on Oso no Tina sentido how
[46:50] is it that the lamb was slain before the
[46:53] foundation of the world almost quarter
[46:55] of women although this is the antenna
[46:58] pre-fund on him when I went to the del
[47:00] mundo how is that come on
[47:03] well I was as far as what my mommy and
[47:05] daddy taught me he was killed or slain

[47:10] don't get those mean I know so trust a
[47:13] man I'm trying to get ya can you follow
[47:15] that will ensue either so amen so now
[47:18] let's go here and we realize that when
[47:21] God sees anything in his mind brother
[47:23] somos que cuando yo si algo cemento he
[47:25] begins to think he'll commit sabotage
[47:27] and he thinks more European conceptions

[47:48] always thought about me but but Oquendo
[47:50] pienso que siempre all up inside of me
[47:52] that's why he wrote my name well as well
[47:54] is gonna be mi nombre that's why when he
[47:56] calls my name or took William I mean
[47:58] hombre I know it's him your secure cell
