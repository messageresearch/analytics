[40:52] and uh
[40:55] and to keep y'all standing so long let
[40:57] us uh jump in right into the scriptures
[41:03] we're going to go to John chapter 11.
[41:11] chapter 11 we're going to jump around
[41:12] here a little bit okay uh we're going to
[41:14] start off with verse 17 talking about
[41:17] Lazarus is
[41:25] verse 17 then when Jesus came he found
[41:28] that he had laying in the grave four
[41:31] days already this is yeti
[41:34] Vino pues Jesus
[41:40] we're going to go down in verse 24
[41:42] Martha saith unto him I know that he
[41:44] shall rise again in the resurrection at
[41:47] that last day Resurrection
[41:56] Jesus said unto her I am the
[41:58] resurrection and the life he that
[42:00] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[42:03] shall he live
[42:05] Jesus
[42:12] Take note here that when Jesus came to
[42:15] Lazarus
[42:16] Jesus Lazarus was dead for four days
[42:21] and he was in the grave for four days
[42:26] so the same day that he died
[42:29] was the same day that they buried him
[42:33] now we're going to jump over to verse
[42:35] 42.
[42:38] and I knew that thou hears me always but
[42:42] because the because of the people which
[42:44] I stand which I stand by I said it that
[42:48] they may believe that thou has sent me
[43:01] when he thus has spoken he cried with a
[43:05] loud voice Lazareth come forth yeah
[43:13] and he that was dead came forth bound
[43:16] hand and foot with grave clothes and his
[43:18] face was bound up about with a napkin
[43:21] Jesus say unto and I want to emphasize
[43:24] on the word them he saith unto them lose
[43:28] him and let him go
[43:38] vendas Jesus
[43:49] now let's just go to the book of Acts
[43:52] chapter 9.
[43:54] we're going to be reading verses 36 to
[43:56] 39. I'm just going to read it in English
[44:05] just to save a little bit of time there
[44:07] was a there was a japa
[44:10] a certain disciple named Tabitha which
[44:13] by interpretation is called Dorcas this
[44:16] woman was full of good works and all
[44:18] sees which she did and it came to pass
[44:20] in those days that she was sick and died
[44:23] whom when they had walked whom they had
[44:27] washed and laid her in an upper room
[44:30] and for his for for as much as little
[44:33] was night to Joppa and the disciples had
[44:36] heard that Peter was there they sent
[44:39] unto him two men Desiring him that he
[44:42] would not delay to come to them
[44:44] amen let's bow our heads dear Lord at
[44:46] this time father
[44:48] we just asked her that you be with each
[44:50] and every one of us Lord
[44:52] we asked Lord that you would anoint
[44:54] these words father um
[44:56] the years of your people the hearts
[44:58] fathers
[45:00] your precious Most Holy names
[45:04] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[45:06] you may be seated
[45:09] amen now the title that I have up here
[45:13] might seem a little odd
[45:19] I when I was asked to preach
[45:22] I started to think of a title I said man
[45:25] it's got to be some kind of a deep crazy
[45:27] title you know uh
[45:32] began to meditate a little bit
[45:36] a shopping cart hit me
[45:40] and it took me back to a time with with
[45:43] our pastor
[45:45] pastor we had gone to the grocery store
[45:48] we must uh
[45:50] and uh
[45:54] and uh we had gone a few things
[45:57] and we came back outside
[46:00] and I remember that I was pushing the
[46:03] the shopping cart
[46:05] we got the stuff down and
[46:31] and it landed in uh in in a parking
[46:34] space one of those guys
[46:41] so that was the wrong thing to do yeah
[46:46] I get back in the car
[46:50] and
[46:57] I'm like
[46:59] there's somebody that gets paid to do
[47:01] that
[47:06] he said but but there's there's a place
[47:08] for it
[47:11] there's a place to put it
[47:13] I said yeah but I'm not getting paid to
[47:16] do that
[47:18] well that was that triggered him
[47:22] and he said yeah you would say something
[47:26] uh
[47:28] that's the way most people are nowadays
[47:31] they don't want to take any responses
[47:36] so our pasture went on for a little bit
[47:40] and you know I took it
[47:42] and I was like okay well let me get back
[47:46] out and go put the shopping cart where
[47:47] it goes okay okay
[47:53] and you know at the time I thought it
[47:55] was just the shopping cart that he was
[47:57] upset
[48:00] but it was the beginning stages of him
[48:03] trying to teach responsibility
[48:10] so that's how I got the title of this
[48:12] message
[48:14] to talk a little bit responsible foreign
[49:06] she was that kind of woman
[49:11] just a very giving person
[49:15] I knew how to use what the most simplest
[49:18] gift that she had yes
[49:24] and and this lady like Lazarus is
[49:29] she got a sickness
[49:32] and she ended up dying and I remember uh
[49:36] uh take me back to brother Rigo um
[49:40] at his funeral when everybody was
[49:43] talking so many good things about it
[49:47] they were crying about how good of a
[49:49] person he was
[49:52] reminding me a lot of brothers
[49:56] I remember that after the funeral
[50:00] I was talking to our Brother Carlos
[50:03] and I can't remember which one of us
[50:06] said it
[50:08] but we said wow did you see how they
[50:10] talked about it
[50:14] and he was like hey I wonder what
[50:17] they're going to say in our funeral
[50:27] brother
[50:29] he started saying all these good things
[50:31] about me
[50:34] and I was like okay so then he finished
[50:37] I was like hey it's my turn
[50:40] you know saying all this stuff right
[50:43] but we need to examine ourselves
[50:47] and see really really who who it is what
[50:50] kind of a person we really are real
[50:54] now dorkus she was not the only disciple
[50:58] there
[51:01] but the scriptures say that there was
[51:03] other disciples there with her
[51:07] and this this death of dorkus is
[51:11] death of Dorcas it wasn't too the time
[51:15] frame it wasn't too far off from the
[51:17] resurrection of Lazarus I don't know if
[51:20] when we already
[51:23] for the day of Pentecost
[51:25] it wasn't too far off
[51:29] and they must have heard
[51:32] because they weren't too far away either
[51:38] they must have heard and believed that
[51:40] the Holy Spirit was given to men
[51:45] because Lazarus when Lazarus was was
[51:48] when Lazarus died
[51:52] he died and they bury him
[51:55] the same day as we heard
[52:02] what they did with her
[52:04] must have heard what happened on the day
[52:06] of Pentecost
[52:09] because they didn't wash and bury her
[52:11] porqueers
[53:08] and these disciples believe so much
[53:12] that they said go call Peter
[53:17] and I like what Peter does
[53:21] because Peter does when they go and they
[53:23] call him
[53:24] he doesn't go and say hey well there's
[53:27] another disciple that was Jew with Jesus
[53:28] too
[53:32] you should go call on this brother
[53:34] he didn't do that
[53:37] Peter took responsibility
[53:40] he went and he said take me to her
[53:45] and I can see Peter yeah
[53:48] maybe this was one of the first times
[53:52] that they had her in an upper room
[53:56] maybe he's walking up the stairs
[54:01] remembering what happened
[54:06] I can believe that he is thinking that
[54:09] is
[54:11] thinking that what happens when you come
[54:13] up just a little bit higher
[54:36] they were we
[54:37] were crying that's how much of an impact
[54:43] and just like Jesus
[54:45] I just see Peter maybe as Jesus weak
[54:53] I can't see her that maybe she that
[54:56] maybe Peter started to get a little bit
[54:58] of his eyes just a little bit watery
[55:01] okay
[55:04] he tells all of them to leave the room
[55:08] because Peter had been in this same
[55:12] exact scenario Before
[55:16] Peter had experienced this scenario
[55:18] experience and why did Peter experience
[55:22] this scenario
[55:23] experience because Peter was part of the
[55:27] them
[55:31] when they were in the Tomb with Lazarus
[55:34] was a part of the them
[55:37] sales but now here's Peter Pedro and he
[55:41] witnessed all these things that Jesus
[55:43] did
[55:44] Jesus he witnessed the blind to see uh
[55:53] but the very thing that he witnessed
[55:57] the very experience that he witnessed
[56:01] that very experience was now inside
[56:06] and he did exactly what Jesus
[56:10] and he prayed and by name he calls her
[56:15] we remember the rich young woman
[56:19] when Jesus thought when Jesus would
[56:21] speak to him
[56:22] he would always refer to him as the rich
[56:25] young girl
[56:27] yet this man wanted eternal life
[56:31] but the Rich Young Ruler had no
[56:34] relationship with God
[56:37] typically
[58:33] there he is
[58:37] foreign what a plan
[58:40] get done what a plan amen get plan now I
[58:43] don't know how you feel you know
[58:46] I don't know sometimes this this woman
[58:48] she was dead
[58:50] and I don't know if you feel dead
[58:52] sometimes
[58:54] and if you don't God bless you I'm not
[58:57] trying to put anything in your head is
[59:04] if you feel dead in anxiety if you feel
[59:08] dead in these things
[59:10] I'm telling you how important you are to
[59:13] God
[59:15] how important that you are to God
[59:18] because when God
[59:20] started creating the world
[59:27] God said
[59:29] and God said God was speaking all these
[59:33] things
[59:35] the first time that God screamed church
[59:38] one of his own
[1:00:38] prophecy of Psalm 22
[1:00:49] [Applause]
[1:00:51] what is he trying to
[1:00:53] the ultimate price has been paid
[1:00:56] now it's safe for you to come out
[1:01:02] [Applause]
[1:01:50] I bless you this beautiful evening
[1:02:17] but not before thanking you first for
[1:02:20] the opportunity
[1:02:25] I believe that when a pastor let someone
[1:02:29] borrow his puppet
[1:02:31] it is
[1:02:41] and if you ever hear me saying or
[1:02:45] calling him my body or my friend
[1:03:12] and I would like to turn to the book of
[1:03:14] Isaiah chapter 42.
[1:03:18] and I we would like to see
[1:03:25] locations
[1:03:31] during that time
[1:03:34] he is the same today foreign
[1:04:02] hand I will keep Thee I will give thee
[1:04:05] for a covenant of the people for a light
[1:04:08] of the Gentiles
[1:04:14] I like how the King James version says
[1:04:17] for light of the Gentile
[1:04:19] just keep that part
[1:04:23] is
[1:04:29] to open the blind eyes to bring out the
[1:04:32] prisoners from the prison to and damn
[1:04:34] that sit in the darkness out of the
[1:04:37] prison house
[1:04:43] reading of his word
[1:04:46] um
[1:04:47] we see the purpose
[1:04:51] first the prophet Isaiah is saying is
[1:04:58] the topic we would like to share in this
[1:05:00] evening is
[1:05:05] the same that the prophet of God would
[1:05:07] preach in January 25th
[1:05:11] turn on the light
[1:06:10] always respecting the truth
[1:06:13] foreign
[1:08:08] raise your hands
[1:09:11] a person foreign
[1:10:25] has given you a call
[1:11:27] with life why
[1:12:15] through which life comes foreign
[1:14:16] there's no future foreign
[1:15:18] it's not about words
[1:15:23] but it has a power and foreign
[1:16:24] so what limits this
[1:16:56] what's happening
[1:17:16] the word of God boys
[1:17:28] rituals
[1:17:30] that are kept from Generations
[1:17:36] you want to tell the person to do it
[1:17:38] this way
[1:17:40] and they say no no because my
[1:17:43] grandfather would do it like
[1:17:45] my dad used to do it like this and I do
[1:17:49] it like this
[1:17:50] and you say but realize that there's
[1:17:53] another way
[1:17:55] well wait a moment
[1:17:57] my son has to do it the same way
[1:18:01] and his son has to do it the same way
[1:18:05] that's what a tradition is
[1:18:09] a transmission of cultures and
[1:18:16] it comes and matches the way
[1:18:35] [Music]
[1:18:54] [Applause]
[1:19:17] and it happened foreign
[1:19:36] [Applause]
[1:19:56] doing the works
[1:20:03] that was the Gospel that's just
[1:20:06] presenting is God
[1:20:08] it is
[1:20:19] [Applause]
[1:20:43] and you hear his noise we hear the noise
[1:21:11] it hears its noise
[1:21:15] but you don't know where it's coming
[1:21:17] from
[1:21:18] that's how everyone is
[1:21:21] that is born of the spirit foreign
[1:21:44] they didn't watch them
[1:21:49] you know they didn't wash them yeah did
[1:21:52] you know that what did they do is that
[1:21:56] we're looking
[1:22:01] disciples are now washing their hands
[1:22:07] what did the Lord Jesus Christ do
[1:22:11] it
[1:22:13] right now I'm gonna teach them how to
[1:22:16] wash their hands
[1:22:18] they didn't entangle him
[1:22:22] he said that which comes in does not
[1:22:25] hurt you but that which goes out
[1:22:28] because it comes out from the heart
[1:22:32] where every heart is
[1:22:36] that is what truly hurts
[1:22:39] nothing happens to you
[1:22:42] but that's why they condemned them yes
[1:22:44] and it's to the bride yes
[1:22:48] because she is
[1:23:00] but the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:02] she knows that she's free
[1:23:05] she's not making this word
[1:23:07] because by his word it says
[1:23:17] why
[1:24:57] and if you say do this
[1:25:19] an
[1:25:26] inch of his
[1:25:52] Jesus Christ is so real foreign
[1:26:36] the delicacy
[1:27:37] Jesus Christ is
[1:27:39] opened

[1:27:56] Jesus Christ is here
[1:27:59] and he came to deliver you
[1:28:02] he came to heal you
[1:28:05] came to help you
[1:28:10] it's just it's just not another service
[1:28:15] the power of God
[1:28:17] wants to do something in your life
[1:28:22] and I'll finish with this
[1:28:25] you shall see me and the works that I do
[1:28:29] yeah you do also
[1:28:32] he is the same God
[1:28:35] he's waiting for his people
[1:28:39] and take him out of History
[1:28:58] we have we have tested by his word
[1:29:03] and we should do it
[1:29:06] until God is real in our lives let us
