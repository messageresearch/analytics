[46:18] y'all to be excited come on
[46:22] all right now that's what I'm talking
[46:24] about
[46:27] so if we can stand this we could read a
[46:29] scripture
[46:33] little prayer beforehand is a
[46:37] playlist
[46:40] so
[46:41] in Matthew
[46:43] chapter 11 Mateo
[46:49] verse 12 verse
[47:03] and from the days of John the Baptist
[47:07] until now the Kingdom of Heaven
[47:09] suffereth violence
[47:21] and the violent take it by force
[47:26] for all the prophets in the law
[47:28] prophesied until John
[47:33] hasta Juan and if ye will receive it
[47:36] this is Elias which was or to come
[47:45] amen let's our heads
[47:48] Heavenly Father Lord we get started
[47:51] father two say everything that you want
[47:53] us to say and do everything that you
[47:55] want us to do Lord
[48:03] quality we just give you all the honor
[48:05] and Glory La Gloria Lord and we
[48:08] surrender ourselves fully and completely
[48:10] Lord
[48:16] in Jesus Christ
[48:19] you may be seated
[48:21] one session thousand
[48:24] so
[48:26] the just to pick up where they they were
[48:28] talking about that day
[48:31] that day on Calvary the message of
[48:33] brother Branham
[48:41] and the third question
[48:43] that
[48:45] the brothers went over yesterday
[48:50] you know what are we doing today
[48:53] about that day on Calvary question
[49:00] don't get so serious
[49:03] so what are we doing
[49:08] okay each and every one of us has to
[49:10] answer that question
[49:13] for ourselves right
[49:16] now for me
[49:18] follow me that day on Calvary
[49:27] he
[49:29] he did what he did for me
[49:32] and he didn't have to yeah
[49:38] it was
[49:40] it was something God himself coming down
[49:45] and coming to Serve the People
[49:50] and then he tops it off with I'm going
[49:53] to redeem the people also yes
[49:57] you know for me seeing that so
[50:02] I I have no other choice but to give it
[50:05] my own
[50:08] I mean till the day I die I'm gonna give
[50:10] it my own
[50:12] no matter how tired I get important
[50:16] how much I don't want you
[50:19] and I know some of you guys are like oh
[50:21] brother you shouldn't have that attitude
[50:22] well I'm just being honest
[50:29] but that's the difference is realizing
[50:32] hey he did this for me you think he
[50:34] wanted to but I said
[50:38] I mean he did want to but do you think
[50:40] he was just happy to do it
[50:46] so so for me I'm gonna do that
[50:51] brother Levi it's good to see you very
[50:53] good to see you
[50:59] so you know brother Branham talks about
[51:01] a few things in that in that message
[51:06] and he says on that day he said yeah and
[51:10] he types it with that question but he
[51:11] also types it with the baptism of the
[51:13] Holy Spirit
[51:16] now on that day
[51:19] we have the gifts we were given a gift
[51:24] of the holy spirit
[51:26] so what does that mean
[51:28] I mean we're just we're pumped we're
[51:32] happy
[51:34] is a
[51:36] it doesn't mean that it I mean those
[51:39] things come with it
[51:41] but it also comes with a lot of trials
[51:43] and tribulations
[51:47] the thing
[51:50] the scripture the reason I read that
[51:52] scripture
[51:54] it's gonna it's it's battle all the day
[51:58] that you gave your life to him
[52:02] you're gonna have to fight for every
[52:04] inch
[52:06] or he's going to keep knocking you down
[52:08] and keeping you in the same spot he
[52:10] wants to keep you in okay
[52:13] so when we receive that Holy Spirit
[52:17] that means we're no longer living for
[52:21] ourselves
[52:23] at that point it means now God is living
[52:26] through us
[52:29] we we died out to the world
[52:34] we don't care about the things out there
[52:38] we we ignore our flesh
[52:42] and we focus on what God wants us to do
[52:45] you know
[52:49] going into
[52:50] um
[52:51] I'm going to read a couple of ideas
[53:04] so
[53:07] there you go there you go all right all
[53:11] right so so in in that message
[53:14] I could read a few quotes of of that is
[53:21] that day on Calgary is
[53:25] it says on on paragraph starting off on
[53:28] paragraph 94
[53:30] .
[53:32] brother Branham says notice that brother
[53:35] bran MD said
[53:39] it was so unconsciously done
[53:43] sentimentation not doing things because
[53:46] we should do it
[53:51] that still shot that's still selfish we
[53:56] is
[53:58] sorry I can't help you out nothing at
[54:01] all
[54:02] and a way for me to help you out
[54:06] it was so surprising
[54:09] the sheep that they said Lord
[54:12] because before this he talks about when
[54:16] Jesus says I'm gonna separate the sheep
[54:17] and the goats
[54:22] and he told the goats
[54:27] he didn't do nothing for me
[54:29] I mean he names all these things he
[54:31] didn't do nothing for me he said
[54:33] so now he's talking about the Sheep
[54:38] Lord when were you hungry
[54:43] now this is the Sheep who's the Sheep
[54:46] a man this is us right man
[54:50] Lord when were you hungry
[54:55] when were you hungry and we fed you
[55:01] when did you feed him Joe
[55:03] Elementary right we're the Lambs we're
[55:07] feeding he's talking to us
[55:11] when were you naked
[55:14] and we gave you clothes
[55:18] when when
[55:20] this is the Sheep they don't even
[55:22] what are you talking about
[55:28] and he goes on
[55:32] when were you sick and we minister to
[55:35] you uh
[55:38] foreign
[55:47] just your life lived in them
[55:51] God let the people see that Calvary did
[55:54] for us
[55:57] so automatically
[56:00] and he's saying right there now there
[56:03] there's going to be people that will
[56:04] never come to church
[56:06] there's people that we may come across
[56:09] only once or I can take it
[56:12] but we might
[56:17] that might be the only time that they're
[56:19] going to get served by the Lord
[56:23] and we and then you're serving you're
[56:26] serving the lord but you're also getting
[56:27] served yourself
[56:31] and that's a that's just
[56:34] for me that's a blessing
[56:37] you're going um
[56:40] going to
[56:42] Uganda it's uh it's never
[56:44] it's never
[56:46] um easy
[56:49] it's rough it's hard on the body it's
[56:52] hard on your family
[56:56] um you know you got work it's not cheap
[56:59] you know
[57:02] I'll go
[57:07] but we go
[57:10] with a happy heart
[57:13] because when we get there we we're we're
[57:16] actually we're lining up with another
[57:18] part of us
[57:22] and while they're up there fighting
[57:25] on those grounds we're down here
[57:27] fighting on these grounds
[57:30] when you have two units coming together
[57:35] I mean we're we're happy to see each
[57:37] other
[57:38] we're we're soldiers in God's kingdom
[57:42] and when this trip going up there I mean
[57:45] I could say something about every man
[57:48] that went I mean they're just
[57:49] exceptional
[57:53] senores
[57:55] a man of God
[57:59] and you know it's always it's always
[58:01] awesome to see especially the ones that
[58:03] go for the first time
[58:06] because you all you also are able to see
[58:09] the look on their face
[58:13] of I got it
[58:16] it's you're not you're not just seeing
[58:18] the the people that are getting taught
[58:19] up there you're not just seeing that
[58:21] face on them but you're also seeing it
[58:23] on on some of us
[58:28] yeah and I was uh I was telling brother
[58:32] Aaron
[58:34] it's like um
[58:36] every every time we go for me
[58:42] it's because God's going to equip you
[58:45] for whatever battle he's going to send
[58:47] you
[58:50] I can't I can't equip myself you know a
[58:53] book but I mean nobody can I play he's
[58:56] gotta equip you if he's gonna send you
[58:57] somewhere
[59:00] so for me every time
[59:05] the man up there and and what the Lord
[59:07] has given the pastor and the and and the
[59:09] pastor hands out to the ministers and
[59:11] the men
[59:15] it's not it's not
[59:18] it's not just uh for them up there
[59:21] it's we're also getting for me I level
[59:25] up also but I mean
[59:28] and my spiritual man gets an addition
[59:32] added to me
[59:34] and it's not like oh well we come back
[59:37] and it gets removed it doesn't work that
[59:39] way
[59:41] God doesn't add something to you and
[59:43] take it away
[59:45] not the word not the word he won't do
[59:49] that so so it's it's always
[59:53] it's you you see them they go up there
[59:56] and they're training these men and
[59:59] sometimes I'm like what am I here for
[1:00:02] but like brother Ben said hey if I'm
[1:00:03] just here to carry a Bible well then I'm
[1:00:05] just here to carry a Bible yeah
[1:00:13] so
[1:00:14] you you see them they're they're over
[1:00:17] there training these men and and you
[1:00:19] know a little bit and here and there and
[1:00:21] you know yeah
[1:00:26] and at the same time you're also getting
[1:00:27] trained
[1:00:30] so so it was really it was really
[1:00:33] awesome just to see the way the
[1:00:35] our pastor who has
[1:00:39] used by the Lord to
[1:00:43] to train these men
[1:00:45] you know like if there's somebody in
[1:00:48] boxing or MMA
[1:00:51] Deportes or boxing well there's men that
[1:00:55] train them differently
[1:00:57] so brother Jerry and brother Danny
[1:00:59] Hermanos big MMA fans right
[1:01:06] you might have a coach that trains them
[1:01:09] just on hands right then that's uh one
[1:01:11] that trains them on kicks
[1:01:14] a grappling coach
[1:01:16] a defense coach a defensive an offense
[1:01:19] coach offensa
[1:01:21] and it was the I was watching brother
[1:01:24] Caleb do this with the man okay you go
[1:01:26] do this and all right now you is
[1:01:31] that's all I could think of in my
[1:01:36] they're looking at this and they're
[1:01:39] getting the word
[1:01:42] but through
[1:01:44] a spiritual look
[1:01:46] spiritual here he is getting trained
[1:01:49] they're getting trained
[1:01:51] they're getting trained to fight
[1:01:53] properly
[1:01:55] go against the enemy without a doubt
[1:01:58] know what it says
[1:02:07] love y'all
[1:02:33] amen God bless you

[1:02:57] well when we're gone we we miss you
[1:03:02] hey man I'm gonna ask you to stand
[1:03:05] I think our pastor for this opportunity
[1:03:09] and we're gonna we're gonna turn into a
[1:03:12] very a very uh well-known uh scripture
[1:03:18] probably the most recognized scripture
[1:03:21] in in the Bible
[1:03:25] John 3 16 says
[1:03:33] and it says for God so loved the world
[1:03:35] that he gave
[1:03:40] Al Mundo
[1:03:43] amen may the Lord has blessings to the
[1:03:46] reading of the word and you may be
[1:03:47] seated
[1:03:48] [Music]
[1:03:51] Amen to all our brothers from Uganda who
[1:03:54] might be watching this uh either now or
[1:03:57] at a later time
[1:04:01] I just want to tell them
[1:04:10] foreign
[1:04:21] that's what I learned in six years
[1:04:23] [Applause]
[1:04:27] you you know it's uh it it it's um
[1:04:33] the second time we went to to uh to
[1:04:36] Uganda
[1:04:39] um it was it was December of
[1:04:41] 2017.ie
[1:04:43] right before we left
[1:04:47] um my father
[1:04:49] uh he put his arm on my shoulder
[1:04:54] and he told me something that was uh
[1:04:57] that that really uh that really impacted
[1:05:00] me
[1:05:01] and it really impacted our our
[1:05:05] pastor brother and brother Tommy and our
[1:05:08] ministry
[1:05:10] and all he said
[1:05:12] let's continue
[1:05:18] that was six years ago
[1:05:27] Africa is a very special place for my
[1:05:30] father Africa is
[1:05:34] he had such a love for the people
[1:05:40] and
[1:05:42] it was it was his joyful and I shouldn't
[1:05:46] say it was his Joy but it is his Joy
[1:05:48] there's no idea
[1:05:51] you know every every time I I I go to
[1:05:55] Uganda
[1:05:57] I can always feel the presence of of our
[1:06:01] founding Pastor there with us
[1:06:06] I can I can feel how
[1:06:12] how proud he is
[1:06:15] of the man
[1:06:18] that have sacrificed
[1:06:22] that have given their their all for this
[1:06:25] message
[1:06:27] and I know that he's so proud of each
[1:06:30] and every one of us
[1:06:33] and that's what brings me to this
[1:06:36] scripture is
[1:06:38] in John 3 16.
[1:06:42] for God so loved the world
[1:06:49] you know you can't give
[1:06:51] or you can give without loving
[1:06:55] you can give without loving Cinema
[1:06:59] but you can't love without giving
[1:07:05] that first
[1:07:07] uh that first part of that verse
[1:07:11] speaks of God's love for us
[1:07:15] for God so loved
[1:07:22] and what a thing that is
[1:07:25] to give
[1:07:27] so many so many times in life
[1:07:31] we're so worried
[1:07:34] we're so preoccupied
[1:07:37] with about what we're going to receive
[1:07:39] okay
[1:07:41] what we're going to receive from work
[1:07:44] but we're going to receive from school
[1:07:47] we're going to receive on our birthday
[1:07:51] but we're going to receive it after tax
[1:07:53] season
[1:07:56] and sometimes we
[1:07:59] fails to see where what we're going to
[1:08:02] give
[1:08:04] what can we give
[1:08:08] what are we doing
[1:08:10] with this message
[1:08:13] that allows us to give you know
[1:08:17] we can turn into the Book of John again
[1:08:19] chapter one
[1:08:27] John 1 10 Uno dias
[1:08:31] and it speaks on he was in the world
[1:08:34] and the world was made by him
[1:08:37] and the world knew him not and then
[1:08:44] he came unto his own and his own
[1:08:48] received him not and
[1:08:52] but as many as received him
[1:09:06] is
[1:09:14] to freely
[1:09:16] transfer is
[1:09:19] the possession of something
[1:09:22] to someone
[1:09:25] it's to hand over is the passer but I
[1:09:29] thought that was that was pretty amazing
[1:09:32] it's to freely transfer the possession
[1:09:37] of something to someone they are going
[1:09:41] so if I have this this note here in my
[1:09:45] hand
[1:09:47] and I'm saying to brother Julian
[1:09:52] he's not going to take it from my hand
[1:09:56] until I give it to him
[1:10:01] and once I give it to him freely
[1:10:05] what I think that is to receive okay
[1:10:11] but as many as received him
[1:10:16] he received the gift
[1:10:19] to them
[1:10:21] gave he powerless
[1:10:25] to become
[1:10:28] the word become
[1:10:31] is to evolve is
[1:10:34] to change into
[1:10:37] or emerge as something
[1:10:43] to
[1:10:45] he he uh but as many as received him to
[1:10:49] them he gave power to become the sons of
[1:10:52] God
[1:10:53] is
[1:10:59] even to them that believe on his name
[1:11:04] is
[1:11:07] what a wonderful thing that is
[1:11:11] when we can partake
[1:11:14] we have received from home
[1:11:17] and we can part and we can give it to
[1:11:20] somebody
[1:11:21] that has never received the message
[1:11:26] you know it is it's amazing what God can
[1:11:29] do is
[1:11:32] in just six years
[1:11:36] all because of an email
[1:11:41] from a brother
[1:11:44] in Northern
[1:11:46] Uganda
[1:11:47] Norte de Uganda and what
[1:11:51] how amazing is the way that God works
[1:11:56] you know there was a man
[1:11:59] that was that was building the church
[1:12:03] and he uh he prayed to God
[1:12:07] he said Lord I need material for my
[1:12:10] church
[1:12:13] I need laborers for my church
[1:12:17] I just need you for for you to provide
[1:12:22] well one day he got a knock on the door
[1:12:26] and he saw a man
[1:12:29] and the man handed him five acorns
[1:12:34] five acorns Cinco
[1:12:38] de Mayas he says what am I supposed to
[1:12:41] do with five acorns well
[1:12:47] he heard a voice
[1:12:51] well you want to build a church right
[1:12:55] he says yes I do you'll see see but I
[1:12:58] want you you to provide
[1:13:00] he says I have provided
[1:13:03] I've given you acorns
[1:13:06] what are you going to do with the acorns
[1:13:09] he scratched his head
[1:13:12] well I don't know what to do with these
[1:13:18] and when we went six years ago
[1:13:22] you know sometimes you ask the Lord for
[1:13:25] things
[1:13:28] Lord provide
[1:13:30] provide for us
[1:13:32] and sometimes he just hands us a seed
[1:13:36] you know you start you start planting
[1:13:39] the seed
[1:13:41] you don't know you know you don't know
[1:13:44] when it's going to come up
[1:13:48] and then one day
[1:13:52] and this one day was this this past week
[1:13:56] yesterday
[1:13:58] that we were there
[1:14:00] you see the you see many people
[1:14:05] they they worry
[1:14:08] or they they look forward to when you're
[1:14:11] reaping the Harvest
[1:14:15] but they're they're but they don't
[1:14:18] realize
[1:14:19] what the work goes in
[1:14:22] what the work goes into well
[1:14:26] planting the seed
[1:14:28] while this man this past week
[1:14:31] as we were with with the ministers
[1:14:35] what a great thing it was for our pastor
[1:14:38] to go and change it up a little bit
[1:14:42] and as he called each each pastor
[1:14:47] and asked him to do a certain thing is
[1:14:52] you can see
[1:14:55] these past six years
[1:14:58] of what God has produced
[1:15:02] of what God is doing
[1:15:05] and how that seeds
[1:15:08] is maturing
[1:15:10] you don't realize or you sometimes we
[1:15:14] don't take into effect
[1:15:17] on what God is doing in our midstation
[1:15:21] sometimes we just take a look around
[1:15:25] no we can be in in the message for 10 20
[1:15:29] 30 40 years
[1:15:32] and not even realize
[1:15:35] what our level is at what is not realize
[1:15:40] that God okay deals he is he is raising
[1:15:44] us up
[1:15:45] he's doing something great amongst our
[1:15:48] amongst our ranks
[1:15:51] and to see these men
[1:15:54] as they have matured oh I could see I
[1:15:59] can see that seed
[1:16:00] that was deposited six years ago
[1:16:04] coming to fruition
[1:16:07] and as brother Julius would say Julio he
[1:16:12] turned to our pastor pastor and he said
[1:16:15] these are the first fruits
[1:16:20] and I said wow wow praise the Lord
[1:16:24] you know it never gets old
[1:16:27] going to Uganda
[1:16:30] Uganda no I am
[1:16:32] I'm so blessed
[1:16:35] to to be a part of such a great ministry
[1:16:41] you know we went as 14.
[1:16:45] but we went as one man
[1:16:49] as 14 individuals
[1:16:56] and that's so important is because when
[1:16:59] you have 14 people
[1:17:02] you have 14 different ideas
[1:17:06] but it wasn't that way at all
[1:17:10] and it's never been that way
[1:17:13] you know just to see
[1:17:17] Warriors Guerreros my brother Jimmy
[1:17:21] was it Jimmy 69 years old
[1:17:26] you wouldn't think he was 69 years old
[1:17:37] you know
[1:17:40] there are so many examples
[1:17:44] of of men of of Faith
[1:17:48] you know I I look at our pastor pastor
[1:17:52] and what and what he does not only for
[1:17:55] our local congregation
[1:17:57] congregation local but for the missions
[1:18:00] out there
[1:18:02] it's so it's a word it truly is a
[1:18:05] worldwide Ministry
[1:18:08] you know and I've you know what I've
[1:18:10] learned on this trip
[1:18:12] takes me back to a to a to a Chinese
[1:18:15] proverb I thought the other day
[1:18:20] it says
[1:18:22] you give a fish to a man
[1:18:27] feed them for a day
[1:18:30] but you teach a man how to fish
[1:18:33] you feed him for a lifetime
[1:18:37] that's what I saw and and I've been seen
[1:18:40] in Uganda
[1:18:42] you teach someone
[1:18:45] God sent a prophet
[1:18:47] you teach him that it's not the Trinity
[1:18:52] but it's one God
[1:18:55] you teach them that there are three
[1:18:57] stages of Grace
[1:18:59] and just because you went through one
[1:19:02] stage doesn't mean that you're sealed or
[1:19:04] how the Holy Ghost is
[1:19:13] our as our pastor and different
[1:19:15] ministers have have done over the years
[1:19:20] you know you you've seen
[1:19:23] and you see the results of what God has
[1:19:27] done
[1:19:28] and what God continues to do
[1:19:33] it's undeniable
[1:19:36] it's undeniable
[1:19:39] that God in our last days
[1:19:44] he is moving says and he is moving very
[1:19:49] fast
[1:19:53] he is moving quick
[1:19:55] you know you see man that that are
[1:19:58] getting it like that Steven almost
[1:20:09] that they don't care who is is against
[1:20:13] them
[1:20:16] because they know
[1:20:21] and we appreciate everyone's prayers
[1:20:25] we appreciate everyone uh
[1:20:30] you know as as we go out on on the
[1:20:32] missionary field
[1:20:35] I want to thank all the ones that's
[1:20:40] as they're as they stay back home
[1:20:45] that are calling our families and
[1:20:48] checking up on them
[1:20:51] all the brothers and sisters from the
[1:20:54] bottom of my heart this is
[1:20:58] so much and may God bless you yes
[1:21:02] [Applause]
[1:21:27] contentos
[1:21:31] no tonight is the internment
[1:21:37] Jesus when he died
[1:21:40] he just didn't lay in the Tomb um
[1:21:45] he did a lot of things fulfilled many
[1:21:47] scriptures
[1:21:50] but before we enter into that let's go
[1:21:54] in our Bibles to acts the second chapter
[1:21:59] of those
[1:22:01] verses 25-27
[1:22:08] amen amen stand for the reading of the
[1:22:10] world

[1:22:16] foresaw the lord always before my face
[1:22:19] for he is on my right hand that I should
[1:22:22] not be moved is
[1:22:31] therefore did my heart rejoiced and my
[1:22:33] tongue was glad more all over also my
[1:22:37] flesh shall Rest In Hope
[1:22:45] because thou will not leave my soul in
[1:22:48] Hell neither will thou suffer thy Holy
[1:22:52] One to seek corruption
[1:22:59] may the Lord add your blessing to the
[1:23:01] reading of his word and you may be
[1:23:02] seated

[1:23:07] out a few flowers

[1:24:44] amen amen
[1:24:47] thank you my precious family and that's
[1:24:49] my precious family
[1:24:52] because you are my family
[1:24:56] you know as we we think on that day on
[1:24:59] Calvary
[1:25:02] and as brother Mark brought out that
[1:25:05] third question
[1:25:08] what shall we do for that day
[1:25:12] and this will probably be the only quote
[1:25:15] I read because if not I'll go over time
[1:25:27] amen amen
[1:25:30] praise the Lord I may have to turn
[1:25:31] around and look at it
[1:25:36] let's see if it's here
[1:25:38] I have it right here
[1:25:41] this evil age paragraph 69.
[1:25:49] and when the entire word of God
[1:25:52] incomplete was headed up in a human body
[1:25:56] called Jesus Christ
[1:26:04] in there God made me pay for my sins in
[1:26:10] him
[1:26:18] then he rose me
[1:26:20] entonces
[1:26:22] and raised me up with him
[1:26:25] and the resurrection
[1:26:28] and now we are seated with him
[1:26:32] with power and authority over every
[1:26:35] devil
[1:26:37] or if you could only believe what God
[1:26:40] has given us
[1:26:43] but if you're not
[1:26:45] seated there you don't have it
[1:26:50] and if you sit it there and don't
[1:26:52] believe it is
[1:26:54] and afraid to move
[1:26:58] you will never use it
[1:27:01] but if you are seated there
[1:27:05] you will use it
[1:27:07] for your ordained to do what you do
[1:27:11] because
[1:27:14] that's what we can do for that day on
[1:27:17] Calvary yes
[1:27:20] maybe some of you saw that clip from The
[1:27:23] Passion of the Christ last night
[1:27:27] for the first time
[1:27:30] and as humans we say well that that is
[1:27:33] so gross
[1:27:38] so horrible what he went through for you
[1:27:41] and me
[1:27:45] when they would beat him
[1:27:48] and he would cry out
[1:27:51] is that all you see
[1:27:54] because if this quote that I just read
[1:27:58] is the truth is
[1:28:02] when he cried out
[1:28:04] I can see myself crying
[1:28:08] because I I was in him
[1:28:11] in the genes of his word
[1:28:14] oh yes the spirit had left him
[1:28:18] but I was hit him there
[1:28:21] he was making me pay for my sin and him
[1:28:30] that's that's incredible
[1:28:32] when you see the blood come off of his
[1:28:35] body
[1:28:37] and each drop of blood
[1:28:41] you see the ground already
[1:28:51] represents your portion of the Holy
[1:28:54] Ghost
[1:28:56] and one of those drops of blood is
[1:29:02] you gotta put your name
[1:29:07] because
[1:29:08] the life came out of that blood
[1:29:12] that's what we can do for that day on
[1:29:15] Calvary
[1:29:18] yourself in the sacrifice
[1:29:54] the life of that blood
[1:29:58] flows to somebody to heal somebody
[1:30:03] that's why when I go to Uganda
[1:30:06] people say man you must have transformed
[1:30:09] Powers
[1:30:11] the younger guys
[1:30:18] do you know there's a little compartment
[1:30:19] in the human heart says
[1:30:24] or there's not one sale
[1:30:29] and brother Branham calls it the
[1:30:31] dwelling place of the Soul
[1:30:46] he said why have there's a great Center
[1:30:49] of power in the universe
[1:30:53] which if we could have contact with that
[1:30:56] Center of Power
[1:30:57] contact
[1:30:59] we could create worlds
[1:31:02] and not just create worlds but then we
[1:31:06] could go and live in the world that will
[1:31:08] be created
[1:31:11] and that's exactly what we're doing in
[1:31:14] Uganda yes
[1:31:16] that's what inspires me
[1:31:18] universo
[1:31:26] when that great Center of power
[1:31:30] is in that little room
[1:31:34] that's in your heart
[1:31:36] where from there God can generate life
[1:31:41] that is
[1:31:49] thrown in Jesus Christ
[1:31:52] but now his throne is the human heart
[1:31:57] that's what we can do for that day on
[1:32:00] Calaveras
[1:32:02] amen amen

[1:38:46] resurrection
[1:38:49] we've been privileged by God
[1:38:53] to read the pages of the Sacred
[1:38:55] Scriptures
[1:38:58] we've been privileged by God
[1:39:01] to hear the words of our beloved Prophet
[1:39:06] we've been privileged by God
[1:39:09] be founded in this church
[1:39:14] under the uh under the doctrine of
[1:39:17] Apostles and Prophets
[1:39:20] where is Levi God bless
[1:39:26] we're been privileged by God
[1:39:29] to be able to continue the vision
[1:39:34] that our founder left us
[1:39:38] he didn't leave us a dead letter
[1:39:42] he left us a little been a living
[1:39:45] breathing word
[1:39:48] and that's the reason that we are here
[1:39:51] today
[1:39:53] I was telling brother Caleb Leicester I
[1:39:57] have never been so tired after a trip
[1:39:59] like this trip
[1:40:02] but at the same time satisfied with what
[1:40:05] God has done
[1:40:08] the word of God tells us in the Book of
[1:40:11] Psalms
[1:40:13] chapter 105.
[1:40:17] and verse verse 19
[1:40:21] until the time that his word came
[1:40:27] the word of the Lord tried him
[1:40:31] I want to say it again
[1:40:34] until the time that his word came
[1:40:39] and every one of us has a portion of the
[1:40:42] word
[1:40:43] foreign
[1:41:45] and all the word of God is being made
[1:41:48] manifested today
[1:41:51] I believe that each and every one of us
[1:41:56] has a particular part to play
[1:42:00] particular in this great drama of God
[1:42:06] we ourselves Nosotros mismos have been
[1:42:09] given the great responsibility
[1:42:12] responsibility and that is to close out
[1:42:15] the age
[1:42:17] this is the last day
[1:42:20] this is the last people
[1:42:22] well we'll be alive before the coming of
[1:42:25] the lord
[1:42:27] we are alive and remains
[1:42:31] shall not hinder those that have gone
[1:42:34] before us
[1:42:36] himself
[1:42:38] descend from heaven
[1:43:22] he's the great star
[1:43:37] five stars came out
[1:43:43] we see one of them right here with us
[1:43:45] tonight
[1:43:47] one of them is
[1:43:59] [Music]
[1:44:01] foreign
[1:44:51] can I tell you what somebody said
[1:44:54] in the Book of Joel
[1:44:57] he said it shall come to pass in that
[1:45:00] last days
[1:45:03] for my spirit upon All Flesh
[1:45:08] when Peter gets it
[1:45:12] he receives the Revelation
[1:45:15] in Peter's time
[1:45:18] it was not the last day
[1:45:22] but it keeps the world
[1:45:31] when he says this particular word
[1:45:35] in particular this particular phrase is
[1:45:41] esto is that is
[1:45:45] oh yeah
[1:45:47] we will just serve God a little bit
[1:45:54] unless we know what our word is
[1:45:58] it is not a different word
[1:46:03] that it's a lot to you
[1:46:07] so when Peter gets it
[1:46:11] he says this is that and this is which
[1:46:15] was spoken from The
[1:46:18] Prophet's Prophet I believe every word
[1:46:20] that you're the pranam said
[1:46:23] but I also believe
[1:46:27] there will be a bride
[1:46:29] who is that word
[1:46:34] palabra
[1:46:37] who's that word
[1:46:43] are you with me church
[1:46:47] this is the word in actions
[1:46:53] of the prophecy of brother Brands
[1:46:57] brother Branham says
[1:47:00] maybe then the last time
[1:47:04] the last one to come in
[1:47:07] will be a black sheep
[1:47:12] where then do we go
[1:47:15] where there's black sheep has negras
[1:47:24] we can either get on the
[1:47:27] prophecya we can read the scriptures
[1:47:31] and think about tomorrow
[1:47:35] or bring the prophecy to pass
[1:47:41] [Music]
[1:47:47] right
[1:47:51] she wasn't in the she wasn't in the in
[1:47:54] the in the vision
[1:48:00] but she pulls the vision
[1:48:04] and forces the vision for her time
[1:48:12] the prophet of God speaks about three
[1:48:14] pools
[1:48:18] soon
[1:48:36] I gotta read this just one second
[1:48:37] Segundo
[1:48:40] got Emmanuel dios Emmanuel creating
[1:48:44] around himself
[1:48:47] a blood cells that brought forth the sun
[1:48:53] Jesus Christ when he was born here on
[1:48:57] Earth
[1:48:58] he lived and was made fun of Isle
[1:49:04] and they're in the pocket of the heart
[1:49:08] a cruel Roman Spirit
[1:49:12] opened it up
[1:49:15] and broke that blood cells
[1:49:19] no more house
[1:49:23] what does the blood cell do
[1:49:27] it releases a
[1:49:29] now
[1:49:32] aura
[1:49:34] sometimes people says is that would that
[1:49:39] be your church
[1:49:41] no that's no that's Jesus's church
[1:49:45] I'm just proud to be part of his church
[1:49:50] would that be your ministry
[1:49:54] no no I'm just proud to be part of that
[1:49:58] Ministries
[1:50:03] no no I'm just part proud to believe all
[1:50:10] that the prophet has spoken
[1:50:13] again
[1:50:18] in itself and see Miss has the creative
[1:50:21] power
[1:50:23] to bring you to the vision
[1:50:26] and make it to come to pass
[1:50:30] what does that day then mean for us is
[1:51:01] he has already glorified glorificado
[1:51:05] what in turn do them do we do and don't
[1:51:08] say the prophet of God says this
[1:51:12] now the first thing I want to say is
[1:51:17] Jesus never lived for himself Jesus
[1:51:22] I see men like my papa
[1:51:25] I see men like brother fabulous
[1:51:28] I see men like my our pastors
[1:51:32] I want to tell you
[1:51:40] El Mundo
[1:51:47] now now you got to feel that way about
[1:51:50] your passport
[1:51:52] it's like if you say I got the best wife
[1:51:55] in the whole world
[1:51:58] you shouldn't you shouldn't feel feel uh
[1:52:01] placed to the side
[1:52:04] you should say I'm not the best wife in
[1:52:07] the world
[1:52:08] I'm not the best husband in the world
[1:52:11] what have I learned from these men
[1:52:15] they've never lived for themselves
[1:52:22] never live for themselves
[1:52:25] his life was spent for others
[1:52:31] that's perfectly eternal life
[1:52:35] we can go and say I do great things
[1:52:40] you still haven't got eternal life
[1:52:49] brother all these precious brothers that
[1:52:51] went
[1:52:53] but I saw brother Mark in the plane
[1:52:56] and I wish I would have taken the
[1:52:59] picture

[1:53:41] around you

[1:53:52] and I saw brother Mark
[1:53:56] take the man's feet
[1:54:05] and start massaging the Man's legs
[1:54:12] who would do those things
[1:54:16] a man that does not live for himself
[1:54:21] who would go to the regions that nobody
[1:54:24] else would go do
[1:54:27] a man that does not live for himself
[1:54:32] it's easy to say I love you Brothers
