[10:12] in this series of episodes
[10:16] i would like to relate to you
[10:20] the things that i saw the things that i
[10:24] heard and the things which i experienced
[10:27] the purpose of these episodes
[10:31] is to acquaint you with
[10:34] the supernatural that's very essential
[10:39] to acquaint you with the supernatural
[10:42] which god did in and through the
[10:45] ministry of william branham
[10:48] and how god continues
[10:52] that's what's very significant how god
[10:55] continues
[10:57] to produce the supernatural through the
[11:00] ministry
[11:02] even to this present time proving
[11:05] that jesus christ is the same
[11:09] yesterday today
[11:12] and forever and that's the key
[11:16] believing that this jesus christ
[11:20] who spoke and who was recorded in the in
[11:23] the bible
[11:24] and that jesus of the old testament
[11:29] or god of the old testament is jesus of
[11:31] the new
[11:33] and we have the holy spirit today it's
[11:36] the same god
[11:38] in all of those events
[11:42] and it shall come to pass the scripture
[11:45] says if they will not believe thee god
[11:48] speaking to moses
[11:51] neither hearken to the voice of the
[11:53] first sign that they will believe the
[11:57] voice
[11:58] of the latter sign and if the
[12:01] supernatural
[12:02] doesn't have a voice that follows it a
[12:05] voice that reveals
[12:07] jesus christ to the people
[12:10] [Music]
[12:11] but ye shall see me who the believers
[12:14] for i'll be with you even
[12:16] in you to the end of the world is that
[12:19] true
[12:21] that is sin to disbelieve strictly
[12:23] stranger to me
[12:26] you're from away from here you come from
[12:28] another city
[12:31] you've got a lot of trouble on your
[12:32] heart you got hard trouble to begin with
[12:36] is that right there's a whole lot of
[12:38] blackness i see a black sheep keep
[12:40] following you like that
[12:41] oh it's alive somebody stole the line
[12:44] and that was a man was professing divine
[12:46] healing
[12:48] he said you as a witch is that true
[12:51] and if you've got a whole stir in your
[12:53] church or something about it in that
[12:54] right
[12:54] your pastor's sick right now you got
[12:56] polio is that right
[12:58] sister don't pay attention what them
[13:00] people tell you
[13:01] they're alive and the only thing's wrong
[13:03] with your heart that nervous condition
[13:05] got your heart worked up
[13:06] gone home in peace and god bless you
[13:08] you're all god that has created the
[13:10] heavens and earth
[13:11] i ask now that every demon power in this
[13:14] building will be broke
[13:15] the power of jesus christ be made
[13:18] manifest
[13:19] lord we but we're not defeated
[13:22] satan observe thee in the name of the
[13:25] lord jesus christ
[13:27] come out of the people stand up you
[13:29] crippled people out of the wheelchairs
[13:31] giving praise
[13:36] in psalms god spoke through david and he
[13:39] said lo
[13:41] he doth send his voice and that a
[13:44] mighty voice jesus when he came
[13:49] and there was god in christ reconciling
[13:52] the world to himself
[13:53] jesus said my sheep
[13:56] hear my voice and i know
[14:00] them and they follow me
[14:04] that just couldn't be clearer my sheep
[14:07] know my voice i know
[14:10] them and they follow me
[14:14] and then speaking of the voice that
[14:17] would come in this last time but in the
[14:19] days
[14:20] of the voice of the seventh angel
[14:24] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[14:27] of god
[14:29] should be finished as he hath declared
[14:32] it to his servants of prophets
[14:34] we say what is this mystery it is so
[14:37] that the voice
[14:38] will be in the bride so the prophet of
[14:42] god has said
[14:43] god raised up others
[14:47] and so it has gone on through the years
[14:50] until this last day there
[14:54] is again another people in the land
[14:58] who under their messenger will be the
[15:01] final voice
[15:03] to the final age
[15:06] and we can quote the words of jesus when
[15:09] he said
[15:12] it is not you that speak
[15:16] but the spirit of your father which
[15:19] speaketh in you
[15:21] and if all believers of this message
[15:25] would take those words
[15:28] that i've just spoken concerning it's
[15:30] always been the voice
[15:32] revealing the almighty god
[15:36] to us and to realize
[15:40] it's not just something that we heard
[15:42] and we received
[15:43] this is what has connected the same
[15:47] bible
[15:48] i don't read another bible but the same
[15:50] bible
[15:51] has just become alive and the opening of
[15:55] the word
[15:57] the opening of the scriptures
[16:00] things that we could not see or
[16:02] understand have become
[16:04] so clear and this is our great ambition
[16:08] to make this known and furthermore i
[16:11] would like to advise
[16:12] anyone regardless of what you have heard
[16:17] er regardless of what you've heard
[16:20] positive or negative
[16:22] i can tell you that i would
[16:26] recommend to you to do the same thing
[16:29] that i did
[16:30] if the angel of the lord was at the
[16:33] platform and i am a witness of these
[16:35] things
[16:36] i was there i saw it on the platform
[16:40] i saw it as the prophet of god spoke to
[16:43] the people
[16:45] and i knew the people some of them were
[16:47] from my church
[16:49] and i knew that the angel of the lord
[16:52] would not
[16:53] use a human vessel to speak
[16:57] things that were not true it had to be
[16:59] absolutely true
[17:01] and god is a god of truth and it speaks
[17:04] of jesus christ
[17:05] he was full of truth and grace and i can
[17:09] say that
[17:09] in the revealing of himself it was
[17:13] absolutely true until you have somebody
[17:17] that can stand in the public year after
[17:20] year after year for many years and
[17:24] reveal the secret of the heart only god
[17:27] can do that
[17:29] tell where the people were tell them
[17:30] where they were standing
[17:32] tell them what they're suffering with
[17:35] tell them whether they'll live or
[17:36] they'll die
[17:37] i mean that kind of a that kind of a
[17:41] voice is the voice that i want to hear
[17:44] and follow and that's the voice that a
[17:47] person will
[17:49] hear long after this life is over
[17:54] that's the voice that's the voice of
[17:56] almighty god
[17:58] and i can tell you that that is what i
[18:00] experienced
[18:04] and it is true
[18:14] [Music]
[19:01] [Music]
[19:29] [Music]
[19:34] one day my father he was about 18 at the
[19:37] time
[19:39] and he was plowing a field
[19:42] in saskatchewan
[19:46] he was plowing behind the horses and the
[19:49] furrow
[19:50] he was walking in the fresh furrow and
[19:53] he doesn't know what happened but it was
[19:55] he said it was like a wind i would say
[19:59] like a force like i experienced
[20:03] within brother branham's ministry but
[20:05] this force
[20:07] struck him and he fell to his knees
[20:11] and in the fresh furrow and he
[20:14] threw up his hands to god
[20:17] and he prayed and he cried out he said
[20:21] oh god if there is a god
[20:24] now he's an older boy in the church but
[20:27] he cried out
[20:28] oh god if there is a god if you ever
[20:31] show me how i can be free from my guilt
[20:35] my sin i'll accept you that very day
[20:38] [Music]
[20:41] my father farmed for a short time near
[20:44] his father's farm and
[20:46] it wasn't working out he didn't feel cut
[20:49] out to farm
[20:51] so they moved he and his young wife
[20:54] and young family i was only about two
[20:57] years old
[20:58] and they moved up to a small village
[21:03] only about 150 people i think
[21:06] a village called white fox saskatchewan
[21:10] and it was there i'll just make this
[21:14] a little more brief but it was there
[21:18] that my father encountered a family with
[21:21] two
[21:22] daughters with two girls he had seen
[21:24] these girls walk across the street
[21:28] a little gravel street in the town
[21:32] and he saw on their faces they looked
[21:35] just like
[21:36] angels he thought oh my if i could only
[21:38] have what they have
[21:40] so there was a craving in his heart for
[21:43] reality for deliverance from
[21:46] sin and unbelief and so on
[21:49] and he wanted something more than
[21:51] religion of course
[21:54] a lady in the town heard that he could
[21:56] do
[21:57] some carpenter work so
[22:00] she would needed some shelving or
[22:03] cupboards in her kitchen and had him
[22:06] come over
[22:07] and look at what she wanted done
[22:12] when he was in the house he noticed
[22:14] there's the two girls
[22:17] and as he was getting ready to go
[22:21] the lady asked him if he had ever been
[22:24] saved and he said well i don't know what
[22:27] that means
[22:28] she said that means you can be free from
[22:31] your sin
[22:33] oh he said if i could only be free from
[22:35] my sin
[22:37] she said well we are having meetings in
[22:39] a home
[22:40] on sunday if you'd care to come and she
[22:44] and he said i had promised god years ago
[22:49] if i ever could be free from my guilt
[22:52] i would accept it that very day and as i
[22:55] understand the account she just
[22:58] they knelt at two chairs in that kitchen
[23:01] of that home where those two girls were
[23:04] and my father was he got up a
[23:07] totally transformed person
[23:10] he lived for christ all of his life
[23:14] and he had a matter of fact it was
[23:18] then my mother passed away
[23:21] suddenly when i was only six and a half
[23:25] years old i was in grade two at school
[23:28] and a very godly man
[23:32] i think he was probably an old farmer
[23:34] but he was a very godly man
[23:36] and i was called out of the room and my
[23:39] sister was standing with him
[23:42] and he said that jesus had
[23:46] taken my mother to heaven and this was
[23:51] this was the beginning and the end of
[23:52] many things it was
[23:54] it's a very very difficult and very sad
[23:57] story
[23:58] my sister and i we
[24:01] went through from one housekeeper to
[24:03] another to another about four
[24:05] different housekeepers and we had
[24:09] time we were alone and my father was
[24:12] working in an alfalfa plant cleaning
[24:16] the bags and so on and we would try to
[24:19] make
[24:20] something to eat and go up there and
[24:23] then
[24:23] my father heard of a lot of work that
[24:26] was taking place in dawson creek and the
[24:29] building of the alaskan highway
[24:31] just prior to that my father had
[24:33] remarried
[24:35] a very fine christian woman but she was
[24:39] completely opposite of what my mother my
[24:41] mother was a very
[24:44] a very loving mother
[24:47] and not that this one wasn't but we
[24:51] weren't her children
[24:53] and she was very quiet my mother was
[24:55] outgoing and
[24:57] very you know uh
[25:00] just very outgoing and this woman was
[25:04] anna leland was her name and she was
[25:07] just a very
[25:08] quiet woman so anyhow
[25:11] our life was completely rearranged
[25:15] and my father went over about a thousand
[25:18] miles
[25:20] west to dawson creek and up the alaskan
[25:23] highway
[25:24] he was there were camps built all over
[25:27] the highway
[25:28] and you have to understand that the
[25:31] alaskan highway
[25:32] was a war project the japanese were
[25:36] invading up the aleutian islands
[25:39] had already taken over two of the
[25:41] islands
[25:42] and there's even i understand there's
[25:45] documentaries
[25:47] where the japanese had taken atu
[25:51] attu atu island
[25:55] and that was the thrust if they took
[25:58] alaska and then northern canada was
[26:02] really not defended
[26:05] and then if they got down to the 48
[26:07] states
[26:09] it would it would uh a risk
[26:12] japan was fighting and they had seized
[26:16] much of
[26:17] asia and now into china as well
[26:22] singapore and hong kong they'd taken all
[26:26] of that
[26:27] and now if they took they were a
[26:30] powerful force
[26:32] and if they came down
[26:36] to the 48 states of mainland america
[26:40] so canada and the united states
[26:43] joined together and the u.s
[26:47] built the highway and canada agreed
[26:50] to maintain it forever and then there
[26:53] would be a land route
[26:54] to get heavy equipment tanks and war
[26:57] equipment
[26:58] into alaska to defend it that's the
[27:01] purpose
[27:02] of the alaskan highway and there were
[27:04] tens of thousands
[27:07] of people and contractors and civilians
[27:11] that were involved in that and so my
[27:14] father
[27:14] moved up there and he was at mile 458.
[27:20] he wrote back and communicated with my
[27:23] stepmother
[27:24] to pack everything up and to come out
[27:27] and we arrived in dawson creek
[27:30] at the end of may i won't say perhaps
[27:34] the first of may because my sister
[27:36] whose birthday is may the sixth
[27:39] she had her birthday on the train coming
[27:42] from edmonton
[27:44] to into dawson creek and while we were
[27:47] there
[27:48] uh this has all happened in you know
[27:51] after my mother passed away
[27:53] everything is just in a turmoil
[27:54] everything fell apart
[27:56] and then i found myself
[28:00] i was sent out to a farm 45 miles out of
[28:03] town
[28:04] across the mighty peace river or with a
[28:08] tug boat and a little ferry
[28:10] and to people that i didn't know
[28:14] and my the last string i had on earth
[28:16] was my sister
[28:18] and she was she was taken to a place
[28:22] uh and because the pastor's wife had
[28:25] been arranged to find a place for the
[28:27] two children
[28:28] and my mother already had work up the
[28:30] alaskan highway
[28:32] so i didn't have a mother
[28:36] i didn't have a stepmother i didn't have
[28:39] a sister
[28:41] and one is sent one place one and sent
[28:43] another place
[28:44] and i was shifted i never had a home
[28:48] all my all my youth and growing up years
[28:51] i never had my own room
[28:53] never had my own bed and i moved 17
[28:57] times from then
[29:00] until the time i was 15.
[29:02] [Music]
[29:03] so it was a it's a difficult time of my
[29:08] life
[29:08] but i've been asked
[29:12] what prepared you for the mission work
[29:16] and for this gospel
[29:19] it was those years i
[29:22] learned what the wilderness was
[29:26] little did i realize that years later i
[29:28] would have
[29:29] god's prophet up there and he
[29:32] loved that area
[29:35] and it was wilderness and that's all i
[29:38] knew
[29:39] really so
[29:42] uh my father then
[29:46] in 1949 he felt
[29:50] to move to southern british columbia
[29:53] and on the way down he would stop
[29:57] because he would had such a
[30:00] experience with god and was interested
[30:04] in anything that god was doing
[30:06] in fact is he stopped in the meetings
[30:09] and
[30:09] he had heard that william branham was
[30:11] going to be
[30:12] in vernon british columbia and that is
[30:15] where my contact
[30:17] began with him uh
[30:20] in fact is i have a letter i should
[30:23] perhaps just read this letter
[30:29] on just a portion of this is my father's
[30:32] account
[30:33] of the meetings in vernon we found this
[30:38] i think after my father passed away in
[30:40] his things
[30:42] and he's writing a minister and he's
[30:45] writing about the news of our beloved
[30:47] brother
[30:48] branham passing away
[30:51] he said came as a with a shocking
[30:54] surprise
[30:55] to me the loss of him cannot be
[30:58] estimated in words
[31:01] now he is resting in peace but his work
[31:04] is going on
[31:06] and his memory is cherished in the
[31:09] hearts of
[31:10] thousands in the world but he was
[31:13] writing about the
[31:14] meeting in vernon british columbia that
[31:18] was my first time
[31:21] finally he said brother branham looked
[31:25] at a poorly clad mother with a crippled
[31:28] child in her
[31:29] arms he asked that the
[31:32] way be made for this poor mother
[31:36] to come forward never had i
[31:39] ever seen such a bundle of twisted bones
[31:44] thought this was a totally impossible
[31:47] case
[31:49] brother branham took the child in his
[31:51] arms
[31:53] and lifted it up for the people to see
[31:56] it
[31:57] there were tears and moans and sobs
[32:01] heard all around the place
[32:04] then he said people do you see how the
[32:07] demons
[32:08] have twisted the whole body of this
[32:11] child
[32:12] and are holding it bound i will not let
[32:15] this child go
[32:17] until all these demons are cast out
[32:21] and the child is perfectly whole with
[32:24] great authority he commanded the demons
[32:27] to come
[32:28] to come out of out in jesus name
[32:32] after several commands the demons came
[32:36] out
[32:37] and before the eyes of that great crowd
[32:41] the bones were made straight
[32:44] his arms legs neck
[32:48] and back all became straight
[32:51] and the child lifted himself up with a
[32:54] smile on its face
[32:56] you should have heard the
[33:00] the arena or the arena ring
[33:03] with their praises of thousands as they
[33:06] saw the
[33:08] mighty miracles of god done in the name
[33:11] of
[33:11] jesus christ praise god forever
[33:16] now that's my father's unsolicited
[33:20] but he did not know what was happening
[33:22] to me
[33:24] i was just with a series of young
[33:26] fellows
[33:29] that's where i first met billy paul in
[33:31] fact
[33:32] and we were in our teens and
[33:37] i was i was caught by this
[33:41] [Music]
[33:42] that brother branham was a man that had
[33:45] talked to an angel
[33:46] and an angel had come to him and told
[33:49] him he would take a ministry of healing
[33:52] now i was familiar with sunday school
[33:56] with church i knew the bible spoke of
[33:59] angels i had
[34:00] never ever laid eyes on a person
[34:04] who had talked to god in that way
[34:07] talk to an angel of god
[34:11] and so i was anxious to see him come out
[34:13] and he came out
[34:15] said good evening people good evening
[34:18] friends
[34:19] and he began to speak and after
[34:22] two or three days i felt i've got to get
[34:26] down where i can see this
[34:28] i'm i'm i had no interest in being up in
[34:30] the
[34:31] high in the bleachers anymore i didn't
[34:33] have any more
[34:34] interest in just being with the fellas
[34:37] and i got a seat i don't know how to
[34:41] this day
[34:42] i got a seat right on the aisle one
[34:45] chair just close two or three rolls from
[34:49] the front
[34:50] and in that service i can't tell you
[34:53] what was spoken
[34:55] i can't tell you of anyone else
[35:00] but there was a girl and i would say the
[35:03] girl
[35:03] was probably around
[35:06] 10 to 12 years old she had
[35:10] ringlets down to her shoulders
[35:13] and kind of a full face girl
[35:17] but her eyes were just white balls
[35:21] and i noticed right up i was that close
[35:25] to the platform
[35:27] i i just right in the corner of the eye
[35:30] i see just a little a
[35:33] part a little part of the ball
[35:36] the ball of the eye the edge of the eye
[35:40] and the other eye i could see nothing
[35:44] just white and i was
[35:48] as far as i was concerned and and she
[35:51] was totally blind
[35:54] brother branham laid his hands on her
[35:57] and he prayed a prayer and i thought
[35:59] in my young heart i thought well i've
[36:02] heard about
[36:02] you know these things now now here's
[36:06] something i can actually see
[36:09] i can see this and i was anxious to see
[36:12] someone healed because i had had so many
[36:16] experiences in churches and so on
[36:19] where people were prayed for for
[36:22] internal
[36:23] sicknesses and you're healed but now
[36:27] there's something i could see
[36:29] visibly and brother branham prayed the
[36:33] second time and
[36:34] she was the same and he prayed the third
[36:36] time fourth
[36:37] time fifth time and he keep looking at
[36:40] her
[36:41] and she was the same brother branham
[36:44] prayed six times and
[36:46] he did something i have never and prayed
[36:49] a prayer i've never heard before
[36:52] and he he took and put his arms around
[36:54] her
[36:55] like that and just kind of held her to
[36:58] his bosom
[37:00] and he said satan
[37:03] an angel from god
[37:06] had delivered this gift to me and told
[37:10] me that nothing would stand before my
[37:12] prayers not even cancer
[37:14] if i could get the people to believe he
[37:17] said the people are here
[37:20] and they believe and i
[37:24] charge you in the name of the living god
[37:27] to lose her and let her go and that time
[37:30] he did not look at her anymore
[37:33] he just turned her took her by the
[37:34] shoulders and turned her to the audience
[37:37] and i was just two
[37:40] three rows away i i think i was in the
[37:43] third row
[37:44] and i looked up and her eyes were as
[37:46] straight as mine
[37:47] and then he lifted her up like this
[37:51] and the cries of the people i didn't
[37:54] know that my
[37:55] mother and dad or my stepmother and dad
[37:57] were in there
[37:58] where they were in the building but that
[38:01] was my experience
[38:03] this was my father's experience and
[38:07] and i i could even see the tears form in
[38:10] her eyes as she looked at the bright
[38:12] lights
[38:14] she wasn't accustomed to the bright
[38:16] lights and she's looking at the bright
[38:18] lights and
[38:20] then he put her down and
[38:23] that anchored in my heart at 14 years
[38:30] old
[38:40] [Applause]
[39:02] [Music]
[39:15] [Music]
[39:28] [Applause]
[39:29] [Music]
[39:46] [Music]
[40:12] [Music]
[40:19] there was a time of my life i was
[40:21] separated from everything
[40:24] including the young lady that i thought
[40:26] i might marry
[40:28] i didn't know but i was god
[40:31] it was about eight months long
[40:34] and during that eight months i had a
[40:36] very very unusual
[40:41] walk with god i guess i would say
[40:44] very unusual i had a room
[40:50] and i worked in a store right below
[40:54] and the hudson's bay had bought out my
[40:57] father-in-law
[40:59] uh he became my father-in-law but he was
[41:02] just the owner and uh
[41:06] i i was working in the
[41:11] i was manager of the produce department
[41:16] and when when noon time came
[41:19] i would go up to my room and give the
[41:21] first half hour
[41:23] of my lunch time in prayer
[41:27] and it was just something very special
[41:30] it isn't something that i
[41:32] advise others or admonish them it was
[41:34] just something that
[41:35] i just did i i longed for it i craved
[41:38] for it
[41:39] i even you know would pinch in the
[41:42] moment so i could be longer there
[41:46] and i would slide out the other chair
[41:48] for the lord jesus to sit on
[41:50] and be there and uh when
[41:54] when the work was over i would sometimes
[41:56] go out and walk in the
[41:58] woods or walking around the creek and
[42:01] just look
[42:02] at the flowers or something and just be
[42:04] overwhelmed at the beauty of it and
[42:07] weep and so that was the kind of
[42:10] experience we had
[42:11] and then god was moving in such a way
[42:15] that
[42:16] denominations was nothing it was the
[42:19] people
[42:20] you know if there was a hunger and a
[42:22] desire for god
[42:24] and we under we heard that there was a
[42:26] meeting or i had heard that there was a
[42:28] meeting taking place
[42:30] in northern alberta and it was about 300
[42:35] 350 miles from where we were
[42:39] and i waited until when work was over
[42:43] on friday and then i took off on my
[42:46] motorcycle
[42:47] that was the only truck only
[42:49] transportation i had
[42:52] and it was cold and i was suffering
[42:56] from hypothermia i didn't know it but i
[43:00] was
[43:02] and i went
[43:06] till about two o'clock in the morning
[43:10] and then i would see a farm light
[43:12] flicker
[43:13] you know way in the distance and i
[43:15] thought oh my goodness
[43:17] i've always was so bashful to
[43:20] do that and then there was one right
[43:22] beside the road a little log house and
[43:24] so i pulled in there real quick it was
[43:27] in the middle of the night
[43:29] and the light was on and i leaned my
[43:32] bike up against the log house
[43:35] and i tapped on the door and i just
[43:38] heard some
[43:38] voice inside come on in so i opened the
[43:41] door and there was a guy with his feet
[43:43] up on a table reading a book
[43:46] and so i said well i said i'm just
[43:49] pulling up and i was very cold and was
[43:52] almost freezing to death and oh he said
[43:54] yeah
[43:55] i said i thought maybe i could bunk here
[43:56] for the night yeah
[43:58] he said you can have a room here and he
[44:01] was a bachelor
[44:02] made a big breakfast in the morning and
[44:05] then i set off the next day and then it
[44:07] snowed that
[44:08] night and so
[44:11] in the afternoon then the sun was coming
[44:13] out and people were splashing you know
[44:16] spraying me with
[44:17] [Music]
[44:18] wet snow and water and so on
[44:21] but i did that to get to a meeting
[44:26] and it was in that meeting that
[44:29] you know god confirmed that
[44:33] god had given me
[44:36] the young woman who was my wife to be my
[44:39] wife
[44:40] and i was feeling a call
[44:44] i guess and i can't identify what the
[44:48] call was
[44:51] i think it evolved into
[44:53] [Music]
[44:55] you know when i began to
[44:59] speak to my wife
[45:03] and we were actually riding in a car and
[45:06] then i'll go back
[45:07] and i said well i wanted her to know
[45:10] i would not be able to give her the kind
[45:13] of life
[45:14] that she knew and that she's experienced
[45:17] and that she's had
[45:19] with her father being a businessman and
[45:21] being in business and so on
[45:23] i said i can't give you that kind of
[45:25] life
[45:26] i said i've been called to preach and
[45:29] that's probably the first time i said
[45:31] that to her
[45:32] i've been called to preach so i think
[45:35] that
[45:36] now in retrospect i was i was feeling
[45:39] that
[45:40] pull i i i didn't you know we didn't
[45:43] have the example of someone behind the
[45:46] pulpit
[45:46] and someone preaching but it was just
[45:50] a deep hunger
[45:54] for greater things of god
[45:57] and the life that god had for you know
[46:00] what there was
[46:02] you know available and
[46:07] so i was actually frustrated on the bed
[46:10] [Music]
[46:12] and i was in great sobs
[46:15] uh you know just exposing my soul to god
[46:18] and i didn't know what to do i remember
[46:22] taking off my watch and i put it on the
[46:26] bed and i took my billfold out
[46:28] and i put those on the bed and i just
[46:32] surrendered it to god i said my time
[46:36] and what he put in my hands
[46:40] was going to be his
[46:45] and i can't i can't describe
[46:48] any special
[46:53] extended thing from that but
[46:56] i think god sees that and then he just
[46:58] sets your life in a certain course and
[47:01] allows certain things to happen and
[47:04] and he knows that blessings
[47:07] are not going to upset you
[47:10] or they're not going to drive you in a
[47:13] wrong direction
[47:15] you you handle that you and then you you
[47:19] become
[47:20] a trustworthy
[47:24] steward of the things of the kingdom of
[47:28] god god has to have people
[47:30] that can handle funds can handle
[47:33] business
[47:35] the gospel itself is not
[47:39] it's not something that is
[47:43] conducted on you know god can take
[47:46] little money and he can take much
[47:50] so yeah i just it was something i
[47:53] experienced
[47:54] that was before we were married
[48:08] [Applause]
[48:14] [Music]
[48:30] [Music]
[49:14] [Music]
[49:42] [Music]
[49:46] i was pastoring
[49:50] been pastoring three and a half years
[49:52] and i was
[49:54] kind of filled with i won't say
[49:57] disillusionment but
[49:58] it was we didn't know
[50:02] you know i had good friends that were
[50:03] trinitarians and good friends which were
[50:06] jesus only and
[50:08] we didn't seem to put a lot of
[50:09] importance to it because no one could
[50:11] answer it
[50:13] and then i had heard that you know
[50:16] brother branham was
[50:17] now speaking some things and i had huge
[50:20] huge questions about it
[50:24] but one day just
[50:27] one day one meeting
[50:30] i happened to have my friend bud
[50:31] southwick and he always stayed in our
[50:34] house in dawson creek
[50:37] and a.w rasmussen who used to pastor in
[50:40] edmonton
[50:41] and then he pastored into coma
[50:44] and he was a very very dear friend
[50:47] of brother
[50:51] from chicago
[50:55] and that whole community was a very
[50:58] close community
[51:02] and so he said to me he was in my home
[51:05] that one
[51:05] time just once and brother rasmussen
[51:09] said brother eddie
[51:10] why don't you write brother branham and
[51:14] invite him to go on a hunt he said you
[51:17] know perhaps then you could have some
[51:18] meetings as well
[51:20] he said he loves to hunt you know and so
[51:24] that was just enough to nudge me forward
[51:27] and i wrote brother branham
[51:28] i remember writing him a letter and
[51:31] while i wrote the letter
[51:33] my mind was telling me you'll never hear
[51:36] from him
[51:37] he probably gets a hundred thousand
[51:38] letters a month
[51:40] and i thought well this is
[51:43] this just doesn't make sense anyway
[51:47] i wrote and i posted the letter in
[51:50] dawson creek
[51:51] and right after that i had resigned the
[51:54] church
[51:55] and came down here to the west coast of
[51:59] british columbia about
[52:00] 800 miles south and
[52:03] started to minister to the native indian
[52:05] people
[52:08] and about three weeks later i got a
[52:11] phone call a letter
[52:14] from brother branham saying that he'd
[52:16] like to
[52:18] go on a hunt and perhaps we could have
[52:20] some meetings in grand prairie
[52:22] and dawson creek thus that tied those
[52:24] meetings and we arranged those meetings
[52:27] and and i had all these questions
[52:32] about the ministry about the absolute
[52:37] as or is there some
[52:40] definitive absolute on the godhead and
[52:44] on the baptism
[52:46] and oh my how the word opened up then
[52:50] and i uh so
[52:53] that's why when i was on the platform
[52:56] and i say to you i was there
[53:01] and i found that what he spoke was the
[53:03] truth
[53:05] but yet my heart had some
[53:08] big questions in it but i see the
[53:12] soldier boy
[53:14] has called out and set the clone disk
[53:17] people
[53:17] from my church are called out
[53:21] and he relates exactly
[53:24] things that i know are taking
[53:28] place in their homes
[53:32] and here now i'm with him
[53:35] and driving up the alaskan highway to
[53:38] the hunting territory
[53:41] and this is where everything changed
[53:45] because i was one day i i
[53:49] actually went on the hunting trip to
[53:52] keep the cost down i was doing the
[53:54] cooking
[53:57] and uh so one one of the
[54:01] evenings brother branham just said
[54:04] i think i'll just go out and maybe get a
[54:07] rabbit or something for camp meat
[54:10] and he said would you like to come
[54:11] brother eddie i said yes i would like to
[54:14] come
[54:15] and brother chris berg who was a dear
[54:18] friend of brother branham's
[54:20] he said yeah maybe i'll come too
[54:24] sure brother brown said why don't you
[54:26] come brother chris
[54:27] no he said i'm gonna stay and do the
[54:29] dishes
[54:30] he said you go brother eddie we were
[54:32] camping
[54:35] so we walk along brother brown and i on
[54:37] a path
[54:38] [Music]
[54:39] walk a short distance
[54:41] [Music]
[54:44] and i could see he wasn't really
[54:47] interested in it was a beautiful evening
[54:50] he wasn't interested in hunting i wasn't
[54:52] it
[54:52] at all interested and he walked over and
[54:57] a short distance and just sat on a big
[54:59] log
[55:00] and i sat right beside him and our knees
[55:03] were almost touching
[55:06] and so
[55:09] i i wanted to ask a question
[55:12] i have to listen very closely now
[55:17] i was curious why all this manifestation
[55:21] which was so powerful and so real
[55:24] and how the basic
[55:28] element of it could deteriorate
[55:31] and i just i couldn't understand it and
[55:34] that's why i was so disillusioned
[55:37] i thought something's wrong
[55:40] something's wrong so i said to brother
[55:43] branham
[55:44] i said how is it that people
[55:48] can prophesy they can
[55:51] speak in tongues they can interpret
[55:55] operate the gift of the spirit can
[55:58] preach and they become
[55:59] so anointed and i said i know what the
[56:01] anointing is
[56:04] and brother branham said have you heard
[56:07] my service
[56:09] on false anointed ones and i kind of
[56:13] dropped my head
[56:15] because i had not heard a lot of tapes
[56:19] and i said oh no i'm i haven't heard
[56:22] that
[56:23] you know what the strange thing was
[56:24] brother branham hadn't preached that for
[56:26] five years yet
[56:28] it was five years later that he would
[56:30] preach that service
[56:32] false anointed ones but he
[56:35] said to me he said
[56:39] now the wheat and the tares
[56:43] grow in the same field he said
[56:46] you tell me what the wheat rejoiced in
[56:50] and i'll tell you what the tares
[56:51] rejoiced in
[56:53] and i said yeah i still wasn't
[56:57] getting it he said
[57:00] in the last days peter said in the last
[57:02] days i'll pour my spirit upon
[57:05] all flesh
[57:08] and he asked me about
[57:12] all and i said all flesh
[57:15] he said a-l-l but he said not all flesh
[57:18] is saved
[57:19] [Music]
[57:20] i said yeah i was beginning to
[57:24] see that there was there was a point
[57:25] here that he was making
[57:28] yeah and then when he got to the wheat
[57:31] and the tares
[57:32] i begin to see and then he said you know
[57:36] like my sheep hear my voice
[57:39] not all my shape not all or my shape
[57:43] and i begin to see uh yeah there was
[57:47] something i really
[57:48] he said they're anointed
[57:52] they're genuinely anointed
[57:55] but the wrong seed and i begin to see
[57:59] that
[57:59] that's clearly taught in the scriptures
[58:03] i would like to say to the people who
[58:07] hear this i met the master
[58:11] i didn't meet just william branham him i
[58:14] knew
[58:15] but i met the master the god that he
[58:18] served
[58:20] and he said i was
[58:23] riding on my horse this afternoon
[58:26] behind brother bud and the sun was warm
[58:30] and i believe he said that you have
[58:32] three questions you want to ask me
[58:34] that's exactly the truth my heart was
[58:38] just
[58:38] completely exposed he said the first one
[58:42] is on the baptism and he took him in the
[58:45] order they were in my heart
[58:47] and the serpent seat i didn't even want
[58:49] to discuss
[58:50] but he said the first one is the baptism
[58:54] the second one is the godhead and the
[58:56] third one is the
[58:57] serpent's seed and i knew that
[59:01] if he avoided the scripture
[59:07] or you know just avoided that scripture
[59:11] i knew the word of god was the absolute
[59:14] but i didn't understand it
[59:16] and when he said the serpent's seat i
[59:17] said but brother branham
[59:20] i was so wound up i ra i raised my
[59:23] finger
[59:24] i'm not in his disrespect i just raised
[59:26] my finger i said but the scripture says
[59:30] and adam knew his wife
[59:33] and she conceived call his name cain
[59:37] for i've received a man from the lord he
[59:39] said course is from the lord
[59:42] all life comes from god it doesn't
[59:45] matter whether it's a right relationship
[59:47] or wrong relationship all life comes
[59:50] from god
[59:52] and i said yeah he said but you need to
[59:55] read the next verse
[59:57] i didn't know what the next verse was
[59:59] and
[1:00:00] she again bear his brother abel
[1:00:03] he said they were twins that's when i
[1:00:06] knew
[1:00:07] i'd missed something they were twins he
[1:00:09] said they've always been twins
[1:00:12] cain and abel isaac and ishmael
[1:00:16] jacob and esau he said
[1:00:20] at calvary there wasn't three that died
[1:00:22] it was four
[1:00:24] well that was new and he had his hand up
[1:00:27] like that he said jesus and judas
[1:00:33] jesus and one thief and judas and the
[1:00:36] other thief
[1:00:38] and he went like that and he said they
[1:00:41] each took one
[1:00:42] his way jesus took one thief to heaven
[1:00:46] and judas the son of perdition took one
[1:00:49] his way
[1:00:52] and then i realized it said then there
[1:00:54] were the antichrist in christ
[1:00:57] christ an antichrist every
[1:01:00] every revival bears twins
[1:01:04] and i could understand what was
[1:01:06] happening and what i was
[1:01:08] disillusioned about i knew one thing
[1:01:11] that my heart had been exposed and i was
[1:01:15] like naked before god
[1:01:17] [Music]
[1:01:18] and uh there was nothing hidden with god
[1:01:22] and that's the way it was with the
[1:01:24] people on the platform that's why he
[1:01:25] asked
[1:01:27] not hundreds thousands and thousands is
[1:01:30] that true
[1:01:31] is that true it was always true
[1:01:34] not one time in all of the lives in all
[1:01:37] of the
[1:01:38] years of ministry not one time
