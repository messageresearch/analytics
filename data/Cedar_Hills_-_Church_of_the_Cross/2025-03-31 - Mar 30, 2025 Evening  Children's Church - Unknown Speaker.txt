year olds what about my 50-year olds yeah well this little six-year-old had a big question on his heart can I see God so tonight we're going to to find out if he was able to see God so sit back relax and enjoy the story have you seen God I'm youing God have you God have you seen God all right as a little boy was asking everybody in the streets if they'd seen God he finally came to his grandfather have anyone seen God and as he turned to his grandfather he asked him a very important question hey Micah how are you today buddy good you look like you have something heavy on your heart why don't you ask your old grandpa something huh I ask you something sure can can you see God can you see God that's not a question for your grandfather why don't you ask uh maybe what about your Sunday school teacher I bet you he would know you want to try that all right let me go see where that Sunday school teacher is at all right class today we learned about the Ten Commandments and next week we're going to learn how Moses broke all 10 of them at once does anybody have any questions yes Micah you always have a lot of questions can you see God can you see God do I look qualified to answer that I am your Sunday school teacher that's so funny no I'm teaching the Ten Commandments not answering that question you need to ask the pastor that that question that is too deep for me okay okay all right yes okay let me I ask you a question Pastor uh yeah I guess so what do you got what what's your question huh Can you see God can you see God of course not the Bible says if any man sees God they will die do you want to die no absolutely not no man can seek God and live okay okay okay so don't ask that question ever again okay sorry to burst your bubble uhhuh go kick rocks over there get away from I am a c h I am a c h r i s c i n nothing like living on the ocean hey there buddy what you up to well you look kind of troubled I asked I asked my I asked my grandpa and I asked my teacher I asked my pastor and they all said no they said you couldn't seek God you look from ear ear look kid I've never seen you in my life but tell you what hop in the boat and let's just see if we can see God have a see careful there's a lot of water in here there's more water in here than there is outside of the boat e have a have a sit e why is there snakes and spiders PE you well I'm a fisherman you're going to find those kinds of things in the bo now pull this net up what kind of net we got a lot of fishing to do today why don't you untangle that while I start getting off the shore hey we got a big ship coming in they're going to blow us over grab that ore let go over here help me paddle I only have one good arm grab that thing let's get out of here we don't want to repeat of elephant be all right okay I think we're okay waters are calm clear skies nice clouds might be raining pretty soon so my first lesson of the day is the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a net that a fisherman threw out and this is called The Gospel net and when you throw out the net pull that puppy in pull that Hush Puppy in you like that one huh you don't have to laugh at all my jokes so why don't you go stand over there and tell me what's in that net and let your your friends see what we caught today a shark you caught a shark yeah oh get rid of it the last one ate off my toe got Gang Green octopus an octopus an octopus yeah let's not throw that one okay those are good eating okay I like them raw a shark again a shark again hey no no no don't throw that one that one's a sand shark he'll bite their fingers this one we got a sea turtle now we got all kinds of Little Critters let's just throw them back in the water we don't want all of them a crab all we want to catch today is the fish why fish that's was sorry guys give giveways are over all about crab oh yeah that's pretty good eating too yeah keep that one in the back we'll keep I want this one yeah that's a little baby little baby gator just let it back in the water here okay oh here come the seagulls about Wiz they'll eat anything you throw them all about wizard yeah we got a lizard all right so we got a couple good fish here I all right very good so we caught a whole bunch of lizards whole bunch of snakes how about a humpback how'd you catch a humpback I don't know it's a baby humpback we're going to put you on the best pro fishing channel boy catches a humpback with a with a net wouldn't you ever think of that do the humpback yeah we'll keep the hump back okay it's not tasty all right so come over here let's take inventory so we caught some lizards okay but we better go we caught some snakes snakes are poisonous but they're not poison I think we got a little couple spiders spiders are scary and that's just the way it is when you throw out the net you never know what you're going to catch like lobsters and a f but the scripture says you take all the good and you let all the bad ones go why cuz that's the way the gospel works too all our job is as fishermen is we just throw it out we tell them that Jesus died for you and if they're good guess what what they're going to hang on in that net and if they're bad guess what what they're going to hang on in that net but when we see that it's not something we want it's just going to get thrown back in the water but the gospel catches everybody and that's what we're thankful for so did you see God in that hey see all right okay so I got another lesson for you what's the lesson come over here I like to do this every day when I come over here come around don't hit your head on that cloud look at look at those starfish that's so these starfish they get washed up on the shore every even evening and the thing is if we don't help them they're going to dry up here and they're going to die and there's thousands of them look at them all don't you guys see them yeah what I like to do is I get me one and I throw it back in the water go trying to stay here sometimes they don't know their own good and they want to stay on the shore help us throw them guys let's get them back in the ocean we don't want them to dry up if they do they're going to be dry crusty stars get out of here get out of here all right what what does it matter oh what does it matter there's too many of them well it does matter see they're all helping us like little ministers getting all the people back where they need to be all right why doesn't everybody grab a starfish and go sit down immediately like yesterday oh he got broke in the mix I'll take that one find one you like and you can take them home you don't have to feed them just make sure they don't end up in your mom's washer oh thank you he has a broken limb oh I'll hold on to him thank you so you asked me a an interesting question what did you ask me got it you said what's the use there's so many of them what does it matter what's use there's too many of them what does it matter well it matters to the one that's in your hand like this yeah yeah there might be a lot of them but if you just save one that's what's important so the very one that you're able to save it matters to that one why did you so let's get back in the [Music] boat did everybody get to save a starfish hold your starfish in the air Whoever has the gold star on the back of your starfish gets $100 actually there's not one that has one I just wanted to get you excited okay so our main lesson is that we saw God today Micah the lesson is that when you get God in here you can see him in everything you do oh if you're fishing okay if you're with your mom at the store okay or if you're at school okay walking your dog oh you can see God in everything okay but you got to get him in here first but you can see him and he's working through his people look around here look at your neighbor and say hello Jesus hello Jesus hello Jesus you see it is true God is a spirit but he has to live in human beings he has to operate through us so we see the the pastor okay when you see your grandfather okay when you see the Sunday school teacher okay that is Jesus speaking to you okay no you say amen amen can everybody say amen amen wow you're going to rock my boat that was a close one though all right I think we have a song to go with this yes we do let's hear that beautiful [Music] song the Greeks come one time and said sir we
