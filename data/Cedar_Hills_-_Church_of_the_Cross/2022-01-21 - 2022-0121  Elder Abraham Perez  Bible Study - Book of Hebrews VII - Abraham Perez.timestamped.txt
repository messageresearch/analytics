[9:54] [Music]
[10:09] so
[10:13] [Music]
[10:45] you
[11:47] god bless you this evening
[11:52] anytime we can come
[11:53] it's a privilege
[11:59] and i thank each and every one of you of
[12:01] making the effort
[12:03] not to hear me but to hear
[12:07] right from the
[12:26] [Music]
[12:33] hebrews
[12:35] 4
[12:36] 1.
[12:45] you have it you can see ma'am
[12:53] let us therefore fear
[12:55] lest a promise be left us of entering to
[12:58] his rest
[13:00] many of you should seem to come short of
[13:03] it
[13:17] heavenly father we give you thanks
[13:30] lord as we hunger and thirst to learn
[13:33] more about you
[13:38] because the scripture states
[13:43] that in the last days there will be a
[13:44] famine
[14:00] that you help your humble servant this
[14:03] evening
[14:07] i'll try to explain this chapter 4 of
[14:10] the book of hebrews
[14:15] because without your help
[14:18] how am i going to help your children
[14:23] so i place this and everything into your
[14:26] hands
[14:29] en susmanos for your honor and glory to
[14:32] andre is to gloria in the name of the
[14:34] lord jesus christ
[14:37] you may be
[14:42] seated good to see you brother reasons
[14:46] sister pena again you know yes
[14:53] and everyone else it's good to see you
[14:56] guys
[15:10] as we go deeper into the
[15:13] book of hebrews
[15:19] it's gonna get deeper and deeper
[15:24] yeah yeah but it's gonna get cooler and
[15:28] cooler
[15:31] amen amen
[15:53] because many times we ignore more than
[15:55] what we know
[15:59] so we are going to start off where we
[16:02] left off
[16:04] the last time
[16:10] now paul
[16:12] in the last chapter was trying to tell
[16:15] them about these things
[16:48] and paul met him
[16:50] in pablo line control face to face kara
[16:54] akara that pillar of fire este pilar de
[16:57] fuego and since he was unconverted
[17:03] it caused him to have
[17:05] eye problems the rest of his life
[17:11] so we see here
[17:14] these pilgrims on a journey
[17:22] [Music]
[17:31] have test masters ordering
[17:34] them what to do
[17:40] not as the the pillar of fire led them
[17:44] because
[17:49] [Music]
[18:22] but that was not the rest that was
[18:25] talking about here it
[18:32] we're talking about another arrest
[18:38] the the promise was to enter
[18:41] his rest the promised adventure and so
[18:44] reposter there's a difference i i start
[18:47] a difference here there is a promise
[18:51] and don't come sure of it
[19:08] what
[19:32] [Music]
[19:37] so the gospel was preached to them
[19:43] but the bible says
[19:45] and we did not profit them it is
[19:49] not lost a prophet saw and you say well
[19:53] that happened to them
[19:56] what the heck do we preach from behind
[19:58] this pulpit
[20:01] so we praise the gospel
[20:04] is it
[20:19] the pastor presses many hours starting
[20:21] and he doesn't profit
[20:28] hours and hours we have to study
[20:45] but because it is the good
[20:58] and all of you i don't care where you
[21:01] came or who was your father or mother
[21:04] you were in bondage to something
[21:06] important
[21:12] so the good news is
[21:44] i hope that
[21:45] that does not happen in this
[21:47] congregation
[21:52] you people are so privileged
[22:08] can you imagine who founded this
[22:11] church
[22:15] the greatest teacher we've ever heard
[22:20] and on the line of him
[22:24] under the
[22:35] and i believe it is profit each and
[22:38] every one of them
[23:04] what would happen if the pastor said
[23:07] we're going to have service every day of
[23:08] the week
[23:09] oh no
[23:11] sunday morning is enough
[23:17] so people that think that way
[23:22] [Music]
[23:35] a
[23:38] the rest of the day yeah don't eat your
[23:40] breakfast don't eat the rest of the day
[23:42] see how it goes
[23:43] yes
[23:45] it's what you're hungry hunger for it is
[24:03] [Music]
[24:20] it was it was not
[24:22] mixed with faith on those that hurt him
[24:29] romans 10 16 romanos yes this he says
[24:35] but they have not all obeyed the gospel
[24:38] for isaiah said lord who have believed
[24:42] our report
[24:44] not
[25:05] all foolish galatians who have been
[25:08] wished you that you should not obey the
[25:10] truth before whose eyes jesus christ has
[25:14] been evidently served
[25:16] forth crucified among you
[25:26] representative
[25:31] this only would i learn of you receiving
[25:34] the spirit by the words of the law or by
[25:37] the hearing of faith
[25:53] go ahead
[25:56] are years of foolish having begun in the
[25:59] spirit are ye not made perfect by the
[26:01] flesh
[26:09] have you suffered so many things in vain
[26:12] if it be yet in vain
[26:20] here for the ministers of you the spirit
[26:24] and workers miracles among you
[26:26] that it
[26:27] doesn't it by the words of the law or by
[26:30] the hearing of faith
[26:58] [Music]
[27:04] but
[27:27] [Music]
[27:32] to condemn
[27:45] for we which have believed do enter the
[27:48] rest as he said as i have fallen in my
[27:52] wrath if they shall enter into my rest
[27:55] although the works were finished from
[27:57] the foundation of the world
[28:16] for he spake in a certain place of the
[28:19] seventh day and these wise
[28:22] and god did rest the seventh day from
[28:25] all his words
[28:45] so the seventh day is god's rest
[28:54] how did god rest come up with
[29:06] [Music]
[29:09] but brother branham said
[29:22] so how can god rest physically
[29:49] there used to be
[29:51] when i was a teenager i mean the
[30:06] kimly
[30:20] and there used to be a unilateral
[30:23] holder
[30:26] there was a
[30:28] cigarette called camo
[30:33] and they publicized it i'll walk a mile
[30:36] for a camel remember
[30:44] what if
[30:46] you didn't have a car and you have to
[30:47] walk a mile to this church
[30:54] look at the testimonies that caleb
[30:57] and these brothers that go to uganda
[31:00] what they walk their brother
[31:02] how many
[31:16] [Music]
[31:22] they don't come in brand new cars and
[31:24] trucks 80 miles ah
[31:26] but in the day of judgement everything
[31:30] will be
[31:46] [Music]
[32:10] [Music]
[32:27] like brother caleb said le sandy
[32:32] and he made also the question
[32:34] does god have a finger
[32:40] you know
[32:41] well
[32:42] how did he write the ten commandments
[32:46] how did he write the handwriting on the
[32:48] wall
[32:54] does god
[33:11] [Music]
[33:16] and he said thou cannot see my face for
[33:20] there shall no man see me and leave
[33:30] and the lord said behold there is a
[33:32] place by me
[33:35] and thou shalt stand
[33:47] my glory passes by that i will put thee
[33:50] in a cleft of the rock and will cover
[33:54] this with my hand while i pass by
[33:59] gloria
[34:07] and i will take away
[34:10] my hand
[34:11] and thou shalt see my back part but my
[34:15] face shall not be seen
[34:18] apart
[34:36] and the lord came down in the pillar of
[34:39] the cloud and stood in the door of a
[34:42] tabernacle and called aaron and miriam
[34:45] and they both came
[34:57] and he said hear now my word if there be
[35:00] a prophet among you i the lord will make
[35:03] myself known unto him in a vision and
[35:06] will speak unto him in a dream
[35:21] my servant moses is not so
[35:24] who is faithful in all my house
[35:28] is
[35:32] with him will speak mouth to mouth
[35:36] even apparently and not in
[35:40] dark species in the similitude of the
[35:44] lord shall he behold wherefore there
[35:46] were ye not afraid to speak against my
[35:49] servant moses
[36:02] in the hebrew it does not say similitude
[36:05] he said
[36:06] moses is in the form of the lord
[36:09] and allah
[36:25] john
[36:26] among the candlesticks see
[36:29] someone in the similarity of the son of
[36:33] man juan novyo
[36:35] los candoleros
[36:39] but now he says in the similarity of the
[36:42] lord but already
[36:46] he looked just in like just like god
[36:50] and the form of the lord
[36:52] foreign
[37:10] and he shall be thy spokesman unto the
[37:12] people and he shall be even
[37:15] he shall beat him instead of a mouth and
[37:17] thou shall be to him instead of
[37:31] he was in the form of god and he looked
[37:34] just like god
[37:47] and the lord said unto moses see i have
[37:50] maybe a god to pharaoh and ever thy
[37:54] brother shall be thy prophet
[38:00] is
[38:08] moses was the god to the people
[38:15] remember what moses had told the people
[38:20] pueblo today
[38:24] if you hear his voice you'll get us to
[38:26] us hard not your heart
[38:30] but the gospel preached to them did not
[38:33] profit them without faith
[38:38] so they provoked god
[38:40] and made
[38:41] him angry provocative
[39:51] for the whole human
[39:55] so now race
[39:56] threw himself in the bridge for his role
[40:02] remember
[40:03] moses was the only one
[40:06] who could speak to god
[40:17] we read that in numbers 12-8 remember
[40:34] who else in the bible could talk
[40:49] you made a promise to these people now
[40:52] you want to kill them
[40:57] you were supposed to take them to the
[40:59] land of promise
[41:04] but now you will not kill them
[41:07] so what's wrong with you
[41:11] you imagine a man talking their way to
[41:14] god
[41:18] he said you're going back on your word
[41:24] it seemed that god was going to do
[41:27] something contrary to what he already
[41:29] has spoken
[42:14] nobody else could talk to god that way
[42:20] all right muy bien i won't destroy them
[42:24] now oh no that's
[42:26] true but i will
[42:42] is
[43:10] mouth
[44:32] in that old house in hanover that we
[44:35] lived
[44:37] in
[44:38] there were cracks on the wall
[44:44] and we would wake up in the morning
[45:01] i mean we couldn't even open our
[45:07] [Music]
[45:16] it
[45:18] we both
[45:20] ambus
[45:21] we had to get water from a whale
[45:26] we wore hand-me-down clothes
[45:30] i would go to
[45:32] school with
[45:34] one shoe different from the other eva
[45:39] and the kids would make fun of me
[45:43] one time i had to wear my brother moy's
[45:46] combat boots to school
[45:53] you should have seen how the kids were
[45:55] so cool they made a lot of fun
[46:13] the stove that my mother had was a wood
[46:16] stove
[46:18] so we would have to go cut wood in the
[46:20] hills and come
[46:22] bring it home
[46:30] [Music]
[46:40] would load other trucks a lot of the
[46:43] coal would fall on the ground
[46:50] so me and my brother danny and brother
[46:52] tommy would take some bags and pick up
[46:55] the cold from the side of the railroad
[46:57] tracks
[47:04] so
[47:04] we use some of that coal to heat the put
[47:07] in the wood stove it's
[47:10] [Music]
[47:12] civilization is traveling
[47:17] got to the time that we
[47:20] had a stove that burned kerosene or
[47:23] petroleum
[47:30] and then
[47:32] further on
[47:34] this place
[47:36] we've got to burn
[47:38] butane propane
[47:50] civil not
[48:19] people get have solar panels
[48:25] look at the civilization
[48:28] if you buy those solar panels the sun
[48:31] will give energy inside your house
[48:38] when we were all in the world
[48:41] or in different denominations
[48:44] we were burning wood and coal
[49:13] is
[49:28] amen amen
[49:31] have you found your position
[49:35] do you know that teaching put you in
[49:37] your position
[49:41] and do you know that that's what the
[49:43] devil hates the most
[49:47] i hope each and every one is from their
[49:50] position
[49:54] like the pastor priest
[50:08] foreign
[50:23] he can say
[50:27] and on the seventh day in el dia septimo
[50:31] receptive god completed his work
[50:49] [Music]
[50:51] he blessed the seventh day
[50:55] of the year he sanctified the seventh
[50:58] day
[51:01] what does the word bless me
[51:06] to consecrate the consequences
[51:20] he said it is to keep and protect yes
[51:29] so he rested physically
[51:34] how did he rest and in whom did he rest
[51:40] he rested on his son
[51:47] because he was a god like moses was a
[51:50] god to the people
[51:55] that was his son
[51:57] he put all the trust on his son
[52:01] so he rested
[52:20] [Music]
[52:27] [Music]
[52:38] [Music]
[52:40] to the the fence around the garden and
[52:43] put no trespassing
[53:15] it was going to be a
[53:18] one day or a thousand years of rest
[53:25] but
[53:27] [Music]
[53:40] genesis and revelation are my favorite
[53:42] books
[53:46] and i've explained this about
[53:48] about there was not a man to till the
[53:50] soil
[53:54] until yesterday that the lord told me
[53:57] something that i had missed
[54:05] there was not a man to kill the soil
[54:22] and put the man whom he had formed
[54:27] and also in genesis 2 dominic genesis
[54:31] god took the man
[54:34] and put him in the garden illo poso
[55:03] before he made the garden or planted the
[55:07] garden
[55:10] it says there was not a man to kill the
[55:12] soil
[55:15] but if you go with them
[55:23] he says
[55:24] the god put the man in the girl not to
[55:29] kill but to countervail
[55:31] because
[55:58] therefore the lord god sent him forth
[56:00] from the being to till the ground when
[56:04] he was taken
[56:15] since adam was going to be the god
[56:19] eva
[56:21] why would he have to do manual work to
[56:24] tilt
[56:27] the lab
[56:31] he didn't until until he was thrown out
[56:34] from the garden of eden
[56:38] foreign
[56:51] [Music]
[57:12] hebrews 4 5 and 6.
[57:18] and in this place again if they shall
[57:20] enter into my rest
[57:28] therefore he remained the psalmist into
[57:31] the ring and they to whom it was first
[57:34] priest intern not because of unbelief
[58:30] it would be impossible for either to be
[58:32] correct
[58:39] [Music]
[58:45] because if it was so there would be many
[58:48] of these seven days
[58:53] and many first days
[59:00] so then if saturday and sunday are not
[59:02] the lord's
[59:17] not in the time of john no era en el
[59:21] tiempo de juan he went in the spirit to
[59:24] the lord's day
[59:25] in the spirit
[59:28] because this is the day of men
[59:38] because paul was picked up and got into
[59:42] the spirit of the sabbath
[59:59] the word transmit going from one place
[1:00:02] to another
[1:00:05] he said i don't believe he was taken
[1:00:08] like paul up into the third heaven
[1:00:12] pablo
[1:00:39] uh his ideas
[1:00:55] call was speaking of being judged by men
[1:00:59] in that day
[1:01:04] let a man saw account of us as
[1:01:06] of the
[1:01:07] ministers of christ and stewards of the
[1:01:10] mysteries of god
[1:01:20] moreover it is required in stewards that
[1:01:22] a man be found faithful
[1:01:31] but with me it is a very small thing
[1:01:33] that i should be judged of you or of
[1:01:35] men's judgment
[1:01:51] by myself yet am i not hereby justified
[1:01:54] but he that judges me is the lord
[1:02:04] yes
[1:02:06] therefore just nothing before
[1:02:09] the time until the lord come who both
[1:02:12] will bring to light the hidden things of
[1:02:14] darkness and will make manifest the
[1:02:16] councils of the hearts and theirs tell
[1:02:19] every man have praise of god
[1:02:32] on
[1:02:35] paul was speaking of being judged by men
[1:02:38] in man's day
[1:02:39] pablo
[1:02:43] a time when men's work is glorified
[1:02:49] they spend billions and billions of
[1:02:51] dollars to go to the moon
[1:02:54] [Music]
[1:02:56] a wasted effort
[1:03:00] oh
[1:03:30] so man's day is glorified by knowledge
[1:03:34] which came by satan
[1:03:41] so in 1960
[1:03:46] father said this in the mount of banham
[1:03:48] but the day of the lord is coming
[1:03:56] when these kingdoms become the kingdoms
[1:03:59] of our lord in his christ
[1:04:05] remember the scripture is compounded
[1:04:24] i may
[1:04:38] it can never get old
[1:04:42] i can still fulfill my commission
[1:04:45] siempre apollo completed my commission
[1:04:48] and made arrows to yoga young ministers
[1:04:51] he said last pledge us by
[1:05:00] are we
[1:05:02] in the day of the lord estamos en el dia
[1:05:05] del senor i thought we were in the day
[1:05:07] of man
[1:05:10] in 1960
[1:05:14] he said that there the lord is coming
[1:05:17] is it coming or did it already come
[1:05:28] i john who also have your brother and
[1:05:30] companion in tribulation
[1:05:33] in the in the
[1:05:34] kingdom and patience of jesus christ was
[1:05:37] in the isle that is called patmos for
[1:05:39] the word of god and for the testimony of
[1:05:42] jesus christ
[1:05:58] i was in the spirit on the lord's day
[1:06:02] and heard behind me a great voice s of a
[1:06:05] trumpet
[1:06:16] did he
[1:07:12] what
[1:07:38] remember he went in the
[1:07:54] of the like a trumpet in the day of man
[1:07:58] or in the day of the lord
[1:08:06] something important is at hand
[1:08:11] [Music]
[1:08:22] without faith she said you're hearing
