========================================

what about that church one thing I know about this word I highly gonna believe a church when these nine hundred and something different denominations in each one st. our denomination has exactly the truth where would you go to you've got to have faith in something well you say I have faith in the Methodist and the Baptist and the Presbyterian in the Lutheran in the Pentecost from the Kathleen whatever it is you got faith in that organization and if it's contrary to the word you're good the same thing I've done Zach you're doing exactly the same thing she did taking God's Word and make it well these are better class of people goes here it's a bigger building they're smarter man they don't have one thing to do with it Satan is much smarter than Eve she didn't wasn't even in the picture but she wasn't supposed to be smart she supposed to be obedient we're not supposed to be smaller jesus said the children of this world of Kingdom in this world is much smarter the children of darkness as the children of life we're liking the sheep sheep can't even leave themselves they've got to have a shepherd God don't want a smart horses to lean on his understanding that's where he'll even hate me you see the picture don't lead up on your own understanding proverbs five three don't need up on your own understanding lean upon his understanding no matter how con trade seems how big the bright lights look out here don't pay no attention it is lean on his understanding what he said is the truth now the oneness and fellowship was broke between God and his children the minute she disbelieved one little paragraph one little word of God everybody get that say a man not a Bible say I don't need the Bible at all I believe half of it she had to believe all every bit not only that but the one this between husband and wife was broken I don't believe this any marriage can be what it ought to be without a union between husband and wife and God right they'll bring up children in the world and make them legitimates give them cigarettes whiskey play cards on their side drink liquor before them no matter how long they are to their marriage vows that's sexually iced flesh but there's a spirit in there that spirit of a sinner poppin mama no matter how loyal to their children become wrong we say I know men and women that didn't teach your children that it wasn't Christians the very thing of not leading under Christ was the longest thing they could ever do besides the other not to lead him to Christ see so you can't have a correct union without it the fellowship broken man as soon as the fellowship was broken between Adam and Eve as soon as their fellowship is broke between God in them then their fellowship between each other was grown listen anytime a church breaks his fellowship two thoughts up into an organization the fellowship of the believers is rule we've got to believe with one heart one mind and water card that's the way there was before the Union was ever made on the day of Pentecost one heart one mind amount of card and when you throw a church into an organization you're gonna get all kinds of fractions in it because some of them children there's going to believe in god they're gonna hold to the thing that's right and the others will go the other way sir you have no fellowship yes what her thinking changed oh yes her thinking changed her fellowship with her husband wasn't right they begin to past about her thinking was actually changed why she had the life of the devil in her doctor as soon as she disbelieved God's Word she accepted the life of the devil because she accepted his teaching I can make us all four strong right here but its own paper I'm sure you understand in the church she disbelieved God's Word and it disassociated her from God because in her right then what's the life of the devil she'd believed his life said the fruits is good and she'd protect him with him it's right-angle all this hubbub let it come in another day in law at California I mean in Arizona I was teaching in a church I've never said nothing under inspiration that ever had to take back so maybe the ministers got anything about the seed of Satan the Serpent's seed the woman it was eaten apple that's what came talked the same thing he brought the fruits of the feelings he was a little at home how'd she realize she's naked we'd been through that actually a sexual affair certainly was she realized she's naked she had a child by the serpent which was not a reptile is more subtle of all the beasts his next thing to a man man combined monkeys in Japan's chimpanzees and so forth but they can't find that weight that connects man and beast together there he is God cursed him so far he can't come back for this evil act that he did is the only a seed that would mix now the other days standing preaching there's a bunch of Catholic people in my audience one said you Catholic people that called Jesus or call Mary rather the mother of God how can God have a mother what is he turning you can't have a mother Jesus does not even anything to Mary but he was just she was the incubator that hatched well they always believed in a head of idea that myself years ago that the the Macklin conception was a god over shattered and put a blood cell in there but the egg come from the woman if the egg come from the woman there has to come a sensation to bring the egg to the to see what you do at God you're making it a sexual mess God who created the black cell created the egg also doctor there has to be both male and female Apollo right well then if this woman produced the egg then how could David say I'll not leave my Holy One see corruption neither I leave his soul in hell then if the woman 8 was in Christ then the person's got something to do with his part in the resurrection what it's how I complete with God why did God raise up a sexual part of a person in the resurrection why did he leave his body see corruption because he was hauling now how can he be holy if he had had a conception with Mary and the pollen had come from Mary to aid down to the tube into the womb that had to be some sensation to bring the egg down then the woman would be wasted they might have been laying there could have been possible but that if so then look what happens here then he wasn't all together God he wasn't gone as much as he was human but then affect me so the woman had something in it and the actual seed that come from Mary which come from her mother and her mother and her mother was something human mixed into it with the human desire could the man no sir I said he she was only just like you take the eagle and let it lay a name and put it under the in the hen we'll have steak she's only the incubator but there isn't one fact about it the Eagle it's a chicken Wilson the hymn was it you can tie them up up down over the top of a a birdie it would hatch a bird the pup would it's a warrant for the body that hatch the egg and that's the same way it is with Jesus Mary was just the incubator God used her like he does any other woman she was a virgin she'd had no children he come into a virgin wound but God the Creator made both egg and jaren created it therefore it was immaculate conception when I come out of course you know the brethren waiting for me they said brother branham I want to ask you something you made a mistake now we got you caught all right that's what I want to become and said you made the mistake for saying this when you preach the Serpent's seed now you say that that the a belong God created it the egg what happened we find out you're that in Genesis the 3rd chapter God said to Mary I will put enmity between your seed and the serpent see I never preached anything in my life under inspiration I had to take back because I don't depend upon my own understanding and if my understanding is contrary to God's work that my understanding is wrong it's got to be God's Word if it isn't leave it alone it's not right when I'll tear it down the thing to do a my heart I said Heavenly Father you help me I don't know what to do here the man is the scriptures party's favorite I'll put enmity between your seed and the serpent see now here it is the Holy Spirit moved over the same one that could overshadow their I could create you can also put a word in your mouth I depend on him daily and it's always his word you can't say this something contrary to his work now if you're say you're not even preach against the truth of God then just opt the anointing of the Holy gold because when the Holy Ghost overshadows you he brings the same thing because it is the word listen what happened I said all right I want to ask you something the woman has no age Jay has no seed he said now you said now eight he said I see and she had no see that takes a union to make a seed that right doctor has to be if you got a hold on Popeye your didn't handle life and it fight it out here it wouldn't come up later in rock you couldn't paint the life without having the bone so you see the whole thing is a union I'm trying to tell you now about Christ in the church it's a union see if the woman is the seed of herself then she doesn't need the minute she had her baby herself but she can't be us she can't have the baby until she's been with the male because it takes the two together to make his seed is that right plain to see with no life in and see what happened like they got this stand this woman giving birth to these dogs here it couldn't be Ladd couldn't be cause see the pollen won't mix now notice this now the the woman was not a seed therefore he said I will put enmity between thy seed and the Serpent's II telling her that he was going himself to give her seed not through an intercourse sexually he was going to create in her seed place a would that be here to see guess he would long to marry then after he gave it to her this is my I he give me this his mom but he gave it to me this is my hand he gave it to me this is my voice but he cannot tell me see and the seed and it was Mary had nothing to do with Mary there was something God did himself so the seed that was in her then was a union of a unlawful act which was death she was already pregnant him with the Serpent's seed because she lived with her and she turned and said herself the serpent egami trying and I'm needed they came come on all we know she said she got a child from God certainly every child is born illegitimate everything else has to come as an act of God he's the only one you can make life certainly that is right see she was already to be mother and that's never only what it did was clear up the thing of the cerfancy the seat that's in you now is my concepted your unlawful act against my word with this thing here and you're now got the Serpent's scene but I'll give you a seed by Immaculate Conception and his seed shall bruise the Serpent's head and his head shall bruise the heel amen just let God have it this is word you bring it to pass that's the reason you've got to be in union with God that's the reason that Peter said on the day of Pentecost after Jesus said baptize them in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost Peter turn around said baptize them in the name of Jesus Christ but cause the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ see that it takes a union Paul had never seen Peter but the same holy ghost in that same union born caused him to say the same thing have you received the Holy Ghost said she be said we don't worry about how is she baptized said owner John said yeah be baptized over again in the name of Jesus Christ and they receive the Holy Ghost by bison the Union saying the same thing God says that's a confession confess me say the same thing and he's the high priest of our confession the octuple what Thea said we say it's a truth and he acts upon oh there you are there is a conception now watch how she she our union between her husband was broken see up quickly as soon as God said Adam how'd you do this instead of taking up for his wife he passed it on to his wife the woman now give us me Union broke what did she do instead of loving her husband and telling the truth she lied she says she should have said he's innocent I gave to him the Bible said she gave to her husband she should have said the man's innocent I gave to him and then he did eat but I was one again attorney instead of that she passed it on to the circle hostess bypass that's the same thing to try to do today the husband wife the union broker husband and wife fellowship is broken between them the oneness Saddam is broken the one is between them and God was broken the whole thing was marred why they called one word was disbelief oh brother mom yes she should have told the truth the oneness with her and her husband was gone and the oneness abandoned God was gone in every Church that doesn't take the home of God's Word the same thing happens I love it don't you watch your firstborn team a murder Allah a deceiver jealous jealous of his brother his brother kept the commandments of God God had made an atonement by killing an offering and offered it for them what's the ignorance of that a Satan trying to shut the to something God the Bible said went and made them a pers out of skins to give skins something died and him tried to make yourself some aprons out of fig leaves it wouldn't work botany life life moving I've had to die so he killed a lord form of life and staying in there there's some day my own life will be here for you the real life that have joined this union again now we're get to it in a few minutes God willing see here's the Lambs life now you put this around you and hide your nakedness you mustn't eat apples nonsense put these skins around you you had to kill something I'm Satan's son they come the way he wanted he did anyway you want to say it but it was Satan's son cuz that purity of Adam to God could not have broke that kind of a thing notice then Satan's son trying to make an atonement come back for the same thing that most of the people say today a bunch of apples and fruits to the land to offer for an atonement an antidote and what did righteous able to he note that it wasn't no such a thing he's eating apples he was a blood of his mother daddy life of them so he brought a lamb just like God did he kept the Word of God am i and Cain was jealous with him same thing today yeah coming that blur Allah flee that word of God just exactly what it says stay right with it a lot of believe that blood offerings sure but something else to wear to say oh I don't believe that out of that that's for the other day same ole devil same old trick wait till we get through with him notice he come right down the same way but Cain it is stupid ways not so stupid but it is cunning way deceived and brought in fruit Adam kept the UH Abel kept the Word of God he brought in a lamb God said that's right Hannah you've kept her Abel you've kept my word taking you know we're not table take some fig leaves like your daddy tried to do you got a bunch of feeds your grapes or apples or whatever you got here and how your daddy took the leaves off the tree you're trying to make an atonement you're you try to bring the fruit off the trees it wasn't that it was blood from high Oh God wrote it down so here's Abel offered the right one then his brother with jealous Adam look what he did he killed his brother God raised up another one like this barely resurrection of Christ watch God been his what did he tell Adam and Eve go on and multiply and replenish the earth scattering the human race all the earth so I could deal with it individually till they could bring them back together dealing with the people individuals each person but they didn't want it that way don't miss this revelation God let it happen maybe the way I'm looking at it it wasn't that God don't deal with a person in a group God don't deal with in an organization he deals with you as an individual I'm individual individually we are baptized with the Holy Ghost collectively we are baptized into the body when we are baptized with the Holy Ghost amen individually each one baptized with the Holy Ghost God dealing with each one that was just birthless scatter them across here so I could deal individually with him but instead of that what happened God had to separate Kings people from Sam's people he sent Tina way separated him so he could deal with his church watch Thema separated now watch God separated Eve's evil Cain from Adams wholly safe did he do it to an unlawful act this woman living with to somebody else and brought a child God separated that child and here generations from this righteous and holy man his children is the same thing today separating separated found then they were not in unity they could have no unity can I have unity with day 10 a believer have unity with an infidel 10 a man who believes in all the Word of God have a unity with them who does these part of the Word of God God won't separators now teen was Eve son she said I have gotten the son but safe was Adam son and God separated them because he couldn't let why they crush one another Cain's evil children would corrupt since good children thrive watch and the same old devil that paused Eve to disbelieve one word of God and told them to separate themselves from one another and to live for each one that seemed devil got among them and got them together again did you get it say hey man if it is he brought them together again under a false Union a act of God against God's pain what happened how did he do it the sons of God said the Bible Genesis seen the daughters of men the sons of God says children saw the daughters of mancation how pretty they were and what do they do they fail fall and they United themselves together you the cause of beauty that they were fair to look upon [Music] [Applause] [Music]

events that have happened Aventis km contested o events that are happening event was kissing even at events that are coming even to the nidaros so today we want to focus on two great events oh you know stadium wasn't forgot and those man if you want to write it down I get this from the message then Jesus came he has to a little more than a second ago we know his news and he says this the Old Testament to say L&T with this Demento looked for two great events which come up for those grandes eventos i want to see if you can help me this morning what those two great events were curiously made you then in mister my hand i just anyone is everybody here won't help me just didn't say it out can ii me character had no money the rate sunday school it's quite a lot of mini kali anybody algún one of them was the coming of the messiah who knows lowly very good need a little misty yes and number two in number of those so the old testament looked at two great events coming of the messiah and the coming of the holy spirit in ESP to sent oh man I mean that's tremendous tremendo because they you you you see you see the dispensations that of the very dispensations of god once again he says one of them the coming of the Messiah ooh not a lot I need a little mysterious and the other the coming of the Holy Ghost I need a list we look for two events he said he's almost a DOS eventos that was the Old Testament it's real until now the New Testament Saints are Los Santos then we also look for two events to me tell me what they are he are getting appointed a theory so he says the two events los dos Santos is the outpouring of the Holy Ghost in the last days is there a momento Ellis Peters entre los últimos D s and the second coming of the Lord unless they would have any I'll see you then now remember there are scenes as the sister said acquitted issyk yes it's famous there are some names and events that are happening is Nina's kissing even acabo but remember even though we await another event of the resurrection of the saints LLL kiss para mula xi o erection de lausanne it all is pointing to one thing though as to Punta una cosa what we have waited and long for our lives I am sue Spinelli and that is the second coming of the Lord that is what we look forward amen Esther is looking at all these other things they produce or they bring that to pass so estas cosas con lo que train they stalk and then brother Bram says and we are now having the outpouring is in a memorandum our estamos dando there's a meal great events I totally outpouring of the Holy Ghost in the last days there's a coming of the Lord unless they wounded me that we are now having the outpouring ER at enema seldom I mean that the Second Coming is at hand de la segunda we need esta la oh how it thrills the heart of a believer to know that this great day we're living in como trancoso Corazon del Caliente he said in Esther dia he said the outpouring that that was that we're waiting for or is now in this last days elder a momento de estos Ultimo's Diaz the fulfillment of Joelle 228 and compliment to the window vintage it shall come to pass afterward you see this poison stuck on this era that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh my name is Peter smooth-talkin brother branham once again says elimin Renan this day and it is happening we are now having the outpouring it is almost any endoderm I mean now there is one thing that that can hold the event from happening I mean a cosa que puede tener el event oh they are going to say I'm gonna say this again when we turn in look there is one thing that will keep that event from happening you know cosas que put the avatar Castel enough talking about the coming of the Lord estoy hablando de la yes you don't tell me what that event is ciale gi'me puede ser que es este dento the readiness of the church is partial is part of the answer not kill Alicia still lista is partial me buddy letter suppose that's what brother Branham says
