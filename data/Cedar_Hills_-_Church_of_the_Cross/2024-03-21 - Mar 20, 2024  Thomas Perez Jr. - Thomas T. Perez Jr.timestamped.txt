[31:54] had appointed speaking unto Moses that
[31:57] he should make it according to the
[31:59] fashion that he had
[32:08] seen which also our fathers that came
[32:11] after brought in with Jesus into
[32:14] possession of the Gentiles whom God
[32:17] drave out before the face of our fathers
[32:20] unto the days of
[32:26] DAV
[32:32] who found favor before God and desired

[34:01] might might that we have on Fridays uh
[34:04] might be a little bit uh maybe a little
[34:07] bit ahead of of of uh maybe uh us
[34:10] tonight but but uh I just want to to go
[34:14] maybe go over some things that might
[34:16] might be able to help
[34:24] you and uh I trust in the Lord of what
[34:28] he has done for
[34:31] us now
[34:32] now I I'd like I have a have a pamphlet
[34:37] here and it's a big old pamphlet of of
[34:39] the 12
[34:43] disciples that that became the 12
[34:46] apostles and and in it it it I don't
[34:49] know if every anybody ever reads any of
[34:53] these but but it's it's it's uh it's
[34:56] it's a some some Publications that that
[34:59] is that is placed by The Rose Publishing
[35:02] Company it's a Christian
[35:06] company but they give something like uh
[35:09] like uh the name of
[35:13] Peter and Peter was was uh as you know
[35:16] with the chief of the
[35:18] Apostles and you know his his name
[35:21] before Peter was
[35:23] Simon uh but it gives like a general
[35:27] information about
[35:29] him but what I want to read about
[35:32] certain of the of the disciples is
[35:36] this is their personality and their
[35:39] character maybe you can find yourself in
[35:42] one of these
[35:44] disciples I I I found myself and and uh
[35:47] you know you know but
[35:50] but but here here you here you find out
[35:52] the the
[35:54] disciples Peter his uh character his
[35:57] personality ity was
[36:00] this he was
[36:03] impulsive he was hot
[36:05] tempered he was
[36:10] insightful but he was courageous after
[36:15] Pentecost you like that that that uh
[36:17] that that
[36:19] character James the the son of
[36:24] zebede he was vengeful and fiery
[36:29] selfish and
[36:33] conceited but he was committed to Christ
[36:36] and courageous to the
[36:40] end the other son of zebede
[36:45] John vengeful and
[36:49] fiery judgmental and
[36:54] selfish but he was bold and comp
[36:57] passionate and loving after
[37:02] Pentecost are you getting the
[37:05] idea Andrew was enthusiastic about
[37:11] Christ inquisitive and
[37:16] resourceful and you can go on and on and
[37:20] on about their character and their
[37:24] personality and the way that they were
[37:28] these were men just like you and
[37:32] I they each have their
[37:36] personalities they had their
[37:39] characteristics but one thing is that
[37:42] got them together was
[37:44] this this was the miracle of
[37:49] Pentecost now now now we we we do
[37:52] believe in the great miracle at
[37:53] Pentecost
[37:56] right they they came out of the upper
[37:59] room they were speaking in unknown or
[38:03] other other forgive me they were
[38:04] speaking in other
[38:08] languages and but the mystery or the
[38:11] miracle of
[38:14] Pentecost was not that they were just
[38:16] speaking in in tongues or in in other
[38:21] languages the miracle of Pentecost was
[38:25] this that each one one of
[38:28] them 17 Nations that were
[38:33] represented each one of them heard the
[38:36] message in their own
[38:39] language that was the miracle of
[38:42] Pentecost now now but before that
[38:47] Miracle there was another
[38:49] miracle how do you get
[38:52] 120 Jewish people
[38:56] together to be in one place and one
[39:01] Accord now I think I think we we tonight
[39:03] we probably have more than 120
[39:07] here and and for for a group of this
[39:11] people each one of us has a different
[39:15] idea each one of us has a different
[39:18] thought each one of us has a different
[39:21] concept of what we think should be
[39:25] happening in 12
[39:28] but could you
[39:30] imagine that 120 Jewish
[39:34] people got together this to me was the
[39:38] miracle before the
[39:41] miracle in one place in one
[39:45] Accord I was I I don't know if we could
[39:48] get three or four people in one
[39:52] Accord some might like a a riye steak
[39:58] some like Chinese
[40:00] food some like to eat Mexican
[40:05] food others like to eat Thai
[40:09] food some like to raise their
[40:12] hands some are very
[40:14] quiet some like to be uh
[40:20] fiery and other people have different
[40:24] characteristics but let me tell you all
[40:27] of these people were in one place in one
[40:32] court and in one mind why they had heard
[40:37] the voice of
[40:39] Jesus and the voice of Jesus said this
[40:43] Parry in the city of
[40:45] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[40:48] from on
[40:50] high this is what what what what people
[40:53] don't
[40:55] understand we understand and we give God
[40:58] thanks for the
[41:00] mountains we give God thanks for the
[41:03] valley we give God thanks for the
[41:07] ocean we give God thanks for the
[41:10] desert all of these are characteristics
[41:12] of
[41:14] God and God is
[41:17] identified and he is known by his own
[41:21] characteristics some people like to wear
[41:25] blue some people like to wear
[41:28] some people like to wear
[41:30] white the different colors that God has
[41:34] but we're all children of of
[41:37] God but this is what had to happen
[41:40] before the
[41:42] miracle they had to make things right
[41:44] one with the
[41:48] other if you want something to
[41:51] happen you got to make it right at home
[41:55] first you got to make it right in your
[41:57] heart first this is what our pastor was
[42:00] speaking about on
[42:03] Sunday we we we we get we get
[42:06] sidetracked and and we say there's going
[42:09] to be a
[42:10] Rapture and we give go God thanks for
[42:14] all of
[42:15] that but let me tell you we can know all
[42:19] about what God's going to
[42:21] do but unless we are ready to meet
[42:26] him let a message just go over our
[42:30] head and we won't do what God asked us
[42:33] to do on
[42:35] Sunday he told us that we had to
[42:39] repent you want God on the
[42:41] scene you want God in your life You' got
[42:45] to do what God asked you to do they were
[42:49] all in one
[42:51] Accord in one place when all of a sudden
[42:56] there was a great
[42:57] sound from
[42:59] Heaven if we want something to happen in
[43:02] our life we got God at his
[43:07] word now now Sunday to
[43:10] me I I I I was here on the
[43:14] platform and and as our pastor says
[43:17] magnify glorify the
[43:20] Lord feel myself go
[43:24] up I don't know about you but after
[43:28] Sunday we come up to another
[43:33] level now now I if people want to stay
[43:36] with their
[43:38] jealousies if people want to stay with
[43:42] backbiting that's up to
[43:44] them those that have wanted to to accept
[43:49] the message of the
[43:51] hour do what God wants them to do I
[43:55] believe that we have come up high
[43:59] now there's a reason why it was called
[44:01] The Upper
[44:04] Room I think brother FID feels better
[44:08] now I think brother F feels good
[44:11] now he did he did he didn't
[44:15] before but but knowing that he's going
[44:17] to be living in the upper
[44:20] room I know that we should be feeling
[44:23] good right
[44:25] now I know that we have a pastor the way
[44:28] we
[44:29] do a pastor that'll show us the
[44:33] way a pastor that will tell us when
[44:35] we're
[44:36] wrong a pastor that will show us his
[44:39] heart a pastor that will take us
[44:43] in this is what God wants to do in our
[44:48] generation
[44:50] Pentecost we have another time where we
[44:54] can be in one mind in one Accord in one
[44:58] place yes if we start
[45:02] being what we
[45:05] are now our
[45:08] character get us in
[45:11] trouble sometimes we' rather fight than
[45:16] switch I don't know about you but
[45:18] sometimes I fight with my
[45:21] shadow I talk to
[45:24] myself and I tell sometimes I answer
[45:26] myself
[45:29] sometimes I I the the you know why
[45:33] because the worst enemy that I
[45:35] have is nobody out
[45:38] there the worst enemy that I have is
[45:42] myself I've got to conquer Inner
[45:46] Space before I can think of outer
[45:50] space I've got to understand that the
[45:52] word of God is for
[45:55] me the word of God comes to change
[45:58] us from the inside
[46:02] out now I I I want to to to do this real
[46:06] real
[46:07] quick the prophet of God says
[46:10] this now I I I probably won't get to
[46:13] everything that I needed to get
[46:15] to and uh but that's all right I get to
[46:19] get to what what God wants me to get
[46:22] to brother brandham talks about
[46:25] this about moving up
[46:28] higher how how many want to move up
[46:31] higher you don't want to stay where
[46:33] you're at do
[46:34] you no no we we we don't want to stay
[46:37] where we're
[46:38] at if we're gonna stay where we're
[46:41] at we we we we could go do something
[46:44] else but if we're going to be a
[46:47] Christians let's go up
[46:49] higher follow the
[46:52] word you know the brother brandham calls
[46:55] Caleb
[46:57] he calls Joshua the end time
[47:02] leader and he calls Caleb the the type
[47:05] of the end time
[47:09] believer he's the True
[47:12] Believer you know why he's
[47:14] faithful you know why the Bible says he
[47:17] had a different
[47:19] Spirit In other words he had a different
[47:24] attitude while everybody said I can't
[47:28] he said we are more than
[47:30] able when everybody says we can't take
[47:33] the we cannot take
[47:35] it he's the one that after everything
[47:39] was
[47:41] conquered he comes up to
[47:43] Joshua and he tells them give me that
[47:47] mountain give me the most difficult
[47:50] Mountain that there
[47:51] is give me the place where those giants
[47:54] still
[47:55] live
[47:58] that's where I want so then
[48:01] Caleb is an
[48:03] attitude it's a new
[48:05] spirit it's a different
[48:08] Spirit we're we're proud to call Brother
[48:11] Caleb our
[48:13] pastor but not only brother Caleb is
[48:17] Caleb you are the end time
[48:20] believer call
[48:22] Caleb we got a different
[48:25] spirit
[48:27] attitude while everybody goes away and
[48:31] everybody
[48:32] runs we say give me
[48:35] that give me the most difficult
[48:39] job give me the job nobody else
[48:42] wants we are more than able to take to
[48:46] take the
[48:48] mountain but it but it costs
[48:51] us and every day you a person might say
[48:55] I'm I've been in the message for 40
[48:59] years it couldn't cost
[49:02] anymore you want to go
[49:04] higher it
[49:07] costs it cost it cost you want to stay
[49:11] where you're at it don't cost
[49:14] you you're you just sit down where
[49:17] you're
[49:18] at have the same rental
[49:22] agreement you're going to pay the same
[49:25] utilities
[49:27] you're going to pay the same uh service
[49:29] that you
[49:31] get but if you want to go up
[49:35] higher your mortgage is going to cost a
[49:37] little bit
[49:40] more your utilities are going to cost a
[49:43] little bit
[49:44] more what's it going to
[49:46] cost cost you your
[49:51] life what's it going to cost
[49:54] me well I can move over here
[49:58] sure you can and everybody thinks that
[50:01] over
[50:02] there The Grass Is Always Greener over
[50:06] there but they forget that that same
[50:08] grass still needs to be
[50:13] mowed oh over there I won't have no no
[50:17] trials but if you want to go up
[50:20] higher it will cost you but it'll cost
[50:24] you your
[50:25] life now what do we
[50:28] do I read this quote the other
[50:31] day and this quote just knocked my socks
[50:37] off
[50:39] yeah that's
[50:44] right now brother brandham is saying
[50:48] this he said they brought a little girl
[50:52] up a little Indian
[50:55] girl a beautiful little
[50:58] thing a little
[51:00] maid and her eyes real black
[51:04] shiny before I got before she got to
[51:08] me someone I believe it was a missionary
[51:13] brother brother Mitchell
[51:15] said she's
[51:17] blind and someone said down the
[51:20] line she's
[51:22] blind see them lead
[51:25] her
[51:27] along and brought her in front of
[51:30] me I prayed to our Heavenly Father for
[51:33] the
[51:34] child and I waved my hands in front of
[51:37] her
[51:39] face and those big black staring eyes
[51:42] just
[51:44] staring so then I
[51:46] thought poor little fellow has to go
[51:49] through life like
[51:52] that I put my hand back on her
[51:58] and seemed like that I
[52:03] left this sounds
[52:06] fanatically but it's true seemed like
[52:10] that I left the
[52:12] Earth and went in before the Throne of
[52:17] God there was the blood of Jesus
[52:20] Christ and I know the poor little Indian
[52:25] girl
[52:27] maybe couldn't understand
[52:29] English or know nothing
[52:32] else so seemed like that God opened my
[52:38] faith for the blood of the Lord
[52:42] Jesus and presented it to
[52:45] her now now you we
[52:49] we sometimes I'm not talking about
[52:53] myself sometimes I want to teach
[52:57] somebody about what we
[53:00] believe and they haven't been born
[53:04] again and they'll never see
[53:09] it if you can give
[53:12] somebody something they can
[53:16] see then they believe
[53:19] it now this is what I
[53:22] say that's why people will believe in a
[53:25] literal t
[53:29] because it's something they can
[53:30] see or something they can
[53:37] imagine there are people that can see a
[53:40] certain
[53:42] thing because they can see a certain
[53:45] thing they believe a certain
[53:48] thing but who could believe
[53:52] this this is
[53:54] Supernatural how that a man
[53:57] man on the earth can go into the
[54:00] presence of
[54:02] God the blood of Christ from the
[54:07] throne present it to a creature here on
[54:15] Earth can it
[54:18] be she opened up her eyes
[54:21] didn't this is what I don't understand
[54:24] about Malachi 4
[54:28] they believe in the
[54:30] Supernatural until it's something they
[54:32] cannot
[54:37] see this and this has got to
[54:41] happen really let me tell you one thing
[54:45] I believe in the tent but I believe that
[54:50] God stretched the tent to a human
[54:55] being that Jesus was the Tabernacle of
[55:00] God here on
[55:02] Earth he was the tent of God
[55:06] walking that's Supernatural isn't
[55:09] it this is what what what what it costs
[55:13] us we can see to a certain
[55:16] point until it costs
[55:19] us this to me is so
[55:25] outstanding what does it cost us to live
[55:27] a Christian
[55:30] Life we walk the Bible says by faith and
[55:34] not by
[55:36] sight yet the majority of Christians all
[55:39] they can walk through is by
[55:43] sight we've had people tell
[55:46] us we took your reservation out of the
[55:48] airplane because you don't believe
[55:53] it and I and I and I said since when
[55:56] were you the one that gave us that re
[55:58] that
[56:01] reservation I believe in the supernal
[56:04] work of
[56:07] God I believe the word of God just the
[56:10] way it is
[56:12] written I believe in the first
[56:15] pool I believe in the second pool I
[56:19] believe in the third po but the third
[56:22] pole has something to do with you and
[56:25] I when they want to take the bride away
[56:29] from the
[56:32] groom they just cut the body in
[56:36] half and when they tried to take the
[56:39] head away from the
[56:42] body it has become a monster in Malachi
[56:47] 4 what you saw
[56:50] Sunday was the union of
[56:53] Heaven and Earth that's what God
[56:57] does he unites one
[57:01] omnipotent with the other
[57:04] omnipotent one in heaven one on earth
[57:08] that's the
[57:13] supernatural can you if somebody needs
[57:16] something from
[57:18] you can you leave your
[57:23] body go into the presence of God
[57:28] take blood out off of the
[57:31] altar come back present it to a person
[57:35] in
[57:37] need and that person receive what they
[57:40] have from God
[57:42] they the only way that can happen is
[57:46] that God finds his
[57:49] rest if God has created a
[57:53] body and you are the mystical body
[57:58] jist now how does this
[58:02] happen you heard our
[58:04] pastor happens in the
[58:07] parable now when two omnipotents
[58:12] meet the Heavenly
[58:15] Angel and the Earthly
[58:17] Angel something's got to
[58:20] happen
[58:22] now could you believe February 28th
[58:29] 1963 a cloud comes into the desert of
[58:33] Arizona it wasn't just any any
[58:36] Cloud give me just your undivided
[58:38] attention for a few
[58:40] minutes it wasn't just any
[58:43] Cloud This Cloud came from
[58:49] eternity are you a Believer
[58:52] tonight I wish I had a believe some
[58:54] Believers tonight
[58:57] came from
[58:58] eternity the message that we have
[59:01] received was a message that came from a
[59:05] seminary it wasn't a message that came
[59:07] from a
[59:08] book the message that we have
[59:11] received straight from the back of the
[59:14] part of the mind of
[59:17] God to the heart of
[59:21] Believers but where are the Believers
[59:25] there
[59:27] sometimes our focus is
[59:29] this how much money I can
[59:32] make what I can
[59:35] drive where I can live and all of that
[59:38] is good we have to live some place we
[59:43] have to drive something we have to make
[59:46] money but that should not be our
[59:49] focus our focus should be this that we
[59:53] be in one place in one
[59:56] ACC that's the miracle of
[1:00:05] P God is calling us to a
[1:00:10] different if you didn't see that on
[1:00:13] Sunday you missed the whole
[1:00:15] message God calling us to go up
[1:00:20] higher God is calling us to for you to
[1:00:23] leave your
[1:00:24] drugs
[1:00:26] to leave your
[1:00:27] liquor to leave your ways of the
[1:00:31] world go up
[1:00:33] higher aren't you tired of the devil
[1:00:36] having you
[1:00:38] bound now a person says well I'm not I I
[1:00:42] don't have any of those those
[1:00:46] vices yeah but but maybe you come to
[1:00:49] church and you wish you were someplace
[1:00:54] else and the preacher says something
[1:00:56] you're
[1:00:58] like that's
[1:01:00] nice and the attitude will leave you
[1:01:04] where you were
[1:01:06] at in
[1:01:08] bondage but Caleb had a different
[1:01:16] attitud what's your attitude
[1:01:19] tonight we are more than
[1:01:24] Overcomers
[1:01:27] amen where was brother
[1:01:29] Jimmy Jimmy where was brother Jimmy
[1:01:33] Jimmy sister Rosita after 22
[1:01:36] days when you were laying there with
[1:01:41] Co intubated in the
[1:01:43] hospital where was brother Jimmy in the
[1:01:47] room no but you heard a voice and the
[1:01:50] voice said it's time to wake up
[1:01:54] Sister somebody had got to another
[1:01:57] dimension where only God and the person
[1:02:03] lives we're supposed to be a
[1:02:05] supernatural
[1:02:07] people we all encouraged by the things
[1:02:10] of the
[1:02:13] world and the world just do the
[1:02:17] lights they capture our
[1:02:19] attention that's why television is so
[1:02:24] exciting the attention in the
[1:02:28] imagination wow look at that
[1:02:31] woman she don't
[1:02:36] exist they've airbrushed her about 20
[1:02:40] times and you go to the gym to try to be
[1:02:44] somebody
[1:02:46] else of somebody's
[1:02:50] imagination a person that does not
[1:02:53] exist and so then we try to be then
[1:02:57] religious and we say you know what I'll
[1:03:01] be like the other church
[1:03:03] member and how come they get to do
[1:03:06] it but I can't do it let me tell you
[1:03:11] maybe you're at two different
[1:03:15] places down here and he's up
[1:03:19] there me and
[1:03:21] him could get into one
[1:03:24] Accord one place the spirit of God would
[1:03:30] raise us up into another
[1:03:33] level now this is where this is this is
[1:03:36] this this is to me is
[1:03:40] outstanding of the word of
[1:03:42] God the word of God is where is the
[1:03:46] place of my
[1:03:49] rest when brother Caleb has the
[1:03:52] vision and my my papa comes up to the to
[1:03:55] the where we're
[1:03:57] at and he hugs
[1:04:00] him it's because he had found
[1:04:10] rest
[1:04:12] Supernatural again he goes and hugs
[1:04:14] brother
[1:04:16] Caleb he's found
[1:04:18] rest where in the
[1:04:22] attitude in the
[1:04:24] spirit that's right
[1:04:26] who said that we couldn't make
[1:04:30] it who's the giant who's the person that
[1:04:33] said we could never make
[1:04:36] it let me tell you what our founding
[1:04:39] pastor
[1:04:41] says together if we stick together we
[1:04:46] make it
[1:04:47] together but it cost us a different
[1:04:51] attitude another
[1:04:54] Spirit not different because we want to
[1:04:56] be
[1:04:57] different but another Spirit a spirit
[1:05:01] that says yes we
[1:05:03] can now now my my time is coming is
[1:05:08] coming to to to an
[1:05:10] end but but I I trust that God will will
[1:05:13] will help
[1:05:15] you okay where where where are we at
[1:05:19] okay Jesus in the 17th
[1:05:23] chapter of the book of St Matthew
[1:05:28] the Bible says he was
[1:05:32] transfigured he was so
[1:05:35] transfigured that his clothes couldn't
[1:05:37] have that his clothes could not hold
[1:05:40] back the
[1:05:44] glory the Bible says his face shine like
[1:05:51] sun
[1:05:53] different was different
[1:05:56] he was
[1:05:58] transfigured he was
[1:06:01] transformed everything that that that
[1:06:04] there
[1:06:06] was all the
[1:06:08] adoption everything that he was supposed
[1:06:10] to

[1:06:15] transfigured when did this
[1:06:18] happen after six Church
[1:06:23] ages after 6,000 years
[1:06:27] what he could not do in his Corporal
[1:06:30] body all of a sudden he's
[1:06:35] transfigured
[1:06:38] translated to the
[1:06:40] resurrection that was what was it it was
[1:06:45] just the rehearsal of February 28th
