[17:37] mother there may God richly bless you
[17:40] and our sister uh Guardian Casa is from
[17:42] Minnesota it's good to have you with us
[17:44] God bless you
[17:48] amen you may be seated
[17:51] we're going to be asking our brother
[17:53] Julian Hill to come read his poem uh
[17:55] following what would be uh our sister
[17:57] Lula nahida amen and God bless you
[18:15] it's cold and there's a lot of people
[18:17] out sick but uh you all still look great
[18:20] so I'm happy to be here as long as
[18:21] you're happy to be here
[18:23] uh my Spanish poet is not here tonight
[18:27] he's actually out sick too brother no
[18:28] Reyes and so uh unfortunately I have to
[18:32] do this just in English tonight but
[18:34] um as with all the poems I want to give
[18:37] a bit of backstory for this one uh when
[18:40] I first started doing my poetry about a
[18:42] year ago I started to create works that
[18:46] were for for folks who weren't
[18:47] necessarily Believers but also for folks
[18:50] who were and uh when I would send them
[18:53] out and give them to people a lot of
[18:55] times uh I'd get statements like you
[18:58] know uh I'm an atheist but uh when I
[19:01] read your poetry I think about it
[19:03] and so it was it was an interesting
[19:05] thing and I really started to kind of
[19:06] identify where my work was meant to help
[19:09] and how to how to use it more but
[19:12] um this the reason why I say that is
[19:14] because this piece is is very much in
[19:16] line with that uh with that with that
[19:18] message and so uh for you all I have a
[19:21] book that I haven't published and I'm
[19:22] going to start reading it today and then
[19:25] in about five months we'll be done with
[19:26] it
[19:27] um but this is uh the book is titled all
[19:30] things natural a series of unnatural
[19:32] Poetics and this is the first poem in
[19:35] that piece and it is called in the
[19:38] beginning
[19:39] it is said that God made the heavens and
[19:42] the Earth through Power of the spoken
[19:44] word
[19:44] further he States let us make man in our
[19:47] image within the days of this creation
[19:48] that is to say if nature is of God and
[19:52] we are of God nay the spitting image of
[19:54] God then who is it we see when gazing
[19:57] upon such landscapes
[19:59] to gaze upon a landscape is breathtaking
[20:01] wondrous whether that be a landscape of
[20:04] Earth us or others regardless of what we
[20:07] look upon we still look at one thing the
[20:10] ever-living god in all his creation
[20:12] is like looking at someone's art that
[20:14] hangs in the museum wall we do not
[20:16] believe that the painting painted itself
[20:18] and hung itself there we believe that
[20:20] the artist who painted it hung it after
[20:22] making such a beautiful painting thus if
[20:25] we can extend our faith to an unknown
[20:27] unseen and unheard artist who uses the
[20:30] elements of oil and color then how can
[20:32] we not extend our faith to God creator
[20:34] of nature he who painted the greatest
[20:37] Beauties upon the greatest canvas a
[20:39] canvas of universal proportions defying
[20:42] all known knowledge it is terrible how
[20:44] much Faith some have in things that are
[20:47] it is terrible how much Faith some have
[20:49] and things that won't save them it is
[20:51] tragic that they will not once Ponder
[20:53] the existence of God
[20:55] they say beauty is in the eye of the
[20:56] beholder so who do we behold when
[20:59] looking upon the vastness of nature to
[21:01] whom was this piece sold Sid a while in
[21:04] this patch pasture and break the common
[21:07] mold turn the pages read the poems in
[21:10] search of precious gold God bless you
[21:14] [Applause]
[21:29] foreign
[21:38] I like to share a testimony with you for
[21:42] a few years ago
[21:46] and I think brother Caleb for allowing
[21:48] me to share it with you
[21:53] a few years ago I was asleep
[21:56] madrugada
[22:01] I don't remember if it was early in the
[22:03] morning
[22:06] and a voice uh woke me up
[22:09] and they told me
[22:11] Mr Lula
[22:17] do the thing
[22:18] with caution
[22:21] and through
[22:27] Bay
[22:31] the Veil
[22:35] there's something for you
[22:39] and when I woke up
[22:42] I said Lord is
[22:45] it was the voice of brother Tommy
[22:48] speaking
[22:50] and I am sure that it was his voice
[22:58] and I said Lord I don't know what it is
[23:00] but I know that it said caution
[23:05] but I don't know what
[23:07] by year
[23:08] they they
[23:14] um
[23:16] it sounded like the
[23:18] see
[23:19] yes
[23:23] and I went to the dictionary to look up
[23:25] this word
[23:29] and it means that this arrest for the
[23:32] ship is
[23:33] [Music]
[23:38] and I started to think well what is this
[23:41] is it that I am the ship
[23:44] and after a few years has passed
[23:50] and at my house
[23:53] I was sweeping the living room
[23:58] [Music]
[24:00] and when I was sweeping I looked to my
[24:03] table yes
[24:04] [Music]
[24:06] and I saw there sitting down brother
[24:09] Tommy and brother Bernie yeah
[24:15] and I was ashamed because when I was
[24:17] sweeping I turned and I looked and then
[24:18] I saw them sitting there yesterday
[24:26] I was kind of ashamed because they
[24:28] wouldn't speak or say anything to me
[24:31] [Music]
[24:33] yes and then after that a few years
[24:35] passed
[24:37] there were some conventions there in
[24:39] Albuquerque
[24:44] and brother Bernie was there in the
[24:46] hotel at the restaurant
[24:47] [Music]
[24:54] and I would pass back and forth and I
[24:57] really wanted to go tell him that I
[24:58] would see him and brother Tommy
[25:02] restaurant
[25:07] and I was a shame because he was there
[25:09] at the hotel in the restaurant by
[25:11] himself and I didn't want to go there
[25:14] after a while the brothers
[25:18] [Music]
[25:20] and I asked him brother may I speak to
[25:22] brother Bernie I'd like to ask him
[25:24] something
[25:27] he said yes sister go ahead there's no
[25:30] one here now you have the time
[25:33] [Music]
[25:38] and I told him I want to tell you
[25:40] something brother I've seen you and
[25:42] brother Tommy in my house
[25:45] you begin to speak to me other things
[25:48] and he wouldn't tell me
[25:54] within my heart I was asking if he was
[25:57] going to tell me but he didn't say tell
[25:58] me yesterday
[26:00] [Music]
[26:03] we begin to speak of brother banham and
[26:06] his family is
[26:10] and I forgot because I liked what he was
[26:13] telling me
[26:14] and at the end he finally told me
[26:22] and at that time the restaurant began to
[26:24] fill up and a lot more people started to
[26:26] come in
[26:27] with time
[26:32] I don't know how to sing I don't know
[26:34] how to write songs or to play
[26:36] musica but I love music
[26:41] [Music]
[26:42] one day I was playing uh
[26:54] [Music]
[27:05] and at the moment words begin to come
[27:08] down to my heart
[27:11] I began to write what came down to my
[27:13] heart yesterday
[27:19] and not knowing at that time at the bay
[27:23] the ship was coming to the bay
[27:30] and the next time I'm here I would like
[27:33] to share that song with you that was
[27:34] inspired by God to me
[27:37] and in that song it says what happened
[27:41] thank you
[27:44] [Applause]

[35:24] I said you're pretty good to me

[35:33] depends escucha amen
[35:36] I like men that know what they're
[35:37] talking about
[35:40] and in these times that we live in
[35:42] United States
[35:44] it's hard to find this man
[35:48] they they were talking to a man from
[35:51] Albuquerque
[35:53] and he goes to church with brother
[35:57] and he said I
[35:59] this this friend of mine came from
[36:01] Arkansas
[36:03] and he said that he's
[36:06] his Pastor really teaches the truth
[36:11] he preaches that doctors are of the
[36:14] devil
[36:15] Diablo and brother said
[36:19] hold it one minute
[36:21] he said we we've heard the very best
[36:25] come from Silver City
[36:30] and he said and uh we've been taught
[36:33] that doctors and Medicine ate nature
[36:39] and
[36:43] and medicine was
[36:45] given by God
[36:49] and people say well I don't need
[36:51] medicine
[36:52] that's good but don't blame somebody
[36:58] I don't need coffee
[37:01] I drink it but I don't need it
[37:04] and many people they need it
[37:08] God bless them hope it perks them up
[37:13] amen don't criticize some people say I
[37:18] gotta have a Coke today

[37:26] amen
[37:29] nothing against it
[37:31] we we get trouble with very minor things
[37:37] but it says here in the word
[37:40] don't let your heart be troubled
[37:43] you know the secret of life is success
[37:50] it is to
[37:53] not be burdened by so many little petty
[37:56] little things amen
[38:01] most of the diseases that we have in the
[38:04] world today
[38:07] come from
[38:09] stress being in the stress
[38:13] stress
[38:15] and stress can kill yeah
[38:19] they the doctors will tell you they
[38:21] don't know what causes high blood
[38:24] pressure but
[38:27] [Music]
[38:30] their clothes
[38:31] and the closest thing they come to is
[38:34] that stress causes high blood pressure
[38:37] is
[38:42] sometimes we're stressed because
[38:45] we're not sure we know where we're going
[38:51] we're not we're not certain and people
[38:54] say I don't want to go to hell
[38:58] nobody wants to go to hell no no we
[39:01] don't want to go to hell
[39:03] but don't let your heart be trouble
[39:06] believe in God you believe also in me
[39:11] and that in my father's house
[39:14] there are many mansions
[39:16] there's many mentions
[39:18] not just one no Solona so we we come to
[39:23] a very puzzling
[39:26] uh uh theme this is
[39:37] foreign
[39:43] and and and and and uh people will read
[39:46] it in the Bible
[39:48] and uh they come up with different
[39:51] little ideas of to how it's going to be
[39:56] in my Bible immediately in my Bible in
[40:01] media and the message that I read from
[40:04] the prophet
[40:06] I don't see how people can go without
[40:09] having the faithful Ministry
[40:14] if you just hear tapes
[40:17] and you should hear tapes
[40:19] but you're not you're not gonna get it
[40:23] because after the prophet because
[40:27] the apostles Apostles and the apostles
[40:35] so so churches that have pastors but
[40:37] don't believe in apostles
[40:47] sets the thing in order foreign
[41:26] because that's God's plan
[41:29] and he gives it he don't let just any
[41:33] preacher put it in order
[41:36] can preach but he cannot put it in order
[41:40] to get it from the apostles
[41:43] because he is the one and sets the thing
[41:48] in order
[41:52] I I heard a preacher in Mexico City one
[41:56] day say yes
[41:59] he said I don't believe brother Bernie
[42:01] is in a puzzle
[42:03] and I said why do you say that
[42:06] he said he doesn't have the
[42:08] qualifications
[42:10] I said sir may I ask you what is the
[42:12] qualifications of an apostle this
[42:15] qualifications I said you go here
[42:18] brother Bernie's tapes
[42:21] and see if he doesn't put the church in
[42:24] order
[42:26] hello
[42:28] I'll get scared with me right away
[42:31] I'm just telling you what the word says
[42:37] God gives it to everybody
[42:40] yeah in in its order
[42:44] of course he gives it to everybody
[42:47] but but you can be sitting in the in the
[42:51] church
[42:52] and you think you know more than the
[42:54] passengers
[42:56] well you might well but you won't rise
[43:00] any higher than him
[43:02] that's what the prophet said
[43:05] don't blame me for what he said
[43:08] I'm just repeating what he says
[43:11] so then we find that when we come to the
[43:16] to a theme like the Millennium
[43:20] like I heard a preacher not long ago
[43:23] said that the New Jerusalem was was
[43:27] going to be here in the millennium
[43:42] I said but if if you're referring to me
[43:45] that we all will live in that City
[43:50] in that City the New Jerusalem
[43:53] in in the Millennium in a millennium you
[43:56] got it all wrong
[44:48] he says
[44:50] Tang he said brother Tommy hermano Tomas
[44:55] I had never seen that
[44:57] I said that's why you must wait for the
[45:00] ark foreign
[45:20] it's like brother Branham with marriage
[45:22] and divorce
[45:24] you they asked him questions
[45:29] but when he went up the mountain
[45:32] and he came down he brought the answer
[45:36] to marriage
[45:39] he would not give it until God gave it
[45:42] to him first
[45:44] and then now we have it amen
[45:48] all right
[45:51] it's a theme that is so confusing with
[45:55] the people in this message
[45:59] they try to figure things out
[46:02] you can't figure that out you stand up
[46:05] it comes by revelations and it comes by
[46:09] representation
[46:10] and it comes by being by for ordination
[46:15] and it's something that is pre-planned
[46:18] of God
[46:19] and it's predestined yes and it's given
[46:22] by the word of knowledge amen
[46:26] yeah
[46:28] when you get it you got it and when you
[46:32] got it your heart is not troubled
[46:36] my heart is in trouble at all
[46:39] how's your heart brother
[46:42] I went to the doctor the other day
[46:45] and he says you're in good shape for 61.
[46:51] I said yes uh good lord is good is good
[46:55] with me
[46:57] and I I come from a line of longevity
[47:05] yeah my father lived to be almost 92.
[47:10] and my mother almost the same
[47:14] that's longevity
[47:17] I I remember when they checked my father
[47:21] his body when he had deceased
[47:26] the
[47:28] mortician said
[47:32] he he is a fine specimen he said all his
[47:36] organs work good
[47:39] correct
[47:45] good kidneys good liver that's good but
[47:51] no matter how good it is
[47:53] still has to die a man
[47:57] so we we come to to our
[48:01] a very puzzling uh scene
[48:07] and
[48:09] I I study this it's your studio is so
[48:12] under the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[48:14] and
[48:17] when when he opens it up for me
[48:22] I don't want to preach it I said they're
[48:25] not going to believe this you guys he
[48:28] it's easier to believe a lie than to
[48:32] give the truth away
[48:35] even with Christians uncle cristianos
[48:39] they they see
[48:42] this thing about God well I I don't have
[48:46] to please nobody I just have to please
[48:48] God
[48:52] well in the first place they've never
[48:55] seen God
[48:57] but they've seen the expression of God
[49:02] that's all we see
[49:04] God expressing himself
[49:08] so then if God expresses himself through
[49:12] a
[49:15] Persona you have to believe that
[49:19] Persona ah watch carefully
[49:22] when when it comes to the throne
[49:28] the throne is not something that is up
[49:31] in heaven no
[49:35] the throne is in the heart of the
[49:38] Believers
[49:40] explain that to me explain for God
[49:44] enthrones himself
[49:46] well then there's other people that say
[49:49] God has never in not yet enthroned
[49:54] himself
[49:59] speak for yourself
[50:01] don't speak for me for me
[50:08] there's no way that a man could take
[50:11] this out by himself
[50:14] it's like brother Branham said
[50:16] the Visions come
[50:19] he says now you know that I don't know
[50:22] you
[50:23] he says but it is not my thought anymore
[50:29] it is God's thoughts
[50:32] and I'm only expressing his
[50:36] how could I tell you what you did 10
[50:39] years ago when I never have seen you
[50:41] come over
[50:44] then wasn't brother
[50:47] that was God but you say you believe God
[50:55] Has Changed
[51:01] amen amen so then when you get that
[51:05] little piece straight out in your mind
[51:11] then you look to another thing
[51:15] that are kosas and things that are to be
[51:20] understood now a lot of people
[51:24] look to things that are coming or they
[51:27] study and they say oh when this comes
[51:30] Miracles
[51:32] and but they ignore one God is here
[51:36] today
[51:44] all they know is what he did yesterday
[51:46] what he's going to do tomorrow but
[51:49] ignoring what is happening right now
[51:51] amen
[51:57] could say so much on that because stay
[51:59] right there but I don't want to stay
[52:00] there
[52:01] things that are to be understood but
[52:05] things that are
[52:06] not things that happened
[52:09] but things that are happening
[52:12] they're happening but you have to have a
[52:16] spiritual eye to see them
[52:19] people say well when I get to the
[52:22] Millennium
[52:23] Millennial what if I told you I am in my
[52:26] Millennium
[52:28] oh people want to go out of the church
[52:30] tell us another brother Tommy believes
[52:32] the Millennium is here
[52:36] let me ask you a question first
[52:39] what is the Millennium Castle Millennium
[52:42] it's a thousand years of Peace
[52:45] amen it's peace in the valley
[52:49] but it is still time
[52:53] it is not Eternal the Millennium is not
[52:57] eternal Reposado
[53:15] are you resting
[53:20] or are you working
[53:22] well what about the scripture with the
[53:24] the Day comments where no man can work
[53:30] amen but we'll we'll get to that to that
[53:34] just keep that in in you
[53:38] what are we doing here in church
[53:42] because we believe
[53:44] some people say well I I don't believe
[53:46] it
[53:48] but if you ever believed
[53:51] then you would be different
[53:54] I I cannot be without being in church or
[53:57] with God's people
[53:58] believes
[54:01] because I believe
[54:03] and I congregate with Believers
[54:07] and this is my life
[54:09] this is not my life that I used to have
[54:14] this is a new life
[54:16] and this is the token yesterday the the
[54:20] blood is not the tokenya that was the
[54:24] blood age
[54:25] there was the water age
[54:28] there was the water age blood age and
[54:32] now the token age
[54:35] now the the blood of Jesus
[54:38] we know it went back to the elements
[54:42] but we we weren't looking for the blood
[54:45] of Jesus
[54:46] we were looking to the life that was in
[54:49] the cells of that word
[54:53] and that life yes returns back
[55:32] and you you have people of your own
[55:36] household
[55:39] amen that's why he that does not take
[55:43] care of his own and those of his own
[55:44] house whole is worse than an Infidel and
[55:47] the faith he is denied foreign
[55:52] amen
[55:59] because you have you you have right
[56:02] right now you say well but what what's
[56:04] going with me uh anyway when when uh the
[56:07] time comes uh God is going to anoint us
[56:11] here
[56:14] [Music]
[56:15] I'm not going to wait till that time
[56:17] comes to have to be anointed
[56:21] happens right now
[56:24] until I get to it
[56:27] you're waiting for something to happen
[56:30] when it's happening
[56:33] this is the Tabernacle
[56:38] this is a tabernacle no no no no no no
[56:41] no let me say it again
[56:46] is the Tabernacle
[56:49] now when when when people when confused
[56:53] little things here
[56:56] like we see the natural
[57:01] in the natural
[57:04] we see Israel Israel but in the
[57:08] spiritual spiritual we see the bride
[57:10] Muslim
[57:11] it's happened it's happening spiritually
[57:16] while we look at the naturals
[57:20] so why do they fight so much in Israel
[57:25] the Israelites the Palestines the
[57:28] Islamic
[57:30] Palestinians
[57:31] they all want control not so much of the
[57:36] city of Jerusalem they're just getting
[57:38] control no much
[57:40] they want control of the temple we're
[57:44] just getting control the temple there's
[57:46] a Temple there are you in temporary you
[57:49] can go in the Bible and find out about
[57:50] the temple
[57:52] you find that the temple
[57:55] was erected
[57:58] it's called Solomon's Temple
[58:02] Builders
[58:08] and then you find herod's Temple foreign
[58:30] was a figure of the Tabernacle in the
[58:34] wilderness
[58:37] and and the pattern that God gave for
[58:42] that Tabernacles
[58:47] it means a tent or a dwelling place
[58:53] and it had its specifications
[58:57] specifications as to how the temple was
[59:01] laid out
[59:03] that's why David said
[59:06] it is not right for us to to live in in
[59:13] have homes and my Lord he has his Abode
[59:17] in a tent is
[59:24] and that's when David said
[59:28] I'll build him a temple
[59:30] and the Lord and and that was
[59:33] inspiration by God yes when David said
[59:37] it so for Inspirations
[59:39] but God told David
[59:42] you cannot build me a house
[59:47] because you've shed so much blood
[59:51] but out of your loins
[59:54] there shall come for they sons and he
[59:59] shall build the temple
[1:00:02] now when when you see that
[1:00:05] we see that the temple was built
[1:00:09] very much like the tent or the
[1:00:12] Tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:00:16] right right
[1:00:18] but
[1:00:21] we Pere Nosotros
[1:00:24] don't have
[1:00:25] Tempo Temple
[1:00:28] build by the hands of a man
[1:00:32] we are cats templates
[1:00:36] watch carefully as we enter a little bit
[1:00:41] more into this Millennium
[1:00:44] and and put the what is separate
[1:00:51] separate the temple in Jerusalem or for
[1:00:56] Israel
[1:00:58] Israel and the Temple of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:02] now one is natural
[1:01:06] and the other one is natural but it's
[1:01:08] it's a spiritual Temple
[1:01:12] spiritual a man
[1:01:14] and when you speak about a throne
[1:01:17] you won't see it because you're you're
[1:01:20] going you're going to get I see so many
[1:01:23] preachers in this message
[1:01:27] and they say Well when some of them that
[1:01:31] believe on the return it is
[1:01:47] but it is connected
[1:02:01] and this pertains to the Jews yes that's
[1:02:05] why he speaks of the trumpets foreign
[1:03:02] Israel and we will sit on the throne of
[1:03:06] David and we'll we'll handle the Affairs
[1:03:08] of uh of Israel and we'll handle the
[1:03:11] Affairs if that be the case yes
[1:03:14] then why didn't God take this prophet
[1:03:22] and take him to Israel Israel to preach
[1:03:26] to the 144th house
[1:03:41] but when they find out
[1:03:44] which Moses and Elijah
[1:03:48] will introduce Ivan introducer this son
[1:03:52] of man is
[1:03:53] now here's the thing
[1:03:56] so you can put it together foreign
[1:04:32] and and in a party says he rested for a
[1:04:35] thousand years
[1:04:38] uh he didn't rest a thousand years
[1:04:41] his rest was interrupted
[1:04:45] so then he limited a day
[1:04:52] that he would rest
[1:05:01] Israel rest Israel this cancer how can
[1:05:05] they rest the other day they took 50
[1:05:07] tanks and moved them to a city and they
[1:05:09] shot killed a teacher with three
[1:05:12] students
[1:05:16] a man they're they're at war is
[1:05:20] they fight Belen for every inch of
[1:05:23] ground
[1:05:25] and that's the way a Christian has to be
[1:05:27] this is
[1:05:46] there's not a word in the Bible that
[1:05:49] will confirm that we are holy rollers
[1:05:53] but I'd rather be a Holy Roller than a
[1:05:57] non-holy rollers
[1:06:00] but I'm not a Holy Roller either
[1:06:04] I'm never alone
[1:06:07] where'd he get that word from
[1:06:11] Diablo people say well I have rolled and
[1:06:14] I've screamed he said
[1:06:17] that's fine
[1:06:19] nothing against that and that's not what
[1:06:22] makes the Christians
[1:06:29] there are many people
[1:06:32] who can't understand
[1:06:34] why we are so happy and free
[1:06:38] because we crossed over Jordan
[1:06:40] to canaan's Fairland
[1:06:43] that's what's the matter with me
[1:06:48] man
[1:06:49] so so we find this is that the the
[1:06:53] seventh day
[1:06:56] he Sanctified it
[1:06:58] showing that there has to be a seventh
[1:07:02] day
[1:07:03] for us
[1:07:06] that has to be a sanctification period
[1:07:12] sanctification sanctification amen
[1:07:16] and then and then the Earth
[1:07:20] receives a baptism of fire receiving
[1:07:22] bautism amen
[1:07:25] but the believer
[1:07:28] the bride La Novia she's getting her
[1:07:31] seventh day right now
[1:07:35] when she's raptured
[1:07:37] she's really not raptured
[1:07:41] to the seventh day paralysis
[1:07:45] she's raptured in the in until the 18th
[1:07:51] yes
[1:07:53] but she comes back
[1:07:57] because watch closely because the people
[1:08:01] that have died
[1:08:03] they are in the eighth it's done in in
[1:08:07] it's a holy convocation
[1:08:12] but they want to come back to the Earth
[1:08:17] they want to build homes hello
[1:08:23] why do you need to build a home if
[1:08:26] you've got a city
[1:08:31] you say well in the Millennium they
[1:08:33] won't kill but then they'll be and
[1:08:35] they'll let you know they won't die the
[1:08:38] Bible says the infant shall die at a
[1:08:40] hundred years old
[1:08:45] read the 65th chapter of the book of
[1:08:47] Isaiah say
[1:08:50] well well the bride won't die I never
[1:08:54] said
[1:08:55] she's not the only one is going to be in
[1:08:58] the Millennium
[1:09:00] there are nations that are going to be
[1:09:02] there are people
[1:09:07] but God would have established his
[1:09:10] throne amen
[1:09:13] and then and then you find other people
[1:09:16] and they say well Jesus I'm sorry I'm
[1:09:20] gonna give you a name
[1:09:23] good friend of mine
[1:09:25] it with him
[1:09:27] [Music]
[1:09:29] good good friend I stay in his home when

[1:09:43] [Music]
[1:09:46] and and she said now brother Tommy she
[1:09:51] said I make the best pecan piece
[1:09:56] and she said because the prophet said I
[1:09:58] did yeah

[1:10:20] when you preach
[1:10:23] he said
[1:10:26] Jesus I was preaching for brother
[1:10:28] carpenters
[1:10:29] and he said you said Jesus
[1:10:33] literal body will not sit in the throne
[1:10:37] in the Millennium
[1:10:40] I said not not the little body of Jesus
[1:10:44] Jesus I said I I I can show you the
[1:10:47] description

[1:11:09] [Applause]
[1:11:11] I said you gotta be Jesus Jesus he's
[1:11:15] resting
[1:11:17] and that Jesus in me is resting is
[1:11:28] that's the Jesus this is Jesus inside of
[1:11:31] me
[1:11:32] and he says Cali Bartow already picked
[1:11:36] these things up
[1:11:38] same messages
[1:11:42] he says I don't hear very many people
[1:11:45] preaching on that
[1:11:47] I said because they don't believe it
[1:11:51] they they can separate
[1:11:54] said Jesus lives in you
[1:11:57] absolutely absolutely well what what
[1:12:00] lived in brother random this is
[1:12:03] Jesus Jesus Jesus
[1:12:06] had an office for brother Brown Jesus
[1:12:10] I said absolutely the absolutely but
[1:12:13] Jesus says in office for me I said you

[1:13:02] he does in his house what God ordains
[1:13:06] him to do
[1:13:08] but in my house foreign
[1:13:51] [Music]
[1:14:29] he didn't even know him
[1:14:33] Paul never met Jesus
[1:14:36] yet he said he was crucified
[1:14:40] how could he say that
[1:14:43] because he came to the visions and
[1:14:47] Revelations
