[12:35] uh
[12:50] shalom my precious
[12:53] brother
[12:56] our
[12:59] beloved
[13:01] founder of siddha he is church of the
[13:04] cross
[13:07] i took this opportunity to
[13:11] appreciate you
[13:12] and let you know how
[13:15] much we do value you
[13:17] just because of what
[13:19] you felt
[13:21] for africa it has been
[13:24] out of
[13:25] the vision of brother branham
[13:29] that equipped you to have a feeling
[13:34] for africa
[13:35] i would really want to say that
[13:39] there was no way out
[13:42] that i would ever know you
[13:45] and you'd ever know me
[13:49] if our prophet
[13:53] never had a feeling for africa
[13:57] and i also know that it was not our
[14:00] prophet
[14:03] willing to be coming to africa but the
[14:06] lord jesus himself wanted to come to
[14:08] africa
[14:10] i have read his quote
[14:13] where many
[14:14] times brother branham
[14:18] wanted to come to east africa even to
[14:21] uganda
[14:23] but the religious order of his day
[14:27] and the law
[14:29] of his day would not permit him
[14:32] to come
[14:36] and yet
[14:37] the spirit was willing
[14:41] in this regard
[14:46] every every man would get to have a
[14:49] feeling that
[14:52] there were souls
[14:54] that were entangled in the land of
[14:56] africa
[14:58] that would one day need to hear
[15:01] the omega voice of our lord jesus
[15:06] this would make
[15:08] evil men
[15:09] and willing men
[15:11] risks their lives
[15:14] to travel to the jungles of africa
[15:19] i am particularly
[15:21] giving my voice to you because of how
[15:24] much
[15:26] we have been touched by
[15:28] the love of your sons
[15:32] and they assure shape many sides that
[15:34] they have always struggled with
[15:36] brother caleb
[15:38] and brother tommy jr
[15:42] i have always
[15:44] tried so much to think of them
[15:48] how they would risk
[15:51] their lives
[15:54] to travel and come to uganda and most of
[15:57] all
[15:58] dare their lives
[16:00] [Music]
[16:01] to reach
[16:04] this part of our country that has been
[16:06] named
[16:09] a place of rebellion in history
[16:13] many people have been murdered maine
[16:18] different kind of atrocities until
[16:22] our land which is actually land
[16:26] is in the world map as
[16:29] an area that has been
[16:32] constantly in war and
[16:35] the people that are on good looks so
[16:37] fierce and
[16:39] hard
[16:41] to stay with
[16:43] and indeed even from within uganda
[16:46] many missionaries have always been
[16:48] stopped from reaching our locality
[16:53] but this
[16:55] did not make any sense no matter how
[16:59] perhaps they may have also been told the
[17:01] area is hard it didn't make any sense
[17:05] to your two sons brother caleb and tommy
[17:08] and the team that travel with
[17:11] to them live or die
[17:13] they had to reach
[17:15] even in dark
[17:17] they had to travel they wouldn't know
[17:18] where they were going but they were
[17:20] determined
[17:21] i truly see the spirit of caleb in caleb
[17:26] that great army in the days of joshua
[17:30] that little spirit that stuck and
[17:33] quieted
[17:36] all the negative testimonies
[17:40] that were rising against
[17:42] the promise
[17:45] truly brother caleb
[17:47] while i talk to dad
[17:49] i don't
[17:51] leave you in this regard
[17:53] i truly know that
[17:56] like we have always said
[17:58] this time ground
[18:00] you didn't just come because there is a
[18:02] feeling for africa but you came
[18:06] because god had already appointed
[18:09] you for this time
[18:14] brother thomas
[18:17] junior our dad
[18:19] i want to say this
[18:23] i don't know how long you're going to
[18:24] spend yet living with us
[18:27] but even if you go
[18:30] be assured that
[18:33] we love you
[18:34] we cherish you
[18:36] we feel like i told brother caleb
[18:40] i would be very glad to shake a hand
[18:42] with such a man of this
[18:45] kind
[18:48] i believe
[18:49] brother tommy brother caleb is a
[18:51] reflection of your own ministry
[18:54] the nature of their balance that they
[18:56] have always had
[18:58] men who don't drug
[19:00] walls around them
[19:03] they are not
[19:05] always for the doctrines that they
[19:08] uphold
[19:09] they don't help you because
[19:12] you are right with their own doctrine
[19:16] they want to build the unity
[19:21] the faith that we have regardless of
[19:23] factions and
[19:26] kinds of pool here and there
[19:29] i believe that was what our lord jesus
[19:32] christ was when he came in the land of
[19:34] israel
[19:36] he was not to pull punches with
[19:39] samaritans and the jews
[19:41] he was to unite them though he failed
[19:44] according to the prophecy
[19:47] they desired
[19:48] no unity at all
[19:51] but his attitude was to
[19:53] to make them be united
[19:56] same thing when brother branham came he
[19:59] could not
[20:00] have
[20:01] disregards to those anti-denominations
[20:04] in rural peruse through their ranks
[20:07] and would appear to lead
[20:10] point people to christ
[20:13] then he made the statement that that was
[20:15] his
[20:16] very purpose
[20:18] was to make men have good standing and
[20:21] relationship with christ
[20:23] i'm sure everyone
[20:26] who is well built
[20:27] in the like faith we think so
[20:30] i witnessed this in the ministry your
[20:33] brother told me and brother caleb
[20:37] something that
[20:38] keeps me warm
[20:40] keeps me
[20:41] [Music]
[20:42] always looking unto the end
[20:46] of god's program
[20:49] i failed to give
[20:51] my appreciation to you
[20:54] before you leave us
[20:57] any day that you believe us
[21:00] my words
[21:02] will remain
[21:05] as
[21:06] an appreciation from a jolly land
[21:09] in which
[21:10] [Music]
[21:12] the hills church of the cross have
[21:13] invested a lot of funds
[21:16] in different times in circumstances that
[21:18] they have never even thought they would
[21:20] be involved in
[21:23] they came in with the purpose of doing
[21:25] the translation but they have ended up
[21:27] doing quite more than those
[21:29] and they do willingly
[21:32] they have become part of us particularly
[21:35] me as
[21:37] brother barcelo
[21:40] i have become
[21:42] a very family
[21:44] my brother caleb and brother tommy
[21:46] in many ways they have done so
[21:50] when the crisis
[21:52] came
[21:54] the pandemic came in
[21:57] they had to send in a lot of help
[22:00] to help here and there
[22:03] surely like i told brother caleb
[22:06] this
[22:07] happened
[22:09] at the time when god had already given
[22:13] the way out
[22:15] and the way out here is
[22:17] you came in not that you really have a
[22:19] lot of fans
[22:21] you came in
[22:22] i told brother caleb
[22:25] because there was a crisis ahead of time
[22:28] it would be very difficult you know our
[22:30] poor status
[22:32] we are poor material yes but
[22:35] god has given us
[22:37] the spiritual
[22:39] and as long as we're in the body
[22:43] we do have a feeling when we are hungry
[22:46] when we are thirsty when we are naked
[22:49] when we are afflicted by diseases
[22:51] we still have the feeling attached our
[22:54] physical bodies
[22:55] and someone
[22:57] standing to help us and clothe us and
[22:59] help us here and there
[23:01] would it be possible
[23:05] especially at this time
[23:07] that the world is shut
[23:09] things are not moving would it be
[23:11] possible for us to survive quite well
[23:15] though we don't have all that we want to
[23:17] have
[23:18] but they have done what is recommendable
[23:22] that a child god can do to a fellow
[23:25] brother and sister
[23:28] i want to say as i conclude
[23:31] your vision
[23:32] for
[23:34] africa a continent that was described by
[23:40] those who try to understand about it as
[23:43] a dark continent
[23:45] that continent according to them is that
[23:47] they didn't know much about it until
[23:50] explorers came
[23:53] and when they knew they found their
[23:55] people there
[23:57] and the people
[23:59] have black colors
[24:01] but they have the very soul the spirit
[24:04] and the blood
[24:06] that brother braham said we can
[24:08] transfuse our own blood and we still
[24:10] look alike
[24:12] many tried to put them to look like
[24:14] animals but brother branham refused it
[24:18] oh
[24:20] this is the place your heart has always
[24:24] been
[24:25] and
[24:27] finally
[24:30] your son had to come to accomplish
[24:34] with great love happiness joy
[24:37] and
[24:38] real yearning
[24:40] to see you
[24:41] i now send my voice to you and i say
[24:45] actually land greets you
[24:48] we cherish
[24:50] every effort
[24:52] that you have always put
[24:54] through your sons and the members in

[52:44] i'm just going to speak to you about my
[52:45] life
[52:46] i can't give you anything more
[52:48] me vida only my life
[52:52] i was in church
[52:57] around 12 years it is
[53:00] and since the time i started coming to
[53:02] church
[53:03] i started serving
[53:05] [Music]
[53:08] and it comes to a point in la vida in
[53:11] life
[53:12] cristiano
[55:47] the same thing happens
[55:50] oh i can make it on my own
[55:52] a month goes by
[55:54] a year goes by
[55:56] two years go by
[56:00] and one starts figuring it out
[56:04] that i cannot do it on my own
[56:07] that you need of god
[56:13] the word of god
[56:41] and the only thing that will come out of
[56:43] that system
[56:50] those are those animals
[56:53] haven't you ever seen a cistern
[57:10] the rope
[57:14] that's the way we would take out water
[57:17] [Music]
[57:19] and at times we would then bring out
[57:21] animals
[57:23] because the water is no longer flowing
[57:27] the word of god has to flow
[57:30] the word god has to operate
[57:34] the only way that it can flow
[57:37] when you start moving
[58:33] and that's what we have to know
[58:38] [Music]
[59:07] [Music]
[59:44] that's what the devil wants us to think
[59:49] that we we enjoy life at maximo to the
[59:52] maximum

[1:02:08] to make it all possible
[1:02:11] to be able to come out of that cage
[1:02:16] the only thing is that she would beat
[1:02:17] herself up
[1:02:32] we try and try and do what we want to do
[1:02:35] but we beat ourselves up

[1:08:34] there was a time when
[1:08:36] in the northern part of israel
[1:08:39] [Music]
[1:08:43] in sumeria and las vegas
[1:08:46] they were surrounded by syria uh
[1:09:03] stuck in problems
[1:09:16] but when we're stuck for a long time
[1:09:46] and spent 40 years in the wilderness
[1:09:50] so he could let go of all his knowledge
[1:09:54] but our god brothers
[1:09:58] we're serving this morning
[1:10:27] we have fellowship one with another
[1:10:29] demos

[1:12:35] when these four leopard men were there
[1:12:41] the enemy had already left
[1:12:44] syria had already left syria
[1:12:47] but they were still stuck
[1:13:40] the samaritans were happy there
[1:13:43] but they were safe
[1:13:57] they wanted to be safe
[1:14:01] but they weren't willing to come out of
[1:14:02] the city
[1:14:05] because they were seeing the enemies out
[1:14:07] there why would we go
[1:14:11] and many times that's how we
[1:15:08] i
[1:15:22] is

[1:19:00] we want our new birth
[1:19:03] but we feel like we need more time to
[1:19:06] make a decision

[1:29:19] it says like this is
[1:29:22] 40 years old was i
[1:29:25] when moses the servant of the lord sent
[1:29:27] me from caddish barnea
[1:29:34] to spy out the land
[1:29:37] and reconoce brought him word again as
[1:29:39] it was in my heart
[1:29:44] nevertheless my brethren that went up
[1:29:47] with me made the heart of the people
[1:29:49] melt
[1:29:50] [Music]
[1:30:06] surely the land where on thy feet have
[1:30:08] trodden shall be thine inheritance
[1:30:14] and my shoulders forever
[1:30:17] because thou hast holy followed the
[1:30:31] the lord has kept me alive
[1:30:46] kept
[1:30:58] the lord spoke his word unto moses
[1:31:15] four score and five years old
[1:31:21] yet i am as strong this day
[1:31:25] yes i was in the day that moses sent me
[1:32:10] we ask it in
[1:33:06] to give the land out to each tribe
[1:33:11] give every tribe their portion
[1:33:15] now that's chapter 13
[1:33:19] now i can imagine
[1:33:28] he started to wonder what was going to
[1:33:29] happen to this hebron mountain comments
[1:33:35] you know god has spoken to him 40 years
[1:33:38] before that
[1:33:41] through moses
[1:33:43] when he got had gone out to spy out the
[1:33:46] lamb
[1:33:48] he saw
[1:34:02] that was what god wanted foreign
[1:34:06] not only that
[1:34:08] but moses had spoken with him
[1:34:12] he had promised it to caleb
[1:34:16] he had served this mountain will belong
[1:34:18] to you and your children
[1:34:23] it was god's promise
[1:34:26] so he had waited
[1:34:29] i can imagine him waiting with with
[1:34:31] anxiousness in his heart
[1:34:35] that was the thing that was the vision
[1:34:39] that he was waiting on
[1:34:42] so when they started crossing over
[1:34:44] jordan
[1:35:11] it's one thing to conquer someone
[1:35:26] like taking
[1:35:42] i'm sure he was happy
[1:35:44] when they conquered jericho
[1:35:49] over more and more
[1:36:09] so i can imagine him being a little
[1:36:12] nervous
[1:36:16] when he heard that joshua was pretty
[1:36:19] much done
[1:36:20] doing what god had asked him to do
[1:37:18] unconquered
[1:37:22] now aura
[1:37:23] as i look at caleb miranda
[1:37:28] he's not done yet el no es a terminado
[1:37:32] [Applause]
[1:38:54] he didn't care what the other young men
[1:38:55] were doing
[1:39:28] [Music]
[1:39:41] [Applause]
[1:39:50] so
[1:39:50] this is
[1:39:52] what caught my attention
[1:39:57] [Applause]
[1:39:59] now i want you to
[1:40:01] to go with me to verse 10.
[1:40:04] yes
[1:40:05] caleb is speaking here
[1:40:08] he recalls the promises of god
[1:40:13] and then he says he does this and now
[1:40:17] behold
[1:40:18] out of the end
[1:40:20] and you know what the word behold means
[1:40:24] it means pay close attention
[1:40:34] listen behold
[1:40:37] out of yen
[1:40:39] the lord hath kept me alive
[1:40:45] now this is this is what i see in caleb
[1:41:01] there's promises that god has made
[1:41:44] oh
[1:41:58] can
[1:43:00] [Applause]
[1:43:19] she was caught in adultery
[1:43:22] and they brought
[1:44:17] penis
[1:44:19] [Music]
[1:44:20] [Applause]
[1:44:22] they brought her to jesus
[1:44:26] jesus
[1:44:28] says
[1:44:29] he said that we should stone this woman
[1:44:31] to death
[1:46:19] [Music]
[1:46:24] but mercy rewrote
[1:46:38] she should have been
[1:47:06] the lord talks about how
[1:47:08] the levite went through the priests went
[1:47:10] through el senor
[1:47:15] none of them could help him
[1:47:19] but then came a good samaritan
[1:47:26] are you glad
[1:47:31] i am that person
[1:47:34] is
[1:48:02] the devil
[1:48:28] it was a good samaritan i don't plan
[1:49:26] alive
[1:49:29] now this is the time
[1:49:32] this is the time
[1:49:34] the devil tried to kill me
[1:49:37] the devil tried to bring me down
[1:49:40] many years
[1:49:53] is
[1:49:56] [Applause]
[1:50:06] i want to tell you something
[1:50:16] [Applause]
[1:50:17] [Music]
[1:50:18] [Applause]
[1:50:48] the day that the pillar of power was
[1:50:51] photographed in houston
[1:50:56] in houston and he says and now that
[1:50:58] pillar of fire that's in the picture
[1:51:05] the night that it is taken was in at
[1:51:07] houston at the sam houston coliseum
[1:51:13] houston we've been having about eight
[1:51:15] thousand at music hall
[1:51:17] at the music hall
[1:51:19] up
[1:51:21] and went over there that night with
[1:51:22] about 32 000.
[1:51:26] but they had asked me for a baptism
[1:51:31] to hold a debate with him on divine
[1:51:34] healing
[1:51:38] so there was this baptist minister
[1:51:43] that wanted to debate with the prophet
[1:52:01] i don't believe in fussing with with
[1:52:04] people you know
[1:52:07] the gospel wasn't made to fuss about
[1:52:12] oh when i was first ordained in the
[1:52:14] baptist church i thought i was the
[1:52:16] defender of the faith
[1:52:21] and sword
[1:52:22] so i found out no man and jesus come to
[1:52:24] me except my father draws him and says
[1:52:35] so see you argue with people they're set
[1:52:38] in their ways or they wouldn't be
[1:52:39] arguing
[1:52:42] personas
[1:52:44] so he wanted me to take one night to
[1:52:47] debating
[1:52:51] the
[1:52:52] houston chronicle
[1:52:55] i believe was the name of the paper
[1:53:00] they wrote it up
[1:53:02] and he put a paid ad in there
[1:53:09] what we was made out of them
[1:53:15] we was afraid to force that we were
[1:53:17] afraid to force the gospel by the word
[1:53:20] change the gospel by the word of god
[1:53:23] to that we were afraid to face the
[1:53:25] gospel by the word of god
[1:53:32] and i said
[1:53:34] i do not argue
[1:53:36] argument i just got so many nights to be
[1:53:39] here
[1:53:42] and i've got two more nights left
[1:53:45] and there's tens of thousands of people
[1:53:47] here to be prayed for
[1:53:51] why would i waste a night just on some
[1:53:54] critic
[1:53:58] let him go go ahead they can run past
[1:54:01] jesus said let them alone jesus
[1:54:04] the blind needs the blind
[1:54:35] if it wasn't for a caleb
[1:54:38] this debate would not have happened
[1:54:42] and the pillar of fire pilar de fuego
[1:54:45] would not have been photographed on that
[1:54:47] day no virus
