body of our Lord Jesus Christ and we are the Bride of the Lamb not that we are going to be yes we already are The Vow is what uh I'm going to have that vow with the Lord and it is an amen to all of the words I believe we are all assure of that you may take your seats we'd like to greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ thank the Lord for allowing me to be here along with myself to be in this place this is our our second home it must be new America with our children all of you and this is our second home foreign like to greet the ministry local government friend brother Tomas Perez my friend was Abraham Perez his family Mr Ruth from our proposal her husband yeah okay all the congregation of Cedar Hills I am grateful for the invitation this Sunday service The Voice the Eternal Word Of The Lord the world begins to remember a day of residence he's no longer dead he lives no longer in Jerusalem but in each one of us foreign that is not sick foreign We are continuing we'll enter into the word of the Lord beforehand will direct ourselves in prayer and if you have a petition a need some answers that you're seeking from the Lord tell the Lord when we make our prayers take my need into account beloved father Lord we come before standing in our post of Duty as a Believer not as an assistant of a church but as a witness of your great residence seeing you work in your people that's the same yesterday today and foreign bless your word that we will voice this morning that it may run and they may be glorified Healing The Sick delivering the unbelievers and increasing the faith in The Believer we report ourselves to service the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Our Lord amen we will be using two scriptures beginning with the first one Romans chapter 8 verse in John 5 24 is very well-known scriptures by all of us I'll go a bit slow okay I'm entering into 80s we're going too fast we have to slow down to 40s we have to go a bit slower but Abraham yes we're twins there going the same speed it's what gives us the assurance and things and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose [Music] for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren verse 30. moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called in whom he called them he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say there what then say to these things of God before us who can be against us and go to John chapter 5 verse 24. fairly verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me as everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death unto life foreign and when you have an assurance of something we only wait for the time where the results May Come so that the Fulfillment of the scripture can be realized completely I believe that is what gives us the Assurance we are not here just to be here we don't come just we come because we know who we are is so here's a representation of the faith without faith it's impossible it is impossible to please God but to please the Lord to see the children of faith that we are sitting this in to be able to say Amen to all of the word of the Lord scripture in John 5 24 makes a very clear affirmation this is my word not he that reads there's many people that are very good readers but we were not very good hearers but God wants us to have more faith than knowledge a reading it gives us knowledge but Faith gives us Revelation and that's why we must come to here and hearing by the word of God brother Branham says Israel and the Red Sea himself the same yesterday today and forever and it is why we know that we are serving God brother Branham says when you serve your brother you are serving God you don't visit them but when you see him oh my brother the prophet said if I've seen a Pharisees it is that person you have to love and the goodness before God we're all the same person and God is no respecter of person sure you have to do what he tells you to do foreign and now we are grateful foreign by the leadership of the Holy Spirit the greatest thing God has done today is that the Holy Spirit took the leadership with man today the Holy Spirit cannot guide if he does not have the best by which he can act in bringing the word he used the prophet a prophet comes the word to feed the people he uses a pastor non-profit not a prophet a pastor is one who feeds and to govern the home he is the governor of the home but now Satan he put women to govern president a women to be president in the home they are the boss but I'll let him know that you came to visit they recognize their position today everyone believes and they're like an automatic car you just press the gas and you go mechanical but in the old times they use a manual yeah foreign and with a new car you run so fast but you don't get to where you need to go [Music] we are grateful for the leadership of the Holy Spirit but the holy spirit is not a little dove flying around the holy spirit is a person that identifies with his words giving known to us is through the ministry Glory it's amazing brother the Holy Spirit I felt a little noise happen ing no the holy spirit is a person outside of that it cannot be this the holy the Holy Ghost will speak see in and hear the past is representing the Holy Spirit what form does the Holy Spirit when the man is the man of the house what form does the Holy Spirit and when the children know their positions what form does the Holy Spirit the people believe that they know the Holy Spirit but they do not know who he is the holy spirit is the word of God and the Heart of the believer outside of that it cannot be yes the Holy Spirit good night to know that it is the truth and the Holy Spirit everything must be scriptural or it is not legal it is we can speak a lot of things but if we don't speak accordingly is his word we know Jesus Christ is the Seed of Abraham you know and we being dead in Christ we take of the seed of abrahamas and we are heirs according to the promise the first thing we must know is that we are heirs to have the right to the promise no one is an heir but the child or adopted but how many know we all fell short from the glory of God but through Jesus Christ the only son of God we were adopted with the same rights that the Lord Jesus Christ Our older brother you'll be a young man a young lady once again you shall live forever with Christ Jesus only we have that promise here in a condition uh by a condition of sex but potentially we have eternal life this since you believe you were sealed foreign it looks uglier every day so take advantage of your youth nosotross as people as much we're absolutely men and women when we return to this earth will be as a man and as women but I asked how many men are left how many women are left the world is you don't know what side they're on anymore foreign the Lord Jesus Christ we have to see the stages that this message brings us through this message brings us to grace and grace has five parts for five stages it is the process is but be perfect as your father who is in heaven is perfect when that which is perfect now which is in part will be taken away at a time we were perfect but the promise to the original position so this message this message of the words restores all things well the whole world is in the evangelicals they call themselves but the bride does not live she is the word taken from the gospel so I think in the process of perfection first this justification first you have to go through justification by faith on Wednesday we had a wonderful wonderful message the justification it is what declares you never sinned you never did it you are not guilty Les guilty is when you know to do the right not because you were born so you know to do the right things and you don't do them God justifies where you did not know but when you came to know that's when you are responsible olympios when Adam and Eve were clean Justified there is no wickedness there was nothing but the moment they obtained knowledge they could not be justified because and he does not do it Adam and Eve could not they they did not know but when they did it that is a answer for all of the words so the first thing is sanctification sanctification produced by the blood of God you cannot be justified sanctification was by the blood the origin of sincre Julia which is unbelievable unbelief has proofs spoke to be an adulterer to cheat that is attributes but when you are born again you cease to do those things you then came to receive the nature you had before the foundation of the world you had the nature of God because we are his children and in this message it's when we came to know the genetics when had you heard about predestinations just known as children of God Children of the devil and this but we didn't know that before only in this message the Lord where we are where we come from where we are going where we go back to and the new birth is by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that changes our nature from sex to the word our first born birth our second birth was by the word how many have been born by the word it's why we can distinguish it we can recognize it a change of nature is our next step Perfection Perfection through the Seven Virtues of Faith to love that Perfection could not have come but only in this age after the seven Church ages and now which is perfect that which is in part will be taken away prophecies all but the word of the Lord and what crowns your process of your spiritual growth more love is Amor because God is love see in espanol in Spanish you are of Rome it is in Spanish you you switch the words around and in Reverse it spells Rome have you seen that is right down love in Spanish or one of its daughters and faith is the glorification the Seal of the Holy Spirit to be able to have resurrection and Rapture so then the bride it is the perfect work of Godly Untouchable she who is from Genesis that came from the mouth of God the Bible says whom he justified these are for those who have a spiritual mind is maintain okay there's a difference between the Mind spiritual mind to knowledge knowledge it vanishes when a person becomes foreign because they're they're embarrassed that they'll consider them a Evangelical but a Son of God they are a son of the king they are a son of the world what is that teacher in a way to refer ourselves to the people I tell you I was in a high atmosphere in society I was there as a judge would someone call you a doctor and you'd get inflated you like like you look like a toad when it inflates itself but when God takes you to the altar yes it takes the wind out of you yeah you realize you're a miserable sinner when God had mercy of we are nobody is the Bible says damn he also glorified is that correct we have our we are already typical we're Justified we are glorified potential potentially yes God is glorified foreign for him to come for us but we won't leave with these coats that we have on this has to be left here is saying hurry up hurry up the transformed body is if we justify them we are already glorified in his State not that he will do it he has already glorious listen to this isn't it that is [Music] potentially we are already there there's no devil nothing no no nothing that can take it what do we wait for people waiting for the last one to enter it has been predestinated for us I want to go who's holding back here if I come here you're not comfortable in any place this Earth is no longer for us we have to yearn the correct and the that which is perfect you have made you a father no I will do it is already done it is I've done it in in your old age you're saved I have already done it I have said it you have nothing to do with it it is unconditional got determined to have his church each time can I break with his Covenant with men those have been called to this message it is because they are Bride of the Lamb within that college classes there are three kinds of Believers God needs to put the unbelievers to prove our love to prove our patience it all has a purpose When God says he's done something cannot wait for it to be done when man says he will do it no [Music] is it is not being done well anymore because God fulfills what he says well he promises I'll see you at 8 in the morning at the bank to give you a blessing you wait for him all day brother what happened I forgot God does not do that before you get there God is already there [Music] I told Abraham I will say and Abraham not only Abraham unconditionally foreign foreign the confidence of God towards his children [Music] you say this is what the word says this is what the prophet says and you you don't change and you always say thus saith the Lord knows where he stands he knows where the end of it is but the blood of Jesus Christ I had the opportunity to forgive him in time so God had glorified whom he had Justified glorification that fills me with joy that I'm glorious that is a step to be a Christian and you are Justified of all of your future he glorified the church increased in Christ [Music] you are glorified in Christ in Christ but what by what God is he already paid for history he dressed his bride he determined again he doesn't have to be worried to see who's missing yes we are already Justified we are already glorified we are now the church ready for the Rapture that we await you have to have your own convictions now the pastor will remind you who you are but you have to know who you are Corinthians so that we can be close perfecto entrance but when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away brother says by the grace of God what we have now is it is perfect don't wait for another person the message is the perfect Nino when I was a child I spake as a child understood when I became a man I put away each other things but then face to face now I know in Parts foreign and where we are going back to foreign they said we ever investigations her pastor told her don't worry you're a church member you're fine don't don't worry about it but when death came uh she began to tell the shout you did not tell me the truth you deceive me and now I am going to hell because you did not conduct to the correct way but we think universe that the bride has a pastor she has a prophet she has Jesus Christ she has eternal life she has all of the word amen amen as your father who is in heaven is perfect how could you at one time be perfect before the eyes of Christ in this moment as perfect as Christ is God only sees Christ he says the firstborn is Perfecto he is perfect his brothers are perfect they receive the same blood as my son and that's what has the devil's surprise because when when Jesus came Jesus Jesus he rebuked Satan but William Branham he curse Satan in turn says someone that is as much authority of God and you and all believers you have the same Authority as Jesus Christ I am in him I am perfect before the eyes of God I don't want any more complaints I don't have any money I'm not from here from there I'm not that much but now that you're a man recognize your position my brother and my friend Ultimo hey we'll read uh one more extract yes and we'll be closing by the grace of the Lord be reading Revelation chapter 10. verse 10 and 11. um flew by we had to let go of some scriptures de lang and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand eat it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter when you get the little book from the age of Tomah and you eat it and you begin to obey it it is sweet to hear it oh how good but on Monday try to live it see if you can bitter again to the belly he said unto me thou must prophecy again before many peoples repeating and hearing constantly the word of the prophets it is the only way that you can digest well you have not been able to live how can you digest something you haven't eaten you see on the table it has no effect on you [Music] and those were that's where birth pains begin to happen now we are the children of God when are we the children of God now means present time now we are seated in Heavenly places I believe it is and the service is not to hear things of the world but it's it's to hear these things now the holy spirit is here I don't see him oh I see him and now he used me today to be able to speak to you now we are the children now we are seated now the holy spirit is here but he uses your mouth foreign to all of his word thus saith the Lord is that Psalms 1 6. for the Lord knows the way of the righteousness but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish he knows who we are and those that are wrong [Music] and we'll prepare to close Romans chapter 8. [Music] all of the word now emotions you hear things and you have to shout and there's times they send you to the altareness and there's times it makes you think that is the diet that the Lord gives us daily whose shall separate us from the love of Christ and the Lord gives us options shall tribulation or distress or persecution nakedness what will separate when this comes what can separate you from the Lord if by God I have it all possible his faith oh you're doing it right and as as the toad you you get inflated but it's better for them to tell you something that will make yourself and remind you who you are and what you represent ative verse 37. now in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us it's not you who overcomes he is the overcomer or any other creature griada nor any other creatures from the love of God and your voice which is in Christ Jesus our lord and if we may stand we thank the Lord to be able to remember these things and we've heard them and although Peter said although we know it doesn't hurt us to cure them again what it makes our spiritual life grow [Music] and once again if you have a petition something that you need help from the Lord simply follow the prayers and God will give us that right loving Heavenly Father or your blessed word that we have spoken today for your sons and daughters gathered in the sanctuary Lord I have lifted up your precious name or the men women children we have been uh benefited of this privilege from us here once again your Eternal Word or nothing can harm us and the Apostle Paul said that our present things that are to come sickness nothing can separate all the youth is increased from the love of God which is nothing hinders there's not enough there's not enough Devils that can hinder the resurrection there's not enough of anything in any place that can hinder us from Resurrection we have the promises we have the Holy Ghost the eternal life of God that is reaching down to our hearts to our soul all that the father has given me comes to me come to me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you [Applause] would you raise your hands to him and say Lord my heart is open and won't you come inside [Music] I've opened all the window I've grown [Music] inside dear Lord I Need you need him this morning with all of our hearts and our hands raised to him oh Lord my heart is open [Music] come inside [Music] about oh I've opened all the windows I've grown wide [Music] and come inside your lord I need more [Music] don't you love him this morning how many love the Lord Jesus why don't you turn and just greet your brother tell them that you love him amen [Music] think of the goodness of Jesus amen how many enjoyed that word this morning amen [Music] ities then my hallelujah praise God for saving me once again go the Jesus and all this praise God for saving me oh thank you thank you Lord for saving me now wonderful Jesus is to me and to learn Prince of Peace Mighty God it feels saving me fit me bro I'm all finished I'm in your praise His name is keeping me from our ministry give me amen don't you love to praise His name this morning amen I'm gonna ask if an interpreter will coming hey man we're gonna we're gonna be going home here in a minute how many are happy this morning hey man how many can give another one to God's word amen God
