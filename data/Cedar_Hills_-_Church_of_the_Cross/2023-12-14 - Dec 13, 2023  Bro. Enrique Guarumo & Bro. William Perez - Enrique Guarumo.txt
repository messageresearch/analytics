you it's a pleasure to be to see you one more time let us open up our scriptures let us go to the Book of Matthew we're going to be reading chapter four of St Matthew when you have it you can say Amen blessed be the name of the Lord let us pray before reading it Heavenly Father we thank you tonight for giving us the opportunity to be here still with life with with the desire to serve you to continue our journey Lord at this time we have opened your word we ask you that by reading that you help us to understand the reading of it we ask this in your name in the name of the Lord Jes Jesus Christ 4 verse 12 of Matthew through verse 16 the scripture read reads like this now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison he departed into Galilee and leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt in capernum which is upon the Sea Coast and the borders of zabulon and nephin that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying the land of zabulon the land of by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region of the and shadow of death light is sprung up you may be seated G to take some quotes from The Prophet the message there is a man that can turn on the light we ask God to understand what we can according to his word the prophet tells us in this message that religions or the past ages they could not Advance because they did not continue with the light that was after them and that's the reason why they couldn't continue and us as people of God I believe we have been instructed by the word and the message to understand that the word word of God is always present and is always Progressive it is not just a one place or one form the word of God is always be transforming itself through time and the prophet of God tells us that when God said let there be light then he said that the first atom started spinning and he said and until today it is still spinning the same way so the word of God never ends because it is eternal when we come to this topic uh just as the prophet left it because I don't have a higher authority to give my own topic but I will leave it as such just so I can give it in this way for us to obtain light the prophet of God says that electricity has always been upon the earth and the prophet says if you were in a dark room you would not be able to say you would probably say electricity light up but he said that's not going to happen even though electricity is there but even if you scream and shout you will not be able to get electricity unless you go to the law of electricity and that that's the way God is he say you can be crying out to God but you have to act upon the law of God because God is a god of laws so you cannot come to God but through his word which is the law and I read something that the prophet says in the message I hope you be you be patient with me with reads like this that's just like the light it isn't the lamp that makes the light it's the electricity that's in the wire that makes the light it Heats The Wire and the wire gets hot and makes the light now if you remember the scripture in John chapter 8 Jesus says I am the light but when you go to the Book of Matthew Chapter 5 you notice that Jesus says ye are the light of the world now for what I know I understand that there is lamps or bulbs of a of a certain capacity but Jesus says so should your light shine so it depends on the light that you have that's how you should light up if you only have five amps don't try to have 60 amps I hope I can make this is very common in the house so there can be electricity at home somewhere there has to be a source of power now to transmit that power it takes some resources and when you go through the road you're going to see some power lines have you seen it there is power in those lines amen you can't see it but there's power that if you touch it I'm G to read what the prophet the prophet he worked at electricity I'm I'm gonna say it he says that he was so distressed and he saw he saw those power lines he said that there was 2300 volts and he wanted to grab those 2300 Vol to go so so he could go home see his his daughter and some some Supernatural way he ended up on the floor so if there was 2,300 volts the prophet said says by only that would tear your whole body apart now when Paul meets this light what this light does is that it he it blinded him that's what it depends on what kind of buob You Are and here we come into what our position in Christ is so the prophet was in in the in the power post post and when he saw the shadow on the on the on the ground he said that it was like a cross so to be able to transmit this light you need Calvary the cross and if you go through the road those who who are so you're goingon to see that you're you're going to see a cross you're going to see a post on in the form of a cross and there's three lines in there now this electricity that gets to your home it's a voltage of 110 vaults that come to your house but through there there is electricity that is 240 We're not gonna talk about that we're only going to talk about 110 you know devices like these they only work with 12 volts and when the gospel started started with 12 Apostles but after that the Lord said let's let's get up the voltage a little bit and he said let's get 120 I hope you can understand me and when he put 120 so the power was more now to be able to transmit that power we're gonna find what that we have the post that's why Paul said to establish men that are helpful that are willing to teach and you know the requirements because this power if you connect it to the wrong lamp you know what's going to happen it's going to explode it's not gonna these lamps they have some resistances and that's why Paul comes and teaches us and he tells us that the men that are going to serve they must be tested first there there's people I'm not going to say who because I don't know them you know they put a man to do a certain job and with the first complaint they receive they cannot resist it they cannot bear up with it that's why Jesus says so sure should your light shine as a brother said even if I was the rug of the church and they put that brother to sweep and he he he didn't want to do it he said I don't like that that's why you should prove your resistance so let's establish the the first post you know the Wood and Wire post right maybe there by by your house there there's one of them have you wondered why those post they they have been there for so long you see that years go by and the owner of the house and a new one comes and the wooden post is still there for that post to to last or resist the time that he that he needs they put oil on it and you know what oil means in the Bible when you're under the right anointing in the right place there's going to there's going to be many things that are are going to happen but that's not going to hurt you because that post they do not only cover it with oil but the deepness that is going up is the same deepness that is going down so these are some but take it to the spiritual so you can see how is my post anchored remember I'm just giving you the facts so you can know if you are light why am not am I not producing even if it's five watts of light you know why the Propet because there is a wire that is wrongly placed why do I not get the prophet says it's probably because there's a wire there that is losen because the power is there you probably feel disappointed or or discouraged but you have to find that little wire why are things not working in my home you need to have you need to find that little wire we are receiving very tremendous messages how many are Gods I remember brother Bernie he was speaking about very he say sometimes we want to have so much power to speak to the lion to control the animals but what about your home I remember the first God is Man then not even the dog can can be subjected to us so we have to look for that wire why we are not lighting up I'm not gonna get in because we have to live it first so we can preach it the prophet says keep reading then you know I work in it for years but there's no one in the world that knows what electricity is can explain the power of God the prophet of God says no one can explain it for that's why a man that was trying to explain it I think he died frustrated for that because he couldn't explain it says isn't it strange no one knows what it is they can hardness it they can make it light they can cook with it they can heat with it they can light with it but no one knows what it is it's two pieces of material rolling together which makes the continuity so it's two pieces together that's why the scripture says two are under agreement ask whatever you want but it takes for them to be in mutual agreement so they can have continuity blessed be the name of the Lord and sends out GE electricity that's the way it is when those two pieces get rolling together that's what brings it off in the generator that's the way it is when a Christian gets to working with God rolling together that brings an unseen force that does Mysteries that none of us know anything we only know that it's God isn't that right see yes blessed be the name of the Lord so the first thing we find is that we need two people together we have a line of 110 but on the other side we're going to need another part of electricity which is negative you touch it and you don't feel anything but if you touch the one that is 110 you would probably not feel anything but you need to take to touch both 120 volts and that will shake you off but when we go over the 240 we need two 120 you don't need the negative anymore that's why you need to leave every negativity be able to form a 240 we're going to be in 2024 now so we're not going to be in 120 now I keep reading the prophet says this what was it was God going to light the world with his own electricity he had been here all the time it was here all the time but they just didn't know how to and make it work for you well now the same holy spirit that fell on the day of Pentecost that healed the sick back there it's been here in the church all the time but the thing of it is you don't know how to make it work for you now there's a thing that makes it work is Faith to believe to believe when you believe and take him out his word that's the lifeline and it cannot fail now if you go in the morning and turn on the electric iron some of you women to start the iron and the first thing you know that it doesn't work has it happened to you that's what the holy spirit is saying you're GNA iron and there's no electricity you will not go around and say there is not such a thing as electricity he said uh-uh no no no said uh-uh you wouldn't do that there's just something wrong there's just something wrong you got your wires crossed up that's what's the matter with many people that say well I got prayed for I didn't get healed there's no such a thing as Divine Healing you just got your wires crossed up the prophet says look look at the others that are being healed see there's something wrong with you not with God so if you haven't been heal do not blame God do not blame anyone just go home say Lord why do I not get healed what am I doing wrong so I'm not the way that I'm not healed because the power is there keep reading now it says now the room is full of electricity but only that bulb is made to burn now as God has certain instruments that he works through the prophet is saying that God has electricity but he has instruments that he can work through says through preaching through prophecy through prophetic utterance through Gifts of and so forth mine is a prophetic utterance that's the way I work for our Lord many of you here's a young man some strer cases a little Waterhead baby heart trouble and everything else around here seting you're right in the dark spot aren't you now all the screaming you do to God that is an it electricity will light up if you work according to law of electricity this is the last one now there was a man that God was fixing to give electricity to the world I believe when God's program is ready everything will work right to its place don't you it has for ordained to do so so Benjamin Franklin went fishing with a kite well Lightning Run and he caught it and he began to run and holler I got it I got it got it I got it he had it but he didn't know what he had Prophet says well that's what's the matter with our Pentecostal church with our Pentecostal church you've got it but you don't know what you got that's it that's right you've got power enough to Open the Eyes of the blind and stop the ears of the de to do all things but you come in with a twisted atmosphere let's get it in one Accord so the Holy Spirit can pour out the go shirt down upon the people one place play in one Accord so the holy spirit is telling us to be in one Accord at the point that God can pour out those gushers of Miracles and Things Can Happen bless be the name of the Lord you may if you stand on your feet we're going to leave the other things for later when a person is caught by electricity that electricity attracts that person now you can't let go of that this the same thing that happens to the Christian when you're attracted by that power of God and you can say no longer do I live but Christ live within me you can get a hold of that power then to wait for the Rapture God bless [Applause] you amen and God bless you this evening brother Enrique for that wonderful message amen tell you anytime anybody talks about electricity I get a little little afraid even uh even um replacing light bulb man it's little scary for me so those that work around electricity have a lot of respect for you I replace a fan the entire house gets shut off so amen but thank God there's a man in here that can turn on the lights amen amen God bless you all this morning or this this evening it's wonderful to be in the house of the Lord see all your smiling beautiful faces start my timer here real quick and um let us let us turn into uh into the scriptures thank you uh Pastor for this for this time you know it's uh I I uh was having um I wouldn't say difficulties uh getting a thought but it was it was it was coming to me a little a little slow and I was just praying and trying to put things together and I pray this this this evening that uh that one person in uh in here gets gets a gets a little portion amen amen let's turn to the Book of Jeremiah 29th chapter and the 11th verse a very very well-known scripture when you have it say amen and it's simp simply says for I know the thoughts that I think toward you sayith the Lord thoughts of Peace not of evil give you an expected end then shall you call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart amen Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word and you may be seated you I'll put up that uh that picture so this is uh if you don't know what this is this is a flea now those that have animals and have pets they have you have dealt with with at one time or another you have dealt with fleas cor well we're going to get into that in little in a little bit but I have a question for you this evening is is prayer is it your steering wheel will or is it your spare tire I want you to think about this for the next 20 or so minutes is it what guides you or is it something that it's in it's in the trunk of your car is it something that you when you get into a little bit of trouble you you you realize that there's prayer I have found myself especially this year really evaluating my prayer life you know many times times we we we pray we pray for our food we pray for uh when we go to bed we pray when we get up maybe uh there's a petition that comes in and we see it on our church app and many will put in we are praying and those things are great but when we when we talk about prayer when we have when we have read this scripture of when we would seek him when we will search for him it doesn't say that we'll find find him when we search for him but we will find him when we search for him with all of our heart the question I have asked myself over and over what have I done and have I given the Lord Jesus Christ all my heart even as someone that has that has that has been in church for 42 years I still have to find myself I still have to ask myself where am I where am I going what am I doing is is is is everything that I'm doing is it is am I doing it correctly and even as a minister I find out and I ask myself these questions am I really searching for God with all my heart am I really using prayer as my steering wheel am I really putting everything in my life every decision that I make whatever I do am I really am I really putting it towards God and really asking him is this the right thing to do am I really going down the right path am I doing what's right for my wife am I doing what's right for my children I ask myself and it bothers me so many times because I can say yes I am there's very few people that go to church more than I do I can truly say that there there is very few people that go to church more than I do but what does that mean what has Church come what has Church become to me just a place to go to on a on a on a Wednesday night on a Sunday morning Sunday afternoon throughout throughout the year uh doing uh uh conventions is it is it just become something that I'm supposed to do because of who I am and I have to be honest with myself I could say yes you're doing the right thing yes you're you're you're going down the right path and even everything that we've learned over the over the years everything that has been taught to us from our Prophet from our apostle from our pastor everything that we have learned so many times I feel like I have a better way to do it no I'm going to do it my way because number one it's easier it's more it's it's more comfortable for me it's it's a better way and so many times we're we're so so afraid we're so afraid of of what the future is holding there's there's a quote that says never be afraid to trust a known to trust an unknown future to a known God we don't know what the future is but in our life in our experience we know what God has done amen amen we know what God has brought us through but when we come to a point in our lives so many times we have forgotten what God has brought us from and we say okay well I'm in a higher position now I feel like I'm like I'm a bit more mature I've read all the books I've read the Bible I've read the message so now I know exactly what to do but there's so many times in those situations when it's not when when we go through that we use our own mentality we become so we become so limited we're limited by ourselves brother Enrique was was was talking about excuses and it's everybody's fault because of what I of of where I am it's everybody else's fault well it's the pastor's fault well it's it's the youth leaders fault well it's my wife's fault no no so many times we've got to look in the mirror and say hey it's my fault just when you think where you have reached a limit God wants you to go a little bit higher but this is this is where the flea comes in you know a flea is an amazing creature and if you don't know well a flea it's one of God's creatures whether you think it's nasty it doesn't matter it's one of God's creatures all right so get that out of your mind it's one of God's creatures while a flea can jump up to 36 in doesn't have wings that's how that's how high it can jump the flea when it wants to jump horizontally it can jump up to six feet now that would be the equivalent of brother Elijah Elijah jumping 3 50 ft imagine that a creature so insignificant that even when King Saul was was chasing David David referred to himself and said why is the king chasing a flee like me chasing something something that's so insignificant but when we go back into our lives what the devil wants to do he wants to limit you where you're at he says you can jump you can jump like the flea I have no problem with that but this is the way that people can limit a flea they would put a flea in a jar well and then they would put a lid on it well because the flea jumps and it's in his nature he starts to jump and immediately he hits the cap or the lid of the jar over and over the flea keeps on hitting his head on the lid of the jar and for three days the flea will do this because it's in his nature after the three days the flea is well his head's a little sore he starts to think well I'm going to jump but I'm not going to jump as high as as I used to because now he's Limited in this jar of How High he can jump so he starts to jump and he says okay I'm jumping but now I'm not hitting myself now I still do everything that I used to do and I can jump and he jumps and doesn't hit his head anym and he feels everything is good now what's amazing about it is that once the flea has Offspring The Offspring they have the same mentality as their parents so what happens the lid is removed the flea jumps but he can't escape the jar he has been programmed all of this time to know that if he jumps higher than where he's at he is going to hit his head so not only is he jumping a certain a certain height but now he's telling his children his offspring you know we used to be able we used to be able to jump as high as we wanted to oh but we're limited now because if you if you try if you try and jump with everything that you have you're GNA fail you're going to hit your head you're only going to reach a certain height even when the lid is removed the mentality so the parents are limited and they take that limitation and they take that and they place it on their children and they say you're limited you can only do so much and over and over Offspring after Offspring have the same mentality why we see other people at at another level and we wonder why why can I why can't I get out of this situation why am I still stuck just thinking church is good enough why am I stuck thinking that oh that this that this prayer that I'm praying is good enough church we get stuck we're limited the doctor tells us something and we're limited to what his diagnosis is say you're sick he say yes I am you say you're not going to get any better that's right doctor I'm not going to get any better and it keeps on going year after year and we look at ourselves and I see myself from when I from when I was 20 years ago I look at myself and says who who is this guy who is this guy that that that would preach on how how beautiful faith is how how we've got the power to of for any situation and who is this guy that's so scared who's this guy that's afraid because what what he what the devil is telling him he's saying yeah that's the truth Satan I can't be better than what I am today I can't do it I'm not worthy to do it and year after year we think that with ourselves to ourselves and we start believing it sooner or later we start transferring that to our wives to our children and we say because I am this way you have to be that way because I'm in this this condition you have to be in this and we limit ourselves and we limit the gifts God gives to us we limit our children we limit them to saying we limit them and we tell them this is as good as it's going to get you're fine good good don't try and strive for anything else Beyond this because this is the best and we go and we go through life jumping and shouting and this yes this is it yet we see ourselves in the mirror years later blaming everybody else around us for us not being able to succeed in life brother and sister I'm not telling I'm not I'm not I'm not saying about financially or economically no no but when we succeed in life what what do I mean by that when we can truly with all of our heart help somebody in need without even caring about getting something in return it seems like we're always wanting hey if I do this for you while you know you owe me one later in life you owe me but really have we limited ourselves to that have we limited ourselves to to not caring about those that are around us but I want to tell you there's some good news how many like good news there is a certain lady that that wound up thanking God pretty is pretty crazy huh yes uh she ended up thanking God for an INF infestation of fleas this lady was in in the time of of the second world war she wasn't a Jew but her family would help would help Jews she would help them hide he would feed him he was in the little town of Harlem out right outside of Amsterdam Amsterdam in the Netherlands uh one day one day the Germans came in and they took her entire family away eventually her father her mother and her siblings passed away in the camps it was only her and her sister left they had uh they had been taken to this camp and they were were able to smuggle in a Bible for for many days they would read the Bible in secret and finally after about after about a month or so they started having a little bible study there and they wondered why why they were able so freely to talk about the love of God why they were able so freely to to be able to sing hyns one day as they were as they were sewing uh socks for the for the soldiers this lady named Cory tenom she asked her supervisor is this the right size that I that I that I uh that I need to make the socks is this the right material and she says can you come and tell us can you come into our room and tell us if we're doing it right the supervisor saids I ain't going in there she says why won't you come into our room we ain't going in there many more months passed by they would hear the cries of other women in in different buildings they were getting abused and they wondered why in their building no one was getting abused they wondered why no Soldier would enter in into their building until one day they started reading a scripture and it starts with first Thessalonians 15 and as they read this in their little bible study it says that see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men and even in their situation they read Rejoice ever more pray without seizing 18 in everything give thanks in everything give thanks you know what they give what they gave thanks for because when they first entered into that building Corey got down on her knees along with her s along with her sister and they asked God show us show us how show us how to live in a building infested with fleas after many months they said God thank you for the fleas because it was the fleas that protected them from all these men trying to go in you see it was so bad that these men didn't want anything to do with so in your life we may limit God sometimes but brother and sister if we can
