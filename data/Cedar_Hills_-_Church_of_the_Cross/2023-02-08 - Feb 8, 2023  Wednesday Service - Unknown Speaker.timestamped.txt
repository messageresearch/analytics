[34:31] we're going to be speaking about
[34:33] something that happens is
[34:56] be comfortable however you would like to
[34:59] be
[35:04] Acts chapter 16 starting with verse 22.
[35:07] this is
[35:10] I'm going to give you a little bit of
[35:12] time there
[35:14] it is
[35:17] acts 16 Verse 22 starting this is
[35:28] the magistrates rent up their clothes
[35:35] and commanded to beat them
[35:40] and when they had laid many stripes upon
[35:43] them
[35:44] they cast them into
[35:47] prisoners
[35:50] to keep them safely
[35:54] and he received such a church
[35:59] them into the inner prison
[36:03] and made their feet fast in the stocks
[36:09] and at midnight Paul and Silas prayed
[36:16] and they I'm saying Praises unto God and
[36:19] the prisoners heard them and
[36:23] suddenly there was a great earthquake
[36:29] so that the foundations of the prison
[36:31] were shaken
[36:34] and immediately all the doors were open
[36:52] that came through the Apostle Paul to
[36:55] write these words
[37:01] to open these words to us
[37:04] that we might see Lord
[37:08] that you are the same yesterday today
[37:11] and forever
[37:14] we confine your word in the name of the
[37:17] Lord Jesus
[37:18] God bless you you may be seated
[37:26] his family wherever they might find
[37:28] themselves
[37:32] just about five or ten minutes you will
[37:35] give me your full attention
[37:38] I want to bring you to this scene
[37:40] tonight
[37:48] and then we begin to read a new momentum
[37:52] in a moment when Paul said this is
[38:03] the scripture says that they they were
[38:06] equipped with many times
[38:09] it doesn't say that they were hurt
[38:16] one time but many many times
[38:23] you see that they were wounded
[38:27] they were bleeding that they had been
[38:29] hurt
[38:32] they will put there in the most inner
[38:35] part of the prison
[38:36] not in just any place
[38:44] to put him in the very most General
[38:47] worst part of the jail
[38:49] in a place where there was no light
[38:53] it was so humid in that place
[38:57] where the wind would come in was much
[39:00] strength
[39:03] it was dripping water there where they
[39:06] were at
[39:09] the humidity that was in that place made
[39:11] it such a terrible place
[39:16] and they put stocks on their hands and
[39:18] on their feet
[39:21] that's where they found themselves
[39:25] but the Bible says but
[40:18] because they were suffering
[40:22] for the cause of the Gospel
[40:26] they were praising God
[40:44] but here is the key is
[40:55] many people praise God
[40:58] but they don't receive anything
[41:04] they teach us the correctness
[41:12] and receive the answer of God yes
[41:17] and that was to have the correct
[41:19] attitude
[41:25] does not look at the circumstances
[41:28] Cyrus
[42:52] you'll come to the service your prayer
[42:55] service
[42:57] but
[43:15] it was a 15.5 earthquake on the record
[43:21] the scripture says it shook the
[43:24] foundations
[43:30] the more Supernatural
[43:34] is
[43:36] not even one a little sand piece of sand
[43:40] fell off of the walls grain of sanding

[43:47] magnify his glory momentum
