happy glad it free it free I'll singing and shout it for he's everything to me amen is he everything to you this evening yes he sure is am amen glory what a what a privilege it is to be in the house of the Lord welcome you all God bless you I never shall forget the day I think it was uh uh last week when we heard I think it was brother Tommy junr who said he had preached to one person right but I'll never forget the the day that one day I was down my my my dad had just passed away and and our pastor had just gotten sick and I was down and out I was at the lowest point in my life and that's when Satan came to me and he said I'm going to kill you but I'll never forget that day there something inside of me something started to move and all of a sudden I began to preach and I preached for 30 minutes to myself and it was a jubilee and I'll never forget that day and I'm sure that if you're going through anything tonight I know that there there's something that you can anchor on to and that's the day that he came and he showed up what an awesome God we serve amen amen if we can get right to our scripture this I I want to give you we've heard we heard tremendous message this morning and the tremendous sermons that we have heard uh the series of our pastor the parallel and every week you just think it just can't get any better than that and then it does wow so I'm GNA make a statement right now but you're not going to understand understand it until the end of the service or the message yes what a terrible God we serve right so you of you that don't know Spanish you're going to have to wait for the interpretation but we're going through things in life that I hear every day if God is so good why do these things happen and he sends his word what a terrible God Amen all right so you can take your seats I'm gonna before we take our seats I'm going to read a scripture for and it's simply Ephesians 4:30 and it says says and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed into the day of redemption amen you may be seated amen grieve not the Holy Spirit we really like the scriptures when it says look up your Redemption draw nigh right and we're real happy with that because of our Redemption dry nigh but the holy spirit says today grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption amen amen so we find ourselves in a test so my title tonight is don't fail don't fail the test with a subtitle remember right I never shall forget the day but the prophet of God says in possessing the gates of the enemy paragraph nine he says God had been testing the patriarch because he had given him a promise and when God makes a promise he wants to be sure that this person is worthy of the promise so God has many promises for you and we can hold on to those promises because they're true but there's something that we have to do on our part and he says before he fulfills what he says or what he promises so Abraham had been promised that through his seed the whole world would be blessed and he would have a son and this son out of whom should come forth a seed that would bless the whole earth and Abraham when he was Pro when the promise was given to him was 75 years old and Sarah his wife was 65 years old but the Bible tells us that Abraham stag Ed not at the promise of God and God Time After Time Ted him amen but he had come to that final test before the blessing was going to happen and that's the way it is with all the Seed of Abraham God gives us a final test just before he gives the promise and if it was possible I'd like to say something here personally but I will withhold it that final test to see how you'll react upon it and when he had gave Abraham this test he found Abraham just as true as he was when he started now what a blessing it would be this morning if we who take his promise of healing would stand just as true as we did when we stood here and accepted it now there's a test will you pass or will you fail right now we find ourselves in circumstances today but I want to tell you as you hear on the radio this is only a test of the broadcast right this is only a test so I want you to know but that what we're going through right now that you can be sure of one thing that God is merciful and he's graceful that he would give you a test what Mercy that God had on us that he would give us a test because without a test there is no promise you can read the Bible but the promises are not for you if there is no test now we are in a test now up until the test everything that you say or every thought that you have does not mean absolutely nothing you can say I'm a Christian you can say I go to church you can say I'm anchored you can say I can stand but until the test everything you say means absolutely nothing as we heard this morning Elohim El he was there by himself existing all alone but inside of him there was attributes he knew that he was a God he knew that he was a father he knew that he was a savior he knew that he was a redeemer but what happened is that he had to believe his own word that's why without faith it is impossible to please God because in the beginning God himself he had to have faith in his own word and that is the standard by which he gives us is his word now we're going to go to the Natural okay okay now today we should be in is a time that we should be in our tiptop not physical right but we should be in good physical condition but we should be in tiptop spiritual condition right we should be okay so we call ourselves Christians right okay so we should be tiptop in condition Christians right amen so if it's in the natural so you take an athlete for instance now uh a football player or a track star right he's got to be in tiptop physical condition that's his craft right so do we take a fighter for example right so everybody is born a fighter right you fight to that's that's seed fights to get to the womb it's a fight to get out of there it's a fight just to take your breath everybody's born a fighter now you take a a fighter for example now he believes that he can fight with the best of them right amen amen inside of him is a belief that he can match up with the world's best right so he trains he gets into the gym now it's first a thought right so many of us a lot of times we think oh I can hit the I can hit the gym right and I can I'm gonna I'm gonna do a mile today right and we start off I'll never forget when we were kids they had a marathon in in Silver City Silver City and I remember our pastor ran in it and my sister Janette and my cousins I used to think man my cousins are tough man I bet you those guys those guys could go I was just a little guy and there the race started and and I saw Janette take off I was like man oh my God my cousin was right behind her and they were G man they're bad right oh see and so then when you get to the Finish Line I saw another guy and our pastor right I think you either took first or second right right right and I thought man and and our pastor he was small thing he was a little scrawny and here he comes running at the end of the race [Applause] right and that's how we do many times we take off real fast now we're talking spiritually we go into hiding right we begin to do what's told of us and we begin to run real fast but then all of a sudden we're not in spiritual condition and all of a sudden we begin to fade back We Begin to Fall Down We Begin not to read our BBL we revert back social media to the things of the world and the promise begins to go far how come because we haven't been able to pass the test now a fighter in his mind he can do it every fighter you hear them all the time in the natural oh I can easily I am easily can beat Floyd Mayweather Mayweather I'm bigger than he is I'm faster than he is I'm this and I'm that and he believes it right he's got to believe it but up until the test he's just all talk right amen they say I hit harder than he does right so he begins to train and he begins to train his body and he trains and he trains and then all of a sudden he's got to reach that final test and the day comes that it's time to get into the ring and then all of a sudden he trained his physical body but then all of a sudden he realizes you can't train heart you can't train spirit and you can't train your soul right amen those are Promises of God but all of a sudden he gets in the ring and physically he can hold up for a little bit but then all of a sudden he hits him and nothing happens everything that he was built himself on was that I'm more powerful and he throws his punch and he walks right through it all of a sudden because he didn't train his mind because the Bible says trust in the Lord thy God with all of th heart with all of th mind with all your spirit and all of your soul all of a sudden he finds out that he doesn't have the mental capacity his mind isn't strong enough and all of a sudden unbelief sets in oh he was walking real high but then all of a sudden unbelief sets in and the minute unbelief sets in fear takes over and that's what's happened and that's what happens today because we're not in spiritual condition We Begin to Fall Down we begin to fail the test so no matter your potential if there isn't a test it's all talk so and then you talk to the trainer what happened to your fighter oh man he's fast in the gym I mean he's he's he can go he's powerful right but he's not at an elite he's not at the elite class yet well what happened what do you think it wasn't happening he just didn't train his mind right amen well what what happened I don't know what do you think trainer what what what what can you tell him he needs to learn to let his hands go cuz fear sets in right amen Jeremiah the word says before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee right amen how much more confidence could you have than that that when God himself says before I knew before I formed you I knew you and I chose you and I ordained you but let me tell you one thing he says fear not in verse eight it says Be not Afraid be not afraid of their faces no matter what they tell you it doesn't matter if they're laughing at you he's saying don't be afraid of their smiles be not afraid of their faces for I am with thee to deliver Thee sayi the Lord says fear not so but that word there fear does not mean afraid says fear not that's why the Bible says fear not don't be afraid of him that can destroy the body but fear that's a different fear it's not be afraid [Music] it's a reverence but fear Him in other words he's saying don't be afraid of him but trust him trust him believe in him don't be afraid of him but trust him believe him that can destroy the body and the soul but he says here in verse uh let me get my glasses here all right let's see and he says over here in verse 17 he says Thou therefore g g up thy loin and that's what I'm telling you today a word of encouragement therefore G up thy loins and arise get up arise from your Slumber arise from your Slumber wake up fear not believe me trust me G up th loin and arise and speak unto them all that I command thee be not dismayed don't be afraid be not dism or and we and we jump and Shout with that right oh we don't have to be afraid no we don't have to be afraid no he's saying not to be afraid he's saying be not dism trust me fear me h fear me trust me believe me be not dismayed be not confounded don't be confounded right am but what he's telling you if you don't believe me or you don't trust me L I'll confound them I'll confound you right amen saying Be not Afraid be not dismayed be not confounded but if you don't believe what I'm telling you if you can't believe the voice of the sign that I have placed I'm going to confound you you're going to be confounded you're not going to know what's up and what's down because you don't believe but you have become afraid now that's words of encouragement for you now as we heard this morning we heard from our prophet he says now it started in the beginning what started in the beginning just believed one word right we heard that this morning just believed one word broke one word it's got to be word by word you have to believe the word by word he said now that word is Christ right that one word was Christ and we found out that Eve she took that one word she took that one word Lord which was Christ which was ownership now you can say I believe in God and you can say that you believe but brother Brown said this morning if you don't live it you don't believe it right so how do I believe as we heard from our brother Abraham how do I believe separate yourself right God wants a separator you got to separate yourself can you give me Exodus 9:119 and this was uh Moses and and he had gone to pharaoh and the word of the Lord had come to Moses and it said send therefore now and gather thy cattle and all that thou Hast in the field for upon every man and every Beast which shall be found in the field and shall not be brought in or brought home the hail shall come down upon them and they shall die and they shall die so look at the mercy of God God didn't have to warn him God didn't have to send them a warning but you know God doesn't find pleasure in judgments the Bible says he doesn't find pleasure in pestilence give me the verse again he doesn't find pleasure in those things but what's his purpose is so that you can repent and draw an eye unto him that you can go into your secret chamber the secret chamber as we heard is not the Internet it's not folies different things he says I've giving you an opportunity to seek my face and there's only one secret chamber and that's the secret closet of prayer he's giving you the opportunity to get calluses on your knees he wants you to draw n unto him and all they had to do believe Moses he said I'm going to send a hail stor get all of your stuff get all of your gains everything that you got get your children get your family get your cattle get everything get inside the house and stay in there and all they had to do was believe Moses but we find out in Isaiah in that they said we don't we we have other things that we have built up we can escape The [Applause] Hil we can escape the pestilence and it says how are we going to do it they said we're going to take all of our money we're going to write this out we're going to write it out let me tell you the Bible says that if you didn't believe Moses that the hell would fall and it would run into your house and wipe out all your gain why because they didn't believe Moses and that's all we have to do today God has given us God has been merciful to give us a test and to give us a man of Holy Ghost filled man that can stand here and tell you my children get into your houses stay there for a while get into communion with God and sometimes and most of the time we find ourselves failing the test God told Moses he said come up to the mountain God gave him two calls right he said Moses come up to the the mountain right Aaron and the priest there was only one man was called to the top of the mountain halfway up the mountain if you read it I don't have time to read it right now but a halfway up the mountain he told the others you stay down right amen that's right he called him he said Moses come up and that's what he's done to us this that's what he's done with these messages of the parallel in these series that we've been hearing come up to where I am and if you read the scripture he said he said Moses come up to the top of the mountain and be there like Moses come on to the top of the mountain do this do that do that he said come up to the mountain be there that's it just be there and guess what six days mes just stay there quietly the Bible says we can't even sit for two minutes that's right we can't even sit for two minutes before before people start getting itchy they start getting nervous neotic I'm gonna check I'm gonna check the news or you know you're another page wow look at that wow right Moses Stood Still just be there silent trust in me trust in the Lord your God Moses was there all of a sudden the Lord came the God himself came down he told Moses stand on that rock stand over there oh brothers and sisters tonight we have that same Rock we have that same hiding place he's given us his word and that word is Christ and we're anchored in the Rock of Ages so if I can encourage you tonight fear not be not afraid if you can give me Nehemiah 414 and I looked and I this was Nehemiah he was building the wall of jerus he he was rebuilding it and he was standing on top of the wall with the other Watchmen and the Bible says that he had a tool in one hand and he had a sword in the other hand and he was looking around and there were still holes in the in the Gat but the Bible says he says and I looked and I rose up and I said to the Nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people be not afraid of them remember remember the Lord which is great and terrible he's great and he's terrible and fight for your brethren keep working keep working keep the tools in one hand and the sword in the other it doesn't matter what comes against you be not afraid be not dismayed be not confounded for our God he's great and he's terrible what a terrible God that we serve my if I can read you and and Deuteronomy 7:17 oh if Thou shalt say in thine heart these nations are more than us that sounds a lot like Jeremiah he says for I'm just a child no no no before you were even formed I knew you but if you say in th heart these nations are more than I how can I dispose of them the next verse and thou shalt not be afraid of them but shall well remember what the Lord thy God did unto pharaoh and unto all of Egypt next verse the great Temptations with which Thine Eyes saw and the signs and the Wonders and the mighty hand and the stretched out arm whereby the Lord thy God brought thee out so shall the Lord thy God do unto all the [Music] people of whom thou are afraid verse 21 Thou shalt not be AF frightened of them for the Lord thy God is among you a mighty God and terrible but what happens you don't remember we don't remember and another scripture in Deuteronomy me see if I can find it real fast and I'm Gonna Leave You with this oh Excuse excuse me it's going to be in Psalms 106 I'll leave you with this here verse n he rebuked the Red Sea also and it was dried up so he led them through the deps as through the Wilderness and he saved them from the hand of him that hated them and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy and the waters covered their enemies there was not one of them left then believed they they saw him at the Red Sea with the Red Sea before them and the enemy coming behind them and all of a sudden he opened up the sea and they walked upon dry land then belied they his Works they sang his praise it's easy with no test it's easy you can talk everything that you want to but when they were at the Red Sea and the enemy behind them they said what did you do did you bring us here to die and all of a sudden he said trust me believe me trust me why cry and he opened up the sea and then they believed him it's easy to sing songs when the seed's already been open but what about when he needs you to trust him to trust him and after all that he did for them and after all that he does for us verse 13 they soon forget his works and they waited not for his counsel we are not orphans he has not left us he has given us Christ the spirit of truth yes sir we are not alone but let me tell you until the test until you've been tested and you've been tried there is no promise in here for you or for me and you know the only way that I know that there's promises for me is that if I open this book up and I read it and you know how I know that of his love is that when I get on my knees and I search him and he shows up we don't deserve that many times that's all he's asking for believe me trust me stay in your homes stay there for a while just be there amen amen God bless you tonight I love each and every one of you and I hope this was just a an inspiration to you don't fail and as we heard this morning those precious words just keep pressing on no matter the trial no matter what comes against you trust him and forget not don't forget where our Lord God has brought us from and always remember that our God is great and he's terrible he is amazing he's awesome he's marvelous he everything that he says he is and he belongs to me wow wow that's that's so personal the god of Heaven that created this Earth he belongs to me and I belong to him the Lord just gave me this scripture right now John 1513 [Music] 1 15 1513 1513 great love hath no man than this that a man laid down his life for his friends oh if you just close your eyes right now he's [Music] here you are my [Music] friends everybody claims to be
