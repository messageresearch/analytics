TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now tonight we're beginning on the fifth church age which is the church age of sardis let's say rdis sardis and the messenger to this church age is martin luther becomes more familiar to the bible scholar or this teacher the laity rather today that church age began in 1520 and ended in 1750 1520-1750 the age of what we call reformation age and the complaint was using their own name and the reward for the little remnant that was left was to walk before him in white raymond and their names in the lamb's book of life may the lord bless us as we undertake now and so uh sardis now we start out the very word sardis the first verse the word sardis in the english terms means if you look it up means the escape one now let's take the first verse unto the angel of the church of sardis write thee saying saith he that has seven spirits of god and the seven stars i know thy word that thou has a name that thou livest and art dead if you notice this this is wrote here the writer note look the seven spirits watch capital s holy spirit only one of them amen the same holy spirit coming seven times to all seven church ages bear in the same light amen get it now amen church ages seven times this holy spirit would carry this same message look he used the spirit of elijah and when elijah elijah went away elisha received a double portion of it and when elisha got sick and dying then it come back again on john the baptist same thing made him act just like elijah did living in the wilderness and so forth that right and predicted to come again amen in the last days see god uses the spirit i don't doubt the same holy spirit that filled paul with the holy ghost and the things that he done well phil listen irene is for the holy ghost field uh martin for the holy ghost the rest of the holy ghost they feel you and i from the holy ghost and it's the pentecostal blessings from one church age to the other alpha and omega the end and the beginning and all amen rooting offspring of david morning star rose of sharon little valley whatever more father son holy ghost he that was which is and shall come out for me oh all in all oh i believe we'll just carry on just a little bit with this first one yet i know thou works thou has a name that thou livest and art dead turn over to the next church here you find out but thou has not denied my name following church not denied my name but in this church you have a name amen watcher this church said his name this church kept his name this church cares his name and this church went through a dark age there's nothing said about it when it comes to the life on this side the first little escaped one when luther pulled him out you have a name amen that you are alive but you are dead now what name did they use after you quit using jesus name father son holy ghost there ain't no such a thing it's a dead it's a dead theology now notice this now let's read the next verse watch be watchful and strengthen the things which remains that are ready to die for i have not found our works perfect before god isn't that beautiful oh my love it not perfect why they were just justified amen luther preached justification amen they had to be sanctified and that filled with the holy ghost and then there wasn't their own they were perfected by the holy spirit in them it's not the not the christian that's perfect it's a perfect holy spirit in him that's why as i said it ain't the holy mountain it's the holy god on the mountain not the holy church not the holy people but the holy ghost in the church and in the people that's the holy part things that are ready to die hold on to him now he says sure now in the third verse remember therefore how thou has received and heard i like that and hold fast and repent if therefore thou shalt not watch i will come unto thee as a thief and thou shall not know the hour that i come upon thee hold fast to your justification stick to it don't let that people stop that back away from me that also that you have received you heard they read the same bible that we read see but they just didn't take all of it because it wasn't revealed to them it wasn't father age that's the reason that they'll come forth in the resurrection they walked in what life they had to walk in so they'll all right hold fast that what you've heard let's it die now the fourth verse i believe this thou has a few names [Music] even in sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me and wipe for they are worthy as you know he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and i will not blot his name out of the book of life but i will confess his name before my father and before the angels it has near let him hear what spirit says unto the church god trying to warn them here to stay out of this nickelodeonism stay away from there keep their garments unspotted from any things of the world just stay free in him and he would lead him he got it now that's the first beginning now the escape ones is the one he's talking about that's these right here this little bitty group here that's living by justification now look they come out they've seen the light luther turned right after the death of luther not luther they're never made no organization is that bunch after him amen wes they never make no organization is that group bad for him i'm old founders of pentecost never made an organization he's a group after that that's the one that doesn't see it's the second round that does it the real angel of life will never make an organization you'll find out on this all this pentecostal age what comes at the end of that organization too they when the holy spirit reveals it to us now he said you've got a little bit of life left just a little bit it's ready to die it's dwindling it's just justification they can swing anyway you haven't got any life yet because you took the wrong name but you're you're at least you've been snatched out see you are you you've escaped the roman church now the church age began about 1520 when the roman universal catholic church had full swing that lasted until october the 31st if you're all putting it down october the 31st 1570 18 when martin luther nailed his 95th thesis on the church store in whittingburg germany and from that time the reformation was on amen from that date the reformation set in the fire began to fly tested that catholic church standing there that is saying he said this being the holy body of christ it's a wafer in our little wine whammy's on the floor that's right now it was a great political rally but it was not for the holy scriptures and uh and uh holy ghost it was a political rally that he did get rid of some of the old relics of uh the crucifixion hail mary's and [Music] amen yes brought forth uh so yes that's right it did the the revival done some pretty good things that revival but it didn't bring forth the holy ghost they didn't bring that forth to down this later seeing age down the pentecostal age but it did do one thing this revival done some things that he said don't let it die now strengthen it keep adding to it see it brought forth a free bible to the people again the lutheran age brought forth the free bible they made their oppressed and begin to give the world the bible god bless the lutherans for that amen yes sir they put the bible back in the laith his hand again watch us priest alone so now the lutheran revival what they wanted to strengthen now you've got the bible in your hand now read it believe it don't let up on the shelf say well we got a bible that ain't going to do no good up there amen there's too many lutherans in pentecost today laying the bible around taking what somebody else says about amen brother read the word amen search the scriptures were there they would testify on me said jesus and then you think you have eternal life that's the thing to do read the word they did turn from idols and they turned from idols that is true they took down the idols out of church mary joseph and and peter paul all them they turned from the idols but they did not turn to the risen christ luther turn them from the idols but into more like a politic or uh our denominational organization and make themselves just another organization an image like the first one and try to outgrow it by the denomination lookie resurrect that if this book falls to the floor now to take another book and taking his place isn't restoration resurrection you have to bring the same one up amen so if the church died through the dark age and become completely pagan back here then the restoration the re that's a reformation to reform but to be reformed and borned again is two different things [Applause] they brought back reformation reforming getting away from a lot of their idols and so forth but they never brought the holy ghost back in the church home let it be the name brother sister can you see it amen they never brought the holy ghost back because the one that really brings the true gospel life put on your cap now the one that brings the true gospel light is the angel of the church down here amen don't you love it amen this good holy spirit gospel ohio 11 i love him with all my [Music] heart
