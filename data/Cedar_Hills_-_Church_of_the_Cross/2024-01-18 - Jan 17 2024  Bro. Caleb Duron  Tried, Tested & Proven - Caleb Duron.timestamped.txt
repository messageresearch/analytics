[40:56] or nor has it even been
[40:59] recorded of what things God has prepared
[41:01] for

[41:42] amen so it reads like this finally my
[41:46] brethren be strong in the Lord and in
[41:48] the power of His
[41:53] might chapter 6 verse 11
[41:57] put on the whole armor of God that we
[41:59] may be able to stand against the Ws of
[42:02] the
[42:08] devil and then verse uh 12 here for we
[42:12] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[42:15] against principalities against Powers
[42:18] against the uh what it say sorry Ru
[42:22] rulers of Darkness of this world against
[42:24] spiritual wickedness in high
[42:36] and then I do have another scripture but
[42:38] be uh two more references but we'll do
[42:40] uh James in a little while but for now
[42:42] would you turn to First
[42:44] Peter amen First Peter chapter
[42:48] 1 and uh 6 through
[42:52] eight 6 through
[42:55] eight
[42:57] is that six to eightth
[42:59] there okay yeah six says wherein you
[43:02] greatly Rejoice though now for a season
[43:05] I want everybody to repeat for a
[43:14] season if need be you are in heaven is
[43:17] through manifold
[43:23] Temptations verse seven says that the
[43:26] trial of your faith being much more
[43:30] precious than of gold that perish though
[43:34] it be tried with fire might be found
[43:37] unto praise and honor and Glory at the
[43:42] appearing of Jesus
[43:47] Christ
[43:55] Hallelujah
[43:58] whom having not seen you love in whom
[44:01] though now you see him not believing you
[44:04] rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
[44:08] Glory
[44:14] Hallelujah let's bow our heads to
[44:17] pray father we love you thank you for

[44:32] ever speak to the hearts of your
[44:36] children those that are
[44:38] here those that are
[44:40] watching wherever this message will
[44:43] go may it cause a
[44:47] Revival within the
[44:49] believer in the name of the Lord Jesus
[44:52] Christ for there is none
[44:54] greater amen amen amen you may you may
[44:57] be
[44:58] seated I I want to uh go back to real
[45:01] quickly first Peter uh 7 that verse
[45:06] there because uh if you notice it says
[45:09] for the trials of your faith can you put
[45:11] it
[45:13] up for the trial of your faith be much
[45:16] more precious than that of gold that
[45:20] perish though it may uh though it be
[45:23] tried with fire
[45:27] might be found into the
[45:29] praise and
[45:31] honor and Glory at the appearing of
[45:35] Jesus
[45:36] Christ but I want to explain something
[45:39] real quick that's just not a few of your
[45:44] trials that's not your self-inflicted
[45:48] trials or trials that are are brought on
[45:51] You by
[45:53] others the ones you've asked for the
[45:55] ones you
[45:57] didn't these are all
[46:00] trials are
[46:02] permitted so that you can be
[46:06] presented is this all
[46:08] right it'll be presented and it'll be
[46:12] for the honor and glory and
[46:15] praise of Jesus
[46:17] Christ he say how can my trial be for
[46:20] the honor and
[46:23] Glory well there was a a Time way back
[46:26] in the
[46:28] day when when seemingly God was looking
[46:31] for something to
[46:33] do and I guess Lucifer was looking for
[46:36] something to
[46:38] do and they kind of run into each
[46:41] other and he said where have you
[46:44] been and Satan answers
[46:47] back oh I was just wandering
[46:51] around trying to find a
[46:54] flaw
[46:56] there's nothing I can do I'm kind of
[46:59] bored and what does God say he said have
[47:03] you considered my servant
[47:06] joob there ain't nobody like him in the
[47:10] world it's Satan goes I
[47:13] have I've looked him
[47:15] over was going to work him
[47:18] over but you got this hedge of
[47:21] protection around
[47:24] him and that doesn't mean a bunch of
[47:26] bushes
[47:28] now no there's a a group of angels
[47:31] they're circling
[47:33] job and Paul Lucifer could just not
[47:36] break through
[47:40] huh so he said if you took that hedge
[47:44] away he said he will curse you to your
[47:48] fa and and
[47:51] surprisingly the Lord says game
[47:54] on
[47:56] nothing out of you young people nothing
[47:59] really let me try a different
[48:02] way
[48:06] bet
[48:09] bet goes all right
[48:12] bet so God says but
[48:16] just don't touch his
[48:19] life and don't touch his
[48:22] body now that was in the beginning right
[48:25] but we've heard that later on in life
[48:28] something like don't touch the
[48:31] oil and don't touch the
[48:33] wine the this whole idea of being
[48:36] tempted and
[48:38] tried it's not so much that God didn't
[48:41] have uh didn't know what job would
[48:46] do because God knew perfectly well what
[48:50] job was going to
[48:53] do you know to some extent job knew what
[48:57] he was going to do to some
[49:01] extent job knew what he would
[49:04] do to some to some
[49:06] degree but a lot of us think we know
[49:09] what we would
[49:11] do can somebody say
[49:14] Amen if it was me Brother
[49:17] David if it was me in your
[49:21] situation I would simply do this this or
[49:24] this
[49:26] I would say thus thus
[49:28] or I don't know what you're
[49:31] doing come on David say
[49:34] amen and job had three friends like that
[49:38] too stood there for seven
[49:41] days now I know I got
[49:44] friends and I've got friends but I never
[49:48] had friends to stare at me for seven
[49:53] days but first of all seven minutes into
[49:55] have been like what y'all looking
[49:57] at you what do you want get out of here
[50:00] right but job just sat there
[50:03] too and they sat
[50:06] there what did you
[50:08] do why is all this
[50:12] happening maybe job didn't know it
[50:15] then but first Peter tells us
[50:18] now that he'll receive
[50:21] him all the honor and all the glory and
[50:25] all the praise because through your
[50:29] Temptation and through your
[50:32] trial you will not stop loving
[50:37] God you will not stop praising
[50:40] God we got nobody else to
[50:43] blame it's not this one or that
[50:46] one it's the devil he tricked
[50:51] you he trapped you he did make you do it
[50:56] but somewhere along the
[50:59] line we said Lord Lord I need you right
[51:08] now come
[51:10] on that's what makes us who we
[51:13] are because we don't give
[51:16] up and we don't stop we don't quit
[51:20] fighting brother Bram said at the end of
[51:24] deep calling to the
[51:27] Deep he said
[51:29] Satan we are
[51:31] weak but we are not
[51:36] Defeated come on we got to do better
[51:38] than
[51:39] that maybe some of you feel weak tonight
[51:42] huh let me tell you you might feel
[51:45] weak you might be weak but you were not
[51:53] defeated amen amen it might seem like
[51:56] you're
[51:58] defeated and you might seem like you're
[52:02] finished and you might seem like I can't
[52:05] take one more minute of
[52:07] this let me encourage you
[52:10] tonight just
[52:12] turn your
[52:17] eyes see it there is a way of
[52:22] Escape that way of Escape has been laid
[52:24] out for
[52:28] see job didn't have it like
[52:31] that so God wasn't proving job to
[52:37] God it was partly to prove job to
[52:40] job because job had to realize who he
[52:45] was I mean come on let's be
[52:48] real job started getting kind of funny
[52:53] there sitting on a pile of
[52:57] [Music]
[52:58] ashes his boilers you
[53:02] know getting count it
[53:04] down but then he received
[53:08] Revelation the lord
[53:11] giveth and the lord taketh
[53:14] away blessed be the
[53:18] name he started to wake
[53:20] up and come into
[53:22] praise he said and though these worms
[53:25] eat
[53:27] my yet in this
[53:29] flesh I shall see
[53:33] God are you with
[53:35] me so then God was proving a little bit
[53:38] of job to
[53:42] job but what this contest was really
[53:48] about God was proving
[53:52] job to
[53:54] Satan
[53:56] that's right you see it so what I'm
[54:00] going
[54:01] through what what you're going
[54:05] through partially is to prove us to
[54:08] us so brother Caleb I can
[54:12] realize who I really
[54:15] am is anybody with me
[54:18] now huh huh it it was just
[54:22] recently don't let me lose that bring me
[54:24] back to that
[54:26] somebody you're going to have to help me
[54:28] all right okay it was just
[54:31] recently that I begin to watch
[54:35] people and brother Diego it finally hit
[54:39] me it isn't Flesh and
[54:43] Blood it isn't your
[54:46] fault it isn't me against
[54:49] you it isn't this church against that
[54:53] chur it isn't that that sister wanted to
[54:56] be that
[55:00] way
[55:01] anybody it isn't that that brother woke
[55:04] up one day and said I'm gonna be the
[55:05] best drug addict there
[55:09] is come on
[55:11] somebody he didn't say I'm going to try
[55:13] a
[55:15] heroin just get myself
[55:18] addicted I'm going to drink every day of
[55:21] my
[55:22] life just throw my life
[55:26] away nobody starts off like
[55:30] that sin always takes you further than
[55:34] you wanted to
[55:36] go are you with me the Lord our
[55:41] God is a
[55:45] gentleman but the Devil is a molester of
[55:49] people I'm trying to be careful hope you
[55:52] understand God won't BSE himself on no
[55:56] body but the devil will take whatever
[55:58] you won't give
[56:01] him so what part of it is our
[56:06] responsibility we didn't get enough Holy
[56:10] Spirit to combat the devil at his own
[56:15] game so how do we get out of
[56:18] it it's simple turn to the way of
[56:23] Escape turn turn to the
[56:26] blood turn to Christ
[56:29] Jes now it isn't God not going to come
[56:31] down and do it for
[56:34] you you're going to have to do it
[56:38] yourself and you can do all
[56:43] things wait wait wait it's not Christ
[56:45] will do all things through
[56:48] you no it's I can do all
[56:52] things through Christ
[56:55] you get the
[56:56] difference we're wanting Christ to do it
[56:59] for
[57:00] us but he wants us to do it through
[57:04] him how can we do it through
[57:07] him oh because he already did it that's
[57:12] why is that right are you with me all
[57:15] right the fight is
[57:18] on and it's becoming
[57:22] tense the devil is trying to destroy you
[57:26] and me and brother William tears all the
[57:31] pieces but my God is
[57:35] real and he's real in my
[57:38] soul my God is real for he is
[57:43] washed and made me
[57:46] whole oh it goes on his love for me for
[57:51] me is like pure gold
[57:56] my God is
[57:58] real I can
[58:00] feel in my
[58:02] soul somebody say
[58:04] Amen this is not a lost
[58:08] battle not at our
[58:11] end we are
[58:14] Overcomers by the blood of the
[58:17] lamb and the word of Our
[58:22] Testimony is that right
[58:26] this
[58:28] nonsense can I say what the prophet
[58:32] said this one here brother Bram
[58:35] said now don't say
[58:39] this well I'm a weak well I'm
[58:43] weak uh my faith is not very
[58:47] much I'm not a very good
[58:50] Christian well I don't know anybody
[58:51] who's a good
[58:53] Christian good
[58:57] Catholics I don't know any good
[59:00] Muslims come on somebody help me out
[59:03] throw me
[59:04] something he said I'm not a very good
[59:07] Christian he said that's just what the
[59:09] devil wants you to
[59:12] think so I'm an
[59:15] alcoholic what who said that I'm a drug
[59:19] addict I'm a loser I'm a
[59:23] failure well who told you
[59:26] that oh wait wait wait let me try it
[59:28] this way uh have Giants in the
[59:31] land we can't take
[59:34] it we're too small for
[59:36] them who told them
[59:40] that so it's the same
[59:43] difference with the bride of Jesus
[59:47] Christ going into the promised
[59:50] land and we are
[59:53] saying there's too many Giants over
[59:55] there we can't do it we're we're I'm not
[59:58] a good Christian I'm a
[1:00:01] loser my faith is not
[1:00:03] strong I can't
[1:00:06] quit it's your fault you made me this
[1:00:09] way it's the pastor's fault he wasn't
[1:00:11] there for
[1:00:17] me brother Bram wasn't
[1:00:21] real those prophecies
[1:00:23] were
[1:00:25] oh come on can I go
[1:00:27] there we can explain this this and
[1:00:30] this you know they tried that with Moses
[1:00:34] too they explained
[1:00:37] why the river was
[1:00:40] poisoned then the frogs
[1:00:43] left then they died then the flies came
[1:00:48] they were just all
[1:00:51] circumstances well then tell me this how
[1:00:54] did hail fall from a clear
[1:00:59] sky and burn his fire on the
[1:01:04] ground explain to me how the firstborn
[1:01:07] of Egypt
[1:01:10] died and nobody else you might get away
[1:01:13] with some of the other
[1:01:17] stuff tell me how two million people
[1:01:19] crossed the
[1:01:21] sea on dry land
[1:01:25] and just by the same
[1:01:27] coincidence when Pharaoh went in
[1:01:30] there the water just decided tough
[1:01:36] fall right you can't explain
[1:01:39] Moses you can't explain away those
[1:01:42] things so don't tell me brother brandham
[1:01:45] this and brother brandham that and
[1:01:48] brother stop being a
[1:01:50] copout um quit making excuses
[1:01:56] and just simply tell me you're not a
[1:02:00] Believer and leave the rest of us
[1:02:02] Believers
[1:02:04] alone okay is that all
[1:02:07] right I'm not going to your
[1:02:10] house trying to convince
[1:02:12] you I don't go to your denominational
[1:02:14] church and try to disrupt
[1:02:17] you by the way why don't you take your
[1:02:20] church separating nonsense where am I
[1:02:22] getting this from
[1:02:25] and try that stuff on a denomination
[1:02:29] somewhere because it ain't going to fly
[1:02:31] in our
[1:02:33] ranks brother brandham was
[1:02:37] Vindicated you're
[1:02:39] not there's a picture of a pillar of
[1:02:43] fire I don't care how many selfies you
[1:02:47] got I don't care how many filters you
[1:02:51] use you ain't got no Pillar of Fire over
[1:02:54] here
[1:02:57] come on so stop
[1:03:00] saying I'm not a good
[1:03:02] Christian that's just what the devil
[1:03:04] wants to hear you
[1:03:05] say talking his
[1:03:10] language brother brandham said don't
[1:03:14] never let your
[1:03:17] testimony be
[1:03:19] negative let it be
[1:03:22] positive all those
[1:03:29] I want a positive
[1:03:32] amen a little more
[1:03:36] positive see he said all the time I am
[1:03:41] saved I have God in my
[1:03:44] heart I believe him with all my
[1:03:47] heart with all my heart your testimony
[1:03:52] always your
[1:03:55] everything never permit a negative
[1:03:59] thought your mind if you can help
[1:04:03] it is this all
[1:04:06] right but the problem with us Believers
[1:04:09] is a prayer
[1:04:12] line instead of
[1:04:15] focusing you know like the little train
[1:04:17] engine that couldn't you know I think I
[1:04:18] can I think I can
[1:04:22] I sounded funny sorry
[1:04:24] we ought to be going up I do believe I
[1:04:26] do believe I do
[1:04:28] believe don't let the devil get a word
[1:04:30] in edge
[1:04:34] wise that brother ain't got discernment
[1:04:36] somebody must have told him
[1:04:39] that or he
[1:04:42] guessed or he read your Facebook or
[1:04:45] something like
[1:04:47] that you know that's why I don't got
[1:04:49] social
[1:04:51] media that way if the Lord shows me
[1:04:53] something
[1:04:55] you can never tell me I saw it on
[1:04:56] somebody's
[1:04:57] face Facebook that that's just too much
[1:05:00] that's too
[1:05:01] easy but I do see a
[1:05:04] screen and I do see what you're
[1:05:07] doing 90% of the time I don't even tell
[1:05:12] anybody
[1:05:14] right because God has to permit you to
[1:05:16] do
[1:05:18] so may I'm sidetracking may I go
[1:05:21] on got a little more time said you can't
[1:05:24] I can't help the thoughts from
[1:05:27] coming he said but just do like the
[1:05:30] farmer
[1:05:32] does just don't let them plant any nest
[1:05:36] in your
[1:05:38] head he said and if it starts to come
[1:05:43] on he said no
[1:05:45] sir Jesus Is My
[1:05:48] Savior all things are
[1:05:53] mine let me try that again all things
[1:05:59] are everything is
[1:06:02] mine so then why the trials why the
[1:06:07] tests because if God doesn't let you go
[1:06:10] through
[1:06:12] it you're never going to rise to your
[1:06:15] full
[1:06:18] potential you're never going to see that
[1:06:21] you can speak the
[1:06:23] word
[1:06:25] you can never going to see that you can
[1:06:28] pray and if you have faith as a mustard
[1:06:32] seed you could say unto this mountain be
[1:06:35] thou
[1:06:37] removed and cast into the
[1:06:40] sea and it shall be
[1:06:42] done there's somebody back
[1:06:45] home who is tackling a a a a problem in
[1:06:50] her
[1:06:51] life she just decided one
[1:06:55] day I'm not going to do this and this
[1:06:57] and this
[1:06:59] anymore and I stood there
[1:07:03] watching and progression is getting
[1:07:06] better and better and she's getting
[1:07:08] stronger and
[1:07:12] stronger so let's get down to real
[1:07:14] business
[1:07:16] ready well brother Caleb Duron Caleb
[1:07:20] what did you
[1:07:22] pray it wasn't me
[1:07:25] what sermon did you preach that help
[1:07:27] this young
[1:07:30] lady
[1:07:32] nothing well what what word did you
[1:07:34] speak that caused it to
[1:07:38] happen it was nothing I
[1:07:41] did but what
[1:07:43] happened the young lady touched the Hy
[1:07:46] of His
[1:07:52] Garment
[1:07:55] you
[1:07:56] understand when Jesus
[1:07:59] comes the tempter's
[1:08:03] Power I said when Jesus
[1:08:07] comes the tempter's
[1:08:10] power is
[1:08:14] broken it's
[1:08:16] broken it has no more
[1:08:19] power it has no more
[1:08:22] strength
[1:08:24] I've told this
[1:08:26] before you remember this when I said
[1:08:29] Samson when he's in
[1:08:32] there it wasn't what the Philistines did
[1:08:34] to overpower
[1:08:38] him they overpowered
[1:08:41] him and it was his own
[1:08:44] fault he told a
[1:08:47] secret he was his own
[1:08:50] doing but see Samson
[1:08:54] when he was working in that Mill
[1:08:57] there began to
[1:09:00] remember the former
[1:09:04] glories of a day gone
[1:09:08] by
[1:09:10] remembered the time that I
[1:09:13] prayed and I asked God to deliver
[1:09:17] me did the time that I
[1:09:21] prayed and nobody was there
[1:09:24] and nobody could help me but I cried out
[1:09:27] to
[1:09:28] God
[1:09:30] remembered God was
[1:09:32] faithful and he came down on
[1:09:37] the sorry did you catch me interject
[1:09:40] myself in
[1:09:42] that that's why I know what
[1:09:45] happened
[1:09:48] remembered going around in
[1:09:51] circles and I killed a lion with my bare
[1:09:53] hand
[1:09:56] I carried off the gates of
[1:10:00] Gaza I took a Jawbone one
[1:10:04] time and I beat back 1,000
[1:10:09] Philistines I remember those
[1:10:12] days and all of a
[1:10:14] sudden he got hot and
[1:10:19] sweaty and he r

[1:10:33] [Music]
[1:10:35] stubble brother I don't care I don't
[1:10:37] care if they shaved him the next
[1:10:39] day it was never about the
[1:10:43] hair commitment to
[1:10:46] God can you imagine if he if I'm right
[1:10:49] can you
[1:10:50] imagine he just felt that
[1:10:52] stubble

[1:10:58] shout he can't see

[1:11:03] corner Lord I don't care if they save me
[1:11:07] tomorrow my hair didn't do

[1:17:14] say that there was a a a like a comic I
[1:17:18] used to think was funny comic
[1:17:22] strip
[1:17:25] and um it was Satan sitting on a
[1:17:31] rock looking at the
[1:17:33] world and he's
[1:17:36] crying and and Michael the Archangel
[1:17:38] comes
[1:17:40] along what's the matter he said I'm
[1:17:43] getting blamed for a bunch of stuff I
[1:17:44] didn't
[1:17:46] do Michael goes there
[1:17:49] there and I used to use that and he to
[1:17:53] say he's
[1:17:55] right it's not his fault he just lays
[1:17:59] out a
[1:18:00] trap and you make a
[1:18:04] choice wait a minute wait a minute I got
[1:18:06] quotes to say
[1:18:07] different brother Bron said it's not
[1:18:09] your
[1:18:10] fault you got
[1:18:14] trapped and I realized the Lord made me
[1:18:16] realize couple days
[1:18:20] ago that by me using that example
[1:18:25] I was throwing an
[1:18:28] anointing of condemnation on my own
[1:18:33] congregation I couldn't figure out why
[1:18:35] they couldn't like
[1:18:39] overcome because I was telling them it
[1:18:40] was their
[1:18:43] fault so a couple of Sundays
[1:18:46] ago I made them all repeat after
[1:18:49] me are you
[1:18:51] ready
[1:18:54] it's not my dad's
[1:18:58] fault it's not my mom's
[1:19:04] fault all right it's not the pastor's
[1:19:11] fault it's not God's
[1:19:16] fault I'm not a
[1:19:18] loser come on everybody I'm not a
[1:19:21] loser not a
[1:19:25] failure I am not an
[1:19:29] accident I have a
[1:19:32] purpose I am not a
[1:19:36] disgrace say that one
[1:19:42] again I
[1:19:44] am a
[1:19:46] child of
[1:19:51] God
[1:19:55] it's
[1:19:57] strange how excited my church got all of
[1:19:59] a sudden
[1:20:03] yes so now we're singing a different
[1:20:07] song I'm no longer a slave to
[1:20:12] fear I am a child of
[1:20:17] God in James chapter
[1:20:20] 1 verse uh
[1:20:24] 12 and I I'm gonna start wrapping it up
[1:20:28] here it says
[1:20:31] this put on my old man eyes here we
[1:20:35] go blessed is the man that endureth
[1:20:43] Temptation okay I'm going to finish
[1:20:45] reading it then I'll go back to that for
[1:20:46] when he has
[1:20:51] tried he shall
[1:20:54] receive the Crown of
[1:20:57] Life let me see if I'm getting that
[1:21:01] right which the Lord had promised to
[1:21:04] them that love
[1:21:07] him okay now I'm a little bit what is
[1:21:10] this all
[1:21:12] about let me get this
[1:21:14] right it does not
[1:21:16] say blessed is the man that goes around
[1:21:21] it
[1:21:23] or over
[1:21:25] it under
[1:21:27] it no it doesn't say that
[1:21:30] does endure
[1:21:33] means to continue in the same
[1:21:38] state now I'm not
[1:21:41] saying that if you fall in Temptation
[1:21:43] you just go on with it I'm not
[1:21:46] saying but it means to continue in the
[1:21:49] same
[1:21:51] state if if you get stuck in a
[1:21:57] trap you're to still continue to praise
[1:22:00] God no matter
[1:22:03] what you continue to conduct yourself as
[1:22:07] best you
[1:22:11] can as a child of
[1:22:14] God you know don't let nobody say to
[1:22:18] you aren't you ashamed coming to church
[1:22:21] like that
[1:22:25] if you want a if you want an example of
[1:22:28] this watch one of the testimonies from
[1:22:30] Billy Paul brother Billy
[1:22:32] Paul Paul because he said his dad never
[1:22:35] treated him that
[1:22:38] way his dad never rebuked him as far as
[1:22:41] going to
[1:22:45] church but when he did show up the

[1:28:36] finished you just got
[1:28:44] tricked you just got lied
[1:28:48] to but there is a truth
[1:28:52] that has been planted in your
[1:28:55] heart since for most of
[1:28:58] us before we were ever
[1:29:01] born matter of fact for all of
[1:29:04] us before the foundation of the
[1:29:08] world there was something put
[1:29:11] there it would always call us
[1:29:16] back to where we come
[1:29:19] [Applause]
[1:29:20] from
[1:29:23] he goes on to say in
[1:29:26] James verse 13 now let no
[1:29:31] man let no
[1:29:33] man say when he is
[1:29:38] tempted I am tempted of
[1:29:41] God for God is not tempted of
[1:29:47] evil uh uh and neither tempted he any
[1:29:51] man
[1:29:53] so God doesn't do
[1:29:55] it he allows the devil to do
[1:30:00] something and I I hope I you understand
