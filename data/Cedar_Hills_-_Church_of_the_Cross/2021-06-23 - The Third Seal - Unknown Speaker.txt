========================================

we have come again tonight lord to attempt uh this meeting and to pray thee to open to us lord this third seal of this book that it might be known to us that we would know or what to do and how to live and how to be better christians now tonight we're going to read from this blessed old word again in the sixth chapter and we start tonight with the third seal and that is the fifth verse the fifth and sixth verse now in the fifth verse and when he had opened the third seal i heard the third beast say come see and i'll be held in low a black horse and he that set on him had a pair of balances in his hand and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts saying a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny but see thou hurt not the oil and wine and there was no man in heaven no man on earth no man beneath the earth or nobody was even worthy to look at the book see now just think of that then the lamb comes forward and he takes the book now john was asked not to weep anymore he said the whole the line of judah has prevailed and and he can take the book and open it so he turned to look for a line and he saw a lamb the elder called say a lion has prevailed but when he come and looked it was a lamb coming out from the throne for he was bleeding for the people intercessing for the people until the last soul that was put on the lamb's book of life before the foundational world come in there's just going to be so many of them there and that's it that's all the others won't even want to come and have no desire to come in and so then when that last soul comes in then the time of redemption is finished then the lamb comes forth to claim his rights to what he has redeemed and that's all creation then he said he is worthy to take the book of redemption now it doesn't belong back to the judge anymore it belongs to the redeemer and he's done done the work of redemption now comes christ you see him in the 10th chapter of revelations this right let's discuss him if you'll notice the first rider who he was and we found out last night scripturally that the second writer was exactly the same man only he was on another horse what happened it changed his ministry right we found out he was an antichrist and it changed his position now watch where we're at tonight that other church age now or come down to the third church it's exactly on the third church agency this psychological third horse this rider is the same one but another stage of his ministry now john sees him on a black horse it changed something else he has started riding him in the time of the dark ages that's what the dark horse represented the dark ages for it was a time of midnight to the true believers that was left his balances are his scales in his hand you see calling out measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny see actually that is wheat and barley is natural staff of life that's what brands that's made from but you see he was charging for this what it means that he was charging his subjects for the kind of the hope of life that he was standing out to them by making he started in that very time of making them pay for prayer charging for prayer they still do it no penis because what was he doing capturing the wealth of the world the scale weighing out measure of wheat or if any three measures of barley for a penny the rider on a black horse see he was making stripping his subjects of their money when the bible predicts that evolves about the wealth of the world now notice you see where that old money taken in church comes from [Music] to build an organization a big something million dollar here charging for prayer by the priest to pray people out of purgatory charging i'm taking this right out of the history charging for i guess it's novenia i guess what everybody knows what the opinion i guess that's uh something you have to do you know some penance somebody at the charge for that notice here's a good part now notice see that thou hurt not this [Music] just a little bit of it left baby don't you touch that now oral is symbolizes the spirit the holy spirit i'll give you a few verses if you want yours through scriptures in leviticus 8 12 where aaron before he went ahead be anointed with the arlington and zechariah 4 12 the all coming pouring through the pipes and said this is my spirit or another thing if you want to see matthew 14 25 there was a foolish virgin 25 3 the foolish virgin had no oral no spirit and matthew 25 4 the wise virgin had all in her land spiritville now oral typifies spirit and wine symbolizes stimulation of revelation oh i i like to run over the place i wanted to wake up the neighborhood and the lord showed me that [Music] stimulation of revelation okay oil and wine in the bible is associated together always i got the concordance look the street on that lag it's like that where wine and oil goes together all the time see of god and the true believer filled with oil and the revelation is revealed the stimulation becomes so great that he makes him behave his self a [Music] [Applause] [Music] normal to this rider in black don't you hurt my wine and my oil don't you touch it my wine oil i've got just a little bit of it down there but he's still a little bit there [Music] now you can go on through and measure out all that kind of life it's your butt not that's up to you you're going to pay for it down there but when you come across that wine or you leave it alone i was here and i and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts what was it the lamb [Music] [Applause] [Music] what's the four beasts the lamb said it wow don't take his own that belongs to him amen don't you touch that barrel not sir not the four beasts but the lamb was the one that said it oh my amen the lamb not the four beasts didn't announce this the lamb said itself well to the best of my understanding and the best of that i know and with all that i believe in my heart that's the true meaning of those three seals i want to thank god for it and i'll say this that it's a revelation that he gave me he gave that to me the revelation and i do believe that we're living in the last days it's the words [Music] wonderful you
