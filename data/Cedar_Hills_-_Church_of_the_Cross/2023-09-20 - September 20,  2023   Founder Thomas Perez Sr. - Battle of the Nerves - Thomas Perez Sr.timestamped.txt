[43:41] more scripture that's found in the third
[43:43] chapter of the book of Exodus
[43:46] tres
[43:49] and the 13th verse versiculous and Moses
[43:54] said unto God
[43:56] behold when I came unto the children of
[43:58] Israel
[43:59] and shall say unto them that God of your
[44:03] fathers has sent me unto you
[44:06] and they shall say to me what is his
[44:10] name
[44:11] what shall I say unto them is
[44:25] and God said unto Moses I am that I am
[44:30] and he said thus shall now say unto the
[44:34] children of Israel I am have sent me
[44:38] unto you here
[44:45] may the Lord add His blessings to the
[44:48] reading of the word and you may be
[44:50] seated
[44:55] amen
[45:08] you know that I am is here with us this
[45:12] morning
[45:21] but when you are confronted with the
[45:23] situation
[45:25] you do not realize that I am is
[45:35] we live in a very nervous age
[45:39] we all are aware
[45:45] one nervous now that they have ever been
[45:47] done
[45:50] nervousness has hit Humanity
[45:55] I want to read a quote from Brother
[45:57] Branham
[45:59] in the last message that he preached
[46:02] while he was here on this Earth
[46:06] in the message communion
[46:10] he said this because Esto
[46:13] and notice the words
[46:16] we also can look around
[46:19] and see that the way that the human mind
[46:23] is living the people
[46:28] I want to repeat that again
[46:31] we can look around
[46:33] and see that the way
[46:37] that the human mind is living the people
[46:44] ESO
[46:47] the human mind
[46:50] is living the people
[46:55] that we can't stay must
[47:03] we'd be in a complete insane Institution
[47:11] the whole world would be
[47:15] part of the world
[47:17] but the whole world
[47:20] would be in a complete insane
[47:23] institution
[47:30] is
[47:33] [Music]
[47:38] that the prophet of God yes
[47:45] the human mind is that the mind is
[47:49] living the human body
[47:51] that the human mind is leaving the
[47:53] people I should say
[47:55] is
[48:00] not because a man is
[48:22] [Music]
[48:26] nobody else
[48:29] only the Lord
[48:35] you can see that anywhere
[48:39] I was shocked the other day
[48:45] when I read this article
[48:48] articulum of a man what he did to his 10
[48:52] year old daughter in Elsinore Lake
[48:54] California
[48:56] in California put her in a nice chest
[49:00] generator and dumped her into the lady
[49:21] how can a man
[49:26] do that
[49:28] even to a dog
[49:29] [Laughter]
[49:33] you know that in itself should be as
[49:37] well
[49:38] I found out then
[49:41] what the prophet says Professor when he
[49:45] says that the human mind is leaving the
[49:47] people
[49:49] we can see that all around
[49:52] we can see how people are so nervous
[49:55] today
[49:57] we all see that don't we the police
[50:01] people are so nervous
[50:03] you see people going down the highway
[50:07] and it's a hustle bustling
[50:12] they're trying to hurry to get home
[50:18] they get out of work they can hardly
[50:21] wait to get home
[50:25] to sit down watch television and drink
[50:28] some beers
[50:33] matter they run over somebody
[50:36] the children are nervous
[50:39] you're fine even in the elementary
[50:41] school elementary we find the children
[50:45] smoking marijuana
[50:47] marijuana they do that because they're
[50:49] nervous
[50:51] they don't know what to do with their
[50:53] times
[50:58] probably just inside the church
[51:01] I would find not a woman a lot of men in
[51:04] here
[51:05] they have no fingernails
[51:08] [Laughter]
[51:18] and nervousness
[51:22] now that's a bad condition together
[51:25] find people that in their bodies
[51:33] foreign
[51:48] and they get this rash over their body
[51:53] they say well I got an allergy
[51:57] a lot of it is not an allergy
[52:00] it's nervous that it's a nervous system
[52:05] do you know that the nervous system is
[52:07] connected to your spinal cord
[52:12] it's connected to the vertebrae
[52:15] it's connected to your brain
[52:18] and these fibers when they get irritated
[52:22] well it is done by a control center
[52:25] foreign
[52:48] and conditioned Health happens
[52:51] in every family
[52:53] that sometimes we don't know how to cope
[52:58] stay well we something is going on in my
[53:02] home
[53:03] if this is going on in my home
[53:05] I don't know what to do I don't know
[53:09] what to do the word of God

[53:19] [Music]
[53:20] [Laughter]
[53:31] [Music]

[53:41] at the end the Lord says Be not Afraid
[53:45] or dismayed by reason of this great
[53:47] multitude Made It by a foreign
[54:14] okay
[54:46] [Laughter]
[55:23] forgive us
[55:33] that is what gave him the courage
[55:37] Moses had to have a solid foundation
[55:42] he had to know what he had believed
[55:45] can you imagine
[55:57] Minecraft
[56:06] I notice
[56:10] and I pray that you understand what I

[1:00:27] if the promise has been giveness
[1:00:34] you don't understand
[1:00:48] when you try to do good
[1:00:51] I want to tell you what the Bible says
[1:00:58] a lot of people say I believe in God but
[1:01:00] I don't believe in the devil
[1:01:03] well I don't believe in the devil but I
[1:01:05] believe there's a devil oh you know
[1:01:09] he is stronger
[1:01:12] he is
[1:01:21] but he is so wise
[1:01:28] that he makes you happy upstairs to
[1:01:32] believe
[1:01:36] it okay
[1:01:39] are you interested in your nails leave
[1:01:41] your nails alone
[1:01:43] even right here they're nervous
[1:01:49] people yeah
[1:01:56] attempted
[1:02:01] to believe okay
[1:02:07] but God is a
[1:02:10] prophecya God gives a word
[1:02:13] Heaven and Earth will pass away
[1:02:15] but his word is not going to pass away
[1:02:21] but what happened I had a young man call
[1:02:24] me yesterday from some other place I was
[1:02:27] safe where because then you don't know
[1:02:28] who I'm talking about um

[1:03:08] try to do good yesterday
[1:03:21] I come out of these homes and I had to
[1:03:24] run to another home
[1:03:30] that's that's bad
[1:03:37] when I try to do it
[1:03:42] when God gets ready to do something
[1:03:46] he commands the people to stand still
[1:03:51] stand still
[1:03:54] I want to read something here with if
[1:03:56] you want to read with me in the Book of
[1:03:58] Numbers
[1:04:00] Chapter 13.
[1:04:03] we'll find here where
[1:04:05] where the Lord has spoken to Moses
[1:04:11] and he told him to send man to search
[1:04:14] the land of Canaan it is
[1:04:19] okay
[1:04:23] yeah
[1:04:25] and the Lord didn't tell him to choose
[1:04:27] just any man
[1:04:30] he said it had to be head of the tribe
[1:04:33] they woke up
[1:04:36] they had to be rulers
[1:04:41] and two of the men that went with this
[1:04:46] were Caleb and Joshua
[1:04:50] I want you to notice
[1:04:52] then Moses sent them to spy the land of
[1:04:55] paintings
[1:04:57] whether they were strong or weakness
[1:05:01] [Music]
[1:05:03] whether the cities they dwell in were
[1:05:06] good or bad yeah
[1:06:13] he said but
[1:06:38] let us go on
[1:06:59] we live
[1:07:02] the other ten words did not believe God
[1:07:06] [Music]
[1:07:08] that is the same thing that happens in
[1:07:12] our generation
[1:07:14] that's what happens in our generation
[1:07:16] it's easy to go to church
[1:07:39] is that right
[1:07:44] we're either going to believe God or the
[1:07:46] devil
[1:07:48] that's too hard
[1:08:23] they could go in and possess the land
[1:08:29] foreign
[1:09:23] there was a
[1:09:25] there was a man by the name of Tom Foy
[1:09:30] the older man not the attorney
[1:09:35] and not the young one that got killed in
[1:09:37] the plane accident
[1:09:41] he was a good friend of my daddy
[1:09:44] because my dad is 90 almost 92 years old
[1:09:47] right now
[1:09:48] but my dad was a carpenter
[1:09:51] and Tommy had a lot of land that
[1:09:54] stretched all the way down the battery
[1:09:55] down there
[1:09:57] and he told my daddy one day he says
[1:10:01] Pedro Pedro you see all that land
[1:10:05] oh that is fine
[1:10:07] my dad says
[1:10:10] how much do you have upstairs
[1:10:14] he didn't say anything
[1:10:18] one day all this will be mine because it
[1:10:23] is
[1:10:27] you might have it for a little while
[1:10:29] but it don't belong to you
[1:10:32] when Israel was going when he was we're
[1:10:36] going through all these cities that he
[1:10:37] ties the mri's the jebusites and so on
[1:10:47] God said it belonged to Israel
[1:10:54] why we're so nervous
[1:10:58] things
[1:11:00] belongs to the children of God
[1:11:04] oh I'm sure that I did we can't take it
[1:11:07] over right now
[1:11:09] I'm not speaking about men like this
[1:11:11] but because someday it'll all be ours
