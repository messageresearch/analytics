[Music] [Music] these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the lord god made the earth and the heavens and every planet of the field before it was in the earth and every earth of the field before it grew for the lord god had not caused it to rain upon the earth from the earth and water the whole face of the ground and the lord got four men of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul entonces his blessing to the arena the word you may be seen the days of thunder los diaz all the mystery of the gospel oh el mysterio and closed the heavens for three and a half years and under that screaming for his life the anointing had left him he he under the thread of a woman called jezebel um give me genesis 2 6 again hennessey says the nuevo but there were not a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground all these years that i've been ministering my favorite book is genesis as genesis and revelation e apocalypses brother baron says those are the two books that satan hates the and you follow my messages most of them are genesis revelations messages on the genesis is the apocalypse you want to know the beginning and the year the face of the ground did it water the ground listen so you can learn he could only use the dust now we're going to find out oh my goodness hallelujah i only learned this less saturday when i was studying for my message is [Music] my tutors were the two best teachers in these messages so then this is the mystery of the gospel like many ministers have said much now to him there is a power to establish you according paul did not the apostle paul did not say the gospel of jesus christ he said this is my gospel so am i preaching this morning my god the gospel is good news the word doesn't give you good news this morning so who is bringing yeah because even of jesus christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world begins is made manifest nations for the obedience of the revelation of faith this generation is corinthians 4. remember that a man saw account of us as of the ministers of christ and stewards of the mysteries of god moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful verse 5 therefore just nothing before this time until the lord come who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the councils of the hearts and the he shall shout there shall every man have praise of god thunderings remember the title of the message the days of thunder and all the peoples of the thunderings and the lightnings and the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking and when the people saw it they removed and stood off todd and they said unto moses speak thou with us and we will hear but let not god speak with us lest we die he says and moses said unto the people fear not for god has come to prove you and that his fear may be before your faces and the people stood up far off and moses drew near unto the thick darkness where god was entonces and brother branham went to that cloud or into the thick darkness and you say how can god abide in darkness it's not darkness like you go into a dark room at your house but it says that god was in the thick darkness brother says he was amen amen revelation 6 1. apocalypse says uno and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and heard the see where the noise of thunder one notice that the seals open with the thunder so if the seven seals open with the thunder and brothers said that the sails were in the book of genesis should they also be open with the thunder hey and what is it was notice when the first hill was open the bible says or the sun open it light it wasn't the sun it was the father who opened the seal and the evening in the morning were the first seal amen amen sixth there were six days of creation so then there is the enemy came preaching another doctrine wasn't her husband her pastor superstore and he held the word of god did she go to another place to hear another minister preach a different doctrine and she believed the lie of the devil and what does the bible say [Music] [Applause] abraham search for a city abraham the prophets in job prophesy of somebody that was coming and man became more wicked and he grieved god said he had made men so where was the water going to come from you a sweet and then and the animals knew better what that thunder was than men the people heard that thunder he says they were scared and one by one that they go entering into the ark the voice of god is thundering not only this morning it's thundering all the time and the humanitarian the animals enter into the arctic and god saw the wickedness of man idiots so when the atomic bombs hit entonces it hit the cold atmosphere and produce the first clouds and then they dumped all the water here on earth i was in the arizona desert arizona when a blessed like a thunder shook the whole earth the thunder was the voice of god under it says in the book of first thessalonians and premiere senses let's read it and i didn't give it to you but now that first thessalonians 4 premier league attacks is capital quattro yeah 4. 416. he went to the cloud like moses here for the lord himself shall descend from heaven is and i'm not going to mention names no women are numbers but in those early days as mean the and dude the first one not because he already came but do the voice of archangel and the trumpet of god the pastor there from lima peru called me and i will say which one i'm not going to tell you android is not how many churches are the messenger in lima peru because each one has their own doctrine and one of the doctrines is it's going to be a tent and he has to give the voice to the archangel and then the trumpet of god and that day i'll have to answer the god for what i'm preaching to you today standing behind this pulpit all the honoring glory goes to god how do you stay in my position i don't go from house to house he said i want you to teach me this verse what the message says because there's many voices going around talking about this very same scripture he says i wish i had the voice of the archangel now and the voice of the archangel is the voice of resurrection elisha said i want a double portion of your spirit if you see me when i go then you will receive it when elijah was lifted up [Music] one portion was manifest when brother branham was here the resurrection but here's the the thing right here remember it has two parts when brother branham was here who's tell this you you and you were dead in that system then when the message came that's when the thunder came come out from amongst my people and with the trumpet of god to gather the people [Music] yeah there's going to be a war with satan yes but to be able to gather the people all you people that are here you come from different countries different states different so what drew you to las cruces it was your brother-in-law mike thomas perez girl ex-pastor no he's still fester superstore he's still festering in caleb perez once i got here you know this is stan lucky because you gotta be obedient to the world never said to it's only a film of moisture condensed on surface is droplets but god hit a plane light and water loose hour and water is a solvent it is a liquid that dissolves or can so water is two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen what was the second part one part oxygen hydrogen is the simplest element it is the most flammable and plentiful guest in the universe that is a giant bowl of hydrogen and helium and in the sun's core centro del sol hydrogen atoms combine to form helium guesses this process is called fusion the reaction increased two atoms of hydrogen so it's the process of fusion of the radiant energy that sustains life here on earth and because hydrogen is so much lighter than air it rises fast and is quickly ejected from the atmosphere that's why hydrogen is united into god of the earth and satan be became not only god of earth but god of the heavens and men in those days did not have the holy ghost but they were moved by it moved by faith he say a libra to the time of the end and then that day the wise will understand and you are the wise because you are here this morning you have given your life to jesus jesus there was an atmosphere over the years of darkness the prayers could not come up there was no atonement no via expiation and when jesus was baptized in the jordan river in rio jordan the heavens were opened and then he told peter moses god had been manifested in the flesh and peter pedro he got the revelation of the name you are the christ you are the christ christian son of the living god because flesh and blood has not revealed this and the lord said yes to you i will give you the kiss to the king and peter opened the door to the heavens he was given the keys if there is no sacrifice on the altar you where is your sacrifice now he's talking to each and every one of us if there is no sacrifice on the altar then your prayers cannot be after this jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled says i thirst what's worse was it 1928 versus now there was set a vessel full of vinegar and they filled the sponge with vinegar and in it was hot up and it was putting to his mouth in when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bought his head and gave up the ghost jesus can you imagine what they gave and instead of hearing the wine that's what the revolution that they had yes they gave him vinegar imagine they did not understand because he was thirsty and gave vinegar with hospital you've said you've seen that since genesis father oh we can write straight and we could preach about revelation of course because of his position henry henry we couldn't understand because he was far ahead of all of us that's why god chose him to be an apostle president and when he had so said he showed unto them his hands and his side then were the disciples glad when they saw the lord then said jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so then are you entonces jesus pasta and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them [Music] he said receiving the holy ghost they receive the holy ghost right then and then mismo and i looked at the ministry you'll be a minister and i said what kind of spirit did he receive get people that are spiritual because after jesus said that especially peter denied the lord three times and he cursed cursed bad words came out of his mouth how am i doing the man with the holy ghost do that commercial american spiritual son to put them all deceased when jesus said receiving the holy ghost was and ye will receive the promise amen it's good yeah amen when jesus uh arose and appeared to his disciples and and said receive the holy ghost because ten days later on the day of pentecost the abstract came down then later in the first church age this place it started fine coming in but they began to drift from the world and then the rebuke came because coming to this message in malachi foreign the way to heaven is we're going to build a tower that goes to heaven why are there over a hundred churches in lima peru peru they have their own tower of beverages [Music] they want to reach god with vinegar they want to go get to god with the vinegar because it will be like but what is vinegar
