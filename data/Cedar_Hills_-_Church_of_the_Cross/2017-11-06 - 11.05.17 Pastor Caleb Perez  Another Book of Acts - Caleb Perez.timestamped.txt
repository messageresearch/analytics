[25:36] and we are the actors of this Seventh
[25:39] Seal I believe that what is its if they

[25:46] of Acts desmond thermo-skin is pure
[25:49] libro de los hitch and we can easily say
[25:51] well it was the holy ghost through a man
[25:54] that wrote the book of Acts is Peter
[25:56] Santo and I say amen to that a policy
[26:01] remain but let's find out first of all
[26:03] who wrote the book of Acts with the
[26:06] keenest cure and to who it was ravine
[26:08] written to yeah kissing estamos viendo
[26:11] he says once again in the first chapter
[26:13] in the first verse the former treaties
[26:16] have I made all Theophilus they say
[26:20] primero I must have bla teófilo how many
[26:22] knows that he's speaking to a man by the
[26:24] name of Theophilus was having a Sarafian
[26:27] hombre amount earful Oh watch as as he
[26:31] starts the book of Acts this way
[26:34] physical in cuenta que los they chose
[26:36] the former
[26:37] treatise wanted your former it means
[26:44] foremost in place order or importance or
[26:48] time algo que s anterior it's the
[26:53] beginning or the first of it all is the
[26:56] primero o lo interior and the word three
[26:58] ties or treatise is location
[27:01] aguado is actually the very word logos
[27:03] is the mismo
[27:05] now here's the book of Acts starting
[27:07] this way I'll leave a little citrus
[27:09] Commons and the writer is telling this
[27:12] this as he begins to write this book he
[27:14] told me he's saying the former or the
[27:18] first time that the logos ever came into
[27:22] flesh
[27:23] look at this oil in logo says Esquivel
[27:27] the first time it came into flesh okay
[27:30] we know write the FIR the form or the
[27:32] first time this happened la primera vez
[27:34] que con tus here's what I wrote about to
[27:37] you Theophilus the first time it's
[27:39] looking lipstick if you know premier I
[27:41] need you to get this because I don't
[27:43] want to run with it I want you to get
[27:45] this kit okay captain is he's already in
[27:48] the book of Acts talking about the logos
[27:50] from deliver the sisters coming talking
[27:53] about the first time that the logos was
[27:55] ever made flesh and dwelt amongst us
[27:58] well appearance can logos mustn't say
[28:01] that is what this writer began to tell
[28:05] it's okay Stace Couture in PS Kaviri the
[28:08] rider is stating yes
[28:11] logos which is the very embodiment a
[28:15] low-cost kissing incarnate of the
[28:17] thought and word of God and is God de la
[28:21] palabra de cemento the deal was what he
[28:23] had first written in his previous book
[28:26] or his previous writing Escobedo
[28:29] interior meant for he says all that
[28:33] Jesus which is the word por que todo lo
[28:37] que de his suitcase lapel and the logos
[28:39] made slash and logos that you currently
[28:40] began both to do and to teach commenced
[28:44] o primeiro as there in singer and as the
[28:46] god man como el hombre Dios the gospel
[28:50] which was written is what he did 11
[28:52] Haley okay for the Romero case so but
[28:55] the book of Acts para liberal in Los
[28:57] Zetas is what he continued to do is
[29:00] local continuously in his mystical body
[29:03] here on earth su cuerpo Mystik wok
[29:06] oenothera what this writer is saying
[29:08] look at this is discreet or is that what
[29:10] he
[29:11] written before yes could be the one it
[29:13] was what the logos and a look a local
[29:16] who had been made slash for the first
[29:19] time in Jesus Christ yesterday
[29:21] apparently Romero and his sous Chris had
[29:23] started to do and teach salsa dancing
[29:27] yeah let's go to what the first riding
[29:29] was then vamos entonces our I'll ok
[29:31] fella premier sk2 Luke the first chapter
[29:34] look as capital oh no you have it can
[29:36] say Amen he cannot think and see this in
[29:39] a minute now
[29:39] there is a connection there with a book
[29:41] of Acts with the Book of Luke are you
[29:43] not gonna extend aqui con hoc loop
[29:45] because the Book of Luke Luke as the
[29:48] former treatise that he is talking about
[29:50] so lesson Luke 1 says for as much as
[29:55] many have taken in hand to set forth in
[29:58] order a declaration of those things
[30:00] which are most surely believed among us
[30:11] even as they delivered them unto us
[30:14] which from the beginning were
[30:16] eyewitnesses and ministers of the word
[30:20] or of the logos Piero della palabra and
[30:29] it seemed good to me also having had
[30:32] perfect understanding of all things from
[30:34] the very first to write unto thee in
[30:37] order most excellent Theophilus may
[30:41] operatio Tambe enemy después de ver

[30:53] actually one case when I thought they
[30:55] were divided into two but on TV the same
[30:57] but both were written by the man called
[31:01] Luke there are mosquitoes put it long
[31:03] and he's writing it to Theophilus see
[31:06] let's discover your feel alright we got
[31:07] that this morning yes the kids the offal
[31:10] is that's a good name
[31:12] the problem is is that nobody knows who
[31:15] Theophilus is preliminary kena still
[31:18] feel oh no one knows who Theophilus was
[31:20] again in al Theophilus don't feel as
[31:25] Luke is referring to him there are
[31:28] several different theories as to who he
[31:30] really is
[31:32] we know he's addressing a person because
[31:38] he calls him most excellent Theophilus
[31:40] particular a my own when yo and the
[31:44] phrasing most excellent
[31:46] excelencia is the title often used with
[31:49] someone of honor or rank they were stuck
[31:52] on the cell excelencia that t2 loss will
[31:54] meant a of the tango but however we also
[31:56] believe the mink ramos that Luke is
[32:00] addressing a group of people also okay
[32:02] look as their the retail group again
[32:04] he's addressing a group of people on
[32:07] group for the hint is cool through the
[32:09] ages would have a lot to do with not
[32:15] only what he wrote look in this video
[32:18] but would be a continuation look as they
[32:21] do not continuous off what Jesus had
[32:23] began to do and to teach for what we do
[32:30] know what K look at systems yes that's
[32:32] the name Theophilus means loved by God
[32:36] is a mother than yours or a friend of
[32:39] God own amigo that yours and therefore
[32:41] when I read Luke and I read acts look as
[32:45] he's writing it to me all Theophilus
[32:48] he's writing it to you all Theophilus
[32:53] because you and I are a friend of God
[32:56] but could use this suppose amigos who is
[32:59] the friend of God give this to me he
[33:01] says now I was gonna keep this you can
[33:05] either make honest no but Abraham is my
[33:08] friend now I cannot keep any secrets
[33:12] from my friend you know poverty never
[33:15] say criticism yummy therefore if Abraham
[33:18] is typing the elect of God what is this
[33:21] kiss your rod tip if we can loosely heal
[33:22] then the Book of Luke and the book of
[33:24] Acts was written to the elect of God
[33:27] Lucy look as the men who escrito Alice
[33:29] Ellie and I'm okay with calling you are
[33:31] all excellent Theophilus your sales
[33:35] trivia mandalas excelencia or trophyless
[33:37] so how many here know
[33:38] that the book of Acts was written for
[33:40] you what design can you know satisfies
[33:41] Peter Pan upstairs now the question is
[33:44] who is your book of Acts being written
[33:46] to we don't want to tell you the end of
[33:51] the story before we get to the middle
[33:52] knocking him was a ceiling fiend any
[33:54] story a scene that you got me the book
[33:56] of Acts is the fifth book of the New
[33:58] Testament illiberal Quinto libro del not
[34:01] written by Luke who was a non Jew as
[34:04] Keita palookas can know enough with you
[34:05] and we all know that Luke was a
[34:07] physician he said mascara on medication
[34:10] that traveled with Paul Medicaid a
[34:13] tremendous man of God now I want you to
[34:18] know this now is that there are people
[34:21] that say that the book of Acts was not
[34:25] actually suitable for teaching of the
[34:28] church
[34:30] violence against a legalist there are
[34:33] those that have said that the book of
[34:34] Acts liberal shows that that was the
[34:37] framework of the church lately saying
[34:41] God for a prophet who told us yes
[34:44] prophetic and that the framework of the
[34:46] church community list here's Matthew
[34:48] Mark Luke and John is Lucas mark was one
[34:53] these Gospels are what protects it and
[34:55] holds it together
[34:57] EMM they are the framework to back
[35:01] Pentecost for after the framework was
[35:07] put up there is a case where entire a
[35:10] mother who then Pentecost came into
[35:11] existence
[35:12] Pentecost is equal eXistenZ here and
[35:14] this book of Acts is actually the
[35:17] foundation or the doctrine of apostles
[35:20] and prophets as it fundamentally opposed
[35:22] to Lizzie prophet that's Jesus Christ
[35:24] being the chief Cornerstone - Christos
[35:26] Hindu la Piedra and now I'm going back

[39:11] our killer polymerase and see that ought
[39:12] to put the church in action next yeah
[39:18] that ought to put the church in action
[39:20] give up until iglesia cuz when the
[39:22] church comes into action
[39:25] another book of Acts is being written
[39:28] oh my let's get back to acts now chapter
[39:32] 1 where we were at
[39:33] IHS Cuffy for John truly baptized with
[39:37] water but ye shall be baptized with the
[39:42] Holy Ghost not many days hence memos
[39:46] about the cells at his feet to sanctum
[39:47] and when they were there for her come
[39:49] together they asked him saying Lord wilt
[39:53] thou at this time restore again the
[39:55] kingdom to Israel in towel Esperanto
[39:59] diciendo Senora satirist reign o Israel
[40:02] and este tiempo but what they didn't
[40:04] know was that the promise of the father
[40:07] Erik Allah promises and poverty is what
[40:10] was going to restore the kingdom and I
[40:13] look
[40:13] but it was going to restore it in a
[40:16] spiritual form not a natural form yet
[40:19] there with me here they had they didn't
[40:23] understand that because they were
[40:25] promised the Holy Ghost but I guess it
[40:27] is prometheus because but they didn't
[40:29] even know what the Holy Ghost was
[40:30] serenebean Carol is free to son how many
[40:33] believe that I know that has believers
[40:35] become okay again we have been promised
[40:37] the Holy Ghost signals that from a
[40:39] fearless speed to something yet many
[40:40] don't even know what the Holy Ghost is
[40:43] encased many don't know what the Holy
[40:46] Ghost was given for okay for that though
[40:48] they did not understand because they
[40:51] have the man Jesus in front of them
[40:54] break loose delante but now this man
[40:57] going to ascend back to the office of
[41:00] the Father he was sent there I love fish
[41:02] yourself and he was going to send his
[41:04] spirit back to the church with that
[41:07] spirit in the church listen it would
[41:10] write a book of Acts
[41:13] my lips let's keep on reading here
[41:16] window he said unto them it's not for
[41:20] you to know the times or the seasons
[41:22] which the father hath put in his own
[41:30] power came by the Busan to Seoul a
[41:33] protest and this is the time as this as
[41:37] simple and the season he lets the Sun
[41:39] but it's not for you to know because as
[41:43] human beings
[41:45] CACO most areas to man we don't grab we
[41:47] don't understand these neighbor to
[41:48] carnal but he placed the times and the
[41:52] season push all those tempo sinlessness
[41:53] harness in his power in stewpot they
[41:56] stand there the times and the seasons
[41:59] are not anywhere else but in his power
[42:03] come on that's what the father placed it
[42:05] is Don del padre like busto let's lift
[42:09] as this begins to unfold watch this down
[42:11] is it look at these things so the
[42:12] father's power is or in the father's
[42:16] power is times and seasons and this is a
[42:19] letter sent by the Telos tiempo see
[42:21] lessons done and no one knows except he
[42:23] that receives that power in
[42:26] as no muscle can receive a star
[42:28] processor then by the Holy Ghost in this
[42:31] is pointless that'ss comes to dwell in
[42:33] you when you will recognize your day and
[42:38] its message let us test with the ice
[42:40] woman's sake that's when you know and
[42:43] more recognized or reckon when it is
[42:47] your time and your season to act this
[42:50] with you push yourself but Atwater not
[42:52] until you've carried no statistic spit
[42:55] us not until the Holy Ghost has come to
[42:58] you will you know when to act Sam come
[43:02] on twatter are you with me you all know
[43:05] it without that no I saw very loosely
[43:07] that's why we're always trying to do a
[43:09] lot of things and it's not even in here
[43:10] it's not even his will but as my sister
[43:12] said muchas cosas us in those who were
[43:14] trying to do God a service and it's not
[43:16] his will many time that was the silliest
[43:18] rewarding rescuing why because we are
[43:21] trying to force the issue right to make
[43:25] it that season of it that case we'll say
[43:28] is not the time for that but when the
[43:32] Holy Ghost comes upon the Inga verse 8
[43:35] but ye shall receive power that it was
[43:39] so does your mother receive it for then
[43:40] and the word power there means Dunamis
[43:43] and we've heard that which means
[43:45] dynamite it looks huge shall receive
[43:50] dynamite give us a spirit in a melee
[43:52] received power after the Holy Ghost has
[43:57] come upon you Wizkid is protective
[43:59] Inga's focused and you shall be
[44:01] witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem he
[44:04] was the lamb in all of Judea and in
[44:07] Samaria of Samaria and unto the
[44:10] uttermost part of the earth Jesus began
[44:15] to do and to teach dancing yet but when
[44:19] you receive this power this Holy Ghost
[44:22] and receive a step further then you go
[44:24] to the uttermost part is mostly coast
[44:28] and the worst word uttermost Elop Alaura
[44:31] means the final place or time in a
[44:35] series of events it's a new era FINA
[44:37] they'll necessary the Amano's Jesus was
[44:39] the logos embody the History Center
[44:41] logos increments for the first time the
[44:44] logos put on flesh was in Jesus for the
[44:47] premiere of risky Lobos se puso Kevin if
[44:49] we kill him dwelt the fullness of the
[44:51] Godhead the way of Pentecost when love
[44:56] goes broke up because the logo says but
[44:58] each one received a portion that
[45:01] belonged to them guiltless do not pull
[45:03] and they became witnesses except and His
[45:07] Holy Ghost in his church
[45:09] you know let's pick the center see let's
[45:10] go to the last one that would that would
[45:13] be that would come in find the last one
[45:17] to the uttermost parts that's why we're
[45:21] going next month to agonda maybe that
[45:25] last one might be a colored man kiss a

[1:28:53] redemption looks they say something
[1:28:55] happened today what happened today the
[1:28:58] scene was set for the actors to start
[1:29:03] acting but a kind of sick Buddhist for
[1:29:05] me since we have to act together for
[1:29:08] that sir pool to do something for the
[1:29:11] Lord but I can't disagree long ago funny
[1:29:13] morning said you know here it comes is
[1:29:15] unfolds and something happened in an
[1:29:17] unknown tongue nor language I'm a
[1:29:20] linguist corners what was that the seven

[1:30:12] the first pool let's play a person if he
[1:30:14] can he can impersonate the second
[1:30:16] estando

[1:30:21] if you want something to be kept a
[1:30:24] secret he began to secure is that gonna
[1:30:26] keep it in your heart think that wants
