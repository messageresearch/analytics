[28:33] over
[28:47] another scripture says
[28:51] in another scripture says

[29:01] I'm also going to read another scripture
[29:02] in the Book of Matthew chapter 5 verse
[29:04] 6.
[29:21] verse 7 of Matthew chapter 5.
[29:26] San Mateo blessed
[29:31] are they which do Hunger
[29:33] and thirst
[29:35] after righteousness
[29:37] for they shall be
[29:40] filled verses
[29:48] another scripture says
[29:51] the place says they will be satisfied
[29:54] amen
[29:55] do you have any tonight I believe God
[29:57] can satisfy it is
[30:02] because he's done it for me
[30:07] just back up just a little bit
[30:13] in second Samuel chapter 15.
[30:18] absolutely the rebellious son of David
[30:20] Absalom
[30:23] expels him out of Jerusalem
[30:28] and he's standing back at a distance
[30:30] he's fleeing for his life is
[30:36] soldiers and he's watching Jerusalem
[30:39] from a distance yeah
[30:44] and he can remember
[30:46] how he praised and worshiped God in
[30:49] Jerusalem
[30:54] yeah
[30:57] somebody had taken it from him
[30:59] he wanted to go back it's a deep is
[31:04] the deep in Jerusalem
[31:08] was calling at him
[31:10] he was pulling at him
[31:15] foreign
[31:46] and Desiring
[31:48] he was maybe in despair he's never in
[31:51] this respiration
[31:59] I want it tonight
[32:05] do you want the Deep to call the Deep
[32:08] yes
[32:10] Lord must have that desire
[32:13] because if there's the Deep
[32:15] there has to be a response
[32:18] and God is the response it is
[32:26] adios attention
[32:34] is a young man
[32:36] what's your age 18 16. Keisha King said
[32:40] this is
[32:41] like a little older into my young
[32:43] adulthood
[32:47] I will sit in church yeah
[32:51] as many of you know I was raised in the
[32:53] apostolic belief
[32:58] I would sit there and listen to
[33:01] them
[33:06] but something in my spirit is
[33:16] and and I hesitated
[33:20] as a young man
[33:23] you you you see the brothers up there
[33:25] and did you foreign
[33:41] but as they read the scriptures
[33:44] my spirit was telling me
[33:47] there's more to this I must
[33:50] there's more to this
[33:52] and I want
[33:55] that more yo quiero ESO I'll go I want
[33:58] more of that what you're telling me
[34:02] there's more to this I must
[34:06] there was something deep in me
[34:09] that was calling for the Deep because I
[34:18] if you dig deep and you search in the
[34:22] Deep you will have a responsibility
[34:30] but you gotta dig deep
[34:36] says we have to go a little deeper
[34:40] he did right he encouraged us correct
[34:52] Aya
[34:53] my mouth is getting dry
[34:56] but I found a Fountain of Life
[35:05] so as a young man I had this desire in
[35:07] my heart
[35:14] did I asked
[35:15] my brethren that was before me yo
[35:21] the bishop is a practice
[35:25] deacons ministers
[35:38] where's the fivefold ministry ministerio
[35:42] where is

[36:14] powerful yes and they are men
[36:17] they are men
[36:20] inspired inspiragos by the spirit of God
[36:23] foreign
[36:26] and they're going to help you and I hey
[36:30] to go the last smile and prepare us for
[36:33] the sickness
[36:38] that was my question
[36:40] and I waited yesterday
[36:44] until I entered the ministry
[36:47] if I were to ask when I was a young man
[36:49] they would have said
[36:51] um
[37:00] where is the Bible Ministry you
[37:01] understand
[37:04] their answer to me was
[37:10] that's Old Testament news yesterday

[37:17] there's a new testament there's a
[37:18] division two divisions

[41:14] constant it's constantly constant
[41:17] constant power more of God get on Master
[41:20] deals I want to get deeper
[41:22] and I know that there's a response if
[41:24] there's a deep there has to be rich

[42:04] amen
[42:08] which do you believe what let's do
[42:12] the Bible
[42:14] or the message
[42:18] and in my Apostolic mindset in memente
[42:21] Apostolic
[42:24] you can imagine what my responsibility
[42:30] the Bible
[42:32] the Bible Brothers
[42:40] this has traveled with me to the prisons
[42:46] Boston
[42:47] Austin uh Boston
[42:50] California California
[42:51] 10 15 years
[42:55] and I know God's in the house
[42:58] because he's wearing a red coat okay
[43:02] he's in the house
[43:04] this is what I grew up with
[43:10] but yet growing up in this there was a
[43:12] hunger amen
[43:17] I needed it satisfied
[43:22] and I keep passing God in my heart
[43:26] there's more to this father
[43:28] there's more to this Lord
[43:32] give it to me Father damn it share with
[43:35] me Lord compartment you know my heart
[43:38] you know my heart is
[43:40] searching for you I need you alone
[43:49] a man after God's Own Heart
[43:57] so again my response was
[43:59] the Bible Brothers
[44:24] the brother's asking me a question but
[44:26] if I answer it this way
[44:32] disaster
[44:36] but the Bible has an answer for
[44:37] everything
[44:39] and you know what brother
[44:42] you were saying the other day
[44:45] four or five Believers
[44:48] from Genesis
[44:58] the old apostolics
[45:00] apostolicos would see us
[45:05] in Spanish
[45:15] we Are Witnesses amen
[45:18] just raise up the banner let's raise up
[45:20] the banner we Are Witnesses
[45:22] amen some of Genesis Revelation yeah
[45:28] so not to Brother Jimmy's response
[45:33] there's no wrong answer
[45:39] is it no no I that felt pretty good yeah
[45:45] the right answer
[45:46] yeah
[45:49] right in the fifth grader won the
[45:52] spelling bee okay
[45:59] and uh and he says Whoa really brother
[46:03] Jim yeah
[46:04] it goes
[46:06] the Bible
[46:08] the Bible
[46:11] without the message
[46:14] has no interpretation
[46:20] and we need help with interpretation
[46:23] I need help
[46:26] and God sent a prophet yes
[46:34] he sent them to me
[46:35] say that again and I got the tail end of
[46:38] brother Tommy seniors Ministry
[46:42] and brother Abraham I heard him play the
[46:46] trumpet
[46:48] his mouth was a trumpet
[46:51] he didn't play Trumpets
[46:54] he didn't play trumpet he was a trumpet
[46:59] and you all heard the sound system
[47:03] loudly clear
[47:17] oh I only get to see him in videos
[47:23] man I sometimes
[47:25] the business
[47:26] if my head comes
[47:29] if I had just come soon
[47:37] I would have been able to receive more
[47:40] but that's okay
[47:43] that had me for this time
[47:45] for this time
[47:50] so I'm gonna take
[47:54] El Mira
[47:56] I'm gonna go to the well
[47:59] like that woman went to the world
[48:02] and I know if he tells me only you knew
[48:07] who talks to you
[48:11] I would hug him
[48:14] I drink all the water in the pond
[48:18] and I would walk beside him
[48:21] and if I had to I'd hang on the cross
[48:24] with him
[48:30] amen
[48:33] so then back to brother Jimmy Greek
[48:35] we're not done with you yeah
[48:38] there's no wrong answer brother
[48:42] the Bible
[48:44] without the message
[48:46] has no interpretation
[48:48] but the message
[48:52] there's no Foundation
[49:00] so I will stand on the word
[49:03] and I will stand on the message
[49:10] we'll eat them both
[49:17] Genesis to Revelations

[58:11] David
[58:12] was different
[58:17] in the morning

[58:22] not of any God
[58:25] of the Living God
[58:27] you are thirsty
[58:41] [Applause]
[58:44] got to do is to look for God
[58:47] when the generals
[58:50] when they were preparing themselves
[58:54] and they would get to the Palace
[58:57] they would tell the priests
[59:00] we need to speak to King David
[59:03] we are ready to go to battle
[59:07] the priest would say
[59:09] you're gonna have to wait
[59:12] because David is praying
[59:26] looking for the presence of God
[59:31] I'm gonna put a little bit of flavor
[59:36] when David knew and he would find his
[59:38] army man
[59:41] King David we're ready to fight Los
[59:44] Angeles
[59:45] armies are ready
[59:47] I imagine King David

[1:01:51] that hinders us
[1:01:54] to look for the one has given us the
[1:01:57] things
[1:02:00] in a
[1:02:02] in anywhere else
