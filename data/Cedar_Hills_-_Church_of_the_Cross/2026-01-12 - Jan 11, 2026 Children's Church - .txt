Sorry, having some technical difficulties here. [sighs and gasps] Well, say good morning, but it's not morning time. You guys woke me up. You never wake up a bear from his nap. How are you guys doing this evening? Good. You sure? Yeah. Doing all right. Oh, who lit this fire? It's perfect. Nice and cold out here. You know what? I got an idea. How about you littles come over here and set up the fire where it's nice and warm. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. Let's go see how warm this fire is. Everybody take a seat. Okay. Crisscross applesauce. There you go. You guys can spread out a little bit. It's okay. Don't be too close to the fire. It's going to burn you. This is a real fire, you know. You know what? Oh, hey, little. I got something for you guys. Maybe not for everybody. I got some marshmallows. Who likes marshmallows? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; One for you. One for you. I might not have enough to go around for everybody, but yeah. Careful. &gt;&gt; Oh, this. &gt;&gt; Hey, be careful. You poke your eye out, kid. All right, &gt;&gt; one more marshmallow. &gt;&gt; Special little lady. &gt;&gt; All right, kids. Who's ready for story time? &gt;&gt; How many of you guys have been camping before? &gt;&gt; Raise your hands. Let me see. &gt;&gt; You've been camping? Yeah, you have. &gt;&gt; Cool. How many have ever read stories or told stories around the campfire? Yeah. Okay. I got a question. Who knows the difference between a fictional story and a non-fictional story? Sam, what does fiction mean? &gt;&gt; Fiction means not real. How many have heard stories that are not so real? Yeah, I've heard I've heard a lot of stories that are not real. like &gt;&gt; like I seen the biggest buck last weekend. &gt;&gt; And I almost had him, right? And then we heard real stories, right? How many have heard real stories before? I heard a ton of real stories this morning. Didn't you? &gt;&gt; Yeah. There were some good ones, too, huh? So, I got a story for you guys. &gt;&gt; And it's no coincidence. &gt;&gt; It seems like God just does everything perfect, right? &gt;&gt; Hey, you're going to put out my fire with those marshmallows. &gt;&gt; All right, kiddos. I got this story for you. Joseph, the coat of many colors. Does that sound familiar? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, &gt;&gt; brother Abraham. &gt;&gt; When did we hear that? &gt;&gt; Brother Abraham this morning. &gt;&gt; This morning, Brother Abraham shared that story with us. &gt;&gt; But we're going to make it a little more simpler for the little ones to understand. Deal. Okay. I need your guys' attention, though. You know, we got marshmallows. We got the fire going. It's nice and cozy. &gt;&gt; But now it's time to pay attention. Okay, &gt;&gt; let's do it. &gt;&gt; You got five. Cool. Long ago in the land of Canaan lived a man named Jacob. He had many animals. He also had many children. Of all his children, Jacob loved who the most? Joseph. To show his love, Jacob made a bright and colorful robe. You guys want to see the robe? Look, that's what it looks like right there. &gt;&gt; You see it? It looks different than the &gt;&gt; Yeah, it looks a little different. &gt;&gt; I didn't see that story. &gt;&gt; You didn't see that story? &gt;&gt; I didn't watch it. &gt;&gt; You've watched it? &gt;&gt; I watched it. &gt;&gt; You watched it, too? &gt;&gt; Joseph had how many older brothers? &gt;&gt; Um, like &gt;&gt; 12. &gt;&gt; Five. &gt;&gt; 11. There was 11 of them. &gt;&gt; A 20. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay, I'm hearing all kinds of different answers. &gt;&gt; Hello, sir. Welcome to the party. &gt;&gt; Listen, when they found out that their father had given Joseph the special gift, they became jealous. They didn't like it. &gt;&gt; They wanted the coat for themselves. &gt;&gt; I don't. &gt;&gt; Later, Joseph had two dreams. Does anybody remember Joseph's dreams? &gt;&gt; Yes. I remember one. &gt;&gt; You remember one of the dreams? How many other &gt;&gt; you remember? Yeah, I do. I do. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. &gt;&gt; When he told his brothers about the dreams, they became even more upset. They were mad. &gt;&gt; Joseph said the dreams showed that his brothers would someday bow down to him. &gt;&gt; You think your dreams mean you will rule over us? That's what his brothers would say at him. Soon after Joseph's dreams, the brothers had to go to take care of the animals in the fields. They were gone for a long time. Jacob told Joseph, "Go and see if your brothers and the flock are well. Then come back and tell me what you've heard." When the brothers saw Joseph walking toward them, they saw he was wearing his special robe. They got angry all over again. When Joseph reached them, they ripped off his robe. They threw him into an empty pit and sat down to eat. Does that sound very nice? &gt;&gt; No. No. Could you imagine &gt;&gt; Can you imagine being a bully to your brother? &gt;&gt; Who here's a bully to their brother or sister? &gt;&gt; None of you guys bully, right? No. Nobody. You're not a bully, right? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; He's probably the biggest bully out of all my three. A group of traders passed by the flock. One brother said, "Let's sell our brother to the traitors." Oh, that's that's so wrong. We will get money and he will live. That's a wrong mentality to have towards your brother, right? That's not a good attitude. The brothers pulled Joseph out of the pit and they sold their brother to the traders for money. You hear that? They sold their brother to the traitors for money. 30 pieces, but what they tell their father? They killed a goat and they dipped his coat into the blood. &gt;&gt; And then they took the coat to their father. Uhhuh. He said, "It is my son's coat." Jacob cried. A wild animal must have killed him. Jacob wept and wept and he cried and he cried. He was so sad. &gt;&gt; Jacob's dad was so so sad. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Nothing could make him feel better. Meanwhile, Joseph had been sold as a slave in Egypt, but God was watching over him. A court official named Potafar bought Joseph and bought him in charge of all he owned. Then one day, Joseph was blamed for something he didn't do. In fact, Potafar was so angry he had Joseph thrown into Pharaoh's prison. Joseph shared a sale with two men who had been the Pharaoh's baker and the chief cup bearer. You guys want to see the picture? &gt;&gt; There's Joseph in prison with the two other prisoners. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Let me out. Let me out. &gt;&gt; During that time, the cup bearer had a dream. Joseph explained it to him. How many of you guys have dreams? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Do you guys have dreams? Do &gt;&gt; you guys you dream a lot? &gt;&gt; I I dream every night. &gt;&gt; You dream every night. Wow. &gt;&gt; What Joseph said came true. Soon Pharaoh forgave the cup bearer and returned him to his palace job. &gt;&gt; Hey guys, check this out. Check this out. Joseph spent two more years in jail. That's a long time. &gt;&gt; But God took care of him there. One night, Pharaoh had two dreams that troubled him. But there were no one in Egypt who could explain the dreams. Finally, the cup bearer remembered Joseph. He told Pharaoh a young man who was able to explain what dreams mean. Pharaoh sent for Joseph and had him listen to the dreams. Both dreams mean the same thing. Pharaoh. Joseph said, "God told you what will happen. There will be seven good years. Crops will grow and food will be plentiful. There'll be so much food. Then there will be seven bad years. Seven good years and then there will be seven bad years. The land will be dry and no food will grow. Everyone will be very hungry." Joseph suggested that Pharaoh select a wise man to collect food during the good years. The stored food would feed the people of Egypt during the bad years. Pharaoh liked the plan, so he put Joseph in charge. He ordered people to bow down to Joseph. Does that sound familiar? &gt;&gt; Pharaoh ordered people to bow down to Joseph. What does that sound like? &gt;&gt; King. like being a king. &gt;&gt; The dreams that he had, right? That made his brothers jealous of him. &gt;&gt; He ordered people to bow down to Joseph. Now only Pharaoh was greater among the people than Joseph. &gt;&gt; Jesus is the greatest person. That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Everything happened just as if Jo just as Joseph has said it. During the next seven years, there was a wealth of crops. There was a lot of food. Who likes food? &gt;&gt; You guys like to eat? I love to eat. There is tons of food during these seven years. Yeah. &gt;&gt; During the next seven years, there was a wealth of crops. Joseph had the food gathered and stored. Then the seven years of plenty ended. During the next seven years, no food grew. &gt;&gt; That's That's terrible. But Joseph was smart. &gt;&gt; People cried from hunger in every country, but there was bread throughout Egypt. &gt;&gt; Go to Joseph, Pharaoh told his people, "Do what he says." Joseph opened the field and overflowing storehouses. He sold bread to people from all over the world. Back in Canaan, Jacob and his family needed food. He sent his sons to Egypt to buy bread. But Jacob kept his youngest brother, Benjamin, at home. He was afraid something bad might happen to him. The brothers finally came to Joseph and bowed down. They did not recognize him though. But Joseph recognized them. He pretended not to know them and asked who they were. We are honest men from Canaan. We are 12 sons of one man. The youngest is with our father. One brother is no more. They said Joseph had a plan. He said they were spies and sent them to prison for three days. When they were allowed to go home, Joseph said they had to leave one brother, Simeon, in Egypt. Then they were to bring Benjamin back to prove they were telling the truth. Joseph had the money they used to buy a grain, but put inside the bags. On the way home, they found the money. They were sure they would get in trouble. When they got home, they told Joseph what happened. Jacob, Jacob, they told Jacob what happened. Jacob did not want to let Benjamin go back with them. But when the grain was gone, Jacob realized he had to let Benjamin go. He had no other option. The brothers returned to Joseph. When he saw Benjamin, Joseph had to leave the room. Want to see? He was happy and sad at the same time. They ate dinner. They ate dinner and Joseph had the sacks of grain prepared. The servants put the money in them like before, but this time he had them hide a silver cup in Benjamin's sack. The brothers started on their way home. Joseph sent guards to catch up with them and they told them that someone had stolen a silver cup. The brothers said, "We would never do that." Do you guys think that they were that they were lying? The guards searched the sacks. There was a silver cup. They took the brothers back to Joseph. The brothers fell to the ground before Joseph and begged him to let them go. What do you guys think happens next? &gt;&gt; What do you guys think happens next? &gt;&gt; Joseph agreed to let everyone go. Everyone except Benjamin. You're right. Since the cup was in his sack, he was to stay as Joseph's servant. The boy's father will die without him, cried the brothers. Joseph couldn't keep the secret any longer. He told them who he was. Do not worry. Check this out, guys. Do not worry, Joseph told his troubled brothers. It was God, not you, who sent me here. God made me Pharaoh's ruler over all the land to keep you alive. Joseph hugged Benjamin and wept. He kissed all of his brothers. He finally told them who he was. Could you imagine? Could you guys imagine? You have a brother and you sell him off and then that brother happens to become the king. Could you imagine that? And then you finally meet your brother again and you think, "Oh man, he's going to be so angry with me." &gt;&gt; But then that brother turns around and says, "I forgive you." Could you imagine that? &gt;&gt; Pharaoh told Joseph to move the whole family to Egypt. Pharaoh said, "I will give you the best land." Everyone in Jacob's family came to Egypt. Joseph greeted them. Jacob and Joseph were very happy to see each other again. And there they are again, reunited as brothers. Does that story sound familiar to you guys? &gt;&gt; Yeah. What does it sound like? &gt;&gt; Tired. &gt;&gt; You're tired. You want to take a nap in the tent? &gt;&gt; What does that story sound like? It sounds so familiar to me. &gt;&gt; Anybody? Yeah, it's the same story this morning, but it sounds like someone else. I just can't put my finger on it. &gt;&gt; Maybe Jesus. Didn't Jesus have friends that betrayed him? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Didn't they Didn't he sell him off, too? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Senpected him and he wanted Satan wanted to be more powerful. And finally, when Jesus was on the cross, what did he say? It sounds a lot like what Joseph said. &gt;&gt; Forgive them. They don't know what &gt;&gt; forgive them for they know not what they do. Exactly. Joseph is a perfect type of Jesus. You guys are really having fun with those marshmallows. &gt;&gt; You want to take a nap? I want to take a nap, too. I'm tired. But that thing isn't really made for a grown man. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay, everybody. I just want to thank you guys. Okay, you guys did a wonderful job listening to the story. Did you guys all learn? &gt;&gt; Yeah. What did you guys learn? Tell me. &gt;&gt; They learned marshmallows are good. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Joseph is a dreamer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah, sure. What's up, bro? &gt;&gt; I learned that we need to even though they tell you, even though they bullied you, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. That's the truth, bro. Forgive. &gt;&gt; We need to share forgiveness with everybody, no matter what. &gt;&gt; All righty. Thank you guys so much. You guys can go take your seats, okay? And be careful with your marshmallows. And be careful on the stairs. [applause] &gt;&gt; Yeah, we need to put this fire out. Can we have a son of God stop the sun again? Turn the lights back on. &gt;&gt; All righty, everybody. I just want to thank you so much for gathering around the campfire with me and hopefully we get to see each other again. Okay. God bless you guys. I'm going to go take a nap now. [applause] Amen. Let's give another hand for our brother Sam. Would y'all please stand, please? Hey, man. How many? Dang, you guys really taking a lot of marshmallows. Oh, okay. Let's sing that song. I'll fly away, man. And some glad morning when this life is over. [singing] I fly [music] away [singing] to a home on God's celestial shore. I [singing] fly [music] away and I fly away your glory. [music] I fly away in the morning when [music] I [singing] die. Hallelujah. By and by I fly away. [music] And when the shadow [music] of this life has gone, [singing] now [music] fly away like [singing] a bird from prison. I fly away and I fly away.

I'll fly away [music] and I'll fly away [singing] glory. [music] I fly away in the morning [music and singing] when I die. Hallelujah. By and by, [singing] I'll fly you away. Amen. I don't believe there's any other announcements besides our service on Wednesday. So, uh, would you pray to dismiss us? Brother Jonah, &gt;&gt; please bow your heads. Lord, dear heavenly father, Lord, just bless everyone while they go home. Protect [music] them, Lord. Sanctify them, Lord, while they're driving. Bless all their children, Lord, that they've come, Lord, and received [music] the word. We love you, Lord. Just bless everyone, Lord, and Lord Jesus Christ. [music] Amen. &gt;&gt; And I fly [singing] your way your [music] glory. God fly away in the morning when [music] I die. Hallelujah. By and by [singing] [music] fly away and glory glory. [music] Hallelu. Since [singing] I did my burden down. Oh, [music] glory, glory. Hallelujah. Since I made [music and singing] my burden down, my friends [music] don't treat me like they used to. Since I live, [music and singing] my burden down. My friend, don't treat me [music] [singing] like they used to since I paid my burden down. Oh glory, [music] glory, hallelujah.
