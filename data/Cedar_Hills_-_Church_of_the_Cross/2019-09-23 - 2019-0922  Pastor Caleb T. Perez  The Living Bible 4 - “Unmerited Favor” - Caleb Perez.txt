come on now we we have the message of grace that's the only way we know what is a disgrace and let me focus on was that class we have the real and it was learn yet but there's also a counterfeit I mean I am but guess what counterfeit is a disgrace watch what he says it's a disgrace in the catacombs in Rome this is known as the sella Scott the tomb bass and drum a sign that said please American woman una said no not you guys yeah American but honest your clothes before entering this place pungen said repent isn't that I still you got in honor of the Dead and Andre los muertos water disgrace he says it is Gracia you can live just as pure to your husband by the real time puto ah su esposo but if you put on a garment that makes another man turned to look at you it's the point I wrote back a secret from bit on Altamirano on the day of judge you'll be judged for being an adulteress in the decreases that are we see our poor people dressed inappropriately to make a man look at you okay so he's doing a procurement a pyro nombre McCullough man is a disgrace Esther Sunnah is last year how many want to follow the message of grace bunch of kids against Arcadia Gracia a well-known preacher maybe you've heard recently he says I'm name is Benny Hinn Ben Hina I said what a disgrace when they they they make it the gospel a gospel of prosperity they say get this grant him out and he says sanyo is dijo he said the prosperity gospel in leprosy had preached cavea prezi Caro and to be correct corrected - I said Cora he dough he says I think now what are you appear so it is an offense to say give a thousand dollars it's an offense to the Holy Spirit to place a price on the gospel it's an offense that I see letters Penelope really spit aside yes what a disgrace CK's Gracia man yes sir yes you gave $1,000 then will the will rebuke the Devourer for your sake he obviously doesn't mean that most entrepreneurs just pay your tithes and offerings roaming but here that they want to use that - - - for what they call the prosperity gospel keystroking but apparatus and race della prosperity for this thing away from the message of grace but that's why it is the duty of every believer Justice Elda Elda talk Cragen believe in this message of grace system exactly the Gracia to live it by the Holy Ghost say we're look we're let's Pete - son Tom now I'm gonna stop here for a moment and I'm gonna ask them to play this clip of brother branham where piranhas keep room for keeping you know let's be okay talking in Romero have it ready not in the least those Christian songs and things like that before the young people and getting out in the world like that throws a greatest stumbling block more at all the bootleg gorge and everything else trees in the country it's a disgrace that that that would be even be permitted the church are to rise up and not even permanent knows he has to be sung the people like that taking a talent that God give him any influence and with their lives speaking louder than what their words are how can people make such plays disease man does instead sing hymns and things like that it's a very height of hypocrisy and we find out that that goes among Christians believers and this young man's a lot a what I think about so I think that that God loves me so much too he'll let me get by with anything I said he never did do that he never would do it even Israel his nation even David a man after his own heart Greek every green any soul yielded to each one of us will do that we know that but he got lifted up so much in his heart now I want to speak this word to the full gospel businessman he got so lifted up in his heart until he thought he could take a ministers place he tried to become a minister which he wasn't called to be and I think that's many times at work sometimes man in these ranks on the business man's group say they get to a spot that God blesses them in their business and makes them prosperous and so forth to get to a place so they take the oughta preach the gospel also and that's wrong that is wrong you should always that a minister do that preaching calls is all Roberts once said it's hard enough to keep the thing clear by ministers let alone by man who's not called for that office you should have man there that knows that our our gain for the word this proves it that he we find out that this man made a great man a good man an honorable man but he tucked the the offering the sensor and what an to the altar of the Lord the burnt incense before the Lord which is only for a dedicated priest to do so but he thought being a God loved him so much and and he been so good to him and he could go do that anyhow and the priest run edge and he said you're not our game to that office god forbids that anyone should come in there only a Levi it's dedicated to that service you should never do that that's the way many times that what's God think has got the world today in such a confusion that man go out and try to take those places which you're not our day you to do it gets to a spot to where they they try to fulfill this office and they're not called for that place now we find outdoor good man blessed of God but if God blesses you you stay in the category that God has called you in if it's a housewife remain a housewife if it's in a business remain in that business reflecting God and whatever God has told you to let it be that because he wants you to be a real housewife to reflect your influence upon another person that would want to be a good housewife if you're a good businessman let your life so beat that it will reflect Jesus Christ in your business with honesty integrity and what things ik really means something because somebody is watching your life you're influencing somebody God has to have a Real Housewife God has to have a real teenage in school God has to have a real minister a real businessman somebody that will reflect him because there they see in you Christ no matter what the rest the world's got to do that has not one thing to do with your eyes we are responsible to God for our lives and for our experience with Christ now we find out that it is trying to take the minister's place and someone telling him he's out of place telling me shouldn't do that he's out of place he become anger I heard he was so anger until his face turned red see we must be able to stand and take correction some of them won't do it you can't yeah I have went to meetings and I've set in the auditoriums and you get up and some people are come in and sit down just for a few minutes if you say one word if they don't agree with gone we flying up all that you know what happened to his a kind of doing that earth are you sorry brother God smote him with leprosy the man died and his leprosy which is a type of sin he couldn't stand to be corrected by the world many times a day it's the same thing this year my denomination believes this not on Carol see take time to search the word God will never judge the world by denomination he'll judge it by his word in his words Christ in Christ is the word they're the same yesterday today and forever he brews 13:8 [Music] that's why we believe that that the message that was brought to us by this prophet our prophet is the message of grace what a tremendous thing we find here it's not remain thank when we look at this emiram system but it is our duty then to live the message this message of grace instruments actually grass and we can only live it by the Holy Ghost you must be beautiful as you did but if you don't get the Holy Ghost no obviously not tennis because the Branham says we are wrapped in Christ enrapturing grace Thomas M well toes and elements we are here souls read of all men so most epistle and let us know what our book is wrapped in in history it was time well tone is in a rapture in grace and and Gracia we will we get grace we receive it on the resume most grass here as I said it comes with a responsibility in economic responsibilities I should say responsibly that number one to give grace una primera is the data Gracia Hall says here in Ephesians a bloody second if yes ye have heard this is Ephesians three to a festive stress dose of the dispensation of the grace of god which is given me to you word see erase we don't allow this possession della Gracia this your scheming with other me but I what Paul had received by grace okay Pablo Vieira civil de Gracia he was willing to give it unless Thomas's personal expense I don't know how many of you are willing to give what God has given you what does that disperse those are looking to hoard it and to keep it to yourself nurse but I kissed a sick is it gonna tell you to give it its produced elevate what good is it to give you something and then you keep it to yourself the Cosima cannula del gusta Killick no but I want to I want to give you an example this morning as we as we open it up into or we get into this word better kill Lila sooner
