to the crowd the crawdad hoe about to go catch me some craw daddy you you know now i'm hungry hold on oh okay i guess y'all brought me back by popular demand one more time okay i gotta put myself to the side i'm hungry laura ain't gonna talk to you if i'm hungry take my thing off okay you know what i was doing before i came here i'm building the house because my last one i built it first when it came through blow that thing down flatter than pancake you know why i had no mortar in between the cracks you know what marter is it's like clay you gotta patch it in between the cracks hold everything tight together you know what that is what that signifies let me give you another analogy here how many y'all like to eat two people it's two people like to eat okay let me tell you this maybe you'll understand this you are some smart kids so you got the best meat that you could find best potatoes you could find put it together in one bowl but you know what there's gaps in there so you need some gravy to fill in all the gaps and keep it all together you know what the gravy signifies the holy spirit you see if you don't got nothing to fill in the gaps your house gonna fall down you know what i'm rambling on too much i got some notes here because i'll be up here forever okay remind me there's another man that built the house his name was brother moses y'all know moses okay tell me about the bible you got one you got one you oh you got one two okay turn with me to the scripture exodus 25 verse nine everyone got who's got it ready you got okay your sweetheart yeah thank you thank you according to all that i show you that is the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all its furnishings just so you shall make it okay how about verse 40. verse 40. go ahead right there and look there that thou make them after the patterns which he showed thee in the mountain amen thank you brother sister you see brother moses he might have been a good builder but he was obedient to god when he's telling build it exactly according to the pattern that i show you know what another word for a pattern is a blueprint you don't got a blueprint you know what to build you know the measurements you know how to cut you see what happened i thought i knew what i was doing i'm in my house it was a little crooked and it fell down because i didn't do it according to blueprint and moses he was obedient he built it tabernacle exactly according to the pattern he saw i'm talking about the exact measurements i'm talking about the colors i'm talking about the skins exactly he didn't waver it was exactly here we go okay now i'm going to show you the blueprint today we're building the house here i'm building a house okay there's a blueprint go on put first picture there you go that is the pattern today is isn't it or not okay that is the body you know so you'll understand put the next one up there here that's what's called the body of the lord jesus christ now i know what y'all thinking we already learned this from the last person to talk here he taught us this we know this but you know what turn your bibles again let me tell you why i'm telling you again okay second peter 1 8. you got oh right there right there go ahead and read or if these eight angels for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor fruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ go ahead verse 9 but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see for afar off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins whether or for the rather bad brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fail if ye shall do these things you shall never fail you shall never fall you know what give me verse 11 here for soul and entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly in the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ next verse wherefore i will not be niggly okay you know what i'm talking about to put you always in the remembrance of these you know what i'm telling you so you can remember put you in the remembrance of these things though you know them you already know and you rehearse i'm reminding you and be established in the present truth next verse yeah i think it me as long as i am in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance so i got to remind you that's the body there go and put that picture again bro but when you decide to give your heart to the lord when you start your journey you you're gonna start climbing these steps but you know what happened you mess around you know what you're supposed to do you're gonna fall but if you have all these things you shall never fall i'm gonna read you another billy there are there any more billies here yeah they're built they're billy three billion perfection okay here we go okay what is the tabernacle today you know the answer i just reminded you we're gonna have to start all over what's about what's what's the tabernacle thing what's it called it's the body okay a body god tabernacling in a body now god isn't building a wall he's building a house you see there's many cuts and turns he's predicted here in the bible and the turns anybody could try to make a turn but it must be according to the blueprint if it isn't it's got to be torn down that means when you start your journey and you stray off and you fall and you talk to some of these older kids they went off the beaten path and they had to get torn down it ain't fun so you just stay on there so you don't fall down okay y'all hear me now you hear me okay i'm trying to think about my crowd daddy okay you see you know how important you are to the lord are you sure okay you know how important you are to the lord you understand how many your parents you older kids know how important these kitties are okay i'll give you a little testing how many of you called them a name when you was frustrated when you was angry mm-hmm okay okay don't don't put your hand on see if you from silver city you might have called him a child if you're from las cruces you might call them savage if you're hispanic you might call mucoso i'm gonna stop before i get in trouble anyways before these kitties are your children they are children of the king that means before you think about one of them names remember they belong to somebody they're owned by somebody you gotta think i can't talk to a son daughter or god like that cause i'm gonna get in trouble i'm gonna i'll move on i'm well okay anyway okay i'm gonna tell you something you know i can't even fathom it i can't even explain it to you i'm quote brother bill again he said this to god you are more you are more you mean more to him than 10 million worlds i got to put that i know you heard that before but i gotta remind you you are more you ain't getting it you can get you looking at me crosstalk you ain't getting it okay i'm gonna tell you about this world we live in okay there are 3.5 million miles of river in this world and that's only counting the main ones not the little creeks where i'm from on there are 117 million lakes in this world there are seven seas and five oceans well they're pretty much all connected so i guess that's just one ocean or one you know okay but all together they're telling up to 139 billion 434 million square miles of ocean and sea all together roughly one million different species of animals live in the oceans there is roughly 5.5 million square miles of desert in the world we live in you understanding now you're getting it i'll keep going now there are 1.8 million miles of forest in the world we live in there are roughly 2 million different species of animals that live on the earth there are over 3 trillion trees in the world you know how many that is that's that's too many i'm gonna break it down for you a little bit okay if every person own their own small forest it would equal to about 400 trees per person not in here that's whole world you know what i'm talking about okay list goes on that's just one world and out of the billions and trillions of things in this world times about time to buy 10 million i just read you one but you times that by 10 million out of the trillions of billions of things you mean more to god than 10 million of those worlds that i just named you you can't history you
