[37:35] the hardest years today
[37:37] Masaru we don't expect it to get easier
[37:39] no loss esperamos much faster but I will
[37:42] tell you this penicillin
[37:43] it was the most glorious year that I
[37:46] have ever been a part of a felony must
[37:47] law do so that wanna see the parity go
[37:49] through all the ups and the downs and
[37:52] the hardships Portola Sal Taveras boy
[37:55] refused did we see God's glory s even
[37:58] like Lauria the bringing souls like
[38:01] never before to the kingdom oh I'll
[38:03] muscle train no a seen a revival that I
[38:06] have never witnessed in my whole life
[38:08] yes don't even
[38:09] I tell you I am very thankful to the
[38:13] Lord for letting us be a part of his
[38:15] great plan as I said the porter party
[38:18] decigram plan what a what a revival that
[38:20] continues to go on carry you momento que
[38:23] continúa une and you know III as I was
[38:25] meditating yesterday with my message
[38:27] emitter scimitar you I hear the minions
[38:29] actually I said Lord how tremendous and
[38:34] it just remain reminding or remembering
[38:36] certain things your record and American
[38:39] Tascosa and something came to my mind
[38:41] yell go be Normandy it was a great year
[38:43] well gran but something came to my mind
[38:45] II know me man it was a saying that I
[38:47] had that I've said maybe some years back
[38:51] want is says if what we did yesterday
[38:54] Casey lokah samasta here still seems big
[38:57] today toy yes I mean a grand ahoy then
[38:59] we haven't done much today
[39:01] it doesn't know Messiah was Dante OE so
[39:04] what I'm getting at it is that we are
[39:06] looking for greater things until we
[39:10] reach the coming of the Lord that is our
[39:14] goal that is what we press towards amen
[39:17] he said mister damn it I said mister can
[39:19] read and that's what Paul would say
[39:20] forgetting those things which are behind
[39:23] so many here addressed want to forget
[39:26] those things that that may be things
[39:28] that that may be that that we're not so
[39:30] proud of last year what does keynote
[39:32] addresses Casa de las cuales time we
[39:34] work with yo so maybe some mistakes and
[39:35] failures that we've had a road as far as
[39:38] getting how many want to forget those
[39:39] things this morning but the ski area
[39:41] system how many want to bury those
[39:43] things let me die it's a day so it's
[39:46] forgetting those things which are behind
[39:47] and reaching forth unto those things

[57:52] or
[57:52] a person una persona Rica but never do
[57:55] you find in the in the in the bookstores
[57:57] no kind really the art of not thinking
[57:59] who think when Tom Lehrer PSLRA come on

[59:07] we simply need the mind of Christ to be
[59:11] present in our members me I don't
[59:14] believe and know that we can we can
[59:17] achieve you care it's a very big part of
[59:19] not thinking

[1:06:41] could God rest physically discuss or any
[1:06:44] God is a spirit but notice is pitiful
[1:06:47] this is was showing that even the

[1:07:41] the trees and the mountains to move when
[1:07:45] he was the the super and I know star
[1:07:48] would have come in contact with the
[1:07:49] natural people or nothing cause the
[1:07:52] supernatural event acaso event the sword

[1:23:19] another body or another being but what
[1:23:23] do we really are quite somos okay watch
[1:23:27] this now he says because they
[1:23:28] potentially here
[1:23:32] I guess what is it the word promise pin

[1:24:25] what that's why the new birth process is
[1:24:27] so important political process no they
[1:24:29] don't ask me because it's the process of

[1:43:23] where's your faith that's supposed to be
[1:43:24] controlling those senses you think it's
[1:43:26] so funny but realize it's a silver sense
[1:43:28] super you want to see the supernatural
[1:43:30] get awareness or a natural keep our
[1:43:32] mouths shut when we don't have nothing
[1:43:34] good to say when I ever kill if I've
[1:43:37] ever seen something supernatural yeah
[1:43:39] he's drunk assorted you wanna see the
[1:43:40] supernatural embarrass your mouth shut
[1:43:43] when you have nothing good to say but
[1:43:44] the one thing that no can see that is
[1:43:45] not natural because the natural is tell
[1:43:49] me and I'll tell you no no something
[1:43:53] supernatural I'll go start an actor that
[1:43:54] walk away what a legacy what kind of
[1:43:59] supernatural you're looking for all I
[1:44:00] want to see lie busca I wanna see all
[1:44:03] these really the pillar of fire is not
[1:44:09] God and P let the flavor know I know
[1:44:11] that but the feeling is though the
[1:44:13] pillar of fires not God and be letters
[1:44:15] equivalently light it's loose but what
[1:44:17] that pillar of fire is showing in a look
[1:44:20] at before
[1:44:21] the invisible God is present get this
[1:44:26] now
[1:44:26] nothing here's Mary walking icky
[1:44:29] somebody I come in under and brother
[1:44:31] Brown says walking maybe to the market
[1:44:34] in canto al America Tashi all of a sense

[1:44:38] her and says when she saw the light to
[1:44:42] seek a condo there nothing inside the
[1:44:44] light that is materialized so my opinion
[1:44:47] is that that light is not to come and
[1:44:50] say oh look it's so that you know I am
[1:44:51] God lose the pillar of fire come let's
[1:44:57] be letting the fovea because there's

[1:45:03] the light they said give me like I look
[1:45:04] and there's something materialized yeah
[1:45:06] go guess I mean all of a sudden out of

[1:45:38] gay there was that pillar of fire it'll
[1:45:41] be like the foil that had come on the
[1:45:42] scene and showed that something was
