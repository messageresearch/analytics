[21:50] amen amen you may be seated to each and
[21:53] every one of you and you look around
[21:55] maybe there's a there's an empty space
[21:59] just just remember that oh brother
[22:02] Freddy brother God's done a miracle in
[22:05] brother Freddy's
[22:08] life amen so every every place that you
[22:11] see that's empty there's an angel
[22:13] sitting there if you can believe
[22:17] that you like the Angel that's sitting
[22:20] right next to you all right all
[22:22] right and and and and you you say how do
[22:26] you know this
[22:28] the Bible says that the angels of God
[22:30] encamp around those that fear
[22:34] Him and so we understand that when the
[22:38] scripture tells
[22:40] us where wherever there's two or three
[22:43] congregated in my name there I am in the
[22:45] midst of
[22:48] them but but in all of this I believe
[22:50] our the subject of our of our of the
[22:53] young people's uh uh theme this year has
[22:56] been or or to this date or from here on
[23:03] in is of whom the world is was not
[23:07] worthy
[23:09] of and and uh you go into Hebrews the
[23:13] 11th
[23:14] chapter and you find out where the Hall
[23:17] of Fame is
[23:19] at you you you go into you can go into
[23:22] the Football Hall of
[23:24] Fame and you can go to the baseball or
[23:27] basketball Hall of
[23:32] Fame but this is our Hall of
[23:35] Fame this is this this is these are our
[23:40] heroes when when you look at at at what
[23:42] a hero
[23:44] is I pray everybody I get everybody's
[23:47] undivided
[23:49] attention when you find a
[23:52] hero you find someone that you look up
[23:56] to someone you want to
[24:00] emulate now I I I was was privileged by
[24:05] God to be able to go into the Town
[24:08] Council of the of Silver
[24:11] City city and and they gave my dad an
[24:14] award November 7th was was declared as
[24:18] thas peris senior
[24:26] day and the re the reason is because of
[24:30] all the work that he had done for
[24:36] humankind they asked they asked me the
[24:38] question or they asked me can you give a
[24:41] little bit of background about
[24:44] him and I simply said this I did not
[24:48] have to go outside of my home to find my
[24:53] heroes My Heroes lived inside my
[24:56] house who I wanted to be
[24:59] like I never wanted to be like any other
[25:02] any other person in the world but my
[25:06] papa never wanted to be like anybody in
[25:08] the world but like my brother and my
[25:14] Theo those are my
[25:16] heroes they live in my own
[25:19] house so when you find out the person
[25:23] that God has called you to
[25:26] be
[25:28] God has also called you to be a hero to
[25:32] somebody it's a hero of the
[25:34] faith you find out like brother Freddy
[25:37] believed so much that now his his he his
[25:40] foot is
[25:44] healed that's a hero of the
[25:47] faith those are the people that will
[25:49] believe God and take him at his
[25:54] word and take God and make the word of
[25:57] God come alive to them in their
[26:03] generation this last
[26:05] week I saw the power of God like I have
[26:08] never experienced it
[26:12] before now now I I've been a Christian
[26:14] since I
[26:17] remember and I've been in church since I
[26:21] remember but but God deals with us at
[26:24] different
[26:26] times and I won't I won't take very much
[26:29] of your time but that's why I want you
[26:31] to capture
[26:32] this God will deal to with you at
[26:35] certain times in where you're
[26:39] at and I saw the spirit of God on
[26:42] Wednesday in gy
[26:47] Colorado it was the Book of Ezekiel all
[26:50] over
[26:52] again when he saw that the presence of
[26:55] God in the pillar of Fire
[26:59] that was infolding in
[27:03] itself now I had I had seen the pillar
[27:06] of fire
[27:07] before I had seen the fire of God drop
[27:13] before but this was all the time that I
[27:16] found myself in the
[27:19] fire and when you find yourself in the
[27:23] presence of
[27:24] God he no longer becomes a historical
[27:27] figure to
[27:29] you you become part of the
[27:33] story because he is then your
[27:36] life that's why John
[27:40] 3:16 has enough power within
[27:45] itself to save the whole
[27:48] world it does it we we we we love all
[27:52] the other
[27:53] scriptures that was there's 800,000
[27:56] words in the Bible
[27:59] Bible and what great scriptures that
[28:01] there
[28:02] is but this
[28:05] scripture has enough
[28:08] power save the whole
[28:10] world if you will take it to
[28:14] yourself okay Abra
[28:18] AB God so loved
[28:25] who that he gave who
[28:29] that he gave Abraham his only begotten
[28:33] son that if Abraham believeth in
[28:37] him Abraham should not
[28:41] perish but have everlasting
[28:43] life or eternal life when you understand
[28:48] the purpose of what God has called you
[28:53] to now now it is a vast vast thing
[28:58] because the world engulfs us every
[29:00] single
[29:04] day you're coming into Halloween
[29:07] Halloween and Halloween Halloween is
[29:10] actually when the people really get
[29:12] going of who they really
[29:17] are I don't know about about about Las
[29:20] crues but Downtown Silver City on
[29:23] Halloween is the scariest place to be on
[29:26] the planet Silver City and
[29:30] Halloween they have this what is called
[29:32] this Zombie
[29:34] Walk and you don't even want to be
[29:36] caught
[29:38] there so you find out that the real
[29:41] person shows
[29:46] up professional people the whole year
[29:51] long and all Halloween comes around and
[29:54] they put on a
[29:56] mask
[29:58] and they put on the most grotesque
[30:00] things they can ever
[30:02] find God also used
[30:06] masks but the Simplicity of the word of
[30:09] God is
[30:10] this when he comes to live inside of
[30:15] you he changes mask from one to the
[30:20] other but it's not a Halloween
[30:24] mask and it becomes the face of God
[30:29] now we without with
[30:32] understanding when first John tells
[30:36] us first John tells us it ha not yet
[30:40] appeared what we shall
[30:43] be we know that when he shall
[30:47] appear we shall be like
[30:50] him Paul says this now we look through a
[30:54] glass
[30:56] Darkly but then face to
[31:00] face that's what I I I I loved about the
[31:03] message on on
[31:06] Wednesday is because the the the pastor
[31:09] spoke on the encounter or the visitation
[31:13] The pel
[31:18] Experience because that become a face
[31:21] to-face
[31:24] encounter have you ever saw yourself
[31:27] face to
[31:29] face have you ever saw yourself with God
[31:32] face to
[31:34] face have you ever talked to God face to
[31:38] face God so loved
[31:42] me how did he love you he must have
[31:46] known
[31:47] you the Bible talks about
[31:51] predestination it talks about for
[31:53] knowledge it talks about
[31:56] election talks about
[31:58] choosing and all of these
[32:01] words are found in
[32:04] God if we know what God
[32:07] is before there was a
[32:10] world he knew who you
[32:12] were knew who you were before he created
[32:17] the
[32:17] planets he had already elected
[32:21] you chosen you in him the Bible says
[32:26] before the found found of the
[32:28] world so when you come to the
[32:32] understanding God loves
[32:34] me why would God love
[32:37] me God loved me because I was a church
[32:41] member no no the Bible says when we were
[32:48] unlovable how do we understand
[32:51] that do we we think that we are
[32:54] sometimes the best people in the world
[32:59] and we we've never broken a
[33:01] plate and we've never done nothing
[33:05] wrong excuse me we were all born in
[33:10] sined in iniquity to this world speaking
[33:14] Li and unless there is a nature
[33:19] change and there's got to be a nature
[33:23] change young people we can sit in our
[33:27] Pew all day
[33:30] long and we can be here for the rest of
[33:32] our
[33:34] lives and we can sit in a
[33:37] Pew until that day of
[33:39] judgment when it says I don't know
[33:44] you or we can know what he has done for
[33:49] us I don't know about you but what he
[33:53] did on
[33:55] Calvary what he did on that
[33:58] what he did for me is more valuable than
[34:02] any
[34:05] drug it's more valuable than any any
[34:10] feeling it's more valuable to me than
[34:15] anything that the world has to offer you
[34:18] know why God loved
[34:21] me for God so loved the
[34:24] world that he gave me his only begotten
[34:29] son now now in it then you you you you
[34:34] come to the understanding what then do I
[34:36] have to do for
[34:39] him now the prophet of God gives us his
[34:43] story and he gives us his his his his
[34:47] history and he tells us
[34:49] this the morning when I was
[34:53] born he was standing with his they tell
[34:56] me with his hands in the bibs of his
[34:58] overalls he's talking about his
[35:02] dad and a little window on the side of
[35:04] the
[35:07] Hut after I was born a light came into
[35:10] that
[35:13] window settled down where I
[35:16] was it's been with me from that day to
[35:22] this now let me tell you when Christ
[35:26] comes to live inside of
[35:28] you he doesn't come to live inside of
[35:31] you to
[35:33] leave he actually comes to live inside
[35:36] of you to
[35:39] stay do you understand that when God
[35:42] chooses you he chooses to
[35:46] stay the problem is is that we don't
[35:49] choose him to
[35:51] stay and so we start trying to do
[35:54] something
[35:55] else that will fill the
[35:58] void now now on Sunday
[36:01] morning the the pastor is ISE is
[36:05] speaking and I saw a young
[36:08] man when the pastor gave the
[36:11] challenge who will be the face of this
[36:16] generation of this
[36:18] revival nobody called him nobody said
[36:22] come
[36:23] forward he himself in the middle of the
[36:26] service
[36:28] came very
[36:30] respectfully knelt
[36:32] down surrendered his life to the
[36:36] Lord like you had never seen
[36:39] anybody you know why
[36:41] somebody
[36:43] understood the purpose that they were
[36:46] set to Earth
[36:49] for now now now when the Bible says this
[36:51] in
[36:53] Hebrews whereby the children were were
[36:56] were made partakers of flesh and
[36:59] blood in other words before you became
[37:03] Flesh and
[37:05] Blood you were already a child
[37:10] of in other words we as
[37:13] children to on Flesh and Blood took on
[37:17] flesh and
[37:18] blood but we were already children
[37:22] before we took on flesh and
[37:25] blood this is the
[37:27] prophet I'm at
[37:30] home I'm among
[37:33] people I'm among young ladies that I
[37:35] went with in my young
[37:40] days I'm amongst boys
[37:43] here that I played boy boyfriends that I
[37:46] played
[37:48] together I ask you
[37:50] today if you've ever seen me
[37:54] smoke drink or be
[37:58] drunk or defile myself in that
[38:03] way no sir I did not not for my
[38:10] goodness but it's by his
[38:13] Mercy his for he he his foreordained
[38:17] will for me to do
[38:21] this for a while there was a there was a
[38:24] a big movement in the
[38:25] message
[38:27] and they and the movement was
[38:29] this you have to go out in the
[38:32] world to get a
[38:36] testimony and so you had to go do this
[38:39] and this and
[38:40] that and these people would don't go do
[38:43] this and this and
[38:45] that and then come back into
[38:48] church and say the Lord this is my
[38:52] testimony because I didn't have a
[38:54] testimony before
[38:57] well if they were caught in a
[39:00] trap and that happened to them well I I
[39:03] feel bad for
[39:05] them but how about this
[39:08] testimony God kept
[39:12] [Applause]
[39:13] me and especially young girls and young
[39:19] men when you wear your heart on your
[39:24] sleeve and say all this guy is so
[39:28] awesome this girl is so
[39:31] beautiful I think I'll give myself to
[39:35] them you can't get it
[39:39] back there are things you cannot get it
[39:43] back but how about staying
[39:47] here and waiting upon
[39:50] God
[39:52] until the word become the reality to you
[39:57] and gives you the desire of your
[40:00] heart that's a
[40:03] testimony the testimony is how God kept
[40:08] me your testimony is how God has kept
[40:12] you he is faithful in every
[40:18] generation
[40:20] now we we we I was born he says he say
[40:27] I believe that gifts and callings are
[40:29] without
[40:31] repentance how many Christians believe
[40:34] that it's not what you try to work
[40:37] yourself up
[40:40] to it's what you're born to
[40:45] be this is the
[40:47] prophet what were you born to
[40:52] do I was born to be a
[40:55] barber
[40:56] that's how you make
[40:58] money or whatever you do but what were
[41:00] you born to
[41:02] be I was born to be a Son of
[41:06] God I was born to be a
[41:10] preacher and I love to worship
[41:14] God I was born to go to the
[41:18] Nations I was born to rescue
[41:22] people the Bible when Isaiah tells us
[41:25] this the spirit of the Lord is upon
[41:29] you for what purpose to free the
[41:33] captives to find the
[41:41] Brokenhearted set those that are
[41:43] prisoners at
[41:46] Freedom what were you born
[41:50] for well you know my my dad he he works
[41:53] hard in the
[41:55] church and you then the scripture should
[41:59] should be should should read
[42:01] this God so loved my
[42:05] parents God so loved my
[42:09] grandpas God so loved my great
[42:13] grandpas and without the understanding
[42:16] of what he come to
[42:19] do you'll never get to the understanding
[42:21] that God so loved
[42:25] me who am
[42:27] I I am a
[42:30] person you are a
[42:32] person of whom the world is not worthy
[42:37] of you say how can that
[42:40] be by being here
[42:43] tonight you have become a hero of the
[42:47] faith while the people on the outside
[42:51] say will God have a
[42:53] church there are young people that that
[42:56] are are here that can stand to their
[42:59] feet and say I am the
[43:02] face I am the people of God I am a young
[43:06] person that God has chosen I was born in
[43:11] this
[43:12] generation to be the face of the
[43:20] Revival Deuteronomy 33 tells
[43:24] us there is is none like unto the god of
[43:31] Jesu who rideth upon the heaven in thy
[43:38] help and in his Excellency on the
[43:43] sky I wonder if tonight we can all
[43:47] together say there is no God like our
[43:51] God can you say that can you say that
[43:54] young people
[43:56] there's no God like my

[44:10] Gods but there are people that know who
[44:13] their God
[44:15] is there are people that have been
[44:17] adopted into the
[44:20] family there are people that the
[44:22] revelation of God has come to them

[44:32] Jes when you look on who is
[44:36] jeson it's used in the Tanaka or Hebrew
