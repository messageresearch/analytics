[35:59] words

[36:03] little bit
[36:07] in this chapter 18 of the book of
[36:09] revelation
[36:22] revelation 17.
[36:38] if you go back and read chapter 17 and
[36:40] then 18 you'll get a good context of
[36:42] what it's talking about
[36:48] for all nations have drunk of the wine
[36:50] of the wrath of her fornication and the
[36:52] kings of the earth have committed
[36:53] fornication with her
[36:55] and the merchants of the earth are waxed
[36:57] rich
[36:58] to the abundance of her delicacies
[37:14] now we're going to go to verse 8.
[37:18] therefore shall her plagues come in one
[37:21] day death morning and famine and she
[37:24] shall be utterly burned with fire
[37:26] for the strong is the lord who judges
[37:29] her

[37:47] and lament for her when they shall see
[37:50] the smoke of her bernie

[38:05] fear of her torment saying alas alas the
[38:09] great city babylon
[38:10] that mighty city for in one hour is your
[38:14] judgment come
[38:26] and the merchants of the earth shall
[38:28] weep and warn over her for no man buys
[38:31] their merchandise anymore
[38:43] now let's go to verse
[38:56] and it's good to see people with open
[38:58] bibles praise the lord jesus
[39:01] yes
[39:03] the merchants of these things which were
[39:05] made rich by her shall stand afar off
[39:08] for the fear of her torment weeping and
[39:10] waiting los mercaderes estas cosas
[39:20] and staying alas alas the great city
[39:24] that was clothed in fine linen
[39:26] and purple and scarlet and decked with

[39:42] for one hour so great riches is come to
[39:46] nothing and every shipmaster and all the
[39:49] company in ships

[40:12] burning saying what city is like

[48:30] foreign
[48:33] [Music]
[48:34] we all know what the bill of rights is
[48:35] right
[48:41] and in 1971
[48:43] it was adopted and put into effect
[48:47] you know and and
[48:49] one of the things one i want to speak
[48:51] about this evening
[48:53] we're talking about the amendments
[48:59] and and the one i'm going to be speaking
[49:01] about is the first amendment
[49:05] and under this first amendment
[49:08] we have freedom of speech
[49:13] the
[49:14] expression
[49:15] freedom of press
[49:18] freedom of religion
[49:20] the right to assemble
[49:24] and the right to petition
[49:29] you know if we could say for if it
[49:30] wasn't for these great men we wouldn't
[49:32] have these amendments
[49:37] the first amendment it guarantees the
[49:39] freedom of speech
[49:41] [Music]
[49:46] it gives americans the right to express
[49:48] themselves without worrying about the
[49:49] government
[49:53] it is the most basic component of free
[49:55] speech
[50:02] this is the freedom
[50:03] this freedom is similar to freedom of
[50:05] speech
[50:09] in that it allows people to express
[50:11] themselves
[50:14] through a provocation
[50:17] and then the first amendment is
[50:19] guaranteeing the freedom of
[50:24] religion it prohibits the government
[50:28] prohibits the government from
[50:29] establishing a state religion
[50:35] and from forming one and one favoring
[50:37] one religion over the other
[50:41] religion
[50:43] and then
[50:44] the first amendment protects the freedom
[50:46] to peacefully assemble
[50:57] with a group of people for social
[50:59] economical political or religious
[51:01] purposes
[51:04] [Music]
[51:07] so so our founding fathers that that is
[51:10] the rights we have today the rights you
[51:11] have
[51:13] right now at this very moment
[51:16] to be here sit it together congregated
[51:20] it is because of these these men
[51:25] the reason why
[51:26] we can broadcast on youtube
[51:32] youtube which would be classified under
[51:34] the freedom of oppress
[51:38] is because of these these great men
[51:40] especially
[51:42] i don't know about you all
[51:44] but i love to come to church
[51:48] i love to hear the word of god
[51:50] i love to hear the messages that brother
[51:52] branham brought i mean
[51:55] i'd love to read them
[51:57] you know but this was all made possible
[52:00] because of
[52:01] men that were that were inspired of god
[52:03] to to create these first amendments
[52:10] hey man i don't know if you can everyone
[52:12] can join with me today to give a round
[52:14] of applause for these men that that
[52:16] allowed us to
[52:19] [Applause]
[52:42] and this bright age is going on at the
[52:44] same time that this lady ocean church
[52:46] age is going on
[52:50] and ladies
[52:51] how many remember what lady ocean means
[52:53] [Music]
[52:56] means justice for the people significant
[53:01] it also means rights of the people
[53:05] it also means
[53:08] now now as i was looking this up and i
[53:10] was breaking down the word of ladies
[53:16] [Music]
[53:26] and i'm probably not going to say this
[53:27] right he said no you guys still correct
[53:29] them but i believe it's dicey is it
[53:32] dicey did you spell it d-i-k-e
[53:35] d-kis
[53:38] something like that i don't know how to
[53:39] say it to be honest with you
[53:42] so who now that now that word there now
[53:45] that was that came from uh from a greek
[53:48] goddess
[53:50] is
[54:07] now the first one was was her name was
[54:09] famous
[54:13] which meant which and there it means
[54:15] divine law
[54:18] divine law means divine significance
[54:21] and uh and famous
[54:24] now you might not think this is
[54:25] important right now but give it a few
[54:27] minutes and this is going to be pretty
[54:28] important
[54:32] now
[54:33] witnessed
[54:34] the birth of apollo
[54:38] witness the birth of apollo
[54:45] now her persona
[54:48] is a
[54:49] person is a blindfolded woman
[54:56] with a sword in one hand and a pair of
[54:58] balances in the other
[55:00] espares
[55:02] so when you go look at it says all uh um
[55:05] they're wretched poor blind
[55:12] and ladies because they're looking at
[55:14] the spirit of the spirit of god was
[55:16] looking to that this goddess
[55:18] that the spirit was going to be upon the
[55:20] people in this time
[55:29] the spirit of this goddess
[56:00] [Music]
[56:10] and it is said that she has little to no
[56:12] idea what's going on
[56:26] but the spirit of this goddess what does
[56:28] it cause among the population of the
[56:31] world
[56:36] it causes the worship of the creation
[56:40] more than of the creator cause
[56:55] it brings back the spirit of the ancient
[56:58] empire of rome
[57:03] romano
[57:04] where they would actually worship
[57:06] naked women in the time
[57:32] everything that our sisters have to
[57:33] confront every day of their life
[57:48] so be aware of that
[57:51] all the ideologies that you can
[58:01] they're getting you to worship the
[58:03] creation more than the creators
[58:20] you know so so ladies you see it's
[58:23] moral decay
[58:27] it's people that are are conforming to
[58:29] this age
[58:33] because everybody wants their rights
[58:37] and that and that's why i gave a little
[58:39] bit of the background first of of these
[58:41] great men
[58:44] because we were born with these rights
[58:56] and the people with very little
[58:57] understanding as as this goddess
[59:02] has you know we the the people don't
[59:05] realize or or they are since they're
[59:08] conforming to this age
[59:11] to this day into the spirit
[59:15] they don't they don't realize that they
[59:17] have the rights already
[59:20] so what do we see that's what's going on
[59:24] i remember brother caleb about a couple
[59:25] of years ago our pastor
[59:29] was kind of talking about something
[59:30] similar to this and he says
[59:34] he says
[59:36] they don't they the only way that they
[59:38] can have more rights
[59:42] as if they take yours away
[59:45] and it's not that they're giving them
[59:46] rights
[59:48] it's they're taking yours away
[59:52] you know we see we see nowadays and how
[59:54] in its political standpoint
[59:57] is
[1:00:14] so many different things that are going
[1:00:15] on in the world right now
[1:00:18] and it's all because of this day and age
[1:00:20] and the spirit that we're living in
[1:00:21] right now
[1:00:25] amen can i get an amen to that
[1:00:28] you know you know these these
[1:00:29] politicians jesus politicos you know you
[1:00:31] know whether it be the radical left
[1:00:34] radical whether it be the radical right
[1:00:38] they're all there's always a double
[1:00:40] standard siempre
[1:00:53] they're over here saying the very thing
[1:00:56] is
[1:00:58] and then the left is saying in certain
[1:00:59] terms
[1:01:01] they're saying certain words
[1:01:04] and then the right is saying you can't
[1:01:05] say them
[1:01:08] very
[1:01:35] the unity of the one god in the one
[1:01:38] church
[1:01:43] i want to ask you a question
[1:01:46] what are the three main political
[1:01:48] parties
[1:01:49] worldwide
[1:02:03] and if you could put the definition of
[1:02:04] those up there real quick
[1:02:11] communism a system in which goods are
[1:02:14] owned and common
[1:02:17] and are available to
[1:02:37] now
[1:02:39] is communism a creation or a communism
[1:02:43] you want to answer that for me
[1:03:00] communism
[1:03:02] as we'll read here
[1:03:05] in the unity of one god in the one
[1:03:07] church paragraph 39.
[1:03:12] did you think that
[1:03:14] in this russia they have a false
[1:03:17] pentecost
[1:03:23] they are
[1:03:24] that's the work of the devil
[1:03:29] they try to force all men into communism
[1:03:32] intention for saratov
[1:03:36] where every man has everything
[1:03:38] commonly
[1:03:42] do you know that was the condition of
[1:03:44] the church under the holy spirit
[1:03:49] holy spirit
[1:03:51] on the day of pentecost in the other
[1:03:53] pentagons that the people sold their
[1:03:55] possessions and laid them at the feet of
[1:03:57] the disciples
[1:04:03] and they distribute them to every man as
[1:04:06] they need it
[1:04:11] and now the devil has come around and
[1:04:13] got into the world and made a political
[1:04:16] power to force man to to that yeah
[1:04:21] entrance
[1:04:26] god does not force man to do anything
[1:04:32] you do it in your own free will
[1:04:36] he can warn you
[1:04:53] his presence in supressencia to make him
[1:04:55] your savior
[1:04:58] but satan
[1:05:00] has perverted god's plan up everything
[1:05:03] to his own son
[1:05:06] did you ever think of catholicism
[1:05:10] and the catholic church is trying to
[1:05:12] make every person a catholic like this
[1:05:16] it won't work
[1:05:19] it's under a man-made program
[1:05:23] did you ever think of the protestant
[1:05:25] church under the federation of churches
[1:05:32] another word for this world council of
[1:05:34] churches
[1:05:37] it is trying to force all these little
[1:05:39] churches out
[1:05:42] iglesias and it will happen
[1:05:45] that you will not be able to go to
[1:05:46] church
[1:05:49] unless you belong to the union of
[1:05:51] churches
[1:05:55] then little places like this will
[1:05:56] certainly pay for it
[1:06:01] but we got a scripture that says
[1:06:05] they're not little flocks
[1:06:09] it's your father's good will to give you
[1:06:11] the kingdom
[1:06:15] before turn it back over yeah did you
[1:06:18] notice though
[1:06:20] the political condition the condition
[1:06:22] political has been caused by
[1:06:25] this fallen church
[1:06:30] russia why did it turn communists
[1:06:34] we could read the quote but i don't want
[1:06:36] to take the time
[1:06:39] he says because of the filthiness
[1:06:41] and low downness of the catholic church
[1:07:10] so the direct relation between the
[1:07:12] condition of the churches
[1:07:14] [Music]
[1:07:17] is what determines what spirit is going
[1:07:19] to arrange in the political realm
[1:07:24] i don't know but you can get a hold of
[1:07:25] that no no
[1:07:41] oh you know by the way i i take my ties
[1:07:43] in often this is my church
[1:07:45] your friend
[1:07:47] is it your church
[1:07:50] don't don't don't misinterpret that nami
[1:07:53] this is our church
[1:07:55] how many can say this is our church
[1:07:58] the condition of our church the
[1:08:00] conditions
[1:08:01] will determine whether a spirit of
[1:08:04] politics can get among us to try to
[1:08:07] divide us
[1:08:16] and the spirit of god in the spirit of
[1:08:18] will never
[1:08:21] be divided nunca ceremos
[1:09:04] then all these messages that we hear
[1:09:08] they can't go online
[1:09:11] this right here is a direct attack
[1:09:14] from satan on the church
[1:09:18] and the crazy thing is that this is even
[1:09:19] a new spirit
[1:09:22] tremendous question
[1:09:24] around for a long time
[1:09:27] what
[1:09:27] was one of the four things that that uh
[1:09:29] adam lost
[1:09:37] he lost the power of the spoken word
[1:09:42] oh so this spirit of cancer culture
[1:09:49] [Music]
[1:09:58] you know but uh let's see here
[1:10:00] time's going really fast
[1:10:04] so so
[1:10:05] so
[1:10:06] since this is it's under attack
[1:10:10] and that's the natural political yes
[1:10:14] what about the spiritual spiritual
[1:10:17] right because there's two vines that
[1:10:18] grow together right
[1:10:22] we heard about the political the
[1:10:24] political powers that came up right
[1:10:28] but there's two powers in the world
[1:10:31] which is which is god insane
[1:10:35] so so this spirit or is this spiritual
[1:10:39] it tried to silence jesus
[1:10:42] jesus they try to silence the apostles
[1:10:47] all the martyrs throughout all these
[1:10:48] ages
[1:10:52] i was talking to my wife the other day
[1:10:55] and i was telling her like
[1:10:56] what brutal things that these people had
[1:10:59] to go through for the gospel
[1:11:05] i recommend you read the fox book of
[1:11:07] martyrs
[1:11:16] you know they even did it to brother
[1:11:17] branham where he was in germany and they
[1:11:18] wanted to kill him
[1:11:22] oh then they got to and they tried to
[1:11:23] silence the voice
[1:11:29] but
[1:11:30] this this is here's is is
[1:11:33] where i think it says it starts to get
[1:11:34] good for me bro jim i'll go for it

[1:11:45] yes but then
[1:11:47] silence the voice if we can say it that
[1:11:48] way
[1:11:52] and then
[1:12:20] by silencing
[1:12:22] a voice
[1:12:24] well it's it's good to go and play a

[1:18:08] soul-drifting
[1:18:11] voice of many waters
[1:18:13] what is this boy it's a judgment
[1:18:16] the bias of the ministers
[1:18:19] through the holy spirit that's crying
[1:18:22] out to the people in every age standing
[1:18:24] there the voice of many waters
[1:18:28] cry out sickness and molotov the voice
[1:18:31] of those seven stars in his hands every
[1:18:34] church age preaching the baptism the
[1:18:36] holy ghost the baptism in jesus name

[1:18:48] man
[1:18:49] that's where i want to be
[1:18:51] and that's where i want to make my
[1:18:52] opposing statement
[1:18:56] how could
[1:18:58] these this fightful ministry brother
[1:19:00] jimmy
[1:19:01] minister queen to play how can it have
[1:19:03] failed
[1:19:06] when it came forth from one like unto
[1:19:08] the son of man
[1:19:14] if that voice failed
[1:19:16] if the fightful ministry failed
[1:19:20] then the voice of the prophet failed
[1:19:23] because that fightful ministry
[1:19:26] ministry
[1:19:27] was produced by the one like unto the
[1:19:29] son of man
[1:19:35] amen god bless you amen
[1:19:37] praise the lord how many are happy
[1:19:40] [Applause]
[1:19:44] we're not going to have time to really
[1:19:45] go into politics
[1:20:02] of what's happening on earth
[1:20:07] and right now yeah
[1:20:10] in our nation
[1:20:14] the confederation of churches the
[1:20:16] confederacy iglesias is rising
[1:20:21] to fight communists

[1:20:28] we used to think of that all communism
[1:20:30] over there
[1:20:32] yeah but our nation has been eat out
[1:20:36] with socialism and communism
[1:20:41] socialism
[1:20:43] a system
[1:20:45] of society or
[1:20:46] group living
[1:20:50] group
[1:20:54] in which there is no private property
[1:20:58] everything is owned and controlled by
[1:21:00] the state today
[1:21:04] the means of production is controlled by
[1:21:07] the states
[1:21:10] that's the fight we have in washington
[1:21:12] right now is in washington hour with
[1:21:15] this new agenda
[1:21:17] and right in our own government
[1:21:21] many have sold out to socialism and
[1:21:23] communism
[1:21:26] in our own
[1:21:54] on the on the computer so they can read
[1:21:56] it really quick first corinthians 14 33
[1:22:03] for god is not the author of confusion
[1:22:06] but of peace as in all the churches of
[1:22:08] the saints
[1:22:11] i had a couple of others here but i'm
[1:22:12] going to i'm going to skip here just to
[1:22:13] get to the gist of it here
[1:22:17] so so we see all this right left
[1:22:19] politics
[1:22:33] and all it is really is just a big ball
[1:22:35] of confusion yes
[1:22:37] john 16 13 says pero
[1:22:40] juan this is
[1:22:42] put up on the computer so they could
[1:22:43] read it
[1:22:44] how be it when he
[1:22:46] the spirit of truth is come
[1:22:49] he will guide you into all truth for he
[1:22:52] shall not speak of himself but whosoever
[1:22:55] he shall hear
[1:22:56] that shall he speak
[1:22:58] and he will show you things to come
[1:23:03] hello
[1:23:18] you know the two powers there's either
[1:23:20] god or satan
[1:23:23] and brother branham says what it is
[1:23:25] today
[1:23:29] it's it's really a modern day tower of
[1:23:30] babel is what it is
[1:23:47] the other side says contrary and it's
[1:23:49] disinformation to the other side
[1:23:54] so it's confusion to the people
[1:23:58] there's confusion in the churches
[1:23:59] confusion
[1:24:06] nobody knows what to turn and what is
[1:24:08] truth anymore
[1:24:11] so it's a modern day tower of babel
[1:24:14] modern
[1:24:17] and i'll have to rush a little bit here
[1:24:19] that's okay
[1:24:22] no i'm going to have to rush a little
[1:24:23] bit
[1:24:25] um so let's go to uh jesus christ's name
[1:24:28] yesterday today and forever first quote
[1:24:32] and
[1:24:33] we believe that we're living in that
[1:24:35] type of day now
[1:24:38] when sputniks are in the skies
[1:24:42] and the modern day
[1:24:54] we believe that jesus is coming soon
[1:24:59] everybody it's later than you think
[1:25:01] right yes
[1:25:03] but i want to go back to a little bit of
[1:25:05] the past as well
[1:25:08] so those that know obviously that have
[1:25:10] lived in the united states
[1:25:13] and to those you know the newcomers i
[1:25:15] want to you know be able to explain what
[1:25:16] happened here
[1:25:19] but it's due on may john f kennedy
[1:25:23] john f kennedy a very charismatic man
[1:25:26] very loved of the people
[1:25:29] and it says that the the crooked
[1:25:31] machines during that time are the ones
[1:25:32] that elected him
[1:25:35] the crooked machine
[1:25:37] las machina striker
[1:25:45] so very very a very famous man
[1:25:49] but in in 1961
[1:25:53] so he started what's called a race to
[1:25:55] the moon
[1:25:58] the united states and the russians were
[1:26:00] battling to see who could get to the
[1:26:02] moon first
[1:26:06] so he even made a declaration
[1:26:10] that we needed to put more effort into
[1:26:12] into beating the russians to the moon
[1:26:17] so we know that he never saw that in his
[1:26:20] administration because of the
[1:26:21] assassination
[1:26:23] administration
[1:26:25] but the efforts paid off in 1969
[1:26:33] in the mission that they called apollo
[1:26:49] apollo we heard brother ronnie speak on
[1:26:50] that a little bit
[1:26:53] but it so it was
[1:26:55] there was a total of 11 space flights um
[1:26:59] excuse me let me let me go back here now
[1:27:01] to get ahead of myself
[1:27:04] the the apollo was the nasa program that
[1:27:06] resulted in apollo um
[1:27:10] i'm making a total of 11 space flights
[1:27:12] and walking on the moon
[1:27:14] [Music]
[1:27:17] but there were six of them
[1:27:20] six of the seven flights
[1:27:24] and keep those details in uh and uh keep
[1:27:26] those details with you okay
[1:27:29] there were six of the seven flights
[1:27:39] and those flights it took place between
[1:27:41] 1969 and 1972 okay tomorrow enter
[1:27:59] and i can't help but but look at
[1:28:02] history repeating itself again
[1:28:06] let me explain
[1:28:08] we have we had a catholic administration
[1:28:10] back then in john f kennedy
[1:28:15] we have another catholic administration
[1:28:17] under joe biden
[1:28:19] administration
[1:28:21] during that time was an uh the civil
[1:28:23] rights movement
[1:28:26] a
[1:28:40] uh
[1:28:50] and so they say that they're working but
[1:28:52] we see space flight today
[1:28:57] elon musk sending a bunch of people to
[1:28:59] space all over
[1:29:00] miramasa elon musk
[1:29:03] but there's one coming in 2025 that
[1:29:05] caught my attention
[1:29:08] attention
[1:29:20] it was in time because the peace of the
[1:29:22] second administration paralleling the
[1:29:24] first wasn't set yet
[1:29:32] so so we see the first mission was
[1:29:33] apollo the second one will be called
[1:29:36] it'll be under the mission called
[1:29:37] artemis
[1:29:42] artemis iii they call it
[1:29:46] which artemis iii was the goddess that
[1:29:48] was worshipped in in the in the uh the
[1:29:50] church age of ephesus
[1:29:57] artemis was the twin to apollo artemis
[1:30:03] so who was this apollo queen era
[1:30:05] so we see that there's a lot of greek
[1:30:07] mythology that was mixed in back then
[1:30:14] apollo was the greek god
[1:30:17] he was god of the sun dios del sol and
[1:30:20] light is a loose
[1:30:22] he looked good
[1:30:25] they said he was they called him the
[1:30:26] averter of evil
[1:30:30] he was an olympic god
[1:30:33] and he loved music and poetry
[1:30:38] he was known for healing and plagues
[1:30:42] healing and plagues
[1:30:46] prophecy and knowledge
[1:30:49] order and beauty order
[1:30:51] and he was an archer
[1:30:57] so so when i when i saw him i started to
[1:30:59] see him and you and you'll see why in a
[1:31:01] little bit
[1:31:05] i hope i can get to it
[1:31:08] but so he was an archer and he was a gun
[1:31:12] and and so he says so you look at the
[1:31:15] the four horsemen of revelation right
[1:31:18] uh
[1:31:19] caballos and apocalypses you see the
[1:31:21] first horse rider how was he el
[1:31:23] primerginette
[1:31:25] he looked harmless
[1:31:34] he had a bonus and he was an archer as
[1:31:36] well
[1:31:39] so keep that in mind okay so
[1:31:41] apollo
[1:31:52] if you guys want to study it
[1:31:57] remember the four horsemen of revelation
[1:32:00] apocalypse how many writers were there
[1:32:02] brothers
[1:32:06] nobody else
[1:32:07] what if i tell you was the same writer
[1:32:09] all the way through
[1:32:21] many griefs seem to have supposed that
[1:32:23] apollo stands for destroyer
[1:32:39] assembler see how it looks good
[1:32:42] see how he starts off good
[1:32:45] but he was known as a destroyer
[1:32:49] he held what's called the delphic tripod
[1:33:10] but watch the characteristics of apollo
[1:33:12] characteristics
[1:33:14] remember
[1:33:15] i'm getting to all this to get to a
[1:33:16] point
[1:33:18] there was a race to the moon um
[1:33:47] so we see here so there was a purpose of
[1:33:50] why he wanted to get there first
[1:33:54] apollo is concerned with the health and
[1:33:56] education of children
[1:34:02] watch this
[1:34:13] the long hair which is a prerogative or
[1:34:15] an entitlement or right
[1:34:20] of the boys was cut off
[1:34:22] the the el nino era cortado
[1:34:25] at a certain age and dedicated to apollo
[1:34:30] apollo so so we see it creeping into
[1:34:33] into into society today
[1:34:38] remember that it's a system
[1:34:40] we look at the catholic church brother
[1:34:42] branham said i'm not against the people
[1:34:58] you see rome has tainted and has her
[1:35:01] hand in everything
[1:35:04] so so he go you go you see with the
[1:35:06] children what are they doing in the in
[1:35:08] the schools today
[1:35:11] they're creeping into the schools
[1:35:15] and teaching four-year-olds
[1:35:19] they're teaching them about sex and how
[1:35:20] to choose gender so
[1:35:24] so apollo had he was concerned with the
[1:35:27] teaching to the children
[1:35:34] he was a some writer he connects the
[1:35:36] name apollo
[1:35:39] apollo with with
[1:36:08] in which case apollo would be the the
[1:36:11] god of flocks and herds
[1:36:15] now we see okay don't don't think about
[1:36:18] about the sheepfold that flocks of
[1:36:20] animals
[1:36:23] because today
[1:36:24] the flocks of people or the masses
[1:36:29] are influenced by the narrative that's
[1:36:30] being pushed out today
[1:36:39] keep in mind the system okay
[1:36:41] in all this keep in mind the system
[1:36:43] behind it all right
[1:36:46] so so the
[1:36:47] so
[1:36:48] let me let me read this here before i
[1:36:51] watch this here
[1:36:54] and one and one of the um
[1:36:57] um
[1:36:59] the quotes here i have a brother branham
[1:37:01] i don't know if you guys have it uh
[1:37:02] exposition of the seven church ages
[1:37:15] which was joined with with the emperor
[1:37:18] worship cult
[1:37:46] means of atonement
[1:37:48] making amends wrongdoing
[1:37:54] plato said of him
[1:37:57] he explains to men the institution of
[1:38:00] temples
[1:38:05] sacrifices and services to deities
[1:38:07] sacrificials
[1:38:10] besides the rights connected with death
[1:38:12] and the afterlife
[1:38:21] he says which offered the people that
[1:38:23] are living
[1:38:26] unless they belong to the temple worship
[1:38:28] of apollo almenos
[1:38:33] anyone who refused to join
[1:38:35] in the idolatrous feasts
[1:38:42] orgies
[1:38:45] was barred from these first century
[1:38:46] unions
[1:38:49] [Music]
[1:38:51] in order to be part of the social and
[1:38:53] commercial life
[1:38:55] [Music]
[1:38:57] one had to be a practicing pagan
[1:38:59] idolater
[1:39:05] so we see like i said keep in mind the
[1:39:06] system okay
[1:39:09] in all this what what was the rush to
[1:39:12] the moon i better just hit these points
[1:39:13] here because
[1:39:17] so so the whole point of getting to the
[1:39:19] moon if we know the types
[1:39:23] under the catholic administration
[1:39:25] [Music]
[1:39:29] anybody know what brother branham calls
[1:39:31] apollo
[1:39:33] apollo he actually speaks of him
[1:39:36] we just read it
[1:39:37] and he calls him the modern modern-day
[1:39:39] pope
[1:39:42] that just blew me away the pope who is
[1:39:45] literally apollo and modern version
[1:39:50] has taught the people to join themselves
[1:39:52] to idols
[1:39:56] the roman church has become a false
[1:39:57] prophetess
[1:40:02] to the people because she has taken away
[1:40:04] the word of the lord
[1:40:06] from the people
[1:40:09] but you see don't just leave it in
[1:40:10] catholicism
[1:40:13] ronnie just finished talking about them
[1:40:14] silencing the voice
[1:40:18] you ever wonder why brother branham says
[1:40:19] one man can be a denomination
[1:40:28] [Music]
[1:41:03] if i can find my my notes i think i got
[1:41:05] them all mixed up
[1:41:11] but you see him in revelations 9 11.
[1:41:16] why does all this matter
[1:41:18] is important because it i was going to
[1:41:21] say it shows something that's coming no
[1:41:23] estradiol
[1:41:24] it shows what's already here
[1:41:27] it shows the system behind it all
[1:41:30] systems influence behind what's of the
[1:41:31] it moisture
[1:41:34] satanic power
[1:41:35] influence
[1:41:36] in politics
[1:41:38] in the schools
[1:41:40] in the churches
[1:41:42] and in the individual individual because
[1:41:44] if we notice see not that the gentile
[1:41:46] dispensation started how the
[1:41:48] dispensation
[1:41:50] holy man worship of a holy man
[1:41:53] what if i tell you it's gonna end up the
[1:41:55] same way
[1:41:58] if you look at nebuchadnezzar's
[1:42:53] the only destroyer i see
[1:42:56] you was that king of the bottomless pit
[1:43:03] his name was apollyon
[1:43:06] which in the manuscripts
[1:43:09] apollo and napoleon were the same person
[1:43:13] it was because he came from doctrines
[1:43:16] without foundation
[1:43:19] which was the bottomless pit
[1:43:22] because that's what doctrines that are
[1:43:23] false
[1:43:26] they are doctrines without foundation
[1:43:28] fundamentals so that's why that's why
[1:43:30] brother branham calls him a modern-day
[1:43:32] pope
[1:43:36] so like i said so we have to be very
[1:43:37] careful
[1:43:40] that we don't we're not set up like that
[1:43:45] as the system
[1:43:47] like i said i'm talking down to the
[1:43:48] individual level now
[1:43:51] individual it's an individual affair
[1:43:54] individual but so so in finishing here
[1:43:57] we're going to just finish here so that
[1:43:59] so so we're going back to the moon
[1:44:01] estamos
[1:44:03] in 2025.
[1:44:36] in the religious or political realm
[1:44:39] in a reno political what you're seeing
[1:44:41] right now
[1:44:43] so
[1:44:44] in 2025
[1:45:03] so
[1:45:04] you'll see
[1:45:06] she's the goddess of the moon
[1:45:09] and she's also the hunter
[1:45:11] so brother branham says now
[1:45:14] brother
[1:45:15] brother brown says when the pope visited
[1:45:17] jerusalem he typed it at her as a church
[1:45:25] he
[1:45:26] he said that moon completely blacked out
[1:45:32] and he says and he's coming here too he
[1:45:34] says
[1:45:37] so when this takes hold i mean it's here
[1:45:39] already
[1:45:42] we see those demons those locusts and
[1:45:44] revelations uh uh verse three i believe
[1:45:47] revelation nine three pneumonia
[1:45:50] and apocalypse
[1:45:51] you see these demons right that will
[1:45:52] come and torment the people
[1:45:56] this is like locusts
[1:45:58] what just so happens at apollo's press
[1:46:03] was a locust
[1:46:06] one of them one of his quests was the
[1:46:08] locust
[1:46:10] so that the only thing i can see
[1:46:14] is it it ends with the worship of a holy
[1:46:16] holy man
[1:46:20] and in the 70 weeks of daniel you guys
[1:46:21] were able to get that drawing
[1:46:24] daniel
[1:46:29] so you see the you see that image there
[1:46:31] right that
[1:46:32] nebuchadnezzar's dream on the bottom
[1:46:33] right there
[1:46:38] the top right hand corner
[1:46:40] looks like a catcher for a perfect man
[1:46:42] to meet there right
[1:46:45] the only escape that we have
[1:46:48] this is is when that when we reach that
[1:46:51] stature
[1:46:57] that stone in your life now okay bring
[1:46:59] it down to you to your life
[1:47:03] when sane is sealed out god is
[1:47:22] so that's the only escape that i see
[1:47:26] we got to stay in the word
[1:47:29] young people you've got to learn the
[1:47:30] word
[1:47:32] learn the message
[1:48:01] believe that's enough for one night
[1:48:04] but i would like to finish with this
[1:48:06] quote out of the message
[1:48:08] jezebel religion
[1:48:14] paragraph 124.
[1:48:30] lord if they're
[1:48:42] of these worldly systems are dying
[1:49:11] and the jezebel system will smother it
[1:49:14] out
[1:49:20] what they want to have
[1:49:25] live by the hidden spring like elijah
[1:49:28] vivir
[1:49:30] escondido
[1:49:32] served through the time of famine
[1:49:37] and god give them the holy ghost now
[1:49:40] dios
[1:49:53] and hereafter forever
[1:50:06] young people openness what you confront
[1:50:08] every day when you go to school you go
[1:50:10] to work
[1:50:12] you say i believe the word i believe the
[1:50:15] message
[1:50:17] everything around you
[1:50:20] is trying to smother out the voice of
[1:50:23] the bridegroom
[1:50:28] it's not out there somewhere no yeah as
[1:50:30] we stand your feet
[1:50:32] it's right with us
[1:50:35] it's not something that's going to
[1:50:37] happen
[1:50:39] it's something that's already happening
[1:50:43] you do not focus your life totally in
[1:50:45] christ
[1:50:48] every day of your life
