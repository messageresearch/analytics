Agha no Nelson your Dennis and OJ and Bali's one of the cleat they said it's one of the cleanest places in Uganda I think I'm but listen Allah cities must limp use an organ de that's what they said is look at easy and then of course like I said this would be a little different but this is Mount Elgon over here it said montale gone it's uh it's one of the tallest points in uh in in Uganda it's and it's a Montano's muscle to say in Uganda we're staying right at the base of that it's almost as a Titus it's too soon Agumon Oh Tito this is two odd things I I was more worried about getting a suit coat than anything else just on Westbrook well you're going to that the thing at the Kings the the jacket on come on yeah that picture of probably the last time you see me with a suit cool here's brother titus ok Stefan Oh Tito and they this is called a formal man's dress this is a moon with normal people just wanted to wear one of those things you could you know we were all kind of laughing about it a little bit though you know it's a men's dress it's a steal butter but we laughed about it a little bit amongst ourselves to see the reaction of the Kings and the Prime Minister's this is

garment don't they start to esteem it you don't have the right qualifications the note in LA because increments it throw this man out you know second Estelle Marie but so I got to see that now I think brother Tito for relating that it wasn't understanding in the real form to see to actually see it he and earlier though the Vettel and the four kings and these prime ministers recognized that registers those ministers principle it's like what's the plan brother Titus is called as a plan Amano the man with the plan it was that was that was just amazing so if you want to just hit play again
