========================================

now i want to read also in the book of saint matthew's gospel the 11th chapter of saint matthew 26 and 27 at that time jesus answered and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto thee even so father for so it seems good in thy sight catch those two scriptures who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed then jesus thanked god that he had hid the mysteries from the wise and prudent and would reveal it to babes such as would learn or it seemed good to god to do that now from this text from this scripture reading i draw this text god hiding himself in simplicity then revealing himself in the same it is strange to think how that god does such a thing as that god will hide himself and something so simple that'll cause the wise to miss it a million miles and then turn right back around in that some simple thing in the simplicity of his way of working and reveal himself right out again and as i have made the old statement many times that man still remains man man is always giving god praise for what he did do and always looking forward to what he will do and ignoring what he's doing they fail to see what a simple thing he used to do it with [Music] and then they look forward and see a great thing coming that's going to happen and nine times out of ten it's already happening right around them it's so simple that they don't know one day a man upgrade utica and he claimed that there was no such a thing as god and i understood that by this the man was gloriously converted to christ at the age of about 85 years old he asked a little girl one day who was coming from sunday school why did she waste your time on doing such a thing is that she said because she believed that there was a god and mr darcy said that he said child you are so wrong to believe in such a thing as that and said that the little girl stooped down and picked up uh a little flower out of the off of the ground pulled it from its pedal and said mr darcy could you tell me how this lives there it was when he began to search back he could have said to the child what's growing in the earth and then the questions could revolve back where the earth come from how'd that seed get there what happened on and on and run it on back until he's seen see not the great glamorous things that we think about but it's the simple things that god is so real the simplicity so it pleases god to reveal himself and then hide himself then hide himself and reveal himself in simple little things it's it's put over the top of the head of man because if you say why would a just god do that is because that man was made up in the beginning not to try to shift for himself a man was made to rely completely upon god that's reason we're lacking into land or sheep a sheep cannot lead himself he has to have a leader and the holy spirit's supposed to lead us so man is made that way and god made all of his works so simple that the simple could understand it and god makes himself simple with the simple in order to be understood by the sample we stumble over simplicity god is so simple until the scholars of these days and all days miss him a million miles but listen to the simplicity of god and then you find god now you're in the simple ways and i'm not here to contradict school and education and try to support illiteracy i'm not here for that but what it is the people as soul play so much upon that until they're even in the seminaries and so forth they're missing the very thing that god has put before them now today we preach philosophy we preach creed and denominationalism and so many things and leaving off the word because they say it can't be understood it can be understood he promised to do it now we're asking him to do it now we're going to take a few characters here for a few minutes let's notice in the days of noah god seen worldly wisdom so greatly punctuated and respected he sent a simple message by a simple person to show them his grace found an illiterate maybe farmer by the name of noah a sheepherder and the simple message of of building an ark constructing a something to get into that there's no water to float it why he become a fanatic and he become a oddball now then again in moses day notice another time of deliverance when god is just about to do something to deliver his people god sends a message to the people and it's so simple as we'll catch the break into these seals that's my purpose of bringing this first that we find out that the breaking of those seals is so simple the the smartness of a million miles i hope that god annoys me far see it just goes over the top mastery i thought this message this morning would be appropriate to lay a foundation on the simplicity of god how god hides himself in simplicity now notice moses in the day a god was going to deliver the children of israel according to his word he what did he do he chose a simple family we have no record of him see just the son of levi is all we know and so uh we um and his wife just the ordinary uh probably a mud dogger as a world thing out there making brick for the enemy he's just an ordinary slave in israel but god chose that family to bring forth the deliverer just an ordinary jewish family he never went and got royalty and celebrity or something or even got some priest he took a common ordinary family now he always works in simplicity but god in the beginning that could have made the son preach the gospel or the winds preach the gospel or an angel preached the gospel but he our dane man for that purpose and he never changes if we could take a a look at cain and abel how did the team try to please god by some beauty another way people think by a great fine dress congregation by a priest but with ministers with woven robe choirs and all the the put on that pleases god can you see where it come from cain tried the same thing and he built him an altar no doubt that he made it pretty and the man was sincere he worshiped he thought as long as i'm sincere it doesn't make any difference it doesn't make a difference you can be sincerely wrong but able by revelation by faith offered unto god about an excellent sacrifice nothing clean about it as far as it looks humanly speaking but it pleased god to reveal his secret to abel by simple faith in the shed blood notice elijah's day god chose to hide himself in a simple person now just think of it can you grasp it god hiding in a illiterate and elijah humbled himself and stayed with what god said in such a way that it pleased god to take that same spirit from elijah and promise to shove it three times down the road amen and he did it amen sure he did sure he promised him that it would come and it come up on elijah his successor that come on john the baptist according to malachi 4 sports be here again in the last days [Music] god loved that spirit that was up on that simple uneducated foot from back there in the woods somewhere and so it was so obedient to his word that he could say elijah do this and elijah would do it and god hit himself and there's such simplicity of god in simplicity amen he does the same thing the way up is down always humble yourselves don't never say well i got this and that you ain't got nothing just remember if you got the grace of god just be thankful for it but when he came on the scene in such simplicity [Music] they missed it they missed him loud would banks will be sitting down there and know that god a vindicated truth when a little old dead men of fish laying on the water and the holy spirit spoke the day before he is going to show him his glory and do something about it and there that morning standing in the holy spirit come down in that boat and raised up and spoke to that fish that laying on the water dead for a half hour his gills and intros pulled out of its mouth that come to life and swam away as good as any other fish what is it god hiding himself in simplicity are you ready the rapture will be the same way amen it'll be so simple no doubt to be likewise till the rapture will come one of these days and nobody will know nothing about it now don't don't get up now but study just a minute i'm sure enough clothing the rapture will come in such a simple way until the judgments will fall and they'll see the son of man and say wasn't we supposed to have such and such and was there supposed to be a lie sent to us and was there supposed to be a rapture jesus will say it's already happened and you didn't know him [Music] in simplicity it'll be a secret because he said he come like a thief in the night he's already told us this the rapture then judgments will strike sin plague sickness and everything and people cry for death to take them for the judgment lord why is this judgment upon us when you set it there be a rapture first is it it's already kind and you didn't know it god hiding itself in simplicity all right all that's already happening why don't believers believe the simple signs of his coming where's our faith to believe the simple word of god guess what god said taking that his word god hides himself now in simplicity in a humble little bunch but one of these days oh lord he'll manifest himself as he always has the day's tax time do you love me you
