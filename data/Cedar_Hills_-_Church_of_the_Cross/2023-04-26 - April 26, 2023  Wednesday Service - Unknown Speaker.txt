responsibility armed and dangerous oh just open your heart I feel the Lord in this place just open up your heart to the Lord and let us sing this song and we'll welcome him amen [Laughter] [Music] oh

[Music] [Music] oh boy [Music] me and my own way is [Music] thank you foreign [Music] his position to position and responsibility irresponsibility with a subtitles armed and dangerous armado armed and dangerous in the Book of Genesis people of the Genesis for we just read we see a picture here how God made Man In His Image and you notice that God gave man Dominion over all the creation that God made he made man to have dominion is lost Dominion God said to them to be fruitful and multiply and have dominions it's a it's a but because of the Fall we understand when I when I see and read the newspapers and I see all the people and how the children are just doing bad and the parents have no control over them the nation has no control over them because the nation the world suffers from parent delinquency I hate to see parents there that say something to their children and for example they say if you do that again I'm going to spank you yeah and kids when they grow up the child says you hit me and I'll hit you back parents don't even have dominion over their own householders but to attain the position we must have responsibility and having this responsibility what's a great load upon us we are not made by God to just have different children but to bring them up in the admonition of the lord we must understand our rights and our privileges if we don't then the enemy will rob us of them I like to consider a few scriptures and if you would open your Bibles to the Book of Psalms and Psalms 8 Salmo Ocho we wonder sometimes who man is and we know that no matter how strong a man is in life by the age of 60 the Bible says he begins to fall away and some that are very strong make it to the age of 80. very few make it to 90 or say even a hundred and over a hundred they can be counted but the times that we live in you know they are very dangerous times a very hard times and as a minister I feel I have a responsibility to try to help people foreign and he said thou art mindful of him I don't know what that scripture does to you but it it filled me that I want to I want to cry with gratitude when I cry I don't cry because of Sorrow no Euro I have a joy in me it's like brother Jody was singing and we were singing thy loving kindness can you imagine that God is mindful of men and also the son of man is he paid this son of man a visit and then he said thou has made him a little lower than the Angels a little in other words he made him a little lower than God how many of you truthfully thinking put your thinking there used to be a teacher you used to say put on your thinking apps can really say God has crowned me with Glory and Honor I can raise my hands and I can say your brothers here that God has crowned me with glory and honor and when I think of that and I think that he was mindful of me I have no no words I had no sufficient words to describe what I feel okay I I want to get a picture for you and I don't want to put the card before the horse but I wanna I wanna just take it slowly and and bring out a picture for you on man and his responsibility and positions and I gotta tell you that this man that has honor and glory is armed and dangerous in in the Book of Genesis again chapter 3 we find a very sad picture here verse 24. cuatro he drove out the men I'm gonna paraphrase that of the Garden of Eden and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life he plays cherubim there we know that but but what What a Sad picture to see God's representative a man that he had crowned with glory and honored Gloria be driven out now that's a sad picture to me the saddest thing in the world for me would be not to lose a mother or father nope not to lose my children not even to lose my wife but to find out in that day that I cannot go in foreign no wonder the Bible says Heaven and Earth flesh from them okay now we as people Gente we ask God a lot of things if you don't know God the Bible says him that loveth not knoweth not God because God is love okay so then if we don't know God much less will we know our privileges we will never have the position of responsibility it is not just coming to church and trying to be a Christian piano many many people try that it's to know him and to know him and know what he has given us we we sometimes see people having a repeat uh repetition of a a prayer you know they they repeat prayer and then you find other people that are always asking God for the same thing and then you find other people that say well God didn't give it to me he gave it to them but he didn't give it to me and I say well who in the world put all those thoughts in your mind now in our minds we try to think like people in the world but we cannot if we are Christians we are not of this world our thinking is not like any ordinary man we are armed and dangerous now the world thinks they have the Armament yeah this lesson that I have gets better as it and I didn't misuse English when I say gooder I like to say that I know I know properly you would say it gets better but I'm gonna say it gets cuter yeah in the book of the Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 12. that at that time you were without Christo when you find the word Christ it simply means the anointed one now let me rephrase some say don't turn to but let me rephrase it for you who is and the son of man whom thou visited we were without Christ we were away from god let's finish reading being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants a promise without God in the world that is pretty sad when you don't have God you don't have God because you go to church in other words you come to worship Him in spirit and in truth when you have him you come into church to seek help so that you can also worship him because he only accepts one kind of worship it's got to be spirit in other words armed and dangerous right without God in your how how terrible I don't know have you ever been in a hospital I have been in hospitals where men are dying the most pitiful side is to see people dying they don't have Christ in their heart Hombres I saw a man he was real big I went I went to to the hospital I walked into his room he was dying when I went in he was sitting on on the bed and he was going ahiba he didn't have Christ in him outside the nurse went inside she came out two minutes later he was dead without crying this woman was dying one day she had told the prophets give your religion to the cows two days later she was dying she could only remember one name bring me brother Branham bring me the man whom God visited now she knew them that she needed that Christ but when the man reached the hospital what a terrible condition in the Book of James you don't have to turn to it chapter 4 and verse 7 says resist the devil Diablo this is Santiago now a lot of a lot of people have a hard time resisting him to resist him you you gotta know him and you gotta know God and then you gotta know who you are you cannot resist him if you aren't armed when you are armed the devil says I ain't going near him he's dangerous he can put the demons out because he's got the armaments but if he knows that you don't know oh he'll make hamburger out of him there was a collared player some of you older people remember him Satchel Paige the most sexual page he said one day only he said how can a man know how old he is if he doesn't know how old he is except for a minute I scratch my head repeat it again how can a man know how old he is if he doesn't know how you know it doesn't make sense but it does now the word of God you'll see how this saying of such a page here um the Bible says meditate whatsoever things are pure and lovely just meditate on them we find people in control don't have a chance to meditate you know why too much television television their their minds are constantly being entertained by television you give me a television set and this is what I'll do with it I'll get this thing and I got changing channels they say we'll leave it in one is now the heavens soap operas adulteries fornications and then the cartoons are worse oh my kids don't watch nothing but cartoons there some of them are XXX rated and then the kids are all oh you you say something to them they go yeah but when can you find a man sitting down by himself not thank you for bad things I wonder if I'm gonna make it I wonder what I'm gonna do today I don't know the Bible says you don't meditate on that it says whatsoever things are pure well that don't put us whatsoever things are lovely meditate on those things he said foreign I know my experience you begin to meditate because you haven't Spirit of it is depression yeah and 20 percent are psychosomatic [Music] um mental problems problem problemas I don't know you're going to do something wrong and you didn't count counsel with the Lord you're all stressed out yes and then you say Pastor pray for me yeah I'm gonna pray that you'll be obedient am I going to pray that that be taken away from me because he's going to come back on you because you've never learned your position you don't have your position you don't have you don't have responsibility responsibility so you are not armed and you are not dangerous Devils you say the Devils he says foreign because you said this claim something that you don't have positions then you wonder why you're gonna you got problems you don't know how to resist the Devils try to resist him by yourself in second Corinthians I don't have a spicy message like you heard last Sunday mine is strictly doctrinal and Mio is second Corinthians five it says therefore the mode okay If any man be in Christ what is he was without Christ without hope sounds [Applause] cries in other words he already has received the Covenant of Promise yes let's see what he says he is a new creature is can everybody repeat with me he is ah you creature he's a new creature or is that false where's false his new creature old things old things he's still doing those things that you did before you claim to be this all things you don't have positions you don't have responsibility you're not armed you're not dangerous it says oh things are passed away all I become new yes he's a new race he's a super Breeze Jesus and it wasn't so much what we gave up no I look at the hummus but it's what we received that's what we take on hey Ruth Ruth in the Bible was in a land that was suffering with famine actually Israel was suffering with a famine that's how Naomi went into the land of Mohamed well when Ruth came back with Naomi she only took on boaz's riches and the poverty went away she didn't give up her loneliness she only took on the companionship you understand so then when we are in Christ it's not so much that we leave this one automatically makes all and everything everything comes to do it's a better breed of people it's a great species that's right now I want you to think for a minute because I want you to defeat the Devil but you're not going to defend him by saying I know who you are no no because let me tell you he knows who you are yes too and he knows what you like he knows more about you than you think everybody goes to church there's a bunch of church girls that are going to hell going to church don't make it I don't come to church to be saved come because I'm saved is that what I did what he did for foreign you're still with me Jesus was so he triumphs so much Jesus that is spoiled he spoiled principalities principals and powers and he made a show of them openly I mean second chapter of Colossians 2 15 color senses he Triumph in over themes if the devil Diablo knows that we don't know what belongs to us is he can have us by the neck because he knows that you don't know how old you are who you are if a man doesn't know how old he is he doesn't know how old he is yeah if the devil knows listen you're sick you feel bad you got stress if he knows I'm a Christian I I'm by myself and I do this and God knows that I'm a Christian yeah God knows what you are yeah and the problem is that you also know but you want to be a pamparone but if the devil knows that you have been translated from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of God you become a threat to him because he knows your arms a Christian is harmed you think a Christian is an armed you take me the best in this church I hear some people here are bullet karate they're Tapas I can knock you down before you can even raise your hands I'll have you in a hospital bed before you know what's going on all I gotta do is speak one word [Applause] amen but we don't do that because our Warfare is not for them but if you're a good karate fighter someday you'll be late in the hospital in hospital and you're gonna want a man that's armed and dangerous to be at your side because you might have learned karate but you never learn about Christ position and responsibility under a New Covenant now in I'm not gonna read it and I don't turn to it just mark it down but when you go home I want you to read psalms 105. and you'll notice David writing this Psalm how he describes what God did with his people the Bible says there was not a people one amongst them he may made water come out of a rock he made Nations fear when they came they were armed and dangerous he made a harlot is because she knew they were armed and dangerous she he made he brought him a man to guide them and this man was armed and dangerous to hit the people [Laughter] he could speak and the devil knows it now a lot of times when you pray um you you pray to God for the same thing all the time what if God has already done that you're asking him for something he has already done it's not up to God no depends but the Bible says submit yourselves to God first the fear of God you cannot resist him until you submit adios that's when you become armed and dangerous now Jesus Jesus is here estaki let's put him 2000 years there was a storm the starting change because Jesus was there the storm was still on Jesus was there the storm was on yeah but Jesus Jesus he had to speak a word let there be light he says wins arms and when the winds heard that certain sounds it never changed the complexion of things because Jesus was there but it changed the atmosphere and everything else you can be sick until Jesus speaks the word Jesus every demon has to back up I don't care if cancer is there you go see a woman again would you stand up again Miracle the demons had a hold of her it's not cancer it's demons misances but somebody came along that was harmed and dangerous terrible get away from my wife answers amen and I want you to know that you got to know them I hate to see people with me there are a bunch of cry babies crying over spilled milk because every day they spill their milk I don't know what I'm going to do I don't know what to do brother Betis pause or your foolish things that you do yeah I don't know why the devil always I know change yeah not just because you come to church the way you live when somebody slaps you here you want the Armament of God you want the Armament of God patience long suffering all these things to help you I don't know why things are going bad because you are bad it's very easy Adam if you are a new creature all the old things you have left you know this is ABCs always believe Christ when people say something bad about us what is the first thing that we do try to find something bad about them to talk about them amen amen you know who gets you in more trouble than anybody else I want to do this to all of you but I'm not doing it as you think you know how much the tongue of a cow cost at the market it used to be when we were growing up they had a slaughterhouse the heads the kidneys all these things that people don't like didn't like didn't like they will throw it away so we ate tongue and kidneys and livers my hair I gotta get a haircut every other week I don't need glasses to see comments while I put another one in the pan to cook it for you amen amen the devil likes to get you down you gotta know him you gotta know how old is yeah you know how old the devil is Diablo in this earth he's got over six million years James said it is the smallest because but you can put a reins on horses and muscle the the ox and all this and keep them from and just shut them up just turn up for me try to do that to him shut up no Michael I will not shut up I told you to shut up make me hug me Vieja Loca crazy woman crazy man you are worse than I am yes one is worse than the other one but if they don't repent both are going to hell you did it to me you're gonna pay for it that's our attitude don't tell me that's the attitude of everybody that does not have the new species you know what gets people into trouble again amen ES can you put rings on your tongue yes see but it's tied to the heart if the heart has a connection to this tongue connection you will speak only when Christ tells you to speak and when Christ tells you to shut up keep your mouth shut oh no please the Bible says he opened not his mouth he was before the shearers but he opened not his mouth the only time he opened it was when the Covenant was taking hold cuando El pacto and he said one of his last words for they know not what they do as in all right we need the word to teach us how to talk I will Ascend Yahweh Ascend there or I will descend there to the level of my mouth nobody thinks much about me in church is that you have descended well they think this is about this man is if I confessions I'm not picking on nobody if I confess I can't no puedo I can't no puedo that's what you call that's what you call pessimista there's a saying they says pessimists can because they all have the always have the can in the way why can I get healed yes are you tired already I Don't Preach to feel you full of emotion sometimes maybe I get a little bit but if I ask the question why can I get healed well why don't you reverse it you go to the altar oh Sanam Heal Me Lord he can't heal you and it says by his stripes you are healed well if you get sick you say bye he Stripes i Thomas Perez am healed and then you say well I still feel it it's not what you feel do they then you can't receive it and plus there will be a blockage amen why can't I receive the Holy Ghost you have answered it in the process of asking because you can't because you can't believe it that is for you prophet of God says if you believe that it is for you then you will know what results it brings comes to you if you cannot receive it and you are answering it's not the guy won't give it to you that's that your unbelief will not let you receive the Holy Ghost you're waiting for God to do something no you go to his word that's the only thing you got right now is his word no man has seen God at any time but he visited the son of man because he was mindful of him now he wants that seed in you to grow he don't want you to just well praise the Lord I got baptized in the name of Jesus Christ man it seems like since I got baptized things are worse yeah because the devil got a little closer to you to try to keep you from attaining your kingly [Music] this realm down here [Music] Satan controls this room and he has come down to do great destruction here yes God wants you to ascend yes but the trouble is you gotta pass right through that territory and if you're a Christian the enemy then the battle is over here until the battle has been fought I'm gonna get armed I'm Gonna Get Dangerous a level of speech bye now buy a letter that Jacobs you said you're going to Israel does not belong to him it is a squatter is cannot relinquish no territory to him he'll kill us on he can't kill the body that is dead I'll say that again cannot kill the body that is dead where the he can't kill that man that is dead that man that came out of the garden that was thrown out of the garden the nature had been changed now he put on now this man puts on Christ he dies to the world he's dead body and form and creates he's laying there let the devil kill it Jesus says fear not him that can kill the bodies that can kill both bodies and you go foreign I'm waiting for God to do it are you waiting for God to do what tell us God ain't gonna do nothing listen what more do you want him to do he sent his son to die on the cross gave up his blood nailed to a tree for you and for me he sent back the Holy Ghost he sent a prophet to restore us what do you want him to do he's not
