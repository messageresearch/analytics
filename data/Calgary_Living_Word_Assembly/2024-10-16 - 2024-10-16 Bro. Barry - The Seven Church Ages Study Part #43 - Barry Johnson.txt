maybe just make it known unto the Lord by way of an uplift hand as we go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for this day we thank you for your goodness and your many Tender Mercies to each and every one of us Lord as we've heard spoken already tonight father we have so much to be thankful for Lord you have made a way for all of the provisions of our lives and father more than anything you've made a way for us to have the provision that we need for our lives and for our families Lord father we can have food and and and rment and shelter but Lord Jesus there's no greater

ever want to take it for granted what you do for us every day father we pray that you would just be glorified in all that's said and done tonight thank you Lord Jesus for the tremendous healing and

Christ's name we pray amen amen thank you musicians once again forg giving of yourselves and the gifts that you have for the art for the wonderful special it's tremendous amen if you have your Bibles tonight I'd like to continue on in our study of the exposition of the seven Church ages Revelations chapter 2 push a little further into the thot tyan age and maybe even finish it but we'll see of Revelations chap 2: 18 and unto the angel of the church in thota write these things saith the Son of God who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass I Know Thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first notwithstanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols and I gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not behold I will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her in to Great Tribulation except they repent of their deeds and I will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the Reigns and hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your works but unto you I say and unto the rest in thota as many as have not this Doctrine and which have not known the depths of Satan as they speak I will put upon you none other burden but that which ye have already hold fast till I come and he that overcometh and keepeth my Works unto the end to him will I give power over the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a Potter shall they be broken to Shivers even as I received of my father and I will give him the morning star he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches let's just pray one more time Heavenly Father Lord tonight I pray that we could just hold fast to that word that you have given to us in this age Lord we know that we're not running a Sprint father it's a marathon and the prize goes to those who finish and Lord Jesus I pray that every one of us Lord would just be able to to leave this building encouraged tonight father that we would sense you father in person tonight Lord that it wouldn't just be an ordinary service we just want to commit each life and each family into your hands For Your Glory now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated just a couple of announcements before we go too far we have the Youth Event coming up on the 20th it's hard to believe that we're actually just over the halfway mark in October pretty soon we'll be seeing snow and uh winter time in November but hopefully not until then we have the Youth Event the 20th of October it's going to be at uh brother Joel and sister Crystal's house with brother Jerry Fox from end time message Tabernacle he is not a minister but he is definitely a brother who knows a thing or two about life through his experiences and he just loves the Lord more than anything and he's going to bring of his wisdom and try and impart some of it to those who come and I'm certainly thankful that brother Joel and Sister Crystal have opened it up to whoever is interested to come because there will definitely be nuggets of information uh that our brother will be able to share with us um on the 27th of October we're going to have brother ciz atuan take a service here before he departs to Toronto so uh are you happy tonight it's a wonderful time of year I'm just uh relishing in the change of the leaves it's such a beautiful time um it can be a little bit of a difficult time for some changing of of times and uh we know the time change kicks in soon um but it just is what it is it's where we live t tonight we're going to pick up from where we left off last time in the thoan church age in the uh subheading of space to repent and it's out of Revelations uh chapter 2: 21 and it says I gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not brother Bram he says here do you know that this church was actually more wicked than Ahab that's pretty wicked isn't it Ahab was was a pretty wicked fell he uh he did some things that really upset the Lord do you know that he repented for a while and walked softly before God you can't say that of the Roman Catholic Church no sir she has never repented but has stubbornly destroyed any and all who tried to help her repent that is history now God kept Rising up not only the messengers to each age but he raised up some wonderful helpers for those Messengers and gave every age some wonderful men of God and they did everything they could to bring the church back to God God certainly gave her an opportunity to repent did she ever repent and show that she did buy her fruits and see this is such a a beautiful thing because we can can say that we repent all we want we can talk and talk and talk but what are the fruits of our life did she did she ever repent and show that she did by her fruits no sir she never has and she never will she's drunk she has lost her senses in spiritual things I think it's just uh a pretty neat study if you look at First Kings chapter 21 I'm not going to turn there tonight but but the story of Ahab and how he wanted to get this uh Vineyard that naboth owned and it was his Birthright to have that Vineyard so he's actually trying to steal someone's Birthright which is spiritually Wicked but he told the story to his wife and his wife just said why don't you just do away with him what's wrong with you you're the king you can just do what you want to do so she went and she had him actually murdered and then gave the land of Vineyard to her husband the woman who's in control hey and we know brother bam talks about it how Ahab was the head but she was the neck that turned the head she was the one in control but the point I want to get to is Ahab who was so wicked got got got the Lord God Almighty so upset that he said you know what I'm going to wipe him off the face of the Earth the dogs are going to lick the blood of Ahab and his wife wife and his wife is going to be eaten by the dogs just a terrible terrible story when when he was boastful when the prophet came to him with the word of God and and he said oh do I see my my enemy do I see my enemy here and he said you know you see the word of the Lord that's what's coming to you buddy and uh the prophet told him this is what God he's done with you he's finished with you you are a menace and now you're going to get it and uh he departed and what happened was Ahab actually walked Softly As what the word says He put on sackcloth and Ash he knew there was a God in Israel and he knew that he was in the transgression and God even said to the prophet you know what I won't bring judgment on the house of ahab's family until he passes away I'll give him that space But once he's gone then my wrath will be Unleashed on the children of Israel because of his sin a space to repent isn't it a wonderful God that we serve isn't he so wonderful we've got so many things to be thankful for but I think that's one thing that's just amazing we could thank him forever that he gives us a space to repent my unfortunately the Believers they don't desire to do wicked not like Ahab I'm not trying to draw a parallel with the believer with Ahab I'm just saying that the the the contrast here is that Ahab was a bad bad guy and the Church of Rome is worse that's amazing to think about now God kept raising up not only the messengers to each age but he raised up some wonderful helpers for those Messengers he gave every age some wonderful men of God and they did everything they could to bring the church back to God God certainly gave her opportunity to help and help to repent did she ever repent and show that she did by her fruits no sir she never has and she never will she's drunk she has lost her senses in spiritual things now don't be confused and start thinking that the Church of Rome has repented of her Slaughter of the Saints because she is attempting to unite with the Protestants by making her Creeds to line up with the Protestant Creeds not once has she ever apologized and said she was wrong for her mass murders and she won't either and no matter how mellow and sweet she appears at this particular time did you ever see how the pope looks these days he looks pretty mellow and really sweet doesn't he if you haven't seen him take a look at the way he speaks in his demeanor he fits this to a te mellow and sweet she appears at this particular time she will rise up yet to kill for murder lies in her evil and unrepentant heart now just for the record I'm not throwing off on the pope I'm saying it is the anointing behind the pope it's the spirit that dwells in that Pope and he doesn't even know it the sentence against the harlet past it's out of Revelations 2:22 to 23 behold I will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation except they repent of their deeds and I will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the Reigns and hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your Works what this woman has children and she a if that is the case that she had children by whoredoms then she must be burnt with fire as the word has said and we know that's Old Testament law right that's what he's saying there Old Testament law said that she should be burnt with fire her end is the Lake of Fire but stop and think about these children for a moment a woman is the one out of whom the children come it is evident that this woman had children that came out of her but they did the same thing she did show me one church that ever came out of organization that didn't go right back into it there isn't one not one the lutherans came out and then organized right back and today they are a hand and a glove with this ecumenical move the methodists came out and they organized right back the Pentecostals came out and they organized right back there is going to be another coming out and praise God they won't organize back because they know the truth that group will be the Bride of the last day that's why I think it's so beautiful the Bride of the last day won't organize won't try and usurp the author uity of man into the church won't want to play politics and medal in the word they will just keep God first now it's said here that this had children now what were they they were daughters for they were churches just like her now here is a very interesting point Jezreel and Ahab had a daughter that daughter married jehoram the son of josephat and in 2 Kings 8:18 it says that jehoram walked in the ways of his father-in-law my he went right into idolatry by this marriage he brought God-fearing and God worshipping Judah into idolatry that's exactly what these daughter churches have done even as I have pointed out to you they start in the truth and marry into organization and leave the word for tradition Creeds Etc now let me get this across in Hebrews it says obey them which have rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God Hebrews 13:7 it is the word that rules us not men it is the word that rules us not men now a man has as a husband is the head of the woman he rules her but the church is a woman too and her ruler is the word Jesus is the word if she rejects the word and takes any other headship she is an adulteress I say Lord help us help us to get the Holy Ghost In Our Lives help us to get the token in our lives because that's the only thing that's going to prevent us from taking another headship and I want to just be super clear about it if we refuse to go all the way to the true baptism of the Holy Ghost then we accept another headship that's the way it works there's no middle ground there's no saying well I'm just not ready yet brother Barry you know there comes a point in time of accountability where we have got to make that stand in our lives any other headship you become an adulteress brother bam talks about that in the invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ he simply says you've got to die out to yourself every single Speck of the old man's got to go and so long as that happens you can go on to Christ now you name me one church that hasn't given up the word for traditions and Creeds this is tough isn't it they are all adulteresses like mother like daughter what will be the punishment of the Harlot and her children well it's going to be twofold first he said I will cast her into a bed according to the last part of verse 22 it will be a bed of tribulation or the Great Tribulation that is exactly what Jesus said in Matthew 25 1-13 there were 10 virgins five were wise five were foolish all virgins though the five wise had oil the Holy Spirit but the other five did not and when the cry went up behold the bridegroom cometh the five f foolish had to run seeking oil while the five wise virgins went into the marriage the five that remained outside were left to the Great Tribulation that is what will happen to all who do not go up in the Rapture that is what will come upon the Harlot and her daughters but I think we can just rest assured because if we do get the Holy Ghost In Our Lives there's no tribulation tribulation that we endure here is worthy of that Resurrection morning the the little things that we have to go through here are nothing to be compared to what we will see when that date changes secondly it says that he will kill them with death or as a literal translation says let them be put to death with death this is a strange saying we might say let a man be put to death by hanging or by electrocution or some other way but this says let them be put to death by death death itself is the cause of their death and we know that brother Bram is talking about eternal separation in this flesh we die and then go into the grave not accepting the Lord Jesus Christ then we come to judgment stand before the white throne and if you're not found written in that book then you're cast alive into the Lake of Fire that place that was created for the devil and his Angels not for human beings hell was not created for human beings the Lake of Fire wasn't created for human beings but that's Eternal separation now I want you to see this clearly so I will take out our illustration again of the daughter of Jezebel marrying into the house of Judah and thereby bringing it right into idolatry and causing God to deliver Judah to death this is what balum did too so here was Jezebel with her Peg pism over there is Judah properly worshiping God and living under the word so Jezebel marries her daughter to jehoram the minute that happens jehoram causes the people to become idolators and you know brothers and sisters it's the same thing today don't think for a second not one second that we can actually marry someone who doesn't have the Holy Ghost and think that it's actually going to work out cuz it ain't going to work out outside of a extraordinary miracle from God it ain't going to work out what will happen is we will become idolators ourself brother bradam calls it hell on Earth the minute that marriage took place Judah was dead spiritual death came in the minute the First Church of Rome organized it died the minute that the Lutheran organized death came in and they died the Pentecostals came Al along last and they organized the spirit left though they don't believe it but he did that marriage brought death then the light of Oneness of the godhead came they organized and they died too then after the fire of God fell on the Ohio River in 1933 a healing Revival swept the world but but it never came through any organization God went outside the Pentecostal groups outside of organization and what he is going to do in the future is going to be outside of organization too why it's just amazing to look at it because the common ground for those people that are on the outside is that someone is trying to do something different right if you were a Pentecostal or if you were a Baptist or a presbyterian everyone could say well you're a any costal a Baptist or a presbyterian and you know they're normal we you know we we know how to deal with those people we know what they believe but when you come along with a word from God a thus sayith the Lord you're outside of all of them the one thing they can do is band together and say that they're just trying to start something new but when you can identify it in the word it's unmistakable God can't work through the dead he says he can only work through the living members those living members are outside of Babylon no Organization no affiliation every single church is Sovereign under the headship of the Holy Ghost so you see death or organization came and the church died or to make it plainer death became a resident wherein shortly before only life reigned as in the original Eve brought death to mankind so now organization has brought death for organization is the product of the double corruptors Oh my he goes back to this I've got this highlighted here and I'm going to talk about it for just a minute here the double corruptors do we remember what they are you're probably reading it already nianis and bism the leadership of man over man Conquering the Ley niik is to conquer and Ley is the leoty the church the leadership trying to conquer the men and bmismart intervened taking her quickly to himself so that she was saved but when this satanic religion has gone full course of the ages you can just hear him preaching the trail of the serpent here can't you this satanic religion from the Garden of Eden all the way through has gone the full course of the ages there will be no one to intervene and she will be burned with her Seducer for the and her children and and the Antichrist and Satan will all find their places in the Lake of Fire right here I will be getting ahead of myself and maybe I ought to reserve this for the message on the last age but it seems just right to put it in now because it deals so clearly and so clearly with organization and what's going to happen through it and I want to warn you and I just love that we're getting a warning this is the Holy Ghost speaking through him and now he he says Revelations 13 1-18 and I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and 10 horns and upon his horns 10 crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy and the Beast which I saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great Authority now just a side note here I'm just going to make for those people who don't know if you type in United Nations lion or United Nations statue you could type that in and you'll see it it's in New York right now an exact replica of what is actually described here in the scripture right outside of the the United Nations in New York and I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the Beast and they worshiped the dragon which gave power unto the Beast and they worshiped the Beast saying who is like unto the Beast who is able to make war with him and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue 40 and2 months and we know that's three and a half years and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name and his Tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven you know in the in the morning devotions the brother that does this reading he he always says can you imagine that blaspheming the people in heaven and all the saints can you imagine doing that doesn't even make sense and it was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and Nations and all that dwelleth upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world if any man have an ear let him hear he that leadth into captivity shall go into captivity he that kth with the sword must be killed with the sword here is the patience and the faith of the Saints and I beheld another Beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and spake as a dragon and he exerciseth all the power of the first Beast before him and causeth the Earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first Beast whose deadly wound was healed and he doeth great wonders so that he maketh Fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men just have to throw a pause there and just say you know what that scripture there is not something out in the future that that's history already the prophet already declared the United States of America Revelations chapter 13 has already called fire down from out of the sky the prophet has declared that this this mystery is history and he doeth great wonders so that he maketh Fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men and just to I guess get specific about it if you take a look at how those bombs were actually detonated they didn't hit the ground and then go off they actually burst in the air they came down from heaven we know that and he deceived them that dwell on the Earth by the means of those Miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the Beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the Beast which had a wound by a sword and did live and he had power to give life unto the image of the Beast and the image of the Beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the Beast should be killed and he causeth all both great and small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads and that no man might buy or sell save he that have the Mark or the name of the Beast or the number of his name here is the wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the Beast for it is the number of a man and its number is 63 score and6 we know that 666 this chapter here speaking specifically about the United States of America and uh we can get into that in a later study but it's amazing to see how the the prophet actually uses this scripture Revelations 131 to18 to actually bring out what he's going to talk about next he says this chapter shows the power of the Roman Catholic church and what she will do through organization remember this is the false Vine let it name the name of the Lord it does so only in a lie its headship is not of the Lord but of Satan it finally ends up completely identified with the Beast the riding on the Scarlet Beast distinctly shows her power is the god of force course Satan and not our God the Lord Jesus Christ in verse 17 it emphatically shows that she will gain absolute control of the Commerce of the Earth for no man can buy or sell apart from her now just to be clear for those who are listening and and reading along this is after the bride has already gone we're not going to be showing a mark on our hand or on our forehead we talked a little bit about this I think on Sunday we're not going to have the mark of the Beast and and enduring the people who were maybe the five unwise virgins are probably going to have to go through something similar there's going to be a time where the entire Commerce of the earth will be controlled for sure right now we're talking about the spiritual mark of the beast which is already in every single human being whether they know it or not whether they understand it or not it's just like gravity we might not be able to even explain it but it's there it's the DNA that we have these bodies these Hybrid Bodies that we live in and uh outside of receiving the Holy Ghost we already have the mark of the beast but don't look for this day this day is a long ways away from us fortunately it's it's going to be a terrible time in Revelations 13:14 we learn that the Beast spreads his influence through the image which is built which was built for him the image that was made is a worldwide ecumenical Council wherein all the organized churches will get together with the Roman Catholics they are doing it even now it's quite possible this Union will come in order to stop the power of Communism isn't that an interesting statement it's possible it is quite possible this Union will come in order to stop the power of communism we can see the world stage right now there's a couple of communist countries that are flexing their muscles right can see the Beast coming in and and stepping up and pushing this back he goes on to say but since communism like Nebuchadnezzar has been raised up to burn the Flesh of the Harlot Rome will be overcome and destroyed take note that everywhere the romish church went communism followed that's interesting history it has to be that way and let me warn you now don't get thinking that communism is your only enemy no sir it is the Catholic Church also and even more so we know brother bam talks about the bamboo the iron and the purple curtains and he said Don't Fear the other ones but fear the purple one now let us read Revelations 13 1:4 and compare this with re Revelations 12 1:5 and I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and 10 horns and upon his horns 10 crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy and the Beast which I saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great Authority and I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and this his deadly wound was healed and all the world wandered after the Beast and they worshiped the dragon which gave power unto the Beast and they worshiped the Beast saying who is like unto the Beast who is able to make war with him Revelations 13 1:4 then he says Revelations 12 1-5 and there appeared a great Wonder in heaven a woman clothed in in the Sun and the Moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of 12 stars and she being with child travailed in birth and pained to be delivered and there appeared another Wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and 10 horns and seven crowns upon his heads and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born and she brought forth a Manchild who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up into God unto God and to his throne Satan and his satanic religion are in both of these beasts Revelations 13 the Beast that was wounded unto death but lived again is Imperial Pagan Rome that fell to the onslaught of the barbarians and thereby lost her temporal power but she regained it in paple room he says do you see it now this discussion here is brought out in the in the study of the seals brother Bram talks about it quite extensively if you're interested the Pagan Ro and Papal room the the deadly wound that was healed he says the nation that ruled by crushing all and which became the strongest empire ever known was finally wounded to death her power was gone physically as to control by armies Etc but under Constantine she came back to life for papal Rome has infiltrated the whole world and her power is absolute she uses Kings and Merchants and in her deadly religious and financial strength she is governing as the goddess of this present age she is also the dragon that stood waiting to Devour the Manchild Herod tried to kill the Lord Jesus and failed later Jesus was crucified by Roman soldiers but now is caught up to the throne exactly according to that scripture now along with what I have just said recall the vision of Daniel the last part of the image the last World power was in the feet that was iron and Clay see the iron is the Roman Empire but now it's no longer solid iron Clay is mixed in it yet it is there and running world affairs in both the democratic nations and the more despotic ones the romish church is in every nation it is mixed up in all that's amazing to think that the romish church is in every nation and we know this word has gone out to Every Nation I think it's interesting brother bradam he talks about something that happened in New York on October the 12th just a couple days ago really in 1960 it happened in New York at the United Nations let me give you a little something on the iron and the clay he says Remember When kushnev beat his shoe on the desk at the UN well there were five eastern Nations there and five Western kushnev spoke for the East and President Eisenhower for the West in Russian kushev is clay and Eisenhower means iron the two main leaders of the world the two big toes of the feet of iron and Clay were side by side we are in the end of it all it makes me wonder just as we're talking about this and you know just studying it all H how much really is there left how late really is it my in verse four it asks who is able to make war with the Beast now there are at present some great names in the world there are some mighty Nations but right now Rome is calling the tune the pope is in the driver's seat and his power is going to increase no one can war against him verse six and he opened his mouth in blasphemy teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men heady high-m minded lovers of pleasure having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof he Blas blasphemed the name of God changing that name to titles and refusing to do otherwise in verse 7 and it was given unto him to make war with the Saints persecution death to the True Believer and all in the name of the Lord in order that the name of God be blasphemed even as it is in Russia because of what the Catholic religion did there and we know brother bam says it very clearly that it's going to be Russia that crushes Rome that destroys Rome in 1 hour one hour that whole city will be gone anybody here ever been there you've seen that City it's big there's a lot of people they call it the Eternal City and that in itself is a blaspheme verse eight and all that dwell upon the Earth all whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world shall worship him they want to eat there isn't going to be any eating there isn't going to be any worshiping you're not going to be doing anything you won't even be going to school unless you can produce that number that's in the back of your hand or in your forehead right now then see this what we have been trying to show you the seed of death that started in the first age this seed of organization has finally grown into the tree in which every foul bird is lodged in spite of her claims that she is The Giver of Life she is The Giver of death her fruit is death they that partake of her are dead this Mighty World Church system that fools the world that in her is physical and spiritual salvation deceives and destroys the multitudes but not only is she is but not only is she death personified but this dead caran creature will be itself put to death with death which is the Lake of Fire oh that men would perceive what their end will be by remaining in her come out of her for why will ye Die My a final warning Revelations 2:23 and I will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the Reigns and hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your Works God lookth on the heart that has never changed neither will it ever change here as though all the ages as through all the ages there are two groups both proclaiming their Revelation from God God and their relationship to God 2 Timothy 2:19 nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his the Lord searcheth the Reigns the word search means to track or follow up I love this thought here I've got it highlighted God tracks down our thoughts he knows what's in our heart he sees our works which are a definite manifestation of what lies within us God tracks down our thoughts Reigns he knows what's in our hearts he sees our works which are a definite manifestation of what lies within us it is out of the heart that proceedes either righteousness or wickedness and I think it's pretty amazing how he's got this written here because I I mean we could have discussion about it I'm sure but we know that it's either good or evil there's no middle ground out of the heart precedes either righteousness or wickedness for me I just pondered this and and and think about it it's either right or wrong what's coming out of us our manifestation the life that we're living and we just need to make sure that we line up with the word you know we'll never do it on our own own we'll never be able to line up with the word on our own we'll try we'll try but brother bradam he said it we read it on Sunday that if we're just trying to live a Christian life then we're impersonating Christianity get the Holy Ghost when he the spirit of truth comes through our lives he manifest our motives our purposes are all known unto him as he watches every action and every action every word shall be brought into judgment when the accounting for our lives is given there was no fear of God before the false Vine and dearly they shall pay let all who name his name so live as becometh Saints we might fool the people but we will never fool the Lord I love that it just makes it so easy it makes it so wonderfully easy easy to just want to repent to just want to get right with God and make things right with the people around us and not try and keep things in our lives it just makes it so easy we have so much to be thankful for the promise in those dark days Revelations 2:2 24-2 but unto you I say and unto the rest in thota as many as have not this Doctrine and which have not known the depth of sin Satan as they speak I will put upon you none other burden but that which he have already hold fast till I come now before we go into the promise let me show again that the church has spoken of by the spirit in this book has two Vines whose interwinding branches compose it but I say unto you and unto the rest in thot tyria as many as have not this Doctrine there it is he is speaking to the two groups one has the doctrine the other has not there they are scattered abroad across the nations with each one's Doctrine opposing the other one is of God knowing his depths the other of Satan knowing the depths of Satan I will put upon you none other birth the word for burden is weight or pressure the pressure of the Dark Ages was either Bend or be broken bow or die it was Inquisition the power of the Empire backing up satanic worship be organized or pay with your life each age had its pressures for example a great burden of the last age is the pressure of riches soft living and nervous tensions in a complex age that we can that we can seem unfitted to live in anybody here ever been nervous ever had a nervous Spirit come on you and start afflicting you and make your heart race and make your mind go wild it's a thing that's the age we're living in it's a complex age this fourth age seems to have had a clear-cut burden it was to defy Rome and stand up for the word even unto death they have not known the depths of Satan it seems that this verse has been left out by some of the commentators for they were not able to figure out what Doctrine or what experiences are meant by this phrase actually it is simple to know what is meant let us first know what the depth of God is and the opposite will be true for the depth of Satan I love how he just continually continually brings the word of God Ephesians 3:16 to19 one of my favorites here he said that he would Grant who you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend we should be able to get this not be lost and and groping in darkness and looking and wondering and and have Mysteries no we should be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passees knowledge that ye might be filled with part of the fullness of God no no with all the fullness of God right with all of God he was part in all of the ages but not this age now according to these verses when a man experiences the depth of God in his life it's an actual personal experience of the spirit of God indwelling him and his mind is illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge of God through the word but the depth of Satan will be in that he will attempt to destroy this he will as always attempt to make a substitute for this reality of God and that's all it is brothers and sisters it's not completely turning around and going backwards 180 degrees it's just simply making a substitute one word off oh you don't have to do that oh you don't have to say say that no you don't have to actually behave that way it's okay for you to just keep that that way that you just have it's okay no it's not okay every single Speck of the old man's got to go that's what the prophet said he says he will as always attempt to make a substitute for this reality of God how will he do it he will take away the knowledge of the truth of God destroy the word by putting forth his own yay hath God said and that comes in many many forms it can be in Tradition it can be in teaching most times it's in teaching it can be in Creeds and dogmas goes on to say he will then substitute the personal Christ in our Spirits making us think that we're saved making us think that we're religious making us think that we're covered that we have the blood in our lives he says he will do it as he caused Israel to do the same by a human being reigning as a King instead of God this Born Again experience will be rejected in favor of church joining thinking that it's going to get better the grass is greener on the other side if the word is the word is the word the depths of Satan had been entered into in that age and the fruit of that depth of Satan which are lies murders and horrible crimes came forth from it how much time do we have oh my we're going to get done here tonight the rewards and he that overcometh and keepeth my Works unto the end to him will I give power over the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a Potter shall they be broken to Shivers even as I received of my father and I will give him the Morning Star he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh and keepeth my Works to the end it is very evident from the remarks of the spirit on works that the Lord is trying to get his own to see his opinion of righteous works I love this four times he mentions works and now he says that he who keeps doing his Works Faithfully Until the End will be given power over Nations and will be strong capable unbending ruler who can cope so powerfully with any situation that even the most desperate enemy will be broken if need be his demonstration of rule by power will be like unto the very Sons this this is very amazing but let us look at this promise in the light of the age powerful Rome with State backing employing Kings and armies and legislators breaks and grinds all of it all before it she has killed millions and hungers to kill Millions more who will not bow to her she intolerably sets up Kings or brings them low whenever she can yay her inter ference has actually caused Nations to fall because she has determined to destroy the elect of God her works are the works of the devil for she murders and lies as did he but there is coming a day wherein the Lord is going to say bring these mine enemies before me and slay them then shall the righteous be with their lord when his righteous indign will fall upon the blasphemers the righteous coming with him in glory shall destroy those who destroyed the Earth and made Havoc of the saints of God this was the age of turning the cheek of terrible distress but the day is coming when truth shall Prevail and who shall stand in its fire and be safe only the redeemed of the Lord I am the root and offspring of David the bright and Morning Star Revelations 22:16 until the day Dawn and the day star arise in your hearts second Peter 1:19 and I will give him the Morning Star according to these scriptures Jesus is the Morning Star the spirit is therefore making a promise to the elect of the Dark Ages relative to himself and then in the ages to come I'll call the musicians as we wrap up here as we have already stated Jesus identifies himself with the messengers of each age they receive from him the Revelation on the word for each period this word revelation brings the elect of God out of the world and into full Union with Jesus Christ isn't that beautiful these Messengers are called stars because they shine with a Boral or reflected light of the sun even Jesus they are also called stars because they are holders of light at night thus in the darkness of sin they bring the light of God to his people this is the Dark Ages it is especially dark for the word of the Lord is almost entirely hidden from the people knowledge of the most high has almost ceased death has overcome vast numbers numbers of the TR of the Believers until their ranks are decimated the things of God are at the lowest EB to this date and it seemed that Satan would surely conquer God's people if ever a people needed a promise embracing the land where there is no light it was the people of the Dark Ages and that is why the spirit is promising them the Morning Star he is telling them that the chief star even Jesus who dwelleth in light unto which no man can approach will in the future Kingdom eliminate them by his own personal presence as I was studying this I just couldn't help but think that we're enduring we're experiencing we're privileged to see this he will not be using the Stars Messengers to give light in darkness any longer it will be Jesus himself speaking to them face to face as he shares his kingdom with them and we know that his kingdom is already here in the heart of every single True Believer it is the morning star that is visible when the light of the sun commences to shine when our son Jesus comes there will be no further need of Messengers he will bring us his message of cheer himself doesn't he do that now doesn't that happen every single time we think even about going to church and as he rules his kingdom and we live in his presence the light of the word will become brighter and brighter in our Perfect Day what else could we desire above Jesus himself is he not everything even perfect everything he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches amen even so Lord God by thy spirit let us hear thy truth let's just stand and bow gracious Heavenly Father tonight Lord Jesus let us hear your truth Lord let us understand father where we stand in the sands of time we know that your word says that no man knoweth the day or the hour oh but father we can see the seasons we can see another season changing Lord
