[22:09] brothers and sisters blessed be the name

[22:12] Christmas song this morning and the
[22:14] reason I'm singing it is we heard some
[22:19] great songs on the uh uh the concert
[22:22] night and the history behind and I just
[22:24] want to give you a little bit of my
[22:25] history of why little Bethlehem and it's
[22:28] the first the first stanza says Oh Come
[22:31] Ye to Bethlehem why Bethlehem I've been
[22:33] listening to all the prophet sermons on
[22:35] Christmas is kind of my you call it my
[22:37] tradition and uh I heard why little
[22:40] Bethlehem and brother Ram gives all the
[22:42] history of why I think salon and and
[22:45] Rahab settled in in Bethlehem then then
[22:47] Jesse then then all the way down David
[22:49] was anointed in Bethlehem and then we
[22:51] called for that drink they ran to
[22:52] Bethlehem to The Well of Jacob to bring
[22:55] that that water to him so Bethlehem is
[22:57] very very very significant we we were
[22:59] taught by the prophet why it was
[23:01] significant the world's got the dates
