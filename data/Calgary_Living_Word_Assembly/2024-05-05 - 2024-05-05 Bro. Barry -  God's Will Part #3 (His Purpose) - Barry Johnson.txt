come [Music] hallu amen Lord bless you all amen I really do struggle with standing up here but sometimes things just grab a hold of me and I can't get free of it keeps me up at night I wake up in the morning for two weeks this thought's been on my heart in 10:30 last last night it manifests itself in the form of this poem but I want to read this simple little quote First that this little thought that started this whole process it said of the anointed ones at the end time brother paragraph 236 for the BR says why did Satan do that is because he didn't know the word for that he knew the word was for that hour but he doed this humble little man being that word we stand the same today Satan's always been astounded how God does things so this poem is called Kinesis or kosis and we know that's what brother bradam said when God pours himself into his church in the spiritual ballet of light and dark Where Angels Sing and demons Embark God in his grace veils himself in human race the mystery hidden the mystical spark the conflict between brightness and shadows unseen lies the truth simple and Serene God veiled in human guise a Wonder to the wise the mystery where Holiness meets this Earthly scene behind the curtain of Flesh and Bone the almighty King chooses to be known amen Satan in his pride is baffled denied as God's presence in man is shown a stumbling block for our adversaries might Fallen man walks with God gleaming bright Satan asserts doubts rain but God's love does sustain Amen in the hearts of Believers pure and right the serpent hoping doubt will arise by his Whisper of deceitful lies God's plan is very clear to those who draw near manifesting timely truth no longer disguised intense battle ensues day and night between darkness and the Eternal Light yet in our Soul's choice we find hope we find voice to manifest God's word burning bright let us declare this paradoxical mystery God's presence in Humanity's history for in these veils called flesh he dwells by our hearts our life story tells the testimony that brings him glory Lord bless you [Applause] all amen thank you for that Brother Don stand as me if you would just a wonderful wonderful reminder of God's grace to us blessed be his name this morning you thankful for the gifts God places in the body just unique brother uh Peter prayed about the bouquet this morning God's Great bouquet every one of us from different parts of the world even from walks of life and different gifts wonderful that God just shows himself that way and just a little little tap on the shoulder let us let us know he loves and now we're going to turn to the preaching of the word to highlight the climax of the service let's just sing this song as a prayer to the Lord Lord just rain down to me personally I want my soul to be so fertile like the ground of my soul to be so fertile that your word when it falls on that can just bring forth fruit for your kingdom let's sing it this morning oh holy spirit

father we're here because we believe and Lord just ask that you would Lord minister to us in a special way today Father Lord let us not leave this building thinking feeling that we just had another

name we pray amen amen amen [Music] amen oh more of you [Music] is more of you maybe stand with me once again of things are my f and yet I hunger still for I hear my pray for of you hallelujah thank you musicians sure appreciate each one appreciate the poem today brother dawn you have your Bibles I would like to just continue on in our study concerning God's will if we could turn to Second Timothy and then over to Romans chapter 8 I know there's a lot of scripture that we could certainly use pertaining to this but it's just the way I felt led second Timothy chapter 3 verse 11 and 12 speaking about God's will amen especially in our lives but taking a text from the Bible in Joseph's life persecutions verse 11 of chapter 3 persecutions afflictions which came unto me at Antioch at laconium at leria what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me am yay and all that will live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution and over in Romans chapter 8 verse 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them are the called who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son amen that he might be the first born among many Brethren now many people could say that's talking about Jesus and sure enough indeed it is but keep reading moreover whom he did he pre predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified amen and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us amen let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father we thank you for your word we know that heavens and earth will pass away but your word will remain help us Lord Jesus to keep your word pure and true before our eyes Lord help us to keep our eyes focused solely on you Lord Jesus not to be looking to the right hand nor to the left we know that this is the day in which the devil wants to distract us father and Lord we just rebuke every devil that would try and come against your bride with distractions we just ask now that you would be with us as we go forwards now in your word in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated I trust your happy today amen certainly thankful to be in the house of the Lord once again just a couple of announcements we have the May 26th communion service at 5:30 p.m. we have the Men's breakfast coming up May the 18th at 10:00 that's at our house there was a a few folks that had uh responded to the original um text that we sent out on WhatsApp but then I had a request from a brother who for some reason didn't get the original text to send it again so I did as a reminder and if you could just let us know if you plan to attend we just would like to make sure we have enough food and we're trying to determine whether we should host it in our house or down in the uh in the Hall of the barn so if you could just let us know that would be certainly uh appreciated we have brother Dela deladon he's coming June the 2nd he will take the Sunday morning service and we have brother Jack Duff coming as well and uh just I I guess it's as usual the schedule that we had for him has now shifted and uh he won't be here I think it was the 17th that we had said originally he will be here on Wednesday July the 12th and that's so that he can actually make it to Saskatoon Tabernacle for brother Dwayne fair so we want to try and uh just be accommodating to everyone and amen we'll see what the Lord will do so yeah that's all of that now we'll uh get into the word I just think it's so beautiful here amen yes this uh scripture that we read and that we know that we have so dear to us I think in uh you know the discussion that we talk about this this word of God and and how we know so many of the scriptures are near and dear to our hearts it's just important for us to remember that we need to remember the whole scripture and not just get focused on preaching or talking about just one part of a scripture and I think it's neat how brother brandham in the church age book the exposition of the seven Church ages he talks about um a verse maybe out of the Book of Revelation part A and Part B so the first half or the second half of a verse and uh we can actually begin to quote a verse in Scripture that is actually only half of a verse and forget the second half which is very applicable to the first half it's it's kind of uh synonymous one and the other and a good example of that is to just to uh resist the devil and he'll free he'll flee right many times we say that scripture I'll never forget brother Aaron mcir preaching on that one time and uh that brother is a very strong preacher and I'll tell you he he said you know we need to remember that there is a first part to that scripture we can just resist the devil all day long and he's not going to flee that's not going to happen but when we take the scripture and apply the scripture the way the scripture says to apply the scripture submit yourself therefore one to another then the devil will flee then resist the devil devil then he has to flee we we find ourselves trying to resist the devil and then we try and flee if we don't actually do that correctly and that's not the scripture we want to make sure that we just quote the scripture properly when we speak the words when we remember the scripture and we know that Romans chapter 8 vers verse 28 it says and we know that all things work together for good we can say that scripture all the time all things work together for the good and they do but only for a certain type of people for a specific class of people and and if you want to to just consider that for a second take a look at around the world maybe even close to home there's a lot of people that are not very fortunate people all things don't necessarily work together for the good but to them that love God and if you have the ability to love God that's because God gave you that ability it's not something that your parents gave you it's not something that your pastor gave you you it's not something that you just found somewhere along the way an ability to love God it's because he fornew you and he chose you before the foundation of the world to be able to love him in an age that's so dark that people can't even love themselves even though they do but in a vain way but it says in and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God and to them who are the called according to his purpose amen and I think that's so good we could even take that as a maybe a subheading from his will his purpose to think about being in his purpose if you're called brothers and sisters you are called unto his purpose and you know we we read it in the exposition of the seven Church ages that persecutions afflictions which came unto me at Antioch laconium leria what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me we know this is Paul talking here to Timothy explaining to him this is what happened to him but we know that all scripture has a compound meaning and Revelation it is going to take rapturing Faith for us to be able to make it through this age in which we live in because we are all going to suffer persecutions if we stand for this word many times we could just say I love Jesus and I'm willing to stand for the Bible but when you have a multitude of people saying that we believe in trinitarian Doctrine and anything else is a heresy oh my guess what's going to happen the people that claim to love God are going to begin to persecute you because you don't believe it the way they believe it it's a terrible thing but it's true but you know what out of all of them the Lord delivered me and we know verse 12 says yay and all that will live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution and that could be taken on maybe a lighter level and and looked at from a denominational level I stand for Jesus now I'm going to suffer persecution true we will suffer persecution if we stand for the name of Jesus Christ but where the true persecution really comes is from within brothers and sisters when we really take a stand for the word of God and say I am not willing to compromise on any amount of this word of God it's going to be my absolute it's the only thing that won't pass away heavens and earth will pass away but the word of God is the only thing that will remain the only way that we're ever going to go into a Rapture is to take all of the word of God not take part of it not take some of it and say you know I I I just going to take some of it and just let it apply to me the way that I feel like it works the best that's not the way it works and you know when we say that we can we can many times look at the word of God and say the whole Bible I'll eat the whole Bible but the message of the hour that's a little bit much that's going a little bit far to say that God sent a prophet and he tied up all the Loose Ends and all of that that's the truth brothers and sisters that is the life and that is the way because what is the message of the hour it truly is Christ appearing back on Earth again it's the word coming of Christ and outside of that Doctrine outside of being able to receive that there will be no Rapture I heard a brother preaching and I thought it was so fascinating if you're interested you can ask me and I could tell you later I'm not going to try and promote anyone from the pulpit but the reason I listen to it is because somebody actually mentioned it to me and and their friend attends the church and the brother preaches pretty hard in general which is good because he's preaching truth and you know what the word of God isn't supposed to make us feel good and and and give us a a fuzzy warm feeling inside which is what some people are looking for the message of the hour is to get people ready for a Rapture and the only way that's going to happen is for us to divorce the old man that that that first twin that first us has to completely die brother bradam says every single Speck of that old man has got to die and when he dies just leave him don't look back at him don't dig him up just let him die don't try and even take his pulse to see if he's dead just walk away leave that old man amen hallelujah but this brother he actually took and and said you know what's going to happen one of these days there's going to be a Rapture of the church there's going to be a going away of the bride and Satan is actually going to be Before the Throne of God and Satan is going to set his eyes upon the bride and he's going to say oh my look at at this I know what's happening and what's going to happen this is what he said what's going to happen is there's going to be three and a half years left for Satan that's it three and a half years and Satan's going to know that the moment that he sees the bride in glory he's going to know his time is over and when he comes down to Earth because when the bride goes up what happens Satan comes down he's no longer allowed to accuse thee of Brethren anymore when Satan comes down for three and a half years the moment he comes down to the Earth he is going to be at work and he's going to be at work with a Vengeance and it's not going to be just with one country just with one group of people it's going to be the entire globe and we know we've seen it we've been able to witness it this is why it gets me excited to talk about we've witnessed it with Co how the whole entire world now is on board with whatever it is whatever the doctrine is whatever the the conspiracy is whatever we want to call it we know the whole world is dialed in and on the same radio frequency whoever in control can simply push the button and every single country now will fall in line with whatever it is they want to do and when he comes down from Glory he's going to get down to business and it's not going to be a pretty time the the Bible says that it's going to be worse than anything mankind has ever seen that's ever been on the face of the Earth three and a half years he's going to come down he's going to get real busy I believe this person when they mentioned it to me they were kind of upset because of the way this brother described it but you know when you stand back and you look at at it it's true think about what's going to happen the devil has had how many years thousands of years thousands of years to just go and play in the church and get that brother upset against that brother and play the the political roles and and intermingle the churches and get governments and be in the world and just going up and down to and fro in the world and doing his thing going Before the Throne of God being able to do all of that but when now the last three and a half years of his existence happened he's going to be mad and we know the Bible says he's going to come with a great Vengeance in the Book of Revelation he's not going to be kind you know what time it is brothers and sisters it's time to get in the boat it's time to get in the ark it's time to stop playing church and to get into Jesus Christ amen the other thing this brother said is there's people who are in the message he said denominations but then he actually got right into the message I know some people are looking at me funny but I think it's important to say these words we need to know this isn't about just playing Church Brothers and Sisters there's people who are in the message of the hour that actually don't want anything to do with the Holy Ghost they'll only come so far and stop the Holy Ghost is the only thing that's going to save you from those three and a half years of tribulation bring it on but you know we're going to sing a song later on I think it's so beautiful when the children of Israel went went to the to the to the Jordan River they got to the place where they were actually going to send spies out into the land what did they do they brought back fruit from that Land There was promised to them and the fruit they brought to them they said taste it and see if this fruit isn't good look it this is evidence there is a Promised Land There is a land that flow us with milk and honey and it's just over there amen but how many people the majority of them they said no no no the natural circumstances no my job no no no no my career no no my image no no no no no no no no my family no no no no no that that Pastor he shouldn't be there no that Deacon no the song leader on and on and on the music whatever it is any excuse is good enough if you really don't want to do something that's what I was taught by my pastor and I believe he was on the word and that's what I'm going to do is preach the word amen get into Christ brothers and sisters it's not time to play church if the thought of three and 1 half years of tribulation scares you then get into Christ it scares you for a reason right I've taught our boys when you get the boys together girls probably aren't this way I don't know because I don't have a girl but I can only imagine they're not this way boys like to be adventurous and they love to be daring I remember when I was a kid we'd climb the the the roof at my friend's house and we would jump off the roof onto the grass just jump off and if you Liv great you're you're adventurous if you didn't get a broken leg great what a silly thing to do but the adventure is there in boys it's just there I think with some girls it is too but you know what we taught our boys was when you get that little funny feeling inside of you that says don't do it it's for a reason it's a self-preservation mechanism that God has put inside of this flesh to save us brothers and sisters if you're afraid of tribulation it's the same thing spiritually speaking to you saying get into Christ and you know there's a lot of people out there in the world they don't even have that they have zero fear there's no fear of a tribulation they would laugh in our face if we told them there is a tribulation there is a burning hell there is a lake of fire there is no eternal life outside of Jesus Christ people would laugh if we have the ability to hear the voice of God he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the church if we have the ability to hear it brothers and sisters jump in that boat get into Christ yes I think it was so good because the way the brother he brought it he said you know if the Rapture of the church were to go tomorrow morning say Monday morning maybe 9:00 by the time people get home from work by the time we get home from work at 5:00 you can guarantee it that the devil is going to have his grip all around the world in8 hours time seven hours time he's going to come down and he's going to get after business he is not going to be kind now what I want to do brothers and sisters is try and encourage us not to be afraid of the tribulation no no there is therefore no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus right and what does love do it casts out fear so what do we have to be afraid of there should be zero fear of a tribulation amen zero because we know we're in Christ Jesus am so I want to encourage us to get into Christ and you know we sing that song but is it true I keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over again do we or is it something we say is it tradition if it's tradition brothers and sisters I just want to encourage us to push aside the tradition shake off all of the all of the maybe the Moss whatever we want to call it shake off all of the Dust anything in our experience that would hold us back from being able to experience the fullness of the word because you know we don't have to be afraid we don't have to worry we don't have to be upset God is in control of every single situation of every sing that's happening brothers and sisters or he's not and we have to choose that either he's in control or he's not so if we say that he is then we can have complete faith but if we say well no he's in control of everything but brother Barry he's just out of control so God's not what he's in control of every single situation and many times brothers and sisters what he wants to do is allow certain things to happen just to see how we're going to react because it shows who's on the inside amen hallelujah anyways I just thought it was real interesting Don't Be Afraid brothers and sisters there is a tribulation there is a hell there is a heaven there is an eternal life right I want to encourage us to fall in love with Jesus Christ I want to encourage us to taste of this fruit and see if it is not something that will change our life forever because if you ever truly get into Jesus Christ according to True water baptism according to the true word of God according to the message of the hour you will never turn back on it you will never be able to walk away from it you just won't be able to but you know we're talking about God's Will from the perspective of Joseph and uh I just think it's such a such an amazing study and I know that I'm not doing it justice by the way I've gone about it so you'll have to forgive me but uh I just think there's so much in here we had talked about the children of uh of Jacob and if you don't mind brother this time I actually got the graphic and uh I didn't actually send it last time last time I thought I sent it and I actually had sent it to myself it was quite early in the morning and I didn't have much sleep and you know my my wife knows that I'm pretty good at doing that sort of thing when it I'm not an emailer I'm more of a a person that will talk but yeah I tried to send an email and it just didn't work so this time I'm sure that I did it and uh I think we have it here but I I just wanted to point something out as we start here about the children of Jacob and and she can bring it up if you have it there so are you just getting it going thank you there's something about these children that I didn't realize before I got into this study here and so can everybody see that okay you can see Abraham and Sarah Isaac and Rebecca and then Jacob Jacob we know that he had a life uh we're going to get into it a little bit later but what I wanted to say was that Jacob had two wives Leah was the first one and Rachel was the second one and I apologize I was called calling Rachel Rebecca last week and I didn't mean to but it's the flesh but we have those two wives but then there is the handmaids the servants zilpa and baa and and I didn't recognize originally that they actually had children that were counted as children who were part of the 12 Patriarchs of Israel kind of interesting the other thing that I wanted to point out as well if you look here on this side through r this is where we're talking about Joseph look at how shaky I am wow Joseph is actually this the one we're talking about that's I think so important for our study but uh you know everywhere that Joseph went he was in the will of the Lord and and we know that's the case that's what we're getting at and uh Benjamin is a type of the Jews that are still in Israel the 144,000 brother Bram talks about the little Benjamins that are still there those two are represented but you know isn't it interesting that over on this side through Leah is the one Joseph did not love her Jacob did not love her I apologize like he loved Rachel he actually was tricked he was beguiled is what the word says into taking Leah for his wife but through that beguilement is the tribe of Judah I don't think I had ever seen that before I mean I mean I just sort of took it for granted but do do you know what I mean am I it's just strange that that's the case that through Leah the tribe of Judah the lion of the tribe of Judah comes through that lineage not even through the lineage of Joseph it's amazing to see but Joseph was a type of Christ and we're going to get into him as we go forwards thank you for bringing that up Brothers if anyone is interested I could send that or you could just look it up online it's real easy to find uh it's neat to look at you know talking about the story of Jacob I I just felt impressed to go back a little ways today and I know that I kind of went a little ahead last time I felt like I needed to but I just wanted to turn over to Genesis 26 and just talk a little bit about Jacob amen and how how his life was because some of the behavior that we saw with lean isn't necessarily a whole lot different than what he was used to in his life was it yeah if we turn over to uh Genesis chapter sorry 25 Genesis 25 just a quick little study here about Jacob and how some of this came about in verse 25 of Genesis 25 talking about the two babies when they came out the first came out red all over like a hairy garment and they called his name Esau and after that came his brother out and his hand took hold on Esau's heel and his name was called Jacob and Isaac was three score years old when she bare them and the boys grew and Esau was a cunning Hunter a man of the field and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents and Isaac loved Esau because he did eat of his venison but Rebecca loved Jacob this is where it gets interesting I I find it interesting that the word of God would say there was a reason why Isaac loved Esau but there's no reason for Rebecca to love Jacob Hallelujah she just loved him she just expressed a love and you know brothers and sisters I want to just weave this in and out as we go today that's that's what I want to encourage us with the word with Jesus Christ for us today let there not be strings attached to your love for him when you can come to the place where you can just love him out of pure completely undefiled love from your heart I believe that's where we will see things happen in our lives Rebecca she just loved Jacob verse 29 and Jacob sought pottage and Es es came from the field and he was faint and Esau said to Jacob feed me I pray thee with that same red podage for I am faint therefore was his name called Edom and Jacob said sell me this day thy Birthright and Esau said behold I am at the point to die and what profit shall this Birthright do to me when Jacob said swear to me this day and he swear unto him and he sold his Birthright unto Jacob then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils and he did eat and drink and Rose up and went his way thus Esau despised his Birthright how did he despise his Birthright by his actions his actions spoke much louder than his words the birthright didn't mean much to him but he was willing to forego that Birthright just for a little bit of natural circumstance change don't be willing to forego our Birthright brothers and sisters for a little bit of natural circumstance change if we don't have a job but we have a good church wherever it is I want to say this it's important amen God will bless you if you're willing to seek him yes amen he will honor you with your faith Faith towards him well we know the prophet said God said through the prophet to this age choosing of a bride the church is the first and foremost if you are a Believer where you Fellowship counts it is very important not only for you but for your entire family and not only for you and your entire family but for that assembly because if we're not supposed to be there in that church what's going to happen is we're going to be a Jonah to our family to ourselves and even that congregation I don't think anyone wants to be a Jonah God will allow the circumstances to get real rough and bumpy he knows how to bring things to pass in our lives what I want to get to here talking about this in Genesis how we had an opportunity for this boy Jacob to actually have a blessing from his dad and we know the story I'm not going to go too far into it that way but how Jacob he was told by his mother he was coerced he was encouraged by his mother you know what your your brother has been requested by his dad your dad to go and get some venison go out in the field and and get get the Venison and uh just bring it back and feed him and we know that while this happened the mother she told told Jacob let's let's quickly do up some some food and we'll make it look like this is Esau coming back and and will trick Dad into giving you the blessing why would Mom do that that was the mother's love hey it's pretty amazing to think that uh that's kind of the way it happened but it is it is the way it happened and uh we know that because of that Esau came back in and he said Dad bless me this is well after Jacob came in and tricked Dad into getting the blessing and Jacob he knew that he had to flee mom told him you know what you better leave you better just go and see my my brother go and stay with my brother and and and see them and just wait until the anger in your brother dwindles but right now he probably wants to kill you he probably wants to get you so you better just go and and we know verse 45 of Genesis chapter 27 says until thy brother's anger turn away from thee and he forget that which thou Hast done to him then I will send and fetch thee from then why should I be deprived also of you both in one day and we know that that's what happened he went and and he he went and and did his thing and while he was living there with lean we know that this is where he came in and and and made the deal with lean he he met Rachel not Rebecca Rachel he met her at the well and uh watered the the animals and that's where the connection started and we we talked about this last time I just thought it was important to go back and just maybe pick up excuse me where Jacob actually got into going to seea because there's something real special that I wanted to talk to talk to you us about today and that is about how Jacob once he actually went forwards we know that there's a a lot going on here Genesis from where we talked about Leah Genesis chapter 29 Leah and Rachel and Zila and uh Bea we know that all the children were born and and there came a time where God came to Jacob and said you know what up it's time for you to go back to your Kindred it's time to you for you to leave this place and go and and he told his father-in-law enough is enough I've got to go we've we've done this 14 plus years of of bargaining for your daughters and and everything that we have together is is what we have and and we need to separate and go and uh so he did that and we know that when he left he didn't leave on good terms he left in a way that was a little bit unsettled I'm I wanted to say Shifty but I'll say unsettled and we we know it was so unsettled that lean and his sons came after Jacob and met him and said what's going on how come did you do this to me and it's interesting because one of the daughters actually stole the idols took the idols from Daddy's house and had them with her and I believe it was Rachel if I'm not mistaken that had the idols and pretended that it was that time of her life and sat in the tent and we know out of respect for the female that way her dad never came and overthrew the tent and just left her alone but she stole the idol she wasn't willing to part with the old idolatry and we're going to get to something here as we go but uh I think it's just beautiful how we look at Genesis chap 32 and we're getting into Joseph this is heading towards Joseph I hope Lord willing Genesis chapter 32 Jacob went on his way verse one and the angels of God met him and when Jacob saw them he said this is God's host and he called the name of that place mahim mahim and we know that Jacob just I'm not going to read it all as he was going he he was heading towards the land of Esau his brother who actually wanted his life for not just duping him out of the birthright for the pottage but actually going and getting the blessing from Dad afterwards for that and uh it was it was uh it was a pretty uh treacherous deal that he did in his family within the family to to do something like that not only to trick his brother his brother didn't realize the power of His words but then to actually spit it on the parents and get the parents to do it and you would think that the parents could just go back on their word and and say you know it was just trickery so it's not going to happen but for some reason Isaac wouldn't change it he said what's done is done I can't change it God it's it's already too late but in chapter 32 verse 9 and Jacob said oh god of my father this is where he gets a little bit desperate and he begins to cry out to God himself and and I just think that many times in our lives God likes us to get to the place where we've become a little bit desperate where we're not interested in looking at the the little tin frivolous problems in this life but we're actually really focusing on him God loves it when we get there because that's what he specializes in coming on the scene when we truly genuinely pray to him and and this is Jacob's prayer and Jacob said oh god of My Father Abraham verse 9 of 32 and God of my father Isaac the Lord which saidst unto me return unto thy country and to thy Kindred and I will deal well with thee so he's taking God back to that memory showing God I remember that you called me once upon a time in my life you called me and and this is the latest time you called me and I just want to remind you of that God you are the only one true God and I want to remind you of your words you called me verse 10 says I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which thou Hast showed unto thy servant for with my staff I passed over this Jordan as I was reading and studying this I just thought how many of us are willing to pray a prayer like that knowing the message of the hour we're not worthy of the least of the grace and the mercies that we get our benefits out of the message of the hour right verse 11 deliver me I pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of Esau for I fear Him lest he will come and smite me and the mother with the children and thou sest I will surely do thee good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude and we know this verse here speaks directly back to where he was in bethl the place that he called bethl that's where we had Jacob's Ladder and the Angels were ascending and descending and he saw the angels and we know brother Bram preached this and it's just so beautiful because we've heard other brothers I think brother Andrew Glover said it that that anchor that ladder Jacob's Ladder is anchored in the heart the throne in the earth and it's also anchored to the throne the The Throne of God in heaven that anchor is sure and it's unmovable and those angels are ascending and descending to each and every person who is willing to believe it but we know that he called this place bethl he called this place bethl the house of God and thou sest I will surely do thee good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude and he lodged there that same night and he took of that which came to his hand as a present for Esau his brother and we know that he goes on to create many different flocks and herds that he sends forward ahead to see his brother and and we know that he spaces them apart he doesn't set them all together as one big group and we know that he also separated the tribe in half one group and the other group so that if one group was to perish at the hand of his brother who really wanted to kill him and make him suffer then the other group would be saved that's what he said but what I want to get to is Genesis 32 real familiar scripture verse 24 and as Jacob was left alone and there wrestled with a man with him until the breaking of the day and when he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day breakthe will not let thee go except thou bless me and he said unto him what is thy name and he said Jacob and he said thy name shall be called No More Jacob but Israel for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men and Hast prevailed and Jacob asked him and said tell me I pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou Dost ask after my name and he blessed him there and brothers and sisters I want to talk about this part right here because it's I believe real important I believe the Lord showed me this and it's real important we have got to see certain things in the scriptures to understand that God will not just let us float through life and and deal with things and leave them sort of undone God will actually come around and make sure the things are sure in our lives and if we ever have things in our lives that maybe aren't sure that aren't done right maybe from the past maybe from many years ago that have have been done and we've just sort of swept it under the rug or maybe life has just pushed us down the road and we haven't been able to go back and fix it Whatever It Is God will make make sure that it's fixed he will not allow us to go forwards with any sin in our lives and this story about Jacob here I know he had a name change and and I know that he had his walk changed he never walked the same after he met with this man but what I think is really really interesting about this is that God wanted to bless him more than he wanted to be blessed just like every single one of us we know that's what brother bradam taught God wants to bless us a thousand times more than we're willing to receive it and why is that because of the things of this world the pressures of this life the troubles the tribulations all the things that we get distracted with they take up our time and energy and and we miss the blessing of God and I want to say it this morning I don't know why we're even preaching like this I believe it's the blessing of God for somebody and if you're looking for a blessing of God it doesn't matter who's preaching or what they're preaching so long as it's true word there's a blessing in store but here we have Jacob now he was left alone he wasn't with people he wasn't caught up with all of the distractions he was alone and there he wrestled with a man until the breaking of the day and we know that he touched his thigh we've read this and he wrestled with him but he said I will not I won't let go he said let me go for the day breth and he said I will not let thee go except for what except for thou bless me because he recognized who he was wrestling with but he wanted to hear him speak his name and he knows that for sure if he blesses him then he has truly received that blessing and so once he received that blessing even though he now had a change of name and he had a change of walk he's able to go forwards walking differently than he ever has before with the assurity that God has blessed him it wasn't just a blessing from man that he received out of Deceit think about how many nights he must have sat up wondering did I really get blessed did I really have the blessing my brother wants to kill me how could I have the blessing of God in my life I tricked him to get the the the blessing the birthright mom and I tricked him to to give me the blessing to get Dad to pray for me and do I really have that blessing in my life how many people wrestle with the idea in your mind whether you've got the blessing of God in your life or not whether you've got the holy ghost in your life or not right I saw one hand back there you know what brothers and sisters it's a normal thing the devil wants us to believe that we don't have the blessing of God if you have the ability to receive the word the message of the hour you've got the blessing you've got the birthright and when that happens you don't walk the same if you're just walking the same way something's wrong now I want to say this I think it's important we were having the conversation I had an opportunity this weekend or the end of this week our boys went to Camp Isaac and Benjamin so I just had the opportunity to spend some time with Christopher and we were having some really good conversations about the word of God how some people can have an experience where they come out of the myy clay out of the muck of this world and God transforms their life so dramatically they can say they've had a change God's given them the birthright they've got the blessing in their life then there's others that grow up in the message and they've never experience that and thanks be to God they will never have to because all it does is brings scars it brings pain it brings suffering there's things that happen that you can't undo you just have to now live with and where this conversation really started it was interesting because it was all about I I like to bake bread I I'm just going to be honest and tell you a little bit about me if you don't know it but I like to make sourdough bread and so opened up a loaf because we have a few different bags knocking around of this bread and I opened up one I was going to make some toast for Christopher and I I I opened up one and uh oh my this one was a little more than just bread it was already dressed up but it was like blue and green and white spots all over it and I was like man this this ain't something we're going to eat we're not going to eat this no way and and so I showed him and let him smell it and let him see the mold and I said to him you know Christopher this makes me think think about a story in the Bible and so I began to express the story in the Bible about the hivites and how the children of Israel were over in the promised land I remember graphically my pastor preaching this this this story and and how they were in the promised land and the instructions were to not take anybody to not let anybody not to spare anybody's life to March forward and Conquer everyone and not have compassion on anybody in the land but what happened was there was two Travelers two guys they came to the children of Israel they came to Joshua my goodness they they had tattered clothes and and they had clumpy shoes and worn out everything wine skins that were all worn out and and and they had moldy dried bread and they said to Joshua when we came you know what this bread was fresh this was fresh bread when we left it was just fresh out of the oven fresh hot bread and if you know fresh hot bread it doesn't turn moldy except for about 3 or 4 days down the road maybe even five depends on how old it is but when it comes out of the oven you've got some shelf life you've got some room to maneuver and it just made me think about it seeing this moldy bread and it was dry and so I started to have this conversation with Christopher and how we're not supposed to take any and and make any concessions for any sin in the land when we're in the promised land brothers and sisters there's no no no concessions that we make we don't make a deal with the Devil you don't have to say I've got this issue and I'll just accept it and carry it on and say well it was my my father or my grandfather it was just a genetics in our family and we just need to accept it and move on that's a lie of the devil because if we are truly baptized with the Holy Spirit there is no generational curse no generational sin that can Prevail over Jesus Christ because that's what the Holy Ghost is so really if we say we've got this thing and we're just willing to accept it what we're doing is we're making a concession and we know once they did that once the children of Israel did that the part that I remember my pastor saying was that even after they actually did make the league with them they could have said you know what we made a mistake and we're not going to accept this but they didn't they said we oh our word is our bond and now we're going to keep it now we're just going to go forwards and you're going to be our servants now and so now the children of Israel had made a concession with the people in the land they actually contravene the will of God they didn't follow the word for their day but it was interesting just to think about that story how it just came up and and how important it is going back now and what I was talking about some people can have the the great transformation but other people they don't do that because they're raised in the message they're raised in the purity of the word but I want to say this brothers and sisters if something has kept us from going out into that world what is it that kept you from going out into that world I'll tell you what it is if you don't understand it on your own whether you're a young adult or or maybe a a child it's the prayers of your parents according to the word of God for their day God honors the prayers of those people who truly seek Him and especially when you have the Holy Ghost in your life and you start praying for your children brothers and sisters there ain't no devil that can come against you ain't no devil that can come against and Prevail your family there's weapons that will be formed but no weapon can prosper so when you're a child and you're raised in the word of God in the message of the hour you don't have the desire to go out and do those things you don't have to let the devil Badger you and say oh you don't have the Holy Ghost in your life it's not a struggle you need to fight because really what's happening is you're fighting a defeated enemy but he wants us to believe oh no you didn't have that experience in your life so you don't have the Holy Ghost so you might as well just give up and and go and eat and drink and be merry for tomorrow you'll die that's not the case if you're a true son and daughter of God you're going to stay on this side of Eternity until the time appointed of the father and you're going to come the way that he wants you to come and that's just going to happen but I I just think it's so important for us to remind our children that just because you haven't had that lightning bolt experience maybe even as an adult you haven't had that experience that some other people have had if you have something inside of you that wants to go to church that wants to serve God that doesn't want to take you out to the bars and out to the parties and out to all the worldly entertainments that's Jesus Christ amen and you need to acknowledge it and recognize it and when you can do that I believe it gives you a certain strength in your life I was trying to encourage Christopher with that you know if you don't have the desire to go and do the bad things and to act bad then that's one sign but another sign that's real important for us maybe this is just really Elementary and I pray that you'd forgive me but maybe just for the children's sake if you maybe just don't desire to go and do that stuff a and that's one aspect of it to know that you actually are in the will of God but another aspect of it this is totally just off the notes I I I don't know I just love the way the Lord does it you know if you just don't have the desire to go out in sin that's one thing but when you do go in sin that's where the devil's waiting that's where the treacherous moment is because he'll say oh look what you did you did that so clearly you don't have it but that's not true what I was telling Christopher is when you do sin because you will sin when you do sin you have something inside of you that wants to repent quickly that's God and when you do that you're the same as David you're a man after God's Own Heart because that was the identification for David is that he quickly repented we're all trapped in this hybrid condition we've said it we've got the can nature that DNA is coursing through our veins we can't escape this Beast nature outside of the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're all brute beasts that's really the way it is but talking about Joseph Jacob getting into Joseph the story I just thought it was really good to go back and take a look at Jacob and see how his daddy was his daddy wasn't pure as the driven snow according to the flesh but we know brother bradam he preached the message works is Faith expressed and you can look at a person according to their works and and see whether they have faith or not because if they have faith they're going to live according to the word they're not going to deviate they're not going to say I'm just going to make concessions and say that I'll take the message mage of the hour and I'll just live it according to my own understanding my own teaching maybe my traditions or understandings they're going to say you know what I'm going to push all of that aside and I'm going to say be it unto me according to Thy word I can't have room in my life for anybody else's theories or ideas I need to have that Revelation and when I have that Revelation then we get into talking about what Jacob has gone through here where he has a changed walk where he knows that he know knows that he knows he can go forwards now and meet his brother and God is with him again I just think brothers and sisters it's so important for us to recognize that we need to be willing to do that you know many times we can have traditions we can have ideas and understandings and if we are not willing to actually push them all aside and just say what is it mean to me what does this word mean to me what does the message of the hour mean to me in my life do I have a real revelation of the message of the hour if we're willing to go that far with it then I guarantee you we will I promise you you will have a full revelation of it God will not leave us nor forsake us that's what he said in his word in Genesis chapter 35 talking about Jacob going up to Beth we know that he had sent forth uh oh my this is even going beyond that sorry I I just had studied this story and and it's just going Beyond I'll just quickly brush on this chapter 33 of Genesis and and going into chapter 34 we know that he had a daughter named Dena and uh out side of of of the the city there was a boy named she sheim the son of hmor the hivite and uh he saw her and he took her and he laid with her and defiled her and his soul clave unto Dena the daughter of Jacob I I personally believe that he fell in love with her and that's what the word of God says and he loved the damsel and spake kindly unto the damsel and we know that they went forward and uh the brothers weren't very happy about what happened to their sister outside of this outside of this city and they were camped outside of this city and uh this boy they they fellowshipped with the people in the city and and that was the invitation and it wasn't the right invitation they shouldn't have done that but here they go and they do that and now this this happened and two of the brothers Simeon and Levi were not happy with it this was dena's Brethren this was two sons of Leah and we know that Leah was actually the mother of Dena also but Simeon and Levi they decided we're going to play h a trick on these guys and we're going to tell them the only way that you can have her is if you're willing to follow the laws of our land and that is that every male has to be circumcised and if you're willing to do that then you can have the damsel you can have our sister and they were fully never fully intending to give their sister away they said that for a purpose because if every male did that it's an operation and it made made them sick and they had to heal they had to have some time and as they went through that process what happened was these two men Simeon and levite dea's brothers they they took each man his sword and came upon the city boldly and slew all the males can you imagine that as a dad with my family I go and I I park our camper outside of a city and and if I had a daughter I find that one of the guys in the city mistreats her and now the brothers go and slay everybody in the city oh my to think about how much repercussions would come from a situation like that that's what they were up against and now Jacob was like my goodness this this whole thing of me misbehaving it's never going to leave my house but we know it was the will of God because all of the inhabitants of the land were like wow these are not guys we want to mess with but it was treacherous for them in the moment it wasn't what he wanted to do but Jacob again stressed you can only imagine he had some prayer meetings in chapter 35 it says and God said unto Jacob arise and go up to bethl and dwell there and make an altar unto God that appeared unto thee when thou fled from the face of thy brother now just talking about Jacob a bit before we get into Joseph and I can see our it's amazing how this goes um just looking at this how Jacob there was an instruction from God to go back in time in his life to go back to where he had put down a stake with God where God had dwelt with him and it wasn't just Jacob saying I think that I'm going to go back to where that time was with God this was God calling him and telling him go back to that place and you know brothers and sisters it just hit me this morning as I was studying we have got the opportunity to have the conversation with god and when are in prayer and you're meditating on the word of God you're meditating with God you're speaking to him and you're just quiet in yourself you're not distracted with all the things in this world God will speak to you and he will tell you to go back to that place in your life because that's where we had communion and that's what God told him go back there to where you had communion with me where you fled us from your brother in verse two then Jacob said unto his household and I just think this is real important brothers and sisters if we want to have that kind of communion we've got to be willing to say this to our household fathers husbands single Brothers whoever it is we've got to be willing to say this to our household I think pastors need to be willing to say this to their household and to all that were with him put away the strange gods that are among you and be clean and change your garments and let's get back to god let's get back to that place where we had that strong communion and then we know God will deal with us he'll show us what we need need to know for in our journey in our lives I just think this is such an amazing discussion now we can just go forwards and talk about how Joseph was actually in in the land of Egypt we know the the the brothers we talked about it in the past how the brothers did not like him they actually didn't like him at all the 12 Brothers the 11 Brothers sorry because what did he do maybe the 10 Brothers Benjamin loved them but the 10 Brothers they hated him because God was with him and God was not with them God was only tolerating them but there was only a couple of them that God was really interested in and and we know that all of the children were born they were born from from the Two Sisters Leah and Rachel and uh builda and I'm forgetting the other one the two uh handmaids we know that they are the ones the Four Sisters the four women were the ones that actually were uh the mothers of all the children it wasn't just one mother and because of that it caused fighting infighting it caused feelings of envy and and of hatred and uh malice there's different things but uh you know I I'll just read out of this the True Church of Christ in 1965 uh sorry it's the choosing of the bride and just to talk about the True Church of Christ amen how we can bring this up to our day I know we're talking about the stories and kind of bouncing around a bit but I want to get into the discussion about Joseph here in uh 1965 the choosing of a bride brother bradam says notice just a minute a nun in the Catholic church that woman to become a nun takes that last Veil she is absolutely sold out to that church she is soul body and spirit property of that church she has no mind of her own she can't have when she takes that last Veil no mind of her own no will of her own see out here that Satan makes them his true bogus like the true makes them his bogus like the true sorry the True Church of Christ the bride is so sold out to him and his promised word till the very mind that's in Christ is in you what a difference brothers and sisters I know that we have seen it in the past and I think it's so important to talk about maybe people won't like it but I think it's important that there are people in the message of the hour that believes that they need to be sold out soul body and spirit become property of that church so sold out that whatever is suggested the church will begin to do it brothers and sisters that's not right get into Christ we know the word said I'm going to get into it today somewhere along the way Lord willing let this mind that was in Christ Jesus be where in you it can't be the pastor's Direction the pastor can only point to the word of God and if the pastor is not pointing to the word of God I'm sorry but I think you got the wrong pastor but there's people in the message of the that have actually gone this way where they're so sold out to the church and what happens is sadly the children grow up see the parents be mistreated and then the children are actually not able to have a full relationship with the church but what we're talking about is the true church of Christ the bride the mystical body of Jesus Christ that's where we want to be sold out that's where we want to know the word of God ourselves so that nobody can ever mistreat the church the True Church of Christ the bride is so sold out to him his promised word till the very mind that's in Christ is in you what a difference and we find today the modern Church a modern World Church the modern world church and also that the spiritual church are both pregnated to give birth to sons and you know one of them one of them you could say their name is Esau and one of them you could say their name is Jacob it's very difficult to say but it's true true one of them a denominational birth is going to be give one of of day to these days at the World Council of churches which will produce to the world the Antichrist through a denomination that's exactly the truth this is where I think it gets so important for us to recognize this is a Vindicated Prophet just like Nehemiah just like Jeremiah just like Ezekiel just like Daniel just like all of the prophets here we have a prophet saying these words he says I may not live to see it I believe I will but you young people remember that you heard a minister say that that'll finally wind up and that's the mark of the beast when she forms that World Council of churches and she'll give birth to her son the Antichrist so how is that going to happen just by simply compromising on our Birthright compromising on the word of God now we'll just bring it down a little further and say compromising on the message of the hour because if we compromise on the message of the hour brothers and sisters we're compromising on the word of God if we're compromising on the word of God we're compromising on our Birthright it's terrible but it's true we need to make sure that we are absolutely in line with the message of the hour for our day the other is pregnated by the word of of God and will bring forth the body the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride the body of Christ isn't finished yet how many knows that that's where I can't understand how some Ministry would say that it's us for no more that he's left the throne because the seals are open and he's no longer sitting as an intercessory for the Bride of Jesus Christ that's not true at all a man and woman is one and Christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together makes the one body again like Adam was at the beginning man his wife are one now she the true bride so sold out to him that she used no mind of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word and I'm going to say his word is the message it can be difficult I know it's not easy to say it but you know when we truly get the baptism of the Holy Ghost the message becomes a new message it's no longer dos and don'ts it's no longer a religious Association it's no longer a tradition that our parents taught us it's actually the life of Jesus Christ it takes the word word of God and makes it a brand new book to us and it gives us the ability to say oh my be it unto me according to Thy word because I want to be in thy will we don't have to be afraid of tribulation we don't have to be afraid of permissive will all we have to do is March forward and trust the Lord and I'm not saying to go and walk over Flags when God tells you when you're in prayer to not do something and we go and do it brothers and sisters God speaks to us amen if we do that he'll let us know and we'll know real quick his permissive will but then I want to say this to you I want to say it to me I want to say it to us just go back to where we were with him go back to where we did have communion with him just go back to where you get off is what brother bradam said where you found that you got off track you know God will sell he'll tell you we won't be groping in darkness wondering where we where we got off we'll know exactly the red flag that we stepped over I said Lord help me I know that I've stepped over Flags in my time I trust that I've been able to deal with them according to his word in my life the believer's position in Christ 1955 the main thing is if we can find where God's word belongs in our life there's one thing to talk about where God's word was in the prophet and maybe in our parents maybe in a pastor but where is it in our life God sets times and time limits and then it works all to that time amen many of them before the coming of the Lord Jesus they was many false things raised up and said this is the Messiah and this is many false things taken place according to the scriptures just before the coming of the Lord Jesus and people will try to do it within themselves they will try to make God's word fit in their program brothers and sisters don't try and get God's word to fit in our program I just really want to go there and I really want to do this thing and if I I just go and and do this thing I know that God will bless me for it somewhere along the way no make sure that we know God wants us to do that amen he says but you got it vice versa you've got to fit God's program amen and that's where I say brothers and sisters this was the Revelation for me if we can fit God's program then we say Amen to the word of God and alls we want to do is follow the message of the hour the only thing we want to do is follow the word of God we don't want to try and make excuses and try and fit it to our lives and say that I'm just going to adapt it and live it this way because of that thing that happened somewhere along the way no we want to serve him with all of our hearts you've got to fit God's program that we find that's true now now the Moses when he was here knowing that God had made a promise that he was going to deliver the children of Israel why Moses knowing that he was called for that purpose now when you have a call from God that doesn't altogether mean that you just jump right out and you're doing the will of God you've got to find the will of God and the time of God to do it so it's very important for us to remember to be in the will of God is one thing but What's the timing of God there's many different ways for him to show us one of the biggest ways for him to show us if we're waiting on the Lord for a certain thing to happen in our lives he'll close the door or he'll open the door and sometimes you have to step through that door by faith but if he doesn't want you to step through that door he'll tell you sometimes we need to step through a door and it might not actually look like it's a blessing it might look like it's a curse but I want to say it this way take a look at Joseph's life he stepped through a door God gave him a dream and he told everyone that you're going to Bow Down and Worship me and they all said you that's not going to happen boy you're just a kid we're not going to worship you you little dreamer forget about it and even his dad rebuked him but what happened was he was stepping through a door God told him something in his life and he did it but what happened when he stepped through that door he caused hatred he caused a problem he he found himself in a pit being sold as a slave for following the will of God in his life but he never once gave up on God he kept God right there in his heart you could only imagine if someone could write the Psalms hey what he must have cried out from inside that pit the thoughts that were inside of his heart but even though he was in the will of God it wasn't a pretty situation sometimes we can find ourselves in a very unpleasant situation and still be very much in the will of God and I want to say this because he wants to actually get something out of us amen David had adultery in him David was a man after God's Own Heart but he had murder in him and God allowed both of those things to happen to get them out of him and we know what was his thing he repented quickly we have things in our lives God will let us go through trials being even in the will of his his will to allow that trial to come to pass to get that certain portion of the old man out of us and I say Lord help me because I'm not looking forward to trials I'm not saying bring on the trial to anyone because that is not a pretty thing it's not pleasant brothers and sisters trials we know are not pleasant but God allows them you know talking about this mind Philippians chapter 2 maybe turn with me as we have a few minutes left Philippians chapter 2 to start with verse five I just love the study of Joseph and I apologize if it seemed really broken today just wanted to talk maybe a little bit about Jo Joseph's lineage and how his daddy had some traits in him that maybe just weren't really that that that above board and we know know that these things can linger in our lives and cause certain circumstances and even though we have the circumstance it doesn't mean we're out of God's will because if we've got his will in our heart if we've got his word inside of us then we are very much in his will here we have Philippians chapter 2 verse 5 it says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus this is where we could just simp say this we're talking seventh seal word here now amen the complete opening of all the seals brothers and sisters who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men this is God this is the one who is the the creator of Satan the creator of all the Angels the creator of the universe the Creator the king of Kings the Lord of lords but what did he do he set aside his robe and his crown and he he jumped into a body of Flesh a baby into a womb and actually manifest into the Earth and we know that Satan he heard that that was going to happen but he just couldn't believe that was him and it's many times exactly the same way with the bride of Jesus Christ Satan looks at every one of us he knows our past history he knows our parents he knows our genetic defaults what we're pred exposed to all these different things and he says you no way no way you could be the Bride of Jesus Christ but we just keep getting back up again and he doesn't know what to do with that that's why Satan will come to the place where he just won't know what to do with you and it truly is difficult for him when we actually are in the will of God but verse 9 says wherefore also wherefore God also having highly exalted him and had given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in Earth and things under the Earth that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence how many more people how many people are obeying this word of God even in Paul's absence my work out your own salvation with fear and trembling I want to say this the time is short brothers and sisters work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is God which worketh in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure if we're willing to submit ourselves to him he's the one that's going to do it all what is the very next verse do all things without murmurings amen and disputings amen do all things without murmurings and disputings if we're in the will of God if we're in the word of God if we've got this message of the hour in our lives then we're going to take verse 14 and we're going to live our lives according to that and we're not going to make excuses for it and say because of this because of that because of the other thing we're just going to say oh my Lord forgive me I'm sorry I just want to be right with you I want to be in line with this word of God do all things without murmuring ings and disputings why so that you may be blameless oh my and harmless does that mean that we could be harmful I want to say yeah we could be harmful if we are murmuring and if we are disputing we could very much be full of blame and harmful but if we're doing it without murmurings and disputings taking it patiently like Joseph Maybe maybe he actually screamed and yelled and got upset maybe he disagreed bitterly with his brother but he still shook his hand and said I love you brother you're my precious brother and we're going to share Heaven we're going to be in eternity together we're going to eat supper at that marriage supper of the Lamb together we're going to be together even though we bitterly disagree we don't actually bitterly spit upon each other and say we bitterly disagree and we still believe the message of the hour and we never call each other and there's no Fellowship no maybe we just don't agree or see I eye on that one thing but we know more about it because we're actually pillars in The Community of Christ so that we can be harmless and blameless what the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation among whom you shine as lights in the world you know brothers and sisters we got to close my do we have to close good maybe just a couple more minutes and I'll call the musicians we hear some ministers say when you say we're going to be closing soon that means 20 more minutes so I don't know I don't want to put a time limit on I don't want to be disrespectful of our time either as brothers and sisters I I just want to say this part and and we'll leave off here and we'll get back into it next week Lord willing I just think this is amazing uh you know what I want to say I'll just call the musicians as I say these words and we'll pick up from here next time you know even though we look towards heaven we look towards eternity we look towards the prize we press towards the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus we look towards that Eternal day our position in the throne the the Overcomers of Leo to seean church age but you know brothers and sisters I'm I'm I'm convinced myself that it's not the destination because our destination is sure it's all about the journey it's all about the journey it's all about dealing with the gas station attendant it's all about dealing with the person that cuts you off it's all about dealing with a harsh boss it's all about dealing with the misunderstandings between husbands and wives it's all about dealing with the misunderstandings between brothers and sisters in the church it's all about the journey and how we conduct ourselves because that shows who we really are and you know if we want to see the example the example that we ought to be looking for if we have that mind that we spoke about if that mind is in us then we're going to live our lives like Jesus Christ the only person that's really going to get us upset are the most religious ones that's the only thing that's going to get us just a little bit worked up but everything else we've got it all under control man we could be sleeping in the back of the boat and there'll be just about sinking some people will say well brother Barry he was in the back of the boat and he had a great great healing campaign and we know the prophet of God said that 20 minutes of anointed preaching is the same as eight hours of manual labor which I truly believe if you ever experience it Mondays are kind of rough days sometimes but you know Jesus was God and truly he was tired but I don't think he was fussed and I think that was a situation that he was fully aware of in the back of the boat and the word of God says that he was asleep but he had no fear if we have his mind inside of us Brothers and sisters I think that's the biggest curse of the devil in this day is that we have fear Don't Be Afraid perfect love casts out all fear we know that's in Corinthians brothers and sisters Don't Be Afraid cast out fear with the love of Jesus Christ with that love that is inside of us when we have his mind I feel like I could just preach another hour really easily and I don't want to keep us today I know we have commitments and jobs and I just certainly appreciate each and every one be stand with me as we close you know brothers and sisters it's all about how we conduct ourselves every step of the way it's about the journey and it's about attracting people to Christ showing people that we serve a living God not that we we are just full of form and and dead works and we just come to church and we just go home and we don't have a God in our life that's alive and well it's actually a living God that we serve and what happens is it attracts people to Christ you you've heard the saying you get more be with honey if you try and actually show bitterness to people around bit people see bitterness and and and and and and and and and what happens is you detract people people don't want to be around you but boy when you're sweet people love to come around you and that's what that saying is about you get more bees with honey when you're sweet and you're lovely you attract people and people want to know why you're sweet why you conduct yourself with joy even in the midst of a trial who does that but someone who has that mind which was also in Christ Jesus God bless you today let's pray gracious Heavenly Father Lord we certainly love you and we thank you for your word because we know it's your will and Lord as we go forwards I pray that you would just keep your hand upon each one of us that we would just have such a god Consciousness in our lives Lord that we would conduct ourselves with you every step of the way that Lord when we go to to work tomorrow morning or school or wherever it is that we go whatever it is what we do that we would just take you with us Lord just like we would invite a friend to come with us and Lord we would always change the way we do things and make Provisions to make sure there's

Jesus Christ to the world around us Lord amen father we pray that you would just be with our families Lord help us in our marriages Lord father we need you every step of the way in our lives and

Pride that we couldn't come before our family and repent for our sins before our family Lord we know that oh Father your Prophet said you said it to the disciples even if we have something in our lives and it's not right don't come to church and worship but leave that thing at the altar leave that sacrifice at the altar and go make that thing right but then come back and worship father we pray that we would just be willing to sacrifice everything about us Lord just be stripped down lord not have any pride in our lives and just give you the preeminence that you desire father we know that the time is so short and we just want to make sure that we have it all fixed up here on this side Lord so father we just pray that you would go with us as we go our separate ways be with those who
