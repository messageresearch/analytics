[17:04] &gt;&gt; If you have a need this morning, maybe
[17:06] just make it known unto him by the way
[17:07] of an uplift hand.
[17:10] Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus,
[17:12] what an honor and a privilege it is to
[17:14] worship you, Lord, in spirit and in
[17:17] truth. Father, to recognize that many
[17:20] people will claim that that's what they
[17:21] can do. But, Father, only by the
[17:24] revelation of who we are, is that even
[17:28] possible, Father, this morning, we just
[17:31] want to commit each and every one of our
[17:33] lives into your hands for your care,
[17:35] Lord. Father, we just ask Lord Jesus
[17:38] that we could strip ourselves of our
[17:40] humanity. Lord, of our own ideas and our
[17:43] own traditions and our own teachings,
[17:45] Lord, everything that we think we might
[17:47] know, Lord, help us to push it aside and
[17:50] give preeminence to you, Lord Jesus, to
[17:53] your spirit as you want to move in our
[17:56] midst, Lord. Father, we just want to
[17:58] commit this service into your hands,
[18:00] Lord, for your glory in our lives, Lord,
[18:03] that we would be changed by it, Lord.
[18:05] Father, you don't need to change, but we
[18:07] do. Father, help us, Lord, to take the
[18:10] words that are spoken today, Father, for
[18:12] real. That they are the difference
[18:14] between life and death. Father, we pray
[18:18] that you would just be glorified, Lord,
[18:20] in the songs that we sing today, Lord
[18:22] Jesus. Father, we pray for those that
[18:24] can't be here today, wherever they are,
[18:26] Lord Jesus. Father, maybe they're sick
[18:29] at home, Lord, and unable to come.
[18:31] Father, maybe they're hurt and
[18:33] indifferent, Lord, and just deciding not
[18:35] to come wherever they are, Lord. We pray
[18:37] that you would just pour out a blessing
[18:39] upon them, Father. Lord, that they can't
[18:41] even contain.
[18:43] &gt;&gt; Father, we pray for those who are on the
[18:45] mission field for you this morning,
[18:46] Lord. Brother Toby in Edmonton, Lord.
[18:49] Oh, Father, with Brother Jerry and the
[18:51] Saints there, we pray that you would
[18:53] just give them a fresh coal off the
[18:55] altar, Lord. Be with Brother Mvin, Lord
[18:57] Jesus, in Japan this morning, Father. Oh
[19:00] Lord, your five-fold ministry, wherever
[19:03] that is, Lord, wherever they are, we
[19:04] pray that you would just purge the
[19:06] branch one more time, Lord. And Father,
[19:09] this morning here, we just ask that you
[19:11] would bless Brother Max. Lord,
[19:13] &gt;&gt; help him to get out of the way one more
[19:15] time, Father, and just give you the
[19:18] preeminence in him, Lord. Let him be a
[19:20] conduit, Lord. Maybe like he was last
[19:22] night, Father. Maybe in a greater
[19:24] measure, Father. Speak to our very souls
[19:27] this morning, Lord Jesus. because we
[19:29] know that it depend our lives depend on
[19:32] it Lord Jesus. Father we pray that you

[39:24] Still I will sing your praise.
[40:17] God bless you. Um, the song I want to
[40:21] sing this morning is titled God Will
[40:24] Work It Out. Um, and it's been on my
[40:27] mind, I would say, for the whole of the
[40:30] year so far. Um, and as as I think about
[40:35] the song, the scripture that I meditate
[40:39] on is be still and know that I am God.
[40:42] And sometimes I'm restless and I'm
[40:44] obsessive about the outcomes of things.
[40:46] But um I could just be still
[41:07] before I knew my name. Before I drew a
[41:12] break, he was making ways for me.
[41:18] Now in every day and each and every
[41:22] step, he's still making ways for me.
[41:28] When my heart
[41:30] is full of doubt.
[41:33] Feels like faith is running out.
[41:38] I've come too far to turn around.
[41:44] I know
[41:50] God will work it out.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; God will work it out. One thing I know,
[42:01] one thing I found
[42:04] is my God will work it out. Yes.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Pushing past defeat, fighting to
[42:15] believe. He's making ways for me.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; He will let me down. Never ever leave.
[42:26] He's still making ways for me.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When my heart is full of
[42:33] doubt,
[42:34] feels like fate is running out. I've
[42:39] come too far to turn around.
[42:44] I know
[42:50] God will work it out.
[42:54] God will work it out. One thing I know,
[43:00] one thing I found
[43:03] is my God will work it out. I know he
[43:08] will. God will work it out.
[43:13] My God will work it out. One thing I
[43:18] know, one thing I found is my God will
[43:24] work it out.
[43:29] Be still
[43:31] my soul.
[43:33] Be still
[43:36] and know
[43:38] leaning in.
[43:40] Take hold
[43:43] in God
[43:45] alone.
[43:47] Be still
[43:50] my soul.
[43:52] Be still
[43:55] and know
[43:57] lean in.
[43:59] Take hold
[44:01] in God
[44:04] alone.
[44:07] Be still my soul.
[44:11] Be still
[44:13] and knowing.
[44:18] Take hold
[44:20] in God
[44:22] alone
[44:27] because God will work it out.
[44:32] God always works it out.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; One thing I know, one thing I found is
[44:41] my God will work it out. I say that God
[44:47] will work it out.
[44:50] God will work it out. One thing I know,
[44:56] one thing I found is my God will work it
[45:02] out. I sing it again. God will work it
[45:06] out.
[45:09] God will work it out. One thing I know,
[45:14] one thing I found is my God will work it
[45:20] out. One thing I know, one thing I found
[45:27] is my God will always work it out.
[45:47] Amen. God bless you. Stand with me if
[45:48] you would. Couple of wonderful specials,
[45:52] reminding us to praise him. I was
[45:53] thinking of as our sister was call
[45:55] singing David's comment. His scripture
[45:57] was, "I've yet I'm I've young, I've been
[46:00] old. I've yet to see the righteous
[46:01] forsaken or godly baking bread. He
[46:03] always works it out. Amen.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; I'm not a young guy. I'm not an old guy,
[46:09] but I'm old enough
[46:10] &gt;&gt; to know
[46:12] &gt;&gt; that God always works it out.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Always does. Always does. Amen. Thank
[46:17] you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; He's wonderful. What a confession this
[46:30] is. Oh yes. I'm a child of the king. Not
[46:34] just a king. Sing it with me this
[46:36] morning. Sing this chorus and one more
[46:38] chorus and I'll call our pastor.

[46:49] of the king.
[46:53] His royal
[46:55] blood. It now flows through my veins.
[47:03] And God
[47:05] who was rich
[47:07] and poor
[47:10] sing.
[47:12] Praise God.
[47:15] Praise God.
[47:17] I'm a child.
[47:22] Oh yes.
[47:24] Oh yes. I'm a child
[47:29] of the king.
[47:32] He will ro
[47:40] my

[47:50] sing. Oh, praise God.
[47:54] Praise God. Oh, praise God.
[47:58] Praise God. Oh, praise God.
[48:03] Praise God.
[48:06] I'm a child of the king. That's a little
[48:10] clap offering of praise again. Thank
[48:12] you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. I was
[48:16] wretched. Now I'm a child of the
[48:20] Lord. How great you are this morning.
[48:23] Brother Barry, would you come?
[48:27] Holy Spirit,
[48:31] thou art welcome
[48:34] in
[48:36] this place. This place invited this
[48:38] morning. Holy Spirit,
[48:42] thou art welcome
[48:45] in
[48:47] this place.
[48:56] Mercy
[48:58] and grace
[49:01] are well.
[49:08] Do you mean that today? Holy Spirit,
[49:11] Holy Spirit,
[49:13] thou art
[49:17] in
[49:18] this place.
[49:21] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[49:32] Amen.
[49:51] Amen.
[49:54] song is so wonderful because when we
[49:56] sing that song, some people might say
[49:59] he's welcome in this building,
[50:02] but the believer sings he's welcome in
[50:05] this place.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; In the place that he created to dwell,
[50:12] &gt;&gt; we just have a couple of requests that
[50:14] we would like to bring before the Lord
[50:16] for prayer. We want to pray for brother
[50:19] Richard Nixon in South Africa.
[50:22] his sister Felicity Hines father and he
[50:25] has to undergo surgery for internal
[50:27] bleeding. So we want to remember brother
[50:29] Richard Nixon. We also have a request
[50:32] for a brother named Hugh Quan I believe.
[50:37] He's a friend of the Ajimies and uh he
[50:40] has real severe cancer and uh is in a
[50:44] bad condition and we just want to
[50:46] remember him. Hugh Quan
[50:50] and also we want to pray for brother
[50:53] William Pavick this morning.
[50:57] He has a need in his life. But we'll
[50:59] pray for him in a moment. If you have a
[51:02] need this morning, maybe just make it
[51:04] known unto the Lord by way of an uplift
[51:06] hand.
[51:08] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, this
[51:09] morning we are so thankful that we've
[51:11] come to your house, Lord Jesus.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Father, maybe
[51:17] What's more, we're so thankful that you
[51:20] called us
[51:21] &gt;&gt; to your house, Lord.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; And Father, that you've given us an ear
[51:24] to hear what your spirit says to the
[51:27] church in the day in which we live.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Father, this morning, we just want to
[51:32] give you all the praise and all the
[51:33] glory. If there's any good thing, Lord
[51:35] Jesus, in our lives, it comes from you.
[51:38] And we thank you for that. We
[51:40] acknowledge that, Lord. We acknowledge
[51:42] you, Father. And Lord Jesus, we just
[51:44] want to remember these requests, Lord
[51:47] Jesus, that we mentioned. Father, this
[51:50] this brother named Hugh Quan, the friend
[51:54] of the Ajimies, Lord Jesus, we pray that
[51:56] in this condition, Lord, that you would
[51:58] touch him.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Father, if it's your will for him to
[52:01] raise up off of the bed, Father, we just
[52:04] thank you for that.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; And Lord, if it's your will to take him
[52:08] home, Father, we thank you for that as
[52:10] well. But Lord, before that can happen,
[52:13] we ask that perhaps he could come to
[52:15] know you in the power of your
[52:16] resurrection, Lord Jesus. The way that
[52:19] the Ajimies have, Lord, that they could
[52:21] literally witness your life to this
[52:23] brother, Father. And Lord, we'll be
[52:25] careful to give you the praise. Lord, we
[52:28] want to stand united with our our our
[52:31] friends and our brother and sisters,
[52:33] Lord Jesus, in South Africa, Lord, for
[52:36] brother Richard Nixon, Lord, that needs
[52:38] a touch from you. We pray that you would
[52:40] minister, Father, your surgical hands to
[52:44] this brother, Father. That you would,
[52:46] Lord Jesus, just touch him, Lord, in the
[52:48] name of Jesus. That you would make him
[52:50] whole again.
[52:52] Father, this morning we want to remember
[52:54] each and every need that was made known
[52:56] unto you by way of an uplift hand. We
[52:58] know that you're more than able, Lord
[53:00] Jesus. We know that you're here. We've
[53:02] already declared this meeting to be in
[53:04] your name. We thank you for coming, Lord
[53:06] Jesus. Father, we didn't invite you just
[53:08] to have a show today, Lord. We've
[53:10] invited you so that we could acknowledge
[53:12] you, Lord. So that we could greet you
[53:14] with a kiss, Lord Jesus. Father, so that
[53:17] we could anoint you with oil, Lord
[53:19] Jesus, so that we could welcome you in
[53:21] our midst to wash your feet, Lord Jesus,
[53:23] and fully appreciate you today, Lord. We
[53:26] pray that you would feel that welcome in
[53:27] our midst, Father.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; We pray that you would be glorified now,
[53:31] Father, in all that's said and done.
[53:33] Bless our brother Max, Lord, as he
[53:35] brings the word. Father, we just want to
[53:37] ask, Lord, also that you would touch
[53:39] Sister Mary Carpenter. She's requested
[53:41] prayer. Her husband has, Lord, we know
[53:44] that you're more than able to, Lord
[53:46] Jesus, minister your grace to those
[53:48] folks down in the pass. Lord, we pray
[53:50] that you would be with those in
[53:52] Lethbridge once again. And Father, we
[53:55] just want to ask that you would, Lord,
[53:57] be with us now. In all things, we give
[53:59] you thanks. In Jesus Christ's name we
[54:02] pray.
[54:03] Amen.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; If you don't mind just standing for a
[54:07] moment, brother William has asked I
[54:10] think a notable thing and uh many times
[54:13] it can be overlooked in the church but
[54:16] he asked something that I believe as
[54:19] believers we believe this with all our
[54:21] heart
[54:22] &gt;&gt; and and if we don't we ought to
[54:25] &gt;&gt; because it's exactly according to the
[54:26] word of God
[54:28] &gt;&gt; and it's exactly according to what the
[54:30] prophet for our day said.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:33] James 5:13
[54:35] says, "Is any among you afflicted?
[54:39] Let him pray. Is any merry? Let him sing
[54:43] songs.
[54:45] Is any sick among you? Let him call for
[54:48] the elders of the church
[54:51] and let them pray over him, anointing
[54:54] him with oil."
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; So that's what we want to do. I would
[55:01] just like to invite brother Max to come
[55:03] at this time and I'd like to invite the
[55:06] elders of the church to come at this
[55:08] time and we're going to anoint brother
[55:11] William with oil and we are going to
[55:14] pray for our brother.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; We know that the prayer of faith shall
[55:19] save the sick and the Lord shall raise
[55:21] him up
[55:23] &gt;&gt; and if he has committed sins they shall
[55:26] be forgiven him.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? This prayer is not
[55:31] exclusive. It's not specifically
[55:34] ordained just for brother William. It's
[55:36] for every single one of the children of
[55:39] the Lord. And I think it's just notable
[55:40] because the prophet said it very clearly
[55:42] that if we believe this scripture to be
[55:45] true, we would do exactly what brother
[55:47] Williams doing right now, calling for
[55:49] the elders of the church, get anointed
[55:51] with oil and prayed for, and that would
[55:54] be that.
[55:56] Amen.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; So this morning I just want to take the
[55:59] word of the living God
[56:02] &gt;&gt; to task
[56:03] &gt;&gt; and ask him for our brother. Will you
[56:05] pray with me this morning?
[56:08] &gt;&gt; We'll just invite the brothers to come.
[56:30] needs to operate
[56:33] before that takes place.
[56:45] Lord Jesus Christ
[56:51] Father Lord Jesus, what an honor and a
[56:53] privilege it is to stand for your word
[56:54] in the day in which we father Lord to
[56:58] see the desire in the heart of a brother
[57:00] that would just recognize the promise
[57:01] that lays there. And Father, let it not
[57:04] lay there dormant, but to claim it as
[57:06] his own. And Father, this morning we
[57:09] stand here united just Lord, not as the
[57:11] elders alone, but as a body of believers
[57:13] here, taking you at your word, Father.
[57:16] And Lord Jesus, we can't bring this to
[57:18] pass. But Father, we know that when we
[57:20] come according to your word, that Lord
[57:22] Jesus, all things are possible. So this
[57:25] morning, Father, according to the
[57:26] profession of our brother's faith, Lord
[57:28] Jesus, according to your word, Father,
[57:31] we pray over our brother, knowing that
[57:33] he has been anointed with oil. And Lord
[57:35] Jesus, that's that according to your
[57:37] word, we commit him into your hands,
[57:40] Father. that Lord Jesus even before the
[57:42] surgeon would go to work on him that
[57:44] Lord perhaps Father you would come by
[57:46] his way even right now this morning Lord
[57:49] Jesus and you would fix the problem and
[57:51] Lord Jesus we know the doctor he can
[57:53] declare that something has already taken
[57:55] place and Father we call upon you to see
[57:58] that today in the name of the Lord Jesus
[58:00] Christ we commit brother William into
[58:03] your hands father we thank you for his
[58:04] testimony Lord sometimes we have to go
[58:07] Lord Jesus the long way around we've got
[58:09] to go through the backside of the
[58:11] desert. But Lord Jesus, if we could just
[58:13] get your spirit within us, Father, we
[58:15] know that all things are possible. So,
[58:17] Father, today we just commit Brother
[58:19] William and all of this need into your
[58:21] hands, Father, according to your word.
[58:24] Oh, Father, we thank you in Jesus
[58:26] Christ's name we pray.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's
[58:37] just sing that chorus one more time as
[58:40] we call upon brother Max to come and
[58:43] just be a conduit to minister this word
[58:46] to us fresh once again. Just like to
[58:48] welcome all of the visitors here today
[58:50] as well. My goodness, I feel like I
[58:53] could preach today, but I certainly
[58:56] thank the Lord for his goodness and his
[58:58] mercy.
[59:00] Holy Spirit,
[59:03] thou art welcome
[59:07] in
[59:09] this place.
[59:12] Holy Spirit,
[59:15] thou art welcome.
[59:40] this place. One more time just

[1:00:23] just sing it to him one more time. Oh,

[1:00:29] Holy
[1:00:30] Spirit,
[1:00:33] above
[1:00:36] me.
[1:00:52] Heat.
[1:00:57] Heat.
[1:01:06] in
[1:01:08] this way.
[1:01:11] Heavenly Father, we just want to say
[1:01:13] thank you once again, Lord. We thank you

[1:03:56] with us this morning and we just want to
[1:03:59] open our hearts to his word. Amen. this
[1:04:01] morning. I
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Tyler 110
[1:04:04] S has been fighting
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; and he's been fighting the whole week,
[1:04:08] but this was just it's been a battle
[1:04:11] just be able to come and and and speak
[1:04:13] and especially for the service this
[1:04:14] morning. It's been a battle. Yesterday I
[1:04:17] felt like this wasn't the direction I
[1:04:20] had to go and and begin to pray and seek
[1:04:23] the face of the Lord and and just begin
[1:04:25] to look at different parts and begin to
[1:04:27] go in different direction. But the Lord
[1:04:29] brought me back again to the the same
[1:04:31] thing again. And and I I don't know what
[1:04:35] the Lord has is doing, but I've had a
[1:04:37] hard time putting the service together.
[1:04:39] And uh even back in the office just
[1:04:41] still struggling with it. But you know,
[1:04:45] when God is fixing to move,
[1:04:48] Satan tried to disturb us.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; He was, man. And so I believe that God
[1:04:53] is fixing to do something this morning.
[1:04:55] And so let's be under expectation. and
[1:04:58] don't look at me. It's not about me this
[1:05:00] morning. It's about him. Let's open our
[1:05:02] hearts to him this morning. Amen.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; As we said yesterday, we do bring
[1:05:06] greetings from Edmonton from my pastor,
[1:05:08] brother Ed. And again, we do appreciate
[1:05:10] the invitation, brother Barry. God bless

[1:06:07] earth, and gross darkness the people,
[1:06:11] but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and
[1:06:14] his glory shall be seen upon thee.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord add his blessing to
[1:06:20] the reason of the word. Amen. We we may
[1:06:22] have a seat. Amen.

[1:06:49] a moment on on the people of the
[1:06:52] symphony.

[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; The people of the symphony. Amen. And
[1:06:58] and again, it's been a struggle, but we
[1:07:00] we trust in the Lord this morning. Amen.

[1:07:29] church to ages. Amen. We know that this
[1:07:31] age is the darkest of it all. Amen. As
[1:07:34] the is the darkest of it all as the
[1:07:36] light begins, you know begin to dim them
[1:07:39] as the ages go by. We come to a place
[1:07:41] where it's very very dark. And but we
[1:07:43] know that in the darkness there is
[1:07:45] something that is powerful than the
[1:07:46] darkness. Amen. And that is the light.
[1:07:49] Amen. No matter how dark a room is,
[1:07:52] amen. When light shines, amen, the
[1:07:54] darkness has to scatter. Amen. Light has
[1:07:57] got a greater power, amen, than the
[1:07:59] darkness. Amen. But but this morning,
[1:08:01] Amen. as we we begin to build on this
[1:08:03] thought. Amen. I I want to bring it
[1:08:05] through. Amen. The the thought of a
[1:08:07] symphony. Amen. If that would be all
[1:08:09] right. Amen. And we just want to take a
[1:08:11] little journey this morning. Amen. As we
[1:08:13] as we look at these scriptures and we
[1:08:15] look at this this portion of the word.
[1:08:17] Amen. You see right from the beginning,
[1:08:20] Amen. or before even time began. Amen. I
[1:08:23] believe that God had a great symphony in
[1:08:26] his mind. Amen. I believe that we are a
[1:08:28] part of a very great symphony. Amen. A
[1:08:32] symphony that began in the mind of God.
[1:08:34] Amen. Of course, God being the composer,
[1:08:38] amen, of this great symphony. Amen. Are
[1:08:40] you with me? He is the composer of this
[1:08:43] great symphony. But we know that a
[1:08:45] symphony cannot be a symphony without
[1:08:48] subjects that are playing in the
[1:08:49] symphony. Amen. For a symphony to be a
[1:08:52] symphony, there has to be people, amen,
[1:08:54] that that are playing in the symphony.
[1:08:56] And so as God, amen, this great
[1:08:58] composer, amen, begin to pan in his
[1:09:01] mind, amen, what he wanted the symphony
[1:09:04] to be, he needed subjects, amen, that
[1:09:07] that will play in this great symphony.
[1:09:09] Amen. A and the subjects that Amen. he
[1:09:12] was going to use in the symphony. Amen.
[1:09:15] We're going to be different type of
[1:09:16] people. Amen. A in the symphony we're
[1:09:18] going to find angels in there. Amen. In
[1:09:21] the symphony we're going to find men in
[1:09:22] there. Amen. And and you know when we
[1:09:24] talk about angels, Amen. Angels of God,
[1:09:27] different ranks of angels. Amen. You
[1:09:29] know how the prophet tell there was an
[1:09:31] angel called warmwood and there's
[1:09:32] Gabriel and and there were angels that
[1:09:34] come to minister strength to people. So
[1:09:36] there are different ranks and each one
[1:09:38] was playing their role. Amen. And and
[1:09:41] among the men, Amen. God will have
[1:09:43] different men. Amen. You'll have
[1:09:44] prophets. Amen. And and you have kings
[1:09:46] and you have judges and and you have
[1:09:48] preachers. You have moms. You'll have
[1:09:50] dads and and you have young people and
[1:09:52] and you have children. You'll have all
[1:09:54] these people. And they're all a part of
[1:09:56] this great symphony. Amen. That is about
[1:09:59] to unfold in the mind of God. And so and
[1:10:01] so God begins, Amen. to to unfold the
[1:10:04] symphony. But I want you to notice that
[1:10:06] the symphony that man there was going to
[1:10:08] be times where a man the symphony was
[1:10:10] going to be a little more quiet. Amen.
[1:10:12] And it almost feels like nothing has
[1:10:14] happened. But there was going to be
[1:10:15] times where the symphony would just
[1:10:17] build up and and it just rise and and
[1:10:19] come to a momentum. Amen. And this was
[1:10:22] all going to be what God was going to
[1:10:24] play out. Amen. And all together, amen,
[1:10:27] with the hoys and the lows. Amen. and
[1:10:30] the quiet moments all together was to
[1:10:32] build and bring forth a beautiful music.
[1:10:35] Amen. It was to bring forth a a
[1:10:38] beautiful symphony, a beautiful
[1:10:40] masterpiece. Amen. That has a great
[1:10:42] harmony. Amen. A a masterpiece. Amen.
[1:10:45] That that had a perfect rhythm, that had
[1:10:47] a perfect melody. Amen. And so God begin
[1:10:50] to materialize, amen, the symphony that
[1:10:53] he had in his mind. Amen. Are you with
[1:10:55] me this morning? He begin to materialize
[1:10:58] the symphony that he had in his morning.
[1:11:00] And the prophet will tell us, amen, that
[1:11:02] the first thing that he must have
[1:11:03] created, amen, were angels. Amen.
[1:11:06] Because he was God. And and for him to
[1:11:09] be God, he needed to be an object of
[1:11:12] worship. That's the meaning of God. He's
[1:11:13] an object of worship. So the first thing
[1:11:15] he created were angels. Amen. And these
[1:11:18] angels begin to play their part and and
[1:11:20] begin to worship him and and to give him
[1:11:22] praise and and that made him God. Amen.
[1:11:25] And among these angels that he created.
[1:11:27] Amen. There was there was one of the
[1:11:29] angels that he made his right hand man.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; And his name was Lucifer.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; And Lucifer was over the in charge of
[1:11:37] the music
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; in the heavenly realms.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was his right hand man. And and
[1:11:45] nowadays, you know, and I I'm just
[1:11:47] dramatizing here and you just bear with
[1:11:49] me. Amen. But but no days, Amen. Lucifer
[1:11:53] was very close to God and and Lucifer
[1:11:56] days he begin to catch the inspiration
[1:11:59] of where the symphony was going.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this evening? I just
[1:12:03] wanted to stay with me. He begin to cast
[1:12:05] the inspiration of of where the symphony
[1:12:07] was going and and as Lucifer begin to
[1:12:10] look at this what God had in his mind
[1:12:12] and begin to cast the inspiration Isaiah
[1:12:15] chapter 14 will begin to tell us amen of
[1:12:18] of how Lucifer's heart something begin
[1:12:20] to rise what Lucifer begin to say well
[1:12:24] this is a beautiful music and almost
[1:12:26] Lucifer begin to have a little bit of
[1:12:28] pride and Lucifer begin to to have a
[1:12:31] little bit of envy and Lucifer begin to
[1:12:34] feel like, oh, I wish I was the
[1:12:36] composer. We feel like, I wish I I was
[1:12:38] the one that was doing this. Amen. Let
[1:12:41] me say this, church. Pride is an evil
[1:12:43] tin. Are you with me this morning? Pride
[1:12:46] is a very evil. Brother Brandon will
[1:12:48] speak a message just entitled pride.
[1:12:51] Amen. Pride will will invoid Jesus and
[1:12:54] let him sit with no defeat. Pride will
[1:12:57] invoid Jesus. Amen. And and give him no
[1:12:59] attention. Amen. Pride will get Jesus to
[1:13:02] a place where he's just an object that
[1:13:04] is looked upon, that is mocked. Amen.
[1:13:06] That is what pride will do. Pride will
[1:13:08] get us to a place, amen, that that we
[1:13:10] have a hard time saying sorry to one
[1:13:12] another. Are you with me this evening?
[1:13:14] This this morning, amen. Pride will get
[1:13:16] us to a place where where we can't even
[1:13:18] be grateful, amen, for what someone does
[1:13:21] for us. We can't be thankful. Pride is
[1:13:23] an evil thing. Pride will keep you away,
[1:13:26] amen, from walking with God. Pride,
[1:13:28] amen, will break relationships. Pride
[1:13:31] will get into your marriage and destroy
[1:13:33] it because you just can't humble
[1:13:35] yourself.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Because you just can't
[1:13:39] humble yourself to say I was wrong.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning? You just
[1:13:44] can't say I am wrong. Pride.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon Mo say give me a church
[1:13:52] that is humble.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; That is sweet, that is not arrogant. And
[1:13:57] he said, "I'll show you a church that
[1:13:58] has favor and power with God."
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; God is looking for humility. He's not
[1:14:07] looking for pride.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Pride will tear down a church.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Pride will devoid a church.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Because we can't humble ourselves. Amen.
[1:14:17] To submit ourselves to the womb that God
[1:14:20] has placed and to be the head of the
[1:14:22] church, to lead the church as a pastor.
[1:14:24] Are you with me this morning? Pride.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Be careful of pride. Be careful of
[1:14:31] whatever you do when you not been driven
[1:14:33] by pride.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; That you've not been driven by envy.
[1:14:37] Because that was what was happening in
[1:14:39] heaven with Lucifer. And I want you to
[1:14:41] realize that this is happening in the
[1:14:44] presence of God. This is happening in
[1:14:46] the most holy place that has ever been
[1:14:49] on the face of the earth.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning? In the
[1:14:53] most holy place with the most holy
[1:14:55] person, with the most holy angels, a
[1:14:58] place where sin has never been before.
[1:15:00] Right there, pride is rising up in the
[1:15:03] heart of someone. Right there, envy is
[1:15:06] rising up in the heart of someone. For
[1:15:08] what purpose? To try to disrupt the plan
[1:15:12] and the purpose of God.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Pride and envy.
[1:15:24] get to the place where you begin to
[1:15:27] compare yourself with one another.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; I wish I was like this.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; I wish I could do this. I wish I was in
[1:15:35] that position.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what Lucifer was was was
[1:15:39] craving for.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; I wish I was in that position.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; I was that I wish that was me.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning?
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; I wish that was me. I I wish that I was
[1:15:51] the one that was in charge of it all.
[1:15:53] And
[1:15:55] but I'm going say this this morning. You
[1:15:57] are exactly where God wants you to be
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; in a symphony.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Don't chase after Renitan.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; He is the composer
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; and you are exactly where he wants you
[1:16:13] to be.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Remember that the music can be low
[1:16:18] sometimes. That's right.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; The music can be hoy sometimes,
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; but it's also part of the symphony.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; You are exactly where God wants you to
[1:16:28] be.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the composer and he's not
[1:16:31] making any mistake.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; And so, let's go back and let's go back
[1:16:37] to the story. So, Lucifer, Amen. and he
[1:16:39] he he's looking and and all these things
[1:16:42] are rising up in his heart and he's
[1:16:44] desiring to to to to to to take this
[1:16:47] role of a composer. But you see, Lucifer
[1:16:51] is not even looking to be equal with
[1:16:54] God.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Lucifer was looking to be greater than
[1:16:58] God.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; That's what praying will do.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Will try to get you to be greater or
[1:17:06] bigger than someone else.
[1:17:09] Lucif Lucifer was looking to be greater
[1:17:12] to get more glory to be more worshiped
[1:17:14] and and all these sort of things. That's
[1:17:16] what was Lucifer was was looking at and
[1:17:18] was desiring. Amen. Amen.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; And you know sometimes these things
[1:17:23] happen that you know
[1:17:26] when we find ourselves you know as
[1:17:28] humans when we find ourselves we come to
[1:17:30] a place amen where we begin to realize
[1:17:34] that maybe God has blessed someone a
[1:17:36] little more than maybe he's blessed us.
[1:17:38] Listen we all not going to be rich
[1:17:40] people. Okay?
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; You know there's going to be some riches
[1:17:45] all part of the symphony.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Okay. But you see sometimes it feels
[1:17:50] that God has blessed someone a little
[1:17:51] more or given them a little more and and
[1:17:53] you know all these tents and and you
[1:17:55] know sometimes it comes to place where
[1:17:58] if we not we find that if if we compare
[1:18:01] ourselves to it but then we come to a
[1:18:04] place where we try to stop that person
[1:18:08] or or we try to get in the way of that
[1:18:10] person
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; or try to do something to belittle that
[1:18:13] person
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; because God has given them a little
[1:18:16] more.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Again, it's all back to pride and
[1:18:20] envy. We try to do these tents, but you
[1:18:23] see that's exactly what Lucifer was
[1:18:25] doing.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; You see, because when he realized
[1:18:28] because Lucifer came to bless, he
[1:18:29] realized I can't compose.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; He I don't have the power to create.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; After all his envy, he realized I am
[1:18:38] limited because I was created.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so now Lucifer because of the
[1:18:44] pride in his heart he decides that okay
[1:18:46] if I can't compose if I can't create
[1:18:50] then I'm going to get in the way of what
[1:18:52] God is doing.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Then I'm going to try to tear down what
[1:18:57] God is doing.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; And you know what happens? Lucifer goes
[1:19:02] out and he begin to witness to some
[1:19:04] angels.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right. He begin to witness
[1:19:09] to some angels and begin to tell these
[1:19:11] angels, "Hey, listen. I've got a great
[1:19:13] plan, guys.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; I'm going to make you guys big."
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; You see, all you guys have been doing is
[1:19:20] worshiping this God. And but I'm telling
[1:19:23] you something. I'm going to make you
[1:19:25] big.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; That this God is going to worship you
[1:19:28] guys.
[1:19:31] You know, sometimes, you know, sad to
[1:19:34] say, but these angels were a little
[1:19:36] maybe a little dumb,
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; cuz I don't know, but you are in heaven.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; You are in the best position you could
[1:19:45] ever be in.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; And the very
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; angel that was created just like you
[1:19:52] were created
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; comes to tell you that I'm going to make
[1:19:55] you greater than the one that created
[1:19:56] you. And you believe in him.
[1:20:02] And that's what sometimes the enemy do
[1:20:04] does among us.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; And so these angels, they cried around
[1:20:10] Lucifer and and they decide that they're
[1:20:12] going to war against Michael
[1:20:16] and his angels.
[1:20:18] And Revelation 12 will tell us about
[1:20:21] this war in heaven. As Lucifer was
[1:20:24] seeking to gain authority and position
[1:20:27] in heaven,
[1:20:28] Revelation 12:78 will tell us that and
[1:20:31] there was war in heaven. Michael and his
[1:20:34] angels fought fought against the dragon
[1:20:37] and the dragon fought and his angels.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; The first war that ever began was in
[1:20:42] heaven.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; The first argument there ever began was
[1:20:46] in heaven.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; The first sin that ever began was in
[1:20:50] heaven. Amen.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; The blessed pride ever began was in
[1:20:54] heaven.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; The blessed envy began was in heaven.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Right in the presence of the Lord.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Do you think that Satan is not going to
[1:21:01] try to do the same thing in the midst of
[1:21:03] you right in this church?
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; He'll try to do the same thing. But the
[1:21:09] scripture says, "And prevailed not
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; and prevailed not."
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Neither was the place found anymore in
[1:21:25] heaven.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Now, you might be sitting here this
[1:21:30] morning and and you feel like, "Oh, that
[1:21:32] was a great battle that happened. It
[1:21:33] happened in heaven." But I just want to
[1:21:35] remind you, amen, that when that battle
[1:21:38] was taking place, you were there.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you were a part of the
[1:21:44] symphony. Amen. When when Lucifer was
[1:21:48] going around and he was convincing the
[1:21:50] angels and try to turn him aside, you
[1:21:53] were hidden in the might of God. Lucifer
[1:21:56] could not get to you because you were
[1:21:59] hidden in the mind of God. You fought
[1:22:01] him and you defeated him over in heaven.
[1:22:05] And let me say this, if Lucifer had no
[1:22:07] place in heaven, then Lucifer has no
[1:22:10] place in you here on earth.
[1:22:14] Amen. Listen, church. Satan is not a
[1:22:18] composer of your life. Satan is not a
[1:22:21] composer of this church. Satan is not a
[1:22:25] composer of your family.
[1:22:30] Satan cannot stop what God has written
[1:22:33] concerning you.
[1:22:37] He's been trying to rob your name of
[1:22:40] that lamb's book of life. He's tried
[1:22:43] everything he can to rub that name off,
[1:22:46] but that name is still there because God
[1:22:49] rubbed that name with his own blood.
[1:22:57] Oh hallelujah.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; If you defeated him then you can defeat
[1:23:01] him now.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; If you had the victory then you can have
[1:23:06] the victory now. He can't stop your
[1:23:09] music
[1:23:12] because it is not your music. It is a
[1:23:15] music that God started before the
[1:23:17] foundation of the world.
[1:23:20] And what God started, he will finish it
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; because he's the author and finisher of
[1:23:26] our fed.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; So, Lucifer loses his water in heaven
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; and he's cast out of heaven
[1:23:47] and he's cast down onto earth.
[1:23:50] But you see,
[1:23:53] spirits don't die.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Natures don't change.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; But Brown will tell us, "Whatever you
[1:24:00] are here, whatever you are name here,
[1:24:03] you're going to be the same thing over
[1:24:04] there."
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Going over there is not going to change.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; What you taking out of here is your
[1:24:13] character.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; And whatever your character is, name is
[1:24:16] what is going to be over there. Amen.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; So, he's cast out of heaven onto earth
[1:24:21] and and he's on earth and and he's he's
[1:24:25] looking and watching as the symphony
[1:24:28] continues to unfold.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; In this perfect garden
[1:24:33] where there's two people, Adam and Eve,
[1:24:36] and this music, God's symphony is
[1:24:39] continuing to unfold them. But his
[1:24:41] purpose has not changed.
[1:24:43] He still wants to get in the mess of the
[1:24:48] symphony and destroy it.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; And so Satan began to to go to Eve,
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; not one time, but maybe two times and
[1:24:58] three times and begins to talk to Eve.
[1:25:02] What was Satan doing? Satan was begin to
[1:25:05] play an uncertain sound.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; A sound that was uncertain.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; A sound that wasn't matching with the
[1:25:12] word. They begin to just speak to to Eve
[1:25:15] and begin to ento Eve and and Eve is
[1:25:18] just listening and listening and
[1:25:20] eventually Eve gives in and and gives
[1:25:23] herself up to it.
[1:25:26] Then once Eve gives himself up to it,
[1:25:28] Satan feels like, "Yes, I couldn't make
[1:25:31] it in heaven, but I'm making it right
[1:25:33] now. I am getting them right now. I'm
[1:25:36] stopping the symphony." And we know
[1:25:39] that, you know, Eve goes back to Adam
[1:25:41] and tells him about this fruit. And we
[1:25:43] know what the fruit is. There's no need
[1:25:44] to go in into West as believers. We
[1:25:47] understand that. Amen. And and he and he
[1:25:50] goes to Adam and and tells Adam. Now,
[1:25:53] Adam has a choice to make.
[1:25:56] Adam can choose to stay with the
[1:25:58] symphony or go with the uncertain sound.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; But we know that Adam is a type of
[1:26:04] Christ.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. that because of love
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; for his bride,
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; he chose to go down the path
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; that looked like it was
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; the wrong path, but he was doing it
[1:26:16] because of love.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; And so Satan, amen, feels like I have
[1:26:20] almost he felt like I've got this.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; The symphony is over. Because he knew
[1:26:26] that the wedges of sin is dead.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; And I knew that if I get them to die
[1:26:31] that is,
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; it's over. What is he going to do?
[1:26:36] But little did Satan know
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; that that was
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; just a junction
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; in the music.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; You know, every symphony has got
[1:26:49] junctions in them.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; That was just a junction in the sheet
[1:26:53] music of the composer. It was a junction
[1:26:57] that the that the composer was going to
[1:26:59] change the beat of the music
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; because now the composer was just not
[1:27:04] going to be a god that was above us but
[1:27:06] the composer was going to move into
[1:27:09] another role where he's going to begin
[1:27:10] to show his attribute as a savior as a
[1:27:14] healer as a deliverer. You see Satan
[1:27:16] thought he had him but all he he didn't
[1:27:19] know that he was actually playing a part
[1:27:21] in the symphony. Oh well glory. He
[1:27:25] actually didn't know that he was just
[1:27:26] making a way for the beat to change. He
[1:27:30] was just making a way for God to step on
[1:27:32] the scene and begin to move in a way.
[1:27:34] Amen. That that that Satan did not could
[1:27:37] not even imagine.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Great.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; And we know as God will will step down
[1:27:44] in flesh and begin to to to manifest
[1:27:47] these tents and show his attribute as a
[1:27:50] healer, as a deliverer. Amen. And we
[1:27:53] know at Calvary he begins to correct the
[1:27:55] errors that has been on the music scene
[1:27:58] and and he begins to do all these tents.
[1:28:00] Amen. And as he's doing these tents,
[1:28:03] Amen. Satan is watching
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; and he's amazed.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; But at the same time, he's not planning
[1:28:11] on giving up.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; He says, "Okay, if this is what it is,
[1:28:19] then I'm going to keep fighting.
[1:28:22] And I'm going to keep fighting with
[1:28:24] every subject that will give their heart
[1:28:26] to the Lord. Let me say this. When you
[1:28:28] surrender your heart to the Lord, you
[1:28:30] become a target to the enemy.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. You become a person that Satan is
[1:28:35] targeting to try to disrupt the symphony
[1:28:38] that God is playing in your life. Well,
[1:28:40] I'm going say this. Don't be
[1:28:42] discouraged. Amen. Don't be discouraged
[1:28:44] because he cannot stop the music. He
[1:28:47] cannot stop the symphony that God is
[1:28:49] playing and unfolding in your life. Many
[1:28:53] things may come your way but remember
[1:28:55] they are just junctions that are coming
[1:28:57] to change the pattern of the music of
[1:29:00] your life.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. The trials that you face. Amen.
[1:29:04] That the moments that you feel like
[1:29:05] you're losing it. Amen. It is just a
[1:29:08] junction in your life where God is
[1:29:10] changing the beat of your music. Where
[1:29:13] God is bringing to you a place of a
[1:29:15] greater reality. is bringing you to a
[1:29:17] place where your character is going to
[1:29:19] be molded, where it's going to be more
[1:29:21] real to you. It is just a junction in
[1:29:24] the seat music. So don't be discouraged.
[1:29:27] Amen. Paul would tell us, amen, that we
[1:29:29] are troubled on every side, but we are
[1:29:31] not distressed. Amen. That we are
[1:29:34] perplexed, but we are not in despair.
[1:29:37] That we are persecuted, but we are not
[1:29:39] forsaken. Amen. That we are cast down,
[1:29:43] but we are not destroyed. Hallelujah. No
[1:29:46] matter what comes our way. Amen. The
[1:29:49] sheet music has to go on. No matter what
[1:29:52] comes our way, we know it is just a
[1:29:54] junction where God is going to show his
[1:29:57] glory.
[1:29:59] It might be a junction of sickness. It's
[1:30:01] because he wants to show his glory as a
[1:30:03] healer.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; It might be a bondage of affliction
[1:30:07] because he wants to show his glory as a
[1:30:10] deliverer.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Don't be discouraged.
[1:30:15] David will tell us that, you know,
[1:30:17] weeping may last for anointing, but joy
[1:30:19] comes in the morning.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Joy comes in the morning.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; And it's just a junction
[1:30:28] in your life.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; There was a man one time in the Bible
[1:30:33] who laid at the pole
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; of Bethesda.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Listen, he was at a junction in his life
[1:30:40] for 28 years. He was low, you know, his
[1:30:43] pull.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; No day he thought, Amen, that that his
[1:30:47] music, his symphony was over.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; He could sit there and he could see the
[1:30:53] angel of the Lord move and deliver and
[1:30:57] set free. And he was just sitting there
[1:31:00] and he's watching this and he wants to
[1:31:02] be delivered. He wants to be set free.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; But it feels like his music just can't
[1:31:07] move on. It feels like it's a moment
[1:31:09] where the symphony has jump just gone
[1:31:11] quiet and nothing is happening. Amen.
[1:31:14] And he's just sitting there and and he's
[1:31:16] just wondering what am I going to do?
[1:31:18] But you see, it was a moment. It was a
[1:31:20] junction in his life where God was going
[1:31:22] to reveal himself to him in a way like
[1:31:24] he never thought before. Listen, God was
[1:31:27] not just going to send an angel his way,
[1:31:29] but he himself was stepping down in
[1:31:32] flesh to come to his address.
[1:31:35] Are you with my amen? You may be in a
[1:31:37] junction, amen, that you've been there
[1:31:39] sitting there for years, more than 28
[1:31:42] years or 20 years. I don't know how many
[1:31:44] years. But let me say this, God is not
[1:31:46] fixing just to send you an angel.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; But he's coming down himself. The
[1:31:52] almighty God, listen, one time there
[1:31:54] were Hebrew boys that was sitting in the
[1:31:56] fiery furnace. Amen. And listen, there
[1:31:58] were angels that offered to come down.
[1:32:01] Warmwood said, "Let me go." Gabriel
[1:32:03] said, "Let me go." But God said, "I
[1:32:05] won't let you go because this is my
[1:32:07] business. This is my child. This is my
[1:32:10] daughter. I am going myself."
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; It was just a junction. Amen. That God
[1:32:17] was going to reveal himself to you.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; oh hallelujah.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Just a junction.
[1:32:29] And the angel came and touched them.
[1:32:33] And the angel asked him, "What?" Not the
[1:32:37] angel, sorry. Jesus came and and asked
[1:32:40] him, "What? Will thou be made whole?
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Will they be made whole?" But you see,
[1:32:48] this man had been in this junction for
[1:32:50] so long.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? He's been in this
[1:32:53] junction for so long that he begin to
[1:32:55] find excuses.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Jesus was there asking him,
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; "Will you be made whole?
[1:33:02] this very moment you want to be made
[1:33:04] whole but you begin to make excuses but
[1:33:07] you see I've been here for many years
[1:33:08] and and I've seen the angel come and
[1:33:10] I've seen him heal that person deliver
[1:33:12] that person and I want to be delivered
[1:33:14] but I've been sitting here nobody's
[1:33:16] helping me
[1:33:17] and Jesus is saying but will you be made
[1:33:19] whole
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; listen we can be sitting in our
[1:33:22] condition complaining and complaining
[1:33:24] listen I've been here for years and I've
[1:33:26] been going through this for years and
[1:33:28] you don't know how painful it is and you
[1:33:30] don't know how hurtful it And you don't
[1:33:32] know how I've been discouraged. And
[1:33:34] Jesus is right in the service saying,
[1:33:36] "Will you be made whole? I'm coming to
[1:33:39] your junction. I am here right now. Will
[1:33:41] you be made whole?" Well, you can sit
[1:33:44] down and complain.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; You see, will you be made whole?
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; You can just arise and let your light
[1:33:57] shine.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Though it's like a gross
[1:34:01] darkness upon you,
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; but you can arise and let your light
[1:34:05] shine.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; You know in the symphony, amen,
[1:34:08] everybody playing their part and and
[1:34:10] sometime they're all playing together,
[1:34:12] but there is a moment, amen, sometime
[1:34:14] that there's one person that just stands
[1:34:16] out. Are you with me? And they begin to
[1:34:18] play a solo or begin to play a certain
[1:34:20] part where the other people are just
[1:34:22] quiet. You know, sometimes God is just
[1:34:24] wanting to call you to a place where he
[1:34:26] just want to invite you to play a solo.
[1:34:29] Amen. I just want to invite you to play
[1:34:31] a solo. He's moving. Amen. Among the
[1:34:33] congregation, but maybe he's just coming
[1:34:35] to your address just like he came to
[1:34:37] that woman who was sitting in the pool
[1:34:39] and sir, I just want you to play a solo.
[1:34:41] This is your moment. Amen. This is your
[1:34:44] moment. Pick up your instrument and
[1:34:46] begin to play your part. Arise and begin
[1:34:49] to shine. Amen. You've been in the
[1:34:51] darkness for so long, but this is your
[1:34:53] moment. Amen. Don't let it pass you,
[1:34:55] boy. It is part of the symphony.
[1:35:00] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; It is part of the symphony.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you might get low and
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; might get slow but he's still there.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; He is the light.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; What is that light? It is the vindicated
[1:35:20] word for our day.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; That is what that light is.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; That is the light that has risen in this
[1:35:26] day. Amen. Brother Brham said he said,
[1:35:28] "I am the light of the world." Amen.
[1:35:31] That's right. The same yesterday, today,
[1:35:33] and forever. And he's still the light of
[1:35:35] the world. He said, "And what is he?" In
[1:35:38] the beginning was the word, and the word
[1:35:39] was with God. Why was he the light of
[1:35:42] the world? Is that if he had come and
[1:35:44] said, "I am the Messiah." And he didn't
[1:35:46] did and he didn't do like the Bible said
[1:35:48] the Messiah will do, then he wasn't the
[1:35:51] light of the world. See, it's a
[1:35:53] vindicated word that makes it the Lloyd
[1:35:55] of the world.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "And in this hour
[1:35:59] that we are living in name, it's a
[1:36:01] vindicated word of this hour." He said,
[1:36:03] "Pentecostals, you say speaking in
[1:36:06] tongues and so forth." He said, "That
[1:36:08] was the day of Pentecost." He said,
[1:36:10] "That was the delight of the hour." Then
[1:36:13] see this is another day. Here is the
[1:36:16] light of the hour today. Here
[1:36:21] is the light of the hour today. What is
[1:36:24] it? Is the vindicated word of God for us
[1:36:27] in this day. That is the Lloyd for today
[1:36:30] for our day. This is the Lloyd that he's
[1:36:32] calling you to stand up and shine.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is your moment. Amen. In the
[1:36:38] symphony that he's saying it is your
[1:36:40] time for you to arise and begin to shine
[1:36:43] the light of your day. Amen.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; He continues to say the seven church age
[1:36:55] all smith with Christ on the outside is
[1:36:58] said the moon and identify in it all the
[1:37:00] darkness coming upon the earth. It said
[1:37:03] the light is present in now begin to
[1:37:07] show what is going to take place. He
[1:37:10] said the tin will be destroyed. Talking
[1:37:12] about the darkness. The 10 will be
[1:37:13] destroyed and the loit will come in and
[1:37:16] destroy it. And it said and the saint
[1:37:18] shall inherit the earth. The meek shall
[1:37:21] inherit the earth. Amen. He said the
[1:37:23] earth the moon the moon darkness will be
[1:37:26] took away. He said the darkness of the
[1:37:28] night will pass away. He said the
[1:37:30] darkness with your dead creeds. Amen.
[1:37:33] And away with the world of God perverted
[1:37:35] things that they that they are saying.
[1:37:37] It said and the light will break forth
[1:37:39] upon the day.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is that day
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; for the Lord to break forth. This is
[1:37:47] that day in the symphony for this boy to
[1:37:49] rise up to what she's called to be. What
[1:37:52] is she called to be? The Lord of the
[1:37:55] hour. Amen. She's called to be the
[1:37:57] continuation of the symphony that began
[1:38:00] in heaven.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. She's called to finish the part of
[1:38:05] the symphony that that has been given to
[1:38:07] her. Amen. Let me say this, church. As
[1:38:10] we as we were speaking about, Amen.
[1:38:11] Lucifer trying to stop this stop the
[1:38:14] symphony from going forward. Let me say
[1:38:16] this. There's been different exoduses.
[1:38:18] Amen. That Satan has been trying to stop
[1:38:21] God's people from moving forward.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's been trying to stop the Lloyd
[1:38:26] of that day. Amen. You remember one time
[1:38:28] was Pharaoh that rose up against the
[1:38:31] forest exodus.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; He was trying, Amen. to get get in the
[1:38:35] midst of that symphony to stop the
[1:38:37] children of Israel from getting to the
[1:38:39] promised land. But let me say this,
[1:38:41] Pharaoh was not successful because there
[1:38:44] was a light that went before them. Amen.
[1:38:46] There was a pillar of fire that went
[1:38:48] before them. Amen. Listen, when they
[1:38:51] came to the crossroad of the Red Sea and
[1:38:53] they didn't know where to go, it was a
[1:38:55] junction in the walk. Amen. At that
[1:38:58] junction, they wondered where are we
[1:38:59] going? Here is the Red Sea before us.
[1:39:02] Here is Pharaoh and his army behind us.
[1:39:04] Where are we going to do? But you know
[1:39:06] what happened? The light of that day,
[1:39:09] that pillar of fire that followed them,
[1:39:11] made a way in the midst of the Red Sea.
[1:39:14] Are you with me this evening? What was
[1:39:16] happening? The light of their day was
[1:39:18] shining in their dare, making a way for
[1:39:21] them to move forward.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was their season. It was their
[1:39:26] time to play their part in the symphony
[1:39:29] that God had called them to play in.
[1:39:31] Amen.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; And the Red Sea open and they were led
[1:39:35] by a prophet.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; They were led by a prophet in the first
[1:39:41] Exodus with a vindicated word with a
[1:39:44] pillar of fire. Amen. And they succeeded
[1:39:47] in their portion of playing their part
[1:39:49] of the symphony.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Years go by, thousands of years go by or
[1:39:54] hundreds of years go by and here comes
[1:39:56] another Exodus, the second exodus. Amen.
[1:40:00] And here they are in the upper room, a
[1:40:02] fearful people. They're at a great
[1:40:03] junction. Amen. Christ has come. The
[1:40:06] Holy Ghost has been promised to them.
[1:40:08] And here they are in this upper room, a
[1:40:09] fearful people. It's a moment where God
[1:40:12] is bringing a church out of a people.
[1:40:14] Bringing a church out of a nation. Amen.
[1:40:17] And what happens again? The same pillar
[1:40:19] of fire appears in that operon.
[1:40:22] Amen. In a form of a tongue of fire.
[1:40:25] What was it? It was the Lloyd for their
[1:40:27] death that it was the moment for them to
[1:40:29] shine their light in their moment to
[1:40:32] play their part in their symphony.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; And the scribes and the Pharisees and
[1:40:39] all the people there could not stop them
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; because it was their moment.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Are you following me?
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Pharaoh couldn't stop the first Exodus.
[1:40:48] The Pharisees couldn't Pharaoh couldn't
[1:40:50] stop the first Exodus. The Pharisees
[1:40:52] couldn't stop the second exodus. We are
[1:40:55] in the third exodus.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in the third exodus, we have
[1:41:00] also received the prophet for is there.
[1:41:03] We have received the pillar of fire for
[1:41:04] is there. There is a light that is
[1:41:06] shining in this day to move this bride
[1:41:09] forward to her inheritance. Are you with
[1:41:11] me this evening? Listen, brother Brandon
[1:41:13] will say that 200,000 ten demons has
[1:41:17] been released in this age, but they
[1:41:19] don't have enough power to stop this
[1:41:21] exodus. If they couldn't stop the first
[1:41:23] exodus, if they couldn't stop the second
[1:41:25] exodus, they can't stop the third
[1:41:27] exodus. You are in the third exodus.
[1:41:30] This is your season. Listen, the pillar
[1:41:33] of fire.
[1:41:35] The pillar of fire is just not in a
[1:41:37] picture.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire is not in the is not
[1:41:42] in Washington in the white house.
[1:41:45] Amen.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; If you think the pillar of fire is just
[1:41:48] a picture, you are missing it. Because
[1:41:51] the pillar of fire is more than a
[1:41:53] picture, I'm telling you that fire has
[1:41:56] moved from the picture into a people to
[1:41:59] be the light of day.
[1:42:03] Oh hallelujah.
[1:42:05] Oh hallelujah.
[1:42:07] It's not a picture. It's a reality. It's
[1:42:10] a person. It's the same Lord Jesus. Oh
[1:42:14] hallelujah. The same one that met Paul
[1:42:17] is the same one that is here today in
[1:42:20] you and in me.
[1:42:23] The angel hasn't left. He is still here.
[1:42:27] The music did not stop when the prophet
[1:42:30] went off the scene. It was just a
[1:42:32] change. Oh, hallelujah. It was just a
[1:42:35] change. The music was just changing.
[1:42:39] Amen. The pace was just changing.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:44] G
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; to continue on the symphony.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; And you and me.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; To continue on the symphony.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; And you and me.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; You see John, John the Revelator,
[1:43:02] he was on his island of Patmas. Now we
[1:43:04] know that John is a type of the bride.
[1:43:07] You with me? Amen.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; He's a type of the bride and and he's on
[1:43:12] this island of Patmos.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and these the these
[1:43:16] Pharisees or these Jewish people, they
[1:43:18] thought that, you know, we we will try
[1:43:21] to tried everything to to stop John. You
[1:43:24] remember they they boiled John in in a
[1:43:26] in a boiling oil to to try to stop him.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; And they said that he got a he got
[1:43:32] witchcraft or he got a devil because
[1:43:34] even that couldn't stop him. And so they
[1:43:36] just threw him on this island of Patmos
[1:43:38] to to just put him away and just let him
[1:43:41] die on this island of Patmos. You know,
[1:43:43] sometimes
[1:43:45] you might feel like you in a position or
[1:43:47] in a place where it just feels like it's
[1:43:49] just dry and just nothing is happening.
[1:43:51] Amen. And it feels like a man nothing is
[1:43:55] happening and things didn't seem not to
[1:43:56] be moving forward. But but you see while
[1:43:58] John is on this island on the Patmos,
[1:44:00] remember he's a type of the bride.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. He he he breaks into a vision.
[1:44:06] Are you with me? He breaks into a
[1:44:08] vision. And as he breaks into a vision,
[1:44:10] amen, he he begin to see, amen, all
[1:44:12] these characteristics of God. And God
[1:44:15] begins to speak to him. Amen. Listen, it
[1:44:19] was a junction in John's life, amen,
[1:44:21] where it felt like everything was over,
[1:44:23] but it was just a change of the beat. It
[1:44:26] was just a change of the beat. Are you
[1:44:28] with me this morning? The the beat was
[1:44:30] just changed. And I want you to notice
[1:44:32] that John is standing on this island.
[1:44:34] And in Revelation chapter 4, you know,
[1:44:37] he hears a voice that tells him, "Come
[1:44:39] on."
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Come up higher, John.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; There are things I want to show you. And
[1:44:44] and you could imagine John rises up in
[1:44:46] this vision and and John here he is and
[1:44:49] he's looking and and it says that
[1:44:51] there's a throne and there's one person
[1:44:53] sitting on it and and begin to describe
[1:44:55] the the scenery of of Jasper and and the
[1:44:58] continents of the one sitting on it, the
[1:45:00] rainbow around him and all these things.
[1:45:02] But then but then there's another part
[1:45:04] that John begin to see. He begin to see
[1:45:07] 24 thrones.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Now remember John is in a vision. Amen.
[1:45:12] And John is in theory on earth. Amen.
[1:45:15] And he's at a junction in his life, but
[1:45:17] he sees a vision of 24 thrones. And
[1:45:19] another day John maybe looks and say,
[1:45:21] "Yes, I can remember. It does look like
[1:45:23] maybe probably the the patriarchs, you
[1:45:26] know, that the the children of Israel
[1:45:28] and each one of them Reuben, I can see
[1:45:30] them all sitting over there." And and
[1:45:32] maybe he looks on the other side and but
[1:45:34] that is Peter sitting there.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Looks but that is Bert Leo sitting
[1:45:39] there. and looks but that is Andrew
[1:45:41] sitting there and looks and said but
[1:45:43] that is jam sitting there and and that
[1:45:46] is small jams and that is big jams and
[1:45:49] and then he looks but he said but wait a
[1:45:50] minute but that is me sitting there
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; that is me sitting there
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; at the junction where it felt like
[1:46:00] everything was over he breaks into a
[1:46:03] vision and he begin to look and though
[1:46:06] he's on earth oh hallelujah
[1:46:09] Though John is on earth, though his
[1:46:12] bride is on earth, but he begin to look
[1:46:15] in a vision and begin to see himself
[1:46:18] sitting on a throne with a crown upon
[1:46:20] his head. Oh, let me say this church. We
[1:46:24] may be on here on earth and we going
[1:46:26] through junctions in our life, but there
[1:46:29] is a vision that we can begin to look
[1:46:31] into. Brother Brennham said, if you want
[1:46:33] to see a vision, just open your Bible.
[1:46:36] There is a vision that you can begin to
[1:46:38] look into. And when you see this vision,
[1:46:41] all that you're going to see is yourself
[1:46:44] in the vision. Let me say this, church.
[1:46:46] It is not that you are going to make it.
[1:46:48] You've already made it.
[1:46:52] You've already made it. Your name is
[1:46:55] already there. Brother Brandon will say
[1:46:58] that the table is already set. The
[1:47:00] church are already there. Your name is
[1:47:03] already there. It's the angels already.
[1:47:05] They've shined their trumpets. They've
[1:47:07] got everything ready. Amen. Why? Because
[1:47:10] the symphony is about to change beat.
[1:47:13] The symphony is about to move into
[1:47:16] another realm, into another dimension.
[1:47:18] Amen. And you can look in the vision and
[1:47:21] you can see yourself in the vision,
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; being seated already in heavenly places
[1:47:28] in Christ Jesus. The scripture tells us,
[1:47:32] "Ye are the light of the world, a city
[1:47:35] that is set on a hill that cannot be
[1:47:37] hid."
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Is it need a man light a candle and put
[1:47:40] it under a bushel, but on a candlestick,
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; and it giveth light unto all that are in
[1:47:47] the house? Is that let your light so
[1:47:49] shine before men that ye may see that
[1:47:52] they may see your good works and glorify
[1:47:56] your father which is in heaven. We are
[1:47:58] not here to show to to hide away our
[1:48:01] light. We are here to shine our light.
[1:48:04] This is our season. He's saying this is
[1:48:05] your part of the symphony. This is your
[1:48:08] time to play your part of the symphony.
[1:48:10] What are you called to play? Play the
[1:48:12] word. What are you called to play?
[1:48:13] Believe what the word says. Obey you and
[1:48:15] manifest it.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let the word, Amen, have the
[1:48:20] preeminence in you. That's what brother
[1:48:22] Brandham said. The season we are in is
[1:48:24] the season where the word is to have
[1:48:25] preeminence in the bride to shine your
[1:48:28] light. Listen, we are not Saul that is
[1:48:31] hiding away.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; We're not Saul that is hiding away when
[1:48:36] Goliath showed up.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; When when the music got a little a
[1:48:43] little shaky
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; and Paul run away, it's all run away. He
[1:48:48] went to Hoy. He was the one that was fit
[1:48:51] to do the work.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Listen, there are many great men in this
[1:48:54] world, but God has chosen you, this
[1:48:57] little bride, just little David. Listen,
[1:49:01] you have been anointed to face the
[1:49:02] Goliath that you will face. It is your
[1:49:04] season. It is your hour. The anointing
[1:49:07] is already upon you. You can't do
[1:49:09] anything about it. Listen, David did not
[1:49:11] choose to be a king. Oh, come on,
[1:49:14] church. You did not choose to be called
[1:49:16] bride. You did not choose to be called a
[1:49:18] message believer. But someone chose you.
[1:49:21] Oh wow. Glory. I said someone chose you.
[1:49:24] Amen. And when he chose you, he sent you
[1:49:27] a prophet. Glory. He sent a prophet to
[1:49:32] your address to bring a word that will
[1:49:35] anoint you to defeat any Goliath that
[1:49:38] will come your way.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Listen church. Satan is not fighting
[1:49:45] you. He is fighting against prophecy.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:50] He is pointing against prophecy. You
[1:49:52] were prophesied to be here.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; You were prophesied to defeat the enemy.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; And Satan is not fighting you, but he's
[1:50:04] fighting prophecy. He's fighting the
[1:50:06] anointing that is upon you.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; It is your season.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; To arise and shine. Amen.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah,
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Goliath, let him make his post, but
[1:50:22] don't be afraid.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Choose calmly with sincerity, with
[1:50:28] humility. Begin to pick up your stones.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; You don't have to show off. You don't
[1:50:35] have to do any big things. Just begin to
[1:50:38] pick up your stone. Let him go ahead and
[1:50:40] do his post. Whether he be sickness,
[1:50:43] whether he be depression, whether he be
[1:50:45] anxiety, let him go ahead and do his
[1:50:47] pose. You just pick up your stones
[1:50:50] because the anointing is upon you.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; It is time for you to rise and shine.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; That is your moment in the symphony.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Remember that the scripture said that
[1:51:04] there is no weapon
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; that is formed against you
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; that shall prosper.
[1:51:12] Now when it says no weapon, it means no
[1:51:15] weapon.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Whatever it is, even if it is an atomic
[1:51:21] bomb, brother Brandham said before one
[1:51:24] bomb drop, we are going to be head off.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; No weapon formed against you shall
[1:51:31] prosper.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; Because prophecy said you are fixing for
[1:51:37] a rapture. Amen.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; We are in a moment where the symphony is
[1:51:42] changing again.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; We are in the cycle of the rapture. The
[1:51:48] symphony is changing again. The beat is
[1:51:51] changing again. What is happening?
[1:51:54] Christ, the bridegroom is coming to take
[1:51:57] away his bride. As a matter of fact, the
[1:51:59] bridegroom is already here.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. He's already anointed.
[1:52:05] Amen. The marriage take place here.
[1:52:07] Amen.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said the marriage of the lamb
[1:52:10] has come
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; and his wife has made herself ready.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; The message has come to bring us into a
[1:52:22] relationship into a union into a
[1:52:25] marriage with Christ. We are just
[1:52:27] heading a to the wedding and supper
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; but the anointing time is here.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said it's already
[1:52:34] slipped on your finger. your merited
[1:52:36] wedding and band of grace. It's already
[1:52:39] on your finger. You are already married.
[1:52:42] You can't get married to anyone else on
[1:52:44] the face of the earth. There's no demon
[1:52:47] that can get married to you. You are
[1:52:49] already married. Not just married or
[1:52:52] pregnant and not just pregnantated. You
[1:52:55] are bearing for the fruit of the one
[1:52:58] that pregnant you. What is it? It is the
[1:53:01] word being made manifest in your life.
[1:53:11] Hallelujah.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; No weapon
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; formed against you
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; shall prosper.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; And any tongue that will rise up against
[1:53:20] you in judgment you will condemn it.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; Do you know why? Because you'll be
[1:53:30] sitting on the throne judging the people
[1:53:34] with the can. You are not going to be
[1:53:37] judged. You will be judging. There will
[1:53:39] be no tongue that will be able to rise
[1:53:42] up against you.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; The beat is changing.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; The beat is changing. Oh hallelujah.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Rise and join for your light has come.
[1:53:59] This is your inheritance.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; This is your promise.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "God has moved
[1:54:10] down through the time of history with
[1:54:13] his promised word in each age
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; and has never failed."
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; To break the rhythm
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; by the power of God.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; When it come to the elected and
[1:54:26] vindicated people,
[1:54:30] is that the rhythm of his word
[1:54:33] and the death of nowhere. The rhythm of
[1:54:36] his word and the deaths of nowhere and
[1:54:37] the deaths of Moses and the days of
[1:54:39] Elijah and the death of John and the
[1:54:41] death of David and the death of Jesus on
[1:54:43] down. He keeps the rhythm of the word
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; right on down. Never has broke it. He
[1:54:51] said he has come right down through
[1:54:54] history and the elected seed that seen
[1:54:57] it and believe it fall right into that
[1:55:01] rhythm with it.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; He said the other said, well, but the
[1:55:05] church says that has got nothing to do
[1:55:08] with it.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; You are not born to do that.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; You are not born to be questioning what
[1:55:14] the that and no, you are not born to do
[1:55:16] that. You just fall in line with the
[1:55:19] rhythm of the word. Amen.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; You punctuate every word with an amen.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; That is what the bride is called to do.
[1:55:26] Punctuate every word with an amen.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; He said you are born into the word.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; For you are born into Christ.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Christ is the word. Yes, sir. Each one
[1:55:40] in its age.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I I'll just tell you,
[1:55:43] brother Brennan, I can't look ahead." He
[1:55:46] said, "Then look up."
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:49] Amen.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Tell look up. God promised.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; If you look up, see him, shalom, peace,
[1:55:57] God peace rest upon you.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; You can't look ahead, look up.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; You can't look ahead, look up. You know,
[1:56:08] one time there was a prophet. Amen. The
[1:56:10] prophet Elijah. Amen. And and you know,
[1:56:13] he's gone ahead and he's been on Mount
[1:56:14] Carmel and he's he's had a showdown.
[1:56:16] He's destroyed all these these gods of
[1:56:18] Baal and and done all these things and
[1:56:20] we know there's been a drought in the
[1:56:22] land and you know there come a time
[1:56:24] where he tells Ahab listen there's going
[1:56:27] to rain is going to come. Amen. He tells
[1:56:30] him rain is coming and and he goes and
[1:56:33] and he says that he he put his face in
[1:56:35] between his legs and he begins to pray
[1:56:38] because rain is is to come. Amen. And as
[1:56:41] he's beginning to pray and he's praying
[1:56:43] there is a servant that he sends out. Oh
[1:56:46] hallelujah. Oh glory. There's a servant
[1:56:48] that he sends out. Amen. To look not
[1:56:52] look ahead but look up.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. He sends him to look up. Because
[1:56:58] if he looks ahead all that he's going to
[1:57:00] see is a dry land. If he looks ahead all
[1:57:03] he's going to see is a barren land. But
[1:57:05] he said look up from where the promise
[1:57:07] is coming to make that dry land and a
[1:57:10] fruitful land again. Are you with me?
[1:57:13] And so the servant goes out the first
[1:57:15] time. And if you allow me to maybe just
[1:57:18] just type this just a little bit. Amen.
[1:57:20] I hope you're okay with me dramatizing a
[1:57:22] little bit. But you see, the servant
[1:57:25] goes out the first time. And you know,
[1:57:27] if we can bring it into a type, it's
[1:57:29] like when Paul went out the first time.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; Just stay with me. Listen. He went out
[1:57:35] the first time and he looked up and he
[1:57:37] saw nothing.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; But listen, the promise was sure. That's
[1:57:42] right.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; The promise was sure. It was going to
[1:57:46] come. Something was moving. The rhythm,
[1:57:49] the symphony was still moving on. Paul
[1:57:52] didn't do anything wrong. He just went
[1:57:54] to look and it looked like there was
[1:57:56] nothing yet. And then Ianous came around
[1:58:00] and he went to look and it felt like
[1:58:03] there was nothing still. And then Martin
[1:58:06] came around and he also went to look and
[1:58:10] it looks like the skies were still the
[1:58:12] same persecution of the church and and
[1:58:16] all these things happening. Are you with
[1:58:19] me? And then Columbus went to look
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; and he went to look and also still
[1:58:25] persecution and and different things
[1:58:27] happening and the luther also went out
[1:58:31] and he also begin to look.
[1:58:34] They begin to look and
[1:58:36] it was good but still it felt like
[1:58:38] nothing was happening.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; And then Wesley also came and he also
[1:58:44] went to look and Wesley looked and now
[1:58:48] is the sixth time.
[1:58:51] Now you know the story I'm talking
[1:58:52] about.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; Now is the sixth time that the servant
[1:58:56] has gone out and he has looked
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; and there's no cloud. But the promise is
[1:59:03] there is coming a rain.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; The symphony is there is coming a build
[1:59:08] up.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; According to the music she seat
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; there is coming a build up in the
[1:59:14] symphony. But you're all looking for
[1:59:16] this build up. Now now remember Paul if
[1:59:19] you read his letters Paul will say that
[1:59:21] the coming of the Lord is at hand.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? What was it? He was
[1:59:25] looking.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; He was looking. He knew that the promise
[1:59:29] was near. Amen.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. But but in a season the coming of
[1:59:33] the Lord didn't fully happen then. Are
[1:59:35] you with me?
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; No doubt Iranius did the same. No doubt
[1:59:40] Martin did the same. No doubt Columbus
[1:59:42] did the same. Now I'm talking about the
[1:59:44] messengers of the church ages.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; No doubt Lut did the same. And Wesler
[1:59:48] did the same. But oh church,
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; at the seventh time,
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; when the servant went out at the seventh
[2:00:00] time,
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; oh hallelujah.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; Everybody had that went out looking for
[2:00:05] the promise of his coming. But when the
[2:00:08] servant went out at the seventh time, he
[2:00:11] saw a cloud.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; Oh well, glory. He saw a cloud that was
[2:00:18] 20 miles high and 27 miles across. Oh,
[2:00:22] hallelujah.
[2:00:25] And when he saw that cloud, a voice
[2:00:28] spoke to him and said, "Go back east.
[2:00:32] Go back east because there is coming an
[2:00:35] abundance of rain."
[2:00:38] The promise that you've been looking at
[2:00:41] is here. And he said, "Go back east
[2:00:45] because the rain is coming." And when he
[2:00:47] went back east, what did he do? He begin
[2:00:50] to break the seals upon your life and
[2:00:53] begin to show you that you were always
[2:00:55] there. That you were always in his mind.
[2:00:58] That you came from God and you are going
[2:01:00] back to God. That you cannot fail. Oh,
[2:01:04] hallelujah. That you are justified like
[2:01:07] you never did it in the first place.
[2:01:09] What was he doing? He was telling you
[2:01:12] that he is here.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; It is the season of the abundance of
[2:01:19] rain. The music is changing. The
[2:01:23] symphony is changing. The beat is
[2:01:26] changing. And he's calling you to say,
[2:01:29] "Arise and shine for your light has
[2:01:33] come."
[2:01:39] Your light has come.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; It is your season, church. It is your
[2:01:46] hour, church. It is time to arise. No
[2:01:50] matter what your symphony has been, it
[2:01:52] is your hour name. It is your season
[2:01:55] now. There is gross darkness. But in the
[2:01:58] middle of the darkness, there is a light
[2:02:00] that is showing them because Satan
[2:02:03] cannot stop the music.
[2:02:08] Hallelujah.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; He can't stop your symphony.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; God started it and God will finish it.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; There are not enough demons in hell that
[2:02:20] can stop you this morning.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; Mal about a cousin girl
[2:02:30] that was working on a ranch
[2:02:33] and she was playing her music. He was
[2:02:35] playing a part of a symphony and I am
[2:02:37] closing.
[2:02:39] She was playing a part of the symphony
[2:02:41] and and you know she's been there and
[2:02:44] you know they not been treating her very
[2:02:45] well. How many in the room knows that
[2:02:47] story?
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; They have not been treating her very
[2:02:50] well and
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; you know they they get her to just wash
[2:02:53] the dishes and and do the dirty work.
[2:02:56] You see, she was their cousin because
[2:02:58] her dad has passed away and so her
[2:03:01] parents were gone and so she's gone to
[2:03:02] live with with her uncle and her uncle
[2:03:05] had children. Amen. And now these
[2:03:07] children of her uncle were not treating
[2:03:09] her good.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; They were giving her all the hard work
[2:03:12] and and doing all these things and well
[2:03:15] you see no matter what was happening she
[2:03:19] kept on doing her part.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; She kept on doing her part. Though it
[2:03:26] was hard, but she kept on doing her
[2:03:28] part. Are you with me? Listen. Though it
[2:03:30] might be hard, but you just keep on
[2:03:32] doing your part. Brother Brandham said,
[2:03:34] "If you want to draw closer to God, do
[2:03:35] what? Pray and read your Bible every
[2:03:38] day. Just keep doing your part. Do it as
[2:03:41] hard trials. Just keep doing your part."
[2:03:44] She just kept doing her part and just
[2:03:46] walking away. But in the meantime, the
[2:03:49] owner of this ranch in Chicago, his son
[2:03:51] was looking for a wife. Amen. And he had
[2:03:54] a baby. these girls are leaving on that
[2:03:56] taking care of the ranch over there. And
[2:03:57] so and so he flies down over there and
[2:04:00] go there to to to kind of see if there's
[2:04:02] anyone there that that will kind of fit
[2:04:04] for him. Amen. And and and he and and he
[2:04:07] goes there and and all these cousin
[2:04:09] girls hear that he's coming and oh, they
[2:04:12] begin to dress up.
[2:04:14] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; They begin to dress up.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, they got the high heels going and
[2:04:20] boy, they got the makeup going. Oh, come
[2:04:23] on, church. You know, in name of days,
[2:04:24] we don't preach obey those terms
[2:04:26] anymore. Well, let me say this. You be
[2:04:28] careful of that spirit. Listen, I'm
[2:04:31] trying to close. Don't blame me. These
[2:04:33] are all extras that are coming. Okay?
[2:04:35] So, so, so don't blame me anymore
[2:04:37] because I'm done. But listen, we don't
[2:04:40] preach obey those things anymore. Be
[2:04:41] careful of that spirit. Be careful of
[2:04:43] that makeup spirit. Amen. Because when
[2:04:46] when he came, he wasn't interested in
[2:04:47] the makeup people. He wasn't interested
[2:04:49] in the high heels people. You know,
[2:04:51] nowadays, it's going to rain on a
[2:04:52] message. And I'm just going to say it.
[2:04:54] You know, they've got this new polish
[2:04:55] thing going on on your nails. Oh, come
[2:04:58] on now.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; They've got this new polish thing going
[2:05:00] on on your nails. You know, Satan, he's
[2:05:03] very he's very smart. Oh, come on now.
[2:05:06] He knows that you're not going to put on
[2:05:07] the red one or you're not going to put
[2:05:09] on the black one or you're not going to
[2:05:11] put on the pink one. So, you know what
[2:05:13] he did? He gave you a colorless one.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh-huh.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; The colorless one is made by the same
[2:05:22] chemicals but just without the color.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; It is the same spirit behind it.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church. And he tells you,
[2:05:31] go ahead and, you know, just pretty away
[2:05:33] your nails. Oh, glory be to God. Oh,
[2:05:36] boy.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; Go ahead and pretty on your nails and
[2:05:41] and pretty on your face. Put on some
[2:05:43] mascara on. Oh, come on now. Go ahead
[2:05:46] and put on them skirt that has got a
[2:05:48] split and thin over there.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; Go ahead and dress on that way. It is a
[2:05:53] spirit.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; It is an evil spirit
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; that will try to come upon you to get
[2:06:01] you to a place where people begin to
[2:06:02] lust after you.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; You know nowadays these preaching are
[2:06:07] not famous in the pulpits anymore.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; But you know the prophet preached
[2:06:11] against these things.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; And we don't have to lie those things in
[2:06:15] our midst.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; We don't have to lay those things as
[2:06:18] young people.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; We don't have to lay those things in our
[2:06:20] homes.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; Because it is a spirit. That's right.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; It gets you to put on all these things
[2:06:28] on and and put on all these lip gloss
[2:06:31] and oh boy, know some people you see and
[2:06:35] message believing people, you know, the
[2:06:37] lips are shining more than the sun is
[2:06:39] shining.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; Come on. E.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:49] church.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying don't put on those tins
[2:06:52] because it's dry over here and you need
[2:06:54] them and fine we get but don't make it a
[2:06:57] a big 10.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; Don't make a name the t that stands out
[2:07:01] the first one that everybody sees when
[2:07:03] they see you.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; What is your motive behind it?
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; What is your motive behind it? Listen, I
[2:07:12] use this one here.
[2:07:16] You can buy them from the dollar store.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; It's okay to use them, but don't make it
[2:07:25] a big 10.
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; But you see these girls, they just got
[2:07:28] into dressing up and getting ready to
[2:07:31] meet him.
[2:07:32] And he comes and they throw up this
[2:07:34] party and they dancing away and doing
[2:07:36] whatever they're doing. But he just gets
[2:07:38] sick of it
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; and he walks away as you begin to walk
[2:07:44] away. Begin to hear someone just
[2:07:46] humming.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; Someone just huming away.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; The great physician
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; now is near
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; the sympathizing Jesus.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; He begin to wonder who is this? Where is
[2:07:58] this song coming from?
[2:08:01] And he begin to walk and
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; find this girl.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; She's just washing away at this. And
[2:08:08] it's a hard job.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; She hasn't got any shoes on her feet.
[2:08:13] She looks poor. She looks wretched.
[2:08:17] But there's a joy in the heart.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; There's a joy in the heart.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, listen church. We may be going
[2:08:24] through trials. We may be going through
[2:08:27] hard times. But listen to let there be a
[2:08:29] joy in your heart that you keep on
[2:08:31] singing that you keep on praising him
[2:08:34] that you keep on worshiping him in the
[2:08:36] midst of your trial and you see that he
[2:08:39] begin to draw near to you and he begin
[2:08:41] to bring you peace and begin to bring
[2:08:43] you comfort to guide you through your
[2:08:45] trials and she kept on singing and he
[2:08:49] came and begin to ask her who are you
[2:08:51] and what's your name and she begin to
[2:08:53] tell her and he said listen will you
[2:08:56] marry me?
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; Will you marry me?
[2:09:01] And the girl is who me?
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; I have nothing.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; I am not.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; I am a dishwasher over here.
[2:09:13] But you see, he was looking for
[2:09:15] character.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; He was looking for character. Amen.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; He was looking for someone that was not
[2:09:22] going to be complaining,
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; but someone that in the midst of the
[2:09:25] trial
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; was still amen going to be praising him.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; And he found that character
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; and he said, "Well,
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; if you want to marry me,
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; sure.
[2:09:38] When he came your way and invited you,
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; you didn't feel worthy."
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; Up until today, sometimes, Lord, I'm so
[2:09:45] unworthy.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; I'm so unworthy. Why did you even choose
[2:09:49] me?
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; Why did you even choose me?
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; But because he loved you.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; Because you've always been a part of
[2:09:57] them.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Sure." And he gave her a
[2:10:03] promise. I'm going to go, but I'm going
[2:10:06] to come back for you.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I'm going to go, but
[2:10:10] I'm going to come back for you.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; And he has given you a promise.
[2:10:15] I am going, but I'm coming back for you.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; I am coming back for you.
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; But in the meantime, you are still going
[2:10:23] to be a dishwasher.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; In the meantime, you're still going to
[2:10:27] go through struggles. In the meantime,
[2:10:31] you're still going to go through trials.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; In the meantime, you're going to go
[2:10:35] through hard times in your life. Why?
[2:10:37] Because the symphony has to keep going.
[2:10:40] The symphony still has to has it lows.
[2:10:43] It still has her has his voice and the
[2:10:45] symphony has still gone. Keep going. But
[2:10:47] I am coming.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; And she kept on doing what she was
[2:10:53] doing.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; Trials, temptations, but she kept on
[2:10:57] singing. She kept on singing.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; But oh church, one day, oh, one day
[2:11:06] she woke up out of her bed for the last
[2:11:09] time.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:12] Hallelujah.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; You know, one day she came to church,
[2:11:19] sat behind the piano
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; and played for the last time.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; One day she walked into those doors for
[2:11:32] the last time.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; One day she washed those dishes
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; for the last time.
[2:11:41] The beat
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; was about to change.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; One day she sat on a pew
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; for the last time.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; One day she went through a trial for the
[2:11:55] last time.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; One day she weeped for the last time.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; One day she was discouraged for the last
[2:12:05] time.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. because you begin to hear the sign
[2:12:10] of the chariots
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; coming to take it home.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; One of these days, church,
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; somewhere, brother Brandham said between
[2:12:20] 6:00 and 9.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; Somewhere between 6:00 and 9,
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; it's going to be for the last time.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; The music is changing.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; The symphony is changing.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; You may be just washing the dishes. You
[2:12:35] may be just going through some trial.
[2:12:36] Don't stop. Just keep going. Just keep
[2:12:40] doing what you were doing. At the
[2:12:42] opening of the seven seals, brother
[2:12:43] Brennham said, "Don't get excited. Just
[2:12:46] keep doing what you're doing. Just keep
[2:12:48] walking with the Lord. Just keep serving
[2:12:50] the Lord and he will take care of the
[2:12:53] rest." Church, let me encourage you this
[2:12:55] evening. One of these days is going to
[2:12:57] be the last time when the chariot when
[2:13:00] you will hear the trumpet saying and the
[2:13:02] final the final
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; the final day
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; will be here.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; And these bodies will be changed
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; and we will be in another part of the
[2:13:14] symphony.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, there will be no more pain. There
[2:13:18] will be no more sorrow. Oh church, there
[2:13:20] is coming a day the musicians come.
[2:13:23] There is coming a day where there is be
[2:13:25] no more pain, no more grave siding, no
[2:13:28] more funeral. Oh God, there is there is
[2:13:31] going to be no more sorrow anymore
[2:13:32] there.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; But there's going to be joy forever.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; Arise and shine for your light has come.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; This is your hour. This is your season.
[2:13:45] Let's stand on our feet this evening.
[2:13:48] Oh hallelujah.
[2:13:51] Oh hallelujah.
[2:13:53] Let's sing that song. There is coming a
[2:13:55] day.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; There is coming a day.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:14:07] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; What a day that will be.
[2:14:13] Oh, help us sing. Anyone here can help
[2:14:15] us sing while you sing together with us.
[2:14:17] Oh
[2:14:19] man,
[2:14:22] I know how
[2:14:24] they shall come.
[2:14:27] Oh, clouds
[2:14:30] in the sky.
[2:14:37] for all of
[2:14:43] that
[2:14:45] golden sh.
[2:14:56] Oh, what a day.
[2:15:02] Oh, when my Jesus
[2:15:05] I shall see.
[2:15:12] The one will save me
[2:15:17] when he's going to take your boy to
[2:15:18] hand.
[2:15:21] Oh, and he lead
[2:15:25] the promised land.
[2:15:30] Glorious day
[2:15:34] will be.
[2:15:43] Oh, no more burdens
[2:15:46] today.
[2:15:48] No more sickness,
[2:15:50] no more pain,
[2:15:53] no more pattern over there.
[2:15:57] Oh, and forever we will be with him.
[2:16:02] When the one will die for me,
[2:16:06] will die for me.
[2:16:08] Oh,
[2:16:21] heat, heat.
[2:16:29] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:16:40] Take me by the hand. I lead me to the
[2:16:46] pro.
[2:16:49] Oh, what a day.
[2:16:52] Glorious day
[2:16:55] will be. Oh, what a day that will be.
[2:16:59] Oh, what a day
[2:17:02] that will be.
[2:17:04] Oh my Jesus
[2:17:19] reality.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are walking in us. Amen.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; You know, brother Brandon one time will
[2:17:24] tell us a story
[2:17:26] about a violin.
[2:17:29] You know, it was a violin that was at an
[2:17:31] auctioneer and
[2:17:34] you know, the violin was was being
[2:17:36] auctioned and people making offers on
[2:17:40] it.
[2:17:41] $1, $2, $3
[2:17:46] seem to have no value in us.
[2:17:50] You see, the violin was dirty and dusty
[2:17:52] and and it just just lying there.
[2:17:57] But you see one day the master walked
[2:17:59] in.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; You see the one that that could play it,
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; the one that knew about music,
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; the one that knew about symphonies,
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; he walked in
[2:18:18] and he picked up that violin and it
[2:18:21] began to dust us,
[2:18:24] began to clean us.
[2:18:26] Then he began to play some music.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; As he began to play some music,
[2:18:34] the offer came back again. And from $1,
[2:18:37] it began to go to a,000,
[2:18:40] 2,000,
[2:18:41] 3,000.
[2:18:44] Encourage you to say it this morning to
[2:18:45] say the master is here.
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; He's the composer of your life.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; He knows how to play it.
[2:18:56] Maybe you may feel like you've gotten
[2:18:58] dusty or may maybe feel like you've lost
[2:19:01] value of of who you really are. But let
[2:19:03] me say the master is here.
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; He can pick up that violin.
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; He can begin to dust it off. And
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; play the symphony.
[2:19:14] Play the music that he wants to play
[2:19:16] through your life.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; You are of a great value.
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; You are of a great value.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't let the enemy tell you
[2:19:24] anything else.
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; You are of a great value.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; Arise and shine.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; This is you season church. This gross
[2:19:36] darkness and we see it all around us.
[2:19:39] But there's still light.
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; And you are the light
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; by the vindicated words of this day and
[2:19:45] of this hour. You may help me to believe
[2:19:48] that this morning.
[2:19:50] I'm going to say, "Lord, here I am. Take
[2:19:53] my violin.
[2:19:55] Begin to play. Begin to play the music
[2:19:59] that you won't play it out of my life
[2:20:01] and let it glorify you."
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; We want no glory in this. We don't want
[2:20:05] to be like Lucifer. We want to glorify
[2:20:07] you again.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:20:13] Can we sing that song and turn her back
[2:20:15] to brother brother
[2:20:18] Barry here?
[2:20:22] It's just slipping me here.
[2:20:26] Maybe let's just sing that one. I am
[2:20:29] looking for a rapture
[2:20:31] and that blessed home on high
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; when the redeemed
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; shall be gathered in.
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; How many believe that we're going to be
[2:20:39] gathered there? Yeah.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; Listen, church. We preach about it. We
[2:20:44] talk about it.
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; But it's a reality.
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; And that's where the music is going.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; That's where the symphony is going.
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; That's where the beat is changing.
[2:20:56] That's where we head into
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; in the blessed home and I and the
[2:21:00] redeemed will be gathered. Your loved
[2:21:02] ones are waiting for you. The angels are
[2:21:04] cheering you up.
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; G.
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; Keep going.
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; Keep pressing on.
[2:21:10] Keep pressing on. Just give me another
[2:21:12] minute. Let me share this. Oh my. You
[2:21:15] know, it's it's incredible. But you
[2:21:17] know, in a symphony, I'm I'm done. Sorry
[2:21:20] for keeping you standing. Bring it on.
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; But you know, the Lord just just brought
[2:21:24] this to my attention. Just write your
[2:21:27] name.
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; But you know, in a symphony, you know,
[2:21:30] do you have all these big players and
[2:21:32] you know, these guys, you know, they
[2:21:34] they they grace and they playing the
[2:21:36] violins and everything. But you know,
[2:21:37] there's this guy that sits down in a
[2:21:39] corner sometimes. You know, he's called
[2:21:41] the triangle player.
[2:21:45] You know, this triangle player is a guy
[2:21:47] that boy, he just sits there and he's
[2:21:50] just waiting and they just play and play
[2:21:53] and play. And you know, usually, you
[2:21:55] know, the the composer of the director
[2:21:58] most of the time is the guy that is now
[2:22:00] very talented and they just give him the
[2:22:02] triangle just to let him feel good, you
[2:22:05] know. But you know sometimes we may feel
[2:22:07] like the triangle player you know that
[2:22:09] we've just been sitting there and and
[2:22:11] you know tends to happen in here and
[2:22:13] tends to happen in there and tends to
[2:22:15] happen in this person's life and what
[2:22:17] about my life you know sometimes the
[2:22:19] bride of this age can feel like the
[2:22:21] triangle player but you know one thing
[2:22:25] the symphony according to the sheet
[2:22:27] music cannot be ended until that
[2:22:30] triangle player hit that thing. Are you
[2:22:33] with me this morning? Listen, you may
[2:22:36] feel like you are a triangle player.
[2:22:38] This bride may feel like, you know,
[2:22:40] we've been sitting here and we've been
[2:22:41] waiting and waiting and waiting. But let
[2:22:43] me say this. The scripture says, oh,
[2:22:45] glory be to God. My I got to stop cuz if
[2:22:47] not, we'll start preaching again. But
[2:22:49] listen, the scripture says that they
[2:22:52] shall not be made perfect without us.
[2:22:55] Listen, until this trigonal player bride
[2:22:59] hits that thing, the music is not over.
[2:23:03] Oh well, glory. Until they hit that
[2:23:05] thing, the music is not yet over.
[2:23:08] Listen, everyone is playing their pride.
[2:23:11] But this is your season to arise and
[2:23:14] shine. The director is saying your hour
[2:23:17] has come to hit your thing
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; because it is the end of the day, the
[2:23:23] end of the edge. This bright edge is
[2:23:26] coming to an end. Brother Barry, please
[2:23:28] come. I am thinking of the rapture and
[2:23:31] the blessed homo. God bless you. It was
[2:23:34] wonderful today. Let's sing.
[2:23:55] our gathering.
[2:23:58] Oh, how we'll raise the heavenly
[2:24:02] in that sea in the sky.
[2:24:09] That's right now.
[2:24:22] Heat. Heat.
[2:24:35] There will be a great process.
[2:24:47] Oh my goal.
[2:25:00] Yeah. Heat.
[2:25:12] Heat.
[2:25:23] Heat.
[2:25:32] Heat.
[2:25:36] Heat.
[2:25:46] Heat. Heat.
[2:26:12] Heat. Heat.
[2:26:21] Heat.
[2:26:26] Heat.
[2:27:00] Glory.
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; I think it's so wonderful how we just
[2:27:04] don't have to wait.
[2:27:06] When the redeemed get together, they
[2:27:08] know how to worship.
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; Truly marvelous today to hear once again
[2:27:13] the word directly from the throne
[2:27:16] &gt;&gt; to our hearts.
[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; Certainly thank the Lord for the
[2:27:19] ministry in brother Max's life and
[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; how he can just yield himself
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; to be a conduit to speak to the bride.
[2:27:27] My goodness.
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; Can we sing hallelujah? What a thought.
[2:27:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus full salvation. But
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; victory. I feel like singing for a
[2:27:39] little bit. If you feel like you need to
[2:27:40] go, I certainly don't want to keep you.
[2:27:42] God richly bless you. If you feel like
[2:27:44] rejoicing for a little bit, remember the
[2:27:46] victories in the Old Testament, they
[2:27:48] were won in the rejoicing.
[2:27:51] &gt;&gt; If you heard from your theophony today,
[2:27:53] then just water that word with a little
[2:27:55] bit of rejoicing and see what happens.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:59] Hallelujah. What a thought. Jesus for
[2:28:03] salvation.
[2:28:05] Victory.
[2:28:08] Victory.
[2:28:12] Let the power of sail.
[2:28:15] Heaven's grace never fail. Amen.
[2:28:21] Oh, victory.
[2:28:24] Victory.
[2:28:27] Yes. Victory.
[2:28:30] Heat.
[2:28:33] Heat.
[2:28:49] I am trusting you.
[2:28:52] I am standing on you. Victory.
[2:28:59] Victory.
[2:29:17] Heat. Heat.
[2:29:27] Heat.
[2:29:39] Heat.
[2:29:48] Yeah.
[2:29:52] Heat.
[2:30:03] Heat. Heat.
[2:30:19] Heat.
[2:30:26] Heat.
[2:30:36] Yeah.
[2:30:39] Heat.
[2:31:06] Heat.
[2:31:08] Heat.
[2:31:20] Amen. Hallelujah. All this rejoicing
[2:31:24] just makes me want to travel on. How
[2:31:26] about you? You feel like traveling on?
[2:31:30] &gt;&gt; My goodness,
[2:31:32] I feel like traveling on.
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:39] My heavenly home is bright and fair. I
[2:31:45] feel like traveling on
[2:31:51] your death
[2:31:54] there. I feel like traveling.
[2:32:01] Heat. Heat.
[2:32:15] Heat.
[2:32:17] Heat.
[2:32:36] Heat.
[2:32:39] Heat.
[2:32:48] Heat.
[2:33:00] Heat.
[2:33:09] Oh,
[2:33:22] heat, heat.
[2:33:30] A
[2:33:43] Heat. Heat.
[2:33:54] Yeah.
[2:33:57] Heat.
[2:34:20] Heat. Heat.
[2:34:29] The Lord's been so good. The Lord has
[2:34:32] been so good.
[2:34:36] I feel like
[2:34:47] Heat.
[2:34:51] Heat.
[2:35:12] Hallelujah.
[2:35:14] Amen. Amen.
[2:35:18] I feel like I could say a lot, but I
[2:35:20] don't want to keep us here today.
[2:35:21] Brother Emanuel, could I invite you to
[2:35:23] come and close in prayer?
[2:35:29] Just sing one more song after this. Just
[2:35:31] so you don't have to be nervous. You're
[2:35:34] not going to keep us long. Come on,
[2:35:36] brother.
[2:35:39] God bless you, brother.
[2:35:42] May the Lord bless you, saints.
[2:35:44] &gt;&gt; Are you glad to be in his presence?
[2:35:48] &gt;&gt; I'm just wondering if we ask Sister
[2:35:51] Michelle to play the kahoon, how it's
[2:35:53] going to go.
[2:35:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah, because she wants to play. No, it
[2:35:58] doesn't work that way. In this house
[2:36:03] there is a composer.
[2:36:04] &gt;&gt; We have his script.
[2:36:06] &gt;&gt; And that's what we executed.
[2:36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:08] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[2:36:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; Let's bow down our hearts.
[2:36:13] &gt;&gt; Lord, we love you. Lord, we appreciate
[2:36:16] you. Lord, we adore you.
[2:36:18] &gt;&gt; Lord, we believe you. We just say, "Help
[2:36:21] thou our unbelief.
[2:36:23] &gt;&gt; You are the faithful one and it's all
[2:36:26] you're doing." We say again, Lord, help
[2:36:29] us to yield. Oh Lord, help us to let go
[2:36:31] of ourselves, of our ambitions, of our
[2:36:35] thoughts, of our desires, and let you
[2:36:38] have the supreme minutes, Father,
[2:36:40] because it's all about you. You gave the
[2:36:43] promise. You gave us the faith to
[2:36:45] believe. And that is how far we have
[2:36:47] come. Eeneza, glory to your name. Praise
[2:36:50] be to your name, Father, for your
[2:36:52] faithfulness, oh Lord. We love you, oh
[2:36:55] Lord. But blessed be that plan you had
[2:36:58] before the foundation of the earth.
[2:36:59] Father, it is going as planned. Oh Lord,
[2:37:02] we just come to say glory to your name.
[2:37:05] We come to say praise be to your name.
[2:37:07] Oh Lord, there is none like you, oh
[2:37:09] Lord. We thank you so much, oh Lord,
[2:37:12] that you've given us this special
[2:37:13] privilege, Father, to come here and call
[2:37:15] you our father. to come here believing
[2:37:18] on you, to come here knowing that you've
[2:37:20] taken care of everything, Father, and
[2:37:22] that what is going on now was ordained
[2:37:25] before the foundation of the earth, and
[2:37:26] that your purpose will be fulfilled.
[2:37:29] Lord, we adore you. Lord, we appreciate
[2:37:31] you. Lord, we magnify your name. We
[2:37:34] exalt your name. And father, we invite
[2:37:36] your presence not just in this house,
[2:37:38] but in these hearts, oh Lord, that are
[2:37:40] here to surrender, oh Lord, for your
[2:37:42] purpose to be fulfilled. Lord, we
[2:37:44] appreciate you so much. Thank you Lord.
[2:37:46] We have nothing but gratitude
[2:37:49] &gt;&gt; for such an extraordinary call father
[2:37:52] and we yield Lord.
[2:37:54] &gt;&gt; Help us. We know there are many
[2:37:56] distractions but still you are faithful
[2:38:00] and we are counting on you. We are
[2:38:02] believing on you. We are relying on you.
[2:38:04] We are calling on you. Father have your
[2:38:07] way. All we do is yield and let you lead
[2:38:10] the way.
[2:38:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:38:13] Father, we pray that you'll bless my
[2:38:15] brother.
[2:38:18] &gt;&gt; That Father, you've encouraged brother
[2:38:20] Maxwell.
[2:38:22] &gt;&gt; Father, no one, you can never use a
[2:38:25] person like that without the devil
[2:38:26] fighting back.
[2:38:28] &gt;&gt; And so I'm saying, Lord, visit my
[2:38:30] brother when he's alone.
[2:38:32] &gt;&gt; Strengthen him, encourage him, continue
[2:38:34] to eliminate his parath Lord. Lord,
[2:38:37] &gt;&gt; and do you as you please with this life,
[2:38:39] &gt;&gt; we are all yours, Lord. We love and
[2:38:42] appreciate you, Father. And even as we
[2:38:45] go home, Father, let your presence go
[2:38:46] with us.
[2:38:48] &gt;&gt; The first thing the devil would want to
[2:38:49] do is point to our weaknesses and short
[2:38:51] ones and say, "You are not part of
[2:38:52] this." Father, we've claimed it today
[2:38:56] &gt;&gt; and it's ours forever.
[2:38:58] &gt;&gt; You did not start a good work to end
[2:39:00] today.
[2:39:01] &gt;&gt; It's going all the way into eternity.
[2:39:04] &gt;&gt; And we appreciate you for that, Father.
[2:39:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:39:07] &gt;&gt; Bless every soul that will even hear
[2:39:09] this later, Father.
[2:39:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:39:11] We love and appreciate you. We adore and
[2:39:14] believe you. Thank you again for this
[2:39:16] time together in your presence. In Jesus
[2:39:18] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; Remember the youth service we have
[2:39:29] coming up here this afternoon.
[2:39:31] Just want to sing one more song. Like I
[2:39:33] said, the original life. Many times
[2:39:37] we'll end on a softer, quieter song, but
[2:39:39] I just feel like rejoicing. And you
[2:39:42] know, maybe it's part of the Pentecostal
[2:39:43] experience. Only a select few people

[2:40:08] &gt;&gt; Let's sing the song here. God's
[2:40:11] attributes were manifested to his bride
[2:40:15] in this last age. We have caught the
[2:40:18] revelation
[2:40:19] by the last prophet's message. And we
[2:40:23] know who we are and what we're raised up
[2:40:27] for. Praise the Lord.
[2:40:30] The original life.
[2:40:33] The original life.
[2:40:36] The original sea,
[2:40:39] the original word.
[2:40:42] That's what I believe.
[2:40:44] The son of man is revealed.
[2:40:51] Amen.
[2:40:56] We are the word made today. This is what
[2:41:00] the scripture say. And our names are
[2:41:03] seen within.
[2:41:07] Yes, we are anointed. Oh, and we are
[2:41:11] inspired by our God.
[2:41:23] The original
[2:41:26] That's what I believe.
[2:41:29] My man
[2:41:33] is
[2:41:35] alive.
[2:41:37] The original
[2:41:41] of understanding
[2:41:43] has opened up at last and sweet victory
[2:41:47] is ours. Hallelujah.
[2:41:51] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:42:01] Heat. Heat.
[2:42:14] is the seven seal.
[2:42:19] Amen.
[2:42:22] Hallelujah.
[2:42:23] We are called to adoption full of glory
[2:42:28] and power saints will wake and join us
[2:42:32] in this hour.
[2:42:35] Hallelujah. Thank you Lord.
[2:42:39] Heat. Heat.
[2:42:52] God bless you today.
[2:44:02] Heat.
[2:44:22] Heat.
[2:45:51] See?
[2:47:00] Good morning.
[2:47:09] Church.
[2:47:58] I am very good.
[2:48:09] Heat. Heat.
[2:48:36] Oh
[2:48:56] god.
