[1:04:26] communion service thank you musicians if
[1:04:29] you have your Bibles
[1:04:30] I'd like to read from First Corinthians
[1:04:32] chapter 10
[1:04:34] starting with verse
[1:04:40] verse 13.
[1:04:43] actually 12.
[1:04:45] First Corinthians 10
[1:04:47] verse 12.
[1:04:49] when you get there Say Amen
[1:04:56] still hear pages
[1:04:59] I just don't want to rush
[1:05:02] I think it's important for us to take
[1:05:03] the time
[1:05:05] not be in a hurry we know that the
[1:05:08] Spirit of the Lord is timid
[1:05:11] and if we get nervous it's not a good
[1:05:13] thing
[1:05:15] start with verse 12. First Corinthians
[1:05:18] chapter 10.
[1:05:20] it says wherefore let him that thinketh
[1:05:23] he standeth
[1:05:25] take heed lest he fall
[1:05:28] there hath no temptation taken you but
[1:05:31] such is common to man
[1:05:33] but God is faithful
[1:05:36] who will not suffer you to be tempted
[1:05:38] above that year Abel
[1:05:40] but will with the temptation
[1:05:43] also make a way to escape that ye may be
[1:05:47] able to bear it
[1:05:49] he's not going to give you a complete
[1:05:51] deliverance he's going to take that
[1:05:53] temptation
[1:05:54] and use it to deliver
[1:05:57] verse 14 wherefore my dearly beloved
[1:06:00] Flee for idolatry
[1:06:03] I speak as to wise men judge ye what I
[1:06:06] say
[1:06:07] the cup of blessing which we bless is it
[1:06:10] not the communion of the blood of Christ
[1:06:13] the bread which we break is it not the
[1:06:17] communion of the body of Christ
[1:06:20] for we being many are one bread and one
[1:06:24] body
[1:06:26] for we are all partakers of that one
[1:06:29] bread
[1:06:30] behold Israel after the flesh are they
[1:06:33] not
[1:06:34] they which eat of the sacrifices
[1:06:37] partakers of the altar
[1:06:39] what say I them
[1:06:42] that the idol is anything or that which
[1:06:46] is offered in sacrifice to Idols is
[1:06:49] anything but I say
[1:06:52] that the things which the Gentiles
[1:06:54] sacrifice they sacrifice to devils and
[1:06:58] not to God
[1:06:59] and I would not that ye should have
[1:07:01] fellowship with devils
[1:07:04] you cannot drink the cup of the Lord
[1:07:07] and the cup of devils
[1:07:09] you cannot be partakers of the Lord's
[1:07:11] table
[1:07:12] and of the table of devils
[1:07:15] let's just bow in prayer one more time
[1:07:17] gracious Heavenly Father we thank you
[1:07:20] for your word we thank you for your
[1:07:21] goodness thank you for the Discerning of
[1:07:24] spirits Lord and the ability to have the
[1:07:27] the spirit of Truth father come and
[1:07:30] minister to us the the words of Life
[1:07:33] father Lord we just ask that you would
[1:07:35] speak the words you want spoken tonight
[1:07:37] and stop those which you don't we ask
[1:07:40] that you would bless this word now as we
[1:07:42] go forwards father in Jesus Christ's
[1:07:44] name we pray amen amen bless you tonight
[1:07:47] you may be seated
[1:07:49] I will not keep us long in terms of a
[1:07:53] a preaching service basically brothers
[1:07:56] and sisters
[1:07:58] I think it's a beautiful scripture here
[1:08:00] if you go back maybe on your spare time
[1:08:03] and just read from the beginning
[1:08:06] of chapter 10 verse 1 it talks about
[1:08:08] them going through the Wilderness and
[1:08:11] how there was a cloud a pillar of cloud
[1:08:14] that delivered them and you know it's no
[1:08:17] different for us in our day we have a
[1:08:19] pillar of cloud that has given us
[1:08:21] deliverance and given us guidance today
[1:08:24] and I I just think it's a beautiful
[1:08:26] scripture here we could summarize the
[1:08:28] whole thing right now with verse 21 you
[1:08:31] cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the
[1:08:33] cup of devils you can't be a
[1:08:36] double-minded man you can't live in the
[1:08:38] world and come to church and partake of
[1:08:40] the communion table because we know
[1:08:41] we're going to read it a little bit
[1:08:42] later if we do that we eat and drink
[1:08:44] unworthily that means we eat and drink
[1:08:47] damnation unto ourselves
[1:08:50] you cannot drink the cup of the Lord and
[1:08:52] the cup of devils you cannot be
[1:08:54] partakers of the Lord's table and of the
[1:08:57] table of devils we cannot be
[1:09:00] double agents
[1:09:02] you know uh brother Phil
[1:09:04] mcgowby he preached a service a while
[1:09:07] back before he left some may know him
[1:09:09] some may not he moved to Africa but he
[1:09:13] preached a service about Discerning the
[1:09:14] Lord's body
[1:09:16] and you know if we can recognize who the
[1:09:19] Lord is today where the Lord's Temple is
[1:09:22] today if we recognize really what we're
[1:09:24] talking about when we talk about
[1:09:26] Discerning the Lord's body it's not
[1:09:28] Discerning that this bread and wine that
[1:09:31] we eat is is the Lord's body even though
[1:09:33] it is it's an example of the Lord's body
[1:09:35] that was broken for us
[1:09:38] the Lord's body is our brothers and our
[1:09:40] sisters
[1:09:41] it's not just the Gentile church it's
[1:09:43] not just the church the mystical Body of
[1:09:46] Christ it is all of that but brothers
[1:09:48] and sisters it's our brothers and our
[1:09:50] sisters our husbands our wives our
[1:09:52] parents our our children it's all of the
[1:09:56] bodies of Believers they're all a part
[1:09:59] of that body and you know we will never
[1:10:02] be able to drink of this cup and eat of
[1:10:04] this bread worthily if we don't discern
[1:10:07] the Lord's body and recognize whose feet
[1:10:09] we are going to wash tonight
[1:10:11] and I've said it before the last time
[1:10:13] probably we had communion service and
[1:10:15] maybe even the time before that you know
[1:10:17] when uh when Abram had his name change
[1:10:20] and he went and had the slaughter of the
[1:10:23] Kings he he saved his nephew who was a a
[1:10:26] penny in the economy of God even though
[1:10:28] he was a silver dollar he still ran to
[1:10:31] the ends of the Earth brother Branham
[1:10:33] said to to save his his nephew and and
[1:10:36] the reason he did that is he was
[1:10:38] Discerning the Lord's body he recognized
[1:10:40] that he was a part of the economy of God
[1:10:42] and he wasn't allowed allowing him to
[1:10:45] just go and be consumed by what was
[1:10:47] happening he did everything within his
[1:10:49] power to go and save him but it was only
[1:10:51] after the slaughtering of the Kings it
[1:10:53] was only after the battle and after the
[1:10:56] Deliverance that who came to serve him
[1:10:58] communion it was Melchizedek tonight
[1:11:01] brothers and sisters I want to remind us
[1:11:03] I want to encourage us when you come to
[1:11:05] the communion table don't think about
[1:11:06] brother Peter or brother Emmanuel or
[1:11:09] brother Toby standing here with you or
[1:11:10] brother Barry standing behind the Paw
[1:11:11] think about Melchizedek himself being
[1:11:14] here that one who serves communion
[1:11:16] because that's really what we're doing
[1:11:18] we're Discerning the Lord's body
[1:11:20] and we know that Melchizedek was a type
[1:11:22] of the Lord
[1:11:24] out of communion in 1965
[1:11:27] brother Branham says now we're fixing to
[1:11:29] observe something here that's really
[1:11:31] sacred
[1:11:32] I just think it's such a maybe a simple
[1:11:34] statement a couple of simple quotes is
[1:11:36] all I'm going to bring tonight and this
[1:11:38] scripture here we can't serve God and
[1:11:40] Mammon we can't live in the world and
[1:11:43] then run to church and actually serve
[1:11:44] God we've got to be willing to give our
[1:11:47] all to be able to discern the Lord's
[1:11:49] body and if we don't do that brothers
[1:11:51] and sisters we're eating and drinking
[1:11:52] unworthily we'll be bringing damnation
[1:11:55] unto ourselves
[1:11:56] but when we're willing to actually just
[1:11:58] lay ourselves down on the Altar and say
[1:12:00] Lord be it unto me according to Thy word
[1:12:02] let let your word come inside of me and
[1:12:05] just give me that new birth Change Me
[1:12:07] From the Inside Out not the outside in
[1:12:10] like we said this morning from the
[1:12:11] inside out if you will do that Lord then
[1:12:15] I know that I can come to the table
[1:12:17] worthily and I believe honestly brothers
[1:12:19] and sisters that's why every one of us
[1:12:21] have come here and I know that I'm
[1:12:23] hearing a lot of Amen so that means you
[1:12:24] agree I'm preaching to the choir tonight
[1:12:27] but I don't want to say a lot tonight I
[1:12:30] don't want to take a bunch of time just
[1:12:31] a couple of quotes like I said I want to
[1:12:33] give us a chance to have some
[1:12:35] testimonies I know I talked about having
[1:12:38] a testimony service at one point but uh
[1:12:40] you know it's a smaller crowd so I feel
[1:12:42] like we could do a testimony service and
[1:12:44] get away with it and the reason I like
[1:12:46] the testimony Services because it's good
[1:12:48] to talk about what God is currently
[1:12:50] doing in our midst it's good to
[1:12:51] understand what the Lord is doing for us
[1:12:53] right now today not not sometime in the
[1:12:55] future and not sometime in the past we
[1:12:57] can all look back in our lives and say
[1:12:59] we've seen many great signs and wonders
[1:13:02] many tremendous miracles in our lives
[1:13:03] but what's he doing for us today Satan
[1:13:06] wants us to forget about what's
[1:13:07] happening today he brother Bradham said
[1:13:09] it many times that you know he it's the
[1:13:11] biggest trick of the devil is to get man
[1:13:13] looking forward to what God is going to
[1:13:14] do and looking back to what he's already
[1:13:16] done but ignoring what he's doing right
[1:13:17] now and that's why I think it's so vital
[1:13:20] for us to remember what he's doing right
[1:13:22] now to talk about what he's doing right
[1:13:24] now it could be just enough
[1:13:25] encouragement to push one of your
[1:13:27] brothers or sisters right over the edge
[1:13:29] with a little bit of extra Faith to say
[1:13:31] hey if God will do it for my brother God
[1:13:33] will do it for my sister he'll do it for
[1:13:35] me I know he will because I believe like
[1:13:37] they believe
[1:13:38] at a community in 1965 1212 brother
[1:13:41] Branham says now we're fixing to observe
[1:13:43] something that's really sacred I was
[1:13:45] called on a few days ago to some very
[1:13:47] fine Christian gentleman that's never
[1:13:49] had this and he understood that we take
[1:13:51] in communion literally
[1:13:54] they take it what they call spiritual
[1:13:56] communion
[1:13:58] and which as far as communion I'd say
[1:14:01] all right because communicate is to talk
[1:14:05] to see and that brother give me this
[1:14:07] scripture said brother Branham don't you
[1:14:09] think now now reason I'm saying this is
[1:14:12] it's all right brother Perry he says
[1:14:14] sure
[1:14:15] see the reason that I'm saying this is
[1:14:16] so that you would understand what you're
[1:14:18] doing
[1:14:19] we have to understand what we're doing
[1:14:21] brothers and sisters this isn't just a
[1:14:23] tradition that we come and do because
[1:14:24] our parents do it it's not just a
[1:14:26] tradition that we come and do because
[1:14:27] even brother Branham said come and do it
[1:14:29] this is not just a tradition that we do
[1:14:31] because everybody comes to do it we do
[1:14:33] this because we love the Lord because we
[1:14:36] understand that he gave us instruction
[1:14:37] to do this
[1:14:39] and do this with a clean heart and isn't
[1:14:42] it wonderful that we have this as
[1:14:43] Believers even sometimes in our lives
[1:14:45] maybe we think my goodness I don't know
[1:14:47] if I can do that I don't know if I can
[1:14:49] go to the communion table because I just
[1:14:50] don't have something right in my heart
[1:14:51] the reason we have that is so that we'll
[1:14:53] go make that right
[1:14:54] because the believer is coming to this
[1:14:56] communion table the believer is not
[1:14:58] going to not come to this communion
[1:14:59] table
[1:15:00] and that's just maybe my view but I just
[1:15:03] believe it with all my heart the
[1:15:04] believer is coming to the communion
[1:15:05] table we won't pass up the community
[1:15:07] tale because that's an instruction of
[1:15:08] the Lord
[1:15:10] he says see that reason I'm saying this
[1:15:12] is so that you would understand what
[1:15:13] you're doing you don't if you walk into
[1:15:16] anything blindly you don't know where
[1:15:19] what you're doing
[1:15:20] you can't have even confidence if you
[1:15:23] don't know what you're doing but you
[1:15:25] must understand what you are doing and
[1:15:27] why you're doing it
[1:15:29] he said now if we take the word of God
[1:15:32] isn't that God that we're taking
[1:15:36] said exactly right sir it's true but we
[1:15:39] read here that they actually Paul taught
[1:15:41] taking the literal Lord's Supper this do
[1:15:45] in remembrance of me said Jesus as oft
[1:15:48] as ye take it in remembrance of me you
[1:15:52] show forth the Lord's death till he
[1:15:55] comes see
[1:15:56] now we are able to take it when we
[1:15:59] understand that we are partaking of the
[1:16:01] Lord's body literally
[1:16:04] partaking of the Lord's body Discerning
[1:16:06] that this is the instruction of the Lord
[1:16:08] we're following the instructions of the
[1:16:10] lord it's not some tradition that we're
[1:16:12] after here I just can't express it
[1:16:14] enough I just think it's such a a
[1:16:16] wonderful thing and you know to say that
[1:16:18] maybe I don't have something right in my
[1:16:20] heart so I'm just not going to go to
[1:16:21] church and I'm not going to partake of
[1:16:23] the communion table you're actually
[1:16:24] disobeying God by not taking the
[1:16:26] communion because we're supposed to take
[1:16:29] the communion table we're supposed to
[1:16:31] discern the Lord's body we're supposed
[1:16:32] to make sure that our lives are correct
[1:16:34] and if they're not correct just make
[1:16:36] them correct that's all we need to do
[1:16:38] we don't want to walk around with a ball
[1:16:40] and chain you know what that is that's a
[1:16:42] devil that's a Tormentor something is
[1:16:43] holding us back from doing what the Lord
[1:16:45] instructs us to do
[1:16:47] but once again I know I'm preaching to
[1:16:49] the choir because everyone's here to
[1:16:51] partake of the Lord's body if you're
[1:16:52] here tonight Brothers and Sisters You've
[1:16:54] Got reason to celebrate I believe you've
[1:16:56] got reason to shout because something
[1:16:58] inside you constrains you to come and
[1:17:01] follow the leadership of the Lord to
[1:17:03] partake of one of the last three
[1:17:06] instructions that were given to the
[1:17:08] church
[1:17:09] brother Branham says there's three
[1:17:11] physical Divine orders left to the
[1:17:14] church out of this the message communion
[1:17:16] 1965 he says now we only have three
[1:17:19] physical Divine orders left to us one of
[1:17:22] them is communion
[1:17:24] Discerning the Lord's body the other one
[1:17:26] is foot washing we know the word of God
[1:17:28] says happy are ye if you do these things
[1:17:31] happy are you if you can humble yourself
[1:17:33] before your brother before your sister
[1:17:34] you don't have so much pride then I
[1:17:36] don't have to go and deal with someone's
[1:17:38] stinky feet you know I say that not not
[1:17:40] because anybody has any stinky feet it's
[1:17:42] more of a personal thing for me because
[1:17:44] I used to be a cobbler and I used to
[1:17:46] deal with shoes extensively but you know
[1:17:49] brothers and sisters for me that was
[1:17:51] something I had to get over that was a
[1:17:53] real hurdle for me to think seriously
[1:17:55] wash someone's feet man that's weird
[1:17:57] but it says it in the Bible
[1:17:59] because it says it in the Bible I say
[1:18:01] hey man I'm in I'm all in let's do it
[1:18:03] let's do this
[1:18:05] if it's in the Bible I want to do it the
[1:18:07] prophet of God said we have only three
[1:18:09] physical Divine orders left to us one of
[1:18:11] them is communion feet washing and water
[1:18:14] baptism that's the only three things
[1:18:16] that's the Perfection of three
[1:18:20] so if you've been baptized in the name
[1:18:21] of the Lord Jesus Christ for the mission
[1:18:23] of your sins
[1:18:24] you're coming to the Lord's table to
[1:18:26] partake of the communion the the body of
[1:18:29] the Lord to discern the Lord's body and
[1:18:31] you're willing to actually go on and
[1:18:32] have the foot washing then you have
[1:18:33] followed all of the instructions of the
[1:18:35] Lord
[1:18:36] these are not the instructions of the
[1:18:37] Prophet even though the prophet brought
[1:18:39] these instructions this is instruction
[1:18:40] of the Lord through the prophet to the
[1:18:42] church and if we're willing to follow
[1:18:44] the prophet's instructions we're willing
[1:18:46] to follow the lord
[1:18:47] because everything that he's saying here
[1:18:49] this is a beautiful part brothers and
[1:18:50] sisters everything he's saying here is
[1:18:51] in the word of God he's not bringing
[1:18:53] anything new
[1:18:57] he goes on to say see and that's the
[1:18:59] only three orders we have we realize
[1:19:01] that that was the issue given by Saint
[1:19:04] Paul in the New Testament
[1:19:06] now if we would say the communion should
[1:19:08] just be taking the word I don't believe
[1:19:10] anyone has the right to take the Lord's
[1:19:13] Supper until he's taken the word of the
[1:19:16] Lord into his heart
[1:19:18] see
[1:19:19] because I'll I'll read something for you
[1:19:22] in a few moments and you'll see we have
[1:19:24] got to be willing to take the whole
[1:19:25] entire word of God into our hearts to
[1:19:28] follow those three instructions and you
[1:19:30] know whether we have the Holy Ghost or
[1:19:31] not I would say this much don't worry
[1:19:34] about whether you have the Holy Ghost or
[1:19:36] not worry about whether you followed the
[1:19:37] instructions or not if you followed the
[1:19:39] instructions or not with a genuine heart
[1:19:41] then you're eligible to partake of the
[1:19:44] Lord's Supper it's that simple you don't
[1:19:46] have to qualify in any other way just
[1:19:49] have to have a pure heart you have to be
[1:19:50] genuine you have to be willing to follow
[1:19:52] the instruction of the Lord
[1:19:54] so tonight I'm just going to stop there
[1:19:56] I'm not going to go on because I don't
[1:19:58] want to keep us late I know that we
[1:20:00] could have a lot of testimonies and I
[1:20:02] just want to be able to open it up for
[1:20:04] the testimonies
[1:20:05] what I do want to do is two things
[1:20:08] brothers and sisters I want to encourage
[1:20:09] you to just continue walking continue
[1:20:12] pressing on and never ever let anything
[1:20:16] get between you and that communion table
[1:20:18] because if anything gets between you and
[1:20:20] that communion table I want to tell you
[1:20:22] what it is it's the devil
[1:20:23] it's just a devil that's all it is if
[1:20:25] something gets between you and that
[1:20:27] communion table and no nobody wants to
[1:20:29] let a devil get between us and the word
[1:20:31] so just keep pressing on and don't be
[1:20:34] discouraged
[1:20:36] so tonight if you'll turn with me I'll
[1:20:38] just change the order of the service
[1:20:39] we'll go right into the communion
[1:20:41] portion
[1:20:42] then we'll have testimonies and then
[1:20:44] we'll go to foot washing
[1:20:46] if you don't mind
[1:20:50] so if you uh
[1:20:52] don't mind just flip the page First
[1:20:54] Corinthians chapter 11.
[1:21:00] maybe stand with me as we read this
[1:21:03] portion here
[1:21:14] this is the instruction for the Lord's
[1:21:16] table
[1:21:19] verse 23
[1:21:21] for I have received of the Lord
[1:21:25] that which I also delivered unto you
[1:21:28] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:21:31] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:21:34] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:21:37] and said take eat this is my body which
[1:21:40] is broken for you
[1:21:43] this do in remembrance of me
[1:21:46] after the same manner also he took the
[1:21:49] cup and when he had sucked
[1:21:51] saying
[1:21:53] this cup is the New Testament in my
[1:21:56] blood
[1:21:57] this do ye as oft as ye drink it in
[1:22:00] remembrance of me
[1:22:03] for as often as ye eat this bread and
[1:22:05] drink this cup
[1:22:07] ye do shoo the Lord's death till he come
[1:22:11] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:22:14] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:22:16] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:22:19] and blood of the Lord
[1:22:22] but let a man examine himself
[1:22:25] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:22:27] drink of that cup
[1:22:29] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:22:32] unworthily
[1:22:33] Edith and drinketh Damnation to himself
[1:22:36] not Discerning the Lord's body
[1:22:41] for this cause
[1:22:43] many are weak and sickly among you
[1:22:47] and many sleep
[1:22:49] for if we would judge ourselves
[1:22:52] we should not be judged
[1:22:55] but when we are judged we are chastened
[1:22:58] of the Lord that we should not be
[1:23:00] condemned with the world
[1:23:02] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:23:04] together to eat
[1:23:06] tarry one for another
[1:23:09] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:23:11] home
[1:23:12] that ye come not together unto
[1:23:14] condemnation
[1:23:15] and the rest will I set in order
[1:23:18] when I come
[1:23:21] remember brother Branham said here now
[1:23:23] we're fixing to observe something here
[1:23:25] that's really sacred
[1:23:29] we're going to partake of the Lord's
[1:23:30] body
[1:23:31] brothers and sisters
[1:23:33] if if there's anything in our lives if
[1:23:36] there's anything in our hearts
[1:23:38] just take a moment and ask the Lord to
[1:23:41] show you and if there's anything that we
[1:23:43] can do even now in this moment if
[1:23:46] there's someone we need to talk to we'll
[1:23:48] take the time you can make it right you
[1:23:51] don't have to come to the table
[1:23:52] unworthily
[1:23:53] let's just take a moment or two and just
[1:23:55] tarry one for another
[1:23:57] and allow this word to wash us before we
[1:24:01] partake
