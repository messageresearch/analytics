turmoil that's going on specifically the Believers and the families of the Believers in Haiti we also have three unspoken requests that we'd like to continue to remember Before the Throne let let's just go to him in prayer Jesus gracious Heavenly Father we're so thankful that you are the great I am that you are our everpresent help in our time of trouble father that you've given us a hotline to you Lord Jesus father many times in this world we would long to have a phone a direct line to a a military power or to a great man with lots of power and money and influence but Lord you have given us

and your control amen we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight thank you musicians for once again surrendering your gifts if you have your Bibles I'd like to continue our study in the exposition of the seven Church ages and we are in the Ephesian Church age and that's found in the Book of Revelation chap 2 we'll just start reading with verse one once again and we'll read down to verse 7 it's amazing I believe we're on uh if I'm not mistaken this is number 20 of the study of the exposition of the seven Church ages and we're just about uh through the Ephesian Church age Revelations 2:1 says unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou CST not bear them which are evil and thou Hast tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and H has found them liars and Hast borne and Hast patience and for my name's sake has labored and Hast not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy First Love remember therefore whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy Candlestick out of his place except thou repent but this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of the nicians which I also hate he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord in our carnal Minds Lord we look forward to that day where we could sit under the shade of that tree of life Lord Jesus and eat of the fruit of that tree in the shade Lord knowing that we have no more sin no more Temptation no more sickness sadness sorrow or grief or problems Lord Jesus that day when we're in Paradise but father we know that this scripture applies to us in our day and that there is a tree of life and that Lord Jesus we don't need to wait to be in another dimension to pick and eat of that tree and tonight father our desire is to eat of that tree and father we pray that you would feed us from that tree One More Time Lord Jesus that father we would be able to just draw that much closer to you while we are here we love you and we thank you for your word Lord we know that you sent it to us and father you tied up all the loose ends for us in the day in which we live and we know that this word applies to us even today help us Lord Jesus we pray to overcome that we will eat of that tree even tonight father we just Commit This service now into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated I apologize if I cough a little I seem to be contending with a little tickle in my throat but that just seems to be the way it goes are you happy tonight hopefully that will be it once we get a little bit warmed upen I I uh certainly appreciate the scripture tonight and uh picking up where we left off last week um paragraph 123 it starts out with Revelations 2:7 the voice of the spirit is what brother Branham talks about in this book here and uh Revelations 2 verse 7 it says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the ch churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God he that hath an ear I just think it's so beautiful I took a little look at the Amplified Bible just to maybe give it a little bit of a parallel view tonight it says he who is able to hear let him listen to and give heed to what the spirit says to the assembly mes churches to him who overcomes is Victorious excuse me I will grant to eat of the fruit of the tree of life which is in the paradise of God isn't that just a wonderful thought in the Amplified Bible it takes you back to Genesis 2:9 and 3 verse 24 and we know that that was a time of perfection in Eden it was before the defil M of of man before the fall of Man but you know he that overcometh that's the one that's going to be able to be granted to eat from that tree of life and what do we have to overcome in our day brothers and sisters most of all being in the leoan church age the last age what we have to overcome is ourselves because we're rich compared to the world Maybe even compared to where we were when we were young many of us didn't have very much when we grew up even here in Calgary Rich increased with goods and have need of nothing but you know that is the curse of the leodan age because the Lord says that you don't know it but you're naked and you're blind and you're poor and you don't even know it you don't even know where you are a and we know we could go a long ways with with that the two on the road to emus Jesus the one they were following they recognized him his voice when he finally decided to reveal himself to them but outside of a revelation of God we will not be able to understand him and that's why I think it's so beautiful just a little bit of a recap here about the Deeds of the nicians we read it in the scripture tonight the Ephesian Church age they stood against those Apostles those people that called themselves Apostles but they were able to see that they were Liars and how does brother Bram say that he said they weren't in line with the word they wanted to substitute Holy Ghost leadership of the church with leadership of men they began to organize they began to say that we have to protect this word we have to organize and create an environment for it to thrive but what we don't understand when we get going down that road is it's a soft subtle spirit it's a nickan spirit that wants to gain control it wants to get a foothold in the church and try and start controlling things by man and push aside the leadership of the Holy Ghost and you know brothers and sisters that is not just exclusive to the Ephesian Church age that is very much alive and well today the nician spirit wants to control the church but as long as we're here I believe it it's a church full of Believers we're not going to give an inch to the devil we're not going to give him one iota of room to rule over the church it's going to be holy ghost leadership or none right we know that the church will actually disintegrate if it turns into the leadership of men and you know what will happen is it will mislead people before long what happens is that church WIll begin to follow suit with Rome and uh we'll get into that I I get a little bit ahead of myself here I apologize we've got Easter meetings this weekend with Brother David Dean har he's on the road he's driving here from Idaho and uh he left this morning so we'll have service Friday night we'll have uh service Saturday night and Sunday morning service and uh we certainly trust the Lord will bless our services April the 7th we have a special guest Minister that I'm real excited about and that is brother mvin Panetta he's going to take a Sunday morning service it's something that we talked about with the ministers and uh you know it's it's important for the ministry here in the body to be able to minister in in an environment that will give them the opportunity to thrive when we are ministers we have to be able to minister when we're musicians we have to be able to express the gift that God's given us and you know if we can't do that if we can't express the gift then it starts to become a little bit difficult so we're certainly excited to hear what the Lord has placed on brother mervin's heart April the 7th then we have brother Nest ESP penia from Philippines here April 20th and 21st there will be a 600 p.m. service Saturday night and 10:00 a.m. Sunday morning June the 2nd we have brother Dela adadon and he is a pastor from Nigeria certainly excited to see him again and uh greet him and hear what the Lord has placed on his heart we have uh another announcement that I wanted to bring and that is a a little bit of a Revival in Lethbridge and that's planned for April 12th 13th and 14th that's a Friday night service a Saturday and a Sunday and I believe there's going to be a one service on Friday three services on Saturday and one service on Sunday it seems the word of God is taking root in Lethbridge and there's some fairly stable solid Believers there and who knows what the Lord will continue to do there we want to continue trying to support the work there and just see what the Lord will do I've been invited to preach on the 12th which is Friday night um I believe a couple of the brothers are going to minister on Saturday as well as brother Jerry Fury from Spruce Grove and then brother Jerry Fury is also going to take the Sunday service there so pray for the meetings in Lethbridge pray for the people in Lethbridge and just see what the Lord will do there excuse me the other thing I want to mention is we have the uh regular prayer meetings now scheduled for the first Thursday of every month and that will be starting April the 4th and we'll just continue on with that sorry about the announcements getting in the way of the word um I just get excited about the word and forget the business side of things so Hallelujah I apologize you know uh just a little bit of a recap like we were talking about the seed of nianis from the uh the last few chapters that we read the last few paragraphs we know that uh the nicians the word comes from two Greek words it's naika which means to conquer and lay us which means the leoty brother Bram says in plain fact somebody was doing something in that early church which was Conquering the leoty if the leoty were being conquered then it must have been some Authority there doing it and and we know that that's what God hated he hated that the leadership of the Holy Spirit was pushed pushed aside and they decided to organize and and bring man and to actually try and and get it together but the word of God doesn't need men to defend it you know just going back a little bit it's uh paragraph 95 actually 94 I'll read 94 I just wanted to recap on this just just because it's very important brother bromy says but as usual people don't heed God's warning that Revival fire built upon the sacred word is so wonderful and the manifestation of the spirit so blessed the little that a little fear Creeps in and a whisper in the heart says how can we protect this truth we have what can we do to see this revival goes on and he says this is vital brothers and sisters that is when the Antichrist Spirit comes in and Whispers look you have the truth now see that it doesn't get lost organize and set up your Creed of what you believe put it all in a church manual and they do it they organize they add to the word and they die just like Eve did for taking one wrong word it's God's word that brings life and it's not what we say about the word that counts but it's what God Said and he said only believe only believe that's all we need to do I just think it's so beautiful because brother Bram in the beginning of this book he says if you can identify the Antichrist spirit that creeps into the framework of the what the Christian church if you can discern and withstand that Spirit then Satan will be powerless before you who doesn't want Satan to be powerless tonight I just think it's so amazing we've been given this key this opportunity to go forwards I just want to read paragraph 111 um he brother bam he says this now I want to say that I believe in leadership he he he talks so strongly in the previous paragraphs this is what we read last week about the leadership of man over the church and now he brings the balance he says now I want to say that I believe in leadership but it's not the leadership of men that I believe in I believe in the leadership of the Holy Ghost coming through the word amen I believe also that God has sent men in the church men who are gifted by the spirit and they will keep the church in order I believe that I believe also that the church is ruled over by men that God sends to take charge but that rule is by the word so that it's not men really ruling but the spirit of God for the word and spirit are one I think it's just important for us brothers and sisters to remember that we can easily have an idea we can have a tradition we can have a thought that we we think is actually the way things should be but you know if it's not by the word I want to say this clearly I'm not interested and I don't think any one of us should be if it's not according to the word of God even though we've got a tradition or an idea a thought comes to us you know we have many thoughts that come to us we've got to be willing to take it back to the word and if that thought doesn't line up with the word what do we need to do put it aside we just need to push it aside and not take it and and try and put ourselves in a position where we just need to be right when we do that that's the same thing that Satan had in him from the beginning iniquity was found in his heart and what happens when we don't actually accept correction by the word of God it's pride in our life it's just Pride that gets in the way if we're truly Believers of this word then we will line up every single word of this word in in our lives we will not make substitutes we won't make excuses we'll say be it unto me according to Thy word carrying on tonight the voice of the spirit Revelations 2:7 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God what do we have to overcome we've got to overcome the Antichrist Spirit we've got to overcome the the the leoan age we've got to overcome many different things in our lives but honestly I think the biggest thing that we've talked about in the past and you know brother Don has mentioned it as well the biggest thing that we've got to overcome is ourselves to Humble ourselves in front of this word and how do we humble ourselves in front of this word how do we humble ourselves in the sight of God so that he can lift us up we humble ourselves before one another Jesus told his disciples how will the world know that you have love for me how do you love me you could say you love me all you want but your love life is going to show where you stand with that it's when you love one another that's when you show the world that's where the rubber meets the road that's the brass tax of it all when you can love those who don't love you when you can love your enemy even your enemy and say my goodness I I know that I had a prophet of God isn't it a blessing to think that we had a prophet we can say that we had a prophet many people will say oh the prophet now you're getting crazy and and I know we're talking to Believers here tonight but there's a lot of people that are watching these online now and when you talk about Prophet it's a bit weird because of all the false prophets that have gone out into the world and we know that scripture scripture says there's going to be many false prophets that go out they're ravening wolves dressed in sheep's clothing and what they've done is they've made a mess of it they've made people so afraid of the word Prophet that they will never go near anyone that talks about Prophet that declares prophet but a true prophet of God is always going to have thus sayith the Lord aren't they and that thus sayith the Lord is going to point back to the scripture he's going to say repent and get back to the word of God don't get back to your church Creeds or your Traditions he's going to say that but isn't it wonderful that we had a prophet we have a prophet a prophet that came and got us back to the word gave us the ability to be able to say my goodness I just want to line up with that word because I know that he actually went beyond the curtain of time twice once was to see the regions of the Lost he deliberately not deliberately he inadvertently went there God allowed him to go there when he got shot by that Shotgun by his friend the one time and he said I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy but we've been given the opportunity to see beyond the curtain of time to recognize there was a bunch of people that actually said my precious brother that word that you preached that word that you you preached is what Paul preached and we're resting on that that is what our souls are hanging on and you know many people will say it I've I've heard it said you people believe this you people I heard it said specifically one time you people believe that there shouldn't be you know you guys believe that there shouldn't be women preachers and I said hold on a second hold on a second about you guys you people shouldn't believe that there shouldn't be women preachers that's not just what we say and that's not just what William bradam said that's what Paul said amen how can we believe the word of God and negate what Paul said if we start snipping out parts of the word what part are we going to keep we know that Revelation says that one word added to and one word taken away then all the plagues of this book will be added unto you we just want to stay in line with the word the voice of the spirit he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches not what men say not what churches say not what traditions say let's hear what the spirit says to the church brother bradam says in paragraph 123 he that hath an ear let them hear what the spirit saith unto the churches it may be that Millions will hear these words or read them but how many will pay heed to them that we do not know but he who will lend his ear and want to know the words of truth will find the spirit of God enlightening him amen if your ear is open to the word the spirit of God will make the word real to you and that's so beautiful it doesn't have to be real to everyone else just has to be real to me just has to be real to you it has to be personal and we know that's what the new birth is Christ himself revealing himself personally to the individual he says now that is a work of the spirit I can teach you the truth but if you don't open if you don't open your ear to hear it and your heart to receive it you won't get the revelation now notice it says that the spirit is speaking to the churches that is plural not singular the spirit did not have John write this down for a local Ephesian Church nor for the first age only this is what we were talking about last week it's for all the ages but this is the Church of the beginnings and thus it is like the Book of Genesis what started in Genesis holds true throughout the entire word and finally closes in Revelation thus this church beginning in Acts is God's blueprint for all ages until she closes out in the leoan age I I'm just so thankful I'm going to go back to that I just feel so encouraged by it don't you feel encouraged by it to know there is an anchor Point there's one place that we can go back to and it's the word of God to say this Ephesian Church age is the blueprint get back to Pentecost that's all we need to do not not try and have signs and wonders and make that all happen just follow the word amen get upstairs in that upper room until wait until you're unded with power from on high brother bradam says watch it carefully let every age take heed for what is going on here is only the start that little tree that was planted is going to grow it is grow going to grow Through the Ages this then is a message for every Christian through every age until Jesus comes yes it is for it is the spirit speaking amen and this little tree that's growing I just think it's interesting because you know it's the seed of nianis is what brother bram's talking about that's the tree that's growing it's the rulership over the church it's substituting the the power for programs it's saying that we need to organize and protect this word and try and do something with this word we don't have to do anything with this word except for believe it and preach it the way it was spoken The Way It Was Written God will do the rest but we can easily start getting in his way the reward promised paragraph 125 to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God this is the future reward to all Overcomers of all ages when the last call to battle has been sounded when our armor has been laid down then we will rest in the paradise of God God and our portion shall be the tree of life forever amen the tree of life isn't that a beautiful figure of speech it's mentioned three times in the Book of Genesis and three times in the Book of Revelation in all six places it is the same tree and symbolizes exactly the same thing yes but what is the Tree of Life well first of all all we would have to know what the tree of life it the tree itself stands for in numbers 24:6 as balum described Israel he said there were trees of line allows which the Lord hath planted trees throughout the scriptures refer to persons as in Psalms 1 thus the Tree of Life must be the person of life and that is Jesus now in the Garden of Eden there were two trees standing in the midst of it one was the tree of life and the other was the tree of knowledge of good and evil man was to live by the tree of life but he was not to touch the other tree or he would die but man did partake of the other tree and when he did Death entered into him by his sin and he became separated from God I just love this part I got to tell you this this this part of the church age book is just so rich you know the the world ecumenical council the the churches in North America they turned their back on William brandham for this Doctrine when he started preaching this loud and clear without reservation they said oh no no no no now he's gone off on his Doctrine now he's off his rocker he he's he's fallen off his trolley there's something wrong with this man because who who would ever be able to say these words and and have the word of God line up with that but we know that it takes a revelation but when you can actually see what he's talking about here something happens inside of you you can never go back you can never unsee this Revelation paragraph 129 now that tree back there in Eden that tree which was the source of life was Jesus in John 6-8 Jesus sets himself forth as the source of eternal life he called himself the bread from Heaven he spoke of giving himself and that if a man ate of him he would never die he proclaimed that he knew Abraham and that before Abraham he was he prophesied that he himself would give them Living Waters that if man drank he would never thirst again but would live eternally he showed himself as The Great I Am he is the bread of life The Well of Life The Eternal one the tree of life and we know that in his day the people said Naturally Speaking you know it was against the law of Moses goodness sakes eat your flesh and drink your blood this guy's crazy he's a vampire but we know that's what we did Sun night not literally but the figurative we had communion he goes on to say he was back there in Eden in the midst of the garden even as he will be in the midst of the paradise of God some have an idea that the two trees in the garden were just two more trees like unto the rest of those that God had placed there but careful students know that this is not so when John the Baptist cried that the axe was laid to the root of all trees he was not talking of Simply natural trees but of spiritual principles now in first John it says and this is the record that God hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son this is 1 John 511 Jesus said and ye will not and ye will not come to me that ye might have life John 540 thus the record God's word States plainly and clearly that life eternal life is in the sun it's no other place 1 John 5:12 he that hath the son hath life he that hath not the Son of God hath not life paragraph 132 now since the record cannot change be taken from or added there unto then the record stands that life is in the sun since this is so the tree in the garden has to be Jesus amen paragraph 133 all right if the tree of life is a person then the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is a person also it can't be otherwise thus the righteous one and the wicked one stood side by side there in the midst of the Garden of Eden I just love the way that he writes this again he takes it right back to the scripture well how can you say that he was in the Garden of Eden Ezekiel 2813 thou Satan Hast been in Eden the Garden of Eden so what was he doing there in that Garden what was his purpose I'm sure that he lived a a purpose-filled life he had a a real driven experience he was created for a purpose yes paragraph 134 here is where we receive the true revelation of the Serpent's Seed here was what really happened in the Garden of Eden the word says that Eve was beguiled by the serpent she was actually seduced by the serpent and this is where I could say you know you can even ask Google just type in original sin see what comes up it won't be long before you're blushing now I'm not recommending that you do it just for the record children don't go do it but it's the way the world is the whole world knows what this is Genesis 3:1 now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made so we know it's a beast right we know he's created by God and we know that he's very very subtle a real Slicker paragraph 135 this Beast was so close to a human being and yet was pure animal that he could reason and talk he was an upright creature and was somewhat in between a chimpanzee and a man but closer to a man now outside of a prophet who's talking like this who is saying these words but taking it back to the scripture not just coming up with it and pulling it out of out of thin air he goes on to say he was so close to being human that his seed could and did mingle with that of the woman and caused her to conceive when this happened God cursed the serpent he changed every bone in the Serpent's body so that he had to crawl like a snake I remember having a conversation on the way to Kenya one time when you fly on a plane and long trips like that and you get seated by people you can have some pretty in-depth conversations you're there for seven or eight hours excluding taxi delays and and this one fellow he was from Kenya we got talking about this he was religious he was very well studied he knew his Bible but I had to ask him I said why was the serpent cursed to be the serpent why was the snake cursed to be a snake how could that be a curse how could he go from crawling on his belly and eating dust to crawling on his belly and eating dust as a curse there has to be more to that whole entire scripture brother Bram says when this happened God cursed the serpent he changed every bone on the Serpent's body so that he had to crawl like a snake science can try all it wants to and won't find the missing link how many years has science had to try and find that Missing Link and we know the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil ain't going to bring this Doctrine he's not going to bring this to the laboratory and say well this is actually what happened the serpent wasn't actually a snake the serpent was an upright being and and their seed mingled with Eve seed he's not going to bring that to the scientific community and broadcast that all around the world because it's going to expose Satan and he don't want to be exposed he wants to be just like God he wants to be just like like Jesus worshiped and we know that he is being worshiped he goes on to say God saw to that man is smart and he can see an association of man with animal and he tries to prove it out of evolution there isn't any Evolution but man and animal did mingle that's the one of the Mysteries that God that one of the mysteries of God that has remained hidden but here it is revealed it happened right back there in the midst of Eden when Eve turned away from life to accept death notice what God said to them in the garden Genesis 3:15 and I will put enity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head excuse me and shall bruise his heel I just think this is is fascinating here paragraph 136 if we give credit to the word that the woman did have a seed then the serpent must have shedly had a seed also if the seed of the woman was a Manchild apart from the man then the seed of the serpent will have to be in the same pattern and that is another male must be born apart from human male instrumentally there's no student who does not know that by the seed of the woman was the Christ sorry there's no student who does not know that the seed of the woman was the Christ who came by the instrumentality of God apart from Human intercourse it's also just as well known that the predicted bruising of the Serpent's head was in actuality a prophecy concerning what Christ would accomplish against Satan at the cross there at the cross Christ would bruise the head of Satan while Satan would bruise the heel of the Lord this portion of scripture is the revelation of how the literal seed of the serpent was sown in the earth even as we have the account of Luke 1 26-35 where in is set forth the exact account of how the seed of the woman came into physical manifestation apart from the instrumentality of the human male and we can read that Luke 1 126 to35 excuse me so beautiful it's the same type as the believer today when the Lord comes around he he says in Luke uh 1:26 and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin a spouse to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou that art highly favored the Lord is with the with thee blessed art thou among women remember the woman is the church female is the church and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and remember this was an angel messenger from the presence of God bringing this word to her and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus it's a new birth being born again the life that we display to the world around us is Jesus and if it's not Jesus then we're not born again he shall be great and he shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this thing be see I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God so beautiful paragraph 138 as the seed of the woman was literally God reproducing himself in human flesh so the seed of the serpent is the literal way that Satan found he was able to open the door to himself into the human race it was impossible for Satan for he is only a created spirit being to reproduce himself in the manner which God reproduced himself so the Genesis account tells how he reproduced his seed and introduced or or injected himself into the human race also recall that Satan is called the serpent it is his seed or injection into the human race we are speaking of before Adam ever had carnal knowledge of Eve the serpent had that knowledge ahead of him and that one born of it was Cain Cain was born Cain sorry Cain was of born of begotten of that Wicked one 1 John 3:12 the holy spirit in John could not in one place call Adam the wicked one for that is what he would be if he fathered Cain and in another place call Adam the Son of God which he was by creation Luke 3:38 Cain turned out in character like his father a bringer of death a murderer I I I think it's interesting how brother Bram says this here this part it really stands out to me and I think it does to Anyone who reads this here he says his utter Defiance of God when faced by the almighty in Genesis 4: 591 13 and 14 where he he talks to him and says where's your brother what happened to him and he's just absolutely abolutely defiant to God that's right showed him to be absolutely unhuman likee in characteristics seeming to even surpass any account we have in scripture concerning a confrontation of Satan by God here's the scriptures that we just mentioned but unto Cain and to his offering he had no respect and Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell and the the Lord said unto Cain where is Abel thy brother and he said I know not am I My Brother's Keeper he's a murderer and a liar the father of all lies and Cain said unto the Lord my punishment is greater than I can bear behold thou Hast driven me out this day from the face of the Earth and from thy face shall I be hid and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that everyone that findeth me shall slay me now if you were to go on we're not going to get too far into this tonight but I think it's interesting because right after he said that it says in the word of God that God set a what a mark upon this person upon this created being and and this is the mark of the beast he was given a mark paragraph 140 notice the exact way the record of God sets forth the account of the births of Cain Abel and Seth this is so beautiful if you look at this closely you can see the truth here Genesis 4: 1-2 and Adam knew his wife and we know no is an intimate relation it's not just I I met her somewhere along the way God just introduced her to him and that's what happened to know is actually an intimate relation and Adam knew his wife and she conceived and bear Cain and said I have begotten a man from the Lord and she again bear his brother Abel but she didn't know him again Genesis 4:25 and Adam knew his wife again and she bare a son and called his name Seth paragraph 141 there are three sons born of two acts of carnal knowledge by Adam since the Bible is the exact and perfect word of God this is no mistake but a record for our elimination our elimination since three sons were born from two acts by Adam you know positively that one of those three was not the son of Adam and and it could be a stretch to say well there was two acts and it was only that he knew her two times but why would it say that he knew her two times and not three if the word of God is going to say it twice why wouldn't it say it Thrice why wouldn't it say he knew her three times but we can say you know that's the infallible truth but that's not the infallible truth I would say because there has to be a character there has to be an identification of a nature of an individual like we've talked about having the Holy Ghost we can say we got the Holy Ghost all day long but if we're not in line with the word of God do we got the Holy Ghost we could have an anointing of the Holy Ghost we're not talking about that we want to see the indwelling of the person of Jesus Christ Living out through us and when that happens there will be an infallible direction to the word of God we will never deviate from the word of God if we got the Holy Ghost because he can't deny himself but he says God has recorded this in this exact manner to show us something and what I want to say tonight brothers and sisters before we get into this is the word super fication super fundation it's a long word it is a real word you can look it up in Wikipedia and I would recommend it check it out show your families show your friends and see if what we're talking about here isn't actually in the scientific laboratory but not advertised goes on to say in paragraph 142 the truth of the matter is that Eve had in her womb two sons twins from separate impregnations she was carrying twins with Cain's conception sometime previous to that of Abel's when I first heard this I'll be honest with you I thought it's a stretch it's a stretch but then as I started to grow and learn I I started to say wow wow wow wow it's possible right and you know I actually saw it I followed the news pretty closely for a while I remember seeing it in the US there was actually a lawsuit in the past decade where there was actually somebody going for child support a woman having two babies from two separate acts two separate fathers but two eggs in one cycle is what happens the truth of the matter is that even her womb had two sons twins from separate impregnations she was carrying twins with Cain's conception sometime previous to that of Abel's see those twins again perfect type as always every Revival produces twins that's what brother bradam says paragraph 143 to those who think that this is not possible let it be known that in the medical records are replete with cases where women have carried twins who were of separate OVA and separate insemination with the fertilization of the eggs being days apart and not only so but some of the records show the Twins were fed by separate males paragraph 144 recently worldwide coverage was given to a nor Norwegian mother who is suing her husband for support for herself and her twins one of which was White and the other black she admitted that she had a negro lover the two conceptions were about 3 weeks apart in Bowmont Texas in 1963 the records again set forth multiple birth were in pregnancies were many days apart in fact so much so that the women almost died along with with one child and child birth now why did this have to be so he says why was it that the seed of the serpent must come this way Man was created for God man was to be the temple of God the place of God's rest the Holy Spirit was man the temple acts 7:46 to 51 who found favor before God and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of Jacob but Solomon built him a house how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol what house will ye build me sayeth the Lord or excuse me what is the place of my rest hath not my hand made all these things ye stiff neck and uncircumcised in heart and ears ye do always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did so do ye I just want to mention something in here two separate fathers I looked it up this afternoon just I just had to super fundation fondation super fundation out of Wikipedia heteropaternal there is one called heteropaternal super fundation is a form of atypical twin twinning where genetically the twins are half siblings sharing the same mother but with different fathers this was this afternoon current Wikipedia words pretty amazing it's right there if you want to look for it paragraph 146 Satan has known this all along he also wants to indwell man even as God so does but God has reserved to himself that right isn't that beautiful Satan cannot do that God Alone appeared in human flesh Satan could not and cannot do that he does not have creative Powers the only way for Satan to accomplish what he wanted to do was to enter the serpent in Eden even as he entered by evil spirits into the swine at gadera and we know that was where the m Maniac was and Jesus delivered him from it and the demons that were in that man said have you come unto us before the time they recognized who he was but we know the most religious people of the day they couldn't recognize him as the son of man it's interesting the Devils knew who he was but God does not enter animals but Satan can and will to accomplish his ends he could not have a child directly by Eve as did God by Mary so he entered into the serpent and then beguiled Eve he seduced her and by her did Satan have a child vicariously Cain bore the full spiritual characteristics of Satan and the animalistic sensual fleshy characteristic of the serpent no wonder the holy spirit said that Cain was of that Wicked one he was that's right now I want to go in into some certain proof we have that there is a definite Affinity between man and animal it is a physical thing do you know that you can take the embrio cells from an unborn fetus and inject them into human beings then those thyroid cells will go right to the human thyroid the kidney cells will go right to the human kidneys do you realize how stupendous this is some intelligence guides those animal cells exactly to the right place that intelligence accepts those cells and puts them in exactly the right place there is an affinity between animal and man they can't intermingle and reproduce that has been tried but back in the garden that intermingling did take place and the chemical Affinity which still exists proves it for back in Eden the serpent was an upright creature it's just so amazing when you see this when you hear this it gives us the ability to to really understand he was so close to man he was almost man Satan took advantage of the Serpent's physical characteristics to use him to beguile Eve then God destroyed that pattern of the the serpent no other Beast can co-mingle with man but the Affinity is there isn't it amazing to think that this was no accidents God didn't create man and and create the serpent and create the garden and put the trees in the garden and go through all of his efforts and then suddenly he was surprised and put off and and shocked there was a great uh maybe a a a council an emergency Council was called in heaven that that this thing happened with the serpent God knew full well when he created The Serpent and and I think brother bradam even says it somewhere in the message that this serpent was all man with the exception of a soul just like an animal he was a beast he he was a beast of the field that's what the word says the serpent was the most subtle beast of the field he was an upright creature man paragraph 149 now that we have come this far let me try to Crystal I ize your thinking on this subject so you can see the necessity of our going into the serpent Seed doctrine as I have we start with the fact that there were two trees in the midst of the garden tree of life was Jesus the other tree is definitely Satan because of what came forth of the fruit of that tree remember we talked about a little while ago that's how we know them you know them by their fruits by your fruits you shall know them is what Jesus said right bam goes on to say now then we know that both of these trees had a relationship to man or they would never have been placed there they must have had a part in The Sovereign plan and purpose of God in their relationship to Mankind and to himself or we could never impute omniscience unto God this is all true so far is it not now the word most definitely sets forth that from before the foundation of the Earth the purpose of God was to share his eternal life with man Ephesians 1:4 to11 according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time we might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will I just think it's so beautiful you know there was a a time where Jesus was asking the disciples it just comes to mind as we read the second last verse here out of Ephesians there was a time where Jesus said what what are people saying that I am who do people say that I am to the disciples some say Elias some say a prophet some say Jeremiah some say a good man a teacher a rabbi and he said you know that's good that's good that they're saying that but who do you say that I am who do you say and we know that it was in that moment that Peter he had something welling up in his heart that he couldn't contain anymore and he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and we know that Jesus God in flesh he said to him Peter you need to understand that Flesh and Blood hasn't revealed this to you and everyone else around us listening to this no man has taught this man those words this guy he got those words from his heart and that actually came from God it wasn't given to him by flesh and blood but by the spirit it was God himself that revealed this this Revelation to him and you know brothers and sisters there is a time where the things which are in heaven and the things which are in Earth are actually going to gather together all in Christ and I believe that's what's happening as we live according to this word for our day as we say Amen to this word something is taking place we're eating of that tree of life that tree that we heard that's in the midst of the garden we're actually becoming that tree Revelations 13:8 and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship him Satan whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world and we know that's the Lamb's Book of Life and no man put names on that book and no man can take names off that book because the only one that put names in that book is God himself that wasn't created somewhere along the way throughout time and space throughout history this was before the foundation of the world that that book was written God himself wrote that book and our names are in there brothers and sisters it's so beautiful paragraph 151 but that life could not and would not be shared in any other way than through the way of God manifest In the Flesh this was part of his eternal and predestinated purpose this plan was to be to the praise of the glory of his grace it was the Plan of Redemption it was the Plan of Salvation he says now listen closely God being a savior it was necessary that he predestinate a man who would require salvation in order to give himself a reason and purpose of being that is 100% correct and multitudes of scripture bear it out as does this very pointed verse in Romans 11:36 for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen I'll call the musicians as we close here brother Bram in paragraph 152 man could not directly come and partake of that tree of life in the midst of the garden that eternal life of the tree had to become flesh first but before God could raise and save a sinner he had to have a sinner to raise and save man had to fall The Fall which would be caused by Satan had to have flesh to make fall Satan had to come through flesh also but Satan could not come through human flesh to make the fall as would Christ come in human flesh to restore the Fallen but there was an animal the serpent so close to man that Satan could get to that beast and through that Beast he could get into human flesh and cause the fall and inject himself thereby into the human race even as Jesus would one day come and inject himself into the human race into human bodies even to the extent of a resurrection wherein we will have bodies like unto his glorified one I'm going to stop reading there tonight I believe that's uh a real headful of reading we'll pick up next Wednesday Lord willing but you know I just I just think it's so beautiful brothers and sisters to recognize that there had to be a fall there had to be a man to fall there had to be someone to fulfill that name that was written in the book of the life of the Lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world there had to be someone that was going to actually fulfill that and it's just a amazing thing when we look at our lives I look at my life and I think about all of the afflictions all of The Temptations all of the attributes of this flesh I can just see the Beast nature I don't know about you if you can see that in your own life but if you can just recognize it's not your fault you were trapped into it you never did it in the first place you are in his mind before the foundation of the world to actually be his inheritance many times we talk about our inheritance but brothers and sisters he has an inheritance and that's his life in each and every one of his sons and daughters and he ain't going to lose one God bless you tonight let's just stand as we close in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your goodness and your mercy to us thank you for the many Revelations that you've given to us Lord we know that outside of revelation we would be lost as lost can be and we know that men can read men can speak men can teach men can even learn and be studied we can earn our way through that mentality through that method but it truly takes a revelation from you Lord Jesus to bring this word to life in the hearts of your children and tonight father I pray that the words that were spoken father would just grow and manifest in our lives that we would consider our lives and how you gave us the opportunity to to step aside from this flesh for a moment that we could read that there is a place there is a Time coming where we will no longer have to deal with this flesh with this Earthly nature that we contend with where there's sickness where there's death where there's anxiety where there's fear where there's frustration and anger Lord those are all attributes We Know It of this this serpent this Beast Adam and Eve never had one ounce of fear in the garden before they fell Lord Jesus we long for that day and we're so thankful that you've given us the ability to to to glimpse into what it will be like that one day father when we get those new glorified bodies oh Father and we live out through the Millennium A Thousand Years where you let your bride exist without Temptation with a glorified body and father we'll look upon Satan narrowly and say are you the one that tempted all the nations you're the one that caus the fall in the garden oh Father we so thank you for your goodness and your mercy to us Lord let us never ever reserve the praise that you have placed in our hearts for you Lord we just ask now that you would go with us as we go our separate ways that you would keep your hand upon each one father be with those who couldn't be here tonight father we pray that you would just strengthen and encourage them Lord maybe those who are listening tonight father that you would just Lord God just manifest in their lives Lord strengthen and encourage them whoever is watching father we love you and we thank you we just commit each life into your hands now for your glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen it is so sweet to trust in [Music] Jesus amen it sure is is so sweet to trust in Jesus Jesus just to take him at his word just to rest upon his
