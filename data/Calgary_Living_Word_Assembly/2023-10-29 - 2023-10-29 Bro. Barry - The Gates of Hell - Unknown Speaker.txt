visiting thank you for the special that was wonderful amen God certainly gave you a gift hey brother it's wonderful when you can use it for a blessing for the body for the glory of the Lord just like to read from Matthew Matthew chapter 16 just uh a few verses here we'll start with verse 13 when Jesus came into the coast of cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am amen and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist Sam elas and others jeremias or one of the prophets and he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock will I build my church church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it amen let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your word thank you that you've given it to us as an eternal sign father that Lord we know that heaven's and Earth will pass away but this word will remain and father we pray that it would just be more than words that we speak we pray that it would even be more than words that we hear pray that it would be our very life that it wouldn't be our life Lord but your life living out through US father that we would truly be a Living Word father that it wouldn't be a church that we attend but it would be you living out through US father we just Commit This service into your hands each one father who has gathered together here whether it's virtual or recorded or in person right now we just ask all these things things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated just a couple of announcements um hadn't said anything yet but I will now I just want to clarify bear with me for a second here yes okay so we have very verified that uh August 17th 16th 17th and 18th 2024 we have Andrew Glover booked he will be here so the 16th the 17th and the 18th last time we had two services this time we'll have three so if you want maybe just Mark that in your calendars we'll have it on the church calendar but I wanted to make sure that we confirmed that's confirmed we will have uh our second annual meetings with brother Andrew Glover are you happy this morning amen we will have a gym night on Tuesday night it's for those people who want something to do with their children on the night when uh everyone runs around and celebrates the devil we're going to get together as Believers and just have a little bit of fun so that will be Tuesday night if you have any questions about where and when just let us know and we'll certainly make sure you have that information we have a communion service booked for November the 12th so you can cancel that in as well if you would like talking about our scripture this morning I just felt so inspired after our Wednesday service I I just I'm so excited to continue on I wanted to get into the church AG book this morning but I feel like I just want to keep that to Wednesdays but it's going to spill over there's no way around it it's the word of God and I hope it's okay today I want to talk about the gates of hell we touched on it a little bit on on Wednesday and it's so important for us to recognize that this world basically the way it's set up civilization is of the devil is what the prophet for our day said and I would say that even more so than just the prophet for our day said that that's what God Said through the prophet is that Civilization is of the devil and we know we don't have to look very far in Genesis the Book of Genesis that it wasn't it wasn't uh Seth and his company his people his family that went ahead and created civilization they were sheep herders they were farmers they actually lived their lives differently but it was Cain's race that went out and started to build cities so when we look around at this world we can say this world is the kingdom of Satan and we know that the prophet for our day declared this is the only age where Satan is declared the God of this evil age and because of that I just want to say it this way we can look at everything that's in this world outside of the message of the hour outside of the word of God I'll say it this way the wise virgins and the Oswin virgins the 144,000 over in Israel even right now today outside of those this whole world is a Gate of Hell this whole world is set up to draw people to hell that's the reason why the world is in the condition that it's in there's nothing else that's going to take people to Heaven except for this message of the hour a and those people that maybe have the ability to give their life because they refus this message of the hour seal their own testimony with their own blood because that's what's going to take place the next steps are the Rapture of the Church of the Living God the the the the foolish virgin the unwise Virgin is going to be left here and they're going to have to give their lives for their testimony right because they refused the word for their day and then the 144,000 those little Benjamins were where Joseph cried out remember he cried out for only one thing it was to find out about about Benjamin and when he heard that Benjamin still was alive he cried out so loud that the house of of Egypt heard him the house of pharaoh heard him crying wondering why what's wrong with this guy it was the passion his love for those 144,000 and it's going to be the same thing I know I'm mixing the two together but it's just where I'm at this morning I just I think it's so in incredible to look at the where we're at in the sands of time brothers and sisters my there's not much time left yes so I just want to say today I want to talk about the gates of hell but we can say it this way many people talk about the message of the hour and and many people talk about God sent a prophet and many people talk maybe even today about Joseph Bram and maybe Billy Paul Bram and all that there is to have to do with the Brams that's that's that's good and I believe that's that's potentially similar to our scripture today where we could say you know God sent a prophet and and we could say God's Prophet had a family and and they had a great ministry and they did so much for the body of Christ but who do you say this message of the hour is that's what I want to say today who do you say this message of the hour declares because if it declares a prophet then we've missed the point the prophet came to declare he's here not that he's coming that he's here and he's not going to be coming right until Revelations 19 and that's when every eye will see him and even those who pierced him of the House of Israel that's not the Rapture Revelations 19 if that's what we're looking towards then we've missed what's going on right now just like in Jesus day how many people recognize that he was Messiah how many people recognize that he was truly God in flesh that's right very very few people and even his disciples didn't recognize it only one out of 12 was able to say thou art the Christ the son of the Living God Amen but what is it that Jesus said to him he said oh first we're going to change your name you're no longer going to be called Simon barjona you're going to be called Peter right because Upon This Rock we're going to build the foundation of the church and the Gates of Hell aren't going to be able to prevail against it we'll get into this on on Wednesday I'm sure it it'll be just a blending like I've said but you know how brother bam talks about in the church age book The Church wants to put it on on on Peter being the rock the foundation of the church and they're missing what's happened in the scripture they're not reading between the lines and the only way we're going to read between the lines is to have spiritual Revelation the only way we're going to have spiritual Revelation is to get the Holy Ghost in our lives without the Holy Ghost this is just going to be another book it's just going to be H H maybe stories and and maybe some some enlight lightening words and we'll say my goodness it's a tremendous thing but it's a hard saying who can actually live that but boy once we get the Holy Ghost In Our Lives then we're going to say my it becomes a living word and I can see that word is coming to life in my life and you know what maybe I don't see exactly what I want to see in my life but I know I don't see all the things that I used to see in my life so we have an opportunity to say praise God I know I'm on a journey amen and remember brothers and sisters we're in a one room Schoolhouse here everyone is at a different level spiritually speaking some people are spiritual Giants right and some people are babes in Christ and you know what we're not going to judge anyone the spiritual Giants I want to say this this is just maybe my view forgive me if it seems to be a little too far but I believe the spiritual Giants should be the ones that are picking up the ones that are stumbling and falling down and saying hey let me give you a hand let me give you a help up let me help you along the way way because I can see that you're struggling not judging them and saying oh my they should be doing this differently look at those people why do they behave that way that's not the spirit of Christ it's only by grace that we're saved through faith and if we have that Faith to be safe then we have the faith to be healed amen but what's what's the most important healing that we could ever have brothers and sisters it's not this flesh this flesh has to perish this flesh has to go this flesh is our enemy this flesh is not ever going to do us any good the greatest healing that we could ever have is the healing of our soul this word for this day applied in our lives amen but I just think it's beautiful Jesus speaking here God speaking in flesh we know that Jesus was all of the godhead made bodily amen the entirety of God in flesh Amen in front of man speaking to man man so that men could comprehend just a little fraction but he said blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter so remember he's given him a name change and Upon This Rock I will build my church and so that's where the church is that's the Baseline that's the that's the foundation of it a and we're not going to say it like the Catholic Church would say that that that that the church would God would build his church on a a foundation of a man who would be so unstable that he would Curse God and lie while he did it the church isn't built on a man on this flesh that has to perish on a hybrid condition the church isn't built on that it's the rock of Revelation amen it's the rock of Revelation that the church is built upon and what is that rock of Revelation it's Christ God himself making himself known personally to the individual but I want to say it this way I want to bring it home a little further than that brothers and sisters we're too far along the road to say that you know I was saved back in 1953 and and that's good I'm saved I I I know that I've met God back there I had an experience and it was great and and now I just come to church and I just Skip Along the water I'm being told Maybe by the church or I'm being towed Maybe by someone else's experience and maybe it's a husband and wife maybe the wife is Towing the husband and maybe the husband is just Towing the wife maybe the church is just toing both brothers and sisters it's not about that at all it's about having that constant refreshing of the Holy Ghost in our lives where he's talking to us every day of Our Lives where we're having our own spiritual Revelation every single day where that rock of Revelation is fresh every single day in our lives and I think it's beautiful because why did he use that expression that if we don't cry out then the rocks will immediately cry out maybe it's those rocks of Revelation in the hearts of the Believers that just can't contain it I recognize what he's done for me it's only by his grace that I'm saved but it's that rock of Revelation that did it for Peter and where did that rock of Revelation come from that came from God Amen came from God directly to him and Jesus being God in flesh saying hey hey you know what that that actually didn't come from man no teacher taught you that no school taught you that your parents no tradition nothing outside of a supernatural revelation God spoke to your heart directly Peter a and and changed your name in doing it amen such a beautiful thought you know brother bradam I I a lot of the message today I guess that I got inspired by was possessing the Gate of the enemy after trial in 1964 4 it's 0322 possessing the Gate of the enemy after trial and you know thinking about the gates of hell and how the Gates of Hell want to try and Prevail against us they definitely do or Jesus wouldn't have said those words that wouldn't have been recorded in the Bible that the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it and you know it's not going to not Prevail against a church it's not going to not Prevail against a family teaching or or an ideology or even a pet Doctrine it's not going to do any of that it's not going to Prevail against that personal relationship with Jesus Christ and that's why we have to have the Holy Ghost in our lives a continual renewing and we can say just like David said this is the refreshing every single day when we go on our knees this is the refreshing every single time we come to church and we worship we have the opportunity to worship we're going to say this is the refreshing this is something that I need in my life it just washes me it's the preaching of the word but brother and sisters it's also being able to worship God freely there's millions of people around the world that would love to be able to raise their hands and cl raise their hands and and and Shout with their voice and clap their hands and sing rejoicing Praises unto the Lord Jesus Christ as a Christian yes and we have the ability to do it amen it's amazing to think you know I just I just uh I look this up Strong's gate uh g443 n and and maybe it's a little bit much for me to do this but I I just sometimes I like to look into it and and it says the a gate that is the leaf or wing of a folding entrance pretty simple isn't it and we know that that's how Gates operate they open they close a and and how can a gate Prevail the only way that a gate can Prevail is that it will either stop us from going in or that it will open to us and allow us to go in that's the only thing a gate can do it's is not going to be able to do anything else but it's it's the leaf or wing of a folding entrance and I couldn't help but think just maybe my way of thinking but the leaf or a wing of a folding entrance to think about those fallen angels that potentially had wings they want to open their their entrance and try and draw many people in with them to know that that they're going to actually have a little bit of success but to the Believers there's no success to the unbelievers there's a tremendous success so to make Believers it's kind of uh it's kind of Hit or Miss but we don't want to put anybody in or or put anybody out we just want to say that it's only by grace that we're saved through faith it's just a wonderful thing thinking about this this uh gate how a gate can be an entrance it just brought me to the scripture in in second Peter 1 if you want to turn there with me this morning just as we set a little background as we get going and second Peter second Peter chapter 1 verse 10 I think this speaks directly to us in our day it's not a time to play church and and and just be one way in church and another way at home and this is the time to make sure that we know where we stand amen hallelujah in second Peter 1:10 it says wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall so I want to say this if you you know for the sake of time I'm just going to read that part of it I'm not going to go back but I would recommend go back and read a little further and see there's a list of things that if you do it says you won't fall and here we have this you shall never fall we we can understand this to make our own calling and election sure to make sure that we we understand where we stand and you know to look at the natural brother bradam says the natural always types the spiritual if we do that if we look at Israel the children of Israel right now how many of those people are making their own calling and election sure and maybe the same thing in Palestine we're we're not going to say one thing about one or the other one way or the other but what I'm saying is the people in this war maybe Russia and Ukraine all these people that are involved in the war they're going to be getting up in the morning and they're going to be knowing where they stand they're going to make their calling and election sure because in any moment they could have a bomb or a gun hit them and and take them out they could die they're going to be making sure they know where they stand and if you ever see any videos of the Israelis right now they're they're dancing and singing they're praising the Lord before they go into battle there's like a hundred men in a circle and they're jumping around sometimes it's two or three circles and they're worshiping Jehovah they're worshiping calling upon Messiah it makes me wonder where are we as the Church of the Living God today as the Believers the elected the called out few yes wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen we have the Gates of Hell swinging and Laing in the breeze all over the place in this world that we're living in but we don't have to live in fear we've been given an instruction we know that there is a tremendous opportunity for us and that's why we gather this way so that we could be Washed by the Water of the word it's because we believe we want to show whose side we're on amen amen hallelujah out of possessing the Gate of the enemy after trial this is this is going to take a bit of a turn now as we go I I know that I talked about the revelation of of Jesus Christ to Simon bar Jonah who was changed to Peter in the same moment through the Revelation his name changed out of this message brother bradam he talks about Abraham in paragraph 58 he says the promise of Abraham was that his seed now his Royal seed also as I told you a while ago and this seal that he gave give Abraham was a seal of promise and the Royal seed according to Ephesians 4:30 is sealed by the Holy Ghost amen after they have stood the test try to think of it we know that there was a time where where where Abram not Abraham Abram met God and and he made himself real so real to him that he left his family he left his job he left his friends he left everyone that was there and he went out on his own he struck out on his own and we know that he he his nephew said I want to go with you Uncle if if if you're going to go I don't want to stay here take me with you and we know that he went I'll just continue reading here I get sidetracked brother bam goes on to say many think they got the Holy Ghost many claim to have the Holy Ghost many can show many evidences and signs of it but still if it can't stay with this word it's not the Holy Ghost seeall and I think that's so beautiful because it gives me and I'm sure it gives you it gives all of us an assurance that there is a baseline because it can be so difficult to understand sometimes you see people living lives that are like a double agent they live a life one way and then they live a life another way and you wonder what's going on they call themselves Believers you know at the beginning of this message brother bradam tells a story and it might be really good to just listen to it I'll try and and hit the high points in it he talks about a man who was a great evangelist in the United States he had a dream how he died and he went to heaven and while he's in heaven what does he do he he goes to the the people that are there the greeters at the door and he says can I come in and they say well what's your name and I can't remember his name I apologize I wanted to get that and and read it but he says what's your name he tells them his name and they say well we're looking in the book here and we just can't find your name it's just not here we're really sorry he says but I was a great evangelist in the United States how could I not be on the book they said well we don't know what to tell you you're not you're not here so you can appeal your case if you want to you can appeal it and and so he says okay and he went on and he said he came to a light a really really bright light and he got into the center of that light and and he heard a voice say who approaches my Throne of judgment and and he said I'm the great evangelist from the United States and and and I preached your gospel I led many souls to you and he said okay are you prepared to receive my judgment and he said yes and he said okay I'll execute my my sentence my judgment and he asked him his name and he says did you ever tell a lie he says oh I I did tell lie and he said you know before I got there I felt like I was a good person I felt like I had everything right in my life but once I got in that presence of that light I realized there was nothing good in me I had nothing to bring he said did you ever tell a lie I said yes I did did you ever steal anything he said well I I made a few business deals a few transactions that were a little bit in my benefit but and he Saidi knew right then that I had nothing good and he said ' are you ready for my judgment are you ready for it the sentencing and he said I was ready to hear him say depart from me ye Wicked and enter into the the Judgment for the devil and his angels but he said just when I was expecting to hear those words I Heard a Voice like I'd never heard in my life am yes and he turned around and he saw a face like he's never seen in his life and he said father although he is a sinner although he did Sin he stood for me down there and so I want to stand for him here brothers and sisters that's what it's going to come down to is to make sure that we stand for him here that we've got that token that we heard about this morning in our lives because when we get in that presence one day brothers and sisters our righteousness is going to be filth the rags oh my the only thing that's going to do it is him his token brother Bram says many think they got the Holy Ghost many claim to have the Holy Ghost many can show many evidences and signs of it but still if it can't stay with this word it's not the Holy Ghost see we talked about the new spirit how we can have a new spirit and the reason we get a new spirit is because our old Spirit our old Nature has to go because we can't get along with the Holy Ghost we can't even get along with ourselves eles so we get a new spiritu but brother Bram says that's not the Holy Spirit and sometimes people confuse that too you know brothers and sisters how you going to know the only way you're going to know is to give it the word test is what the prophet said can we say Amen to the word saying Amen to the word isn't just hollering in church even though you should do it when you believe it but saying Amen to the word is living it showing that that is the nutrient that you've been feeding upon that is what you have been eating during the week because when the Trials come they will come it's going to show who's on the inside it's going to show what you've been feeding on when the Trials come because the enemy is going about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour and this is not a time to play Church Brothers and Sisters this is a treacherous time Satan knows we're right near the Finish Line he's going to try and knock out as many people as he can but remember this rock of Revelation the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it and what is the rock of Revelation today we'll jump right to the finish of the sermon right now what is it it's Christ in you the hope of glory it's Christ himself living out through your life no longer me that lives yet but Christ who lives in me amen paragraph 60 he says you believe every word then you are sealed after the test amen but just be clear there's going to be a test oh I hate tests I always did not like tests who likes tests who likes to write an exam in school nobody does but what happened if if an instructor or a teacher or or a professor in University said you know what you've got just about all the time you want and you've got an open book exam imagine if you had that in school how many degrees would we have Plastering our walls I'd probably have like degree wallpaper in my house if it was an open book exam you couldn't fail all you'd have to do is show up that's right imagine the exam that we're going to get the exam that we're getting right the word test but Brothers and Sisters You've Got A limited amount of time and nobody knows how much time you've got except for God the Father amen but I'll tell you what you've got an open book exam you can take that book and answer every single question he's not going to give you many questions at all the Lord isn't going to give you many questions at all he'll say Do you believe that's the question that he'll give you because if you do then you'll act but the devil's going to come around and try and Grill you like a steak he's going to try and sift you like wheat he's going to come around with all kinds of questions oh where was the prophet hunting on that day was that really a a cloud of angels oh what was that Pillar of Fire was there something on the lens of the camera all these different things what about this Minister what about that Minister what about the other great Minister and how he fell all these different things that can go on he's not concerned with any of that that's the devil but God's going to say to you believe am and if you believe then you're going to act upon his word amen you believe every word he says then you are sealed after the test and that's Ephesians 4:30 right grieve ye not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed until when until the day of your Redemption not till the next Revival not till the next service not till you fall again you're sealed that's it amen I always get in the way of the quote I'm sorry when we believe every promise in the word then we are sealed by the spirit to confirm the promise that's what it's what Abraham the way he did it then and then only we have we the right to possess the Gate of our enemy you cannot do it first you not can't sorry you cannot do it until first you become that seed I'm just going to read this paragraph all over again I apologize I just start talking I need to just focus he says you believe every word then you are sealed after the test when we believe every promise in the word then we are SE sealed by the spirit amen to confirm the promise that's what it's what Abraham the way he did it then and only have we the right to possess the Gate of our enemy you cannot do it until first you become that seed amen this might sound contrary to what we preach and what we believe yeah but I think brother br is really bringing something out here and if you look at the message and maybe the positioning of this message is in 1964 it's right near the end of his ministry he's already preached the seals now he's he's kind of just coming down from the the peak of his ministry if you will after the seals but I personally would say he's going up to the peak of his ministry which is in 1965 I just love 1965 I hope you do as well because it's a culmination of all of the message in every single message that he preaches in 1965 it's so beautiful but you know what we're talking about here is prevailing against the Gates of Hell the gates of hell are not going to Prevail against the believer the True Believer of the word those ones who are sealed by his word they have the Seal of Promise in their life which is the earnest or the down payment of what we have in store for us but there's different types of seed isn't there there's a natural seed and there's a royal seed we read a little bit about the Royal seed and we're going to read a little more about it but you know I just think it's interesting when we look at this the natural seed and and we could get into that but we're probably not going to go too far with that we know what the natural seed is there's the the natural human beings and the natural solutions that we can come up with but then there's the Royal seed and and the man-made solutions would be like the natural seed and we know that's what happened in Abraham's life there was the natural solution his wife came to him and said you know honey the the promise of God you've we've had it for so long and it's just not happening in in the time frame that we think that it should happen so how about we just make it happen in in our way and there's the natural solution right but then there's the spiritual solution they were not promised to have a son by the Bond woman right they were promised to have the natural Son by Sarah amen that's what the promise was but there's the natural seed there's the Royal seed there's the man-made Solutions and there's the god-made solutions Flesh and Blood spiritual one child of the Bond woman one child of the promise God God called Abram from his Kindred in home and what did he do once he did he didn't just call him out and just leave him out there to pasture just like the children of Israel when they came out of bondage what did he do he created a relationship with him we know that he became a friend of God is what the word says He took him out and he developed a personal relationship with him and there's so many scriptures but I didn't get into them this morning for time sake but then he came down and met him personally and and verified the promise personally and we know that God's nature never changes amen and I'm going to get right back into that again brothers and sisters never his nature never changes that's right that's right we can have the opportunity today to have the very same experience that Abram had and you know there's only one Abram and I know people will say well God's not going to come down and show himself in his face to me but I will say that God will come down and show another person's face to you and how you treat that person is how you're potentially treating God that's right so we need to be very careful how we're acting how we're treating people how we speak about them he says then you know uh sorry I'm not reading a quote this is just my notes sorry God's God's nature never changes brothers and sisters he is the same yesterday today and forever and when the first word came to Glory that his son fell when Adam fell what happened he could have sent an angel he could have sent an Entourage he could have sent a messenger maybe a prophet but what he did was he came down himself Hallelujah and he said my son is Fallen I've got to go down and I've got to meet him myself I need to speak to him lip to ear and you know brothers and sisters there's no difference really from him there to us here we have the ability to hear from God if we truly want to and you know how we'll know if we're hearing from God because everyone's going to say potentially I've heard from God if you've heard from God it will be exactly according to the word of God and if it's not exactly according to the word of God then leave it alone brothers and sisters it's not from God but it will always be according to the word of God you'll be able to take it back to the word of God and sometimes you'll be able to take it back I'll say most times not all the time but most times you'll be able to take it back to the message of the hour because the message of the hour points to the word of God Amen the life things that we encounter the the the maybe you can have a dream maybe you would have a thought while while someone's ministering something to you in church your mind might be going somewhere else we're talking about this on Wednesday and and God can be speaking to you directly it's not a bad thing to be thinking and having a conversation in your heart with God while the preaching of the word is going on that's a communication that's Revelation but if you want to see whether it's God or not take it back to the word see if it lines up with the word if it doesn't line up with the word there's something wrong and I just think that's beautiful we talked about it already that's our Baseline that's our our our absolute that's our Anchor Point we have that as a a reference and we have a question we can always go back to that and we know that that lawyers and and judges they have the same thing they've got the rule of the law and when there's a judge a court case going on there's always something to fall back upon and that is the law but there's always an interpretation of the law and that's what gives lawyers a job they have an ability to to interpret that law and actually bring a case before a judge but we have a law that's been given to us and that law has been abolished and we've been given Grace and once we actually experience that Grace then the law has no power over us but sometimes you see folks they're just stuck in the law they're stuck in sanctification justification they've been Justified all right and Sanctified oh yeah they're Sanctified all day long but so they look at other people and and maybe some other people just aren't really Sanctified all the way just maybe not quite as far as they are and there's a problem with that because you got to go on from that stage you can't stay stuck in sanctification trying to interpret the law what we have got to do is go on to letting the judge who is the attorney let him interpret the law through us because then it will just be Grace it will be grace to everyone but when Adam fell God came down himself when the Hebrew children stood for him he came and stood for them we know that Gabriel said hey you know what I'll draw this sword we've been watching them for hours when the Hebrew kids were thrown into the fire God said no put it away Gabriel we know that worm one said hey just like the end of Destruction I'll go down and I'll flood those guys out we'll put that furnace at seven times hot hotter out we'll put it out in a second don't worry about that he said no don't worry about that either I'm going to go down this is a job for me and what did he do he called a Thunderhead he shot a bolt of lightning and he came down and he was that Fourth Man in the fire right on time God himself came down and I can say it brothers and sisters he wants to do the same thing for us today he wants to come down and be a part of our Lives be a part of our trials he's allowing the trials so that we will call upon that Fourth Man to be in our fire not just be alone and destitute trying to Wade through it on our ourselves he wants to be the one that's a part of it we know that after Abraham had been called out out called out of his Kindred and and his families and had a bit of a relationship with God himself while he was out there came Strife the natural tendencies between nephew and an uncle between families maybe wives people in the church they started to come together and say oh there's not enough of this and there's not enough of that and oh my goodness we've got all these other problems and you know there became Strife in the church and what happened there was a split wasn't there but Abram he he talked to God about it and and he knew exactly where he stood and he told his nephew just go wherever you want to go see the land that's out there just go and take whichever land you want you go whever way you want to go and we'll go the opposite and our our our herds won't have any problem there's no need for Strife we don't have to have problems you just go your way and we'll go ours and we'll still be brothers we won't be enemies we'll still be brothers and so what happened they did and and and we know that there was the the the kings came down and to the the king's Dale from the king's Dale and they took out lot and and they robbed the city and they probably killed people and and sieged the cities and and we know that Abraham he got word that his brother had gone his brother had been taken and his people so what did he do he put together all the people and imagine he's an old man now he's not a young guy but he put together all the people and they ran after his nephew even that one that was causing strife the one that wanted the split they ran after him they went after him and we know brother badam talks about how they went right to the ends of the Earth for him they went all the way but they went and got him but afterwards is what I want to talk about afterwards brothers and sisters what happened we know that all the spoils came to him and he gave a tenth of the spoil to someone and that someone was MDC that met him to say you know what you did a great job you didn't bother saying that's okay that's our brother we'll just let him go he got what he deserved that's what he deserved CU he's the one who's who's a a a uh deserter of the camp he's the one causing strife he wanted the split so he deserves it no no he didn't the spirit of Jesus Christ in him said no we we got to go get him he's our brother brother bradam says that he was maybe a penny in God's economy and maybe Abraham or Abraham was a silver dollar but they're still both a part of his economy I I say Lord let me be a penny let let me be a hey Penny in your economy maybe a dime or a nickel doesn't matter whether I'm a quarter or or a dollar bill or a $100 bill whatever I am just let me be in your economy Lord that's all so long as I'm there I'm going to the bank we know that MDC met him and said blessed be the most high God and he served him communion after the battle it didn't happen before it happened after and again a refreshing can you imagine Abraham must have known who it was he must have known exactly who he was the priest of the most high god without beginning of days without descent this man serving him communion I want to say it brothers and sisters this man wants to serve you communion he wants to serve us communion probably a whole lot more than many times we want it because he serves it twice a week Sundays and Wednesdays and Sundays and Wednesdays and it's not brother Barry that does it it's him it's his program amen it's not it's not the preacher that operates the gift remember doesn't matter what church you're at wherever you're at doesn't matter it's not the preacher that operates the gift the preacher surrenders but it's the people that operate the gift and when the people really want to hear from God and they come with a need in their heart they'll take and use that minister to hear God speak directly to their needs but we know that Abram he got to meet MDC and this relationship is what I'm talking about it started to grow and grow and grow and that was in genes 14 and we know in Genesis 17 God came and met them on the plains of mamory and we know there he changed their names and and it's interesting we know the whole entire uh message it talks about it brother bam talks about it over and over again how how how Abraham he saw one he said Lord Elohim but we know that lot when he saw them he said Lords my lords because we know the two angels went down we know all of that I don't want to get into the trinitarian thing with this but we know that God came down and he changed Abram and Sarah's names in that moment in that meeting and this is kind of where I want to see the scriptures come together now because we talked about how Jesus God in flesh said to Simon bar Jonah Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this unto you but my Father which is in heaven hath revealed this unto you and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail we we know that he changed his name to Peter Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock that your name has changed this Revelation now has changed your name the same thing is happening to Abram to Abraham he's having his name changed as well he's becoming a new creature in Christ Jesus because who was it that met him there we know it was Elohim we' probably heard people say it before was that Jesus Christ his theophany body did God take his theophan body and jump into it and come down and meet him somehow he knew exactly who he was even though he'd never met him before I've heard other people say that it was his voice when he spoke he recognized that voice and I think today brothers and sisters it's so important for us to recognize that voice recognize that voice when we hear a brother or a sister say something to us recognize that voice understand who it is that's speaking to us God doesn't have a voice of his own that he uses to speak to people well he can he can do anything he's God but 90% of the time 99% of the time I'll say he used a brother or a sister to speak to a brother or sister just like he uses the ministry Genesis 17 we know that God came down and revealed himself to Abram and Sarah and changed their names gave him a name change and told them I'm going to visit you according to the time of Life The Promise is as I spoke it it's not as you have tried to make it it's not through ishmail it's not through the Bond woman it's actually going to happen you're going to have a son Genesis 20 we know that Abram Abraham now with a new name he met God he's a real believer Justified Sanctified just about filled with the Holy Ghost he's in the place where he's just really on fire for the Lord and what happens natural circumstance get in his way and Cloud his judgment and he runs down to Egypt and what does he do he finds the king likes his wife why does the king like his wife though the king is attracted to his wife because she's been changed he not only changed their names there but he changed their bodies they got a body change out of the deal by their ability to just say Amen to the word they received a name change and a new body and now this King while they're backsliding down in Egypt is attracted to them attracted to her anyways probably not so much him but abik is attracted to her we know brother Bram said that he was backslider but isn't it interesting I'm just going to jump right into it in Hebrews it says that he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief amen but he was strong yes he was strong brothers and sisters he wasn't giving in although if we look at his natural flesh if we look at his actions we could say wow he had an experience with God he had his name changed he he was a real winner he was a real believer he had all this this this sign and wonder that went along with his life this testimony that nobody else had but yet he goes down and backslides he backslid but that ain't what the word of God says is it he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief even after trying to come up with a natural solution to a spiritual problem right how many times do we get in the way of letting the spiritual result the spiritual solution come to pass by creating a natural problem and God will allow those natural problems to just run in in in in unison with the spiritual result the spiritual solution he'll allow the natural problems to happen and we'll need to learn from those things but I just think it's beautiful even in the midst of going down into is Egypt and backsliding AMC falling in love with this man's wife he's saying that oh she's my sister say she's my sister because they'll kill me they'll kill me he wasn't worried about her they'll kill me for her what brother bam says he was trying to save his own hide but he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief brothers and sisters he was a believer and why was he a Believer because God chose him to be a believer you know in Genesis 21 Isaac is born 25 years after the promise is given a long time for a human that's a long time to dwell upon the promise to think that that promise is coming but we know that promise came and we know that he he got to the place where he was a fine young man and I can't help but think may maybe perhaps she was the same age as my son Isaac and and and and Abraham now was told hey you know what it's the same voice and he was like oh yes God Almighty Elohim how are you I'm so glad to talk to you that you want to come and talk to me again and he said I I I I'm so glad that I can come and talk to you Abraham now I want you to hear my voice and follow me sure Lord anything you want anything that I can do for you in your kingdom because I believe I'm a believer I'm on fire for you yep you are take your son Isaac up to the mountain where I tell you to and kill him now show me that you love me prove to me brothers and sisters we're not going to get the victory without a trial the trial is going to show who we are he's going to allow the trial to squeeze out whoever is on the inside of us I don't want to say whatever is on the inside of us because we've either got Christ or the devil living inside of us one of the two and you know what without the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we've already got the mark of the beast what's the mark of the beast the genetic code of the hybrid condition born in sin shaped and iniquity come the world speaking lies we're supposed to be born by the spoken word but we're not we bypassed our theophanies to come down here to be born in sin so that we can manifest through iniquity and and and be in the world speaking Lies We just lie automatically some people might say brother Barry I've never lied ever in my life okay maybe you haven't it doesn't matter maybe you've never stolen maybe you've never sworn maybe you've never had a drink or a smoke or done anything done anything wrong but the way you were born was wrong that genetic code that's in you because of that automatically puts you in that category to have the mark of the beast that's why we have to have the Holy Ghost in our lives that Pillar of Fire in our age is what gives us that Holy Ghost Genesis 21 Isaac is born 25 years after the promise God tells him okay I love you you love me now go take him up there and kill him for me show me that you love me we know brother Bram my belief he says it he probably didn't even tell his wife I know I wouldn't be able to tell my wife if God gave me that Revelation but I would say that if God gave me that Revelation that I should just probably go and take myself up to the mountain if you know what I mean cuz I wouldn't be able to bring myself to that but it's not not my promise we've already seen it it's for the word of God for our edification and we know that the examples have already been given but by him following the word by Abraham following the word of God believing the promise to the ends of the Earth what happened God blessed him God blessed him and how did he bless him through that trial he blessed him through that trial by saying to him Abram Abraham Abraham while he was back with a knife to come down and chop his son's throat because we know he got all that way I could say a whole bunch in the middle there but he he was going to do it and we know God knew he was going to do it and he said Abraham Abraham stop what you're doing right there don't do it anymore now I know that you love me am but remember he was God and God knows everything from the end to the beginning and everything in between so God knew that he loved him but Abraham needed to know how much he truly loved God he was willing to sacrifice all that he knew all that he believed everything that had to do with that promise he was willing to give it back to God to prove to him that he loved him amen hallelujah and I wonder if we're able to do that ourselves brothers and sisters can we take all of our Traditions all of the family traditions all of the religiosity that we've got all of the things that would have to do with the message maybe memorabilia maybe past experiences maybe past hurts Maybe letdowns all of that stuff are we willing to let it all go and say be it unto me according to Thy word for today cuz I believe this brothers and sisters I would say this under inspiration that that's what he's calling for today he's not calling for a bride that's going to say I've got all this baggage that I'm dragging around behind me will you one day just Release Me From It by changing my body he wants us to let go of it now amen and once he sees that we're let go of it then we're going to be able to Worship in Liberty we're going to be able to shout for Joy just like we did when we were back there on the other side of Eternity amen yes we're not waiting for a day amen imagine how the children of Israel rejoiced when they were actually delivered out of their bondage I know we still have our bondage so it's tough to worship sometimes especially on a Wednesday you know what there's a blessing in store for it there's a blessing in in store for worship brothers and sisters if you want to hear from God call upon him and see if he won't answer you amen but Genesis 21 Isaac is born we know that he's given the the answer to the promise Abraham and Sarah are and Abraham takes him up and has that tremendous Revelation now I know that I love God way more than I ever thought that I ever could because I was willing to take and sacrifice the gift that he gave me the promise that he had promised us the spiritual solution it's amazing how God will use different things in our lives and take us to different levels through those different experiences those different trials those those dark valleys sometimes can be tremendous blessings in time you know I just couldn't help but think about this Abram Abraham I keep calling him Abram forgive me Abraham he got this promise 25 years After the Promise he received it God came down and made the relationship with him and told him that this is going to happen you're going to have a promised son there is going to be a royal seed and it's going to come through your son and and it's going to happen and you just need to be patient and just see if if it doesn't happen the way that I say it will and here just thinking about us today you know brothers and sisters we we've got some folks that are in the message message of the hour for over 25 years there's some folks that have been around the message for a long long time and I want to say it I want to ask the question have have the promise that's been made known to you H has it been revealed is it a fresh Revelation today is it just as exciting as it was over 25 years ago and some people haven't been in the message that long some people have only been around for a little while but to think about how Abraham was not discouraged how he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving God the glory he was willing to continue marching forwards he wasn't going backwards with it at all it just made me think about where where are we at today you know in Romans chapter 4 maybe turn there with me this morning Romans chap 4:13 there's a there's a promised seed and I'm getting somewhere with it today I'll just say it maybe that we're the promised seed the Believers of this this message of the hour they're the promised seed they're the Royal Seed of Abraham it's not just 144,000 it's not just the children of Israel Romans 4 verse 13 talking about the promise for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of Faith amen for if they which are of the law be HS faith is made void and the promise made of not effect why is that brothers and sisters because they could do something something on their own to make it come to pass I I can do this and I'm going to get that I can act this way and I'll I'll see that result because I do I'll get because because because no there's no way that that's going to happen verse 15 says because the law worketh wrath yeah for where no law is there is no transgression right therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham isn't that wonderful how it goes from being the Seed of Abraham to the faith of Abraham Abraham the one who was strong and giving God the glory who staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was willing to continue marching forwards who is the father of us all verse 17 as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and I just love this next verse brothers and sisters and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform so if you've been called The Royal Seed of Abraham this morning brothers and sisters it's not up to you to bring it to pass it's up to him amen and he wants to bring it to pass he's wanting to bring it to pass in every one of our lives but don't stagger at this flesh this flesh is being affected by the gates of hell yes it is we can't get out of our house in the morning and drive down the road and not see a picture that we say Lord have mercy or see someone on the road or see a news article or hear some music music or hear some swearing or whatever it is wherever we go we can't escape it but we've already escaped through Christ Jesus this world is not our home brothers and sisters we're just a passing through our Treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue oh my verse 21 and being fully persuaded are you fully persuaded today are we fully persuaded if we're fully persuaded then just keep marching brothers and sisters don't give in don't get weak don't stagger and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform he will do it all amen and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness Oh my he wants to impute it unto us for righteousness his righteousness brothers and sisters just don't stagger don't look at your flesh don't look at your brother or your sister don't look at me don't look at anyone except for him look to Jesus Christ look away to Jesus verse 23 says now it was not written for his sake alone but it was imputed to him but for us also Glory To whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for who our justification amen my goodness amen thank you I just can't help but get excited I I just think it's beautiful you know where we left off I'll just go back because I want to tie this together here bear with me for a second out of possessing the Gate of the enemy after trial the last sentence brother Bram says in this quote he says you cannot do it until you first become the seed and I'm sure that potentially planted a seed and I was hoping that it would now let's water it let's water it with the word and and see what grows out of that seed let's see what comes out of it out of 19650 0119 the God who is rich in Mercy let's see what he says about that seed and I would say if you're curious afterwards just look up always were just look up always were two words and you'll see where this quote comes from but you'll see not a bunch you'll see a few that talk very specifically about this and honestly when I started to think about this when I feel inspired about it I thought there'd be a lot more in the message but there isn't it's kind of close towards the end of the message look up always were brother bradam says in paragraph 42 out of God The God Who was rich in Mercy 1965 he says now if you've got eternal life tonight if we have eternal life than we always were because there is only one form of eternal life we always were and the reason we were is because we are a part of God and God is the only thing that's Eternal and like as mzc received tithes from Abraham and it was lauded to his great grandson Levi whom was yet in the loins of Abraham paid tithes for he was yet in the loins of Abraham when when he met MDC I want to speak on that over the other place one morning who is this MDC now notice that way back God knew this boy coming down he knowed all things this is what I want to get to here this is what that seed turns into we water it with the word now we are a part of God you always was you don't remember it because you were only an attribute of God but I want to say this this morning brothers and sisters if you can say Amen to this word then you are manifesting attributes of God you are the manifestation of the word of God for your day Hallelujah he says you are only in his thinking your very name if it ever was on the book of life it was put there before the foundation of the world he knew what you were right you're not going to be you are already seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen amen thank you Lord says I'm only saying this not to mix up Doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare oh my I'm I'm I'm saved today but I'm lost tomorrow and I'm lost today but maybe I'll be saved tomorrow brothers and sisters if you've received the promise of the Holy Ghost in your life you are sealed till the day of your Redemption the gates of hell are flapping and banging trying to tell you you've lost it you never had it you're going to get it someday but I want to say you've got it just follow the word just get the word of Christ in your life repent get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the seal the holy ghost in your life it not only gives you eternal life it not only seals you to the day of your Redemption it gives you the ability to have prophetic insight into the word of God you can read between between the lines the Bible becomes a new book when it says in Genesis that you know God told Adam you can eat from any tree in the garden except for that one tree don't touch that one tree don't eat of that fruit Adam doesn't even tell Eve he tells Adam that's right but then we see that Eve later on when she's expressed when she's taken from Adam's side how she goes and she eats of that fruit and the whole entire world would say well it was an apple it was an apricot it wasn't a cherry it was this it was that but we had a prophet in our day say that it was a sexual act it was more than that the ability to read between the lines brothers and sisters when we can do that we can recognize the words original sin what it conjures in the human mind especially to the whole entire world it gives you the ability to read between the lines the whole Bible becomes a new book to us any human being that's willing to take God at his word it will become a new book yes amen I'm only saying this not to mix up Doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare you don't know who you are brothers and sisters you're Sons and Daughters of the most high God already seated in Heavenly places and you know if someone can actually shake you shake your experience from this this message of the hour if it can cause you to behave in a certain way then I want to say maybe just tune in to the message of the hour a little more maybe just go on your knees a little more and tune in with the Lord Jesus Christ because there should be nothing in this world that can shake our experience with this message of the hour because this message of the hour isn't about just books and tapes it's about Christ Jesus in you Christ in you the hope of glory right I'm only saying this not to mix up Doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare Don't Be Afraid brothers and sisters you don't know who you are you you are not going to be but now you are the sons of God see you always were the sons of God see how can we remain quiet brothers and sisters like our song the special that we heard when we've been saved when we've been redeemed when we've been shown that we've been given the keys to the kingdom already that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us how can we remain quiet I don't know I can just say this I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them and Lord willing I'm going to shout that I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them there's people everywhere who heart hearts are all a flame yes but then there's other people that just maybe haven't got there yet and you know what it's a one room Schoolhouse we get that not going to judge anyone I just want to encourage everyone to get to Christ because if you can get to Christ then you know what all of the other problems are just going to start to fade away they won't go away but they'll fade away I think it's such a beautiful thing that's one of the reasons that I really enjoy enjoyed going to church when I first got saved it just did something to me I could walk through those doors half an hour before service I wish I could do that now but I'd walk through those doors half an hour before service and I would come in and I would sit down and I would I would listen to the music and I would begin to get into the spirit I would feel the atmosphere I'd feel the the problems and the issues of My Life Begin to fade out they'd begin should lessen and lessen and slowly disappear and then I would start to really feel the presence of the Lord in the moment well before any singing or musician started just that atmosphere of getting together knowing what I was going to do in a few moments I had the opportunity to worship the most high God oh my in that pre-service moment and I can say this by experience I hope everyone else can as well I'm not trying to say anything about myself but I can say I've heard from the Lord himself to my heart heart many many times in that pre-service music just by coming and getting in this atmosphere and sitting there and just humbling myself in the sight of the Lord so that he would lift me up not that he would lift me up to minister that he would lift me up in my spirit in the position that I was in that's why we get together so that he can lift us up we humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord so that he can lift us up we want to be seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus yes we have the ability to see this world Fade Away amen oh my out of adoption 1960 adoption number four amen paragraph 55 brother Bram says now remember we went through it this morning you wasn't saved by the blood you're kept saved by the blood amen but you were saved by grace through faith believing it God knocked at your heart because he predestinated youall it wasn't an accident brothers and sisters it wasn't an accident that we have the ability to hear this word in our lives that we were born into the families that we were born into that we have the problems that we have that the circumstances or the circumstances the situations are situations it's not an accident there's no accidents amen you looked up and believed it accepted it now the blood makes an atonement for your sins remember I said God does not condemn a sinner for sinning he's a sinner to begin with he condemns a Christian for sinning and then because he has condemned him Christ took our condemnation so there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and I just want to say Abraham he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief oh my but he was strong in faith giving glory to God and if he is the father spiritually if we are the spiritual Seed of Abraham and I could bring a quote that brother bam would say that we are then stagger not brothers and sisters don't stagger just keep going just get up just get up and keep going and I know everyone here but I know there's some that aren't here just get up and keep going there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus excuse me that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and if you do anything wrong it isn't willfully but be clear you're going to do something wrong even the most polished believer in this flesh is going to do something wrong amen and I'm sorry brothers and sisters and I know I know brother Peter I'm saying it I'm sorry I'm going to do something wrong I am fallible don't think I'm not fallible I'm just a guy I'm just a man born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies but apparently God's called me to stand here I'm going to disappoint people but don't look at me look to Christ if you're looking at me then you've got the wrong version of the message just listen to what I say I know that I have to live my life according to the word and I fully intend to but I know I'm going to be make mistakes and I'm going to say will you forgive me and I trust in Christ you'll be able to am just like if you do something wrong and you say it to me and I'm going to say I forgive you because I know he forgave me and I didn't deserve it right but he still forgave meu he took and bore my sin and my shame amen and was stripped naked and tacked to a cross for my sin my how could I ever hold anything against a brother or sister but there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit but you know when you see people walking after the flesh oh my there's all kinds of condemnation isn't there and you know what happens is it doesn't manifest where they say oh I've got this and I've got that and oh there's this other thing and I just oh I've got all this condemnation no they start pointing at other people well why is that like that oh my what's with this over here why do they have that you know what when we're walking in the flesh brothers and sisters there's condemnation but when we're not walking in the flesh and and Abraham he wasn't Walking In the Flesh Abraham called the things that were as though they weren't and the things that weren't as though they were imagine if we did that in our own lives imagine if we did that in our brothers and our sisters lives even though we can see a manifestation that we can see is real bear with me I'm sorry for coughing if you do anything wrong it isn't willfully you don't sin willfully a man that sins willfully goes out and willfully sins never come into that body yet never really did never really had that experience did you ever think of that people don't get saved today and lost Tomorrow People don't get filled with the Holy Ghost and then turn their back on it because the word of God says it's impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and we know it says to renew themselves once again but why would they ever do that if they were filled with the Holy ho ghost they don't need to renew themselves they don't need to get the Holy Ghost again they can never ever fall amen and I want to say that to us today brothers and sisters if you get the Holy Ghost in your life you'll never fall right if you do do these things you shall never fall we read that scripture and I said go back and read it and I highly recommend it excuse me but a man that's once in there he's dead and his life is hid in God through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost I just love this part I'll call the musicians it's after 12 I know it's getting a little bit longer I just get excited about this it just does something there's a rock of Revelation brothers and sisters that we all have been given yes and it's this message of the hour and it's not the message itself that is the rock of Revelation that's what this message brings the message is actually an opportunity it's it's an invitation to come to the wedding supper of the Lord it it's an opportunity to recognize it's Christ himself knocking on the heart of a Believer brother brandham says but a man that's once in there remember seated in Heavenly places a man that's once in there he's dead amen and his life is hid in God through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost oh my have it there beautiful and the devil can't even find him I don't think the devil wants me saying this because he's choking me up here I'm going to read it again but a man that's once in there he's dead and his life is hidden God through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost and the devil can't even find him he's so far back in there he'll have to come out of there before the devil can ever get him for you are dead oh brother God bless you and that is the life of a Believer that's where we are today brothers and sisters when we're seated in Heavenly places the devil can't even find you Hallelujah and you know we're going to say well maybe brother Barry how does that work because I still have problems and I know that I'm sealed I know that I've got the holy ghost in my life what's your approach to those problems brothers and sisters because that shows who we are excuse me ah I'm getting it wrong but that's that's where we're at today yes that's why I said earlier I'll say it again as we close maybe stand with me you know when the heat is on when the pressure comes that's what shows not what's on the inside but who's on the inside amen that's what shows who we really are brother bradam said it very clearly that that's that's what takes place but I just love this quote I'm going to read it again here but if a man a man that's once in there he's dead and his life is hid in God through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost and the devil can't even find him he's so far back in there so I want to say can't even find you really doesn't like me saying that the devil can't even find him he's so far back in there am the devil can't even find you when you're so far back in there amen sealed by the Holy Ghost the devil can't even find you that's right you'll have to come out of there before the devil can even get you for you are dead and I love this next part he says tell a dead man he's a hypocrite and see what happens right kick him on one side and say you old hypocrite you he'll not say a word praise the Lord he says he'll just lay there kick a corpse see what happens he'll just lay there and a man that's dead in Christ you can call him a hypocrite call him anything you want to he'll never raise up about it if anything he'll slip off somewhere and pray for you that's right but oh some of them's very much alive let someone call us something let the pressure come see who's on the inside that's what I think about we're supposed to bury the dead people them that's dead in Christ we bury them in water I'm beginning to wonder if maybe maybe the Lord's just saying stop talking sometimes we bury too many people that's alive too much malice and strife and there's too much in the church but we can't separate that but God does he knows his people he knows his sheep he knows every voice he knows his children he knows who he can call out he knows who he's predestinated and I want to say this they don't always know it but eventually they will just by getting Washed by the Water of the word spiritual Amnesia will begin to wash away it will begin to wear off they'll begin to say wow could that possibly be me could I fit that could I be seated in heav any places in Christ Jesus but do you know what I've done do you know where I've gone do you know what I've experienced you know what I'm here to tell you as a living witness his grace goes a long ways brothers and sisters a long ways amen but it's for whosoever will whosoever will be able to hear his voice Hallelujah my goodness he's given these things what he's making himself known through he God can put confidence in his children yes on what to do knowing that they will do exactly this morning I want to say it brothers and sisters if we get this revelation of the message of the hour that this is not just for Simon bar Jonah and not just for Peter this is for the Church of the Living God to get this revelation of Christ in you the hope of glory when we get that Revelation when we get sealed by the Holy Ghost then we are already seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and then we recognize that we always were we just came into this world and we were bypassed our theophanies we just had this this experience that we had to go through but boy oh boy when it becomes real to us the gates of hell it can't prevail against it am God bless you this morning let's pray gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful that we can hear your word Lord to know that there's millions and billions of people in this world father that truly desire to hear your word that truly desire father to to know the truth and to have the truth set them free yes Lord but Lord you never chose millions and billions of people you chose a very few select to be predestinated Lord to be able to hear your word in every single age and we know that this is the final age Lord and this is the final call and Lord for us to have ears to hear the final call to get in the boat the final call to recognize who we are we're so thankful Lord Jesus we just ask Lord that you would go with us as we go our separate ways today you would keep your hand upon each one father be with those who are traveling those who are sick Lord those that just maybe feel discouraged and need to be lifted up father we pray that you would just bear them up on the wings of an eagle that Lord Jesus we would stagger not at the promise that you've given us through unbelief Lord that we would be strong Lord looking to that promise calling the things that are as though they're not and the things that aren't as though they are father we love you
