through that song stand on his word and nothing else matters just stand on his word just stay right there then is there anything too hard for God what a tremendous answer if you have a question like that tonight I had a I'm not sure I should share the testimony I'll share this the Reader's Digest version but I had a a very disgruntled client that just went really sideways and she threatened to do some serious stuff talk to a lawyer and he said yes that's defamation that's that's lawsuit material so I just left this I said no we're going to let let that that stay and I just went to prayer I said Lord you know what you're doing to you're you're allowing this for a reason you're allowing me to grow and I just started praying for her I said Lord would you change that lady's heart she doesn't know you she's just acting out something that's there's something in her heart that's just not right recently divorced really disgruntled with life just discouraged so I had my uh she threaten to do all kinds of things like like get into my website and destroy me so had my my marketing people take a look last night or a couple days ago and they send a reply back nothing is in place nothing has been done and I've just continued to pray for this lady so is there anything too hard for God simple little thing like that for me it's pretty big things it's defamation and who knows I mean this is not my world anyway defame me do whatever you want to me I've got a Heavenly home that's where I'm headed but in the in the end term it hurts you because I treat my customers all the same I treated her with dignity with Class CC blind copi of the emails I sent to my lawyer wow this is just this is this is dealt with dignity I never riled back at her just took it so just a little testimony that God just answered that prayer for me I don't know where she's going to go doesn't matter but I prayed for her from my heart and forgave her and I said Lord don't hold this to her charge she just doesn't know you if she know knew you she wouldn't she wouldn't come against me so little testimony for you I just believe all through life I I love that song cister Helen so I that was for me tonight so thank you if it was for you well it's a it's a it's a it's a multiple blessing tonight wonderful to serve a living God he is faithful and he's true every morning I don't know if you got up this

the Lord and he's a brother we certainly love him and his family and I think it was this week I heard he took a terrible fall in front of his house and I think his wife found him he was unconscious

Lord Jesus we see this world dying around us as our brother prayed already father this world is falling apart you know that and Lord Jesus we know that we know that there's coming a time where your

name we pray amen amen amen thank you musicians thank you sister Helen for the special amen such a wonderful blessing if you have your Bibles tonight I would like to continue reading in our study under the exposition of the seven Church ages the leoan church age the last Church age written in the Book of Revelation out of Revelations chapter 3 verse4 says unto the angel of the Church of the leod Deans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness isn't that wonderful the faithful and true witness and you know that's where we're going to get into tonight for those people who have read ahead you know for those who haven't uh that's where we're going the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God he says I Know Thy works that Thou Art neither cold nor hot I would thou wer cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isav that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will Su with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches let's just bow one more time gracious Heavenly Father we thank you that Lord you are the faithful and true witness and we know that there is a group of people that will overcome that have already overcome because you chose them in you before the foundation of the world and Lord we're so thankful that we can call ourselves one of them Lord we pray that you would just break this word fresh to us again tonight Lord like a fresh loaf of bread father our souls hunger for it Lord we desire it so we pray that you would feed us one more time just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated certainly as I said already thankful to be back it's been a wonderful time this weekend certainly missed the church being away it was uh just interesting time of Fellowship we were uh brother Logan and I drove up to Edmonton we jumped in with brother Tyler wiof and brother Eugene Brown and we went out to brother Tyler's cabin and uh each one of us except for brother Tyler we got we got our game so that was a wonderful thing we had three different animals so lots of work lots of carrying and cutting and whatnot but it was a good time really good time of Fellowship you know better than than the hunting was The Fellowship ship for sure and uh a special thank you to Sister Shelly for the wonderful treats that she sent with brother Logan we certainly enjoyed them we uh I just want to say thank you to brother Emanuel for uh stepping in and taking the Wednesday service I trust it was a blessing the uh first uh message that brother Brandon preached on conduct order and Doctrine in the church and uh as I mentioned I was corrected in that message myself and I trust that we can all be corrected when we listen to the messages you know I will all say this there's a problem if we listen to a message and we can't be corrected if God brings correction through the word of a Vindicated prophet and we say no I'm good I can't go any further there's a problem brother Bram said we need to get back to the altar but uh anyways it was just wonderful for me and uh I take it I accept it and move forward gladly with it and uh we just read it you know who he loves he rebukes and he chases so we better just be zealous and thank him for it thank the Lord for a little spanking once in a while we need it it uh it smartens us up and uh anyways thank you brother Emanuel for stepping in uh uh certainly thank you for your desire to serve the body um we're looking forward to brother mvin on Sunday uh we're going away again um it's just the way it is I got an invite and uh I didn't want to turn it down I thought you know brother Ed hasn't invited me yet to come and minister at end time message Tabernacle so I want to make sure that I can come and put my shoulder to the wheel and uh we'll begin to share Ministry I think it'll be a wonderful opportunity for fellowship and for those who don't know brother Ed hammermeister was a pretty regular minister in the congregation here in Calgary when brother Ken was here and even after brother Ken was here uh when the Lord took him home brother Ed stepped in and came to minister for us when we needed Ministry we needed someone to step in uh so he's been a good friend a real encouragement and a mentor so I want to uh I want to return my thanks to him by going and uh just fellowshipping for the weekend so we'll take two services on Sunday brother mvin stepping in he will take a service for us here uh February the 6th we've got a prayer meeting uh regular time regular place at the church here uh February the 15th and February the 16th we're going to have two Services 6 p.m. on Saturday the 15th and regular service 10: a.m. Sunday with brother Cadre Diggs he will be here and uh after that we will have the youth service at our house um Lisa and I will be taking the youth service that afternoon and may maybe even have Little Help from Brother Cadre we'll see how that goes um are you happy tonight certainly wonderful to be together again you know we uh came back to Calgary and basically hit the ground running um we got back late Sunday night and uh boy it got cold while we were away and I just thank the Lord I was driving the older vehicle and uh he gave me traveling mercies we didn't get stuck on the road we had some funny sounds but uh the Lord was good and Monday we had uh an arrival in Calgary the uh beima family brother Emanuel and sister Michelle and their daughter Karen arrived in Calgary from Cameroon so I went and picked them up and delivered them to their new residence they have a temporary residence so they can get their feet under them while they integrate into Calgary and Canada so uh we certainly are excited to see them I believe they're extremely jetlagged right now and they're just taking their time to rest we thank you to brother Peter and Sister Janet for giving them a wonderful meal and just welcoming them into Canada it's uh not an easy thing I can only imagine I've never done it but I can only imagine it is a tremendous feet he said that they had traveled over 36 hours in the air uh they had four stopovers with the baby and uh so it was a it was a big three days for them and travel but they made it and they got all their luggage too which is a tremendous thing so Sunday don't be bashful and uh look for brother Emanuel and sister Karen and uh sorry sister Michelle and their daughter sister Karen and greet them I bring you greetings also from brother Dwayne uh fair from Saskatoon Tabernacle he and uh and sister Connie were here and so I got to spend a little bit of time with brother Dwayne yesterday and uh I also wanted to bring greetings from Brother Eugene Brun Edmonton Living Word another uh another soldier that really put his shoulder to the wheel uh with Calgary Living Word when it was actually being established here so certainly glad to be back back and uh thankful for the the Lord's tender hand of Mercy I uh I'm really thankful one of the things you know just a little testimony from from me in my life I know I've talked about it in the past and my right knee has really given me trouble and I the first day we went out we did some pretty serious hiking and brother Logan he actually he hikes for a living that's his job he works for a company that's a contractor to the mine and they look for active bear dens that's his job is to look for Bear dens and uh different type of woodpeckers and uh so anyways while we were dredging through the woods brother Logan was Blazing the trail and I was struggling with my little legs to try and keep up with them and near the end of our journey on the first day my my knee was starting to burn it was really starting to hurt me and I just thought you know I've been healed it's a lying vanity Beat It Satan we're here for some good fellowship and I had about 5 minutes of pain and then after that it left it was completely gone and you know it was after that the next day that both Logan and I both shot elk and carried them and if you've ever experienced it it's almost as big as a horse so there's a lot of weight to carry and I never had an issue then the next day brother Eugene got one and again we packed the meat we did all the work and we never had a problem so I am certainly thankful for the hand of the Lord in my life so uh yeah where this is going is there's going to be some more hunting around here I'm certainly excited about that so now that we've got all that out of the way let's get back into the word you know um I just get excited every time we get into this word it's such a an amazing thing excuse me I'm just going to go back a little bit and pick up from where we left off uh out of the leoan church age we'll pick up with the paragraph 43 in the red book here it says there are those who say that God's people are going to come together through a collective Revelation he says I challenge that statement it is a bald invalid assumption in the face of Revelations 10 verse 7 now I do not deny that people will prophesy in this last age and their Ministries can and will be correct I do not deny that there will be prophets even as in the days of Paul when there was one agabus a prophet who prophesied of a famine I agree that is so he says but I deny upon the infallible evidence of the word that there is more than one major prophet messenger who will reveal the Mysteries as contained in the word and who has the ministry to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers thus saith the Lord by his unfailing words stands and shall stand and be Vindicated is it Vindicated tonight brothers and sisters if you have experienced that thus saith the Lord there ain't nothing that can change it you know uh I I just got into something this morning and I I just it's like brother random talks about you get in talks about the story of the bear that came and RAM racked his his tent and and got into the bucket of molasses in one story and a bucket of honey in another story who cares what it is the bear got into it and the fact of the matter is the prophet said that what it was was so sweet the other bear started to lick it off of the one bear that got into it that's what it is that's what it's so wonderful I got into reading a quote today and it just inspired me so much at about 4:30 this morning that you know there is a vind ation of this prophet's Ministry and sometimes PE I'm sorry I haven't been here for a little while some people are looking for the Vindication to be in the first or second pole maybe even the third poll I want to say tonight brothers and sisters the Vindication of his ministry is that people say amen to that thus sayeth the Lord people receive the word of the Prophet they receive a prophet in the name of the Prophet which gives them the prophet's reward which is the reward for the age to sit with him in his throne and you know when people receive this prophet's word in the name of the Prophet the way that he's given it that's the Vindication of his ministry it's not some great sign or wonder and I think sometimes it's a perception that there is some sort of sign or wonder that tethers to this prophet's Ministry you're the sign and wonder brothers and sister the fact that you can believe the truth in a world full of error my I told you I got inspired my I've been waiting all day to get that out oh my there is one Prophet Messenger to this age on the basis of human behavior alone anyone knows that where there are many people there is even divided opinion on lesser points of a major Doctrine which they all hold together remember brother Bram talks about the dip thong earlier in the church age book you can look it up dip thong it's in there who who then will have the power of infallibility which is to be restored in this last age for this last age is going to go back to manifesting the pure word bride that means we will have the word once again as it was perfectly given and perfectly understood in the days of Paul I will tell you who will have it oh my this just gets me up on the edge of my seat here it will be a prophet as thoroughly Vindicated or even more thoroughly Vindicated than was any prophet in all the ages from Enoch to this day it's amazing when you look at this because people would read this and they would say well he penned this book so he's just putting himself out there and making himself God he's just making himself this this tremendous guy remember he doesn't name himself all he does says this man this man this man the person that God chooses will actually fulfill it this way and we'll get into it a little further all he does is points back to the word because this man will of necessity have the Capstone prophetic Ministry and God will show him forth he doesn't put it Forward God puts him forward who would stand there on the stage in Oregon when a a a demon-possessed crazed maniac would come and and push his way to the front of the church and get right up in his face right in his grill and say I'm going to kill you tonight and what happened with all the ministry all those God-fearing ministers that would probably lay their hands on someone and scream and shout and jump up and down and have the signs and wonders in their Ministry what happened to all the ministry that was on the stage they ran one man stood alone and said tonight you'll fall over my feet who was speaking those words that was God in the man God will show him forth he won't need to speak for himself he'll just be one standing there when he came right God will speak for him by the voice of the sign amen my the second thought that must be impressed on our hearts is that the seven Church ages started out with the Antichrist Spirit as well as the Holy Spirit who is to be blessed forever 1 John 4:1 beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world many people will claim the truth but who's living it did you notice it the Antichrist spirit is identified with false prophets this age came in with false prophets and they will go out with false prophets now of course there's going to be a real false prophet in the grand sense of that man mentioned in the Revelation but as of now before his Revelation there are to appear many false prophets you know I would just go so far as to say this brother bradam said it in the message he said the word Prophet means Minister and you know this is where it gets down to the nitty-gritty because it will be so close it would deceive the very elected it's not going to be out in the Catholic Church we're talking about this earlier today too it's not going to be out in the in the denominational world we need to forget about that it's going to be sitting right next to us in a message Church Brothers and Sisters but it's not about looking at one another it's about looking at him get the token in your life and we're not going to be looking at one another what we'll do is pray for one another and trust that the Lord will sort us out in Matthew 24: 23-26 then if any man shall say unto you Lo here is Christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders don't look at signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they should shall deceive the very elect I just think it's so beautiful how he would put this in there not to actually throw off on people not to actually make people feel bad but to give the very elected something to look at there's a there's an indicator here signs and wonders that's not the measuring stick the measuring stick is the word he says behold I have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he's in the desert go not forth behold he's in the secret Chambers believe it not because where is he where is he brothers and sisters he's in the heart he's in that teeny little spot in the human heart that no other animal in creation has that he made for himself that's where he is these false prophets are earmarked for us in various other scriptures such as the following second Peter 2 veres 1-2 but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring IND damnable heresies even denying the Lord that brought that bought them and bring upon themselves Swift destruction and many shall follow their pernicious Ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of you know brothers and sisters I just had this come to me I'm just going to say it it's the way it needs to be I guess don't think that Swift destruction is going to be a lightning bolt zap boom you're done on the contrary I I would recommend taking a look and thinking destruction Swift destruction could be winning the lottery Swift destruction could be actually becoming a star at whatever it is you do Swift destruction could be so much money that you just don't even need to actually think and work with your mind anymore you become corrupted Swift destruction can put you in a place like many of the stars in this world many times in my life I'm only preaching from my life my experience many times in my life you you heard my testimony I longed for a big fat bank account for some way to actually generate lots of money to be flush with cash so that I didn't have to struggle like I did in my life because I chose it but you know what it caused me to actually survive it caused me to actually learn to make it work it taught me that if I want it I better get up and go get it because it's not just going to fall into my lap but I can only imagine if I had lots of money you know we're kind of fellowshipping around this guess maybe it's kind of why it came you look at some of these stars and some of these like billionaire people some of these people who are seemingly Untouchable maybe in Hollywood or in the finance world I'm not going to name any names but you probably have seen the news and seen some of the stuff going on these people get so busy with money in their lives what happens to them them is they go into a vacuum and now they have nothing to do because they've done it all they don't have any more dreams so they just get corrupted don't think about Swift destruction to be a lightning bolt from God because that might not be it going on paragraph 47 he says these false prophets are oh sorry going on we'll continue on with first 2 Timothy 4: 3 to 4 for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lusts this is the problem shall Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables ideas in their mind thinking everything is right when it's not according to the word 1 Timothy 4:1 now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils I think we talk talked about this last time don't think those seducing spirits and doctrines of devils are going to be raging monsters they're going to be polished religious maybe even message Believers so-called now in every case you will notice that a false prophet is one who is outside the word just as we showed you that Antichrist means an antiw so it doesn't have to be some some some personality that we read about earlier in this chapter some great person who will become the anti the Antichrist anyone anything that's contrary to the word that's outside of the word and I want to say this what's outside of the word for our day the messenger for the age anyone that's living outside of that is Antichrist it's good or evil brothers and sisters just as we showed you that Antichrist means means anti- word so these false prophets come perverting the word giving it a meaning that fits their own devilish ends my that's hard have you ever noticed how the people who lead others astray bind them closely to themselves by fear you ever noticed that now we can look out and say you see in the world there's people that have done that all over the place many stories in in Wikipedia I'm sure that we could see in news articles how there's been Cults and different things but you know there's churches that claim to believe this message of the hour where ministers I'm going to say prophets will say that if you don't do what I say you're lost if you don't actually do what I command you to do then you're actually not going to make it to heaven and they would go so far as to say that you will actually go to hell I've heard people witness that testimony shocking but it's right here in the word they try and bind People Ministry of fear if you don't do it the way that I do it if you don't believe it the way that I believe it if you don't follow the tradition that I believe is the right one what do what what does it matter what we believe what about what the word says the prophet was given to us to bring the church back in line my have you ever noticed how the people who lead others astray bind them closely to themselves by fear they say that if the people don't want to do what they say or if they leave that's a big one if you leave you're going to hell then destruction will follow they're false prophets they're false prophets anyone that would want to try and say that I'm the boss in this message of the hour is a false prophet anyone that wants to be in control trying to control everyone and saying the words that we've heard brothers and sisters they're a false prophet they're Antichrist they have a devilish desire and you know the sad thing is they might not even know it they might believe with all their heart that they're actually in the service of the Lord but that's where it becomes so close that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible it's impossible to deceive the very elected because the very elected will have the Holy Ghost and you will never fool the Holy Ghost with a devilish desire that's impossible my for a true Prophet will always lead one to the word a true Prophet will always lead one to the word and bind the people to Jesus Christ and bind the people to Jesus Christ and he won't tell the people to fear Him or what he says but to fear what the word says this is just so liberating if there's anybody that has any doubt about the message of the hour whether you're present or whether you're streaming hear these words this man pushed people to Jesus Christ and tonight I say it we all agree collectively we push people to Jesus Christ because he's the only one that died for us on Calvary he's the only one that shed his blood for us so beautiful it just makes it so clear so easy my notice how these people like Judas are out for for money you know the word says that if you just put put him first then all these other things will be added unto you if if we just put the word first then all the rest of it will happen but if we let anything get in our way of the word look out I know by experience look out it can get to be a bumpy road in this life it ain't all about money remember sometimes God will actually give us over to our desires to let us go through some experience to actually learn we know that experience what does it do it brings patience that's what experience does brother Brandon goes on to say they get you to sell all you have and give it to them and their schemes man I know of a message church right now that has called people to sell all they have and actually get pick up and move move and go and live in the place where this this this preacher this pastor is exactly what he's saying here people that claim this message I wonder if they've read this book those who attempt to operate they're probably not allowed to by the way those who attempt to operate gifts will make use of a gift which has a margin of error in it and then ask for money and neglect the word and call it of God and people will go to them and bear with them and support them and believe them not knowing it is the way of death yes the land is full doesn't say the land is got a few says the land is full of carnal and inations in the last day they will try to imitate that Prophet messenger and I think this is where it gets real good this is where it gets real good the seven sons of CA tried to imitate Paul remember that story I I just felt inspired to go there tonight I'm just going to turn to two scriptures tonight both in Acts if we could turn to Acts 19 first time I heard this story my pastor brother Ken preached on it brother Ken Boer our late Pastor here I never forget it I was a brand new Christian and I was shocked when I heard this story verse 13 out of Acts chapter 19 then certain of the Vagabond Jews exorcists took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus Jesus saying we adure You by Jesus whom Paul preacheth trying to to work the mighty Works trying to benefit from it let's have a show we'll actually demonstrate the power of God and you know what people will follow us we'll bind people to us exactly what the prophet was describing here and you know we know you know we know we know you know this is the Holy Ghost speaking these words here it's not just a prophet verse 14 and there were seven sons of onea a Jew and chief of the priest which did so and the evil spirit answered and said Jesus I know Paul I know but who are you we don't want to get caught up in a situation like this brothers and sisters where we can actually begin to try and put the gifts out front of the word when we try and do that especially if you are called by the Lord he's going to allow things to happen and you know this guy here he never had the Holy Ghost in his life they they they weren't protected that way so what happened verse 16 says and the man in whom the evil spirit was leapt on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so they fled out of that house naked and wounded and you know I just can't help but would think they left that house a little bit Leo Dean thinking they were rich and increased with Goods but didn't realize that they were naked oh my and they were probably nearly Blind by what happened what the word is saying there brothers and sisters is the devil thrashed them they got a good thrashing by the devil you got the holy ghost in your life that ain't never going to happen and this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus and fear fell on all of them and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified and that's the way it's supposed to be brothers and sisters the name of the Lord Jesus is supposed to be magnified there's no great ministry in this world some people will say well that's easy for you to say brother Barry you whatever whatever whatever whatever I've got this ministry I've got that Ministry we've got all these other minist Ries that have been in the ministry for all these years you know it's fine it's good we have experience we understand but do we have the Holy Ghost because if we don't have the Holy Ghost if we're not preaching the Holy Ghost then we're preaching something wrong if it's all mystery there's a problem because that mystery is history the prophet was actually here he did his job the seals were opened there's no more Mysteries those seven unknown Thunders that were contained in the Book of Revelation they're they're actually known now they're not unknown they're known I could go a long ways with that what I'm at tonight brothers and sisters I want to bring this out and say look we need to know where we stand brother brandham just briefly talks about it the seven sons of CA they tried to imitate Paul Simon the Sorcerer tried to imitate Peter let's quickly turn over to Acts chapter 8 just uh a few scriptures back in the book of Acts I guess where I'm going with this is even though people will try and imitate the prophet they'll try and imitate the word of God they'll try and imitate the true Ministry of the Lord God won't be mocked that's the word of God he will not be mocked we can try all we want but one day he's going to let it come out and it will all be known Simon the Sorcerer in Acts 8 verse n but there was a certain man called Simon which Before Time in the same city used sorcery and what did he do he Bewitched the people he Bewitched the people of Samaria giving out that himself was some great one to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying this man is a great is the great power of God and to him they had regard because of that long time that he had Bewitched them with sorc naries brothers and sisters I'm throwing this out there tonight and forgive me for it but tenure obviously doesn't mean you're right I've been in the message for a long long time have you got the Holy Ghost since you believe they had regard because of the long time that he Bewitched them with the sorceries he bound them to him just like the prophet was saying here I I think this is just just incredible what does it say here the word of God and the people will go to them and bear with them and support them and believe them this is a prophet saying these words here not me not knowing it is the way of death yes the land is full of carnal impersonations here we have this guy bewitching the people but God's not going to be mocked but when they believed Phillip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both men and women then Simon himself believed also Simon could see the power of God he was transforming himself and when he was baptized he continued with philli and wondered beholding the Miracles and signs which were done now when the Apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God they sent unto them Peter and John who when they come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost for as yet he was was Fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus then laid they their hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost and when Simon saw that through laying on of the Apostles hands the Holy Ghost was given remember this was the Jewish way the Holy Ghost was given he offered them money his carnality got in the way he couldn't let go of the old and grab on to the new and saying give me also this power that on whomsoever I lay hands he may receive the Holy Ghost so he wanted to have a show he just wanted to have the sign and the Wonder so he could what draw people unto them so he could get people to bear with him and support him and believe him right saying give me also this power that whomsoever I lay hands may may also receive the Holy Ghost but Peter said unto him thy money perish with thee because thou Hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money and there's a lot of that in the church brothers and sisters where people try to usurp the power of influence fluence because they earn a lot of money cuz they earn a lot of money means their tithe should have more influence than the Widow with two mites at the door and we know Jesus when he was here on Earth he asked the disciples which one gave more H but you know what it is it's politics and I'll go even further to say that it's a demonic Spirit trying to control the church through politics but you won't control the Holy Ghost clearly as we've read in these scriptures here we know that that that Peter said to him thou Hast neither part nor lot in this matter for thy heart is not right in the sight of God the word of God is quick and powerful and sharp sharper than any two-edged sword it's it's Discerning of the joints and the marrow it goes between the muscle and the bone boy we saw a lot of that this week you know we were talking about that and and how that sharp two-edged sword it goes beyond all of the natural carnality the Flesh and Blood and it discerns the very heart of the man here we have it in action thy heart is not right in the sight of God repent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray God if perhaps the thought if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee for I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity knowing to do something and not doing it and knowing not to do something but yet going ahead and doing it in the bond of iniquity that answered Simon and said pray ye to the Lord for me that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me we know the word the Lord said to him just shake your clothes off shake your clothes dust your clothes if they're not willing to to hear you and just move on just a tremendous thought brothers and sisters that uh both of these stories here he just brushes over it the seven sons of CA tried to imitate Paul Simon the Sorcerer tried to imitate Peter their impersonations will be carnal they won't be able to produce what the true Prophet produces now I'm I'm going to say this brothers and sisters because I think it's really important in the day in which we live don't look at T evangelists I automatically thought about that I would think about that I grew up watching it late night television and I would see it t evangelist and I'd be like yeah another one another one another one you know we're not talking about that we're talking about it being so close that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible it's not going to be out there it's going to be right here their impersonations will be carnal they won't be able to produce what the true Prophet produces when he says the Revival is over they will go around claiming a great Revelation that what the people have is exactly right and God is going to do bigger and more wonderful things amongst the people and the people will fall for it sell all you got and move to wherever because that's where the Rapture is going to be you know sell all you got and and and move to wherever because we've got the Holy Ghost we've got the edge it's us for no more you know unless you're born into this lineage you're not going to make it to heaven right all of these false doctrines doctrines with devilish Desires in the day in which we live the people will fall for it how will they fall for it they don't have the Holy Ghost get the Holy Ghost these same false prophets will claim that the messenger of the last day is not a theologian so he ought not to be heard they'll have some kind of an edge they'll be the teacher they'll say that you know there's another messenger or whatever there'll be something that will cause them to say that that you need to listen to them and they're right there in the world right now there's people that will actually pray in the name of someone I'm not going to name a name from the pulpit I don't think it's worth it but you know there's only one name whereby you should be saved there's only one name they won't be able to produce what the messenger can they won't be Vindicated by God as the last day Prophet is but with their great swelling words and with the weight of their worldwide notoriety they will warn the people not to hear that man messenger and they will say he teaches wrong they are running exactly true to their fathers the Pharisees who were of the devil for they claimed that both John and Jesus taught error now why do these false prophets come against the true prophet and discredit his teaching because they are running true to form as did their forefathers when in the days of Ahab they withstood Micaiah there were 400 of them and all of them were in agreement my you know brothers and sisters I think I talked about this last time I I feel like I want to start preaching right now and I know we've only got a few minutes left but you know just because everyone's doing it don't mean it's right just because everyone agrees with it don't mean it's right this is what the prophet's saying here that's what the word of God says there was 400 God Prophets The Prophet said 400 of them all agreeing go up and take the land naturally speaking it was their land oh my but there was one God Prophet that said you know what don't do it he gave him fair warning he said don't do it but if you do knew it I I'm going to be a false prophet if you actually make it back alive Why by them all saying the same thing they fooled the people but one Prophet just one was right and all the rest wrong because God had committed the Revelation to only one beware of false prophets for they are ravening wolves if you are still in any doubt about this ask God I love how he says this brothers and sisters I say this too if you are in any doubt about this ask God by his Spirit to fill you and Lead You and outside of that brothers and sisters you will not be in that category of the very elect if you resist the holy ghost in your life you will not be the very elect because the very elect will say amen I want that Holy Ghost I want to follow the word for my day he says ask God by his Spirit to fill you and lead you for the very elect can't be fooled he says it did you get that there isn't any man that can fool you Paul could not fool any elect had he been wrong and in that first Ephesian age the elect there could not be fooled for they tried the false Pro false Apostles and Prophets prophets and found them to be liars and put them out Hallelujah his sheep hear his voice and they follow him amen I believe it the salutation Revelations 3 ver4 these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God my isn't that the most wonderful description of the attribut Utes of our lovely Lord and Savior Jesus Christ these words just make me want to shout they bring such a spirit of reality into my heart just reading them without even waiting for a thorough revelation of the spirit upon them Thrills me Jesus is giving us this description of himself in relation to the last age the days of grace are winding up he has looked from the first century right through to the 20th and told us all things concerning these ages before he reveals the characteristics of the last age to us he gives us one final look at his own gracious and supreme deity this is the Capstone revelation of himself my I just just have that highlighted it's such a powerful sentence thus saith the amen Jesus is the amen of God Jesus is the so let it be of God Amen stands for finality it stands for approval it stands for prevailing promise it stands for unchanging promise it stands for the Seal of God and you know brothers and sisters we've heard it said I just want to say it tonight I feel it I just I really do you know every time you say Amen to the word of God something happens inside of you and this is where you know we we've talked about it we're going to continue to talk about it Lord willing we're looking for a body change that body change is going to happen naturally it's going to happen spiritually but you know it's not going to happen spiritually or naturally if we're not having a character change and every time we say Amen it does something to our character we just accept that word into our womb and it comes to life greater and greater and greater this character has got to be changed to fit to be fit to rule and Reign over there it's not just going to be sometime we're just different people why not because the prophet said the only thing that we take with us is what our character so that character has to be worked out right here we can't wait for him to change it for for us he's not going to change it for us if if if if we're rebellious children he'll help us he'll allow certain circumstances and situations to come our way until we're willing to actually pass the test I say Lord help me such a beautiful scripture such a beautiful tremendous teaching just my I want you to watch this carefully now and see something really sweet and beautiful I said this is his Endtime revelation of himself when the day of Grace closes then the Millennium comes very shortly thereafter doesn't it well read with me Isaiah 65 16-19 that he who blessed blesseth himself in the Earth shall bless himself in the god of Truth and he that sweareth in the Earth shall swear by the god of truth because the former troubles are forgotten and because they are HID from mine eyes for behold I create new heavens and a new Earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind but be ye glad and rejoice forever in that which I create create for behold I create Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy and I will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my people and the voice of weeping shall no more be heard in her nor the voice of crying what did he say he said I want you to carefully see I want you to watch this carefully now and see something really sweet and beautiful a description of what he's doing what he's going to do what we're going to experience in Isaiah 65 now this is about New Jerusalem this is the Millennium but as we go into the Millennium hear what he says about being a certain kind of God verse 16 he who blesseth himself in the Earth shall bless himself in the god of Truth the word yes that is true but the real translation is not God of Truth it is God of the amen so we read it shall bless himself in the god of the amen and he that sweareth in the Earth shall swear by the god of the amen because the former troubles are forgotten and because they are HID from mine eyes for behold I create new heavens and a new Earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind can you imagine that we won't have to deal with all the garbage it won't even come into our mind we'll forget it it's a wonderful thing but be ye glad and rejoice forever in that which I create for behold I create Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy and I will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her nor more nor the voice of crying Hallelujah here is Jehovah of the Old Testament the god of the amen here is Jesus of the New Testament the god of the amen here o Israel the Lord thy God is one God there it is again the Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Jesus of the new here o Israel the Lord thy God is one God the New Testament does not reveal another God it is a further revelation of the one and same God I better call the musicians up as we near the the time Christ did not come down to make himself known he did not come to reveal the son he came to reveal and make known the father that's pretty powerful that goes against a lot of the theological world right there he did not come to reveal the son he did he came to reveal and make known the father he never talked about two Gods he talked about one God he talked about one God and now in this last age we have come back to the Capstone Revelation the most important revelation of godhead in the whole Bible maybe stand with me as we close with this paragraph the most important revelation of godhead in the whole Bible that is Jesus Is God he and the father are one there is one God and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ it sounds so Elementary and so normal we know it we've heard it we experience it but but just try and explain that to someone who fully believes in the trinitarian doctrine and see what kind of a reaction you get because it's false and we we heard all about the false tonight people get angry people don't want to be wrong but you know Sons and Daughters of God are corrected by the word of God they're willing to endure chastisement is not pleasant for the moment not for any one of us but what it does is it it it brings forth the Peaceable fruit of righteousness in our lives and and that's literally the life of Jesus Christ becoming humble to the word God bless you tonight let's just go ahead and pray dear gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for this opportunity one more time to gather together Lord around this thought of your word and the study of your word through the lens of this book lord we know that your Vindicated Prophet had a desire to try and bring together the entirety of this message that you gave to him to deliver to the people father we know that there was a time where that book was simply in the hand of one that sat on the throne we know that was you and no one was worthy in heaven to take that book or even look upon it and John wept greatly because he saw that but there was one that was found a lamb the lion of the tribe of Judah was able to take that book and loose the seals and he did and there came another time where that Mighty Angel took the same book and descended upon the Earth put one foot on the land and one foot on the sea and declared that time shall be no more in the days of the voice of the seventh angel messenger oh my and we know that there was a time where that messenger was up in a canyon because you called him the there and you put something in his hand father we thank you for that and Lord Jesus tonight here we are just partaking of that all that Adam lost being restored back into man's hands again help us Lord Jesus to be diligent with what you've given to us help us not to circumnavigate to make excuses for our own behaviors Lord but help us to to take our behaviors and line them up with your word Lord Jesus let our goals reflect that father let us have the desire to set a goal to just adjust our lives to match your word as we go forwards Lord we can't look backwards at what we've been we only want to look forwards to to who you have created us to be Lord Jesus that you would have the preeminence in every moment in every day of Our Lives father we love you we thank you we pray that we would just be able to consider the word spoken tonight Lord that we would remember the Capstone revelation of the Bible is that you are one God you are one in the Old Testament you are one in the New Testament you are one today in the hearts of your children you're one in this message that we so dearly believe you are God the Lord Jesus Christ and it's you that we serve father we just commit each life into your hands each family each and every need Lord father we pray that you would touch oh Lord Jesus sister Michelle Livy the unspoken request tonight father you know it and we know that you are more than able father to minister to that need father we all have needs and father we just commit them into your hands and we'll be careful to bring you a praise report Lord oh Father even though 10 lepers were healed and set free father one of them had a desire to come and give you thanks and Lord Jesus that's the desire of every one of our hearts Lord to bring that that praise report back to you and to say thank you Lord for saving my soul we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you are more than enough for me in the presence in the presence of je he's here right now God almightyy of [Music] trou oh Lord Jesus Bend
