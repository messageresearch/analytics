Lord to have the ability Lord Jesus to walk around and to think and to be free Lord Jesus amen hallelujah oh Lord how easy it can be to just simply take the most basic simple things for granted in our lives what it means to have health what it means to be able to see to be able to hear to be able to sing praises unto you father Lord let us never ever be forgetful father and Lord Jesus the greatest gift of all to have the invitation to the marriage supper of the Lamb oh Father and to know that there's no way that we could ever get that invitation outside of you choosing us on your own and father giving us the ability to recognize that helps us to accept that invitation Lord amen and father tonight we're here because we accept that invitation Lord Jesus father we just ask that you would be glorified in every aspect of our service tonight Lord if there's anything that would hinder your spirit tonight father we just ask that you would forgive us for it Lord that you would Purge it from us Lord Jesus Lord that we could just claim this time for you Lord that the preeminence that you desire would be expressed in this service tonight father that the words that are spoken would not fall on deaf ears Lord that it wouldn't be in vain our meeting tonight Lord but that you would have the preeminence father we just want to remember the needs that were made known unto you tonight by the way

it and father we're so thankful that you have the solution that you are the solution Lord oh Father we love you and thank you Lord we just want to remember Jesse heavon Lord we know that when the doctors reach the end of their Road when the doctors no longer know what way to turn father that's where you specialize you are the specialist you are the great physician you performed the first

amen father tonight we just thank you for the service and every aspect Lord we commit into your hands now for your glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen thank you musicians one more time for bringing of your gifts certainly tremendous we're certainly thankful that we can carry on with our study and the exposition of the seven Church ages if you have your Bibles tonight we would like to turn over to Revelations chapter 3 and uh just carry on with the text this is where the seven Church ages are found in Revelations chapter 2 and Revelations chapter 3 and uh it's just wonderful to think that we've been given the ability to understand what these mean even many theologians would uh poke and prod at it but not really have a a solid understanding or definition of it in fact some would even shy away from it because of the lack of Revelation But Here We Are Tonight Revelations 3:14 and unto the angel of the Church of the leod Deans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness amen the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou were cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isav that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice voice and open the door I will come into him and will Su with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father we thank you for this word we thank you for the understanding that Lord this is the church age that you sent the seventh angel Messenger to and we know that father he came and he declared and you took him home and father before you took him you he said that there won't be two of us standing here at the same time and we know that before his departure he said that you the Holy Spirit are the prophet in the land and we thank you for that Lord tonight we pray that you would just Quicken this word to our Souls father that maybe we would see something or hear something that maybe in a way like we've never heard before father that this would be a living word that's spoken tonight we just Commit This service now into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight you may be seated certainly thankful to be together again all of the holidays are out of the way and we're back in service um we uh just have a few announcements that I wanted to mention we have a prayer meeting coming up tomorrow night the first Thursday of the month and uh the 15th coming up actually the uh 15th to the 20th I will be away um my family will still be here I going with brother Logan we are actually going to hunt elk we have some late season elk tags that the Lord blessed us with and because I had a surgery I didn't didn't do any hunting this year in the regular season and uh an opportunity came up so the 15th to the 20th will be away on the 15th we're going to do something a little different and we're going to have a tape service and it's going to be uh interesting because it will be uh little bit of a study in the direction that I want to go in in the future once we're done with the uh exposition of the seven Church ages I want to get into church order so we're going to listen to the first church order there's two services that brother Brandon pre reached in 1958 it's 17 and uh I think it's 38 minutes long so it's not too long of a service and uh so that's what we'll do next Wednesday and then we have brother Emanuel sarpong taking the service on the 19th and uh we're certainly excited for What the Lord Has put on our Sunday school teachers heart amen and uh I believe is it the 19th the youth meeting as well we'll have at the Clon residence and uh on the 26th I I will be away again I will be back in between the first time I said I'll be away I got an invitation from Brother Ed hammermeister to come and minister at end time message Tabernacle and uh I felt led to go so on the 26th I'll be attending there with my family and we'll take uh two services and then we'll be back again on Monday in February will uh Lord willing just be uh back to normal Lord willing um we have confirmed I did today that I believe it is the 16th is that right I meant to get it it's the 16th yeah Sunday the 16th uh we'll have brother kadre Diggs here and likely we'll do a Friday or a Saturday evening service as well as a Sunday morning service with him so uh we can mark that down on the calendar as well for the church uh brother kadre said to greet everyone he's certainly excited to come he loves coming to Calgary and uh he especially loves Wild games so we're thankful we're going to be able to fix him up with that are you happy tonight we uh last time I believe it was before the new year we uh yeah was it Christmas Christmas e Christmas evening we actually had service yeah it's just been a blur there's been so much going on picking up from where we left off um in the church age book in the leoan church age Malachi verse Malachi chapter 4: 5 and 6 actually we'll just go back a little bit Matthew 7: 10-1 um and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all all things now brother bradam in the leodan church age he begins talking about the leodan church age messenger and this is where he's going with the scriptures here he goes on to say before the coming of Our Lord Elijah must come back for a work of restoration in the church this is what Malachi 4 says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse he said there's absolutely no doubt that Elijah must return before the coming of Jesus he has a specific work to accomplish that work is the part of Malachi 4:6 that says he will turn the hearts of the children to their fathers amen this reason the reason that we know this is his specific work to do at that time is because he has already accomplished the part that says he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children when the Elijah Ministry was here in John the Baptist I just love this in Luke 1:1 17 and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disob obedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord in the ministry of John the hearts of the fathers were turned to the children we know that because Jesus said so but it does not say that the hearts of the children were turned to the fathers that is yet to take place and isn't it beautiful because it's even now taking place amen the the hearts of the last day children will be turned back to the Pentecostal fathers John got the fathers ready for Jesus to welcome the children into the fold now this Prophet upon whom the spirit of Elijah Falls will prepare the children to welcome back Jesus amen Jesus called John the Baptist Elijah Matthew 17:12 but I say unto you that Elias is come already and the knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed the reason that he called John Elijah was because the same spirit that was on Elijah had come back upon John even as that Spirit had come back upon upon Elisha after the reign of King Ahab now once again the spirit will come back upon another man just before Jesus comes he will be a prophet and I know I'd be preaching to the choir tonight to say that you know wasn't it on the Ohio River the foot of Spring Street amen one afternoon this man that he's referring to was baptizing the 17th person and there was a star or a ball of fire or a pillar of fire that came down and hovered and there were hundreds of people around and some said they heard an angel and some maybe said they heard thunder but we know that there was a voice that came out of that amen that said as John the Baptist foran the first coming of the Lord so your ministry will forerun the second coming and it's so beautiful because he's talking about this being a future event but we can look back at that and say that that mystery is history it's already taken place amen we're not looking for that to happen he will be a prophet and how will we know that he is a prophet he will have signs and wonders in his ministry but he will always point back to the word that is the scriptural identification of a prophet amen he will be a prophet he will be Vindicated as such by God since Jesus himself in the flesh won't be here to vindicate him as he did John it will be done by the holy spirit so that this prophet's Ministry his will be attended by great and wonderful manifestation as a prophet every revelation will be Vindicated for every revelation will come to pass and I I know that he has said it and we could say it too is there anyone out there that could say that he was off on any one of the manifestations any one of the discernments any one of the prophecies not one of them wonderful acts of power will be performed at his commands in faith then will be brought forth the message that God has given him in the word to turn the people back to the truth and the true power of God some will listen but the majority will run true to form and reject him we know that there's always a sign first in a prophet's Ministry but there's always a voice that comes behind that sign the sign is there to get the attention of the people he said brother Bosworth said it was just like the bait on the hook to catch a fish you don't show the fish the hook because he may or may not bite it you show him the bait they like the bait so they'll bite it so the same thing with the word of God is what he was referring to signs and wonders lead and then the word and that's where brother Bram they say fell off he went off on his Doctrine when the word actually came the opening of the word it became a problem but he said it some will listen but the majority will run TR to form and reject him since this Prophet messenger of Revelations 10:7 will be the same as Malachi 4 verse 5 and 6 who preaches that by the way today outside of the message nobody he will be naturally like Elijah and John both were Men set apart from the accepted religious schools of their day both were men of the Wilderness both acted only when they had thus sayeth the Lord straight from God by Revelation both lashed out against the religious orders and leaders of their day but not only was that so they lashed out against all who were corrupt or or would corrupt others I just sort of chuckled there because I I was just thinking about you know Elijah and the government in his day and and what Elijah that Elijah would be like with the government in his day today is there a government that's not corrupt straight from God by Revelation both lashed out against the religious orders and leaders of their day but not only was that so they lashed out against all who were corrupt corupt or would corrupt others and notice both prophesied much against immoral woman and their ways Elijah cried out against Jezebel and John rebuked herodias Philip's wife though he will not be popular he will be Vindicated by God isn't that wonderful that's I I believe that's the life of a Christian today the true Christian today is not going to be popular when people really know what the true Christian to believes and what they live for they're going to say my you're maybe not going to be popular but boy to be Vindicated by God Amen Hallelujah as Jesus authenticated John and the Holy Ghost authenticated Jesus we can well expect this man will be first of all authenticated by the spirit working in his life in Acts of power that are indisputable and found nowhere else Hallelujah isn't it wonderful to see this to be able to understand this when we look at history if you look at the faith healing movements that swept around the world they all came after him maybe there was some Ministries where the Lord was moving we know the isusa Street Revival happened that was before brother Bram came to his ministry but we know the faith Healing Ministry really took off and and even today there's so many people claiming to have this kind of a Ministry and not really having it because we know the word says that if a man wants to prophesy and he wants to actually show a a spirit of the Lord if if if he's off don't hear that man that's what the word says and many times you'll hear well they're pretty close most of the time but once in a while they're off either they're on or they're off we're we're either inspired by God and we live Godly lives for Christ or we don't I think this is just such a beautiful part of this book my though he will not be popular he will be Vindicated by God as Jesus authenticated John and the Holy Ghost authenticated Jesus we can well expect this man will be first of all authenticated by the spirit working in his life in Acts of power that are indisputable and found nowhere else and Jesus himself in returning will authenticate him now that one is an interesting sentence and Jesus himself in returning will authenticate him even as he authenticated John when is that going to happen the reason I'm laboring on this is when is that going to happen what's the timeline like I think it's not like maybe we would read this and just gloss over it and think well when you know the people come riding Out of Heaven on white horses when he comes with the armies of Heaven that's when it's going to be all Vindicated but brothers and sisters I don't think that's the case and I'm sure by the way some are smiling tonight we understand that he's vindicating it even right now tonight he's Vindicated it all the way along after he took his man off of the scene when brother Bram went home and people thought that it was going to be the Rapture right then that was when Jesus now takes all the glory because he won't share his glory with anybody amen and we know that there's a deity spirit I think it even talks about it as we go a little further here but there's there's a group of people yeah he says it in here uh I just get confused I look at a lot of this uh message material but he says it in here there will be even a spirit that will actually try and deify this man and even today there's that spirit's alive and well amen and Jesus himself in returning so when is he going to return brothers and sisters I don't think we're looking for the return we're going to meet with him in the clouds but he's going to go to the clouds from where my even has he authenticated John John witnessed that Jesus was coming and so will this man like John witness that Jesus is coming it's closer than you think amen type it in see how many times he says it Jesus coming and the Very return of Christ will prove that this man indeed was the Forerunner of his second coming this is the final evidence that this indeed is the prophet of Malachi 4 for the end of the Gentile period will be Jesus himself appearing you could type in the this is just ignites me you could type in the message the appear appearing the appearing and the coming are two separate things brother bradam says this is the appearing Amen in the message demonstrating the life of Jesus Christ only Christ could discern the hearts of men amen then it will be too late for those who have rejected him I just I just can't help but think brothers and sisters it could be any second now any moment now any day now amen any moment it's never been so close it's no time to get weary in well doing it's time to to to knuckle down and just take inventory and make sure we know where we are and and I say this preaching to myself here my in order to further clarify our presentation of this last day Prophet let us particularly note that the prophet of Matthew 11:12 was John the Baptist who was the one foretold in Malachi 3 Malachi 3:1 behold I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his Temple even the messenger of the Covenant whom ye Delight in behold he shall come saith the Lord of hosts and it shall come to pass when Jesus and it came to pass sorry when Jesus had made an end of commanding his 12 disciples he departed then to teach and to preach in their cities now when John had heard in the prison of the W The Works of Christ he sent two of his disciples and said unto him art thou he that should come or do we look for another and we know brother Bram he said that that at this point John I was just marveling at this John messed with his own testimony wondering if this really was the one but I I just thought about it in my heart and I I just thought how could he not question because of the natural events he was looking for the Great Mighty wonderful Deliverance of Israel just like everyone was this is Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world he knew who he was he recognized him but then he found himself in prison how many times do we find ourselves in natural situations is where I went to where we wonder really am I saved really is this message it am I on the right track is this really it's the devil brothers and sisters you're on the right track don't get weary in well doing this is not time to to get tired Jesus answered and said unto them go and show John again those things which you do hear and see now take this and parallel it with brother bram's message the blind receive their sight not only receive their sight but how could a man say what color of eyes would you like you never had eyes from birth but I'm telling you God that same one that created you he's telling me what color eyes do you want the blind receive their sight and eyes the lame walk he even said that there will be a restoration of Limbs amen the lepers are cleansed and the deaf here and the dead are raised up up and the poor have the gospel preached to them and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me and as they departed Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John what went she out in the wilderness to see what were you expecting a re shaken with the wind but what went ye out for to see a man clothed in soft rment and I just think this is beautiful behold they that wear soft clothing are in King's houses to show them look it this gospel is rugged this gospel is not what you think this gospel is not the religious order of the day amen but what what yel for to see a prophet yay I say unto you and more than a prophet amen God speaking these words to the disciples for this is he of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare the way before thee and I just can't help but think he probably could have wanted to say me verily I say unto you among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force that's Matthew 111-12 h brother Bram here he says this has already taken place this has happened it's over this has already taken place this has happened it's over but note now in Malachi 4 for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yay and all they that do wickedly shall be stubble and in the day that cometh shall burn them up sayith the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor nor Branch but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings amen and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and you shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in that day that I shall do this sayith the Lord of hosts remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel with the statutes and judgments behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse he says see immediately after the coming of this Elijah the Earth will be cleansed by fire and the wicked burn to ashes of course this did not happen at the time of John the Elijah for his day the spirit of God that prophesied the coming of the messenger in Malachi 3:1 John was but reiterating his previous prophetic statement of Isaiah 40:3 made at least three centuries previously the voice of him that crith in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make straight in the desert a highway for our God and you know that's where you can look at it and say this man was a prophet because he absolutely went right back to the scripture and just quoted the word when they came and said to him who are you are you the Messiah are you the one they even asked him are you a prophet and he said no no no I'm just the voice of one amen crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord he quoted exact scripture back to the most religious of the day and they still couldn't comprehend it am now John by the Holy Ghost voiced both Isaiah and Malachi in Matthew chapter 3 for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet isaas saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make his paths straight so we can see we can well see from these scriptures that the prophet of Malachi 3 who was John was not the prophet of Malachi 4 though indeed both John and this last day Prophet have upon them the same Spirit which was upon Elijah now this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelations 10:7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the heart hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be these divinely raled mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so I I think this is just a Hallmark um paragraph for the message of the hour at summer Rises the message of the hour I just love how he says in here that it will literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers this just gets me excited when I start to get excited I got to loosen up here I I apologize but you know I just think it's wonderful because we can look at this and say you know according to the message we we know that it's according to Malachi 4 he'll turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers and and that's where we live and two this is where it it gets really interesting in the message he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders of Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals who knows those things who talks about those things they're mysterious people shy away from it that's why people don't get into the Book of Revelation they don't want nothing to do with it because of those things and it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so I want to say this brothers and sisters if this happens to us if we really do experience these two things as message Believers amen all Mysteries aside the ABCs just happen in our lives we don't have to be told the ABCs because we understand what all of the mystery truths actually are in the message of the hour brother bradam said it how can you do algebra when you can't even do your ABCs you cannot read a mathematical formula a problem you can't read a problem and and be able to Sol it if you don't know how to read it's such a beautiful thing we can say this is wonderful Amen to these things but are we saying Amen to these things because these mystery truths have literally turned our hearts back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers and we actually live our lives marching to the ABCs of the word of God and of the message of the hour I want to say this now someone might actually want to dispute it a and forgive me for it but I want to say that if we are not marching to the word of God in our lives then I want to say that these mystery truths just haven't been revealed brothers and sisters when you get someone saying I know this and I'm preaching this and this is this is mysterious truths and all all the Mysteries are given to us but we're not living it come on right it's not the right representation it will literally right not figuratively and that's what the problem is that's what I'm getting at because sometimes it's shrouded in mystery well it's it's figuratively my heart's turned no no the prophet of God for the seventh age he said literally amen that means the life behind the name is what's going to make the demons tremble it's not going to be saying I know the Mysteries but consider this also this Prophet messenger will be in his nature and manners as were Elijah and John amen the people of this Prophet Messengers day will be as they were in ahab's day my and in John's and since it is only the children whose Hearts will be turned it is only the children who will listen amen amen it made me chuckle a little bit here because the children will listen I say Lord help me to listen in the days of Ahab only 7,000 true seed Israelites were found in the days of John there were also very few the masses in both Ages were in the fornication of idolatry remember we we studied a little while ago and and I'm just going through another Bible study in this in the exposition of the seven Church ages it's just it's beautiful it's just overlapping and I'm I'm getting so much out of it but you you can't have the spirit of nianis where the the spiritual leaders are looking to conquer the leoty without the spirit of balam ism amen right there they're together and we know both of those are actually terrible where if you're not doing it my way if you're not doing it the way that I've been taught if you're not doing it the way my tradition is if you're not doing it the way that my pastor used to if you're not doing it the way that I think then you're doing it wrong it's wrong that's not the way it's supposed to be that's right you know and even Elijah he he he actually thought that he was the only one right I've been jealous for you Lord but he said to him hey you know what I've got seven other thousand people that have not bowed their knee to bail so just relax in the days of Ahab 7,000 only 7,000 true seed Israelites were found the days of John there were also very few the masses and both Ages were in the fornication of idolatry I want to make one more comparison between the leodan prophet messenger and John the prophet messenger who preceded jesus' first coming the people in John's day mistook him for messiah and this is the record of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who who art thou and he confessed and denied not but confessed I am not the Christ that was John 1:1 19-20 now this last day Prophet Messenger will have such power before the Lord that there will be those who mistake him for the Lord Jesus yes there will be a spirit in the world at the end time that will seduce some and make them believe this and you know brothers and sisters this deity spirit came out and really manifested strong in 1961 62 right up just before the seals just before the seals were opened sunset Mountain he went back to Jeffersonville just before all that took place this deity spirit got to the place where it was at it Zenith in and around brother bram's message and he said if you don't stop baptizing in my name if you don't stop trying to make me the Messiah I have to take myself off the field because you make me an antichrist amen because I am not that man I am the one that was standing there when he came but I am not that man and it's just a beautiful thing when I I heard it I I realized isn't it wonderful the way God does stuff he won't let any fornication or idolatry get in the way of his word so here we had God's Prophet right when all of that stirring around was going on it was happening for a reason because God was just about to make the greatest move that took place since Jesus Christ came to the Earth in the flesh these mystery seals these divinely revealed mystery seals were open I I I'm sorry I just get preaching I just think it's wonderful to see these things am interesting there will be a spirit in the world at the end time that will seduce some and make them believe this people will believe that brother Bram was the Messiah people will believe that everything that he said was anointed that everything that he did should be followed you know he was a man he came to introduce Jesus Christ he didn't come to say do every single thing that I do say everything that I say and do it exactly the way I do it and say it the exact way I say it he said get to Jesus Christ when he the spirit of truth comes he will lead and guide you into all truth pointing back to the word again amen Matthew 24 24 to 26 there shall arise false christs and false prophets and show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect he says behold I told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he's in the secret Chambers believe him not you know remember in another scripture I'm not sure which one it is I think it's in Matthew um there will be some that will go and stand before him in that day and say Lord Lord didn't we cast out devils in your name and do many mighty wonders and signs in your name and and he'll say you know what I I never even knew you depart from me and it wasn't that there wasn't introduction there was Zero relationship that's right zero intimacy zero willingness to submit to him as Lord we want to call him Jesus Christ we want to talk about the blood but to absolutely surrender everything unto him as Lord that's a different story you're going a little bit too far there but it's just wonderful to see that you know we can understand that this spirit's going to be there we can also understand that we don't have to fall under that spirit and that's where brothers and sisters when we talk about spirits you get the Holy Spirit you don't have to worry about any Spirit the devil's got no power over you when you got the Holy Ghost amen and I want to say this too the devil's got no power over children of Holy Ghost filled parents am he says but don't you believe it he is not Jesus Christ talking about himself the don't you believe it this this prophet of Malachi 4 is not Jesus Christ he is not the Son of God he is one of the Brethren amen a prophet a messenger a servant of God he needs no greater honor bestowed upon him than that which John received when he was the voice that cried I am not he but he is coming after me amen yes before we close this section on the messenger of the Le oysan age we must seriously consider these two thoughts first this age will have one Prophet Messenger right this is so important because there's another spirit in the land and there's people that want to have another messenger of this age and and that's it's it's it's it's it's sad but it's evil and it's not evil maybe in a malicious way where they want to hurt and harm people and Destroy people but it's a spiritual battle and it it's evil if it's contrary to the word of God remember anything contrary to the word of God even if it's shrouded in a cloak and and and gold and and and very religious and and and and super nice and Flowery doing really good things for other people if it's contrary to the word of God it's evil it's either good or it's evil there's no Middle Ground here in this world in which we live even though the devil would like to propagate that it's okay to just get a little bit gray you can you know move into the gray scale just a little bit no that's not the way it works it's either good or it's bad it's it's Christ or the devil he says but don't you believe it he is not Jesus Christ he is not the Son of God he is one of the Brethren a prophet a messenger a servant of God he needs no great G honor bestowed upon him than that which John received when he was the voice that cried I am not he but he is coming after me before we close this section on the messenger of the leoan age we must seriously consider these two thoughts first this age will have one Prophet messenger Revelations 10:7 says when he singular shall begin to sound there has never been an age where God gave his people two Major Prophets at one time he gave Enoch alone he gave Noah alone he gave Moses he alone had the word though others prophesied John the Baptist came alone now in this last day there is to be a prophet not a propheus not a propheus although in this age there are more women perpetrating to give God's revelation than men that was back then what is it today brothers and sisters you you have female clergy all over the place and where does that come from what's it based on is it based on the word of God the original word of God or is it uh is it a theological study is it from a a council meeting of the Brethren that got together and said well it could be a good idea cuz I'm getting a lot of pressure from my wife at home she really has a message and she'd really like to preach so maybe it comes to the the the council in in in Europe somewhere along the way I don't know where it came out I'm just making it up but I mean where does it come from I think it's beautiful the way he said it not a prophetess although in this age there are more women perpetrating to give God's revelation than men and the infallible word says that he the prophet will reveal the Mysteries to the Endtime people and turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers there are those that say God's people are going to come together through a collective Revelation there are those who say that God's people are going to come together through a collective Revelation I'm I'm I'm I'm just sort of laboring on this for a second because I think it's interesting we can look at what's going on in the denominational world and they're crying for change they're looking for oil they want to see the spirit of God good people want to see it people are looking for Revival that's really the bottom line they want to see Revival they know there's something supposed to happen there's something supposed to come isn't it interesting that people are looking at it from that perspective but yet there was a prophet in the land that told them get back to the word just get back to the word and everything will be fine there will be a Revival and isn't it beautiful to say there is a Revival that's taking place in the land today but it's not a group Revival it's an individual Revival but there are those that say God's people are going to come together through a collective Revelation here we have the prophet just like Jeremiah crying out to Israel get back in line stop worshiping Idols stop sacrificing to Idols get back in line the King of the North is coming down he's being stirred up like a seething Boiling Pot and he's going to pour out all over you just get back to the word yes he says I challenge that statement the Vindicated Prophet says this it's a bald invalid assumption in the face of Revelations 10:7 now I do not deny that people will prophesy in this last age and their Ministries can and will be correct I do not deny that there will be prophets even in even as in the days of Paul when there was one agabus a prophet who prophesied of a famine I agree that is so but I deny I love how this is in capitals I learned once with uh emails this is shouting I but I deny upon the infallible evidence of the word that there is more than one major prophet messenger who will reveal sorry but I deny upon the infallible evidence of the word that there is more than one major prophet messenger who will reveal the Mysteries as contained in the word and who has the ministry to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers thus saith the Lord by his unfailing words stands and shall stand and be Vindicated there is one Prophet Messenger to this age and you know it doesn't matter how many people agree through a collective Revelation that there's an eighth it doesn't matter how many people say it it doesn't does matter how many people say it's okay for women to preach doesn't matter how many people say it's okay to live a homosexual life it doesn't matter how many people say it's okay to do all these things in the world in which we live if it's contrary to the word of God it's evil Amen on the basis of human behavior alone anyone knows that there are many people there is even divided opinion on lesser points of a major Doctrine which they all hold together who then will have the power of infallibility which is to be restored in this last age for this last age is going to go back to manifesting the pure word bride that means we will have the word once again as it was perfectly given and perfectly understood in the days of Paul and that's where I go back to the perfect real realization we can have a revelation but then we can have a perfect realization of that Revelation because the Revelation that we got when it goes back to the word of God when it goes back to the message of the hour we can say that's the perfect realization that God has given this to us it's not something that the devil gave us it's not something that the radio gave us it's not something that we just got from somewhere this is directly from God remember the prophet of God said that when God does that for you that's your personal property nobody can take it from you amen I think it must be like the pride of ownership in someone that might have like a University degree I know we have some very educated individuals in the congregation here and when you have that nobody can take it from you my dad told me that you can always fall back on it get a degree nobody can ever take it from you they can take the degree and tear it up but you have it inside of you but I didn't listen he says I will tell you who will have it it will be a prophit as thoroughly Vindicated or even more thoroughly Vindicated than was any prophet in all the ages from Enoch to this day because this man will of necessity have the Capstone prophetic Ministry and God will show him forth he won't need to speak for himself God will speak for him by the voice of the sign I think that's why every one of us say Amen to William Mariam Bram as the seventh angel messenger because the the voice of that sign you can see the sign but there's nobody ever that could do what he did and and we know that it wasn't who he did there's nobody ever had God moved through them the way that God moved through William Mary and bradam because it was God in William Mariam branam amen the second thought must be impressed on our heart so the first one was there's only one Messenger to this age only one the second thought that must be impressed on our hearts is that the seven Church ages started out with the Antichrist Spirit as well as the Holy Spirit who has has to be blessed forever my the two Vines growing together hey beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world and this is where I say brothers and sisters outside of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives there's no way that we're going to be able to try the spirits the only thing that we're going to do is have a spirit inside of us if we resist the Holy Ghost as people do if we resist the Holy Ghost then we're going to have uh call it a comrade spirit that will actually be controlling us and you know it's interesting because brother Bram said it and and we probably heard the statement before but birds of a feather flock together there's a reason why we gather together here like this because we have similar Spirit but when you see someone acting out and not acting right according to the word of God do they have the Holy Spirit I don't know maybe they do or or maybe they just have taken a break from it the holy spirit's flown up into the tree as brother brandham said doesn't mean that they're a ranked Sinner and that they're lost as lost can be they just need to get back in line they need to get back to where they left off that's all but sometimes when you see people you can see that maybe things don't ly up maybe there's just something a little bit off we've been given the spirit of discernment through the Holy Ghost is what I'm getting at brothers and sisters but it doesn't give us license or Liberty license or Liberty to mistreat that individual amen what it does is it gives us the ability to recognize that maybe our brother maybe our sister is in the day amen and we need to pray for that person we need to Mentor that person we need to reach out and try and help that person not try and kick him not try and push him out but many times people do that oh well you you know in 1 John 4:1 we' we've been told to believe not every spirit because you know what we're supposed to try the spirits right no that's not what it's about it's to understand exactly where we are exactly where we stand to know you know brother Bram talked about it how Jesus did it he went to the well Jacob's Well and sat down sent the disciples away cuz he knew it was going on he had one purpose to be there and that purpose was to talk to someone and to talk to that woman a and to actually contact her spirit to try her spirit we are the same way we've been created the same way if we have his mind in us then we are going to want to contact people's Spirits brother Bram said that I talk to people so I can contact their Spirit I'll talk to them until I can contact their Spirit we do that as human beings it's the way it works did you notice it the Antichrist spirit is identified with false prophets religious as all get out probably the most religious in fact probably knows the most about the mysteries about those divinely revealed secrets that were contained in the seven Thunders probably knows the most about the message of the hour right the Antichrist spirit is identified with false prophets the ages came in with false prophets and they will go out with false prophets now of course there is going to be a real false prophet I love how he says this here there is going to be a man who is completely incarnate as the false the false prophet there will be a real false prophet he says there has to be because the Beast is another being I think a human someone might have more info on that and I'd certainly like to talk about it but there is a beast and there is a false prophet both of them get plucked up and what in Revelations they get thrown in the Lake of Fire amen both of them so there has to be a real false prophet that's why why I'm I'm saying this I think it's really good the way he said this there is a real false prophet in the grand sense of that man mentioned in Revelation but as of now before his Revelation there are to appear many false prophets so close that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible so where are they going to be brothers and sisters it ain't going to be in the Pentecostal Church Matthew 2423 to 26 then if any man shall say unto you Lo here is Christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall shall show shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect it's not like they're going to be ranked Sinners they're not going to be not actually manifesting something why wow they're going to have great signs and wonders but for those that have the Holy Ghost they shall not deceive them those people who have the Holy Ghost will be the very elect amen and and boy I feel like I could preach on that right now too because there's a holy ghost anointing that many people are partakers of in this age but there's very few people that truly have the baptism of the Holy Ghost the true baptism of the Holy Ghost ghost is going to get them in line with the word for their day outside of being in line with the word for your day you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost it really is true some people would want to dispute that and that's okay but those people who have the baptism and the Holy Ghost will come according to the word of God how will you know if it's a false Christ how will you know if it's a false prophet they're going to be mostly on the word except for that one thing right that one or two things they're going to be so close but there's just going to be something that's going to make you scratch your head you'll say my there's just something off brother bradam talks about the Bell that has a crack in it right you know the story he talks about if if a bell is rang and it doesn't sound true there's something off in that Bell sometimes it's like that brothers and sisters maybe why you're harping on this brother Barry I just want to say it we need to know where we [Applause] stand I mean let's let's do this let's just just do this I think it's important brothers and sisters what if we have a flock what if we have I'm just going to say it a false prophet in the flock and what if that false prophet now starts to intermingle with the flock and talk to Children talk to children in in the flock right and the children see the brother or the sister as a good person but yet nobody actually does anything what happens is that little tiny bit of residue that can come from that person it's a spirit can get on that child and now that child can have that little residue of a spirit in their life and not even know it and the thing about it is the way the devil works this is the way the devil Works he's not going to manifest a religious spirit in a child what will happen is that child will now turn into a rebellious child child amen and parents will scratch their head and say why is that child acting that way what's going on I did everything for them we taught them the word we da I'm not saying this is exactly the way it happens don't get me wrong what I'm saying is it could happen this way that's why it's important for us to know where we stand amen we've got to know we're supposed to try the spirits brothers and sisters that's the word of God that's not brother Barry saying it but how are we going to know if someone is on on on if someone is in line with the word if they're actually a true Prophet or a false prophet they're going to be in line with the word they're going to be exactly in line with the word there's not going to be any excuses and if they're outside of the word and somebody says to them you're not in line with the word what's up they're going to say oh my I'm so sorry I apologize and come maybe before the church and say I misquoted that forgive me for it I don't want to be wrong with the word but when the correction comes if they start to puff up and say oh uh uh right right you know them by their fruits amen when correction comes how do we behave these false prophets are earmarked for us in various other scriptures such as the following 2 Peter 2: 1-2 but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privy shall bring IND damnable heresies even denying the Lord that brought them and bring upon themselves Swift destruction and many shall follow their pernicious Ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of why I'm not going to I'm not going to I'm not going to I'm just going to keep reading for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust they shall Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and there's never been a time where that's possible now brothers and sisters you can just click on this pastor and this ministry and this pastor and this ministry and you can have a whole series of pastors and Ministries that you follow online heaping to themselves teachers having great gifts and and and I say that there's anointed tremendous Ministries way better than brother Barry but when they're preaching who are they preaching to amen what's what's being done what's the purpose of it and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils so this sounds I'm probably going to preach on this brothers and sisters I have to this sounds like a wow a doctrine of devil it's a raging thing it's terrible you know what a doctrine of devil is I'll give you an example I just feel inspired this is the Lord here a doctrine of a devil is one word off one word off that's a doctrine of a devil isn't it wasn't that Satan that old serpent in the devil in the Garden of Eden that came and talked to Eve and got h just just just misbelieve one word thou shalt not surely die and and what' she do she became a victim of this she was actually turned away from the truth and turned to a fable what's a fable it's a story that you make up in your mind that somebody comes up with amen and it's not the word of God don't get caught up in a fable we want to make sure that we know we're in line with the word of God I should call the musicians cuz I feel like I could really just get started here I love this book it's wonderful now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils 1 Timothy 4:1 now in every case you will notice that a false prophet is one who is outside the word love how he says that in every case you will notice that a false prophet is one who is outside the word and and brothers and sisters that's that's the ear mark That's the Hallmark that is where we live that's what we believe it's what we we we breathe it we eat it it's who we are it's the essence of who we are is understanding that we follow a prophet that pointed to the word of God that is the only way we could perceive him that we could receive him that we could understand him to be a prophet right that he pointed get back in line get back to the word that's what attracted me I I saw the pictures on the wall I saw the halo over his head the the Sam Houston Coliseum picture the pillar of fire I I saw the cloud picture I saw all these things when I first was brand new Christian and thought my they're following a man is man worship it's cultish but then I learned that you can get a hold of these messages and you can listen to them for yourself so I was given a little MP3 player maybe stand with me as we close my brother-in-law gave it to me of 1965 and I listened to it over and over and over and over I was so thankful that I got that because it it just it just did something to me it let me see that all he did was point back to the word am back to the word and and I I couldn't say that he was a false prophet on any point because he pointed to Christ he simply pointed to the word of God so how could he be a false prophet anyways God bless you tonight certainly enjoy these studies it just is so inspiring amen let's just bow in prayer Heavenly Father we're so thankful that you have given us the ability to try the spirits Lord you have given us a measuring tape Lord so to speak where we can take the things that we see and we can measure them with your measure with your scale and father we know that when we measure things if if they don't fit your scale we can just leave them alone we know that they don't match your word that it's not of you because you will never deny any portion of your word father we thank you that you've given us discernment to try the spirits to know that Lord when correction comes our way that alls we do is get in line we know that you said that anyone who doesn't receive correction is not your child and it's not pleasant for the present time but what it does is it brings to pass the Peaceable fruit of righteousness in our lives and I believe that's what every one of us wants Lord and tonight I pray that Lord you would just strengthen and encourage your children as we go forwards Lord that we would be able to try the spirits yes Lord father that we would be able to exercise your spirit in our lives Lord not for great signs and wonders but Lord Jesus more than anything to apply the token we know that judgment has been declared as thus saith the Lord on this land in which we live and we know that the Death Angel is coming through the land father just like your children in Israel and Goan they were given instructions through a prophet and that Prophet told them what to do and now they had the opportunity to apply what that Prophet said or not and if they didn't do it the way the prophet said that meant that Destroyer would kill the firstborn of their homes father I pray that tonight we would take that instruction that you gave to us through a prophet you are the same yesterday today and forever Lord father help us to apply the token to our homes Lord help us to apply the token accordingly to our own lives Lord help us to understand that we are in the breach between Time and Eternity right now any moment things could change father I pray that you would help me Lord I don't claim to be perfect father I am so far from perfect I just find myself where you put me and Lord I pray that I could just stay true to you stay true to your word and encourage your children to go on to experience that full measure of your spirit Lord father we love you and we thank you tonight and we just commit each life now into your hands as we go our separate ways in jesus' name we pray amen amen amen can we sing 438 438 I just was thinking about the Rapture and I just can't help but think you know I feel like traveling on and I'm sure that's a a mutual feeling and in our lives we see this world the way it's going you know things could get really really crazy really fast in the world in which we live amen and you know even if they do brothers and sisters we got a promise we don't have to live in fear
