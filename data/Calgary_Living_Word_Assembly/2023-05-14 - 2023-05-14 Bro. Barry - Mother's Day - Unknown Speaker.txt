father that you would speak to us as we go with you along the way just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you this morning thank you musicians do you have your Bibles this morning I would just like to read a couple of scriptures started in Matthew chapter 6. Matthew chapter 6. you have it say Amen this morning and I'd like to read from First Corinthians First Corinthians chapter 2. Matthew chapter 6 verse 43. says ye have heard that it hath been said Thou shalt Love Thy Neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you might be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have you you're not even Republicans the same and if ye salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not even the public and so be ye therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven which is in heaven is perfect turn over to First Corinthians chapter 2. very familiar scripture First Corinthians chapter 2 verse 9. but as it is written I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the thing things which God hath prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the Deep things of God is bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father Lord we just thank you for your word thank you for the opportunity to gather together again one more time lord around this word but father not just the word on print but we want the word father that's been revealed to us Lord by your spirit and we know that it will be your word revealed by the spirit because it will always point to your word father it won't lead us in another Direction so father this morning we pray that you would just break this bread of life to us fresh once again Lord revealed to us father a little more about ourselves father and thereby revealing a little bit more of you in US father Lord we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated it's uh a wonderful time here and a wonderful day it's nice to see the Green Grass and the birds certainly plan to wish the mothers a happy Mother's Day I just wanted to wait till we got a little ways into the service for that just want to say God bless you mothers amen don't be bashful give them a hand they have done something Wonderful by giving birth to children and not just giving birth to children but by raising children by encouraging children by training them up in the way they should go by being the pastors of the home by being the ones that pick up the slack they fill in the blanks they do all the little things that the dads don't many times the kids don't so many things the moms do and you know many times there isn't a big thank you for it and uh the world has it such that there's many different Mother's Days around the world in many different countries and you know this is just sort of the country that we live in North America celebrates this day and we know that it's not really a religious holiday it's not a religious day that's recognized that way and we don't want to make it anything other than it is just a day that we can say thank you to our moms but I I want to say this just like uh birthdays or or special days in our lives we don't want to wait for one day out of the year to say thank you for things that are done for us we want to remember our moms every single day we want to remember our wives every single day our husbands our parents we want to give thanks to the Lord every single day of Our Lives if we just waited for one day out of the year to do that it wouldn't be much of a relationship so God bless you moms certainly hope that Lord the Lord blesses you today and every day and uh yeah I hope you have a wonderful day today a little bit of a a break from our traditional I guess teaching today I just wanted to go a little bit of a different direction I believe the Lord led me down a road here before we get too far with that we just have a few announcements um we had the gym night on Friday night it was such a wonderful time thank you sister Shelly for putting that together for us initially we had thought that Jim was a little bit small because it was the auxiliary gym but it turned out to be just perfect because that gym was right beside the field and it was one of the most beautiful evenings that I think we've had so far this year and we played in the gym and we played outside of the gym and it was just a wonderful time for all so thank you I guess the ladies brunch yesterday was good that's the report I I had and we're certainly thankful for that um just want to make it very clear to anyone who maybe wasn't a part of it or even those who were a part of it if there's any question about it it's all based on scripture it's not a tradition we're not trying to bring something funny around the message of the hour we're not trying to bring in a program or something where we're going to be trading our power for a program that's that's rubbish if that's what somebody is thinking or if somebody has said that that's not at all what it is it's according to scripture and if you would like to talk about it we certainly could but I believe it was a wonderful time and uh you know it's just going to help the body and I think that this body that we live in the body that we have of Believers we we need each other that's why we gather together and and sometimes one part of the body has a little bit more information about another part of the body and we can share that information to the other part of the body and thereby help that part of the body if if we just Reserve information and and everything is fine for us but our brother is suffering what good are we for the body we need to be able to help one another and the word is very clear on the sisters doing so so God bless you each one for taking part in that um we just wanted to mention that we're going to have the vote for the church offices it will be the week of the 21st to the 22nd and announced on the 28th um again the requirements for voting uh by the bylaws for the charitable organization here is you need to be 18 years of age or older you need to be in regular attendance of the assembly and you need to be paying tithe and that entitles you uh the ability to vote we will be doing it through the SurveyMonkey app once again and as I said we'll give it the span of the week and then we'll announce the results on the 28th all of the uh Brethren I should have mentioned um who were in the capacity serving and capacity of deacons Treasurer and trustees they all have desired to serve again for another year even though we're halfway through um certainly thank each one for your efforts again there's a lot of things that happen behind the scenes that we don't see that we're not aware of that just get looked after and we certainly are thankful for each one being in their office um just a couple quick announcements for the schedule on the 19th we have a prayer meeting that's this Thursday coming up we have a potluck at our house on the 21st it will be the first one of the season so we're very excited about that we have a communion service coming up on the 28th uh which is the end of the month and that will be a six o'clock service six in the evening uh June the 7th we have brother Dale Smith coming that's a Wednesday we have the uh del mundo family coming in July and that's going to be a wonderful time we're going to have some Services then I don't have them established just yet but once we do we will confirm the dates with you we have brother Andrew Glover confirmed for August 13th you'll be here August 13th and likely we'll have two Services a Saturday evening and a Sunday morning and then um I didn't mention this in the past and I apologize but it's a long ways out we have brother James new Vanda Bandy coming September 27th he's going to do kind of a Western Canadian visitation so we had uh had the occasion to have him here so that's a Wednesday night as well are you happy this morning this morning in our scripture we uh we talked about from from Matthew chapter six I think it's such a beautiful topic and uh certainly wonderful to just see the word of the Lord and and how he he talks to his disciples and and explains to the people when when Jesus I just can't help but think this is Jesus having a church service and explaining to the people in verse 43 of Matthew chapter 5. you know he says have you heard that they that it hath been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you why would we do that in in verse 45 he explains that answer he answers that question that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven so how do we be our the children of Our Father which is in heaven how do we express that life we forgive those we don't we don't hold things against people we understand that our enemies are our people that you know brother Branham said it very clearly we would never we wouldn't wish it on our worst enemy to go to that place called hell and you know that's one of the things that just flies off the lips of people they just tell people to go there it just is commonplace in the world they say it all the time just like they take the name of our dear Lord in vain all the time what a tremendous thing that is terrible thing but people do it all of the time and they don't recognize that it's not the people doing it it's the evil spirit that's in them or the evil spirits sometimes it's a plethora of evil that's inside people and they'll put on a tie in a suit and and be polished up as as all get out but just as insane and crazy as maybe a Madman in another continent and you know I remember it with brother Gilbert when we were there in Kenya and and one time after a service we were driving down the road and he pointed out a man I didn't even see him because there's so many people everywhere but I didn't see this one in particular man and brother Gilbert said see that that's a Madman right there and and and he was you could tell just by seeing when I was able to perceive this man he had all the signs of someone that was completely out of his mind and you know we can see it here in Calgary too um doesn't take long yesterday we were up in the area where I was raised and there was people that were just like that right there and I thought my goodness look at these people but these are the ones that we're supposed to love brothers and sisters these are the ones that would despitefully use us if they could and what does the word say we're supposed to bless those people how much more are brothers and our sisters I don't think this gives us any room to say oh I don't believe the way they I don't I can't go to that church because of the way they do whatever they do that that is that anything to do with this I don't know verse 45 that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for we maketh the sun to rise on the evil they get the sunshine too they get the nutrients of the sun they get the vitamin D they get the blessing of the age but they also get the curse of the age too if they don't have the Holy Ghost Inside of them if they don't have that sea Gene of God inside of them that same Sun is going to rise on them is going to cause that seed to actually come to life and they're going to manifest the life that's inside of them because of the anointing of this age they don't recognize it that it's not just the s-u-n that Rose in this age it's the s-o-n and this word is going to cause people to behave in a certain way but it will rise on the evil and the good both of them get it they get the benefit of it and sendeth the Reign on the just and the unjust my goodness so many times in my life I would look at people who would just do things to me terrible things to me in particular and say Lord curse them I I would just like to see something happen in their life oh my now I can step back with a little tiny bit more maturity I wouldn't say a lot because I'm still a child here on Earth and I got a long ways to go to be perfect as the word says in my own mind but I'm so thankful that the Lord hadn't cursed those people that I had said that imagine in our lives if we did live in that emotional realm where our emotions could just take control and if we got angry one day upset with someone they're our friend one day and they said something to hurt us and now they're our enemy the next day we're blessed them today and cursing them tomorrow it'd be a terrible place but here we have Jesus God in flesh speaking to mankind saying you know what it's okay don't worry about it you just be you you just worry about yourself get into your own position make sure that you're perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect don't look at your enemies don't try and perfect yourself with your enemies or those who persecute you or despitefully use you don't don't worry about trying to see that contrast just look at the Lord in heaven and make yourself perfect like he is where I'm going with this I'll just tell you honestly I've been real touched by the life of Lori Wilson I was able to meet this man a little while ago and met him a few times and had some conversations with him a few times and you know it was so amazing for me because we we the last time I talked to him he had called me that week and said you know come and see me Barry come and see me and you could tell he was afraid he wanted to be baptized and he was in a position where he couldn't be baptized now he was laying in a bed and the only thing he could move was his head but he was gasping for air a little bit he couldn't catch his breath and and then he would be fine for a few hours and then he couldn't catch his breath and for those people that don't know this is a man that was suffering from ALS he was in the final stages of of Lou Gehrig's disease ALS and he was laying in the bed and only thing he could do is move his head and he he talked about how frustrating it was to be in that position and how how he suffered with with wondering what kind of a day he was going to have it depended on the type of people that were going to come through his door because the room that he was in in the hospice that he was in he couldn't do anything for himself he could do nothing for himself actually there was one thing he could do and he did it he he had like a jacket that was here and and he would grab it with his teeth and he would lift it up when he felt a little chilly on his throat and that was the only thing he could do for himself everything else was completely dependent on someone else and and he said my day depends on the person that they send through that door I I have no idea who it's going to be and whether they're going to be rough to me they don't he said I had to explain to them every single day how I need to be taken out because rarely did he get the same person the next day it was always someone different but just talking to him he he was expressing that he knows that he is going that the Lord is going to take him and he doesn't know what it's going to be like and he's wondering what the last few moments of his life are going to be like the final stages of Lou Gehrig's Disease they they they they basically your your body stops and and he was not looking forward to those last few moments and I'll spare you the details but but what I said to him was brother if you can't be baptized and you desire to be baptized God knows your heart he's greater than our hearts you don't have to worry about whether you will actually be there or not if that's your desire and I said to him Rory what do you want to do with your life if you could be healed why would you want to be healed what would you want to do with it and and I probably told some of the people this but his eyes flashed and I could tell he was excited about that thought because he said to me I've thought about that and if I could be healed what I would do is I would I would live my life for other people I would go to church and I would get baptized and I would help as many people as I could in my life and I thought here we have a man that's dying but but but I'm living and I think many times oh no that brother wants help with this or I gotta go and do that or he would never do that for me who am I what kind of a person a human being am I so encouraging to think that a man the only thing he could do is speak with his mouth and and move a jacket up or down he has the desire to do all he can my goodness one of the things he said to me was if I could do anything I would just get to living as hard as I could and I can't help but think brothers and sisters I just want to encourage us to just get living as hard as we can help as many people as you can in your life brother Branham said that's that's what eternal life is it's living for others it's not seeing how much I can get how much I can amass how much I can save no it's not about that at all it's about helping other people the end of the day we're only going to have our name and when we live our lives for others it's not even going to be our name it's going to be his name right we're going to be we're going to be living for Christ I just have been so inspired by this this experience that I had with with brother Rory and I just out of the beyond the curtain of time if if you don't mind bringing it up Brothers there's just uh just a quote it's uh paragraph 38. brother brother Neville he reads this in this message it's out of 1961.0305 if you wanna listen to this later look it up but brother Branham he's given this opportunity this opportunity to go to the other side I probably won't be able to do this without getting emotional it's just such a a wonderful thing sometimes it's not tears of of sadness it's tears of joy and that's what this is today if you see me emotional are you able to find it paragraph 38 brother Neville reads from February 1961 Full Gospel men's voice he uh I'm not sure why I'll just go ahead though but the novel reads this this is what brother Brown I'm expressing what he experienced the other morning I was laying on my bed I had just awoke from sleep and I place my hands behind my head and relaxed with my head on the pillow that I began to wonder what it will be like on the other side I realized I had lived more than half my life if I live to be as old as my people and I wanted to do more for the Lord before I left this life it's pretty amazing here in 1961 he started preaching in 48 and he wanted to do something for the Lord my brother goes on to say I Heard a Voice saying you're just starting press the battle keep pressing as I lay there pondering the words I thought that I had just imagined that I had excuse me heard a voice again the voice said keep press the battle keep going keep going still unbelieving I thought that possibly I had spoken the words myself I placed the Lips My Lips between my teeth and held my hand over my mouth and listened The Voice spoke again just keep pressing if you only knew what was what is at the end of the road I seem to hear the music and the words of an old familiar song I'm homesick and blue I want to see Jesus I would like to hear those Harbor bells chime it would brighten my path and banish all fears Lord let me look past the curtain of time I just want to mention this as well you can probably find it on YouTube if you type in those Harbor bells chime I think it comes up with that somebody did a little collage with brother Branham speaking those words singing those words and uh it's just a wonderful visualization of of looking past the curtain of time goes on to say then the voice asked would you like to see just beyond the curtain I answered it would help me so much what happened I cannot say whether I was in the body or out or whether I was it was a translation I I do not know but it was unlike any Vision I had ever had I could see the place to which I was taken and I could see myself lying back there upon my bed I said this is a strange thing there were great numbers of people and they came running to greet me saying oh our precious brother first came young women apparently in their 20s and they would embrace me they said our precious brother young men and the Brilliance of Young Manhood with eyes glistening like stars on a darkened night with teeth as white as pearls embraced me saying our precious brother then I noticed that I too had become young again I looked at myself there and turned and looked back at my old body lying on the bed with my hands behind my head I said I don't understand this I just want to remind everyone don't be looking for elderly people we're not going to see old people we're going to see young people and many times the people that we love are elderly when they pass on but they're not going to be when they come back they're going to be young people when we come back and I think it's beautiful because we're going to have the ability to recognize them goes on to say as I began to try to comprehend the place where I was I began to realize that there was no yesterday and no tomorrow there can you just imagine that thought there's no sense of urgency there's no schedule there's no pressure there's no sense of time there's there's nothing other than perfect love which is what we're getting to with this and I'm probably just going to keep sprinkling this in because I don't want to wait till the end until we start talking about that brothers and sisters this is what he's talking about is perfect love this is perfection that he's talking about there's no time there's no yesterday or tomorrow what a beautiful thought as I try as I began to try to comprehend a place where I was I began to realize that there was no yesterday and no tomorrow there no one seemed to get tired I just love that thought as a multitude of the most beautiful young woman I have ever seen through their arms around me I discovered there was only a great love that overwhelmed me and no physical attraction as in the human behavior wouldn't that be nice Brothers I noticed these young women all wore their hair down to their waistline and their skirts went down to their feet after this hope my first wife hugged me and said my precious brother then another young woman hugged me and hope turned and hugged the young woman said I don't understand this this is something entirely different from our human love I don't want to go back to that old body in bed did you ever hear that voice some people might say no you can't hear a voice there's no way that you can audibly hear a voice you know what that might be for some people but there's others that say Amen I've heard a voice I hear that voice speak to me all the time but the random says then a voice spoke to me this is what you preached the Holy Ghost is this is perfect love nothing can enter here without it so I just want to pause there and just say brothers and sisters if there's anything in our lives if there's any residue if there's any hurts if there's any pains if there's any any grudges if there's any problems or situations or things in our lives we're not going to take them there so you might as well get rid of them here this is why we get the word of God so that we can wash that stuff out of our Lives not so that we can say I amen God sent a prophet but I've still got this Grudge in my life I can't get rid of we've got to be willing to wash it out because that's the only thing that's going to make it there is perfect love remember we've said it I think brother Branham has said it you probably heard other ministers say it it's one of the biggest tricks of the devil for the people that have the Holy Ghost for him to trick them out of thinking they've got it and the people that think they've got it to be tricked into thinking they've got it when they really don't there's only one true evidence of of the Holy Ghost in our lives and that's the ability to receive the word for our day and you know what it's not saying Amen to the word what it is is living the word when we can live the word that the prophet brought To Us by every letter that demonstrates the life of Jesus Christ that's perfect love then a voice spoke to me this is what you preached that the Holy Ghost is this is perfect love nothing can enter here with it without it next I was taken up and seated on a high place all around me were great numbers of men and women in the bloom of Youth they were crying with joy oh our precious brother we are so happy to see you here I thought I I'm not dreaming for I can see these people and and I can see my body lying back there on the bed and some people might say this is just a crazy stretch of the imagination this is just some man hallucinating some some might say maybe he had a hot pepper salad that night before he went to bed right we know that that's the way it is the devil will be that way but you know there's some people also that will say amen that's that's that's more than life to me I can understand that this is for a purpose this is for an encouragement to a certain group of people The Voice spoke to me you know it's written in the Bible that the prophets were gathered with their people I said yes I remember that in the scriptures but there are not this many branhams The Voice replied these are not branhams these are your converts the ones you have led to the Lord and some of these women you think are are so young and beautiful were more than 90 years old when you led them to the Lord no wonder they are crying out my precious brother then the multitude cried together if you hadn't gone forth with the gospel we wouldn't be here brothers and sisters I want to say that's not just a group of people and I know we've heard it all before that's not just a group of people somewhere out there in a different dimension beyond the curtain of time that that we can say one of these days we'll see that group of people I want to say this he was in a different dimension that was called eternity before the foundation of the world right there he wasn't in space or time he was in Perfection there's only one thing that's perfect and that's Eternal that's God's own life he was beyond the curtain of time and you know he was talking to us I want to say that some of these young sisters here some of these elderly sisters here maybe you were there speaking to him before the foundation of the world these are the people that were his converts he goes on to say I asked oh where's Jesus I want to see him can you imagine having that realization recognizing this is it man I'm I'm beyond the curtain of time and and now I know where I'm at I recognize this I'm starting to get the gist of what's going on now where's Jesus I really want to see him because he's the one that got me here my goodness where's Jesus I want to see him the people who replied he's he's just a little higher someday he'll come to you you were sent as a leader and when God comes he will judge you according to your teaching but Toby brought this and I just I just think it's so magnificent to read this and to recognize our position he I asked does does Paul and Peter have to stand this judgment also the answer was yes I can just imagine yes in in the soul of William Mary and Bradham when he was there to think the gravity of that situation are they going to be judged he could just say yes I could you imagine if you had mingled something with it and you were standing there and they have to be judged and the only thing that's going to be accepted is the word of God and to stand there and think uh oh I'm in the position now where maybe I had just a little bit of something sprinkled in there something that just kept a little bit of residue of Grudge or a problem or something that was unresolved in my life there's just that thing there my but here he is yes the answer was yes I said I have preached what they preached I did not divert from it to one side or the other were they baptized in the name of Jesus I did too where they taught the baptism in the Holy Spirit I did too whatever they taught I taught also didn't say it was some other culture it was from some other time it was the olden days that was the word of God revealed to me in my day and I said amen to it we know that the people cried and we're know that we're going to back to Earth with you sometime Jesus will come and judge you according to the word you preached us then you will present us to him and all together we will go back to Earth and live forever I asked do I have to go back to Earth now they answered yes but keep pressing on just can't imagine what that would be like it sure is nice to try as I began to move from that beautiful joyful place as far as my eyes could see people were coming towards me to embrace me crying my precious brother suddenly I was back on my bed again I said oh God help me never let me compromise with the word let me stay straight on that word I want to say it brothers and sisters let us stay straight on that word don't don't have any room for any deviation from that word don't let anything get between you and that word Satan's gonna do everything that he can to try and destroy your faith in that word and if he can do it he he'll destroy your opportunity to see this land but we're so thankful that if you have been called if you have been chosen if you are one of them then you won't miss it and and will always line up with the word of God it's such a wonderful thing that was what I was trying to express to to Rory you know what's going to happen is you're just going to breathe out brother you're just going to take your last breath here and then you're just going to take in your next breath there it's just going to be stepping from one dimension to the other you don't have to worry you don't have to be afraid if the desire in your heart is to serve God then he knows it because he's greater than our heart brother you don't have to worry it was such a wonderful time to just talk to him and I I personally I guess why I'm so moved by it I didn't recognize that that last Wednesday would be the last time I'd speak to him on this side of Eternity we went to visit him again on uh Thursday thinking that he'd be there and and what we got to see was a memorial sign on the wall saying in memory of Rory Wilson that was it he was gone and he passed quickly it was such a a kind of a sad thing to hear about but at the same time what a tremendous thought to be able to express what it would be like to go beyond the curtain of time with someone who was just about to take that step it just really did something to me why brother Adam goes on to say I'm more convinced than ever in my life that it will take perfect love to enter that place there was no jealousy no tiredness no sickness no old age no death only Supreme Beauty and joy I I just can't help but be encouraged by this and and think you know sometimes I don't even know why the Lord wants to go a certain direction but I usually find out afterwards that someone was having a conversation someone had a prayer something was going on and so here we are brothers and sisters it's kind of a different direction but you know in this message beyond the curtain of time in 1961 zero three zero five brother Branham he gives instructions as he goes on he says whatever you do lay aside everything else until you get perfect love how many people here today have perfect love I don't want to put anybody on the spot but what I do want to say brothers and sisters if we've got anything getting in the way from us getting that perfect love then we need to do something about it we have to take the steps to get rid of whatever is hindering us from receiving that perfect love and what that perfect love is quite simply is the Holy Ghost in our lives and we need to know that we know that we know that we've got the Holy Ghost in our lives and I want to say it this way if you don't know that you got the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters ask him to give you the Holy Ghost and he will give you the Holy Ghost and if you don't have a confirmation in your life that you've got the Holy Ghost ask him to give you a confirmation that you've got the holy ghost in your life and I promise you he'll give it to you he will give it to you and if we need to have a prayer meeting Brothers and Sisters Let's have a prayer meeting that you'll get the Holy Ghost in your life I remember my former Pastor he said if you ever need to pray through just call me and we'll pray through and you know what we did that we took the opportunity to pray through sometimes we need that in our lives sometimes there's things that just aren't resolved we don't understand we can't comprehend just by prayer and supplication God will come on the scene and minister to us but if we never give them the opportunity and we just say no you know it's good I've got it it's everything is fine in my life everything is okay we talked about it on Wednesday there's two classes of people those ones that will say Lord be it unto me according to Thy word I just want to make it right with you I don't ever want to have anything in the way just be it unto me and there'll be other ones that will say no I'm good I got it got the message 1970. I had it for years brother it's all fine I know I got the holy ghost in my life we got to be careful my goodness I want to say this if you've been baptized in titles have you really received the Holy Ghost whatever you do brothers and sisters lay aside everything else until you get perfect love get to where you can love everybody even your enemy no matter if the plane is rocking the lightning is flashing or The Guns of the enemy are upon you remember these are the words I believe of God through the prophet it's not just a man speaking this is God speaking no matter if the plane is rocking the lightning is flashing of the guns of the enemy are upon you these things do not matter perfect love perfect love so you can love your enemies the people that despitefully use you if you see someone willfully doing you wrong does that change your relationship with God whether Branham goes on to say if you're not saved except Jesus Christ as your savior now if you have not been baptized in water be baptized now if you have not received the baptism in the Holy Spirit receive it now press on to that perfect love which will take you to that beautiful and joyful place beyond the curtain of time brothers and sisters we've got a baptismal tank in the basement if you want to get baptized you can do it all you have to do is say the word I want to say it this way sometimes there's people that have been baptized but they don't really recognize why or the Devil comes around and tries to beat them up over it I'm not saying that we should get baptized every week or every year or every month but sometimes in our lives we need to drive down a stake I would say into the heart of our enemy and say hey you know what maybe I was baptized when I was 11 and I just never really realized what it meant but the devil has badgered me for years over it and I want to drive down a stake and say hey I know that I know and I want to point Satan to that time or that time you choose which time Satan but I've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and that means that I shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost because that's the promise unto me and my children and as many as it are far off even as many as the Lord shall call in my day brothers and sisters I want to say it today where are we positionally what's our position are we in Christ or or are we around Christ are are we beside Christ are are we close to Christ because if we're close it's not going to be close enough we've got to be in Christ he has to be in us we have to be in him where are we personally personally where is our position with him we have to know that talking about this out of beyond the curtain of time paragraph 43. the Branham talks about love and faith he says because of this that we might know that our efforts are not in vain see we must approach God through that channel of love and faith Faith takes us to the channel love is the one that takes us in I I'm pausing with this and you might be thinking it's such a simple thing why are you reading it like that brother Barry maybe I'm I'm a little sleepy today I'm trying to emphasize it I want to make it real clear it's not just uh it's not just love that gets us there and it's not just faith that gets us there here we have the prophet of God saying it's faith and love and it's not having faith that gives us the ability to have love in fact I think he's saying it the other way around it's that love that gets inside of us that causes us to have faith and I think it's so important for us to get that point across in our lives that you know what we're not going to have perfect Faith unless we get perfect love and perfect love is going to demonstrate that perfect faith in our lives and I know I've been talking about the third poll brothers and sisters but I want to make sure that we're crystal clear you understand my position on it having great signs and wonders being able to say that we said the right thing for the Holy Ghost and now the Holy Ghost is going to move on the scene we're going to see a great sign and wonder that isn't going to do it for us that won't get us into that perfect place that could heal our body here that could fill our bank account but will it give us salvation that's the key that's the critical Factor here we want to get salvation we want to know that we know where we stand but it's it's faith God's faith in us that we need and the only way we're going to have that is to have his love love is the one that takes us in that's what's going to do it for us we have the ability to get to that place and we we I I don't know I guess the inspiration for me is just to cry out brothers and sisters once again just to say that make sure you got the holy ghost in your lives maybe we could just end the service now and go home and and have Mother's Day but I know we got a whole lot more but if I had to end it right now I would say just get baptized by the Holy Ghost and know that you are saved know that you've got the holy ghost in your life no you've got the token the Seal of God that you can say amen I know that if I walk out of here and get hit by a bus I'm going to this place that brother Bradham was talking about I'm not going to be afraid so many people you see they're afraid they're afraid to die brothers and sisters even in the message of the hour it's staggering to think what are we afraid of what's the fear Satan plays on that Satan loves that when we're afraid when we start to get afraid oh no I'm gonna die I'm gonna get a sickness and die I'm gonna get an illness and and pass away you can never die if you believe this word of God you're as Eternal as he is eternal he will not lose one part of himself get the Holy Ghost in your life and then whatever happens happens here I'm talking like someone with authority I feel like I sound like a madman forgive me but you know brothers and sisters there's only one thing that we have for us in our day get the Holy Ghost and you know when he lives out we're going to demonstrate a different life we're not going to be what's in it for me in every situation that we're living we're going to say what's in it for them because I recognize that I've got the pearl of great price I own all of this I don't have to fight for it out of this message be on the curtain of time brother Bradham says could you imagine an artist painting this is paragraph 45 could you imagine an artist painting a great picture beautiful till it's Sublime and then just tearing it up could you imagine that taken maybe months to paint a picture and get it just exactly right and then just tear it up at the end ah I don't like it brother says there would be something wrong with the artist could you imagine a composer writing a song Until It's Sublime and then just tear up his music sheet tear up his music up says there would be something wrong with the composer see there's nothing wrong with God don't make a thing like this just to tear it up and throw it away I want to say brothers and sisters that's a denominational teaching that's that's a doctrine of a devil that says you're saved today and that you're lost tomorrow and then you can go and come and get saved maybe you can do a little bit of service for the church or a little bit of service for your family or the community or maybe tie the little extra and God will bless you and bring you back into the fold you're either saved or you're not and if you're saved you're saved until your day of redemption if you've got the token it's over brother Branham says there'd be something wrong with the composer see if he's just going to tear up his music there's nothing wrong with God God Don't Make a thing like this and just tear it up and throw it away he's not going to save you today to lose you tomorrow I'm just throwing my words in there I'll go back to it he says it is it's for his kingdom it's for his glory and he's speaking about each one of us he says each one of us has a part in this picture and in this song we are parts of the kingdom of God and that is that we can play our parts as long as we realize Where We Are positionally belong in this place and then stay right there in that place and one place we know it's in love because that's what makes up the picture so brothers and sisters I just want to say it today and I know maybe people might get upset at me for saying it but just stay in your lane let's just stay in our lane let's find out what our lane is in the word of God and just stay in our Lane and if something happens if the plane starts rocking and the enemy's guns are trained upon us and and people are despitefully using us and maybe we see someone doing something that's totally wrong according to the word is that going to change our ability to worship him is that going to change our ability to go to church is it going to change our ability to know that we know that we know what happens when that happens is we give Satan the occasion to change our experience and of course we live in a world where we have emotions and and and and that's the biggest battle that's the greatest battle ever fought it's in the mind right that's the greatest battle ever fought is to be able to subdue the emotions the mind game that happens and and to be able to Just Surrender ourselves to the word of God to the spirit of the Lord in our lives and that's why I say we have many times we can look at at the lives of people and say there's so many people that are afflicted in our flesh and you know I have ailments now I've got this and that and the other I could go on and on write you a list a laundry list of things that's wrong with this flesh this flesh is going to perish I'm not worried about this flesh I'm worried about this inner man I'm worried about the soul that's inside that's the one that I'm worried about brothers and sisters and all the rest of it will just follow if this flesh has to fall apart so be it it ain't going to change the soul that's inside of me but we have a great problem I believe in this world in general I'm not saying in this church or congregation but in this world in general with a mental illness and it's hidden we can't see it so many people are afflicted and they can't help it because they don't understand it but there is a delivering power and the delivering power is the old Backwoods Blue Sky Holy Ghost preacher and that's what's going to change people that's what will help people it's not going to join a church and and living a better life that's going to help us sure we might feel better for a day but then tomorrow is going to come brother Adam he says this each one of us play a part in this picture in this song where parts of the kingdom of God and that is we can play our parts as long as we realize where we are positionally if we can recognize a husband this is the husband's job description all we have to do is live that this is a father's job description this is a mother's job description these are the descriptions this is the position that we have been given I personally believe it with all my heart that is the manifestation of God's word in our lives because how many people can say amen God sent a prophet and and you have a problem in the home maybe the husband and the wife they separate how many times have we seen that in and around the message of the hour how many times the devil isn't restricted to any group just because we say that we belong to something doesn't mean a thing but boy oh boy when you pull it out and you say no no no no no you know what I'm not a part of any association but you see this here this here's the token this here's the Holy Ghost and I'm going to take it and do what the prophet of God said I'm going to hold that over top of my prayer and I'm going to say hey God you know what you said that I've got a promise if I can hold that token over my prayer that you'll come and honor my prayer nor to even be my prayer that will come forward it will be you praying through me uttering groanings that I can't even comprehend and so I want to invite you to come on the scene when we do that brothers and sisters that's when the devils are going to step back and say uh oh we don't want nothing to do with this one this one's a problem we need to actually just move around him and go after the other people but each one of us play a part in this picture don't be afraid brothers and sisters to play your part don't be afraid to find out what your job description is what is your role everyone has a role we've been talking about it and talking about it and now I want to talk about how we get into our role with Christ how we get into that position in Christ because that's going to take us to that place beyond the curtain of time that's our goal that's the end game brothers and sisters is to get beyond the curtain of time to know that's where we're going to go but to not be afraid Don't Be Afraid what do we have to fear what what what what really do we have to fear but fear itself sure we've got bills and and maybe we've got taxes and maybe we've got different things going on in this world but brother Branham says oh those things don't matter none of those things matter just get perfect love and you know what I want to say brothers and sisters if we have all those other things happening the guns are trained upon us and the plane is rocking and and you've got all these problems in your life just try getting perfect love when you get perfect love even though you still have all those problems something's going to change on the inside of you in that nervous condition that you're contending with because of all of that is going to start to settle down and then you're going to have Clarity of mind and then you'll be able to feed upon the word then you'll be able to press play then you'll be able to go to church then you'll be a part of the body then everything will start to come in line and then you'll watch God come on the scene and change the circumstances it's faith and love that's going to do it as we read in that quote you know just thinking about faith a little bit this morning out of First Peter 1 verse 6 he says Where and ye greatly Rejoice so now for a season if need be sometimes it needs to be some sometimes we have to be if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith it's not the trial of your health it's not the trial of your mind it's not the trial of your family it's the trial of your faith the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth this world though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen ye love in whom though now ye see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory and I just think this is so important for us to recognize verse 9 here we talk about it we refer to it all the time but I want to read it in the scripture verse 9 says receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls it's not you having the ability to work up a certain amount of Faith to get God to move on the situation it's having perfect love perfect love is going to lead you into this position where it's no longer even your faith your faith is going to take a step back and say whoa I don't even know what this is this is totally different and outside of what I even comprehend in First Peter 1 10 of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto who unto you that Grace the the the grace of the Salvation the the the faith the salvation of our souls that's the Salvation we're talking about and where did it come from that word came from the prophets to the people oh my in love first John 4 there's so much in the Bible for both of these um faith and love and there's no way that we could ever get all of it in one service but I just wanted to try and maybe skip across the pond today just like a rock and see how many of these points we could hit on love first John 4 verse 17 here in is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment you know what we don't have to wait till that day of judgment because we accept it right now we judge ourselves according to the word today right and that judgment that we judge ourselves by it's not our word and it's not our Creed or our Dogma it's the word of God that was once delivered to the Saints through the prophets and that is according to the word of God herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world it's such a profound verse but the Ken used to reference it a lot excuse me before he was promoted because he didn't die because as he is so are we in this world and what what I want to get to with that brothers and sisters what we started out with is be therefore perfect in this world as your father in Heaven is perfect and and that's what we're talking about here as he is in this world he's perfect in this world Jesus instructions God standing in flesh instructing mankind so man could comprehend God he spoke those words be ye therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect and you know what when we are perfect when we show that perfect love in our lives that perfect ability to receive the word for our day as he is so are we in this world we're here but you know what verse 18 I think demonstrates the life this is where it's the Rubber meeting the road we can talk about the the high level things as we have be therefore perfect even as your father and it can almost sound like a Pollyanna gospel like we're saying something that everyone should get everyone's perfect not everyone is able to receive this word and we know that very clear but verse 8 18 is where the rubber actually connects the road and starts to squeal it says there is therefore there is no fear in love so if we're afraid brothers and sisters if we've got fear about something brothers and sisters we need to get that perfect love in our lives because we're afraid Satan is the one that's giving us fear he's the one that's causing us to be afraid afraid of what I mean maybe it's afraid of a church maybe it's afraid of a pastoral leadership maybe it's afraid of a relationship maybe it's afraid of going to make something right that was wrong maybe it's whatever it is if we've got fear in our lives that's not the spirit of Christ there is no fear in love but perfect love the love we're talking about that's going to be over there on beyond the curtain of time perfect love casteth out fear because fear has torment there's no torment there why should there be torment here fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love what have we got to fear you know maybe I'm crazy I know I am I'll give my testimony one day my life is upside down totally from the way it was actually it's right side up it was upside down forgive me it truly was totally upside down but now it's right side up you know brothers and sisters whether we live or we die we're Christ if we can get the Holy Ghost in our life it doesn't matter what we feel it doesn't matter whether I Stumble and fall today doesn't matter whether I Stumble and fall tomorrow I'm going to we all are because we're caught in this condition but we've got something on the inside of the inside that's going to cause us to get back up again we're not going to stay down because we know where we're going and you know as dark and as dismal as it gets sometimes we can be so burdened by the cares of this life by the troubles that we contend with whether it's physical or mental or both sometimes it's both whatever it is brothers and sisters don't be afraid it's just a trial of your faith and you know what he'll never touch your faith you can come to the place where you can't even move nothing but your eyes you might not even recognize who you are but brother Branham says it I don't have the quote in front of you but he says it you can lose your mind completely but still be safe still have the baptism of the Holy Ghost Satan can have this flesh Canty job was told or Satan was told with job you can do whatever you want to him but don't take his life isn't it interesting that he didn't take his mind he just Afflicted his body he'd killed all the people around him took his family took all of his his business took all of his finances took him and flipped him inside out basically just about literally right where he was sitting on that on that sacrifice the only thing he could do was sit on the ash Heap and say Lord I don't know what to do I I feel like I wish I wasn't even born but I know you're God it doesn't matter what anybody tells me my wife says that I should just go ahead and curse you and die and I say that she's not a foolish woman I say she speaks like a foolish woman but something on the inside of the inside showed him it was just a trial of his faith and you know what God knew it from the beginning God knew it God said have you considered my servant I had this conversation with Rory and I said to him have you considered my servant Rory and he'd never heard that before and he marveled at that thought to think wow maybe that's what's going on here and I said hey he hasn't changed you yet in fact when he started to slam you to the ground what happened you started to serve God I asked him how did you hear about the gospel and he said I had this Bible I just had this Bible I don't know where I got it from I just had this Bible and once upon a time he got into a uh he got hit by a car he got hit by a car and flipped up in the air and just a terrible thing terrible situation on the cloud trail and he almost died because of it but afterwards when he was recuperating from it he was stuck in his room in a basement Suite that he was living in he said something spoke to him and said go pick up that bible and he said I don't even know where it came from why do I have a bible let alone something's speaking to me go pick up a Bible so he said he went and picked it up and and that's where it all started for him but isn't that wonderful brothers and sisters you see someone that's just totally stomped on by this world by Satan and the more that it happens the the more tremendous their love is for the Lord God knows exactly what we need he'll let us go through exactly what we need to to get into our position my goodness you know um I feel like I'm just gonna have to fly I'm getting into my notes now we're getting into them um are we okay for a few more minutes if we go a little bit over 12 o'clock I don't want to keep us too long I know it's Mother's Day and we have things to get to but I don't know we'll see how it goes Adam he knew his position didn't he and out of Genesis chapter 1 verses 26 to 31 maybe let's just turn there still have a few minutes let's just go there quick I just love it the way the Lord expresses stuff and uh like I said many times I wonder why why that way once we have service then I can understand it Genesis chapter one right at the beginning verse 26 and God said let us make man in our own image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the Sea and the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth Adam knew his position Adam knew exactly where he was and isn't it interesting if we were to just go back and and look at this this scripture that we were just reading uh Kieran is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world as he was so was Adam in this world Adam was created in his own image and he was given dominion over the entire Earth and he knew exactly what his position was and I just think it's such a beautiful thing brothers and sisters when we can recognize our position and we know that in this in this scripture here God he looked at it and recognized that this was the sixth day that that man was created and he said you know it is good it's a very good he looked at his creation he looked at all that he made and there was no mistakes he had no errors to correct because that's the way God does stuff isn't it he knew that it was good and he said it it was very good and he was given man was given Dominion To Tread down and I looked up this you know uh this word dominion what does it mean Dominion according to the word of God and out of strongs it means to tread down that is to subjugate specifically to crumble off to make to have dominion Prevail against rain bear make rule over to rain and that word subjugate is to bring under Dominion or control especially by Conquest Adam man was given the Earth we know that brother Branham said that Adam was God on Earth God was God in heaven Adam was God on Earth Adam had the creative ability to Simply say oh my that Sun's a little bit too hot so let's just get that tree over there to move over here and just block that sun for a little while and then maybe we'll get that tree to move over here and block that sun when the sun gets over there and maybe it's just a little bit too hot and moist in the air you know what we just need a little bit of a West Wind to just a little breeze not too much just to come through and just maybe cool it off just right and he had that creative ability he was able to do that that was the power the position that he had and and you know how did Adam know about his position was because God told him so and I want to talk about that today brothers and sisters you know that for sure you know where I'm going with it God Has Told You So about your position where is your position our position isn't in this building and our position isn't in our career don't worry about the building don't worry about your career all those things have to be there but where's your position in Christ in the day-to-day matters in the situations that arise in our lives where are you are you in your position according to the word of God when your boss tells you the wrong thing when when your neighbor throws something over your fence that you don't like or parks in your parking spot out front or you you encounter different things in your lives that just make you upset where is your position in those moments brothers and sisters because that's what counts that's where the rubber meets the road in our lives because as he was in this world so are we as he is in this world so are we we are one with him just like Adam was with his wife there because you know it just just as well as I do we we all know it it's preaching to the choir I get it but we know that all that Adam lost we just read it that's what Adam had all that he lost has been restored unto man again is what brother Branham said and you know it's that perfect condition it's that perfect love in that perfect place and you know in this message uh brother Brown I'm talking about this beyond the curtain of time paragraph 48 he says now friends I wasn't asleep and and I here we have a prophet of God who had encountered so many different things in his life right so many different Visions so many different different experiences Supernatural experiences but he's clarifying this for a reason for a purpose I believe he says now friends I wasn't asleep and I I just between you and I and the church here I wasn't in a vision I know what a vision is some here just last week some was many 30 as many as 30 times a night it would happen you can imagine the weight that's on you it makes you nervous of course he he understood where where he was he understood what was happening in in terms of it not being a vision and that he hadn't fallen asleep and that it wasn't just a discernment it wasn't just one of the supernatural experiences that he's ever had this was a really really really special experience that he had and you know I just can't help but think maybe it is a little bit crazy when you go down this road if there's maybe somebody that doesn't know about God setting a prophet the 20th century Prophet William Mary and Bradham maybe somebody's watching it on YouTube or they watch it later on if you want to see whether this lines up with a scripture just turn with me over to Second Corinthians chapter 12. and we can do that we'll just take a moment I want to make sure that we do what brother Toby did and we we identify a scriptural identity to this this is not outside of the word in fact this is exactly according to the word Paul the one who is going to have to be judged as well the first church age messenger the the messenger to the Ephesian Church the one that set the pattern the one that laid the foundation for the church to be built on we still preach what Paul preached and anybody that preaches differently than what Paul preached I want to say that's heresy that's getting outside of the word of God second Corinthians chapter 12 verse 1 Paul speaking he says it's not expedient for me doubtless to Glory I will come to visions and Revelations of the Lord we'll get into the deep things he says I knew a man in Christ above 14 years ago whether in the body I cannot tell whether out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth such and one caught up to the third heaven and I knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth how that he was caught up into Paradise and heard unspeakable Words which is not lawful for man to utter this is exactly according to the scripture brothers and sisters but only Paul was shown the vision Paul was shown the experience Paul was shown the the discernment Paul was shown the dream whatever we want to call it I'm not going to get into that what I want to say is that Paul was not allowed to talk about it boy but we've had a prophet in our day that was allowed to talk about it Daniel was forbidden to understand it Daniel desired to understand it remember Daniel was one who was a prophet and he desired to know these things he was a good man wasn't he a good man he prayed and 21 days later the prophet the angel came to him and said you know what we were just busy fighting the the Prince of Persia and we we heard your prayer God heard your prayer the moment you said it Daniel oh beloved but you know we were just busy fighting our way through to get to you Daniel was one that God loved in Daniel 9 verse 2 in the first year of his Reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years wherefore the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in desolations of Jerusalem and what does he say he says I set my face unto the Lord God to seek by prayer and supplications with fasting and sackcloth and Ashes and I prayed unto the Lord my God and made my confession and said oh Lord the great and Dreadful God keeping the Covenant and mercy to them that love him and to them that keep his Commandments we have sinned and committed iniquity and have done wickedly and have rebelled even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments neither have we hearken unto thy servants the prophets which spake in thy name to Kings and princes and our fathers and to all the people of the land oh Lord righteousness belongeth unto thee but unto us confusion of faces as at this day to the men of Judah to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and unto all Israel that are near and afar off throughout all the countries whether thou has driven them because their trespass that they have trespassed against thee O Lord to us belongeth confusion of faith to our face to our Kings to our princes and to our fathers because we have sinned against thee to the Lord Our God belong mercies and forgiveness though we have rebelled against him neither have we obeyed the voice of the Lord Our God to walk in his laws which he set before us by his servants the prophets here we have Daniel this righteous man pouring his heart out to God he was righteous but what was he doing brothers and sisters was he scorning his brothers and sisters saying oh they don't believe the word that I believe they they don't worship the way that I worship they just don't do things the way that we do things so we just can't fellowship with them here we have the prophet of God making intercession for his brothers and sisters knowing that they had willfully betrayed God willfully walked away from the Commandments of God what a tremendous thing it is I just think that says that example right there of what perfect love is having the ability to intercede for our brother and our sister and not just say look at them Daniel chapter 12. this man he says and I heard but then I understood not and we know this is the the story of Daniel where he's with the angel the the one whose countenance was just like lightning his face Shone like the sun he couldn't even stand in his presence he had to fall flat on his face as dead and that angel of the Lord he put his hand upon him and said Daniel oh Daniel though thou beloved of the Lord just don't fear Daniel come on Daniel just get some strength in you and Daniel could only go to his hands and knees and gasp for air as this Angel stood before him and we know it was a covenant Angel it was the Lord Jesus Christ himself saying you know what Daniel it's just not for you Daniel in 12 8 he says and I heard but then I understood not then I said oh my Lord what shall thee be the end of these things and he said go thy Way Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end and brothers and sisters how did he understand we read it right at the beginning he understood by the reading of the books he had an understanding and we know that he only understood part of it but brothers and sisters how much do you understand today how much do we have the ability to understand today to think that Malachi 3 for I am the Lord I change not therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed brothers and sisters if we think he's got a different program than bringing the word of God by the prophet to the people were mistaken someone somewhere along the way has gotten off the the the the main road they're taking the the back road trying to get in and we know what happens when that happens when someone tries to slip in with their own wedding garment he's gonna go through everyone and greet everyone that's there at the wedding Feast but there's going to be people that aren't wearing the wedding garment he's going to say friend how'd you get in here and you know what's astounding with that is that people are going to be there but he's going to go through and he's going to count them and he's going to see who has his wedding garment and who doesn't have his wedding garment and that's why I say brothers and sisters the only wedding garment that we can have is the Holy Ghost in our lives and if we try and get into that wedding Feast any other way than the way that he provides according to the word for our day through a prophet just like he did through all those other men we're not going to get there Hosea another prophet talking about what what what God Said to the people through Hosea come and let us see return unto the Lord if you want to read this at home just for time's sake it's Jose Jose 6 come let us see return unto the Lord for he hath torn he will heal us he has smitten he will bind us up after two days he will revive us the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight then we shall know if we follow on to know the Lord his going forth is prepared as the morning he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter and former rain unto the Earth we read this earlier in our scripture here that he pours his his Reign out on the just and the unjust brothers and sisters he says oh Ephraim what shall I do unto thee o Judah what shall I do unto thee for your goodness is as a morning cloud and as the early do it goeth away therefore have I hewed them by the prophets I have slain them by the words of my mouth and thy judgments are gone as the light that goeth forth I desired mercy and not sacrifice the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings the only way we're going to get the knowledge of God is to have perfect faith in the way we're going to get perfect faith is to have perfect love the only way we're going to get either one of those is to have the Holy Ghost the only way we're going to get the Holy Ghost is to come according to the word for our day the only way we're going to come according to the word for our day is to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of our sins then we shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and to think that we could come according to titles that's not going to happen it's not going to work for us and you know what if we have any doubts in our lives all we need to do is go forwards and just ask the Lord to give us the confidence that we need and it might be like I said to just go on and get baptized again if that's what you need to do then go ahead and do it but it's not going to do you any good to do it over and over and over again just just I guess going forwards with the thought about profits it has to be a prophet the prophet Joel we know that the acts Acts 2 30 they stumbled as drunk people as they came out of the upper room and and what did they say what did Peter say he said this you know what it's not as you suppose we're not stumbling as drunk people this is that which the brother Joel he prophesied years ago this this is what he said would come to pass and it's in Joel 2 28-32 it says and and it shall come to pass afterward that I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaidens in those days I will pour out my spirit and I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth Blood Fire pillars of smoke and the sun shall be turned to Darkness and the moon into blood before the Great and the terrible day of the Lord till to come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be Deliverance as the Lord hath said and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call and whomsoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved you know brothers and sisters we have been given such a tremendous thing Revelations 10 verse 7. in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound he's already sounded he's already sounded brothers and sisters the mystery of God is finished the the thing that Daniel desired to look upon that he he understood by the reading of the books but this one thing at the end of his ministry he just didn't understand it and he desired it and we know that the Lord told him Daniel it's just not for you you've done your prophecy you've done your part Daniel just go your way it's for another group of people down at the end of time they're going to be the ones that receive this word they're going to be the ones that say oh oh my precious brother we're so thankful that you stayed true with the word that you didn't deviate one iota you didn't go one way for money and another way for popularity or get mixed up with women you stayed right down the middle of the road preaching the truth for our day when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God shall be finished as he hath declared to his servants the theologians the clergyman the church as he hath declared to the prophets right as he hath declared To His prophets which means there's coming a Time according to the word of God from the history books that there's coming a time where he's going to bring this word to pass just makes me think of the one going through the the city with the incorn we talked about this out of Ezekiel chapter 9 and the glory of God of Israel was gone up from the Cherub wherever he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the writer's incorn in his side and the Lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem instead of Mark on the foreheads of the man that sigh and cry for the Abominations that be done in the midst thereof remember we brought this quote brother Branham said That's you want an Evidence of the Holy Ghost in your life you want the evidence are you sighing and crying for the Abominations in the land are you sighing and crying for our brothers and our sisters who maybe just don't have the same Revelation are we sighing and crying for this world that we live in sighing and crying that we could see Deliverance for it is that what we're doing I'll call the musicians because I'll probably easily be able to keep going and I know I won't stop if I don't so you know what are you crying and sighing for the Abominations that are in the land and and the others he said in mind hearing remember he called the one who had the ink horn by his side and he said set a mark on all those other ones now the others he called and he said in my hearing go ye after him through the city and smite and let your eye let not your eyes spare neither have ye pity slay utterly old and young both maids and little children and women but come not near any man with whom is my mark and you know we we can look at this brothers and sisters and we know this is a spiritual type it's happened physically and it will happen again not the way it did before but it's going to happen we know that it's going to happen in such a way that it will cause the blood to flow five feet deep as wide as the valley it's going to happen there's going to be sparing Without Pity and we'll say well maybe it's men the world will say well it's men fighting men the word of God says no it ain't it's Angels slaying men but you know it says slay utterly old and young both maids and little children and women but come not near any man upon whom is the mark That's why I want to say brothers and sisters get that Mark get that Mark that Mark is the token that Mark is the holy ghost that Mark is Christ Jesus himself in the day in which we live and then the next word the next sentence of this verse it says and begin at My Sanctuary brothers and sisters we've got to be willing to surrender ourselves to this man with the incored we got to be willing to surrender ourselves to this word for our day otherwise we are going to be slayed it's not an option we cannot prevent it there's no way that we're going to be able to make a way for ourselves to get past it you know we know another one Saint John was told to seal it up he was told go ahead and write John the things which you hear and then he was told seal up those things which the seventh unders uttered and write them not can you imagine that here we have the prophet of God he was there for all of it but he was also instructed don't do it because there's a group of people there's people that are given to know this mystery maybe stand with me this morning as we close John was given that [Music] hi yeah I apologize I just got so excited about this thinking that you know we have the ability to receive the word for our day if we do have the ability to receive the word for our day then we've got every single reason shout every single reason to get excited and to thank the lord we we are truly blessed people not because of anything we've done and I would say that anybody that can receive the word for this day is truly blessed people it's not just Calgary Living Word if you can say Amen to the word for your day you are truly blessed let's just bow in prayer Heavenly Father Lord this morning we thank you for your goodness to us Lord we thank you for your Tender Mercies Lord for your long-suffering Lord Jesus to know that you have given us the ability Lord in the day in which we live to receive the word that you have sent to this age we know that every single age was sent a messenger Lord you you sent a word to to all of the different ages father and there was always a group of people willing to receive that word and and that word through every single age was always partial but father at the End of Time Lord you you made the word entire it wasn't partial and you created a people to be willing to receive that word and father we thank you for that ability because if we have that ability it's only because you chose us to be able to receive it father Lord I just want to ask that we could just examine Our Lives Lord Jesus as we go forwards and father that we can maybe just think about not what's in it for me but what's in it for the other person father let us turn the tables in this world and think about how we can live our lives for other people Lord and to not have fear in our lives to think that somehow some way we're just going to get taken out of here Lord we know that you're not just painting a picture that you're going to tear up and throw on the garbage father we know that you're not just creating a song that you're just gonna sing sometime and then just throw it away father you didn't create a people to be on the earth to receive your word to just do away with them because they've made a mistake in this flesh father we thank you that you have given us Lord the seal in our lives father till the day of our Redemption help us Lord not to grieve you help us to have the words that we should have father that we can speak good words that we could recognize the power of our voices Lord Jesus father whether we're in a group of people or whether we're in a car where nobody else is at nobody can hear us Lord you can hear us we know that you can and father we just pray that you would give us the ability to just temper our words Lord let our thoughts that are expressed father be according to your word let them be your words father your thoughts being expressed through US Lord Jesus as we go forwards father we pray that you would just bless the mothers Lord bless each one father oh Lord we thank you for the mothers thank you for their sacrifice Lord Jesus and in in in submitting themselves and having children Lord Jesus being able to raise them and to train them up in the way they should go father Lord we love you and we thank you we just ask that you would go with us now as we go our separate ways father
