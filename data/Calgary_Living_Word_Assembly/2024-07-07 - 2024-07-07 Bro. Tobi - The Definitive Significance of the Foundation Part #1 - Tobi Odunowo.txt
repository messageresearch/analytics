touch when call his name let's give the Lord a hand of Praise this [Music] [Applause] morning so and honor and privilege to be in his house this morning I've never seen this church this full before so permit me to be intimidated already but we know that we haven't come to see man we've come to the presence of God to be blessed we have come to receive from him he told Moses he said Gather the people together he said I the Lord will give them water you know brother Dom was praying and the things that the Lord was speaking to my heart this morning came out in that prayer you know the first one was the fact that we cannot be here if we didn't have a desire to come sir as we leaving the house this morning that was one of the things I said in my prayer and then he talked about the foolishness of preaching and the Lord took me to that scripture this morning and I was thinking about it I think perhaps yesterday but I read it this morning and how that I was wondering what Paul meant when he said that through the foolishness of preaching God will bring his word to those that believe and I realize that it's all about the fact that God decides to use a badger skin to speak to hide behind that Badger skin to speak to his people God decided to take a badger which we know like is it's not a pleasant animal he could have decided to use the the the skin of sheep but God decided to use a Bader skin and speak through a Bader skin so God decides to use men men that are only Sinners saved by grace like myself to speak the word but Paul said for those that believe and I believe that we here this morning with faith in the word of God trusting that the Lord will speak to us I know we have a lot of visitors I can't start to mention names so I don't miss anyone but I just want to say sister Lori that was wonderful and if you don't know the person that played the piano was the one that wrote the song but uh she brought that song Alive in a way that uh we've never heard it before thank you musicians Lord bless you let's just bow to pray before we read the [Music] word Lord the hour has come the word Lord Jesus is a discerner of au thought and the intent of the heart if you will take me out of the way and just speak your word without a doubt the needs of your people will be met so that's what I'm asking for this morning that through the foolishness of preaching you will reveal yourself to your children amen father speak to us this morning that which you have placed in my heart I want to yield to you father am just Lord let it be that you will speak to the needs of your people yes Lord I know I'm repeating that Lord but I don't know how this will meet the need of everyone in here but you know how it will Lord Jesus and I ask that you do that father that at the end of this service Lord Jesus be able to give you thanks we want to remember our pastor once again just asking that you'll be with him and the wife Lord Jesus in their trip we trust that you've used him Lord to be a blessing there Lord Jesus I ask that specifically Lord and I know that you have done it Lord we are waiting for testimonies there father of what you did in in Ohio Lord Jesus this morning and we know you will do the same for us here Lord that at the end we might come back and say thank you Father for all that you've done for in Jesus Christ Christ's name we pray amen amen just before you take your seat let's just uh we're going to read three portions of the scripture thank you once again musicians try to make sure that I don't forget the musicians it's being a musician it's it's not a good thing if I forget so I have to always remember Hallelujah let's turn first to Matthew Chapter 7 we'll take from verse 24 to 29 if you can please give me some volume on the monitor that will be helpful just want to be sure I'm not yelling almost lost my voice but uh the Lord was gracious I still have something to speak with this morning Matthew 7 24 to 29 very familiar story or actually just an illust ation that Jesus gave here as he was uh preaching his first sermon therefore whosoever heareth the says of mine and dth them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock notice that Jesus was talking about those that hear the says that he was sharing with them and not just hear it but does it those that do those sayings it was likening them unto a man that will build his house upon a rock 26 says and everyone that heareth the sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the S and the reain the said edad and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell it didn't just fall he said and great was the fall of it and it came to pass when Jesus had ended the sayings the people were astonished at his Doctrine for he taught them as one having Authority and not as the scribes let's go to Psalms 11 I'll just take a verse there 11 verse3 says if the foundations be destroyed what can the righteous do and then lastly First Corinthians 2 I know you're still flipping the pages I'm sorry just don't want to waste any time at all um you can also read it right behind me on the screen 1 Corinthians 2:6 28 this was Apostle Paul speaking here to the Corinthians said how be it will speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princeses of this world that come to not now he's talking about two types of wisdom vers 7 he explains more but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery the wisdom of God is always a mystery until it is revealed to you and God makes sure makes sure that that Revelation is personal am even the hidden wisdom it's a mystery it's hidden which God ordained before the world unto our Glory it's hidden it's a mystery but then God ordained it for our Glory meaning that it is meant for us and that's why he's got to reveal it to us which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they will not have crucified the Lord Of Glory and the Lord had bless you to the read of his word may you have your seats this morning I want to take a title the definitive significance of the foundation the definitive significance of the foundation amen the word definitive will mean not able to be changed or improved proved you know you could talk about a definitive judgment or ruling you could talk about the fact that there are no definitive answers or solution to a problem you could also talk about the fact that for instance the police have no definitive proof of our guilt and another meaning of it is when you consider something to be the best of its type so we're talking about the foundation and the reason I use that word definitive is the fact that when you look at a house and I'm not a builder so will Paul correct me if I if I'm wrong or the other people that work in that industry here but I know as much as the fact that of all the things that you could do in a building the most important part is the foundation that's right if the foundation is wrong every other thing about that building will be wrong as a matter of fact there are times when a building has been completed and it looks really nice in this part of the world I don't think that can happen in Africa where we build with bricks and with blocks but in this part of the world when the foundation has a problem they've got to lift the entire house and fix the foundation but that is always expensive now another thing I want you to note is that in this analogy that Jesus gave it is possible that the material that was used in those two instances were the same that's right the material could have been the same but the problem was with the foundation someone decided to have the right foundation and someone else decided to have the wrong Foundation now both of them experien the storms yes you don't know where I'm going this morning but we'll get there soon both of them experienced the storms amen and regardless of the similarity in the material that was used to build the houses the foundation determined which house will stand that's right amen they might have used the best of material they might have sourced the best of wood that they could use to build a house but when there was a problem them without Foundation when the storms came the house could not stand that's right and Jesus will tell us that not only did it fall great was the fall of it now this morning I want to take a subtitle the foundation of marriage so we're talking about foundation and that's why I was praying and saying Lord I don't know how this would meet the need of everyone here because I felt this is for the young people but just to be sure that we take care of everybody including the children who might not have a lot of this things applicable how many of you children remember the song that goes with the story that Jesus told can we all be kids for a while can we sing it yeah what song is that you can't remember okay Daniel can remember what song is it yeah okay so let's go the wise man built his house upon the rock the wise man built his house upon the rock the wise men build his house upon the rock and the rain came falling down the rain came down fls okay the rains came down and the floods up the rains came down and what [Music] happened okay and the foolish man the foolish man built his house upon the sand bu the foolish man built his house upon the sand and the rain came so the Rings came down and the floods the rain came down and the the RS came down and [Music] the wind Splash thank you let's give everyone a hand so if you can remember that song that you can remember my message this morning okay now why do we talk about marriage why we talk about marriage as a found and talk about the foundation of marriage but Braham says in the message the marriage of the Lamb he said now marriage in one sense is a type the Earthly marriage here is a type of the Heavenly marriage now if you think about that deeply you'll understand that God did not just Institute marriage for fun God instituted marriage as Paul will tell us he instituted marriage because he wanted to show a type of Christ and the church now when you talk about something being a type then there must be an original that's right so the type supposed to follow the way the original is meaning that if I am a married person I'm I'm supposed to be looking at the original which is Christ and the church and if I get it wrong in any way then what I'm trying to say is that the original is not right because I'm supposed to be a reflection of the original and many times you know we could talk about people who are married and um how many people are married here how many people have had storms in their marriage storms are meant to happen sometimes it's terms of disagreement I see it this way you see it that way you know one of the things I heard before I got married is there have been marriages that crashed just because someone always forgets to put down the toilet seat and from something as little as you did not put down the toilet seat marriages can crash but if the marriage is built on the right foundation those storms will come storms of disappointment when your spouse will do something that pains you because you don't expect them to do it when those Storms Come As Long as That marriage is founded on the Rock who is The Rock On Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground is sinking sand you know the other part that we read in First Corinthians brother Paul was talking about two types of wisdom brother Paul talked about the wisdom of this world and then he talks about the wisdom of God for everything in this life there are two kinds of wisdom or two kinds of advises or two kinds of ways in which you could approach it and when it comes to marriage this world has its own explanation of how marriage should be approached but I want to tell you this morning that any idea any advice any wisdom that is different from the wisdom and the word of God it is sinking s so for our young people that are not yet married or that are thinking of you know getting into marriage at some point I want to by the grace of God show you from the word of God what kind of foundation God wants you to have as you approach marriage you know we live in a country where the rate of divorce is Skyrocket it's even gotten to a point where I mean maybe some young people ask themselves should I even get married and let me just share some statistics from uh what we currently have in Canada just some statistics with you it says that 40 to 50% of the first marriage is estimated to end up in divorce so when someone like me that comes from Africa reads something like first marriage it it's actually a bit weird I was having a conversation with one of my colleagues and she was like oh my kids are preparing for their father's wedding I'm like that doesn't make sense your kids cannot be preparing for their father's wedding because you should be married to their father already but what she was trying to tell me is that of course she was married before she was divorced and then she married someone else and uh ex-husband has been going with someone for a while and now it's time for them to get married and the kids are preparing for that wedding their father getting married to someone else and here we are been told that 40 to 50% of the first marriage is estimated to end up in divorce 60% of second marriages are most likely to get divorced that's people that now go and marry someone else after their first marriage and 73% of the third marriage end up getting separated those that say you know what I didn't get it right the first time try the second time didn't get it right want to try it again 73% of them get separated and it says the couples aging 50 and more have a divorce rate of 26% that is after they have been married for a long time there's still chances that after 50 divorce can still happen you know another thing that we hear a lot around this part of the world and it's actually getting to all the parts of the world is what they call common law and common law is a man and woman feeling like you know we don't want any strings attached let's just be together enjoy the benefits of marriage decide if we want to have kids together but we are not going to do anything that's called marriage that was not how God intended it now some of those people they're doing that because they have seen other bad examples of marriage I was in the barber shop a while ago and there was this man that was I think he from Z brother tabis that was being he was getting his haircut T night and he was having conversations with this Barbers they mostly from Ghana and I just knew that they were talking about marriage and a divorce case because this guy was talking about the fact that oh I brought her to this country after I've spent 20s something years you know making all the money and the only thing she has to her name I co signed and that's a car um she has nothing and now she's taking you know most of what I have because it's now a divorce case so you hear a lot of people see those examples young people and they are scared of coming close to marriage because of the Shipwreck that he can see all over now why am I talking about this cuz we're Believers right we we are believers we believe the message we are Christians right we shouldn't we shouldn't think about the things that's happening in the world that's what you think but Jesus Christ in his prayer he said Lord I'm not asking you to take them out of the world but I'm asking you to keep them from the wrong influence in the world we are in the world but not of the world there was a man that was he didn't realized that it was getting closer to the world and his name was lot lot and I and and and Abraham Lord being Abraham's uh nephew as as you know the story were far away from Sodom and gomorra but when their hurs men started to fight and Abraham said you know what Lord you just you just you know let let's not fight let's let let's let's just separate for now you know we're still brothers and then you choose where you want to go Lord decided to pitch his tent the Bible said towards Sodom that's right he didn't go into Sodom he just went close to Sodom but when the destruction of Sodom happened where was Lot in Sodom it was gradual and if we don't talk about those things we will not realize where it will become normal for us to do the things that the people in the world do there are very very sad stories I've heard within the the uh the the Circles of the message we've heard of people that got married went on honeymoon and that was the end of the marriage we've heard of people that were courting and they had differences they had fights and they kept pushing on and saying that well we can make it through and and they get to the point where they're married and few months after the marriage collapses all of those is because it was built on sinking sand now brother BR says this here and and you know one single mistake as I said before the wisdom of this world does not consider the things that God says but remember this morning we want to bring certain instructions and principles that God has given us concerning marriage especially to our young people so that they don't make the mistakes some mistakes cannot be corrected am true some mistakes when it happens when it comes to the matter of marriage that person's life becomes not what he supposed to be anymore let me read what thing brother brah said in questions answers 1964 brother Braham was ask the question brother Braham what is the meaning of an analment it's talking about analment when it comes to marriage are people free to marry or is it just another word for divorce I would like some information on this but the brah said sure they're married as long as they take that vow they are married just like a boy if he promises a girl to marry her under good faith meaning that he's making the sinc year promised to marry someone brother Abraham said he is obligated to that girl he is just as good as married the only thing the Lord does is give a Bill of Rights to live together to keep from being common law husband and wife what brother BR is saying is when they now come to church you know that when you come to church depends on which church some Churches have the right to actually give you like a marriage certific ific at if you don't get that from a church you have to go to um I think a magistrate or something and then get that certificates but brother Braham is saying that that is not when the marriage happens and it's going to prove to us by the word the marriage happens when you go I know these days if you go on one knee will you marry me but that's the moment before God that God sees you as married so before you ever get to that point as we hear Brother Braham say you've got to be double sure that that's the person you want to spend the rest of your life with the ram said the only thing the Lord does is give you a Bill of Rights to live together from being common La husband and wife but when a man tells a woman I will marry you honey I'll take you for my wife will you take he said he's married your vow is sacred that's what marries you anyhow I think we're reading it right there's not no preacher can marry you no magistrate or nothing else it's your own vow to God and to this man when you promise you are married said you see brother brah said said you said only answer that that by the Bible to you want the Bible on it raise your hand if you want it how many wants the Bible reference on that yeah now we got to about 6 or 8 minutes all right Joseph A husband being a just man a espoused husband remember that Joseph and Mary Mary the mother of Jesus they were not married at the time that the Holy Ghost overshadowed Mary remember and then when the Holy Ghost overshadowed Mary she Bram said she was just a young girl I can't remember how Bram said she was probably teenager at that time and when Joseph discovered that Mary was pregnant the Bible said he was going to put her away privately it was going to why why was it going to do that because according to the law she was meant to be stoned that means she has lived a FIY life she's been a fornicator and according to the lord they're supposed to take her and stone her but he knew that she was the good girl he couldn't explain what had happened went out to tell us that Joseph had been married before so he was way older than Mary but it was taking her now they were engaged not yet married but let's let's see what bar says here Joseph her husband being the just man was mindly to put her away privately on this wife because before they came together she was found with a child of the Holy Ghost and the angel of the Lord appeared to him on a dream and [Music] saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy girlfriend marry thy what wife already married he had already promised her so it's not something to joke with oh I'll marry you no it's a serious issue but abam says I'll just go to one 98 don't you make your vow to anybody L you mean to stick with it remember there's a Bible for it Joseph promised to marry Mary and God said that was it he said read the Old Testament laws on that and it's also the same thing he said if you promised to marry a woman and you married another one you was committing adultery and he throwed you out of the camp yes you have to keep your vows when you promise a woman that she's a sacred little IAL and that's to bring the child into the world again so when you promise her you must marry her remember he said the promise must be in good faith yes if someone comes around you jokingly tells you I want to marry you has someone else it's not in good faith that person lies to you that is not binding that's right but when you mean it from your heart and you promise yourselves then it is binding now anytime we want to learn about something that God has placed in the Bible or given to us we can always go back to the first time God did it to understand the why so we're going to take a look at I'm just going to make this easy for us to understand because a lot of young people are students so if I give you like four points you can always remember those four points but I'm going to bring four points that I will call four different levels of maturity that is required before marriage for a good foundation of marriage four levels of maturity amen now let's remember that when God the first time God instituted marriage it was with our first parents it was Adam and Eve right but I've often wondered why God did not create Adam as a baby procreation was going to start very quickly because as God was making all other things God was giv that law of reproduction let every seed bring forth according to His Kind so God created Adam and made Adam a mature man and what I'm getting to as we're going to get a little bit into it is all of us will agree that people that think about marriage are people that are physically mature so we're going to look at physical maturity as the first maturity level that I want to talk about this morning but it was not just about Adam being a mature man or being created a mature man God made sure that Adam had a home amen let's let's recap the story God created a spirit man gave him Dominion Genesis chapter 2 God took the dust of the Earth formed flesh put that spirit in in in that in that man and then made him a living soul and then later on God saw that it was not good for man to be alone and then God took a reib I can't remember who I was who I was hearing from that said I I don't know how God would use one reib and create a woman but is the creator that's right right so God took a re from this man made a woman but before that happened there was a garden that God had made the man to be overseer of he had a responsibility he has a home let's put it this way Adam had a home and a job yes sir so you see some young men now ready to Mar what's your plan well we'll just Pi against me no you've got to have a job and then Adam was also a Son of God in terms of spiritual maturity as a matter of fact the serpent could not have deceived Adam it couldn't have that's why Satan was very subtle Satan found the time that Eve had strayed away and went in that animal and had a conversation that's right so when you are talking about a man that is ready I'm going to talk about men first because there's a huge responsibility that God has given us as men when it comes to building the family so God ensured that he was a mature man God ensured he had had a home God ensured he had a job he could have a sense of responsibility it was not meant to be calling Daddy you can't call Daddy when you have moved into your own house and say Daddy help me take every decision it shows that you've never learned how to be responsible before you got to that place amen so God I don't have the time to read all the scriptures but God the purpose of marriage we all agree procreation it was also for companionship and then it was also for Redemption God intended marriage for Redemption so many people agree that physical maturity is required for marriage but they stopped there that is why the concept of dating was introduced but when you look in the message of the hour and the advice that was given by the message of the hour you will not find dating there what you will find is courtship might ask me brother Toby what's the difference the intention of dating has nothing to do with marriage when someone comes and says I love you I want you to be my girlfriend most of the time it has no goal that is related to marriage if it has a goal related to marriage it is quing we're going to explain it it is let me just you know pause here and say it is natural for you as a young person when you get to a certain age that you you desire the the companionship of the opposite sex it's normal there's nothing wrong with it it's just the same way that Paul told us that God gave us a member in our bodies he called it a little member called the tongue and he said that member as little as it is it can put a house on fire but what do you have to do you have to put it under control so when you get to that age and your body tells you I'm ready you've got to tell your body that is more than just being physically mature when it comes to marriage that's right now I was talking about dating let's take a little bit uh let's take go down the history and find out you know what didn't is how did it because it wasn't always there right and I'll tell you why it is wrong and what is right and what the right way is so this is just some historical writings said the rituals of courtship have evolved over time and what is considered romantic today would have been scandalous if not criminal less than 100 years ago as revealed in morai wiggle a remarkable history of the subject here are 10 things you might not know about dating and courtship over the years so number one is it was not originally called dating where did that word dating come from the the word dating in the context of relationships reaches back to 1896 it was first used in the newspaper column in which a young man laments that his girlfriend is seeing other people that they are feeling all my dates as in the dates in Her calendar so he's supposed to be courting this person but she was seeing other men and she had so many men that she was seeing that were filling up our dates in our calendar and that's how the word dating you know originates in the 1990s dating could be a felony I'll tell you why it is different from courtship when a young man approaches a lady and says I want you to be my girlfriend most of the time the parents are not involved most of the time the pastor is not involved when you listen to the ritual of marriage that is read on the wedding day it is said that it should not be entered into unadvisable remember it wasn't man that came up with marriage it was God and if God came up with something God has got principles many of us when we buy appliances we forget to read the manual and that puts us in a lot of trouble one of the things I remind myself is if I'm finding it hard to put together I'm doing something wrong because the manufacturer will have conceded every little bitty part and made it in such a way that if you were just to read the manual you get it done faster how many people buy Ikea products someone said that uh if you want to know how strong the relationship between couples are just try to put them together to to put together some my care products and then you'll see at the time of the last century dating was still a New Concept and law enforcement wasn't sure what to make of it but they were sure something sorted was going on a young man and a woman meeting in public him buying have food drink and Gifts well it was veritable process prostitution in the eyes of the authorities and women could be arrested for it in the 1900s early 1900s D didn't introduce privacy to the process of courtship let me explain it initially courtship was not supposed to be private when courtship is happening they're not going to hide somewhere or be somewhere that someone else is not because they want to make it open to the public that we are not allowing ourselves to get into intimacy that she come after marriage these days is hard because of social media I don't want to get into all those dirty stuff but young people you know you know how you could go for Camp a brother will take your number and you know the kind of conversations that will happen happen Daddy doesn't know Mommy doesn't know Pastor has no idea that is not the foundation that God laid that's not the foundation that the prophet laid said ironically a man and a woman meeting in public was the best way to have some privacy before dating courtship involved stors calling on prospective Partners In The Family Home and since MC manions were not yet a thing it meant the Parlor or kitchen where there was always eyes and ears closed by so what I meant is a man is interested in a young lady we're going to see brother the braham's example the man goes and ask the parents of the young lady I'm interested in your daughter I would like to know her more when he comes to the house they know him they know he's come for her they are not excusing them they all are in the open area it's getting to know her it's getting to see her he getting to see her behavior he getting to see how she responds when a mother or a father tells her something to do is trying to see how she relates with her siblings she probably also goes to his house to meet with him and his parents and she's watching and saying oh how does he respond to his mother when she talks to him because that's the way it's going to respond to her when they're married a boy that will think I'm now a boy and your mother will talk to you and you will talk back to your mother you will do the same to your wife it's a bad habit that you've got to get rid of right now before you get oh I'm going ahead myself s too much we'll get there all of those things is message I'm not bringing my own ideas I'm just telling you a bit of history and then we are going to see just to give context to what brother Braham said now the last point I want to talk about dating before D didn't came into the picture courtship and calling were conducted with the express goal of marriage it was a family affair as schar men hers property and happiness the newly established dating industry however add other goals in mind marriage will hurt the business of dating for the first time in human history writes wiggle dating made it necessary to buy things in order to get FaceTime with a prospective partner and this remains true today when you're caring someone there no there's no necessity to buy it you know it's not it's not you're not trying to impress that person with material but dating the concept of dating is take me to a restaurant take me out somewhere buy me some nice shoes buy me some nice jewelry that is the concept of dating now let's see what brother Braham said about the process of marriage and let's see what that dating is there the message come down paragraph 35 preach to 1962 butam said we take for instance the marriage for Union we found out that the marriage we find the courtship that's number one and the agreement that is with the same as engagement because that's when you're making the promise and then the marriage which is a ceremony elsewhere it says this courtship there's engagement and then there's a ceremony right that should settle it for all the time now it's the same thing that's the same thing it is with Christ and the church a courtship God calling to our hearts you see why I'm saying that marriage in the natural is a mirror of Christ and the church so if you take it out of place you are not mirroring Christ and the church and that's not what God wants a courtship God is calling to our heart Hearts we surrender the marriage ceremony and the bride takes the bridegroom's name so that is what God expects from us so physical maturity yes but not just that I'll move on to the next one how are we doing with time pretty good emotional maturity emotional maturity we live in a world that emphasizes self love the problem in most marriages is due to selfishness the man wants to put himself before the woman the woman wants to put herself before the man is what brother Bram called elsewhere the I problem always about I me that is the problem when it comes to most marriages but let us go back and listen to what Jesus said Jesus replied you must love the Lord your God with all your heart all your soul and all your mind this is the first and greatest Commandments a second is equally important love your neighbor as yourself the entire law and all the demands of the Prophet are based on these two Commandments they had come to ask Jesus which is the most important commandment in all the Commandments that Moses gave us and Jesus gave gave that description that gave that answer but brah says in God using his gift he said any Christian will think of others before himself every Christian will think of others before himself and in marriage if you can think of your spouse before you think about yourself there will be peace at home I had a colleague you know back in Nigeria who everyone knew and she herself knew that her husband was not faithful to them marriage but there's something she said that I found impressive she said every morning this Unfaithful man goes to his wife and says are you happy just wants to know because he knows that regardless of what he's doing and all he's struggling with if the wife is happy then it's fine it's not a good thing to do the other thing he was doing but it's important to know whether your spouse is happy or not even if it's as your own detriment you've got to make that person happy but what I'm saying is we live in a world today where what is being emphasized is love yourself first self first self love and we are growing kids that way and when it gets to the point where they have to get married or they finally get married you're going to find out that they put themselves first all the time and marriage cannot work like that marriage is all about sacrifice brother brah had an encounter well he had an experience I'll just read the quotes I think this is from the message a paradox CU this is a good example that gave so for instance a few days ago I was called on to scene a little something going on there was a fine young man very fine boy he was going with a little girl very fine little girl out of a fine family and this boy all of a sudden came up with some kind of an idea and he just walked away he did something wrong to that little girl and much as promised that to do a certain thing and didn't do it and instead of coming to the girl and apologizing just saying that felter word sorry is it five letters yes it's fine I still know my spelling just to say sorry that was hard like a gentle man should do he it just wasn't in him to do it it must have been a burd nice looking chest six box but when it comes to the intellect when it comes to what we in HR these days call emotional intelligence is called a zero just to say sorry are there people like that in the churches the message churches there are yes sir because this was the message church that brother was talking about and the father and the mother called me to the scene and said we will desire to know what's wrong with our boy maybe they tried to talk to him she's your wife just tell her you're sorry like nope walked away now it's not easy to do something but you must be truthful and honest therefore the boy was a Christian as far as a believer let's see whatam classifies here and he explains it he had repented and had been baptized and had his position among the Believers but yet had not received the baptism of the Holy Spirit no matter how much he thought he had the holy spirit will make you say sorry that's what AB is trying to say Amen said you think you have it having it is two different things you might be able to try to say you have and you might be able to show some evidence of some emotion but unless your life is vindicating what you are professing to have you still haven't got it no matter how many emotions how many jump run Sensations speaking in tongues or shouting or whatever you might lay it upon which is all right I believe in all that too but unless your life CS with your test then you haven't got it cuz the fruit of the spirit vindicates what you are just like the fruit of any tree tells what it is Jesus said by their fruit you shall know them said now this young fellow parent his mother is German no reflection on the German but there's a Trin in that family they'll just sit and you can talk to them they just stare at you right in the face this girl sister the mother of this boy or sister I have come down the street many more morning and this young lady be sitting out in the yard and I'll say good morning to you she'll just look at me and I'll stop and I'll say sure a fine morning she'll just stand look right at you an intelligent woman and I'll say come up see us sometime she'll just turn and look well our brothers are that way father and mother is that way amen hallelujah now the father of the boy is strictly an Irish Man Moody and High tempered High strong that's his whole family like that except one other out of the family converted this father and mother bought a christans filled with Holy Ghost and they have brought this young man up in the way of the Lord and now this young man is about 17 or 18 years old something along there a very fine kid he's been a real model boy at home nice kid and he's got a brother that's just vice versa but the girls the mother's family lives close to a church but do you think they've ever come over there no they don't go to church and they know it's right but it was not just in them it was just not in them to ask forgiveness or ask pardoning even from God I'm adding that but that's what that's a context they just wouldn't do it it's not just in them now the jeans in the father and the mother of this boy no matter how much they converted Still Remains the flesh that's been interpreted out of this boy therefore the boy has got a complex in him just like from his mother's family that they are not forgiven they will not apologize and that's where the boy stands at this time he wasn't married to that girl they were going together but he lacked emotional intelligence he he I mean I could say it's a spiritual problem but I don't want to put it to spiritual problem because we know that there are people who are not Christians that don't find it hard to say sor sorry there are marriages of non-christians that have worked because they've used the principles of the Bible these are principles these are principles we study them in school we study psychology most of those things if you come back you find out that they took them from the pages of the scripture because the person that designed the human mind is God yes sir let me just go to 30 29 and I said to the boy look at your family practically all of them are drunks I don't want to me any miss anything that's important let's just go back to 27 I'm sorry now I said to the father no matter how much you've raised him up said now look at you out of your family all of them drunks and fighting and shooting and cutting and so forth now look at your family to the mother there are a bunch of people just said there I won't speak very in the dependent and so forth irreverent to religion but I said it's not you you are the only one of all your sisters and brothers and you are sweet kind and forgiven what does that now he's speaking to one of the parents of of the boy said what does that and you are tree part of that family tree yet you have received the Holy Ghost that's the thing that make you tender and sweet it's not your people anymore it's your Christ that lives in you I said to the boy look at your family practically all of them are drunks and so forth I said how moody and high tempered and high strong but you're not you're kind forgiven what's that the Holy Spirit you're no more what you are it's Christ in you I said now that same thing has to happen to your son he got to be delivered from The Strain in the family he got to be delivered from that bad habit of not being able to say sorry brother brah did say here that the parents raised him in the way of the Lord which we should all do and the father raised up and said my son went to the altar he was baptized correctly in the name of Jesus Christ and water baptism in in the pool said I know my son has come to Christ but ra said I said that may be all right all the outward motions it might be identified as a Believer with all the Believers but until he until he is regenerated born again I advise that young man never to never marry a woman it'll make hell on Earth for her until that gentle sweet forgiving Spirit of Christ comes [Music] in many of us will say but ABR said I'll advice I'll keep it at there I won't make it a Doctrine but if you want a sweet marriage receive the Holy Ghost brother Braham said in choosing of a bride he said the Holy Ghost will tell you who to marry is that important and sometimes you tell that to people and like no how why are you making it a Doctrine you know why why must I have to receive the Holy Ghost before I Get Married the question I want to ask you is why is marriage more important than the Holy Ghost right why is it that being converted and being a Christian is not as important as you getting married because the Holy Ghost is freely given that's right amen you don't need to T the only people that were told to T were those that went to the upper room and that taring brother BR said I stopped since they received the Holy Ghost right so if you are sincere in your heart and desperate as much as you want to get married if you are desperate to receive the Holy Ghost the brah said that God is under obligation to give it to you he's under obligation to give it to you so advised don't let this young man marry until he receiv receives the Holy Ghost when he receives the Holy Ghost he will become like his parents kindhearted that strain in the family will be gone it will be delivered from it amen because now there's a another spirit that dwells in it you love the Lord this morning the next one I'll talk about is financial and material maturity and then we'll come to spiritual maturity and this probably doesn't apply as much here as it does where I come from but it's not the intention of God that a man will marry a woman and not be independent what I'm trying to say is when it comes to decision when it comes to how that new unit operates it is supposed to be independent of any other unit you have to get to a level of Independence that neither of the parents are influencing that marriage and some times that requires you having your own space yes sir I know of a couple that had problems in the process of getting married differences fightings and all finally got married you know after being counseled and told you know you have to put all your differences away but the mother of the husband was leaving with them and what caused the problem that led to the separation was that the husband said his wife was disrespecting his mother newly weeded couple if the mother was not there in the first place that wouldn't have been a problem when two adults that have lived their life separately for I don't know 15 20 30 years depending on when you get married come together there has got to be differences you've been raised by two homes different homes you have different characters as a person you've had different experiences in life that has shaped you to become who you are and then you bring this two people together there's going to be a time of friction I don't know when that time ends anyway for those that have been married for close to 50 years is you know I'm not looking at Paul but I heard a story of uh friend told me a story years ago about a couple that you know they were grandparents and they had been married and I think someone went and visited them and and then the next thing they heard the man says I've told you not to be putting this thing here he probably been telling her for 50 years but nothing had changed but those differences will continue to be there right that's so when that unit is just about to start God expects Independence you said give me a scripture for it you want a scripture when it was time for Isaac to get married Abraham called elazar and gave him instruction after he made him to swear when El I'll just give us the story because we all know the story when elazar went and got Rebecca where did he bring Rebecca to he said Rebeca met Isaac on the field and after meeting Isaac on the field where did where did Isaac and Rebecca go they went into the tent of Sarah remember that time Sarah was dead they didn't go into the tent of Abraham and the new wife that he has but went into the tent of Sarah so that they can have their independence get to know themselves better and start to grow a another unit of the society a new family brother Bram gave examples an example of two different couples that he married in the early part of his ministry and this is in the message Ching of a bride because when I say things like this you know it kind of feels like how much should a man have before he he starts to think of getting married and this is actually funny like what brother Braham did here brother Braham said I've married many couples but it always reminds me of Christ and his bride one of the weddings I performed here some time ago it was quite an outstanding thing in my life and it's been several years ago when I was just a young Minister my brother was working on the WPA I don't know whether anybody ever remember that anyone has told as old as me and that was a project that the government had and my brother worked up there about 30 miles and they were digging some out some laks a project for the con conservation and there was a boy worked up there with him from Indianapolis about 100 miles above Jeffersonville uh where I lived and he said to my brother one day he said doc said I want I'm I'm going to get married if I just had enough money to pay the preacher he said I got enough money to get my license but said I haven't got enough money to pay the preacher so at that time you need to actually probably go to a church pay someone who is a preacher recognize a preacher to marry you I'll just save us I'll just talk about the story so we we save some time but what happened was you know brother bram's brother told Brother Bram about it um after speaking to this colleague and saying you know what my brother is a preacher I'm sure sure that he won't ask you for any money and brother Ram said uh to his brother that definitely I'll marry them without charging so brother Brown now starts to describe this couple as they came on their wedding day in paragraph 94 she got out of the car and they came up to the steps and when they walked in the poor little thing just about all she had on was a skirt and she didn't have no shoes hardly on she had a hitchhiked from she had hitchhiked from Indianapolis down had a little hair hanging down back in a long kind of plates down our back looked very young now brother starts to ask questions that you should ask yourself before you ever think of marriage before you think of the ceremony butam said and I said to her are you old enough to get married he said yes sir she said I have my reading permission from my father and mother I believe at that time it was have been a requirement I had to show it to the court here to get my license I said all right I said I'd like to have a talk talk to you a little bit before we perform this wedding the sat down the boy looking around the room he needed a haircuts real bad he was a poor little guy and he kept looking around the room he wasn't listening to me I said son I want you to listen to what I'm saying said yes sir I said you love this girl he said yes sir I do I said you love him was asking the lady so yes sir I do I said now have you got a place to take her after you marry I know some of the young men are too young to start thinking about this but when we were growing up up we heard these things from you know as early as we could understand what he meant and I will say that I will not be here today if I did not remember those things that we were told if I did not remember that your vow marries you I will not be qualified to stand in front of you because I will have married wrong so it's important there's no age where it's too young to know it if you don't need it now keep it in your back pocket if Christ Harries you're going to need it someday have you got a place to take her after you marry said yes sir I said all right I said I want to ask you something I understand you working up here in this pwa he said yes that's about $122 a week week I said you think you can make a living for her he said I'll do all I can do talk about being responsible I don't know if I read that quote butam talked about the fact that one thing he is I think I didn't finish reading it one thing he has learned in his life that's why he was talking about the fact that CHR will always put themselves last put the other person first I'm just going to go back to it and read it because I think it's good for us to be reminded of that butam said in God using his gifts a Christian will think of others before himself every Christian tries to put God first his family second he's number three brother brah said I have tried to make that a practice in my own life God first family circum then comes him I said you think you can make a living for her he said I'll do all I can do paragraph 99 I said well that's all right I said now what if he gets out of now turning to the sister what if he loses this job sister what are you going to do going to run back home to mama papa this was before brother brah was going to marry them she said no sir I am going to stay with him and I said what sir if you have three or four children nothing to feed them and you haven't got any work what are you going to do send her away said no sir I'll struggle right on well will make it somewhere brother brah said I felt little at seen that he really loved her and they loved one another I married them the part I don't have here I can just tell us the story it was about the same time that brother B brother BR married another couple from Rich homes so after a few weeks the said he decided to go take a look you know just visit these two couples and see how they doing and brother BR wasn't going to just go knock at at their door it was going to snitch and just watch and see what they were doing so brother Bram went first to the rich couple so he was peeping through the window trying to hear the conversations they didn't know he was around the corner and he said they were fighting what were they fighting over they had gone to a dance the night before and they were fighting over the fact that the boy danced with one girl and the girl danced with one boy and as soon as brother Braham knocked the door they opened the door they saw brother Braham they came together and held themselves hi honey don't you think it's so nice to have brother Bram in our house like yeah yeah nice to see you guys and then brother Brown went to visit this other couple they were leaving I don't know the word for it I can't remember the word used but they were living in what I'll call just a container like an AB abandoned container so but Abraham was listening to their conversation as well the man was telling the lady I'm sorry I really wanted to buy you this dress but I can't afford it he had just come with his income $12 a week and started to they were dividing so much for food so much for this so much for that so much for groceries and he was like I'm really saving up to really really help get this and she was like no don't worry about it I know you're trying as hard as you can let's just manage what we have brother abrah said if I was going to choose I would choose those poor people that is the real marriage so we need material maturity not in the sense of riches but in the sense of responsibility in the sense of knowing that you are at a place where when you ask the question do you have a place to take heart you can say yes I do it might not be the prevest of places it might not be the most you know convenient places that could take her but I know that we will be together we will work things out we'll make it together the the the the the the you know when you look at the marriages of rich people the most interesting stories are the stories of those that started poor that married their wife when they had nothing and they worked together to grow whatever God gave them the business that God gave them to grow to a stage where it's now become huge because you know that the man the the woman did not marry the man because of the money they actually grew it together spiritual maturity you know I talked about dating and people that studied the message might tell me me oh brother brah also dated someone yes yes I'll read it but brother BR was not a Christian that's right when he went out with a go and as I read the story you also realize what type of girl it was and what type of influence he was trying to bring upon him and then you if you want to against what I'm saying ask yourself is that the type of influence that I need in my life but R said I remember my first dates I had with a little girl this is in life story you know how boys are when you get about 16 17 you got a sweetheart and that first one you know how she looks I was a big old bashful country boy but I remember the first girl that I had oh she had teeth like pearls she had eyes like a dog love neck like a swan oh she was just the prettiest thing I ever seen in my life a lot of the brothers can say yes so she's she had just come back into school so I said to the other boyfriend I said you get your dad's old Ford I got 75 cents and we'll get us two gallons of gasoline for a quarter and so I'll have 50 cents left and we'll go out and have a good time not a Christian at this time so we had to jack off the old Ford up and you know uh did you ever do that to your old Ford when it was about half back SLE anyhow you know and pull it up till we got each started I mean growing up in Africa we back in the day when things were really hard most of the vehicles wouldn't start so we do what we call jump starting and jump starting is not taking another battery to start a car the vehicles that have not the type this type of vehicles you drive today these ones are easy to drive you drive it you know and and uh the first time and before you know you're a driver but those days the vehicles have clutches so you've got to understand how to balance between your clutch and your um the gas pedal right so that was the way we'll start a car that won't start you push sh and then you have to exactly some people know this yeah the older ones not trying to sound old but that's what brother the r was trying to describe here so a car that's backstage said my I think she'll um and they said we um and and pull it up till we got it started and he got his girl I got mine and he way we went my I think she'll go out with me went at night time didn't have to dress too good you know but Bram did not come from a a rich background he came from a very poor background so what he saying here is he'd rather go at night when no one will see what he's wearing because he wasn't wearing anything that looked good at all so they went at night time and um said we wasn't going nowhere anyhow so I sat back at the back of the car thing talking to this little lady Hardway over on one side and Midway over the other side just bashful you know I know my face was bound to be red cuz it was just so bashful so they stopped down at the place they got some sandwich and uh for an eal and let me just go to where they started having a conversation um 41 anyhow she was but BR talked about the fact that before he knew it this My Little Queen was smoking a cigarette anyhow she was smoking this little cigarette I looked at her my she sure passed out of my view I looked at her I could hardly believe it was her that pretty little girl sitting there smoking that cigarette she was blowing it through her nose you know sickening looking any man let his wife smoke cigarettes shows what is made out for made out of that's right so brah talked about the fact that she offered him the cigarette and he said no ma'am things I don't smoke and she said you don't dance cuz she's asked him about dancing before you don't smoke said what do you like to do said well I like to hunt and fish that didn't interest her she said you are a big CeCe said oh my I was going to be big bad Bill we all like that when I got to University I didn't want to associate myself with any Christian group cuz the adamic nature is there you just want to be that boy that all the girls are looking at and then they say oh it's cute that's what your nature wants but like I said the tongue is a little member but what we have to do is we've got to bring it under control so but Abraham was also like that he wasn't saved he said once before that my dad called me a CCE they were going talked about the fact that they were going with uh the Dad's friend and the dad they were drinking and and then the Father the father's friend said oh have some drink and the father looked at his friend and said oh that's if I ever got a Cissy out of my boys that's the one that a Cissy but Bram felt bad like give it to me I'll drink it but remember he had an experience with God and that experience came back that wind came and said sh and he threw it away I didn't realize it's almost 12 but we're going to close down so brother Braham eventually of course he couldn't do what this lady was asking him to do he couldn't smoke he felt really bad he left the vehicle he started walking away do he tried to do it the Holy Spirit did not allow him to do it he started working away 46 and I sat there I said I'll go home and finish a job nobody wants me and nobody my life is a misery so what's the use of me living sitting out there in that field that night God's grace wish I had more time but I can't to get to that right here to stay to say what taking place but someday I will with God's help now he says you might wonder how I got married I finally found a girl that didn't drink and smoke and I want you to know here if you go back and read the live story but talked about how he and sister hope had received the Holy Ghost and when it was time for them to get married so he went with a girl that went to church he didn't go with a girl who was out in the world when he met Christ right something changed about his life and when they were going to get married he talked about the funny story of where he was so bashful to talk to Sister Hop's mother because she was a very bold woman um and they had had a conversation like you go talk to your mom I'll go talk to your dad and even when he went to talk to uh sister H's father who was called Charles he couldn't even motion out the words to say that I want to marry your daughter they got outside he said oh it's a beautiful day and then Charles look at him like Bill you can have her and he was like are you serious and brother Braham said those same thing that that man said that poor guy brother Braham said I will work till my Palms become callous just to make sure I make a living for her a sense of responsibility but the Holy Ghost made him understand that this was a person meant for you there's so many more things to say maybe God will inspire one of the brothers or our pastor to go into it but just want to encourage our young people brother raham told us that outside of Salvation the best thing that God can give to a man is a good wife so in all of the things that are important in this life is salvation number one and marriage comes next in life there are three major events that happen your birth your marriage and your death is only one of them you're conscious of what's happening and that's marriage let us remember that God designed Mar marriage it was his design because he wants to reflect a relationship that he has with his church with his bride and he says see that example and follow after it I'll call the musicians and let's just be on our feet right at 12:00 right on time I pray that the Lord will use these words whichever way he wants to use it to set the right direction for brothers and sisters who are not yet married and for those that are married if the foundation was wrong he's still a way maker he can repair it in his case he doesn't have to lift the whole building he just goes there and fixes it and regardless of the storms that will come regardless of the rain that will fall that house will stand let's bow our heads to pray dear father we thank you for the opportunity to hear from you this morning it's a bit of an unusual topic but something that is very important in our lives yes Lord if the world says
