[1:06:05] [Music]
[1:06:07] I would invite you now to turn to our
[1:06:09] Bibles
[1:06:14] Isaiah chapter 6.
[1:06:39] sometimes it's hard to come and speak
[1:06:41] after we had such a wonderful Services
[1:06:43] last weekend
[1:06:45] and especially from listening from a
[1:06:48] full-time evangelist
[1:06:50] now you come to a part-time evangelist I
[1:06:53] don't know how it's going to be
[1:06:55] but I hope you have prayed for me
[1:06:58] you continue to pray for me that God may
[1:07:01] have his own way
[1:07:03] our brother took us up to up to the
[1:07:05] throne
[1:07:06] and we felt good
[1:07:09] I saw each one of us was feeling good
[1:07:13] but now before you go there sometimes
[1:07:16] it's good to check your ways
[1:07:19] am I in the right way
[1:07:24] am I working right
[1:07:27] have I qualified to be there
[1:07:29] so that's why sometimes I think it's
[1:07:32] good to bring up part-time evangelists
[1:07:35] to bring us down so that we check
[1:07:37] ourselves once more
[1:07:39] amen Isaiah chapter 6. we read from
[1:07:43] verse one
[1:07:45] in the year that King usia died I saw
[1:07:48] also the Lord sitting upon a throne high
[1:07:52] and lifted up and his train filled the
[1:07:55] temple above it stood the seraphines
[1:07:58] each one had six wings with the twain he
[1:08:02] covered his face and with the twain he
[1:08:05] covered his feet and with the twain he
[1:08:08] did fly and one cried under another and
[1:08:11] said holy holy is the Lord of hordes the
[1:08:16] whole earth is full of his glory and the
[1:08:20] pose of the door moved at the voice of
[1:08:22] him that cried and the house was filled
[1:08:25] with the smoke then said I what is me
[1:08:29] for I am undone because I am a man of
[1:08:33] unclean lips and I dwell in the meetings
[1:08:36] of our people of unclean lips for mine
[1:08:39] eyes have seen the king the Lord of
[1:08:42] hosts then flew one of the seraphims
[1:08:45] onto me having a life called in his hand
[1:08:48] which he had taken with us with the
[1:08:51] tongues from of the Altar and he laid it
[1:08:55] upon my mouth and say it low this have
[1:08:59] touched touched their lips and their
[1:09:01] iniquity is taken away and thy sin is
[1:09:04] patched and I had the voice of the Lord
[1:09:07] saying whom shall I send and who will
[1:09:11] cover us then said I here am I send me
[1:09:16] may God add the blessings you can take
[1:09:18] your seats
[1:09:28] this morning
[1:09:31] I have a short subject
[1:09:36] which I've picked from the message the
[1:09:38] prophet preached and he called it in his
[1:09:41] presence
[1:09:44] now
[1:09:46] you can be in the church
[1:09:49] but you are not in his presence
[1:09:52] you can go on your knees to pray but you
[1:09:56] are not in his presence
[1:09:58] you can praise and shout and do
[1:10:01] everything that you can but you are not
[1:10:04] in his presence but there is something
[1:10:06] special about coming in his presence
[1:10:11] hello
[1:10:13] there is something special about coming
[1:10:16] in his presence
[1:10:18] and you can never come in his presence
[1:10:21] and live the way you came in
[1:10:24] something has to happen
[1:10:26] and that is what we need each one of us
[1:10:29] to come into His presence
[1:10:34] amen
[1:10:37] now
[1:10:39] his presence
[1:10:42] is usually manifested by his voice
[1:10:49] you can recognize his presence by his
[1:10:53] voice
[1:10:57] I want us to be very keen because this
[1:11:01] morning we need to go into his presence
[1:11:05] his presence
[1:11:08] by his voice
[1:11:10] in the Garden of Eden
[1:11:12] Genesis chapter 3 verse 8.
[1:11:16] they had the voice walking in the garden
[1:11:21] when they had the voice
[1:11:23] what they did was to hide themselves why
[1:11:27] because God's presence had come in their
[1:11:30] meetings
[1:11:34] now
[1:11:40] my brother
[1:11:42] put for me
[1:11:45] 620909e 6209
[1:11:50] 09 e paragraph 11.
[1:12:11] paragraph 11.
[1:12:20] okay
[1:12:22] then we realize how little we are
[1:12:25] when we get when how great he is
[1:12:31] then we realize how little we are when
[1:12:34] we realize how great he is
[1:12:39] when you go in his presence and realize
[1:12:42] how great he is then you will realize
[1:12:45] how little you are yourself
[1:12:50] now and how close we come in of coming
[1:12:53] to his presence
[1:12:55] somehow or another it's always throat a
[1:12:59] great effect upon people to come into
[1:13:01] the presence of God it must have an
[1:13:05] effect on you when you come in his
[1:13:07] presence
[1:13:09] you can never come in his presence and
[1:13:12] live the way you came in no something
[1:13:15] has to happen
[1:13:18] and each one of us we are called now to
[1:13:22] come into His presence
[1:13:24] if we will ever have any effect or any
[1:13:27] impact to anybody anywhere we must come
[1:13:31] in the presence of God
[1:13:33] for you to have an assurance that I am
[1:13:36] going home there is nothing that can
[1:13:39] hinder me then you must come in his
[1:13:41] presence
[1:13:43] God help us
[1:13:46] move to paragraph 13.
[1:13:51] okay
[1:13:52] I've been privileged to hear quarterly
[1:13:54] men speak it was said one time of
[1:13:57] Charles Finney little pretty fellow
[1:13:59] never wait over over about 110 pounds
[1:14:03] but he had such a forceful way of
[1:14:06] speaking not me
[1:14:08] he was trying to the of course he was
[1:14:10] trying the Acoustics one day in in a
[1:14:14] building they didn't have PA systems
[1:14:16] then and there was a man repairing up in
[1:14:19] the balcony oh up in the roof of the
[1:14:22] place and he had the man come in so he
[1:14:26] didn't know who they were he just kept
[1:14:28] quiet and Mr Finney was going to try the
[1:14:32] Acoustics after spending much time in
[1:14:35] prayer for that Revival that he was
[1:14:37] going to hold he tried his voice to see
[1:14:40] how it would carry he slipped up quickly
[1:14:43] to the pulpit and said repent or perish
[1:14:46] and he said it with such a force after
[1:14:49] being under the anointing of God till
[1:14:52] the man dropped out of the top of the
[1:14:55] balcony down into the floor or out of
[1:14:58] the top of the building onto the floor
[1:15:01] why Finn had been in the presence of God
[1:15:05] and his voice
[1:15:07] just the just by saying
[1:15:12] somebody failed failed presence
[1:15:14] so you cut once you get into the
[1:15:17] presence that presence transfers into
[1:15:20] you and you can also impact somebody
[1:15:22] else
[1:15:23] and that's what we need today
[1:15:27] may God help us
[1:15:29] okay
[1:15:32] now when the first man as soon as he had
[1:15:35] sinned and done something wrong and when
[1:15:38] God came into his presence or he came
[1:15:41] into the presence of God that was Adam
[1:15:43] he could not stand in the presence of
[1:15:46] God he ran under hid himself in the bush
[1:15:49] and tried to cover himself with a thick
[1:15:52] Leaf because he not he was standing In
[1:15:55] The Presence of Jehovah the Creator that
[1:15:57] was the first man when he realized the
[1:16:00] presence of God then he felt that he was
[1:16:03] unfair and worthy he decided to run away
[1:16:07] but God who is rich in Mercy
[1:16:10] came out calling where at thou Adam
[1:16:13] and he's still the same God
[1:16:16] okay paragraph 16 we could go back and
[1:16:20] take in Genesis the 17th chapter and the
[1:16:23] third verse when the Great Partridge
[1:16:25] Abraham when he came into the presence
[1:16:28] of God and God spoke to him chapter 17
[1:16:32] and in the name of all in the name of
[1:16:35] almighty God Abraham fell on his face
[1:16:39] that great part-right servant of God
[1:16:41] could not stand in the presence of God
[1:16:44] though he served him for 25 years
[1:16:47] Faithfully but when God moved into his
[1:16:51] presence the patriarch fell on his face
[1:16:53] because he could not stand in the
[1:16:56] presence of God
[1:17:01] you can imagine Abraham the son of the
[1:17:05] Son of God what he did when he came in
[1:17:08] the presence of God what Adam did when
[1:17:11] he came in the presence of God now we
[1:17:13] say it earlier on that the presence of
[1:17:15] God is recognized by the voice of God
[1:17:19] now we are living in the days of The
[1:17:21] Voice
[1:17:22] now if we since we are living in the
[1:17:25] days of the voice which means God's
[1:17:27] presence is here
[1:17:32] hello which means God's presence is here
[1:17:36] now if you cannot have a change in you
[1:17:39] then who is the problem
[1:17:41] because you can never get in the
[1:17:44] presence of God and come out the way you
[1:17:46] went in so if you cannot change
[1:17:50] and you claim to have been in the
[1:17:52] presence of God there is something wrong
[1:17:54] with you
[1:17:58] God help us
[1:18:03] I'm already feeling the Heat and they
[1:18:05] have not started preaching
[1:18:08] may God help us
[1:18:10] so we have seen Adam when he came in the
[1:18:14] presence of God we have seen Abraham
[1:18:16] when he came in the presence of God
[1:18:19] oh my in Exodus chapter 3 we find Moses
[1:18:24] the great servant and the prophet of God
[1:18:27] when he was back on the back side of the
[1:18:29] desert that man was a holy man he had
[1:18:32] been born for the purpose he was born
[1:18:35] from his mother's womb to be a prophet
[1:18:37] he had tried to get his education and do
[1:18:40] everything he could to deliver his
[1:18:42] people because he understood that he was
[1:18:45] to deliver his people
[1:18:48] but one day on the back side of the
[1:18:51] desert when he come into the presence of
[1:18:53] God he chucked off his shoes and fell to
[1:18:56] his feet knowing that he was standing on
[1:19:00] a Holy Ground
[1:19:01] that was Moses now we've talked of Adam
[1:19:04] we've talked of Abraham we've talked of
[1:19:07] Moses
[1:19:09] how they behaved when they came in the
[1:19:12] presence of God
[1:19:15] brethrens follow up with me
[1:19:19] it is something I want to say this
[1:19:21] morning
[1:19:21] about coming in his presence
[1:19:24] many things we do we do the way we do
[1:19:28] because we have never been in the
[1:19:30] presence of God
[1:19:32] or we have never realized the presence
[1:19:35] of God in our meetings
[1:19:38] but we have said God's presence is here
[1:19:41] now if his presence is here
[1:19:44] then we need to change
[1:19:48] we need to feel his presence
[1:19:52] amen
[1:19:57] paragraph 19 but when God came down on
[1:20:00] top of Mount Sinai
[1:20:01] and the whole Mountain caught a fire
[1:20:05] and the smoke was flying from it like a
[1:20:08] furnace and the voice of God roared out
[1:20:10] Israel fell on their face and said let
[1:20:14] Moses speak and not God
[1:20:19] these were God's people chosen people
[1:20:21] they desired to they desired to hear
[1:20:24] from God but what happened when he came
[1:20:28] on the road
[1:20:29] when his presence came down they said no
[1:20:33] no no no no no no no that Moses speak
[1:20:35] but not God
[1:20:36] we would rather Moses speak to us but
[1:20:39] not God
[1:20:40] help us
[1:20:43] amen
[1:20:45] any okay they had carried the
[1:20:48] Commandments and everything but when God
[1:20:51] spoke and they moved up into his
[1:20:53] presence they realized that they were
[1:20:55] out they were they were not right there
[1:20:58] was something that was lacking because
[1:21:01] they were in the presence of God
[1:21:04] so when you get into his presence then
[1:21:07] you realize what you have and what you
[1:21:10] don't have
[1:21:13] but many times we justify ourselves why
[1:21:16] because we have never come into His
[1:21:19] presence
[1:21:20] so I beg you and I plead with you this
[1:21:24] morning let us surrender ourselves so
[1:21:27] that we go in his presence
[1:21:29] it will bring a change in our lives
[1:21:32] it will make us think right it will make
[1:21:35] us do right when we come into His
[1:21:38] presence
[1:21:40] amen
[1:21:43] now paragraph 22 Abraham recognized
[1:21:47] himself wrong
[1:21:49] Adam recognized himself wrong
[1:21:51] which was the son of God recognized
[1:21:54] himself wrong Moses recognized himself
[1:21:57] wrong Israel as a church and Nation
[1:22:00] recognized themselves wrong depart from
[1:22:03] me for I am a sinful man he didn't try
[1:22:07] to say now I am a holy and worthy to
[1:22:10] receive this he said I am a sinful man
[1:22:12] all BattleCraft 23 23 one time a
[1:22:16] self-style religionist with all the
[1:22:19] theology that he could learn under a
[1:22:21] great teacher called kamariel his name
[1:22:23] was Saul of tassas which which we know
[1:22:27] as Paul religious to the to the daughter
[1:22:30] he not all the ins and outs of their of
[1:22:34] their religion he was a Pharisee of the
[1:22:37] Pharisees in the Hebrew or a Hebrew of
[1:22:39] the Hebrews he was anointed man as
[1:22:42] called as mad shrewd educated claimed he
[1:22:45] not God from baby up but one day on his
[1:22:49] road to add Damascus that Pillar of Fire
[1:22:52] shined over him he fell off his foot on
[1:22:56] the ground and then passed and said Lord
[1:22:59] what would you have me to do
[1:23:03] that's what happens when you come in his
[1:23:05] presence
[1:23:06] Lord what would you have me to do
[1:23:10] okay what about
[1:23:12] the paragraph 26 what about the great
[1:23:15] Saint John of Revelation 1 1 7 when he
[1:23:20] was shot the vision and looked and had a
[1:23:23] voice speaking to him remember we are we
[1:23:27] are saying God's presence is recognized
[1:23:29] by The Voice
[1:23:31] so mark that one
[1:23:33] okay when he he looked and had a voice
[1:23:37] speaking to him and he turned to look to
[1:23:39] see the voice I don't know how do you
[1:23:41] dance to see The Voice
[1:23:45] yeah okay when he turned to see the
[1:23:47] voice and he saw seven cold and
[1:23:49] candlesticks and one stood in the
[1:23:51] meetings of the seven cold and
[1:23:53] candlesticks with hair like wool eyes
[1:23:56] like flames of fire feet like pillars of
[1:23:59] brass he was cudded with a coward and
[1:24:01] kadle around the pups and he was called
[1:24:04] the word of God and when the Great Saint
[1:24:07] John had walked with Christ he leaned
[1:24:10] upon his possum when he done all these
[1:24:14] things as I said this morning Paul's
[1:24:16] Ministry exceeded of them here after
[1:24:19] John had walked with Jesus talked with
[1:24:22] him slept with him ate it with him but
[1:24:26] when he seen him standing there that
[1:24:29] glorified State he said he fell like a
[1:24:32] Dead Man At His Feet amen think of it
[1:24:37] we can come to church we can talk we can
[1:24:40] praise God and so forth but oh brother
[1:24:43] when we see him coming
[1:24:49] that's what we need brethrens
[1:24:52] when we see him coming
[1:24:55] something will be different in our
[1:24:58] hearts
[1:24:59] when we come in his presence something
[1:25:02] will be different in our hearts
[1:25:05] oh my we might think of religious Duty
[1:25:09] by by to go to church and pay our tithes
[1:25:12] we might think that he will keep the
[1:25:15] laws of the church and recite all the
[1:25:17] crits but once once let us get a look at
[1:25:21] him the whole things changed all the way
[1:25:24] around yes it sure will
[1:25:27] now Isaiah where we read
[1:25:30] he was a prophet
[1:25:32] a mighty prophet
[1:25:34] but when he came in the presence of God
[1:25:38] he said war unto me for I am an
[1:25:46] I am unclean
[1:25:48] dwelling amongst unclean people
[1:25:54] but he was a prophet
[1:25:57] why was he and green
[1:25:59] when he came in the presence of God and
[1:26:03] we said when you come in the presence of
[1:26:06] God you feel how little you are and how
[1:26:09] great he is
[1:26:13] so many times we do things because we
[1:26:16] have never come in the presence of God
[1:26:19] may God help us
[1:26:22] Isaiah saw Visions he was a prophet
[1:26:24] Isaiah preached the word he was a
[1:26:27] minister Isaiah was a holy man but one
[1:26:30] day standing in the temple he fell into
[1:26:32] a trance and he saw the glory of God he
[1:26:36] saw the angels with wings over their
[1:26:38] face Wings over their feet flying with
[1:26:41] wings crying holy holy is the Lord God
[1:26:44] Almighty that Prophet realized that he
[1:26:47] was nothing he said what is me for I am
[1:26:51] a man of unclean lips a prophet a
[1:26:54] mightiest prophet of the Bible one of
[1:26:56] them I am a man with unclean lips and I
[1:26:59] dwell amongst people that is on clean
[1:27:01] lips what is me because I see the glory
[1:27:04] of God I think what we need is to see
[1:27:07] the glory of God
[1:27:10] it would help us
[1:27:13] amen under he said when that angel cried
[1:27:16] the post of the temple Shook Back and
[1:27:19] Forth brother that will make not only
[1:27:22] the boss of the temple going to shake
[1:27:24] but the whole heavens and the Earth is
[1:27:27] going to shake when he comes again the
[1:27:30] mountains will free and the Sea will fit
[1:27:32] away and the scream hide us from the
[1:27:35] face of that of him that he sits upon
[1:27:38] the throne it is going to be a terrible
[1:27:40] time for The Sinner
[1:27:44] now remember if such a holy man
[1:27:46] recognized themselves sinners in the
[1:27:49] presence of God what will the Sinner and
[1:27:51] the encodile do on that day
[1:27:54] now we are not addressing the the
[1:27:56] Sinners and the unquotely we are tracing
[1:27:58] those who already claim they have been
[1:28:01] in the presence of God
[1:28:03] we talked about Adam we talked about
[1:28:05] Abraham Moses and the rest when they
[1:28:09] came in the presence of God how they
[1:28:11] failed now we want to address now the
[1:28:14] people who already say they have been in
[1:28:17] the presence of God so that now we see
[1:28:19] the effect of coming in the presence of
[1:28:22] God
[1:28:24] amen okay
[1:28:28] now remember if such a holy man okay
[1:28:30] what
[1:28:32] what will people do sit in the meetings
[1:28:35] what will the people do that has that
[1:28:37] has seen the power of God that has had
[1:28:40] the countdown of the word that has seen
[1:28:43] God manifested himself and beyond a
[1:28:46] shadow of Doubt every scripture
[1:28:48] fulfilled and will still try to make it
[1:28:51] to heaven without being born again
[1:28:56] may God have mercy on us
[1:29:00] we need now to go in the presence of God
[1:29:05] if what we have seen it is a proof that
[1:29:09] God is in our meetings then it behooves
[1:29:12] each one of us to get into the presence
[1:29:15] of God
[1:29:16] that is the only thing that will make
[1:29:18] you sing I am going home
[1:29:22] and there is nothing that will hinder me
[1:29:25] hey amen oh what kind of a place are we
[1:29:30] going to stand in if we see God unfold
[1:29:34] himself right before us and see the
[1:29:36] glory of God just the same as the men
[1:29:39] did and that kind of men Cried Out
[1:29:42] prophets and searches upon whom the word
[1:29:45] is best upon if they cried and fell to
[1:29:48] their feet under screamed I am a ma I am
[1:29:52] I'm a man of Unholy lips and cleanliness
[1:29:55] what will it be then for that man who
[1:29:59] won't even confess his sins
[1:30:05] what will it be for that hard-hearted
[1:30:08] man that thinks he knows more about
[1:30:11] God's creation than God does himself
[1:30:15] may God have mercy on us
[1:30:18] let's not assume
[1:30:21] it's not now time to presume
[1:30:24] it's time to be sure
[1:30:27] it's time to come to a point where you
[1:30:29] can say I am going home
[1:30:32] and nothing will hinder me
[1:30:35] I've put everything under the blood I've
[1:30:38] confessed my sins I am right
[1:30:41] why I have been in the presence of God
[1:30:45] help us
[1:30:47] paragraph 35 this is evangelism this is
[1:30:51] the time to shake people
[1:30:53] please sorry I'm not checking you
[1:30:55] I'm just creating the quote
[1:30:58] the prophet saying this is the time to
[1:31:00] shake people
[1:31:03] then Shake ourselves
[1:31:05] and see where we are standing
[1:31:09] we are going
[1:31:11] I am going
[1:31:14] so the prophet is saying
[1:31:16] time to shake people
[1:31:18] this is the time that God said there
[1:31:21] would come a time he shook Mount Sinai
[1:31:23] one time but there would come as shaking
[1:31:26] again that he wouldn't only Shake Mount
[1:31:29] Sinai but he would Shake everything that
[1:31:31] could be moved but did you notice the
[1:31:34] rest of the scripture but we receive a
[1:31:36] king a kingdom that cannot be moved
[1:31:41] if you have received that Kingdom there
[1:31:43] is nothing to fear
[1:31:45] you have already received the kingdom
[1:31:47] you know and you know that you have
[1:31:50] received the kingdom
[1:31:51] oh my
[1:31:54] yes we have received a kingdom that
[1:31:57] cannot be moved Hallelujah everything
[1:31:59] that that he shook that peace that can
[1:32:02] be shook will be shaken the heavens will
[1:32:04] shake the Earth will shake heavens and
[1:32:07] earth will pass away but that word shall
[1:32:10] never pass away for Upon This Rock I'll
[1:32:13] build my church and the kids of Hell
[1:32:15] will never Prevail against it
[1:32:18] the case of Hell will be against you
[1:32:21] but they will never prevail
[1:32:25] if you have been in his presence
[1:32:28] oh oh my
[1:32:31] okay
[1:32:39] God help us
[1:32:41] paragraph 38 repented Sinners though
[1:32:45] doesn't have any fear repented
[1:32:48] you have repented right
[1:32:51] hello
[1:32:54] those who have repented right they don't
[1:32:56] have any fear
[1:32:59] why they know they have put everything
[1:33:03] under the blood
[1:33:11] there is what God wants us to do and he
[1:33:15] tells us how to do it
[1:33:19] so the sinner who has repented right
[1:33:23] there is no fear
[1:33:26] why he knows that there is a bloody
[1:33:29] sacrifice waiting to stand in his place
[1:33:32] that is what gives me the consolation I
[1:33:35] have seen the glory of God I have felt
[1:33:38] his power I know the touch of his hand I
[1:33:41] know the touch of his chastisement I
[1:33:44] know that he has he is God and I know I
[1:33:48] am undone but there is one standing
[1:33:50] there for me
[1:33:53] there is one who stands there and says
[1:33:56] father lay all of his iniquity upon me
[1:33:59] because he stood for me down on the
[1:34:02] earth Hallelujah then I walk to the
[1:34:05] throne of God boldly having Grace in my
[1:34:08] heart to know it is not by good works
[1:34:12] but it is by his mercies I am saved not
[1:34:16] what I could do but what I could what I
[1:34:19] could join but what I could say but it
[1:34:22] is by his grace that I am saved
[1:34:26] so we are not ordained to do nothing but
[1:34:29] to stay in the world
[1:34:33] take in the word
[1:34:36] let the word be your guide
[1:34:40] put everything
[1:34:43] aside and let the word guide you
[1:34:47] God help us
[1:34:49] then after that when we come in his
[1:34:52] presence when a man once comes into the
[1:34:55] presence of God he is changed forever
[1:35:02] oh sometimes I feel I'm on the mountain
[1:35:05] sometimes I feel I'm in the in the in
[1:35:08] the valley but the prophet says a man
[1:35:11] who has been in the presence of God is
[1:35:14] changed forever
[1:35:17] he takes over
[1:35:19] he takes over challenges will come but
[1:35:22] you know whom you are you have believed
[1:35:25] you know
[1:35:26] who
[1:35:27] goes ahead of you
[1:35:29] you know where you stand
[1:35:33] trials will come
[1:35:35] and let them come
[1:35:37] hello
[1:35:39] let them come if you know where you are
[1:35:43] standing
[1:35:48] okay
[1:35:49] about the Samaritan woman
[1:35:51] when she came in the presence of God
[1:35:56] she changed her life
[1:35:58] her life was changed
[1:36:00] and the prophet says
[1:36:02] yes they have got to do it a man when a
[1:36:05] man when once you come into the presence
[1:36:08] of God you have a responsibility to tell
[1:36:11] others
[1:36:16] you have a responsibility to tell others
[1:36:19] if you have come into His presence
[1:36:23] how you may not stand on the pulpit to
[1:36:26] preach but your life can preach to
[1:36:28] somebody
[1:36:30] your life can preach to somebody
[1:36:33] will look at you and say this is a
[1:36:36] Christian I want to be like this man I
[1:36:39] want to be like this woman
[1:36:42] you are alive if you have been in the
[1:36:44] presence of God your life will preach to
[1:36:46] somebody you will have a responsibility
[1:36:49] to tell someone else
[1:36:53] when the Samaritan woman came into the
[1:36:56] presence of God what happened she ran
[1:36:59] into the city telling people come and
[1:37:01] see
[1:37:04] the one I have met
[1:37:07] God help us
[1:37:10] oh my
[1:37:12] now
[1:37:14] Moses was responsible to tell others
[1:37:17] Peter when he came in his presence he
[1:37:19] was responsible to tell others Paul when
[1:37:22] he came in his presence he was
[1:37:24] responsible to tell others now if you
[1:37:27] have been in the presence of God you are
[1:37:29] also responsible to tell someone else
[1:37:35] your life can speak to somebody
[1:37:42] oh yes
[1:37:45] sorry
[1:37:49] listen to this story paragraph 54.
[1:37:52] a young lady come from a country Church
[1:37:55] and her father was an old-fashioned
[1:37:58] shouting preacher or a member of the
[1:38:01] church and so she moved into the City
[1:38:03] and she got all mixed up with the women
[1:38:06] down there and got through acting like
[1:38:08] they did
[1:38:09] and the and and the Fashions and one day
[1:38:13] she was kind of ashamed of her Papa and
[1:38:16] Mama to come or her father rather her
[1:38:18] mother was dead so the old man only
[1:38:21] thing he will do get up of a morning eat
[1:38:24] his breakfast get the piper read it and
[1:38:28] cry and pray and shout all day long
[1:38:34] I'm sure if you have such a person in
[1:38:36] our meetings
[1:38:38] many of us will want to avoid him
[1:38:44] his business was to read the Bible and
[1:38:47] pray
[1:38:48] read and pray
[1:38:52] and run up and down
[1:38:54] the room and he was a little embarrassed
[1:39:00] young ones please don't be embarrassed
[1:39:02] by your parents don't be embarrassed by
[1:39:05] this by your parents holding this
[1:39:07] message
[1:39:08] don't be embarrassed oh my oh my mom is
[1:39:12] coming
[1:39:14] and my friends will see she's wearing a
[1:39:16] long dress
[1:39:18] you feel embarrassed God have mercy on
[1:39:21] you
[1:39:23] here was our God
[1:39:25] she was embarrassed by her father
[1:39:29] being an Old Fashioned
[1:39:32] believer
[1:39:33] God have mercy on us
[1:39:35] so one day he was going to entertain her
[1:39:37] church members
[1:39:39] the prophet is not me it's the prophet
[1:39:40] she was going to entertain her church
[1:39:42] members
[1:39:44] so she was a member of a member of a
[1:39:47] church somewhere
[1:39:49] and they were going to have a little tea
[1:39:51] party like they always have you know so
[1:39:54] she didn't know what she was going to do
[1:39:57] with her dad after all
[1:40:00] it was had that day so she decided to
[1:40:03] put him up in the attic and say daddy
[1:40:06] you know you don't want to be around
[1:40:08] where these women are do you say no I
[1:40:12] don't believe I want to do that he said
[1:40:14] well we are going to have the church
[1:40:16] women up here today and we are going to
[1:40:19] have a little meeting a little prayer
[1:40:21] meeting it was a prayer meeting
[1:40:24] I tell you that why don't you just go up
[1:40:28] in the attic said I just believe I will
[1:40:31] do
[1:40:32] so she said read this book so she gave
[1:40:35] him a geography book
[1:40:41] because if she gave him the Bible it
[1:40:44] would be chaotic
[1:40:46] so she gave him a geography book
[1:40:49] and told him to sit in the Attic
[1:40:52] which which he agreed and he was there
[1:40:55] all right
[1:40:56] but as he read it
[1:41:02] as he read it
[1:41:04] you can read a history book and get a
[1:41:07] word for
[1:41:11] me you can you can read a geography book
[1:41:14] and you get something that can change
[1:41:15] your life
[1:41:18] while he was up there or he read about
[1:41:21] the bottomless beat of the sea
[1:41:24] things went hey things went wrong
[1:41:27] upstairs
[1:41:31] until she had to run Daddy I thought I
[1:41:33] gave you a geography book he said yes I
[1:41:35] know but I read something
[1:41:38] oh that related to what I read in the
[1:41:41] Bible yesterday
[1:41:43] can you get something that you read in
[1:41:45] the Bible yesterday today
[1:41:50] may God help us
[1:41:53] oh my about that something Cut Loose
[1:41:57] upstairs or the screaming and jumping
[1:42:00] and the plaster falling the old man
[1:42:03] running up and down through the attic
[1:42:05] just as hard as he could go jumping up
[1:42:08] and down and hollering glory to God
[1:42:10] glory to God the women didn't know what
[1:42:13] happened up there
[1:42:15] what they had upstairs so direct so
[1:42:17] directly down the steps he come hard as
[1:42:21] he could go she said Daddy I gave you a
[1:42:24] geography to read
[1:42:28] God help us
[1:42:32] amen
[1:42:36] okay
[1:42:44] I'm rushing Against Time there is some
[1:42:46] there is some more
[1:42:48] we have to know
[1:42:50] that you know
[1:42:52] you have been in the presence of God
[1:42:55] that is the only thing that will matter
[1:42:58] is to know that you have been in the
[1:43:01] presence of God
[1:43:03] please I beg you
[1:43:05] the things that happens in our meetings
[1:43:07] is because we have never been in the
[1:43:09] presence of God
[1:43:11] may God help us this morning
[1:43:14] so that we can change
[1:43:16] how we approach him
[1:43:18] so that we can go in his presence
[1:43:20] because what happens in his presence the
[1:43:24] prophet says you can never be in his
[1:43:26] presence and come out the same no
[1:43:29] something has to change
[1:43:31] amen
[1:43:33] oh that was Jacob
[1:43:36] one time
[1:43:39] he lied to his father his father
[1:43:41] wherever he was wherever he was going he
[1:43:45] could lie but one day
[1:43:49] he was going home
[1:43:52] and who was waiting a Sao was waiting
[1:43:57] now he realized that he didn't have what
[1:44:01] it takes to meet with the Esau
[1:44:04] hello
[1:44:07] credit
[1:44:08] he realized that he didn't have what it
[1:44:12] takes to meet with Esau
[1:44:14] I wonder how many of us have what it
[1:44:17] takes to meet with Esau Esau was coming
[1:44:23] so what he did
[1:44:26] he needed to come in the presence of God
[1:44:30] and when he peeled an altar where he met
[1:44:34] with God after meeting with God now he
[1:44:37] had to go to meet with Esau what
[1:44:40] happened when he met with Esau Esau was
[1:44:43] confused whether he's going to meet with
[1:44:45] an enemy or a friend or a brother
[1:44:49] so I think what we need is to have an
[1:44:52] experience of me of getting in the
[1:44:55] presence of God so when you got to meet
[1:44:57] with your enemies they will be confused
[1:45:00] They Don't Know Who You Are
[1:45:02] that's what we need preterance
[1:45:05] to have what it takes to meet with the
[1:45:07] Esau and there are so many Sowers around
[1:45:09] us
[1:45:11] God help us
[1:45:13] no wonder the prophet says we need more
[1:45:15] Jacobs today
[1:45:19] we need more Jacobs today who can
[1:45:22] realize that I don't have what it takes

[1:48:05] law study and become a mightiest
[1:48:07] preacher of these nations ever had yet

[1:48:22] to pray he thought he was a preacher
[1:48:26] hello
[1:48:28] he thought he was a preacher a mighty
[1:48:31] preacher
[1:48:34] he had a desire that he wanted to preach
[1:48:37] and he had him a few summons he had
[1:48:40] tried to preach he went out one day out
[1:48:43] of his office to pray when out in the
[1:48:45] woods he got down behind an old blown
[1:48:48] down tree where he had gone every
[1:48:51] afternoon very religious but he didn't
[1:48:54] believe in that there was two women in
[1:48:58] the church kept saying Mr Finney we are
[1:49:01] praying that you will receive the Holy
[1:49:03] Ghost
[1:49:04] he said I go to the Holy Ghost
[1:49:07] said I am a preacher
[1:49:09] they say Mr Finney you are a great man
[1:49:12] and you've got a great hold of the word
[1:49:15] but you need the Holy Ghost
[1:49:20] we are praying for you sweet little
[1:49:23] women
[1:49:27] I wonder if we have such a sweet little

[1:49:42] are praying for you that you receive the
[1:49:44] Holy Ghost

[1:50:00] that you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:50:03] but the man was claiming to have the
[1:50:05] Holocaust
[1:50:07] but these sisters they had this
[1:50:09] sentiment
[1:50:12] they knew something had not happened
[1:50:16] okay so he went on so every day he would
[1:50:20] go out behind his office his boss and
[1:50:23] all of them there he walked and he he
[1:50:26] got out out of his law office and go out
[1:50:29] there to pray and one day he was out
[1:50:32] there praying and he had a brush break
[1:50:35] he thought his post was coming up
[1:50:37] handing him he jumped up real quick he
[1:50:41] was saying Lord Oh Lord oh Lord I

[1:55:51] amen
[1:55:56] amen now
[1:56:01] I can now start by someone that was the
[1:56:03] introduction
[1:56:08] when you come in the presence of God
[1:56:12] that presence of God now transfers
[1:56:16] from God to you
[1:56:24] I'll repeat it when you come in the
[1:56:27] presence of God that presence now
[1:56:30] transferred where our brother ready to
[1:56:32] last last weekend all that was that was
[1:56:36] in God was brought in Christ and all
[1:56:40] that was in Christ was brought in there
[1:56:43] now that presence is now in you
[1:56:49] when you get into his presence that
[1:56:53] presence now is transferred
[1:56:58] now once that presence is transferred
[1:57:01] into you
[1:57:03] then wherever you are
[1:57:07] you are his presence
[1:57:11] now what will happen
[1:57:14] when you sit some next to somebody who
[1:57:17] has the presence of God
[1:57:20] hello
[1:57:22] what will happen
[1:57:26] sitting closer to somebody who has the
[1:57:29] presence of God what will happen if you

[1:57:59] holding the presence of God
[1:58:04] hello
[1:58:07] do we ever realize
[1:58:10] that's why I started by saying that
[1:58:13] things men at times we do is because we
[1:58:17] have never come in the presence of God
[1:58:20] now when you come in the presence of God
[1:58:22] and that presence is transferred in you
[1:58:25] and that sister the presence of God has
[1:58:28] transferred into her what happens when
[1:58:31] you meet with the presence of God in you

[2:15:26] with the husband
[2:15:27] why he was having God's presence
[2:15:36] it was so easy just stockings

[2:15:41] hamada-in-law
[2:15:44] which was okay

[2:15:46] but she kept it from telling the husband
[2:15:52] how many of us
[2:15:54] we are holding things against other
[2:15:57] who are having the presence of God in
[2:16:02] them
[2:16:05] God have mercy on us
[2:16:08] we hold something we say it doesn't
[2:16:11] matter it's just a small thing
[2:16:14] but there's talkings the story of the
[2:16:17] stockings it looks so simple a very
[2:16:20] small thing a small matter actually
[2:16:26] her mother-in-law
[2:16:29] that thing he was a prophet
[2:16:32] he didn't want her to go in the other
[2:16:35] presence with that thing on her heart

[2:16:42] the little things we are holding
[2:16:45] kindness to one another
