Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight thank you musicians once again if you'll turn with me in the Book of Revelations chapter 3 Revelation chapter 3 carrying on our study in the leodan church age out of the exposition of the seven Church ages Revelations chapter 3 closing out of the chapter just before a tremendous change in the ministry in the Book of Revelation start with verse 14 of Revelations chapter 3 and unto the angel of the Church of the Leo Deans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou W cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isav that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will Su with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches we know this church age here has one of the most special positions the most special opportunities out of all of the church ages it's not to sit with him in his throne not to sit with him uh by his throne it's to sit with him in his throne and that is a tremendous thing let's just bow and prayer PR one more time Heavenly Father Lord we just thank you for this word thank you for the opportunity Lord to hear your word in the age in which we live we pray Lord Jesus that tonight you would just allow us to push back all of the humanity and the carnality Lord and just allow us all to unite together in one mind and one Accord to allow your spirit to move sovereignly in our meeting tonight father bless your words as they're read tonight we pray in in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you tonight you may be seated certainly thankful to be back in service we've had some wonderful Services recently I sure enjoyed the service on Sunday and I believe we're only getting started on that topic and thrilled to see what the Lord will do with it tonight we're going to carry on in our discussion in the Leo Ian Church age out of the exposition of the seven Church ages before we do that just a few announcements we have brother Cadre here this weekend we have a 6 PM service on Saturday we have a breakfast Saturday morning at 10: a.m. and that's for the brothers and uh the details were sent out just let me know if you have any questions about that then we have uh regular service on Sunday with brother Cadre and we will have the youth at our house on Sunday after service certainly excited for what the Lord will do there and uh February the 26th we have canceled the regular Wednesday evening service for the men's meeting the annual general meeting so keep us in prayer for that and just remember the 26th Wednesday will be the men's meeting and then uh as mentioned before September 12th 13th 14th basically the middle of September we have brother Andrew Glover coming here um I think I forgot to mention this on Sunday I can't remember whether I did or not but uh I had a note from brother mvin that the tax receipts for qualified donations received in 2024 by clwa will be issued on the week of February the 17th so if you're looking for a tax receipt that will be coming and uh we certainly are thankful that we're able to donate that way are you happy tonight picking up from where we left off last week I uh I just think it's wonderful to look at this it's not wonderful to look at what necessarily we were studying but it's wonderful to look at our position as Believers brother Bram talks about the condition in this age how there's more money there's more convenience there's more ease of living but there's way less quality of life there's way more stress there's way more anxiety there's way more fear there's way more illness there's way more problems than there should be and brother Bram he says it's without a known reason inside is a Dark Void Cavern that is crying out in torment and without a reason men's hearts are failing for fear and the world is so darkened that this age could well be called the age of neurotics if it boasts but it cannot come back can it cannot back it up it cries peace and there is no peace it cries that it has a great amplitude of all things but it keeps burning with desire like an unsatisfied fire there is no peace saith my God to the wicked Isaiah 57:21 they are miserable that means that they are object to be pied pied they scorn pity they are full of Pride they vaunt what they have but what they have will not stand the test of time they have built upon quicksand rather than the rock of revelation of God's word it's interesting that he calls it quicksand because it's almost like fast food isn't it if you've ever looked at the way services are in uh different churches and you know we certainly don't want to compare ourselves but I've heard it said many times that some services are mostly shows with 15 minutes of of discussion on some scripture but uh he says that they're built on quicksand not the revelation of God's word soon cometh the earthquake soon there will come the storms of the wrath of God in judgment then comes sudden destruction and in spite of all their carnal preparation creation they will still be unprepared for what comes upon the Earth they are those who in spite of all their worldly efforts are actually opposing themselves and don't know it objects of pity are they indeed pity the poor people who are LED in this last day ecumenical move for they call it the move of God when it is of Satan pity those who do not know the curse of organization pity those who have so many beautiful churches such lovely parsonages such grandly trained choirs such a show of wealth and such a sedate and reverent form of worship pity them don't envy them back to the old store buildings back to the dimly lit rooms back to the sellers back to less of the world and more of God pity those who make their great claims and talk about their gifts feel for them as objects of pity for soon they will be objects of Wrath he talks about they are poor now of course that means spiritually poor and we talked about it a little bit earlier last time about how brother bradam mentioned bankruptcy they're bankrupt and you know we can look at that financially but but he's talking spiritually spiritually bankrupt many many people are spiritually bankrupt they simply come to church on the weekends maybe the middle of the week and that's all they do there's no prayer meetings there's no time spent in the word there's no dedication to a one-on-one relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ and if we're not investing that way in our lives then what we're doing is bankrupting ourselves spiritually we become spiritually poor brother Bram says they are poor now of course that means spiritually poor the sign of this age as it closes is bigger and better churches with more and more people with more and more manifestation of what is supposed to be denominations of the Holy Ghost demonstrations of the Holy Ghost sorry but the filled altars and gifts of the Spirit in operation the remarkable attendance is not the answer from God for those who come to the altars very seldom stay to go on with God and after the great campaigns are finished where are all those who came down the aisles they heard a man they listened to an appeal they came into the net but were not fish and turtle likee they crawled back to their own Waters then there is all this talk about glossia it is supposed to be the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and people are thinking that we are in the midst of a great Revival the Revival is over the Vindicated Prophet for our age we can look back at Luther and say he he could potentially have declared it maybe Wesley maybe Paul but here we have the prophet in our age saying the Revival is over America had her last chance in 1957 now the T of go are God's sign of impending disaster even as they were when they appeared upon the wall at belshazzar's feast and remember there was nobody there to interpret those words the king couldn't understand them although they were there all of the host in the room couldn't understand them although all of them were there there was only one that could understand those words and that was the Vindicated prophet in that day don't you know that many are going to come in the last day and sayl Lord have we not done many wonderful Works in thy name even to the casting out of devils and he will say depart from me ye that work iniquity I never knew you there was no intimacy there was no relationship you knew what to do and never did it and you knew what not to do but yet you still did it I never knew you Jesus said they were workers of iniquity yet you get a man that can come and pray for the sick get oil and blood appearing in the congregation prophecy coming forth and all manner of the Supernatural and the people will gather around him and swear that he is of the Lord even though he is actually making a money racket of religion and living in sin now I just want to be clear about this there's some people who are very good people that would probably fit the description that we just read but what is sin let's be clear it's not necessarily uh living immorally it's not necessarily not going to church or or doing things in the flesh that's not necessarily Sin Sin according to the prophet is unbelief unbelieving the word of a vind ated Prophet would become sin the only reason they have is the absolutely unbiblical answer of well he gets results so he must be of God how terrible how actually poor this age is in the spirit of God and the poor poverty-stricken ones don't even know it it truly is a blessing to know it isn't it it really is it's something that God has given us it's a gift you are blind and naked now this is really desperate how can anyone be blind and naked and not know it yet it says that they are blind and naked and can't perceive it the answer is they are spiritually blind and spiritually naked do you remember when Elisha and gazi were surrounded by the army of the syrians you know remember that story of Elisha and his servant Elisha was resting the prophet was at rest he knew he was in control but the servant opened the window to take in some sunlight maybe first thing in the morning and he looked around and he saw the enemy the syrians were everywhere they were surrounded they were under siege and what happened he panicked but the prophet turned and said to himl open the boy's eyes let him see there's way more for us than there is against us even the servant of the Lord was blind but it took the words of the Prophet to open his eyes it's so powerful brother bradam says you recall that Elisha smote them Blind by the power of God Elisha didn't hide in the house he went right out to meet him and said who you looking for what's up the man they were looking for was bold and courageous in the face of his enemy he had no fear he knew God was in complete control it was through the power of God yet their eyes were wide open and they could see where they were going I I remember preaching on this story it uh it's a powerful story when you think about it because these were trained soldiers but they were blind but their eyes were open they were able to lead them and they took them right back into captivity and we know that the the the captors they wanted to do something to them and came and asked the prophet and the prophet said no no no we we actually prepare a table in the midst of our enemies we don't destroy them feed them treat them nicely and what happened because of that he actually changed turned the behavior of the syrians they became allies out of it but brother bami says here the blindness was peculiar and that they could see certain things but other certain things such as Elisha and the servant and the camp of Israel they could not see what this Army could not see did not Avail for them what they did not see brought on their captivity brothers and sisters today tonight what we cannot see can bring on on our own captivity we're not just reading this book about some other people out there we're comparing ourselves to this book here there's things that can be happening in our lives that we can't see and we need to pray and ask God to show us help us to see the things that could create our own captivity now what does this mean to us it means exactly what it meant back there in the Earthly Ministry of Jesus he tried to teach them truth but they would not listen why wouldn't they listen because of tradition because of Pride they had been doing it for many years and and they had heard it all they I mean they didn't realize though there was actually a corner being turned even in the day in which they lived John 9:40 to 41 and some of the Pharisees the most religious of the day which were with him heard these words and said unto himare we blind also you're telling us this stuff but you're are we blind Jesus said unto them if you were blind you should have no sin but because you can see he says but now ye say we see Therefore your sin remaineth because the word was made flesh and standing right in front of them the attitude of this AG is exactly what it was then people have it all they know it all they cannot be taught I say Lord let us not have it all let us have a hunger and a thirst to cry out for what we don't have and that is more revelation we have got to have more Revelation in our lives brothers and sisters and I want to say this I think it's so important it's not about the Mysteries it's not about the seals it's not about the Deep doctrines it's about the ABCs it's about being able to do the ABCs because if we can get the foundation down pat all of the algebra will follow it will just happen it will open our eyes to the things that will lead us into captivity otherwise people have it all they know it all they cannot be taught you know what they say about people that can't be taught it means they're dead and and sometimes people are well alive but dead inside because they can't be taught if a point of truth from the word comes up and a man tries to explain his view to one with an opposing view The Listener is not at all listening that he might learn but is listening only to refute what is being said I just can't help but think how we can so easily look around and say well I've got this quote and I've got that quote and what about the other quote and and and it just turns into this why are we doing that brothers and sisters we're brothers and sisters there's no need for that says now I want to ask a fair question can scripture fight scripture does the bible contradict the Bible can there be two doctrines of Truth in the word that say the opposite or oppose the other I love it it's in it is in capitals there too it says no it cannot be so yet how many of God's people have their eyes open to that truth not even 1% as far as I know have learned that all scripture is given by God and all is profitable for Doctrine reproof correction Etc you know if we have an error in our life and God chooses to use a child a little we little child to say a word of Correction ction in our life would we be willing to accept it if it lines up with the word or would we say I've been doing this for so many years what has the child got to say to me where do we stand tonight brothers and sisters we don't want to be These Guys these people in here that he's talking about if all scripture is thusly given then every verse will dovetail if given a chance but how many believe in predestination unto election and reprobation unto destruction that that is a very strong sentence it's a very difficult question because when we do that when we just say Amen to that we we take control completely out of our hands and place it in God's hands and and and then you get the the opposition that would say well how could you be a free moral agent if if that's the way it is the ones who are vessels onto destruction will go onto destruction the ones who aren't will go onto the word that's how it works those who don't will they listen no they will not yet both are in the word and nothing will change it but to learn about it and reconcile the truth of those doctrines with other truths that excuse me that seem to oppose they will not take the time but they stop their ears and Nash with their teeth and brother bam he says it here he says they lose out at the end of this age a prophet will come but will be blind to all that he is doing and saying they are so sure they are right and in their blindness they will lose it all I just want to pause here for a second and just say this brothers and sisters we are talking about a word for our day yeah we're not talking about a word for 1965 brother brandham is talking about a prophet that will come who's the prophet in the land today who is that Prophet that he's talking about today once upon a time it was William Maryam Bram but he said very clearly the prophet in the land today is the Holy Ghost so we need to make sure that we're actually reading this the right way we're able to read between the lines and catch what the spirit's saying to the church we can be so right in the message and Miss what the Holy Ghost is actually trying to teach us he's never going to teach us different than the word he's never going to teach us different than the message but how do you get so many different disputings and upsets in and around the message it's because we don't want to actually grow and learn we we have an idea that we've been there and we've done that but it's not about quotes versus quotes I'm right you're wrong my quotes bigger or better or longer shorter it's not about quotes it's about the Holy Ghost leadership in our lives and that's what makes people funny they don't like to let go and let God control their lives we have to be very careful he says they are so sure they're right and in their blindness they will lose it all now God says that they are naked as well as blind I cannot imagine anything as tragic as a man who is blind and naked and doesn't know it there's only one answer he's out of his mind he is already deep in Oblivion his faculties are gone spiritual Amnesia has set in what else can it mean can it mean that the Holy Spirit has taken his leave of this last day church can it mean that men have put God out of their minds to such an extent that it's happening even as stated in Romans 1: 128 and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient now we can look at that scripture and say that that is you know that's that's perversion to the Max and sure enough this world is dealing with perversion to the max but you know when God calls and God calls and God calls and we just dilly dally and refuse the call eventually he'll give us over to a reprobate mind it surely appears that something like that has happened he says here is a people who say that they are of God and know God and have his Holy Spirit and yet they are naked and blind and don't know it so it's amazing the way he says this here because he's not talking about rank sinners in the world he's talking about people who believe their Holy Ghost filled people he says they are already deceived they have the wrong Spirit the elect cannot be deceived but it is evident that these others are these are they who have become blind because they refuse the word of God these are they who have stripped themselves naked by leaving God's care and protection and sought to build their own way of salvation their own Tower of Babel by organization and we know that Nimrod he built that Tower of Babel the idea behind that was to actually be able to survive another flood in case God decided to destroy the world they could just crawl up the top and go to heaven and they would be safe but it's beautiful how he talks about it here about that Tower of Babel by religion we can we can have a denomination of one remember brother Ken preaching that we we can have our own convictions my convictions a and have my own denomination by having my own convictions a and nobody who is a Believer is going to do that anyone who is a Believer is just going to completely surrender to the word my oh how lovely and beautifully dressed they appear in their own eyes as they formed their General assemblies and their counsels Etc but now God is stripping it all away and they are naked for these organizations have but led them into the camp of the Antichrist into the field of tears right up to the binding and burning objects of pity indeed they are yes pity them warn them beseech them and still they go their way headlong to destruction wrathfully turning away any and all attempts to save them as brands from the burning miserable indeed they are and yet not know it callous and Beyond hope they glory in what is actually their shame defiant against the word yet one day they shall be judged by it and pay the price of its awful indictments the final Council of the ages when I got into this I just thought that's such a powerful statement isn't it the final Council of the ages all of the seven Church ages here's here's the sum of it this is the final counsel take it or leave it my Revelations 318-19 I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isav that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent it's so beautiful because first he pronounces the judgment to this church but then he brings the actual remedy I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire it's a beautiful thing brother brandham talks about it we're getting into it here the councel of God is tur it is to the point he directs this last day Church to one hope that hope is himself he says come to me and buy it is evident from this phase phrase bu of me that the leodan church is not at all dealing with Jesus for the spiritual products of the kingdom of God their transaction transactions cannot be spiritual they may think that they are spiritual but how can they be the works in their midst are definitely not as Paul would say in Philippians 213 for it is God which worketh in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure thus what about all these churches schools hospitals missionary Ventures Etc God is not in them as long as they are denominational seed and spirit and not the seed and spirit of God wow buy of me gold tried in the fire that you may be rich now these people had plenty of gold but it was the wrong kind I say brothers and sisters let us not be grinding to get that kind of gold don't let it be the wrong kind of gold brother Bram he says it was that gold that brought men's lives and destroyed them it was the gold that warped and twisted human character for its love was the root of all evil it's a treacherous thing now we have a a good scripture here Revelations 18 1-14 and after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lighted with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen and has become a h the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul owl spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are waxed Rich through the abundance of her Delicacies and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues for her sins have reached unto heaven and God hath remembered her iniquities reward her even as she rewarded you and double unto her double according to her works in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double how much she hath glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart I sit as a queen and am no Widow and shall see no sorrow therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her and the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and live deliciously with her shall bewail her and lament for her when they shall see the the smoke of her burning standing AAR off for the fear of her torment saying alas alas that great City Babylon that Mighty City for in one hour is thy judgment come and the merchants of the Earth shall weep and mourn over her for no man buyeth her merchandise anymore the merchandise of gold and silver and precious stones and of pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and Scarlet and all thine wood and all manner of vessels of Ivory and all manner of vessels of most precious wood and of brass and iron and marble and cinnamon and odors and ointments and frankincense and wine and oil and fine flour wheat and beasts and sheep and horses and chariots and slaves and Souls of men and the fruits that thy Soul lusted after are departed from thee and all these things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee and thou shalt find them no more at all I think it says it all but all of this world is going to disappear all of the world in which we know all in the world of the world that this church knows will be totally changing brother bam says this is exactly the organized churches of the last day not just the Roman Catholic church every single church that's not a part of this ministry not my Ministry the ministry of the Holy Ghost under the message of the hour every single other Church pays homage to Rome whether directly or indirectly they fit that description this is exactly the organized Church churches of the last day for it says in verse 4 come out of her my people the Rapture has not yet taken place so if you look at this scripture and you see all of this happening I can't help but think here we have the prophet of God saying there's something really significant that's going to take place and the Rapture hasn't gone yet but we have an instruction to come out of her my people the bride is not yet gone when these terrible conditions in this Rich false Church exist but there is a gold of God so beautiful 1 Peter 1:7 says that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth remember the devil is coming after our faith he he he really likes to upset us in all the other areas but really he just wants to steal our faith he wants to get us at a place where we say there's no God God's not even listening does he even care that's what he wants to do if he can get us to that place he's got us but we'll never be able to lose our faith just just like job we'll find ourselves potentially on the Heap of an of of our sacrifice and we won't move we'll say that sacrifice is still there as long as I can see that sacrifice I know that I am justified and what's our sacrifice today brothers and sisters it's not a church it's not an association it's not our family it's not tenure there none of that our sacrifice is Jesus Christ and when we can say that we've met him personally he is our sacrifice it doesn't matter how hard the devil tries to shake us he'll never touch our faith the trial of your faith is much more precious than that of gold that perisheth I just wonder you know I I look back to when I had a business and and how caught up in the business I got brothers and sisters I never want to take for granted what it means to be in a in a position where I'm not working full-time at a job I remember what it's like to be caught up trying to actually capture that gold but you know one day we'll look back on our lives and think maybe why did I get so fussed in that situation or why did I get so upset over that and it's over the money it's trying to survive it's human nature but we have the encouragement to remember remember that our faith is the most important Paramount thing that we can ever have on this earth and the faith that we're talking about brothers and sisters is not something we're taught in Sunday school it's not something we're taught from the pulpit it's the faith of Jesus Christ that comes inside of us it's not our faith it's the Faith of Christ not the faith in Christ We Believe In Christ many people have faith in Christ it's the Faith of Christ Living out through US brother bam goes on to say the gold of God is a Christlike character produced in the fiery furnace of a flowery bed of ease no no that Christlike character is produced in the fiery furnace of Affliction he says that's the right kind of gold if we're getting Trials of our faith brothers and sisters he's working out the character that he wants to see in our lives we're not going to get that kind of character without a trial but what kind of gold does the church have today it has but the worldly gold that will perish it's Rich it's complacent it has made affluence the major Criterion of spirituality God's blessing me I've got my my money rolling in so hey God's blessing in me that's not necessarily God's blessing the evidence of God's blessing and the correctness of Doctrine Etc is now based upon how rich how many Rich folks are involved in it you had better become you had better come before it's too late saeth the Lord and buy of me gold tried in the fire and then you will be truly Rich he says this are we getting it listen to me naked physically we came into the world but naked spiritually we will not leave it I think that we should read this again brothers and sisters maybe when you go home read this part again remember even though we come in naked we're not going out naked we're going out with a token in our lives he says oh no we are going to take something with us what that something is is all we can take with us nothing less and nothing more so brothers and sisters remember the key to seeing whether you're actually doing right in the sight of the Lord are you growing spiritually are we growing spiritually he's interested in spiritual growth maybe character development there's maybe a few different ways you could say it I I would say it this way the life of the Holy Ghost living out through us there's many different ways we could describe it brother Adam he says so we had better be real careful now to see that we take something that will make us right before God so then what will we take with us we take our character brother that's what we take with us and we've all heard it said before probably you never see a U-Haul behind a hearse in a funeral procession full of people's furniture and money and special things that they worked so hard and fought so miserably to get in their lives that doesn't go with them it all just gets given away it all becomes other people's things that's the way of the world the only thing that we're going to take with us is our character and remember death doesn't change our character we don't become a different person because we die we're the same person all we do is breathe out in this Dimension and breathe in in that Dimension and there's two different versions of it one is fiery flames of torment and the other one is in Paradise it's one or the other there's nothing in between and who we are here is who is going to be there and I think about myself brothers and sisters many times and I think Lord I've got a long ways to go please have mercy on me today I I I I I I I think I got a lot of character developing to happen in my life but amen let it happen that's what we if it's what we need then we want it right he goes on to say now what kind of character will take will you take with you will it be like his whose character was molded by suffering in the fiery furnace of Affliction or will it be in the softness of this characterless leodan people oh my when it starts getting tough I run when it starts getting hard I repel back I withdraw I I oh I can't take it when it starts getting difficult no that's not the life of a Believer that's not the the faith of God inside the believer that's the leoan people it's up to each one of us for in that day every man will bear his own burden now I say that the city of leoda was a wealthy City it minted gold coins with inscriptions on both sides gold coins characterize the age a flourishing Commerce existed because of it today the two-headed gold coin is with us we buy it ourselves out and we buy ourselves in in the church we attempt to accomplish the same we buy ourselves out of sin and buy ourselves into heaven or so we say but God does not say that the church owns such phenomenal wealth that at any given time she can take over the entire world's system of Commerce can you imagine that that's a lot of money and indeed a leader in the world Council of churches has openly prophesied that the church in the foreseeable future should could and will do just that but their golden Tower of Babel shall fall only the gold tried in the fight shall endure the gold that's tried in the fire is Christ's character living out through the believer that's the character that's the gold brothers and sisters the fruit of the spirit and that is what the church has constantly done Through the Ages she's left the word of God taken her own Creeds and dogmas she has organized and joined herself to the world thus she is naked and God is judging her loudness the only way she can get out of this dread situation is by obeying the Lord to come back to his word of Revelations 184 come out of her my people be ye not unequally yolked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness and what Concord hath Christ with bile or what part hath he that believeth with an Infidel and what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God as God hath said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people I think many times we take this scripture and we put it off into the Millennium I don't think it's just a millennium brothers and sisters he goes on to say wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the Lord touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you and I will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters sayith the Lord Almighty 2 Corinthians 6:14 to18 there is a price to pay for those garments and that is the price of separation and anoint thine eyes with I have that thou mightest see I just feel led to go back to that separation bit it's not going and associating with the world brothers and sisters my dad used to tell me all the time your friends will either build you up or break you down there's no middle ground and we all know the worldly description you know if you want to to dictate where you're going to be financially speaking just take your five closest people and add up their salaries and then do the the average of them and that's pretty much where you're going to be you are who your people are if you're associating with unbelievers you're draining yourself you got to guard yourself you want to make sure that you're actually associating with people who are going to be building you up and encouraging you sorry about that that was for free and anoint thine eyes with iav that thou mayest see he does not say that you have to buy this isav oh oh no there is no price tag on the Holy Spirit brothers and sisters if we ever need a dose of isav in this day it is today we need that isav now more than ever the devil is so subtle so cunning he's everywhere you look in the age in which we live Galatians 3:2 receive ye the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of faith I just love this I have this highlighted I've got it starred this next paragraph says it all brothers and sisters without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can never have your eyes open to a true spiritual revelation of the word period so what is it what else is there to talk about there's people that don't have the Holy Ghost we need to get the Holy Ghost as Believers in the age in which we live and if we've got the Holy Ghost just say Amen we don't want to get upset for those that need to get the Holy Ghost without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you will never have your eyes open to a true spiritual revelation of the word a man without the spirit is blind to God and His truth so powerful it's it's the most important thing brothers and sisters we can read the Bible we can read the message we can listen we can talk about it we can and fellowship around it but without Revelation by the spirit we're just like everyone else we have to have Revelation by the spirit God Opening Our Eyes to this word and not just this word but the word for our day so vital when I think of this isav opening people's eyes I can't help but recall when I was a little boy in Kentucky my brother and I slept in the Attic on a straw pallet the cracks in the house house would let the drafts blow through sometimes in the winter it would get so cold we would wake up in the morning with such colds in our eyes that our eyes would be shut tight with inflammation we would cry out to mother and up she would come with some hot grease and rub our eyes until the hardened matter was gone and then we could see you know there have been some awful cold drafts blowing on the church in this generation and I'm afraid her eyes have sort of frozen shut and she is blind to what God has for her she needs some hot oil of the spirit of God to open her eyes unless she receives the spirit of God she will go on substituting program for power and and Creed for word she counts numbers for success rather than to look for fruit the doctors of theology have shut the door to Faith and forbade all to enter the the days of Miracles has passed the apostolic age is over we know we could go on and on about it he says they never go in nor let anyone else go in if I can't get in then how could you possibly go further than me in my spiritual Revelation it's terrible their theology comes out of a textbook on psychology written by some unbeliever there is a textbook on psychology one we all need it is the Bible I love this part I love this part it is written by God and contains God's psychology not man's psychology not Psych ology from the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Brothers and Sisters it goes beyond our understanding and our own comprehension if we get the Holy Ghost in our lives he the spirit of truth will lead us and guide us into all truth he will Deliver Us from every single disease every single Affliction in our lives the book of psychology is going to teach us how to live it live with it we're going to understand what it's called we're going to understand what the attributes of it are and then we're going to learn how to actually maybe get some medic ation to live with it in a psychological aspect understand it who wants to do that what we want to do is be delivered by the Holy Ghost I just think it's so important I'm going to pause here for a second brothers and sisters God has a psychology I'm not saying that the understanding of psychology is wrong but if we're willing to substitute faith in God for worldly psychology according to the word that's going to be wrong that's going to ground out the power of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives brother brami says you don't need any doctor to explain it to you receive ye the Holy Spirit and let him do the explaining he wrote the book and he can tell you what's in it and what it means isn't that such a simple statement but so powerful and profound we don't need theologians to teach us we need Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so that our eyes can be open too 1 Corinthians 29-16 but as it is written I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yay the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God which things also we speak not in Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned so beautiful but he that is spiritual judgeth all all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ my I just think that scripture is so beautiful it's tremendous we have not re receive the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we may know the things that are freely given to us of God that we should understand what we're talking about here that we should understand the word of God we should understand what it means to truly get the baptism of the Holy Ghost now if all the things that the spirit is crying out against are true of this age we need someone to come on the scene as did John the Baptist and challenged the church as never before and that is exactly what is coming to our age and and we know we can say that is exactly what has come to our age that is history another John the Baptist is coming and has come and he will cry out exactly as did the first 4Runner get back in line with the word get back to the word but he will also go further with it and say I I'm not here to actually declare my Ministry what I'm here doing is just standing here when he comes I am here to declare not the first coming of the Lord Jesus Christ but to prepare the way for the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ my one crying in the wilderness we know that he will sorry another John the Baptist is coming and he will cry out exactly as did the first Forerunner we know that he will because of what the next verse says Revelations 319 as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent how is he going to rebuke and chasen there's going to be someone to actually speak the word this is the same message that John had as he cried out in the religious Wilderness of Pharisees Sadducees and Heathen repent there was no other course then there was no other course now there's no other way to get back to God then and there was no other way now it is repent period change your mind period turn around period repent for why will you die I just love that I I I wonder is that sort of how John was talking to the Sadducees and the Pharisees then and the heathens is that what he was saying just straight up let us examine the first phrase as many as I love in the Greek the emphasis is upon the what the personal pronoun it's beautiful hey back in 1965 the Vindicated prophet of God was using pronouns the correct ones the personal pronoun I he does not say that many would feel he should say as many as love me no sir we must never try to make Jesus the object of human love in this verse no it is the many that are the it is the many that are the loved ones of God it is his love in question not ours so once again we find ourselves gloring in his salvation his purpose and his plan and we are confirmed even more strongly in the truth of the doctrine of the sovereignty of God even as he said in Romans 9:13 Jacob have I loved does it now obtain that since he loved only the many is he therefore in a state of complacency awaiting the love of those who have not drawn nigh him by no means is this so for he declared also in Romans 9:13 Esau have I loved and in verse 11 the spirit boldly calls out for the children not being born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth that was a mouthful the last paragraph there in a nutshell I'll just say it this way he's not waiting for people to love him he's not waiting for people to love him to exude his love back because you love me I love you that's not at all what that verse says and that's what brother Bram was saying there he says this love is elective love it's his love for his elect and his love for them is apart from Human Merit there's nothing we could do to get us more or get us less isn't that wonderful there's nothing we could do to get more or less of his love apart from Human Merit for it says the purpose of God stands an election which is exactly opposite to the works or anything man has as in himself because before the children were born he had already said Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated and now he says to his own as many as I love I rebuke and chasen to rebuke is to reprove to reprove is to expose with a view of Correction chasen does not mean punish it means discipline because the subject's amendment is in mind we want to correct our children maybe they're riding a bike they're a toddler on a on a three-wheel or a tricycle and we want to correct them because they're going the wrong direction we're not going to push them off their tricycle we're simply going to grab a hold of them and try and steer them the right way with love they're are children we're not going to slap them off the tricycle and say you're going the wrong way but that's the way that devil sometimes tries to make us feel that God wants to do to us in our lives I think it's so beautiful that he would say it this way that's not what he wants to do Hebrews 125 to1 and ye have for and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if ye endure chastening God deal with you dealth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if you be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then ye are bastards and not sons that means you don't have a father that means you don't have a father that means he is not your father that's what that means and that is a terrible thing if you be without correction if you be without chastisement whereof all are partakers all of his children are partakers of Correction all of them then you are bastards and not Sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his Holiness now no chastening for this present seeth to be joyous but Grievious nevertheless afterward it yith the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby all call up the musicians as we close tonight the Peaceable fruit of righteousness brothers and sisters the character of Jesus Christ Living out through US Temperance meekness Faith goodness gentleness longsuffering peace joy and love the characteristics of Jesus Christ Living out through us us the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unfortunately it doesn't come without going through the The Valleys it doesn't come without going through great trials in our lives maybe stand with me as we close I just think it's a wonderful thing brothers and sisters no chastening for this present seeth to be joyous and it's not but Grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercise thereby that Peaceable fruit of righteousness is coming our way when we go through trials we're not going through trials to actually destroy us to wreck us to steal our faith to lose our faith we're going through trials to actually allow us to grow to mature to see his character come out in us I think it's just a beautiful thing we want to see that Peaceable fruit of righteousness God bless you tonight as we close let's just bow in prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for this word thank you for the words that were spoken tonight thank you for your unchanging ways Lord thank you that there's nothing that we could ever do to Merit your favor Lord Jesus the only thing we can do is just see it we can we can accept it we can understand that you have given it to us freely and you don't control us Lord but you desire us and your children will always come subject to your word and and what a promise what a what an amazing thing it is to know that all of your children are subject to being corrected in our directions all of us father who are your children will receive correction father we just ask tonight that Lord if there's anything in our lives that needs to be corrected that you would just search us and try us and father show us allow us Lord Jesus to be humble enough to say Lord correct me Lord change me help me father to line up with your desires with your word with your will Lord let me not continue going the way that will destroy me but allow me father to receive correction allow me Lord Jesus to see that Peaceable fruit of righteousness in my own life father we just love you tonight and we thank you for all that you do for us Lord every day that we have the ability to get out of bed and put our feet on the floor take breath in our lungs and open our eyes and move around is a gift from you and we thank you for that Lord we never want to take that for granted father who knows how many more days but you that we have here on Earth help us Lord Jesus to be about your business every day that we we are here father we just want to ask that you would keep your hand upon each one of us tonight as we go our separate ways Lord that you would pick up those who are maybe a little down in their Spirit tonight father if anybody is confused we pray that you would just Comfort them Lord take away the confusion father if anyone is upset Lord we pray that you would bring peace to their life if anybody needs healing in their bodies or their minds father you're more than able and we just ask that you would touch them in the name of Jesus father we just ask Lord If It Be Your Will for us to gather again on Sunday that you would allow us to come one more time and gather together in your name father that we could bring our very best unto you once again on this side of Eternity Lord we just commit each life and each household into your hands For Your Glory now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen amen can we
