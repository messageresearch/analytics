[44:22] father that is not just the song we are
[44:26] singing because you have given us a
[44:28] prayer
[44:30] but from the depth of our hearts
[44:34] that is the cry and the prayer of your
[44:37] children tonight
[44:39] Heavenly master
[44:41] how we pray Lord Jesus
[44:44] that you just have mercy on us five
[44:48] we need your father
[44:50] we need you more than anything else
[44:54] and it's only you who can give the

[44:59] our greatest desire is to be like you
[45:02] now may you help us father for the few
[45:05] moments we are going to be here Lord
[45:07] may we achieve that father through the
[45:10] preaching of your word
[45:12] loving master
[45:14] when we call to remember those who are
[45:17] going to a mouse they walked with thee
[45:19] Oh Lord
[45:20] but father just walking with thee it
[45:22] could not help it was until they invited
[45:26] you in their house and you broke the
[45:28] bread and their eyes were opened
[45:32] Heavenly Father it is my sincere and
[45:34] humble prayer it doesn't matter how long
[45:38] I have walked with you Lord
[45:40] but father I know tonight you can do
[45:43] something to open my eyes to have an
[45:46] experience that now I know Heavenly
[45:49] Father may you grant it unto us even as
[45:52] we go to read your word may you bless it
[45:54] father I commit myself in your hands
[45:57] just take me out of the way so that in
[45:59] your own way father you come admit the
[46:01] needs of your children through the
[46:03] preaching of your word heal the sick in
[46:06] our meetings father may you deliver
[46:08] those who are bound we'll look unto this
[46:10] moment as we commit all things now in
[46:12] your hands for it's in Jesus Christ's
[46:14] name we pray
[46:17] thank you musicians thank you let's turn
[46:19] to our Bibles
[46:26] look
[46:27] chapter 18 verse 8.
[46:31] and the Philippians chapter 2 verse 5.
[46:54] if you are there you can say Amen don't
[46:57] care
[46:58] Luke 18 verse 8.
[47:02] I tell you that he will avenge them
[47:05] speedily nevertheless when the son of
[47:08] man cometh shall he find faith on the
[47:11] Earth
[47:14] then Philippians 2 5.
[47:22] let this mind be in you
[47:25] which was also in Christ Jesus
[47:29] may God bless the reading of the word
[47:31] you can have your seeds
[47:38] God bless you Saints
[47:41] pray
[47:42] and preach with me
[47:46] oh my the last time we were here
[47:50] we started our subject and I said
[47:52] anytime I will stand here
[47:54] it will just be continuation of the same
[47:57] and the pastor has been dealing on the
[47:59] same
[48:00] so we are just in line
[48:04] so tonight I just want to take it a
[48:07] little bit further from where we left
[48:09] but for the sake of those who are not
[48:11] with us I'll just try to go back a
[48:13] little bit so that they know where we
[48:16] were then we start from there
[48:19] now our subject was about the Covenant
[48:21] and we said God whenever he makes a
[48:25] covenant with man man fails
[48:28] so if you remain a man there is no way
[48:30] God will make a covenant with you
[48:34] so God can only make a covenant with God
[48:38] and we established with quotes that when
[48:41] God made our covenant with Adam Adam
[48:43] failed
[48:45] when he met a covenant with Noah Noah
[48:47] failed so he had to make a covenant with
[48:51] the apron
[48:52] but before he could make a covenant with
[48:54] Abram he had to change his name from
[48:57] Abram to Abraham
[48:59] so he took part of his name and joined
[49:03] it to apram to make it Abraham
[49:06] so in that case now God was making a
[49:09] covenant with God
[49:11] and that is now an eternal Covenant that
[49:13] cannot fail
[49:18] now
[49:22] tonight
[49:27] I want to say this a covenant is
[49:30] annulled without the token
[49:35] the Covenant has no effect without the
[49:38] token
[49:43] the pastor has been saying You must
[49:45] receive the Holy Ghost and I'm saying
[49:47] without the token the Covenant is
[49:50] announced forget about the Covenant
[49:56] may God help us
[49:58] now
[50:02] you can only shout your issues with the
[50:05] message of your day
[50:08] and the message under the messenger are
[50:10] one
[50:14] and then since the message is the word
[50:17] then the messenger become the word to
[50:20] the people
[50:22] I wonder how many people can you say I
[50:24] can say Amen to that
[50:26] the messenger becomes the word to the
[50:29] people
[50:32] that's right
[50:35] oh my God help us
[50:39] now what is a token
[50:42] a token is a sign that your faith has
[50:47] been accepted
[50:51] I will repeat it
[50:52] a token is a sign that your faith has
[50:57] been accepted
[50:59] now what is faith
[51:05] we have been talking we have been
[51:06] talking about I and my father are one
[51:10] can claim that I and my father are one
[51:15] anybody can make a claim that I and my
[51:19] father are one
[51:20] but now we want to see tonight how to
[51:23] achieve I and my father are one
[51:28] if we can see how to achieve it
[51:32] then you can stand and say I and my
[51:36] father are one
[51:38] now
[51:40] for you to say I and my father are one
[51:44] that statement is a statement of
[51:48] identification
[51:51] you are identifying yourself with
[51:56] you can say I am of the family of
[51:59] Johnson's
[52:01] you are identifying yourself with the
[52:04] Johnsons
[52:05] and there are some characters you can
[52:08] identify yourself with the Johnsons or
[52:11] else forget about it
[52:18] hello
[52:20] help me to preach
[52:25] you cannot just say I am
[52:27] say I and my father are one
[52:31] Thief can say and my father are one
[52:34] but for you to say I and my father are
[52:37] the one then you are character must be
[52:40] reflected in the character of your
[52:42] father
[52:47] may God help us
[52:54] oh my
[52:57] foreign
[53:08] okay
[53:09] now
[53:12] the prophet says in the message unbelief
[53:14] does not hinder God
[53:17] paragraph 37 the prophet says in the
[53:21] last days it takes it is going to take
[53:25] what is going to take to stand in is a
[53:29] scriptural trained Church
[53:33] I'll repeat it
[53:35] what is going to stand is as
[53:39] scripturally trained Church
[53:46] you are you have been trained on the
[53:50] scriptures
[53:53] you can identify your life with the
[53:57] scriptures
[53:58] you can say I am the Fulfillment of this
[54:02] scripture
[54:04] that is the only way you can come to a
[54:07] point where you can say I and my father
[54:10] are one
[54:13] why the father is the scripture
[54:16] the father is the word
[54:19] so you must become the word and once you
[54:22] become the word then you can say I and
[54:25] my father are one
[54:28] and until you become a working scripture
[54:33] until you become a living scripture
[54:37] then how can you say I and my father are
[54:40] one
[54:42] God help us
[54:48] okay
[54:50] in the same
[54:52] message the prophet says we realize that
[54:54] we are in the in that day to where
[54:57] anything can look so real
[54:59] but yet it is of the scripture
[55:05] that anything can look so real but is of
[55:08] the scripture then the prophet says if
[55:11] it is like that leave it alone right
[55:15] if you have an experience
[55:18] and that experience is of the scripture
[55:21] leave it alone
[55:23] don't even talk about it
[55:26] we want scriptural trained people
[55:34] you can point yourself to the scripture
[55:37] and say I am the Fulfillment of this
[55:45] no matter what kind of sensation what
[55:48] the results you find out of it if it is
[55:52] in scripture stay away from it
[55:54] stay right with the word yeah well you
[55:58] say that you are getting the people
[56:00] unbelief no I am trying to catch them to
[56:04] Faith
[56:06] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the
[56:09] Creed no
[56:11] Faith cometh by hearing the word
[56:15] so as you hear the word as you hear the
[56:19] word then the word transforms you
[56:24] to become the one
[56:27] we are what we eat
[56:31] we are full of pieces hamburgers and
[56:36] so Spirit spiritually we are also what
[56:40] we eat
[56:42] if you are fitting on Sensations which
[56:45] are not based on the word then that's
[56:47] what you become
[56:53] in the message look the prophet says now
[56:56] listen real close to the to this remark
[56:59] Faith now don't forget to get this now
[57:02] Faith is designed to see what God wills
[57:08] and wants
[57:11] no yeah amen
[57:15] I'll repeat it because
[57:17] people didn't say Amen
[57:19] and I'm not forcing you to say Amen
[57:22] and I can't force you to say Amen but I
[57:25] will repeat this
[57:28] listen so close to this remark Faith now
[57:32] don't forget to get this now Faith is
[57:35] designed to see what God wills and what
[57:39] God wants there is no knowledge that can
[57:43] do that faith alone is designed and
[57:47] given to human race to find out what the
[57:50] will of God is
[57:52] and you take your faith that you got and
[57:55] it don't focus on the word then leave it
[57:59] alone
[57:59] you got the wrong faith
[58:06] then it takes me now to
[58:09] different the prophet says different
[58:12] levels of faith
[58:15] apparently yeah there is human faith
[58:20] and human faith it gives results
[58:25] how many believes that
[58:29] let's go to the scriptures
[58:33] oh my
[58:35] Luke chapter 5.
[58:57] Luke chapter 5.
[59:00] remember
[59:01] in Luke 18
[59:04] the scripture says when the son of man
[59:06] cometh shall he find faith
[59:10] but now let's look at this Luke 5 18.
[59:14] and behold many proteins are bad
[59:17] a man which was taken with the past and
[59:21] they sought means to bring him in and to
[59:24] lay him before him
[59:25] and when they could not find by what way
[59:29] they might bring him in because of the
[59:32] multitude they went upon the house top
[59:35] and led him down through the edge
[59:38] through the tiling
[59:40] with his coach into the meetings before
[59:43] Jesus and when he saw their faith he
[59:46] said unto him man thy sins are forgiven
[59:51] thee
[59:53] these are guys I call them they were
[59:55] crazy
[59:57] they were determined they wanted their
[1:00:00] man their person to get healed
[1:00:03] at all costs
[1:00:05] and because they could not access
[1:00:07] because since the people were so many
[1:00:09] they could not access him they decided
[1:00:11] to climb the roof that was faith
[1:00:15] they wanted their person to get healed
[1:00:20] I'll quote what brother maybe Noah say
[1:00:23] it is the faith
[1:00:26] it is your faith your faith can heal
[1:00:30] somebody
[1:00:33] so the scripture says Jesus saw their
[1:00:36] faith it was not even the faith of the
[1:00:38] sick person
[1:00:42] it was not the faith of the sick person
[1:00:45] but it was their faith and they were
[1:00:47] assault determined and these were not
[1:00:49] Believers of Jesus Christ they were not
[1:00:51] even followers
[1:00:54] hello
[1:00:57] so they are Faith could help a sick
[1:01:01] person to be healed
[1:01:04] but today you are not followers of Jesus
[1:01:06] Christ
[1:01:07] hello
[1:01:09] so okay let me let me qualify my my
[1:01:13] statement the prophet says
[1:01:17] a Harold could come in the meeting
[1:01:21] yeah
[1:01:23] catch the faith and the get healed and
[1:01:26] somebody who is faithful are genuinely
[1:01:28] believer has been in that church for
[1:01:30] years they have prayed for years and
[1:01:32] years and they never get healed
[1:01:35] so this is an unbeliever just comes in
[1:01:39] the presence
[1:01:40] and thank you turns into the channel and
[1:01:45] receives what he or she wants
[1:01:51] so now
[1:01:55] it brings us to
[1:01:58] the prophet says
[1:02:00] faith in Jesus Christ and the faith of
[1:02:04] the son of man faith in the son of man
[1:02:07] and the faith of the son of man
[1:02:11] faith in the son of man it is your faith
[1:02:15] in who he is
[1:02:17] if you believe is a Healer you
[1:02:20] can you just tune yourself into the
[1:02:23] channel and you receive healing
[1:02:26] but now what we are talking about the
[1:02:29] faith of a believer
[1:02:31] the faith that Jesus Christ gives
[1:02:34] the faith of the son of man
[1:02:36] not the faith in the son of man the
[1:02:39] faith is the son of man we have seen
[1:02:40] those guys because they had faith in him
[1:02:43] that once they get their person to him
[1:02:45] he will get healed
[1:02:47] and he got healed
[1:02:49] that was the faith in the son of man
[1:02:55] let me read the quotes I can see people
[1:02:57] are wondering what what is this man
[1:02:59] talking about
[1:03:01] let me support it with the quotes
[1:03:06] oh my
[1:03:18] okay
[1:03:30] okay in the exposition of the seven
[1:03:33] charge edges
[1:03:35] the prophet says like this
[1:03:39] in apps up still when Peter was asked
[1:03:42] how
[1:03:43] the mighty Miracle had taken place upon
[1:03:46] the crippled one at the gate beautiful
[1:03:48] he explained it on on this wise and he's
[1:03:53] that is Jesus name through faith in his
[1:03:56] in his Jesus name hath made this man
[1:04:00] former strong yeah the faith
[1:04:04] which is by from him Jesus has given him
[1:04:08] the man these perfect soundness in the
[1:04:11] presence of you all see there it is
[1:04:13] Jesus name and Jesus Faith brought about
[1:04:16] the miracle Peter did not claim it was
[1:04:20] his own human Faith any more than he
[1:04:24] claimed that it was his his own name he
[1:04:27] said that Jesus name used in the faith
[1:04:30] which is from Jesus performed that great
[1:04:33] work this faith is what the Lord was
[1:04:36] speaking about in Revelation 2 13. it
[1:04:40] was his faith it was not faith in him
[1:04:44] but it was his own faith that he had
[1:04:48] given to the Believers his own faith
[1:04:51] that he had given to the Believers
[1:04:54] so first qualification you must be a
[1:04:57] believer
[1:05:00] so once you are a Believer then he gives
[1:05:03] you that faith
[1:05:05] so once you have that Faith then now you
[1:05:08] can exercise it
[1:05:09] why because you know his will
[1:05:15] Jesus Christ said the son can do nothing
[1:05:19] accept what he sees the father
[1:05:23] what the father shows him then that that
[1:05:26] is what he will do if the father has not
[1:05:29] shown him
[1:05:31] then there is nothing he can do
[1:05:34] can we also come to that level whereby
[1:05:37] you can say you are led by the father
[1:05:39] you are led by the spirit of the father
[1:05:43] there is nothing I can do my hands are
[1:05:45] tight I'm waiting until God shows me
[1:05:48] until my father shows me how to do it
[1:05:51] that's what he wants
[1:05:54] you know his will
[1:05:56] you are not just you are not you are not
[1:05:58] just pretending or guessing no there is
[1:06:01] no casework
[1:06:04] God help us
[1:06:08] now at that point let me say this last
[1:06:11] time we said we talked about
[1:06:13] Dr David Livingstone
[1:06:16] when he went to Africa
[1:06:18] and he met with the Africa with the
[1:06:20] chief
[1:06:21] then they met a covenant
[1:06:24] they exchanged
[1:06:26] the tokens
[1:06:28] now at the point of exchanging the
[1:06:31] tokens
[1:06:33] let me try to traumatize the way my
[1:06:36] brother
[1:06:37] topi was doing it
[1:06:39] let's put sister Hut here
[1:06:42] the African Chief here and Dr
[1:06:45] Livingstone or brother pranaham here
[1:06:47] there are three people
[1:06:49] now the when Dr David Livingstone asked
[1:06:53] the chief what do you want
[1:06:55] he said I want that white coat
[1:06:59] which represents he was a doctor so the
[1:07:02] white coat is identified by doctors
[1:07:05] so the chief said I want that gift of
[1:07:08] healing
[1:07:10] now here stands sister hearty
[1:07:16] the spirit of the Lord comes to the
[1:07:18] prophet and says ask what you wait what
[1:07:20] do you want right now
[1:07:23] she had a sick sister
[1:07:25] they had prayed for her
[1:07:27] for many years
[1:07:30] so that was one need
[1:07:33] the other need she was poor and when the
[1:07:36] prophet said she was poor with me she
[1:07:37] was poor
[1:07:40] yeah
[1:07:41] she could have asked for one million
[1:07:44] dollars
[1:07:47] but he or she is
[1:07:49] when she was asked ask what you will
[1:07:53] she said salvation of my voice
[1:08:02] I I don't know
[1:08:06] one
[1:08:08] she was in the channel of the third pool
[1:08:11] she was in the channel of the ministry
[1:08:14] of the tadpole and the ministry of the
[1:08:17] 30 pool is focused on the soul
[1:08:24] but the African chief he was interested
[1:08:28] in the second and the first under the
[1:08:30] second pool
[1:08:33] so now
[1:08:35] you put yourself there in that scenario
[1:08:39] our pastor was praying for the needs he
[1:08:41] said
[1:08:41] okay if you have a need what did you ask
[1:08:44] for
[1:08:50] did you ask what sister had asked for
[1:08:56] we say we are in the ministry of the
[1:08:58] third poor
[1:09:01] sister Hattie no wonder the prophet said
[1:09:04] she asked for the right thing
[1:09:08] she was in the right Channel
[1:09:11] she could have asked for healing
[1:09:14] she could have asked for money
[1:09:17] she was poor
[1:09:19] but she didn't go for the money
[1:09:22] she was in the ministry of the 30 pool
[1:09:25] and the ministry of the 30 pool that is
[1:09:28] now the message of the hour
[1:09:31] the message of the hour is the ministry
[1:09:34] of the third pool
[1:09:35] so until we get into that channel where
[1:09:39] the ministry of the 30 pool can Now
[1:09:41] operate in us then there is no way we
[1:09:44] can say I and my father are one
[1:09:48] God have mercy on me
[1:09:55] so that's why when the prophet says the
[1:09:58] faith in the Son of God and the faith of
[1:10:02] the Son of God those are two different
[1:10:03] faiths
[1:10:06] those are two different faiths
[1:10:08] faith in the son
[1:10:10] depending on what you want
[1:10:13] I like the way the pastor puts it it's
[1:10:15] not a vending machine you just then it
[1:10:18] comes no if you take him as a vending
[1:10:21] machine then you can do it that way
[1:10:23] depending on how you take how you
[1:10:25] believe in him but now the faith of the
[1:10:29] son of the son of man
[1:10:31] his own faith when it is operating in
[1:10:34] you then you are under the ministry of
[1:10:37] the third poor
[1:10:40] when it comes when it comes to asking
[1:10:43] you ask for the right thing
[1:10:47] why because you are you are you are in
[1:10:50] the same channel
[1:10:52] with the father
[1:10:53] you are in the same channel with the
[1:10:56] father there is nothing you can do
[1:10:58] outside his will
[1:11:09] God help us
[1:11:13] now
[1:11:17] Luke 18 where are we read when the son
[1:11:21] of man cometh shall he find faith
[1:11:25] now we have seen those guys they had
[1:11:28] faith
[1:11:30] there are many quotations we can we can
[1:11:32] read about those who had faith
[1:11:35] but Jesus Christ was not impressed by
[1:11:38] that
[1:11:39] he comes to verse 8 and says when the
[1:11:42] son of man cometh shall he find faith
[1:11:47] now what is this faith
[1:11:50] we had those guys they had faith and the
[1:11:53] scripture says he saw their faith
[1:11:58] hello
[1:12:00] am I taking you out of the faith
[1:12:03] no
[1:12:06] we need to raise to another level
[1:12:09] where we can operate under the ministry
[1:12:12] of the third pool
[1:12:16] God help us
[1:12:20] are we following
[1:12:22] when the son of man coming
[1:12:25] shall he find faith
[1:12:27] now here we have different situations
[1:12:31] where people exercise to their faith
[1:12:35] and it worked in fact at one point Jesus
[1:12:38] Christ said I have never seen such a
[1:12:40] kind of faith
[1:12:42] he was he was testified testifying about
[1:12:45] it
[1:12:46] but then he comes here and says when the
[1:12:48] son of man cometh shall he find faith
[1:12:53] hello
[1:12:56] we are coming closer home now
[1:13:00] what God expects from us
[1:13:04] as his children
[1:13:08] okay
[1:13:09] in the message unveiling of God
[1:13:13] I didn't have time to pick those
[1:13:15] drawings of brother mavin
[1:13:18] but I hope this will explain
[1:13:22] in the message unveiling of God
[1:13:24] paragraph 370. how many sees him
[1:13:27] standing the mighty conqueror the word
[1:13:30] made flesh and veined before us the
[1:13:32] Alpha and the omeka he that was which is
[1:13:36] and shall come the root Under The
[1:13:39] Offspring of David was the son of man
[1:13:42] the Son of God the son of man and the
[1:13:46] son of David
[1:13:49] first he came as the son of man
[1:13:55] then
[1:13:56] throughout the church seven Church ages
[1:13:58] he changed into the ministry of the son
[1:14:01] of God
[1:14:04] but before he comes as the son of David
[1:14:08] in between here he has to come as the
[1:14:11] son of man
[1:14:18] hello
[1:14:20] he has to come as the son of man
[1:14:24] so when he was saying when the man when
[1:14:27] the son of man cometh shall he find
[1:14:29] faith
[1:14:33] so now we can say the son of man has
[1:14:36] come
[1:14:37] now if he has come has he found faith
[1:14:47] now which faith
[1:14:50] of the first and the second pool
[1:14:53] people enjoy that
[1:14:55] and it's good
[1:14:57] we love it
[1:14:59] but we are talking about the third pool
[1:15:04] now what is the third pool
[1:15:10] God help us
[1:15:13] oh my
[1:15:20] let's go to Saint John
[1:15:24] chapter six
[1:15:53] okay let's go Mass 51
[1:15:57] okay let's start from verse 48. to give
[1:16:00] it
[1:16:02] Clarity I am that bread of life your
[1:16:06] fathers did eat Manna in the wilderness
[1:16:08] and are dead this is the bread which
[1:16:11] cometh down from heaven that a man may
[1:16:14] eat thereof and not die I am the living
[1:16:17] bread which came down from heaven If any
[1:16:20] man eat of this bread he shall live
[1:16:23] forever and the bread that I will give
[1:16:25] is my flesh which I will give for the
[1:16:29] life of the world the Jews therefore
[1:16:32] stroke among themselves saying how can
[1:16:35] this man give us his flesh to eat
[1:16:41] but when he was doing the Miracles when
[1:16:43] they needed food he multiplied bread
[1:16:45] they had no problem with that
[1:16:48] where they needed healing he provided
[1:16:51] healing he they brought people from all
[1:16:54] over for healing
[1:16:56] but now when he changed the ministry
[1:17:00] and said unless you eat my
[1:17:04] flesh
[1:17:05] and rig my blood he have no life
[1:17:10] and he did not explain it
[1:17:15] is who can tell us how he explained it
[1:17:18] he did not explain it it was already
[1:17:20] poor who came later on and explained it
[1:17:25] so at that time we can say it was a
[1:17:27] mystery
[1:17:30] so many of them got offended because of
[1:17:34] the mystery
[1:17:36] but what happened to Peter then
[1:17:40] heater okay many left him they remained
[1:17:44] 70.
[1:17:46] maybe these were ministers
[1:17:50] I they said no this is too much they
[1:17:52] also walked away then they remained 12.
[1:17:55] he turned to them he met it even harder
[1:17:59] leave her alone nowadays you preach a
[1:18:02] social gospel at least for to keep
[1:18:04] people in the church not Jesus Christ
[1:18:08] when that time came he turned now to the
[1:18:11] 12th and he said do you also want to go
[1:18:18] then Peter said
[1:18:21] even if we don't understand but where
[1:18:23] else can we go
[1:18:26] to whom else can we go when thou alone
[1:18:28] has the words of life
[1:18:31] then he see
[1:18:33] it harder I know
[1:18:35] of 12 and one of you is a devil
[1:18:42] so that now people can cite their hearts
[1:18:50] God help us
[1:18:53] so faith without
[1:18:55] continuity is not a Godly faith
[1:19:00] they had faith when he was doing the
[1:19:02] healing
[1:19:03] they had faith when he was providing
[1:19:06] them with food
[1:19:07] but when the ministry changed
[1:19:11] we are coming closer Home when the
[1:19:14] ministry changed
[1:19:18] like when he said I and my father are
[1:19:21] one they picked the stones
[1:19:25] but these are people who are enjoying
[1:19:27] the gifts the Miracles they were
[1:19:30] rejoicing they were testifying about the
[1:19:32] Miracles oh I took my cousin there and
[1:19:35] he was healed I took my sister there and
[1:19:37] she was healed they were rejoicing
[1:19:41] but when the ministry changed
[1:19:49] then what happened
[1:19:51] those who remain
[1:19:53] are those who are seeds from the
[1:19:56] beginning
[1:20:02] they were seeds from the beginning
[1:20:09] when the rain comes
[1:20:12] it doesn't change the status
[1:20:17] it doesn't
[1:20:19] when the anointing comes it doesn't
[1:20:21] change the status
[1:20:24] the prophet says when the Revival comes
[1:20:27] it comes to revive what is inside
[1:20:30] now if what is inside is not the word
[1:20:33] what is going to be revived
[1:20:41] we need to wake up
[1:20:45] we need to come to a level where you can
[1:20:48] say I and the Christ are one or where
[1:20:51] you can say like Peter where else can I
[1:20:53] go
[1:20:58] but the people have become so I I don't
[1:21:01] know even how to put it they have to be
[1:21:03] peppered to come to church
[1:21:06] oh just come
[1:21:12] a time comes when you have to prove what
[1:21:15] is inside you
[1:21:18] brother Iman will say to when he was
[1:21:19] preaching here the children of Israel
[1:21:22] God
[1:21:24] tested them to know what was in their
[1:21:26] hearts
[1:21:27] and when he tested them he proved that
[1:21:31] inside them it was just a bunch of
[1:21:33] non-believers
[1:21:35] they rejoiced when there was a miracle
[1:21:39] when something when an issue comes they
[1:21:41] start complaining
[1:21:43] God help us
[1:21:45] so that we change from complaining
[1:21:47] people to our people who can Rejoice
[1:21:49] whether things are good or bad
[1:21:52] you don't go by situations
[1:21:58] God help us
[1:22:00] we need to mature
[1:22:06] I was telling somebody that we need to
[1:22:08] mature and come to a point even when you
[1:22:11] hear that brother Paul was talking about
[1:22:12] me you say God allowed him maybe he has
[1:22:15] seen something to correct me
[1:22:22] or if somebody calls me a black monkey I
[1:22:25] said maybe he has seen a character of a
[1:22:26] monkey in me
[1:22:30] that is somebody who is mature
[1:22:33] you take everything positively
[1:22:37] can we come to that level
[1:22:39] and can we say I and my father are one
[1:22:45] God help us
[1:22:47] we need to grow
[1:22:52] I don't have time oh my goodness
[1:22:55] I prepared so many
[1:22:57] yeah God help us we need to grow
[1:23:03] thank God
[1:23:05] I am working in progress
[1:23:08] and I can monitor
[1:23:10] I can look at my life and say at least
[1:23:13] at this point
[1:23:14] I know something is working on me
[1:23:17] something in me is changing right
[1:23:20] I can say oh yesterday some I could hear
[1:23:24] somebody talked about me then I could
[1:23:26] frown my face for the for the whole day
[1:23:28] but today I can rejoice
[1:23:31] and say I'll just pray for him
[1:23:35] kanui
[1:23:38] can you
[1:23:40] can we
[1:23:45] so we need to mature
[1:23:52] let me just what because I don't have
[1:23:54] time to read the prophet says
[1:23:56] we are supposed to be way up here
[1:24:02] but what is happening
[1:24:05] we are not allowing ourselves
[1:24:08] for the word of God to have preeminence
[1:24:11] in US
[1:24:16] or we don't stay long enough to receive
[1:24:20] a change
[1:24:26] how does the change come
[1:24:29] Faith cometh by hearing
[1:24:31] and hearing by the word
[1:24:34] how many times do you listen to the word
[1:24:41] God help us
[1:24:48] Saint John chapter 8.
[1:25:09] Saint John chapter 8 verse 30 as he
[1:25:12] spoke these words many believed on him
[1:25:15] were they believers
[1:25:18] please answer me what they believe us as
[1:25:21] he's back these words many believe it on
[1:25:24] him were they believers
[1:25:28] if they believed which means they were
[1:25:30] believers
[1:25:33] hello
[1:25:35] then let's go to the next verse verse
[1:25:37] that one then say Jesus to those Jews
[1:25:40] which believed on him
[1:25:42] were they believers
[1:25:43] they believed on him
[1:25:45] then he said if we continue in my word
[1:25:49] then I.E my disciples indeed
[1:25:52] if we continue
[1:25:55] don't stop
[1:25:57] don't stop at the first under the second
[1:26:00] pool
[1:26:01] go on until
[1:26:06] God help us
[1:26:08] oh my
[1:26:13] God help us
[1:26:15] so let's not stop at the first and the
[1:26:18] second pool
[1:26:20] let's go on
[1:26:21] until we get into the ministry of the
[1:26:24] third pool
[1:26:25] now what happens in the minister of the
[1:26:27] third pool the prophet says there is no
[1:26:29] impersonations
[1:26:31] the first pool
[1:26:33] they are kind of being impersonations
[1:26:34] the second pool there can be imba
[1:26:37] impersonations but when it comes to the
[1:26:39] third pool and that's why we read
[1:26:41] Philippians 2 5 where Paul says
[1:26:45] let this mind that was in Christ be in
[1:26:50] you now you have gotten the mind of
[1:26:53] Christ
[1:26:57] when you get the mind of Christ there is
[1:27:00] no impersonations there
[1:27:04] the other things like Sensations that
[1:27:06] devil can impersonate them
[1:27:08] but when it comes to the fatty pool
[1:27:12] the opening of the word
[1:27:15] then it becomes real to you you can say
[1:27:20] I can see my character now is the
[1:27:24] character of my father
[1:27:30] one time I think I preached here about
[1:27:32] the mirror and I said the mirror doesn't
[1:27:35] lie
[1:27:38] if you take a selfie you can Mo you can
[1:27:41] change it
[1:27:42] into whatever you want you want to
[1:27:44] achieve but the mirror tells you exactly
[1:27:46] who you are
[1:27:51] may God help us to stand before the
[1:27:53] mirror
[1:27:56] so that we know who we are
[1:28:01] questions and answers on the seals if
[1:28:04] you can understand it this is the third
[1:28:06] pool see you should have caught that the
[1:28:09] other day so so then just remember there
[1:28:13] will be no impersonations like there was
[1:28:16] no of the other two that is the first
[1:28:18] and the second there were some
[1:28:20] impersonations but when it comes to the
[1:28:22] 30 pool there is no impersonations
[1:28:30] oh my
[1:28:33] God help us
[1:28:44] oh yes God help us
[1:28:59] in the message the unpardonable scene
[1:29:03] paragraph 243 the prophet says and you
[1:29:07] all get the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:29:09] let's be on one big happy family let's
[1:29:13] be one big happy family then don't come
[1:29:17] in saying well I caught the Holocaust
[1:29:19] glory to God I am going to have gifts
[1:29:22] now just let the gifts alone they will
[1:29:25] take care of themselves see God when he
[1:29:29] sees he wants to use you for something
[1:29:31] he will tell you what to do and go to go
[1:29:36] do it don't seek gifts seek The Giver of
[1:29:40] the gifts
[1:29:42] when you have the giver then he will
[1:29:46] give you those gifts according to the
[1:29:48] situations
[1:29:55] oh my
[1:29:58] in the message the rapture
[1:30:01] when ajam comes into the um of the
[1:30:04] female it don't take all you didn't
[1:30:07] become a human jump from your father and
[1:30:11] and then the next thing you become a
[1:30:13] jump from a dog and the next thing from
[1:30:16] a cat and the next thing from a chicken
[1:30:18] it was all human Young
[1:30:21] and the body of Jesus Christ The Pride
[1:30:25] will be part of his body
[1:30:27] which will he was the word and the pride
[1:30:31] will have to be the word what added to
[1:30:35] word added to word Lord's justification
[1:30:38] Wesley sanctification pentecostal's
[1:30:41] baptism of the Holy Spirit restoration
[1:30:43] of the gifts and all the rest of it it
[1:30:46] goes with it it has got to be what on
[1:30:50] top of what jump on top of jump life on
[1:30:54] top of life to bring out the full
[1:30:57] stature of the pride of the Lord Jesus
[1:30:59] Christ now remember you was an attribute
[1:31:06] so how now do you achieve I and my
[1:31:09] father are one what on What
[1:31:13] what only what only what until you
[1:31:16] become the one
[1:31:19] why because he's the one
[1:31:21] so once you become the word
[1:31:24] you don't use any intellect of yours
[1:31:29] and the situation that comes you say
[1:31:31] let's see what the word says
[1:31:36] can we get that
[1:31:38] can we achieve it
[1:31:41] if we can allow what or what what on
[1:31:46] what you eat the what you eat the word
[1:31:50] until when you smile is the word
[1:31:54] even when you frown is the word
[1:31:57] God help us
[1:32:01] amen may God help us
[1:32:07] I'm just about to conclude
[1:32:09] so those who are praying that I finish
[1:32:14] I think God has answered your prayer
[1:32:20] amen
[1:32:21] God help us
[1:32:23] so now back to
[1:32:26] John 8. where he said those who believed
[1:32:30] on him
[1:32:31] as they had those who had this word they
[1:32:35] believed on him now we have established
[1:32:37] they believed on him
[1:32:39] but then he said if he continue
[1:32:43] so don't be stuck command
[1:32:46] move on
[1:32:48] continue coming continue listening don't
[1:32:51] give up don't be discouraged by anybody
[1:32:54] the pastor didn't call you
[1:32:59] oh this church I cannot go back
[1:33:02] the the pastor didn't call you
[1:33:04] if you are called by God then you can
[1:33:07] say where can I where else can I go
[1:33:13] and that's what we need
[1:33:15] you are so much tied to the word until
[1:33:19] nothing can move you
[1:33:24] the winds will come and go
[1:33:28] the clouds will come and go
[1:33:31] but you will remain standing
[1:33:34] why you are anchored
[1:33:38] your anger holds
[1:33:40] nothing can move you
[1:33:43] and that's what God is looking for today
[1:33:47] those who have uncut themselves so much
[1:33:49] to the word until they have become the
[1:33:53] word
[1:33:56] they talk nothing but the word
[1:33:59] can it happen
[1:34:04] so may God help us
[1:34:06] we like saying oh sister sisterhatti she
[1:34:10] had a different spirit
[1:34:14] she had a different spirit
[1:34:16] why we can say he was connected in the
[1:34:19] third pool
[1:34:21] because the ministry of the third pool
[1:34:23] is directed to the souls
[1:34:28] so if we want the ministry of the third
[1:34:30] pool
[1:34:31] then let's surrender ourselves to him
[1:34:36] so that he can work on me
[1:34:38] change me into what you want me to be
[1:34:44] then that will make us climb higher
[1:34:48] to wear all things are possible
[1:34:56] can it happen
[1:34:58] it can happen
[1:35:00] it can happen if you are a seed
[1:35:05] he saved you because you are seed
[1:35:08] but don't should change yourself
[1:35:11] there is a quarter you don't I don't
[1:35:12] have time to read it if you are a
[1:35:15] daughter or a son of God and you have
[1:35:17] been sealed inside
[1:35:21] there is nothing can temper you out
[1:35:24] you can shortchange yourself
[1:35:27] yeah you want to take a lesser thing
[1:35:30] but
[1:35:31] inside you if you are a seed
[1:35:35] remember he's coming for those who are
[1:35:38] his
[1:35:41] so they were his
[1:35:43] you are in him
[1:35:45] before the foundation of the world
[1:35:50] you are in him as a thought
[1:35:54] the only difference between you and
[1:35:56] Jesus Christ for him he came from the
[1:35:59] thought he came through theophany before
[1:36:01] he came to flesh but for you you skipped
[1:36:04] the theophany you came direct to the
[1:36:07] flesh
[1:36:08] but now you are being born by the Spoken
[1:36:13] Word by the theophany that you skipped
[1:36:16] so that now once you connected back to
[1:36:19] the theophany
[1:36:21] you can now see yourself and say you are
[1:36:24] co-equal with Jesus Christ
[1:36:29] Glory
[1:36:31] can somebody say like that
[1:36:35] he's still working on me
[1:36:38] yeah
[1:36:40] but time is fast spent
[1:36:43] the more we need to yield ourselves the
[1:36:46] better the faster we surrender ourselves
[1:36:48] the better
[1:36:51] if there is anything that is holding you
[1:36:53] you better leave it
[1:36:55] yeah
[1:36:56] and you can make a resolution
[1:37:00] maybe their musicians can come I am
[1:37:03] resolved
[1:37:06] I am resolved no longer to linga no no
[1:37:09] longer to be changed by the words the
[1:37:11] lights
[1:37:16] we can make resolutions
[1:37:19] I want something higher
[1:37:22] this genuine children of God are craving
[1:37:27] to cross over Jordan because their
[1:37:29] inheritance is across children
[1:37:34] so God help us
[1:37:37] let me press on
[1:37:39] let me forsake all that green does me
[1:37:42] anything that that causes distractions
[1:37:45] let me lay it aside I want to press on
[1:37:52] I am resolved
[1:37:58] I am resolved
[1:38:35] inside
[1:38:36] our friends
[1:38:38] [Music]
[1:39:08] hi
[1:39:10] there is
[1:39:13] [Music]
[1:39:24] [Music]
[1:39:44] [Music]
[1:40:04] thank you
[1:40:10] [Music]
[1:40:16] Hallelujah
[1:40:17] did you enjoy that tonight
[1:40:20] certainly enjoy the thought it's the
[1:40:24] resounding thought that I and my father
[1:40:26] are one it really has to come to that
[1:40:28] place and it's not an impossible thing
[1:40:30] Satan wants us to believe that's
[1:40:32] impossible and in this flesh truly it is
[1:40:35] but it's not our flesh it's our soul
[1:40:38] we heard that tonight you know I just
[1:40:40] had had it on my heart this week that
[1:40:43] God really is only interested in one
[1:40:46] thing
[1:40:47] one thing alone not not even so much the
[1:40:50] church and the attendance and our works
[1:40:53] as our brother spoke tonight he's
[1:40:55] interested in one thing in each one of
[1:40:56] our lives and that's spiritual growth
[1:40:59] and he will do every single thing he
[1:41:02] needs to do to see that happen in our
[1:41:04] lives
[1:41:06] and he will not compromise on that It's
[1:41:09] a Wonderful thought to think that that's
[1:41:11] that's truly the desire of a Believer is
[1:41:13] to see spiritual growth in our lives as
[1:41:16] our brother was preaching tonight
[1:41:17] talking about faith and you know first
[1:41:19] pull and second pull type of faith I
[1:41:21] just couldn't help but think you know
[1:41:23] there was one one time who wasn't yet
[1:41:26] converted but he was given the faith of
[1:41:30] the son of man
[1:41:33] and so he's given the faith in the son
[1:41:36] of man not the faith of the son of man
[1:41:38] and he Jesus on the boat he said come
[1:41:40] and walking towards them on the water
[1:41:42] said to them come on Peter walk out you
[1:41:46] can walk on the water he wasn't even yet
[1:41:48] converted and what happened
[1:41:51] he had the faith in the son of man and
[1:41:54] he stepped out of the boat and he walked
[1:41:55] on the water is what the word says
[1:41:58] but as soon as he realized he didn't
[1:42:00] have faith of the son of man he sank
[1:42:03] I just thought that was such a good
[1:42:05] thought you know uh
[1:42:08] I really enjoyed it tonight too
[1:42:11] I was thankful for the ministry and the
[1:42:12] body
[1:42:13] five-fold Ministry that's what it takes
[1:42:15] to perfect the Saints it's not just a
[1:42:18] one-man Ministry
[1:42:20] let's just go to him in prayer tonight
[1:42:21] as we close
[1:42:24] a gracious Heavenly Father we thank you
[1:42:26] for your goodness to us Lord
[1:42:29] what an honor and a privilege it is to
[1:42:31] recognize that we were in you before the
[1:42:33] foundation of the world
[1:42:35] and Lord you desire
[1:42:37] to see your word on our lips
[1:42:42] father you want to see your life being
[1:42:45] lived out through each and every one of
[1:42:46] us
[1:42:47] and we know that you will not compromise
[1:42:49] on that
[1:42:50] not one bit and father tonight I pray
[1:42:54] Lord just a special prayer of
[1:42:56] encouragement for each one of us Lord
[1:42:59] maybe we're not who we want to be
[1:43:02] but we know we're sure not who we used
[1:43:04] to be
[1:43:05] and as we go forwards from this service
[1:43:07] tonight Lord I pray that would be the
[1:43:09] desire and each one of our hearts Lord
[1:43:11] is to grow spiritually and not through
[1:43:15] an achievement but through submission
[1:43:18] through surrender through complete
[1:43:20] surrender unto you and to your word
[1:43:22] because we know that your your will is
[1:43:25] your word and we pray that your will
[1:43:27] would just manifest in each one of our
[1:43:29] Lives as we feed on your word we become
[1:43:31] your word faith is what we're after and
[1:43:35] we're not not our faith Lord but your
[1:43:36] faith we want to have your faith we want
[1:43:39] to see the end of our faith Lord
[1:43:41] and to see your faith live out through
[1:43:43] us tonight Lord we pray that you would
[1:43:46] bless brother Gilbert that you would
