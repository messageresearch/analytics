[20:31] open it tonight with a little just came
[20:33] across it in my my reading tonight. This
[20:35] is Psalms 28. Says, "The Lord is my
[20:38] strength and my shield. My heart trusted
[20:40] in him and I am helped. Therefore, my
[20:43] heart greatly
[20:45] rejoices and my song will be a praise to
[20:48] him." I think that's what we're here to
[20:50] do tonight. To give him glory, give him

[22:46] are. His throne tonight.

[33:22] tonight. Um, I'm not singing. Um,
[33:24] hopefully the organ will sing. Um, but
[33:27] it's a song, the blood will never lose
[33:28] its power. Just thinking about it today.
[33:31] Satan is the biggest liar and many times
[33:35] it comes to us and tells us that
[33:37] sometimes we've seen a way at day of
[33:39] grace or there is no way back or
[33:42] something like that but it's just a
[33:44] reminder that that blood has so much
[33:47] strength that regardless of what it will
[33:51] never lose its power. Amen. I pray you
[33:53] be blessed. Feel free to join and sing
[33:55] along.

[42:38] there is no one else like you. Oh, you
[42:45] are
[42:48] great. You do miracles.
[42:52] so
[42:54] great. There is no one else like
[43:01] you. Oh, there is
[43:06] no
[43:08] one
[43:09] else like you. You're so great. Oh, you

[43:20] miracles. so

[43:29] [Music]
[43:32] like there is no one else like
[43:38] you. You are
[43:43] great. You
[43:45] do so
[43:49] great. There is no one else like
[43:58] you. There is
[44:01] no
[44:03] one
[44:05] else like you.
[44:11] Don't you just love that
[44:13] song? So wonderful to sing it with
[44:15] revelation knowing that he's a person,
[44:18] not someone that came and died 2,000
[44:21] years ago, but he's alive and well right
[44:23] here
[44:24] tonight. Just have a couple of
[44:26] requests for prayer tonight for Sister
[44:29] Rose
[44:30] Sonnie, Sister Mary Carpenter's sister.
[44:35] She's taken a a step towards the Lord
[44:38] and
[44:39] uh the devil is none too happy about
[44:43] that. And
[44:45] uh she's had a life that's uh been
[44:48] well-lived but not with the Lord. And
[44:52] she's decided it's time to take up her
[44:55] cross and follow Jesus.
[44:59] And she has moved. She has changed her
[45:03] life. It's upside down right now. She's
[45:06] been dealing with anxiety,
[45:09] insomnia, all manner of
[45:11] afflictions because those devils just
[45:14] don't want to
[45:15] go. But she's decided that she wants to
[45:18] take a stand and she would like to get
[45:20] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And we
[45:22] all know how that
[45:24] happens. So, we're certainly happy for
[45:27] Sister Rose Sunonny tonight. We want to
[45:29] remember her in prayer. Brother Jerry
[45:31] Carpenter isn't feeling well in his
[45:32] body. We wanted to remember him as well.
[45:35] And if you have a need tonight, maybe
[45:37] just make it known unto him by way of an
[45:40] uplift hand. Let's just go to him in
[45:42] prayer. Gracious heavenly father, Lord,
[45:45] what an honor and a privilege it is to
[45:47] gather together in your name, Lord.
[45:48] Amen. Hallelujah. Father, many times we
[45:51] think it would be so amazing to meet
[45:54] with a president or a prime minister or
[45:58] someone famous, but Lord, we're able to
[46:01] gather together in your name and you're
[46:04] there in our presence, Lord Jesus, the
[46:06] creator of the universe. Yes. Oh,
[46:09] Father, the King of Kings, the one
[46:11] that's in control of President Trump,
[46:15] the one that's in control of Prime
[46:17] Minister Carney. Oh, the one that's in
[46:19] control of every single government and
[46:21] secret society in this world. Oh,
[46:26] Father, we're so thankful that you're
[46:28] here tonight. And Father, we acknowledge
[46:30] you and we recognize you and greet you
[46:33] with a kiss, Lord Jesus. Father, we
[46:35] anoint you with oil. Father, we're not
[46:38] calling upon you to have a show like the
[46:41] Pharisee, Lord. Oh, Father, we want you
[46:44] to speak to us tonight. Oh, Father,
[46:46] tonight we just ask that you would bless
[46:48] Sister Rose Sonnie in the name of Jesus.
[46:52] Father, Lord, we've already prayed. So,
[46:55] Lord, we just rejoice as a body now for
[46:58] her, Lord, that that peace that passes
[47:01] all understanding would come by her way,
[47:04] Father. that she would have sweet rest
[47:06] tonight when she lays her head on her
[47:08] pillow. And Father, that you would grant
[47:10] her the desire in her heart, Lord, that
[47:13] that Holy Spirit promise of truth, Lord.
[47:17] Oh, Father, we know that you're more
[47:18] than able. And we thank you for the
[47:20] desire in the hearts of your children.
[47:22] Father, we pray for Jerry Carpenter,
[47:24] Lord, our brother and friend. We pray
[47:26] that you would raise him up, Lord, that
[47:28] you would touch his body. Father, we're
[47:30] so thankful that we can bring our needs
[47:32] to you, Father. Father, we pray for each
[47:34] and every need that's made known unto
[47:36] you tonight by the way of an uplift
[47:38] hand. Father, I have one as well.
[47:40] Father, I thank you for touching Isaac,
[47:42] our son. Lord, he's been contending with
[47:45] illness in his body for over two weeks
[47:47] now, and today he feels well. We thank
[47:51] you for touching him, Lord. Thank you
[47:54] for your healing touch in every one of
[47:55] our lives. Lord, we wouldn't know you as
[47:57] our healer if we didn't get sick in
[47:59] these bodies. Father, we're so thankful
[48:02] that you've given us that, Lord, healing
[48:05] in these bodies to show us that you are
[48:07] able to heal us. And if you're able to
[48:09] heal us, you're able to save us because
[48:11] it was a dual covenant that you did when
[48:14] you came here, Father. And you
[48:16] manifested that scripture that we've
[48:17] been reading in Isaiah chapter 53. We
[48:20] know that there has to be a prophetic
[48:22] utterance. There has to be a literal
[48:24] manifestation of it. Oh, Father, and we
[48:27] know that that that is the the
[48:29] representation of your spirit was turned
[48:31] loose there at Calvary, Father, that we
[48:33] could meet with you tonight. Father, we
[48:36] just love you and we thank you and we
[48:37] commit each and every need that was made
[48:39] known unto you tonight by the way of an
[48:41] uplift hand. We know that you're more
[48:43] than able. Father, we pray for those who
[48:46] couldn't be here tonight. Wherever they
[48:47] are, Lord, whether they're streaming or
[48:49] away working or traveling, Father,
[48:52] you're not bound by time or space, and
[48:54] we commit them into your hands as well,
[48:56] Father. Lord Jesus, we just love you and
[48:59] we thank you so much, Father, for all
[49:01] that you do in our lives. Now, we just
[49:04] want to turn towards you, Father, and
[49:06] the word that you have for us in this
[49:08] day. And we just want to exalt that to
[49:11] be the highest portion of this this
[49:13] gathering Lord Jesus. Father,
[49:15] acknowledging that you are here in word
[49:19] form, Lord Jesus. But Lord, not just in
[49:22] print, but on the lips of your children.
[49:25] So, Father, we just invite you now to
[49:28] take your position, Lord, in the hearts
[49:31] of your children. And we'll be careful
[49:33] to give you all the praise. We love you.
[49:35] We thank you. We ask all these things
[49:37] now in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen.
[49:41] Amen. Thank you musicians. Thank you,
[49:44] brother Toby and brother Faren for the
[49:46] special once again. It just does
[49:49] something. If you have your Bibles, I
[49:51] want to continue talking about election
[49:52] tonight. I don't think we can get away
[49:54] from that anytime soon, but uh we'll
[49:57] just see what the Lord wants to do out
[49:59] of the second epistle of Peter, chapter
[50:02] 1. Second Peter, chapter 1.
[50:10] I was so
[50:12] uh so thrilled. I actually tuned into
[50:16] another minister and I heard him
[50:18] preaching from right here and uh it was
[50:22] just so encouraging. The Lord is good.
[50:25] Second Peter chapter 1, Simon Peter, a
[50:28] servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ.
[50:32] to them that have obtained like precious
[50:34] faith with us through the righteousness
[50:37] of God and our Savior Jesus
[50:40] Christ. Grace and peace be multiplied
[50:44] unto you through the knowledge of God
[50:47] and of Jesus our Lord.
[50:50] according as his divine power hath given
[50:52] unto us all things that pertain to life
[50:54] and
[50:55] godliness through the knowledge of him
[50:58] that hath called us to glory and virtue
[51:02] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[51:04] great and precious
[51:05] promises that by these ye might be
[51:08] partakers of the divine nature having
[51:11] escaped the corruption that is in the
[51:14] world through lust and beside this
[51:18] giving all diligence Add to your faith
[51:20] virtue, and to your virtue knowledge,
[51:23] and to knowledge temperance, and to
[51:25] temperance patience, and to patience
[51:27] godliness, and to godliness brotherly
[51:29] kindness, and to brotherly kindness
[51:33] charity. For if these things be in you
[51:37] and
[51:38] abound, they make you, you don't make
[51:42] them, they make you, that ye shall
[51:45] neither be barren, nor unfruitful in the
[51:48] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[51:52] But he that lackth these things is
[51:54] blind, and cannot see a far off, and
[51:57] hath forgotten that he was purged from
[52:00] his old sins.
[52:02] Wherefore the rather brethren, give
[52:06] diligence to make your calling and
[52:08] election
[52:09] sure. For if ye do these things, ye
[52:13] shall never fall. Amen. Let's just bow
[52:17] one more time. Heavenly Father, we just
[52:19] ask tonight that you would impart to us
[52:21] your knowledge, Father, that we would be
[52:24] able to seek out our own election and
[52:28] our own calling, Father, to be able to
[52:31] hear your voice for ourselves. And Lord,
[52:33] not just to hear it, but to follow it.
[52:35] And and me too, Father. Lord, every one
[52:39] of us, we need you. And we just want to
[52:41] ask that Lord tonight you would just
[52:43] impart words of truth to us one more
[52:46] time as we walk with you along the way.
[52:49] We just ask all these things in Jesus
[52:52] Christ's name we pray. Amen. God bless
[52:54] you tonight. You may be
[52:57] seated. God bless you, Brother John.
[52:59] Certainly good to see you here with us.
[53:02] The last time I saw Brother John, I was
[53:04] telling him in the parking lot we uh
[53:05] went up in CO and we went fishing. We
[53:08] drove for about 16 hours from here to go
[53:11] and meet him and his son and his
[53:13] daughter. And it was just a wonderful
[53:15] time of fellowship around a campfire and
[53:18] you know fishing. It doesn't get any
[53:21] better than that. And uh that was the
[53:23] first time that I actually saw I I
[53:25] thought that it could be the end really.
[53:28] It was at dusk. We were sitting by the
[53:30] campfire and the sky was still just a
[53:32] little bit light and the stars were
[53:34] starting to come out. But we saw this
[53:36] line, this string of stars going like
[53:39] this. It was just one after the other. I
[53:41] think we counted 17 of them. And uh we
[53:44] were able to determine afterwards that
[53:46] it was uh Elon Musk's satellites that
[53:49] were coming. But you know, they were
[53:50] coming out of the east, the northeast,
[53:53] and that's kind of the direction of
[53:55] Russia. And I just couldn't help but
[53:56] think, you know, one of these days. And
[53:59] in that moment to see something like
[54:00] that happening, you just have to think.
[54:02] The prophet of God said that not one of
[54:04] those bombs will go off, but the bride
[54:06] will go
[54:07] first. Not one bomb will burst, but the
[54:11] elected will leave. What a tremendous
[54:13] thing that that is to think about. But
[54:15] we we just had a wonderful time of
[54:17] fellowship and uh brother John is
[54:19] certainly a wonderful host and his
[54:21] family. We uh were treated like royalty
[54:23] and we're certainly thankful and
[54:24] hopefully one day we can return the
[54:26] favor. God bless you, brother. And uh
[54:30] just like to welcome Sister Epha back.
[54:32] Certainly wonderful to see you and uh we
[54:35] look forward to seeing you more over the
[54:37] summer. You happy tonight?
[54:40] Just wonderful to gather together in his
[54:42] name. And I'm going to read some out of
[54:44] the uh exposition of the seven church
[54:46] ages talking about election and uh
[54:49] really drawing from verse 10. Wherefore
[54:52] the rather brethren, this is second
[54:54] Peter chapter 1 verse 10. Wherefore the
[54:57] rather brethren give diligence. Be very
[54:59] careful. Make certain. Don't take it
[55:02] lightly. Be very, very diligent. In
[55:05] fact, be as diligent or more with our
[55:09] own salvation, our calling and election,
[55:13] we need to be so diligent with it, maybe
[55:15] even more diligent than we would be with
[55:18] our investments. Maybe more so than we
[55:20] would be with our jobs. Maybe more so
[55:23] than we would be with anything in our
[55:24] lives. Because if we do those things
[55:27] that we've read about, then we will not
[55:29] fall. And and that's the word of God.
[55:31] That's not our word. That's not a a
[55:33] pastor's word or an evangelist's word or
[55:35] even a prophet's word. That's the word
[55:38] of God. That's his word. I believe it's
[55:40] just a tremendous promise for us to be
[55:42] able to dial into that and think if
[55:45] we're able to do those things, then we
[55:48] will never fall. And being elected, I
[55:51] think that just resonates with the
[55:53] elected to never fall. Because when we
[55:56] are elected, you will never fall. If you
[56:00] can say amen to the word of God for our
[56:02] day and and say I'm elected, then you're
[56:06] never going to fall. Amen. We're going
[56:08] to fail in this flesh. This flesh will
[56:10] let us down so many times. Even our
[56:13] spirits will let us down so many times.
[56:16] But that's why brother Barry continually
[56:18] says we need to get the Holy Spirit
[56:20] because when we have the Holy Spirit in
[56:22] us then something else has the control
[56:24] tower of our lives. It has the control
[56:27] tower of our minds and most importantly
[56:29] it has the control tower of our mouths
[56:32] because we know it's not what we eat
[56:34] that defiles us. It's what comes out of
[56:36] us that defiles us. And you know
[56:38] sometimes uh our words can be bad. So
[56:42] anyways, we're talking about election
[56:44] taking it out of second Peter chapter uh
[56:48] 1 verse 10. And uh you know the question
[56:51] came up about uh election out of the
[56:54] exposition of the seven church ages and
[56:55] brother Bradomy talks about it and in
[56:57] the first one we we we we did this
[56:59] before we went away. We missed a
[57:02] Wednesday last Wednesday about this. Um
[57:05] but brother Brandham talks about in the
[57:07] exposition of the seven church ages and
[57:08] this is where the question arose. How
[57:11] can someone be lost and someone be
[57:14] saved? And that's just God's choice. How
[57:18] can that be? He's a God that loves
[57:20] everyone. He would that everyone would
[57:22] come onto repentance. But he created man
[57:25] to be a free agent, to have a free will.
[57:28] And for man to make a decision based on
[57:31] his own desire and his own spirit,
[57:34] whatever spirit's inside of there. And
[57:36] and that's why if we have the Holy
[57:37] Spirit, our our desire will always be to
[57:40] correct ourselves with this word of God.
[57:43] And if we don't have the Holy Spirit, we
[57:45] will want to correct ourselves according
[57:46] to our own knowledge. And we talked
[57:48] about it on Sunday, and I can't get away
[57:50] from the thought, you know, the the the
[57:52] word pride is just the exact same word
[57:55] as pride with one letter difference.
[57:57] Pride is the original sin. when we have
[58:00] too much pride in us. And I would say if
[58:03] we have a speck of pride in us, we have
[58:05] too much pride in us because we should
[58:07] have no pride in us as the bride because
[58:10] we're elected to be the bride. If we're
[58:13] the bride, we didn't just decide one
[58:15] day, hey, I'm I'm going to be the bride
[58:16] of Christ. That's not the way it works.
[58:19] He's a gentleman. He comes and
[58:22] introduces himself. He makes the
[58:24] introduction and then he invites us. He
[58:27] gives us the right hand of fellowship.
[58:29] He gives us the ability to accept the
[58:33] invitation. It's interesting because
[58:35] everybody has the invitation, but very,
[58:38] very few are able to accept it. The ones
[58:41] that accept it will accept it all the
[58:43] way according to his word. The others
[58:45] will say, "Well, I'll accept it, but
[58:47] only portions of it." Because, you know,
[58:49] that was a cultural thing for another
[58:50] day when they wrote this Bible. And you
[58:53] know, maybe the Bible's a little bit
[58:54] fallible and there's certain scriptures
[58:56] in there that just don't apply today.
[58:58] When we start to take pieces out of it,
[59:00] then we no longer have the pure word of
[59:03] God, which means we're lacking in his
[59:05] will. And and we will be lacking these
[59:08] things. The diligence that we're
[59:10] supposed to have will take us directly
[59:13] back to this word. The elected bride of
[59:15] Jesus Christ is such a special place to
[59:19] be. There oughtn't oughten to be one
[59:21] speck of pride in our lives. We we ought
[59:24] to be the most humble people ever that
[59:27] ever walk the face of the earth. We
[59:31] ought to be those people. And I say,
[59:32] "Lord, help me." Because there's times
[59:34] when I feel like someone stepped on my
[59:35] toes and I have righteous indignation
[59:37] and I should be able to step on their
[59:39] toes, maybe scuff their shoe the way
[59:40] they scuff mine or
[59:43] whatever. We're people. We're humans.
[59:46] But as the bride of Jesus Christ, we
[59:48] ought to follow his his example.
[59:52] As we read in Isaiah 53, he was led
[59:55] before the slaughter, a sheep before the
[59:57] the shear, gave up his wool. He It's his
[1:00:00] it's someone else's wool. Now, it's not
[1:00:02] my wool. He He went before the the the
[1:00:06] slaughter and and didn't say a word. He
[1:00:08] could have opened his mouth and called
[1:00:09] legions of angels and electrocuted maybe
[1:00:12] with lightning everyone. Opened up the
[1:00:14] ground and swallowed everyone. You know,
[1:00:16] that's the same God that dealt with Kora
[1:00:18] and Dayan was standing there in flesh
[1:00:21] that they were spitting on and buffeting
[1:00:23] and treating,
[1:00:26] mistreating. The same God that called us
[1:00:30] his bride.
[1:00:32] And you know, I want to say this
[1:00:33] tonight. I think it's so beautiful. You
[1:00:35] cannot be his bride without being
[1:00:40] elected. You cannot be his bride without
[1:00:43] being elected. Brother Brandham says it
[1:00:46] in the uh it is the rising of the sun.
[1:00:48] We've had many many churches, churches,
[1:00:50] brides and brides, but there has to be
[1:00:53] one one that that resurrection will come
[1:00:57] up in. And that one will be one. I love
[1:01:01] that thought. It's not going to be two
[1:01:03] brides. There's a bride at Calgary
[1:01:04] Living Word Assembly and there's a
[1:01:06] different bride at Saskatoon Tabernacle
[1:01:08] and we just don't see things the same.
[1:01:11] No, no, we'll see things exactly the
[1:01:13] same.
[1:01:15] Brother Brandham said it. We should be
[1:01:17] able to chew each other's
[1:01:19] gum, boy. And you know, people have
[1:01:21] tried to make doctrines out of that
[1:01:23] stuff, right? We're we're not we're not
[1:01:25] talking about the literal chew each
[1:01:26] other's gum. We should be so at ease
[1:01:29] with one another. Even if we don't see
[1:01:32] things eye to eye, we're still going to
[1:01:34] be able to fellowship together because
[1:01:37] we know who our God is.
[1:01:40] Now, I'm not saying there's anything
[1:01:43] there between me and Saskatoon
[1:01:45] Tabernacle. We're buddies. I I love
[1:01:48] Brother Dwayne and Brother Manow and all
[1:01:50] the saints there. Everything is great.
[1:01:52] There's no issue whatsoever. I I
[1:01:55] personally, if anybody wonders, I don't
[1:01:56] have issues with other churches. I am
[1:01:58] not at all interested in saying Calgary
[1:02:00] Living Word believes a certain way and
[1:02:03] someone else doesn't believe that way.
[1:02:04] So, we can't fellowship with them. If we
[1:02:07] hear that, that is a spirit of division.
[1:02:10] And I rebuke that devil in the name of
[1:02:12] Jesus Christ. I don't stand for that.
[1:02:14] Not for one second. If someone wants to
[1:02:17] worship God the way they want to worship
[1:02:19] God, then let them. If they say they
[1:02:22] believe that God sent a prophet and they
[1:02:23] do things differently than we do, let
[1:02:25] them. It's up to God. It's not up to us
[1:02:28] to sort people out.
[1:02:30] It's up to us to demonstrate the spirit
[1:02:32] that's inside of us, though. Amen. And
[1:02:35] we will.
[1:02:37] Out of the exposition of the seven
[1:02:39] church ages, the Ephesian church age.
[1:02:42] And I'm sorry I didn't send these. I
[1:02:44] failed.
[1:02:46] So when uh when you look back at the
[1:02:48] sound, guys, look at me.
[1:02:50] the exposition of the seven church ages.
[1:02:52] If you just type in now then I think
[1:02:55] there is something
[1:02:57] else out of the exposition of the seven
[1:03:00] church ages. The Ephesians church age.
[1:03:02] Now then I think there is something else
[1:03:04] you ought to know. I love it when the
[1:03:07] prophet talks like this. Just kind of
[1:03:09] perk your ears up and say, "Wow, what is
[1:03:11] it?" The seven churches which are
[1:03:14] addressed by John are in Asia Minor and
[1:03:16] are all gentile churches. I've just been
[1:03:20] uh this is a for free just been going
[1:03:22] through the feast of the trumpets. I'm
[1:03:24] sure everyone here is well verssed with
[1:03:25] that. Brother Bradom talks about in the
[1:03:27] feast of the trumpets how the seven
[1:03:29] church ages are not for the
[1:03:32] Jews. The seven trumpets are all for the
[1:03:35] Jews. The seven church ages are for the
[1:03:38] Gentiles. And uh yeah, it's right here.
[1:03:41] That's pretty neat. The seven churches
[1:03:43] which are addressed by John are in Asian
[1:03:45] minor are in Asia Minor and are all
[1:03:47] gentile churches. He does not speak to
[1:03:49] the church at Jerusalem which was mostly
[1:03:52] Jewish with perhaps just a few Gentiles
[1:03:55] in it. The reason is that God had turned
[1:03:58] from the Jews to the Gentiles. And one
[1:04:01] of these days very soon he will be
[1:04:03] turning all the way from the Gentiles
[1:04:06] back to the Jews. And that will manifest
[1:04:08] with the two prophets, Moses and Elijah,
[1:04:11] on the ground in the flesh, manifesting
[1:04:14] the anointing that they have. Thus, the
[1:04:18] whole of the church ages is God dealing
[1:04:21] with the Gentiles and calling out a
[1:04:24] Gentile bride to himself. So if we have
[1:04:28] the ability, brothers and sisters, to
[1:04:31] say that we're the bride of Jesus
[1:04:34] Christ, it's because he gave us an ear
[1:04:36] to hear that. And you know, every single
[1:04:39] church age has a bride in it.
[1:04:44] It's not only the Leodysian church age.
[1:04:46] It's not only just the bride age at the
[1:04:48] end, the culmination of all of the ages.
[1:04:50] Every single age has elected in it.
[1:04:54] Amen. And to prove that, you can look at
[1:04:56] the admonition to every single church
[1:04:58] age. The very last portion of that
[1:05:01] scripture in Revelations chapter 2 and
[1:05:03] chapter three is, "He that hath an ear,
[1:05:07] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[1:05:09] the church." And to me, I think that's
[1:05:11] so beautiful because what that does is a
[1:05:13] prophetic utterance. It unlocks the
[1:05:15] spiritual blessing to that age. For the
[1:05:19] people that are living in that age, the
[1:05:21] word of God has turned the key and
[1:05:24] allowed that spiritual anointing to be
[1:05:26] loosed upon all of his elect. And this
[1:05:30] is exactly what brother Brandham is
[1:05:32] saying here. Thus, the whole of the
[1:05:34] church ages is God dealing with the
[1:05:36] Gentiles and calling out a Gentile bride
[1:05:39] to himself. He that hath an ear, let him
[1:05:43] hear what the Spirit saith unto the
[1:05:46] church. He goes on to say that makes the
[1:05:49] church ages and the fullness of the
[1:05:52] Gentiles the one and the same thing.
[1:05:55] This can seem like a really heavy topic.
[1:05:58] And I believe it is. This is about as
[1:06:00] thick as it gets. It's very difficult to
[1:06:03] understand and comprehend these things
[1:06:05] with the human mind. It takes the spirit
[1:06:07] of God to allow us to understand what's
[1:06:10] being said here in Acts 13 verse 44-48.
[1:06:15] And the next Sabbath day came, almost
[1:06:18] the whole city together to hear the word
[1:06:21] of God. But when the Jews saw the
[1:06:24] multitudes, they were filled with envy
[1:06:27] and spake against those things which
[1:06:29] were spoken by Paul,
[1:06:32] contradicting and and blaspheming. And
[1:06:37] isn't that interesting how that's just
[1:06:39] kind of human nature, isn't it? When
[1:06:41] there's a move of God going on over
[1:06:43] there and it's not over here, people can
[1:06:46] begin to say things. People can begin to
[1:06:48] think things. I would say this isn't
[1:06:50] just the Jews. This is human nature. And
[1:06:52] we need to be very careful because when
[1:06:54] God's doing something, it's God doing
[1:06:56] something. And if we say that it's not
[1:06:58] God doing something, it's something
[1:07:00] else. Doesn't matter whether we call it
[1:07:02] a devil or not. If we say that it's not
[1:07:04] God doing something, that's blaspheming.
[1:07:06] When God is dealing with someone in
[1:07:08] their life, we have got to be careful
[1:07:10] that we're not talking bad about that
[1:07:13] doing in their life. And you know what
[1:07:15] God God is either in control or he ain't
[1:07:18] for us to say, "Well, it's not God doing
[1:07:20] that. Maybe it's not God doing that.
[1:07:23] Maybe God has allowed a devil to come
[1:07:25] and do that for that person in their
[1:07:27] lives so that his will will come to
[1:07:29] pass." Just like the prophet Micaiah, we
[1:07:31] know that story. I always preach on it.
[1:07:34] But it's God doing everything. It's his
[1:07:37] will that's coming to pass. It's so
[1:07:39] beautiful. Then Paul and Barnabas waxed
[1:07:42] bold and said, "It was necessary that
[1:07:44] the word of God should first have been
[1:07:47] spoken to you, all you people getting
[1:07:49] all blasphemous and jealous and envious.
[1:07:53] All you had your
[1:07:54] chance. The word came to you first, but
[1:07:58] you rejected it." Can you imagine that?
[1:08:02] But you but seeing ye put it from you
[1:08:05] and judge yourselves unworthy of
[1:08:07] everlasting life. Can you imagine
[1:08:12] that? Wow. Lo, we turn to the
[1:08:16] Gentiles. Remember you guys said, "Give
[1:08:19] us a murderer instead. We'll we'll take
[1:08:22] a robber and a murderer instead." That
[1:08:25] That's who we would rather have. When
[1:08:28] Pilate came out and said, "Behold the
[1:08:30] man." Yeah, we'll take Barnabas. Not
[1:08:33] Barnabas. Barabbus. We'll take Barabbus.
[1:08:36] We would rather have a murderer and a
[1:08:38] robber than see Jesus Christ be saved
[1:08:42] and released. And let his blood so sure,
[1:08:45] so adamant about the anger and the
[1:08:47] hostility that was in them. Yes, sir.
[1:08:51] Let his blood be upon us and our
[1:08:53] children.
[1:08:56] And you know, they
[1:08:58] prophesied. I did not understand the
[1:09:01] savagery, the evil as I grew up and
[1:09:04] looked at World War II and studied it.
[1:09:06] But you look at that spirit that was
[1:09:09] behind what came at the Jews.
[1:09:14] And you know, brothers and sisters, that
[1:09:16] spirit ain't dead. That spirit's alive
[1:09:19] and well tonight in this world.
[1:09:23] And it's wild because you don't have to
[1:09:24] look very far and you can see it. It's
[1:09:26] the exact same spirit. But once again,
[1:09:30] someone probably from the Jews is going
[1:09:32] to be saying this to the Gentiles. Hey,
[1:09:36] you found it un unworthy to have this
[1:09:38] word preached to you. You decided to
[1:09:40] say, "Oh, that guy, that Kentucky
[1:09:43] Hillbilly, who is he? He thought he had
[1:09:46] a an edge on the word of God. He thought
[1:09:48] he was somebody and everybody exalted
[1:09:50] him and made him something." The Jews
[1:09:52] are going to say, "That was your man.
[1:09:54] That was God speaking to that
[1:09:56] generation, calling them out." and you
[1:09:58] chose to reject them. Now the word of
[1:10:01] God has come back to us.
[1:10:03] Can you imagine if you look at Israel,
[1:10:06] if you look at at at Israel and
[1:10:08] Jerusalem when they get together and
[1:10:10] sing, have you heard them sing together,
[1:10:13] it is unreal,
[1:10:15] the unity in their voice. And I can't
[1:10:18] help but think that voice is just
[1:10:19] getting stronger and stronger and
[1:10:22] stronger because just like it's the same
[1:10:24] spirit here that was in William, Mary,
[1:10:26] and Brandham that will go there and be
[1:10:28] in the Elijah there and Moses, that same
[1:10:32] spirit is the what am I trying to say
[1:10:35] here? The same spirit that was in the
[1:10:38] children of Israel crying out in Egypt
[1:10:40] when they were in bondage will be the
[1:10:42] exact same cries. Amen. Coming from
[1:10:45] under the altar, coming from the land of
[1:10:48] Israel, the promised land, calling for
[1:10:51] Messiah, for send us a deliverer. And we
[1:10:54] know that's coming. I should just stop
[1:10:56] preaching and start reading. Then Paul
[1:10:58] and Barnabas waxed bold and said, "It
[1:11:00] was necessary that the word of God
[1:11:02] should first have been spoken to you.
[1:11:04] But seeing ye put it from you, and judge
[1:11:07] yourselves unworthy of everlasting life,
[1:11:09] lo, we turn to the Gentiles. For so hath
[1:11:13] the Lord commanded us, saying, I have
[1:11:16] set thee to be a light of the Gentiles,
[1:11:19] that thou shouldest be for salvation
[1:11:22] unto the ends of the earth. And when the
[1:11:26] Gentiles heard this, they were glad.
[1:11:30] And I could say, um, I'm glad.
[1:11:33] Amen. And when the Gentiles heard this,
[1:11:36] they were glad and glorified the word of
[1:11:39] the Lord.
[1:11:41] And as many as were ordained to eternal
[1:11:44] life believed.
[1:11:46] Isn't that beautiful? They were ordained
[1:11:49] to eternal life. I think they were
[1:11:52] predestined to eternal life. I think
[1:11:55] they were
[1:11:56] elected into eternal life.
[1:12:00] Romans 11 verse 1
[1:12:03] to8 I say then hath God cast away his
[1:12:06] people God forbid for I also am an an
[1:12:10] Israelite of the seed of Abraham of the
[1:12:13] tribe of Benjamin God hath not cast away
[1:12:16] his people which he
[1:12:20] forneew these are these are important
[1:12:23] words what ye not what the scripture
[1:12:26] saith of Elias how he maketh
[1:12:28] intercession ession to God against
[1:12:31] Israel, saying, Lord, they have killed
[1:12:32] thy prophets, and dig down thine altars,
[1:12:35] and I am left alone, and they seek my
[1:12:38] life. But what saith the answer of God
[1:12:41] unto
[1:12:42] him? I have reserved to myself 7,000 men
[1:12:46] who have not bowed the knee to the image
[1:12:49] of Baal. I was going over this and it
[1:12:51] just struck me so hard to think about
[1:12:53] this. How many times we can look around
[1:12:56] and if we're not careful, that little
[1:12:57] speck of pride can be in our life and we
[1:12:59] think, you know, there's very, very few
[1:13:02] people that really actually believe this
[1:13:04] word of God the way that we believe it.
[1:13:05] Remember the prophet of God said that
[1:13:08] once upon a time and God had to come and
[1:13:11] say to him, listen, there's more than
[1:13:14] you think. I've got this under my
[1:13:17] control, not yours. I know you want to
[1:13:19] actually serve me and do your very best,
[1:13:22] but you got to let me do it. I think
[1:13:24] it's so beautiful the way he did that.
[1:13:27] But he had 7,000 men who had not bowed
[1:13:30] the knee to the image of
[1:13:32] Baal. Even so then at this present time
[1:13:35] also there is a remnant according to the
[1:13:39] election of
[1:13:40] grace. And if by grace then it is no
[1:13:44] more of works. Otherwise, grace is no
[1:13:48] more
[1:13:48] grace. But if it be of works, then it is
[1:13:52] no more grace. Otherwise, work is no
[1:13:55] more work. What
[1:13:57] then? Israel hath not obtained that
[1:14:00] which he seeketh for, but the election
[1:14:05] hath obtained
[1:14:06] it. That is just astounding.
[1:14:10] and the rest were blinded, according as
[1:14:13] it is written, God hath given them the
[1:14:15] spirit of slumber, eyes that they should
[1:14:17] not see, and ears that they should not
[1:14:20] hear unto this day. You could imagine
[1:14:23] that when their eyes are open and their
[1:14:25] ears are open, those people are going to
[1:14:28] want to worship God with all of their
[1:14:30] heart. They will be the most fervent
[1:14:34] people on the face of the earth.
[1:14:37] Romans
[1:14:38] 11:25-29. For I would not, brethren,
[1:14:40] that ye should be ignorant of this
[1:14:42] mystery. Isn't that beautiful? Lest ye
[1:14:46] should be wise in your own
[1:14:49] conceits. That blindness in part is
[1:14:52] happened to Israel until the fullness of
[1:14:56] the Gentiles become in. And boy, I can't
[1:14:59] help but think that that that sentence,
[1:15:01] that scripture has never been closer.
[1:15:04] Never been closer than it is tonight at
[1:15:07] this very moment. Amen. Boy, till all
[1:15:10] the Gentiles come in. And so all Israel
[1:15:14] shall be saved as it is written, there
[1:15:17] shall come out of Sion the deliverer,
[1:15:20] and shall turn away ungodliness from
[1:15:23] Jacob. For this is my covenant unto them
[1:15:28] when I shall take away their
[1:15:31] sins. Not them, not the priest, not the
[1:15:35] pope. He'll come and do it. I think it's
[1:15:38] so beautiful how those Muslims got
[1:15:40] really scared. They got really worried.
[1:15:42] And what did they do? They went and
[1:15:43] stopped up that eastern gate. Put some
[1:15:45] big, perfectly fitted stones in there.
[1:15:47] Probably reinforced it with some epoxy
[1:15:50] cement and maybe some rebar. They're
[1:15:52] going to make sure there ain't no no guy
[1:15:55] coming through that eastern gate, but
[1:15:56] ain't nothing going to stop the Messiah
[1:15:58] when he comes through that eastern gate.
[1:16:01] He's going to come through that eastern
[1:16:03] gate. I think it's so beautiful. My
[1:16:05] goodness. My covenant unto them when I
[1:16:08] shall take away their sins. As
[1:16:11] concerning the gospel, they are enemies
[1:16:14] for your sakes.
[1:16:17] But as touching the
[1:16:19] election, they are beloved for the
[1:16:22] father's
[1:16:24] sakes. My, you know, sometimes in this
[1:16:27] life, you hear people getting upset. I
[1:16:29] think I've talked about this in the
[1:16:30] past, how they get upset about the Jews
[1:16:32] and how they did all the nasty things
[1:16:35] that we talked about with Jesus when he
[1:16:37] was being judged in the judgment hall
[1:16:40] with Pilate and how they wanted the
[1:16:42] murderer and the robber and they spat on
[1:16:45] him and they mistreated him. Everyone
[1:16:47] was against him. Even his disciples,
[1:16:48] they scattered. They ran. We know the
[1:16:51] rock, Peter, that one person that the
[1:16:55] Catholic Church claims that he built the
[1:16:58] church on, that man so unstable that he
[1:17:00] would curse and deny God and curse while
[1:17:03] doing
[1:17:05] it. Those
[1:17:07] people, they're elected.
[1:17:11] They are elected just like we are. Amen.
[1:17:13] just for a different portion of the
[1:17:15] scripture. And and it's so amazing
[1:17:18] because some people in this world, they
[1:17:19] will be scorners at the Jews and say the
[1:17:22] Jews are terrible people because they
[1:17:23] did that. They crucified the Lord. And
[1:17:26] and it wasn't the Jews that did it. I'll
[1:17:28] say it this way. It wasn't the Jews that
[1:17:30] did it. It was it was the makeelievers
[1:17:32] and the unbelievers. It wasn't the truly
[1:17:34] elected Jews that put Jesus Christ on
[1:17:37] the cross. It was the evil spirits that
[1:17:39] were inflicting all of the other people
[1:17:42] that were not actually Israel. Because
[1:17:45] not all Israel is Israel. Not all those
[1:17:48] people that claim to be the true Jews
[1:17:50] are actually Jews. Just like not all the
[1:17:52] people that claim to be the bride of
[1:17:54] Jesus Christ in the gentile church are
[1:17:57] actually real bride of Jesus Christ. But
[1:18:01] this part here as as touching election
[1:18:05] they are beloved for the father's sakes
[1:18:08] and to think they were blinded for us.
[1:18:12] My
[1:18:14] goodness. For the gifts and calling of
[1:18:16] God are without
[1:18:19] repentance. Such a beautiful thing.
[1:18:22] These seven churches located in Asia
[1:18:24] Minor contain certain characteristics
[1:18:26] within them at that ancient date which
[1:18:30] became the mature fruit of later ages.
[1:18:33] What were just seed plants back there
[1:18:36] came out later in mature harvest even as
[1:18:39] Jesus said for if they do these things
[1:18:42] in a green tree what shall be done in
[1:18:45] the dry? And that's when the fruit is
[1:18:48] actually hanging on the tree, right?
[1:18:50] When it's full
[1:18:52] mature. I just love this this topic of
[1:18:56] election because it's God's choice.
[1:19:00] Amen. And as much as we would like to
[1:19:02] say we could potentially put ourselves
[1:19:04] there. There's nobody that could put
[1:19:05] themselves into the category of elected
[1:19:09] to say that they're elected. And you
[1:19:11] know, we just came through an election.
[1:19:12] I'm not going to get political one way
[1:19:14] or the other, but we're not talking
[1:19:16] about casting
[1:19:17] ballots election. We're talking about
[1:19:20] being elected, fornown before the
[1:19:23] foundation of the world, having been
[1:19:25] known, predestinated, and fornown in the
[1:19:28] mind of God before there was one speck
[1:19:30] of stardust. Before there was one piece
[1:19:33] of dark matter in this universe, before
[1:19:35] there was anything,
[1:19:38] we were in the mind of God. Amen. We
[1:19:40] were fornown. We were predestinated to
[1:19:43] be the elected of the age. That's the
[1:19:46] election that we're talking about. To be
[1:19:48] chosen is really what it comes up as in
[1:19:50] the Greek lexicon. To be chosen, brother
[1:19:53] Brandham, in the Sriian church age, in
[1:19:56] the exposition of the seven church ages.
[1:19:58] And this is sort of the the the area
[1:20:00] where the question came out of how how
[1:20:03] one could be uh righteous and one could
[1:20:05] be unrighteous. One could be saved, one
[1:20:07] would be lost. How can that be? And and
[1:20:10] I think the the critical factor to all
[1:20:12] of this, brothers and sisters, if I
[1:20:13] could impart one thought that I think is
[1:20:16] so important is we just need to remember
[1:20:18] it's not up to us to determine who is
[1:20:21] who. It's up to God to determine who is
[1:20:25] who. As soon as we say they don't
[1:20:27] believe the way the way that we do, they
[1:20:29] they've got this thing that they do. And
[1:20:31] and as soon as we start doing that,
[1:20:34] we're actually going to be in error
[1:20:36] ourselves because it's God that
[1:20:39] justifieth, isn't it? And it's so
[1:20:41] beautiful because justification gives
[1:20:43] way to sanctification.
[1:20:45] Sanctification gives way to the baptism
[1:20:47] of the Holy Ghost. But there comes a
[1:20:48] point in time where the truly elected
[1:20:50] will see the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:52] give way to the baptism of the Holy
[1:20:55] Ghost itself in their lives. the literal
[1:20:58] life of Jesus Christ walking and talking
[1:21:02] on earth again in his bride body. It's
[1:21:06] more than just an association. Way more.
[1:21:10] But he goes on to say here in the
[1:21:12] exposition of the seven church ages out
[1:21:13] of the Sriian church age. Now the Lord
[1:21:15] God Almighty
[1:21:18] says, I
[1:21:22] know there he is walking in the midst of
[1:21:25] his people. There he is, the chief
[1:21:28] shepherd of the flock. But does he hold
[1:21:32] back the
[1:21:33] persecution? Does he stem the
[1:21:37] tribulation? No, he does
[1:21:40] not. And you
[1:21:43] know,
[1:21:44] I
[1:21:50] wonder I I don't have the scripture in
[1:21:52] front of me. It just makes me want to
[1:21:53] preach when I get into reading like
[1:21:54] this. It's just interesting, you know.
[1:21:57] He doesn't hold back the persecution. He
[1:21:59] doesn't hold back the tribulation. I
[1:22:00] just want to say this. Paul, the first
[1:22:04] church age messenger, remember that God
[1:22:07] gave him a thorn in the flesh. He gave
[1:22:10] him a thorn in the flesh. And that to
[1:22:14] him made him a
[1:22:16] masterpiece because what happened was he
[1:22:20] had this thorn and he was potentially
[1:22:23] puffed up with revelation because the
[1:22:24] word of God says
[1:22:26] because I don't want you to get puffed
[1:22:28] up with revelation. I'm going to give
[1:22:29] you this thorn in your flesh. And we
[1:22:31] know there's a few different versions of
[1:22:32] what that could have been. I'm not
[1:22:34] really going to try and get into that.
[1:22:36] I'm just going to say the flesh was a
[1:22:39] problem for Paul in a certain area. And
[1:22:41] and many times we can have a problem in
[1:22:44] our flesh in a certain area. And and you
[1:22:47] know, Paul sought Paul, the first church
[1:22:49] age messenger, the one with all the
[1:22:50] revelation, the one that met him in the
[1:22:52] pillar of fire on the way to
[1:22:55] Damascus. That guy who had his name
[1:22:58] changed, who had his character changed,
[1:23:00] had such an experience with the Lord,
[1:23:03] but he had to get knocked off his high
[1:23:04] horse. Yes, he had to go and put his
[1:23:08] face to the ground before God. And once
[1:23:11] he did that, he recognized who it was
[1:23:14] because he said, "Who art thou, Lord?"
[1:23:17] He knew what was going
[1:23:18] on. But he had to actually go through
[1:23:21] the process. And and even once he was
[1:23:23] through that process and became
[1:23:25] revelated, became justified, became
[1:23:28] sanctified, became so filled with the
[1:23:30] Holy Ghost, he was the first church age
[1:23:32] messenger.
[1:23:34] He prayed to God and said, "Take it
[1:23:36] away." Three times thrice is what the
[1:23:38] Bible says. And God said, 'You know
[1:23:40] what, Paul? So that you don't get puffed
[1:23:42] up beyond measure with the level of
[1:23:45] revelation that you got, you're going to
[1:23:46] have this thorn in your flesh. And you
[1:23:48] just need to remember that one thing is
[1:23:50] important to you, and that is that my
[1:23:53] grace, my elective grace is sufficient.
[1:23:58] Amen. So, if it was good enough for the
[1:24:01] church age messenger, oughtn't it be
[1:24:03] good enough for little old us here
[1:24:05] tonight to say that his grace is
[1:24:07] sufficient
[1:24:09] when we've got that thorn in our flesh,
[1:24:11] brothers and sisters, to know that we've
[1:24:13] got that thorn in our flesh because he's
[1:24:15] allowed it so that we don't get puffed
[1:24:17] up beyond measure.
[1:24:20] We've got the full open book if we take
[1:24:22] this book and eat it up. If we take the
[1:24:24] message and eat it up, brothers and
[1:24:26] sisters, I believe it with all my heart.
[1:24:27] With the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[1:24:29] our lives, we can be as revelated as
[1:24:32] Paul the Apostle was. We've got the full
[1:24:35] open book. John was told to take the
[1:24:38] book and eat it up. I'm not saying that
[1:24:41] we'll ever be the level of a prophet.
[1:24:43] That was a very specific office that
[1:24:45] Paul was in. We'll never be the the
[1:24:48] prophet for this age. No. But I believe
[1:24:51] revelation is from God. Revelation is
[1:24:54] not exclusive to people. Revelation is
[1:24:57] so that we can actually realize who we
[1:25:00] are. We're not our own.
[1:25:05] But does he hold back the persecution?
[1:25:07] Nope. Does he stem the tribulation? No,
[1:25:13] he does not. Is what the prophet says
[1:25:15] here. He simply says, "I know your
[1:25:18] tribulation. I am not at all unmindful
[1:25:22] of your
[1:25:24] suffering. What a stumbling block this
[1:25:26] is to so many
[1:25:29] people. I heard a brother preaching
[1:25:31] recently and I thought it was so good.
[1:25:33] He said, you know, we uh all the time
[1:25:35] hear about the praise reports and it's
[1:25:37] so wonderful when God answers our
[1:25:39] prayers the way that we ask it. But do
[1:25:41] we ever come and actually give a praise
[1:25:42] report that God didn't answer my prayer
[1:25:44] the way that I wanted it to? But I know
[1:25:46] he answered it the way that he wanted to
[1:25:47] answer it and that's good enough for me
[1:25:49] and I'm willing to praise him for it. Do
[1:25:51] we bring those reports forward?
[1:25:55] I thought, man, that's next level. I
[1:25:57] don't know. I've I don't think I've ever
[1:25:58] done
[1:26:00] that. But it sure made me wonder. Are we
[1:26:04] willing to praise him when he says no?
[1:26:09] What a stumbling block this is to so
[1:26:11] many people like Israel. They wonder if
[1:26:14] God really loves
[1:26:16] them. How can God be just and
[1:26:20] loving if he stands by and watches his
[1:26:23] people
[1:26:24] suffer? And we know many times we hear
[1:26:27] people in the world say that. It's it's
[1:26:28] a simple argument and and it makes a lot
[1:26:30] of sense when you see this world. You
[1:26:32] see so many terrible things in this
[1:26:34] world. You see children, helpless
[1:26:37] children persecuted by evil people.
[1:26:41] How could God stand by and just let that
[1:26:44] happen? I think it's so important to to
[1:26:48] recognize he's sovereign in every single
[1:26:51] situation. And we just need to trust him
[1:26:55] by faith. We we can't say that we
[1:26:57] understand it and perfectly explain it.
[1:27:00] If we could do that, then we wouldn't
[1:27:01] need faith. We could go to a a Bible
[1:27:04] college and and eat the book the way
[1:27:06] that they give it to us and and put our
[1:27:08] badge on and put our plaque on the wall
[1:27:10] and say that we're educated in the ways
[1:27:13] of the word and all is well and we'd
[1:27:16] have no room for revelation. Right.
[1:27:18] Right. He says like Israel, they wonder
[1:27:21] if God really loves them. How can God be
[1:27:24] just and loving if he stands by and
[1:27:26] watches his people suffer? And I think
[1:27:29] it's amazing when we look at the world,
[1:27:30] we can see complete uh aliens from the
[1:27:34] economy of God, people that aren't
[1:27:36] actually documented elected
[1:27:39] believers. But what about when
[1:27:42] believers have the thorn in their flesh
[1:27:44] and believers get the persecution in
[1:27:47] their lives? And that's what he's
[1:27:48] talking about
[1:27:49] here. He stands by and watches his
[1:27:52] people suffer. That is what they asked
[1:27:55] in Malachi 1:es 1 to3. the burden of the
[1:27:59] word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi. I
[1:28:03] have loved you, saith the Lord. Yet ye
[1:28:05] say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Oh my,
[1:28:09] I had this problem and I had that
[1:28:11] heartache and I had the other thing that
[1:28:13] happened in my life. Where did you love
[1:28:14] me,
[1:28:17] Lord? Yet ye say, wherein hast thou
[1:28:19] loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother,
[1:28:23] saith the Lord? Yet I loved Jacob and
[1:28:27] hated Esau
[1:28:29] and laid his mountains and his heritage
[1:28:32] waste for the dragons of the wilderness.
[1:28:34] He says, you see, they could not figure
[1:28:38] out God's love. It's much different than
[1:28:41] a mother's love.
[1:28:43] It's much different than the way we
[1:28:45] might love our children. Amen. And it's
[1:28:48] much different than the way we might
[1:28:49] love one another.
[1:28:52] It's God's love. It's elective love is
[1:28:55] what we learned with our church age
[1:28:56] study. He said they thought that love
[1:28:59] meant no
[1:29:01] suffering. They thought that love meant
[1:29:03] a baby with parental
[1:29:06] care. But God said that his love was
[1:29:09] elective
[1:29:10] love. The proof of his love is.
[1:29:17] And that's why I can't help but just
[1:29:20] stick on this for a little while.
[1:29:22] Brothers and
[1:29:23] sisters, it's so important for us to
[1:29:25] recognize what brother Brandham means.
[1:29:28] And and I'm not saying this is it can
[1:29:30] sound like I'm trying to bring
[1:29:32] correction to a prophet or or whatever,
[1:29:34] but if we have the ability to hear the
[1:29:37] word of God for our day, it's because
[1:29:40] God gave us that ability. And that
[1:29:42] ability comes by the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:29:46] We have a desire in our life to go to
[1:29:48] church. We have a desire in our life to
[1:29:50] take our children to church. We have a
[1:29:52] desire in our life to follow the word of
[1:29:54] God. As we eat the book, we become the
[1:29:57] book. The more we learn about it, the
[1:29:58] more we want to follow it. And the more
[1:30:00] we want to follow it, the more we do
[1:30:03] what it says to do. And when it says to
[1:30:05] repent, we want to repent. And it says
[1:30:08] get baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:30:10] Jesus Christ for the remission of our
[1:30:12] sins. We want to do that. Amen. Why do
[1:30:16] we want to do that? because we're
[1:30:17] elected.
[1:30:20] The ones that aren't elected will say,
[1:30:21] "Well, I've been baptized in Father,
[1:30:23] Son, and Holy Ghost, and it's good
[1:30:24] enough." It's just like baking a
[1:30:26] chocolate cake and saying, "I'm going to
[1:30:27] substitute salt for the sugar." Looks
[1:30:31] exactly the same, weighs exactly the
[1:30:33] same, probably bakes up exactly the
[1:30:36] same. I remember my pastor preaching
[1:30:38] that, Brother Ken. But take a nice slice
[1:30:42] of it, put some whipped cream and some
[1:30:44] ice cream on it and try and eat it. Even
[1:30:48] though it looks the same, it ain't going
[1:30:49] to taste the same.
[1:30:52] It's the same thing with the Holy Ghost.
[1:30:55] If you want to know what the recipe is,
[1:30:57] follow the word of God. Why didn't
[1:31:00] anybody baptize in the name of the
[1:31:01] father and the name of the son, in the
[1:31:03] name of the holy ghost? Documented word
[1:31:05] in the Bible. If that's the case, why
[1:31:08] didn't it just come from Nia
[1:31:12] Rome? We all know. But God's love is
[1:31:15] elective.
[1:31:17] God said that his love was elective
[1:31:18] love. The proof of his love is election.
[1:31:21] If we have the ability to hear the word
[1:31:23] for our day, that means we have the Holy
[1:31:25] Ghost in our lives. Because not
[1:31:27] everybody can hear this word. Not
[1:31:29] everybody desires to come and hear this
[1:31:31] word. In fact, a lot of people, if you
[1:31:33] say one thing just a little bit wrong,
[1:31:34] then they get all offended and run away
[1:31:36] from this word. Why is that? And what
[1:31:40] about all the other people that would
[1:31:41] just never listen to it at
[1:31:43] all? God's love is elective love. The
[1:31:46] proof of his love is
[1:31:48] election. That no matter what happened,
[1:31:51] his love was proven truly by the fact
[1:31:54] that they were chosen unto salvation.
[1:32:00] Many people claim Jesus Christ. Many
[1:32:02] people claim the
[1:32:04] blood. But how many people are willing
[1:32:06] to follow the word of a vindicated
[1:32:08] prophet for their day? Amen. I just
[1:32:11] can't get away from the thought of
[1:32:12] Jeremiah. If you want a good visual of
[1:32:15] that, watch that movie Jeremiah. It's
[1:32:17] called Jeremiah, the
[1:32:19] movie. And how his life was. God called
[1:32:22] him. He was a prophet from his mother's
[1:32:24] womb. He was a major prophet. And all he
[1:32:28] did was what God told him to do. He
[1:32:30] couldn't do anything else. He was that
[1:32:32] prophet. And every single time he went
[1:32:34] and told them, cried out to them, "Get
[1:32:37] back to the word of God." They were,
[1:32:39] they had disdain for him. Who are you?
[1:32:41] We know who you are. You're just a
[1:32:43] little punk trying to puff yourself up
[1:32:45] and make yourself somebody. You're
[1:32:47] acting like you're you're you're the
[1:32:49] biggest pebble on the beach. What are
[1:32:51] you doing? embarrassing your parents and
[1:32:53] and mocking the church and telling them
[1:32:55] they're all wrong and telling everyone
[1:32:57] to repent. We're all Christians. We've
[1:32:59] been doing this longer than you've been
[1:33:00] alive. What do you have to say? And all
[1:33:03] he was saying was what God put in his
[1:33:05] mouth. Get back to the word of God. Get
[1:33:07] back in line with the word of
[1:33:09] God. It's the same thing
[1:33:12] today. But not everyone can do it,
[1:33:14] brothers and sisters. I think it's so
[1:33:16] incredible, so amazing to even talk
[1:33:19] about it. How incredible is it that we
[1:33:22] have the ability to hear? How incredible
[1:33:26] is it that we could say that we're
[1:33:27] elected to hear? How incredible is it to
[1:33:30] say that we've been called unto
[1:33:32] salvation?
[1:33:38] It's not just something that we act. We
[1:33:41] don't just go to church Christmas and
[1:33:43] Easter and just maybe if our baby's
[1:33:47] getting christened or whatever or maybe
[1:33:49] if we go and have a communion service
[1:33:51] once in a year or
[1:33:53] whatever, this election causes something
[1:33:56] to stir in our lives.
[1:33:58] And I think it's so amazing because it
[1:34:01] causes music.
[1:34:04] It causes worship.
[1:34:07] It causes amens, doesn't it?
[1:34:09] It's so incredible. It causes us to get
[1:34:12] out of bed early in the morning to pray.
[1:34:14] It causes us to get out of bed and come
[1:34:16] to church and to fight our way across
[1:34:18] the city when we're tired and we much
[1:34:20] rather just go to bed or or relax and
[1:34:23] put our feet up on a Wednesday night. It
[1:34:25] constrains
[1:34:26] us. This election is something that I
[1:34:29] don't think we should ever take for
[1:34:32] granted. His love, the proof of his love
[1:34:35] is election. that no matter what
[1:34:38] happened, his love was proven truly by
[1:34:40] the fact they were chosen unto
[1:34:42] salvation. Because God hath chosen you
[1:34:45] to salvation through sanctification of
[1:34:49] the spirit and belief of the
[1:34:53] truth. I understand the word of God as
[1:34:56] much as I need to. And that is that I
[1:34:59] need to be baptized and I get the Holy
[1:35:01] Ghost in my life. And when I get the
[1:35:03] Holy Ghost in my life, it's not going to
[1:35:05] be a flowery bed of ease. It's not going
[1:35:08] to be a bowl of cherries. It's not going
[1:35:10] to be rainbows and butterflies. That's
[1:35:12] when it actually starts. But at least we
[1:35:15] know we have an advocate. At least we
[1:35:18] know who is living outside of our life,
[1:35:22] who's living from the inside of us,
[1:35:24] shining to the outside world. And we
[1:35:26] know the word of God says take no
[1:35:28] thought in the day that you need to.
[1:35:30] When people come around and they try and
[1:35:32] poke you and prod you and say things
[1:35:34] about God, you don't have to take
[1:35:35] thought. You don't have to try and
[1:35:37] premeditate stuff. The spirit will speak
[1:35:40] expressly through the individual. It's
[1:35:43] beautiful because God hath chosen you to
[1:35:45] salvation through the sanctification of
[1:35:47] the spirit. With his spirit in our
[1:35:49] lives, we become justified and
[1:35:52] sanctified. And it gives us the ability
[1:35:55] to have the spirit of truth in our
[1:35:57] lives. It gives us the ability through
[1:36:00] the Holy Ghost to say amen to the word
[1:36:02] of God. I never saw it that way before,
[1:36:04] but it's in the word of God. So, I must
[1:36:06] line up with it. I just simply must. I
[1:36:08] don't understand it and I can't explain
[1:36:09] it, but I know I just have to do it the
[1:36:12] way the word of God says it. And and we
[1:36:13] could take so many different examples
[1:36:15] and put them in there. I'm not going to
[1:36:16] do that tonight.
[1:36:18] But you don't necessarily have to teach
[1:36:20] someone all of the things that has to
[1:36:23] happen. Right? Let maybe we would just
[1:36:24] use one example, the most basic example
[1:36:27] there is. And and I would say it this
[1:36:29] where brother Brandham I think he was in
[1:36:31] South Africa. He was in Africa was it
[1:36:34] when he had the great campaigns and
[1:36:35] there was a tribes tribes were there in
[1:36:38] the speedway and they had fences
[1:36:39] dividing them because they didn't want
[1:36:41] to have tribal differences and they
[1:36:44] brought certain people up at certain
[1:36:45] times for prayer when they needed it.
[1:36:47] And one of the tribes, they actually
[1:36:49] were just naked. The women were just
[1:36:51] naked. The men were just naked. But he
[1:36:53] uses the example of the women. They came
[1:36:56] up, they got prayed for, and something
[1:36:58] happened to them. Suddenly, from being
[1:37:00] naked, just standing in front of
[1:37:02] everyone the way they've always lived
[1:37:03] their lives. Suddenly, they wanted to
[1:37:05] cover up. Suddenly, they were
[1:37:08] embarrassed about being naked. And
[1:37:10] nobody said to them, "You better put on
[1:37:12] a coat or you can't go up there.
[1:37:17] Oh, sister, you're wearing pants. You
[1:37:19] can't come
[1:37:21] in. We never want to become that way.
[1:37:24] Soon as we become that way, there's
[1:37:27] something wrong.
[1:37:30] But all we need to do is get people to
[1:37:31] Christ. If we can truly get people to
[1:37:34] the living God. Let them see that it's a
[1:37:38] living word in our lives. It's not just
[1:37:41] an association or just a membership of a
[1:37:44] church. It's actually the church of the
[1:37:46] living God to be elected to be
[1:37:51] predestined. God hath chosen you to
[1:37:54] salvation through sanctification of the
[1:37:56] spirit and belief of the truth. We can
[1:37:58] believe what God's prophet sent when we
[1:38:01] read the exposition of the seven church
[1:38:02] ages. Something inside us just says,
[1:38:05] "Yeah, that's what that's that paragraph
[1:38:08] is. It's so good. He may commit you to
[1:38:10] death as he did Paul." And you know,
[1:38:12] brothers and sisters, if we don't go in
[1:38:13] the rapture, that's what's going to
[1:38:15] happen. That's that's the truth. It
[1:38:18] could be young. It could be old. Could
[1:38:20] be in between. It's God's choice. It's
[1:38:24] not our choice. Our choice is God. So
[1:38:27] long as we choose God, we've done our
[1:38:30] part. He may commit you to death as he
[1:38:32] did Paul. He may commit you to suffering
[1:38:35] as he did Job. Oh man, we could take
[1:38:39] both of those two sentences and I
[1:38:41] believe I could preach a series on both
[1:38:42] of those, but I'm not going to tonight.
[1:38:45] So, don't get nervous. We got about nine
[1:38:48] minutes left. But he might commit you to
[1:38:50] death as he did Paul. He might commit
[1:38:52] you to suffering as he did Job. I say,
[1:38:54] Lord have mercy. That his that is his
[1:38:58] prerogative. He's
[1:39:00] sovereign. But it's all with a purpose.
[1:39:03] And what's the purpose, brothers and
[1:39:04] sisters? The purpose is so that he can
[1:39:06] have that
[1:39:08] gold that was tried in the
[1:39:11] fire given to his church. That the
[1:39:15] church could buy that gold. And how do
[1:39:17] we buy it? By killing ourselves through
[1:39:20] the sufferings that we go through. It
[1:39:22] shapes and molds our character into his.
[1:39:26] Oh my. And this is where he starts to
[1:39:29] see his reflection. And when he does,
[1:39:32] he's gonna strike it and he's gonna say
[1:39:36] speak. And I could jump ahead and I
[1:39:38] think I did before, but it's so
[1:39:40] beautiful because when he says speak,
[1:39:42] that's the commission for the day in
[1:39:43] which we live. It ain't to speak
[1:39:45] squirrels into existence. And it's not
[1:39:47] to actually call little fishy to
[1:39:49] life. It's to speak the word. Speak the
[1:39:53] word of God that's in our heart and and
[1:39:55] have full confidence that it's not us
[1:39:57] doing it, it's him doing it.
[1:40:00] It's all with a purpose. If he did not
[1:40:02] have a purpose, then he would be the
[1:40:05] author of frustration and not of peace.
[1:40:08] He his purpose is that after we have
[1:40:11] suffered a while, we would be made
[1:40:15] perfect, be
[1:40:17] established, strengthened, and settled.
[1:40:21] And isn't that exactly what happened
[1:40:22] with
[1:40:23] him? He learned obedience through the
[1:40:26] what? through the things that he
[1:40:28] suffered, the things that he suffered.
[1:40:32] God in flesh learned obedience in his
[1:40:35] flesh through the things that he
[1:40:38] suffered. Oh my, I think about this and
[1:40:40] it just astounds me because that means
[1:40:42] that I've got some
[1:40:44] sufferings because I need I need to be
[1:40:46] more obedient. I know it. And every one
[1:40:49] of us, we have this in our lives. We've
[1:40:51] got to kill the old man. I I just think
[1:40:55] of his love as
[1:40:56] elected. What a beautiful thing it is.
[1:40:59] We We've been chosen unto
[1:41:02] salvation. I think it can give us the
[1:41:04] ability to forget the struggles in our
[1:41:07] minds. It can give us the ability to
[1:41:09] forget the struggles in our bodies and
[1:41:12] say, "Lord, if this is your will for me
[1:41:14] to go through this the way that it's
[1:41:15] happening, then obviously it must be
[1:41:17] your will or it wouldn't be happening
[1:41:19] this way. So, if that's what you want,
[1:41:21] Lord, then bring it on.
[1:41:24] then do it because I know it's going to
[1:41:26] be for my good. It's going to be so that
[1:41:29] you're exalted in me one way or another.
[1:41:31] Whether you want me to go to the grave
[1:41:32] so that you can take me home, okay? Or
[1:41:36] whether you want me to go in the sky,
[1:41:38] okay? But if I can rejoice in the midst
[1:41:41] of my
[1:41:42] trials, it's not going to be me
[1:41:44] rejoicing. It's going to be God
[1:41:48] rejoicing. I remember hearing a story,
[1:41:50] and I hope it's okay. I remember hearing
[1:41:53] a story one time about brother Ken, how
[1:41:55] he had the devil come around and got
[1:41:57] him, knocked him to the ground. He told
[1:42:00] me that he was on the floor of his
[1:42:02] bathroom and the whites of his eyes went
[1:42:06] yellow. And if you know about the
[1:42:09] medical stuff, that's bad news. This was
[1:42:12] a long time ago. And he said that in the
[1:42:16] midst of
[1:42:18] it, he started to rejoice.
[1:42:21] He started to
[1:42:22] praise and the devil was trying to make
[1:42:25] him feel like he was in deep trouble.
[1:42:27] He's got a big huge problem. But you
[1:42:29] know what happened is it cleared up and
[1:42:31] it just went
[1:42:33] away. I I just struck me. It stuck with
[1:42:36] me and and perhaps maybe I got the story
[1:42:38] wrong just a little bit and forgive me
[1:42:40] if I did, but I it's the way I remember
[1:42:42] it. And I remember so passionately
[1:42:44] thinking about it to rejoice in the
[1:42:46] midst of that. I would want to run to
[1:42:48] the doctor and say, "What's wrong with
[1:42:49] me? I I feel this terrible thing and my
[1:42:52] eyes look like this. It's got to be
[1:42:54] terrible. But to think that God allows
[1:42:56] these things to happen, I can't help but
[1:42:58] think, brother Ken, he read the church
[1:43:00] age book and I know he did. He believed
[1:43:02] it. He believed that God's love is
[1:43:06] elective. And in order for us to be able
[1:43:09] to go through these trials, he gives us
[1:43:13] his spirit. And I can't help but think
[1:43:15] it's just his spirit that worships
[1:43:17] inside of us. But when we can do that, I
[1:43:20] believe what it does is it just shows
[1:43:22] the devil he's got no hope. He's got no
[1:43:24] chance. There's nothing that he can do.
[1:43:26] He's not going to have any success. And
[1:43:28] we know that the prophet said, "The
[1:43:30] devil come to the place where he just
[1:43:31] doesn't know what to do with you. Every
[1:43:33] time I slap you down, you praise God.
[1:43:36] Maybe I better leave you alone. You'll
[1:43:39] stop praising the Lord a little bit."
[1:43:41] Right? I think it's such a beautiful
[1:43:43] thing. And you know this this thought
[1:43:45] about
[1:43:45] election, it doesn't give us the ability
[1:43:49] doesn't give us the liberty to make
[1:43:51] grace a
[1:43:52] disgrace. And and we talked about this a
[1:43:55] little bit. Maybe we'll get into it in
[1:43:56] the future here, but you know the the
[1:43:58] difference between Calvinism and
[1:44:00] Armenianism. We can say one way that you
[1:44:03] know it's all about our works and and
[1:44:05] everything that we do is going to give
[1:44:08] us a better foothold in the kingdom of
[1:44:09] God. And the other one's going to say
[1:44:11] it's all elective love. So, you know, it
[1:44:13] doesn't matter what happens. I'm already
[1:44:16] saved. I was fornown before the
[1:44:17] foundation of the world. So, it doesn't
[1:44:19] matter if I have a little drink with
[1:44:21] supper with lunch. It's just a little
[1:44:23] bit of wine for the stomach's sake. It
[1:44:26] doesn't matter what I do. God's going to
[1:44:28] He's already saved me before the
[1:44:30] foundation of the world. So, if I do
[1:44:32] this or or whatever, we can make grace a
[1:44:36] disgrace if we're not careful. And the
[1:44:38] devil just loves to do that. He loves to
[1:44:41] do that.
[1:44:42] I think this elective love, it just
[1:44:44] gives us a clear view of our victories
[1:44:47] in the love divine, doesn't it? I'll
[1:44:49] call the musicians as I finish reading
[1:44:51] this section here, and we'll probably
[1:44:54] come back to this next week, Lord
[1:44:56] willing. As Job said, he puts strength
[1:44:59] in us. Job
[1:45:02] 23:6b. You see, he himself suffered.
[1:45:08] He learned obedience through the things
[1:45:10] that he suffered. He was actually made
[1:45:13] perfect by the things that he suffered.
[1:45:16] Hebrews 5:8-9. Though he were a son, yet
[1:45:20] learned he obedience by the things which
[1:45:23] he suffered. And being made
[1:45:26] perfect, he became the author of eternal
[1:45:29] salvation unto all them that obey him.
[1:45:33] Isn't that beautiful? In plain language,
[1:45:36] the very character of Jesus was
[1:45:40] perfected by
[1:45:43] suffering. And according to
[1:45:45] Paul, he has left his church a measure
[1:45:50] of suffering that they too by their
[1:45:53] faith in God while suffering for him
[1:45:56] would come to a place of perfection.
[1:46:00] I remember talking to an elder the one
[1:46:02] time about the suffering in my flesh
[1:46:05] specifically very specifically about
[1:46:08] me and he said you know
[1:46:11] it's it's the way it is we all have
[1:46:15] things but if it's
[1:46:18] there what would you rather
[1:46:21] have would you rather have something
[1:46:23] else something tragic or would you
[1:46:28] rather be like Paul and just glory in
[1:46:30] your infirmities because you know that
[1:46:32] God has allowed it to rest upon you so
[1:46:34] that you don't get puffed up. It really
[1:46:37] changed my perspective to be able to say
[1:46:41] my maybe it's not that bad. Maybe God
[1:46:45] knew that I would actually have this and
[1:46:47] that I would have to go through
[1:46:49] this because he knew that I would
[1:46:51] overcome it.
[1:46:53] And I think, brothers and sisters, we're
[1:46:55] not going to be overwhelmed by anything
[1:46:57] here on earth. The devil can't do
[1:47:01] it. He isn't going to leave us or
[1:47:05] forsake us. But he will allow us to go
[1:47:08] through a little bit of suffering to see
[1:47:10] his character worked out in our lives.
[1:47:13] He's left his church a measure of
[1:47:15] suffering that they too by their faith
[1:47:16] in God while suffering for him would
[1:47:19] come to a place of perfection. And like
[1:47:22] we talked about on Sunday, you know,
[1:47:23] we're not dealing with the Roman
[1:47:25] coliseum. We're not dealing with all of
[1:47:28] the evil things that happened in World
[1:47:30] War II to the people. We're not dealing
[1:47:32] with all of that that terrible, terrible
[1:47:35] things that all of our brothers and
[1:47:37] sisters had to go through. We We've got
[1:47:40] a new level of problems in our lives.
[1:47:44] But he's not He's not on vacation. He
[1:47:48] knows exactly who we are. He knows
[1:47:50] exactly where we live and he knows
[1:47:52] exactly what's in our heart even right
[1:47:56] now. He goes on to say, why did he want
[1:47:59] this? James 1:es 2 to 4. Maybe stand
[1:48:03] with me as we we close here. My
[1:48:05] brethren, count it all joy when you fall
[1:48:08] into diverse temptations,
[1:48:10] knowing this that the trying of your
[1:48:13] faith workketh patience.
[1:48:18] But let patience have her perfect work,
[1:48:20] that ye may be perfect and entire,
[1:48:24] wanting
[1:48:26] nothing. Why does he stand by? The
[1:48:29] reason is in Romans 8:17 and 18. And if
[1:48:32] children, then heirs, heirs of God, and
[1:48:35] joint hes with Christ. If so be that we
[1:48:38] suffer with him, that we may be also
[1:48:42] glorified together. For I reckon that
[1:48:44] the sufferings of this present time are
[1:48:46] not worthy to be compared to the glory
[1:48:48] which shall be revealed in us.
[1:48:53] Unless we suffer with him, we cannot
[1:48:56] reign with him.
[1:48:58] You have to suffer to reign. And you
[1:49:01] know that's the promise to the Leodysian
[1:49:05] age. He that overcomemeth will I grant
[1:49:07] to sit with me in my
[1:49:10] throne. And if we're going to reign in
[1:49:13] his throne, we're going to have to
[1:49:14] suffer. That's just the way it
[1:49:17] is. The reason for
[1:49:19] this is that character simply is never
[1:49:23] made without
[1:49:27] suffering. And if you've ever met people
[1:49:30] that have gone through
[1:49:32] stuff, tragic
[1:49:34] stuff, you can see that there's a level
[1:49:37] of character that's different than
[1:49:38] everyone else.
[1:49:42] Character is a victory, brothers and
[1:49:44] sisters.
[1:49:45] It is not a gift.
[1:49:49] A man without character can't reign
[1:49:52] because power apart from character is
[1:49:56] satanic. But power with character is fit
[1:49:59] to rule. And since he wants us to share
[1:50:03] even his throne on the same basis that
[1:50:06] he overcame and is sat down in his
[1:50:09] father's throne, then we have to
[1:50:12] overcome to sit with him. Amen.
[1:50:17] And I don't say this
[1:50:19] lightly, the little temporary suffering
[1:50:21] we go through
[1:50:23] now, I I'll say it this way. The
[1:50:27] suffering that we go through
[1:50:29] now is not worthy to be compared to the
[1:50:32] tremendous glory that shall be revealed
[1:50:36] in us when he comes. Oh, what treasures
[1:50:40] are laid up for those who are willing to
[1:50:42] enter into his kingdom through much
[1:50:46] tribulation. What a tremendous,
[1:50:50] tremendous lesson this is.
[1:50:53] I'm going to stop there tonight.
[1:50:56] And I just trust that the Lord will
[1:50:59] bless the words that were spoken.
[1:51:02] Character is a victory, brothers and
[1:51:04] sisters. And there's nobody that's
[1:51:06] getting out of
[1:51:08] here without going through the character
[1:51:10] development that we need. And once we
[1:51:13] get to that level of character
[1:51:15] development, he's going to strike the
[1:51:18] image because he sees himself. Not
[1:51:22] because we're bad, not because we did
[1:51:24] wrong. I just think it's so beautiful to
[1:51:27] be elected is God's choice. Let's just
[1:51:31] bow in prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[1:51:33] thank you for your word tonight. Thank
[1:51:36] you for your character, Lord. We know
[1:51:39] that you're working it out in each and
[1:51:40] every one of our lives, Lord. And
[1:51:42] Father, we don't glory in sin.
[1:51:47] Father, we don't accept the way that
[1:51:49] this flesh wars against the spirit.
[1:51:56] As long as we're here in this flesh,
[1:51:57] Lord, we know that we will be in a pest
[1:51:59] house. And one day, we know that you
[1:52:02] will deliver us from it, Father. Amen.
[1:52:04] Hallelujah. But Lord Jesus, as long as
[1:52:06] we're here, we just ask that you would
[1:52:09] help us, Lord, to give you the praise
[1:52:12] and the glory and the honor that you
[1:52:16] desire because we know that there's
[1:52:18] nothing that will ever be laid upon us
[1:52:20] that's too great for us, Lord. There's
[1:52:23] nothing that will ever afflict us that
[1:52:25] will truly destroy
[1:52:27] us because anything that happens to us
[1:52:30] is ordained from
[1:52:32] you. And because of
[1:52:34] that, it's creating a character that's
[1:52:37] fit to rule with you in your
[1:52:40] throne. Lord, we pray that you would
[1:52:42] just be with us as we go our separate
[1:52:44] ways tonight. Father, that you would
[1:52:45] keep your hand upon us each and every
[1:52:48] step of the way. And if it be your will
[1:52:50] for us to gather again on Sunday, Lord,
[1:52:52] we'll be careful to bring you a
[1:52:55] sacrifice of praise, Lord. A sacrifice
[1:52:58] of thanksgiving, Lord, a free will heave
[1:53:00] offering unto you, knowing that you are
[1:53:03] more than
[1:53:05] worthy, Lord. We love you and we thank
[1:53:07] you. We just commit each life into your
[1:53:09] hands now. In Jesus Christ's name we
[1:53:12] pray.
[1:53:14] Amen. Amen. My goodness. Can we sing
[1:53:18] that song? The lights of the
[1:53:21] city. The lights of the
[1:53:24] city. Please remember the prayer meeting
[1:53:26] tomorrow night, 7:30 at the church.
[1:53:32] John tells of a city that he
[1:53:38] saw coming down where no
[1:53:43] sorrow or
[1:53:45] death will be known.
[1:53:48] [Music]
[1:53:51] that
[1:53:52] someday we can go there through his
[1:53:57] marvelous grace forever
[1:54:01] live in that
[1:54:04] heavenly
[1:54:08] home. I can
[1:54:13] almost see the
[1:54:15] light of that city.
[1:54:21] All
[1:54:22] around great white
[1:54:27] throne. Through faith in my
[1:54:31] savior and his
[1:54:34] wonderful love I can almost see the
[1:54:40] light of.
[1:54:44] [Music]
[1:54:46] And sometimes when I'm burdened and my
[1:54:51] cross seems hard to bear that old Satan
[1:54:57] tries to give my
[1:55:03] view. I just look onto
[1:55:07] Jesus. He is
[1:55:09] standing close by. And once
[1:55:14] again his great light shines
[1:55:21] through. I can
[1:55:25] almost see the
[1:55:27] lights of the sea.
[1:55:30] Season of
[1:55:32] gathering all around the great white
[1:55:41] throne of my
[1:55:43] savior and his
[1:55:46] wonderful
[1:55:48] love. I can almost see the
[1:55:52] light
[1:55:56] of Can you almost see it tonight? My Can
[1:55:59] we sing? Word of God ever true. Amen.
[1:56:04] Word of God.
