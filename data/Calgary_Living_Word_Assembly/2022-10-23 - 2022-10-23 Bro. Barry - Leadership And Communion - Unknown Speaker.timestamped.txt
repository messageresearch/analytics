[50:01] [Music]
[50:09] God bless you this morning welcome to
[50:11] the house of the Lord
[50:13] certainly an honor and a privilege to
[50:15] gather together in his name his only
[50:18] provided place of worship
[50:20] certainly like to welcome all of our
[50:22] visitors today
[50:24] is that your brother Lionel
[50:26] God bless you brother
[50:29] certainly wonderful to see everyone here
[50:31] it's good to have the Snows back safely
[50:35] it's good to have the clawsons back
[50:37] safely
[50:38] it's good to have everyone back together
[50:40] once again
[50:42] my goodness
[50:43] we certainly like to just go to the Lord
[50:45] in prayer we have a couple of requests
[50:47] this morning we'd like to remember the
[50:50] otoline family
[50:52] the passing of sister Violet the the
[50:55] mother of
[50:56] sisters here in the congregation Sister
[50:59] Sarah and sister Lois and sister Rebecca
[51:03] sister Lillian as well I believe in in
[51:07] Ottawa
[51:08] and uh
[51:10] it's a very difficult situation for the
[51:13] family because sister Violet was
[51:15] actually the caregiver for
[51:17] her husband who had a stroke
[51:20] and when they were here he would come to
[51:22] church Faithfully they brought him
[51:23] Faithfully to church and he would sit in
[51:25] the front in his wheelchair and he
[51:27] couldn't even raise his hands but he
[51:29] would certainly just Worship the Lord
[51:32] so now uh it's a tremendous burden I can
[51:35] only imagine on the family we just want
[51:37] to remember the old lean family for the
[51:39] leadership of the Lord
[51:41] great for traveling mercies for the
[51:42] sisters sister Rebecca and sister Lois
[51:45] are in Ottawa right now so if you want
[51:47] to go and visit them here you won't be
[51:50] able to catch them they left for
[51:52] Edmonton straight away and uh
[51:55] Sister Sarah actually went to Nigeria
[51:58] straight away so all of the sisters are
[52:00] traveling to be with their family right
[52:03] now and we just trust the Lord's will be
[52:05] done in their life
[52:07] but also remember like to like to
[52:09] remember the youth league you take
[52:11] you'll take family brother Mike you'll
[52:14] take and his wife were in a terrible car
[52:16] accident this week and he's in uh
[52:19] intensive care
[52:20] in uh pretty tough shape he needs a
[52:23] touch from the Lord now
[52:26] and if you have a need this morning
[52:27] maybe just make it known unto him with
[52:29] an uplift hand as we go to him
[52:31] a gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus
[52:35] we just want to thank you for your grace
[52:37] and your mercy to us Lord your goodness
[52:39] and your Tender Mercies father
[52:41] Lord we know that every single
[52:43] circumstance in every single situation
[52:45] that we encounter here on this side of
[52:48] Eternity is for your purpose Lord
[52:51] we know that all things work together
[52:52] for the good to those who are called
[52:55] for those who are chosen according to
[52:57] your plan from before the foundation of
[52:59] the world and Lord Jesus we just thank
[53:02] you for the many trials the many
[53:04] circumstances in our lives because we
[53:06] know that they are presented to us
[53:09] father to express your life through ours
[53:12] father we pray for the old lean family
[53:14] this morning Lord Jesus we're so
[53:16] thankful for the the testimony of sister
[53:18] Violet otoline Lord Jesus father to see
[53:22] the daughters that she raised Lord is a
[53:24] true testimony of her life father Lord
[53:27] Jesus we know that she's gone on to your
[53:29] house today Father Lord we just pray
[53:32] that you would be a comfort for the
[53:33] family Lord Jesus that you would lead

[56:17] musicians
[56:18] certainly appreciate each one
[56:21] thing of their gift if you have your
[56:23] Bibles this morning I want to make a
[56:25] little bit of a change in direction from
[56:27] Joshua we've come to the end of the Book
[56:29] of Joshua but I don't think it will ever
[56:32] end it will continually go on because
[56:34] it's moving forward into our Promised
[56:36] Land turn with me this morning to the
[56:38] Book of Genesis chapter 12.
[56:41] I want to talk a little bit about
[56:43] Abraham Abram at this point he hadn't
[56:47] received a name change
[56:50] but Abram Genesis chapter 12.
[57:05] Genesis chapter 12 verse 1.
[57:09] says now the Lord had said unto Abram
[57:13] get thee out of thy country
[57:16] and from thy kindred
[57:18] and from thy father's house
[57:20] unto a land that I will show thee
[57:24] and I will make thee make of thee a
[57:26] great nation and I will bless thee
[57:29] and make thy name great and thou shalt
[57:33] be a blessing
[57:34] and I will bless them that bless thee
[57:37] and I will curse him that curseth thee
[57:40] and in thee shall all the families of
[57:43] the earth be blessed
[57:45] so Abraham departed as the Lord had
[57:48] spoken unto him and lot went with him
[57:50] and Abram was 70 and five years old when
[57:54] he departed out of heron
[57:56] and Abram took Sarai his wife
[58:00] and lot his brother's son
[58:02] and all their substance that they had
[58:04] gathered
[58:05] and the souls that they had gotten in
[58:07] haran
[58:09] and they went forth to go into the land
[58:11] of Canaan
[58:13] and into the land of Canaan they came
[58:16] let's just bow in prayer one more time
[58:19] gracious Lord Jesus we thank you for
[58:21] this word thank you for your leadership
[58:23] Lord Jesus we thank you Father that we
[58:26] are able to through your leadership
[58:29] father have true communion with you and
[58:32] Lord Jesus we pray that this morning you
[58:34] would just serve us the bread and the
[58:36] wine father that you would break this
[58:39] bread of life open to us once again
[58:41] father that you would have just enough
[58:42] to serve us father to sustain us to take
[58:45] us Lord Jesus a little further into
[58:48] canaan's Fair land lord God we pray that
[58:51] you would just be glorified with all
[58:52] that said and done now father that I
[58:54] could get out of the way and that you
[58:55] could just have the preeminence father
[58:57] that you could speak now in Jesus
[58:59] Christ's name we pray amen bless you
[59:02] this morning you may be seated
[59:07] certainly wonderful to see the change in
[59:10] seasons

[59:17] thankful for it
[59:19] not really excited about winter just yet

[59:24] I think we should have some nice
[59:25] temperatures this next week and we'll
[59:28] just see what the Lord has in store
[59:30] we certainly had a nice time of
[59:31] Fellowship on Friday evening with all

[1:01:24] that banquet look for them on the youth
[1:01:26] chat and we'll go from there are you
[1:01:29] happy this morning
[1:01:31] it's wonderful to be in the house of the
[1:01:32] Lord we were just mentioning it on the
[1:01:35] way in here you know one of these days
[1:01:37] it's just going to break Eternal bright
[1:01:39] and fair
[1:01:40] and we won't have to go through another
[1:01:43] service we won't have to go to another
[1:01:45] day of work we won't have to go and and
[1:01:48] deal with school again we won't have to
[1:01:50] go and deal with all the the toils of
[1:01:52] this life
[1:01:53] you know brothers and sisters one of
[1:01:55] these days it's going to change forever
[1:01:57] and it's never been as close as it is
[1:01:59] today
[1:02:00] and you know all of the Saints of all of
[1:02:02] the ages have looked towards this day
[1:02:05] and this is the day that the Lord hath
[1:02:07] made and we have the opportunity to
[1:02:10] rejoice and just be glad in it he's
[1:02:12] chosen us to be the ones to cross the
[1:02:14] finish line what a tremendous blessing
[1:02:17] it is
[1:02:18] I uh I just felt led to to get into a
[1:02:21] discussion about Abram Abraham
[1:02:25] and ultimately
[1:02:27] basically leadership and communion if I
[1:02:30] had to title it it would be leadership
[1:02:32] and communion and I believe it'll be uh
[1:02:35] probably a little while we'll talk about
[1:02:37] this there's so much in here but you
[1:02:39] know just at the very end of the
[1:02:41] prophet's message the message that God
[1:02:44] gave the prophet God's message to the
[1:02:47] last age God's message to the world
[1:02:49] through the seventh angel messenger the
[1:02:52] second last recorded message was
[1:02:54] leadership
[1:02:55] being able to be led and then the last
[1:02:59] one was communion and and it was in that
[1:03:01] order on purpose it wasn't accidental
[1:03:04] whether Branham didn't just decide one
[1:03:06] day well maybe we'll just try this and
[1:03:08] see what happens no no that was just as
[1:03:10] he was going off the air as he said in
[1:03:12] the in the invisible Union of the Bride
[1:03:14] this is my message to the church it
[1:03:16] wasn't brother branham's message to the
[1:03:18] church it was God's message to the
[1:03:20] church just just look up because one of
[1:03:22] these days the fire is going to fall and
[1:03:25] you are actually the sinless Spotless
[1:03:28] virtuous bride of Jesus Christ you never
[1:03:31] did it in the from the beginning you
[1:03:33] never did it imagine if you could go
[1:03:35] forward spiritually and just say you
[1:03:37] know what I can't fail I'm here to say
[1:03:39] this morning which we already know you
[1:03:41] can't fail
[1:03:43] you can't fail spiritually brothers and
[1:03:45] sisters
[1:03:46] God has already created you before the
[1:03:49] foundation of the world to be a part of
[1:03:51] him and he cannot fail he's God so if
[1:03:54] you come from him before the foundation
[1:03:56] of the world ain't no devil that can
[1:03:58] stand in your way
[1:04:00] they're going to come around and they're
[1:04:01] going to try and harass us every single
[1:04:03] day every single hour of every single
[1:04:05] day but you are already virtuous you're
[1:04:08] already spotless you're already the
[1:04:11] sinless Spotless bride of Jesus Christ
[1:04:13] that he has carefully Chosen and
[1:04:16] positionally placed to be wherever it is
[1:04:18] that we live wherever it is we're at
[1:04:20] whatever it is we're going through his
[1:04:22] choice
[1:04:24] not ours but we're just able to say Amen
[1:04:27] to it we're just able to say be it unto
[1:04:28] me Lord according to Thy Word
[1:04:31] I just want to be all that you created
[1:04:33] me to be
[1:04:35] and that's what I think the story of of
[1:04:37] Abram and Abraham is is going to really
[1:04:41] get into because God saw
[1:04:44] Abram when he was a heathen
[1:04:47] he was even a gentile is my
[1:04:50] understanding of this
[1:04:51] in in Genesis chapter 12 God calls him
[1:04:55] to get thee out of thy country and from
[1:04:58] thy kindred
[1:05:00] and from thy Father's House unto a land
[1:05:02] that I will show thee he didn't even
[1:05:04] know where he was going but God said
[1:05:06] just you know what grab your backpack
[1:05:08] get get your get your luggage get all
[1:05:10] your stuff ready and just follow me
[1:05:13] don't don't don't worry about your
[1:05:15] father's house don't worry about your
[1:05:16] father's lineage get away from your
[1:05:18] Kindred get away from all of your
[1:05:20] Traditions get away from all of it and
[1:05:22] just come and follow me and now he had
[1:05:25] the opportunity to either accept that
[1:05:27] leadership or to reject that leadership
[1:05:30] because it was a personal revelation to
[1:05:32] him it doesn't say that God spoke to all
[1:05:35] of his Kindred and his father it doesn't
[1:05:38] even say that God spoke to lot
[1:05:40] but we know that Abram must have spoken
[1:05:42] to lot to say hey I've got a leadership
[1:05:44] something's going on in my life God's
[1:05:46] called me
[1:05:47] no doubt lot probably said to him who's
[1:05:49] God
[1:05:50] we've got God Gods what are you talking
[1:05:53] about Abram are you sure you're okay in
[1:05:55] the head are you feeling okay
[1:05:58] but he was so convinced
[1:06:01] he was concerned to do something about
[1:06:03] it
[1:06:06] but God said get thee out of thy country
[1:06:07] and and from thy Kindred and from my
[1:06:10] father's house into a lamb that I will
[1:06:11] show thee and I will make a great nation
[1:06:14] and I will bless thee and make thee thy
[1:06:16] name great and thou shalt be a blessing
[1:06:18] and I will bless them that bless thee
[1:06:20] and curse him that curseth thee and we
[1:06:24] know that that's a scripture that the
[1:06:26] United States of America has applied
[1:06:27] very strongly and many nations around
[1:06:30] the world have done that but it's still
[1:06:32] enforced today that very scripture right
[1:06:34] there but look at the last part of this
[1:06:36] scripture here this this verse 3 and in
[1:06:39] the
[1:06:40] shall all the families of the earth be
[1:06:43] blessed
[1:06:44] not just some of them not just the
[1:06:46] Hebrew families not just the Jews not
[1:06:48] just the ones who are in the promised
[1:06:50] land not just the ones who are Jews in
[1:06:52] another land
[1:06:53] all the families of the Earth every one
[1:06:57] of them will be blessed Because of You
[1:06:58] Abram because you were willing to follow
[1:07:01] the leadership of the Lord you were not
[1:07:03] willing to compromise and say well I'll
[1:07:05] follow you but I'm going to drag a
[1:07:07] little bit of my father's tradition and
[1:07:09] I'm just going to bring a little bit of
[1:07:10] my Kindred with me we know that Abram he
[1:07:14] followed the Lord he left he took lot
[1:07:17] was the son of haran it was his his
[1:07:20] brother Abram's brother and Heron died
[1:07:24] so a lot was kind of an orphan and the
[1:07:27] uncle he felt for him and he said hey
[1:07:29] I've got this blessing the Lord's called
[1:07:31] me he's he's leading me and I've got
[1:07:32] enough victuals for everything I can
[1:07:34] give you work and cattle and sheep and
[1:07:36] oxen and just just come with me and I'll
[1:07:38] make sure you looked after but that
[1:07:40] wasn't what God Said God said Abram you
[1:07:43] come and we know that when he took lot
[1:07:45] as long as lot was with him there was
[1:07:48] Strife in the camp brother Bradham
[1:07:50] brings it out he talks about it and he
[1:07:51] said that God didn't even talk to him
[1:07:53] again until he separated with lot God
[1:07:56] allowed there to be Strife between the
[1:07:58] herdsmen they actually were able to
[1:08:00] recognize there was there was a problem
[1:08:01] we can't stick together we've got to do
[1:08:04] something about this we've got to
[1:08:05] separate
[1:08:07] and through that
[1:08:09] Abram got back to where he was supposed
[1:08:11] to be on his own with God
[1:08:14] and as soon as he was God spoke to him
[1:08:16] again
[1:08:17] and and gave him a little bit more of
[1:08:19] encouragement a little bit more of
[1:08:21] Direction and that's what it takes
[1:08:22] brothers and sisters for us in our day
[1:08:24] is we've got to be willing to follow the
[1:08:26] leadership of the lord we can't just
[1:08:27] come to a communion service and say that
[1:08:29] I've got communion we can't just come to
[1:08:31] a service and say that I've got
[1:08:32] communion with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:33] because I believe God sent a prophet we
[1:08:36] have got to follow the leadership of the
[1:08:38] Lord in our lives according to the word
[1:08:40] for our day in order to have true
[1:08:42] communion because communion is actually
[1:08:44] the relationship it's the most intimate
[1:08:47] relationship that we could ever have to
[1:08:49] have communion with the Lord Jesus
[1:08:51] Christ having a husband and a wife
[1:08:53] relation is one thing it's very intimate
[1:08:56] it's very close and nobody knows us like
[1:08:58] our spouses do oh my but when we go just
[1:09:01] a little step further and get into
[1:09:02] spiritual communion brothers and sisters
[1:09:04] That's Where It's At that's where it's
[1:09:06] the most intimate out of every single
[1:09:08] relationship we could ever have
[1:09:10] but when we can get to that place my
[1:09:13] nothing really matters it doesn't really
[1:09:16] upset us what's going on nothing really
[1:09:18] matters because we understand our
[1:09:19] husband's completely in control it's
[1:09:21] nothing out of control there's nothing
[1:09:22] out of kilter many times it will look
[1:09:24] like this world is falling apart the
[1:09:26] Devils will come and make it look like
[1:09:27] the world is falling apart they'll
[1:09:29] actually show us literally that the
[1:09:31] world is falling apart but does that
[1:09:33] mean that it is
[1:09:35] even if it is it doesn't matter
[1:09:37] because we know who who our husband is
[1:09:39] we know exactly who our relationship is
[1:09:41] with and because of that we have a peace
[1:09:44] that passes all understanding when we
[1:09:46] have a true leadership of the Lord Jesus
[1:09:48] Christ then we know our position in
[1:09:50] Christ
[1:09:52] and this is something that we've been
[1:09:53] getting into and I just think it's
[1:09:55] beautiful and I can see how it's kind of
[1:09:57] coming together but you know what is our
[1:09:59] position in Christ brothers and sisters
[1:10:01] it's one thing to say that we've got a
[1:10:03] great position in Christ and a great
[1:10:04] Revelation from Jesus Christ but if
[1:10:06] we've got a great position in Christ and
[1:10:09] a great Revelation from Jesus Christ
[1:10:10] about the word and and how we fit into
[1:10:13] the word then we're going to be exactly
[1:10:15] according to the word in our families
[1:10:19] when we're a husband we're going to be a
[1:10:20] word husband when we're a wife we're
[1:10:23] going to be a word wife when we're when
[1:10:25] we're a child we're going to be a child
[1:10:27] according to the word we're not going to
[1:10:30] be living Our Lives some other way we're
[1:10:33] going to be exactly according to the
[1:10:34] word we're going to follow the
[1:10:35] leadership of the word for our day
[1:10:38] you know brother Bradham he brought that
[1:10:40] out very clearly
[1:10:42] throughout the message of the hour
[1:10:43] Ephesians chapter 5 we've been talking
[1:10:46] about that for a long time how important
[1:10:48] it is to recognize our position in the
[1:10:50] body what's our position in the body
[1:10:52] what's our position in our family
[1:10:54] because the family is what makes up the
[1:10:56] body
[1:10:58] and if we're not dealing with our
[1:10:59] families then are we dealing with our
[1:11:01] bodies
[1:11:03] it's one thing to come to church but we
[1:11:05] need to make sure that we're actually
[1:11:07] the Christians that we come to church as
[1:11:10] when we're at home we need to be the
[1:11:12] same people
[1:11:14] but looking at the leadership of the
[1:11:16] Lord in our lives Abram was given this
[1:11:18] leadership and he followed it and as
[1:11:20] long as he followed it God blessed him
[1:11:22] God spoke to him God God showed him that
[1:11:25] there is a promise coming for you in
[1:11:27] your life and and Abram he accepted the
[1:11:30] leadership
[1:11:31] and he took a long lot even though God
[1:11:34] didn't call him he took lot because he
[1:11:36] felt for him and many times we have
[1:11:38] situations where we we want to do
[1:11:40] something maybe just a little bit more
[1:11:42] maybe just a little bit different than
[1:11:44] what the leadership of the Lord is and
[1:11:45] you know God won't won't curse us for it
[1:11:48] but we might not actually hear from him
[1:11:50] as long as we stay in that position
[1:11:52] where we're just a little bit outside of
[1:11:54] his word but then when we get back in
[1:11:57] line with his word according to the
[1:11:59] direction that he's given us then he'll
[1:12:01] speak to us again
[1:12:04] you know brother Branham he says
[1:12:06] that
[1:12:08] lot
[1:12:09] even though a lot we know the story
[1:12:11] about lot I'm not going to go too far
[1:12:12] into that today but after the herdsmen
[1:12:15] had strife and God allowed the situation
[1:12:18] to come to a head in the family we know
[1:12:21] that lot was actually a little bit
[1:12:23] entitled wasn't he
[1:12:25] because Abram was the one that actually
[1:12:26] saved him Abraham was the one that
[1:12:28] actually brought him out and and allowed
[1:12:30] him to increase and and have all of his
[1:12:32] Goods but then suddenly there's this big
[1:12:34] problem with his uncle
[1:12:36] and instead of just humbling himself
[1:12:38] having the the the surrender to the
[1:12:41] leadership the headship of his uncle
[1:12:43] respecting him
[1:12:44] what did they do they they clashed but
[1:12:47] it wasn't an accident it was so that God
[1:12:49] could separate his son separate the
[1:12:52] chosen one so that that promise could
[1:12:54] come to pass in his life and as long as
[1:12:55] he stayed in that position
[1:12:58] he wasn't able to be blessed
[1:13:00] but brother Branham said even though
[1:13:02] Abram Abraham was a silver dollar in
[1:13:05] God's economy lot was a penny
[1:13:09] okay so it's interesting when we look at
[1:13:11] it brothers and sisters we can see
[1:13:12] people in our lives and maybe we'll have
[1:13:15] a a a a notion about what sort of uh
[1:13:19] denomination they are in God's economy
[1:13:21] we don't want to do that we don't want
[1:13:23] to do that that's between them and God
[1:13:25] the only thing we want to do is make
[1:13:27] sure that we know what we are
[1:13:29] if we're a silver dollar then we want to
[1:13:31] make sure we stay a shiny silver dollar
[1:13:33] we don't want to be tarnished if we're a
[1:13:36] quarter be a quarter if we're a nickel
[1:13:37] be a nickel
[1:13:39] and I would say this if you're a penny
[1:13:40] just be a penny and it's up to us to
[1:13:43] make sure that we don't judge anybody we
[1:13:46] just want to make sure that we keep
[1:13:47] ourselves clean
[1:13:49] don't want to judge anybody
[1:13:51] but Abraham he didn't hear Abram he
[1:13:53] didn't hear from God again until he
[1:13:55] parted ways with lot
[1:13:57] and we know that lot he was gravitated
[1:13:59] directly to the most Naturally Speaking
[1:14:02] uh
[1:14:04] affluent areas he had to go for the the
[1:14:07] planes where all the water was and and
[1:14:09] Sodom and all the riches were and and
[1:14:12] Naturally Speaking he went for the best
[1:14:15] but we know that brother Bradham said
[1:14:16] Abram he just stayed out in the desert
[1:14:18] he said it's okay I know God will look
[1:14:20] after me I I know that God's called me
[1:14:22] and and he'll provide every single need
[1:14:24] that I've got I don't have to worry
[1:14:25] about it
[1:14:27] you know just sort of doing a high level
[1:14:30] flyover today I think we'll probably dig
[1:14:32] in and get a little further into this as
[1:14:34] we go but looking at this Abram
[1:14:37] dealing with lot
[1:14:39] over in chapter 13.
[1:14:42] is where lot and Abram separated
[1:14:45] Abram said to lot you know when there
[1:14:47] was Strife between the herdsmen he said
[1:14:50] to him in verse 8 of 13 and Abram said
[1:14:52] unto lot let there be no Strife I pray
[1:14:54] thee between me and thee
[1:14:57] remember it was the herdsmen that were
[1:14:59] actually upset but here we have Abram
[1:15:01] identifying no it's not just a herdsman
[1:15:03] it's between me and the why do we have
[1:15:05] this just let's not have any Strife I
[1:15:08] pray thee between me and thee and and
[1:15:10] between my herdmen and thy herdmen for
[1:15:12] we be brethren
[1:15:15] just go and choose whatever way you want
[1:15:17] to lot and and and God will bless you
[1:15:19] and and whatever way you go I'll go the
[1:15:22] opposite way we'll just we'll just part
[1:15:24] ways here but we're Brethren let's
[1:15:25] remain that way
[1:15:27] and isn't it interesting because even
[1:15:29] though he had the leadership to actually
[1:15:31] part ways that way and to say just go
[1:15:33] whatever way you want lot go get
[1:15:35] whatever you want and I'll go the other
[1:15:36] way even though he did that then God
[1:15:39] allowed a test to come his way didn't he
[1:15:40] look he went down to Sodom and no doubt
[1:15:43] Abram knew what was in Sodom no doubt
[1:15:46] lot knew what was in Sodom they were
[1:15:48] aware of what was going on there and
[1:15:50] still that's what lot wanted to do and
[1:15:52] we know it wasn't good that was where
[1:15:54] lot vexed his righteous Soul daily with
[1:15:56] the things he saw and he heard
[1:15:58] it wasn't a good place but they were
[1:16:01] rich and increased with goods and had
[1:16:03] need of nothing
[1:16:05] but here we have Abram saying unto him
[1:16:08] just go don't worry about it let's just
[1:16:09] not have Strife because we're Brethren
[1:16:11] remember we're brethren we are Brethren
[1:16:14] that's the Baseline it's tremendous
[1:16:16] we're all a part of God's economy
[1:16:18] but as they went forwards
[1:16:21] as brethren we know that lot found
[1:16:25] himself in a lot of trouble
[1:16:28] he found himself actually captured by
[1:16:31] the Kings they came and tossed the
[1:16:32] cities and they took all of the goods
[1:16:35] and they took all of the people and and
[1:16:37] lot found himself in a position where he
[1:16:40] didn't know what to do no doubt he was
[1:16:42] wondering about that God that Abraham
[1:16:44] had no doubt he was praying to that God
[1:16:47] that Abraham knew he was saying where's
[1:16:50] that God of my uncle and what happened
[1:16:52] now Abraham was given the opportunity to
[1:16:54] say oh that poor kid I knew that he was
[1:16:56] gonna I knew it was going to be a
[1:16:58] problem now God teach him a lesson let
[1:17:01] him have it
[1:17:02] let them have it he deserves it he
[1:17:05] didn't he didn't listen he wanted to
[1:17:06] have Strife even though we're Brethren I
[1:17:08] was good to him I brought him up and out
[1:17:10] I helped him when his father was was
[1:17:12] done and now he's actually gonna get it
[1:17:15] he's gonna get what he deserved how many
[1:17:18] times as Believers can we potentially do
[1:17:20] that to one another we don't want to do
[1:17:22] that but he didn't this is what I'm
[1:17:24] saying God because of the leadership now
[1:17:26] God gave him the test to prove it isn't
[1:17:29] it interesting how Abram's life was just
[1:17:31] a series of tests all the way along do
[1:17:34] you trust me Abram do you trust me Abram
[1:17:36] do you trust me Abram and what did he do
[1:17:38] he knew exactly who he was he knew
[1:17:40] exactly where he stood he knew exactly
[1:17:42] who called him and he went forward he
[1:17:45] took all the trained men from his house
[1:17:46] they rose up and they went after the
[1:17:48] Kings and and they got lots and they got
[1:17:51] all the people and they got all the
[1:17:53] goods we know the story I'm sorry I'm
[1:17:56] going into it I didn't really intend to
[1:17:57] but here we are so they they go and and
[1:18:00] he rescues a lot and he takes him out
[1:18:03] from from this terrible situation and
[1:18:05] the kings of Sodom they they say you
[1:18:07] know what just just take all the goods
[1:18:09] give us the people and and and we'll be
[1:18:11] good we're so thankful for everything
[1:18:13] that you've done and what did what did
[1:18:15] Abram say to him you know what I'm not
[1:18:16] interested in one bit of money from you
[1:18:18] I don't want any of the goods because
[1:18:20] you're going to turn around and say that
[1:18:22] you blessed me that you made me Rich no
[1:18:24] way it was the most high God that has
[1:18:27] blessed me he's the only one that's ever
[1:18:29] blessed me and he's the only one that
[1:18:31] will ever bless me if I have anything
[1:18:33] good in my life it's because of him not
[1:18:36] you
[1:18:37] he made it very clear where he stood
[1:18:40] with those men and he said you know what
[1:18:42] if you want to do something hey just
[1:18:43] cover the cost put the gas in my vehicle
[1:18:45] for for driving to come and rescue you
[1:18:47] guys feed feed the men that actually put
[1:18:50] money out of their pocket to come and
[1:18:51] rescue you guys you can just look after
[1:18:52] them but I'm good it's for me and my
[1:18:54] house we we we're fine
[1:18:57] but isn't it interesting it was only
[1:18:59] then after the leadership of the Lord
[1:19:01] that he really actually had separated
[1:19:04] himself from all of the worldly items he
[1:19:08] he really consecrated himself and then
[1:19:11] the true test came to actually go and
[1:19:14] save his brother or not true truly prove
[1:19:16] whether they were brothers or not and
[1:19:18] through that test he was able to
[1:19:20] demonstrate they were brothers and what
[1:19:22] was the very next thing after the
[1:19:24] slaughter of the kings that happened it
[1:19:26] was that Melchizedek the priest of the
[1:19:28] most high God came and actually served
[1:19:30] him Bread and Wine served him communion
[1:19:32] but brothers and sisters it didn't come
[1:19:34] without the test right communion true
[1:19:37] communion from God never comes without a
[1:19:40] test we will always be tested we will
[1:19:43] always be tried in our lives our
[1:19:45] spiritual walk it's not the trials of
[1:19:47] our life it's not the trials of our jobs
[1:19:49] and the trials of our education and the
[1:19:51] trials of our health it's the trials of
[1:19:53] our faith that's the thing that's more
[1:19:56] precious than pure gold in our lives
[1:19:59] that's the thing that the devil wants to
[1:20:01] do is try our faith
[1:20:03] he'll bring us up he'll bring us down
[1:20:05] he'll drag us through the mud brother
[1:20:06] Branham says it in adoption you know the
[1:20:09] Tudor we've talked about this but isn't
[1:20:11] it interesting how he says it the tutor
[1:20:13] he can take the story back to the father
[1:20:15] to say you know what I've I've let him
[1:20:17] go to the hospital and and has turned
[1:20:20] his wife against him and and he's been
[1:20:21] kicked out of the church and he's had
[1:20:23] all these different things happen to him
[1:20:24] but he still says praise the Lord he
[1:20:26] still wants to serve God he doesn't want
[1:20:28] to change one bit in fact he actually
[1:20:30] worships a little louder when the
[1:20:32] problems come around he doesn't give up
[1:20:34] and change his attitude because of the
[1:20:36] circumstances he pushes harder
[1:20:42] when we've had the test we're able to
[1:20:44] have the communion but my when we're
[1:20:46] able to have the community and look back
[1:20:48] at the test and say God tested me so
[1:20:50] that I could actually prove him at his
[1:20:52] word in this moment oh my we have reason
[1:20:55] to shout brothers and sisters remember I
[1:20:58] just want to encourage it and and maybe
[1:20:59] people think I'm a little Pentecostal
[1:21:01] maybe I have a little slant that way but
[1:21:03] this is the quietest place we're ever
[1:21:05] going to be up there we're going to be
[1:21:07] shouting with all of our might because
[1:21:09] we know we made it we're redeemed and we
[1:21:11] never deserved it for one second we
[1:21:13] should have died oh but he gave us he
[1:21:16] gave us the invitation to come up to his
[1:21:18] house he chose us in him before the
[1:21:21] foundation of the world and the other
[1:21:22] side of it is down there they're going
[1:21:24] to be saying I could have sat in a
[1:21:26] message church I could have had my
[1:21:27] parents they preached the message of the
[1:21:29] hour to me and I rejected it it was
[1:21:32] there and I rejected it
[1:21:35] maybe my neighbor they were a little
[1:21:37] fanatical and they talked about this
[1:21:39] this seventh angel messenger and I
[1:21:41] didn't listen
[1:21:42] it's going to be loud down there two
[1:21:44] brothers and sisters right here we've
[1:21:46] got the opportunity to Rejoice we don't
[1:21:49] have to wait until eternity to start the
[1:21:51] Everlasting song we can start right now
[1:21:56] but you know communion
[1:21:58] communion is a very special thing the
[1:22:00] first communion was with Melchizedek
[1:22:02] coming down after the slaughter of the
[1:22:04] Kings and and presenting the bread and
[1:22:07] the wine after the test and we know
[1:22:09] brothers and sisters after the test in
[1:22:11] our lives those Dark Lonely Nights the
[1:22:13] sun rises in the morning and and
[1:22:15] Melchizedek himself comes to us if we're
[1:22:17] willing to just pass the test if we're
[1:22:20] willing to just stand the test if we're
[1:22:22] willing to not give up a not waver if
[1:22:24] we're willing to Just Praise as the word
[1:22:27] instructs us through our trials not get
[1:22:30] mopey and and complain through our
[1:22:32] trials
[1:22:33] that's not what the word says and so
[1:22:36] what happens when we do that we get
[1:22:38] another trial
[1:22:40] and then if we do it again we get
[1:22:42] another trial
[1:22:44] and if we do it again we get another
[1:22:45] trial
[1:22:46] he wants to see us rejoice remember
[1:22:48] brother Bradham says it that the devil
[1:22:50] will come to a place it'll come to a
[1:22:52] place in the lives of a True Believer
[1:22:54] when the devil just don't know what to
[1:22:55] do with you
[1:22:56] he just don't know what to do with the
[1:22:58] bride of Jesus Christ because she she's
[1:23:00] stronger than the circumstances stronger
[1:23:02] than the problems and she knows that she
[1:23:04] isn't but he is and he's the one who's
[1:23:06] in control of every situation
[1:23:10] but we know that Melchizedek came down
[1:23:12] and served communion
[1:23:14] for the first time to Abram
[1:23:18] after the trial after the slaughter of
[1:23:20] the Kings not before
[1:23:22] sometimes I feel like we can come to
[1:23:25] church and try and have communion with
[1:23:28] the Lord Jesus Christ without actually
[1:23:30] doing what we need to do and you know
[1:23:33] there's no no patents Penance maybe I'm
[1:23:36] not saying it right there's no way that
[1:23:37] we can earn our way into communion with
[1:23:40] God what I'm talking about brothers and
[1:23:42] sisters is the true communion of the
[1:23:44] Lord Jesus Christ is to be completely
[1:23:46] sold out to him to actually not hold on
[1:23:48] to anything from our father's house to
[1:23:51] not to not have anything from our
[1:23:53] father's Kindred to have no tradition to
[1:23:56] have no Gods no Idols remember in the
[1:23:59] last chapter of Joshua the one of the
[1:24:01] last addresses of Joshua and of God
[1:24:04] through Joshua said to the people before
[1:24:06] he died before he went off the scene put
[1:24:08] away the gods of your fathers
[1:24:10] don't have any Traditions don't have
[1:24:13] anything that will get in the way of
[1:24:15] mixing with this word for your day
[1:24:16] because if you do you'll die
[1:24:19] and it's the same thing today brothers
[1:24:20] and sisters we're talking about the
[1:24:22] promised land the Lord Jesus Christ if
[1:24:24] we're thinking that we can just say I
[1:24:25] could just pick and choose like a buffet
[1:24:27] table of the message of the hour and
[1:24:29] I'll just leave the things that I don't
[1:24:30] like and I'll take the things that I
[1:24:31] like and I'll say God bless you God sent
[1:24:33] a prophet it won't turn out right we've
[1:24:36] got to take the whole Buffet we have to
[1:24:38] eat it all because he told John take the
[1:24:41] book and eat it up and it will be sweet
[1:24:44] as honey in your mouth but it will make
[1:24:45] your belly bitter the reason it makes
[1:24:47] your belly bitter is because this flesh
[1:24:49] can't stand it there's no flesh that
[1:24:51] will actually live and see God that's
[1:24:53] why it can't stand it but boy oh boy
[1:24:55] when we eat this book brothers and
[1:24:57] sisters it changes our very fiber and
[1:24:59] one day it's going to actually change
[1:25:01] it's going to make that Revelation so
[1:25:03] strong in our lives it's going to change
[1:25:04] our body and remember that's what we're
[1:25:06] after we're after rapturing faith that
[1:25:09] Faith that's greater than any faith of
[1:25:11] every age brother Bradham says it's
[1:25:12] going to take more faith than any other
[1:25:14] age in this age in which we live in
[1:25:16] because we're looking for a body change
[1:25:18] and the only way we're going to get that
[1:25:19] body changes to eat the whole book and
[1:25:23] the whole book is the message of the
[1:25:25] hour including the Bible because the
[1:25:27] message of the hour points to the Bible
[1:25:29] and you know I'll go even further with
[1:25:31] that and say the message of the hour is
[1:25:33] the Bible because in the beginning was
[1:25:36] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:25:38] the Word was God and the Word was made
[1:25:40] flesh and dwelt Among Us and I would say
[1:25:42] that right now the word has been made
[1:25:44] flesh and is dwelling Among Us brothers
[1:25:46] and sisters through us
[1:25:51] then we know that there was another
[1:25:53] communion served
[1:25:55] in the upper room
[1:25:56] and I want to say it this way we know
[1:25:59] that it was the word that was made flesh
[1:26:00] dwelling Among Us that came to serve
[1:26:02] communion but I'll say it this way and I
[1:26:04] think brother Branagh might somewhere I
[1:26:06] could be wrong with it but it was
[1:26:07] Melchizedek that came and served that
[1:26:09] communion to the the boys in the upper
[1:26:11] room the disciples in the upper room
[1:26:13] because we know that Melchizedek was
[1:26:15] actually a type of Jesus Christ because
[1:26:18] what what's the word say about him that
[1:26:20] he was he was without dissent
[1:26:23] without father without mother
[1:26:26] he wasn't a normal human being he wasn't
[1:26:29] someone that we can tangibly say well
[1:26:30] you know he's from here and and he was
[1:26:33] you know brought up under someone and
[1:26:36] and did this and that and the other no
[1:26:37] we know that he was very God himself
[1:26:39] that came down and who was Jesus Christ
[1:26:42] we know that Jesus Christ was very God
[1:26:44] he's not a different man the the this is
[1:26:47] the difference between the the penny and
[1:26:49] the silver dollar I'll say it this way
[1:26:51] because the penny he said my lords
[1:26:54] right the silver dollar said Lord he
[1:26:57] recognized Elohim when he came to visit
[1:27:00] in the plains of mammary when he came to
[1:27:02] tell him personally he didn't just send
[1:27:04] a messenger he came himself and said oh
[1:27:08] my I'm about to visit you according to
[1:27:10] the time of life and we know that his
[1:27:12] wife laughed
[1:27:13] she said how could I have pleasure with
[1:27:15] my Lord
[1:27:17] even she said it my Lord
[1:27:20] but we know that there was a a there was
[1:27:22] a communion that was served again just
[1:27:25] sort of running with the the pattern
[1:27:27] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:27:29] and forever there was a communion that
[1:27:31] was served to the disciples in in the
[1:27:33] upper room as the last supper and and we
[1:27:36] know that that is a a such a significant
[1:27:39] event to the life of a True Believer
[1:27:42] because it's one of the ordinances that
[1:27:43] was given to us as Believers of this
[1:27:45] message of the hour and that is to have
[1:27:47] communion and we know that communion is
[1:27:50] a very intimate thing and we come to the
[1:27:53] communion table because it's an outward
[1:27:55] expression of the inward work we know
[1:27:58] that we're not interested in letting
[1:28:00] things come in our lives and become a
[1:28:03] root of bitterness so much that it would
[1:28:05] keep us from coming to that table
[1:28:06] because if I can't come to that table
[1:28:08] then I'm not going to see the full
[1:28:10] benefit of this word in my day
[1:28:13] so we take the opportunity to come to
[1:28:16] communion whenever we get the
[1:28:17] opportunity
[1:28:18] and if something is wrong in our lives
[1:28:20] brothers and sisters we just need to go
[1:28:21] make it right don't let anything get in
[1:28:23] the way of you and that communion table
[1:28:25] because the word of God says that many
[1:28:27] are weak and sickly among you
[1:28:30] many
[1:28:31] sleep
[1:28:32] many suffer
[1:28:34] because they don't take this this
[1:28:36] communion serious
[1:28:37] you know we can't have this communion
[1:28:39] this sweet relationship this intimacy
[1:28:42] with the Lord Jesus Christ if we're not
[1:28:44] willing to follow his word
[1:28:46] and and this is where I think it gets
[1:28:48] really good for me because I've learned
[1:28:50] so much I cannot say that I serve God
[1:28:53] according to the message of the hour if
[1:28:55] I'm not a father according to the word
[1:28:58] I can't say that I serve God according
[1:29:01] to the message of the hour if I'm a wife
[1:29:03] and I don't serve my husband according
[1:29:05] to the word
[1:29:07] if I'm doing something else then I'm I'm
[1:29:09] off the word and you're either on the
[1:29:12] word or you're off the word there's no
[1:29:14] in between there's no middle ground
[1:29:16] Satan wants us to believe oh it's a
[1:29:18] pretty shade of gray you don't have to
[1:29:20] worry about it you can just do this or
[1:29:21] just do that you can't you've got to
[1:29:24] follow the word of God it's all the way
[1:29:27] or none
[1:29:28] and you know God knows your heart
[1:29:32] that's the key
[1:29:33] when the heart is right then the outward
[1:29:36] expression manifests brothers and
[1:29:38] sisters and when the heart is wrong the
[1:29:40] outward body manifests we think we can
[1:29:43] hide it but you can hide it
[1:29:46] and it's not about hiding it it's about
[1:29:48] getting in line with the word
[1:29:51] because
[1:29:52] who here who here doesn't want the full
[1:29:54] blessing of the word raise your hand
[1:29:56] and I know it's a loaded question it's
[1:29:58] silly to say that but every one of us
[1:30:00] wants it we all want that kind of a
[1:30:02] blessing so we have to follow the word
[1:30:05] all of the word
[1:30:08] you know brothers and sisters if there's
[1:30:10] no leadership in our lives or if there's
[1:30:12] only a partial leadership in our lives
[1:30:13] or some leadership in our lives then
[1:30:15] there's no communion
[1:30:17] we can we can be a false Pretender of
[1:30:19] the word and think that we're actually
[1:30:22] partaking of communion but you know what
[1:30:24] if we're mistreating our wives
[1:30:26] we're not getting communion if we're not
[1:30:29] serving our husbands we're not getting
[1:30:31] communion we think we are
[1:30:33] but you know what that's the worst
[1:30:35] that's the worst curse that this world
[1:30:36] could ever have that's what happened to
[1:30:38] Eve she thought she was serving God but
[1:30:41] we know that she is the only one that
[1:30:42] was deceived Adam wasn't deceived but
[1:30:44] she was truly deceived thinking she was
[1:30:46] doing something right Satan came along
[1:30:48] he's a Slicker he told her that look
[1:30:50] that's the way you're created you're
[1:30:52] built for it to worry about it
[1:30:55] it's good we're going to be actually
[1:30:56] bringing God's word to pass just just go
[1:30:59] for it it'll be fine and it wasn't fine
[1:31:01] we know it wasn't fine but it was all
[1:31:03] part of God's plan
[1:31:05] we don't want to try and interpret the
[1:31:07] word we just want to live the word we
[1:31:09] just want this word to manifest in our
[1:31:10] lives brothers and sisters and and our
[1:31:12] lives have an outward expression
[1:31:15] more than we know
[1:31:17] no leadership in our lives according to
[1:31:19] the word there's no communion we can we
[1:31:22] can act it all we want and we can we can
[1:31:25] probably fool many people but we will
[1:31:27] never fool God and we'll never fool the
[1:31:28] devil and we can tell the lie so much we
[1:31:31] heard that a few Services ago it's the
[1:31:33] human nature right if you tell someone a
[1:31:35] lie enough they'll start to believe it
[1:31:37] and sometimes we'll tell ourselves a lie
[1:31:39] so much that we'll even start to believe
[1:31:40] our own lies and you know I I think it's
[1:31:43] frightening for us to do that but it's
[1:31:45] true I'll just say this just listen to
[1:31:48] politics
[1:31:51] you know without leadership we're not
[1:31:54] going to have communion it was only
[1:31:55] after Abram followed the true leadership
[1:31:57] of the Lord
[1:31:59] that he got served communion it wasn't
[1:32:01] before that God didn't come down to
[1:32:03] Abram and serve him communion
[1:32:05] Melchizedek didn't come and knock on his
[1:32:06] father's door and say I have communion
[1:32:08] for you you just follow me and
[1:32:10] everything will fall into place he had
[1:32:13] to follow the leadership of the Lord by
[1:32:15] faith in his life he had to step out
[1:32:17] from all that he knew by faith to see if
[1:32:20] he could actually get to that place of
[1:32:22] true communion with the Lord it was only
[1:32:25] after patiently enduring only after
[1:32:28] patiently enduring did Abram receive a
[1:32:31] name change because that's what happened
[1:32:33] to him and that's what happens to all of
[1:32:35] us brothers and sisters there's a new
[1:32:36] name written in our Stone isn't it
[1:32:40] and that's going to be a body change for
[1:32:42] us so so Abram so he could receive the
[1:32:46] promise God gave him a body change
[1:32:49] didn't he he came down himself and told
[1:32:53] him I will visit you according to the
[1:32:55] time of life brothers and sisters in
[1:32:58] this age did God himself not come down
[1:33:00] and visit us himself and tell us that I
[1:33:04] will visit you according to the time of
[1:33:07] life when that time is just right when
[1:33:09] the the cup of the amorites uh iniquity
[1:33:12] is full when when all of things are
[1:33:15] ready then there will be a body change
[1:33:19] he came down himself he didn't send a
[1:33:21] messenger we know that he had a
[1:33:23] messenger William Miriam Branham but
[1:33:26] what was sunset Mountain what happened
[1:33:27] 1963 what was the attraction on the
[1:33:30] mountain
[1:33:31] was it just God's Prophet out hunting
[1:33:34] if that's all it was brothers and
[1:33:36] sisters I really would like to have a
[1:33:37] further conversation because there's
[1:33:39] more to it than meets the eye
[1:33:43] only after God's leadership
[1:33:45] can we receive the true blessing in our
[1:33:47] lives
[1:33:50] and we know that in Abram's life he got
[1:33:53] the name change to Abraham
[1:33:56] we just sort of doing a high level
[1:33:57] flyover today I hope it's okay
[1:34:00] he got the name change
[1:34:02] and once he got the name changed God
[1:34:04] came down and actually visited him and
[1:34:06] confirmed that his name was changed
[1:34:08] called him Abraham in the plains of
[1:34:10] mammary when they ate the fatted calf
[1:34:13] they fellowshipped he washed their feet
[1:34:15] go to let me get a little water and and
[1:34:18] I I prayed that I could just let a
[1:34:20] little water and just wash your feet
[1:34:21] because I recognized that you are Elohim
[1:34:23] can you imagine that brothers and
[1:34:25] sisters what happens when we have a
[1:34:27] communion service are we able to have
[1:34:29] that Revelation about our brothers and
[1:34:31] our sisters just just let me a little
[1:34:33] water I pray thee that I could just wash
[1:34:35] your feet because I recognize that you
[1:34:37] are the Tabernacle of the most high God
[1:34:39] right here on Earth right now today do
[1:34:42] we recognize that brothers and sisters I
[1:34:44] think personally if we could recognize
[1:34:46] that that wouldn't keep one believer
[1:34:47] away from a communion service you'd be
[1:34:49] there so fast because you could
[1:34:51] recognize that you want to actually wash
[1:34:53] elohim's feet
[1:34:56] just like if we could recognize the the
[1:34:58] blessing that goes along with the tithe
[1:35:00] or an offering
[1:35:02] if we could recognize the blessing that
[1:35:04] goes along with that it's not about
[1:35:05] finances forget about finances finances
[1:35:08] are one thing but what about your
[1:35:09] marriage
[1:35:10] what what about your health
[1:35:12] what what about your spiritual ability
[1:35:15] to feed upon this word and to have
[1:35:17] strength to stand up against all the
[1:35:19] Devils that come around what about the
[1:35:21] ability to intercede like job for my
[1:35:23] children because per Adventure they
[1:35:25] could sin oh Lord let me make a
[1:35:28] sacrifice in the morning before the sun
[1:35:29] even comes up for my children because
[1:35:31] the prophet of God said that I'm the
[1:35:34] Holy Ghost for them until the age of
[1:35:35] accountability
[1:35:38] my
[1:35:40] how important is it for us to make sure
[1:35:43] that we understand the true revelation
[1:35:45] of the word for our day
[1:35:47] it's not about saying God sent a prophet
[1:35:49] it's about recognizing who we are
[1:35:51] because once we recognize what we are
[1:35:54] then the Rapture will go I don't want to
[1:35:56] spend another moment here then we have
[1:35:58] to we know that the children of Israel
[1:35:59] they spend 30 to 40 years extra in
[1:36:03] bondage
[1:36:05] I don't know if we'll spend any extra
[1:36:07] time here or not I'm not saying we will
[1:36:08] or we won't I'm just saying the word of
[1:36:11] God says they the promise was for 400
[1:36:13] years right we would agree on that but
[1:36:16] hey they were there for 430 years I
[1:36:18] think the prophet says somewhere 440
[1:36:21] years
[1:36:23] we don't want to stay here a moment too
[1:36:24] long I don't want to stay here a moment
[1:36:26] too long my goodness it hasn't even
[1:36:29] entered into the heart of man what what
[1:36:30] lays in store for us on the other side
[1:36:33] that's so fascinating to think about
[1:36:36] anyways
[1:36:38] you know Abram he was looking for that
[1:36:40] that promise and and we know that when
[1:36:43] he saw Elohim in the plains of mammary
[1:36:46] In the Heat of the day when he came to
[1:36:47] visit him and his wife and he declared
[1:36:51] my Lord
[1:36:53] we know his name changed and we know
[1:36:55] that nothing was the same for him after
[1:36:57] that
[1:36:58] we know that he was even able to ask the
[1:37:00] Lord the Lord said should we reveal our
[1:37:03] secret to Abram should we keep anything
[1:37:04] back from from our our son here on Earth
[1:37:08] and and he said no no we'll we'll
[1:37:10] actually tell you we'll let you know and
[1:37:12] and Sodom is going to be judged now
[1:37:14] we're going down to see we've heard the
[1:37:16] cries of the evil and we're going down
[1:37:19] to see ourselves is this truly what's
[1:37:21] actually happening
[1:37:23] and we know that Abram once again what
[1:37:25] did he do he interceded for his brother
[1:37:28] because he was his brother again he
[1:37:30] could have said man I told that kid
[1:37:32] saved him once but I told him he just
[1:37:35] wouldn't listen to me
[1:37:36] he didn't do that because he said he was
[1:37:38] a brother he's my brother he's my
[1:37:41] brother's son he's my kin he's my my
[1:37:43] blood my flesh and my blood we need to
[1:37:46] do something to save him so he asked God
[1:37:49] even contested in conversation with god
[1:37:52] I pray thee would you go down and
[1:37:54] destroy it for 30 people and we know
[1:37:58] that he counted it down please Lord
[1:37:59] don't get upset with me I just I just I
[1:38:02] just want to ask you what about 20
[1:38:04] people would you destroy the whole city
[1:38:06] for 20 righteous Souls and he says no no
[1:38:09] no no I'd save the whole city even if
[1:38:12] there was 20 Souls there but there ain't
[1:38:13] 20 Souls there Abraham there's not 20
[1:38:16] Souls there well what about tensels and
[1:38:18] we know that he counted it down even to
[1:38:20] five Souls oh my no I wouldn't destroy
[1:38:23] it not even for five
[1:38:27] but here we have him conversing with
[1:38:29] Elohim himself
[1:38:32] it's so amazing to think about that and
[1:38:34] you know brothers and sisters it's the
[1:38:35] same thing for us today we have the
[1:38:37] ability to converse with Elohim
[1:38:38] ourselves when we come to a service like
[1:38:41] this I'll even say this brothers and
[1:38:42] sisters right now the very thoughts in
[1:38:44] your heart are speaking louder in heaven
[1:38:46] than my voice through this microphone
[1:38:47] you are conversing with God in heaven
[1:38:50] whatever it is that's on your heart
[1:38:52] it's a wonderful thing we have the
[1:38:54] ability to the very access the very
[1:38:56] Throne of God Almighty where that one
[1:38:59] that came down to visit Elohim we can go
[1:39:01] to his house and visit him and bring our
[1:39:04] supplications and our prayers
[1:39:07] that we know that he came and he gave
[1:39:08] him a name change and he gave him a body
[1:39:10] change because he was able to follow the
[1:39:11] leadership he served in communion he
[1:39:13] took him he tested him he tried him he
[1:39:16] said now I believe that that you're
[1:39:18] ready for the next test Abram and and
[1:39:20] that's what it was it was a test wasn't
[1:39:21] it he was given the promised son
[1:39:24] Isaac was given to him and once he was
[1:39:27] given to him it was wonderful they must
[1:39:29] have just rejoiced and had such a
[1:39:31] celebration because they got that
[1:39:33] promised child they'd been waiting for
[1:39:35] for so many years we know that he had
[1:39:38] done the bird's eye and knitted the
[1:39:40] booties and did everything brother
[1:39:41] Branham said he didn't he didn't get
[1:39:43] weak in faith he was strong and and of a
[1:39:46] good courage as he marched in the land
[1:39:48] he knew that God promised him and it was
[1:39:50] going to happen and he actually lived
[1:39:52] his life according to that promise that
[1:39:55] it's going to happen and as Believers
[1:39:57] today we need to do that as well
[1:39:59] brothers and sisters we need to keep
[1:40:00] hoeing our potatoes and going to school
[1:40:02] and going to work and doing the things
[1:40:03] we need to do coming to church being in
[1:40:06] service but we need to be looking to the
[1:40:07] sky because any day now it's going to
[1:40:09] change for us
[1:40:12] but he was finally given that promise of
[1:40:14] Isaac the promised son
[1:40:16] that the whole world would be blessed
[1:40:18] through all of the Nations all of the
[1:40:21] families of the Earth would be blessed
[1:40:23] through that son
[1:40:26] and that's where he had a revelation
[1:40:28] because God said to him now you've got
[1:40:30] your son that's great you know you've
[1:40:32] been following me that's great I'm so
[1:40:34] pleased you're my son now I want you to
[1:40:37] take your son the one that I've given
[1:40:39] you that promised son take him to the
[1:40:40] top of the mountain and I want you to
[1:40:42] sacrifice him I want you to build an
[1:40:43] altar and I want you to cut him let him
[1:40:46] bleed and die for me
[1:40:49] show me that you love me Abram show me
[1:40:51] that you love me Abraham you you have
[1:40:54] followed me this far don't don't get
[1:40:56] weak on me now don't get weak in the
[1:40:57] knees now how many times in our lives
[1:40:59] brothers and sisters do we have
[1:41:01] situations that literally bring us to
[1:41:03] our knees where we get weak in our knees
[1:41:06] but that's simply God saying don't get
[1:41:08] weak on me now just show me that you
[1:41:10] love me let me see that you know that
[1:41:12] you love me and once he actually took
[1:41:14] him up we know that Isaac said to him
[1:41:16] hey Dad
[1:41:17] I see the fire and I see the wood but
[1:41:21] where's the lamb and what did Abram say
[1:41:24] to him what did Abraham say
[1:41:26] God will provide that lamb don't you
[1:41:28] worry son God will provide us a
[1:41:30] sacrifice
[1:41:32] because he's Jehovah Jireh he will
[1:41:34] provide what we need and we know that
[1:41:37] they got up there and we know that he
[1:41:38] got to the place where everything was
[1:41:40] placed in order and he told he must have
[1:41:42] told his son Isaac you are a promise
[1:41:44] from God you were created in him from
[1:41:47] before the foundation of the world
[1:41:48] before I left my father's house he told
[1:41:50] me that I would be blessed through my
[1:41:51] seed there would be a blessing to the
[1:41:53] entire world all of the families of the
[1:41:55] world would be blessed because of you
[1:41:57] like the dust on the on the beach of the
[1:41:59] sea the dust on the earth will be the
[1:42:01] numbers of the people that come from us
[1:42:04] from you my son because you are the
[1:42:06] promised son you didn't come from Hagar
[1:42:09] you weren't a a mingled seed you're the
[1:42:11] pure seed you're the promise seed you
[1:42:13] are the promised one Isaac it's all
[1:42:16] coming through you he must have told him
[1:42:18] all the way up don't worry son Jehovah
[1:42:20] Jireh is here and he's going to provide
[1:42:22] we're going to be completely safe
[1:42:23] because if perhaps you do die in this in
[1:42:27] this sacrifice God is obligated to raise
[1:42:29] you up according to his word don't you
[1:42:31] worry son it's all going to turn out and
[1:42:34] we know that Isaac had to Just Surrender
[1:42:36] Isaac had to follow the leadership of
[1:42:38] his daddy Isaac had to be willing to say
[1:42:40] okay Dad I trust you with all my heart I
[1:42:43] don't know what's going to happen here
[1:42:44] but one way or another I'm going to live
[1:42:46] according to what you're telling me so I
[1:42:49] guess just tie my hands up I guess just
[1:42:51] lay me on top of the wood I guess just
[1:42:53] pull that knife back and cut my throat
[1:42:55] daddy chop it up just like the the other
[1:42:58] sacrifices that have happened
[1:43:00] and we know that right when he was about
[1:43:02] to do it because God knew his heart he
[1:43:04] wasn't bluffing anymore he was so he
[1:43:06] must have been so frustrated and so much
[1:43:08] anxiety but he was still willing to
[1:43:09] follow through with it it was then in
[1:43:11] the moment then when he was willing to
[1:43:13] do it fully that God said Abraham just
[1:43:16] stop now I know Abraham that you love me
[1:43:19] but we know that it wasn't that God all
[1:43:21] of a sudden got this Revelation that
[1:43:23] Abraham loved him it was simply that God
[1:43:25] knew that now Abraham knew that he loved
[1:43:28] God it was all about understanding the
[1:43:30] Revelation and that's where he was able
[1:43:32] to say he's Jehovah Jireh he can provide
[1:43:35] he will always provide the need in the
[1:43:38] moment but it was only after the
[1:43:40] leadership of God that he got there
[1:43:42] if he would have said no way I had a
[1:43:45] conversation with my wife and she said
[1:43:46] nope you're not taking my son nope this
[1:43:49] is a promised son after all we went
[1:43:51] through with Hagar and all of that drama
[1:43:54] you want to take the promised son now
[1:43:56] the one that God gave us and you want to
[1:43:58] sacrifice no way
[1:44:00] unlikely she would have taken him
[1:44:02] because she knew how crazy her husband
[1:44:04] was likely she would have taken her son
[1:44:06] and shipped him off somewhere and hit
[1:44:08] him
[1:44:09] kept him
[1:44:10] done something to prevent it from
[1:44:12] happening because her husband was that
[1:44:13] fanatical but you know what when a
[1:44:15] husband truly is truly under the
[1:44:18] leadership of the Lord Jesus Christ he's
[1:44:19] going to look a little fanatical God's
[1:44:21] Gonna lead him and he's going to do
[1:44:23] things that people don't understand but
[1:44:25] that's the way God is
[1:44:27] and you know what I'm not going to say
[1:44:29] outside of the word of God just for the
[1:44:31] record Brothers
[1:44:33] if it's outside of the word of God
[1:44:34] there's something wrong there
[1:44:36] it's always going to be according to the
[1:44:38] word of God
[1:44:40] but it was only so he could receive the
[1:44:42] promise right that's what he was after
[1:44:44] he knew there was a promise in this son
[1:44:46] and it was way bigger than them and
[1:44:48] their family
[1:44:50] it was about the families of the Earth
[1:44:52] and and I think it's so fantastic to
[1:44:55] think about it when we have a family
[1:44:57] here today
[1:44:58] we're blessed because of that
[1:45:00] because of him because of his leadership
[1:45:03] because of his willingness to surrender
[1:45:05] to that leadership and you know what
[1:45:07] I'll throw this out there
[1:45:09] excuse me not the cough I apologize for
[1:45:12] getting excited but
[1:45:14] makes my voice a little hoarse
[1:45:17] um
[1:45:19] the leadership of the Lord
[1:45:22] call it the headship of the Lord
[1:45:25] we've got to be willing to surrender to
[1:45:27] the headship of the Lord
[1:45:29] we we've got to be willing to surrender
[1:45:31] to the headship of our husbands we've
[1:45:34] got to be willing to surrender to the
[1:45:36] headship of a pastor we've got to be
[1:45:39] willing to surrender to the headship in
[1:45:42] our lives if we're not willing to do
[1:45:43] that then we're not really going to be
[1:45:45] blessed according to the word because
[1:45:47] God's program is very clearly laid out
[1:45:49] if we don't follow his program we're not
[1:45:52] going to receive the blessing the full
[1:45:54] blessing and this is the dangerous part
[1:45:56] sometimes we can see a blessing in our
[1:45:58] life what we perceive to be a blessing
[1:45:59] but it can actually turn into a curse
[1:46:02] God can give us a lot of money in our
[1:46:04] lives and that's the age we live in
[1:46:06] right money is abundant we can go and
[1:46:08] borrow money we can get money if we need
[1:46:10] money we can get a job and and make
[1:46:12] money money is easy to get for the most
[1:46:15] part if you really want it it's not
[1:46:18] going to fall from Heaven it doesn't
[1:46:19] fall from Heaven you've got to run to
[1:46:21] get it especially in in the area that we
[1:46:22] live in you can't just walk and think
[1:46:25] you're going to get it but you know just
[1:46:27] getting money isn't a blessing of God
[1:46:29] getting money is actually going to be a
[1:46:32] bit of a curse because the more of it
[1:46:34] you get the more responsibility you've
[1:46:35] got and the more responsibility you've
[1:46:38] got the more pressure you've got and the
[1:46:40] more pressure you've got the more
[1:46:42] trouble you potentially have you can
[1:46:44] have situations where this money will
[1:46:46] start to control you instead of you
[1:46:48] controlling the money and that's why the
[1:46:50] word says the love of money is the root
[1:46:52] of all evil
[1:46:55] we don't want anything to get in the way
[1:46:56] of our sacrifice
[1:46:58] we want to be able to go right to the
[1:47:00] Mountaintop with our sacrifice with our
[1:47:02] promise with all the Revelation that
[1:47:04] we've got remember I I said that before
[1:47:06] when we talked about Abraham and going
[1:47:09] up to the Mountaintop with Isaac we
[1:47:11] talked about this we studied it a while
[1:47:12] ago and really I said this and I think
[1:47:14] it's the same way for us as Believers
[1:47:16] there's times in our lives where we've
[1:47:18] got to go right to the Mountaintop where
[1:47:19] it's just us and God and we've got to
[1:47:21] take everything that we think we know
[1:47:23] and sacrifice it unto God and say Lord
[1:47:25] just be it unto me according to your
[1:47:27] word I don't even understand what's
[1:47:28] going on in this situation it's making
[1:47:30] me weak in the knees it's making me
[1:47:32] wonder if you've really called me but
[1:47:34] you know when we get to that place which
[1:47:36] is that specialized place that he loves
[1:47:38] to get us to where we actually step
[1:47:40] right into the fire that's when the
[1:47:42] fourth man will turn up in the fire
[1:47:43] that's where he'll turn up and say now I
[1:47:46] know that you love me now I know for
[1:47:49] sure that you're willing to set aside
[1:47:51] all of the things that your father
[1:47:52] taught you all of the things from your
[1:47:55] family all of the traditions and
[1:47:57] reasonings and you're just willing to
[1:47:58] follow me now I know that you love me
[1:48:01] and that's when he'll come and serve
[1:48:03] communion but not until we get to that
[1:48:05] place in our lives
[1:48:07] we don't have true communion in our
[1:48:10] lives without leadership
[1:48:12] and and it might sound sound kind of
[1:48:15] crazy to be going this way but I I just
[1:48:17] it's I think it's really neat to to look
[1:48:19] at it and and you know we have to have
[1:48:22] leadership in our lives but the
[1:48:23] leadership has got to be according to
[1:48:25] the word
[1:48:26] in our lives and if we don't actually
[1:48:29] follow the leadership of the Lord and
[1:48:31] what is the leadership of the Lord
[1:48:33] leadership of the Lord is the person of
[1:48:34] Jesus Christ the message of the hour
[1:48:36] that we've been given we we we can have
[1:48:39] many different interpretations of it and
[1:48:41] say well you know what I can just go and
[1:48:43] listen to tapes or I can just go to this
[1:48:45] group over here that believes a slant of
[1:48:47] the message of the hour I can go to that
[1:48:48] group over there that believes a slant
[1:48:49] of the message of the hour but it's
[1:48:51] keeping me we don't believe that we
[1:48:53] should have fellowship with anybody else
[1:48:56] it's not actually following the word of
[1:48:58] God you know if you're dealing with an
[1:49:00] Infidel you're dealing with someone
[1:49:01] that's blatantly blatantly sinning the
[1:49:05] word of God says to not have fellowship
[1:49:07] with that person but someone who is
[1:49:09] worshiping under the same token that
[1:49:11] you're worshiping and to say that we're
[1:49:13] not Brethren how can you actually ever
[1:49:15] receive true communion with God when
[1:49:18] Abraham he saw that his his nephew went
[1:49:21] right down to Sodom how am I how would
[1:49:23] we be if we saw a son or a daughter of
[1:49:25] God go from the congregation right into
[1:49:27] sin would we go after him brother
[1:49:30] Bradham says we better go after them not
[1:49:32] turn our backs on them
[1:49:34] but if we bring them back and they won't
[1:49:36] be reconciled themselves that's where it
[1:49:38] comes to a place where you need to say
[1:49:40] you know maybe we just need to put some
[1:49:41] separation between us brother Branham
[1:49:43] says you ever put someone out from under
[1:49:45] the blood watch them then if they're
[1:49:47] truly a Son of God they'll come right
[1:49:49] back because they can't stand being out
[1:49:51] from under the blood who would want to
[1:49:53] be out from under the blood nobody would
[1:49:55] but who would want to put someone out
[1:49:56] from under the blood I don't think
[1:49:57] anybody would truly not it wouldn't be
[1:50:00] an exercise that we want
[1:50:02] I don't even know why I'm going there
[1:50:04] but it's it's interesting brothers and
[1:50:06] sisters we don't have true communion
[1:50:07] with the Lord without having leadership
[1:50:09] from the Lord and we can say all we want
[1:50:12] that we have leadership from the Lord
[1:50:13] but you know what talk is cheap and the
[1:50:15] proof is in the pudding are we able to
[1:50:17] live it that's what it comes down to
[1:50:18] we've got to be able to live the message
[1:50:20] of the hour
[1:50:22] and some people will say oh brother
[1:50:23] Barry there's no way that you can live
[1:50:24] the message of the hour because you've
[1:50:26] got all these dues and you've got all
[1:50:27] these don'ts and you've got all these
[1:50:28] other things in between you know what
[1:50:29] all of that stuff just follows
[1:50:32] just like the gifts when people want to
[1:50:34] put the gifts out front all of that
[1:50:35] stuff is supposed to follow you get
[1:50:37] Jesus Christ into your life where he
[1:50:39] justifies you where you recognize that
[1:50:40] he's Justified you that he has
[1:50:42] Sanctified you that he has already
[1:50:43] glorified in you then all of that stuff
[1:50:46] just follows suddenly you want to do the
[1:50:48] right thing suddenly you don't want to
[1:50:49] go to the bar rooms suddenly you don't
[1:50:51] want to start wearing revealing clothing
[1:50:53] suddenly you don't want to keep cutting
[1:50:55] your hair suddenly you just want to be
[1:50:57] in church suddenly different things
[1:50:59] start to happen in your life the Lord
[1:51:01] just cleanses you out you stirs you up
[1:51:06] you know I got into this scripture in
[1:51:07] Acts 19. let's just turn over to Acts
[1:51:09] 19. we've still got a little bit of time
[1:51:12] here
[1:51:12] it's amazing how it goes by I certainly
[1:51:15] love the leadership of the Lord and
[1:51:17] how he leads
[1:51:21] talking about leadership of the Lord
[1:51:31] the leadership of the Lord
[1:51:33] and how we have
[1:51:36] the leadership of the Lord has got to
[1:51:38] happen or we don't really have true
[1:51:40] communion
[1:51:43] looking at this story of the Vagabond
[1:51:45] Jews in Acts chapter 19.
[1:51:50] start reading with verse 13.
[1:51:55] these were people that were
[1:51:57] around the church
[1:52:00] and
[1:52:02] claiming to have leadership in their
[1:52:03] lives
[1:52:05] but not really having the communion
[1:52:09] verse 13 says uncertain of the Vagabond
[1:52:12] Jews
[1:52:13] exorcists took upon them
[1:52:16] to call over them that had evil spirits
[1:52:19] the name of the Lord Jesus saying we
[1:52:21] adjure You by Jesus whom Paul preacheth
[1:52:25] and there were seven sons of one Siva a
[1:52:29] Jew
[1:52:29] and a chief of the priests which did so
[1:52:35] and the evil spirit answered and said
[1:52:37] Jesus I know on Paul I know but who are
[1:52:39] ye
[1:52:40] and the man in whom the evil spirit was
[1:52:42] leaped on them and overcame them
[1:52:45] and prevailed against them so that they
[1:52:47] fled out of the that house naked and
[1:52:50] wounded
[1:52:51] and this was known to all the Jews and
[1:52:53] Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus and fear
[1:52:56] fell on them all and the name of the
[1:53:00] Lord Jesus was magnified
[1:53:03] talking about this scripture here how
[1:53:05] does this apply and and it I would say
[1:53:09] it applies in in the leadership of the
[1:53:11] Lord having the true leadership of the
[1:53:12] Lord here we have the sons
[1:53:16] of a Jew of Siva a Jew and a chief of
[1:53:20] the priests
[1:53:22] but yet his sons were misbehaving
[1:53:24] we're having this discussion about Eli
[1:53:27] and how his sons were misbehaving
[1:53:30] and when our sons are misbehaving
[1:53:33] according to the word
[1:53:34] it doesn't turn out right
[1:53:36] but to look at this scripture here they
[1:53:38] had leadership they they wanted to do
[1:53:40] the right thing they wanted to follow
[1:53:41] the word and they wanted to make a show
[1:53:43] of it they wanted to do their own thing
[1:53:45] they wanted to try and Castle the devils
[1:53:47] and and be the strong spiritual ones in
[1:53:49] the midst but but look at what happened
[1:53:52] to them
[1:53:53] because they were not willing to accept
[1:53:55] the full leadership of the Lord and what
[1:53:58] I want to say about that is they weren't
[1:54:00] willing to accept the leadership they
[1:54:01] weren't willing to fall under the
[1:54:03] ministry of the messenger for their age
[1:54:06] who was Paul
[1:54:08] they wanted to do it their own way
[1:54:10] they wanted to mingle it a little bit
[1:54:12] they wanted to take a little bit of
[1:54:13] their father's tradition maybe a little
[1:54:16] bit of whatever tradition in my case it
[1:54:18] would be a little bit of the Pentecostal
[1:54:20] tradition we'll just mix that in mingle
[1:54:22] it a little bit and and see if it would
[1:54:24] be okay put some speaking in tongues as
[1:54:27] the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:54:28] putting that out there first you know
[1:54:30] maybe just a little bit of that funny
[1:54:32] business and and what happened to them
[1:54:34] the evil spirit recognized it
[1:54:38] the evil spirit answered them and said
[1:54:41] Paul I know and Jesus I know
[1:54:44] but who are you and I just can't help
[1:54:46] but think about it brothers and sisters
[1:54:47] today in our age talking about the
[1:54:49] leadership of the Lord if we're not
[1:54:51] willing to actually accept the
[1:54:53] leadership of the Lord
[1:54:55] according to the messenger for our day
[1:54:57] according to the prophet for our day
[1:54:59] which would be the same as Paul because
[1:55:01] he preached what Paul preached he didn't
[1:55:04] mix it he didn't mingle it he didn't
[1:55:06] make it anything else he preached what
[1:55:07] Paul preached if we don't follow
[1:55:10] the word for our day but yet we pretend
[1:55:13] what can happen to us brothers and
[1:55:15] sisters this Spirit can leap on them
[1:55:18] the spirit leapt on them and and I was
[1:55:20] looking at this and and just marveling
[1:55:22] at it because I've often thought that
[1:55:24] this scripture would represent a maniac
[1:55:26] I think about the spirit that leapt on
[1:55:28] him and they left wounded and naked and
[1:55:30] and this is a maniac like the maniac of
[1:55:33] Galleria who had the the Fetters and the
[1:55:35] chains and and they couldn't bind him
[1:55:37] because of all the the Legion of devils
[1:55:39] that were in him you know I've always
[1:55:41] had that that concept but it just
[1:55:43] occurred to me you know what this was a
[1:55:45] religious devil
[1:55:48] if they're willing to try and and mix it
[1:55:50] with something else what happens to them
[1:55:52] then that religious devil leaps on them
[1:55:56] imagine brothers and sisters today if we
[1:55:59] try and mingle the message of the hour
[1:56:01] if we try and and pretend to actually go
[1:56:04] all the way but never go all the way
[1:56:06] just always have a little bit of
[1:56:08] reservation about the word for our day
[1:56:10] or about what God is doing in our midst
[1:56:12] if we have that reservation then what
[1:56:14] we're doing is we're mingling
[1:56:16] there's something going on there's some
[1:56:18] kind of funny business and and if we try
[1:56:21] and actually live the message of the
[1:56:23] hour from a mingled perspective watch
[1:56:25] out because a religious spirit can leap
[1:56:28] on you and what will it do it will
[1:56:31] thrash you and it will cause you to
[1:56:33] leave the house you'll leave the house
[1:56:34] wounded and naked believing that
[1:56:37] something bad was done to you and the
[1:56:40] only thing that was done to you is you
[1:56:41] just actually mingled the word you
[1:56:42] didn't actually allow the Lord to
[1:56:44] actually lead you all the way but if
[1:56:46] we're willing to let the Lord lead us
[1:56:48] all the way then we're never going to
[1:56:50] misbehave
[1:56:51] like these children did we're going to
[1:56:53] say be it unto me according to Paul's
[1:56:56] word because Paul preached what God
[1:56:57] wanted preached and we're going to say
[1:56:59] the same thing be it unto me according
[1:57:01] to William Miriam branham's word because
[1:57:03] he actually brought the word of God for
[1:57:05] our day he wasn't God but he introduced
[1:57:08] God
[1:57:09] and that's why we need brothers and
[1:57:11] sisters the god of the man
[1:57:14] you know this word Vagabond strongs G 40
[1:57:17] 22 is to come all around that is to
[1:57:20] stroll
[1:57:22] to facilitate veer
[1:57:24] fetch a compass Vagabond wandering about
[1:57:28] for me I just find it fascinating if we
[1:57:30] if we take it and run it as a a parallel
[1:57:32] to a maybe a Believer today and and
[1:57:35] think you know what maybe this isn't
[1:57:37] just a ravaging nasty Spirit that's that
[1:57:41] looks like a monster
[1:57:42] what if this is a religious spirit which
[1:57:44] it was
[1:57:46] it was it was it was from the priest
[1:57:49] the worst kind of spirit the one that
[1:57:51] will just ravage but never being able to
[1:57:54] just settle down
[1:57:55] always having the desire to to be a
[1:57:58] vagabond and just just go to to Veer
[1:58:01] never having a a solid foundation just
[1:58:05] just staying put and trusting God that
[1:58:07] God is in complete control
[1:58:09] never quite settled
[1:58:11] just a little bit uneasy
[1:58:13] you know Matthew 7 verse 17 it says even
[1:58:17] so every good tree bringeth forth good
[1:58:19] fruit but every corrupt tree bringeth
[1:58:21] forth evil fruit a good tree cannot
[1:58:24] bring forth evil fruit neither can a
[1:58:26] corrupt tree bring forth good fruit
[1:58:28] every tree that bringeth not forth good
[1:58:31] fruit is Hue and down and cast Into the
[1:58:33] Fire
[1:58:34] wherefore by their fruits ye shall know
[1:58:36] them
[1:58:37] not everyone that saith unto the Lord
[1:58:39] Lord
[1:58:41] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven
[1:58:43] but he that doeth the will of My Father
[1:58:45] which is in heaven and and what is the
[1:58:47] will of My Father which is in heaven
[1:58:49] the will of My Father which is in heaven
[1:58:52] is the word for our day
[1:58:54] and and we can bring it even further
[1:58:56] down than that brothers and sisters I
[1:58:58] just believe it's what the Lord's been
[1:58:59] shown me on Wednesday nights get in our
[1:59:02] positions
[1:59:04] we need to be a father we need to be a
[1:59:06] husband we need to be a wife and we need
[1:59:08] to be a child and we need to be
[1:59:10] according to the word and if we're
[1:59:11] outside of the word then are we doing
[1:59:13] the will of Our Father in heaven we can
[1:59:15] come to church all we want we can quote
[1:59:17] the quotes all we want we we can we can
[1:59:19] have all the buzzwords all we want we
[1:59:21] can have all the Mysteries all the Deep
[1:59:22] things of the message of the hour but
[1:59:25] it's not going to do us one bit of good
[1:59:26] if we're out of our position
[1:59:28] if we're not following the word of God
[1:59:30] according to the word that's been given
[1:59:32] to us for our day then we're actually
[1:59:34] not serving the lord and you know
[1:59:36] brother Branham says it that there's
[1:59:38] going to be millions and billions of
[1:59:40] false Pretenders
[1:59:43] coming in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:59:45] Christ
[1:59:49] many will say to me in that day Lord
[1:59:51] Lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[1:59:52] in thy name and we cast out devils in
[1:59:54] thy name done many wonderful works
[1:59:58] and then will I profess unto them I
[2:00:00] never knew you depart from me ye that
[2:00:03] work iniquity ye that know better but
[2:00:05] don't do it Ye Ye that know not to do it
[2:00:09] but still do it workers of iniquity
[2:00:13] I don't think he's talking about rank
[2:00:15] sinners in that message in in that
[2:00:17] scripture there
[2:00:19] you know Abraham he had a he had a real
[2:00:22] leadership of the Lord there's another
[2:00:24] leadership of the Lord that uh
[2:00:27] I want to get into but I don't know if
[2:00:28] we've got time today I I think you know
[2:00:31] what I'm just gonna I'm probably gonna
[2:00:32] press pause there today brothers and
[2:00:34] sisters we need to make sure that we
[2:00:36] know where we stand we know who we are
[2:00:38] so that we can actually receive true
[2:00:41] communion as we go forwards I want to
[2:00:43] talk about this communion that that
[2:00:44] Abraham had Abraham was given communion
[2:00:47] with Melchizedek Melchizedek brought him
[2:00:50] communion served him Bread and Wine
[2:00:52] There's real real significance to it as
[2:00:54] we go forwards I believe that uh we can
[2:00:58] see a whole bunch in that
[2:01:00] I uh maybe I'll call the musicians this
[2:01:03] morning I apologize we had a request for
[2:01:06] a baby dedication and I got a little
[2:01:08] sidetracked this morning but we will
[2:01:10] definitely do a baby dedication now
[2:01:12] maybe if you'll stand with me
[2:01:15] yeah brother Levi and sister Naomi we
[2:01:18] have the the baby dedication
[2:01:22] and we just want to uh we just want to
[2:01:25] bring the baby
[2:01:27] and dedicate the baby
[2:01:31] unto the Lord
[2:01:35] we have the ability brothers and sisters
[2:01:37] to go all the way right to the
[2:01:39] Mountaintop with our revelation
[2:01:42] and to see the the leadership of the
[2:01:44] Lord in our lives
[2:01:46] and to take what we have and try it
[2:01:49] remember Paul said that he died daily
[2:01:53] and what did that mean truly that he
[2:01:55] just died out to himself he would lay
[2:01:57] down his life and and and
[2:02:00] and all the things that he thought he
[2:02:01] knew
[2:02:02] but you know there's a lot of things in
[2:02:05] Paul's life
[2:02:06] that Paul had to deal with on a daily
[2:02:08] basis so that he could just get up and
[2:02:10] go and likely that was the persecution
[2:02:12] of the church and from his perspective
[2:02:14] likely it was all of his faults and
[2:02:17] failures he had to just let them die so
[2:02:20] that he could actually go forwards to be
[2:02:21] in his position and and if he didn't do
[2:02:24] that how would he ever be able to go
[2:02:26] forwards and have the confidence that he
[2:02:28] needed
[2:02:29] we need to do that ourselves to give the
[2:02:32] Lord leadership in our lives to just
[2:02:34] allow ourselves to not be completely
[2:02:37] beaten down by our faults and our
[2:02:39] failures and to allow them to rule us
[2:02:42] we we need to be able to look beyond
[2:02:44] that and recognize that God has done
[2:02:46] something so significant in our lives
[2:02:49] that Satan can't change it we can't
[2:02:51] change it we have been given such a
[2:02:53] wonderful gift in our day
[2:02:55] maybe let's just bow in prayer here
[2:02:58] a gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank
[2:03:00] you for your goodness to us Lord
[2:03:03] we thank you Father for the ability Lord
[2:03:05] Jesus to just to take your word the way
[2:03:08] that you've given it to us in our day
[2:03:11] father to not mingle it with anything
[2:03:13] father to not think that we could just
[2:03:15] take and and make it something that
[2:03:18] would suit us father but Lord you have
[2:03:21] positionally placed each one of us
[2:03:22] father to take your word the way that
[2:03:25] you have given it to us father and to
[2:03:27] apply it in our lives in such a way that

[2:03:35] and Lord we thank you for it
[2:03:37] father we pray that as we go forwards in
[2:03:40] our lives that we would just be able to

[2:03:47] have no reservations in our lives Lord
[2:03:49] that we wouldn't look to the right or
[2:03:51] look to the left but that we would just
[2:03:53] look to you father because we know that
[2:03:55] you have everything under your control
