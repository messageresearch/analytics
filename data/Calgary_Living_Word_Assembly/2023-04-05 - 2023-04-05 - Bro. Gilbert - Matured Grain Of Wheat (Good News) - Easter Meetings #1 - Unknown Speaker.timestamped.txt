[55:03] God bless you tonight welcome to the
[55:05] house of the Lord
[55:07] so wonderful to see everyone's face here
[55:09] tonight
[55:10] start of a series of meetings here
[55:13] trust the Lord will do something special
[55:16] for us this week
[55:18] just have one need that I'd like to
[55:20] bring before the church tonight and
[55:21] that's for brother Frank Cronkite
[55:24] there's a very serious need in his life
[55:26] he went in for the bladder surgery and
[55:29] the doctors didn't have a good report
[55:32] they said that his kidney is rock solid
[55:34] with a tumor and then it will no longer
[55:37] function
[55:38] and that the tumor is bad in the bladder
[55:40] and their recommendation is to take out
[55:42] all of the urinary tract and he will
[55:46] live on dialysis for the rest of his
[55:47] days so we would like to stand with the
[55:51] Cronkite family because we know that's
[55:53] not the right report
[55:54] we know that's a lie of the devil
[55:57] and we know that he does give us the
[55:59] healing and Grace that we need he gave
[56:02] us healing on this side of Eternity for
[56:05] a purpose we're not looking for the
[56:07] Millennium to have healing in these
[56:09] bodies the first drops of blood that hit

[1:02:37] I'm not excited myself
[1:02:40] because if I was asked I would have
[1:02:42] preferred the pastor to start the
[1:02:44] meetings
[1:02:47] but because it has fallen my Lord that I
[1:02:52] stand before before you

[1:02:58] say something that can encourage
[1:03:00] somebody somewhere

[1:03:29] trying to relax huh
[1:03:31] so that when I start firing at least we
[1:03:33] can move on
[1:03:35] okay
[1:03:37] [Music]
[1:03:40] let's turn to our bye boss
[1:03:43] Romans 8 11.
[1:03:49] a very familiar scripture
[1:04:16] if you are there you can say Amen
[1:04:19] I like hearing people turn the pages of
[1:04:21] the Bible so that I know they are
[1:04:23] serious
[1:04:30] amen before we read the word let us pray
[1:04:36] our most gracious Heavenly Father
[1:04:41] we are in your presence
[1:04:46] you ordained these meetings
[1:04:49] you ordained this service
[1:04:53] now we just want to return it back to
[1:04:55] your heavenly father
[1:04:57] so that you take control yourself
[1:05:01] from now up to the end
[1:05:04] I am the least amongst your children to
[1:05:07] stand before before the elect of the oh
[1:05:10] Lord
[1:05:11] but heavenly father I'm just praying in
[1:05:15] a humble way that you just take me out
[1:05:17] of the way so that you come down and
[1:05:19] speak to your children
[1:05:21] all my thoughts all my notes everything
[1:05:25] I've prepared father may you take away
[1:05:27] anything that is that will not be of
[1:05:30] benefit to your children
[1:05:32] we just want to surrender ourselves now
[1:05:34] to your will even now as we go to read
[1:05:37] your word may you bless it father for
[1:05:41] your own glory for it's in Jesus
[1:05:43] Christ's name we pray
[1:05:46] Romans 8 11.
[1:05:50] the Bible says but if the spirit of him
[1:05:53] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[1:05:56] in you he that raised up Christ from the
[1:05:59] dead shall also Quicken your motor
[1:06:03] bodies by his spirit that it weareth in
[1:06:06] you
[1:06:07] may God bless the reading of the word
[1:06:09] you can take your seats
[1:06:20] now
[1:06:22] from that scripture
[1:06:25] which says if the spirit
[1:06:28] that raised up Jesus Christ from the
[1:06:31] dead
[1:06:32] dwareth in you
[1:06:37] amen there is a condition there if
[1:06:45] if that spirit
[1:06:48] so for the next few minutes we are going
[1:06:51] to see how that Spirit dwareth In You
[1:06:56] and who is that spirit
[1:07:01] if we want to call the title of my
[1:07:03] sermon I've called it matured crane of
[1:07:07] wheat
[1:07:09] I know it has been preached by my
[1:07:11] brother somewhere
[1:07:15] so but uh if you can break it further I
[1:07:19] want to call it good news
[1:07:24] now what is good news
[1:07:29] good news is
[1:07:31] he said himself that because I live he
[1:07:35] shall live also
[1:07:37] that is good news
[1:07:39] Now that statement as much as it may
[1:07:42] look so good and so nice
[1:07:44] it is not addressed to everybody
[1:07:47] it is for specific people
[1:07:52] because I live he shall also live
[1:07:57] now who are these people that he was
[1:07:59] addressing to
[1:08:02] he was addressing to his own Pride
[1:08:07] it is only the pride who can say this
[1:08:10] scripture belongs to me
[1:08:12] any other person it is just a good story
[1:08:17] God help us
[1:08:20] because I live
[1:08:22] he shall live also
[1:08:25] now who is this that he was addressing
[1:08:29] to we have said that is the pride
[1:08:32] now let's go back in the beginning how
[1:08:35] he created The Pride
[1:08:37] their pride the first the first Pride
[1:08:40] was created through cesarean on Adam
[1:08:46] so the wife of Adam came from Adam
[1:08:49] himself
[1:08:52] not from somewhere else
[1:08:54] if she came from somewhere else they
[1:08:56] could have been fighting day and night
[1:09:00] but the pride came from himself
[1:09:04] now the second bride
[1:09:08] also came through caesarean
[1:09:12] on carvery
[1:09:18] so now when he says that
[1:09:23] it is because it is himself it is his
[1:09:27] own material
[1:09:30] and because he's Eternal then his
[1:09:33] material is also in tanu
[1:09:36] oh my God God help us
[1:09:40] I wish God can help us to see this
[1:09:47] you are in his mind
[1:09:50] you are in his thoughts
[1:09:53] so when he went to Calvary you went with
[1:09:55] him you were in him
[1:09:58] when he was being crucified you were in
[1:10:00] him
[1:10:04] that crucifixion was just so that the
[1:10:07] pride can come out of him
[1:10:12] now
[1:10:13] the time has come
[1:10:16] for the pride that came out of him now
[1:10:20] the pride is matured
[1:10:25] now if the pride is now mature
[1:10:30] then you can say I and my father are one
[1:10:34] if you are mature
[1:10:36] but you will see in a minute
[1:10:40] what a matured Pride can do
[1:10:44] what a mature at bright is supposed to
[1:10:46] be doing today
[1:10:49] why you are in his mind
[1:10:53] you are in his thoughts
[1:10:56] so you can do nothing except what he
[1:10:59] shows you
[1:11:04] can somebody say Amen to that
[1:11:06] you can do nothing
[1:11:10] except he shows you
[1:11:13] may God help us
[1:11:17] amen now
[1:11:20] this is the season for for the
[1:11:22] resurrection
[1:11:24] and uh
[1:11:26] what was in my mind and I think I talked
[1:11:29] to the pastor and he mentioned about it
[1:11:33] is to answer this question
[1:11:35] what does resurrection mean to you
[1:11:42] you know to some it's just a good story
[1:11:44] we can console ourselves living heal
[1:11:48] love D me
[1:11:50] dying is saved you can console yourself
[1:11:55] for that but what does it mean to you
[1:12:03] if you know what the resurrection means
[1:12:06] to you
[1:12:07] then you live a different life
[1:12:12] we live the way we live because we it
[1:12:15] has never come to our mind to know what
[1:12:18] this Resurrection means to us
[1:12:24] now
[1:12:26] in the message the rising of the sun
[1:12:28] paragraph 44 the prophet says today we
[1:12:32] have a tuberculosis Easter seal
[1:12:36] people sends message one to another
[1:12:39] and to support this great fund or drive
[1:12:42] for the doctors and medical science to
[1:12:44] work upon something to read that or to
[1:12:47] help the tuberculosis they are seal what
[1:12:51] we call an Easter seal when we send a
[1:12:55] message one to another but when we
[1:12:57] receive the message that seal is broken
[1:13:07] when you receive the message then that
[1:13:10] seal is broken
[1:13:13] now on the Easter morning
[1:13:16] he broke the seal
[1:13:19] no this this seal that he broke oh the
[1:13:23] wild was on the Gloom
[1:13:27] the Old Testament said the old people
[1:13:30] people could die and no hope no nothing
[1:13:33] but when he died
[1:13:37] allow me to go ahead of my son
[1:13:43] when he died
[1:13:45] the body was buried in the
[1:13:49] grave of Joseph
[1:13:53] but that's your funny
[1:13:56] lift that body
[1:13:59] went through the demons
[1:14:01] went up to hell
[1:14:04] that
[1:14:10] happened I said bring the keys because
[1:14:14] he was holding the kiss
[1:14:16] so he took back and it is bring the keys
[1:14:20] then he went back
[1:14:22] he went to Paradise
[1:14:31] for he was the hope that job was waiting
[1:14:34] for so he went with the key he unlocked
[1:14:37] the door
[1:14:42] what happened there was a resurrection
[1:14:47] so
[1:14:50] now he took the body
[1:14:53] and worked for 40 days
[1:14:57] [Laughter]
[1:15:00] he could feel
[1:15:02] he could eat
[1:15:04] yeah
[1:15:06] but he can appear and disappear
[1:15:11] [Laughter]
[1:15:14] there was
[1:15:15] good hinder him
[1:15:20] what happened they feel funny
[1:15:31] right here okay
[1:15:35] sorry
[1:15:36] it is restricting me as I cannot even
[1:15:39] jump
[1:15:41] okay okay okay okay are we together Sage
[1:15:45] now
[1:15:47] it's your funny
[1:15:49] that left the body in the grave
[1:15:52] and went to hell and picked the key
[1:15:57] that is the spirit that Paul is telling
[1:15:59] us that if the spirit that raised up
[1:16:02] Jesus dwellers in you he will Quicken
[1:16:06] your mother bodies
[1:16:13] so for you to talk about the
[1:16:15] resurrection now you need to identify
[1:16:18] yourself without theophany
[1:16:21] it is that it's your funny
[1:16:24] that will Quicken you
[1:16:26] it is that it's your funny that we can
[1:16:29] separate you from being a sinner to turn
[1:16:32] you to either into a saint
[1:16:34] it is not ethiophony
[1:16:37] and that's why the prophet says we have
[1:16:39] heard from our fearfulness
[1:16:41] and that is the
[1:16:43] Miracle that's going to happen
[1:16:47] not healing
[1:16:49] not even racing from the dead
[1:16:58] it was Saint
[1:16:59] [Music]
[1:17:01] that is the greatest miracle that can
[1:17:03] ever happen
[1:17:06] may God help us
[1:17:09] so
[1:17:11] that the resurrection
[1:17:13] what does the resurrection mean to you
[1:17:19] for you to identify the meaning of
[1:17:21] Resurrection you must come in contact
[1:17:24] with a theophany
[1:17:28] anything short of that you are just a
[1:17:31] church member
[1:17:40] God help us
[1:17:45] sorry somebody is eating my time
[1:17:49] okay
[1:17:53] so the resurrection is good news
[1:17:58] the resurrection
[1:18:01] is or the good news is
[1:18:04] because I live he shall live
[1:18:12] oh my
[1:18:16] okay
[1:18:20] now because of that statement
[1:18:24] that because I live he shall live
[1:18:28] then we can say the story of Jesus can
[1:18:31] become your story
[1:18:37] the story of Jesus can become your story
[1:18:41] you can say
[1:18:43] I have resurrected we are going to we
[1:18:46] are going to see it don't start fighting
[1:18:48] it in your mind
[1:18:50] we are going to we are going to see it
[1:18:53] how you are resurrected first
[1:18:56] resurrection you can say I was dead in
[1:19:00] sin and trespasses and now I know
[1:19:03] without doubt
[1:19:06] I have been changed
[1:19:16] you are not fighting
[1:19:19] no you know for sure something happened
[1:19:24] without doubt something happened I'm no
[1:19:28] longer the same
[1:19:36] sorry I'm not quarreling anybody
[1:19:40] [Laughter]
[1:19:43] oh my goodness
[1:19:47] we need to come to a point
[1:19:50] where we know what this Resurrection
[1:19:52] means to us
[1:19:59] okay
[1:20:02] the prophet says like this I am
[1:20:04] wondering today
[1:20:06] it's what is happening are we really
[1:20:09] getting the people to God or we are just
[1:20:12] getting them to church
[1:20:15] we must get them to Christ where this
[1:20:18] quickening power it is good to go to
[1:20:21] church sure if that's as far as we go
[1:20:24] it's not far enough when we come to
[1:20:27] church that is good but go on to Christ
[1:20:30] from the church because we must receive
[1:20:34] this quickening power
[1:20:38] foreign
[1:20:43] there are no two choices about it
[1:20:46] either you receive it or you just remain
[1:20:50] a church member
[1:20:54] but God is not interested in church
[1:20:56] members
[1:21:03] if brother topi may allow me to repeat
[1:21:05] this
[1:21:07] about The Game of Life
[1:21:10] God is interested in players not
[1:21:13] spectators
[1:21:19] the game can go on without spectators
[1:21:23] but it cannot go on without the players
[1:21:26] the players must be there
[1:21:28] and the coach must be there
[1:21:32] and the umbaya already
[1:21:34] the referee who is the absolute we heard
[1:21:38] about the absolute the other day
[1:21:41] so and when the absolute plus the
[1:21:44] whistle
[1:21:47] if you are a real player you stop
[1:21:51] you know the meaning of that whistle
[1:21:57] and when the when the Empire says it is
[1:22:00] of it is a goal
[1:22:02] some people with example
[1:22:05] some will complain they will destroy
[1:22:08] what they will throw whatever whatever
[1:22:10] they want to throw but it is final
[1:22:16] amen
[1:22:20] he was afghanistas he's a kidney Stars
[1:22:22] his Achilles me in this church but his
[1:22:25] what is
[1:22:28] so a player will respect
[1:22:32] the decision of the absolute
[1:22:35] or the umbaya but these Spectators will
[1:22:38] be complaining
[1:22:43] why did you put Daniel he's useless
[1:22:49] but you don't know the pain the player
[1:22:53] is going through
[1:22:57] how he's crying crying why he
[1:23:02] why he is crying to make things right
[1:23:06] but you being a spectator you are saying
[1:23:08] take him out of the church
[1:23:17] but remember
[1:23:19] he never again
[1:23:20] The Spectators are maturity
[1:23:28] Spectators are the majority
[1:23:34] so if where we are now is also a game
[1:23:39] then the spectators are majority
[1:23:42] but I want to be a player
[1:23:44] [Music]
[1:23:48] I want to be a player
[1:23:51] God help us
[1:23:56] paragraph 46.
[1:23:58] in the message the Easter seal the
[1:24:00] prophet says now notice the very essence
[1:24:03] of this Resurrection is to tell one that
[1:24:07] is one to tell to to show three to prove
[1:24:17] I wonder how many are in the
[1:24:19] resurrection today
[1:24:24] that you can tell
[1:24:28] you can show
[1:24:30] and you can prove
[1:24:36] you turn with your mouth
[1:24:40] confess
[1:24:43] then you have to show
[1:24:48] then what happens prove with your life
[1:24:56] I wonder how men are in the resurrection
[1:24:59] now
[1:25:03] God help us
[1:25:11] with me
[1:25:14] I'm just an evangelist and I've not even
[1:25:16] started evangelizing
[1:25:20] I'm trying to see where I can start
[1:25:23] but time is up we can finish
[1:25:26] I can leave it for another day
[1:25:28] but the truth of the matter is
[1:25:31] the resurrection
[1:25:33] become a reality
[1:25:37] not just to talk about it
[1:25:40] you can talk about it
[1:25:42] but you need to show
[1:25:44] and approve with your life
[1:25:52] can we ask for a test
[1:25:56] David said try me and prove me
[1:26:01] if you find any iniquity in me
[1:26:04] budget
[1:26:08] I wish we could come to a point
[1:26:11] where we honestly copy for God and say
[1:26:15] Lord patch me
[1:26:18] punch me
[1:26:20] help me I want to make it
[1:26:24] I want this Resurrection to become real
[1:26:27] in my life
[1:26:33] God help us
[1:26:41] now
[1:26:42] Resurrection is the matured crane
[1:26:47] I'll repeat it
[1:26:49] Resurrection is the matured crane
[1:26:55] which is the son of man
[1:27:02] now
[1:27:03] Jesus Christ
[1:27:05] or the Lord appeared in different forms
[1:27:10] Son of God
[1:27:11] of first son of man
[1:27:14] Son of God and the son of David
[1:27:20] but between the Son of God and the son
[1:27:24] of David in between here
[1:27:28] he sleeps in
[1:27:33] for what the purpose
[1:27:36] to fulfill the ministry of the son of
[1:27:40] man
[1:27:44] now who was son of man the son of man
[1:27:48] was the maturity seed
[1:27:53] in The Book of Leviticus on Friday it
[1:27:57] was the Feast of the Passover
[1:28:00] on Saturday morning he was the Feast of
[1:28:04] the unleavened bread
[1:28:06] then on Sunday it was there with
[1:28:12] saving
[1:28:15] now on Friday he was the Passover
[1:28:21] he was
[1:28:23] then depressed no sin on him
[1:28:27] even Pirates said oh I find no fault in
[1:28:31] him
[1:28:36] Believers find fault in your life
[1:28:43] pilot said I find no fault
[1:28:50] then what happened on Sunday morning
[1:28:52] he was weaved
[1:28:56] as the matured seed
[1:29:01] now if he was wefted as the maturity
[1:29:06] seed and we said earlier Ron that when
[1:29:10] he went to Calvary you are in him
[1:29:13] when he was crucified you are in him
[1:29:18] why because it was a process of
[1:29:21] caesarean
[1:29:23] so that now you can come out
[1:29:27] for what now to manifest
[1:29:37] so
[1:29:39] you can say or
[1:29:41] it is now your duty
[1:29:44] to prove that he's alive
[1:29:50] if you cannot prove that he's alive then
[1:29:53] you are taking him back in the grave
[1:30:00] but he resurrected
[1:30:03] to prove
[1:30:05] they claim that I can lay my life down
[1:30:09] and raise it up
[1:30:11] [Music]
[1:30:14] he proved it
[1:30:18] so we are here
[1:30:20] also to prove
[1:30:23] our claim
[1:30:25] that he is Resurrected
[1:30:30] can we prove it
[1:30:35] oh my goodness
[1:30:39] oh my
[1:30:46] so don't just sit there
[1:30:49] say Amen to the one
[1:30:53] as you a minute
[1:30:55] it it sucks in
[1:31:00] what happens so that when the old Taco
[1:31:04] is met or the worship comes your heart
[1:31:08] is ready to worship
[1:31:10] but if many of us we are so indifferent
[1:31:14] allow me to say this
[1:31:18] if you
[1:31:20] use friend there and Somebody's Crying
[1:31:23] casting out the demons those demons they
[1:31:25] will come to you because you have
[1:31:28] created an environment for the demons to
[1:31:30] come by your side
[1:31:39] so
[1:31:40] it is your responsibility cry Lord help
[1:31:43] me take away anything that may hinder
[1:31:46] that wants to flow from in my heart
[1:31:51] let me help me to surrender
[1:31:57] God help us
[1:32:06] amen
[1:32:14] now we are talking about the mature
[1:32:16] grain wheat
[1:32:18] grain of wheat
[1:32:20] now
[1:32:24] in Matthew 12.
[1:32:30] will I have time for that
[1:32:33] please just bear with me
[1:32:35] just bear with me
[1:32:40] let's read it
[1:32:42] it will help us
[1:33:02] Matthew 12.
[1:33:13] oh yes bus 38 then certain of the
[1:33:17] scribes and of the Pharisees answered
[1:33:19] saying Master we would see a sign from
[1:33:22] thee but he answered and said unto them
[1:33:25] an evil and adulterous generation
[1:33:28] seeketh after a sign and there shall not
[1:33:31] no sign be given to the to to eat but
[1:33:35] the sign of the Prophet Jonas you can
[1:33:38] read up you can read and finish it what
[1:33:40] was the sign of Jonas it was the sign of
[1:33:43] Resurrection
[1:33:46] now these guys they wanted to sign
[1:33:49] but then he said an evil and adulterous
[1:33:53] generation
[1:33:54] they seek for a sign
[1:33:58] is there any other generation that is
[1:34:01] evil than this one
[1:34:07] so what is happening this is a
[1:34:10] generation of science Seekers
[1:34:13] if they hear there is a Prada who is
[1:34:15] doing discernments in Edmonton next
[1:34:18] Sunday almost everybody will drive to Ed
[1:34:20] Mundo
[1:34:25] no wonder
[1:34:27] some Believers have Arisen calling
[1:34:30] themselves Joshua and they have
[1:34:32] followers
[1:34:37] why
[1:34:39] this is the generation
[1:34:41] sign Seekers
[1:34:44] don't seek for the sign seek for the
[1:34:47] word inside the word it has life it has
[1:34:50] those signs seek for the word as you sit
[1:34:54] down pray for more revelation of the
[1:34:57] word
[1:35:05] God help us
[1:35:08] so there is no more advancement in the
[1:35:13] growth of wheat after the crime
[1:35:17] I want that one to sink
[1:35:21] why because the seed that went down
[1:35:25] is now when it matures it goes through a
[1:35:29] process
[1:35:32] when you see the husk the tassel and
[1:35:35] everything
[1:35:37] it doesn't look like a seat but inside
[1:35:40] there is life
[1:35:42] and that life is progressing
[1:35:46] to a certain point to the maturity now
[1:35:50] when it matures it will be like in the
[1:35:53] same same seed that went in the ground
[1:35:57] so now we are saying the crane has
[1:36:01] matured
[1:36:02] if it has matured then it is supposed to
[1:36:05] look exactly
[1:36:08] like the son of man that went down
[1:36:12] all right
[1:36:14] in fact he said
[1:36:16] if he abides alone
[1:36:19] there will be no crowd but he has to die
[1:36:22] so that it matte price
[1:36:25] now if it is to multiply where's the
[1:36:28] multiplication it is you and me
[1:36:30] [Applause]
[1:36:33] it is now you and me
[1:36:35] we are the multiplication
[1:36:37] so what we already need to do
[1:36:39] recognize Who You Are
[1:36:42] what God has made you
[1:36:44] what God what God has made you today
[1:36:47] just come to that realization as we go
[1:36:50] through the series of these meetings
[1:36:52] let your prayer be Lord
[1:36:54] I want to be more like you
[1:37:02] I just did a summary of what what is
[1:37:03] what is going to come
[1:37:06] but remember
[1:37:09] the theme is
[1:37:12] what does this resurrection mean to you
[1:37:17] if we can carry it through
[1:37:20] up to Sunday
[1:37:23] then at the end of these meetings we
[1:37:26] should be different people
[1:37:30] what
[1:37:31] does this resurrection mean to me
[1:37:37] I I I don't know about brother Dan or no
[1:37:40] what does it mean to me it is now
[1:37:44] personal
[1:37:46] let us personalize it what does it mean
[1:37:49] to me
[1:37:54] he proved
[1:37:56] the resurrection proved his claim he
[1:38:00] proved his claim
[1:38:01] now we make claims we need now to prove
[1:38:08] being a Believer is not carrying message
[1:38:10] books
[1:38:15] let their life
[1:38:20] let the life now flow in you
[1:38:24] then you can tell you can show and you
[1:38:28] can prove
[1:38:36] God help us
[1:38:42] hey
[1:38:44] amen
[1:38:48] okay
[1:38:55] my time is up
[1:38:58] but I've not even covered a quarter so
[1:39:02] God help us
[1:39:05] but I will leave you with this
[1:39:07] what does this resurrection mean to you
[1:39:16] what does this resurrection mean to you
[1:39:27] okay
[1:39:35] just allow me to read this then
[1:39:38] we can conclude there
[1:39:40] in the message proving his word
[1:39:43] we are talking about proving now with
[1:39:45] your life
[1:39:46] now proving his word the message
[1:39:48] paragraph 236 the prophet says now
[1:39:50] remember
[1:39:51] that was not Jesus talking to Abraham
[1:39:54] there that could discern their thoughts
[1:39:56] in Sarah's mind behind him that was not
[1:40:00] Jesus he had not yet been born but it
[1:40:04] was a man in human flesh that that
[1:40:07] Abraham called Elohim the great Almighty
[1:40:10] showing Jesus said as it was in the days
[1:40:14] of Sodom now watch close in the days of
[1:40:18] Sodom so will it be at the coming of the
[1:40:20] son of man when the son of man is being
[1:40:23] revealed not no more as a church see not
[1:40:28] no more the pride is called see in that
[1:40:32] day the son of man will be revealed what
[1:40:36] to join the church to the Head
[1:40:39] to unite the marriage of the pride and
[1:40:43] the bridegroom and the pride the
[1:40:45] bridegroom call will come right through
[1:40:48] this
[1:40:50] when the son of man
[1:40:53] will come down and come in human flesh
[1:40:57] to to unite the two together the church
[1:41:00] has to be the word
[1:41:02] he is the word and the two unites
[1:41:06] together and to do that it will take the
[1:41:10] manifestations of the revealing of the
[1:41:12] son of man
[1:41:22] what was the trip to to Tucson
[1:41:26] it was to reveal the word
[1:41:30] which word
[1:41:32] he was not the son of man
[1:41:36] but he was revealing the son of man for
[1:41:40] what so that the head can Unite with the
[1:41:44] body now once the head unites with the
[1:41:48] body then we can say now it is one
[1:41:57] but my consolation is this
[1:42:00] there is an invisible Union that is
[1:42:02] going on
[1:42:05] example is just surrendering
[1:42:09] Lord walk through me
[1:42:12] walk through me
[1:42:14] mold me into that character mold me into
[1:42:19] what you want me to be I am tired I am
[1:42:23] tired of my own life I want to live your
[1:42:26] life
[1:42:27] I want to live your life
[1:42:29] can that be our prayer for the meetings
[1:42:32] that we are going through can that be
[1:42:34] out can that be your prayer Lord may you
[1:42:36] walk through me may you walk at The Room
[1:42:39] walk on me
[1:42:41] Change Me Lord
[1:42:44] Let Me Lord
[1:42:46] you cannot make it the Way You Are
[1:42:49] done deal
[1:42:50] you Unite with the word
[1:42:53] so that you become the one
[1:42:55] once you become the word then you can
[1:42:58] say I am the proof
[1:43:01] that Jesus is Alive
[1:43:06] Simba's that
[1:43:08] let us stand
[1:43:12] what does resurrection mean to you
[1:43:22] it's a harvest time I don't know brother
[1:43:24] Paul do you know that song that used to
[1:43:26] I think brother Hilda brand used to sing
[1:43:28] it called Harvest time it's harvest time
[1:43:32] and I can't hear the combine coming
[1:43:37] to kada in the crane and take it home
[1:43:44] the combine harvester
[1:43:47] we can hear is coming
[1:43:49] but he's coming for the matured crane
[1:43:52] [Laughter]
[1:43:55] nothing short of that
[1:43:57] give us energy sisters give us any as I
[1:44:01] call our pastor to come sorry
[1:44:05] I hope those few words will help
[1:44:07] somebody
[1:44:08] as you think about what does this
[1:44:11] service
[1:44:12] [Applause]
[1:44:20] I would have used that scripture brother
[1:44:23] Romans 8 11.
[1:44:26] he said he hoped the pastor would have
[1:44:28] started but I want to see the continuity
[1:44:31] of the spirit
[1:44:33] and I just think it's wonderful I don't
[1:44:36] know if I could have said it better we
[1:44:38] really need to consider
[1:44:41] this life we've been given so much in
[1:44:44] our day
[1:44:45] I think it's just amazing to look at it
[1:44:47] you know and I heard something just at
[1:44:49] the very end there's so much I heard
[1:44:51] tonight I could preach an hour
[1:44:54] um
[1:44:55] but just one thought you know we can
[1:44:57] hear the combine coming
[1:44:59] and we heard about players and we heard
[1:45:02] about spectators
[1:45:04] and I just thought you know many times
[1:45:07] I've heard about the combine coming and
[1:45:09] we can get hung up thinking about what
[1:45:11] type of combine that is and what brand
[1:45:14] it is is it a case is it a Massey
[1:45:17] Ferguson is it a John Deere what kind of
[1:45:19] combine is it but who cares what kind of
[1:45:21] combine it is we just want to make sure
[1:45:24] we get in it
[1:45:26] we just want to make sure that it gets
[1:45:28] us when it comes by that we're ready to
[1:45:30] get in that combine because we know that
[1:45:33] time's coming brothers and sisters
[1:45:36] my
[1:45:37] we have to have to be able to tell
[1:45:43] and prove
[1:45:45] and show we have to be able to it's not
[1:45:49] exceptional we can't say that I can only
[1:45:51] do one of the two or two of the three
[1:45:53] we've got to have all three of those in
[1:45:55] our lives let's just go to him in prayer
