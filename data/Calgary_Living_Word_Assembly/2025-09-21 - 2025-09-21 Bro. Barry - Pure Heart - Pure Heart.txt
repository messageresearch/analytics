It's It's late. It's really late. I was thinking this morning, my goodness. Our our prime minister is just taking sides with Palestine. I thought, man, it's just just hard to fathom. We know that those who bless Israel will be blessed. Those who curse Israel will be cursed. So, here we are in a country that's taken a side against Israel. It's it's uh it's challenging for sure, but &gt;&gt; greater is he that's in me and you than he that is in the world. Aren't you glad for that this morning? There's a blessed time that's coming.

Oh, who am I that he would pray not my will but thine? [Music] Oh, the answer I may never know why he ever loved me so. to that rugged cross. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our hearts before him. Our Lord, our savior, our king, our master, you mean everything to us, Lord. &gt;&gt; And we gather this morning, Father, question, who are we &gt;&gt; to deserve this privilege? Who are we? That will mean so much to you that your very life will be sacrificed on our behalf. Oh Lord, we say help us, precious savior, not to take this for granted. Oh Lord, we know we are who we are because of what you've made us Lord and we adore you. We appreciate you, Father. We lift up you and we glorify you, Father. And that is why we gather this way in your name, Father, knowing that we come to reaffirm our identity. &gt;&gt; We come to confirm that yes, we are yours and will be yours forever. We belong to you. We believe you. We are living for you. &gt;&gt; And we know we are a people called to show forth your glory in this day. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord, to be faithful. Father, &gt;&gt; we thank you again for the opportunity to gather in your presence this morning. Father, we thank you for the for the for the prayers of the saints and the willingness and desire to serve you and and the bringing of our gifts, the musicians, Father. And everybody surrendering for your purpose, oh Lord. We know, Father, that you are among us, because that is our purpose, Father. Help us not to miss it, oh Lord. All the privileges that come with experiencing your presence, Father, help us not to miss it, Lord. We love you so much, Father. And as we do this other step of of the service, Father, we pray merciful Father, that you'll be with us, oh Lord, that you'll bless every aspect of it, that the monies, the titan offerings that are coming will serve your purpose, oh Lord, those that are given here and those that are giving online, bless it all for your purpose, Lord. &gt;&gt; We desire to further this cause. So use us as you please. We love you. We appreciate you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Um just a few announcements to note quite a few. So the youth service today at the classes take note there's a prayer meeting on Thursday evening that's 25th and then the following day is the youth service. So now the youth meeting today is different from the youth service on Friday 25th. Okay. And then ladies branch on Saturday 27th. Uh, brother Toby will take the Sunday service on the 28th and I will take the uh the Wednesday service October 1st and then October 26 is communion service and brother Franklin and sister Madup's mother-in-law or sisterup's mother is returning to Nigeria on Thursday. And so please um take note, shake your hands, give a word of encouragement, something else. God bless you. Second verse. Sing that second verse, please. Second verse. Second verse. [Music] Then I'm reminded of his words. said, "I'll leave you never more. Just be true and I'll give to you a life forever. I wonder what I could have done to deserve God's only son to fight my battles until they're won. For who am I? Mother Dawn, would you come? Oh, who am I? night a king would bleed and die for. Who am I that he would pray? Not my will but thine glory. The answer I may never know. Oh, why he ever loved me so that it rugged cross he would go for who am I? Have your seats this morning. Amen. Before I read this palm, I just wanted to share something that was on my heart this morning. I woke up and felt compelled to remind people today that the bottom of the steps and where we had the TV and the seats that is a part of the sanctuary. It deserves the same amount of respect and sincerity &gt;&gt; as up here because of the church situation with more people than what our seating can arrange here. That is a please treat it as a part of our sanctuary here. We have the two rooms, the two Sunday school rooms. If you need to feed your children or you need to call somebody, it's not to be done in that area. Please just treat it like the sanctuary here. And I believe the Lord will reward us for it. Amen. I pray that this is a blessing. This poem is called made manifest. Creation waits with groaning voice. The earth in birth pain cries for sons to rise with spoken word and open blinded eyes. Not future hope but present hour. The bride takes up her stand. With perfect word and spirit fool she rules at his command. Hear the testimonies of the end time hour. where mystery meets the plane. Where sons of God arise in strength and Christ is seen again. No longer shadows, types or hints, no fragments left to find. The perfect word, the spirit's flame, hath come to claim mankind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They do not walk in borrowed light, nor live by serpent's design. The fullness of the spoken word now pulses through their spine. The seed of God within their soul ignited with holy fire. Not just the longing of the heart, but power to fulfill desire. Each morning when the sun peaks up and breaks the night's retreat, the children of God awake in faith and stand upon their feet. They seized the flesh, this stubborn man, &gt;&gt; and cast him to the floor. &gt;&gt; Submit, O body, to the word, &gt;&gt; and serve the Lord once more. &gt;&gt; This power is not from mortal flame, nor courage of the brave. It's by the spirit of the lamb who left an empty grave. The very Christ now living in flesh. &gt;&gt; The mystery long concealed unveiled in sons and daughters here in Calgary. &gt;&gt; In Calgary, &gt;&gt; his glory now revealed. &gt;&gt; No chain of lust, no fear of death, no unbelief can remain. &gt;&gt; For liberty has crowned their walk and circumcised Satan's shame. They tread this world with pre-ordained steps. Their hearts the temple bright, their very bodies testifying of God's eternal light. Hear the prophesying, oh saints of God. &gt;&gt; The prophecy come true. The same great life that conquered sin &gt;&gt; is now living in you. &gt;&gt; Not just the wish, but ability to act. The victory's already won. The glorious body made manifest. today, united with the sun. This is really what I want to remind you. As you walk these blackened streets and labor through the darkest of days, you carry heaven in your steps, the word your staff, and stay. For now, the bride is one with him, the mystery complete, the throne of God was in your soul, and the world beneath your feet. Lord bless you all. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Don, for that reminder. Stand with me if you would. Love the gifts in the body. Just uh let's uh sing 206. Word is working mightily as we ask our pastor to come and we'll sing I surrender all as a prayer to the Lord. As our pastor comes, just appreciate that, brother Don. Appreciate the gift the Lord's put in your life. Thanks for sharing it. all of us. It's incredible to put words like that to rhyme and and and and stir your heart and just speak to you just as a little sermonet pretty much in my view. I just really appreciate that, brother Don. Thank you for delivering that this morning. We all appreciate it. I'm sure the word is working mightily. What a confession this morning. We're about to step into the next most important part of the service. That word that we're going to hear is going to work mightily through us provided we open our hearts to him. Let's do that. Let's just be humble before the Lord. May our hearts just be fow ground that that word can settle into and bring forth much fruit for the kingdom. Let's let's do it this morning from our hearts. Well, the word is working mightily in me. Oh yes, the word is working mightily in me. No matter what the circumstance of what I feel or see, the word is working my dream in me. Oh yes, the word is working mighty in me. Oh yes, the word is working mighty in me. Oh no matter what the circumstance I feel the world is working my way. The way it'll do that is I surrender. Oh. Oh. I surrender. Oh, as our pastor comes. Oh, to thee my blessed savior I surrender. [Music] Oh, what's a good universal language of surrender and raise your hands to I surrender. Oh [Music] my god. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] to me. [Music] I surrender all. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. Welcome to the house of the Lord. Certainly an honor and a privilege to gather together again in his name, a name above every name. If you have a need this morning, I just would like to invite you to express it unto him by the way of an uplift hand as we go to him in prayer. [Music] Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus, this morning we thank you for your goodness. Thank you for your tender mercies to each one of us, Lord. Father, one more time we gather together in your name, Lord Jesus, with an earnest expectation, Father, to hear from you. And we know, Lord Jesus, there's millions, even billions of people gathering together on this day all around the world in varying degrees desiring to seek you. And father, Lord, I pray that this morning we would desire to seek you with a a pure heart, Lord, and clean hands. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Father, understanding that there's only one way, one truth, and one life. And Lord Jesus, though the world would try and present many different avenues and ways to you, you came yourself. You never sent an angel. You came yourself and you taught that there's only one way, one truth, and one life. And unless we're willing to come through you, we will in no wise see the father. &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, this morning, we just want to come and surrender all to you &gt;&gt; as we've sung, Lord, that it wouldn't just be a song, &gt;&gt; Father, that it would truly be the desire in our hearts, Lord. That we want to surrender all to you today. &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. Oh father and Lord Jesus, we just invite you to have the preeminence that you desire in this service. &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to ask Lord that you would meet each and every need that was made known unto you today, Lord, by the way of an uplift hand. &gt;&gt; And Father, maybe there's some needs that just weren't expressed that way, Father, but there's still a need. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; we know that you're aware. And Father, we commit those needs into your hands as well. We're so thankful, Lord, that we have a place. We have a a rock, oh, Father, that we can run to, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, a tower of refuge in this world that we live in. &gt;&gt; We know it's getting darker day by day. &gt;&gt; But, Father, as this world gets dark around us, &gt;&gt; your life gets brighter and brighter through us. &gt;&gt; And we thank you for that, Lord. Father, we just want to ask all these things now. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you this morning. Thank you musicians. If you have your Bibles this morning, I'd like to read a scripture out of Psalms. Psalms chapter 24 Psalms chapter 24. We can start with verse one. Says, "The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof, the world and they that dwell therein." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? Amen. &gt;&gt; So many people would try and proclaim that they own the world or a portion thereof and even though naturally speaking they may, the Lord owns them. It's a beautiful thought. Verse two says, "For he hath founded it upon the seas and established it upon the floods. Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands and a pure heart, who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you for your word. Thank you, Lord Jesus, that you came and ministered to us through a vindicated prophet. Lord, &gt;&gt; not through a man that just claimed to have a revelation, but nothing to back it up with. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But Lord Jesus, a vindicated ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where even the men of God would claim that this prophet had a relationship with you like nobody else. &gt;&gt; Father, we just ask that you would bless the reading of your word. We ask that you would break it open to us fresh once again. We pray that Lord Jesus, we could push aside all of our carnality and humanity and just enter into that place where our brother spoke the highest part of the service where Lord, you speak to us and we receive it gladly. &gt;&gt; We just love you and we thank you. We just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you this morning. You may be seated. I just want to welcome everyone to the house of the Lord. Certainly wonderful to be here together again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In his presence. We had a tremendous weekend last weekend with &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Andrew Glover here and certainly thankful for what the Lord has done and is doing in our brother's life with the injury of his son just after he was here and then his wife needing to go in and have the baby. They did uh they did a delivery of the baby through a C-section because she had high blood pressure because of what happened with the young feller, brother Malachi. And uh it's just the devil, isn't it? It &gt;&gt; is. &gt;&gt; Every life comes at the appointed time of the father. But it's interesting to see how the how the our brother had to go through so much there just in this last week. But we're certainly thankful. He has a lot of help around him. And we have uh many prayers going his way. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just would like to uh welcome brother John Panicker's cousin, Sister Stefina. Is that right? Did I say that correctly? God bless you, sister. Welcome. &gt;&gt; I understand that she was living in Vancouver and has now gone to Edmonton. Is that right? I trust you enjoy your time there, sister. Um, and I understand that uh we have some other visitors from Edmonton here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh, brother David and Sister Terry Blanchfield and their daughters, Sister Andrea and Sister Jasmine and their son Mark. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God richly bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I got a text this week. I believe it was maybe last, but uh, Brother David texted me and I believe we met up at the Moose Lake camp a couple years ago and at Moose Lake family camp. It's just a wonderful time of fellowship and certainly thankful to have you with us as well. I trust you feel right at home into the hill of the Lord. &gt;&gt; The question is who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? Who shall stand in his holy place? And you know John &gt;&gt; the revelator was a type of the bride and after the church ages were preached to John. We know that he was given an invitation in ro or uh revelations chapter 4. He was invited to come a little higher and we know that immediately he was in the spirit. That was his testimony and brother Bradam said it very clearly that we need to get in the spirit first. Unless we get in the spirit we won't understand these things that we talk about. We will not understand the church ages. We won't understand the seals. we won't understand the mysteries and the greatest mystery of all Christ the mystery of God revealed but not just Christ the mystery of God revealed Christ the mystery of God revealed in you &gt;&gt; and in I and that is the greatest mystery of the age in which we live &gt;&gt; the devil didn't believe it &gt;&gt; in the son of god ministry but he said there's going to be a son of man ministry just before the son of David ministry and right now we're living in that little tiny window that brother Mvin shows so clearly on his timeline when he he brings up the timeline on the screen here. There's just a little tiny window of a son of man ministry. And we know that there's scriptures that refer to the son of man ministry. And uh you know we're living in the midst of it right now. But I I just think it's wonderful we read a scripture like this. Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place. I can't help but think it is a type of a revelation. It's a type of being called a little higher. Excuse me. We know the prophet. I can't remember which one it is off hand, but he said, "I am a man. Woe is me. I am a man of unclean lips." He saw the temple posts shaking. He recognized who he was. And the Lord said, "Who will go?" And something inside the inside of that brother, he said, "I shall go. I'm here. &gt;&gt; I will go." And you know, it takes courage to be able to go. But we can't go unless we have a pure heart. &gt;&gt; Unless we have clean hands. And I think that if we really want to hear from God, we have got to be honest with God. And I'm sure that we all are. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I want to encourage us. Perhaps there is maybe a little bit more that we could be or do. And and you know this scripture here, it speaks to something that I've been studying on and I'm probably going to get back to it. And and that is it speaks very clearly about it in verse four. The one that will do it is the one that hath clean hands and a pure heart who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity. Now remember that is exactly what Satan did in the original sin in heaven where the battle started. He was perfect in all of his ways until iniquity was found in his heart. And what was that iniquity? He started to get a little bit of vanity in his mind. He wanted to actually exalt himself. He wanted everyone to exalt him to be just like the most high because he knew he could never be the most high. But we know that's the scripture. He wanted to be exalted up. And I just can't help but think the one who has a soul that's been exalted through vanity. Thinking that something is great when it's not. We're all What did we say a little while ago? Maybe worth $10 now. Brother Brandham talked about 10 cents. I think back in 53 or whenever we talked about that we're not worth very much. We can put on a $1,000 suit and drive a $200,000 car and think we're worth something. We're worth nothing &gt;&gt; outside of his spirit and his character living out through us. &gt;&gt; But he that hath clean hands, he's the one that's going to get into real revelation. the one that has a pure heart that doesn't want to see themselves exalted with vanity in their minds. &gt;&gt; I think it's an amazing thing. We can get vanity and not even know it. &gt;&gt; It becomes what we call a blind spot. &gt;&gt; We can think everything is okay. We believe God sent a prophet. We were raised in the message. Everything is fine. Maybe we just discovered the message and our lives are good. We committed ourselves to God, but we just got that one thing. And you know what? If that one thing isn't dealt with, it will trip us up because we will believe in our own mind that everything is fine. &gt;&gt; This is a day to not play church. &gt;&gt; This is a day to not play message. This is the day that the Lord has made for the truly elect to be called up a little higher in a revelation that angels desired to hear about it. We heard about it on the weekend. prophets and wise men, sages, they desired to look upon the things Daniel, he desired to look on this. And we know that God said, "You know what? It's not for you, Daniel. Just seal it up until the days at the end because there's going to be a people there that I've forordained to be able to receive the word." &gt;&gt; And I think it's beautiful because we can say, "Here we are. &gt;&gt; This is the day that the Lord has made." It's not just a day to go to church and dress up and and feel good for a little while. Well, this is the day that the Lord has made. And we know we're not talking about a day is in a specific calendar day. We're talking about a space of time. That son of man day ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think it's beautiful. &gt;&gt; Clean hands and a pure heart. You know, it's mentioned in the Bible four times, a pure heart. And it's mentioned in the message 15 times. And I was a little bit taken as I was studying it. You know, brother Random, he he actually prays that prayer that people would actually be able to handle this message, handle the word of God with with with clean hands and a pure heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I think it's so beautiful because the clean hands, I believe it just represents being genuine and honest with the word of God, not being defiled with traditions and teachings and thinking that everything that I know is good enough. That in itself can be vanity that will take us down. We've got to be willing to take everything that we know, cast down all imaginations. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Throw down those strongholds and allow the spirit of Christ to move into our hearts and our souls and minister to us the word that he desires. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, it's a beautiful thing. I think it's just a magnificent thing. The day in which we live, brothers and sisters, no one has ever lived here. No one has ever gone this far before, this close to the rapture of the church of the living God. It's so important for us to know that we are handling this word, this message, this gospel with clean hands and an absolutely genuinely sincere, pure heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just can't go back and think about I have to go back. I was going to say I can't help but think about I I I can go back and think about the children of Israel being in the the the goan time when all of the miracles had happened. We know that it was so dark in the land almost like it is today where you could feel it. It's almost that dark now, isn't it? &gt;&gt; But there's lights on in Goan, ain't there? &gt;&gt; Where the believers are, those ones that have seen the miracles, that have seen the signs, they've seen the wonders, but they don't worship the signs or the wonders. They worshiped the mighty Jehovah that was promised to them to bring those signs and wonders. &gt;&gt; And here we are in the day in which we live. My taking and thinking about the token just like the children of Israel in that day. Have we applied it correctly? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is it on both of the doorposts? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And is it on the lintil? The lintil goes above the door to support everything above it. So we have a clear space to walk in that's safe. Is that token applied? They had to have these thoughts in that day. Is it applied right? Brother Random talks about the children. Daddy, did you apply it right? The death angels coming through. Can you imagine those firstborn? They would have been saying, daddy, is it right? &gt;&gt; I can't think about Isaac would be saying, "Have you done it right? Should we check it again?" As believers in the day in which we live, if we don't apply that token the right way, if we're doing it through vanity, if we're doing it through a blind spot, if we're doing it through a traditional teaching, it might not be right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I just feel so impressed to check it up. Brothers and sisters, make sure we're checking that token with clean hands, with a pure heart. &gt;&gt; Our children's lives depend on it. Our marriages depend on it. &gt;&gt; My our church depends on it. &gt;&gt; Our salvation, it depends on it. &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about eternal salvation. I'm talking about the salvation of the rapture because that's where we're at. That's where we're looking for. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We're not looking for the promise of a a coming Messiah. We're not looking for a seventh angel, an eighth angel. We're not looking for a messenger to come around. &gt;&gt; We're not looking for another great ministry. We've got it all. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; I think it's beautiful. But you know, Brother Brandom, he talks in the message. It just I I trust it's okay. We can go this way today. I have to go with the leadership of the Lord. And he preached some messages which I think are are really interesting. One of them is why people are so tossed about. Why are people so tossed about? Usually people are tossed about because they're not in a single opinion. They're caught between two differing opinions. And you know, I think about it from a from a a religious standpoint or a maybe a a a spiritual standpoint, however we want to call that. I think about it this way. We can be holding on to the old and saying this is the traditional teachings and this is what we've always done so it must be right. It it's got to be correct. If we all did that with what our parents taught us, would we even be able to understand what we understand today? I don't know. The message for today we could say is exactly the same as it was then &gt;&gt; whenever that was. But is it? Because it's not their message. It's got to be my message. Amen. &gt;&gt; This isn't about a group message. This is about an individual affair. We know that brother Brandham said very clearly that God deals with Israel as a nation. &gt;&gt; He deals with a gentile church as individuals. &gt;&gt; So, we're not talking about mom and dad's revelation today. We're talking about my revelation today. &gt;&gt; And you know, you can check it up and see if my revelation is right or not. There's only going to be one right and that's according to the word of God. &gt;&gt; We're having a conversation on uh Saturday, yesterday. We're talking about the word of God and what a blessing it is to know that we have an absolute absolute &gt;&gt; absolute is the word of God. We're not interested in trying to to make excuses for it to say that it was for a different age, for a different culture. We know the devil has crept into the framework of the Christian church and caused it to to alter it and just change it and take out some scriptures and just alter some words. You know, that's his tactic. It's exactly what he did in the Garden of Eden, isn't it? Thou shalt not surely die. One word caused the fall of mankind just because of reasoning. Brother Brandham says it just because Eve had a little bit of vanity in her mind. She thought, "My, it does look appealing, doesn't it?" She desired something different than what her actual headship had to offer. And it's interesting because some people throw off and say that Adam's a bad guy because he let her do it. He stood by and didn't, you know, intervene. But what did he do? Adam, he loved her so much that he stepped out of his first estate. He stepped out of eternity for his bride because he loved her. Amen. &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham, he preaches this message. Why are people so tossed about? I I just I just think it's a beautiful description about why people maybe they don't have clean hands, maybe they don't have a pure heart because they're caught between two opinions. The only way you're going to be able to make a decision, brothers and sisters, be able to just wholly completely decide you're going to do something and then do it. And I know we're preaching to the choir today, but I I I know when I preach stuff like this, brothers and sisters are preaching to me. I don't want to have something lingering in my life that's going to hold me back. I'm going to go back to it. I want to know the tokens applied correctly in my life. &gt;&gt; Have I got clean hands? Do I have a pure heart? You know, I talked to brother Jeff Paige who is at work and you're probably listening this morning, brother. God bless you out working in the field as a welder and and we talk about the tests that happen. He can't just go and weld something, the metal, and then just pass it off and say, "Great, pay me, and now I'm going to run my way." He does. That does happen. But first, there's actually a a test that he has to pass. And it's not just a certification to get that job. Even though there are certification tests you have to do, he actually gets tested on every single job that he welds. They take an X-ray machine and they X-ray it and it goes right down deep into the the innermost parts of it and it shows if there's any flaws and we talk about it about how he's going to get his X-ray and is he going to pass the test and I say I feel the same way when I'm going to stand behind the pulpit. I'm going to get my X-ray. It's going to happen to me. I've got to have clean hands and a pure heart. But why are people so tossed about? Because they're not completely given over. They're not 100% sold out to the word of God. They haven't actually accepted completely the token for their day. And that's why people get tossed about. And sometimes sometimes it's because of what people do to us. We heard about it on the weekend. I thought it was astounding to hear it again. But sometimes ministry are actually wolves in in sheep's clothing. And their desire isn't actually to help the people. It's to have a comfy position. A a an image of prestige. That vanity that we were talking about, to have people esteem them and and to have an image. What a place to live. But you know, sometimes those guys, they do severe damage to people and it causes wounds. And I couldn't help but think about it when we were hearing it a little bit earlier that it goes maybe even a little bit beyond. And I'm not trying to correct Brother Andrew, just trying to chip into it. Sometimes it's actually scar tissue and you can't just erase it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You can't just scrub it off and it doesn't just soften up with warm water and Epsom salts. Sometimes it's actually scar tissue and and you feel it for the rest of your life. And and I can give an example. When I was a blind shoe cobbler, and I mean spiritually blind, I have my eyes, but I was a shoe cobbler. One time I had a knife and I was cutting the threads on a sole on a boot and and I was holding the last and I was coming around with this knife and it was binding up and it was making me angry because I wanted to get going and I just leaned into it and it finally let go and the knife stopped right in the end of my finger. Went right into the bone. Just boom. Maybe too much info, but I want to tell you what happened from it was the wound healed up. There's nothing no scar even. You can't even see anything there. But if I take my finger and I push down and I roll it the right way on the bone, it'll make the hair curl on the back of my neck. It hurts so bad because it's scar tissue right on the end of the bone. Spiritually speaking, that happens to people. And when that gets poked or pushed or touched just the right way, it is such a painful experience. &gt;&gt; And we can't even fathom how painful it is. Many times I do it and I'm like, I can't believe how painful that is. Even today, 30 years later, I'm like, "Wow, how much more to people, children of the living God, the bride of Jesus Christ, when they're mistreated by ministry." &gt;&gt; But you know, sometimes that happens and and the people, it's amazing how resilient &gt;&gt; those old soldiers are, those ones that have been mistreated, those ones that have &gt;&gt; probably pounds of scar tissue. how they've been mistreated, but yet they still get out of bed and come to church. &gt;&gt; I have the utmost respect for those people who have had gone through those experiences. But you know, the children, the ones that the devil is really coming for, they see that happen and they think, "Why would I ever serve a God that would have a ministry that acts that way, that behaves that way? Might as well eat and drink and be married, you know, even in the message and just go and and live life. It's a terrible thing, but that's why people are so tossed about because they just haven't really been able to get beyond whatever it is in their life. Maybe they're caught between two opinions. Maybe they just haven't completely given over to this idea of the message or whatever it is. You know, I've I've said it before and and and some people don't understand it or can't even really take it. But you know, you need to come to the place. You do need to come to the place where with this message of the hour, I would say this message of the hour with Jesus Christ. But and I know the message doesn't save you. But the message is going to take you to the hill of the Lord that we talked about. The message is going to give you the ability to have a completely pure heart. It's going to give you the ability to have completely clean hands because the message isn't to the whole world. &gt;&gt; It's to the truly elected of God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they're the ones that are called onto that holy place. They're called into the holy hill is what the scripture says. Who's going to be able to ascend into the holy hill? Not just onto it. Many people are able to climb all over it, but not really get inside it, but a very select few people. But the caught between two opinions. Should I really trust that this man of God didn't fall off on his doctrine? Should I really trust that it's actually going to be okay to just follow this man and see what his teachings are going to bring? People are tossed about when they're caught between two opinions, two differing opinions. My parents say, "Do this, but I believe God is showing me that and and what God is showing me lines up with the word of God and and in the message of the hour, and I just don't understand it." If that's what's going on, you have to follow the word of God. But why are people so tossed about? The prophet preached that message. I'm going to I'm going to bring a quote up here out of the voice of the sign in 1964. And uh I think this one came through. Did it come through? Amen. 1964. The voice of the sign. Brother Brandham talking about some of the the great ones in the Bible before him, the the messengers, the prophets. He says, ' Noah, a prophet on the land in the land, a sign of the coming judgment. Moses, a prophet in the land, the sign of a coming judgment. Elijah, prophet in the land, sign of coming judgment. I just have to pause there and say, you know, what does the word of God say in the book of Malachi? We have seen we have seen the Elijah of of Malachi come already. And for anybody that doesn't know, I know we all do. I I just believe there's someone maybe that hasn't seen it or heard it. Take a look in the book of Malachi because there was a prophet that came and actually declared the word of the Lord just like Elijah, just like the ones that we just read. And and the after the voice came, the voice was the sign. What happened was judgment came. It's no different today. That that that that prophet came, he declared the word of the Lord for the day in which we live, was taken off the scene, and now the judgment is all that's left. But before that judgment, something really significant happens. And that's why we're here today. We want to encourage us to that something really significant and that is the quickening power of the Holy Ghost which will change our characters to the word of God which will actually cause the rapture of the church to go home. That might be a little bit far-fetched for some people to believe it. But I just can't can't get away from that thought. It's the Holy Ghost living out through his bride because the prophet said when the church recognizes what it is. Why didn't he say, "Well, the church recognizes who it is &gt;&gt; or when it is." When when the church recognizes what it is, &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; then the rapture will go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because the bride of Jesus Christ will recognize her position is not here in this land. It's not here on this earth. &gt;&gt; Not in the condition that it's in. This is not This world is not our home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Elijah, prophet in the land, sign of coming judgment." We've seen that Elijah in our land which is the sign of coming judgment. He says John a prophet in the land a sign of coming judgment to Israel. They were absolutely cut off. Notice sign. What does the sign do? The sign is to attract the attention and get the church ready. &gt;&gt; No, to get the elected ready. There's a reason why there aren't millions and billions of people &gt;&gt; following this message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Because there needs to be room to make excuses for wearing pants, for having cut hair, for wearing makeup of any sort, of making yourself to behave like all of the other people in this world. It's okay to listen to rock and roll. It's okay to to watch movies like the world. It's okay to go and drink a little bit, have a little bit of wine for the stomach's sake, and maybe sip a little whiskey. It's okay to do all of that. Maybe just smoke a little stogy once in a while. Not very often. Maybe a pipe, maybe whatever it is. Maybe even a little weed. Whatever. It's okay. The world does it. It's legal. We know Paul said that all things being lawful, they're not expedient. &gt;&gt; They don't direct us to checking up and making sure that token is applied properly to our homes and our lives. But he says, "Not a sign." What does the sign do? The sign is to attract the attention. It's the bait on the hook. He said, Brother Bosworth said it's to attract the attention of the people. To attract the attention and get the elected ready, only a certain group of people. And when we talk about the elected, I want to say it very clearly. If we do get ourselves vaunted, if we do get a little bit of vanity in there and say that I'm elected, I'm better than these other people in the world, we're sorely mistaken because it's only by grace that we're saved through faith in the word of God for the day in which we live. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is a gross error. And that's where I'll say the hands aren't completely clean. When you start seeing someone, oh my, &gt;&gt; we're elected. We're the message, man. You know what? Something's wrong. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz we should be saying, "Oh Lord, thank you. Thank you for calling me. Oh, I wish that other people could see this message that you've shown me. Oh my." We should be sighing and crying for the abominations in the land. Is what brother Brandham said. That's the second evidence of having the Holy Ghost. He said, by the way, but he says, "Not a sign." What does a sign do? The sign is to attract the attention and get the elected ready and out of the way before judgment strikes. And isn't that just exactly what he said all the way along in his ministry? Just before one of those bombs goes off, we can see it all around the world. Nations are breaking. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Israel's awakening. The time that the prophets foretold, my goodness, you don't have to look very far. You can see it. We're we're right on the brink of something really, really significant taking place in this world. And you know, the whole world knows it. Everybody knows it. All of the NATO allies are on red alert, ready for Russia to try and do something because Russia's flexing its power. And it's not the USSR. Interesting how the prophet in 1933 said the voice told him to watch Russia. Watch Russia. Elon Musk is striving so hard to get all of the all of the satellite stuff going on. You know, don't don't think for a second that he was there just to be the Doge guy and go and clean up government and everything. For sure he was in there making sure that he was getting all of the satellite technology in place, which he couldn't do through previous admins, so that he could have his his network to be able to have all of these self-driving vehicles operating. Now, why? because a prophet a prophetic utterance went forward to say that that's actually what's going to happen. I was talking to a brother in the US and I hope it's okay. There is a major car manufacturer in the US where there's believers that work for that car manufacturer and the believers told the management of this company that there's actually a prophecy about self-driving autonomous vehicles from a vindicated prophet. And guess what? The administration, they said, "What? Come have a meeting with us. We want to know more about this." The owners of the company, the management, people are dialing into this. I can't help but think, does does Putin know about the prophecy as well? That voice that said, "Watch Russia." Don't think for a second that governments behind the scenes don't have the the enchanters and the soothsayers &gt;&gt; and all of the witches and and warlocks and people that advise them. Everyone except for God. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; These people are not stupid people. &gt;&gt; They're going to want to know. And we know we know full well even Nebuchadnezzar, he wasn't a believer. He didn't serve God. But he believed God, &gt;&gt; didn't he? &gt;&gt; He heard the prophecy and he went and did what he was supposed to do. And it's amazing because what did he do? He set God's prophet free because he saw somebody was there with a pure heart and clean hands, willing to serve that God. &gt;&gt; Notice the sign. What does the sign do? The sign is to attract the attention. I'm so thankful that we can say I I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. Someone who's had their attention attracted to to to get ready like the elected and out of the way before the judgment strikes, not after or during. Some folks are waiting for a sign to happen and then they're going to jump into church. It's going to be too late then. We're not going to be able to do it then. It's got to be now while we still can decide. He says that's that's what Noah did. Got the elected ready, the rest of them. And what does it do? The sign. And the voice of the sign condemns the unbeliever and gets him ready for judgment. &gt;&gt; That's why I believe it with all my heart. It can't be vanity in our lives to say that I'm a message believer. &gt;&gt; I know God sent a prophet, so I'm better than all these people. As soon as we start doing that, we've missed it. I believe this with all my heart. We're getting ourselves ready for judgment if we've got that going on in our lives. &gt;&gt; My I might get some conversations struck up about that one, but I think it's important. Let's have the conversation. Where do we stand? Who are we? Who are we? &gt;&gt; Do we recognize that all heaven is going to be silent to hear us worship? What does that mean? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I can't get away from that thought, brothers and sisters. All heaven is going to be all holy heaven is going to be quiet to hear us worship. Wow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is the sign supposed to do? It's supposed to attract the attention. And when the attention is attract attracted, we come to a place of decision. we come to a a point of a a crossroads in our life where we've got to decide, do I keep going straight down this road or should I I turn right or to the left? What what am I doing here? What what what does the GPS say? And you know, we could say it this way that the GPS says that there's many different ways. When you type in an address, you're everyone's familiar with it, I'm sure. It always shows three different ways to get to the same destination. That's fine and good on Earth, isn't it? It's fine and good when we're driving in a car, but it's not fine and good according to the scripture, according to the word of God. But the devil and the world, mainstream Christianity, would say, "Well, I can do this and still be saved. I I could still be a female preacher preaching the word of God. I I I could still be maybe a homosexual and and be a a minister of of the gospel. What? All of these things are completely totally against what Paul taught." But yet somehow there's an actual excuse for it to be okay. &gt;&gt; It's not okay. &gt;&gt; And you know there was people in the days of Noah that thought they were okay even after Noah entered into the ark. The crazy man who must have had sunstroke beaten up on that wood. Brother Brandham talks about him up on that hill preaching the gospel for 125 years. Get in the boat. Get in the boat. Get in the boat. It's going to rain. It never rained. They were scientifically advanced. They could prove it. Shoot rockets up into the atmosphere and show that there's no rain. Science is not our friend, brothers and sisters. The devil wants us to think it's our friend. God gave it to us for a purpose. But, you know, it's the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Science is good right up until the place it wants to come against our faith. And when it starts to combat our faith, we need to take science and throw it away &gt;&gt; because it's going to actually take and erode our faith. It's going to take us away from it. But I I think it's beautiful. Notice the sign. Brother Brandham, he talks about it. When they crawled into the boat, Noah and his family, once again, Brother Brandham dramatizes this in such a beautiful way. The children, they sat for seven days, didn't they? &gt;&gt; They did. &gt;&gt; They waited. It didn't just rain once God closed the door. He never closed the door. They knocked on the door and said, "Let us in, Noah, once the rain started." And he said, "I can't do it. I never closed the door." Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's exactly the same type of the five wise and the five unwise virgins. Some of them went into the feast and and the Lord closed the door. The bridegroom closed the door. It wasn't them that closed the door. But in the ark, the the children must have been saying, "Daddy, are you sure? They're throwing tomatoes at us. They're mocking us. They're making fun of us. You can hear them hitting the the ark. Who knows what else they're throwing at us? They're laughing at us. I can hear my friends out there mocking us and laughing. Are you sure, daddy? &gt;&gt; Right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And even to the place where mama came and said, "Don't you hear the kids? Are you sure, Noah? Honey, are you positive?" We got to be positive. &gt;&gt; We have to know that. We know that we know. &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to know that we've got a pure heart and clean hands, especially as husbands and dads &gt;&gt; because the family's depending on us. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know the trouble with that is &gt;&gt; unfortunately &gt;&gt; or fortunately depending on how you look at it, it doesn't show up right away. We can have unclean hands and maybe not a completely pure heart and look just fine. bring our children to church and live our lives and everything will look just fine. But 15 years down the road, what's the life our children are going to leave? &gt;&gt; What are they going to live? How are they going to act? Are they going to believe that it's okay to be one way at church and just a little bit different at home? It doesn't matter. It's okay to miss a Wednesday night service. It doesn't matter. It it doesn't matter whether we're on time for church, whether we're half an hour early. It just doesn't ma It's okay, &gt;&gt; is it? The prophet said it for a reason. &gt;&gt; But he says, notice the sign. What does the sign do? The sign is to attract the attention &gt;&gt; and get the elected ready &gt;&gt; and out of the way of out of the way before judgment strikes. That's what Noah did. He got the elected ready. I just can't help but think that's what brother Brandham did, ain't it? &gt;&gt; That's exactly what the ministry of brother Brandham did. He got the elected ready. We'll look back one day and we'll be able to say that. Wasn't that beautiful how he he just came and he got the elected ready? Got us all ready so that we'd just be out of the way. You know, there's a a thing going around online and I just want to say it that I think it's important. Uh it's a I don't know how many people have seen it, but you might see it in the days coming or you might have seen it already, but there's a bunch of uh it's a montage of kids. It's a video and the kids are talking about the rapture taking place. They're talking about what the sky looks like and there's all these different things happening. And it's not just like one or two kids. It's it's multiple kids giving the same sort of account of what's actually taking place. And some of them are saying that it's going to happen at a certain date and a time. And we know the word of God says that no man knows the day or the hour. &gt;&gt; No man knows the day or the hour. &gt;&gt; Not even the son, but only the father. &gt;&gt; And it only happens at the time appointed of the father. And and as soon as we start trying to put a time stamp on something, we just kind of have to pump the brakes and step back and say, you know, it looks really good. It sounds attractive because it's exciting to think that it's coming really soon. We believe it already without seeing a video like that. We already believe the rapture is imminent, don't we? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That it's imminent. It's going to happen. And we've never been this close to it. Right. &gt;&gt; So, I just think when I see stuff like that, I mean, it's circling in in message chats. That's why I'm saying it. It's not just out there in the world. I'm not looking at other worldly videos. This is just in a message chat. And and I just think, my that's not the sign we're looking for, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The sign we're looking for is this word of God. It's the messenger to the age. and and he brought the message. He's given the sign and he's already gone. And you know how we can say that that that sign is correct is because it's turned the hearts of the children. It's already turned some hearts, hasn't it? &gt;&gt; Some hearts have already been turned back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers. If we get a little bit excited and shout, it's okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If somebody speaks in tongues, it's okay. If there's a prophesying, it's okay. I if there's discernment, it's okay. Why am I saying all of that? Because they're all fruit of the spirit. It's all part of the word of God. &gt;&gt; But there's been scarecrows raised up around the message. Forget about Christianity out there right here where people are afraid of it. &gt;&gt; And I want to say, brothers and sisters, don't be afraid of the word of God. &gt;&gt; I just love how he says this. It was to get the elected ready. And and he did it, didn't he? &gt;&gt; He got the elected ready. But you know, we're still here. And that means there still must be some elected. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Either there's some elected that haven't come in yet or there's some elected that haven't gotten ready. One of those two. So, I just think we need to preach like uh they're still coming in. He says the rest of them. And what does it do? The sign and the voice of the sign condemns the unbeliever and gets him ready for judgment. It gets the elected ready for the escape. That's what sign is. That's what signs are given for for the coming judgment to the elected. They see it. It's not for everyone. We know that the disciples came to Jesus and said, you know, master, why do you rabbi, why do you teach in parables? Why can't you just say it plainly? And he told them because it's not given to them &gt;&gt; to know the things of God. It's not given to them to know the kingdom of God. It's not given to them to know the mysteries of God. But blessed are your eyes &gt;&gt; because they see these things and blessed are your ears and blessed are your hearts for they're able to receive the word. There's faith inside of you to mix with that word. And that's what gets us ready because we're elected. And when you're elected, that's what happens. &gt;&gt; You can't hear this word of God and be elected and say, "Well, I just can't do it." Unfortunately, and that's not to say that anyone is bad or anyone is good. It just is. It's election. It's like nature. Nature in the wilderness is savage. We would look at it and say it's savage. A coyote would grab a rabbit and tear it to pieces and eat it up and take the other parts back to his children and feed. It's terrible when you look at it that way, but it just is. It's neither good or bad. It's the curse. God created it to be that way until the changing of this world. &gt;&gt; Man chose that path. That's a part of the curse. But it's neither good or bad. That coyote isn't a bad coyote because it got food for its family and got food for itself. That's the only way it knows, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It just is. An election just is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those who are elected will actually hear the voice behind the sign. They won't just see a sign and say, "Wow, that's a wonderful man of God." Anyways, no, they'll say, "Wait a second. I've got to stop at this burning bush and look at it and see what's going on. All these other people just keep walking by, getting in my way, but I just want to take a closer look and see what is this all about. Brother Bham says, "Like the little woman with a pure heart and a defiled body." My my my. We could preach about this for a little while. We might have to. And the Pharisee with a pure body and a defiled heart. &gt;&gt; It condemned one and saves the other. What does &gt;&gt; the voice of the sign? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Jesus manifest God. &gt;&gt; Amen. to the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There he is in Galilee. And they say, "Come on over, miracle man. Come to a feast at the Pharisees house." Right? And here while he's there, they made a mockery of him. Brother Brandham talks about it. He says it how they invited him in, brought him in and and and got him there, but then they never they never greeted him properly, which means to anoint him with oil. They never washed his feet. Probably wash the feet first. The footwash flunky didn't even do it. He was told just ignore that guy. Just ignore him. They made a public show of him in the day that he showed up. And while they did that, they never anointed him with oil after they washed his feet. They should have and they never gave him a garment to sit down in. What they did was they just let him go and sit in the corner. And brother Benham talks about how they were like, "Okay, miracle man, do some wonder wonders and signs for us. Work some miracles so we could actually be entertained while we're eating here." They invited him not because they wanted him there, just so that they could actually have that vanity wrapping around them. And we've talked about it in the past, how they can have those fig leaves, those customtailored fig leaves wrapped around them. And I I I I think it's uh what is the word? Bespoke. Fig leaves. They fit me perfectly. They suit my taste. They fit all my curves in all the wrong places. But you know, they invited Jesus and they made a mockery of him. And who was it that actually solved the situation? I think it's absolutely beautiful &gt;&gt; because it's no different from us. For any one of us to think that we would be any different were crazy. &gt;&gt; If we were raised in this world without this message of the hour, we would all be just like the other people in this world. &gt;&gt; And don't think for a second that we wouldn't be. We would all be sinners, complete rank sinners. and in varying degrees. But this little prostitute, she saw what was going on and she couldn't take it anymore. &gt;&gt; And she had to do something about it. And and she thought, "What could I do? How could I ever do anything?" And then revelation started to strike her. Wait a second. I know where they sell perfume. I know they sell ointment. Why would she ever get that desire &gt;&gt; if it wasn't revelation? and she took it and ran with it. And we know brother Brandham said something notable that I've never heard before, but he said she thought, but he's going to know where I got the money. &gt;&gt; He's going to know how I got it, but she said, "I'm going to do it anyway." &gt;&gt; And I just think as a believer, as as a human being living in this earth, the devil wants to make us believe that we are that way even though we're saved. When we're saved, if we've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And when we receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, we don't stop being tempted. We get more tempted. &gt;&gt; The only difference is our desire changes to give into that temptation &gt;&gt; as much as we did. And you know, as long as we keep marching forward, that temptation will get weaker &gt;&gt; and weaker and weaker and weaker. But as soon as we stop marching forward and we start to worship that temptation and say, "Whoa, I've got that temptation and that problem and I just can't get over it and it's just there." As long as we keep giving it life, it's going to be there. &gt;&gt; But we would be just like that prostitute woman, wouldn't we? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he just brings it down home. And he says just like a a service like this, many times we want to sing songs and invite Jesus to come and be in our midst according to his word. Where two or three are gathered in his name, he's there, right? Are are we doing it with a pure hand heart and clean hands? Are we bringing him into the assembly, into our lives, because we really want to actually see our hearts changed or do we just want to have a good sermon and go home &gt;&gt; and don't keep us too late &gt;&gt; because we've got a roast in the oven or commitment or whatever or whatever. Right? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; This ain't time to play games, brothers and sisters. This is the time where the death angel is passing through the land right now. &gt;&gt; The rapture isn't the death angel. The devil is the death angel &gt;&gt; and this is Satan's Eden. He's passing through the land. &gt;&gt; We have to make sure we've got that token applied. But it's just so beautiful how that little prostitute, the one with a defiled hands and and feet, defiled body with with with an unpure body. My he says like the little woman with a pure heart and defiled body. That's the one &gt;&gt; that was given the revelation. Don't think that we're going to be any different. &gt;&gt; We're going to have a defiled body and a defiled mind. But let's come to the place where we can have a pure heart. &gt;&gt; It starts with a pure heart. &gt;&gt; Once we can get our hearts right, then everything else falls into place. &gt;&gt; But I love how Brother Bam talks about this little woman with a pure heart and a defiled body. She had the ability to recognize what was going on. And what could she do to fix it? She ran. She got the alabaster box with the ointment and she came in to where everyone was. She didn't care who was in that worship service. You can bring the quote up, brother, and leave it up. It's fine. She didn't care who was in the worship service. She didn't care who was around her watching her. She got busy washing Jesus' feet and appreciating him in the moment because nobody else was. &gt;&gt; Not to the level she was. And I just want to say I think it's time that we get to that place, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Or it doesn't matter who's here. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what they're doing or thinking. Who cares? &gt;&gt; Let's let's acknowledge the presence of Jesus Christ the way that he wants to be. And you can imagine he wanted to be acknowledged that way or he would have stopped her. &gt;&gt; But it's beautiful because this little woman with a pure heart and a defiled body. And then there was the Pharisee. He had a pure body, didn't he? He had a pure body. He probably had a pure house. He probably had everything in order in his house. It was probably never messy, especially when people came over, right? Everything was perfectly in order. Mr. Pharisee with a pure body. &gt;&gt; But what did he have? He had a defiled heart. &gt;&gt; And as I was looking at this, I just I think it's so beautiful because, you know, brothers and sisters, he he maybe wasn't a ranked sinner. I'm not saying he was. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying he was a terrible individual. He might not even have been the one that put Jesus on the cross. Right? &gt;&gt; We know Nicodemus recognized who he was, but for fear of his meal ticket, he was afraid to actually step up and say something. &gt;&gt; Nicodemus was a great teacher. But you know, this Pharisee, he might not have been off on his doctrine. He might not have been too far off on any of it. He might have just been one iota. Just something a little bit off in his life. Just wasn't completely pure in his heart. And it caused all of this to happen. He maybe never even desired to actually put Jesus on an open display shame in his party. Maybe he actually genuinely wanted to see something happen. And the people that were there in the places, they heard all the conversations and they thought, "Well, because we're on this team, we're not going to appreciate him. We're not going to," you know how it goes. &gt;&gt; It could easily go that way. But this Pharisee with a pure body, everything in his life, outwardly appearing perfect. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He knew the message so well, you could take a a pin and poke it through a tape and pull it back out and then just stretch the tape out and know exactly what number, how many minutes into the tape it was. Right? &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying? the message Pharisees, the message theologians. We know the Pharisees could do that with the scrolls, the scriptures, but there's people that do that with the message, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They know it all, but yet they don't have a pure heart. &gt;&gt; And you know them by their fruits. &gt;&gt; Let's be honest. &gt;&gt; You know them by their fruits. As I was studying this, I was thinking, you know, it doesn't take very long. If you ever get into the the sales game, you ever get into that arena, I had to dabble in it a little bit in my life. You get about 30 seconds in front of a client, in front of a a person that you're looking to sell, whatever it is you're going to do. You get about 30 seconds of a chance to prove it, to get an approval to go to the next conversation. In 30 seconds, it's in your appearance. It's in the way you speak, maybe even in the way you smell, your punctuality, right? There's certain things that that add up and and you get like a moment to actually make your first impression with human beings. And you know, at that point, if you get that moment, if you get that far, then you get like another minute to have what they call an elevator speech. You better be able to say what it is you're doing in in a very short period of time or you're going to lose the attention of the individual. It's like sending great long emails, great long text messages. They say that CEOs when they do that, if you don't catch their attention in the first paragraph, they're done. &gt;&gt; They scrap it. And that's why too many texts or too many emails is not a good thing. People just they they can't keep the information or whatever. But just thinking about this, we get a very short period of time to actually make an impression in people's lives. And what is the impression that we're making in people's lives with that tiny little window, that little space of time that we have? Is it that we actually represent Jesus Christ? Or is it that maybe there's something else going on? We have a little bit of a Pharisee living in our lives with with a pure body. Everything in our life is perfect outwardly, but there's just something just something that comes up. And you know, if we make excuses for that something, that something's always going to be there. &gt;&gt; But if we say, "Greater is he that is in me." Amen. &gt;&gt; Than he that is in this flesh. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I think the word of God, we know it says in this world, but I'm not going to get scientific or or theological on it, but I just want to say it this way. This body, this this body is not my home. &gt;&gt; I'm just passing through. This flesh will never ever see the final destination of where I'm going. And neither will yours. We can't see the real you and the real me. Isn't that beautiful? I think it's just amazing. We do not want to be that Pharisee that has a a pure body but a defiled heart. And I'm not saying we want to go and be like that defiled woman either. &gt;&gt; I want to say that we recognize the blood of Jesus Christ atones for all of our faults and failures. &gt;&gt; There ain't no making excuse. We don't need to make excuses to say that I've always done this way. I'm just this way. I'm done. No. You know what they say? I I I live my life most of my life saying that, you know, I'm I'm terrible with names. I'm terrible with names. Well, you know what I learned from a prophet? He says that every single cell in your body hears that confession. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, guess what? &gt;&gt; I'm terrible with names. &gt;&gt; But I'm learning to get better at remembering names. I'm I'm striving to do this. I'm I'm getting better at that. Whatever it is, we're never going to live above our confession. &gt;&gt; Brother Bradam, he says it. I'm just going to read this this paragraph again. Like the little woman with a pure heart and a defiled body and the Pharisee with a pure body and a defiled heart, it condemned one and saves the other one. &gt;&gt; Isn't it beautiful? That's the word that we believe. And that's why people get so upset with the prophet because what it does is it it condemns them. We don't condemn anyone, &gt;&gt; right? We don't condemn anyone. And the very judgments that saved Moses condemned the world. All of those plagues. Take that lamb. Take it and cut its throat and prepare it the way that I've instructed you with the bitter herbs. Get your family together. And if you don't have a family, get with your neighbors. Get under a roof. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't it beautiful? It's the same thing that brother Brandham said when they were up there in that box canyon the one day they were there hunting and brother Bradom he threw a rock up in the air and he said something happened. He said get under something quick. &gt;&gt; I can't help but think it's exactly the same way the prophet told them to get under a roof. &gt;&gt; Get under a roof. If you don't have a family, get with another family and kill that lamb. get that lamb killed and save the blood and apply it exactly the way we've been instructed by the prophet. &gt;&gt; God never boomed his voice and said to Israel, "Go and do this." &gt;&gt; He spoke to a prophet and told them, "Go tell my people. Apply it this way and then eat it up. Take that lamb and eat it up. Don't just leave it." Brother Adam says, "And the very judgments that saved Moses condemned the world." that death angel passed through the land. And anybody that decided to not listen to what the prophet said in that day, they died, right? &gt;&gt; The firstborn died. And I I want to say this, it's just so beautiful. I think the Lord just shows us stuff. The people who didn't do it right and they actually saw the firstborn die. I wonder how many there were. I don't think the word of God says how many there were, does it? But isn't it interesting because there was many, many people. Well, they just never had faith enough to mix with that word when they were out in the wilderness. So maybe some firstborn died. That's okay. They were able to carry on. They they were given deliverance and they came out of bondage, went out into the wilderness. But how many of those people actually went into the promised land? Not very many. Brother Brandham preaches the message called one in a million &gt;&gt; for a reason. Paragraph 109 says it gets the elected ready. That judgment that saved Moses, condemned the world, his preaching, it gets the elected ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we read that scripture in Revelation that talks about how uh no, it's not Revelation. We read the scripture that talks about how the reapers are going to go forwards and actually reap. They're going to separate the wheat from the chaff. How are they going to do it? It's the same way. It's by the preaching. &gt;&gt; Those angels are not going to be picking up people and taking them to geographical locations. It's just going to be the preaching of the word, preaching of this message in the day in which we live. And some people are going to be able to go on and receive it. And some people are going to say, "Oh, no. I can't receive that." And that's God. That's election. But it gets the elected ready. What is the elected ready for? When they see a God-scent sign, they look back in the scripture. They don't just take it and say, "Well, amen. It must be right because there's a lot of signs in the world." &gt;&gt; We know that Jesus said, "There's going to be many false prophets that go out among you. Many Jesus will be in the world." But brother Bradam, he says, "There's only one Messiah, one Lord Jesus." &gt;&gt; But it gets the elected ready for what? when they see a God-sense sign, they look back in the scripture and see if that's supposed to be there. &gt;&gt; And isn't that exactly what Paul did &gt;&gt; on his way to Damascus on his way to Damascus to lay the church of God to waste? &gt;&gt; We know that he had a revelation, fell off his horse, got taken into town, got his vision back, God dealt with it on both ends. We know all that happened. But once that happened, he didn't just say, "Whoa, I've got this tremendous experience." And start galloping through the land preaching this tremendous experience. He went into the backside of the desert. He went into Arabia for four years to test it by the word of God to see, is this according to the word of God. And that's what gave him the confidence to go forwards and say, "This is everything that I've learned about. Now I can see. I heard my whole life, but now I can truly see because it gets the elected ready." What is the elect ready for? When they see a God-sense sign, they look back in the scripture and see if it's supposed to be there. If we just look back to our traditions and say, "Well, my parents, they, you know, my the old pastor or the old church or the denomination." If we do that, then we're still between those two opinions we were talking about earlier. And we're never going to be settled, rooted, and grounded in the faith of the word of God. We will be tossed about if we're not. He says, "Yeah, here it is. What is it? pending judgment. Then the elected listens to the voice, but the unelected ignores and said, "Nonsense. Go on. We'll take the same old school." See, everything is fine in our life, right? Yeah. We'll take the same old school. See, that's the way they did in the days of Luther. &gt;&gt; That's the way they did in the days of Wesley. That's the way they do now. the way they've always done. &gt;&gt; Imagine if Moses just did the way they'd always done. Threw away all that he knew and went into the back side of the desert. Now he was dealing with his father-in-law's business and people in Midian just dealing with it there and saw the burning bush and just did like everyone else. We're good. I'm good. Don't need it. never did something on the inside. &gt;&gt; I thought it was so beautiful. I just in meditating this morning in prayer, my heart's desire, brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; is not to see a a church grow and become a big humongous mega church. But it it just struck me so profound this morning how there is either elected that haven't actually come into the place of maturity &gt;&gt; in the church of the living God or there's still elected that need to hear about this gospel. &gt;&gt; One of those two things is happening &gt;&gt; or the rapture would be gone. So, it gives me a desire to say, I want to go and start beating the streets, start looking in the highways and the byways of the city of Calgary and find out who who is it? Where where is that person? Is there another elected individual that's willing to receive that God sent a prophet to this generation? &gt;&gt; Where are they? What's going on? I I just think as we go forwards, we know the children of Israel, God, He saw them in their bondage. She saw them in their affliction, but we know they went 30 years over the promise. But once they started to cry and sigh for a deliverer, we know that God sent them deliverance. We're not crying for a deliverer now, are we? &gt;&gt; I want to start crying for the things of eternal value. And that is for that last predestinated seed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham says, "But it is a sign. And it has a voice that follows the sign. And the voice is identified as a scriptural voice. Now, don't forget that it's always going to be identified as a scriptural voice. &gt;&gt; And to me, this was the conversation we're having yesterday about all of the different ideas and theories you hear about the word of God. My, we're always going to take the word of God above all of our thoughts, &gt;&gt; above all of our desires, above everything that we think we know. It's always going to be the word of God. &gt;&gt; Not make excuse for it and say, "No, that was for another time." No. He says, "But it's a sign and it has a voice that follows the sign." And the voice is identified as a scriptural voice. Now, don't forget that. Now, keep that going in because I may never see you again. Huh? Now, I hope I'll see you again myself. I just think it's so wonderful to look at that. You know, another message that Brother Brandham, he preaches is why people Oh, no, sorry, I'm getting mixed up here. Bear with me. He says, 'Wh is it that so many Christians find it so hard to live the Christian life? Why is it because they just haven't actually gone all the way to completely surrendering and saying that I can't do it with my hands and I can't do it with my feet. I can't do it with my mind. I need to surrender all. Like we sang that song. &gt;&gt; I surrender all. &gt;&gt; Everything. &gt;&gt; We know the word of God says to acknowledge him in all of our ways and he will direct our paths. But why is it that so many Christians find it so hard to live the Christian life? I'll tell you in a little summary. I would recommend going and listening to it, but just a simple summary is is simply this. surrender. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're not fully surrendered. &gt;&gt; They say they are, but they're not. &gt;&gt; And if we say we are and we're not fully surrendered, the devil knows it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's going to come around and test us and try us and push us and poke us and do everything that he can to upset our apple cart. But that's why so many Christians find it hard to live the Christian life because they're busy trying to live it. Stop it. Stop trying to live that Christian life yourself and let Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever come into you and take over your body, your mind, your heart, and begin to live this word through us &gt;&gt; and see what happens. And it's hard, man. I know it. You've got to be willing to say to yourself, "I know you love that, but he says no. &gt;&gt; So, I'm just going to walk by faith, and I don't even know how that's going to work." or or my I don't really want to do that. But he says yes, so I'm going to walk by faith even though I don't even know how it's going to happen. I could only live by the examples that I've been given. And one of them is tithing. I've talked about it many times. If you want to hear more about it, I'll tell you. But when it comes to tithing, I'm not pulling for money. What I'm saying is see if God won't bless you. He says in his word, prove me on this. This is not just about giving to the church and seeing my money go into the treasury. No, it's all God's money. Just ask brother Mvin and see what he says. It's all God's money and he simply gives us 90% if we're willing to trust and give him the 10 that he asked for. &gt;&gt; But I had an experience where I learned very quickly, I mean real quickly, that he means business when it comes to tithing. And sometimes we don't have the money that we think we have to be able to tithe with. We're going to go broke if we do it. Prove him on it. &gt;&gt; He's got all the money. &gt;&gt; He's got all the money. There ain't no billionaire in this world that has any money unless he first gave it to him. &gt;&gt; That's the only reason we have money is because he gave it to us. &gt;&gt; We can say, "My, I got out of bed. I went to bed early last night. I take vitamins. I do all these different things and and studied in school and I've got all this stuff going on in my life. I know all about business and I can go and make money anywhere. And I I say that I'm guilty of saying some of those things. &gt;&gt; I can go out and get a job and make money. But what I am saying is that it only comes by him. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that happens unless he first ordains it. &gt;&gt; If we have any good thing in our life, where does it come from? &gt;&gt; All good things come from above. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the word of God. &gt;&gt; But the reason why it's so hard for so many Christians to find the way to live this Christian life is they're too busy trying to live it themselves. &gt;&gt; If we would just step back and actually allow him to live it through us, our lives would probably be a whole lot easier. &gt;&gt; They might be a little more difficult initially. There's no question about that. Because sometimes we have to go back and mend fences. Sometimes we have to go back and build bridges that were burned. Sometimes we have to do things that we really don't feel comfortable doing. But if we're willing to do it, &gt;&gt; God will bless us for it. &gt;&gt; He'll bless us beyond what we ever thought. &gt;&gt; Why can't some people keep the victory? Brother Brandham talks about that. You can probably see the the theme where I'm going with all this. It's simply because people aren't surrendering, man. They just don't have a pure heart. It's not completely pure towards the word of God. They might have a genuinely kind heart that's 100% pure. They might have genuine love, a a a filial love, human love in their life that that's pure, as pure as it could possibly be. But we're not talking about that. We're talking about a pure spiritual heart where the Holy Ghost himself comes into that little hollow place that he made in our soul, in our life, in our heart for him to live in. Brother Brandham, he uh got one more quote here before we close. in 1955, Fellowship by Redemption. He says, "Isn't it simple?" And I just love the way Brother Brandham says it because you hear about it so many times around the message how complicated it is. It's preached in such a way that it makes my head spin. And I can't help but think that sometimes even some of the ministers that do this, it's got to confuse them. You get some, they go off on Godhead and explain the Godhead for two hours talking about Godhead. How do you do that? You can't explain Godhead. It's God in three simple offices. Now, I say it that way just because I want to simplify it. God isn't simple. I'm not saying that. But it's the same spirit manifesting in three different ways. That's all. &gt;&gt; Amen. But in 1955, Fellowship by Redemption, he says, "Isn't it simple? Preachers make it so complicated. You have to come and take prohibitions and all these other things. You don't have to come and understand all of the seals. You don't have to come and understand the Hebrew series. You don't have to come and understand a lot of these different things, the mysteries. You don't have to. The only thing you've got to do is repent and get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you will see all of these things come to life. You will begin to understand them because it's not going to be a man teaching you. It will be Jesus Christ, the Holy Ghost teaching. But he says, it simple preachers make it so complicated. You have to come and take all prohibitions and all these other things. It's not. The Bible said it's so plain till even a fool shouldn't error, &gt;&gt; right? just accepting it, believing it, something happens in here. The only way that happens though is for a pure, fully, unreserved surrender to God. Man, if we have any reservations, I've told this about young people that want to come in and they want to make a stand for Christ and they've been in and out and up and down and all around and they just can't really seem to get the victory in their life. I've said it and I mean it with all my heart. Take the cell phone and throw it in the toilet. &gt;&gt; If you really want to serve God, you'll do that. &gt;&gt; The cell phone can always be replaced. Don't you think that God can't give you another cell phone? Even if it's a $2,000 deal, don't think he can never do that again. He can give you another cell phone, but it's those friends that are on that cell phone, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's that social media that's going to drag you down. And if you're not willing to sever those ties, you're not willing to serve God with a pure heart. It's that simple. &gt;&gt; If you want to keep mingling around with the world, you don't have a pure heart, which means you're not going to have clean hands, which means you're not going into that mount. &gt;&gt; That's the way it works. And it's the same thing with any one of us. Maybe it's not a child. Maybe it's someone that has something else in their life. If they're not willing to get rid of that thing wholeheartedly and say, "I don't understand what's going to happen. This blows my mind. How will I ever be able to overcome it? Just ask him &gt;&gt; and see if he won't show you. &gt;&gt; But you got to be willing to do it. &gt;&gt; And you can't bluff him and you can't bluff the devil. &gt;&gt; It's so weird because you can bluff yourself. &gt;&gt; We know that's human nature. All we got to do is say it enough. I remember being in the world. I don't know. I'm not claiming to be a saint. I'm never going to be a saint. I'm just going to be Brother Barry. And I I've got the token applied in my life to the best of my ability. I I I believe it with all my heart, but you know, there was a time in my life where I I wanted to be a certain way. I wanted so bad to do certain things in my life. And I would go to a new situation where nobody really knew me. And I would tell them that I actually did those things in my life that I always wanted to do but never really did. And and I thought that it garnered me some some street cred is what the people say, right? I got some some bonus points because they thought I was cool because I did these things. But I knew in my heart I never did them. But what happened was it wasn't very long, call it a few years of talking that talk, I began to believe it. &gt;&gt; It's human nature. &gt;&gt; And what it does is it causes a blind spot and we can actually convince ourselves of a lie. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown, he says just accepting it, believing it, something happens in here. Then God moves in with his spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. in that little hollow place &gt;&gt; there in the heart. Now that soul &gt;&gt; now you believe the word of God &gt;&gt; and you have everlasting life. &gt;&gt; And I think it's just so wonderful, so beautiful, so amazing because that is the word of God. It's Jesus Christ that saves people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's many different classes of people, brothers and sisters. There's the there's the people that actually are able to be elected because God called them to be elected. There's people that aren't elected, but they're still going to be saved in the second resurrection. &gt;&gt; And there's people that never even had their names written on the book that are actually going to get get the gift of eternal life. They're going to inherit eternal life. They're not going to be the bride. They're not going to sit with him in his throne, but they'll be able to live for eternity in the city. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Never even believing that God sent a prophet. &gt;&gt; But somewhere, somewhere, how along the way, they did something good for the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We have the ability to impart that to people. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "I want to take as many people with me as I can." &gt;&gt; And I I think that we all stand in in that corner. That's where we are today, isn't it? We want to take as many people with us as we can. Being elected is not something that we boast about. Being elected is something that humbles us because we understand that it's nothing we ever did. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Nothing we could ever do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; If you believe the word of God, you have everlasting life. Now, what you need now, if you've never been baptized with water, is to be baptized for the remission of your sins. &gt;&gt; And how do you do that? If you do it in the name of the Father and you do it in the name of the Son and you do it in the name of the Holy Ghost, then whose name are you baptized in? If you were to mail a letter to a specific address, but it said the name of the father, who would get that envelope, maybe the dad in the house, but what if there wasn't a dad in the house? Right? That's not a name. The father is not the name. &gt;&gt; The son isn't a name. &gt;&gt; And Holy Ghost isn't a name. The name is Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus Christ, that is the baptism that we're after. When we're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and you know, some people will say, "How do you know that? I believe the word of God. I'm just fine." Okay? But if you want to see if there's more, if you want to see if there's more, if there's more revelation, if God won't take you into that mount, if you want to see it, try him. &gt;&gt; Test him at his word. See if he's a liar. He's not. If you want the Holy Ghost in a way like maybe you've never experienced it just try him on it my he says then peace comes into the heart and everything I should call the musicians then you begin then you can really shout like a Christian should shout &gt;&gt; then speaking with tongues then the gifts of the spirit begins to manifest behind a pure heart a real foundation watch what happens then then that's real holy spirit. &gt;&gt; But first, it takes a pure heart. &gt;&gt; First, it takes clean hands. &gt;&gt; We've got to be willing to surrender everything, all that we have to the word of God in the day in which we live. All of it. But if we're willing to hold on to one thing, it's going to drag us down. It's going to take us right back to where we were. We're going to wonder, "Why is it so hard? Why is it so hard? Lord, please help. Why is it so hard? Brother Bradom says he's just right where we left him. All we got to do is go back to where we left him. I say, "Lord, help me because I've done it. I know exactly what it's like." We can put ourselves in the permissive will of God and still be serving God, still going down the road towards heaven, but walking on a real bumpy road. But I love how he says this here. Maybe stand with me as we close today. Then peace comes into the heart and everything. Peace doesn't just come into the heart. Peace comes into the car. &gt;&gt; Peace comes into the home, right? &gt;&gt; Peace comes into the church. Peace comes into the marriage. Peace comes into the relationships. Peace comes into the jobs, to school. Remember we read right at the beginning that he he inhabits it all, doesn't he? &gt;&gt; Peace comes into the heart and everything. Then you can begin. Then you can really shout like a Christian should shout. You know, brother Bam, he says it. You should get We should be just as exuberant about this as they are out there about their sporting games and events. Christians should shout. Then the speaking with tongues and then the gifts of the spirit begins to manifest behind a pure heart. Not in front of a pure heart, behind a pure heart. A real foundation. Watch what happens then. Then that's real Holy Spirit. But if you just come up on just a little emotion, it'll never work. You'll go right back out and hate. If you're not willing to just forget about all those friends, all those acquaintances, all the social media people, all of that stuff, if you're not willing to turn all that off, you want to keep all that going, but you still want to serve God, you're caught between two opinions because those people are not going to actually agree with what you're trying to do. They're going to try and drag you that way. And you know if you associate with that they will drag you that way. You will not overcome that. You have to sever the ties completely. But you know as soon as you do that I guarantee you the fear that strikes your heart when you think I have to disassociate myself with all those friends. How will I ever find friends? I'll tell you what, brother Bradam talks about it. How he never had friends as a kid but he's got more friends now all around the world than he ever imagined that he could have &gt;&gt; because he surrendered to the word of God. Alls we've got to do is be willing to take the first step. He talks about the eagle being trapped in the chicken yard scratching around in all the manure. And that eagle didn't didn't like it. It couldn't stomach it. It always had stomach issues and gastrointestinal problems and never could really feel comfortable. And the doctors probably prescribed all these things like you have gluten intolerance and all these other things in your life. But this eagle just couldn't stomach it. But they said, "It's good. Just eat it. Just eat it in the chicken yard." And eventually that eagle that was raised in the chicken yard eating chicken food, never ever being able to live their life good, heard the scream of the mama eagle. &gt;&gt; And you know, Brother Brham, he says this story, and it sounds funny. We've all heard it before, but he said, "Just jump one time. &gt;&gt; Jump one time and flap your wings and see if you won't be able to reach your mama. see if you won't fly out of that chicken yard and come to the place of full deliverance. &gt;&gt; He says, "You watch your hearts now how you'll long to read the Bible." I love this. It's like a barometer for where we're at in our spiritual walk. He says, "You watch your hearts now. You'll long to read the Bible." How you'll want you'll want to get alone to talk to him and say, "Oh, Father, oh, I just love you." &gt;&gt; That's the fellowship. See, That's what we need. &gt;&gt; Don't you think so, friends? &gt;&gt; He says, "God bless you." &gt;&gt; And I say, "God bless you today, too." Let's just bow in prayer. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for your word. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus, that one more time we could gather together in your name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we could acknowledge you, Lord, Father, the way that you desire. And Lord Jesus, I just want to pray today for each and every one of us, Lord. If any one of us here today, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; has approached this service any other way than the way that prostitute approached you that day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, I pray that you would forgive us for it. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, let us never ever be like the Pharisee that had a perfect outward appearance but a defiled heart. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, help us to guard our hearts. Amen. &gt;&gt; With all that we've got, &gt;&gt; help us to give our hearts wholly and completely to you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Father, let us not live a life with a a defiled heart, Lord, with something that's not completely pure, just because we're not willing to let go of one or two things that maybe we think we know. Father, help us to just say, "Be it unto me according to your word." &gt;&gt; Amen. and just allow your spirit to manifest through our lives. Lord Jesus, show us the things that we're afraid of. Father, help us, Lord Jesus, to recognize that it's not the things that we do. It's what you do through us, Father. &gt;&gt; That gives us success. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, we only are able to serve you because we surrender to you. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, we just Lord, I pray that you would, Father, walk with us as we leave this building, Father. That we wouldn't just leave your presence here, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, that the things we spoke about today would just resonate in our hearts, Lord. That we would desire a closer walk with you, Father. And Lord, I pray that if my heart has been unpure, that you would forgive me for it, Lord. I don't want to handle this word with unclean hands. I pray that if I have, Father, you would forgive me for it now and that you would just bless your children with a double portion, Lord Jesus. Father, we just love you and we thank you. We ask that you would be with us now. Lead us and guide us in all things. Lord, we pray that you would be with those who are maybe streaming now, who are away, Father, and those that might be tuning in later, whatever, wherever they are. Father, we pray that you would keep your hand upon them, that you would give them traveling mercies. Father, that you would bless them abundantly. Lord Jesus, we just love you and we thank you. We ask all these things now. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Can we sing that song? What a day that will be. It's 471. What a day that will be. There is coming a day when no partachache shall come. In the sky, no more tears to dim the eye. All is peace forever more. on that happy golden shore. What a day, a glorious day that will be. What a day that will be. When my Jesus I shall see. When I look upon his face, that one who save me by his grace. When he takes me by the hand and leads me through the promised land. What a day, a glorious day that will be. No sorrow, no more to bear, no more sickness, no pain, no more party over there. And forever I will be with the one who died for me. What a day. Glorious day that will be. [Music] What a day that will be when my Jesus I shall see. And I look upon his face. The one who save me by his grace. When he takes me by the hand and leads me to the promised land. What a day, glorious day that will be. [Music] Amen. We just have a prayer request for three people that are going to depart from us. Sister Margaret Agala is going to return to Nigeria on Saturday, September the 27th, and Sister Rosie is heading to India, as I understand. Also, Sister Kik is heading back to Nigeria. And uh we just would like to have a word of prayer as a congregation for their traveling mercies. &gt;&gt; Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus, this morning we're so thankful that we are a a bride body, Lord. And &gt;&gt; we know that it's all around the world, Father. It's not just located in one city or one town or one country. It's a many membered body, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're so thankful that we can be members of that body. And Father, this morning we just want to remember the sisters that were mentioned. Father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sister Kik and Sister Rosie and Sister Margaret. Lord, we pray that you would &gt;&gt; grant to them each of them, Father, traveling mercies. &gt;&gt; We pray that you would keep your angels encamped about them, Father, because we know they fear you. And Lord Jesus, we pray that you would just allow them to be a blessing to those people along the way. And Father, that you would bless them as they go back home. And Father, bless their time away, but bring them back home again safely. Father, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we just love you and we thank you and we just want to commit the sisters into your hands in your care, Lord Jesus, for traveling mercies. Now just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we sing 606? &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to see him. &gt;&gt; Do you want to see him today? &gt;&gt; Let's just start with a chorus. Oh, I want to see him.
