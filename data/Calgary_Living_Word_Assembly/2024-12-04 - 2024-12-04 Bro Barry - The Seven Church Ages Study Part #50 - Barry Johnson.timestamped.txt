[36:38] willing and we know alls we need to do
[36:40] is read this word and we're done amen
[36:44] and all the rest is
[36:45] gravy verse 7 of Revelations chapter 3
[36:49] and to the angel of the church in
[36:51] Philadelphia write these things saith he
[36:55] that is Holy he that is true he that
[36:59] hath the Key of David he that openeth
[37:02] and no man shutteth and shutteth and no
[37:06] man
[37:07] openeth I Know Thy Works behold I have
[37:11] set before thee an open door and no man
[37:15] can shut it for thou Hast a little
[37:17] strength and Hast kept my word and Hast
[37:21] not denied my name behold I will make
[37:25] them of the synagogue of Satan which say
[37:27] they are Jews and are not but do lie
[37:32] behold I will make them to come and
[37:35] worship before thy feet and to know that
[37:38] I have loved thee because thou Hast kept
[37:41] the word of my patience I also will keep
[37:45] thee from the hour of Temptation which
[37:48] shall come upon all the world to try
[37:51] them that dwell upon the Earth behold I
[37:55] come quickly hold fast that which thou
[37:59] Hast that no man take thy
[38:02] crown him that overcometh will I make a
[38:06] pillar in the temple of my God and he
[38:09] shall go no more out and I will write
[38:13] upon him the name of my God and the name
[38:17] of the city of my God which is New
[38:21] Jerusalem which cometh down out of
[38:23] Heaven from my God and I will write upon
[38:27] on him my new name amen he that hath an
[38:31] ear let him hear what the spirit saith
[38:35] unto the churches amen amen let's just
[38:38] bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord
[38:41] we're so thankful that we can read this
[38:44] word by Revelation Lord Jesus we have a
[38:47] little bit of understanding but we know
[38:49] that it takes Revelation by the spirit
[38:51] to make this word live and father
[38:54] tonight we just one more time invite you
[38:56] Lord Jesus
[38:58] to just pour out your Revelation into
[39:00] our lives and we'll be careful to give
[39:03] you all the praise father we love you
[39:05] and we thank you we just ask all these
[39:07] things in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[39:09] amen amen God bless you tonight you may
[39:11] be
[39:14] seated certainly uh enjoy this study
[39:19] it's it's been real special to me
[39:23] and I trust it's been to everyone amen I
[39:27] know we have lots to go through still
[39:29] and Lord willing it'll just continue to
[39:32] be a blessing to us sorry I just uh you
[39:35] might wonder what I'm doing here I'm not
[39:37] organizing notes I just cover up the
[39:39] screen here because uh of the
[39:44] scrolling it
[39:47] uh kind of distracts me just a few
[39:50] announcements we have a prayer meeting
[39:51] coming up tomorrow night we have brother
[39:53] gift marufu here uh on Sunday we're
[39:56] certainly excited to see him and his
[39:58] family one more
[40:00] time um we have the Youth Event on the
[40:03] 15th of December and we have the
[40:05] communion service on uh testimony
[40:08] communion service on the
[40:09] 31st and uh I think it'll be a wonderful
[40:12] time for those who can
[40:14] attend just getting right into this
[40:18] um this
[40:20] study something really special about
[40:22] this church age the Philadelphian Church
[40:25] age um
[40:28] where we're at I think it's just an an
[40:31] amazing thing there's so much in this
[40:34] church the exposition of the the
[40:38] exposition of the seven Church ages
[40:40] there's so much in there but in the
[40:41] Philadelphia and church age there's
[40:43] something really special about it and uh
[40:46] that is when you read the scripture I
[40:48] believe this is one of if not the only
[40:52] church age where there isn't a rebuke to
[40:55] the church where there's an ad
[40:57] admonishment where the Lord tells them I
[41:00] know exactly what you're going through
[41:02] and you've got a little bit of strength
[41:03] but those people who claim to be Jews
[41:06] who claim to be Christians will come and
[41:09] actually bow down at your feet and they
[41:10] will acknowledge that you love me it's a
[41:15] tremendous thing to think verse 8 he
[41:18] says I Know Thy Works behold I have set
[41:21] before thee an open door and I just
[41:24] can't help but think that's just exactly
[41:25] like John who was a type of the Bride he
[41:29] saw a door open in heaven didn't he and
[41:31] he was told to come up a little higher
[41:33] there's a greater Revelation for you and
[41:36] we know that that's actually the
[41:37] commission of the Bride as well but I
[41:39] just can't help but think there is an
[41:41] Open Door and no man can shut that door
[41:44] amen doesn't matter what kind of
[41:45] teaching can come along it doesn't
[41:47] matter what kind of tradition we might
[41:48] have doesn't matter what kind of
[41:50] mistakes we can encounter and faults and
[41:53] failures it doesn't matter nothing can
[41:55] shut that door because no no man open
[41:58] that door it's just such a beautiful
[42:00] thought boy to think that thou Hast kept
[42:04] my word and not denied my name that's
[42:07] why there's no rebuke just a beautiful
[42:09] thing tonight getting into chapter eight
[42:13] of the exposition of the seven Church
[42:15] age ages the Philadelphian Church age
[42:18] we'll just read the scripture again
[42:19] because it's in the book I just want to
[42:21] make sure that we absorb every single
[42:23] word in here and to the angel of the
[42:26] church in Philadelphia write these
[42:28] things saith he that is Holy he that is
[42:30] true he that hath the Key of David he
[42:32] that openeth and no man shutteth and
[42:34] shutteth and no man openeth I Know Thy
[42:37] Works behold I have set before thee an
[42:40] open door and no man can shut it for
[42:43] thou Hast a little strength and Hast
[42:45] kept my word and Hast not denied my name
[42:49] I think it's just so beautiful I just
[42:50] have to throw this in there you know how
[42:52] we would be able to say how what would
[42:54] be the identification of those people
[42:57] the identification of those people would
[42:58] be that they have not denied his name
[43:00] and that they have obeyed his word and I
[43:02] think it's just so beautiful brother
[43:03] Paul mentioned it earlier we're here
[43:05] tonight out of obedience to the word of
[43:07] God we want to be fed but the word of
[43:09] God says to forsake not the assembling
[43:11] of yourselves even more so as you see
[43:13] the day approaching and uh just
[43:16] interpreting it and saying well I can
[43:18] just stream or I can just stay home of
[43:20] course we have lives sometimes we have
[43:22] uh sickness and we just can't come to
[43:24] church but what we're talking about is
[43:26] to choose to not come just because is
[43:30] not obedience true and obedience is
[43:33] better than
[43:35] sacrifice I could get started here but I
[43:37] won't behold I will make them of the
[43:40] synagogue of Satan which say they are
[43:42] Jews and are not but do lie behold I
[43:45] will make them to come and worship
[43:47] before thy feet and to know that I have
[43:50] loved thee because thou Hast kept the
[43:52] word of my patience I also will keep
[43:56] thee from the hour of Temptation which
[43:58] shall come upon all the world to try
[44:00] them that dwell upon the earth I just
[44:03] can't help but think when was there ever
[44:04] a time of so much temptation is now M
[44:07] that's right behold I come quickly hold
[44:10] fast which thou
[44:13] Hast sorry behold I come quickly hold
[44:16] that fast which thou Hast that no man
[44:20] take thy crown him that overcometh will
[44:23] I make a pillar in the temple of my God
[44:25] and he shall go no more out and I will
[44:28] write upon him the name of my God and
[44:31] the name of the city of my God which is
[44:33] the New Jerusalem which cometh down out
[44:36] of Heaven from my God and I will write
[44:39] upon him my new
[44:41] name he that hath an ear let him hear
[44:45] what the spirit saith unto the
[44:48] churches the only way that we're able to
[44:51] hear is by Revelation and that's the ear
[44:54] we're talking about give us an ear of
[44:56] Revelation
[44:59] Philadelphia was 75 miles Southeast of
[45:04] Sardis excuse me it was the second
[45:07] largest city in Lydia it was built upon
[45:10] several Hills in a famous wine growing
[45:12] District its coins bore the head of
[45:15] bakus and the figure of bante Priestess
[45:20] of bakas the population of the city
[45:23] included Jews Christians of Jewish or
[45:27] origin and converts from heathenism the
[45:30] city suffered frequent earthquakes yet
[45:32] its duration was the longest of the
[45:35] Seven Cities of
[45:37] Revelation in fact the city still exists
[45:40] under the Turkish name of
[45:44] Al
[45:46] aliser or city of God the mintage of the
[45:50] coin suggest the deity of the city to be
[45:53] bakus now bakus is the same as n or
[45:57] Nimrod he is the lamented one though
[46:01] most of us think of him in terms of rry
[46:04] and
[46:05] drunkenness what illumination this
[46:07] brings to our minds here is a coin with
[46:10] the God on one side and the Priestess or
[46:13] propheus on the other Now flip a coin
[46:17] does it matter which way it comes down
[46:19] no sir it still is the same coin that is
[46:23] the romish religion of Jesus and Mary
[46:27] but we are not thinking of Rome only no
[46:30] there is not only the great Harlot
[46:33] certainly not for she by her
[46:35] fornications has become a
[46:39] mother
[46:42] sorry she has become a mother her
[46:45] daughters now are coins of the same
[46:50] mintage there on one side of the coin
[46:53] they have drawn up a worship of Jesus
[46:56] and on the other side
[46:57] they have their
[46:58] priestesses or prophetess also and she
[47:02] writes her Creeds and dogmas and tenants
[47:06] and sells them to the people for
[47:08] salvation insisting that she and she
[47:11] alone has the True Light now we know for
[47:15] sure but I'm just going to put it in my
[47:18] terms uh he's talking about the churches
[47:21] there's Rome but then there's the other
[47:22] churches all of the other churches all
[47:25] of the other churches will wander after
[47:27] the Beast whose names aren't written in
[47:29] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[47:31] foundation of the world but this is what
[47:33] he's talking about the daughters are all
[47:35] of the churches the female is the
[47:38] church how remarkable is the fact that
[47:41] this age is characterized by the coin
[47:45] for the mother and daughters are all
[47:47] buying their way to heaven money and not
[47:50] blood is the purchase price money and
[47:55] not spirit is the power that moves them
[47:58] ahead the God of this world Mammon hath
[48:02] blinded their eyes remember the
[48:04] scripture says the love of money is the
[48:08] root of all
[48:10] evil but their dealings in death will
[48:13] end soon for this is the age that the
[48:16] spirit cries behold I come quickly even
[48:18] so come quickly Lord
[48:21] Jesus the age the Philadelphian Church
[48:25] age lasted from 1750 50 to about
[48:28] 1906 this age due to the meaning of the
[48:32] name of the city has been called the age
[48:35] of Brotherly
[48:37] Love as Philadelphia means love of
[48:41] Brethren the messenger the messenger to
[48:44] this age was without doubt John Wesley
[48:48] John Wesley was born at edworth June
[48:52] 17th
[48:54] 1703 and was one of 19 children born to
[48:57] Samuel and Susanna Wesley his father was
[49:01] a chaplain in the Church of England but
[49:04] it is more than likely that the
[49:06] religious turn of John's mind was based
[49:09] more upon his mother's exemplary life
[49:13] than upon his father's
[49:15] theology John was a brilliant scholar it
[49:19] was while he was at Oxford that he he
[49:22] and Charles became part of a group who
[49:25] were spiritually EX exercise to worship
[49:27] on the basis of experientially living
[49:31] the truth rather than making Doctrine
[49:35] their standard there's something
[49:37] interesting about
[49:38] that they drew up a spiritual guide of
[49:41] work such as giving to the poor visiting
[49:43] the sick and the imprisoned for this
[49:46] they were called methodists and others
[49:50] other deris of titles now John was
[49:53] sufficiently imbued by the his vision of
[49:56] the need of religion for the peoples of
[49:58] the world that he went to America
[50:02] Georgia as a missionary amongst the
[50:04] Indians on his way there he found that
[50:07] many of the ship's passengers were
[50:10] moravians he was deeply impressed by the
[50:13] meekness peace and courage in all
[50:17] circumstances his labors in Georgia in
[50:20] spite of self-denials and hard work was
[50:23] a
[50:24] failure he returned to England crying I
[50:27] went to America to convert the Indians
[50:29] but oh who shall convert
[50:32] me my must have been a tough time for
[50:35] him back in London he again met the
[50:38] moravians it was Peter bowler who showed
[50:42] him the way of Salvation he was truly
[50:45] Born Again much to the dismay and
[50:48] evident anger of his brother Charles who
[50:51] could not understand how such a
[50:53] spiritual man as John should say that he
[50:56] was not not formally right with
[50:58] God talk about being
[51:01] humble humbling ourselves right it was
[51:05] however not long after that Charles too
[51:08] was saved by grace and that's where I
[51:11] said you know it's interesting how they
[51:14] they were talking about the basis of
[51:17] experientially living the truth rather
[51:19] than making a a book and and Doctrine
[51:22] their standard all we need to do is get
[51:25] saved that's really what we need to do
[51:27] is have a a new birth just get born
[51:30] again and and then we don't need to have
[51:33] a book of dos and don'ts we just live
[51:35] the word amen right
[51:42] my Wesley now began to preach the gospel
[51:45] in those pulpits in London to which he
[51:46] formerly had access but soon they turned
[51:49] him out he didn't fit their mold it was
[51:54] at this time that his old friend George
[51:56] wh
[51:58] Whitefield stood him in a good stead for
[52:01] he invited John to come and meet help
[52:04] him preach in the fields where thousands
[52:07] were listening to the word I think this
[52:10] part's kind of funny Wesley at first was
[52:14] incredulous that he should preach in an
[52:17] in the open instead of a building
[52:19] outside of the normal outside of the
[52:21] routine outside of the tradition right
[52:24] but when he saw the throngs and saw the
[52:27] working of the Gospel in the power of
[52:30] the spirit he turned wholeheartedly to
[52:34] such preaching I say Lord let us see
[52:37] that let us see the the gospel in the
[52:41] power of the spirit in our
[52:44] services the work soon took on such
[52:47] proportions that he began sending out
[52:49] numerous laymen to preach the word this
[52:52] seemed like a parallel to Pentecost
[52:54] where the spirit raised up men with
[52:57] power to preach and teach the word
[52:59] almost
[53:01] overnight there was violent opposition
[53:04] to his work but God was with him the
[53:07] workings of the spirit were mightily
[53:10] manifested and often such a spirit of
[53:13] conviction took a hold of the people as
[53:15] to take away their strength and they
[53:17] would fall to the ground crying in great
[53:21] distress over their
[53:24] sins something about it when someone one
[53:26] truly gets convicted about their lives
[53:29] and they recognize they need a new
[53:32] birth that takes
[53:34] Revelation Wesley was a remarkably
[53:36] strong
[53:38] man he says of himself that he could not
[53:41] remember to have felt lowness of spirits
[53:44] for even a quarter hour since he was
[53:48] born wow he slept no more than six hours
[53:52] a day arose in time to start preaching
[53:55] at 5 practically every day of his
[53:58] ministry preached up to four times on a
[54:02] single day so that in a year he would
[54:05] average over 800
[54:08] sermons he traveled multiple thousands
[54:11] of miles as did his circuit Riders who
[54:14] carried the gospel near and far in fact
[54:17] Wesley traveled 4,500 miles per year by
[54:23] horse that's a lot
[54:26] he was a believer in the power of God
[54:28] and he prayed for the sick with great
[54:30] faith and wonderful results many of his
[54:34] meetings saw the manifestation of
[54:36] spiritual
[54:37] gifts Wesley was not in favor of
[54:41] organization his associates did have a
[54:44] United Society who were a company of men
[54:48] having the form and seeking the power of
[54:51] godliness United in order to pray
[54:54] together to receive the the word of
[54:57] exhortation and to watch over one
[55:00] another in love that they may help each
[55:02] other to work out their
[55:05] salvation I love this the only condition
[55:08] of these of those entering was that they
[55:12] should be of those who had a desire to
[55:15] flee from the Wrath to come and to be
[55:18] saved from their sins yes it's a pretty
[55:21] straightforward requirement yes as time
[55:24] went on they worked worked out a strict
[55:27] set of rules to be used in
[55:29] self-discipline for the good of their
[55:31] souls Wesley recognized that after his
[55:34] death the movement could be organized
[55:37] and the spirit of God leave them to dead
[55:40] form yes we know that's what
[55:43] happened once he remarked that he did
[55:47] not fear that the name of Methodist
[55:49] would leave the Earth but that the
[55:51] spirit might take his flight and we know
[55:54] that's exactly what happened with every
[55:55] single Church age they departed from the
[55:58] word and what happened the spirit took
[56:00] his flight and he we know that he just
[56:02] went on to the next Church
[56:04] age carrying on though he says during
[56:06] his lifetime he could have acquired vast
[56:09] wealth but he did not his favorite
[56:12] saying on the subject of money was get
[56:15] all you can save all you can and give
[56:19] all you can how strange it would be for
[56:22] Wesley to come back and see the
[56:24] denomination that bears the name of
[56:26] Methodist today they are rich vastly
[56:29] rich but the life and power of John
[56:32] Wesley is
[56:34] missing it should also be mentioned that
[56:37] Wesley never did desire to build a work
[56:40] upon a denominational or sectarian basis
[56:44] though he was an Armenian in his beliefs
[56:48] he did not want to separate himself from
[56:50] Brethren on the grounds of Doctrine he
[56:54] was a good candidate for James he based
[56:56] his eternal life on faith and works or
[57:00] the living of life rather than simply
[57:02] accepting a Creed or doctrinal statement
[57:06] John Wesley died at the age of 88 having
[57:10] served God as few men would dare to even
[57:13] think they
[57:15] might I just was thinking about this um
[57:18] I believe you can actually go and see
[57:21] John Wesley's house in England is that
[57:23] right you can actually see the pulpit
[57:25] that he preached from as well when we
[57:27] were there we didn't actually go there
[57:29] it's too bad I know some here
[57:32] have the
[57:34] salutation and to the angel of the
[57:36] church in Philadelphia write these
[57:37] things saith he that is Holy he that is
[57:40] true he that hath the Key of David he
[57:43] that openeth and no man shutteth and
[57:45] shutteth and no man
[57:47] openeth Romans
[57:50] 3:7 oh how beautiful are those words How
[57:53] Majestic is even the sound of them how
[57:57] thrilling to think that all those
[57:59] attributes can be applied to one person
[58:03] who would dare say such things about
[58:06] himself but Jesus Christ the lord of
[58:09] Glory I believe the key to interpreting
[58:12] exactly what each of these wonderfully
[58:15] descriptive phrases means is found in
[58:19] verse
[58:20] 9 in Revelations 3:9 behold I will make
[58:24] them of the synagogue of of Satan which
[58:27] say they are Jews and are not but do lie
[58:31] behold I will make them to come and
[58:34] worship before thy feet and to know that
[58:38] I have loved
[58:40] Thee I say this verse is key because it
[58:43] deals with the Jews who have always
[58:46] called themselves the children of God to
[58:49] the exclusion of everyone
[58:51] else they crucified and killed the Lord
[58:55] Jesus Christ
[58:56] their terrible deed brought their own
[58:59] blood upon their own heads for
[59:03] centuries all because they refused Jesus
[59:06] as their Messiah which indeed he was to
[59:11] them he was not the coming one or the
[59:13] son of David to them he was Beelzebub or
[59:18] some unrighteous one fit only for
[59:23] Destruction my and if you know the
[59:26] stories many of us do know the stories
[59:29] about what happened to the Jews even
[59:31] just in our time world
[59:34] wars is pretty terrible and that was for
[59:38] our sake yes amen all of this blindness
[59:41] was for our sake they had the word made
[59:44] flesh standing in front of them and for
[59:46] some reason for our
[59:48] reason they couldn't actually recognize
[59:50] him what a tremendous
[59:54] blessing he was indeed IM Manuel God
[59:58] manifest In the Flesh he is indeed
[1:00:01] Messiah
[1:00:03] surely he was exactly as he now sets
[1:00:06] himself forth to be there he is the same
[1:00:11] Jesus Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:00:14] and today and
[1:00:16] forever that Holy One in the midst of
[1:00:19] the lampstands is the very same Jesus
[1:00:23] who walked the shores of Galilee who
[1:00:25] healed the sick who raised the dead and
[1:00:29] who in spite of irrefutable proof was
[1:00:33] crucified and killed but he rose again
[1:00:36] and is seated at the right hand of the
[1:00:38] Majesty on high the Jews did not call
[1:00:42] him holy then they do not call him holy
[1:00:46] now but he is the Holy One amen psalm
[1:00:52] 16:10 for thou Wilt not leave my soul in
[1:00:55] heav H neither wilt thou suffer thine
[1:00:59] Holy One to see
[1:01:02] corruption they sought their
[1:01:03] righteousness after the law and failed
[1:01:06] miserably for by the law can no flesh be
[1:01:11] justified by the law can no man be made
[1:01:15] holy Holiness is of the Lord that's why
[1:01:19] the Methodist Doctrine doesn't work you
[1:01:22] can have a book of the methods on how to
[1:01:25] be holy it doesn't take action it takes
[1:01:28] the Lord Jesus Christ 1 Corinthians 1:30
[1:01:33] but of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of
[1:01:37] God is made unto us wisdom and
[1:01:40] righteousness and sanctification and
[1:01:43] Redemption 2 Corinthians 5:12 that we
[1:01:46] might be made the righteousness of God
[1:01:51] in
[1:01:52] him it was Christ or perish and they
[1:01:55] perished for they refused him and Men of
[1:01:59] that age even as even today were making
[1:02:03] the same
[1:02:04] mistake as the Jews took refuge in the
[1:02:07] synagogue form of worship so in the
[1:02:11] Philadelphian age they were taking
[1:02:13] refuge in the
[1:02:16] church it is not joining a church that
[1:02:19] counts the life is not in the church the
[1:02:24] life is in Christ
[1:02:26] amen 1 John 51 and2 this is the record
[1:02:31] that God hath given us eternal life and
[1:02:34] this life is in his
[1:02:37] son he that hath the son hath life he
[1:02:41] that hath not the Son of God hath not
[1:02:47] life I think that some summarizes it all
[1:02:50] right
[1:02:51] there just saying that we have the
[1:02:53] father or we have the son or we have the
[1:02:56] Holy Ghost or we have all three of those
[1:02:59] do we truly have the son we have to have
[1:03:01] the Lord Jesus Christ right that's the
[1:03:04] son and that's what he's referring to
[1:03:06] there man is made Holy by the spirit
[1:03:11] Jesus Christ it is the spirit of
[1:03:14] Holiness that raised Jesus from the dead
[1:03:16] did you ever think of that it was the
[1:03:18] spirit of Holiness that raised Jesus
[1:03:20] from the dead it wasn't just the
[1:03:22] quickening power of God it was the
[1:03:24] spirit of holiness that raised Jesus
[1:03:26] from the dead
[1:03:29] wow and that indwells us and makes us
[1:03:33] holy with his
[1:03:35] Holiness there he stands the Holy One
[1:03:39] and we will stand with him clothed in
[1:03:41] his righteousness
[1:03:43] holy with his
[1:03:46] Holiness now this age is the sixth age
[1:03:50] in the eyes of God time is drawing to a
[1:03:52] close he will soon be coming back soon
[1:03:55] the cry will go forth as he comes
[1:03:58] Revelations
[1:04:00] 22:11 and he which is filthy let him be
[1:04:02] filthy still and he that is righteous
[1:04:04] let him be righteous still and he that
[1:04:06] is Holy let him be holy
[1:04:10] still oh I am so glad that my Holiness
[1:04:14] is not of myself can you say Amen to
[1:04:17] that amen I am glad that I am in Christ
[1:04:21] with all his wonderful attributes of
[1:04:24] righteousness in imputed yay imparted
[1:04:28] unto me blessed be God
[1:04:31] forever these things sayth he that is
[1:04:35] true now his this word true is a very
[1:04:39] wonderful
[1:04:41] word it does not mean true in just a
[1:04:45] sense that it is the opposite to false
[1:04:48] it expresses the perfect realization of
[1:04:52] an idea as contrasted with it partial
[1:04:57] realization for example we recall that
[1:05:00] Jesus said in John
[1:05:02] 6:32 Moses gave you not that bread from
[1:05:06] heaven but my father giveth you the true
[1:05:09] bread from Heaven that's John
[1:05:12] 632 John 15:1 I am the True Vine and my
[1:05:17] father is the husbandman Hebrews 9:24
[1:05:20] for Christ is not entered into the holy
[1:05:23] Place made with hands which are the
[1:05:26] figures of the true but into heaven
[1:05:29] itself now to appear in the presence of
[1:05:33] God for US 1 John
[1:05:37] 2:8 because the darkness is passed and
[1:05:40] the True Light now
[1:05:44] shineth since this word indeed expresses
[1:05:47] perfect
[1:05:48] realization as against the idea of
[1:05:51] partial
[1:05:52] realization as Illustrated in these
[1:05:55] verses
[1:05:57] we can Now understand as never before
[1:06:00] antitype contrast with type and
[1:06:03] substance with
[1:06:05] Shadow take the example now of Mana from
[1:06:09] Heaven God sent down Angel bread from
[1:06:13] heaven for
[1:06:14] Israel but that bread did not satisfy it
[1:06:18] was only good for a day but those who
[1:06:21] ate it were hungry again the next day if
[1:06:25] it was left around it became
[1:06:28] contaminated but Jesus is the true bread
[1:06:31] from Heaven whereof Mana was just a type
[1:06:36] and if any man eats of that bread that
[1:06:39] came from Heaven he will never hunger
[1:06:42] again he does not need to come back and
[1:06:45] eat again the moment he partook he had
[1:06:49] eternal life here indeed was
[1:06:54] reality no need any longer for a shadow
[1:06:57] no need for a partial salvation isn't
[1:07:01] that wonderful no need for a partial
[1:07:04] salvation we're not saved today and lost
[1:07:07] tomorrow we're not going to trip and
[1:07:09] fall and lose that seal of God in our
[1:07:12] lives Hallelujah if you're sealed today
[1:07:14] you're sealed to the day of your
[1:07:16] Redemption if you're sealed tomorrow
[1:07:18] you're sealed to the day of your
[1:07:19] Redemption if you're sealed 40 years ago
[1:07:22] you're sealed to the day of your
[1:07:23] Redemption I love that thought amen my
[1:07:28] no need any longer for a shadow no need
[1:07:30] for a partial salvation here is the
[1:07:33] whole of it just like Jesus isn't a part
[1:07:36] of
[1:07:38] God he is God
[1:07:41] Amen no one could deny that Israel had
[1:07:45] light they were the only people who had
[1:07:48] light as a nation it was as when Egypt
[1:07:52] was so dark that one could feel it
[1:07:56] but in the homes of the Israelites there
[1:07:58] was light amen but now True Light is
[1:08:02] come the light of the world is Jesus
[1:08:05] Moses and the prophets brought the light
[1:08:08] by means of the scripture relative to
[1:08:11] the Messiah thus Israel had light but
[1:08:14] now the Fulfillment of the light has
[1:08:16] come and what was but glowing word has
[1:08:20] now broken forth in the brightness of
[1:08:22] God manifested amongst his people
[1:08:26] as the pillar of fire gave light at
[1:08:28] night and that was wonderful now light
[1:08:32] and life were manifested in the fullness
[1:08:35] of the godhead
[1:08:38] bodily Israel used to take the red heer
[1:08:40] and sacrifice her upon the Altar for the
[1:08:43] remission of sins for a ye a year the
[1:08:47] sins of the guilty one was covered but
[1:08:51] that covering could not take away the
[1:08:53] desire for sin
[1:08:56] it's so beautiful brothers and sisters
[1:08:58] because if you you you've experienced it
[1:09:00] you know that that was in the past that
[1:09:03] was the partial now the full is you can
[1:09:06] actually have one sacrifice the
[1:09:09] realization that one sacrifice was made
[1:09:12] already you don't even have to do it you
[1:09:14] just have to accept that it was done and
[1:09:16] it's done for good and it takes away the
[1:09:18] desire to sin in our lives we don't have
[1:09:22] to have the
[1:09:24] desire he he says it it was not a
[1:09:26] perfect offering it was a shadow until
[1:09:29] the real came along so each year the man
[1:09:32] would sacrifice and each year come back
[1:09:36] he still had the same desire to sin the
[1:09:39] life of the animal atoned for his sin
[1:09:42] I'm going to throw this in there for
[1:09:44] those people that don't actually give
[1:09:46] themselves over completely to the full
[1:09:48] baptism of the Holy Ghost they still
[1:09:51] have the desire to sin there is a
[1:09:55] difference if you don't go all the way
[1:09:58] if you go all the way through
[1:09:59] justification all the way through
[1:10:01] sanctification and just stop right there
[1:10:03] at the river and don't cross over you're
[1:10:06] going to be just like they were in
[1:10:07] Israel amen come to church and have a
[1:10:10] tremendous service make your sacrifice
[1:10:12] your worship and then go home and you'll
[1:10:14] have the same problems over and over
[1:10:16] again but if you ever one time just give
[1:10:18] over like we read on Sunday just just
[1:10:20] try it one time and see what happens
[1:10:22] brother Bram said love that quote he
[1:10:25] says but being animal blood that was
[1:10:28] shed and animal life that was given it
[1:10:32] could not come back upon the man if it
[1:10:35] had come back it still would not have
[1:10:38] availed but when Christ the perfect
[1:10:41] substitute was given and it was he was
[1:10:45] and his blood was shed and it was and
[1:10:48] the life that was in Christ came back
[1:10:50] upon the repentant Sinner and that life
[1:10:53] being the perfect life of Christ
[1:10:56] sinless and righteous then the guilty
[1:10:58] one could go free for he had no desire
[1:11:02] to sin the life of Jesus had come back
[1:11:06] upon him that is what is meant in Romans
[1:11:09] 8:2 the law of the spirit of life in
[1:11:13] Christ Jesus hath made me free from the
[1:11:17] law of sin and death now what is sin
[1:11:21] brothers and sisters carousing smoking
[1:11:24] drinking
[1:11:26] gambling all the different attributes of
[1:11:29] sin we need to remember and and just I I
[1:11:32] believe speak it sin in its raw form is
[1:11:38] unbelief unbelief in the word of God
[1:11:41] that it doesn't have the life that we're
[1:11:43] talking about to deliver us to save us
[1:11:46] from sin but when we can actually take
[1:11:48] that per perfect realization of Truth in
[1:11:52] our day and apply it to our lives say
[1:11:55] hey I believe that I don't understand it
[1:11:57] I can't explain it but I believe it
[1:11:59] something takes place in our lives and I
[1:12:01] can't help but think that's exactly what
[1:12:03] happened to Mary I can't understand it I
[1:12:05] I I can't explain it I just know that I
[1:12:07] saw an angel and that angel said that a
[1:12:09] virgin shall conceive and that you are
[1:12:11] highly favored amongst women I want to
[1:12:13] say tonight brothers and sisters if you
[1:12:15] have the ability to hear this word you
[1:12:17] are highly favored among the female
[1:12:19] women the church amen that perfect
[1:12:23] realization sets you free
[1:12:26] amen but the Jews back there in the time
[1:12:29] of Jesus did not want to accept that
[1:12:31] sacrifice and even today some people
[1:12:33] they just don't want to accept that
[1:12:34] sacrifice they'll go most of the way I
[1:12:37] want to tell you tonight go all the way
[1:12:38] brothers and sisters don't be like those
[1:12:41] Jews back there and go part way the
[1:12:43] blood of bulls and goats made nothing
[1:12:46] perfect it was once God's ordained
[1:12:48] method but now Christ having appeared in
[1:12:51] the flesh and by the shedding of his own
[1:12:53] blood has put away sin and by that
[1:12:57] offering of himself has made us
[1:13:01] perfect the Jews would not take that but
[1:13:04] what about that Philadelphian age and
[1:13:07] yes the other ages
[1:13:10] too did they really accept this reality
[1:13:12] in Christ no sir even though Luther
[1:13:16] brought the truth of justification the
[1:13:18] romish church and its eastern
[1:13:20] counterpart the Orthodox Church still
[1:13:23] clung to works now where works are fine
[1:13:26] but they don't save you right they don't
[1:13:29] make you perfect amen it is Christ or
[1:13:33] perish and it is not even Christ and
[1:13:38] works it's not even Christ and works
[1:13:40] brothers and sisters it's Christ Alone
[1:13:44] amen it's Christ alone and I want to say
[1:13:47] this when we do have Christ alone all
[1:13:50] the signs all the Wonders all the works
[1:13:53] everything else manifests and sometimes
[1:13:56] it's not perfect sometimes it looks
[1:13:57] really scattered but it doesn't matter
[1:14:00] so long as it's obedience to the
[1:14:03] word this age began the years of
[1:14:07] armenis that does not believe in Christ
[1:14:10] as the
[1:14:11] reality it does not sing of nothing but
[1:14:15] the blood for it sings of nothing but
[1:14:18] the blood and my own
[1:14:22] conduct now I believe in Good Conduct
[1:14:25] if you are saved you will do
[1:14:29] righteously we have already gone over
[1:14:31] that but let me tell you now salvation
[1:14:35] is not Jesus
[1:14:37] plus it is Jesus alone
[1:14:41] amen I just wish people who were critics
[1:14:44] of this message of the hour of William
[1:14:46] Mary and Bram would just hear these
[1:14:48] words would just read these words right
[1:14:50] how could you say that it's a cult and
[1:14:52] then he's drawing men after himself
[1:14:55] right he's pointing them to Christ
[1:14:58] saying very clearly that it's only his
[1:15:00] blood his sacrifice
[1:15:03] alone salvation is of the Lord from
[1:15:07] start to finish it's all
[1:15:09] God let his life be in me that it be his
[1:15:14] blood that cleanses me let it be his
[1:15:17] spirit that fills me let it be his word
[1:15:21] in my heart and my mouth let it be his
[1:15:24] stripes that heal me Let It Be Jesus and
[1:15:27] Jesus alone not by works of
[1:15:29] righteousness which I have done no sir
[1:15:32] Christ is my life
[1:15:34] amen thank you
[1:15:38] Lord I believe we could close up and go
[1:15:40] home right after that man that's just
[1:15:43] awesome I feel I could just go on and on
[1:15:46] about these truths but I will give you
[1:15:49] one more thought it's about that
[1:15:51] wonderful hymn that AB Simpson wrote
[1:15:55] once it was the blessing now it is the
[1:15:58] Lord once it was the feeling now it is
[1:16:02] his word once his gift I wanted now The
[1:16:07] Giver own once I sought for healing now
[1:16:11] himself alone amen all and all forever
[1:16:15] Jesus will I sing Everything in Jesus
[1:16:18] and Jesus everything does anybody here
[1:16:21] know that
[1:16:23] himym can we sing that him
[1:16:25] sometime I don't think tonight I I I
[1:16:28] wouldn't I don't know it myself I just
[1:16:31] was thinking that's just wonderful
[1:16:33] because that's it right there isn't it
[1:16:35] amen there isn't anything in this life
[1:16:38] satisfying as it may be as good and as
[1:16:42] fine as it may be but you will find the
[1:16:45] sum total of all perfection in Christ
[1:16:49] everything Fades into
[1:16:52] insignificance beside him amen that's
[1:16:55] what the new birth is you become a new
[1:16:57] creature in Christ Jesus you can't feed
[1:16:59] at the old slop troughs that you used to
[1:17:01] go to and and you still try to this
[1:17:04] flesh doesn't die easy keeps taking you
[1:17:07] back but
[1:17:09] gradually slowly day by day service by
[1:17:13] service tape by
[1:17:16] tape on and on you go all of those nasty
[1:17:20] things in our lives start to fade
[1:17:22] away if we put him first truly first
[1:17:26] amen he that hath the Key of David this
[1:17:29] beautiful phrase follows and comes out
[1:17:31] of the preceding phrase he that is true
[1:17:34] Christ the perfect realization
[1:17:37] contrasted with partial realization here
[1:17:41] it is Moses was a prophet of God but
[1:17:44] Jesus like unto Moses was the prophet of
[1:17:50] God excuse
[1:17:53] me David a man after God's Own Heart was
[1:17:57] king of Israel but Jesus is the greater
[1:18:00] David king of kings and Lord of lords
[1:18:03] God very
[1:18:05] God now David was born of the tribe of
[1:18:08] Judah out of whom no priest came yet he
[1:18:12] ate of the Sho bread reserved for
[1:18:15] priests he was the great warrior
[1:18:17] overcoming the enemy establishing the
[1:18:20] people as king he sat on the throne he
[1:18:23] was prophet he was a wonderful type of
[1:18:26] Christ my Isaiah 22:22 and the key of
[1:18:30] the House of David will I lay upon his
[1:18:34] shoulder and he shall open and None
[1:18:36] Shall shut and he shall shut and None
[1:18:40] Shall
[1:18:41] open the spirit uses this Old Testament
[1:18:44] reference concerning the Lord Jesus
[1:18:46] Christ and his ministry in the
[1:18:50] church what the Key of David signified
[1:18:53] at that time is mere Shadow which is now
[1:18:57] fulfilled in Jesus standing in the midst
[1:19:00] of the
[1:19:02] lampstands it has to do with our Lord
[1:19:05] after his resurrection and not his
[1:19:07] Earthly pilgrimage but what does the key
[1:19:11] signify the answer lies in the position
[1:19:15] of the
[1:19:16] key it is not in his hand it is not worn
[1:19:20] around his neck it is not placed in the
[1:19:23] hands of of other men or the verse could
[1:19:27] not be saying that he alone has the use
[1:19:30] of that key for he alone opens and shuts
[1:19:34] and no man has that right but Jesus
[1:19:39] himself isn't that
[1:19:41] right but where is the key it's on his
[1:19:45] shoulder but what does his shoulder have
[1:19:48] to do with
[1:19:51] it and the government shall be upon his
[1:19:54] shoulders Isaiah 9
[1:19:56] and6 but what does this mean the answer
[1:19:59] is the phrase government upon his
[1:20:02] shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony
[1:20:05] of the East when the bride has been
[1:20:08] committed to the groom she takes off her
[1:20:10] veil and places it over the groom's
[1:20:14] shoulders signifying that not only is
[1:20:17] she under his Dominion that she has
[1:20:20] transferred her rights to him that he is
[1:20:24] the head but also that he Bears the
[1:20:28] responsibility and the care and that he
[1:20:32] and he
[1:20:33] alone no one else no other man no other
[1:20:39] power has any right and
[1:20:43] responsibility I just can't help but
[1:20:45] think the last wedding that we witnessed
[1:20:48] just ask brother Tois so is that
[1:20:50] right that's what we do we assume that
[1:20:53] when the bride takes her veil off and
[1:20:56] places it upon the groom's shoulder that
[1:21:00] signifies
[1:21:02] ownership God being Sovereign now I I
[1:21:05] don't mean that in a bad way the
[1:21:07] husbands don't own their wives I'm not
[1:21:09] saying that you know what you mean
[1:21:11] brother yeah good just want to make sure
[1:21:13] we're clear
[1:21:16] there anyway God being Sovereign he
[1:21:19] forew by Divine decree exactly who would
[1:21:23] be in his bride he chose her he did not
[1:21:27] she did not choose him he called her she
[1:21:32] did not come on her own he died for her
[1:21:36] he washed her in his own blood he paid
[1:21:40] the price for her she belongs to him and
[1:21:44] to him
[1:21:45] alone she is wholly committed to him and
[1:21:49] he accepts the obligation thank you Lord
[1:21:53] amen he is her head for Christ is the
[1:21:56] head of his church as Sarah called
[1:21:59] Abraham Lord even so the bride is happy
[1:22:04] that he is her Lord amen he speaks and
[1:22:08] she obeys for that is her Delight
[1:22:14] amen but have men heeded this truth have
[1:22:18] they esteemed his person who alone has
[1:22:21] the full Sovereign authority over his
[1:22:24] church church I say no for in every age
[1:22:28] the church has been governed by a
[1:22:31] hierarchy a priesthood an Apostolic
[1:22:36] succession closing the door of mercy and
[1:22:39] Grace To whom it will and instead of
[1:22:43] assuming the love and responsibility of
[1:22:45] the
[1:22:47] church it has with mercenary lust prayed
[1:22:52] upon her and destroyed her
[1:22:54] the clergy lived in luxury while the
[1:22:57] poor Church fed on the husks of
[1:23:01] abuse and not one age did any different
[1:23:06] each bound itself to organization and
[1:23:08] put the government upon men and
[1:23:12] committed the church to that
[1:23:15] government dare let the people rise up
[1:23:19] and they were brutally suppressed or
[1:23:21] cast out every denomination ation has
[1:23:26] the same Spirit every denomination
[1:23:29] swears that it has the key to the
[1:23:33] government of the church every
[1:23:36] denomination claims that it opens the
[1:23:39] door but that is not true it is Jesus
[1:23:44] and Jesus alone amen isn't that good
[1:23:47] isn't that clear isn't that clean
[1:23:50] doesn't it make it just so easy to
[1:23:52] understand my
[1:23:55] Jesus and Jesus
[1:23:58] alone he sets the members in the body he
[1:24:03] endows them with their Ministries he
[1:24:06] puts the gifts at her disposal he cares
[1:24:10] for her and guides her she is his sole
[1:24:16] property and he has no other one but her
[1:24:21] amen
[1:24:23] amen what a far cry from reality is this
[1:24:26] church age in which we live amen and one
[1:24:30] day
[1:24:31] soon these men that even now prepare to
[1:24:36] speak for the church will be rising up
[1:24:39] in The ecumenical move to place a living
[1:24:43] Antichrist at the head of their
[1:24:47] organization which deposes the
[1:24:50] Lord and we will find him Christ outside
[1:24:54] the church Revelations 3:20 behold I
[1:24:58] stand at the door and knock If any man
[1:25:01] hear my voice and open the door I will
[1:25:04] come into him and I will s with him and
[1:25:08] he with me I think it is Hoffman that
[1:25:12] did that picture of Christ on the
[1:25:14] outside holding a lanon knocking at the
[1:25:17] door um but we know that it's been said
[1:25:21] that someone mentioned uh there's
[1:25:23] something wrong with a picture yeah and
[1:25:26] that is that there's no door handle on
[1:25:27] the outside of the door and remember the
[1:25:30] story brother brandham said this he told
[1:25:32] the the explanation of this he said the
[1:25:35] door handle isn't supposed to be on the
[1:25:36] outside of the door it's supposed to be
[1:25:39] Christ on the outside knocking on the
[1:25:41] outside of the door the door handles on
[1:25:43] the inside of the house and that house
[1:25:46] is the heart of the
[1:25:49] Believers it's just such a beautiful
[1:25:52] picture I remember when I was a kid
[1:25:54] my grandparents in in Red Deer they
[1:25:56] actually had that picture and I uh I
[1:25:59] remember just looking at it as a little
[1:26:01] kid a tiny little kid one of my earliest
[1:26:02] memories seeing that picture and just
[1:26:05] looking at it something was I don't know
[1:26:07] attracting me to it I guess I can see
[1:26:09] now why but kind of interesting but let
[1:26:13] me say this our Lord is not defeated men
[1:26:16] claim to open the door to God and shut
[1:26:19] the door but they are liars John 637
[1:26:23] to39 n all that the father giveth me
[1:26:26] shall come to me and him that cometh to
[1:26:29] me will I know will I in no wise cast
[1:26:34] out for I came down from heaven not to
[1:26:36] do my own will but the will of him that
[1:26:39] sent me and this is the Father's will
[1:26:42] which hath sent me that of all which he
[1:26:46] hath given me I should lose nothing but
[1:26:49] should raise it up again at the last day
[1:26:52] amen and when that last elected member
[1:26:57] to the body of Christ comes in then will
[1:27:01] our Lord appear and I just can't help
[1:27:04] but think that's that's a sentence in my
[1:27:07] book it's actually a paragraph but that
[1:27:09] that one sentence is where we live isn't
[1:27:11] it it's what we're looking towards it's
[1:27:14] what we're hoping for it's what we're
[1:27:17] agonizing to see happen and we don't
[1:27:19] know that person could be in already and
[1:27:22] they just need to come to the full real
[1:27:24] ization there could be many people that
[1:27:26] need to come to the full realization we
[1:27:28] don't know we don't want to put anybody
[1:27:30] in or out we just want to continue to
[1:27:32] encourage one another to Jesus
[1:27:35] Christ the Key of David was not David
[1:27:39] the king of Israel all
[1:27:41] Israel and is not Jesus the son of David
[1:27:44] according to the fact that he will sit
[1:27:46] upon the throne of David in the
[1:27:48] Millennium and Reign and rule over his
[1:27:51] Heritage surely so the key of David
[1:27:55] signifies that it is Jesus who will
[1:27:58] bring in the
[1:27:59] Millennium he who has the keys to death
[1:28:02] and hell will raise up his own that they
[1:28:06] may share in his reign of righteousness
[1:28:09] upon the Earth how wonderful that our
[1:28:13] Lord has all the answers truly in him
[1:28:18] are all the promises of God fulfilled
[1:28:22] amen truly by being in in him we are
[1:28:26] hires to what he has purchased for
[1:28:29] us yes there he stands the Lord Of Glory
[1:28:34] once as the father he was surrounded by
[1:28:37] the Angels the archangels the cherubims
[1:28:41] the seraphim and the whole host of
[1:28:43] Heaven crying holy holy holy is the Lord
[1:28:46] God of
[1:28:48] hosts such was his Holiness that no man
[1:28:51] could approach unto him but now we see
[1:28:54] him in the church Glory sharing his own
[1:28:58] Holiness with us until in him we have
[1:29:02] become the very righteousness of God yes
[1:29:06] there he stands Jesus perfect everything
[1:29:09] lily of the valley the bright and
[1:29:11] Morning Star the fairest of 10,000 Alpha
[1:29:15] and Omega root and offspring of David
[1:29:18] Father Son and Holy Ghost the all in all
[1:29:23] amen Isa Isaiah 9 and6 For unto us a
[1:29:26] child is born and unto us a son is given
[1:29:30] and the government shall be upon his
[1:29:32] shoulder and his name Shall be Called
[1:29:34] wonderful counselor the Mighty God the
[1:29:37] Everlasting father the Prince of
[1:29:40] Peace in him is perfect fulfillment amen
[1:29:45] though once we esteemed him not now we
[1:29:49] love him with joy unspeakable and full
[1:29:53] of Glory anybody say Amen to that amen
[1:29:57] oh my Amen in him is perfect fulfillment
[1:30:01] this world is looking for so much
[1:30:03] fulfillment whether it's travel whether
[1:30:05] it's
[1:30:07] entertainment all manner of
[1:30:10] things though once we esteemed him not
[1:30:13] we didn't know about Jesus even if we
[1:30:15] did I remember telling to someone there
[1:30:17] was a time in my life where I thought
[1:30:19] Christians were just weak because they
[1:30:22] they couldn't stand on their own
[1:30:24] they had to have a crutch they had to
[1:30:26] have something to to be a member of
[1:30:29] because they just couldn't get over it
[1:30:31] whatever it was in their life without
[1:30:33] realizing that there's such a
[1:30:35] fulfillment in knowing Jesus
[1:30:38] Christ but I personally think because I
[1:30:41] just never really met him personally
[1:30:43] myself it wasn't the time appointed of
[1:30:46] the father but boy when that time comes
[1:30:48] this becomes so real to the individual
[1:30:51] Hallelujah it it's perfect fulfillment
[1:30:53] in him though once we esteemed him not
[1:30:56] now we love him with joy unspeakable and
[1:30:59] full of Glory that's why you can't stay
[1:31:00] away from church when there's time to go
[1:31:02] to church it's an opportunity to go and
[1:31:05] worship it's like brother mvin was
[1:31:07] talking about when it's time to tithe
[1:31:09] when we get our paycheck we can't wait
[1:31:11] to actually tithe on that check not
[1:31:13] because anything that's going to happen
[1:31:15] because there's such a blessing that's
[1:31:17] attached to it and it comes in so many
[1:31:20] different
[1:31:21] forms though once we esteemed him not
[1:31:23] now we love him with joy unspeakable and
[1:31:25] full of Glory I just can't stop reading
[1:31:28] that in the midst of the church he
[1:31:29] stands and we will sing his praise for
[1:31:33] he the mighty conqueror is head over the
[1:31:35] church which is his
[1:31:37] bride he bought that bride he owns her
[1:31:42] she is his and his alone and he cares
[1:31:45] for her he is our King and we are his
[1:31:48] kingdom his eternal possession thank you
[1:31:51] Lord my if we're his bride and we
[1:31:53] recognize
[1:31:54] that he alone cares for her what do we
[1:31:57] have to fear brothers and sisters
[1:31:59] whether we live whether we die we're
[1:32:01] Christ amen now you will recall that at
[1:32:05] the beginning of verse 7 I said that
[1:32:07] verse 9 would help us to understand it I
[1:32:10] hope you saw what I meant Jesus set
[1:32:14] himself forth as the he that is Holy
[1:32:17] true or the only
[1:32:20] reality the one with the Key of David
[1:32:23] the the one who opened and
[1:32:26] shut and that is exactly true those
[1:32:30] phrases describe him perfectly but the
[1:32:34] Jews in his day refused him and all he
[1:32:37] was they rejected their Savior and all
[1:32:40] he meant to them and the nominal
[1:32:42] Christian has now done the
[1:32:45] same they have done what the Jews did
[1:32:48] exactly and we know that brother branam
[1:32:52] the prophet the Vindicated prophet he
[1:32:54] preached a message I indict this
[1:32:58] generation for the second crucifixion of
[1:33:01] the Lord Jesus Christ the indictment and
[1:33:04] the reason he did that was God himself
[1:33:07] had to say it to the people and that's
[1:33:09] what he's referring to here they
[1:33:11] rejected the word when the word came
[1:33:14] because the word didn't come the way
[1:33:17] they thought that it should come and
[1:33:19] that's exactly the way it was for the
[1:33:21] Jews they thought that it should come in
[1:33:23] a great procession all of the banisters
[1:33:26] of Heaven should open up and the king of
[1:33:28] kings and Lord of Lord the Messiah
[1:33:30] should come down the
[1:33:32] banister step right into Israel and
[1:33:34] deliver them and he did but they
[1:33:37] rejected him because he didn't come the
[1:33:40] way they thought he should same thing
[1:33:42] today brothers and sisters they did what
[1:33:45] the Jews did exactly the Jews crucified
[1:33:48] him and then turned on the True Believer
[1:33:52] the nominal Christian has crucified him
[1:33:54] aresh and turned on the true church to
[1:33:58] destroy it but God is true and he who is
[1:34:02] above all will yet return and when he
[1:34:05] does he will show who the only potentate
[1:34:09] is and as he proves himself to the world
[1:34:13] and all the world bows at his feet at
[1:34:16] that time all the world will bow at the
[1:34:19] feet of the Saints proving that they
[1:34:22] were right in their St with him blessed
[1:34:25] be God forever
[1:34:29] amen the age of the open door
[1:34:32] Revelations
[1:34:33] 3:8 I Know Thy Works behold I have set
[1:34:38] before thee an open door and no man can
[1:34:41] shut it for thou Hast a little strength
[1:34:45] and has has kept my word and H has not
[1:34:47] denied my name
[1:34:50] amen the first phrase of this verse I
[1:34:52] Know Thy work
[1:34:54] is analyzed in the rest of the verse for
[1:34:57] their Works had to do with the open door
[1:35:01] little strength the word and the name
[1:35:05] Amen in order to understand the wealth
[1:35:07] of meaning involved in behold I set
[1:35:10] before you an open door and no man can
[1:35:13] shut it we must now recall what has been
[1:35:16] said about each age running over into
[1:35:20] another age there is an overlapping
[1:35:24] a melting or Fading Into rather than an
[1:35:28] Abrupt end and a clearcut start this age
[1:35:32] particularly flows into the next age and
[1:35:35] not only does this age
[1:35:39] overflow into the last age but the last
[1:35:42] age is in many respects simply a
[1:35:44] carrying on of the sixth age the seventh
[1:35:48] age a very short age gathers up into
[1:35:52] itself for one quick work all of the
[1:35:55] evil of every age and yet all the
[1:35:59] reality of
[1:36:01] Pentecost once the Philadelphian age has
[1:36:04] about run its chorus the leoan age
[1:36:08] quickly comes in bringing both the tears
[1:36:11] and the wheat to harvest Matthew
[1:36:15] 13:30 first bind the tears to burn them
[1:36:18] but gather the wheat into my
[1:36:21] barn remember please that the sardan age
[1:36:26] started the Reformation that must still
[1:36:29] go on until the grain that was planted
[1:36:32] at Pentecost goes through the full cycle
[1:36:35] of planting watering nourishing Etc
[1:36:39] until it comes right back to the
[1:36:41] original
[1:36:42] seed while this is going on the tears
[1:36:45] that were sewn will have to go through
[1:36:48] their cycle and be harvested also that
[1:36:52] is exactly
[1:36:54] what we see
[1:36:55] happening if you can just think of the
[1:36:58] seasons you can get a very good picture
[1:37:00] of this the plant that you see growing
[1:37:04] in full strength in summer suddenly
[1:37:07] appears to be going to
[1:37:09] seed you can't tell exactly when summer
[1:37:12] became Autumn it just faded into it
[1:37:17] that's I just can't help but think of
[1:37:19] this year how summer went into Autumn
[1:37:21] and it just went on and on and on and
[1:37:23] then suddenly boom winter there was
[1:37:26] really not much
[1:37:28] blending you can't tell exactly when
[1:37:30] summer became Autumn it just faded into
[1:37:33] it that is how the ages are and
[1:37:36] especially these last
[1:37:38] two it is to this age that Jesus says I
[1:37:42] come quickly verse 11 that makes the
[1:37:46] last age a very short one Le
[1:37:50] oysa is the age of the quick work it's
[1:37:55] cut
[1:37:55] short now we will specify we will
[1:37:59] specifically dwell on the open door that
[1:38:03] no man can shut first of all I want to
[1:38:06] dwell on the door as signifying the
[1:38:10] tremendous missionary effort of that age
[1:38:13] Paul called a new missionary Endeavor
[1:38:16] for the Lord an Open Door in 2
[1:38:19] Corinthians 2:12 furthermore when I came
[1:38:22] to troas to preach Christ's gospel and a
[1:38:25] door was opened unto me of the Lord so
[1:38:29] we can see by the comparison of
[1:38:31] scriptures that this door this Open Door
[1:38:35] signified the greatest spreading of the
[1:38:37] Gospel that the world has ever
[1:38:40] seen I want you to see something here
[1:38:43] I'll call the musicians as we close I
[1:38:46] want you to see something here God works
[1:38:49] in threes doesn't he it was in the third
[1:38:52] or per ban age that the church was
[1:38:56] married to the state the Deeds of the
[1:38:59] nians had become the doctrine of the
[1:39:03] nicians that age was the open door for
[1:39:07] the false Vine once it was backed up by
[1:39:11] the power of the state it became
[1:39:13] actually a world system even though it
[1:39:17] bore the name
[1:39:19] Christian thus it spread like
[1:39:21] wildfire but now Three Ages later after
[1:39:25] a long and hard struggle of Faith here
[1:39:29] comes the open door to the truth amen
[1:39:33] the word of the Lord now has its day of
[1:39:37] course the fifth age had set the stage
[1:39:40] for this Mighty move as that age gave us
[1:39:44] exploration colonization the printing of
[1:39:47] books
[1:39:49] Etc it would have been wonderful if this
[1:39:52] Open Door had followed the Divine
[1:39:54] pattern of Pentecost which was set forth
[1:39:57] in Hebrews
[1:39:59] 2 therefore we ought to give the more
[1:40:02] Earnest heed to the things which we have
[1:40:05] heard lest at any time we should let
[1:40:08] them slip maybe stand with me as we
[1:40:11] close tonight for if the word spoken by
[1:40:14] Angels was
[1:40:16] steadfast and every transgression and
[1:40:19] Disobedience received a just recompense
[1:40:22] of reward
[1:40:24] how shall we escape if we neglect so
[1:40:27] great
[1:40:28] salvation which at the first began to be
[1:40:31] spoken by the Lord and was confirmed to
[1:40:35] unto us by them that heard him God also
[1:40:39] bearing them witness both with signs and
[1:40:43] wonders and with diverse Miracles and
[1:40:46] Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his
[1:40:49] will I'll just stop there tonight we'll
[1:40:53] pick up from there next week Lord
