[31:30] amen Lord bless you
[31:33] all woke up real early this morning and
[31:37] normally I wouldn't get out of bed I'd
[31:38] just roll back over but I got up
[31:42] and started conversing with the Lord it
[31:46] was a beautiful
[31:50] time the poem came on my heart qu the
[31:53] manifestations of the sons of
[31:56] God but all throughout the day I was
[31:58] contemplating and thinking on that's
[32:02] great but how' we get
[32:04] there and I started looking through my
[32:06] older poems and this poem came on my
[32:11] heart it's called lightf
[32:13] footed and I'm sure we're all familiar
[32:15] with brother brandham when he talked
[32:17] about when he first experienced
[32:19] salvation and he talked about being
[32:21] light
[32:22] footed it's a good thing to read about
[32:24] it it's another thing to experience it
[32:27] for yourself so this is a poem called
[32:31] light
[32:32] footed in a world of
[32:34] Shadows I once
[32:37] walked with burdens heavy my spirit
[32:41] bed but then came a moment So
[32:46] Divine becoming lightf footed I by his
[32:50] grace
[32:51] aligned I remember when the Lord forgave
[32:54] me a million pounds lifted my soul set
[32:59] free I glanced at the heavens tears
[33:03] welled my eyes no longer burdened a
[33:07] weightless
[33:08] surprise like a feather drifting on a
[33:11] gentle breeze I floated towards home
[33:15] with effort effortless ease no steps
[33:19] were taken yet I moved so Fleet his
[33:23] forgiveness in my heart does beat weight
[33:27] of my sins now vanished and gone a
[33:31] broken Spirit mend it and
[33:34] drawn I embrace the light with every
[33:38] stride a forgiven sinner in his love to
[33:43] abide by the song of forgiveness Joy did
[33:48] sound Freedom's Melody my soul this does
[33:53] surround no longer built Bound by guilt
[33:57] I dance with delight light footed my
[34:01] spirit Soares to new heights the Lord's
[34:05] forgiveness a treasure told unburdened
[34:09] my spirit forever bold I walk towards
[34:12] home all cloudless days by the gift of
[34:17] Salvation I found my
[34:20] way remember dear friend when darkness
[34:25] looms and your heart feels heavy weigh
[34:28] it down by Gloom seek the Lord's
[34:31] forgiveness let his light be your guide
[34:35] and like a feather dance through life
[34:38] light footed in Grace always abide we're

[43:42] shins Lord according to her faith as she
[43:44] came forward Lord thank you for meeting
[43:47] each and every need tonight Lord in the
[43:49] hearts of your children may maybe many
[43:51] needs unspoken tonight father but we
[43:53] know that you know and we just commit
[43:55] them all into your hands father For Your
[43:58] Glory we love you we thank you we ask
[44:01] all these things now in Jesus Christ's
[44:03] name we pray
[44:05] amen amen God bless you thank you
[44:09] musicians certainly nice to have the
[44:11] violin
[44:12] back God bless you brother
[44:15] Aiden certainly good to see the healing
[44:18] touch of the Lord in your family if you
[44:21] have your Bibles tonight I would just
[44:22] like to read from Revelations chapter 1
[44:26] just pick up from where
[44:27] we kind of left off last
[44:31] time the exposition of the seven Church
[44:39] ages John in the patmas vision for the
[44:44] brown I'm talking about
[44:45] John Revelations
[44:49] 1:10 I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[44:53] day and heard behind me a great voice as
[44:56] of a
[44:58] trumpet may God add a blessing to the
[45:00] reading of his word you may be seated
[45:04] tonight just think it's such a a
[45:06] beautiful
[45:08] scripture and uh you know how John found
[45:12] himself in the spirit on the Lord's day
[45:14] and we are a type
[45:17] of John John being a type of the Bride
[45:21] how important it is for us to get in the
[45:23] spirit and you know we talked about it
[45:25] last time and I think I'll probably wind
[45:28] up dwelling on this for quite some time
[45:30] um I want to get further in the book
[45:32] tonight but just how important it is to
[45:36] get in the spirit amen and how how
[45:40] destructive and deceptive this world is
[45:43] to try and capture our attention into
[45:45] other avenues and other things to take
[45:49] our attention away from getting in the
[45:51] spirit and you know getting in the
[45:53] spirit isn't just about coming to
[45:55] service and getting into the spirit even
[45:57] though it truly is getting in the spirit
[45:59] is the whole of the Christian life is
[46:01] what brother branam said and we read
[46:03] that I'm not going to say it tonight but
[46:05] you know when we truly actually get into
[46:08] the spirit it's something that's
[46:10] revealed by the spirit confirmed by the
[46:12] word and then it's made manifest by the
[46:15] results that it bears and if it doesn't
[46:17] get us in the spirit by the results that
[46:19] it Bears brothers and sisters it's not
[46:21] the right thing and we need to stop it
[46:23] and we need to look towards Jesus we
[46:25] need to change our direction and you
[46:27] know if we don't have uh a revelation
[46:29] about how to do that if we're not sure
[46:32] about how we can actually fix that the
[46:34] only thing we need to do is actually ask
[46:36] the Lord in Earnest if you genuinely ask
[46:39] the Lord for something he will genuinely
[46:41] answer you we know his word says draw
[46:45] nigh unto me and I will draw nigh unto
[46:47] you if we're willing to take that jump
[46:50] brother Bram said it like that little
[46:51] baby eagle if we're willing to take that
[46:53] jump he'll be there to catch us amen but
[46:56] we've got to be willing to make that
[46:57] jump and you know if we have things in
[47:00] our lives that we just don't seem to get
[47:02] Beyond or overcome and it's just an
[47:04] endless cycle we talked about it on
[47:06] Sunday it's not because the Lord wants
[47:09] to punish us or drag us through the
[47:10] knole sideways it's because he wants to
[47:13] see us grow and he will allow us to go
[47:15] through things to see that growth
[47:17] because the only thing he's interested
[47:19] in is spiritual growth he's not in our
[47:22] interested in our Christianity our
[47:24] churchianity he's not interested in how
[47:26] many quotes we know how long we've been
[47:28] in the message how long we've been
[47:31] around Believers he's not interested in
[47:32] any of that what he's interested in is
[47:34] our own individual walks with him and to
[47:36] see that we're growing spiritually
[47:37] because if you're not growing brothers
[47:39] and sisters you're dying speaking of
[47:41] myself here we are dying if we're not
[47:44] growing it's important for us to get in
[47:46] the spirit amen you know where we left
[47:48] off last last week I'll just uh I'll
[47:51] just pick up with paragraph 18 of the
[47:54] exposition of the seven Church ages is
[47:55] in the spirit on the Lord's day out of
[47:58] the patmas vision he says here it is
[48:01] prophesied right here in Isaiah and it
[48:04] came to pass about 700 years later at
[48:06] Pentecost when they were all filled with
[48:09] the Holy Ghost exactly as it was said
[48:12] they would be this is the true Sabbath
[48:15] that was promised thus when they were
[48:18] filled with the Holy Ghost they ceased
[48:22] from their worldly Works their worldly
[48:25] doings and their evil
[48:28] ways so they didn't continue on the way
[48:32] they used to be they actually did
[48:34] something different in their life and
[48:36] you know it's the exact same way for us
[48:38] today brothers and sisters it's no
[48:40] different for us
[48:41] today the Holy
[48:43] Ghost uh the Holy Ghost took charge of
[48:46] their lives they entered into rest there
[48:49] is your rest that is your Sabbath it's
[48:53] not a day nor a year but but the
[48:55] eternity of being filled and blessed in
[48:59] the holy
[49:00] spirit it's you ceasing and God doing
[49:04] it's God in you willing and doing of his
[49:08] own good
[49:10] pleasure and now when we read that
[49:12] brothers and sisters I I just want to
[49:14] maybe emphasize that that's that's
[49:16] speaking about us spiritually we're all
[49:19] aware of that I'm sure but I think
[49:20] sometimes it's real important to just
[49:22] make sure that we just talk about
[49:24] certain things along Ong the way um
[49:26] entering into a rest is not about just
[49:30] taking the day off and actually staying
[49:32] at home and putting our hands behind our
[49:35] head and our feet on the desk and just
[49:37] saying hey I've entered into my rest
[49:39] I've ceased from my doing and now God's
[49:41] going to do it for me that's not what
[49:44] he's saying at all what he's saying here
[49:47] is that we actually enter into a rest
[49:50] with the Holy Ghost and we spiritually
[49:52] stop trying to be religious we spirit
[49:55] spiritually stop trying to do anything
[49:58] spiritually speaking we humble ourselves
[50:00] in the sight of the Lord and then he
[50:02] lifts us
[50:03] up it is US ceasing and God doing and
[50:08] you know it does flow over into our
[50:11] natural lives it's so interesting
[50:14] because the Christian Life is dovetailed
[50:17] with the natural life and that's where
[50:19] it becomes so deceptive that's where the
[50:21] devil just loves to play Because He
[50:23] he'll get into our emotions he'll get
[50:24] into our work he'll get into our careers
[50:27] he'll get into our education and then
[50:29] try and and confuse us with the many
[50:31] different aspects the many different
[50:32] angles that we can look at it all but
[50:34] when we truly surrender ourselves to the
[50:36] Lord seek ye first the kingdom of God
[50:40] then all the rest of it will be added
[50:42] unto you when you truly surrender to the
[50:45] Lord Jesus Christ then you will enter
[50:48] into a rest and it won't matter what
[50:50] comes your way because you'll be able to
[50:51] just go forwards and do what you need to
[50:53] do to get it done
[50:56] it's you ceasing and God doing it's God
[50:59] in you willing and doing of his good
[51:03] pleasure and this you know it can get
[51:05] real good I'm probably not going to get
[51:07] too far into it tonight but you know ask
[51:10] what you will
[51:11] right we can speak the word that's the
[51:14] condition we live in but you know just
[51:16] saying it doesn't mean anything because
[51:18] the devil knows when we're bluffing the
[51:20] devil knows exactly who we are and
[51:22] exactly where we're at spiritually
[51:24] speaking and so does God and as long as
[51:27] we are not completely surrendered to the
[51:29] Lord spiritually if we have reservations
[51:32] if we're mucking in the world and doing
[51:34] different things that we know we
[51:35] shouldn't do then spiritually speaking
[51:37] we're going to be completely neutral we
[51:39] we'll have our transmission to neutral
[51:41] we can't go anywhere but boy oh boy when
[51:43] we get things right with the Lord and
[51:45] you know what sometimes brothers and
[51:47] sisters looking backwards does nothing
[51:49] all we need to do is look forwards alls
[51:52] we need to do is take that step towards
[51:53] him what can we do tonight what can we
[51:55] do tomorrow what can we do the next day
[51:57] that's what's going to make the
[51:58] difference that's the real Difference
[52:00] Maker in our lives but when we get to
[52:02] that place spiritually speaking it is
[52:04] truly us ceasing and God doing I think
[52:06] that's so beautiful it's God in you
[52:10] willing and doing of his good pleasure
[52:13] we won't speak anything contrary to the
[52:15] word and that's where I think it's
[52:17] beautiful when you talk about gifts if
[52:19] you think about gifts in the church
[52:20] sometimes people get uneasy about
[52:22] speaking in tongues and maybe screaming
[52:24] and shouting and getting into the spirit
[52:26] really getting into the spirit if we
[52:27] truly have the Holy Ghost we're never
[52:29] going to get out of order in
[52:30] church but it's when we don't have the
[52:32] Holy Ghost that we're going to be all
[52:34] worried that something's going to get
[52:35] out of
[52:36] order because we're not actually
[52:38] according to the word of God brother bam
[52:41] goes on to say in paragraph 19 let me
[52:43] make one more note about the
[52:45] sagittarians who claim that we meet on
[52:47] the wrong day of the week when we meet
[52:49] on Sunday the first day here's what
[52:52] Justin said in the 2 Century on Sunday a
[52:55] meeting was held of all who live in the
[52:57] cities and Villages and a section is
[52:59] read of the Memoirs of the Apostles and
[53:03] the writings as long as time permits
[53:06] when the reading is finished the
[53:07] president in a discourse gives an the
[53:10] admonition and exhortation to imitate
[53:13] those Noble things after this we all
[53:16] arise to offer common prayer at the
[53:18] close of the prayer as we have described
[53:21] Bread and Wine are placed before us and
[53:23] Thanksgiving made and the congregation
[53:26] answers amen then the elements are
[53:29] distributed to each one and are partaken
[53:31] of and carried by the deacons to the
[53:33] house of the absent the wealthy and
[53:36] willing then give contributions
[53:38] according to their Free Will and this
[53:40] collection is deposited with the
[53:42] president who therewith supplies orphans
[53:45] widows prisoners and strangers in want
[53:49] thus we see that those who claimed the
[53:51] early church carried on the judaic
[53:53] tradition of assembling on the last day
[53:55] of the week are grossly ignorant of what
[53:58] history actually sets forth and are
[54:00] therefore not worthy of
[54:03] confidence oh that the people might come
[54:06] unto him and find that rest there is a
[54:10] cry in the hearts for that rest but the
[54:12] majority doesn't know the answer so they
[54:16] try to steal the Cry by a religious
[54:20] process and I just I have that that
[54:22] highlighted right there still the cry by
[54:25] a religious process brothers and sisters
[54:27] don't let it be a religious process it
[54:30] can't be a religious process the only
[54:32] way it can work is to get the Holy Ghost
[54:35] and then it's truly us ceasing and him
[54:38] doing so they try to steal it by a
[54:41] religious process of keeping certain
[54:43] days or accepting denominational Creeds
[54:48] and
[54:48] dogmas so I just think this is beautiful
[54:51] I have looked over this many many times
[54:53] I've listened to it many many times and
[54:55] the next sentence brother Bram talks
[54:57] about how the worldly people do their
[54:59] things but first he talks about the
[55:01] Christians he talks about the religious
[55:03] ones because they try and steal it they
[55:07] steal the Cry by a religious process of
[55:09] keeping certain days or accepting
[55:11] denominational Creeds and dogmas it's
[55:14] got to come to the place where we stop
[55:16] doing and we allow him to do it amen
[55:19] well we're not looking at brothers and
[55:20] sisters we're not busy trying to get
[55:23] busy with other people's affairs what we
[55:25] are do is getting busy with the Lord so
[55:28] that when we come to service we're
[55:30] actually ready to see the Lord move
[55:33] because you know it's not the minister
[55:36] it's the people the gift is activated by
[55:38] the people when the people come hungry
[55:40] ready to hear from the Lord then the
[55:42] Lord is going to move amen he he could
[55:45] use a donkey to speak to man I just
[55:48] think it's beautiful as I've been
[55:49] studying this uh a little bit you know
[55:51] the same principle we've talked about it
[55:54] many many times about how the people
[55:56] activate the gift in the ministry the
[55:59] people actually activate all the gifts
[56:01] in the body just to be clear they out
[56:04] operate the gift of the song leader when
[56:07] we come to service if we're prayed up
[56:10] that's something we're going to talk
[56:11] about I didn't even talk about the
[56:12] announcements I do apologize we've got a
[56:14] communion coming up the end of the month
[56:15] which is next Sunday hard to believe and
[56:17] we have a prayer meeting tomorrow night
[56:19] but you know brothers and sisters when
[56:21] we come to service prayed up when we
[56:22] don't come to service to get prayed up
[56:24] when we come to service prayed up we're
[56:26] already in the spirit God's going to
[56:29] move amen we're going to actually enter
[56:32] into worship that's right because the
[56:34] worship that happens is dependent solely
[56:36] upon each and every individual in the
[56:38] building and if somebody comes into the
[56:40] building you know brother brandham talks
[56:42] about it we all know this brother Bram
[56:44] says that one person their misbehavior
[56:47] can actually take the healing from
[56:49] someone in a service so if we come in
[56:51] with the wrong attitude we might as well
[56:54] stay home
[56:55] what's the point in coming if we're just
[56:57] going to get in the way now there's a
[56:59] balance to that because you got to come
[57:00] to church to get Washed by the Water of
[57:02] the word so I trust that everyone that's
[57:04] here tonight has come with a purpose to
[57:07] hear from
[57:10] God we don't want it to be Creeds and
[57:13] dogmas we don't want it to be us doing
[57:17] trying to make something happening we
[57:19] don't want to steal the cry that was
[57:20] placed in our souls by a religious
[57:22] process of keeping certain are accepting
[57:25] denominational Creeds and dogmas by
[57:28] hanging on to Traditions by saying that
[57:30] this is the way that we've always done
[57:31] it in our lives and it can't be any
[57:33] different remember the children of
[57:35] Israel in in Exodus when they crossed
[57:37] over Jordan what they were told was
[57:39] nobody's ever gone this way before so
[57:40] you better listen to the word of the
[57:42] prophet and you better follow the
[57:43] Levites instructions exactly to the
[57:45] letter because no one has ever gone this
[57:47] way and brothers and sisters no one's
[57:49] ever gone this far in the message of the
[57:50] hour no one has ever gone as far as we
[57:53] have you talked to some of the the
[57:54] old-timers and they'll say you know they
[57:56] didn't expect to see their children grow
[57:58] before the Rapture would come and here
[58:00] we are now their children's children are
[58:03] having
[58:05] children and we're still waiting for the
[58:07] coming of the Lord we're looking for
[58:08] this Rapture to take place we need to
[58:10] make sure that we know where we
[58:13] stand amen don't try and steal the Cry
[58:15] by a religious process by the way we've
[58:17] always done it we need to actually get
[58:19] in the spirit and then we'll see things
[58:21] done that's what brother Bram said don't
[58:23] try and steal the the the The Cry by a
[58:25] religious process of keeping certain
[58:27] days or accepting denominational Creeds
[58:29] and dogmas I keep reading that on
[58:31] purpose brothers and sisters because I
[58:33] want it to saturate I want it to soak in
[58:35] I want us to think about the things that
[58:36] we do in our lives are they according to
[58:38] the leadership of the Holy Ghost is it
[58:40] being in the spirit is that the reason
[58:43] we do these things or is it just because
[58:44] we've always done it this way or that we
[58:46] think we should do it another way is is
[58:49] that what we're doing it's a religious
[58:51] process and we know that God's not
[58:52] pleased by it but then we go further
[58:54] with this here and brother bradam says
[58:55] but failing that many try drinking
[58:58] carousing every physical excess thinking
[59:02] that by worldly pleasures there can be
[59:04] some satisfaction but in such there is
[59:07] no rest they smoke and take pills to
[59:10] quiet their nerves but there is no rest
[59:12] in Earthly
[59:13] potions they need
[59:15] Jesus they need the Heavenly
[59:18] remedy the rest of the
[59:22] spirit I think it's just so beautiful
[59:25] it's
[59:27] true then the most of them go to church
[59:29] on
[59:30] Sunday that's good but even there they
[59:34] have no idea of how to approach God and
[59:36] how to worship
[59:37] Him Jesus said that true worship was in
[59:41] spirit and in truth John
[59:43] 4:24 and and we know we we talked about
[59:46] that a little while ago and we certainly
[59:48] will in the future I think it's such a
[59:49] beautiful thing
[59:52] but we worship Him in spirit in truth
[59:55] and when we have the message of the hour
[59:56] brothers and sisters we definitely have
[59:58] the truth so if we can get ourselves
[1:00:01] into the spirit we have spirit and truth
[1:00:04] and boy when those two things come
[1:00:07] together then we're worshiping God the
[1:00:09] way he wants to be worshiped paragraph
[1:00:12] 23 what kind of worship can you get in a
[1:00:15] church that knows so little of God it
[1:00:17] puts a Santa Claus at Christmas and
[1:00:19] bunnies at Easter where did they get
[1:00:22] that they got it from the pagans and
[1:00:24] made a part of the church doctrine
[1:00:27] right I have this totally highlighted
[1:00:29] this next sentence here but when one
[1:00:31] turns to the Lord and is filled with the
[1:00:35] Holy Ghost he ceases from all such
[1:00:38] things he has rest in his soul he really
[1:00:43] begins to live and love God and worship
[1:00:47] him just makes does me so good to hear
[1:00:50] Brother Bram talk like this you know I I
[1:00:52] know some people have been upset in the
[1:00:54] past about talking about the Holy Ghost
[1:00:55] all the time but that's the only thing
[1:00:57] we've got really brothers and sisters we
[1:00:59] can have a bunch of of dos and don'ts
[1:01:01] and and become a bunch of stuffed shirts
[1:01:03] and you know not see the power of God
[1:01:06] move in our midst or we can get the Holy
[1:01:08] Ghost and see the power of God we can
[1:01:10] see the Lord move not just in our church
[1:01:12] services but in our very lives when we
[1:01:15] come up against the the the sea and
[1:01:18] we've got a mountain up against our back
[1:01:19] and Pharaoh is thundering towards us we
[1:01:22] can speak the word we can call on the
[1:01:24] name of the Living God Jehovah and know
[1:01:27] that he will be there for us Amen
[1:01:30] brother Bram says now let's get back to
[1:01:32] our scripture we know what the Lord's
[1:01:34] day is not if it's not Saturday or
[1:01:37] Sunday what is it well let's put it this
[1:01:39] way today is certainly not the Lord's
[1:01:41] day this is man's day it's man's doing
[1:01:45] man's work man's Church man's idea of
[1:01:49] worship but man's everything for it is
[1:01:52] man's world Cosmos but the day of the
[1:01:55] Lord is
[1:01:57] coming it's
[1:01:59] just it is just that at this time of the
[1:02:03] revelation of Jesus Christ John was
[1:02:06] taken up by the spirit and transported
[1:02:10] by the spirit to that great day that is
[1:02:12] coming I I just want to say brothers and
[1:02:15] sisters we need to remember and not take
[1:02:18] it for granted the revelation of Jesus
[1:02:20] Christ when we can recognize it we'll
[1:02:22] get into a little bit later John recog
[1:02:24] IED The Voice he he he turned to see the
[1:02:28] voice but he actually recognized that
[1:02:30] voice because that voice wasn't someone
[1:02:32] different Jesus Christ the same
[1:02:34] yesterday today forever this was the man
[1:02:36] that he walked with in Galilee this was
[1:02:38] the voice of that Nazarene that he knew
[1:02:41] it was a familiar voice and if we've
[1:02:43] ever heard that voice once in our life
[1:02:46] it is a familiar voice we'll never ever
[1:02:49] mistake that voice in our lives but it's
[1:02:52] just at this time of the revelation of
[1:02:55] Jesus Christ John was taken up by the
[1:02:58] spirit and transported by the spirit to
[1:03:00] that great day that is coming the Lord's
[1:03:02] Day is when the days of man are over and
[1:03:06] you know brothers and sisters we haven't
[1:03:07] gone and been transported in into the
[1:03:10] into the Lord's day that great day that
[1:03:13] is coming yet but sometimes we can get
[1:03:16] ourselves so Heavenly minded that we
[1:03:18] think we're there well we're not and we
[1:03:21] still have responsibility here we have
[1:03:24] to be able to be recognizing exactly
[1:03:27] where we stand that day is coming
[1:03:29] brother brandham says it that great day
[1:03:30] is coming the Lord's Day is when the
[1:03:33] days of man are over and the days of man
[1:03:36] are not over yet the kingdoms of this
[1:03:39] world will then become the kingdoms of
[1:03:41] our God the day of the Lord is when the
[1:03:43] judgments fall and after that comes the
[1:03:46] Millennium right now the world does what
[1:03:49] it wants to with the Christian they call
[1:03:52] him all manner of evil names make fun of
[1:03:55] him but there is coming that great and
[1:03:57] notable day when they will wail and howl
[1:04:01] for the lamb is coming in Wrath to judge
[1:04:04] the world that's when the righteous will
[1:04:07] have their day with the Lord for the
[1:04:09] wicked shall burn and the righteous will
[1:04:11] walk over their ashes into the
[1:04:14] Millennium I I I I've said it before but
[1:04:17] I'll just throw this visual out there if
[1:04:18] you've ever been to a volcano and seen
[1:04:21] what happens after a volcano erupts if
[1:04:24] you walk out on that lava that's all
[1:04:26] ashes brothers and sisters and anything
[1:04:28] in its way in this world gets
[1:04:30] incinerated Nothing Stops lava man does
[1:04:33] not have the ability to stop it when
[1:04:35] when the earth decides to actually push
[1:04:37] out that magma and turn it into lava
[1:04:40] nothing can stop it and anything in its
[1:04:42] way is incinerate but once it's dry once
[1:04:44] it's cool you can walk out on it and
[1:04:47] it's the most interesting thing because
[1:04:48] after a little while you'll see little
[1:04:50] tiny seeds growing you'll see little
[1:04:52] tiny Sprouts all over The Lava and and
[1:04:56] you know it it's wonderful because one
[1:04:58] time we will walk out on that on that
[1:05:01] lava I can't help but think it's just a
[1:05:03] visual for me and and one day we're
[1:05:06] going to walk out on the ashes of all of
[1:05:08] the people that made fun of the
[1:05:10] Believers and you know it's such a
[1:05:13] terrible thing because we know many
[1:05:15] people who are unbelievers who actually
[1:05:17] are good people but yet they'll mock
[1:05:20] Christianity you ever know anyone like
[1:05:23] that yeah good people but yet they do
[1:05:26] they mock Christianity it's not a
[1:05:28] healthy thing it's not a good thing and
[1:05:30] you know they're they're going to wind
[1:05:31] up in a situation where they're not
[1:05:33] going to have fun it's going to be a a
[1:05:35] terrible day but for some reason God
[1:05:38] chose us and this is where I think it's
[1:05:41] real important well we can recognize
[1:05:43] this that that there's coming a time
[1:05:45] where they're going to howl but we're
[1:05:47] going to be with him in his throne we
[1:05:49] don't have to endure that and that's
[1:05:52] where you know brother bradam he says it
[1:05:53] just this is long along in line right in
[1:05:56] line with being able to say that you can
[1:05:58] accept the word for your day is the
[1:05:59] evidence of the Holy Ghost sighing and
[1:06:01] crying for the Abominations in the land
[1:06:04] that these people are never going to be
[1:06:05] able to actually hear this word this
[1:06:08] voice that we can hear that we can
[1:06:11] recognize
[1:06:13] my Malachi 4:3 and you shall tread down
[1:06:17] the wicked for they shall be ashes Under
[1:06:19] The Souls of your feet in that day that
[1:06:21] I shall do this sayith the Lord of hosts
[1:06:24] and we know brother bradam he said he
[1:06:25] went and he actually saw that regions of
[1:06:28] the lost and he saidou wouldn't wish
[1:06:29] that on your worst enemy you wouldn't
[1:06:31] wish that as a human being on your worst
[1:06:33] enemy you would want to see even your
[1:06:35] worst enemy be saved and we know that
[1:06:38] that's truly the the life of a Christian
[1:06:40] because Christ would that everyone would
[1:06:42] be saved but we know that not everyone
[1:06:45] has the ability to be and we know it's
[1:06:48] election voice like a
[1:06:50] trumpet John said in Revelations 1:10
[1:06:54] and I and heard behind me a great voice
[1:06:58] as of a
[1:06:59] trumpet John was in the spirit and when
[1:07:02] he was he saw a great and wonderful day
[1:07:05] of the Lord Jesus and All His holy power
[1:07:09] the future was about to unfold for God
[1:07:11] was about to teach him John did not say
[1:07:14] it was a trumpet it was like a
[1:07:17] trumpet now when a trumpet is blown it
[1:07:20] has an urgency about it it is like the
[1:07:23] hair
[1:07:24] the king's messenger coming to the
[1:07:26] people he blows on a trumpet it's an
[1:07:29] urgent call the people gathered to
[1:07:31] listen Israel was always assembled by
[1:07:34] the sounding of a trumpet amen something
[1:07:37] important is at hand listen to it so
[1:07:40] this voice had the same urgency of
[1:07:43] appeal as did the trumpet clear and
[1:07:46] strong it was startling and
[1:07:50] Awakening oh that we might hear the
[1:07:52] voice of God as a trumpet in this day
[1:07:55] for it is the gospel trumpet sounding
[1:07:58] forth the word of Prophecy to make us
[1:08:01] aware of and prepared for what is coming
[1:08:04] upon the Earth
[1:08:07] amen the command to write Revelations
[1:08:12] 1:1 saying I am Alpha and Omega the
[1:08:15] first and the last and what thou seest
[1:08:18] write in a book and send it unto the
[1:08:21] seven churches which are in Asia unto
[1:08:24] Ephesus and unto smirna and unto
[1:08:27] pergamus and unto thyra and unto Sardis
[1:08:31] and unto
[1:08:32] Philadelphia and unto
[1:08:35] leoa the Bram he says in 28 here here it
[1:08:39] is the is here it is the first and the
[1:08:42] last Alpha and Omega that's all of it
[1:08:47] the one true God the voice and word of
[1:08:51] God this is where I think it gets it's
[1:08:53] real good for us as Believers and I say
[1:08:56] you know Lord help me I always wanted to
[1:08:59] be that way first Lord help me we have
[1:09:03] the word of God I think it was uh
[1:09:06] brother ciz that said it we have the
[1:09:09] voice of God we've got the written word
[1:09:13] we've got the voice of God but we also
[1:09:16] have the word of God in our
[1:09:18] heart and the word of God has got to be
[1:09:21] in our hearts brothers and sisters amen
[1:09:23] and the word of God that's in our heart
[1:09:25] will always lead us into truth he will
[1:09:29] always lead us correctly we will never
[1:09:31] be leted astray and if we have any
[1:09:34] question about that leadership that's in
[1:09:35] our heart all we have to do is take it
[1:09:38] back to the word see if it lines up with
[1:09:40] that word and you know what happens
[1:09:42] though brothers and sisters is we can
[1:09:44] become a little bit callous in our
[1:09:47] hearts and I remember a brother talking
[1:09:49] about it years ago he said sometimes in
[1:09:51] our lives we'll have the experience with
[1:09:53] with God we'll be so on fire with God
[1:09:56] and and you know what will happen is
[1:09:57] there will be a red flag there and that
[1:09:59] will be the limit to where we can go
[1:10:01] according to the leadership of the Lord
[1:10:03] but something will entice us to just
[1:10:05] take that step over that flag it won't
[1:10:08] matter it won't really be a big deal
[1:10:10] we'll still be able to get by with our
[1:10:12] lives and everything that's going on our
[1:10:14] jobs will be fine everything will be
[1:10:16] fine if we just step over that flag and
[1:10:18] what happens is if we step over that
[1:10:20] flag then there's going to be another
[1:10:22] flag and hey we've already stepped over
[1:10:24] one flag what's the difference we can
[1:10:25] step over another flag and you know what
[1:10:27] all the while that voice that's inside
[1:10:29] of our hearts is saying hey stop stop
[1:10:32] don't go any further don't do it but you
[1:10:35] know what every time we do it it becomes
[1:10:37] easier and easier why is that because
[1:10:39] that voice that's inside of us which is
[1:10:41] the same as the word of God which is the
[1:10:42] same as the voice of God that leadership
[1:10:44] of the Holy Ghost becomes quieter and
[1:10:47] quieter and quieter and quieter and you
[1:10:50] ask anyone that's ever stepped away from
[1:10:52] the word of God that's ever stepped away
[1:10:54] from this life a Christian walk that
[1:10:56] voice can sometimes be completely
[1:10:58] stilled and you don't hear it
[1:11:01] anymore sometimes God needs to shake us
[1:11:03] up to get us to actually hear that voice
[1:11:05] again but we have the ability to hear
[1:11:08] that voice we don't need to actually
[1:11:10] steal that voice we need to remember
[1:11:12] that that voice is given to us for a
[1:11:14] reason so that he can actually lead us
[1:11:16] and guide us but brothers and sisters he
[1:11:19] the spirit of truth will never lead us
[1:11:20] and guide us outside of his word that's
[1:11:23] why we never have to be worried about
[1:11:24] getting out of hand or getting out of
[1:11:26] control in a service because if it's the
[1:11:28] Holy Ghost In Our Lives we're always
[1:11:29] going to be in order with the
[1:11:39] word here it is the first and the last
[1:11:41] the alpha the Omega the all of it the
[1:11:43] one true God the voice and the word of
[1:11:47] God reality and Truth is at hand what a
[1:11:51] thing it is to be in the spirit
[1:11:54] my to be in the presence of God and to
[1:11:57] hear from him isn't it wonderful to read
[1:12:01] this we can look at it and say you know
[1:12:03] John was in the spirit in the Lord's Day
[1:12:04] in the aisle of Patmos as our brother in
[1:12:06] Tribulation and you know the the whole
[1:12:09] book of Revelation the book of symbols
[1:12:11] it's a tremendous thing but you know
[1:12:12] what this isn't written so that we can
[1:12:14] look back and say what a wonderful thing
[1:12:16] it was for John to be there and how
[1:12:17] blessed we are to have all the
[1:12:19] revelations and to have all the seals
[1:12:21] and the Mysteries and everything figured
[1:12:22] out what what this is all about brothers
[1:12:24] and sisters is reality and Truth is at
[1:12:27] hand reality and Truth is right here now
[1:12:29] tonight in this building what a thing it
[1:12:31] is to be in the spirit right here
[1:12:33] tonight in this building this is what
[1:12:35] we're talking about this is why this is
[1:12:37] such an important book to be reading
[1:12:38] here what a thing it is to be in the
[1:12:41] spirit my to be in the presence of God
[1:12:44] and to hear from
[1:12:46] him brothers and sisters if we haven't
[1:12:48] been in the presence of God and had the
[1:12:50] ability to hear from him I want to make
[1:12:52] a request get get in the spirit get in
[1:12:54] the presence of God give him the ability
[1:12:57] to to speak to you so you can hear from
[1:12:59] him we know that that the instruction
[1:13:01] for John was what thou seest WR in a
[1:13:03] book and send it unto the seven churches
[1:13:05] the voice that sounded forth his word in
[1:13:08] the Garden of Eden and upon Mount Si
[1:13:11] which voice was also heard in the
[1:13:13] excellent glory of the mount
[1:13:15] Transfiguration was once again sounding
[1:13:17] forth and this time to the seven
[1:13:20] churches with a complete and final
[1:13:22] revelation of Jesus Christ and I know as
[1:13:24] Believers of this message of the hour we
[1:13:26] could say that voice is sounding forth
[1:13:28] again in this age and it's not just
[1:13:31] through any one Minister it's through
[1:13:33] the hearts of the children of God by the
[1:13:36] very voice of God leading his
[1:13:39] children 29 write the Visions John make
[1:13:42] a record of them for the Ages which are
[1:13:44] to follow for they are the true
[1:13:46] prophecies which must come to pass write
[1:13:50] them and send them out make make making
[1:13:54] them
[1:13:55] known and this is where I mentioned
[1:13:57] earlier John he recognized that voice
[1:13:59] didn't he he recognize this friend oh
[1:14:04] you will recognize that voice when he
[1:14:06] calls you if you are one of his
[1:14:09] own just so beautiful isn't it you will
[1:14:13] recognize that voice and if you don't
[1:14:14] recognize the voice just give it some
[1:14:16] time just wait upon the Lord and see if
[1:14:18] he won't renew your strength see if he
[1:14:20] won't actually make you mount up with
[1:14:23] wings like an eagle he he will totally
[1:14:26] make himself known the golden lampstands
[1:14:30] and I turned to see the voice that spake
[1:14:32] with me and being
[1:14:33] turned I saw seven golden candlesticks
[1:14:37] Revelations
[1:14:38] 1:12 John does not say he turned to see
[1:14:42] the one whose voice he heard but he
[1:14:45] turned to see the
[1:14:46] voice oh I like that he turned to see
[1:14:50] The
[1:14:51] Voice how many many people have turned
[1:14:54] to see The Voice here
[1:14:56] tonight the voice and the person are one
[1:15:00] and the
[1:15:01] same Jesus is the word amen John 1 1-3
[1:15:07] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:15:08] was with God and the Word was God the
[1:15:11] same was in the beginning with God all
[1:15:14] things were made by him and without him
[1:15:17] was not anything made that was
[1:15:20] made if you can ever get to really see
[1:15:24] the word you will be seeing
[1:15:28] Jesus and we know brother bradam says it
[1:15:30] that if you can't see Jesus in every
[1:15:32] single scripture from Genesis to
[1:15:34] Revelation go back and read it again see
[1:15:37] if God won't make that real to you
[1:15:39] you've got to be able to do that and
[1:15:41] then once you do I'll go further with it
[1:15:44] I think brother bradam even says it when
[1:15:45] you do you're going to be able to go
[1:15:47] through and read this scripture and
[1:15:48] you're going to start to see your name
[1:15:49] in there we're going to see our name in
[1:15:52] every single scripture it becomes about
[1:15:54] us the whole book being a love letter to
[1:15:57] us we don't want to get digressed here
[1:16:00] brother Bram he goes on to say when John
[1:16:02] turned he saw seven golden candlesticks
[1:16:05] actually they were lampstands and
[1:16:07] according to verse 20 they are the seven
[1:16:10] churches the seven candlesticks that
[1:16:12] thou sawest are the seven churches to
[1:16:16] represent the churches they could hardly
[1:16:19] be candles a candle burns but a while
[1:16:22] and then is burnt out
[1:16:23] it dies there would be no more to it but
[1:16:28] lampstands possess a lasting quality not
[1:16:31] found in candles if you want to get a
[1:16:33] beautiful picture of the lamp read about
[1:16:35] it we know this is Zechariah
[1:16:38] 41-6 it's beautiful how he describes
[1:16:41] this we know this is the leadership of
[1:16:42] the Lord explaining that there's only
[1:16:44] one source of the life there's only one
[1:16:47] source for that flame and it's truly
[1:16:49] that pure olive oil that's in that one
[1:16:51] lampstand feeding every single one of
[1:16:53] the church
[1:16:55] ages the scripture says in Zechariah 4
[1:16:59] verse1 and the angel that talked with me
[1:17:02] came again and wake me as a man that is
[1:17:05] waken out of his sleep and said unto me
[1:17:08] what seest thou and I said I have looked
[1:17:11] and behold a Candlestick all of gold and
[1:17:14] a bowl upon the top of it and it's seven
[1:17:17] lamps thereon and seven pipes to the
[1:17:19] seven lamps which are upon the top
[1:17:22] thereof
[1:17:23] and two olive trees by it one upon the
[1:17:27] right side of the bowl and the other
[1:17:29] upon the left side thereof so I answered
[1:17:32] and spake to the angel that talked with
[1:17:34] me saying what are these my Lord then
[1:17:38] the angel that talked with me answered
[1:17:40] and said unto me knowest thou not what
[1:17:42] these be I said no my
[1:17:45] Lord then he answered and spake unto me
[1:17:48] saying this is the word of the Lord unto
[1:17:52] zerubabel
[1:17:53] saying not by might nor by power but by
[1:17:58] my spirit saith the Lord of hosts am
[1:18:01] Zechariah
[1:18:02] 41-6 and you know the story of zerubabel
[1:18:06] we we won't go too far into it because I
[1:18:08] think there's a whole bunch in there
[1:18:09] that we will get into eventually but
[1:18:11] zerubabel was a son in the lineage
[1:18:13] lineage of David zerubabel he actually
[1:18:17] was one that came back to rebuild the
[1:18:20] Temple he came back out of cap ity and
[1:18:23] was conscripted to build this Temple and
[1:18:25] we know that the Lord used him as a
[1:18:27] prophet to actually do this to
[1:18:29] accomplish it but we won't go too far
[1:18:31] with it but basically it's not by might
[1:18:34] nor by power but by my spirit sayith the
[1:18:36] Lord of hosts and I want to say that
[1:18:37] tonight brothers and sisters as
[1:18:38] Christians as Believers of this message
[1:18:40] of the hour it's not by might it's not
[1:18:42] by works of righteousness but by his
[1:18:44] grace alone that's what it is it's it's
[1:18:46] his grace it's him doing it all from the
[1:18:48] beginning and and the end it's not by
[1:18:51] might nor by power it's not by the the
[1:18:52] amount of time we've been in the message
[1:18:54] it's not by our strength it's not by our
[1:18:56] goodness it's not by how much we give
[1:18:58] it's not by whatever we think or how we
[1:19:01] look it's all by his Spirit that's the
[1:19:04] only way that he builds his Temple is by
[1:19:07] his spirit and if we're willing to
[1:19:09] Humble ourselves unto him we'll see him
[1:19:11] do it and and you know that Temple we're
[1:19:14] talking about is the Temple of the Holy
[1:19:16] Ghost which is our lives it's not a
[1:19:18] building and it's not an assembly of
[1:19:20] people it's truly the leadership of the
[1:19:22] Lord in our lives paragraph 32 here is
[1:19:26] another lamp of pure gold It Is Burning
[1:19:29] Brightly because it has plenty of oil
[1:19:31] which it's getting from the two olive
[1:19:33] trees which stand on either side the two
[1:19:37] trees represent the old and the New
[1:19:39] Testament and of course the oil typifies
[1:19:43] the Holy Ghost who alone can give the
[1:19:47] light of God to the
[1:19:48] people the angel who spoke to Zachariah
[1:19:52] was as as much as saying this what you
[1:19:55] see means that the church cannot
[1:19:58] accomplish anything by its own might or
[1:20:01] power but by the Holy Ghost amen
[1:20:05] hallelujah many times we think we can do
[1:20:07] a lot many times we get ideas and plans
[1:20:11] and schemes brothers and sisters we have
[1:20:13] to give it all to the Lord and if we're
[1:20:15] willing to Humble ourselves and take
[1:20:18] whatever it is we think and bring it to
[1:20:19] the Lord and see what he thinks about it
[1:20:22] he'll give us answer he'll lead
[1:20:24] us I think you know like we heard
[1:20:27] tonight this assembly started out with a
[1:20:29] couple of families and look at look at
[1:20:31] it today it's all the
[1:20:33] Lord there's people that step into
[1:20:35] positions and offices but it's all the
[1:20:37] lord it's all the
[1:20:40] Lord paragraph 33 now examine this
[1:20:43] lampstand you will notice that he it has
[1:20:45] a large bowl or Reservoir that is
[1:20:48] Central to seven arms that come out of
[1:20:50] it this bowl is filled with olive oil
[1:20:52] which which flows through seven Wicks
[1:20:54] which are placed in the seven arms it is
[1:20:57] the same oil that burns and makes a
[1:21:00] light at the end of the seven pipes this
[1:21:03] light never went out the priest just
[1:21:06] kept pouring oil into the bowl and I
[1:21:09] just can't help but think brothers and
[1:21:10] sisters how we need to just keep pouring
[1:21:12] oil into the bowl just just lifting up
[1:21:15] our cups and saying Lord here is my cup
[1:21:17] I lift it up just just fill it up
[1:21:21] Lord the L was lit in a special way
[1:21:24] first the priest took the fire from the
[1:21:26] sacred altar which was originally
[1:21:28] lighted by the fire of God he lit first
[1:21:31] of all the lamp that was sitting on top
[1:21:34] of the bowl he then lit the second
[1:21:38] lamp from the flame of the first lamp
[1:21:41] the third lamp received its fire from
[1:21:43] the second lamp as did the fourth
[1:21:46] receive it from the third and so on
[1:21:48] until all the seven lamps were burning
[1:21:51] this Holy Fire from the altar being
[1:21:53] passed from lamp to lamp is a wonderful
[1:21:56] type of the holy spirit in the seven
[1:21:58] Church ages how every single age lights
[1:22:03] the next
[1:22:04] age every age lights the next one it's
[1:22:07] not one just lighting every single age
[1:22:10] individually each age passes it on and
[1:22:13] lights the the next one so beautiful the
[1:22:16] original outpouring of Pentecost which
[1:22:18] outpouring came direct from Jesus on the
[1:22:20] mercy seat is in enduring his church
[1:22:24] through all the Seven Ages and showing
[1:22:27] forth perfectly that Jesus Christ is the
[1:22:30] same yesterday today and forever the
[1:22:33] never changing God in his Essence and
[1:22:36] his ways in John 15 Jesus said I am the
[1:22:41] vine ye are the branches amen he is the
[1:22:44] main Vine that which comes out of the
[1:22:47] original
[1:22:48] root from the original seed that has the
[1:22:52] original life in
[1:22:54] it now the vine does not bear
[1:22:57] fruit it's the branches that do
[1:23:01] that the vine does not bear fruit it's
[1:23:05] the branches that do that you know it's
[1:23:08] a little bit like we talked about on
[1:23:09] Sunday you know he he's he's the
[1:23:11] inspector he's going to come by and look
[1:23:13] at the box car and shake it but he's not
[1:23:16] going to pack it and unpack it that's up
[1:23:19] to us to
[1:23:20] do he's the one that puts the seal upon
[1:23:23] it it's up to us to make sure that we're
[1:23:26] bearing fruit not him the only thing
[1:23:29] that he does is purges the
[1:23:31] branch paragraph 37 now watch this you
[1:23:34] can take a citrus tree such as an orange
[1:23:36] tree and graft it into a grapefruit limb
[1:23:39] a lemon limb a tangelo Limb and other
[1:23:43] kinds of that variety and all those
[1:23:45] limbs will
[1:23:47] grow excuse me but those grafted limbs
[1:23:51] will not bear oranges no sir the lemon
[1:23:55] limb will bear lemons and the grapefruit
[1:23:58] limb will bear grapefruit and so
[1:24:01] on yet those limbs will be thriving off
[1:24:04] the life in the
[1:24:06] tree I just want to pause there for a
[1:24:08] second and just really drill into this
[1:24:10] for a little bit brothers and sisters we
[1:24:11] need to make sure that our Creeds and
[1:24:13] our dogmas and our traditions and our
[1:24:15] constitutions all about the message of
[1:24:17] the hour line up with the message of the
[1:24:19] hour and not someone's teaching
[1:24:21] somewhere along the way because if it is
[1:24:23] someone's teaching somewhere along the
[1:24:25] way just remember whatever that teaching
[1:24:27] is is a grafted Branch into the True
[1:24:31] Vine and what will happen is that
[1:24:32] grafted Branch will bear
[1:24:35] fruit our Traditions our teachings our
[1:24:38] dogmas our Creeds all of our past
[1:24:40] behaviors they'll bear
[1:24:42] fruit and God will bless us because
[1:24:45] we'll be living off the
[1:24:46] vine but you know what if that Branch
[1:24:49] ever puts forth if that tree ever puts
[1:24:51] forth another another Branch that's a
[1:24:53] different story isn't
[1:24:56] it but those grafted limbs will not bear
[1:25:01] oranges I'll go back a little bit I'll
[1:25:03] just read from 37 now now watch this you
[1:25:05] can take a citrus tree such as an orange
[1:25:07] tree and grafted into a grapefruit limb
[1:25:11] a lemon limb a tangelo Limb and other
[1:25:14] kinds of that variety and all those
[1:25:16] limbs will grow but those grafted limbs
[1:25:19] will not bear oranges no sir the Lem
[1:25:22] limb will bear lemons and the grapefruit
[1:25:25] limb will bear grapefruit and so on yet
[1:25:28] those limbs will be thriving off the
[1:25:30] life in the tree but if that tree ever
[1:25:34] puts forth another branch of itself it
[1:25:37] will be an orange branch and it will
[1:25:40] bear
[1:25:41] oranges why because the life in the limb
[1:25:45] and the life in the trunk are
[1:25:49] identical they're not different so
[1:25:52] saying that we believe the message of
[1:25:54] the hour but living a little bit of a
[1:25:55] different life outside of church
[1:25:57] brothers and sisters it's a grafted
[1:26:00] Affair it's not the original branch and
[1:26:04] I want to say it tonight we got to be
[1:26:06] clear don't be
[1:26:07] deceived we do not want to be deceived
[1:26:09] and think because we got fruit on our
[1:26:11] Branch it's the right fruit it has to
[1:26:13] match the trunk it has to match the
[1:26:16] trunk if it doesn't match the trunk it's
[1:26:18] the wrong
[1:26:19] fruit and the devil just loves it
[1:26:22] when we have fruit doesn't he but does
[1:26:25] it match the original is it an orange
[1:26:28] because we need to be bearing oranges
[1:26:30] not lemons not tangelos not
[1:26:33] tangerines not limes none of the other
[1:26:36] fruits will count it has to be exactly
[1:26:38] according to the trunk of the tree the
[1:26:41] life in the limb and the life in the
[1:26:43] trunk are identical the life of the
[1:26:45] believer in church and the life of the
[1:26:47] believer out of church are
[1:26:49] identical whereas it wasn't so with with
[1:26:52] the grafted limbs those grafted branches
[1:26:55] had their sources in other kinds of life
[1:26:57] from other kinds of trees from other
[1:26:59] roots from other seats why do you think
[1:27:01] brother Bram is talking about this why
[1:27:03] does he even have these words in here
[1:27:05] why is God allowing the prophet to put
[1:27:07] these words in here because he's talking
[1:27:09] about the life of human beings and the
[1:27:12] teachings and and and Creeds and dogmas
[1:27:14] that people pick up and and bring with
[1:27:16] them and jump into a church somewhere
[1:27:18] and they live off the life in that
[1:27:20] church but what's happening is if if
[1:27:23] they're not bearing forth the right
[1:27:24] fruit brothers and sisters just because
[1:27:26] they've got fruit on their Branch it
[1:27:27] doesn't mean it's the right one right I
[1:27:31] think it's so amazing because this is
[1:27:32] bringing correction to us right it is it
[1:27:35] shows us that just be just because I had
[1:27:38] a Pentecostal upbringing brothers and
[1:27:39] sisters I'll put it on me tonight it
[1:27:41] doesn't mean that it's going to be right
[1:27:42] to just be Pentecostal and have a
[1:27:44] speaking in tongues every time and and
[1:27:46] and interpretations just because I had
[1:27:48] that when I was young I don't want to
[1:27:50] graft in my life I want want to take it
[1:27:52] and say Lord let my life be identical to
[1:27:55] the trunk let your life live out through
[1:27:57] me and if it is another Branch let the
[1:28:00] life come through me and Purge it in
[1:28:01] such a way that it will actually bring
[1:28:03] forth the right fruit change this Branch
[1:28:06] Purge it Lord let it be according to
[1:28:08] your
[1:28:09] will those grafted branches had their
[1:28:12] sources and other kinds of life from
[1:28:13] other trees from other roots from other
[1:28:16] seeds oh they will bear fruit all right
[1:28:20] but they won't bear oranges they cannot
[1:28:23] because they are not the
[1:28:25] original that's the way the church is
[1:28:27] the vine has been split and limbs have
[1:28:31] been grafted in they have grafted in
[1:28:35] Baptist limbs Methodist limbs
[1:28:38] Presbyterian limbs Pentecostal Limbs and
[1:28:41] I'm just going to say whatever limbs
[1:28:43] that you can think of have been grafted
[1:28:45] in around the message some people have
[1:28:47] legalistic limbs some people have
[1:28:50] liberal limbs you you whatever the limbs
[1:28:53] are graft them in and they'll live and
[1:28:56] they'll bear fruit but what's the fruit
[1:29:00] is it the fruit of the spirit because if
[1:29:02] it's not the fruit of the spirit that's
[1:29:03] what we really want to talk about
[1:29:04] tonight we could say you got to have
[1:29:05] oranges we can run to the store and buy
[1:29:07] a bag of oranges but go buy a bag of the
[1:29:10] fruit of the spirit see if you can do
[1:29:12] that you can't it's got to be his life
[1:29:14] living out through us and when it is his
[1:29:16] life living out to us it will bear
[1:29:18] record of the word because it's
[1:29:21] identical to the the trunk that's the
[1:29:23] way the church is the vine has been
[1:29:24] split the limbs have been grafted in
[1:29:26] they have grafted in Baptist Methodist
[1:29:29] Presbyterian Pentecostal and those limbs
[1:29:31] are bearing Baptist Methodist
[1:29:33] Pentecostal Presbyterian fruit
[1:29:36] denominational seeds from which they
[1:29:38] produce their fruit but if that vine
[1:29:42] ever brings forth another branch of
[1:29:45] itself that Branch will be exactly like
[1:29:48] the vine itself I think it's so
[1:29:50] beautiful to see that brother brothers
[1:29:52] and sisters because this is not talking
[1:29:54] about trees it's not talking about fruit
[1:29:56] that hangs on the tree it's talking
[1:29:57] about the Christian Life it's talking
[1:29:59] about the life of a Believer are our
[1:30:01] lives lining up with the word of God are
[1:30:03] we producing are we seeing him produce
[1:30:06] the fruit of the spirit in our life
[1:30:08] remember brother Ken preached that so
[1:30:10] good it's not fruits it's not plural
[1:30:13] it's one fruit and there's different
[1:30:15] aspects of that one fruit but we have to
[1:30:17] have all of it in our lives amen we've
[1:30:20] got to see that fruit of the spirit in
[1:30:22] our lives and you know if we don't I'm
[1:30:25] not here to scold you I'm here to
[1:30:27] encourage you get that fruit right ask
[1:30:30] him to purge the branch that he would
[1:30:32] bring forth that
[1:30:34] fruit
[1:30:36] my but if that vine ever brings forth
[1:30:38] another branch of itself that Branch
[1:30:39] will be exactly like the vine itself
[1:30:42] amen it will be the same kind of branch
[1:30:45] that it was brought forth at
[1:30:47] Pentecost it will speak in
[1:30:50] tongues prophesy
[1:30:52] and have the power and signs of the
[1:30:55] resurrected Jesus Christ in it don't be
[1:30:58] afraid of gifts we don't want to be
[1:31:00] afraid of gifts we want healing and we
[1:31:03] want good church but brothers and
[1:31:05] sisters speaking in tongues is one of
[1:31:07] the gifts of the Spirit Hallelujah
[1:31:09] discernment is one of the gifts of the
[1:31:11] Spirit being able to actually see people
[1:31:14] get saved is what we're after don't be
[1:31:17] afraid of gifts in our midst that's
[1:31:19] truly the spirit of Christ but you know
[1:31:21] the pendulum swings both ways sometimes
[1:31:23] people are all about the gifts and then
[1:31:24] you go to the other side sometimes
[1:31:25] people are so afraid of the gifts
[1:31:27] because people on the other side make it
[1:31:28] such big thing that's the only thing
[1:31:30] they're after but right down the middle
[1:31:32] of the road brothers and sisters
[1:31:33] remember there will be a highway but
[1:31:35] there's also a way and that way will be
[1:31:37] a way unto Holiness and that Holiness is
[1:31:39] going to be exactly according to the
[1:31:40] word because the word is exactly like
[1:31:42] the trunk isn't it Hallelujah if that
[1:31:45] vine ever brings forth another branch of
[1:31:47] itself that Branch will be exactly like
[1:31:49] the vine itself the believer today will
[1:31:51] be exactly like the Believers in the
[1:31:53] book of Acts there will be another book
[1:31:54] of Acts written behind them because
[1:31:56] they'll be the same it's the exact same
[1:31:58] life it's the exact same bowl of oil
[1:32:00] it's the exact same Wick it's the exact
[1:32:02] same flame that flame was lit from
[1:32:05] another age it's the exact same word it
[1:32:07] can't be any
[1:32:08] different it will be the same kind of a
[1:32:11] branch that was brought forth at
[1:32:12] Pentecost it will speak in tongues
[1:32:13] prophesy and have the power and signs of
[1:32:15] the resurrected Jesus Christ in it why
[1:32:19] because it's thriving on the natural
[1:32:21] resource es of the vine itself you see
[1:32:24] it wasn't grafted into the vine it was
[1:32:27] born in the vine when those other
[1:32:30] branches were grafted in all they could
[1:32:33] do was Bear their own fruit for they
[1:32:36] were not born of that
[1:32:38] vine I just think that's so beautiful
[1:32:41] that's what happens to us if we don't
[1:32:43] actually humble ourselves in the sight
[1:32:45] of the Lord if we don't humble ourselves
[1:32:47] to the word of God to the message of the
[1:32:49] hour then what happens is we just
[1:32:51] produce the fruit that we've always had
[1:32:53] that's the only thing we can do that's
[1:32:56] the only thing we are is grafted in but
[1:32:58] boy oh boy when we get born again
[1:33:00] brothers and sisters that's what he's
[1:33:02] talking about here when we truly get
[1:33:03] born in to this word when we get born
[1:33:05] again we're born into the vine it's not
[1:33:08] grafted into the vine we get born into
[1:33:11] the vine when that happens when those
[1:33:12] other branches were grafted in all they
[1:33:14] could do was Bear their own fruit for
[1:33:16] they were not born of that vine they
[1:33:18] didn't know about that original life and
[1:33:22] original Fruit they cannot know for they
[1:33:25] were not born of it but if they had been
[1:33:29] born of it that same life that was in
[1:33:32] the original stem Jesus would have come
[1:33:36] through them and manifested through them
[1:33:40] isn't it beautiful how he just keeps
[1:33:42] saying the same things revealed by the
[1:33:44] spirit confirmed by the word made
[1:33:45] manifest by the results that it Bears
[1:33:48] hey I I if it was the same life that was
[1:33:50] in the original stem Jesus it would have
[1:33:53] come through them and manifested through
[1:33:54] them it's not going to manifest a
[1:33:56] different life we're going to have that
[1:33:57] fruit of the spirit that's the fruit
[1:33:59] that's going to be hanging on our
[1:34:00] branches John 14:12 verily verily I say
[1:34:03] unto you he that believeth on me the
[1:34:05] works that I do shall he do also the
[1:34:07] Greater Works than these shall he do
[1:34:11] because I go unto my father he goes and
[1:34:14] splits himself and allows himself to be
[1:34:17] distributed back on the church
[1:34:20] again
[1:34:22] denominations which are man directed
[1:34:25] cannot be born of God for God is the
[1:34:30] spirit not man that gives
[1:34:33] life I said that wrong remember we can
[1:34:38] have a denomination of one we can have
[1:34:40] our own ideas and say this is exactly
[1:34:42] how it's got to be it's got to be
[1:34:43] exactly like this this is my my idea my
[1:34:46] belief and unless it's exactly like this
[1:34:48] then everything else is wrong we can
[1:34:49] have a denomination brother Bram he said
[1:34:51] says denominations which are man
[1:34:54] directed cannot be born of God for it is
[1:34:58] the spirit not man that gives life how
[1:35:02] thrilling it is to think of those seven
[1:35:04] lamps drawing life and light from the
[1:35:08] resources of that Main Bowl because they
[1:35:10] had their Wicks dipped therein each
[1:35:14] Church age you know I just I got into
[1:35:16] this it's kind of like a a honey pot you
[1:35:19] get into it and it's just sweet
[1:35:22] I I just was thinking about how those
[1:35:23] Brothers was it sharen I can't remember
[1:35:26] who it was someone here probably knows
[1:35:28] the brothers that that brother Bram he
[1:35:30] told him he said go down there into
[1:35:31] Kentucky and get that oil there's a
[1:35:34] great big Reservoir down there go get it
[1:35:36] and they stall they said oh no you know
[1:35:39] whatever whatever whatever but then they
[1:35:40] started to hear Rumblings about it
[1:35:41] there's something going on down there
[1:35:43] there's a play and and and they asked
[1:35:45] him they said to him you know help us
[1:35:47] help us and he said no no way this is
[1:35:50] not for Commerce
[1:35:52] I told you to go down there and you
[1:35:54] decided not to you know I just can't
[1:35:56] help but think as we're reading this
[1:35:57] brothers and sisters when I was studying
[1:35:59] this thinking you know we've been given
[1:36:00] the instruction to get to that Main Bowl
[1:36:02] to that main gusher we don't have to
[1:36:04] actually just get into one of the the
[1:36:06] little ponds of oil and hopefully you
[1:36:09] know be stingy with it and hope that it
[1:36:11] doesn't run out we can tie right into
[1:36:13] that Main Bowl if we're willing to
[1:36:15] follow the words of the Prophet for our
[1:36:17] day how thrilling it is to think of
[1:36:20] those seven lamps drawing life and light
[1:36:22] from the resources of that Main Bowl
[1:36:24] because they had their Wicks dipped
[1:36:26] therein each Church AG messenger is
[1:36:29] depicted here his life is on fire with
[1:36:32] the Holy Ghost am his Wick life has been
[1:36:36] immersed in Christ though that Wick
[1:36:39] through that Wick he is drawing the very
[1:36:42] Life of Christ and by it gives out light
[1:36:47] to the
[1:36:48] church what kind of a light is he giving
[1:36:52] the very same light that was in the
[1:36:54] first lamp that was lit isn't that
[1:36:56] beautiful Satan wants us to think that
[1:36:58] it's going to be some other light it's
[1:37:00] going to look different it's going to
[1:37:01] feel different it'll be something
[1:37:02] different but here we have God speaking
[1:37:04] through the prophet saying it's exactly
[1:37:05] the same light brothers and sisters
[1:37:07] exactly the same light exactly the same
[1:37:09] light that was in that burning bush that
[1:37:10] Moses saw exactly the same light that
[1:37:13] was in that Pillar of Fire that
[1:37:14] protected the children of Israel between
[1:37:17] pharaoh and his army exactly the same
[1:37:19] light that led them through the
[1:37:21] Wilderness exactly the same light my
[1:37:24] goodness so
[1:37:26] beautiful the very same light that was
[1:37:28] in the first lamp that was lit and right
[1:37:30] on down the ages to the present time of
[1:37:34] this last day messenger the same life
[1:37:37] and the same light is manifested by a
[1:37:40] life that is hid with Christ in God you
[1:37:45] know I remember hearing about someone
[1:37:48] they said to someone one time you know
[1:37:50] you just have a real special light about
[1:37:53] you and uh isn't that the life of a
[1:37:57] Christian they just have a light people
[1:37:59] can see the light in your eyes brothers
[1:38:02] and sisters I heard about it today I
[1:38:04] don't know if anybody saw uh uh a
[1:38:07] message that was posted but I I watched
[1:38:09] a sermon from another brother and he was
[1:38:11] talking about beyond the curtain of time
[1:38:12] and I'd never heard about it before but
[1:38:14] brother brandham says there's something
[1:38:15] about the eyes of the Believers on the
[1:38:17] other side the way they look at you with
[1:38:20] their eyes are different
[1:38:21] when brother ran and went beyond the
[1:38:23] curtain of time and uh it really is the
[1:38:26] window to the soul isn't it and that's
[1:38:28] where we can see who's who in the zoo
[1:38:30] when we meet people we shake their hands
[1:38:32] we can say God bless you with a big
[1:38:33] smile but are we smiling truly on the
[1:38:36] inside of our hearts in our souls the
[1:38:38] the the eyes reveal something to you you
[1:38:42] know sometimes people won't even look at
[1:38:43] you that is they won't even look at you
[1:38:46] they'll just give you a hand and just
[1:38:48] not even say a word shake your hand
[1:38:50] what's that saying
[1:38:52] my paragraph 42 how much time do we have
[1:38:55] here 4 minutes not I'll call the
[1:38:57] musicians so I don't keep us too late
[1:38:59] not only can we speak thus of The
[1:39:01] Messengers but every True Believer is
[1:39:04] dramatically depicted here are you
[1:39:06] depicted
[1:39:07] here they are all drawing from the same
[1:39:10] Source they have all been dipped into
[1:39:13] the same Bowl they are dead to
[1:39:16] themselves and their lives are HID with
[1:39:19] Christ in God they are sealed
[1:39:21] with the Holy Ghost and we know this is
[1:39:24] Ephesians 4:30 we read this on Sunday
[1:39:25] and grieve not the holy spirit of God
[1:39:28] whereby you are sealed unto the day of
[1:39:29] your
[1:39:30] Redemption you know the word of God says
[1:39:33] that we're already seated in Heavenly
[1:39:34] places
[1:39:36] amen this flesh is going to sin your
[1:39:40] soul never
[1:39:42] can if you've accepted Christ and you
[1:39:44] have been baptized you've received the
[1:39:47] gift of the Holy Ghost in your life your
[1:39:49] soul can never sin brothers and sisters
[1:39:51] never you're sealed till the day of your
[1:39:55] Redemption but this flesh is going to
[1:39:57] sin and the devil's going to come around
[1:39:59] and say to you look what you did look
[1:40:02] what you said look what you thought look
[1:40:04] what you didn't do the devil's going to
[1:40:06] come around and try and make us think
[1:40:08] that we're not sealed but you know what
[1:40:09] the word of God says that we are so we
[1:40:12] need to just choose whose report are we
[1:40:14] going to believe are we going to believe
[1:40:16] the report of the Lord or are we going
[1:40:17] to take take take what the devil's got
[1:40:19] to hang on us brothers and S SS don't
[1:40:21] look at your flesh your flesh is going
[1:40:22] to
[1:40:23] perish we've got flesh and I know I look
[1:40:25] at my flesh and I've got scars all over
[1:40:27] it and I've got things in this flesh
[1:40:29] that I really don't like and you know
[1:40:31] sore Parts in my body now that I'm over
[1:40:33] 50 and you know what this flesh is going
[1:40:35] to perish this flesh is not going to
[1:40:36] inherit eternal life it's the soul
[1:40:38] that's on the inside of me and the
[1:40:40] character that's inside that Soul that's
[1:40:42] what's going to inherit eternal life
[1:40:45] don't look at this
[1:40:47] flesh he goes on to say no man can pluck
[1:40:49] them out of his hand and their lives
[1:40:52] cannot be tampered
[1:40:55] with the visible life is burning and
[1:40:58] Shining giving light and manifestations
