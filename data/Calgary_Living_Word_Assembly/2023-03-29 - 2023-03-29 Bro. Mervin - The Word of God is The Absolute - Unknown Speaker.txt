come this time and make the sun shine again after all it's a Converse foreign [Music] thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] just have a little bit of a different format tonight I met a man named Kashi a little while ago do a little bit of a business transaction and uh my friend told me that he has a bit of an issue and that problem is he has a 14 year old son with autism with severe autism our friend is a believer and I don't know if he's been introduced to the message of the hour but through our interactions I think he was able to see something and so he called me and asked me if we would pray for his son tonight and uh I said to him absolutely we would sounds to me like his son is 14 years old his name is Isaiah and they've had autism in their home with their son for 13 years it's a severe sickness it's an illness and we know brother Branham called it a devil because she and I have had that discussion and he believes it as well but what I found surprising even was that he said to me he hasn't found anybody willing to pray for his son prayer of faith so I said tonight we will gather together we'll call the Elders we'll anoint the boy with oil and we'll invite the god the god that we worship to come on the scene and Touch This Boy's Life In The Name of Jesus Christ because we know we have been given healing for this side of Eternity it's not for another side we're going to have theophany bodies there he gave us healing for this time he took 39 stripes for us here so we can be healed in our bodies so I want to invite them to come forward with Isaiah brother Kashi you're welcome brother certainly an honor to have you here your wife and I'd like to invite everyone to pray with us tonight I'd like everyone to not take this lightly like everyone to close your eyes when we pray we know brother Branham said it very clearly that when devils are cast out they look for a place to go this isn't a joke we know that we're not we're not trying to show for anyone we've got a family with a son that hasn't been able to sleep properly for 14 years we want to see Deliverance in the name of Jesus Christ and more than anything that they would be able to be living Witnesses of

lay your hands gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight we unite around as a body of believers Isaiah father we know that you are more than able to cast this devil out as our sister sang Lord Jesus we know there's nothing that we can do on our own father and Lord Jesus tonight we know that we could dump a gallon of oil and we could scream and shout and nothing will move that devil the only thing that will move that devil is if we can believe Lord Jesus when you walk by that fig tree that day oh Hallelujah father you looked at it and had no fruit but father you cursed that fig tree and you walked away and we know we read it on Sunday that everything looked the same after you spoke those words Lord Jesus but father we know something happened and your Prophet said that something in the roots of that tree began to die and Lord Jesus tonight we want to speak on behalf of you in the name of Jesus Christ we adjure this devil of autism to leave and father we thank you for delivering this boy in the name of Jesus Christ and father we pray that more than anything that this family would be able to believe you in the power of your Resurrection according to the message of this hour Lord

like tonight many years ago where we saw cancer leave this building and father tonight we thank you for delivering us from autism Lord we thank you that he will be delivered now in Jesus Christ's name your word says that if we lay our hands on the sick they shall recover and we just simply take you at your word tonight Lord Jesus father we know that we could never do anything on our own but oh my when you come on the scene Lord Jesus all things are possible father we love you and we thank you for your goodness and we just ask that you would have your way now in the life of this family Lord

just make it known unto him with an uplift hand you just have a request from Brother Paul Claussen whose dad brother Pete had a stroke earlier this week on Sunday when he got to church gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight we love you we thank you for this opportunity one more time to gather together with the author of eternal life father tonight we know that just as we've talked about Lord Jesus we welcome you in our midst father just like you were invited to that that home of that that religious man father there was one person that was able to recognize your present and father I

we want to give you a kiss Lord Jesus and tell you that we love you father with all of our hearts you're so good to us Lord Jesus father tonight we just want to uphold Pete Clawson before your throne Lord father who is Lord we know he's elderly and his body is failing Lord but Lord we know that more than anything your will is what we want to see done and father we know that as long as we're in these bodies you have given us healing father so we just ask that you would touch brother Pete Claussen in the name of Jesus Christ that you would continue leading him father in guiding him Lord Jesus that he could be in his post of Duty father as a faithful Shepherd of a flock father we pray that you would just be with brother Paul as he makes decisions and father communicates Lord we just ask that your will be done in that situation father that you would raise up brother Pete in Jesus Christ's name father we ask for every single need made known unto you tonight with an uplift hand father that you would just meet that need sovereignly father we thank you for your presence tonight Lord we just ask now that you would speak to us Lord through our brother that he would just step aside and allow you to have the preeminence father that you desire just speak to us along the way father and we'll be careful to give you all the praise and all the glory Christ's name we pray amen if we sing that song into the chamber the free Holy Spirit Speak to Me Gently as I close the door just invite brother Mervin to come and take his Liberty into the chamber be free Holy Spirit Speak to Me Gently [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] into the chamber be free Holy Spirit Through Me Gently as I close the door [Music] Heavenly lover let thy presence [Music] for amen are you ready to go into his chamber this evening amen maybe uh while you are standing let's check if presentation works amen thank you God into the chamber be free Holy Spirit Hold Me Gently as I lose [Music] let's open our Bibles to Second Peter 1 19. to 21. and I have a little bit of a subject here I know I might have preach it somewhere but I believe it's just timely that uh we have all these needs and we need to be directed properly amen and we know the word of God is the absolute and that means is the final the final of all things amen so let's read second Peter 1 19 to 21 and I'll let you have your seats after verse 19 second Peter verse 1 we have or chapter 1 verse 19 to 21 we have also a more sure word of Prophecy where antu ye do well the eat a kid as and to a light that shine it in a dark place until the day Dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation amen for the prophecy came not in all time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost let us bow in prayer oh Lord Jesus we just want you Lord to Lord to be in this service oh Lord from the beginning to the end of God as we surrender ourselves and to especially myself Lord I want you to speak through me Lord I will just reflect what your word say what your message say Lord not by my own interpretation because I cannot interpret your word online it only can come through prophets as you have declared it oh Lord Jesus we just want to surrender our Will O Lord we know we're needy we know it's timely we know it's a it's the end time we believe all the signs are before us they are manifesting every side every corner of this world because it is prophesied in your word therefore we just have to check what time we are living in and we know that we're living at the end time that's why we have to be prepared as the bride that made herself ready the bride being a newly wedded wife Lord we want to go to the rapture we want to go in glory With You O Lord Jesus Through the preaching and teaching of your word oh Lord may as we break your bread Lord may your word manifest and be understood and that we will understand it by with all of our hearts oh Lord Jesus through the through the preaching and teaching of your word may you be in the service from the beginning to the end all this we asked the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated so we don't have much time but I'll try if we can finish I have 46 slides but maybe we always remind uh the the congregation basically when we preach because we are people of we we typically we're forgetful you can say we are always we need to be reminded always amen so no one can say that he he remembers everything and we cannot preach anything new here amen because praise the lord we were given the word we were given the message which will point us to the word amen and we're just waiting for some of the manifestations but most of them are already manifested they already revealed in US revealed through the preaching of the word through through the prophet of this age where only there are things there are that will come in the future but then it's good for us so that we can we know what will happen in the future he's the Alpha and Omega and the in between it doesn't say anything but it is said it's also him but where is he he now it's in you and me amen so that's why the word is the absolute the title of it is uh it's a strong word absolute is a strong word amen the word of God or you can say the Bible is the absolute and that's the message that we believe that it's about the word of God it's not of any private interpretation let's see let's break on this one we have also a more sure word of Prophecy it's not only your brothers and sister it's more sure it means it's it will happen amen and we if we do take him it's just like unto a light that shineth in a dark place we know that light and darkness cannot coexist darkness is there but put a light on on that Darkness if for example in a room when you put a light what will happen to that Darkness it will just go away they cannot coexist amen and we are the light of this world amen brothers and you can see here knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation we cannot interpret it brothers and sisters that's why we need the prophet to interpret it because why the word comes through prophets only right for the prophecy came not in all time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by whom the Holy Ghost amen who is the Holy Ghost amen but it's the dynamic that will point to the mechanics mechanics is the word but dynamic mean this is the spark that will make the the car run you have a Mercedes so you have a a very high class so okay uh I saw this morning or this afternoon going home it's very good but then that one is just uh you know it's just a just a mechanics without the spark right it will not work at all you even though it has gasoline it has all the good uh uh good engine right everything is there but without that spark it will not run right so we need that spark we we don't we don't only need the word we need also the spark which is the Dynamics which is the holy spirit amen so just a H this is very familiar we always put this because this is a teaching and preaching Bible teaching it's treacherous because you're like walking on thin ice we call it at this point at this time it might be good to to bring the church to what I think to a complete understanding positionally of what we are in Christ Jesus we beat our pastor has been preaching on the positions of each and everyone right everyone uh everyone is a child for sure you can be a husband you can be a wife you can be a son and a daughter but everyone is a son and a daughter amen if you are of course we have a we have the same father you can say right which is the Jesus Christ himself but then the thing is uh teaching itself Bible teaching it will positionally place us amen of what we are in Christ Jesus knowing who we are knowing what we are and not to preempt or or or to be ahead it's always we are the Bride of Jesus Christ and what's the bread of Jesus Christ he will be married to us right because he's the bridegroom and we are the bride and we will be going to the marriage supper not to the wedding right because the relationship between a husband and a wife is about marriage and it started here we're having Union right now when we go there right in the in the marriage supper not the wedding the wedding is happening right now right okay we continue now preaching usually catches The Sinner brings him under condemnation by the word but teaching places the man positionally what he is and we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are you see positioning is so important even the the visions of Royal Branham until every place is in order then he cannot say you are healed or that will happen he needs to check all the details amen so it's the same for us every place must be in order before the word of God can can manifest amen and and you can see here and we can never rightly be able to have faith faith cannot even come until you're positionally knowing who you are and what you are amen so there will be a series of uh things that we will discuss here absolute the word of God is the absolute what does um where your uh merriam-web's Webster dictionary say about the meaning of absolute when it when it comes to powers or rights it's not subject to any limitation so it's Unlimited right absolute means unlimited it's unconditional we know the love of God is unconditional right our election is unconditional he elected us before the foundation that's it amen we don't need to question it amen when it comes to a ruler when you this when we say the the king uh for example in the Kingdom he has unrestricted power his word is the absolute the king's word is the absolute because it's the ruler of of that Nation or or Kingdom amen when it comes to the law it is final so if you if you have a case in the lower court right you can go to the Supreme Court to to to get an appeal or or but once once that uh case is already settled and there's a verdict on the Supreme Court then no one can uh can overrule that uh that verdict except the Supreme Court itself amen so when it comes to God it's the Ultimate Reality absolute means Ultimate Reality which is God Amen the other other uh meanings or definitions absolute means perfect it's pure positive unquestionable it's fundamental it's ultimate it's complete I'm so happy listening to the song service complete we are completing him it's a Finnish work amen because the word of God is the absolute it's a Finnish work it's a Plan of Redemption that is already done we're just playing our part it's a it's a drama amen so when it comes to the Perfection if the word of God is perfect if God is perfect then if we worship Him are we adding something to him it is already perfect no you cannot add anything to him because it's already perfect but he requires our worship we know that because he's happy but is that actually for him or for us when we worship we have to think about that because he is already perfect right are we adding something to him are we adding stature to God because we worship him because we serve in this church we are musicians we are ministers we are uh everything right anything that whatever position we have we're not adding anything to God but actually we're adding to ourselves because we need perfection amen we are the one that needs Perfection it's not God because he is already perfect from the beginning amen so facts about the Bible because we're we're talking about the Bible here that's why it's better to know the facts of the Bible so the Holy Bible is a collection of 66 books amen Sunday school right and it is composed of 39 books in the Old Testament 27 books in the New Testament and it's written by 40 different authors and it's ridden over a period of about 2000 years So Pro Branham is saying from Genesis to to island of Patmos Moses to uh to to John it's about 1600 years right about 2000 years and it tells us about the past present and future that's why he's the Alpha and the Omega and we are in the in between right because we're the one uh continuing the ministry of Jesus Christ here on Earth because he already left the sin and even the prophet of God already left the sin so where is the word right now amen amen it's in you and me my brothers and sisters that's why the word is the absolute and we are taught very well we are instructed that we have to go back to the word go back to the absolute which is the word amen because the scripture is also saying if you have something to to think about search the scriptures that's a commandment to us this is the Lord Jesus Christ saying that's why I put it in red right the red letter search the scriptures foreign and they are they with testify of me so what is the scripture then it's a it's a testimony of Jesus Christ it's a revelation of Jesus Christ amen even in second Timothy 3 16 17 all scripture he didn't say some scripture right it's all amen it's given by inspiration of God and it's what is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness so when we are corrected from the pulpit according to the word of God don't don't be offended right because that is the word of God and if you are not corrected it's just like you're a bastard child the scripture is saying right we need he spare the rad spoil the child we need and and even in I think it's Psalms 23 thy stuff is my comfort or direct is my comfort it means uh we can spare the rod right so it's good for us it's for correction that the man of God who's that you and me may be perfect totally Perfection amen totally furnished and to all good work so it means by the preaching of the word we will be made perfect amen so we're so thankful on that because we are practicing here Burberry is giving everyone who has the gift to to uh to preach because we need the fivefold ministry to be perfected Ephesians 4 11 it's very important you cannot be perfected by one man and not even even the five men you cannot be perfected because all those five men needs to preach the full word of God amen individually amen with different uh administrations of gifts amen and it's so important that uh we we we would know that having a nerd shall pass away but my word shall not pass away Matthew 24 35. so I think brother uh brother Toby talked about this you cannot place your trust here even on Earth on Heaven even and Earth because this will all pass away so where will you place your your trust even in Eden it's not a safe place why because there is a serpent there right we thought that they are perfect in in the Garden of Eden right but then there is a serpent there that deceived the deceived Eve but you know brothers and sisters the the Commandment of God was given to him I I have a second topic here which is the original sin I know brother bear is always saying okay we will talk about that but then the thing is I I have some preparation already there and I preach it in let's Bridge so it's the second part of this this is just the foundation uh of what I wanted to preach but uh it's just to to place us properly if we know that the word is the absolute then we know what is the original sin you cannot just preach the the uh the word or the Bible being the absolute without knowing the original sin amen but anyway so where will you put your trust Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away so we have to make sure that we are in line with the word everything that we do amen even though we think even or our motives and objectives are very good if they are not in line with the word then we are doing things in vain amen Matthew 4 4. but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God this Matthew 4 is the temptation of Jesus Christ with the last of the flesh last of the eye spread of life right so you can see here the first temptation is uh because after 40 days of fasting is is hungry so what's the first temptation if you uh he said if uh it is written Manchester vibrate alone but actually the the the Temptation is turn these stones to bread because he's very hungry right but then he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but what by every word not some word but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God Amen and uh I'll I'll hurry Hebrew Hebrews 1 1 God who at some three times and in diverse manners speak in time past unto the fathers by the prophets so you can see there is a pattern God speaks to or spoke to prophets and even is doing now because the thing is for us we might not be Major Prophets but we if we have dusted the Lord which is according to the word then you're talking about the word of God then you have that prophetic Ministry you might not be God but the word of God is in you amen because you are just repeating you are just reflecting what the word of God is saying amen so that's why in times past unto the fathers by the prophets amen and that's a very important one and in Galatians 1 8-12 it's Paul speaking here but though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed so you can see here but though we we he's saying including him or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel so he cannot even preach any other gospel that he already preached so that's why even the message of the hour if it's already preach and it's in line with the word you cannot change that right even an angel from heaven he will be accursed we have to be careful that's why handling of the word of God is very important that's why you can see when when the sword of the King was given to Branham in uh in uh Sabino Canyon that's the time he was able to handle the word he's ready right at that time that's why he was given the sword the sword of the king what is the two-edged sword it's the word amen now it can be handled by man right handled means he can reflect it he can preach it 100 no hips no ends no buts it's only the word of God Amen that's why the prophet of this age brother Branham we know that he preached the word and his messages go back to the word go back to the full word amen not some Theologian uh uh some theology amen because theology is the one that's the reason why we have a lot of denominations one but I can already preached a denomination can be a denomination of yourself because it's not according to your to the word of God Amen verse 9 as we said before so say I now again he repeated you see verse 9 here just to warn us right if any man preach any other gospel unto you then ye have received let him be accursed it means it's so important that we we are grounded we are rooted with the word for do I now persuade man or God this is Paul speaking or do I seek to please man or if yet please make if I yet please man I should not be the servant of Christ he needs to please Christ we need to please Christ amen but I certify you Brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for I neither recipient of man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ it's so important we cannot over emphasize the importance of Revelation Brian Branham is saying there are two things that you cannot over emphasize you you cannot overdo prayer right prayer is a must we have to do it it changes things and you cannot over emphasize the importance of Revelation Revelation means unfolding it's revealing it's uh removing all the all the uncertainties amen when it when the word of God is revealed to us then there's no more issue I think I I don't know if I appreciate it about Revelation right I think Brian can also preach it he put something and then he covered it then he asked us what is it of course you can guess but until it is removed unveiled you would not know what it is and if it is unveiled little by little you will know oh it might be for example if if I will put it in my pocket okay what what's in my pocket you'll say oh it's a it it's in the wall it's in your wall it's in your pocket maybe it's a wallet but then when I remove it oh partially I will say oh it's a cell phone but would you know what the model and make it is no until I remove it until you scrutinize it so it's the same as the word until until it's totally unveiled and revealed and you have you can touch it and I can touch it by by you and me amen that all the fruits all the uh all the manifestations of the word of God although we're not yet perfect but we will reach that Perfection amen and we can handle it amen and that's the full revelation of Jesus Christ amen Hebrews 39 it's the same yesterday today and forever very familiar scripture right that's because he cannot change God cannot change his ultimate is already perfect so he cannot uh he cannot give certain things and then he will change again right it's uh it's infinite he's absolute amen and John 1 1 and 14 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and he became flesh and dual Among Us very popular scripture that the word is God that's why he is the absolute amen Matthew 11 25. at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee O Lord O Father O Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed unto babes if we are babes then we want to learn right if we are already uh puffed up and we already made up our mind then we put a period on things we should not put anything with the period we should it's it's continuous unfolding but the the full revelation we know that is already in the message of the hour even brother Branham has a for the Revelation further unfolding but for us we are we have the the progressive revelation on the message of the hour right we cannot go beyond the revelation of the message of the hour because the message of the hour is Christ in us the hope of glory that's the completeness the perfect the Perfection which we need for the Rapture amen our progressive revelation lies in when we study the message of the hour and we found oh brother Branham said it's at a later stage amen although before the seals and after the seals and everything is is a complete Revelation First full second pull third pull everything is a complete thing that's why when we're studying the message we should see the whole picture amen not not take one coat and run away with it right right no right it's the same as scripture every scripture must the other scripture amen every judge every detail must come to pass if it's not for us it will still come to pass but we will see it like like like when uh when this message is already gone or the gospel is already gone then it will go to the Jews but we are already out in glory but that will still be fulfilled amen but it's not for us it's for them but but for us we see what will happen in the future amen so you can see here Psalms 132 it's a very important scripture here because the thing is every time we pray we pray in Jesus name but then positioning let's let's start with positioning I will worship toward the Holy Temple and praise thy name for thy loving kindness and for thy Truth for thou has magnified Thy word above all thy name so which is higher the word or the name right so because the word is the absolute if we we think about the dire house magnified your word above all your name so it means even though we pray there's no salvation other than Jesus name we know that but then the thing is Jesus is the word right and the name of our God is the Lord Jesus Christ complete and he's the word amen that's why all these scriptures are very important to put them together so that we will understand and will be positionally placed amen amen amen the next one is uh it's a warning it's almost the it's the last chapter of Revelation and it says for I testify unto every man that hear it the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in the book so you cannot add and then the next one is you can take away from the words of the book of this prophecy otherwise God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book so you see it's a warning before it ended right so you shall not ever add or take away any word that is written here right because it's absolute you cannot take away you cannot add amen first Peter 1 23 being born again not of corruptable sin but of incorruptible how can that be by the word of God which leave it and abideth forever amen and if we check the Amos 6 Amos 367 shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people be not afraid shall there be evil in a city and the Lord had not done it then this is the one surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealed his secret unto his servants the prophets so there is always a warning in the time of Noah one twenty years he preached he's building the ark he's warning warning them repent with your sin and then go into the ark but no one no one listen except his family amen there is always a warning but then after that there is a judgment there was a flood so there is a pattern there's always a warning and then there will be a judgment amen and in Malachi 456 we we were told that Elijah the prophet will be sent again before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord for what to turn the heart of the children to their fathers that's our scope that's our portion amen because he did about this already did the first part which is the heart turning the heart of the fathers to the children that's John the Baptist but brother Branham he turned the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse amen so that's God change his mind so uh paragraph 178 here caused the word of the Lord comes to prophets only never to theologians it is to prophets amen and the Lord said he did nothing in this unchanging world we just talked about until first he shows His prophets and the end time and and the end time them Seven Seals that the Bible has sealed up the Sevenfold mysteries of all Christ has to be rebuilt first and it can only be brought to a prophet we've been looking for that for years and we believe that his spirit is Among Us now amen are we happy brothers and sisters that uh we have received such a message it's not by our own uh intellect or by our by our righteousness no it's by selection amen never in this world that I would know that uh I will be elected because I'm just a sinner saved by his grace amen who can say that oh I'm righteous I'm I'm born in the message that's why I I'm like this no one everyone needs experience amen so that's why what I what I've said is uh uh I this this topic are always they always go hand in hand because the thing is we know the original sin right the original sin is unbelief in the word of God but then the thing is unbelief in the word of God so it means uh Salvation is belief in the word of God right but if you're not believing the word of God then you're committing a sin but then the thing is let's let's tackle together I have only eight minutes or maybe I don't know if we can extend a little bit 10 minutes just uh yeah there's so many good nuggets here that uh some has already seen this but most I think in Calgary they haven't that's why it's so good too to preach the original sin and to answer these five questions why do we need salvation right that's the first question what really happened in the Garden of Eden right so that what is the original sin how can we be saved why God required blood and why virgin birth why can't we be saved by Good Works let's answer this hopefully in 10 to 15 minutes we can answer them there's a lot why do we need salvation because the scripture say says or said for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God why because we were shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceived me and in job 41 man that is born of a woman is so few days and full of trouble so you can see here because we were conceived in sin because we were conceived out of lust we were not like Jesus Christ who was born of a virgin without any Union of a man and a woman amen so why do we need salvation then because the Bible tells us that from the time of our conception we all were born sinners amen I think we will agree on that amen what really happened in the Garden of Eden the setting here Genesis 2 8-9 if we will read it and I will explain it it's kind of interesting because when we just read it's just like a magazine then it needs to be revealed to us right and the Lord got Genesis 2 8 9. this is the setting in the in in the garden and the Lord God planted the garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the sight and good for food semicolon the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good ideal if you're just reading this verse 9 how many trees do you see types of trees two three if typically they they see that they only see two trees but if you if you scrutinize it by teaching with Revelation the first one is every tree that is Pleasant to the site and good for food these are the natural trees that includes Apple apricot whatever fruit that that bear fruit but the second one you see the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil so so many are preaching there are only two trees but actually when you see that there are three trees three types of trees the natural right the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and uh three of life amen and you can see it's one garden guardian of Eden but out of that Garden there are all types of trees including apples apricots Etc that's the natural but the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and the tree of life you can say they are spiritual trees amen so that's the setting so let's go further what are trees in numbers 24 5-6 how goodly are they then so Jacob and daita Bernanke also Israel as the valleys are they spread forth as Gardens by the Riverside as the Trees of line alos which the Lord had planted in a cedar trees beside the waters so you can see trees here they are symbolic of persons we are the fruits of our parents amen the union of our parents and the Tree of Life is the person of life which is Jesus Christ himself and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is also a person too which is Satan which is symbolic of that right so three three types amen the the natural tree of life and three of knowledge of Good and Evil now the Commandment of God we're talking about original sin here so that at least we can nail it down what is really the original sin how come it it is uh explained by barbaranam that way and it's in the scripture he's a prophet therefore he gave us the how how to uh it's a mystery you can say that it's already revealed for us it's not mystery because we just accepted it because it's written in the Bible amen so Genesis 2 16-17 what is the this is the Commandment to man to Adam because you will see the sequence here if it's not yet there he she's still inside Adam okay so the Commandment was given to Adam and the Lord God commanded the man which is Adam right he has a masculine and feminine uh spirit right so he's both Adam Adam means Eve is inside saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil thou shall not eat of it for in the day that thou eat is thereof thou shall surely they so the thing is in this natural setting here the Commandment was given to Adam so was there a fall when the Commandment was given there's no fall yet when did the Fall start when Eve was taken out of Adam so spiritually for us that's the reason why we need to be in one with Christ because when you're outside Christ then you can be deceived that's why the Oneness I my father are one very good preaching oh if you will tie it together so beautiful brothers and sisters if you are one with Christ you are part of him you are the word made flesh he's the word made flesh today it's what the scripture say that's also the bride we are one with him is one with us then if we are one how can we be deceived same for Eve he she cannot be deceived if she is inside Adam that's the reason why we have to be one with Christ that's that's what we are doing now we need to have a union right with Jesus Christ right now Christ in us the hope of glory what is Glory the hope of rapture right and I I want to to check the the meaning of Glory we've been talking me and my wife about about the meaning of Glory it says here uh bear with me here it's so beautiful that the that the it's so good to to meaning okay it's actually it's from Strong's g1391 it's in Greek g1391 and the pronunciation is doxa that's the meaning of Glory you know the meaning of it the the definition in the fourth one it's a most glorious condition it's the most exalted state that with God the Father in heaven to which Christ was raised after he had achieved his work on Earth so after he achieved his work on Earth he went to Glory he's with the Lord God he's in a very exalted place for us the second definition here it's a glorious condition of blessedness in which is appointed and promised that true Christians shall enter after their saviors return from heaven so that's where we're going that's why the thing is when Christ is in us it is the hope of glory because the word is in us then all the hope is in there the hope of rapture because the Rapture is a person amen am in that person is in us then we we have the hope of glory is the hope it's not hope so but it will happen amen because it's already prophesied in the world because the word is absolute amen so that's why you can see we cannot go out of the word because uh if we go if if we go how the how the deception came the sir The Serpent and its deception is in Genesis 3 1-4 in at this time Eve is already out of the of the body of Adam right he so she was given to Adam as a wife amen you can see that that is in Genesis 2 and in Genesis 3 that started the the deception amen now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yay had God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden you see he's using the word but mixing it it is trying to twist it amen but the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden which is the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil you shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest she die and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die so you see here the the Commandment said You shall surely die you see here for in the day that thou it is their Hall thereof Thou shalt surely die that's the word right that's the Commandment but then the serpent said you shall not surely die so it's it's not even a sentence it's just one word off that's why it's so dangerous 99 99.9 percent doubt or yeah doubt or unbelief and you have only 0.01 or you can say 99.9 truth and .01 doubt it will be an unbelief in total because it must be perfect the whole thing and this this is very powerful actually not is to make it negative right what whatever is the positive that's why it's a very powerful word but it's only one word it's not even a sentence and then this cause everything even sickness and everything amen so let's go eating of the fruit Genesis 3 5-7 for God that know that in the day you eat thereof then your eye shall be opened and ye shall be as Gods knowing Good and Evil and when the woman saw this is the woman as a human being right because that's not how it is because she's looking at the natural but for us we are asked to look at the spiritual that's why she was deceived because she's out of Adam right she's not one with the word and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to this to be decide to make one wise she took off the fruit thereof and did it and gave also unto her husband with her and he did it and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sued feed leaves together and made themselves aprons so what does nakedness has to do with eating of a fruit if it's really a natural fruit amen so let's explain further what and who was the serpent what what was the serpent and who was the serpent in Genesis 3 when he's more subtle than any Beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yay had God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and then Revelations 12 9 it will tell us who this serpent is and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceive it the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out of him so you can see who's this serpent he's the devil is Satan is the old serpent as per the scripture subtle means through crafty Sly and sensible but then the thing he is a beast this means what has legs and and the message is saying is it's upright so but then the thing is when when we check the uh the Judgment later on he crawled right so it means it was not a beast afterwards after the curse but before the curse he was a beast but let's let's read this so that this week you can have what was the fruit that they ate that opened their eyes Genesis 3 6 7 and when the when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be decided to make one why she took off the fruit thereof and did it and gave also to her husband with her and he did it and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sued feed leaves together and they themselves made aprons so eating of the fruit in proverbs 30 20. such is the way of an adulterous woman she eat it and wiped her mouth and said I have done no wickedness so this has something to do with eating so it's about the act itself eating and adultery are tied right hand and end so it's actually the ACT is adultery but uh let's tackle about the the actual thing there because that's just the result of of what uh what happened right it's just the result of the act and they heard the voice of the Lord uh so this is the the punishment or you can say uh uh start of the of the Judgment result of that after the ACT uh then they heard the voice of the Lord in Genesis 3 8 11. God walking in the garden the call of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou he's not looking at him physically like it has been preached because he cannot see him anymore because there is already a veil between him and God because of the sin they fell and he said I heard thy voice in the garden I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and he said who told that that was naked does not eat so it means eating of the tree will make you naked we will uh it's you you can say that these are the mystery that uh that we require so that we can accept why why we need to be saved why we need a virgin birth amen because this one is a not of adultery basically so curse on The Serpent and the man said the woman whom thou gave us to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did it and the Lord God said unto the woman what is this that house has done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did it and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou has done this Thou Art curse above all cattle and above every beast of the field shall thou go and thou shalt and thus shall thou eat all the days of thy life so this one you can see the blaming game right so you can see uh the the woman blamed the serpent the man blamed the woman the woman blamed the serpent amen so you can see after that there was enmity in Genesis 3 15 you can see there was enmity between the serpency then woman's hit you can see there and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shall Bruce his heel so you can see here there are two seeds the woman had the seed and the serpent had the seed it's so the woman said is able and the serpent seed is Cain amen so and there there is always warring twins in the scripture you can see Cain and Abel ESO and Jacob Ishmael and Isaac Moses and Pharaoh Jesus and Judas there's always a wiring twins in the scripture amen let's check the curse on the woman here and to the woman he said I will greatly multiply the sorrow and their conception in sorrow that shall bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee so the woman's womb was cursed not her mouth so it means why it's not the mouth if they eat right she brought four twins Abel and uh in in science now it is called hetero super recondation which means you can you can have twins of different fathers right it's already proven imagine this is in 50s or 60s when Barbara was saying and now with the new technology it's even possible you can see it in Google there's so many so it's just true amen and you can see here for uh First Timothy 2 11 to 15 man shall rule over the woman because it's the woman that was deceived and was in transgression it's not the man actually Adam knew what's going on and because of his love for Eve then he took but partook also and and and took the three also which is the fruit which is the act amen and curse on Adam you can see and Anto Adam he said because thou has hearkened and to the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee thou shall not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shall thou eat of it all the days of Life thorns and Thorns also and Diesel shall it bring forth to thee and thou shall eat the herb of the field in the sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it was thou taken for does that for dust Thou Art and unto that shall thou return so you see all the curse that's why man needs to work and women they workers in conception because of this curse oops uh okay it's already 9 12. it's very fast okay Eve was the mother of all living but no scriptures say that Adam is the father of all living amen and Adam called his wife's name Eve because she was the mother of all living there is no scripture that says Adam is the father of all living because the serpent is or or Kane is not the Adam's son they might not accept it but we can prove it by scripture Genesis 3 21 and to Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skin and clothe them God killed an animal to clothe Adam and Eve to cover their nakedness this replaced the Fig leaves that dried up which they provided for their own covering so covering brother random saying it's man's religion cannot provide the covering we need the shed blood of an innocent animal for his Fallen children amen but this also is not enough to to rupture us we need the perfect sacrifice because animals they don't have souls amen we need we need we need God to to do it himself because Redemption comes through through uh through the perfect sacrifice which is Jesus Christ himself amen so you can see here Genesis 4 1-2 first knowing and then two children conceived twins but of different fathers that's the hetero super recommendation that I'm talking about and Adam knew even verse 20 you can see his wife and she conceived and Burke came and said I have gotten a man from the Lord and she again bear his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of sheep but Cain was a killer of the ground so that's the first knowing meaning First Union and that the First Union Yes came and yes Abel but the second one you see and Adam knew his wife again in 425 and she bear a son and called his name Seth for God said he had appointed me another seed instead of Abel whom came slow so you can see his in the first knowing there are two children conceived which are twins of different fathers amen so that's uh the serpent first and then Adam so they they are of different uh different uh fathers basically amen so was Kane a sign of Adam so these are the scriptures I mentioned Luke 3 37 38. Enos Seth and Adam you cannot find Cain in here in Luke 3 37 38 I'm just trying to make it fast June what Jude 1 14 and Enoch also the seventh from Adam prophesied of this saying behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his Saints if you if you will check one to seven the first is Adam second Seth there's no King there otherwise Enoch will be the eight if there is a cane right so you can see the scripture will tell us that that Cain is not a son of Adam so also in first Chronicles 1 1-4 Adam said can you find Cain no by scripture you cannot find it that's why the thing is even the even the hermeneutics who who study the the Bible theologically they would they would know but then the thing is the denominations they don't accept this amen that uh for us Adam was not the father of all living because Cain was not his son amen that's a it's and you can see the this lean Gates also Adam said Enos Kanan mahalil Jared Enoch you will not find Adam and then Cain right because the birthright is always the the oldest if if Kane is the oldest then he should be the one here not not Seth right so that's the scripture uh you let's uh okay I'm uh oh wow okay a few more so you can see here what God doesn't want is mixing up seeds he wants he wants a pure Son of God that's why for us we cannot be perfect right but then the thing is we because of his blood we were made perfect he cannot see our sin anymore but you can see Genesis 6 1 2 here uh and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the Earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they choose so you see there is a mixing of seeds here the sons of God saw the daughters of men so the sons of God are Adam's Lee needs up to Noah because Noah is the last uh pure uh Son of God basically it's a pure breed but then the daughters of man are Cain's lineage they intermingled that's why God was so angry and then he sent the flood God hates I breathing that that's why he destroyed man through the flood amen So High breathing this one is very technical and medical which is the truth you you will see we have different blood types I think I preached before but without any diagram we have o a b a b so you can see here if if the parent one is a b and AV so he can be either blood type a b or a B this is based on Red Cross okay I think we will believe that because Red Cross is is believable you can say yeah so these are the the most common is o so and so on and so forth you can see oh oh so the thing is if Adam Adam came from Eve right so they should have a same blood type right but then the thing is where did this bloody blood types came from from us with different blood types we cannot even check where we came from now because of mixing up seeds right so in fact we have the serpent seed in us that's why we need to be born again spiritually right because we insane we were conceived and you can see that that uh if if for example because the most common is O if Adam is O then Eve is O then all the Suns would be oh but then the thing is we're not all type of uh people right we have different types of blood so so what's the original sin then just to to wrap up the original sin first the Commandment is don't eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil correct but what is the action of the man and the woman they eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil so what is the original sin then so the first commandment is don't eat of this fruit at first did they eat right away or did Adam eat the fruit right away no so it means they believe the word the word of God but then come come Eve coming out of Adam and then the serpent coming deceiving Eve right he this he was able to deceive Eve at first Eve when the serpent is not there she believed the word completely because in fact there is no other person there so the one that com uh that told Eve what the Commandment original commandment is that you should not eat of this tree is Adam because there is no other person there so she knows the Commandment that thou shall not eat and when the serpent is not there they believe but then come The Serpent and then he was able to deceive Eve so but in order to deceive Eve he has to take away the word of of God through Adam that they cannot eat that fruit so upon removing or not believing that word of Adam then she was able to partake the fruit so what did Eve do on the word of God then or or or of of the word of the Commandment she didn't believe the word and then she partook of the tree she believed the serpent so that's why Barbara Branham is saying it's unbelief in the word of God that's the original sin right because Disobedience many people or many denominations will say the original sin is Disobedience because they didn't they didn't follow the Commandment of God but actually they they didn't believe First the word and then they disobeyed so it's just a hairline uh reaction or you can say uh result of unbelieving the word that's why brother Branham is saying and belief in the word of God is the original sin he said drinking adultery and all these things are not the original sin they are just the product of your unbelief that's why you're doing it amen so it's just to position it that's why we we are we are commanded instructed to go back to the world go back to the absolute go back to the original word because the original sin is unbelief in the word of God that's the only way you can take out or you the only way you will be able to disobey if you have unbelief right I think a a good example is if I'll tell miles miles don't eat chocolate because your your teeth will will rot and then she he believes me right you will just believe me and then come Daniel sorry Daniel and then Daniel will say uh I I have a lot of chocolates I'll give it to you and then they say no no my my dad said my my teeth will rot no no no you see my teeth they're not rotten I have a lot of chocolate I ate it so then miles took the chocolate and then eat it but then the thing is what did Miles before before Daniel come came what what uh what is his belief he believed on my word that he will not eat any chocolate there is no deceiver at all but then come Daniel and then no you will let your teeth will be good look at mine and then the only way uh miles will disobey my or or will not believe by word or or the only way he will disobey my uh my commandment to him if he will not believe my word he will take Daniel's word right so I hope I explained it it might be difficult it's a bit uh yeah so okay two more few more slides how can we be saved then every person that is born of the Union of a mom mother and a father must have a new birth because in sin we are conceived and how can we be saved by being born again and being born again means you will have the the the the Holy Ghost in us right so it means uh it's accepting Jesus Christ as our Lord and personal Savior and New Birth means is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to us that's the message amen and uh because of the unbelief we yeah okay why why God requires blood for salvation because almost all things are by the law perched with blood and without shedding of blood there's no remission so something has to die so that we can live and we eat we need to eat food to live right but every time that we eat something has to die so that we can live we want steak a cow needs to die we live by that substance amen even the potato the potato plant has to die so that you can get the potato we will only be saved have eternal life by the shedding of the blood of the Lamb that is the death of Jesus Christ Hebrews 10 9-10 amen so okay white virgin birth oh sorry so why do we need virgin birth okay okay sorry uh page 43 brother why do we need virgin birth why is it required for Redemption because any man that is born through the union of a man and a woman is conceived in sin because of lust that's why the only perfect sacrifice is Virgin birth amen the Redeemer or savior must not be born out of last or out of sex that is the reason why Jesus Christ was born through Virgin Birth by the spoken word of God overshadowed by the Holy Ghost Immaculate Conception God himself created the blood cell amen and why can't we be saved by Good Works it's not by own by our own righteousness it's not self-righteousness but by his grace alone for by Grace we are saved through faith and that not of ourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast amen okay last last slide you see here we cannot help being what we are because we're born in sin right even if you're a sinner you're not responsible for being a sinner because we were born a child doesn't know that he or she has a sin but she's born out of lust that's why she's born a sinner right you're responsible for remaining a sinner right why there is a way prepared for you but to be a sinner you was born that way God doesn't send you to hell for being a sinner God sends you to hell because you won't repent and take Christ as your savior you refuse to take the right Road you send yourself to torment you send your own soul to its Eternal destination upon the free moral agency of your own convictions God does not send anyone to hell he never did and he never will men send themselves to hell it's their own choosing they refuse to accept the way of salvation he is long-suffering he doesn't want any to perish never wanted it so you see if we have the absolute which is the word of God then we don't need to worry at all and even the election it's already prophesied that's why when we pray we pray not to change God's mind we pray that God will change our mind and if we are praying and if we have God's mind then we will ask what the promises are I'll call the musicians right so so the thing there is it's very important to be positionally placed knowing what we are and who we are then we're already healed of our spiritual amnesia right because we know where we're going right we know our past we know the future and we are living in presence so we're just whatever happens we know we're will will be in glory right and because of because of the instructions through prophets because the word comes through prophets and we believe that and we're so thankful that we are able to understand it we see it the light doesn't mean anything if we don't have the eyes to see that's why we were given the prophetic eye which is Eagle anointing flying eagle anointing that we can soar High amen and then we can see the whole the end from the beginning we're so thankful brothers and sisters and this message brothers and sisters is is for rapture it's for Glory it's not for salvation only because there are other people other classes of people that will be saved right because they do good things to to the bride right but that's not us for us this message is for rapture I explained it before it's just like a magnifying glass that if you cannot read then you will just have to magnify and and like a microscope but you didn't change what is written there you cannot read it because it's maybe the the letters are small but then the message was given so that we can magnify it and then oh that's what it is right and also it's like a compass that will point to the North Star the North Star is always the word the North Star doesn't move other stars will move depends on the rotation of the world right of the universe but then the North Star the word the the compass which is the holy spirit will always points us to the word the message is like that if we will place it that way we would know that the word is the absolute and the word of God comes through the prophets and they will have that said the Lord they cannot say anything based on their own opinions amen that's why when this was revealed to us we we cannot have but just thank the Lord how come we open our eyes not many people understands that understand that and uh we were given that knowledge to know what it is amen and and knowing that we are the bride sinless spotless bride of Jesus Christ never seen in the first place we're so thankful Amen brother do you know the we're going back to the absolute do we have that whatever happens till death do us part key of eight [Music] maybe you can help me with that one going back to ABS the absolute I think might be there already we put it before yeah that's the one amen maybe if it's too whatever happened to the dead do wasp that's the home reflect the heart parents faces still worried Minds children search but can't seem too fine it's time we took a closer living by the holy book no compromise without any slack you'll feel forward it will just go back [Music] we know the tree by the fruit we see serving God as no in between you're either cold or real hard he said lukewarm will have no power it's coming down to in or out there's no time for playing around we're coming down to lost or found we're going back to stand our ground we're going back to living true we're going back to the absolute go back to where the church Stands Strong go back to where there's a ride and there's a wrong back to where there's black or white you see the difference is like day and night we're going back to things above
