[50:25] sister Tina Lord in the hospital in the
[50:27] Foothills Hospital alone once again
[50:29] father Lord she needs a touch from you
[50:32] and she's decided to not have a surgeon
[50:34] intervene but to allow you to be the
[50:37] great physician father and Lord we just
[50:39] ask that you would come on the scene
[50:41] Lord Jesus father that you would be the
[50:43] the great physician in her life Lord
[50:45] father that there would be a testimony
[50:47] through our dear sister to the doctors
[50:49] to the medical system in the Foothills
[50:52] Hospital of your grace
[50:54] Lord Jesus we love you and we thank you
[50:56] we ask for a safe return for sister
[50:58] funmi and Chala Lord that you would
[51:00] bring her back safely from Nigeria
[51:02] father this week thank you for bringing
[51:05] sister Grace home from Sweden this week
[51:07] father
[51:08] Lord we know that your hand is upon us
[51:10] everywhere we go and Lord Jesus that
[51:13] your angels are encamped about those who
[51:15] fear you and father we just acknowledge
[51:18] that and we thank you for your hand of
[51:19] protection in our lives Lord Jesus this
[51:22] morning as we go forwards Lord we pray
[51:24] that you would just take complete
[51:25] control father Lord that you would speak
[51:28] to us that you would speak the words you
[51:30] want spoken father and stop those that
[51:32] you don't and we'll be careful to give
[51:34] you all the praise and all the glory we
[51:37] love you and we thank you Lord and we
[51:38] just ask all of these things in the name
[51:40] above every name the name of our Lord
[51:43] Jesus Christ
[51:44] amen amen
[51:47] God bless you this morning thank you
[51:49] musicians
[51:51] we have a baptism this morning after
[51:52] service
[51:54] so we'll try not to keep us too long
[51:57] um
[51:59] certainly thankful for the desire in the
[52:01] heart of a
[52:03] believer to get baptized and I believe
[52:06] it's even more special to see the the
[52:08] life of a child recognize their position
[52:11] where there's a promise and it's for
[52:13] them
[52:15] so sister Shayla Livesey has desire to
[52:18] be identified in a watery grave this
[52:20] morning
[52:21] not literally but just to be baptized in
[52:24] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[52:26] that certainly is our pleasure to
[52:28] proceed with that if you'll turn with me
[52:30] in your Bibles today to Romans chapter
[52:33] 12.
[52:36] I'd like to take just a little bit of a
[52:38] a different thought but
[52:40] continue building on that which we have
[52:43] been talking about in the past
[52:46] certainly thankful for brother Gilbert
[52:48] taking the service last Sunday while we
[52:49] were in Saskatoon
[52:51] he's at uh brother Sig Clark's this
[52:53] morning
[52:55] taking the service there
[52:59] we'll just start with verse one of
[53:01] Hebrews or sorry Romans chapter 12.
[53:07] I beseech you therefore brethren by the
[53:11] mercies of God
[53:12] that you present your bodies a Living
[53:14] Sacrifice
[53:16] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[53:19] reasonable service
[53:22] and be not conformed to this world
[53:27] but be ye transformed by the renewing of
[53:30] your mind
[53:33] that you may prove what is that good
[53:36] and acceptable and perfect will of God
[53:41] let's just battle one more time
[53:43] Heavenly Father Lord we just ask that
[53:46] you would break this bread of life open
[53:48] to us fresh once again Lord
[53:51] we can bring the word and we can gather
[53:53] together and unite together in one mind
[53:56] and one Accord but father it takes your
[53:59] spirit to to bring it to our remembrance
[54:01] father it takes your spirit to Quicken
[54:04] it to our souls so father we just ask
[54:07] that together we could just walk with
[54:09] you along the way and that you would
[54:11] just open our eyes to this word we just
[54:13] love you father and we thank you for
[54:15] your goodness to us we ask all these
[54:17] things now in Jesus Christ's name we
[54:19] pray amen amen God bless you this
[54:22] morning you may be seated
[54:27] sorry I'm dealing with a cold here a
[54:29] little bit myself and there's many
[54:32] people in the church that are dealing
[54:34] with it also and it's just the way it is
[54:37] I was commenting this week that it's
[54:39] amazing how we can now we can be sick we
[54:43] can have a cold or an illness and it's
[54:45] not illegal for us to be out it's not
[54:48] against the law it's kind of a strange
[54:50] thought
[54:51] once upon a time I would uh I would go
[54:54] to work and you know I had a business
[54:55] and people that would get sick I would
[54:58] say so what let's get to work you know
[55:00] if you have a cold that's okay we can
[55:02] still work but covet kind of changed
[55:05] everyone's perspective on that and uh I
[55:08] think we have a little more grace one
[55:09] for another when we are sick I know it's
[55:11] totally softened my perspective on it we
[55:15] have to have Grace one for another and
[55:16] if someone's not feeling well then we
[55:19] trust that the Lord will make them feel
[55:20] well
[55:21] just to have sister Tina on my heart and
[55:24] I just wanted to take a moment to just
[55:26] give a praise report sister Tina is
[55:28] dealing with the exact same condition
[55:30] that my mom is dealing with and
[55:33] originally sister Tina needed to get a
[55:35] pacemaker and she really didn't want to
[55:37] get one she wanted to trust the Lord to
[55:40] heal her heart and uh so she wound up
[55:43] getting a pacemaker and it changed her
[55:46] heartbeat and it allowed it to work
[55:48] properly but my understanding is that
[55:50] she has a leaky valve in her heart
[55:52] and it causes a problem when her heart
[55:55] pumps even though the timing is
[55:57] corrected with the pacemaker
[56:01] and what happens is um
[56:03] if it doesn't get corrected it becomes a
[56:05] real problem and it can actually cost
[56:07] you your life
[56:09] but uh the doctors can operate on it and
[56:13] uh in my mom's case the doctors had said
[56:16] that they could do that but because she
[56:18] has muscular dystrophy they said that
[56:21] she would go under the anesthetic and
[56:24] because of the weakness of her body she
[56:25] would not be able to come off of the
[56:27] anesthetic she would not recover from
[56:29] that type of a surgery and so I'm not
[56:32] sure where sister Tina is physically if
[56:34] she would be able to do that or not
[56:37] but I just want to say you know when we
[56:39] went in I went with my mom last week to
[56:42] the
[56:43] um the cardiologist and she had uh
[56:46] what's your a cardiogram before we met
[56:49] with the doctor the nurse did that and
[56:51] took all the measurements and checked
[56:54] her heart to see how it was and uh
[56:56] you know they had told her the only
[56:58] thing we can do is manage it with
[56:59] medication we can't do anything more
[57:01] humanly
[57:02] and it'll just take a miracle from God
[57:06] and so we've prayed for my mom I thank
[57:07] you everyone who has prayed
[57:10] the doctor said when he came in let's
[57:11] start with the good news
[57:13] and I had said to my mom maybe we'll get
[57:15] a good report today you never know and
[57:17] uh so the doctor said let's start with
[57:19] the good news and he said you know we We
[57:23] unexpectedly see an improvement in your
[57:26] heart this year over last year
[57:31] my mom and I we just looked at each
[57:33] other and we just said praise the lord
[57:35] we know what's going on we know that
[57:37] it's just tremendous
[57:40] so if he'll do it for my mom I know
[57:42] he'll do it for sister Tina
[57:44] and I know he'll do it for anyone who
[57:46] comes according to the same faith and
[57:48] you know I believe as a body of
[57:50] Believers we have the ability to
[57:52] intercede and just pray one for another
[57:55] I want to say that the Lord has been
[57:57] doing things for me in my life that I
[58:00] can't even explain to you I just know
[58:02] it's God it's God level stuff and it's
[58:05] just amazing how he's been dealing with
[58:07] me in the past few weeks
[58:10] um you know even the last few years but
[58:12] just these last few weeks has been
[58:14] really profound in my life and I am
[58:16] certainly thankful he is a living God
[58:19] and he just wants to bless us not not
[58:21] with a financial blessing he just want
[58:23] to bless us and give us a big fat home
[58:25] and all of that I'm not talking about
[58:27] that he wants to bless us with our our
[58:28] rights our rightful rights the ownership
[58:31] of this book the ability to recognize
[58:33] who we are according to the message of
[58:35] the hour it's so tremendous so we just
[58:38] give all the praise and all the glory to
[58:40] God for that praise report for my mom
[58:42] thank you all for your prayers I know
[58:44] she would appreciate saying thank you to
[58:46] everyone and we certainly want to
[58:49] remember sister Tina and her situation
[59:00] is that for sister Charmaine yeah
[59:03] God bless you Sister jarmeen
[59:06] brother Peter just pointed out that
[59:07] sister Charmaine walked in here today
[59:09] with her cane and not a walker that's
[59:12] God
[59:21] amen I saw the cane there and I said
[59:23] well sister Jermaine's always had a cane
[59:25] but that's not true she's also had a
[59:27] walker
[59:28] that's tremendous God bless you Sister
[59:31] just a couple of announcements before we
[59:33] get into the word today we've got the
[59:35] the worship service coming on the 25th
[59:37] we're not going to preach it's not a
[59:39] preaching service it's a worship service
[59:40] so if you feel encouraged and you just
[59:43] want to come and sing and maybe you want
[59:45] to bring a special maybe you want to
[59:46] read a poem whatever you want to do
[59:48] you're welcome to do it and do it unto
[59:51] the Lord and I'm sure it will be a
[59:52] blessing
[59:54] we had a prayer meeting on Thursday
[59:55] night and I can tell you it was probably
[59:57] one of the sweetest prayer meetings
[59:59] we've had there's something going on in
[1:00:01] the body of Believers here brothers and
[1:00:03] sisters there is a real Unity that's
[1:00:05] forming and it comes out in prayer and
[1:00:08] sometimes that's the only place it comes
[1:00:09] out but my goodness what a tremendous
[1:00:13] meeting it was on Thursday God bless you
[1:00:16] everyone who came it was a real blessing
[1:00:18] remember the potluck after service and
[1:00:20] uh let's go
[1:00:23] I want to talk today about being
[1:00:26] transformed
[1:00:27] we've been talking about it before
[1:00:29] how this whole world is into this trans
[1:00:32] thing and I don't want to bring that to
[1:00:34] the pulpit I've been almost embarrassed
[1:00:36] thinking about it you know I just want
[1:00:38] to be real clear
[1:00:40] God bless you Sister Amber I didn't see
[1:00:42] you here
[1:00:43] um I just want to be real clear that I
[1:00:45] don't want to try and promote Satan's
[1:00:47] agenda if anybody thinks that's what I'm
[1:00:49] doing I just want to make it real cut
[1:00:51] and dried clear I'm not interested in
[1:00:53] trying to promote Satan's agenda what
[1:00:54] I'm trying to do is show the contrast
[1:00:56] between the darkness and the light and
[1:00:58] you know there's some people that might
[1:00:59] get upset by even a little bit of the
[1:01:01] discussion about it but you know these
[1:01:03] are real events this is the real world
[1:01:05] that we're living in this whole world is
[1:01:07] trying to change their bodies on the
[1:01:08] outside and they don't even know why
[1:01:10] they think that maybe because they were
[1:01:12] born a certain way or whatever it is you
[1:01:15] know what it is it's instruction they're
[1:01:16] trying to bring it into the curriculum
[1:01:18] into the schools for the youngest of
[1:01:20] children to think that they can be
[1:01:21] whatever they want to be you know once
[1:01:23] upon a time our parents taught us you
[1:01:25] could be whatever you want to be you
[1:01:27] could be a doctor a lawyer an astronaut
[1:01:29] but nowadays what are they saying you
[1:01:32] can be whatever gender you want to be
[1:01:34] talk about being whatever you want to be
[1:01:36] it's like the absolute perversion but
[1:01:39] you know I don't want to I don't wanna
[1:01:41] dwell on that just for the record what I
[1:01:44] want to dwell on is the fact that
[1:01:45] they're behaving that way for a purpose
[1:01:47] is because there is a transformation
[1:01:50] that we are instructed to do according
[1:01:52] to the word of God there's a promise for
[1:01:54] this age and that's why we gather
[1:01:56] together this way because we recognize
[1:01:58] this promise for our day and this
[1:02:01] promise is that there will be a body
[1:02:04] change but it's not going to be from the
[1:02:06] outside in it's going to be from the
[1:02:08] inside out and the only way that's going
[1:02:10] to happen is if we just follow up on the
[1:02:12] word we know brother Branham came and
[1:02:14] fulfilled Revelations 10 1-7 and that's
[1:02:16] fantastic it's great that's what gives
[1:02:19] us the ability to step up on the
[1:02:21] platform and recognize that someone
[1:02:23] needs to take that book and eat it
[1:02:25] and if we're not willing to take that
[1:02:27] book and eat it we're not going to have
[1:02:28] a body change
[1:02:29] it's that simple
[1:02:32] God's power to transform is what I want
[1:02:35] to take from today it's a message
[1:02:37] preached in 1965. brother Branham talks
[1:02:41] about it two different sermons God's
[1:02:42] power to transform God has the power to
[1:02:45] transform brothers and sisters and he
[1:02:47] also has the power of God's
[1:02:49] transformation God's power of
[1:02:52] transformation and and both services are
[1:02:55] just tremendous and you know sort of the
[1:02:57] high level flyover is just that Satan
[1:03:00] has come and perverted Mankind and more
[1:03:04] than that Satan has come into this world
[1:03:06] and perverted the word of God in mankind
[1:03:10] through the fall in the garden
[1:03:12] but you know even through all of that
[1:03:15] God has the ability to help us
[1:03:18] to get up out of our chairs from that
[1:03:20] that that perverted state that we were
[1:03:23] in Once Upon a Time in our lives where
[1:03:25] we were all crippled up to this word and
[1:03:27] we couldn't even really move on our own
[1:03:29] but once upon a time we heard the voice
[1:03:31] of a Vindicated prophet and and it spoke
[1:03:35] to our very Soul it it it it it it it it
[1:03:37] touched that sea Gene of God inside of
[1:03:40] us and caused us to come to life that
[1:03:42] that seed broke forth
[1:03:46] and we're able to read this word we're
[1:03:48] able to hear this word
[1:03:50] you know brother badame talks about it
[1:03:51] when he reads the Bible in this message
[1:03:53] how every time he reads it there's
[1:03:55] something new
[1:03:56] every single time there's something new
[1:03:58] that comes to him it's not the same old
[1:04:01] word the same old same old the devil is
[1:04:03] going to tell us it's the same old same
[1:04:04] old you've read that Bible you don't
[1:04:06] need to read it anymore but you know
[1:04:07] what it's not us reading that word it's
[1:04:09] the spirit of God quickening that word
[1:04:11] to us while we read it that's what makes
[1:04:13] the difference that's why we don't want
[1:04:15] to read the word of God like a newspaper
[1:04:17] we don't want to just go from paragraph
[1:04:19] to paragraph and and do my 365 a day
[1:04:23] reading of the Bible and and have the
[1:04:26] Bible app and say that I've just checked
[1:04:28] check check I've read it all I've gone
[1:04:29] through it all of course we need to read
[1:04:31] the book but we need to read the book
[1:04:33] with the spirit of God we need to read
[1:04:36] the book with the Holy Ghost in our
[1:04:38] lives so it will Quicken it and every
[1:04:40] time we read it there will be something
[1:04:42] new
[1:04:43] is God hiding himself in Simplicity but
[1:04:46] then he doesn't stay hidden does he he
[1:04:48] reveals himself in the same
[1:04:51] brother says through every generation
[1:04:53] now for pretty near about 2 800 years or
[1:04:57] better
[1:04:58] this word of God has been read by men
[1:05:01] priests and so forth and never does it
[1:05:03] grow old
[1:05:05] I've been reading it myself for some 35
[1:05:07] years and each time I read it I find
[1:05:09] something new
[1:05:10] that I looked over the first time
[1:05:13] because it's inspired
[1:05:15] it is God in letter form see
[1:05:19] excuse me it's the attributes of God
[1:05:21] speaking forth
[1:05:22] and it's placed on paper
[1:05:25] many times man said well now man wrote
[1:05:28] this Bible no
[1:05:30] I just love that no period
[1:05:32] the Bible says itself that God wrote the
[1:05:36] Bible it is the word of God
[1:05:39] there isn't 66 different authors of the
[1:05:42] Bible there's one author of The Bible
[1:05:46] and there's a bunch of different scribes
[1:05:47] a bunch of different people that were
[1:05:49] chosen to actually put pen to paper
[1:05:53] and it never can fail Jesus said heavens
[1:05:56] and earth will fail pass away but my
[1:05:58] words shall never fail and it cannot
[1:06:00] fail
[1:06:01] and being God because it's part of him
[1:06:03] that sort of God's power to transform I
[1:06:07] apologize I'm going to cough a bit
[1:06:10] foreign
[1:06:15] I just think it's beautiful we have the
[1:06:17] ability to recognize what what day and
[1:06:20] hour we live in we can see this whole
[1:06:23] world acting the way it is it's it's
[1:06:25] Madness going on all around us
[1:06:28] and as I said I just want to underline
[1:06:30] it I want to highlight it I want to make
[1:06:32] it bold I'm not trying to promote
[1:06:34] Satan's agenda here I'm trying to
[1:06:37] promote the word of God for our day and
[1:06:39] we need to recognize what's going on
[1:06:41] this is all because of the anointing
[1:06:44] that's on the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:06:46] because when the church recognizes what
[1:06:48] it is then the Rapture will go
[1:06:52] I just think it's so important for us to
[1:06:55] to recognize our position when we
[1:06:57] recognize that we are the Bride of Jesus
[1:07:00] Christ that we are fully adopted Sons
[1:07:02] and Daughters of God when we have gone
[1:07:04] to that place of adoption of being born
[1:07:07] again when we truly receive the new
[1:07:09] birth
[1:07:11] then when you speak brothers and sisters
[1:07:13] it's not you speaking
[1:07:14] it's deity himself it's the Lord Jesus
[1:07:17] Christ speaking
[1:07:19] and our words have power and we've said
[1:07:21] it in the past and I think it's so
[1:07:23] beautiful we can really realize that
[1:07:25] when we talk positive
[1:07:27] we're speaking truth we're speaking life
[1:07:30] we're creating but when we speak
[1:07:32] negative we're also doing the same
[1:07:35] and you know we've talked about it like
[1:07:36] one step forward and ten steps backwards
[1:07:38] we can have one or two steps forwards of
[1:07:41] positive but if we start chirping about
[1:07:43] something or someone murmuring about our
[1:07:46] position in in our lives not recognizing
[1:07:48] that God's allowed us to be there or we
[1:07:51] wouldn't be there don't think for a
[1:07:52] second we just slip into a position and
[1:07:54] it's just a big accident God's allowed
[1:07:57] us to get there so he can see what we'll
[1:07:59] do and even more than that he wants us
[1:08:02] to see what we'll do remember when
[1:08:03] Abraham went to the top of the mountain
[1:08:07] and God said to him when he was going to
[1:08:09] sacrifice his son Isaac he said now I
[1:08:11] know
[1:08:13] now I know that you love me God knew
[1:08:16] that he loved him
[1:08:17] he's God
[1:08:19] it was no surprise to God but Abraham
[1:08:22] didn't know the level of love that he
[1:08:24] had for his God
[1:08:26] wanted Abraham to see that level of love
[1:08:29] that's why he had that challenge could
[1:08:31] you imagine him explaining that to his
[1:08:33] wife we've waited 25 years for this son
[1:08:35] everybody said we're crazy we're putting
[1:08:37] together everything the more time went
[1:08:39] on the more crazy we sounded you're
[1:08:41] never going to have a baby you're old on
[1:08:43] and on and on they finally get the
[1:08:44] promised child he's now of age and he
[1:08:48] has to go now his God has told him that
[1:08:50] he needs to take him up and sacrifice
[1:08:52] him
[1:08:54] foreign
[1:08:56] will go over well in my home
[1:09:01] I would have to just take my son and say
[1:09:03] you know what God's given me Revelation
[1:09:05] we're going to go and and serve God and
[1:09:07] just see what happens but it was so that
[1:09:10] Abraham could understand it and that's
[1:09:11] why we have trials in our life it's so
[1:09:13] we can grow so we can learn so we can
[1:09:15] know him as our God
[1:09:18] and you know without that without trials
[1:09:20] how would we ever know that he's a
[1:09:22] deliverer how would we ever know that
[1:09:23] he's a Healer how would we ever know
[1:09:25] that he is the breasted one how would we
[1:09:28] ever know that we could draw strength
[1:09:29] from him when we need it
[1:09:33] thank you
[1:09:37] boy
[1:09:40] I thank you all for your prayers I know
[1:09:42] some were praying for me
[1:09:44] and uh
[1:09:45] certainly makes a difference
[1:09:47] I feel the prayers
[1:09:50] I trust you do as well
[1:09:53] you know there was a time where this
[1:09:55] word was transformed
[1:09:58] it's paragraph 37. now this word
[1:10:00] transformed I looked up in the
[1:10:02] dictionary yesterday
[1:10:03] when I almost lost track of the time
[1:10:06] that I was to be up here when I was
[1:10:09] looking for a text and I found this word
[1:10:12] or this text rather scripture
[1:10:15] and in the dictionary it says that it's
[1:10:18] something that's changed
[1:10:21] it's to be changed transformed made
[1:10:24] different than what it was it's been its
[1:10:28] character and everything has been
[1:10:30] changed in it to transform
[1:10:34] I thought about looking at my own
[1:10:35] definition but I I just landed here and
[1:10:38] I thought you know this is probably the
[1:10:40] best way to go it's just what the
[1:10:41] prophet said and just just take it the
[1:10:44] way that he said it it's to be changed
[1:10:46] transformed made different than what it
[1:10:48] was and so many people in this world are
[1:10:51] changing trying to make themselves
[1:10:53] different than what it was trying to
[1:10:55] make themselves better than what it was
[1:10:57] and not just in a Physical Realm
[1:10:59] brothers and sisters there's people
[1:11:00] Gathering Together under the banner the
[1:11:02] name of Jesus Christ that are trying to
[1:11:05] make themselves better and they're not
[1:11:07] realizing that they're not making
[1:11:09] themselves better because they're coming
[1:11:10] according to a tradition or a
[1:11:12] denomination and we know that where the
[1:11:15] denomination puts the period after God
[1:11:17] the spirit moves on and you know the
[1:11:20] last move the great last move that
[1:11:22] happened was the Pentecostal movement
[1:11:24] wasn't it there's people that would say
[1:11:26] well there was the Jesus only movement
[1:11:27] and that's true
[1:11:29] but the Pentecostal movement was the
[1:11:30] outpouring of the spirit there's no
[1:11:32] question about that the Azusa Street
[1:11:33] Revival but they had to take it and say
[1:11:36] just like every other Revival that
[1:11:38] there's only one true evidence and we've
[1:11:40] got it so now we need to quickly gather
[1:11:42] it and protect it and put a period
[1:11:44] behind it and as soon as they did that
[1:11:45] and said the initial evidence is just
[1:11:46] speaking in tongues the spirit of God
[1:11:48] moved on you're not going to put God in
[1:11:49] a box
[1:11:51] you're not going to do that
[1:11:53] he's going to do what he's going to do
[1:11:55] because he's God
[1:11:57] but we know that everything had to
[1:11:58] happen exactly the way it did for a
[1:12:00] purpose so that we could actually hear
[1:12:02] it in the day in which we live
[1:12:04] there had to be a time that we were
[1:12:06] given an opportunity for us to hear this
[1:12:10] word
[1:12:12] brother Branham says in
[1:12:13] in paragraph 38 and and I thinking this
[1:12:16] morning in Genesis 1 this world was
[1:12:19] without form and it was void
[1:12:22] and darkness was upon the Earth nothing
[1:12:24] but a complete chaos
[1:12:27] and when this world was in that
[1:12:28] condition the spirit of God moved upon
[1:12:31] the face of the water and the entire
[1:12:33] picture was changed
[1:12:35] from a total chaos
[1:12:37] to a Garden of Eden
[1:12:40] he says that is transforming power of
[1:12:42] God
[1:12:43] that can take something that's nothing
[1:12:45] and make something wonderful out of it
[1:12:48] God's transforming power
[1:12:51] brothers and sisters if you've ever been
[1:12:53] in that state
[1:12:55] where you're without form and your Void
[1:12:58] outside of the The Fellowship of the
[1:13:00] word for your day if you've ever
[1:13:02] experienced what it means to have the
[1:13:05] spirit of God move upon the face of your
[1:13:07] deep when you don't know where you're
[1:13:10] going to go if you were to die
[1:13:13] you know that's one of the biggest
[1:13:14] things that we see even in amongst the
[1:13:16] message of the hour is people are afraid
[1:13:18] people are afraid to die why would we be
[1:13:20] afraid to die
[1:13:22] what will we what do we have to fear
[1:13:24] because Paul said to die is to gain I
[1:13:27] keep saying this and I'm sorry I don't
[1:13:29] mean to make people feel uncomfortable
[1:13:30] but brothers and sisters this is the
[1:13:32] reality every one of us need to go one
[1:13:35] way or the other we're going to go by
[1:13:36] the way of the Grave we're going to go
[1:13:37] by the way of the sky in this message
[1:13:39] brother Branham talks about uh sister
[1:13:41] shakarian right at the beginning of this
[1:13:43] message if you want to listen to it and
[1:13:45] he talks about it he says that we're all
[1:13:46] going to have to go that way
[1:13:49] and if you take the words of the Prophet
[1:13:50] you say that's the absolute and that
[1:13:52] means none of us are actually going to
[1:13:53] go in a Rapture we're all going to go by
[1:13:55] the way of the grave I'm not here to
[1:13:57] debate it either way but what I am here
[1:13:59] to say is make sure you know where you
[1:14:00] stand make sure you know that when the
[1:14:03] pressure comes and stands on you like
[1:14:05] that pop can that you're going to
[1:14:06] withstand that pressure
[1:14:09] you're not going to crush under it
[1:14:10] outside of being filled and sealed
[1:14:12] you'll be crushed will be crushed
[1:14:14] and we know we know it
[1:14:17] we know it you can't pretend it we can
[1:14:20] pretend it all the way all the way along
[1:14:22] but when we get to that hospital bed
[1:14:24] brother Brown tells that story remember
[1:14:25] that woman
[1:14:27] she was in the hospital bed she was
[1:14:29] about to die and her body and her soul
[1:14:32] and her spirit were starting to separate
[1:14:34] that moment before death was happening
[1:14:36] and she started to freak out she started
[1:14:39] to cry out she started to say you
[1:14:41] deceived me
[1:14:42] to her pastor and wanted her pastors say
[1:14:45] quick give her another hypo she's
[1:14:46] starting to get crazy she's starting to
[1:14:48] speak the truth and he knew it
[1:14:52] but she knew it also
[1:14:54] she was deceived
[1:14:56] brothers and sisters don't let ourselves
[1:14:58] get to that place
[1:15:00] we got to know that we know that we know
[1:15:03] where we stand
[1:15:06] but you know when that happens
[1:15:08] Satan's powerless before you
[1:15:11] you know if you ever have somebody who
[1:15:13] is a bully
[1:15:14] and they come and they bully you around
[1:15:16] as long as you cower from it they're
[1:15:19] going to try and do that but if you
[1:15:21] stand your ground one time and you say
[1:15:22] I'm not going to be afraid of you
[1:15:24] anymore you're going to change their
[1:15:25] demeanor their whole entire perspective
[1:15:28] of the situation is going to change
[1:15:30] and you know we hear ministers say it uh
[1:15:32] brother Branham said it there was that
[1:15:35] that vision of the devil he was just a
[1:15:38] tiny little guy and what happened every
[1:15:41] time that he would step forward he would
[1:15:43] say boo and every time he would say boo
[1:15:46] he would get a little bigger and before
[1:15:47] long he was the big monster sometimes we
[1:15:49] need to step forwards and say Boo back
[1:15:51] devil
[1:15:53] and not because we just want to say boo
[1:15:55] back because we want to have this chest
[1:15:57] bumping thing with the devil we want to
[1:15:59] say hey I know exactly where I stand and
[1:16:01] I don't have any power on my own oh my
[1:16:04] but according to the message of the hour
[1:16:06] under this Pillar of Fire Satan you've
[1:16:08] got no power you're powerless before me
[1:16:10] because I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ I
[1:16:12] recognize my position
[1:16:15] we've got to know where we stand
[1:16:16] brothers and sisters this is not an hour
[1:16:18] for being wishy-washy it's not an hour
[1:16:21] for just playing church it's not an hour
[1:16:23] to just say that I'm a part of a group
[1:16:25] and I know that everything is going to
[1:16:27] be okay because it's just what I believe
[1:16:29] you've got to know Jesus Christ the same
[1:16:32] yesterday today and forever for your own
[1:16:34] personal savior
[1:16:38] the random talks about this nothing but
[1:16:40] a complete chaos
[1:16:42] and I know in my life I can speak this I
[1:16:44] was in complete chaos
[1:16:46] I mean this world was in that condition
[1:16:48] the spirit of God moved upon the face of
[1:16:50] the water and the entire picture was
[1:16:52] changed
[1:16:53] from a total chaos to a Garden of Eden
[1:16:57] that is transforming power of God that
[1:17:00] can take something that's nothing and
[1:17:02] make something wonderful out of it God's
[1:17:04] transforming power
[1:17:07] we have the ability to actually have
[1:17:09] that transforming power in our lives
[1:17:12] brothers and sisters our scripture this
[1:17:14] morning verse two of Romans chapter 12.
[1:17:18] I keep wanting to say Hebrews Romans
[1:17:19] chapter 12 verse 2 and be not conformed
[1:17:22] to this world don't let the world have
[1:17:24] influence on you brothers and sisters
[1:17:26] don't worry about what Hollywood's doing
[1:17:27] don't worry about what what trends are
[1:17:30] don't worry about letting worldliness
[1:17:32] creep into the church letting it creep
[1:17:34] into our homes brothers and sisters it's
[1:17:36] a time to not get shaky we don't want to
[1:17:38] be wishy-washy I said it already you
[1:17:40] know we heard it on the weekend in
[1:17:42] Saskatoon what a tremendous bunch of
[1:17:43] services but you know what faith lies in
[1:17:45] the church and if it doesn't get
[1:17:47] preached it lays dormant
[1:17:50] maybe we've seen people go on in our
[1:17:53] lives and because God has taken them
[1:17:55] home it doesn't mean we don't have faith
[1:17:56] it doesn't mean that the prayer of the
[1:17:58] faith hasn't saved the sick
[1:18:00] it's because God has said it's time for
[1:18:03] that person to come home
[1:18:04] and that's that but you know when we're
[1:18:07] dealing with prayer when we're dealing
[1:18:09] with faith we just need to trust God and
[1:18:11] say not my will but thy will be done and
[1:18:14] remember brothers and sisters what's his
[1:18:15] will his will is his word
[1:18:18] as well as his word he always answers
[1:18:21] our prayers
[1:18:23] you know in this message brother Branham
[1:18:25] talks about it he takes the time to just
[1:18:27] really really spell it out how how God
[1:18:30] is the sort of the attributes of God and
[1:18:32] you know he can speak and and he can
[1:18:34] write and and I think it's almost
[1:18:37] amusing how you hear some people say
[1:18:39] that you'll never hear the audible voice
[1:18:40] of God
[1:18:42] I don't know about that I I don't know
[1:18:44] about that
[1:18:46] maybe we wouldn't with a microphone that
[1:18:49] we could pick up and put it on tape but
[1:18:50] you know we can hear all what is it 1200
[1:18:53] messages of God who was it that was
[1:18:55] speaking there
[1:18:56] was that not the audible voice of God
[1:19:00] you can hear the audible voice of God
[1:19:02] but he can also write and you know we we
[1:19:04] know that he spoke to Moses
[1:19:07] on the back side of the desert when he
[1:19:09] was looking after his father-in-law's
[1:19:10] sheep he spoke to Moses lip to ear as a
[1:19:14] friend we know that he wrote the Ten
[1:19:16] Commandments with his finger twice
[1:19:19] God did that he can read he can write
[1:19:22] and he can speak and we know that he
[1:19:25] actually came and and went Babylon was
[1:19:28] was was in trouble he came and he wrote
[1:19:31] on the wall
[1:19:32] he wrote on the wall and and what did he
[1:19:36] say meanie Meeny take care who parison
[1:19:40] you've been naughty you haven't been a
[1:19:43] very good boy you've been found
[1:19:46] guilty in the balance and today your
[1:19:49] kingdom will be ended
[1:19:52] you know that's God
[1:19:54] but I want to go further with that
[1:19:55] brothers and sisters in our age we've
[1:19:57] had it happen again
[1:19:59] and and I don't know if we've heard it
[1:20:01] said very much but in our age he came
[1:20:04] into the Branham Tabernacle and did the
[1:20:06] same thing
[1:20:07] brother Brown took the time to write out
[1:20:09] the seven Church ages with the cycle of
[1:20:11] the moon we've all seen the picture and
[1:20:13] if you haven't we can show it to you
[1:20:15] it's in the the seven Church age book
[1:20:17] but brother Brown wrote it out on the
[1:20:19] Blackboard but then he says in the
[1:20:20] message of the hour I think don't quote
[1:20:23] me on this but I think he said about for
[1:20:24] three to four hundred people sitting
[1:20:26] there witnessed it
[1:20:28] the hand of God comes and writes it out
[1:20:31] on the black back wall exactly what the
[1:20:33] prophet for our day wrote on the
[1:20:35] Blackboard
[1:20:37] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:20:38] forever he can read he can write you
[1:20:40] don't want to put him in a box and say
[1:20:41] that he can or can't do anything he's
[1:20:43] God he can do anything
[1:20:46] absolutely anything
[1:20:50] you know what he's looking to do today
[1:20:52] brothers and sisters mankind has been
[1:20:55] given a perversion mankind has been
[1:20:57] given a state of of humanity a state of
[1:21:01] physical being a state of mental being
[1:21:04] where all of it has been perverted
[1:21:07] and we could say that no not mine or no
[1:21:10] not me my life is good but you know we
[1:21:13] have brother Branham say it you know the
[1:21:15] the genetically modified foods
[1:21:18] it's a perversion right it's twisting of
[1:21:21] the foods it it the way that foods have
[1:21:23] become so processed it's changed our
[1:21:26] bodies it's changed our minds
[1:21:28] there's no way that we could deny that
[1:21:31] look at all the poisons in the world I
[1:21:33] can't remember what you call it somebody
[1:21:35] might know it one of the one of the most
[1:21:38] I would say difficult things for this
[1:21:40] age for the scientists to figure out is
[1:21:42] how they can get rid of some of these
[1:21:44] chemicals that they've created brother
[1:21:46] Branham talks about them how on their
[1:21:48] own these chemicals these atoms are fine
[1:21:50] they're in nature they're just there but
[1:21:52] boy when you take them and you step into
[1:21:54] God's laboratory and you start to bring
[1:21:55] these atoms together and you create
[1:21:57] things you can make chemicals they don't
[1:21:59] break down
[1:22:01] and they have them in clothing one of
[1:22:03] the biggest things is they have it in
[1:22:05] fire retardant for airports all around
[1:22:07] the world it's leaching into the
[1:22:09] atmosphere into the environment we have
[1:22:12] it in in T-Fal non-stick spray non-stick
[1:22:16] pens it's one of the biggest ones when
[1:22:18] it first came out these chemicals man
[1:22:20] has created has caused a perversion to
[1:22:23] our health
[1:22:24] excuse me
[1:22:28] bye
[1:22:30] but you know we've been given I would
[1:22:32] say an antidote for it as terrible as
[1:22:35] this looks some of these chemicals some
[1:22:37] of this perversion that we deal with
[1:22:38] it'll never be fixed by mankind it's
[1:22:42] going to take a complete renovation of
[1:22:43] this world it's going to take what
[1:22:45] brother Branham says hundreds of miles
[1:22:47] of deep Earth to flip upside down to
[1:22:51] completely just redo this whole entire
[1:22:54] world to go back to that Garden of Eden
[1:22:56] state
[1:22:58] you know we've been given this
[1:22:59] instruction in our day to not be
[1:23:00] conformed to this world but to be
[1:23:02] transformed how do we get transformed
[1:23:04] brothers and sisters not by an outward
[1:23:06] appearance
[1:23:08] sometimes we can get transformed and we
[1:23:10] can we can go and buy some nice new
[1:23:12] clothing and we can say look there's
[1:23:14] been a transformation to that person and
[1:23:16] sure enough there has been if they're
[1:23:18] not used to wearing that kind of
[1:23:19] clothing but it's an outward expression
[1:23:22] and what we need to do is actually have
[1:23:24] the inward expression that's what needs
[1:23:26] to come out because we know that God
[1:23:28] said to his disciples he said to the
[1:23:30] Pharisees and the Sadducees that's not
[1:23:32] what goes into the mouth that defiles
[1:23:34] the man it's what comes out of his mouth
[1:23:36] because out of the abundance of the
[1:23:38] heart the mouth speaketh and you know
[1:23:40] where the The Treasure of the heart is
[1:23:42] that's where your mouth will be that's
[1:23:44] what we'll be talking about we'll be
[1:23:45] expressing what's on the inside of us
[1:23:47] and and if we're not conformed to this
[1:23:50] world but we're transformed by the
[1:23:51] renewing of our mind we're going to be
[1:23:53] focused on the word of God and that's
[1:23:56] going to be what we want to focus on
[1:23:58] that's what we're going to be wanting to
[1:23:59] talk about we're going to want a
[1:24:00] fellowship around the word of God in our
[1:24:03] lives it's not going to be what the
[1:24:05] latest sports forecasts are it's not
[1:24:07] going to be what what's happening in
[1:24:10] politics it's not going to be all these
[1:24:12] different things in the world it's going
[1:24:13] to be what about the word of God where
[1:24:16] are we truly at today
[1:24:18] remember the children of Israel they sat
[1:24:19] in in bondage for 30 years over the
[1:24:22] promise
[1:24:23] and I don't know for the the message
[1:24:25] Believers of our day are we going to
[1:24:27] stand in the wilderness in bondage here
[1:24:29] for any extra days are we going to go
[1:24:32] into overtime
[1:24:33] Lord help us Amen brother I say that I
[1:24:37] say that too Lord help us we don't want
[1:24:40] to do that let's not be conformed to
[1:24:42] this world brothers and sisters but be
[1:24:44] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:24:47] that ye may prove not that he may prove
[1:24:50] that ye may prove
[1:24:53] what is that good and acceptable and
[1:24:56] perfect will of God and what is his will
[1:24:58] his will is his word when his word is on
[1:25:00] your lips it's in your heart you're
[1:25:03] going to prove what is acceptable will
[1:25:05] is brothers and sisters
[1:25:07] we've been given this instruction to not
[1:25:10] be conformed to this world but to be
[1:25:12] transformed by the renewing of our minds
[1:25:15] and I know that's why we come to church
[1:25:16] that's why we believe the message of the
[1:25:18] hour we feed on the word we teach our
[1:25:20] children we we live and we breathe this
[1:25:23] message of the hour into the world
[1:25:24] around us we're Fanatics people will say
[1:25:27] that we're cult level but for anyone
[1:25:29] that would want to just dare take a look
[1:25:31] at the message of the hour listen to
[1:25:33] what this prophet of God spoke he said
[1:25:36] if you can't take my word for it take
[1:25:38] God's word for it
[1:25:40] just take the word of God over my word
[1:25:43] how many false prophets in this world
[1:25:45] have ever said those words
[1:25:48] I bet you're not one of them
[1:25:50] because they know they would put
[1:25:52] themselves into subjection with the word
[1:25:53] of God at that point and what does a
[1:25:56] false prophet Anointed with brothers and
[1:25:57] sisters it's not the spirit of God we
[1:25:59] know that it's the spirit of the devil
[1:26:01] it's that that poison that polluting
[1:26:05] that happened in the Garden of Eden
[1:26:07] that's what it is it's an anointing an
[1:26:09] anointed one brother Brandon preaches
[1:26:11] that message false anointed ones at the
[1:26:13] end time there's people who will be
[1:26:14] Christ's anointed ones but they'll be
[1:26:17] false ones it's true
[1:26:20] but I bet not one of them will say just
[1:26:22] take the word of God over my word
[1:26:24] take the word of God over my word
[1:26:28] you know second Corinthians chapter 5
[1:26:30] verse 16 where Four Hands fourth no we
[1:26:34] no man after the flesh maybe go ahead
[1:26:36] turn there turn with me to Second
[1:26:38] Corinthians chapter five
[1:26:40] let's just dwell on this for a minute or
[1:26:42] two I think it'll be real good
[1:26:44] still got lots of time is everybody okay
[1:26:47] this morning
[1:26:48] God bless you brother Jerry Sister Mary
[1:26:51] good to have you here
[1:26:52] they're traveling back from
[1:26:55] up north
[1:26:59] my understanding is they got to see the
[1:27:01] buses as well
[1:27:03] certainly tremendous to know that
[1:27:05] they're still fellowshipping with the
[1:27:06] church I believe they're streaming too
[1:27:08] God bless you
[1:27:11] second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 16
[1:27:14] wherefore henceforth
[1:27:16] know we no man after the flesh
[1:27:20] yea though we have known Christ after
[1:27:22] the flesh yet now henceforth know we him
[1:27:27] no more
[1:27:29] if we look at the man through the flesh
[1:27:31] brothers and sisters we're going to be
[1:27:34] disappointed
[1:27:35] don't look at a man after the flesh
[1:27:38] don't look at me after the flesh I will
[1:27:41] surely disappoint you
[1:27:43] children
[1:27:45] don't even look at your parents after
[1:27:46] the flesh
[1:27:48] look at your parents according to the
[1:27:50] word of God
[1:27:52] if you look at your parents according to
[1:27:54] the flesh they're going to disappoint
[1:27:55] you you're going to start to see
[1:27:57] Humanity you're going to start to see
[1:27:59] things that maybe they don't line up
[1:28:02] maybe just a simple example if you get
[1:28:06] to be 50 like me you'll tell your
[1:28:08] children's stories that you've already
[1:28:10] told them
[1:28:11] and they'll be like Daddy haven't you
[1:28:12] said that to us already you've already
[1:28:14] told us that story John he's gonna say
[1:28:16] it again yep I'm gonna tell you again
[1:28:19] it's human it's Humanity if we look at
[1:28:23] the flesh we're going to be disappointed
[1:28:25] there's faults and there's failures and
[1:28:28] and if we do that brothers and sisters
[1:28:30] it's not good but no no man after the
[1:28:32] flesh is what the word of God says don't
[1:28:34] look at our brothers don't look at our
[1:28:35] sisters after the flesh look for the
[1:28:37] word of God in our brothers and our
[1:28:39] sisters look at our parents and say are
[1:28:42] they leading us according to the word of
[1:28:43] God is what's being preached at church
[1:28:46] what's being preached at home that has
[1:28:49] to be a congruent message
[1:28:51] henceforth know we know man after the
[1:28:54] flesh yea though we have known Christ
[1:28:56] after the flesh yet now know we him no
[1:29:00] more
[1:29:02] don't want to look at even Christ after
[1:29:04] the flesh because we know that he's not
[1:29:06] in the flesh anymore
[1:29:08] right he died he rose again and he was
[1:29:11] given a glorified body he went up into
[1:29:13] heaven and sat down
[1:29:15] on the right hand of the father and
[1:29:17] that's where he is right now
[1:29:21] but I can say we can take this and and
[1:29:24] and spin it another way it's it's it's
[1:29:26] an amazing thought and we know that
[1:29:28] brother Bradham said the message of the
[1:29:30] hour is going to be so close that it
[1:29:31] would deceive the very elected that it
[1:29:33] would be razor thin razor blade thin how
[1:29:36] many people know how thin a razor blade
[1:29:38] is a straight razor it's it's a foil and
[1:29:41] it's super flexible very very thin I
[1:29:44] don't know what the exact measurement of
[1:29:45] it is but that's how close it will be
[1:29:47] brothers and sisters the two Vines they
[1:29:49] grow together all the way along in this
[1:29:51] message here brother Branham talks about
[1:29:53] how he is on his way back to
[1:29:54] Jeffersonville to preach the trail of
[1:29:56] the serpent
[1:29:57] the the the
[1:29:59] serpent from the beginning to the
[1:30:01] serpent at the end and we know it wasn't
[1:30:03] time for that to be preached or he would
[1:30:05] have gone there and preached it
[1:30:08] was going to be so close that it would
[1:30:09] deceive the very elected and you know
[1:30:10] when questions and answers brother
[1:30:11] Branham he says that we brought it a
[1:30:13] little while ago someone says are you
[1:30:15] are you supposed to look like Jesus are
[1:30:18] you what Jesus looks like are you deity
[1:30:20] are you God the question
[1:30:23] and and he said you know what brother or
[1:30:26] sister ever who it is you're so very
[1:30:28] very close
[1:30:30] but so very very far it's so close to
[1:30:34] being absolutely correct but it's so
[1:30:37] close to being absolutely Antichrist and
[1:30:39] and that's the way it is brothers and
[1:30:41] sisters when you have God's spirit in
[1:30:43] you who truly are you
[1:30:46] we know the prophet said I've got to
[1:30:47] decrease so that he could increase where
[1:30:49] do we stand with that are we looking to
[1:30:51] increase are we looking to get a greater
[1:30:53] stature in this life and and create a an
[1:30:56] Empire are we looking to die out so we
[1:30:58] could see Christ lived through our lives
[1:31:01] but if we look at the man doesn't matter
[1:31:03] who it is we're going to be disappointed
[1:31:04] somewhere along the way we're going to
[1:31:05] be disappointed we're going to see the
[1:31:07] hinder parts and we know that was the
[1:31:09] deal with balak and and Balaam
[1:31:11] balak wanted to hire Balaam to come and
[1:31:13] curse God's people and and he went and
[1:31:16] asked God and God said no you're not
[1:31:18] going to do it I've already blessed them
[1:31:20] and you can't curse what God's blessed
[1:31:22] too bad and so he he begged him and
[1:31:26] pleaded with them
[1:31:28] excuse me he even took him and showed
[1:31:31] him gave him a great celebration and and
[1:31:33] brought them to the the celebration to
[1:31:36] see from the hinder Parts come and look
[1:31:38] at the back side of them those good
[1:31:40] polished Believers for their day come
[1:31:42] and see the way that they behave see the
[1:31:45] way they treat their wives see the way
[1:31:46] they treat their children see the way
[1:31:48] they behave in and out of church see the
[1:31:51] hinder parts and he did it three times
[1:31:54] and we know that it didn't work out good
[1:31:55] for him but in the end they were able to
[1:31:58] come up with something else a deviation
[1:32:00] they cast a stumbling block before the
[1:32:02] children of Israel we know it's
[1:32:03] something that God never forgave them
[1:32:06] we don't want to be looking at the men
[1:32:07] if we start looking at the man we can
[1:32:10] actually be stumbled in our own flesh
[1:32:13] and you know brothers and sisters the
[1:32:14] worst thing that can happen is if we do
[1:32:16] that and then we start to talk about it
[1:32:17] what we do is we cast stumbling blocks
[1:32:19] in front of other people and you know
[1:32:21] sadly we'll be answering for that one
[1:32:23] day
[1:32:24] that's the way it goes and I say Lord
[1:32:25] forgive me because I've done it I'm
[1:32:27] guilty I'm not saying this is something
[1:32:29] that someone's doing and I'm trying to
[1:32:31] preach down at anybody I'm saying Lord
[1:32:33] help me this is something I've
[1:32:35] experienced in my life if we look at the
[1:32:37] man we will be disappointed but brother
[1:32:39] Branham says it how many times in the
[1:32:41] message of the hour don't look at the
[1:32:43] man Look Away to Jesus
[1:32:45] Look Away to Calvary Look Away to the
[1:32:47] Lord Jesus Christ because he is the one
[1:32:50] he's the only one
[1:32:52] verse 17.
[1:32:55] in second Corinthians chapter 5.
[1:32:59] therefore If any man be in Christ
[1:33:02] he is a new creature
[1:33:05] he's been transformed
[1:33:07] he's a new creature old things are
[1:33:10] passed away behold All Things become new
[1:33:14] when we get the baptism of the Holy
[1:33:16] Ghost In Our Lives brothers and sisters
[1:33:17] when we get the new birth
[1:33:19] then All Things become new
[1:33:21] and we're not looking at a progression
[1:33:23] State we're on a walk and we're gonna
[1:33:25] we're gonna get saved and we're going to
[1:33:28] get the new birth and then we're going
[1:33:29] to get baptized and get the baptism of
[1:33:31] the Holy Ghost we're not converted until
[1:33:32] we get the Holy Ghost
[1:33:35] Jesus asked Peter
[1:33:37] do you love me
[1:33:39] he said feed my sheep
[1:33:41] but right now you're not converted but
[1:33:43] when you are converted you'll have the
[1:33:45] power to do that you'll be just fine
[1:33:47] we've got to be converted completely
[1:33:51] I think that uh just sort of to this
[1:33:54] point brothers and sisters this is a
[1:33:55] totally separate quote and uh
[1:33:59] you don't have to bring it up
[1:34:01] God if you want to we've got a little
[1:34:03] bit of time I guess it's on
[1:34:05] 1964-0802 future home of the Heavenly
[1:34:08] bridegroom and the Earthly bride
[1:34:11] we can recognize our position talking
[1:34:14] about our position as husband as wife
[1:34:16] as the Bride of Jesus Christ paragraph
[1:34:19] 267.
[1:34:21] it says and if you are the bride
[1:34:26] the Bride is a part of the husband
[1:34:30] and if the only place that you'll ever
[1:34:32] recognize it is recognize
[1:34:35] what part of the husband
[1:34:39] he has in Brackets that word you are
[1:34:43] we need to recognize what part of that
[1:34:45] word what part of our husband we really
[1:34:48] are
[1:34:50] or you can't recognize being the bride
[1:34:55] many people recognize
[1:34:57] that the prophet said it's the bride Age
[1:35:00] and and where the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:35:02] but can we recognize what our part is in
[1:35:05] that word what is our part of being the
[1:35:09] bride
[1:35:11] I think it's beautiful how many sees
[1:35:13] that he says CeCe you have to recognize
[1:35:16] your position
[1:35:17] your position if you're the bride
[1:35:19] brothers and sisters is that you have
[1:35:21] Satan under your feet he's got no power
[1:35:23] over you
[1:35:24] he's going to come around and he's going
[1:35:26] to be a squatter I don't know if we do
[1:35:28] we talk about squatter on Wednesday he's
[1:35:30] going to be a squatter he's going to try
[1:35:31] and exert squatter's rights he's going
[1:35:33] to come around and try and squat in our
[1:35:35] our home in our service he's going to
[1:35:37] try and squat anywhere that he can on
[1:35:39] our health he's going to try and squat
[1:35:40] everywhere that he can and say that I've
[1:35:43] been here this long because I've been
[1:35:44] here this long I have right to this
[1:35:46] position brothers and sisters he's got
[1:35:47] no right to the position of the Bride of
[1:35:49] Jesus Christ because to him that
[1:35:51] overcomes will I grant to sit with me in
[1:35:53] my Throne that's the promise for the
[1:35:55] laodicean age that is exactly where
[1:35:58] Satan desired to go he was going to
[1:36:00] exalt himself above
[1:36:03] all of those above the clouds to sit on
[1:36:06] the sides of the north to exalt himself
[1:36:08] to be like the most high brothers and
[1:36:11] sisters that was a perversion of the
[1:36:14] most high because you if you do accept
[1:36:16] this word you understand your position
[1:36:17] then you are the most high because you
[1:36:21] have his Spirit living inside of you
[1:36:24] you can't have his spirit inside of you
[1:36:26] and not be him
[1:36:28] can you
[1:36:32] I'm sorry
[1:36:34] it's true though
[1:36:35] we'll go on to read 268 he says you
[1:36:38] can't recognize somebody else's you've
[1:36:40] got to recognize your own position
[1:36:42] don't look it man look in the mirror you
[1:36:45] can't recognize somebody else's what if
[1:36:47] Moses would have come with Noah's
[1:36:48] message and what if Noah was a part of
[1:36:50] it but it wouldn't have worked what if
[1:36:52] if Jesus would have come with Moses
[1:36:54] message it wouldn't have worked see it
[1:36:56] was a different age it was a different
[1:36:57] prophecy a different part of the word
[1:36:59] had to be fulfilled there day was in
[1:37:02] another day of the week not Tuesdays
[1:37:04] work can be done on Wednesday and
[1:37:06] Wednesday has got to be done on
[1:37:08] Wednesday see Saturday has to be
[1:37:10] Saturday's work see and brothers and
[1:37:12] sisters today is our day
[1:37:15] don't look to tomorrow don't look to
[1:37:17] yesterday today right now even in this
[1:37:20] service is our day brothers and sisters
[1:37:21] if you've got a need in your heart he is
[1:37:24] here
[1:37:25] he is more than able to meet it don't
[1:37:28] let Satan have any squatters rights in
[1:37:30] your life and think well I just haven't
[1:37:32] had God Made Real to me say be it unto
[1:37:34] me according to Thy word make yourself
[1:37:36] real to me be God if you are God just be
[1:37:39] God to me let me see you in the power of
[1:37:42] your Resurrection I'm tired of just
[1:37:44] coming to church I'm tired of just
[1:37:46] living a life and thinking that one day
[1:37:48] I'm gonna get there just bring it to me
[1:37:50] and allow me to see it and I guarantee
[1:37:52] it brothers and sisters he will show you
[1:37:54] beyond your wildest imagination it will
[1:37:57] turn into a Garden of Eden setting in
[1:38:00] your mind your world won't change don't
[1:38:03] look around to people this is why we
[1:38:04] can't look at people I came to church
[1:38:06] for the first little while and I was oh
[1:38:08] my I was amongst angel
[1:38:10] I can say it I know brother Branham
[1:38:12] talks about it but I can truly say it I
[1:38:14] was amongst Angels everyone was so sweet
[1:38:17] and kind and tender and encouraging and
[1:38:20] you know what a little bit of time goes
[1:38:21] by and before long somebody steps on
[1:38:24] your toes and you're like man did
[1:38:26] anybody see that you see what that guy
[1:38:28] did
[1:38:30] goodness sakes and before long something
[1:38:32] else happens and then something else
[1:38:33] happens and then you have to wonder is
[1:38:36] this even real
[1:38:37] but then you got to go back to that time
[1:38:39] and say well I said God be unto me
[1:38:41] according to Thy word and it's got
[1:38:43] nothing to do with the rest of the
[1:38:45] people it's only about you and God and
[1:38:47] if you want it to be that kind of a
[1:38:49] relationship he will have that kind of a
[1:38:51] relationship and you know Naturally
[1:38:53] Speaking when you've got that kind of a
[1:38:54] relationship in the world your husband
[1:38:56] your wife you know nobody can ever get
[1:38:58] between you there's zero perversion it
[1:39:00] doesn't matter what comes your way
[1:39:03] Satan wants to come around and deform us
[1:39:06] he wants to try and deform Us in this
[1:39:09] message he talks about how he would go
[1:39:11] up through the fields it's uh it's going
[1:39:13] back to the Gods uh the first message
[1:39:16] we're talking about
[1:39:17] God's power of transformation I believe
[1:39:20] it is paragraph 67 some years ago on
[1:39:23] patrol going up through the corn fields
[1:39:25] I would think of there was a limb had
[1:39:28] blown off a tree you ever see anything
[1:39:30] like this in nature
[1:39:32] there was a limb that blown off a tree
[1:39:34] and had fell over on a stalk of corn
[1:39:37] and the stock was trying its best to get
[1:39:40] up straight like it was supposed to be
[1:39:43] but it was deformed because that
[1:39:45] something had happened
[1:39:47] and the stick was laying over it
[1:39:51] I just can't help but think brothers and
[1:39:53] sisters he's not telling this just
[1:39:55] because he's telling a story
[1:39:57] he's talking about people
[1:40:00] it's people that are stalks of corn
[1:40:03] and in nature sometimes something will
[1:40:07] happen and it will hurt that stalk of
[1:40:09] corn
[1:40:10] there will be a branch that'll hit it
[1:40:12] and it'll cause that stalk of corn to
[1:40:15] become deformed
[1:40:17] and I'm not talking physically maybe
[1:40:19] somebody's had a tree hit them what I'm
[1:40:21] talking about is emotionally physically
[1:40:24] in our Spirits in our innermost beings
[1:40:28] we can become damaged we can become so
[1:40:31] hurt
[1:40:32] that we become deformed
[1:40:35] because we don't recognize
[1:40:37] that God's in complete control
[1:40:40] and we become deformed
[1:40:42] and the worst thing that can happen is
[1:40:44] we start to look at people
[1:40:46] and when we look at people and we look
[1:40:48] from a deformed perspective
[1:40:50] then other people become deformed
[1:40:53] and that's what I was just talking about
[1:40:54] we got to take a step backwards and say
[1:40:56] whoa this is God's has allowed this for
[1:41:00] a purpose and and I'm having a
[1:41:02] relationship with God here what is he
[1:41:04] trying to show me through this situation
[1:41:05] what is he trying to show me through
[1:41:07] this circumstance because you know when
[1:41:09] we truly have had that relationship with
[1:41:11] God doesn't matter what the deformation
[1:41:12] the devil tries to bring to us we're
[1:41:14] still going to believe the word of God
[1:41:17] and that's what brother Branham gets to
[1:41:18] in the God's power to transform that's
[1:41:20] the message God's power to transform
[1:41:23] we got to look for the word brothers and
[1:41:25] sisters they don't want to be caught up
[1:41:27] looking at one another
[1:41:30] we want to look at the word in other
[1:41:32] people's lives
[1:41:34] and I just I don't know if I just said
[1:41:36] it but I want to say it now you know in
[1:41:38] one way or another we've all been
[1:41:40] deformed
[1:41:42] this is the world that we live in
[1:41:43] whether we've eaten some of those
[1:41:44] chemicals contaminated Foods maybe we've
[1:41:48] seen something that we shouldn't have
[1:41:49] seen maybe we've read something we
[1:41:51] should never have read maybe we've heard
[1:41:53] something that we can never unhear maybe
[1:41:55] all of these things happen to us that's
[1:41:57] the world that we live in
[1:41:59] and it causes us to become deformed in
[1:42:01] one way or another
[1:42:03] but you know we have to be transformed
[1:42:06] by the renewing of our minds and if we
[1:42:09] are willing to come according to the
[1:42:10] scripture for our day he will make us a
[1:42:14] new creature but we have to be in Christ
[1:42:16] Jesus in order to become that new
[1:42:18] creature
[1:42:19] we can't do it on our own we can't just
[1:42:21] go to church and expect it just church
[1:42:23] attendance is going to do it for us
[1:42:24] dropping a tithe in the offering bucket
[1:42:26] that's not going to do it for us we have
[1:42:28] to have that personal relationship that
[1:42:30] real intimate place where we know him as
[1:42:33] our husband and he knows us as our wife
[1:42:37] we've got to be able to have that
[1:42:39] otherwise we'll remain deformed and you
[1:42:41] know when we are deformed if we don't
[1:42:43] actually get help for it we will become
[1:42:45] further deformed
[1:42:47] because we're already in a state of
[1:42:49] deformation if you think of the stock of
[1:42:50] corn and it's already maybe leaned over
[1:42:52] and trying to grow up around the branch
[1:42:54] that fell on its shoulder and it's
[1:42:56] struggling now there's really no
[1:42:58] resiliency when another Branch comes
[1:43:00] along and falls on it or another
[1:43:02] something happens to it in in the humans
[1:43:05] lives it's the same thing if we're
[1:43:07] already not over something and and not
[1:43:10] giving it over to God is what I mean
[1:43:11] because there's many things in our lives
[1:43:13] we'll never get over
[1:43:14] let's just be clear about that we can
[1:43:17] never tell someone you just need to get
[1:43:18] over it it doesn't work that way there's
[1:43:21] things that happen in life that you
[1:43:23] cannot get over
[1:43:25] but we know that God will take us
[1:43:26] through it
[1:43:28] I've experienced things in my life that
[1:43:31] I'll never get over
[1:43:33] some things are embarrassing some things
[1:43:35] are hurtful some things are just things
[1:43:37] that happen and you got to wonder why
[1:43:39] but then you step back and know that
[1:43:40] God's in complete control
[1:43:42] but we can't let them deform us from
[1:43:45] what the word of God says that we need
[1:43:47] to be his will is his word and we're
[1:43:49] told to be transformed by the renewing
[1:43:52] of our mind
[1:43:53] to say be it unto me according to your
[1:43:55] word for my day
[1:43:59] you know maybe we haven't had something
[1:44:00] dramatic happen to us maybe something
[1:44:02] terrible hasn't hasn't happened in our
[1:44:04] lives
[1:44:05] but we've still been born in sin
[1:44:07] right through relationship with our
[1:44:09] parents
[1:44:10] born in sin shaped in iniquity knowing
[1:44:12] that we should do something and haven't
[1:44:13] and knowing that we shouldn't do
[1:44:15] something and have
[1:44:16] born in sin shaped and iniquity and we
[1:44:18] come into this world speaking lies human
[1:44:20] beings this hybrid condition it wants to
[1:44:23] lie it's just the way it is so whether
[1:44:26] we realize it or not we have been put in
[1:44:28] a position where we will either be
[1:44:30] transformed by the anointing for the
[1:44:33] word by the word in our day will either
[1:44:36] be transformed by it by the renewing of
[1:44:38] our minds will become a new creature in
[1:44:40] Christ Jesus or we will become deformed
[1:44:43] by the poison that's put upon this age
[1:44:48] because we know to reject the baptism of
[1:44:50] the Holy Ghost is to accept the mark of
[1:44:51] the beast
[1:44:52] that's really what it is it's cut and
[1:44:54] dried
[1:44:55] brother brownie talks about this in this
[1:44:57] message he talks about the creeper in in
[1:45:00] the next paragraph
[1:45:04] oh my my voice is going
[1:45:07] he talks about the creeper
[1:45:11] and we're not talking about a video game
[1:45:13] here
[1:45:15] those people who know you know
[1:45:18] God's power to transform 1965.
[1:45:22] and we find a wild creeper in the field
[1:45:25] I just think it's so good the way he
[1:45:27] does these two comparisons because one
[1:45:29] of them is the branch falling on a stalk
[1:45:30] of corn and the other one is really soft
[1:45:33] and subtle and that's what we're getting
[1:45:34] to here then we find a wild creeper in
[1:45:36] the field which many of you men here and
[1:45:38] maybe some of you women if you come from
[1:45:40] Kentucky the woman uses the hoe they're
[1:45:43] the same as the man get out in the field
[1:45:45] with a hole we call it the gooseneck
[1:45:47] hole and chop The Creepers out
[1:45:49] for if you didn't get those Creepers out
[1:45:52] where the corn was in the row like this
[1:45:54] then that creeper would reach over and
[1:45:57] grab a hold of that corn and wrap itself
[1:46:00] gradually around gradually so easily and
[1:46:03] slyly that you would excuse me hardly
[1:46:06] tell it was rapping and finally get
[1:46:09] stronger and stronger and it pulls that
[1:46:11] corn till it's deformed pulls it against
[1:46:15] itself wraps it around
[1:46:18] its own Vine deforming it what it was to
[1:46:23] something else yet it's corn
[1:46:26] but it's deformed corn
[1:46:29] again brothers and sisters people's
[1:46:32] lives Satan is soft he's the most subtle
[1:46:35] beast of the field and he'll creep in
[1:46:37] ever so gently and he'll just be a tiny
[1:46:39] little weed in our lives just a teeny
[1:46:42] little thing and if we don't deal with
[1:46:44] it when it's a teeny little thing my
[1:46:46] goodness it'll turn into a big thing for
[1:46:48] those people who don't really understand
[1:46:49] and you want to have the visual if you
[1:46:51] do come to our place today take a look
[1:46:53] at our garden when you drive in the
[1:46:54] driveway we've got all of the rows
[1:46:56] planted nicely and we got a whole bunch
[1:46:58] of tender little weeds
[1:47:01] we've been picking them but you know
[1:47:02] what they keep coming and if you don't
[1:47:04] do something with them the weeds are
[1:47:06] going to take over and the plants that
[1:47:07] you've planted will get choked out
[1:47:11] well here brother Brandon was talking
[1:47:12] about something further these are vines
[1:47:13] that they live off the life of other
[1:47:17] things and the only way they can survive
[1:47:19] is to actually grow and wrap around and
[1:47:22] grow and wrap around I think some of the
[1:47:24] folks maybe from the West Coast would be
[1:47:26] able to identify with the blackberries
[1:47:28] those those are vines that creep and
[1:47:31] they grow like that some of the people
[1:47:33] from the South would understand the the
[1:47:35] vines that grow those Vines they'll grow
[1:47:37] all the way up a telephone pole and
[1:47:40] across the wires the guide wires they'll
[1:47:42] choke everything and anything out and
[1:47:44] that's what Satan wants to do in our
[1:47:47] lives and you know don't be deceived
[1:47:49] brothers and sisters he won't
[1:47:51] necessarily use a monster looking thing
[1:47:53] to creep in our lives and choke The Life
[1:47:55] of Christ out of us he might use
[1:47:57] something like an angel of Light he
[1:48:00] might use a really good job or a really
[1:48:01] good career something that will just
[1:48:03] absolutely choke The Life of Christ out
[1:48:06] of us because we're so busy to spend
[1:48:08] time in prayer we're so busy to go to
[1:48:10] church we're so busy to do all the
[1:48:12] things that we know we should do
[1:48:14] these creepers will choke the life right
[1:48:16] out of us if we're not careful but they
[1:48:19] start so gentle so tender so slyly he
[1:48:22] says here
[1:48:23] we have to be very careful
[1:48:25] paragraph 69 and we are all still in the
[1:48:29] image of God but some are so deformed as
[1:48:33] sons of God just to be clear I'm not
[1:48:35] just making this up this is what the
[1:48:37] prophet said and we are all still in the
[1:48:39] image of God but some are so deformed as
[1:48:43] sons of God that walk contrary to his
[1:48:46] word and to the way that he had us and
[1:48:49] provided for us to walk
[1:48:54] so I don't know if anybody here today
[1:48:55] fits this description
[1:48:57] I have lived it I have been there as the
[1:49:00] Son of God and I have had those creepers
[1:49:03] wrapped around me I have nowhere to go
[1:49:05] no way to go nowhere to look but up and
[1:49:08] and God knows exactly where we need to
[1:49:11] get to
[1:49:12] and if we find ourselves there brothers
[1:49:14] and sisters there's a way we just need
[1:49:16] to be conformed
[1:49:20] we need to be transformed I mean not
[1:49:22] conformed
[1:49:23] having this Vine wrapped around us is
[1:49:26] getting us to conform
[1:49:27] we need to be transformed by the
[1:49:29] renewing of our mind
[1:49:32] brother Adam says he he had provided he
[1:49:35] had us and provided for us to walk
[1:49:38] setting something the world twists us
[1:49:40] out of the way pulls Us close to it and
[1:49:44] away from that straight narrow strip
[1:49:46] that he planted Us in to be Sons and
[1:49:49] Daughters of God
[1:49:51] just exactly that row of seeds in the
[1:49:54] garden right
[1:49:55] in that straight narrow strip to be
[1:49:58] planted Us in to be Sons and Daughters
[1:50:00] of God sin has done this evil thing to
[1:50:04] the Sons and Daughters of God come and
[1:50:06] deformed us and caused us to maybe have
[1:50:09] an emotional hurt maybe have something
[1:50:12] very confusing maybe have an unanswered
[1:50:14] prayer maybe something in our life we
[1:50:16] just don't understand but we have to
[1:50:18] trust God and if we're willing to do
[1:50:20] that I know I promise you he will reveal
[1:50:23] the truth to you
[1:50:28] my my desire today brothers and sisters
[1:50:31] is not to say that we're all deformed is
[1:50:34] to say that this world is under the
[1:50:35] influence of being transformed on the
[1:50:39] outside and the reason it is is because
[1:50:41] the Sons and Daughters of God are the
[1:50:43] ones that creation is groaning for
[1:50:46] the manifestation of the Sons and
[1:50:48] Daughters of God there's an anointing on
[1:50:49] this age brothers and sisters for us to
[1:50:52] be transformed by the renewing of our
[1:50:54] minds by this word for our day and every
[1:50:57] single time we accept this word into our
[1:51:00] spirit womb we are a virgin to this word
[1:51:02] it doesn't matter how many times you
[1:51:04] feel like you've sinned doesn't matter
[1:51:05] how many evil thoughts have come into
[1:51:07] your mind that Satan has tried to
[1:51:08] pollute you with it's just the devil you
[1:51:11] don't have evil thoughts
[1:51:13] Satan gives you evil thoughts and if you
[1:51:16] choose to act on them that shows kind of
[1:51:18] where we stand but you know the more
[1:51:20] that we take this word of God in our
[1:51:22] lives the more that we take his thoughts
[1:51:24] into our mind the more we will have
[1:51:27] strength to withstand those evil
[1:51:29] thoughts and it doesn't matter how many
[1:51:30] evil thoughts we've had doesn't matter
[1:51:32] how many sins we've had doesn't matter
[1:51:34] how many attributes of sin we've had we
[1:51:36] can be transformed by the renewing of
[1:51:39] our mind if we just simply allow the
[1:51:41] Lord to be Lord in our lives
[1:51:43] we know many people they claim Jesus
[1:51:45] Christ and they claim the blood but they
[1:51:47] don't want the Lord to be Lord over
[1:51:49] their lives because he rules then when
[1:51:52] he speaks they listen when he says I
[1:51:55] want this to be this way I want women to
[1:51:57] wear dresses I don't want them to wear
[1:51:59] clothing that pertains to a man when he
[1:52:01] says these things I don't want them to
[1:52:03] cut their hair I want them to keep their
[1:52:05] hair long because it's their covering
[1:52:07] when he says that he wants a dad to be a
[1:52:09] dad in the home when he wants a mom to
[1:52:12] be the mom in the home all these
[1:52:13] different things that he says he expects
[1:52:16] to follow
[1:52:17] but Satan's going to come around and be
[1:52:19] the deformer
[1:52:20] he's going to come around and try and
[1:52:22] and spray poison on the word of God just
[1:52:26] like he did from the very beginning In
[1:52:27] the Garden of Eden and we know how did
[1:52:30] he do that by reasoning right
[1:52:32] Eve was with her husband in the garden
[1:52:35] God had created man in his own image
[1:52:38] male and female created he them and then
[1:52:40] he needed someone to toil till the soil
[1:52:43] right he he he formed Man Out of the
[1:52:47] Dust of the earth he created man to be a
[1:52:49] living Soul at that point and it went
[1:52:52] further than that he actually took the
[1:52:55] bride out of the side of Adam he created
[1:52:58] Eve now she was a woman given to him to
[1:53:01] give him company to to be a help meet
[1:53:04] for him and there she was in the garden
[1:53:06] and Satan knew it he just waited for his
[1:53:09] moment and what did he do he came in and
[1:53:11] he sprayed his poison his deformer
[1:53:13] poison and what did he say you know what
[1:53:15] Thou shalt not surely die he said one
[1:53:18] word off of the truth he brought the
[1:53:20] truth to her with one deformation of the
[1:53:24] truth right one bit of poison in there
[1:53:27] and you know one bit of poison is enough
[1:53:29] and it's all it will take brothers and
[1:53:30] sisters to get us off the word of God it
[1:53:32] will it will cause destruction is to be
[1:53:34] one word off that's what caused the
[1:53:36] entire fall and what happened was she
[1:53:39] acted on that thought she acted on that
[1:53:41] perverted thinking that Satan brought to
[1:53:44] her and it caused the fall but you know
[1:53:47] there is a power to transform and I
[1:53:50] don't want to dwell on the deformer and
[1:53:52] the poison that he brings but I just
[1:53:54] want to remind us that we're living in
[1:53:56] Satan's Eden he's had 6 000 years God
[1:53:59] created the Garden of Eden we don't know
[1:54:01] how long it took we've had discussions
[1:54:03] about it was it six thousand years the
[1:54:05] the creation because a day is is the
[1:54:08] same as a year in in God's world was it
[1:54:10] six thousand years to create the Garden
[1:54:12] of Eden and and so God created his bride
[1:54:14] in Adam's Bride In the Garden of Eden
[1:54:17] and and here we have his bride fall
[1:54:20] but then he gave Satan six thousand
[1:54:22] years and said go on just make your
[1:54:24] Garden of Eden go ahead and do it and
[1:54:25] then I'll take my bride out of your
[1:54:27] garden that's fine and and she will be a
[1:54:30] virgin to my word she will not turn my
[1:54:33] word down when she hears it and Satan
[1:54:35] probably chuckled and said yeah right
[1:54:36] I'll get her to curse you to your face
[1:54:38] she'll have cancer she'll be all
[1:54:40] deformed she'll have tree branches on
[1:54:42] her stalks she'll be so deformed she'll
[1:54:45] never ever ever
[1:54:47] but here we are hey brothers and sisters
[1:54:49] here we are today you know we've all had
[1:54:52] deformation in our life but the power of
[1:54:54] transformation can take us Beyond it it
[1:54:56] can allow us to to not not just forget
[1:54:59] about it but to overcome it he's not
[1:55:02] going to deliver us to our trials but
[1:55:04] he'll find a way through the trial to
[1:55:06] bring us through it to Deliver Us from
[1:55:08] it
[1:55:11] you know paragraph 70. brother Branham
[1:55:13] says the deformer
[1:55:15] I know this seems to be rather strange
[1:55:18] to speak of it in this way but to deform
[1:55:22] but that's what he was he deformed or
[1:55:25] perverted
[1:55:27] pervert means to be changed over made
[1:55:31] something different and deform is the
[1:55:35] same thing
[1:55:37] and it's been brought over and deformed
[1:55:40] and made in another way yet it's still
[1:55:42] the same seed
[1:55:44] but it's deformed
[1:55:46] and I love the way brother Branham said
[1:55:48] it in the paragraph earlier that we read
[1:55:49] he said sons of God
[1:55:52] that are deformed
[1:55:54] brothers and sisters it's not it's not a
[1:55:57] bad thing to admit that I have had
[1:55:59] something happen in my life
[1:56:01] I've had a hurt I've had a
[1:56:04] misunderstanding
[1:56:05] you know brother Bradham he tells a
[1:56:07] story I can't remember what message it
[1:56:09] is even I think it's around this this
[1:56:11] era in 1965. but brother Bradham tells
[1:56:13] the vision of how he saw the people
[1:56:15] locked in behind the bars
[1:56:18] and they were groaning and trying to get
[1:56:20] out and and brother Branham he saw was
[1:56:23] it Roy borders he was in there and he
[1:56:25] said brother borders brother borders I I
[1:56:28] hope you can get out of there what's
[1:56:29] wrong with you what's wrong brother
[1:56:31] borders
[1:56:33] and he said brother Branham this is the
[1:56:35] house of hell
[1:56:37] and he saw those people and he said I
[1:56:39] just stood back and I just watched those
[1:56:40] people for a while because I thought
[1:56:42] maybe they'd get out I wanted to see
[1:56:44] what would happen and he saw that they
[1:56:45] were trapped behind those bars
[1:56:48] and and you know I I think it's amazing
[1:56:51] to think about
[1:56:54] excuse me those bars we heard talked
[1:56:56] about on the weekend those bars were
[1:56:58] bars of misunderstandings
[1:57:02] bars of misunderstandings people
[1:57:05] misunderstanding the word of God people
[1:57:07] misunderstanding one another
[1:57:10] and to think there was a time where the
[1:57:13] Prophet heard those words
[1:57:14] deliver those people
[1:57:16] and what did he say House of Hell give
[1:57:19] way to the name of Jesus Christ
[1:57:22] set those people free
[1:57:24] and you know brothers and sisters I want
[1:57:25] to say that today if we've got bars of
[1:57:28] misunderstanding in our lives
[1:57:30] let's let's break those bars down in the
[1:57:33] name of Jesus Christ let's not let those
[1:57:35] bars rule us and be a ceiling over us or
[1:57:38] keep us from going forwards we've got to
[1:57:41] be able to get through those bars of of
[1:57:43] misunderstanding
[1:57:46] brother Branham he talks about it how
[1:57:48] Sons and Daughters of God can be
[1:57:50] disformed and and it's not a bad thing
[1:57:53] it's just a thing you know nature the
[1:57:56] way God created it we were talking about
[1:57:57] yesterday I was on the phone with my
[1:57:59] brother and the way nature is is neither
[1:58:02] good or bad it just is
[1:58:04] one animal eats another animal it's sad
[1:58:07] from a human compassionate perspective
[1:58:09] but that's just the way God created it
[1:58:11] one animal is there for another animal's
[1:58:13] food
[1:58:15] but the devil has perverted it
[1:58:18] Satan has perverted it he's taken this
[1:58:20] world that we live in and made it his
[1:58:22] Eden and you know it's not going to get
[1:58:24] any brighter
[1:58:26] the forecast is that it's going to get a
[1:58:28] whole lot darker and a whole lot
[1:58:30] stormier
[1:58:31] and that's why brothers and sisters we
[1:58:32] need to know exactly where we stand this
[1:58:35] is not a time to be wishy-washy with
[1:58:37] church it's not a time to not know where
[1:58:39] we stand with the message of the hour
[1:58:41] whether God sent a prophet or whether he
[1:58:43] didn't you know I say it to people if
[1:58:45] God were to send a prophet today if you
[1:58:48] were to send a prophet to Earth today
[1:58:49] would you want to hear that message
[1:58:51] would you want to hear what he had to
[1:58:52] say because a prophet is a messenger
[1:58:54] from God
[1:58:55] and and most people say yeah I would but
[1:58:57] I just can't do that or I just can't do
[1:58:59] the other thing and and it's too bad
[1:59:01] really because we know a Noah's day they
[1:59:04] were told it's going to rain
[1:59:06] but what did they say scientifically we
[1:59:08] can prove it ain't gonna rain we know
[1:59:09] it's not going to rain Noah you're crazy
[1:59:10] you got sunburned your crazy old crank
[1:59:13] up there beating on the wood on the hill
[1:59:15] building that boat I just keep going
[1:59:17] back to this and I apologize brothers
[1:59:18] and sisters but I do think it's really
[1:59:20] this clear and this simple that it is
[1:59:22] that way unless we get in the boat we're
[1:59:25] not going to make it
[1:59:26] and the boat is the message of the hour
[1:59:28] don't be conformed to this world
[1:59:30] brothers and sisters but be transformed
[1:59:32] by the renewing of your mind and the
[1:59:34] renewing of your mind to what the
[1:59:35] renewing of your mind to this message of
[1:59:37] the hour that God did send a prophet and
[1:59:40] he had a message that he loves you
[1:59:43] not that you have to know all these
[1:59:45] Mysteries this is something that I think
[1:59:47] needs to be spoken real clearly is all
[1:59:50] of these Mysteries they're not going to
[1:59:51] save you understanding the seals they're
[1:59:54] not going to save you understanding the
[1:59:55] seven unknown Thunders they're not going
[1:59:57] to save you there's people that want to
[1:59:58] take and make all of this understanding
[2:00:01] all of this knowledge all of this
[2:00:02] learning to be the saving Factor that's
[2:00:04] not going to save you having a
[2:00:06] relationship with Jesus Christ is what's
[2:00:08] going to save you the only thing you've
[2:00:10] got to do is recognize him as your
[2:00:12] savior today that he died and rose again
[2:00:14] so that you could be saved so that you
[2:00:16] could go and sit with him in his throne
[2:00:18] and if you're willing to do that then
[2:00:20] all the rest of this will just become
[2:00:22] clear to you you'll just understand what
[2:00:25] this means
[2:00:27] but brothers and sisters therefore If
[2:00:29] any man be in Christ
[2:00:31] how do you get into Christ
[2:00:33] you get into his word
[2:00:35] because he is his word
[2:00:37] in the beginning was the word
[2:00:40] the word was with God and the Word was
[2:00:41] God
[2:00:42] and the Word was made flesh
[2:00:45] and dwelt Among Us therefore If any man
[2:00:47] be in Christ he is a new creature
[2:00:50] old things are passed away behold All
[2:00:53] Things become new and it's a very true
[2:00:55] statement brothers and sisters if you
[2:00:57] get into Christ Jesus just one time
[2:00:59] everything changes in your life you are
[2:01:01] not the same person that you once were
[2:01:04] it is impossible
[2:01:08] and you know I just think
[2:01:10] I want to encourage us today brothers
[2:01:12] and sisters
[2:01:13] don't listen to the devil
[2:01:16] he's a liar
[2:01:19] and anytime you want to know whether
[2:01:21] it's the devil or not
[2:01:23] compared to the word whatever it is
[2:01:25] you're thinking whatever the the
[2:01:26] thoughts are that are coming to you
[2:01:28] whatever someone is saying to you
[2:01:30] just to see if it lines up with the word
[2:01:32] or not and if it doesn't then just leave
[2:01:34] it alone
[2:01:36] but I want to encourage us with this
[2:01:38] Romans 8 1 there is therefore now no
[2:01:41] condemnation
[2:01:43] to them which are in Christ Jesus who
[2:01:45] walk not after the flesh but they walk
[2:01:48] after the spirit
[2:01:50] we don't walk after this flesh we're not
[2:01:52] conforming to this world we're not
[2:01:54] looking to see if we can be like
[2:01:57] Hollywood we're not looking to see if we
[2:01:59] can be like the music or the video games
[2:02:01] or all of these influencing social media
[2:02:04] things brothers and sisters all of that
[2:02:06] is going to burn that will take us down
[2:02:10] but if we can focus on the word of God
[2:02:12] for our day we will recognize that we're
[2:02:14] not walking after this flesh but we're
[2:02:16] walking after the spirit of God and the
[2:02:19] spirit of God is what's going to take us
[2:02:21] to that place where we know that there's
[2:02:23] no condemnation so if I were to walk out
[2:02:25] of here today and get hit by a bus and
[2:02:28] and my soul would fly out of my body and
[2:02:30] I would go I would go to heaven I
[2:02:32] wouldn't have to go to the morgue and
[2:02:34] risk going to hell risk going to Hades
[2:02:36] risk going to the grave and not know
[2:02:39] where I'm going to be and and what's
[2:02:41] going to happen but that's what happens
[2:02:42] to people who don't know who haven't
[2:02:44] made it right with God
[2:02:48] why I don't know why I'm doing this
[2:02:50] it's it's it's the way it is brothers
[2:02:52] and sisters we need to know where we
[2:02:54] stand
[2:02:55] and when we do we have no fear
[2:03:01] and why is that
[2:03:03] because our goal is to get charity isn't
[2:03:05] it the Capstone Ministries to have
[2:03:07] charity and charity is love
[2:03:09] and love
[2:03:11] love casts out all fear
[2:03:14] so if we see someone in fear
[2:03:16] it's sad but we can say you know what
[2:03:19] something ain't right there
[2:03:21] according to the message of the hour
[2:03:22] according to the word for our day when
[2:03:25] someone's deathly afraid something wrong
[2:03:29] you know brother Bosworth on his
[2:03:31] Deathbed
[2:03:33] brother Brown and went and had the
[2:03:34] conversation with him and said oh my
[2:03:37] how do you feel
[2:03:39] they said I feel great and he said but
[2:03:41] you're dying
[2:03:43] they said no I'm not I'm more alive
[2:03:44] right now than I ever was
[2:03:47] and I'm seeing Believers all over the
[2:03:49] place I'm seeing the promise of my life
[2:03:52] come to pass I'm not afraid to die I
[2:03:55] just think it's such a beautiful thing
[2:03:57] maybe maybe I'm gonna go and have a
[2:03:59] situation but I just said I don't know
[2:04:01] why I'm talking like this I think it's
[2:04:02] so bizarre but we just need to know
[2:04:04] where we stand don't we this is a world
[2:04:07] where it's just crazy it's upside down
[2:04:10] and I just want to encourage us what are
[2:04:12] we looking at
[2:04:13] we were talking about this with the
[2:04:15] young people and it was such a beautiful
[2:04:16] conversation I'm sorry that I had to get
[2:04:18] so tired and go to bed
[2:04:21] the young people stayed till very late
[2:04:23] and I think it's tremendous it's a
[2:04:25] wonderful thing you know some parents
[2:04:27] might get upset by that but I want to
[2:04:29] say this the young people are going to
[2:04:31] do something
[2:04:32] and what would you rather have them do
[2:04:33] hang out with Believers or go and find
[2:04:35] their own entertainment somewhere
[2:04:37] I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm a living
[2:04:39] witness you don't want them to go and
[2:04:40] find their entertainment out there
[2:04:42] brothers and sisters get them with
[2:04:43] Believers get them with believers do all
[2:04:45] you can to get them with Believers as
[2:04:48] parents it's our responsibility to make
[2:04:50] sure that our children are
[2:04:51] fellowshipping with believers
[2:04:54] but what are we looking at
[2:04:56] that's the key
[2:04:58] we were talking about it with the young
[2:05:00] people and I I
[2:05:02] think it's beautiful because it applies
[2:05:04] to the adults too not just the young
[2:05:06] people and I know we're talking about
[2:05:07] young adults but the key takeaway from
[2:05:10] our conversation is our attitude is
[2:05:11] everything
[2:05:13] our attitude is absolutely everything
[2:05:15] and we know that brother Branham says it
[2:05:17] that a right mental attitude towards any
[2:05:19] one of the Divine promises in the word
[2:05:21] will actually bring it to pass having
[2:05:24] the right mental attitude towards the
[2:05:26] word of God brothers and sisters will
[2:05:28] make all the difference but if we've got
[2:05:30] the attitude where maybe it's
[2:05:31] indifference maybe it's sin maybe it's
[2:05:34] different things in our lives Traditions
[2:05:36] or whatever our attitude is going to
[2:05:38] make all the difference
[2:05:40] but there's a promise for our age let's
[2:05:42] turn to First Corinthians chapter 15. as
[2:05:45] we close today I'll call the musicians
[2:05:48] because we have the baptismal I don't
[2:05:50] want to
[2:05:51] go too long here
[2:05:55] still
[2:05:56] have a little bit here
[2:06:00] I think it's just wonderful this word of
[2:06:03] God that we have
[2:06:05] our attitude makes all the difference
[2:06:07] brothers and sisters
[2:06:08] First Corinthians 15 verse 51.
[2:06:12] behold I show you a mystery
[2:06:15] we shall not all sleep
[2:06:18] but we shall all be changed
[2:06:21] there is going to be a body change
[2:06:25] and whether we go by the way of the
[2:06:27] grave
[2:06:28] there will be a body waiting for us
[2:06:29] because we know that if this Earthly
[2:06:32] Tabernacle be dissolved there is a body
[2:06:34] already waiting for us and if we're not
[2:06:37] present in this body that means that
[2:06:40] we're present with God right
[2:06:43] behold I show you a mystery we shall not
[2:06:45] all sleep but we shall all be changed in
[2:06:48] a moment in the twinkling of an eye at
[2:06:51] the last Trump for the trumpet shall
[2:06:53] sound and the dead in Christ
[2:06:56] shall be raised incorruptible
[2:06:59] and we shall be changed
[2:07:02] did you just think about that word
[2:07:03] Incorruptible for a second what that
[2:07:06] means
[2:07:07] there's no power over death there's no
[2:07:09] no power of death over us there's no
[2:07:12] deformation there's no poison from Satan
[2:07:16] in our lives when when that Trump sounds
[2:07:19] and the dead in Christ rise brothers and
[2:07:21] sisters
[2:07:22] that's a perfect body
[2:07:27] verse 53 for this corruptable this flesh
[2:07:31] this corruptable must put on in
[2:07:34] corruption and this Mortal
[2:07:37] must put on immortality
[2:07:40] so when this corruptible shall have put
[2:07:42] on incorruption and this Mortal shall
[2:07:45] have put on immortality
[2:07:48] then shall be brought to pass the same
[2:07:51] that it is written death is swallowed up
[2:07:53] in Victory
[2:07:59] together and we'll be able to say it
[2:08:03] oh my
[2:08:09] something doesn't want me to speak these
[2:08:10] words here
[2:08:11] ah but I'm gonna choke them out oh death
[2:08:15] where is thy sting oh grave where is thy
[2:08:17] victory
[2:08:19] The Sting of death is sin and the
[2:08:21] strength of sin is the law
[2:08:24] but thanks be to God which giveth us the
[2:08:28] victory through our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:08:34] been with me this morning
[2:08:37] brothers and sisters
[2:08:39] there is a deformer
[2:08:41] and that's what this world is
[2:08:44] Satan's Eden there is a deformer
[2:08:46] marching through the land
[2:08:48] but there is also a Transformer
[2:08:52] [Music]
[2:08:58] there is a Transformer
[2:09:01] and you know
[2:09:03] that is Christ Our Hope of Glory
[2:09:07] we just have a prayer request here I'm
[2:09:09] going to stop because I don't think I
[2:09:10] have any more voice
[2:09:14] apologize
[2:09:16] um the neighbor Leonard
[2:09:19] I think his name is I think he lives

[2:10:02] come together this morning so that one
[2:10:04] more time father you could renew us you
[2:10:07] could stir up our Pure Minds by way of
[2:10:10] remembrance father that we could
[2:10:12] recognize that even as Sons and
[2:10:13] Daughters of God we can have things in
[2:10:16] our lives Lord where we've been deformed
[2:10:18] but Lord we know that you will make a
[2:10:20] way of Escape for us Lord that we don't
[2:10:23] have to remain deformed
[2:10:25] that we can say thank you Lord for that
[2:10:28] scar thank you Lord for that wound

[2:11:26] finisher of our faith you are the one
[2:11:29] that will bring us back together with
[2:11:30] our loved ones and father I pray that
[2:11:33] this family somehow through this this
[2:11:35] tragedy father would be able to come to
[2:11:38] know you in the power of your
[2:11:39] Resurrection father that Lord if they
[2:11:42] could believe then they and their family
[2:11:43] could be saved Lord
