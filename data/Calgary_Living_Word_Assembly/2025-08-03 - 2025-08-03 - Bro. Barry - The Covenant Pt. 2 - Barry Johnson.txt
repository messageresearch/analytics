If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand. When I awake, I am still with thee. Lamentations 3:22-23 says, "It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions fail not, they are new every morning. Great is thy faithfulness." Amen.

None other has ever known. Hallelujah. Welcome to the house of the Lord this morning. If you have a need, may we just make it known unto him by way of an uplift hand. Just have a request here for Sister Mary Carpenter who had a fall. Just want to thank the Lord for healing her. Brother Jeff Paige has a cousin Bryce. He needs a touch from the Lord. He needs supernatural help. So we'll pray for him as well. Let's just bow. Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus, we just are so thankful, Lord, that as we just sang, Lord, we don't sing that as a an old denominational hymn, Father, but we sing that by revelation through the lens of your word for our day, Lord, and recognize that you truly walk with us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father. And you talk with us, Lord. What an honor and a privilege it is. as our brother prayed earlier. Oh, we could we could meet with kings and potentates and oh, we could meet with the most important people in this world. And what good would it do us, Lord? Father, it might puff up our pride, Lord Jesus. But we don't want pride. We know that your prophet said that true revelation doesn't puff men up. That it causes a real humility because we recognize that we're nothing outside of you. that outside of you and your baptism of your spirit, your life living through us, Lord. Father, we're lost as lost can be to know, Father, that you walk with us and you talk with us. Oh, Father, we're so thankful. Lord, we give you all the praise and all the glory this morning. You are so wonderful, Father. Lord Jesus, we thank you for the songs this morning. We thank you for each and every life represented here today, Lord. Father, we thank you for the needs that you've placed in our lives, Lord, because without the needs, there would be no way for us to recognize your attributes. And Father, this morning, we want to bring each need that was mentioned to you. Thank you for touching Sister Mary, Lord, for healing her, for raising her up, Lord. We thank you, Lord Jesus, that we can bring Bryce unto you, Father, unto your throne. the need that brother Jeff brought forward, Lord. Sometimes in our lives, there's only one way, Father. And we know that you will not let us go if we're yours. That you will walk with us and that you will talk with us. &gt;&gt; And you will tell us that we are yours. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we need to get flat on our backs just so we can look up. And Father, this morning we pray for Bryce, Lord, that your will would be done in his life. We pray there would be a testimony that brother Jeff could share through this situation. Father, we pray for each and every need that was made known unto you this morning, Father, by the way of an uplift hand. And Father, maybe just by a thought in a heart, Lord, we know that your word is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword. Father, dividing, oh Lord, the joints and the marrow, getting beyond this flesh, Lord Jesus, right down beyond our spirit, Lord, right to our very soul. We pray that you would discern each and every one of our hearts, Lord, this morning. That you would go from heart to heart, from seat to seat, Lord, and discern our hearts, Lord. Father, fill our cups where we need more of you. And father, we pray that you would just introduce yourself as you are the perfect gentleman to those who don't know you in the power of your resurrection. Father, we know that one way or another, we will not leave this building the same way that we came in. Oh, Father, we just love you and we thank you. We want to give you all the preeminence that you desire in this service. Lord, thank you for meeting the needs, Lord. Thank you that we can bring our needs unto you, Father. Where else would we go, Lord? We know that you asked your disciples one time when you told them to eat your flesh and drink your blood. You said, "Will you go also?" And we know that, oh, Father, by revelation, they said to you, "Unto whom would we go?" Father, we're so thankful that we could be here today. We just ask, Lord, that you would have the preeminence now in all that's said and done, in all that we think. Father, we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you everyone. Musicians, my each and everyone, what a wonderful way to start the service. &gt;&gt; Thank you musicians. If you have your Bibles, I'd like to read a couple of scriptures today. First one in Matthew chapter 24. Kind of continuing on with maybe the signs of the times. We talked about a few services back in Matthew 24, the great tribulation. Jesus talking to his disciples and explaining to them what's actually going to take place. We just have three scriptures in this that I want to read and then we'll turn over to Genesis chapter 15 and Lord willing we'll continue on with our discussion from Wednesday about the covenant, God's unfailing covenant with his people. Matthew 24 verse 10. Matthew 24 verse 10. And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another. And many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many. And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. &gt;&gt; Let's turn over to Genesis. Genesis chapter 15, start with verse 8. Genesis chapter 15:8. It's the covenant that God made with Abram before he had his name change and his body changed. Verse 8 says, "And he said, Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?" And he said unto him, "Take me a heer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtle dove, and a young pigeon." And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece, one against another, but the birds divided he not. And when the fowls came down upon the carcasses, Abram drove them away. And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and lo, and horror of great darkness fell upon him. And he said unto Abram, "Know of assurityity that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them, and they shall afflict them 400 years." Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for this word. We thank you, Lord Jesus, that we can see you in every single scripture from Genesis to Revelation. We thank you, Lord, for the revelation that we've been given through the eyes of your prophet. How you came and expounded to this age, Lord, tied up all the loose ends and gave us the complete revealing of all the mysteries. And we, Father, we just want to ask, Lord, that today you would be glorified in what we say and do now as we go forwards. We pray that you would just break this bread of life open to us fresh once again. Lord, just love you and we thank you. We ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. You may be seated. Certainly want to welcome all of our visitors here. We have uh many visitors. We have a special weekend this weekend that we've been uh hosting at our house and our barn hall. We have the the singles, the young people that are singles, but they're actually young adults. But I'm not going to try and name names because I don't think I would be able to. We uh I'll leave leave someone out and uh maybe get something mixed up, but I just thought it was interesting to do a geographical comparison. We have people from Washington, we have people from Arizona, from Quebec, from Manitoba, from Saskatchewan, and and our province here, Alberta. There's a an interesting group of individuals. We've had a wonderful weekend so far, I believe, and uh it's not over. And I think it's amazing to see what the Lord, you know, will continue to do in our midst. Um, it's not a camp that we have for those people who are wondering. It's simply a get together of like-minded individuals, a place where they maybe will fit in. Sometimes we can come to a place where we're an adult and uh we're single, so we don't fit into a family camp. It just doesn't work. there's a lot of families and family activities and then there's the youth camps and you know sometimes there's just uh seemingly cracks where people don't seem to fit where they could fall into potentially and uh we just had a burden to create an environment where people could get together and have a bit of fellowship Christian fellowship one-on-one and uh as a group we've played some wonderful games it's been really fun actually so uh that's what's going on this weekend we're certainly Certainly honored to have the Trudeau's in our midst, Brother Jean Luke and Sister Cindy. God bless you. It's good to see you again. Uh more visitors from Quebec and uh yeah, we're certainly thankful to be in the presence of the Lord. I want to thank each one for the specials today. It certainly sets an atmosphere and uh you know, I I just can't get help but get in his presence. And sorry, I have to fix this here. Bear with me. Let me turn around. You can't see me doing this when I turn around. Right. I forgot to do that in the back. Wow. Okay, here we go. So, we're certainly thankful to be here and uh it's just a wonderful time to get together and get together in the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And uh I'm certainly thankful. It's a long weekend. That was one of the requests we had if we do this uh singles weekend again that we could potentially do it on a long weekend so that people have the opportunity to travel a little better and uh maybe have a little less pressure. We can have another day. And so we tried to do that this year. And uh you know I was reminded by uh by by the deacons at the door today. It's a holiday weekend. Tomorrow's a holiday. So just take our time, not feel pressured. And uh I certainly feel that way. I know the Lord's here with us. We know that his word says where two or three are gathered in his name that he's there. Brothers and sisters, he's here. &gt;&gt; It's not a cliche. It's not a religious gathering. This is not a denominational event. This is a gathering with the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. &gt;&gt; And he is more more willing to meet our needs. A thousand times more willing to meet our needs than we are willing to accept. It is what the prophet said. And I can't help but think that that's what he said through the prophet. &gt;&gt; And I continually go to that because that's what a prophet is. A prophet is a mouthpiece. And and the mouthpiece is the microphone and the speaker of God. &gt;&gt; He uses men to speak and he always speaks through prophets. That is the plan of God. Way back to Mount Si when the people were afraid to go up on the mountain to go anywhere near the mountain. that was on fire at the top with smoke and thunder and lightning. And even Moses, the one he was calling to come up, you come up here. I want to talk to you. We know that he said he was exceedingly fearful and Yeah. So anyways, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; That's the one that we're meeting with today. It's just wonderful to know that he's here in our midst &gt;&gt; and there there ain't nothing he can't do &gt;&gt; if we can believe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If we can believe. But you know, brothers and sisters, we uh were kind of talking about a little bit this weekend and I hope it's okay. I'm just going to preach today what's the Lord's kind of put on my heart and inspiration and you know, it's a bit of what we were talking about on Wednesday. We are willing recipients of his unconditional unconditional covenant that he gave to Abram way back here in the book of Genesis. We are the recipients of that. And the only thing that happens is we come to realize that. And you know, it's important to recognize how that happens. It's why we actually come to church is so that we can truly come to meet with Jesus Christ. We're not coming to a message church to get people to meet a prophet. &gt;&gt; That is not what we're doing. The prophet taught we need to get people to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He even said, "I fear that we're only getting people to church and we're not getting people to Christ." &gt;&gt; That's right. Today I'm going to preach Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. And I trust that's what every minister in the message preaches. There's no deeper doctrine than Jesus Christ. The same yesterday, today, and forever. To take him right up out of the past and put him in the present. To take him out of the future somewhere and bring him right down to where we are today, &gt;&gt; the great I am. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And there ain't no need that we can have that we're encountering, that we're enduring, that we're going through in our life. There ain't nothing that he can't do for us. &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, I can't help but think, you know, we talked about it on Wednesday. We'll get into it a little bit. I'm probably going to say it a few times. Abraham, the Gentile, he was a Gentile when he was Abram. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He was not a Jew. Don't think he was. He was a Gentile. &gt;&gt; It's a beautiful thing to realize because he's come for the Gentiles. Now, this royal seed of Abraham is not the Jews. That's right. &gt;&gt; The royal seed of Abraham are Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Gentiles sons and daughters that he's chosen to come collectively together to be one body, which is his bride body. &gt;&gt; And we're now living in that bride age. But here we have a man who was God's man, God's prophet back in the day. And the word of God says, we know in Romans that he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief. &gt;&gt; Yeah, Lord. &gt;&gt; He was sounds like he was a perfect man. We said this on Wednesday. I'm just going to labor this a little bit. It sounds like he never staggered. He staggered. &gt;&gt; He was a backslider is what our prophet said. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; Who would say tell the king that my my wife is my beautiful wife is my sister. &gt;&gt; Because I want to save my hide because they might kill me and and take my wife. &gt;&gt; How backsliden can you get &gt;&gt; to abandon your wife like that? Can you imagine the conversation they must have had afterwards? They lived in a supernatural world. They had supernatural experiences, but they also lived in a natural world where he staggered. And I guarantee you, this one was not a pushover. She probably had some words for him. But the word says that he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief. Even though he staggered, he didn't have unbelief. What is unbelief? It's not stumbling and falling in our flesh clearly because that's what he did. &gt;&gt; Unbelief is sin. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Unbelieving. &gt;&gt; You know, I think that God can do everything else in the message that we've been brought in the day in which we live except for this one thing in my life. I just can't get over it. I just can't change it. God doesn't seem to be moving in my life the way that I think that he should be in the time frame which it should be according to my mind. We don't want to be that way. God's going to take his his own time. &gt;&gt; God's time is perfect time. That's God's perfect will. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; His timing. Abram staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief. But what was he? He was strong in faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know, I think that's probably the most important thing for us in the day in which we live, brothers and sisters. If we're going to be strong in anything, we better be strong in faith because this is the age where we need a certain type of faith. Anybody know what kind of faith we need for this age? &gt;&gt; We need rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; This is the only age that we need rapturing faith for. &gt;&gt; And we know that faith lies on the tapes. But the tapes are only good enough as we eat them, as we consume them. We've got to be willing to listen to the tapes. We've got to be willing to say what the prophet said on those tapes. We've got to be willing to apply what the prophet said to do on those tapes in our lives &gt;&gt; and not make excuses, not say, you know, I can do whatever maneuver. I can work my way. I got to work around. There's a loophole in the message. There ain't no loopholes in the word of God. There's no loopholes in the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no contradictions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For those people that don't attend here, I'm just going to say it this way. I always preach this. Get the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Get him. &gt;&gt; The spirit of truth in your life &gt;&gt; first &gt;&gt; and foremost and everything else will become plain in God's time. It might not be thunderbolts of lightning all at once. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And likely it won't be. &gt;&gt; God will say, "Okay, you're taking a step towards me now. The water's going to get contrary." Remember, he walked on the water out to the boat and the disciples were in it and it was pretty contrary. They were going to they were going to sink. &gt;&gt; But Peter, the one who was brave, what did he say? He was strong in faith, wasn't he? &gt;&gt; He said, "Master, bid me come. Bid me come unto you." So what did he say? Come. &gt;&gt; And what happened? He had that faith for a brief second, for a split moment, he he stepped out on the water. Peter walked on the water, too. &gt;&gt; He stepped out of the boat. But we know that he started to look around. Oh no, the circumstance, the situation. Look at the waves. Look at the wind. Look at the water. How deep is this water? Ah. &gt;&gt; And he had to be saved. And what did Jesus say to him? My, if you just had more faith, &gt;&gt; ye of little faith. &gt;&gt; Lord, help us not to be of little faith. We need to have a faith. Greater faith than any other age. &gt;&gt; That's the faith we need, brothers and sisters. And you know what's going to happen? I'll tell you. We're never going to live above our confession. is what God said to this age through his prophet. &gt;&gt; So if we say this ain't happening, God hasn't done this for me. I don't know if it's ever going to happen. &gt;&gt; Who are we giving glory to? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We need to be saying praise God. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, how I don't even know how many times he he says it. We probably have an Orthodox message believer in our midst here. An al ultraorththodox message theologian. someone here that would know how many times brother Brandham said Abraham, he wasn't weak in faith, but what did he do? Every time he looked down and and thought all of these people were coming at him and saying, "You're a charlatan. God doesn't speak to you. You're going to have a baby. You're an old man. Look at your wife. She's an old woman. It ain't going to happen. You're crazy." &gt;&gt; He never staggered. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; What did he do? Brother Bradom says he went home and got the booties ready. That's right. &gt;&gt; He made sure the bird eyee was there. He got the blankets. He got the the nursery. Everything was in order. Every time he started to hear that and feel that, what did he do? He acted on it in a greater way. He stepped into his confession. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, I just feel so impressed today. If we want to see God move in our lives, what are we doing about it? Are we grumbling about it, or are we giving God the glory and saying, "Hey, in my weakness, your strength is made perfect." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Therefore, I'll rejoice in my infirmities. In the position where I'm at, my station right now, I'm going to say, "Glory to God. You've got it all under control. I can't explain it or understand it, but I love you &gt;&gt; because you first love me &gt;&gt; Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Giving glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of us are strong in faith, giving glory to God when the devil's kicking us? &gt;&gt; It ain't easy. I ain't saying it it's easy. &gt;&gt; What I'm saying is, brothers and sisters, when we're sick in our bodies, give God glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we have a fight in our marriage, &gt;&gt; oh, what? Give God glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the devil. Right? &gt;&gt; Don't think for a second that God hasn't actually had a conversation about our situation. &gt;&gt; He said, "Have you considered &gt;&gt; my brother Daniel? &gt;&gt; Have you considered my son? &gt;&gt; Have you considered him?" We got two Daniels sitting together. This is good. Have you considered him though? &gt;&gt; I know that he won't shatter. He won't crumple. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in adoption, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; You can take the tutor. Oh my. Goes to the father and explains, "You know what? I took him and I I I beat him up. I threw him down. I I put his wife against him. I got his pastor mad at him. All these different things happened and he still continues to praise you. &gt;&gt; He still continues to serve you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What report is our tutor going to give to the father? &gt;&gt; And we know the tutor is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's what he says at adoption. We are adopted sons and daughters of God. Are we not? If we are, then I personally believe this myself, preaching to myself here, but as I look around, I see it also. I have to say it honestly, brothers and sisters, we're living a million times below our privilege. &gt;&gt; If we're adopted sons and daughters of God, what are we saying? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says it. We talked about it a week or so ago. Say nice things. &gt;&gt; You know, out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh, &gt;&gt; right? If we want to see devils killed, if we want to see victory over devils, say nice things. &gt;&gt; If we're not saying nice things, what's happening is we're giving devils room to move. &gt;&gt; Who wants to give the devil a day off? &gt;&gt; Who wants to give Satan a free pass? &gt;&gt; I'm going to go home and smack talk the deacons. They didn't shake my hand. that song leader, that pastor, that preacher, this, that, the other, &gt;&gt; blah, blah, blah. All we're doing is glorifying Satan. &gt;&gt; I think we need to have a testimony like Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham's testimony. &gt;&gt; Where we stagger not at the promise of God through. No, no, no, no, no. We'll stagger at the promise of our brother maybe, and our sister, but we'll still give God the glory. We'll still say, you know what? Maybe they didn't mean to say that, but I love them anyways. They're my brother. They're my sister. &gt;&gt; That's my pastor. That's my song leader. Whatever it is, we'll say, "Praise God. Give him glory &gt;&gt; and rejoice in our trials." I just love how he goes on to say this in Romans. He says, "And being fully persuaded that what he had promised, are we fully persuaded in our day, brothers and sisters, that what he promised in our lives, &gt;&gt; he's able to." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we fully persuaded? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I wonder if we are. &gt;&gt; I I just think I want to encourage us today, brothers and sisters. If you leave here today, don't think that Brother Barry gave you a spanking. Just think that Brother Barry wants to encourage us to be fully persuaded in this word for our day. &gt;&gt; We're not gathering to get together &gt;&gt; to to to magnify cuttingly devised fables &gt;&gt; of a prophet. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We're here to get to Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why that prophet came here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Was to get people to Christ. &gt;&gt; So that we could be fully adopted sons and daughters of God, knowing our position in Christ Jesus, seated already in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brad, we read it on Wednesday. He says that you're not going to. You already are. &gt;&gt; If you're a son and daughter, you already are. &gt;&gt; God bless you, Brother Jerry. I hope you're ready for that three-hour sermon today. I feel like it, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He always bugs me for a three-hour sermon. So, hold on, everyone. &gt;&gt; We've got water downstairs. We could turn the AC up a little bit. But Abraham was being fully persuaded that what he had promised, he was able also to perform. &gt;&gt; And I just want to encourage us, brothers and sisters, be fully persuaded. be fully persuaded that what he has promised you, he is also able to perform it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Whatever that need is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; I can't help but think that, you know, what what should be the most difficult thing seems to be the easiest and and what likely should be the easiest seems to be like the most difficult. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Did you ever notice that? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. The most difficult thing if you think about it, and I'm just going to say it this way, but I I fully believe it. I know we all do. If there is a life thereafter, isn't it the most difficult thing to believe that you're actually going to have salvation, that we have salvation, that God is going to catch us when we step from one dimension into the next, that death is just a buggy that's going to take us into the presence of God? &gt;&gt; The thing that's the most difficult seems to be the most easy. If we were to say, "How many people are here saved today?" Just raise your hand. And I would imagine every single hand in the room would go up. But how many people are fully persuaded that God's going to deal with that thing in your life? &gt;&gt; As many hands going to go up, &gt;&gt; are we fully persuaded that he is able? &gt;&gt; I want to try and persuade us, brothers and sisters, that he is more than able. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There ain't no need in our midst ever from birth unto death that he is not able to deliver us from or take us through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every single need. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Every single problem. The only reason we have needs and problems is so that he can express himself to us. &gt;&gt; And not just to us, but through us, to our brothers and our sisters. &gt;&gt; I've learned something a little bit just in my tiny tenure as a pastor. When you see God move in someone's life, when they take what's being preached and it applies to them in their life and they take it and they just step by faith and God does something for them and there's a testimony in a testimony service about what God has done for them, it does something supernatural for that guy &gt;&gt; to say, "Praise the Lord. Something is happening. This is this is this is the Lord moving. It's just incredible." But it's not just for us is my point, brothers and sisters. It's for the body, &gt;&gt; for our brothers and our sisters. &gt;&gt; Think about that. That women, those two women. I just can't help but think about that. Brother Bradom prayed for and nothing really happened. They were prayed for the prayer line. He said to them, "Go on, receive your healing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." One of them had a goiter. The other one couldn't stomach food. And what happened? Days went by. I think it was even weeks that went by after the services. They're there in their neighborhoods and the one woman is making a bed and she notices that that goer was gone. &gt;&gt; And what'd she do? She jumped up and started shaking the sheets. Where did the Where did it go? Where did it go? It's just gone. &gt;&gt; The other woman, she just sends the kids off to school. The husband's gone. Now she's going to care for the house and do her her job, whatever it is that she's doing. and and she sees some leftover food there from breakfast and she's like, "My something something's stimulating me. I I just feel like eating that." And what'd she do? She ate that. She could normally not eat anything because she would just get sick. And what happened? She ate more. And she ate more. And it wasn't very long before both these women went out screaming and yelling because God did something for them in their lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just beautiful. Brother Adams said the angel of the Lord went through their area on a specific day. &gt;&gt; I just want to say this, brothers and sisters, be fully persuaded and invite that angel of the Lord to come by your way. &gt;&gt; And I promise you, he will come by. &gt;&gt; He won't come the way we think. &gt;&gt; He won't come when we think he should. But just give him the opportunity to come is what I want to say. &gt;&gt; All right. I just think it's beautiful. It's amazing to see how the law Lord actually moves in our midst. You know, there's uh I just wanted to mention this. I I haven't even start haven't even started yet today. I think it's beautiful. The Lord is so good, isn't he? Amen. &gt;&gt; I just wanted to mention this uh for our local assembly that uh we do have youth services coming up to begin um September 26th at 7:30 p.m. here in the sanctuary. And I I have to mention this. I know some people might be saying, "Brother Barry, now you're breaking the spirit." I'm not breaking the spirit. He hasn't left, has he? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's still here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to make sure that I mention this. And uh sometimes when you get up here, you just get a little bit nervous. Get in the presence of God and it's very difficult to just function as a normal human being, brothers and sisters. It's just it's the way it is. But uh I I tend to get a little bit nervous sometimes. I get a little emotional. But I wanted to mention this one point. We're going to have youth services. We've talked about it. They're going to start September the 26th, 7:30 p.m. here in the sanctuary. And remember, it's open to all ages. If you want to come, that's fine. You're welcome to come. and uh even the young ones, you're welcome to come, but the only restriction is you have to be able to govern yourself. There's not going to be babysitters here. If the children can't come and sit still and have a real service, then maybe we just need to wait at home until we're just a little more mature so we can actually do that. We want to give everyone the opportunity. If you're an adult and you want to come, you're all welcome to come. It's going to be the last Friday of every month. We're going to start doing this. And uh as I mentioned, it's open to all ages. And uh I just in my note, I wrote this. You must be old enough to be reverent. And uh we'll certainly see what the Lord is going to do. What we're doing is it's going to be a youth service here in the sanctuary. And uh I I want to see that we're going to be ushering. We're going to be doing music. And we're even going to be preaching. The youth are going to be doing all of those. The parents, the deacons, the trustees, the pastor. We're not going to be doing that. I'm probably going to be encouraging a little bit. But I'll tell you, there's youth in our midst that really have a desire to preach. They've even got notes compiled. There's others that have songs to sing. Others have songs to play. And uh I'll tell you, my heart's desire with this is to encourage the youth to participate in the church. And I know that we always have the same musicians coming up and playing, but wouldn't it be wonderful if one of the musicians were able to just sub off once in a while and allow oh my a youth to go and play in the midst of a real service? How are they ever going to get the experience to do it if we don't actually give them an environment to grow and learn? So that's that's that's the driving force behind this. uh if the Lord should terry, which he could, we don't know how long it's going to be. We know there's people saying back in the 70s, you know, his coming it's near. We're not going to be able to even pay our mortgage off. We're not even going to be able to deal with our cars. Even back in the day when brother Brandham was around, we know these spirits are always around. &gt;&gt; But no man knows a day or the hour. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The prophet told us we need to hoe our potatoes like he's coming a hundred years from now. Exactly. &gt;&gt; So, we need to make sure that we are positioning the church body for future days &gt;&gt; and that the youth have a place in the church. So, we certainly want to give them the opportunity for that. And I apologize for stopping the preaching to do that. I just had to make sure that I announced it. I want to make sure we got enough time for that. So uh I just think it's beautiful uh to see the encouragement in in the youth and to see the the desire in their heart to actually participate in the services. &gt;&gt; So pray for us and uh pray for them. I'm sure the Lord will use them mightily. Okay. So speaking about our weekend a little bit too. I wanted to do this. It uh all kind of ties together. So just bear with me. I know you are and I thank you for it. the singles weekend that we've been doing is uh you know just try and encourage call out the youth, the young adults, those individuals that aren't married yet and uh just need a need an opportunity to fellowship. It's important to have fellowship with like-minded brothers and sisters, brothers and sisters of like precious faith. And you know, I would say this, if if we're going to do anything, there needs to be a scriptural basis for it. It needs to point back to the scripture. And I think it's just amazing because when we did it last year, this is the scripture that came to my heart. It's Isaiah 40:31. But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings as eagles. They shall run and not be weary. They shall walk and not faint. And we know that's a song that we sing, but I just think it's amazing to see the the individuals not giving themselves over to shortcuts to try and find spouses, not giving themselves over to situations that could lead them into what brother Brandham called hell on earth. By getting matched up with people that don't have like precious faith by holding your testimony, by waiting on the Lord, the Lord is what will renew our strength. And we know they'll mount up with wings as eagles. They shall. So I I just had that scripture last year. And I believe that's the overarching scripture for the entire thought, the entire idea is for the individuals to get together and understand that there's just an opportunity for fellowship. We're not matchmakers. We're not interested in that. We want God to do that. And you know, I I would say to anyone and to everyone, get the Holy Ghost. If you're getting together with anyone, you don't got the Holy Ghost, you are in dangerous waters. You are in very dangerous waters. Brother Random said it becomes hell on earth because you have different cultures that blend. You have different lives that come together. You've got to be on the same page. You know, well, some some things are simple. How do you how do you discipline children? Do you discipline children? Or do you have a psychology degree and say, "No, no, no, no, no, no. We just need to say, you know, junior, just don't do that. That's okay. Just take a breath. It'll be okay. We don't we don't use the rod anymore because we've got psychology." That's contrary to the word. And when you got one believer that wants to actually apply the word and you got somebody else that's married to them who claims to be a believer but doesn't want to apply the word the way the word says to apply it, you have a big problem in a marriage. And what's worse is you have children confused. The confusion of the children, man. That's why you got to get the Holy Ghost. Some people say it's weak to even preach that. But you know what? There's nothing else to preach in the day in which we live, brothers and sisters. That's what the message came for, was to restore people back to what was lost. &gt;&gt; The faith of the Pentecostal fathers is the true baptism of the Holy Ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Good word. &gt;&gt; Without the Holy Ghost, we're lost as lost can be. That's an exact quote. That's what brother Brandham says. &gt;&gt; Lost as lost can be. We can have all the church form. We can have all the message we want. We can know all the quotes and have been to all the places. What good is it &gt;&gt; if we don't love our brother? What good is it if we don't have the Holy Ghost? And I'll tell you this, if you don't love your brother, you don't have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You don't love your sister, you don't have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't love your spouse, you ain't got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Because the Holy Ghost is love. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is charity. That's overarching to the entire the entire portion about spouses. This year's scripture for the uh for the singles I took Ephesians 6 and I'm not going to go too far into it. Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might, not in our might. Put on the whole armor of God. We went through this as well. And uh you know, we started the weekend for those people who are wondering, those people might wonder about the future. We start the weekend with a scripture and and we go through and and we do a little bit of a theme. I do a little bit of an exhortation for the weekend and that's it. We don't have services all weekend long. And I I know some people have said, "Oh my, there's no way that I could ever go to that because that's not that's not spiritual enough for me." And and it just kind of made me sad to think that, you know, we live in a natural world here, brothers and sisters. We're not living in a world where we're actually, we've heard it said many times, we can be so spiritually minded that he so heavenly minded, we're no earthly good. And who would want to be that way? You know, when children see that, it turns children out to the world. &gt;&gt; Ultra orthodox message people, everything is spiritual. We've said this before. You can't even go and buy a a cucumber without having a prayer meeting. We need to be able to live in this world and we need to be able to take steps and understand that God is in control. We're not. God is in control. And we've already died out to ourselves that morning. So why do we need to, you know, you know what I'm saying? We're dealing with adults and we want to encourage them to actually just continue to be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might, &gt;&gt; not in our own. We've got uh another thing I wanted to mention here too. And I'm going to get into preaching. I hope it's okay if we just take a little bit of time today. &gt;&gt; Some people might be getting a little bit anxious and I'm sorry, but it is a long weekend after all. And what else do we have to do? We don't have two services today. If anybody I guess has uh has a meal on the go, I'm I'm sorry. But uh you know, we have one more thing coming on. I'm just going to mention this and then we'll get really going here. We have questions and answers. We've been mentioning that uh we want people to write down their questions and we'll come up with answers and uh put them in the offering box or put them in the offering bag when it goes by and we will compile them and answer them. It was mentioned when brother Emanuel was uh taking the service for me in my absence and he said he wasn't sure what was in my mind and that's what's in my mind. We just want to compile a few and then we'll actually take some time and have a service and answer them by the grace of God. We will endeavor to answer them by the word. &gt;&gt; I'm certainly uh excited about it too because we're seeing them come in now. And brother Brandham says that questions from the people actually indicate what's in the heart. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Of the body. So there's real questions. There has to be real answers. And as a body, we want to find them together. We're a family. We want to be able to stay together and find these answers according to the word of God. Okay. Matthew chapter 24. Getting into it. And I I'll try not to keep us too late for the record. I'm not going to go three hours. So don't, as brother Cadre says, don't get nervous. I won't go three hours. But uh in in Matthew chapter 24 verse 10, and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another. And many false prophets shall rise and deceive many. And I just want to throw this in there. I think it's important. You know, the word prophet in the Bible, Brother Brandham says is preacher. So don't worry about seeing a prophet, someone coming up and saying that they're prophetic. And we see it all over the place even now. And through the decades they've risen up and they still will continue to. But I don't think that we need to worry so much about them because you can usually see that there's some real promotion and real stuff going on that's just funny. But it says in here to beware, right? Many shall be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another. and many false prophets shall rise and deceive many. And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold, but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. Talking about this here, I think these two are kind of linked together. And I I think it's beautiful when we look at this how Jesus mentioned this, how he said this to his disciples that you'll be hated of all nations for my name's sake. But you know, many shall be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another. That's where I'm saying if you've got hate, it's not of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hate is of the devil. &gt;&gt; Hate is Cain's nature. It's the nature of Cain right from the very beginning. If we have any hatred in our lives, we need to actually go and have a prayer meeting. That's where we need to die out to ourselves. &gt;&gt; And many false prophets shall rise and deceive many. And and that's where I just want to say, you know, many false preachers will rise and shall deceive many. And don't don't get me wrong. We're not actually adding to or take away from the word. We don't want to do that. We just want to try and illustrate a little bit just so we can get a perspective on it. You know, out of the Amplified Bible, these verses say, "And then many will be offended and repelled and begin to distrust and desert him whom they ought to trust and obey." And you know, brothers and sisters, who is that him? It ain't the pastor. Even though it is, it ain't the teacher. Even though it is, what it comes down to is God. &gt;&gt; They're not trusting God because of these guys. But how will you know if these guys are not right? How will you know if there is a situation? The only way that you'll know is to know the word yourself. If you know the word yourself, then you won't have to be worried and have distrust or worry about deserting him whom they ought to trust and obey and will stumble and fall away and be betray one another and pursue one another with hatred. Now, we can say in this day and age, we've actually witnessed this. &gt;&gt; We've witnessed this. There's believers who actually went from believing to unbelieving, but they still claim Jesus Christ just like everyone else in the denominational world. They still claim the blood. They still claim the new birth, but they full-on reject that God sent a prophet. He sent a prophetic utterance through a Kentucky hillbilly to this generation. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; They want to have a denominational teaching. And we know that the word of God says that as a hog to a waller, &gt;&gt; a dog right back to his vomit, the same thing that they came out of, they're going right back into. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why is it? I'll say this. Because they're afraid to wait on the Lord. &gt;&gt; They're just afraid to wait on the Lord. Carrying on, it says, "And many false prophets will rise up and deceive and lead many into error. and the love of the great body of people. I love how it amplifies it here. It's not the love of many in the world, how they're just getting divorced and the unbelievers. This is ain't about unbelievers. We're talking about the church of the living God. We're talking about messagebelieving churches, sovereign bodies of the word. The love of the great body of people will grow cold because of the multiplied lawlessness and iniquity. What is iniquity? Iniquity is not doing what we know we're supposed to do &gt;&gt; and doing what we know we're not supposed to do. &gt;&gt; And I want to say this, brothers and sisters. I'm not just preaching to you. I'm preaching to me. &gt;&gt; I know when I shouldn't be doing something and sometimes I still do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's Romans chapter 7. But you know, as we go forwards and we stagger, not at the promise of God through unbelief, even though we stagger, let's not stagger at that promise of God through unbelief, but let's be strong &gt;&gt; in our faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And our confession &gt;&gt; and believe that he will be able to deliver us. He who endures to the end will be saved. &gt;&gt; This is a marathon we're running. We're not running a a sprinting race. This is a marathon. You got to be careful. You need to make sure that you're you're pacing yourself correctly, that you're you're you're looking to the end. You're not just looking to tomorrow and the next day and the next week. This is a a marathon, you know, just the word prophets out of the out of the concordance. Uh a superior prophet says, i.e. pretended for teller or religious impostor. A religious impostor. Can you believe that? A false prophet. That's what the false prophet is. And and I think it's just a an amazing thing because we can we can look around and we can say that we've actually witnessed it. We've seen it. And uh you know, we pray for those people. We don't want to condemn them. We don't we don't want to judge anybody that we don't be judged ourselves. But you know, this morning I want to talk about not so much in in Matthew chapter 24. I I just want to say that there's a reason why all of this shall happen. Many shall be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another. And you know what? Whether you hate someone a little bit or hate someone a lot, guess what? &gt;&gt; You still hate them, &gt;&gt; right? There's still that thing there. That hatred is still there. And and I I'm talking from experience, brothers and sisters. We can think that we're we're all good, but we still have this thing that keeps coming up about that person. That thing that just keeps coming up about that person. You have to say, "Lord, deliver me from this flesh." &gt;&gt; Turn over the page. Go from Romans chapter 7 over to Romans chapter 8. Right? Knowing that this flesh is corrupt. This flesh will not inherit incorruption. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Heading over to our covenant with Abraham. I think I just want to dwell here for a little bit. This is God's covenant with Abraham and it was for a generation. We know that if you just go back in in in Genesis 15 verse 5, God brought him forth. It says, "And he brought him forth abroad and said, look now toward heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them." And he said unto him, "So shall thy seed be." There's no way that there would be that many people in in in the in the nation of Israel. So, it has to be it has to be another group of people. I think it's just amazing to look at this, but that's how much seed there would be. And verse six says, "And he believed in the Lord, and he counted it to him for righteousness." &gt;&gt; Now, brothers and sisters, we have got to believe in the Lord for him to count it to us for righteousness. &gt;&gt; If we say we believe the Lord with our lips, but excuse me, we're very far away in our hearts. Do we believe the Lord? We've got to take this heart and cause it to believe. And how can that happen? Humanly speaking, we'll never be able to do it. And that's why people say, "I just can't live it." And walk away because you never can. We can never change our heart. He has to change our heart. He has to take out this stony heart of flesh and replace it &gt;&gt; with a brand new heart. &gt;&gt; I love how Brother Bradom says it. You know, before we can get the baptism of the Holy Ghost, he has to give us a new spirit. And don't think for a second that new spirit is truly the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; That's where people get in treacherous ground. They think, "I got a new spirit. Glory to God. I've got the Holy Ghost. Look at me. I'm a good person. I go to church. I pay my tithe. I I dress right. I act right. I talk. Everything in my life is right except for that one thing." You know what? We still need to keep pressing on because there's another measure of the exact same grace. It's not another step of grace. It's the exact same grace that we've already experienced. And I think it's just beautiful. We have got to be willing to believe in the Lord and count it to him for our righteousness. &gt;&gt; And what's beautiful is he is our righteousness. &gt;&gt; We don't have any righteousness. It's him living out through us. His word in us that causes that righteousness to be good. Are we okay still? We're okay for time &gt;&gt; because I feel like I'm really just getting started. I'm I'm not going to lie to you here. I I just think it's amazing when we look at this scripture in Genesis 15. We started with verse 9. And he said,"Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?" And he said unto him, "Take me a heer of three years old, and a sheaggo of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtle dove, and a young pigeon." He went to God with this need, with this desire. How many times do we do it, brothers and sisters? Go to God with a need and a desire. I think it's so important for us to be able to do that. We are able, but are we willing? And and when we have that need and that desire, do we do that with that need or the desire? Or do we say, "No, I've got something else. I've got another way. Someone taught me some other thing. I'm just going to do it that way or or that how." We don't want to do that. We want to make sure that we believe in the Lord and count it to him for righteousness. &gt;&gt; But here he had a question. And I think verse seven is is beautiful. And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of and of the Chaldes to give thee this land to inherit it. That's why, brothers and sisters, when we talk about the land of inheritance. In that day, it was a geographical location. In this day, it is not a geographical location. Going to Jeffersonville ain't going to save you. &gt;&gt; Going to another church ain't going to save you. Although you could get fed maybe a little better and I wouldn't doubt it because I know who I am. I I'm not a great teacher. But I do know this brothers and sisters, it don't no matter matter where you go. You've got to get the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; If you don't get the Holy Ghost, you're going to miss the blessing of God. No matter where it is you go, &gt;&gt; no matter what it is you do, &gt;&gt; it's not going to actually work. But when you do get that baptism of the Holy Ghost, you do go into that inheritance for our day. That's the inheritance for us in our day. We preached on the book of Joshua how it parallels Ephesians. We're now seated in heavenly places. We're predestinated to be for ordained of God to be holy and without blame before him in love. But we got to march forward. How do we do that? The only way is to get the Holy Ghost in our lives. That is our promised land. If we want that inheritance, it's the same inheritance that he's talking to Abraham about here, but it is another actual meaning. It's a compound meaning and a compound revelation to the same scripture here. But you know, if we've never had an opportunity in our life where we've had the Holy Ghost, you might be wondering why, brother Barry, you're going on like this. We have got to be able to have an experience with God. Amen. &gt;&gt; If we don't know it, how can God say, "Do you remember that time back there then when I took you out of the land of the Chaldanss? I took you out of the land of I told you to leave all of your family's traditions. I told you to leave all of your family's teachings and get all the way into Christ Jesus for yourself. Do you remember when you did that back there? And how the word began to expound to you in mighty ways like you had never imagined? If you've never experienced that, brothers and sisters, how can you ever step into that place? How can you ever have that conversation with the Lord? He wants to be able to tell us, "I am the Lord that brought thee out of whatever it is that we were into." &gt;&gt; And many times what we're into is things that we think are okay. &gt;&gt; But you know what? They're not necessarily &gt;&gt; because I I'm so thankful. I had a pastor that taught me, he taught us, those people that were around when he was here, he said, 'Make make a list of 10 things that you believe. &gt;&gt; Write them out and then take each one of those numbered number one to 10, right back to the word of God and make sure that you can draw a connection to those beliefs right back to the word of God. And if you can't do that, then what you're doing is believing something that was taught &gt;&gt; by a man. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And remember Jesus said they're teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't think that we're exclusive in the message. That that ain't going to happen. The devil is going to come right in the midst of the message church and try and bring some sort of wacky thing that will cause us to just go a little bit off and we'll believe that we're all right. &gt;&gt; But we have to have the Holy Ghost in our lives, brothers and sisters. That's the only way we're ever going to know the difference. That's the only way we're ever going to know if there's a false prophet or a false teaching is to have the Holy Ghost in our life. &gt;&gt; We can know all the books, know all the tapes, been all the places, have all the memorabilia. It ain't going to do us a bit of good. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because the devil's more religious than that. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?" This is where it gets good. This is where I think it really starts to become encouraging because we know that he believed in the Lord and the Lord counted it unto him for righteousness because he was a believer. He came to church. He was justified and sanctified. We know that he he he came and and did everything that he should do. He was a good man. He separated himself from his family. Remember God told him, "I want you to leave your family alone. Leave all that you know and come into a different land. Come into another place where you don't know the people. where the people don't know you, where it's uncomfortable. That's where God wants to get us is into a position where we're uncomfortable. And that's why, brothers and sisters, the trials come our way. But we're supposed to count those trials with with greater than gold. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're supposed to rejoice in the midst of those trials because that's God dealing with us. That that we've talked about this, Brother Don. That's his grace to us, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Those trials, those fiery trials are God's grace to us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. We were talking about it on the weekend. Many people, they don't struggle. Why don't they struggle? Because the devil's already got them. &gt;&gt; My They got money. They got health. They got health and wealth. You see it all the time. They've got the means. They're happy seemingly, right? But they don't have this. They don't have what we have. And that's why I say it's amazing that we could look at the thing that's probably the most difficult to comprehend the promise that we can't even really begin to explain our salvation and we all believe it. But when it comes to that need in our lives right now, do we believe that he is able to do it for us &gt;&gt; just like he's able to do salvation for us? &gt;&gt; That's right. my we know that Abraham said to him and Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it and I just want to encourage us brothers and sisters ask God this question don't be bashful take that question if you have a question if you have a need in your life ask him that question how will I know that I will inherit this in my life for me this is personal Now it's not about anybody else. This is just about me. &gt;&gt; God said unto him, we know, take a heer of three years old and a she goat of three years old and a ram of three years old and a turtle dove and a young pigeon. God gave him the instructions. And what did he do? He followed them. God will give us instructions if we ask him. If he gives us instructions, are we willing to follow them? I say, "Lord, help me." I know he's given me instructions in my life and I think Lord that's just a little too hard. Oh man, you're I think you're asking a little bit too much. In fact, I think the scripture actually gives me a workound. There ain't no workaround with the leadership of the Holy Ghost, brothers and sisters. Because I'll tell you what, if God is actually leading us, he is always going to lead us exactly according to his word. The leadership that we get in our heart is going to take us right back to the word of God. We're going to be able to find it in the word of God. When people say, "I'm led." Are you led? Who are you being led by? You being led by Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever. Or are you being led by an unholy religious spirit? Because an unholy religious spirit is going to have the workaround in the word. The Holy Ghost is going to take us right back to the word. Then we're going to be able to say, "Thank you, Father." Just like Brother Bradom says in the message, "Thank you, Daddy. I know that it's you leading me because it goes right back to your word." &gt;&gt; But when we ask with sincerity, are we ready for the answer? That's the problem. That's the question. &gt;&gt; He asked God. God gave him the answer. He said, "Do this." So he did it. Verse 10. And he took unto him all these. Sounds really simple the way we're we're talking about this, but I trust we're getting somewhere with it. And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another, but the birds divided he not. And we know that later on in the in the book of Deuteronomy or Leviticus, there is an old Old Testament description in the law of what to do with the birds. And it goes into the speckled bird. We're not going to get too far into that, but he divided the birds not. And and it's an interesting thing I just wanted to make mention of. Verse 11 says, "And when the fowls came down upon the carcasses, Abram drove them away. When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and lo and horror of a great darkness fell upon him. And he said unto Abram, "Know of assurityity that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them." I just can't help but think, brothers and sisters, as we are, the royal seed of Abraham, here we are in a land that's not our home. We're just passing through. We're just pilgrims in this land. Don't get too comfortable here. We heard brother Mano Freezen say it last weekend. No matter what happens, we cannot stay here. &gt;&gt; Don't try and get comfortable here. We got to go. &gt;&gt; We got a date with destiny and it's going on to that city. We've got an inheritance that he's given us. But here, I want to talk about this for a little bit just for time sake. I'll try and be quick. Verse 10. And he took all these and he divided them in the midst and he laid each piece one against the other. And the birds divided he not. And we talked about this on Wednesday, how important it is to remember what brother Brandham said about the Chinese laundry and how they couldn't understand English. And and what happened was they would actually write down in Chinese maybe a a suit and pants and a shirt and what they would do is take the tag and they would tear the tag and they would give one to the customer and the guy who was operating the cleaners would keep the tag with the clothes and the only way you got those clothes back was to bring the other half of that tag. And if you didn't have it, there was no way you were going to get it. And here, Brother Bradom, he talks about this in the message. I'm not going to bring a quote on it, but just for time sake, I'm going to talk about it. I think I just want to preach a little bit of my heart. It's it's important for us to recognize how this applies to us in our life. We can ask God for an answer and he'll give us the direction, but are we willing to apply that direction to our lives? I say, "Lord, help me. Help me apply the direction when you give it to me." Amen. &gt;&gt; But it doesn't say there's a time frame here, brothers and sisters. And this is what I want to get to in this scripture here. He took him all these, divided them in the midst, and laid each piece, one against the other. And we know, brother Bradom, he talks about that as being like the Chinese laundry. He took half of the the ram here and half of the ram there. He divided them and set them down and laid them out. He followed the instruction of the Lord until when they went up into the the upper room at Pentecost. What was their instruction? Go ye into Jerusalem and tar there. &gt;&gt; Until not for 2 days, not for 5 days, not for 15 days and 20 seconds. No, no. Until &gt;&gt; the time appointed of the father. If we have a need in our life, I want to say this, brothers and sisters. Read this scripture here. Think about it. We can ask the Lord with all sincerity. He'll remind us that I'm the one that brought you out. I'm the one that brought you out of what you were into. I'm the one that delivered you into a promised land. I gave you the ability to get the Holy Ghost in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I've got an instruction for you. Are you willing to follow it? &gt;&gt; My goodness. If we're not willing to follow it, I think it'd be better for us to not even ask, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; And I say, "Lord, help me cuz I know I've asked and I've been given instruction." It's not easy being a human that believes because why? Because the spirit is emnity against this flesh. This flesh is emnity against the spirit. Both of them are waring one with the other. &gt;&gt; We know that's Romans chapter 7. But don't stay there. Like I say, turn the page. &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 8. There is therefore now no condemnation to those who what? &gt;&gt; Christ. &gt;&gt; Who are in Christ Jesus who what? Who walk not after the flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But after the spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Get after the spirit, brothers and sisters. Ask him for an answer and he'll give you one &gt;&gt; and are we willing to follow it? &gt;&gt; I think it's beautiful. He followed the instructions. He separated all the carcasses and he laid them there. And you know it was until we don't have a time frame. We don't know how long. Many times in our life we can do that. We can follow the instructions of the Lord. We can do everything. We can ask him. He can remind us. We can say amen to the word and go through all the steps and get to the place where now we've laid everything out. But you know what happens? Says it in the scripture here. When the birds started coming, Abram got up and had to shoe away the birds. Don't think for a second that when we get our sacrifice laid out before the Lord, brothers and sisters, the devils ain't going to come around &gt;&gt; and try and get at our sacrifice and try and corrupt our sacrifice and try and get us to not believe. That's when it's going to happen. In that moment while we're waiting for the promise of God to come by. &gt;&gt; That's when the devil's going to come around. The fowls of the air are going to come and try and eat our sacrifice. Don't let the devil eat your lunch. Brothers and sisters, get up and shoe those devils away. We know that we can't stop them from coming, but we can stop them from feeding. We can stop them from roosting. And I love how we hear brother Brandham say, it's just like the Old Testament and the New Testament together. It's a double barrel shotgun. Give those fowls of the air a dose of lead poisoning. Send them on their way in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And you know, it doesn't have to be shouting. It doesn't have to be stomping. You can just simply speak the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think it's amazing when we talk about Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He never got mad very often, did he? &gt;&gt; The only thing that really got him riled was those religious ones. &gt;&gt; Those ultraorththodox ones that were turning his father's house into a den of thieves. That got him a little upset. &gt;&gt; But you know, for the rest of the time, simply told devils, just come out of her. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know what, centurion type of the gentile bride, just go your way &gt;&gt; because your faith hath made him whole. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just because you asked, go your way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your servants find. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All of the types, we know it. Getting back to our scripture here, we got to be willing to just take the time. And what time is it? Why? The devil wants to get us impatient. We live in a world of impatience. &gt;&gt; There's so much impatience and anxiety, agitation because we want something done a certain way, certain time frame. Oh, it's got to be. It's got to be. What does it got to be? This is the word of God. It's going to be his way, his time according to his word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And if we're willing to take him at his word, that simply watch the blessing of God come into our life. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, if Abraham tried to do a work around here and say, you know, I'm just going to do something else. What would have happened if he would have said, "No, I'm not going to actually take a a goat or a shem. I'm just going to substitute it with another animal. I'm just Right." You can imagine. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There came a time after the waiting. Verse 17. And it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that what? It passed between those pieces. I just want to say this today, brothers and sisters, as as I draw it to a close because I don't want to keep us here too long. But think about this. Once we get our sacrifice in order, laid out before him, our questions, the instructions that he's given us, and we have actually applied them. Again, I'm saying, Lord, help me. I'm the same as every one of us here. The inspiration comes and you can only preach it and you have to either say amen to it or reject it. And I just want to say amen to it all the way along. But I know it applies to me, too. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying I'm not not I'm exclusive. I'm not exclusive. He we ask we ask him let's not ask a miss like the book of James so that we can ask things upon our flesh upon our lusts let's ask things according to the word of God according to the spirit let's walk not after the flesh &gt;&gt; and what our desires are but it came to pass that when the sun went down and when it was dark my just can't help but think you know sometimes it gets pretty dark in our lives doesn't Feels like the sun's gone down on us. Feels like the Lord's not even there. &gt;&gt; But it's right then, brothers and sisters, that that pillar of fire is going to come and it's going to manifest. It's going to walk in between every one of our sacrifices. He's going to come and check out every single room in our house. And like brother Brandham preached that message, doors in door. Is there any room for Abram to have any reservation in what he believes in a situation like that? There's no room. Amen. &gt;&gt; No room at all. How would we ever want to have a room in our lives that's locked up with those little secrets, those things that that maybe someone has hurt us, maybe someone has done us wrong, maybe someone hurt our parents, maybe someone hurt them or did them wrong, maybe our brother, maybe our s whatever it is in this life, that thing that we just can't let go of, why would we want to hold on to it? &gt;&gt; Lay it down. Amen. &gt;&gt; That thing is going to take you and hold you back from seeing that pillar of fire come down upon your sacrifice. &gt;&gt; In fact, what that thing is, I'll tell you what it is. It is one of those fowls of the air that's come down and actually said, "I'm going to make my nest right here. I'm going to roost right here. &gt;&gt; It's a squatter. It's got no rights to be in your tree. &gt;&gt; Shoot it out of there. Get rid of it." You know, brother Brandom talks about this what this was the smoking furnace in the in the vision of Abram. And while he was going through this dream, it was actually the the manifestation of Calvary. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Of the spirit of God coming down upon his sacrifice and saying, "This is my beloved son. Hear ye him." And we know the first order of business after that flesh was torn, after the separation of body, soul, and spirit. His first order of business wasn't to go down into hell to release the captives or go up to heaven to receive praise. It was to go right into the most religious place and rip that veil and say, "For you to stay out any longer now means death." Once upon a time, it meant you're dying to go past that veil, to go into the Holy of Holies. But nowadays, brothers and sisters, since Calvary, since this smoking furnace that brother Brandham brings out, Calvary, it means death to stay out of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace and a burning lamp passed between those pieces, in the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, "Unto thy seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt, the river the great river, the river Euphrates." Now, I want to say this, I say it at home here all the time for those people who are visitors. Every time we hear the knights, the Annites or whatever they are, just picture them as devils. &gt;&gt; They're just enemies in the land. And God's going to deal with every single one of them. But we can't look at them and get scared. We can't allow them to rattle our faith. We've got to be strong in faith, giving glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. and the Kennites and the Kennesites and the Komites and the Hittites and the Perizzites and the Raf Raffilms and the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Gegosites and the Jebusites. Every one of them, every single one of them who are inhabitants of the land. They built the houses. They did the gardens. They probably kept the bees and had the hives. They had the cows with the milk. They did the pomegranates. They did the figs. They they were vineyard dressers. They had the the vines that that it took two men to carry the bunch of grapes from. All of those were the children of Israel's possession &gt;&gt; that they were sent to create. &gt;&gt; Don't think for a second that God doesn't know exactly where we are &gt;&gt; and exactly what we're going through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's going to bring it to pass according to his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is his time. &gt;&gt; And we've got to be willing to just wait. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when the devils come around and try and land as fowls on our sacrifice, don't let them. Even if you let them land, brothers and sisters, I can't help but think, you're going to have to go and clean that poop off your sacrifice &gt;&gt; if you let them land. Don't let them land. &gt;&gt; You don't have to scare them away before they even land. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, that might sound really kind of silly and funny to say it, but you know what happens? It's a thought that comes into our mind. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's the fowl coming down on the sacrifice. Let's just break it right down. Now, in the last few minutes, the thoughts come, brothers and sisters. We can't stop them. But they're not our thoughts. Satan's going to say, "They're your thoughts. You thought of that. No, I never. You brought it to me." &gt;&gt; And I can't help but think even in the midst of a a church service where the the spirit of the living God wants to minister to needs. The devil will come around and plant strange thoughts in your head that are totally contrary to the word. Get out the double barrel shotgun of the Old and New Testament and put that devil to run. &gt;&gt; You don't have to tolerate it. send him on his way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same day, the same day that he made that sacrifice to the Lord, the Lord came and made a covenant with him. I just want to tell you, brothers and sisters, if you've never experienced it in your life where you can say that that he can come back to me and say that I am the Lord that brought thee out of whatever it was that you're in. If you don't know that, he wants you to know that. Don't think he doesn't want you to know that. For for there to be a thought in your head that he doesn't want you to know that is a lie of the devil. &gt;&gt; He wants you to know that. He wants you to know him as your God. He wants us to know him as a deliverer. He wants us to know him as a savior. He wants us to know him as a redeemer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wants us to know him in all of his attributes. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We've got to be willing to follow his instruction. And I'll call the musicians up because I don't want to keep us too long. But I just want to encourage us that, you know, if we're the royal seed of Abraham, there's a promise for us. &gt;&gt; And that promise is greater than any one of the circumstances in our lives. And I just can't help but think of summarizing it this way. You know, just like Abraham, he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief. And you know, brothers and sisters, that might sound like a really weak statement because many times the world is set up in such a way that there's the the prosperity gospel. We've got to be able to see a return on our investment. I tithed all these years. I mean, shouldn't there be something a little more deep given to me from the pulpit or whatever it is? We we invested in the church. We did all this stuff and and look at what's coming back to us. There should be a return on our investment. as the royal seed of Abraham. There's no greater return on the investment, brothers and sisters, than being able to stagger not at the promise of God through unbelief because we're all going to stagger. Don't look at the flesh, though. When we start to look at what we've done and and who we are and all of that, it's it's the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look to Jesus Christ, brothers and sisters. Just take a and look away to Jesus Christ and see if he won't actually change that stony heart and turn it into a heart of flesh once again. &gt;&gt; Amen. you know, maybe stand with us as we as we close here. I've just got one little tiny quote that I'm going to read. It's out of modern events are made clear by prophecy. The brothers know that I sent quotes. I haven't read any of them and I'm not going to except for the one that I didn't send them. So, here we go. Just for the sake of uh discussion, this is out of the royal the the sorry, the modern events are made clear by by prophecy. He says, "Now we are supposed to be the royal seed of Abraham. Isaac was the natural seed. But the faith seed, the faith in the promised word, remember this is 1965, the end of this prophetic utterance just before he went off the air, 1965. But the faith seed, the faith in the promised word, the promised word, he says, don't miss it, was that royal seed. That was the seed, Abraham's faith. We being dead in Christ, we are Abraham's seed, hes with him according to the promise. Don't look for worldly blessings. &gt;&gt; He's going to meet all of our needs according to his riches in Christ Jesus. We know he's got all the money. All the money is his. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All this world is his &gt;&gt; all of it. &gt;&gt; But we're not here looking for this world, are we? &gt;&gt; This world has to perish. &gt;&gt; This world has to be renovated. But once it's renovated, then we step into it. Then it becomes ours. It's a wonderful thing. Remember the faith in the promised word. That is the thing we should be looking for. His faith living out through us. The only way that happens is through his life living out through us. The only way that happens is for the true baptism of the Holy Ghost. The only way that happens is for us to fully surrender unto him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God, richly bless you all as we bow our heads for prayer. Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus, we thank you for your word, thank you for each and every life represented here today, Lord, that we can take of our time and our resources and gather together in your name. Father, we we just ask that Lord, many times we can follow your instructions. We can ask you and follow your instructions. And Lord, it seems like in our perception that the time is ticking. it's going by and you're not answering us the way that maybe your word promises you would. Not even the way that we desire. But Father, help us to have your patience. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Help us to run this race &gt;&gt; with patience, Lord. Help us to know that you are completely in control. And Father, we'll be careful to give you the praise when that when that comes to pass in our lives. Help us in the meantime, Lord Jesus, to shoe away those devils when they come around, the fowls of the air that want to actually mess up our sacrifice for you, Lord. They want to mess up our our actions that we've taken towards your instruction in our lives. Help us, Lord Jesus. We ask that you would lead us and guide us according to your word now. And Father, as we go our separate ways, we pray the fellowship wouldn't stop, Lord. That we would continue to fellowship around you. that you would be the central theme of all that we think, say, and do. Lord Jesus, be with those who are traveling away this weekend. Father, I just can't help but think about all those who are maybe tuning in streaming right now. We know you're not bound by time or space. Oh, Father, you could be down in the in the Cinney. Lord, you could be Oh, Father, up at Pine Lake, Father, there's nowhere that you can't be. You're not bound by time or space. Bless all of our brothers and sisters of like Precious Faith who are traveling. Lord, thank you for bringing Sister Ne and brother Logan home safely from their honeymoon. Lord, for blessing their marriage. Father, Lord, you are so wonderful. We just love you and we thank you, Lord. We pray that Lord, you would just be glorified now with a couple songs before we separate and go our separate ways. That Lord Jesus, maybe tomorrow when we wake up, we would wake up with a song in our heart, Lord, and a spring in our step to know that you speak to us. And when you do, we follow you, Lord Jesus. And because of that, you bless us according to your word that we have that faith, Lord Jesus, that will one day change our bodies. We love you, Father, and we thank you. We just commit all of our lives into your hands now for your care. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hope it's okay.
