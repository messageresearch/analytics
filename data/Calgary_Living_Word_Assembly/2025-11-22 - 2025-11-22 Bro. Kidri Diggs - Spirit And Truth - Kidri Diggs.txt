When we raise our hands, you know the way a baby raises their hands, a baby that doesn't raise their hands, you're you're not able to carry that baby, right? We raise our hands to God just like as a baby raises their hands to their parents &gt;&gt; to reach out for help, to reach out for comfort. &gt;&gt; Father, &gt;&gt; that's why we're raising our hands. So God, meet my needs. I believe that's your prayer. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our hearts before him. Our dear Lord and King, our master and Savior, you mean everything to us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.

Knock and the door shall be open. &gt;&gt; And Lord, you told us to ask that our joys may be full. &gt;&gt; Lord, that's your word and we stand on your word tonight. &gt;&gt; Lord, bless each and every heart here, Lord.

Again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's good to be in Calgary again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We thank God for the mercy he's given us to come this way. Amen. And you know, it's in season because it's getting cold. [laughter] Hallelujah. You know, but we certainly appreciate you all. We certainly appreciate brother Barry. Amen. His precious brother. appreciate him. Amen. Amen. How many love the Lord tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I I really [music] trust and believe that the service is ordained of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So many things that have taken place already that's just confirmed things to me. Even with the opening song, the opening song was the last song s song song in the last service I was in. and and that's just something personal for me. So I just know truly believe that God is doing something &gt;&gt; in our midst. So let's let him have our expectation &gt;&gt; and let's take this beyond just a Saturday night &gt;&gt; and it's a gathering with God and his people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you have your Bibles, Amen. Let's turn to um St. John chapter 16. St. John chapter 16. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; St. John 16 and um let's start reading at uh just to make the reading short. Let's let's start at verse 12. If you have say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; St. John 16:12, the Bible says, "I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. How be it, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come. He will guide you into all truth. For he shall not speak of himself, but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak, and he will show you things to come. He shall glorify me, for he shall receive of mine, and shall show and shall show it unto you. All things that the Father hath are mine. Therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall show it unto you. A little while ye shall not see me, and again a little while ye shall see me, because I go to the Father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You can have your seats as you're sitting. Let's turn over to um St. John chapter 8. St. John chapter 8 and I think I want to read at start reading at verse 29 I think. Let me see. Let's start at verse 30. St. John 8 and verse 30. The Bible says, "As he spake these words, many believe on him. Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, "If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed, and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." [snorts] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May the Lord add a blessing to his word. Amen. Tonight, by the grace of God, I want to use for a subject, spirit and truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Spirit and truth. What a combination. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When it comes to the Lord, you know, and that trickles down to his bride, spirit, and truth. But we we we got some things we want to examine tonight. Uh when we look right here in the Bible, the Bible says, "How be it when the spirit of truth cometh." Hallelujah. Now, we know that when we look at this right here, we want to find out what kind of spirit he's talking about. Now, yeah, we say Holy Spirit. Amen. But when we look at this church, spirit is not something just out there in the air. &gt;&gt; Spirit is something that's real. &gt;&gt; You say, "But brother D, what you talking about?" The Bible says that God is a what? &gt;&gt; Spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; So for us to have any kind of spirit here tonight, we want God's spirit. &gt;&gt; Because behind everything, there is a spirit. &gt;&gt; Behind your worship tonight, there was a spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What kind of spirit? &gt;&gt; That's the question we want to answer. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, as you s songs, as you worship or whatever, there was a spirit behind it. &gt;&gt; Now, we're believing and trusting that God is is is in our midst. that God is the spirit behind us. But then he says when the spirit of uh truth is come, listen, that spirit is [screaming] a person. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you with me, church? &gt;&gt; So if there's a spirit in here tonight, it has to be a person. &gt;&gt; There's only two spirits that can be in this room. Hallelujah. All of us are housing one of them. It's either the spirit of God or the spirit of the enemy. Now I want to believe that the spirit of God is behind me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he says hallelujah. Now, now when we dealing with his spirit, he says his spirit uh uh of truth is to come. He will guide you into all truth. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; First thing about the right kind of spirit, it'll give you truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, a lot of people say that they got truth. We can identify that by the kind of spirit that's in their life. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A lot of people say, "I love God. I believe in God." But what kind of spirit is behind that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some people say they love God and they still doing all kind of things in the world. That ain't the right kind of spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And a lot of times we may see things in church and people want to do things in church, but what's behind that spirit? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said that spirit will guide us into what? All truth. Not partial. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not just being able to speak in tongues. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church? &gt;&gt; Oh, there we go. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not just being able to speak in tongues or just being able to come to church or pay tithe. Everybody can do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the spirit behind it is supposed to be what? Speaking of he. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He says when he, [clears throat and snorts] the spirit of truth will come, it will guide us into all things. &gt;&gt; All things, good things, true things. Amen. Hallelujah. So, how do you know you got the right spirit? Truth. &gt;&gt; How do you know you got truth? It'll reveal the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The right spirit. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; Now listen. He says, "For he shall not speak of himself." Now, I want you to examine me tonight as I preach to see if I got the right spirit or not. &gt;&gt; Because first of all, for any man of God to get back here behind the pull pit, he's not supposed to be uplifting himself. &gt;&gt; He's not supposed to be speaking of himself, but he shall not speak of himself. Hallelujah. So, what does the right kind of spirit will do? It'll always bring us back to who? God. &gt;&gt; That's how you know you're in the right church. That's how you know the right spirit is there. Because the ministry will always bring you back to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; If it's the right spirit, it won't speak of you. Hallelujah. If you're singing a special, [screaming] it won't exalt you. It'll exalt God. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, the right spirit will always speak of who? Him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I just love how the Bible gives us all the answers. &gt;&gt; How do we know Brother Brandon was a divine prophet? Cuz he didn't speak of himself. &gt;&gt; He always spoke of who? Him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ. &gt;&gt; Always bought the church. you and I back to Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I haven't found one time in my own personal studies where the prophet wanted me to follow him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I got at least one amen. Praise the Lord. And that came from the pastor. So I know he preaching it to you. Everybody else might be, &gt;&gt; who are you following? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're following Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was following who? Him. &gt;&gt; He said, "Hey, if if if it's the right spirit, it will always bring you back to him." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not the man, but the spirit. What spirit? The spirit of God. &gt;&gt; God is a spirit. &gt;&gt; So, our worship should bring us back to God. &gt;&gt; Our life should bring us back to God. Our prayer should bring us back to God. Everything we do under [screaming] the spirit should demonstrate who we serve. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Woo. I feel good tonight. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Listen, let's keep reading. He says, "But whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak, &gt;&gt; and he will show you things to come." Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, just to for our own benefit to say that we're in truth, our message, hallelujah, which is the Bible revealed, speaks of what? Truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How do we know it's truth? Because it's showing us prophecy fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look around. US, Canada, wherever you go, prophecy, the Bible is being revealed for the Bible's being fulfilled. That means we have truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at the state of the world. Look at the Gentiles cup of iniquity. It's full. The Bible tells us of that. We know that we are in truth. How? Because we got the right interpretation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not in a day where well, you know, they ask ministers questions and I've seen this. They've asked ministers questions say, "What do you think about homosexuality?" Well, it's not God's best. &gt;&gt; Huh? It's not God's best. God ain't got nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, we're not H. We don't have a gospel that will compromise with truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why you see people leave. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church? &gt;&gt; But listen. I'm going to go back. He said the spirit of truth, he the spirit of truth is to come. He will guide you into all truth. He shall not speak of himself &gt;&gt; over and over again. The right spirit never speaks of the individual. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'll go back. I'm I'm going kind of be repetitive. Holy. How do you know you're in the right worship service? The worshipper is not leading you to his own glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's leading you to something greater. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A real worshiper, you won't see him. Hallelujah. All or him or her. Although you will enjoy the gift, but the gift brings you back to who? The giftgiver. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Yeah. I love to see somebody that can really sing. Hallelujah. But under that anointing, under the right spirit, it makes me to crave more of him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. You see sometimes you can see people Hallelujah uh that can really really I mean really anointed really got a powerful voice but you get nothing out of it. &gt;&gt; Why the spirit behind it. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz the spirit is exalting them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me church? &gt;&gt; Okay. Now God is a spirit. Hallelujah. And for us to to to get anything out of him, we must tap into that same self-same spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Bible says if that spirit that raised up Christ from the dead &gt;&gt; does what? Dwell in you. Oh, so it's possible. &gt;&gt; It's possible for us to have the same spirit that raised up Christ from the dead. Amen. &gt;&gt; So church shouldn't be a maybe or if if God was here or maybe God understand. No church, we have access access to the self same spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That created the [screaming] world. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; amen. It's too often we just, you know, we look at the spirit as just a a a good worship service. &gt;&gt; No, the spirit is a person. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that person is here right now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And look what I love about it, church, what God has done, he's allowed us to have interaction with his selfsame being. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not something different. Hallelujah. Now, I'm going to get into a little bit of of things that are more direct cuz right now I'm talking about the spirit. And you can say anything is the spirit, but we going to make it direct. Hallelujah. Look, we crave the same. Look. Oh my. That one just came. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This spirit I'm talking about is the same spirit. [screaming] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That walked up on 12 legions of demons. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And those demons recognized the spirit that was [screaming] behind that little frail body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They weren't worried about Hallelujah. how big the body was, how strong it was, how masculine. They saw a spirit behind it &gt;&gt; and they said, "Hey, we know who thou are." [laughter] So it don't matter your makeup. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It don't matter what house you come out of. If you got the spirit of God in you, it'll do the same thing he did. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Demons saw that spirit and they feared and trembled. &gt;&gt; That's what we have access to. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. legions of demons. They were tormenting everybody. But when they saw Christ, &gt;&gt; not his flesh, &gt;&gt; his spirit. &gt;&gt; When they saw his spirit, the Bible says, hallelujah, that they were afraid. Hallelujah. Demons that tormented everybody. When they saw Christ, they ran up on him. They thought it was just anybody else. But as they got closer, hallelujah, &gt;&gt; they look past that flesh. The Bible says 12 legions of demons fell down and worshiped. &gt;&gt; Oh, [screaming] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think about that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The devil is powerless &gt;&gt; in your life &gt;&gt; if you got the right spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; The right spirit will make demons that have been victorious in other lives fall down and worship your God. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Church, I was in Quebec about three weeks ago and I was I was doing an outreach with a with a with a friend of mine and it was all kind of people that came and different things and and you know, we just preached the gospel. I ain't knew nobody. He ain't knew some people. We just preach the gospel. Hallelujah. And there's a spirit that's behind the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't have to do anything special. &gt;&gt; If they receive the right spirit, that spirit will deliver. &gt;&gt; That Hallelujah. If you receive the right spirit, that spirit will heal your body. &gt;&gt; That spirit will give you a peace of mind. That spirit will go out and get your lost loved ones. You don't have to do nothing. Hallelujah. [screaming] But project the right thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And what I love about this spirit, it don't need no help. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; But church, we was preaching and I told my testimony this time extensively &gt;&gt; cuz uh uh uh uh it was different people there and they never heard it before. So I was telling my testimony extensively just preaching and different things and showing how God is a healer. And although I didn't know nothing about him, I received it by faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that spirit came into my life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But now, hallelujah. That spirit was going to show me that he's truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Cuz all I had, Hallelujah. Through the grace of God, my mom introducing me into the word. Hallelujah. She gave me a scripture Isaiah 53 that says God is a healer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, the spirit and the word run together. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's how you get spirit and truth. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because we know the Bible says in John 17 that you are sanctified through his word, thy word is truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So tonight, hallelujah, we believe that we have God's word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We believe, [screaming] hallelujah, that we have the truth of God's word &gt;&gt; more than just a Baptist, more than just a Methodist or a Catholic or whatever else denomination we may have came out of. That was just in part. We believe that we have the full revelation of God, &gt;&gt; which is truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, we ain't going to let that one slide by. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You might not understand it, but I'm I'm I'm going to help pull you along tonight. &gt;&gt; What we have tonight was been revealed, hallelujah, through the corridors of the ages. We don't have something that's partial. We have the full revelation of God. &gt;&gt; We don't have a partial spirit. We have the fullness of God. &gt;&gt; So, we have truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we have the word, we have truth. The Bible says, "Ye shall know the truth, and the truth will make you free." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Church, before I started reading my Bible, I was I was quoting that wrong. Oh my. Hallelujah. Before I started reading my Bible, I was quoting that wrong because I would say, "You should know the truth." And the truth will set you free. &gt;&gt; The Bible says the truth will do what? &gt;&gt; Make you free. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So if you're hearing the word, Hallelujah. You can't stop it. &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; If you're hearing the word, receiving that spirit, [screaming] Hallelujah. It says it will make you free &gt;&gt; against your own will &gt;&gt; tonight. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. No matter [screaming] how hard the enemy might fight, if you got truth, if you got the spirit, hallelujah, you will be made free. &gt;&gt; The devil can't stop it. He can't resist it. There's nothing that he can [screaming] do about it. The word has come to set us, make us free. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we receive the spirit &gt;&gt; and we got the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're free. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We're free. &gt;&gt; I think sometimes we don't we may save this for tomorrow cuz I can kind of feel you pulling real good. &gt;&gt; But church, hallelujah. And church should be the freest place we could be [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; on our jobs and different things in the public. You know, everybody believes something different. &gt;&gt; There are a lot other spirits out there. &gt;&gt; But when we come here &gt;&gt; under the same umbrella of the word &gt;&gt; with the same spirit, the same word, the same truth. Hallelujah. We should be free as a bird. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Woo. Hallelujah. [screaming] &gt;&gt; That's our right. The word makes us free. Every time we hear the word preach, hallelujah, it's to take you up into another climax. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But what do we do? We sit down on our freedom &gt;&gt; because some of us don't believe we're free. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; but you give me somebody that was once a slave. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I ain't talking about the natural. I'm talking about in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I was once housing the wrong spirit. I was once doing the wrong things. I once had the wrong nature. I once talked the wrong talk, walk the wrong walk. But then I got the right [screaming] spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I got the right spirit. Hallelujah. And the word came my way and set me free. And you don't want me to shout about it. Hey, [applause] &gt;&gt; I'm at a place now I don't care about anybody else's judgment. &gt;&gt; I refuse to go back in bondage. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] &gt;&gt; I refuse to be a caged up eagle. An eagle was meant to saw. &gt;&gt; I refuse to be a caged up lion. A life was [screaming] meant to roar. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Are you really free? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The right spirit dictates freedom. &gt;&gt; You ever seen somebody free and they sad? &gt;&gt; They don't quite understand. I can walk down the streets of the downtown Calgary. Hallelujah. Minding my own business with a smile on my face. &gt;&gt; Snowing. As long as I'm wrapped up good, I got a reason to smile. Hallelu. Hallelujah. Glory. But what we do, we let the effects of life &gt;&gt; dictate our freedom. When the Bible says, "Whom the Lord has set free &gt;&gt; is free indeed." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That mean no matter what it looks like, I'm free. &gt;&gt; No matter what my bills look like, I'm free. No [screaming] matter what's going on at home, I'm free. No matter what the boss man say, I'm free. And they can't take your freedom [screaming] &gt;&gt; because God has set me free. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Look, I heard my brother just say, my little king say, "Free at last." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Free at last. Who was he thanking? &gt;&gt; Thank God Almighty. I'm free at last. [screaming] &gt;&gt; God is the only one that can set us free. &gt;&gt; Not politicians, not politics, not money in the bank. The only one that can really set you free is God [screaming] Almighty. And until God does it, you don't even know what real freedom is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And he didn't know what real freedom was. &gt;&gt; Because he was basing his freedom upon political politics. &gt;&gt; But real freedom is when Christ comes in your heart. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And you can love past a skin color. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You can love past a dialect. &gt;&gt; You can love past a country. &gt;&gt; And you can look at somebody and see they got the same spirit you got. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] &gt;&gt; That's real freedom. &gt;&gt; That's right. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Spirit and truth. &gt;&gt; But I love it, church. Look at what he says. He says that, "Oh my, how do we maintain real liberty? &gt;&gt; How do we maintain real freedom?" It's a question, isn't it? Politics? No. A new president? &gt;&gt; Nope. In y'all case, prime minister, no more Trudeau. Some of you like, "Oh, praise God." The next one going to do what they supposed to do &gt;&gt; because God is in control. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't get all your stock. Don't put all your stock in the next person elected. Hallelujah. So things can be better down here. It ain't going to get no better. &gt;&gt; I keep telling the young folks over and over again, don't set yourself up, hallelujah, to live forever down here. &gt;&gt; Set yourself up to live eternity someplace else. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes. While I'm here, and I'm going to shock you. Yes. While I'm here, I want the best car. I want the biggest house. And I want plenty of money in the bank. &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, church. I want to live good. Yes, I do. I'd be lying to you if I said I want to live in poverty. &gt;&gt; That's that false humility. That's right. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Jesus Jesus didn't have no place to lay his head. But I ain't Jesus. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Solomon did. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. David did. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Abraham did. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A lot of God's people were blessed on this earth. Why? Because of the right spirit. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. King Solomon's God said, "What what do you want from me?" He said, "Lord, give me a spirit of wisdom." &gt;&gt; And he said, "Because you ask for the right thing, I'mma bless you in every other area." &gt;&gt; So if you get the right spirit, God will take care of everything else. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What we do first, we run after everything else, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; When we should make our life right first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I want the nicest car. I want the biggest house. I want plenty of money in my bank. But I want Christ more. &gt;&gt; So if I never obtain any of those things, hallelujah, I'm going to still give God all my heart. &gt;&gt; I'm going to serve it with everything I got. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I ain't going to let the times of life walk me down and put me back in the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If I don't get it, maybe it meant that I don't I ain't supposed to have it. And I'm fine with that. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; But until he tells me no, I'mma keep looking for that Maserati. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, I'm going to get back to the testimony. If I if I if I if I keep going, somebody shout out testimony. Church, before I came to service, I was praying and just over my own life, God started to bring it together like the things I'm praying about. And then it was like God was talking to me say, "You've been preaching about all this stuff you believe God going to do. When you going to start walking into it?" &gt;&gt; I see. I put God way out there. I put him way out there. I don't believe in just a a a God like I believe in a big God. &gt;&gt; He's always on my &gt;&gt; side. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I serve a mighty big God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church? &gt;&gt; I don't put them down here. I put them way up there. H I throw them way out there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've been I've been I've been confessing. Hallelujah. In my prayers and out loud over churches all over the world. I've been saying I believe God can bless me with a house that's already paid for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Get too many amens on that one. &gt;&gt; Well, you keep paying a mortgage. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My Bible said you going to stay in houses you didn't even build. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'mma eat in vineyards I didn't even plant. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm sick of going to the Whole Food store. &gt;&gt; I want my own stuff. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe in a God like that, church. &gt;&gt; But where is it coming from? Hallelujah. The Bible says, hallelujah, that he could do exceedingly abundantly above. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, church, exceedingly abundantly above. &gt;&gt; All that you could ask &gt;&gt; or think. So if I can think it, that means God can do more than that. So, a house [screaming] without a mortgage ain't nothing. &gt;&gt; Because I thought about it &gt;&gt; I mean, I don't know how God talked to you, but that's how he talked to me. &gt;&gt; He was like, "Hey, you've been professing, saying all this stuff. It ain't just good preaching. It's time for you to walk into it." Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I believe somewhere out there, either somebody's building a house for me &gt;&gt; or it's already out there they going to give to. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] &gt;&gt; See, some of y'all listen to that. You better you getting high. You believe what you want to believe. &gt;&gt; Just the same God &gt;&gt; that can heal my body from cancer with no bill. is the same God that can provide a house for this body he heal to stay in with no bill. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't know how things work over here, but you know the Lord was sharing with me. He was like, "Hey, see you waiting to credit get right and all this stuff." He said, "That ain't faith. you mapping it out. You trying to get it together. He said, "Step out to the impossible." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The credit might not look right to them, but if you got the right spirit, &gt;&gt; oh my, the Bible also says he'll take from the healing and give to the believer. &gt;&gt; I appreciate that. That brother said, "That's me." [snorts] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. See church, when we hear these kind of things, what does it do? It should challenge you to believe for greater things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Even in business and different things, some of us got businesses. You ought to be saying, "Lord, I'm tired of running this. &gt;&gt; I'm tired of running this business. &gt;&gt; Give me some. Put me in a place where somebody else can run it and I can just be with my family." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Cuz all I want to do is serve you. Hallelujah. [screaming] &gt;&gt; I don't want my business to make me miss church or any other opportunity to be a blessing for God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've tried it. I've tried business and all these things and God wouldn't let me prosper. You know why? Because it took away from who and what he wanted me to do in the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; And that's just me. That's my own personal testimony. &gt;&gt; But church, hallelujah. I believe that God can do anything. &gt;&gt; I said I said it in Australia. Hallelujah. Somebody must need this. Hallelujah. I was Australia about two weeks ago and I said I said hey you know what I said we we talking about brother Brandon not pulling for money and I know if I say right now pull out a basket I need an offering. &gt;&gt; Y'all look at me like crazy. Better yet you'll look at him like what in the world is this brother doing? Brother Brandon never pull for money. Let's make sense out of it. Hallelujah. He didn't have to &gt;&gt; because God hallelujah anointed and inspired 20 millionaires to take care of him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In your books is called the Christian businessman. &gt;&gt; H remember he said, "Hey, they bought me a house in a gated community. I can't stay in there." Who you think was doing it? &gt;&gt; They bought me a big old Cadillac. I can't drive a car like that. And then he say, "Hey, my clothes are bought for me." Who you think was doing it? &gt;&gt; People that God made rich to take care of his servant. &gt;&gt; And then, hallelujah. I stepped way on out there. I said, "God, if you gave a prophet 20, all I need is one millionaire." [laughter] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "Brother D, you being conn." No. This is what I believe. I believe that God [screaming] is a God that says he's never seen the righteous forsaken or his seed begging for bread. &gt;&gt; We not beggars, we believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know the song. Hallelujah. You made a way. He made a way. &gt;&gt; When my back was against the wall &gt;&gt; and it looked like it was over. that song where the author Travis Green, he from my state &gt;&gt; and you know his wife, him and his wife was having she was pregnant with their first child and she her water broke I think at 21 weeks. 21 weeks they had to take the baby out. Something like that. It was real real super early. 21 weeks they had to take the baby out and the doctor comes to him &gt;&gt; and his wife and say, "Well, we got to take the baby. You know, most likely ain't going to live, but y'all can try again." &gt;&gt; And we be wondering where songs come from. &gt;&gt; We Oh my. &gt;&gt; See, y'all pulled me into tomorrow. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We be wondering where these inspirations come from. He said when the doctor told him that, he said he looked at his wife and he said, "We trust [screaming] God too much to give up now." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is there anybody here against the circumstances, no matter what's going on, can say tonight that the spirit in me, it trustes God too much to give up now? &gt;&gt; And that baby that was 21 weeks is now living and singing songs with his father. &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's somebody who don't know the truth like me and you know &gt;&gt; and we got a full revelation of God. We should see just as much or even greater miracles in our own lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God honors faith. [snorts] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. and say when it looked like it was over, &gt;&gt; he said, "Hey, you move mountains. &gt;&gt; You cause walls to fall with your power." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You do what? &gt;&gt; You perform miracles. There is nothing [screaming] &gt;&gt; that God can't do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. And I'm standing here today only because you made a way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, that's what the right spirit will do. &gt;&gt; But what if you got spirit and truth? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All things are possible. &gt;&gt; He told the prophet, if you could get the people to believe, nothing will be able to stand before you. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he had the right spirit and he had truth. So he said nothing will be able to stand in front of you, not even cancer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my, I feel the Holy Spirit present tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen, so we're free. Why? Because we got the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word makes us free. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But on and on. Listen, don't get nervous. I ain't going to be too much longer. I'm about to close. Listen now. What is that spirit for us? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That spirit for us is really simple. It's called something that I'm sure you hear about a lot in this church. &gt;&gt; It's called the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He's my friend, so I know what you like to talk about. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't never get too spiritual &gt;&gt; to hear about the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Let me let me let me show you why. &gt;&gt; Because the Holy Spirit is that spirit we're talking about. &gt;&gt; That's the comforter. &gt;&gt; That's he that's going to guide you into all truth. &gt;&gt; That's he that's going to show you things to come. Hallelujah. And if you don't want to hear about the Holy Ghost, you you can't conquer your future. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't be led, you can't be guided into all truth without the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is so important. Hallelujah. But but let's look at what what does the Holy Ghost mean to you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's very important that we receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the Holy Ghost is Christ himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. W the Holy Ghost is he. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is a person. &gt;&gt; It ain't just a dance or a shout. Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost is someone living in you. &gt;&gt; Someone thinking for you, &gt;&gt; someone praying through you. &gt;&gt; Someone Hallelujah. ordering your steps. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is not some mystical thought. The Holy Ghost is a person. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm feel I'm going to say this real boldly. &gt;&gt; I got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know what that means? That mean I got the person inside of me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [laughter] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you got the Holy Ghost, you got Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What does that mean? Hallelujah. The one that was in the lion's den. The one that was in the fiery furnace. The one that split the red she. The one that instructed him to build a boat that'll go through destruction. Hallelujah. The one Hallelujah. that overshadowed Mary. Hallelujah. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The one Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That came four days late &gt;&gt; just to show what that spirit will do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Realize that, church. Sometimes God comes late just to show how powerful what you have inside. &gt;&gt; My mom sing a song. He's an on time God. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. &gt;&gt; Oh God. [singing] &gt;&gt; Oh yes he is. Amen. &gt;&gt; May not come when you want it, but he'll be there right all time &gt;&gt; cuz he's an old time God. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. &gt;&gt; Church, &gt;&gt; that spirit living in you tonight, it'll do the same thing it did in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Why? Because [screaming] it is Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. See what denominations do? They make that spirit three. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When there's only one &gt;&gt; God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is one person. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Living in you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Cuz we know how the prophet broke it down. See, that's that's what I'm saying. Truth. Hallelujah. We know the father is a title. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost is a title. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But all of that living in one person. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we have that person. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Somebody asked me one time, they say, "Hey, well, if you saying it's one person, well, what color is God?" &gt;&gt; "What color is God?" He was trying to be sarcastic. &gt;&gt; "What color is God?" I said, "Well, if he and me, he a black man. He and you. He's a white man. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, it ain't it ain't the flesh. It's the spirit behind the flesh. &gt;&gt; I ain't never seen a colorful spirit. &gt;&gt; Because the spirit is a life. &gt;&gt; I've seen Filipino Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I've seen Hallelujah. Oh, I've seen South African Hallelujah. Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Speaking a whole another language. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What is it? It has nothing to do with the flesh. It's the spirit. &gt;&gt; God is a spirit. &gt;&gt; Listen, how important is it to have the right spirit? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Listen, for those of you who don't have the Holy Ghost, you're defeating the purpose of living here. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about Calvary. I'm talking about on the earth. &gt;&gt; You're defeating the purpose. Think about it. Hallelujah. Wouldn't you wouldn't you want to be a person that's housing the almighty God? &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I I I don't think we catching that one, church. Those of you who have the Holy Ghost, the prophet of God said, hallelujah, if you got the Holy Ghost, he said, the same power that created the world is living in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just the right spirit can do that. &gt;&gt; Joshua looking at the sun say, "Hey, son, stand still. Moon, you hang over here." And he didn't even have the Holy Ghost. Right. &gt;&gt; He didn't even have the person. &gt;&gt; He just had a right spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bible says, hallelujah, that Daniel was of an excellent spirit. &gt;&gt; They didn't have the person, the life of Christ inside. They just had a good spirit. &gt;&gt; Now, what should we be able to do? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Or what should I say? What should we be able to believe for? The Holy Ghost. How important is it? Listen. Hallelujah. I love how the prophet put this. He said, "The Holy Spirit is your earnest." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know brother Paul hope you mind. I know he's a builder. Hallelujah. And and and and if I'm correct, you don't just go build a house. They got to give you a little something. They got to put a little something down. Got to give you a little earnest to show that you're serious about it. Honey, you like, "Hey, hey, man. I want you to go build me a million dollar house and I'll come back with the money." No. No. It don't work like that. You got to have a down payment. &gt;&gt; I got to know that you serious. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost, Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Shows the rims, hallelujah, of the world. Hallelujah. How serious you are. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's the earnest. It's the down payment. Hallelujah. Of the whole deal. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As long as I've given a down payment, you got to give me what I want. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or give me my down payment back. &gt;&gt; Now, I sure don't want my life back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, I'm going on with the deal. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen. Listen what the prophet says. Oh my. Everybody all right? &gt;&gt; Listen. He says, "We don't have it now in full. We have the earnest of our salvation. We have the earnest of eternal. We got the earnest of eternal life." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think about that, church. We sing that song uh uh uh we shall rise. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the resurrection morning. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When death's prison bonds are broken, &gt;&gt; we shall rise. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But the Holy Spirit is the earnest of that. &gt;&gt; And you you know what we should say? I shall rise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I will rise. &gt;&gt; Listen. He says the earnest of your salvation. We have the earnest of eternal life of an immortal life. The Holy Ghost says that we don't belong here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost says that you have residency someplace else. &gt;&gt; Oh my immortal life that will live forever as we receive the Holy Spirit. We also have the earnest of our resurrection. Oh my. &gt;&gt; So if I got the Holy Ghost, that mean if I die, I'mma automatically raise up. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the power of the right spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the power of the Holy Ghost, the comforter himself in you. He said, as we see a frail body, nothing but a shadow laying eat up with cancer where Hallelujah. where many fine doctors has tried to kill or or fail. Hallelujah. To see God Almighty heal that person. That's the proof of the resurrection. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, you guys, Hallelujah, may not even realize the power of what I'm just reading to you. &gt;&gt; He said that the proof of the resurrection is a body that's maybe been eat up by cancer and doctors didn't try to do everything they can do to heal it and God supernaturally heals that person. &gt;&gt; He said that's the proof of the resurrection right in your face. &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen on that one? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, [snorts] I just said that that was the proof. &gt;&gt; I mean, come here what 12, 13, 14, 15 years. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where the enemy tried to kill this body with cancer, &gt;&gt; make it look all frail, make it look all sick, and God's word came and healed it. So, you know what I am? I am to you the proof of the resurrection. [applause] &gt;&gt; I don't get the glory. He does. See, he's the one that healed my body. He's the one that show See what he said. He will show you things to come. He won't speak of himself. He'll speak of Oh my. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; It'll speak of him, Christ. &gt;&gt; That's what the right spirit does. &gt;&gt; It brings us back to truth. Hallelujah. And we when you got the Holy Ghost, you got the earnest [screaming] Hallelujah. of a body change. &gt;&gt; You got the Holy Ghost. If you drop dead right now, you got the earnest [screaming] of eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Because of spirit and truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen. Oh my. Think about it. Look at what God did. Oh my. Listen. When we bring all us together, the spirit and the word, he says, "But God knows what he's doing as long as he has as long as he's leading." You see, you must always go by the spirit. And the spirit will always agree with the word. &gt;&gt; That's how you know somebody ain't got the right spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If they don't agree with the word, &gt;&gt; brother Brandham said this. Brother Brandham said that he he made mistakes here. He made mistakes that. But what does the word say? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, I'm to a place now where I'm not looking for debates. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; On the message. &gt;&gt; I'm not looking to debate somebody what I believe. &gt;&gt; I'm going just live it. &gt;&gt; I'm going show you what this message will do. &gt;&gt; I'm going show you what it means, hallelujah, to be born again. &gt;&gt; I'mma show you what it means to house the power of God inside of you. &gt;&gt; And that has nothing to do with brother Brad. Hallelujah. Because he Hallelujah came to do what? Turn [screaming] our hearts back to what? The faith. &gt;&gt; Turn our hearts back to Christ. &gt;&gt; And in doing all that, he said, "This message made my Bible what?" A [screaming] new book. &gt;&gt; Brought us back into what? Truth. &gt;&gt; Oh boy. We are blessed people. &gt;&gt; This is not just a Saturday night. This is a reunion of truth. &gt;&gt; Spirit and truth. &gt;&gt; We got the right spirit with the truth. That mean anything is possible today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "And now if the spirit leads you contrary to the word, then it's not the spirit of God." Now, if the Holy Spirit is leading you, hallelujah, it'll say Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. If it's God in you, that mean that anything you read in this Bible, he can still do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And even what's not written. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So true. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes that take people for a loop because they be looking for something the prophet said or they be trying to find it in the script. The Bible says, "Hallelujah. If everything that Christ did was written, the books wouldn't be able to contain it." Amen. &gt;&gt; So, there are some things that we can believe for that's not on paper. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You might not be able to find it in the message of the hour, &gt;&gt; but God is God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Look, like I was saying, I was preaching. I tell my testimony and and uh uh I was talking about God healed me and at the end, hallelujah, I say, I can feel the spirit of the Lord moving. if you want prayer, come to the front. So, everybody came to the front expecting a traditional prayer line. Y'all, but y'all know I'm not traditional. So, it was just kind of shocking because new people and all these things and different ones. Hallelujah. I said, I want everybody to stand in a circle. So, we all stood in a circle. I said, "Let's hold hands." And I'm not just going to pray, but I want you to pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to express to God what you want him to do in your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "Bro Digs, why you doing that?" Because when I'm gone, you still got to have a relationship with God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When I'm gone, Hallelujah. You still may need things from God. You can't wait till next winter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For me to come back. &gt;&gt; Some of y'all caught that one. [snorts] &gt;&gt; But when it's something personal, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you know that he lives in you. Hallelujah. The Bible says, "Ask and it shall be given." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Seek. Hallelujah. And ye shall find. Knock and the door shall be open to you. He said, "For he who askketh does what? Receive." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the Bible. &gt;&gt; That's truth. Hallelujah. So, everybody will stand up front. I said, I want everybody to pray to God and pray what you want the Lord to do for you because he's here. Amen. &gt;&gt; So they prayed, I prayed, all of us prayed up front, you know, it was just a powerful atmosphere. &gt;&gt; What an atmosphere it is when everybody is praying. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not just the person leading the service, but everybody knows their God. &gt;&gt; That's a powerful atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was a it was a it was a uh I got a testimony back from a uh from the parents of a young girl. Her name is Judith. And Judith was diagnosed with ADHD when she was 5 years old. And in the in the uh caption of the letter, they say that's some 13 plus years ago, something like that. And they said, "Well, you could always tell when she didn't have her medicine. You sent her to school and because she didn't have the medicine, she get in a lot of trouble because she's not focused." All these different things that they say the effects of ADHD. So that was a diagnosed from the doctor. But you know, uh, she would get into all kind of trouble, all kind of things, and they call her parents and say, "Hey, Judith is acting up and say, did she have a medicine? Oh man, we must forgot or she didn't take it." Blah, blah, blah. So they get the medicine, too. She calm down. They say, "Okay, everything all right. She's got a medicine." But Judith in church that night, &gt;&gt; 13 or whatever she was, h, Judith got home and she told her mama and daddy, she said, "Hey, y'all know what? I ain't taking this medicine no more and she threw it in the trash. [applause] &gt;&gt; 13 or teenager, whatever. Hallelujah. She threw it in the trash. And the mom and dad was like, "What? What? What? What are you doing?" She said, "If God can do that for brother Diggs, he can do that for me." &gt;&gt; What was she doing? She was tapping into the spirit. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She said, "Hallelujah." the words that they gave me the testimony saying that she was so inspired by your testimony. She said, "If God can do that for him, he can do that for me." &gt;&gt; So, she didn't take a medicine, threw it in the trash and went to school like she normally do. &gt;&gt; And you know, sometimes parents because we love our kids so much, we have more doubt than they do. &gt;&gt; They just believe in God, but we love them so much. We like, "Oh my, she didn't went to school without a medicine, this and that." So, they waiting on the phone call. No phone call. waiting a little bit longer. No phone call &gt;&gt; cuz they almost I need to go back and read it, but I think they wanted to call the school. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Want to make want to make the girl have a fit &gt;&gt; when she belie &gt;&gt; if somebody say they believe in God, you believe with him. [applause] &gt;&gt; Don't be like Saul. Saul had the wrong spirit. He told David, you just a you. He's been a He's been a a giant killer. He's been a warrior since his youth. &gt;&gt; And David's standing there saying, "My God, my God, I got the right spirit." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My God going to take care of it. If somebody's believing, let's just believe with them. &gt;&gt; Church, I'm sure. Hallelujah. She went through that day with no spells, no acting out, no nothing. So I think the parents did talk to the nurse or whatever say how was Judith was fine. Judith ain't come to my office. What was it? She received the right spirit. &gt;&gt; The spirit of him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. In the same service. Hallelujah. Hallelu. There's another sister who said she came to church and she said, "You ever came to church, you say, Lord, I need something directly to me. &gt;&gt; I need something personal. &gt;&gt; I do that all the time. I said, "Lord, I need you to talk to me tonight." She said, as she was she was saying as she was sitting in service, she said, "Lord, I need the minister to talk to me tonight." She said, while she was praying that, I walked up to her, grabbed her by hand, and stood her up and say, "You are a miracle." &gt;&gt; And then I said it again to her, "You are a miracle. You are a miracle." She said, I said it to her three times. Hallelujah. She said, hallelujah. She said she knew that was God because she had three sicknesses she was being challenged by and God healed of all three in that service. [applause] Hallelujah. It's word to word. Hallelujah. If I say anything that blesses you through the word, that means because you are the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. Church, I can go on and on about what happens when the room is full of his spirit. &gt;&gt; Remember what the Bible says, hallelujah. When they all got on one accord, &gt;&gt; one mind, &gt;&gt; what happened? &gt;&gt; He, the spirit of truth, came down, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think about that next time you come to church. &gt;&gt; What if in your mind you just say, "Lord," in your heart you say, "Lord, have your way with me today." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you take the chains off. Sometimes the devil don't put chains on us. We do. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts] I'm about to close. But church, when that right spirit comes in the congregation and we all believing under the umbrella of one mind, one accord, and God comes down, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; to seal us &gt;&gt; under that faith, &gt;&gt; supernatural things become regular things. &gt;&gt; I heard a brother say one time they was having so many supernatural things happening in their church. He said, "We're not looking for cancer anymore. Cancel is nothing." &gt;&gt; He said, "We're looking for people that are blind." [snorts] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're not just cancer, man. That ain't We're looking for people that are blind. &gt;&gt; We want to see God. We know God can open blinded eyes. &gt;&gt; How big is your God tonight? &gt;&gt; How big is that spirit in you? Can it believe for anything? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Church, I just know that God has something great in store for us. I don't I don't have time to read it, but in you know what, if y'all don't mind, I'mma read this. In one quote, everything I preach to y'all is summed up in one quote. That's why I know this message is truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now I didn't I didn't preach maybe well my I set my alarm for an hour a hour hallelujah of preaching by inspiration. &gt;&gt; Now what I preach hallelujah catching your thoughts and watching catching the way of the spirit and move. That's my pattern. My pattern hallelujah is to touch and agree with the spirit that's in the room. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So if you that's why I say you pull I preach. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you think Hallelujah. If you think in the right channel, Hallelujah. God allow my gift to catch it and talk to you. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That's just the way I'm built. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But think about all the things I've said tonight. I'm going to read one quote and going to sum up the whole thing. This is what the prophet of God says. He says, "The word always comes to the truly spiritfilled." This is the evidence of being filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Not a dance, not a shout. It's the spirit. Hallelujah. Coming to those that receive the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. The Holy Ghost is what? You living the word for your day. &gt;&gt; That's how we know you got the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you can look at this word and don't deny any parts of it, but be like Mary, be unto me according to your word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the Holy [snorts] Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen, the evidence of being filled with the Holy Ghost, that is what Jesus said would be the evidence. He said, "And I will pray the father and he will send you another comforter." Who is the comforter? The comforter is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The spirit of truth. &gt;&gt; Oh my. That he may abide with you forever. Even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive. The world can't receive what? The Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The spirit of truth. Oh my. He said the world cannot receive. Now we know what the truth is. Thy word is truth. John 17:7. John 17:17. Again in John 8 and 43. Now these all the things I didn't talk about tonight. Hallelujah. John 8:43. Why do you not understand my speech? Even because ye hear ye cannot hear my word. Did you notice that Jesus said that the world could not receive the Holy Ghost? Well, in this verse I just read, neither could they receive the word. &gt;&gt; You'll never get the Holy Ghost unless you receive the word. &gt;&gt; And without the word, you cannot receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's for you people who don't come to church all the time. Well, I think I'mma stay home and stream tonight. &gt;&gt; Don't miss out on the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they run together, spirit and truth. &gt;&gt; Don't get me wrong. I know sometimes you can't make it and all these things, but it just ain't the same watching it online. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; I like to be there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's like Hallelujah. You watch the cooking channel and they cooking something really good. Boy, boy, that looks so good. Your mouth get watering. You can't taste it. &gt;&gt; Smell it. &gt;&gt; Look good. Everybody, you can't smell it. Can't All you can do is whoo unless you go in the kitchen and make it yourself. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But you got to stick with the recipe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I ain't got nothing against streaming, but if you can make it, why not be in that presence? Amen. &gt;&gt; Why not be Hallelujah with those of like precious faith? &gt;&gt; Listen, he says, uh, &gt;&gt; neither could they receive the word. Why? Because the spirit and the word are one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You heard me tonight. My title is what? Spirit and truth. &gt;&gt; The spirit and the word is one. You can't separate. You say, "Bro D, I got the word and not the right spirit." You said, "Brother D, I got I got the spirit and not the truth." &gt;&gt; They work together. &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit as the prophets, the word will come to come to you. You would receive it. John 14 and 26. But the comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the father will send in my name, he shall teach you. See, I like the way he said. He shall teach you. The comforter, he shall teach you. The guide, he shall teach you. &gt;&gt; Amen. He shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance. The Holy Ghost will bring up things that you may have forgotten. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's God keeping his own word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. whatsoever I have said unto you. Here again we find we find that the word coming because the spirit of God again in John 16:13. How be it when he hallelujah when he the spirit of truth word is come he will guide you into all truth. Thy word [screaming] is truth &gt;&gt; and he shall not speak of himself. Now let me ask you something tonight church. Have I given you the word? &gt;&gt; Have I given you truth? You should say amen. Because not one time have I given you brother the digs thoughts. &gt;&gt; He will always speak of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The right spirit will always speak of Christ. &gt;&gt; That's why me personally, I can receive the prophet as a prophet because he always pointed when I listen I hear him pointing me to Christ. Not the Jeffersonville, not the Arizona, not to all these different things, these different relics. Those are other people doing those things. But when I hear the spirit move on those tapes and books, I hear Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just like when I read Paul, Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When I read Thessalonians, Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I read Ephesus, Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; It should always tell us about him. &gt;&gt; If you get up here and talk about your life all the time, that's not the right spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The testimonies I share is about what? Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He says, 'I want you to note very carefully that Jesus did not say that the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost while speaking in tongue, interpreting, prophesying, or shouting and dancing. He said the evidence would be that you would be in the truth. &gt;&gt; You would be in the word of God for your age. Evidence has to do with receiving the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many got the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, you can't receive that word and not have the right spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; You say, "I'm in a mess church." So is the devil. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He does everything he can do to get in here and mess up the service. But there's but then there's another spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come musicians come. &gt;&gt; Then there's another spirit. &gt;&gt; So we want spirit and truth. &gt;&gt; Because it's the truth by that spirit that sets makes us free. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we thank God for a word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That'll always express the life of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; If there's any word you hear that see see that's the problem we have with denominations. Hallelujah. Most of the pastors always bring the people to them. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And most of the churches bring the people to them. &gt;&gt; You got to be at this church. You got to listen. This this is the only church and we the only ones got it. This we No, &gt;&gt; it's all about Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I can witness to somebody and tell them about Christ without telling them about my church &gt;&gt; or where I worship. That's between them and God. &gt;&gt; My job is to tell them the truth &gt;&gt; with the right spirit. &gt;&gt; You know, the prophet of God say, "Hey, I'd rather have a man wrong in his doctrine, but with the right spirit." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can find people who know this message and believe this message but just ain't got the right spirit. &gt;&gt; The two got to work together. &gt;&gt; Examine your life by spirit and truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because our spirit should reflect him &gt;&gt; and the truth of the word should reflect him. &gt;&gt; Everything about us should reflect Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The one behind us. Amen. &gt;&gt; The one living in us. Amen. Hallelujah. We should never have to exalt ourselves. Christ will do that. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. &gt;&gt; Probably want them some of the saints to sing the song with me, but it been on my heart.

Cover [singing] me. Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; Father, you are our peace, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, and you cover us, Lord, when we're hurting, Lord. You cover us, Lord, when all hope is gone, Lord. Lord, and we want that peace, Lord God, that surpasses all that we can understand, Lord. &gt;&gt; And you are that peace, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, without you, we are nothing, Lord. &gt;&gt; Without you, the service is nothing. And Lord, we believe that your spirit is here. We believe that the true divine revelation of the word &gt;&gt; was preached tonight. &gt;&gt; So Lord, we ask Lord in our own individual lives that you would come and consume our sacrifice. [music] &gt;&gt; Lord, if we're truly in your presence, Lord, Father, there are needs in this place. &gt;&gt; Lord, somebody need healings in their body. Father, Lord, we've heard the truth. You are the Lord thy God that health from all our sicknesses and diseases. You are Jehovah Rafa. We believe that to be truth &gt;&gt; and we receive it by spirit. &gt;&gt; Lord, touch those bodies right now &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus. Lord God, some are praying for loved ones, daughters that are out in the world who've heard this truth. Mothers of burden for their daughters. &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray you take away that burden &gt;&gt; and put a spirit of confidence there. Amen. &gt;&gt; That can speak back to the heart of a parent that says if you've raised them up in the way that they should go, it doesn't matter what they may do. &gt;&gt; That the word will make them free &gt;&gt; against their own will. It'll make them free because we have a promise that the Holy Ghost is unto us and our children &gt;&gt; and even our children's children. &gt;&gt; Amen. and to whomsoever is far off. &gt;&gt; Lord, these are the promises that you've given that are here tonight on display, &gt;&gt; Lord. And we've spoken about you to be that big God that you are. &gt;&gt; Lord, it is so beyond houses and cars and all these things, but you're a God of satisfaction. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're a God of confidence. You're a God of deliverance. You're a God of healing and joy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and every attribute of thy spirit is in this room tonight. &gt;&gt; And Lord, we just want to connect. And Lord, we pray right now if there's someone here who needs to rededicate their life, this is your chance. All heads bow, eyes closed. You personally may not have been living up to the standard of spirit and truth. Maybe you've seen it in a parent and down in way down in your heart, you've been craving it, but you feel like you've been bound. That spirit has come to set you free tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Maybe you've been longing to rededicate your life and live for him because in the world you've been hurt. &gt;&gt; This is your night for healing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All heads bow, eyes closed. &gt;&gt; If God is talking to you to rededicate your life, &gt;&gt; the only person looking at your heart is God. &gt;&gt; And if you raise your hand, the only one looking at your hand is God. You want to rededicate your life, lift your hands to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Right now in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless each and every hand. But I want to take it a step further. &gt;&gt; You in your heart, you know God is talking to you. &gt;&gt; And you didn't raise your hand. This is the grace of God still coming after you. &gt;&gt; God don't want your hand. He wants your heart. &gt;&gt; If you'll just surrender, he'll do the rest. &gt;&gt; Because it's by his spirit that we are saved. &gt;&gt; It's his spirit that allows us to triumph. Don't you want to have that life of triumph? &gt;&gt; Yes, it comes with battles. It comes with struggle. But it also comes with victory. &gt;&gt; Will you give God your heart tonight? This church was put here to be a hospital to redeem souls. &gt;&gt; And you've come tonight to hear about spirit and truth. Will you just get your spirit right? &gt;&gt; Receive God in your heart &gt;&gt; by faith. All he wants you to do to accept &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. Father, you saw the hands that were lifted to you. &gt;&gt; And they didn't lift their hands to me, but they lifted to you, Lord. &gt;&gt; For Lord, you said through a prophet that in this room, in another dimension, that's faster than the eye can see, that there are angels in the walls of this room. And if angels are here, God is here &gt;&gt; because their whole job is to exalt the Lord &gt;&gt; or to send out the message given from God. And Lord, you've sent angels in this room to deliver. &gt;&gt; You sent angels in this room to exalt you. So I pray for you that lift your hand for rededication unto God. that you would in this moment no longer doubt that rededication. &gt;&gt; But receive the strength to [music] live on &gt;&gt; receive the strength in happiness and in joy and in victory and in triumph through every battle, through every struggle in Jesus Christ's name right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To every hand that was raised, receive that spirit and thy truth &gt;&gt; because thy word is truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you can say amen to the word &gt;&gt; with the right spirit, &gt;&gt; you can be rededicated tonight. &gt;&gt; And to that heart &gt;&gt; that's on the fence. That's to that heart that's young and yearning for a better life. All you got to do is receive it tonight. &gt;&gt; Just receive him. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about Brother Diggs. Don't worry about the ministry in this church. Just realize that tonight you heard from God. &gt;&gt; And if you heard from God, he will continue to deal with you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, touch that heart. Touch that life, that rededicated heart right now. Peace of God, cover me. Cover me. Pastor cover me. &gt;&gt; The spirit is here. &gt;&gt; If you don't have the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; this is your time to receive it. Cover me. Seek with me. Peace of God. Peace of God. Cover me through the storm. Through the storm. The Bible says as Peter spake those words, the Holy Ghost fell and the Holy Ghost is receiving the word for your day. Peace [music] of God, cover [singing] me. The Holy Ghost is here tonight through the storm. Cover me. One more time. Peace of God. Peace. Take full advantage of the opportunity to put down your down payment to receive the earnest of resurrection power, the earnest of immortality, and that's the Holy Ghost in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Through the stone. Only you. Only in you I'm [music] secure. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Only in you [music] I find peace. Yes. &gt;&gt; So cover me. [music] &gt;&gt; Cover me when I am hurting. Cover me [music] when I'm not strong. Cover me when I [singing] am [music] going through the storm. Cover [music] me when all seems hopeless. Cover me when my faith is gone. Let the [music] peace that passes all I understand. Co. Amen. God bless you tonight. Maybe just stand with me as we begin to close. Certainly like to welcome our visitors. God bless you, Sister Huckle, Sister Lana, and each one who's made the effort to come out tonight. I believe that we have heard from God. &gt;&gt; We haven't heard from a man. &gt;&gt; We heard from the Lord Jesus who is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sister Rose, God bless you. It's good to see you. You know, just the one thing that you said tonight, brother, is just so so true. It's so much better to have the right spirit in our lives with the wrong doctrine and not be so fussed on all of the little tiny things. And we say they're little tiny things, but sometimes we can strain at the knat &gt;&gt; and have a beam in our own eye. And that's a terrible place to be. But getting the right spirit is the critical key. Getting in the spirit. I was having the conversation today at the graveside. It's all about getting in the spirit. It's all about his [music] spirit. Outside of his spirit, we just have a bunch of knowledge. We just have a bunch of wisdom and a bunch of knowledge. But we're not going to get to that level of faith that we need to to change our bodies. You know, I'm not going to preach. I'm just going to say let's just [music] have a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you for this day. We thank you, Lord, for the service tonight. We know that you have spoken, Lord, and we receive it the way that you've given it. Lord, we're not interested in making excuses. We don't want to try and mix something with this word for our day. We don't want a hybrid religion. That's the reason why parents have children sometimes that just don't want to serve you because they're they see their parents mixing something with the word. There's something not true. There's something not right. Why would children want to serve a God like that? Father, we pray that you would help us to repent. Help us, Lord Jesus, to come unto you and ask you, Father, to forgive us, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. We know that's the zeal of the age is to repent. Father, every one of us, every day, we need to repent. Father, we need to just go on our knees and ask you, Father, to let us die so that you could live in our lives so that your spirit would lead us, that your spirit would guide us, that your spirit would speak through us, that your spirit would think through us. Forgive us for thinking that we could ever do it on our own, Lord. Oh father, it takes you in every aspect of our lives. &gt;&gt; Father, tonight we just thank you for ministering to us. Lord, we pray for those who couldn't come here tonight, Father, for whatever the reason. Maybe sickness, Lord Jesus. Maybe work, maybe just indifference and coldness of spirit. But Father, we just want to send the agent of your Holy Spirit after those people specifically, Lord, that they would have a renewed zeal in their life, Father, to want to get together with your spirit, [music] &gt;&gt; and be in that atmosphere. And Father, those who are traveling away, Lord, we pray that you would just keep your hand upon them. Thank you for bringing the other travelers home safely, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for the testimony of Sister Jine's life, Lord. Father, the funeral service today. Thank you for the celebration, Lord. Father, thank you for the many testimonies, Lord. Father, the many lives that she touched. Father, we pray that you would just comfort those, Lord, whose hearts are broken. &gt;&gt; Now, Father, as we go our separate ways tonight, we pray that you would just be glorified. We pray that you would be the central theme of our lives, Lord Jesus. That when we lay our heads down on the pillow, that we would think about your spirit. that when we wake up in the morning, oh Father, we would consider, do we have your spirit, &gt;&gt; Father, that you would be the one leading us, &gt;&gt; oh Father, and if it's your will for us to gather again tomorrow, we will bring a sacrifice of praise, Father. We won't be looking for who's here except for you. We will be looking to meet your spirit once again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The person of Jesus Christ. Father, we pray Lord also that you would restore Brother Cadre's strength, that you would grant to him a fresh coal off the altar, Lord, that you would watch over his family while he's away, Lord. That you would just lead him and guide him while he's here. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, we just love you and we thank you tonight. We just commit this service now into your hands and each life here in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we sing that song? He is our peace. He has broken down every wall. He is [singing] our [music] peace who has broken down every wall. He is our [music] peace. is our peace. He is our peace who has broken down everyone. He is our peace. is of just cast all your cares cast [music and singing] all your cares on him for he cares [music] for you Heat. Heat. asking [music] for your hands on you for you. Can we sing Holy [music] Spirit rain down? I know we have to have service tomorrow. If you have to go, you're more than welcome to. Something about his presence. We'll just sing this chorus here.
