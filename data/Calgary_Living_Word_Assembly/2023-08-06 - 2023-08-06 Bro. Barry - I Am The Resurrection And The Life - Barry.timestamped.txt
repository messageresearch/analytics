[7:24] if you have your Bibles this morning I
[7:26] just would like to read from John
[7:29] chapter 11.
[7:33] something I think maybe we went over a
[7:36] while ago

[7:46] visitors

[7:50] catenge from Alaska I believe he's the
[7:54] the father of our visitors that have
[7:57] been here the husband and uh we
[7:59] certainly just want to welcome you
[8:00] brother and I understand he's a minister
[8:02] in Alaska a minister of this gospel so
[8:04] we just want to welcome you and our
[8:06] midst brother God bless you
[8:12] and we have a sister
[8:13] Teresita a friend of sister Emmy she is

[8:37] God bless you Sister welcome
[8:39] and we have sister Ruth here on a visit
[8:42] from Germany
[8:43] God bless you Sister
[8:46] I trust each one feels welcome here
[8:48] today we have some visitors that aren't
[8:51] really visitors they're just more family
[8:53] and we trust you just feel right at home
[8:55] today I don't want to leave anyone out
[8:57] so I'm going to stop right there those
[8:58] are the notes that I had written down so
[9:00] God bless you each one today as we as we
[9:03] fellowship with the Lord I trust you are
[9:06] well fed
[9:07] out of John chapter 11 today
[9:10] just like to start with verse 1.
[9:14] let's take a little bit of time I trust
[9:15] we're okay today for some time
[9:18] John chapter 11. we'll start with verse
[9:21] 1. now a certain man was sick named
[9:23] Lazarus of Bethany
[9:25] of the town of Mary and her sister
[9:27] Martha
[9:29] and it was that Mary
[9:31] which anointed the Lord with ointment
[9:34] and wiped his feet with her hair
[9:36] whose brother Lazarus was sick
[9:40] just want to remind us
[9:43] this is the one
[9:46] this is the one that understood
[9:48] how to greet Jesus
[9:50] how to appreciate his presence
[9:53] and remember how the prophet brought
[9:56] how clearly we need to recognize when we
[9:59] gather together like this
[10:01] we don't want to invite him here to just
[10:02] sit in a corner and say God bless you we
[10:05] had Jesus in our midst we want to anoint
[10:08] him
[10:09] we want to welcome him we want to hear
[10:12] from him we want him to be appreciated
[10:14] and you know if we do that then he will
[10:17] bless us
[10:18] and you know this is a historical
[10:20] account of what already happened and
[10:23] look at how he comes and blesses her
[10:26] imagine if we don't appreciate him in
[10:28] our midst we could be down the road and
[10:31] need him
[10:33] but did we appreciate him when we had
[10:35] him
[10:36] it was that Mary which anointed the Lord
[10:39] with ointment and wiped his feet with
[10:41] her hair whose brother Lazarus was sick
[10:44] therefore his sisters sent unto him
[10:47] saying Lord behold he whom thou lovest
[10:50] is sick
[10:52] when Jesus heard that he said this
[10:55] sickness is not unto death but for the
[10:58] glory of God that the Son of God might
[11:01] be glorified thereby
[11:04] now Jesus loved Martha
[11:07] and her sister and Lazarus
[11:10] and when when he had heard therefore
[11:13] that he was sick he Abode two days still
[11:16] in the same place where he was
[11:20] then after that saith he to his
[11:23] disciples let us go into Judea again
[11:26] his disciples say unto him Master the
[11:30] Jews of late sought to stonelee and
[11:32] goest thou tether again Jesus answered
[11:35] are there not 12 hours in a day if any
[11:38] man walk in the day he stumbleth not
[11:41] because he seeth the light of this world
[11:46] but if a man walk in the night he
[11:48] stumbleth because there is no light
[11:50] in him
[11:52] these things said he and after that he
[11:55] saith unto them our friend Lazarus
[11:58] sleepeth
[11:59] but I go that I may awake him out of
[12:03] sleep
[12:04] and said his disciples Lord if he sleep
[12:08] he shall do well how be it Jesus spake
[12:11] of his death but they thought that he
[12:14] had spoken of taking of rest in sleep
[12:18] then said Jesus unto them plainly
[12:21] Lazarus is dead
[12:25] can you imagine Jesus saying this next
[12:26] words and I am glad for your sakes that
[12:31] I was not there
[12:33] to the intent ye may believe
[12:36] nevertheless let us go unto him
[12:40] then saith Thomas which is called
[12:43] didymus unto his fellow disciples let us
[12:46] also go that me we may die with him
[12:50] then when Jesus came he found that he
[12:54] had Lane in the grave four days already
[12:58] let's just bow in prayer
[13:02] gracious Heavenly Father we thank you
[13:04] for your word
[13:05] we know that you are the bread of life
[13:07] and that you have come down from heaven
[13:10] and we know that mankind cannot live on
[13:13] bread alone but by every word that
[13:15] proceedeth out of the mouth of God and
[13:18] Father we believe that each one of these
[13:20] words proceeded out of your mouth and
[13:22] father we just accept them the way that
[13:24] you have given them and we pray Lord
[13:26] that you would just break them open
[13:27] fresh to us once again Lord that we
[13:30] would just grow and and learn and that
[13:33] we would just have a deeper love and a
[13:35] greater relationship with you father we
[13:38] love you and we thank you we just commit
[13:40] all the rest of this service into your
[13:42] hands now in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[13:45] amen
[13:46] God bless you this morning you may be
[13:48] seated
[13:51] for those people who don't know
[13:54] unfortunately our internet is down and
[13:57] it's just the way it is
[14:00] so we'll have to upload the recording
[14:02] later
[14:04] as I understand is it is it still down
[14:07] I think it is still down
[14:10] um unfortunately that's the area of the
[14:12] city that we live in the internet is
[14:14] terrible
[14:16] Lord willing will find a solution for
[14:18] those people who stream and uh
[14:21] and whatnot that join us that way
[14:25] um
[14:27] yesterday
[14:28] we
[14:32] we had the funeral for sister Tina
[14:36] and I think it's uh
[14:38] it's a very sad time and we have to
[14:42] say farewell to one of our
[14:44] beloved
[14:46] one of our brothers one of our sisters
[14:48] when someone gets called home by the
[14:49] Lord it is very difficult for us here
[14:51] and today I just want to maybe
[14:56] expound upon what we talked about
[14:58] yesterday
[15:00] we had the funeral and I took from from
[15:02] this scripture and they gave me a space
[15:05] of time to to speak and and I was
[15:07] honored to be able to
[15:10] to do that
[15:11] and there was people there at the
[15:13] funeral which we see at just about every
[15:15] funeral even when it's a Believer
[15:17] there's people from all walks of life
[15:20] but something excuse me I think
[15:22] something happened in that in that time
[15:24] in that moment everyone came together in
[15:27] one mind and one Accord it was an
[15:29] amazing time
[15:31] and I took from John chapter 11 the
[15:34] scripture that we're going to get into
[15:35] and uh The Story of Lazarus
[15:39] and and we're not expecting to see
[15:41] sister Tina raised from the grave that's
[15:43] not where I'm going with this at all
[15:45] um if I had to make a title I would say
[15:48] I am the resurrection
[15:50] and the life
[15:52] not just the resurrection because you
[15:55] know many people can be raised from the
[15:57] dead and they'll still die again in this
[16:00] world in this flesh but we have to have
[16:02] the life
[16:04] and and that's really what I want to
[16:06] expound upon today but I just want to go
[16:09] over sort of what we talked about a
[16:10] little bit about yesterday and and maybe
[16:12] really preach it today if that's okay
[16:14] you know the group yesterday they gave
[16:16] me a little space of time and I I I just
[16:19] barely got started with what I had in
[16:21] store and I wasn't sure how much time
[16:23] there would be and uh there's never
[16:24] enough time I guess when you're a
[16:26] preacher once upon a time I thought how
[16:28] could I ever stand to be at the pulpit
[16:31] for half an hour or 40 minutes or an
[16:33] hour and now it seems I feel pressured
[16:35] to to shut up so we'll just see what the
[16:38] Lord does today
[16:40] you know in our scripture
[16:42] um if we just carry on I didn't want to
[16:44] keep us standing we'll just pick up from
[16:46] from verse 14. I just think it's amazing
[16:49] maybe we'll just go back and read verse
[16:50] 4 before we go too far I just want to
[16:52] sort of bring this to light here verse 4
[16:54] of chapter 11 of John when Jesus heard
[16:57] that he's that he said that Lazarus was
[17:01] sick when Jesus heard that he said the
[17:03] sickness is not unto death but for the
[17:05] glory of God
[17:07] that the Son of God might be glorified
[17:09] thereby
[17:10] I think it's amazing when we look at
[17:12] this because as Believers today
[17:13] sometimes we think you know I I I know
[17:17] as Believers today we look at it and we
[17:19] say every single sickness is from the
[17:21] devil and we had a prophet very clearly
[17:22] lay that out for our for us it wasn't
[17:25] God that put this sickness on Lazarus it
[17:27] was the devil that put the sickness on
[17:29] Lazarus but only because God said you
[17:32] can do it and it's going to be for my
[17:33] glory that's the only reason you can do
[17:36] this and I'm going to allow you to do it
[17:38] but God doesn't put a sickness on
[17:39] anybody I think it's very important to
[17:41] recognize that but here we have God in
[17:44] flesh in Jesus Christ the the man
[17:47] walking on Earth saying this sickness is
[17:50] not unto death but for the glory of God
[17:53] a sickness can be for the glory of God
[17:56] are you serious this is God's word this
[17:59] is what God is saying this isn't just a
[18:01] disciples interpretation or a prophet's
[18:03] meaning this is what God is saying the
[18:06] sickness is not unto death but for the
[18:08] glory of God that the son of God might
[18:10] be glorified thereby I think that's a
[18:13] beautiful statement don't you that God
[18:15] would speak those words because many
[18:18] times we see afflictions come on our
[18:19] lives come into our our our groups and
[18:23] our circumstances and our situations can
[18:25] be terrible
[18:26] but take hope brothers and sisters take
[18:29] courage because the only reason it's
[18:31] happening is so that it can be for the
[18:33] glory of God
[18:34] it's not so that we can be destroyed
[18:36] it's so that we can magnify the Lord and
[18:38] say you know the reason this is
[18:40] happening is because you first allowed
[18:42] it to happen to me
[18:44] and if you're allowing it to happen to
[18:46] me there's something you want to see
[18:47] come out of me there's a character that
[18:50] you're going to squeeze out of me and
[18:52] it's going to change me I'm not going to
[18:54] be the same person that I was there's no
[18:57] way that Mary and Martha and all of the
[19:00] other believers were the same people
[19:01] after his resurrection
[19:05] especially Lazarus
[19:08] but then verse 14 then said Jesus unto
[19:11] them plainly Lazarus is dead
[19:13] I want you to understand he says to them
[19:15] I understand the situation full well I
[19:18] might be sounding like I'm speaking in
[19:21] Parables but let's just get right down
[19:23] to the the rubber meets the road let's
[19:24] get to the Brass tax he's dead
[19:27] his life has left him corruption has set
[19:29] in but but as the son of man stands
[19:32] before you now I'm going to show you who
[19:34] you're really dealing with here
[19:36] verse 15 and I'm glad for your sakes
[19:38] that I was not there
[19:40] to the intent that ye may believe
[19:42] nevertheless let us go unto him
[19:45] what a tremendous tremendous thought
[19:48] he wanted them to know that he was dead
[19:51] he wanted Lazarus to be good and dead
[19:55] but isn't it wonderful to think that
[19:57] Lazarus Soul could never go too far
[19:59] brother Branham talks about how his soul
[20:01] was gone for four days
[20:03] where did his soul go but it was never
[20:05] Out Of Reach for God because his soul
[20:08] was right there in his hand wasn't it
[20:10] verse 16 then said said Thomas which is
[20:14] called didymus unto his fellow disciples
[20:16] let us go off so that we may die with
[20:18] him totally not understanding totally
[20:20] doubting right he's the one that said
[20:23] unless I I see the the hands and and
[20:26] thrust my hand into his side I won't
[20:28] believe
[20:29] when the girls came back and said you
[20:31] know what the grave is empty they said
[20:33] it was probably Thomas that said it oh
[20:35] it's just an idol Tale
[20:36] even though that's what he said would
[20:38] happen
[20:39] it's amazing
[20:41] verse 17 then when Jesus came he found
[20:44] that he had Lain in the grave four days
[20:47] already
[20:49] now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem
[20:51] about 15 furlongs off
[20:54] and many of the Jews came to Martha and
[20:56] Mary to comfort them concerning their
[20:58] brother
[21:00] then Martha as soon as she heard that
[21:02] Jesus was coming went and met him but
[21:05] Mary sat still in the house
[21:08] then said Martha unto Jesus Lord
[21:12] if thou Hat's been here my brother had
[21:14] not died
[21:16] remember verse 4.
[21:18] I I didn't come because if I did
[21:22] actually it was verse 15. sorry I'm glad
[21:25] for your sakes that I didn't come
[21:26] because if I did then you wouldn't
[21:27] believe
[21:28] but now you're going to be able to
[21:30] believe
[21:32] I keep jumping around I apologize verse
[21:34] 21 then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if
[21:36] thou Hat's been here my brother had not
[21:38] died
[21:39] but I know that even now whosoever thou
[21:42] Wilt ask of God
[21:44] will give it thee
[21:46] Jesus saith unto her thy brother shall
[21:49] rise again
[21:51] Martha saith unto him I know that he
[21:54] shall rise again in the resurrection at
[21:56] the last day
[21:58] Jesus said unto her
[22:00] I am the resurrection and the life
[22:04] he that believeth in me though he were
[22:07] dead
[22:08] yet shall he live
[22:11] and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[22:14] shall never die
[22:16] believeth thou this
[22:19] and we know the story very well I I
[22:22] could go on I don't really want to read
[22:25] the whole chapter we know that Jesus
[22:27] went and and and walked right up there
[22:30] and the people were mourning there was a
[22:32] time of of real mourning and lamenting
[22:35] because they missed their brother
[22:37] they missed him they loved him and and
[22:40] he was dead he was truly gone
[22:43] but what an opportunity to see God
[22:46] glorified in their midst to see God
[22:49] glorified in their lives but what he was
[22:52] doing brothers and sisters was setting
[22:54] an example
[22:55] an enzyme that there will come a day
[22:58] where there will be a resurrection
[23:01] where the graves will open and the dead
[23:04] will come first
[23:06] and we which are alive and remain shall
[23:09] be caught up to meet with them in the
[23:10] clouds
[23:12] but in the meantime
[23:14] there's another part of that scripture I
[23:16] am the resurrection and the life
[23:20] and this is where I want to dwell today
[23:22] I'm going to keep sort of laboring on
[23:24] that part I am the life I just want to
[23:28] talk about sister Tina for a moment and
[23:30] I think it's such a beautiful thing when
[23:33] we have testimonies brothers and sisters
[23:35] how important it is to have testimonies
[23:38] I want to say this too in a carnal way
[23:41] if you love someone take the time to
[23:43] tell them that you love them
[23:46] if you love someone take the time to
[23:48] tell them that you love them put your
[23:50] arm around them and get your picture
[23:51] taken with them
[23:53] smile with them it'll bring you comfort
[23:57] because you know one of these days if
[23:59] God doesn't call The Rapture and we go
[24:02] in the sky we're going to go in the
[24:04] grave and we're going to have a time of
[24:06] mourning there's going to be a hole in
[24:09] our lives a whole in our hearts that can
[24:11] never be filled on this side of Eternity
[24:14] that's the way God created it and we
[24:17] know that was instituted in the Garden
[24:19] of Eden by the choice of man another man
[24:21] not us
[24:22] but another man chose that because he
[24:25] loved his bride
[24:26] his wife was deceived she was a part of
[24:29] him and he loved her so much
[24:32] that he was willing to step out from his
[24:34] position as a fully adopted son of God
[24:36] as the one that was created without a
[24:39] belly button the Son of God Adam loved
[24:43] his bride so much that he said I
[24:45] understand what I'm going to forsake
[24:48] but I'm going out after her because I
[24:50] love her
[24:51] I'm willing to die because he knew that
[24:53] was the consequences of following her
[24:57] we know we've probably heard it many
[24:59] times that he could have said no I need
[25:01] another one this one's tainted
[25:03] give me another one Lord but he didn't
[25:07] because God knew exactly how he would
[25:09] behave because he created man in his own
[25:11] image
[25:12] knowing that that was an example of what
[25:15] Christ would do and here we have Christ
[25:16] now coming to demonstrate there will be
[25:19] a resurrection but there's got to be a
[25:21] life the only way there's going to be a
[25:23] resurrection is to demonstrate that life
[25:25] in our lives and our life isn't enough
[25:28] brothers and sisters it's got to be his
[25:30] life it's got to be that word that we
[25:32] sang about he he sent his word are we
[25:34] willing to accept that word if we're not
[25:37] willing to accept that word then we're
[25:38] not going to be able to have his life
[25:40] there's only one way we're going to have
[25:42] his life
[25:43] sister Tina she wrote some testimonies
[25:45] out and gave them to us and and and I
[25:48] just want to read one of them today
[25:49] because I think that even though she has
[25:51] gone to the Grave this voice speaks out
[25:54] from the grave it speaks Beyond it it's
[25:58] a life it's the testimony of a real
[26:00] believer she says Shalom people of God I
[26:03] would like to thank the Lord for this
[26:04] opportunity he gives me to be with you
[26:06] again today
[26:08] this is a believing sister who had to
[26:11] deal with sickness and I apologize I've
[26:12] read this before some people might be
[26:14] saying grown brother Barry you're doing
[26:15] this again if you are just bear with me
[26:17] but if if you you're not and and you
[26:19] understand what I'm trying to get to
[26:21] today remember that this is a sister
[26:22] that is now in glory imagine what she's
[26:25] saying imagine what she's thinking whose
[26:27] hands are she shaking how many people's
[26:29] necks have she hugged all the time since
[26:32] she's been gone now
[26:34] she says I would like to thank the Lord
[26:35] for this opportunity he gives me to be
[26:37] with you again today this is a privilege
[26:41] brothers and sisters to gather together
[26:42] on this side of Eternity she said I
[26:45] spend a month and a half in the hospital
[26:47] heart failure the diagnosis was very bad
[26:51] dramatic I was on the verge of death
[26:54] but despite the seriousness of the
[26:57] situation I clung to the promises of God
[27:02] reminding him what he said about me
[27:10] I think it's so beautiful
[27:12] what do you say about you brothers and
[27:14] sisters
[27:15] do we know what he said about us
[27:18] I think it's so good if we can just take
[27:20] the time to go back and and remind
[27:22] ourselves about what he said about us
[27:26] and then we can remind him about what he
[27:29] said about us
[27:30] there's nothing more powerful than for a
[27:32] child to say but daddy do you remember
[27:34] what you said to me
[27:36] when a child can remind his parents of
[27:39] their word oh my it's enough to melt a
[27:41] parent's heart
[27:45] despite the seriousness of the situation
[27:47] I clung to the promises of God reminding
[27:49] him what he said about me a list of what
[27:53] God Said was necessary for me so that
[27:56] each time when I was in too much pain or
[27:59] doubt or medical team with his report
[28:04] I had to remind God what he said I think
[28:08] this is beautiful
[28:10] it makes me want to make a checklist
[28:12] myself
[28:13] when I start to hear the doctor's report
[28:16] when I start to hear the other stuff
[28:18] going on when I get down in my spirit
[28:21] maybe when I get sick in my body when
[28:23] when I need to just remind myself
[28:26] sometimes it's good just to have a quick
[28:28] checklist just to go over and just say
[28:30] wow this this this this
[28:36] I had to remind God what he said
[28:38] I say God you said
[28:42] I love this part daddy you said
[28:46] again and again
[28:48] that way I can hold on
[28:51] I would like to thank all of you who
[28:53] have prayed for me or showed your
[28:55] kindness to me
[28:58] this is Sister Tina saying it to you
[29:00] today if you've ever prayed for her she
[29:02] would like to thank you
[29:04] but now she doesn't need our prayers
[29:06] she's in glory
[29:09] what a tremendous thing
[29:12] for
[29:13] oh I'll just read it again I would like
[29:15] to thank all of you who have prayed for
[29:16] me or showed your kindness to me
[29:19] even a lovely family here send money to
[29:21] me may God richly bless them also
[29:24] and sister Joy sister Sharon's mom from
[29:27] Edmonton may God bless her
[29:30] a nice sister a woman of faith
[29:33] she called me to encourage me every day
[29:36] now I'm getting better and better every
[29:39] day
[29:40] I can say now God you did it
[29:43] God bless you all praise the Lord sister
[29:46] Tina
[29:47] sorry for the poor English
[29:50] this testimony came out last year
[29:53] and so some might say well where is she
[29:56] now she's in the grave isn't she yeah
[29:58] her body is in the grave
[30:01] but she's with the Lord
[30:04] and you know one way or another we've
[30:06] got to go
[30:07] we know that Paul said to live as Christ
[30:10] that's that's the testimony of the
[30:12] believer to live as Christ it doesn't
[30:13] matter what the doctor's report says I'm
[30:15] going to hold to the promises of God but
[30:17] hey to die is to gain that that means
[30:19] that I'm no longer dealing with any of
[30:21] the problems here I I step from time
[30:23] back into eternity and I get my
[30:25] theophany body I'm never going to be
[30:27] sick I'm never going to be tired I'm
[30:28] never going to be sad I'm never going to
[30:29] be frustrated I'm never going to be
[30:31] confused I'm never going to be angry
[30:33] never going to have to deal with any of
[30:34] the things that we have to deal with in
[30:36] this body here
[30:40] I'm saying all this to say maybe it's
[30:43] not such a bad thing to pass away
[30:46] when you're a believer
[30:48] when we know where we're going to go
[30:51] we need to know where we're going to go
[30:53] because One Way Or Another We're going
[30:55] to go there's no promise for us when we
[30:57] go out this door today as we heard what
[30:59] was it last weekend or the weekend
[31:01] before it was last weekend wasn't it the
[31:04] livesies we certainly thanked the Lord
[31:05] for watching over them
[31:08] one block from the church right after
[31:10] service the devil takes his agents and
[31:14] crashes into their van
[31:16] wrecks their van gives them injuries one
[31:18] block from church
[31:21] talked about it before brothers and
[31:23] sisters I personally believe it and I
[31:24] like to just explain it the way that I
[31:27] visualize it I think the Lord shows me
[31:29] is I think his angels we know that he
[31:31] has his angels encamped about those who
[31:33] fear Him but I like to make it a little
[31:35] more graphic to think that that trailer
[31:37] and truck that crashed into their van it
[31:39] was God's angels that just lubricated
[31:42] them to pass by and it was only the van
[31:44] that was really hurt
[31:46] they sustained some injuries from it but
[31:48] what could it have been
[31:51] I want to say that was the hand of God
[31:53] in their life we have reason to rejoice
[31:58] we're certainly thankful to see them
[32:01] being able to serve the Lord
[32:06] almost seems like as soon as they took a
[32:08] step forward to play here
[32:10] the devil's had an onslaught
[32:13] but we know that God's in control
[32:16] how many are going to pray for the
[32:17] livesies
[32:20] just hold them up in prayer just just
[32:22] ask the Lord to continue to watch over
[32:24] them
[32:25] that's why we have a body of Believers
[32:27] so we can pray one for another we can
[32:29] confess our faults one to another and
[32:31] pray for one another that we might be
[32:32] healed that's why we come to church
[32:35] brothers and sisters to be a part of the
[32:37] body
[32:40] all right
[32:41] certainly thankful for the life of
[32:42] sister Tina
[32:44] going through kovitz she had so many
[32:46] encouraging words for me she she phoned
[32:49] me and would encourage me and and it
[32:52] just surprised me because I knew that
[32:53] she was sick at the times that she was
[32:55] calling me to encourage me and I'm I'm
[32:57] I'd say you know relatively speaking
[33:00] perfectly healthy but yet I've got
[33:02] someone who is ill calling to encourage
[33:04] me what a testimony I would say that is
[33:07] the life of the Resurrection in the
[33:09] sister and that truly is our our our
[33:12] Anchor Point we have the ability to to
[33:15] just see that life live out through each
[33:17] one of ours
[33:19] I got ahead of myself here got excited I
[33:21] apologize we've got some announcements
[33:23] um Andrew brother Andrew Glover will be
[33:25] here next weekend and uh we're certainly
[33:27] excited to see what the Lord has in
[33:29] store for that we have the Youth Event
[33:31] on the 18th of this month we have a
[33:33] ladies brunch on the 26th I believe and
[33:36] we have a potluck Fellowship after
[33:38] service on the 27th for those people who
[33:40] are able to attend it certainly is a
[33:42] time a wonderful time of Fellowship
[33:45] and we trust that each one will be
[33:47] blessed are you happy this morning
[33:51] we have uh Saint John 11.
[33:54] verse 26 I just think it's a beautiful
[33:57] thought whosoever liveth
[34:00] and believeth in me shall never die
[34:02] believe thou this
[34:04] believe us thou this you know brother
[34:06] Branham preaches the service believeth
[34:09] though this and he takes this text and
[34:11] and talks about being uh you know
[34:14] Lazarus being raised from the dead and
[34:16] you know we have we have this this
[34:19] situation the story that we're talking
[34:21] about this morning where Jesus is called
[34:24] on the scene but he doesn't turn up
[34:26] right when he's called and I think it's
[34:28] such an important part of the believer's
[34:31] life to recognize the believer's life in
[34:35] Christ is not formulated after meta
[34:40] it's not formed after skip the dishes
[34:42] it's not formed after McDonald's it's
[34:45] not formed after any kind of man's
[34:47] thinking or ideas
[34:50] this world that we live in is created
[34:53] according to the tree of knowledge of
[34:55] Good and Evil
[34:56] brother Branham says it very clearly
[34:58] rather God says it very clearly through
[35:00] brother Branham that this is Satan's
[35:03] Eden
[35:04] all civilization is created for Satan
[35:09] it's Satan's kingdom
[35:11] and you know God is not going to conform
[35:15] to Satan's kingdom there was no other
[35:17] age where where Satan was called the god
[35:21] of the age except for this age that we
[35:23] live in right now
[35:24] this is Satan's Ed and this is Satan's
[35:26] kingdom and God doesn't answer the way
[35:29] that Satan is training man to look for
[35:32] answers God is Not on speed dial
[35:36] all we have to do is speak our voice
[35:39] God hears it
[35:41] his ears are always open to our prayers
[35:44] but he's going to answer our prayers in
[35:46] his time
[35:47] and he's going to do it in his way
[35:50] it's not going to be our way it's not
[35:52] going to be Hollywood's way it's not
[35:55] going to be according to music or movies
[35:57] or the way that maybe traditionally we
[35:59] think it should be we can jump up and
[36:01] down and scream and shout while we pray
[36:03] and that's not going to cause God to
[36:05] move any sooner or be any later
[36:08] the only thing that's going to move God
[36:10] is Faith in his word being able to
[36:13] believe
[36:14] if we can do that then we're going to
[36:17] see something happen the only way that's
[36:19] going to happen is for that Resurrection
[36:21] to happen in our lives
[36:24] for him to resurrect in our life and
[36:26] when that happens brothers and sisters
[36:28] we're going to have a testimony that we
[36:29] live not that we talk about talk is
[36:32] cheap saying that I'm a Christian I
[36:33] believe the message God sent a prophet
[36:35] all of that is great but can we live it
[36:38] if we can't live it then what we're
[36:40] doing is sending a mixed signal and I
[36:42] would say God have mercy on our souls if
[36:45] we're going to live in this world and
[36:46] claim the message of the hour and give a
[36:48] mixed signal to people wanting to know
[36:50] Christianity
[36:51] oh you have wonderful services and and
[36:54] you're such a fine person in church but
[36:57] I can't do a business deal with you
[36:59] because you're going to skin me I know
[37:00] it
[37:01] or maybe you gotta temper like a buzz
[37:03] saw
[37:04] you know what we can all live in this
[37:07] world we live in this Human Condition
[37:08] but when we live in this Human Condition
[37:10] the life of that Resurrection is going
[37:13] to come forward and it's going to right
[37:14] the wrongs
[37:16] we're not just going to sweep it under
[37:18] the rug
[37:20] that's the difference
[37:21] that's the only difference
[37:23] the believer is going to say my
[37:27] I'm wrong
[37:28] I'm sorry
[37:30] will you forgive me
[37:32] and you know one of the biggest
[37:33] deceptions in this world even around the
[37:35] message of the hours for people to say
[37:36] you weren't sincere how do you know
[37:39] how do you know your brother your sister
[37:41] is not sincere it's not between you and
[37:43] them it's between them and God at that
[37:45] point if they've come according to the
[37:46] word of God
[37:49] I say Lord help me to be sincere help me
[37:53] to receive the the Forgiveness when
[37:56] people forgive me and help me to have
[37:59] the Forgiveness back to people
[38:01] we live in this Human Condition
[38:03] and isn't it amazing that song that we
[38:05] sang I am the Lord
[38:08] that sent my word
[38:10] to heal our disease
[38:12] sometimes our disease isn't just uh it's
[38:15] not just something that's that's that's
[38:17] destroying our flesh
[38:19] it's not something that's actually
[38:20] taking us down to the Grave sometimes
[38:22] it's mental sometimes we got something
[38:24] wrong with our brains brothers and
[38:26] sisters sometimes there's some
[38:28] short-circuited wiring inside there and
[38:31] Satan loves it that way he'll take it
[38:33] and make it his playground we have
[38:35] illness in the flesh and we have illness
[38:37] in the mind both illnesses but we know
[38:40] that he sent his word to heal our
[38:42] disease
[38:43] and all we have to do is say Amen to
[38:46] that word we just need to say be it unto
[38:47] me according to Thy word you have sent
[38:49] your word I have accepted it and now I
[38:52] can see that Resurrection coming forth
[38:54] in my life and it's causing a life to
[38:55] live out through me
[38:59] this flesh is going to go to the Grave
[39:00] if we don't go to the sky it's got to
[39:03] happen but you know the believer he's
[39:04] going to say Amen you know what if
[39:06] that's the way the Lord wants it to be
[39:07] then that's the way it's going to be and
[39:09] and maybe he's done with me maybe he's
[39:11] used me maybe I've fulfilled the purpose
[39:13] of my life
[39:15] we know we we read that that scripture
[39:17] in yesterday in in Sister Tina's funeral
[39:20] it's second Timothy 4 7 I fought the
[39:23] good fight
[39:24] I've finished the race
[39:27] I've kept the faith
[39:29] sometimes in our lives that's what
[39:31] happens
[39:32] and God takes us home and when he does
[39:35] that it's no accident
[39:37] we've done what we're supposed to do
[39:39] God doesn't ring his hands and say oh my
[39:42] there's an emergency there's an accident
[39:43] something has happened we need to get a
[39:45] special counsel together and get the
[39:47] angels to go and investigate what
[39:49] happened and and have a big
[39:50] investigation no everything happens
[39:52] because God said so
[39:54] otherwise he's not God
[39:59] and we have the ability to say Amen to
[40:01] to believe that to recognize that he he
[40:03] is allowed it to happen that way for a
[40:05] purpose we don't know many times what
[40:07] the purpose is but by and by we will
[40:11] you know this death that we have to
[40:12] contend with it it entered in the human
[40:15] race back in Genesis verse chapter 2
[40:17] verse 16. I'll just read it for the sake
[40:20] of time and the Lord God commanded the
[40:23] man saying of every tree of the garden
[40:25] thou mayest freely eat but of the tree
[40:27] of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt
[40:29] not eat of it for in the day thou eatest
[40:32] thereof Thou shalt surely die
[40:36] you're gonna die if you do it
[40:39] but here we have the situation the
[40:41] circumstance we talked about it earlier
[40:43] Adam had a wife that was taken from his
[40:45] side the very first surgery that was
[40:47] ever performed was God
[40:48] taking Eve out of Adam she wasn't
[40:51] created as a separate being
[40:53] she was created from him
[40:56] brother Branham called her a byproduct
[40:58] meaning a part of him
[41:01] not just a leftover piece of waste
[41:03] sometimes people can treat their wives
[41:04] that way and that's false that's wrong
[41:08] but she she was a part of him and he
[41:10] loved her so much
[41:12] that he was willing to leave his first
[41:14] estate
[41:16] he was willing to forget
[41:18] what it was like to live in the garden
[41:22] and we know that he took her he stepped
[41:25] down
[41:26] and went after his bride
[41:29] because she was deceived
[41:31] we know that Adam wasn't deceived
[41:34] but here we go
[41:37] thousands of years later
[41:40] the promise that God knew in the back of
[41:43] his mind before the foundation of the
[41:44] world his plan was coming to fruition so
[41:47] he could actually manifest the
[41:49] attributes that were inside of him
[41:52] that were in his thoughts before there
[41:54] ever was a sun moon or Stars before
[41:55] there is even Stardust he knew that Adam
[41:58] would take his bride he knew that she
[42:00] would fall he knew that he would follow
[42:02] her because of the love that love wasn't
[42:04] something that Adam just had and that he
[42:06] found somewhere along the way that he
[42:08] was taught somehow that someone
[42:10] explained to him that was a love that
[42:12] was given to him because he was the son
[42:14] of God
[42:15] that was God's Own love that manifested
[42:18] in Adam to go out after his bride
[42:22] and here we have Jesus on the scene
[42:25] thousands of years later and I want to
[42:27] say not just Jesus as a second or third
[42:30] person many times we can look at it that
[42:32] way let's just say it this way here we
[42:34] have God manifested in the flesh coming
[42:37] down now and and recognizing
[42:39] fellowshipping with his Brethren and
[42:41] saying to them you know what I'm glad I
[42:43] didn't go down there because you guys
[42:45] wouldn't necessarily believe but I know
[42:47] because I am the one who created
[42:49] everything from the beginning I know
[42:52] that you will now believe when you see
[42:55] it for yourself
[42:57] and here we have Jesus telling them that
[43:00] I am
[43:01] the resurrection and the life who could
[43:03] say that for those people that want to
[43:05] say Jesus wasn't God who could raise
[43:07] someone from the dead who could declare
[43:09] I am the resurrection and the life
[43:13] there's only one
[43:15] there's only one that could ever claim
[43:17] that
[43:19] I think it's so beautiful how we have
[43:22] this this story verse 20 then Martha as
[43:25] soon as she heard that Jesus was coming
[43:26] when and met with him but Mary sat still
[43:29] in the house then said Martha unto Jesus
[43:32] Lord if thou had been here my brother
[43:34] had not died
[43:37] but I know
[43:39] that even now
[43:41] whatsoever thou Wilt ask of God God will
[43:44] give it thee
[43:46] not recognizing that she's speaking to
[43:48] God
[43:50] whatever you decide to do
[43:53] will happen
[43:57] Jesus say It unto her thy brother shall
[44:01] rise again Martha said unto him I know
[44:03] that he shall rise again at the
[44:04] resurrection of the last day Jesus saith
[44:06] unto her I am the resurrection and the
[44:09] life he that believeth in me though he
[44:12] were dead yet shall he live and
[44:16] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[44:18] shall never die believeth thou this
[44:22] isn't it wonderful how he poses the
[44:25] question at the end he says whoever
[44:27] believes in me you'll never die even
[44:30] though you're dead in your sin in your
[44:31] trespasses
[44:32] if you believe in me you'll never die
[44:34] that's not even going to be possible
[44:37] and that's where I think as a Believer
[44:39] we have the ability to recognize
[44:41] to live as Christ to die is gain
[44:45] what would happen if we had no fear in
[44:47] our lives
[44:48] what could we do what could we
[44:50] accomplish if we had no fear if we had
[44:51] no Financial fear we could just get into
[44:54] whatever Adventure we want to and just
[44:56] go for it and you'll never fail
[44:58] financially you'll just be blessed
[45:00] you'll have all the money you want all
[45:01] you got to do is just go to the bank and
[45:03] just take money out as much as you want
[45:06] do as many wire transfers as you desire
[45:08] whatever you want to do
[45:10] or or maybe an education you could just
[45:12] go and get whatever degree you want as
[45:14] many of them as you want
[45:18] I just think it's amazing when we think
[45:20] about that because we have that level
[45:23] of of of gift given to us but it's just
[45:27] not tangible according to this world
[45:31] we have more than any of that
[45:33] because all of that is this world's
[45:35] riches this world's wealth this world's
[45:38] knowledge
[45:39] but to think about what it's going to be
[45:41] like on the other side where sister Tina
[45:44] is right now
[45:45] I apologize if this is kind of like a
[45:47] funeral I don't want to make it like a
[45:48] funeral I want to make this a
[45:49] celebration of life because she had that
[45:52] Resurrection in her and she was able to
[45:55] have that life that's what sustained her
[45:57] to write these testimonies and that's
[46:00] why I want to talk about it today as
[46:01] soon as I heard that she was sick in the
[46:03] hospital I went to see her just hours
[46:05] before she passed away I saw her hands
[46:07] folded in the casket and I thought thank
[46:09] you Lord I was able to hold her hand and
[46:12] just pray with her and just commit her
[46:14] life into your care Lord just to think
[46:17] that she was just moments away from
[46:19] stepping over into Glory
[46:22] my
[46:23] you know when she was there in the room
[46:25] just hours before she passed away she
[46:28] kept wanting to get up and walk and and
[46:31] the nurse kept saying no you you you you
[46:33] can't really get up and walk and she was
[46:36] connected to the machine and I don't
[46:37] know she had lots of tubes and and
[46:39] machines and everything go in there and
[46:41] and her daughter said no you you can't
[46:43] get up and walk mom you have to stay and
[46:46] so they sat her up and she just wasn't
[46:48] comfortable she was ready to go is what
[46:51] I could see she wanted to get moving she
[46:53] was tired of what was going on there
[46:55] I just think it was an amazing thing to
[46:58] see her she knew that Resurrection
[47:00] because she had that life it was a part
[47:02] of who she was
[47:04] you know out of 1964 then Jesus came and
[47:08] called at 640213
[47:12] we've got a few quotes today
[47:15] it's paragraph 62
[47:19] and he said I am the resurrection and
[47:23] the life
[47:25] though he were dead
[47:27] yet shall he live
[47:30] and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[47:33] shall never die I am that's the I am
[47:36] that was in the burning bush with Moses
[47:41] I just think it's beautiful and and I I
[47:44] could dwell there for a little while but
[47:45] I just want to make sure that we don't
[47:47] have any different IMs I want to make
[47:50] sure that we understand that Jesus
[47:51] Christ standing in the flesh was not the
[47:53] first person the second person or the
[47:55] third person of any Trinity he was God
[47:58] himself and we have brother Branham
[48:01] saying that he was the exact same I am
[48:03] in that Burning Bush when he was going
[48:06] down to Pharaoh's house
[48:09] it wasn't just Moses standing there I am
[48:12] said let my people go that was I am in
[48:15] that man standing there saying that
[48:17] declaring it he was donating his voice
[48:20] and his body but brother Branham says
[48:22] that's the I am that was in the burning
[48:24] bush with Moses I am the resurrection I
[48:27] am the life I was the wall I am still he
[48:30] I am the resurrection and the life he
[48:33] that believeth in me though he were dead
[48:34] yet shall he live
[48:36] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[48:38] shall never die
[48:42] I think the believer can see that
[48:44] remember we read beyond the curtain of
[48:46] time
[48:47] if anybody didn't hear it or or didn't
[48:50] see it or maybe you just haven't thought
[48:52] about it for a little while just look it
[48:53] up beyond the curtain of time or just
[48:55] text me if you don't know I'd be happy
[48:57] to send it to you brother Branham gives
[48:59] that graphic description of what it's
[49:01] like beyond the curtain of time and he
[49:03] said there's only one thing that's going
[49:05] to make it there and that only one thing
[49:07] that's going to make it there is perfect
[49:09] love that's charity that's Jesus Christ
[49:12] the man himself I am living out through
[49:15] us the resurrection and the life living
[49:18] out through us that perfect love is
[49:20] Jesus Christ himself
[49:22] it's not a bunch of different intangible
[49:25] things we could say it's the Holy Ghost
[49:27] and we could say that it's charity it's
[49:29] all the same thing it's Jesus Christ I
[49:31] am God's own life Elohim living out
[49:35] through us whosoever liveth and
[49:37] believeth in me shall never die after
[49:39] this great assurance that she had that
[49:42] he was the promised word when he said
[49:45] being a prophet he could not lie
[49:47] therefore he when he said I am the I am
[49:51] I am
[49:53] he that is the resurrection and the life
[49:57] I just think this story is amazing to
[50:00] think God in flesh Elohim standing there
[50:04] in the body of a human being created in
[50:07] a perfect conception the sieging of God
[50:11] connecting with an egg of God inside a
[50:15] borrowed womb of Mary Mary and Joseph
[50:18] having nothing to do with it except for
[50:19] one person a virgin to his word through
[50:22] the messenger through that angel
[50:24] messenger she was a virgin to that word
[50:26] because she said hey just be it unto me
[50:28] according to Thy word I don't understand
[50:30] it but I believe it
[50:32] and what happened that that being that
[50:35] started
[50:36] was the Holy Ghost
[50:38] the son of the Holy Ghost and that's why
[50:40] people have so much confusion they want
[50:42] to try and tie it all together and make
[50:43] it a trinitarian thing you know what it
[50:45] was the power of the highest that came
[50:47] over Mary and that's what happened it
[50:49] was Jesus Christ that came from her womb
[50:51] and it's the same thing for the Bride of
[50:53] Jesus Christ today when the human being
[50:55] recognizes the word given through an
[50:57] angel messenger and she just says I
[50:59] don't understand it I don't I really
[51:00] don't get it
[51:02] but I believe it
[51:04] something happens there's a spiritual
[51:06] conception when that moment happens
[51:08] brothers and sisters it causes that
[51:10] person to become a virgin to the word
[51:12] it's not a virgin in our flesh in our
[51:14] bodies in in our minds it's to the word
[51:17] in our heart
[51:20] meaning there's nothing else that we
[51:21] want to accept we just want to accept
[51:23] him that life
[51:25] or the Amplified Bible John 11 25 and 26
[51:28] Jesus said unto her I am myself the
[51:32] resurrection and the life whosoever
[51:34] believes in adheres to trust sin and
[51:39] relies on me
[51:42] although he may die yet shall he live
[51:45] one of these days
[51:47] we could go into the grave
[51:49] we don't know
[51:51] I just think it's so important the only
[51:53] way we're going to get out of the Grave
[51:54] is to recognize that resurrection and
[51:56] life right now the only way that's going
[51:58] to happen is for us to just understand
[51:59] we have to just accept the word for our
[52:01] day and when we do that when we do that
[52:03] we're going to say hey be it unto me
[52:05] according to Thy word and if Thy word
[52:07] says to just repent for our sins get
[52:10] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[52:12] Christ repenting for our sins then we
[52:15] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[52:17] and when we do receive the gift of the
[52:19] Holy Ghost then we have that token in
[52:20] our hand then we know we have that
[52:22] Resurrection in life and you know what I
[52:24] want to say this brothers and sisters
[52:25] you have that Resurrection in life at
[52:27] the moment you say I want to get
[52:29] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[52:31] Christ for the remission of my sins you
[52:33] don't get the Holy Ghost when you come
[52:35] up out of the water you don't see a dove
[52:36] come down you don't see a pillar of fire
[52:38] it doesn't happen that way it's it's a
[52:41] spiritual conception when you say be it
[52:43] unto me according to Thy word you get
[52:45] that gift of the Holy Ghost
[52:48] and you know what it'll start to
[52:49] manifest in many different ways but I
[52:51] want to say the very first way that it
[52:53] will manifest is your willingness to
[52:55] become subject to the word when you say
[52:58] I want to be baptized that's when you
[53:00] can demonstrate that you've got the Holy
[53:02] Ghost because you've got the outward
[53:03] expression of the inward work that's
[53:05] already happening
[53:07] but there's some people that will say no
[53:09] I've been baptized in the name of the
[53:11] father
[53:11] in the name of the son in the name of
[53:13] the Holy Ghost according to the
[53:14] scriptures but you haven't been baptized
[53:16] at all
[53:18] that's what the prophet said because
[53:20] who's the father
[53:21] we can go over this every single time
[53:23] and it might be Elementary but there
[53:24] might be people that don't know this
[53:25] brothers and sisters without the Holy
[53:27] Ghost we're lost as lost can be
[53:29] that's what the prophet said that's what
[53:30] God Said to the prophet to this age
[53:32] without the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we
[53:34] are lost as lost can be that's when
[53:36] we're going to shiver and shake when the
[53:38] doctor says you know what you're gonna
[53:40] die
[53:42] and when you look at him and say oh I
[53:44] don't know whether I got that token I
[53:45] don't know oh there's things in my life
[53:47] there's people I haven't forgiven I've
[53:48] got baggage I've got all these different
[53:50] things oh no I know the message of the
[53:51] hour but now I'm going to lament because
[53:53] I don't know whether I know oh no it's
[53:55] going to turn into a big thing but when
[53:58] you know that you've lived according to
[53:59] the word of God he gives you that report
[54:01] you can say I can never die
[54:04] you can take this body but you can't
[54:06] take my soul because it's not my life
[54:08] living out
[54:10] it's his life
[54:15] out of the Amplified Jesus said unto her
[54:17] I myself the resurrection and the life
[54:20] whoever whosoever whoever sorry believes
[54:23] in adheres to trust in and relies on me
[54:25] though he may die yet he shall live
[54:28] that's what this scripture is saying if
[54:29] we have to lay down this body we're
[54:31] going to raise again brothers and
[54:33] sisters it's going to happen
[54:35] it's just a matter of time but while
[54:37] we're here living I think it's so
[54:39] beautiful we have this testimony sister
[54:41] Tina has now this testimony she's gone
[54:44] to the Grave
[54:46] her body went to the Grave she never
[54:48] went to the Grave
[54:50] she went to heaven
[54:52] she went to be with the Lord and she's
[54:54] going to be there until
[54:57] but you know while we're here we who are
[55:00] alive and remain we've got the ability
[55:02] to comfort one another with these words
[55:04] to recognize that we have a testimony
[55:06] also and we can write our testimonies
[55:09] out we can come and take the opportunity
[55:11] to take the mic when we have a communion
[55:12] service or maybe even just a testimony
[55:14] service and just give God the glory and
[55:16] tell what God has done for us in our
[55:18] lives what he's done for me it's not
[55:19] about anybody else it's what he's done
[55:20] for me I just want to say praise the
[55:22] Lord brothers and sisters as well
[55:23] another opportunity for a testimony I
[55:26] was at the funeral yesterday and I heard
[55:28] a familiar sound and maybe it's not the
[55:31] greatest sound but to hear sister
[55:33] jarmaine come up the the the pathway to
[55:36] come down the aisle walking
[55:38] she's not in a wheelchair we need to
[55:41] give God the glory we've had her on our
[55:43] prayer request we've been praying for
[55:45] sister jarmaine and her family and here
[55:47] they are today they walked in the
[55:49] building
[55:52] he is the resurrection and the life if
[55:56] we can just believe on that
[55:58] just because he takes someone home
[56:00] doesn't mean he has lost any power at
[56:03] all the only thing that's happened is
[56:05] it's his will coming to pass
[56:07] nobody dies by accident
[56:11] verse 26
[56:13] out of the Amplified and whoever
[56:15] continues to live
[56:16] whoever continues to live and believes
[56:19] in has faith in Cleaves to and relies on
[56:24] me shall never actually die at all
[56:28] I think it's so beautiful do you believe
[56:31] this
[56:32] I am the resurrection and the life God
[56:37] himself manifesting to each and every
[56:39] one of the Believers
[56:41] and the word that we hear the message of
[56:43] the hour brothers and sisters just like
[56:45] Lazarus who is dead in the grave did he
[56:48] even have ears to hear
[56:51] could he hear that voice
[56:53] when Jesus cried with a loud voice
[56:54] brother Adam talks about in the message
[56:56] the rapture
[56:57] oddly enough
[56:59] the whole story about Lazarus
[57:02] but could he hear that voice I don't
[57:05] think in his body he could corruption
[57:07] had already said and maybe his eardrum
[57:08] started to dry up and crack maybe there
[57:11] was holes in his eardrums and his body
[57:13] brother Bradham talks about his nose
[57:15] being sunk into his face I don't want to
[57:16] go too graphic but you know what his his
[57:19] physical body was irrelevant because it
[57:21] was the soul that he was calling it
[57:23] wasn't even his own life there's no life
[57:26] on this Earth that's our life brothers
[57:27] and sisters if we've got breath in our
[57:29] lungs it's God's own life living out
[57:31] through us
[57:34] every single breath is a gift from God
[57:36] every time we can bat our eyes every
[57:39] tear we cry every emotion we feel that
[57:42] is a gift from God
[57:45] that might sound crazy but you know
[57:47] brothers and sisters we were created in
[57:49] his own image to actually rule and reign
[57:52] with him not to fall but Adam took that
[57:55] step to bring us into this place so now
[57:57] as soon as he took that step you know I
[57:59] mentioned it before I heard a minister
[58:01] talking about this what was it like for
[58:03] Adam to have that very first adrenaline
[58:06] rush
[58:07] when he heard the voice of God walking
[58:09] in the cool of the evening
[58:11] that very first time that that drug came
[58:15] from his mind it released and just went
[58:17] through his whole entire body what did
[58:20] that feel like it caused fear the very
[58:22] first time he had fear he had Adrenaline
[58:25] Rush he had fear all at the very same
[58:27] time so overwhelming that he hid himself
[58:31] from God
[58:35] but it's the voice
[58:38] I am the resurrection and the life
[58:41] and I just want to try and emphasize
[58:43] that all I can today brothers and
[58:45] sisters I am God
[58:47] is the resurrection his life living out
[58:50] through the individuals
[58:52] and we've been given the opportunity to
[58:54] have the life here
[58:56] on Earth so that we can manifest his
[58:58] life back to him
[59:00] we can give our lives to him brother
[59:02] Bradham says it if you want to live why
[59:04] do you want to live if you want to be
[59:06] healed why do you want to be healed
[59:08] what's the purpose for your healing is
[59:11] it just so that you can live a good life
[59:12] and and and maybe have a little bit of a
[59:15] legacy and then go on or are you wanting
[59:17] to live a good life to serve God
[59:18] according to his word are you wanting to
[59:20] fulfill God's purpose in your life why
[59:22] do we want to be healed
[59:24] as Believers we want to serve God with
[59:27] all of our hearts
[59:28] but you know I I just want to go to a
[59:31] maybe another little bit of a level with
[59:34] all of this and and just say that you
[59:36] know what there was a time of mourning
[59:37] brothers and sisters there was a time of
[59:40] mourning even Jesus himself and now
[59:44] let's go back in the conversation a
[59:46] little bit we're saying Jesus but
[59:47] remember Jesus was God
[59:50] he wept
[59:51] at the tomb of Lazarus
[59:55] and there's people that stumble at that
[59:56] and say well he was just a man when he
[59:57] did that and you know what yeah he was a
[1:00:00] man he was all man when he cried but he
[1:00:02] was all God when he put his shoulders
[1:00:04] back and squared up to that tomb and
[1:00:06] said Lazarus come forth
[1:00:08] [Music]
[1:00:10] I am the resurrection and the life
[1:00:14] there was a time of mourning and you
[1:00:16] know what in our lives brothers and
[1:00:17] sisters there's a time of mourning
[1:00:19] because of Adam's choice
[1:00:22] not ours
[1:00:24] we mourn it's it's an emotional time for
[1:00:27] us when we lose a loved one when
[1:00:29] somebody passes on goes beyond the
[1:00:31] curtain of time for us here that remain
[1:00:34] we which are alive and remain you know
[1:00:36] what we need to comfort one another with
[1:00:38] these words to recognize there's going
[1:00:40] to be a resurrection there's going to be
[1:00:41] a Rapture there's going to be a meeting
[1:00:44] in the air
[1:00:46] and I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
[1:00:49] of them
[1:00:51] you know it sure doesn't feel like it
[1:00:52] many times in my life I Stumble and I
[1:00:54] fall
[1:00:56] how many stumble and fall in your lives
[1:00:59] the key to it is get up
[1:01:01] the believer gets back up
[1:01:04] just get up the Believers got that kind
[1:01:06] of a grit in their lives they just get
[1:01:08] back up again they don't stay down and
[1:01:10] say I can't live it because remember we
[1:01:14] are not the resurrection and the life he
[1:01:17] is I am the resurrection and the life if
[1:01:20] we can get it that way where he lives
[1:01:22] that life through us then you know what
[1:01:24] we'll be able to get back up again but
[1:01:26] if we say I want to try and live the
[1:01:27] message of the hour we're never going to
[1:01:28] do it we're going to fall flat on our
[1:01:30] face every single time and we're going
[1:01:31] to wonder why do we even bother trying
[1:01:34] but boy oh boy when he comes to town
[1:01:36] I am gets in our lives it changes
[1:01:40] everything
[1:01:41] and you know what sure we still mourn
[1:01:43] remember Jesus
[1:01:45] Jesus cried
[1:01:47] he wept at the tomb of Lazarus
[1:01:51] I think it's beautiful
[1:01:53] to a degree
[1:01:55] because what it does is it shows that
[1:01:57] God himself was tempted in all points
[1:01:59] just like we are
[1:02:02] God knows what it's like to have a
[1:02:05] broken heart
[1:02:06] God knows what it's like to lose someone
[1:02:09] really close to us
[1:02:11] but his word says I'll never leave you
[1:02:13] or forsake you
[1:02:15] you're going to go through times of
[1:02:17] mourning you're going to lose loved ones
[1:02:19] and you're going to miss them dearly and
[1:02:21] there's nothing on Earth no words of
[1:02:23] comfort that can ever fill that hole in
[1:02:26] our heart
[1:02:31] but there's a time for everything
[1:02:34] and that's the word of God
[1:02:37] it's not something that was just a good
[1:02:38] song that came around somewhere along
[1:02:40] the way any good song that quotes the
[1:02:42] word of God is just something that's a
[1:02:44] perversion of the word of God
[1:02:46] and I'm talking about something that I
[1:02:48] know from the world so forgive me for
[1:02:50] even going there
[1:02:51] but you know what there's a time there
[1:02:52] is a season for every single thing under
[1:02:55] the sun
[1:02:56] and you know
[1:02:57] Jesus God I am the one who was the
[1:03:02] resurrection and the life
[1:03:04] he sat everyone down one day and told
[1:03:06] them
[1:03:07] on the hillside
[1:03:10] blessed are they who mourn
[1:03:12] for they shall be comforted
[1:03:15] he didn't just talk about other things
[1:03:18] he specifically said blessed are they
[1:03:20] that mourn for they shall be comforted
[1:03:23] somewhere along the way they shall be
[1:03:25] comforted and who knows how it will come
[1:03:28] maybe it will come through a brother
[1:03:29] maybe it will come through a sister
[1:03:31] maybe it will come through a sermon
[1:03:32] maybe it will come from listening to a
[1:03:34] tape maybe it will come from reading the
[1:03:36] Bible maybe it will come from a dream
[1:03:38] maybe it will come from prayer we don't
[1:03:41] know where it will come from but the
[1:03:42] word of God says that they shall be
[1:03:44] comforted and we can just take that and
[1:03:47] say Amen I'll take that all day long
[1:03:52] when we lose people
[1:03:54] it's not easy
[1:03:56] turn with me over to the Book of
[1:03:58] Ecclesiastes
[1:04:00] we talked about this yesterday
[1:04:03] I just thought it would be so good to
[1:04:04] read it
[1:04:06] I was just mentioning it a little bit
[1:04:14] Ecclesiastes chapter 3.
[1:04:27] verse 1 it says to everything
[1:04:30] there is a season
[1:04:33] and a time to every purpose under heaven
[1:04:40] we could just pause there and think
[1:04:41] about that every single purpose under
[1:04:43] heaven there is a season and a Time
[1:04:47] there's no accidents in this world this
[1:04:49] is the word of God
[1:04:51] verse 2 says a time to be born
[1:04:54] and a time to die
[1:04:57] a time to plant
[1:04:59] a time to pluck up that which is planted
[1:05:03] A Time to Kill and a time to heal
[1:05:05] a time to break down and a time to build
[1:05:08] up
[1:05:10] a time to weep
[1:05:13] and a time to laugh
[1:05:16] a time to mourn
[1:05:18] a time to dance
[1:05:21] a time to Cast Away stones and a time to
[1:05:24] gather Stones together
[1:05:26] a time to embrace
[1:05:28] and a time to refrain from embracing
[1:05:32] a time to get
[1:05:34] time to lose
[1:05:36] a time to keep
[1:05:38] a time to Cast Away
[1:05:40] a time to Rend
[1:05:43] a time to sow
[1:05:45] a time to keep silence
[1:05:48] and a time to speak
[1:05:51] A Time To Love
[1:05:53] and a time to hate
[1:05:55] a time of war and a time of peace
[1:05:59] I just want to jump down to verse 14.
[1:06:03] this is Solomon speaking I know that
[1:06:05] whatsoever God doeth
[1:06:07] it shall be forever
[1:06:10] nothing can be put to it
[1:06:13] nor anything taken from it
[1:06:16] and God do with it
[1:06:18] that men should fear before him
[1:06:22] I just can't help but think that is such
[1:06:24] a beautiful scripture that verse 14. of
[1:06:29] Our Lives
[1:06:30] when we live the testimony of Jesus
[1:06:32] Christ in our lives when we live that
[1:06:35] resurrection and we demonstrate his life
[1:06:40] it's God that does it
[1:06:43] and it's forever
[1:06:45] isn't it beautiful to think that when we
[1:06:47] have the ability to believe when we're
[1:06:49] saved when we truly get saved brothers
[1:06:52] and sisters we're saved until the day of
[1:06:54] our Redemption
[1:06:55] until we get to our destination we're
[1:06:57] not saved today and we go outside the
[1:07:00] church and we stumble and we fall and
[1:07:02] and then we have to go and and repent
[1:07:04] and hopefully God will take us back into
[1:07:06] his lap and forgive us you know what his
[1:07:09] ear is always open to our prayers he
[1:07:11] always always is waiting for us to come
[1:07:15] back to him we heard the prophet of God
[1:07:17] say it so many times you know how can we
[1:07:20] ever get back to God and he says just go
[1:07:23] back to where you got off
[1:07:24] just find that place where you had that
[1:07:27] issue and if you have any problems
[1:07:29] trying to find that place I dare you
[1:07:31] just ask them
[1:07:33] in all sincerity I promise you he'll
[1:07:35] show you
[1:07:37] brother Branham tells that story about
[1:07:38] that Soldier Boy out on the field
[1:07:41] the chaplain coming to him while he's
[1:07:42] dying he took a bullet or shrapnel to
[1:07:46] his chest and his lungs are filling up
[1:07:48] with blood and he doesn't have much time
[1:07:49] the chaplain's not going to be able to
[1:07:51] save him the Medics can't help him
[1:07:52] nobody can help him
[1:07:54] the blood is filling up in his lungs and
[1:07:56] he's just about to die
[1:07:58] and the chaplain tells him
[1:08:01] are you okay are you ready to meet God
[1:08:04] and the boy says I don't know I don't
[1:08:06] know
[1:08:07] and he says do you remember where you
[1:08:09] got off
[1:08:10] I'm paraphrasing heavy here just for
[1:08:13] time's sake but the boy says no I don't
[1:08:15] and the chaplain says you better hurry
[1:08:17] up you better figure it out because
[1:08:18] you've only got a minute or so left your
[1:08:20] lungs are filling with blood
[1:08:23] and he says the boy he remembers
[1:08:26] he remembers where he got off
[1:08:29] the place where he just did that thing
[1:08:32] you know brother Bradham preaches the
[1:08:33] sermon from that time
[1:08:36] there's always the time brothers and
[1:08:37] sisters just that one little thing that
[1:08:40] we did somewhere along the way just that
[1:08:42] one time from that time that's where it
[1:08:44] changed for me and you know what God
[1:08:46] stays there just waiting for us to come
[1:08:48] back to him but so long as we're willing
[1:08:50] to come back to him he'll say hey it's
[1:08:52] all good I've loved you from beginning
[1:08:54] before the foundation of the world don't
[1:08:56] you worry
[1:08:58] that's all we have to do
[1:09:01] but maybe it sounds contrary to what I
[1:09:03] was saying brothers and sisters a son
[1:09:04] and daughter of God is always going to
[1:09:06] go back to him
[1:09:09] we're never going to just say no I can't
[1:09:11] be I can't be saved it's just never
[1:09:13] going to happen I've sinned away my day
[1:09:14] of Grace there's going to come a time
[1:09:16] where we're going to look back in our
[1:09:17] lives and we're going to say wow I just
[1:09:19] need to get back to where I was
[1:09:21] but you know what brothers and sisters
[1:09:22] is a time for everything single thing
[1:09:24] under the sun there's a time for every
[1:09:27] season and every single purpose if we
[1:09:30] have mourning in our hearts today
[1:09:32] because our dear sister Tina has passed
[1:09:34] on it's a normal human condition we are
[1:09:38] supposed to mourn that's the word of God
[1:09:40] but the word of God says that we will be
[1:09:42] comforted somewhere along the way nobody
[1:09:44] can tell us you know what
[1:09:46] according to my calculations you've
[1:09:48] mourned enough
[1:09:50] time is up you need to just get on with
[1:09:52] life and get better
[1:09:54] some people have the audacity to say
[1:09:56] those words
[1:09:57] but those are the people that don't
[1:09:58] recognize the word of God he doesn't put
[1:10:00] a time stamp on it
[1:10:02] he says they shall be comforted that's
[1:10:04] all
[1:10:05] sometimes it can take a day sometimes it
[1:10:07] can take a week sometimes it can take a
[1:10:09] year you know what sometimes you'll
[1:10:11] never be comforted all the way at the
[1:10:14] loss of a loved one
[1:10:16] it's just the way it works sometimes
[1:10:19] it's a temporary comforting maybe it's
[1:10:22] just a little bit of a fix for a while
[1:10:24] and it gets us through another day
[1:10:26] another week another month
[1:10:28] but that's the curse we live under
[1:10:32] and we can't escape it
[1:10:35] but you know if the devil ever tries to
[1:10:37] take our flesh
[1:10:38] we will never go to the Grave
[1:10:40] we'll go to our reward
[1:10:43] and you know what it shall be forever
[1:10:47] the thing I I just wanna I don't want to
[1:10:49] dwell on the morning part but you know
[1:10:51] what it is a normal thing
[1:10:54] we can actually mourn we can weep it's
[1:10:57] important for us to do that
[1:10:59] it really is I heard someone say it
[1:11:02] yesterday you know the tears they
[1:11:03] cleanse our soul
[1:11:06] I think it's so good we need to be able
[1:11:08] to mourn we need to be able to weep God
[1:11:11] himself wept at the tomb of Lazarus some
[1:11:14] people will stumble and say well that
[1:11:16] was that was just a man and sure enough
[1:11:19] maybe it was but he came to be tempted
[1:11:22] in all points just like us you know
[1:11:24] brothers and sisters there was another
[1:11:26] time in this story and it was a time of
[1:11:28] great rejoicing wasn't it
[1:11:31] when they rolled back the stone
[1:11:33] and they said Oh Lord he stinketh
[1:11:36] he's been in the Tomb four days now are
[1:11:39] you sure
[1:11:41] what are you doing
[1:11:42] and he said just trust me
[1:11:45] I am the resurrection and the life
[1:11:48] just trust me
[1:11:50] just just put your faith in me and see
[1:11:53] what happens and you know brothers and
[1:11:55] sisters there was a time of great
[1:11:56] rejoicing and isn't it interesting I
[1:11:59] just want to throw this in there I find
[1:12:00] it astounding I found it a little while
[1:12:02] ago the word of God says that the the
[1:12:04] Pharisees or the Sadducees the the
[1:12:06] religious leaders of the day they
[1:12:08] desired to put Lazarus back in that
[1:12:10] grave
[1:12:11] because of the testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:12:14] they wanted to kill him
[1:12:16] so that people would stop talking about
[1:12:18] that Resurrection can you believe that
[1:12:21] who does that who who who is able to
[1:12:23] resurrect someone from the dead outside
[1:12:26] of Jesus Christ up until then
[1:12:30] no one
[1:12:32] but they didn't like it because it was
[1:12:33] against their traditions we talked about
[1:12:35] it on Wednesday it was against their
[1:12:36] thinking they had everything figured out
[1:12:39] in their mind all of their traditional
[1:12:42] ways were already there and when
[1:12:44] something new came along when it was
[1:12:46] time to turn a corner
[1:12:47] in the ministry of Jesus Christ it was
[1:12:50] just more than they could bear they just
[1:12:52] couldn't comprehend how could it be
[1:12:53] different than than what we actually
[1:12:56] believe our traditions
[1:12:59] you know they uh
[1:13:01] they desired to put him to death
[1:13:03] for the good that he did isn't that
[1:13:05] interesting
[1:13:06] and not so much for the good that he did
[1:13:09] but for who he claimed to be
[1:13:11] and he wasn't lying
[1:13:13] that's the tragedy
[1:13:15] but it wasn't even for their sake it was
[1:13:17] for ours that's why they were blinded
[1:13:20] so that we could have this Resurrection
[1:13:22] in life in our lives
[1:13:24] one day we know that we're going to see
[1:13:26] our sister Tina we talked about it
[1:13:28] yesterday there has to be people that go
[1:13:30] on before us as brother Branham said
[1:13:32] that you know about about a month or so
[1:13:34] I think he said in the message that
[1:13:36] there will be people that actually come
[1:13:38] forward just like when Abraham and Sarah
[1:13:40] brother Bradham said they wanted to make
[1:13:42] a Whistle Stop they said Lord on the way
[1:13:44] to heaven could we just make a whistle
[1:13:46] stop back in Jerusalem and just go and
[1:13:47] see the old place could we just go and
[1:13:49] and see the old people and just get that
[1:13:52] refreshment and and God said sure go
[1:13:55] ahead yeah go no problem just go and
[1:13:57] take a look at the old place and and
[1:13:59] walk around and they saw that people saw
[1:14:01] them right is that the scripture the
[1:14:03] people started to recognize them and
[1:14:05] they said oh we need to get out of here
[1:14:07] they're starting to see us you know
[1:14:08] that's going to happen again brothers
[1:14:09] and sisters and we need people that will
[1:14:11] recognize to come back to see us again
[1:14:16] but these people in this story they
[1:14:18] called on Jesus but he didn't come right
[1:14:19] away he knew who he was he had full
[1:14:22] confidence in the word he wanted to see
[1:14:24] all of this come to pass he wanted to
[1:14:26] see it play out he wanted to see them
[1:14:28] get sad he wanted to see them mourn he
[1:14:30] wanted to show them the full power of
[1:14:33] the manifestation of his word
[1:14:35] he said even for your sakes I'm glad
[1:14:37] that I didn't come and and I find that
[1:14:40] astounding
[1:14:41] and that can be a confusing thing for us
[1:14:43] as Believers when we call on his name
[1:14:45] and he doesn't come the way that we
[1:14:46] think he should that can confuse us what
[1:14:49] we need to do is just trust him and say
[1:14:50] Lord I don't understand this but I know
[1:14:52] that it's in your time and in your way
[1:14:54] because you said I am the resurrection
[1:14:57] and the life
[1:14:59] and I just I I said this yesterday I
[1:15:01] think I wanted to so bad I'm going to
[1:15:03] say it today there's a reason why sister
[1:15:05] Tina lived the way that she did there's
[1:15:07] a reason why she had these testimonies
[1:15:09] it's because she believed that I am for
[1:15:12] today it wasn't the I was or the I will
[1:15:15] be it wasn't some historical event or
[1:15:17] some futuristic idea it was the Jesus
[1:15:21] Christ of today and the only Jesus
[1:15:23] Christ of today that we can have our our
[1:15:26] complete trust in is the Jesus Christ
[1:15:28] that came according to the message of
[1:15:30] the hour
[1:15:32] through a Vindicated prophet
[1:15:34] because there's no other Vindicated
[1:15:35] Prophet that brought a message like we
[1:15:38] have
[1:15:38] she was able to meet the Jesus Christ of
[1:15:41] today the present tense I am for herself
[1:15:45] and because of that brothers and sisters
[1:15:47] she was able to receive the baptism the
[1:15:49] true baptism of the Holy Ghost to become
[1:15:51] a fully adopted son or a fully adopted
[1:15:53] daughter of God she understood the
[1:15:55] doctor's report fully the doctor said to
[1:15:58] her the second last time she went into
[1:15:59] the hospital we're going to give you a
[1:16:01] heart pump and you're going to wear it
[1:16:02] like a backpack and you'll be able to
[1:16:04] have many more years of of quality of
[1:16:06] life and she said no my God said he's my
[1:16:09] healer I'm going to put my trust in him
[1:16:12] and if he decides not to heal me then
[1:16:14] he's going to take me home
[1:16:17] she understood the great Physicians
[1:16:19] report
[1:16:20] and I just want to emphasize this you
[1:16:22] know the word of God says he that
[1:16:24] believeth on me though he were dead yet
[1:16:26] shall he live I just wanted to say it
[1:16:28] this way in in remembrance of sister
[1:16:31] Tina she that believeth in me though she
[1:16:34] were dead yet shall she live and you
[1:16:37] know she's more alive today than she was
[1:16:39] a few days ago when she was here on
[1:16:41] Earth isn't she
[1:16:43] I I hope we're okay for a few more
[1:16:45] minutes I'm not gonna go too much longer
[1:16:47] I don't really think so but I just want
[1:16:49] to bring out one more point about this
[1:16:50] talking about the resurrection
[1:16:51] understanding that God has a purpose in
[1:16:54] our lives and that we have to go through
[1:16:55] these times of mourning we have to go
[1:16:57] through weeping we have to go through
[1:16:59] the the the law of the contrast so that
[1:17:02] we can understand what it means to be
[1:17:04] able to dance there Comes A Time under
[1:17:07] heaven where we will dance again if
[1:17:09] we're weeping if we're mourning it will
[1:17:11] happen it's the word of God
[1:17:16] job
[1:17:17] story of Job
[1:17:19] he saw something didn't he
[1:17:21] I'm not going to try and take too much
[1:17:23] time with this brothers and sisters but
[1:17:25] I just have a quote and maybe a few
[1:17:27] comments and then we'll close but you
[1:17:29] know what brother Branham says that it
[1:17:30] was in The Darkest Hour that job he saw
[1:17:33] something wasn't it
[1:17:35] didn't job lose everything that he had
[1:17:37] except for his wife and his own life
[1:17:40] and could you imagine the amount the
[1:17:42] level of Calamity in that man's life
[1:17:46] to hear that his sons and daughters they
[1:17:50] they died and and while they yet spoke
[1:17:54] another messenger comes and says all of
[1:17:57] your business venture all of your
[1:17:58] interests are wiped out and while he yet
[1:18:01] spoke something else another Calamity
[1:18:03] all of these things one after the other
[1:18:06] after the other because God said do
[1:18:09] whatever you want to
[1:18:11] do whatever you want to just don't touch
[1:18:13] his life
[1:18:15] can you imagine that was God's will
[1:18:20] do we think that he doesn't talk about
[1:18:21] us
[1:18:25] can promise you brothers and sisters
[1:18:27] speaks your name
[1:18:31] then Jesus came and called paragraph
[1:18:33] 118.
[1:18:36] he said if a tree goes down in the grave
[1:18:40] a scent of rain The Roots come out again
[1:18:44] if a flower dies the little seed lays
[1:18:46] there and bursts open the pope runs out
[1:18:49] of it
[1:18:51] there ain't a way you can find the life
[1:18:53] in it
[1:18:56] but when spring comes around
[1:18:58] up comes that Little Flower again
[1:19:02] now there's hope
[1:19:03] if a flower dies if a tree dies
[1:19:07] but a man
[1:19:10] said he layeth down
[1:19:12] he giveth up the ghost
[1:19:15] his sons come to honor him
[1:19:17] and he perceive it not
[1:19:20] job wanted to know
[1:19:22] when they plant a seed in the ground and
[1:19:25] it comes up
[1:19:27] but they plant a man in the ground
[1:19:30] and he don't come up
[1:19:32] now he said what about all of this
[1:19:36] and I can't help but imagine brothers
[1:19:38] and sisters how many times we would say
[1:19:41] those words maybe not in our mouth maybe
[1:19:43] we wouldn't utter those words but in our
[1:19:45] mind
[1:19:46] maybe in our heart
[1:19:49] and I can tell you for a certain that I
[1:19:52] have
[1:19:53] the reason I'm saying it is because I
[1:19:55] have
[1:19:56] we had a baby at one time
[1:19:58] and we had to give that perfectly
[1:20:00] healthy baby up he just came too
[1:20:02] premature
[1:20:03] and we had to just commit him back to
[1:20:05] God we didn't come to the front of the
[1:20:06] church and give a baby dedication we
[1:20:08] just had a baby and dedicated it to God
[1:20:10] and then God took him home
[1:20:12] and one day we're going to see Timothy
[1:20:14] come knocking on our door saying take
[1:20:16] comfort mommy and daddy
[1:20:18] your day is near
[1:20:21] so I just want to tell you I'm not just
[1:20:23] saying this because I think it's cool
[1:20:24] and I'm trying to express that you
[1:20:26] should be or shouldn't be away I want to
[1:20:28] say that I can relate this to my life
[1:20:30] this means something to me when they
[1:20:32] plant a seed in the ground and it comes
[1:20:33] up but they plant a man in the ground
[1:20:35] and you don't come up
[1:20:37] now what about all this and especially
[1:20:40] for the Believers of this message of the
[1:20:42] hour we get into the first and the
[1:20:43] second polls we should be able to have a
[1:20:45] prayer meeting we should be able to
[1:20:46] bring people up anoint them with oil and
[1:20:48] see them dance out of the church
[1:20:50] God's got a perfect will and his will
[1:20:53] will always come to pass his way
[1:20:58] it's not up to us to tell him what his
[1:21:00] will is
[1:21:02] it's up to us to just simply believe
[1:21:04] that it's for his purpose
[1:21:07] and by and by we'll be able to thank him
[1:21:09] for it we'll be able to rejoice
[1:21:13] but the Bradham goes on to say and he
[1:21:14] couldn't understand it
[1:21:16] sometimes in our lives we can't
[1:21:18] understand it
[1:21:19] how a man much more Glory than a flower
[1:21:23] a man
[1:21:24] much more Glory than a tree in the image
[1:21:27] of God
[1:21:29] and yet he planted him in the ground
[1:21:32] and that settled it
[1:21:34] his sons come to mourn and he perceive
[1:21:36] it not oh that thou would hide me in the
[1:21:38] grave that thou would keep me in the
[1:21:40] secret place till thy wrath be past
[1:21:43] that anointest me a time and a place I
[1:21:46] cannot pass
[1:21:51] notice now
[1:21:53] when all this distress come
[1:21:55] and his friends turn their back on him
[1:22:01] and accusing him of being a secret
[1:22:03] sinner
[1:22:06] I just want to pause there for a second
[1:22:08] it just emphasize this brothers and
[1:22:10] sisters when God's will happens when
[1:22:12] somebody passes away
[1:22:14] it's not because we've sinned
[1:22:17] we're not secret sinners
[1:22:20] I beat myself up for years
[1:22:22] thinking that I did something wrong or I
[1:22:24] didn't do something right
[1:22:27] I was the cause of whatever happened
[1:22:30] it's not the case it's God's perfect
[1:22:32] will
[1:22:33] nobody dies out of punishment because of
[1:22:36] what we've done
[1:22:38] maybe that was the prophet's story
[1:22:41] but I want to say today that's not yours
[1:22:44] now you might say how would you know
[1:22:46] brother Mary I don't know
[1:22:48] but I want to tell you don't live in
[1:22:50] condemnation thinking that maybe
[1:22:52] something happened or didn't happen that
[1:22:53] could have or should have happened
[1:22:54] nobody goes home unless God invites them
[1:22:59] nobody
[1:23:02] you're not a secret sinner
[1:23:04] if you have confessed your sin before
[1:23:06] the Lord
[1:23:08] if you've died out to yourself
[1:23:10] if you have been baptized in the name of
[1:23:12] the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:23:13] of your sins and you have received the
[1:23:16] gift of the Holy Ghost you don't lose
[1:23:18] that gift of the Holy Ghost brothers and
[1:23:20] sisters you have that gift of the Holy
[1:23:22] Ghost until the day of your destination
[1:23:25] or your Redemption
[1:23:27] you have it
[1:23:30] goes on to say wife had turned him down
[1:23:32] everybody had turned him down
[1:23:35] said his breath was strange to his wife
[1:23:39] she didn't even want to smell him
[1:23:43] and all the things that happened to him
[1:23:47] and look like God turned him down
[1:23:51] if we have Calamity in our lives it
[1:23:53] doesn't mean God's turned us down
[1:23:56] means that God loves us
[1:23:59] if we're weeping it means that God loves
[1:24:01] us
[1:24:02] if if we're mourning it means that God
[1:24:04] loves us that his word applies to us in
[1:24:07] our lives
[1:24:09] all the things that happen to him
[1:24:13] look like God turned him down and when
[1:24:15] he's going to die and go into the ground
[1:24:18] but brothers and sisters there came a
[1:24:20] time where God came and spoke to job it
[1:24:23] was no longer his friends brother
[1:24:25] Branham says that it was maybe the
[1:24:26] deacons in the church that came around
[1:24:28] and said you're a secret sinner
[1:24:31] it was the Believers in another part he
[1:24:33] says
[1:24:34] but there came a time where God himself
[1:24:37] came and spoke to job and I promise you
[1:24:40] there will come a time where God will
[1:24:42] come and speak to you in your situation
[1:24:46] God spoke to him as much as it is to say
[1:24:50] job now gird up your loins I'm going to
[1:24:54] talk to you
[1:24:56] and then when he said you see the tree
[1:24:59] never sinned
[1:25:00] the flower never sinned
[1:25:03] it served my purpose therefore it was
[1:25:06] dermatized one to the other and it
[1:25:09] didn't sin so it rises up again but man
[1:25:12] sinned therefore he's cut off
[1:25:16] so then job began to wonder and then he
[1:25:19] got into distress just like Martha did
[1:25:21] in the darkest hour when all of his
[1:25:24] influence he had lived had he lived it
[1:25:27] in vain
[1:25:29] That's what Satan does to us isn't it
[1:25:32] remember the prophet of God when
[1:25:34] Sharon Rose was laid on his wife
[1:25:40] in the hospital
[1:25:41] dying
[1:25:43] doctors told him there's no hope
[1:25:46] your wife's gone
[1:25:47] now your baby too
[1:25:49] don't go down there and see her because
[1:25:51] she she'll infect you you'll get
[1:25:53] infected and he said I'm going to see
[1:25:55] her and he saw the little baby Sharon
[1:25:57] Rose cross-eyed with flies in her eyes
[1:26:00] in such Agony and pain
[1:26:03] and what happened the same thing here
[1:26:06] the devil came around and said that's
[1:26:08] the god you serve
[1:26:10] my you could pray for everyone else
[1:26:13] and they're healed
[1:26:15] but look at you
[1:26:18] must be a secret sinner
[1:26:20] must be something in your life
[1:26:23] what have you done
[1:26:26] but we know that God was squeezing this
[1:26:28] man
[1:26:29] God wanted this Prophet to be a little
[1:26:31] more attentive he didn't want him to
[1:26:33] listen to anybody else's voice he only
[1:26:35] wanted him to hear the voice of God
[1:26:41] that's what Satan's going to do is wait
[1:26:43] for our darkest hour brothers and
[1:26:44] sisters he's going to let us go on and
[1:26:47] on and on and he'll wait till we're at
[1:26:48] our weakest point or at our darkest hour
[1:26:51] and then he'll come around and say
[1:26:52] that's the god you serve you follow that
[1:26:55] one that God of William Branham you you
[1:26:58] believe that
[1:27:00] look at where you're at look at what
[1:27:01] he's allowed to come upon you look at
[1:27:03] where you find yourself today 10 years
[1:27:05] ago you never would have believed this
[1:27:07] would where you be where you'd be 20
[1:27:09] years ago you never would have dreamed
[1:27:10] your life would wind up like this but
[1:27:12] here you are today
[1:27:16] take courage brothers and sisters
[1:27:18] it's God's will
[1:27:21] it's God's will for you to have the
[1:27:23] kingdom
[1:27:26] I am the resurrection and the life
[1:27:30] so then job began to wonder and then he
[1:27:33] got into distress just like Mary Did In
[1:27:35] The Darkest Hour when all of his
[1:27:37] influence he had he lived it in vain how
[1:27:40] would he speak to job he's a prophet how
[1:27:43] will he speak to him in a vision
[1:27:46] says then he looked up and the Thunders
[1:27:48] roared and the Lightnings flashed and
[1:27:50] Jesus came along I love how he says it
[1:27:53] because he doesn't say God came along
[1:27:54] Jesus came along to meet job
[1:27:58] Jesus came along then he seen him in the
[1:28:01] last days he said I know my redeemer
[1:28:05] liveth and at the last days he'll stand
[1:28:07] upon this Earth though the skin worms
[1:28:11] destroys this body yet in my flesh shall
[1:28:15] I see God whom I shall see the darkest
[1:28:18] hour then Jesus came along brothers and
[1:28:22] sisters we're going to go into our
[1:28:23] darkest hours every one of us have to
[1:28:25] that's the way he created us but then
[1:28:29] Jesus is going to come on Jesus will
[1:28:31] come around
[1:28:32] he will come around if we are faithful
[1:28:35] if we're willing to just take him at his
[1:28:37] word just like we sang at the beginning
[1:28:39] of the service you are the god that sent
[1:28:42] me your word and and you've healed my
[1:28:45] disease whatever that disease is
[1:28:47] brothers and sisters he will do it maybe
[1:28:50] stand with me as we close today
[1:28:53] I am the resurrection and the life don't
[1:28:56] let it be the I am the resurrection and
[1:28:59] the life in somebody else's life Let It
[1:29:02] Be Your resurrection and your life
[1:29:05] have that experience for yourself
[1:29:07] brothers and sisters it will bring the
[1:29:09] full confidence in the word
[1:29:11] it will give us the ability to recognize
[1:29:14] we're going to mourn we're going to weep
[1:29:16] we're going to sing we're going to dance
[1:29:18] we're going through the whole range of
[1:29:21] emotions in this Human Condition
[1:29:23] but in the end we'll know that Our
[1:29:25] Redeemer Lives
[1:29:28] let's just bow in prayer
[1:29:30] gracious Heavenly Father
[1:29:33] Lord Jesus we thank you for your word
[1:29:35] Lord
[1:29:36] we thank you for the encouragement of

[1:29:42] encouragement like you father
[1:29:44] oh Lord Jesus we pray that somehow
