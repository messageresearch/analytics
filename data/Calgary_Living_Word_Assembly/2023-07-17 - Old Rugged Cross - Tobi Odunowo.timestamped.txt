[0:02] um the old drug had crossed but just
[0:03] before I do it I just want to tell a
[0:05] very quick story
[0:07] um I've always heard this song was old
[0:09] time him and but it made the most
[0:12] meaning to me
[0:13] um some years ago when a sister sang it
[0:16] after giving the testimony so back in
[0:18] Nigeria the sister I'd gone for the
[0:20] mandatory um they call it the youth
[0:23] service but it's like a paramilitary
[0:25] service three weeks being with soldiers
[0:30] teaching you stuff and women are
[0:32] actually required to wear trousers and
[0:35] she had to take a stand
[0:38] and many times she got in detention and
[0:41] got persecuted through those three weeks
[0:44] just because she took the stand and she
[0:46] came and sang was special the older get
[0:48] dressed and when she got to the points
[0:49] where she said
[0:51] to The Old Rugged Cross I will ever be
[0:53] true
[0:54] it's shame and reproach gladly ba I
[0:58] realized that we all have a cross
