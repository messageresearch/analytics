wall and Satan says you're done he's got your foot on your neck and God just pushes that foot away unless you stand up say no that's my son that's my daughter you can't have anything to do with that person anymore and we see the fruit of that in our lives and those of our brothers and sisters he is amazing because of that we press on well in Jesus name we press [Music] on in Jesus name we press [Music] on De de Lord with the price oh it's clear before our eyes we find the strength to press on brother called me today and just encouraged me and told me a testimony of his for many years ago and meeting me and and how how he just felt the Lord touched something that we talked about and just it just really struck me how uh we were talking about how little time we have to visit here and I just said think about it three and a half years I don't know how long the marriage supper will be but the tribulation period three and A2 years to look across the table of one another and say brother you made it sister you made it and all of us just encouraging each other and worshiping the Lord as he walks around brother the Bible says walking wiping tears from our eyes brother Brown talks about that what a day we have just around the next Corner let's press on Saints let's press on he's prepared a way for us just beyond the next curtain is that marriage supper well in Jesus name we press on oh yes in Jesus name we press [Music] all oh dear Lord with that price oh it's clear before our eyes oh we find the strength to press on De Lord with the priz oh it's clear before our eyes oh we find the strength to press on 146 touching Jesus as our pastor comes we touching Jesus oh it's all that really matters isn't that the truth oh and your life it'll never be the [Music] same for there is only one way to touch him oh just believe when you call on his name oh touching Jesus oh it's all that really matters oh and your life oh it'll never be the [Music] same oh there is [Music] only one way to

[Music] day amen God bless you tonight welcome to the house of the Lord another Wednesday service the saints of God are weary from the trials of this life yes certainly an honor and a privilege to gather together in his name though we just have a few prayer requests we'd like to bring Before the Throne tonight but before we do that we have a praise report Hallelujah and I'll probably say it again on Sunday for those people who aren't here tonight so bear with me but it's just significant this week we got a a praise report from Sister Becky hilderbrand someone whom we prayed for and you know this is the god that we serve brothers and sisters and I just felt so impressed to bring that testimony tonight because what we're dealing with is a giant and the Giants are in the land and they want to boast and they want to make us afraid but we don't come with sticks and Spears we come in the name of the Living God hallelujah this is Sister Becky hilderbrand's words she said good afternoon all I'm here to share the good news with you all I had a CT scan on Friday and that was last Friday I believe and this morning at 8:20 I received an email notice I had a new report in my Sask Health app the report States I have no cancer [Applause] you know this is a sister that stood up in the midst of a Wednesday night service she was probably sitting sort of between sister Shelly and sister Stella in that row with her husband in a praise service she was diagnosed with breast cancer and she heard a voice in her heart say stand up and receive your healing and she did it and she did it he did it many years later in Saskatchewan she gets the similar giant knocking on her door someone delivery guy trying to hand her a box of rattlesnakes and from the very start she said no way uhuh she gets the report and it says no cancer Hallelujah she goes on to say no swollen lymph nodes this is just beautiful that's why I want to read this tonight brothers and sisters because it's not just no cancer and and that's it and there's still side effects and there's other stuff it's very specific there's no cancer no swollen lymph nodes no infected lymphatics or anything else from the chest to the pelvic there are no tumors benign or malignant no swelling anywhere no nothing in any part of my body there is not one thing that is questionable every note says no before the stated issue How Great Is Our God she says I'm so very thankful and grateful for all your prayers and support through all this love you and I'm looking forward to having my strength renewed and getting healthy again what a mighty God we serve let's just give him another [Applause] Cloud thank you this is cancer this is one of the biggest giants in the land but there ain't a giant big enough to contend with our God we just want to remember a few people before his throne the one who's willing to defeat cancer for us brother Logan berer Brother Andy and brother Benny sarpong brother Timothy odoo the Snows my wife Lisa and if you have a need tonight he's more than able just let him know by way of an uplift hand as we go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful for your goodness and your Tender Mercies to each and every one of us Lord oh Heavenly Father we're so thankful for the many gifts in the body Lord Jesus we know that we are all standing here tonight because you made a way

many of us have been dealing with this illness Lord that's going around and father we know that you are more than able and we just want to commit each life into your hands For Your Glory and Lord Jesus we'll be careful to return unto you and say thank you Lord Jesus we know there was a time where you were here and Lord there was 10 lepers oh Father and you healed all of them and nine of them ran away oh father but one of them had had the thought in his heart to turn around and say thank you Lord Jesus oh Father we know that many people want to call you Jesus but not many want to make you Lord father tonight we just ask that if there's anything in our lives that would hinder you from being Lord Of Our Lives father forgive us for it Lord Jesus help us to clean out the channels Lord that there would be nothing stopping the dynamic power of your grace in our lives Lord father we love you and we thank you for your goodness and your mercy Lord we just want to commit each life into your hands Lord the rest of this service into your hands father and Lord if there's any requests that we've forgotten or or missed Lord Jesus we know that you are more than able and you're probably already dealing with it father forgive our ignorance we pray Lord Jesus we love you and we thank you we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen oh Father I don't know why but I missed brother Timothy Odin noo and I had him written down here I guess I just got excited certainly apologize but we want to remember brother Timothy o Noah the family they've been at the Children's hospital with brother Timothy with the teething [Music] issue God bless you tonight if you have your Bibles thank you musicians thank you brother faren for the special once again just setting the atmosphere it's just tremendous Revelations chapter 2 we'll start reading with verse 8 Revelations Chap 2:8 and un unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write these things saith the first and the last which was dead and is alive I Know Thy works and tribulation and poverty but Thou Art rich and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of Satan fear none of these those things which Thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried and ye shall have tribulation 10 days be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a Crown of Life life he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord we love you we thank you for your word thank you for the Revelation that you've given us Lord father we just ask that you would anoint the reading of your word tonight father the the words from this book as we turn back the pages Lord we pray that the Revelation would begin to break in the hearts of each and every one of us father father we just ask that you would be with those who couldn't be here tonight Lord we want to remember the Odin noos father forgive my ignorance Lord Brother Timothy we pray that you would just be with him the entire family Lord and anyone else who might be ill tonight father we just ask that you would heal them in the name of Jesus Christ we ask it amen God bless you tonight you may be seated we certainly are pleased to welcome sister Lois odene back God bless you Sister certainly nice to see you again just a few announcements we have uh brother Nestor here this weekend we have a Saturday night service at 6 o'clock and a Sunday morning service at 10: we will have the young peoples actually at the church I'm sure everyone saw the notice that went out but if you didn't the uh fin Financial seminar that brother Joel wants to host will actually take place here in the sanctuary and uh anybody that wants to come is welcome to come lunch will be served for the Youth and anybody else is encouraged to bring their own lunch and it will be in the basement of the church um we were going to host it at our house this weekend but as I'm sure everyone who is married here understands that when the wife gets sick uh it can be a lot of pressure to have people coming around and uh the wives always want to have everything just so and I understand that and that's why I said I'm going to remove all the pressure from my wife because she is really under the weather and uh we're just not going to have any pressure and I said to brother Joel if we need to postpone it or if we need to find another venue whatever we need to do that's just fine but we're not going to put pressure on my wife this weekend so I trust that everyone would understand and I do apologize I don't want to make things difficult for anyone I know brother Joel has put a lot of energy into this and a lot of thought and uh I don't want to be insensitive to everyone else's schedule either but I mean uh at the end of the day this is my wife we're talking about I'm going to be a little Vigilant so here we are uh it's going to be at the church I'm sure it's going to be just fine there's no accidents with god um obviously he wanted it to be this way so maybe that we could record it properly uh the portion that brother Joel wanted to so if you want to come I think it'll be a very good time um I'm not sure whether I will be able to be here or not I would like to be I wanted to be a part of it but I also have three boys that I'm looking after as well so we're going to see what happens are you happy tonight certainly excited to get back into the exposition of the seven Church ages um I started babbling before I finished all of my notes Here I apologize um we'll get into the book in a minute we have the Men's breakfast coming up May 18th Lord willing it will be at our house as long as nobody is sick again um we will be working out some of the other arrangements for that as we go forwards Sunday June the 2nd we have brother Dela adadon from Nigeria he will be here Wednesday July 17th we have brother Jack Duff coming here from Florida does anybody here know him he is uh you know him brother too wonderful he's a part of the eagle chat that Bible study that I've been a part of for a couple years now and he's just a wonderful brother he wants to come up and see B and have have a little break and I said whenever you decide to come brother we're going to make a space for you so tentatively we have arranged for Wednesday July 17th he's a pastor in Florida we will have more details as they uh unravel and remember brother Andrew Glover will be here we're going to have three services with him in August it's amazing that we're already like talking that far out I was looking at the calendar this afternoon thinking my goodness pretty soon it'll be fall and we haven't even seen spring yet anyways uh brother Andrew Glover will be here uh Friday night service Saturday night service and a Sunday morning service and the Friday night will be 7:30 Saturday will be 6 and Sunday will be 10 a.m. I'm sure that it will be an absolute blessing amen I'm excited to uh to see him again and just see what the Lord will do uh the special services in Edmonton the convention is being formulated and uh I know one of the ministers that's going there is brother Wayne lock he's going to be one of them and the other one I think is to be determined still so uh that's coming up as well and I think it is the weekend just after the long weekend in August I could be wrong with that we'll definitely confirm it once the flyer comes out from Brother Ed hammermeister you know uh studying the saman church age out of Revelations chapter 2 last week we uh we covered some ground and I think it's really good we got some Headway and uh there's just some real important notes that we covered in there that I just wanted to touch on tonight that are just they're kind of like uh nugget quotes that you hear quite often but they're just super important ones you know and I remember brother Ken he's the first one that said this to me that I heard it um brother Bram he says that no True Believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and alive than his knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of God just a notable quote that I I I think it's just one of the great ones really um I'm just going to read a couple of these and then we'll get into carrying on you know uh the other thing that we talked about last week which I thought was really good is uh it's not really good because we talked about suffering quite a bit and it's God's plan for us to suffer we will not actually make it to the other side where brother Paul mentioned earlier in the song service where he will come and wipe away everyone's tears and we will be rejoicing with one another shouting because we made it knowing all of the tribulations that we had to go through to actually get there that is the character that he's working out right now and you know while we talk about working out that character what it is brothers and sisters it's a body change and remember these bodies aren't going to be changed this flesh isn't going to be changed it's the spiritual body that's going to be changed and it's the character inside of us that's going to be changed it's that old twin that's going to be changed into the new twin it's not going to be that old nature it's going to be that new nature because the only thing that we take with us is our character and my goodness what it's going to be like to have the right character to make it to the other side I I'm still a work in progress myself I don't know about you but I can say my myself I don't think I'm I've made it but maybe in his sight I have according to the word of God I know I have but I sure don't feel like it many times and I just think it's wonderful because what what I really got out of last week is that it's his elective love and it's nothing that we can actually change he actually elected Us in him before the foundation of the world to be the seed Gene waiting for that word to shine on that genetic seed and as soon as that happens there's a life that comes oh my I feel like I could get going here the cloudy skies and storms of life are no sign of God's disapproval neither are the bright skies and Still Waters signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the Beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us ah yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so how do we know he said so we talked about this last week nobody's ever heard Jesus say I love you his voice to our ear have you naturally speaking but to our hearts oh my you read his word and and you hear the prophet say his word my goodness you hear him say it all over the place he said so for sure he did and he manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself oh my we're standing here because he made a way he brought us unto himself right and gave us of his Spirit placing us as Sons remember we said adoption and how shall I prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials oh my that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass it's not easy brothers and sisters it's real easy to just say those words and let them roll off our tongue like it's just that's the way it is but it is the way it is and he's chosen to actually have it that way in our lives and there's nothing we can do about it except for count it all joy when we fall into diverse manifold Temptations because that's his will we're talking about that on Sunday his will being his word paragraph 31 here says I Know Thy poverty but Thou Art rich now we're carrying on from where we left off he says there it is again see him walking up and down in the midst of his church like a father he's looking down upon his family he is the head of the household he is the provider he is the protector yet he looks on at their poverty oh how Untold un oh how the untutored believer stumbles at this how can God bear to look upon his own in a time of need and not just stop it all just give in and lavish everything material upon them here's where you have to believe again in the love and goodness and wisdom of God this too is needful remember he admonished take no thought for the moral what she what ye shall eat or what ye shall put on your father knoweth the things ye have need of he who clothes the Lily and feeds the sparrow shall do much more for you these physical things are not the true basic necessities of your life for a man's life consisteth not of the things he possesses but that's exactly opposite of what this world says exactly opposite but rather seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness not just the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all all the material Necessities will be added unto you and how many of us here tonight could say that he's held back anything after seeking his kingdom first and his righteousness how much has been held back from us he's looked after so many things in our lives you know what's what's more than our needs is our wants and and we need to be careful to recognize that just because we get our wants doesn't mean that's his Blessing in our lives that can actually be a curse it can turn into a curse very quickly it's a real fine line the people of God are not Material minded they are christm minded amen they do not seek the treasures that are below they seek those above and I think brothers and sisters as we as we speak on this tonight and and as we Ponder these words that's why we're here amen is because we're christm minded We Believe it is absolutely true the majority of Christians are not wealthy rather they are on the Poor Side it was so in jesus' day it was true in Paul's day and it should be true today oh it is not too true today for the leodan age is one of vast wealth where often the Criterion of spirituality is an abundance of Earthly Goods my how how rich the church is in Goods but how poor in spirit and we always talk about the church nominal blessed be ye poor for yours is the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink Matthew 53 Romans 14:17 it is not Material it is within us a rich man a rich man is rich in God not in worldly things oh chres the spirit I see your poverty I see your need you haven't very much if anything to boast of what you did have has been taken from you you know isn't it interesting when you look around and you see we know how polarizing Co was UN precedented in in everyone's lifetime nobody alive has ever seen anything like Co aside from maybe those people who dealt with uh some of the World War II stuff I guess but never in terms of a disease where governments step in all around the world at the same time that's never happened but you know how many people were there I I I'm just going to speak honestly I was surprised how many people Christians Believers of this message immediately were were grasping at their rights wanting to stand up for their rights and wanting to look at the conspiracy and all the different angles of all these different things and and how it's all about control we're sheep brothers and sisters and brother badam says it clearly what did the Sheep do the Sheep doesn't say anything the Sheep just gives up his wool just gives it all take it it's not mine anyways if we have material wealth here it's not ours anyways one of these days someone could walk in and take it all and how would they do that all they would have to do is turn off our bank account because will not submit to a trinitarian doctrin that's all it will be shut off your bank account then you can't pay your mortgage bank takes your mortgage on your house house is gone cars you're not going to get insurance you won't get a driver's license all the different things they could do shut down this building all of our rights can be taken away brothers and sisters we have it good today but make sure that we keep him first that we seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness in Our Lives because our righteousness if we're not looking for his righteousness I feel like I could preach on that I really do if we're looking for any other righteousness it's but filthy rags before him that's what the word of God says not just the kingdom of God and his righteousness brothers and sisters has to be the people of God are not Material minded they are christm minded they do not seek Treasures that are below they seek those above it is absolutely true the majority of Christians are not wealthy rather they are on the Poor Side it was so in Jesus day it was true in Paul's day and it should be true today oh it is not true today for the leodan age is one of vast wealth where often the Criterion of spirituality is an abundance of Earthly Goods my how rich the church is in Goods but how poor in spirit blessed be ye poor for yours is the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink Romans 5 sorry Matthew 53 Romans 4:17 it is not Material it is within us a rich man is rich in God not in worldly things oh Christ the spirit I see your poverty I see your need you haven't very much if anything to boast of what you did have has been taken from you you gladly gave up your possessions in exchange for Eternal ones I just think that this is something we ought to take to heart and remember because if it happens it's is that going to change our walk with Christ is it going to polarize us to a place where we say no I got to fight for my rights watch it happen there will be all kinds of people that do Preppers people that want to dig a hole and hide in the den in the cave in the Rocks amen even that claim the message but I love what brother Bram says we're going to get into it you know what it it's the Holy Spirit or perish that's an exact quote that we're going to read I don't know if we'll get to it tonight Holy Spirit or perish that's the only thing brothers and sisters he goes on to say you're laughed at you are scorned you don't have material resources to fall back on but you are rich in spite of it all your security lies in him who is your shield and exceeding great reward your kingdom is yet to come but it will come there's going to be a time and he goes on to saying it will be an everlasting in one there's going to be a time where we will have him wipe away our tears from all the struggles and all the pain and all the hurt all the stuff that we've gone through on this side brothers and sisters amen it's going to happen amen he says yes I am mindful of your trials and woes I know how hard it is to get along but I will remember all this when I return to claim you as my own and then I will reward you and you know there's going to be a group of people who I believe already is right now on the earth and I'm sure all of us do believe that when they do actually take our Goods when they do turn us off some people will be here to witness that when that happens brothers and sisters what did Brother brandham say he what the Holy Spirit say through brother brandham he said watch the third poll then it'll be a short powerful demonstration of the spirit of God living through his bride body and I've heard people say I don't know if brother Bram says it but I think he might there will be a restoration of Limbs yes amen be able to speak food into existence we won't need to worry about anything because we'll know exactly who we are and where we stand amen now this is nothing against rich people this is where it becomes real treacherous too brothers and sisters there's people that are in the message that truly have the spirit of God baptized with the Holy Ghost who are wealthy people it's possible for a Believer to have money in the bank it's possible for a real believer to be wealthy but why are they wealthy it's not so they can polish their coins it's so they can help people that's the reason God makes Believers wealthy not so they can create a castle to live in but brother Bram he says this now it's nothing against rich people because God can save a rich man some of God's children are rich but money can be such a snare not only to those who have it but to those who don't have it way back there in the first age James cried out to those who were putting stock in wealthy people have not the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ with respect of persons James 2 verse one the poor there were the poor there were trying to butter up the rich in order to get help rather than trusting in God don't do it says James don't do it money isn't everything money isn't the answer and today it is not the answer either and it's not the answer brothers and sisters I've heard stories of very wealthy Brothers wanting to have influence over the church because of their wealth and if they can't have influence on the church then their wealth is not going to be applied to the church but what they're missing is their wealth isn't applied to a given Church geographically their wealth is applied to God but you can't by God he goes on to say we we have ever had and sorry I completely got in the middle of that we have more wealth than we have ever had and yet less is being accomplished spiritually I say Lord help us it is not with money that God works he moves by his spirit amen and that moving of the spirit comes only to a life consecrated to the word but you know brothers and sisters the other side of this that I want to mention by saying that I believe the message of the hour I'm baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I've got the holy ghost in my life and I don't need money in my life that's a lie you've got to be able to provide for your family to lead your family through the not hole sideways to to to put them through poverty to to let your children suffer financially it's a sin now you don't want to go and get your children a a a brand new phone we were talking about it on the way here young children in school with a brand new iPhone computers clothing cars CH children get their driver's license and daddy buys them a new car seriously I mean sometimes it happens but I don't want to throw off on anyone if that's what you want to do that's that's fine but what I'm saying is we can go too far one side or the other we can say that having too much money is sinful and we can say not having enough money is sinful we've got to be able to go right down the middle of the road brothers and sisters that's what I'm saying the synagogue of Satan brother bradam he quotes Revelations 2:9 B I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of Satan here is a verse that will bear considerable thought not only because it is most peculiar in its contents but also it is virtually repeated in an age over a thousand years later Revelations 2:9 I Know Thy works and tribulation and poverty but Thou Art rich and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of Satan to begin with the word Jews does not describe the religion of the Jewish people it refers only to the people of Judah and that has the same precise meaning if I were to say I am Irish born these people were saying that they were actually Jews real Jews by birth they were Liars they were not Jews by birth and they weren't Jews by religion if all this is true what were they they were a deceived people who were already part of the church they belong to the false Vine they were not of the true church but of the false church because God said they they were the synagogue of Satan now where is the Temple of the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters isn't it interesting because they're talking about a people that are the synagogue of Satan you're either going to be a temple for God or you're going to be a temple for Satan it's one or the other I think it just makes it so clear here now the word for synagogue is not the same word we use for church in the Bible Church means the called out ones or the summoned ones the psalmist said about these elect people in Psalm 654 blessed is the man whom thou choosest and causest to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts I just think it's so beautiful I was I was meditating on this as we listen to we're standing here because you've made a way isn't that wonderful he goes on to say but the meaning of synagogue is assembly or gathering this can be good or bad but in this case it's bad for these are they whose assembling is not of God but of their own selves Isaiah said of them Isaiah 54:15 behold they shall surely gather together but not by me whosoever Shall Gather gathered together against thee shall fall for thy sake and since these were surely against the True Vine God will one day deal with them in destruction just as sure as he will wipe away our tears those people will be destroyed amen now why do we have a people mixed in the framework of the church and calling themselves Jews the reason is this since they were Liars they could make any claim they wish they could say they wanted as though it were a fact and then stick to it and in this case they could be lying with a very powerful thought in mind was it not so that the early church was almost if not entirely composed of Jews making them the original members of his body the twel apostles were Jews and the later apostles were either Jews or prelit thus for men to swear they were Jews would give them a preeminence and a claim to originality tell a lie stick to it never mind fact or history just say it and keep saying it to the people and soon people will receive it now I'm not going to throw off one way or the other but I'm going to say you don't have to look very far brothers and sisters in media in in in the stuff that we've seen this that we've witnessed in the last decade you don't have to look very far and you can see that statement to be exactly right in society just in society not even in the church but here we have brother Bram the Prophet talking about this being specific to the church and the people who are a part of the false Vine who actually are the synagogue of Satan but mixed right in with the real church right just say it and keep saying it to the people and soon the people will receive it when I was reading that I was thinking oh glory to God get the Holy Ghost he's the only way the only truth the only life without him you will perish the Holy Ghost are perish the holy ghost or perish I'll keep saying it and people will receive it oh I love that I know he's talking about a negative context but I just wanted to smile tonight now did you catch something there isn't that the same Spirit right in the church today isn't there a group that claims that they are the original and true church and that salvation is found only in her don't they claim that they have the keys of the Kingdom which they received from Peter don't they claim that Peter was their first pope and that he resided in Rome when there is absolutely no historical fact for it and even her most educated and knowing adherence believe her lies Satan's synagogue he says and if Satan be her father and he the father of Lies then it is not strange that those in his synagogue are liars also consider the thought of blasphemy these of Satan's synagogue were not blaspheming God in this instance though that goes without saying this is kind of where I've been talking about in the past brothers and sisters but they were blaspheming the true church and what is blaspheming it's saying that the works of God the works of the Holy Ghost is of the devil that it's not true the persecution of Satan's synagogue in the true church the false Vine in the True Vine mixing it up they were blaspheming the true church certainly as Cain persecuted and killed Abel because he Cain was of that Wicked one we know we've gone over it in the scripture and and brother bradam talks about it in here that doesn't say that Cain was of Adam anywhere in the Bible he's not in the lineage of Adam anywhere in the Bible we know that Cain persecuted and killed Abel because he Cain was of that Wicked one that's what the word says and is the dead formal judaic followers Jesus said they were of their father the devil tried to destroy the Christians in the first few years of the first age now this same group The False Vine is even more strongly attempting to destroy the True Believer in the second age that Antichrist spirit is growing the group that in that inched its way ever so slowly into the church by its deed nickan ISM no longer fears exposure but is openly organized in a group of its own assembling and is coming against the true church in undisguised hostility and you know we don't have to look very far and we we've witnessed that even in the message I'm not going to say any more about it but you can connect the dots now when I say this was an organized Antichrist Church I am giving you the truth from authenticated history the first church founded in Rome we will Trace its history in the pergan age had already turned the truth of God into a Lie by introducing a Pagan religion with Christian names and meaning and I'll just insert this in here just read the Apostles Creed and if you ever want to see what a church is about just look at their about tab on their website click about and you'll see the Apostles Creed pop up in so many churches even the ones who aren't Catholic they're not Roman Catholic churches but they've got the Apostles Creed why because they're daughters right by the second age it was so Pagan though claiming to be the true church that polycarp came 1500 miles at a very old age to plead with them to turn back they would not do it they had a solid hierarchy and a solid organization and a complete departure from the word this then is Satan's synagogue full of blasphemy in which were already the seeds of the doctrine of nanism and which would shortly be the actual seat or power of satanic religion why people think that you've got to go to the the World Church of Satan to be a part of it and they have no idea that it's actually a a a deception Satan has deceived the whole world and anyone whose names were not found written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world will be following that that sounds terrible to say it but if we're worshiping anywhere outside of the token brothers and sisters what are we worshiping under I won't go too far with that either tonight got to stay focused here and this is exactly right for Revelations 2: 9B does not say these people are of Satan's synagogue but says they are Satan's synagogue Lord have mercy this Spirit of antichrist is not new this is not something that just came in the church ages it has been here all along to get a clear understanding of how it works how it goes against God and takes over in the church look at the Old Testament and see it there I just love how brother bam does this over and over and over let us examine this Spirit as it was manifested in Israel as she came out of Egypt to be the church in the wilderness just as the early church started out under the pure Ministry of the holy spirit with signs and wonders and manifestations such as prophecy tongues and interpretation wisdom knowledge and healing so in the days of Israel when they left Egypt they were under the leadership of the spirit of God manifesting in gifts God was the leader of the people actually he was their King he was a father King he took care of isra Israel like a man takes care of his family as I read this brothers and sisters I just want to say this remember Hebrews 138 the same yesterday today and forever he took care of Israel like a man takes care of his family he fed them fought their battles soothed smoothed away their difficulties and settled their problems he just busied himself over them he just buses himself over us doesn't he and they were the only nation to which he was truly God but one day they got to look and around and they saw the Philistines and other nations with Kings over them it caught their eyes and they decided that they ought to humanize their leadership so they wanted a king isn't this interesting it just struck me so powerfully brothers and sisters I've heard it many times we've all heard it many times they started looking around they saw the Philistines they saw they had had Kings but can you imagine what they were pattering themselves after pattering themselves after their enemies these were not friends these were their absolute enemies to the death the Philistines but this is what they wanted to do they wanted to be like them I say Lord help us not be like this world because the Philistines that we fight they're not not Giants roaming through the land kicking in our doors and taking taking what they want what they are is is Giants spiritually speaking coming to our houses and looking to see if we've got the token applied and if we don't then they will kick in our doors spiritually speaking so they wanted a king now God was going to humanize the leadership himself in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ but they got ahead of him isn't that interesting that just takes me right back to the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve were to be married marri they were to come together in in a spiritual union and to be able to reproduce children and somewhere in the message I know I don't have the quote again but somewhere in the message brother Bram says they just got ahead of God that's all they would have discovered it eventually but it was a spoken word creation That was supposed to happen not an actual sex act that started it all but they got ahead of them Satan knew the plan of God so he put it in the hearts of the people to get ahead of God the word so when they approached Samuel and asked for a King Samuel was so dismayed that his heart almost failed him God had been leading his people through this consecrated scripture Vindicated prophet and he felt that he had been rejected he gathered the people and pleaded with them not to turn away from The God Who had carried them like children and prospered them and blessed them him as long as they had God he fought all their battles amen of course they had to go and stand on the front lines they had to get out of bed in the morning and go to work they couldn't just say God bless me and stay in their tents they had to go and stand in Array they had to follow the instructions of the Lord but he prospered them and he blessed them but they persisted they said to Samuel you have never been wrong in your leading you have never been dishonest in your financial dealings you have done your best to keep us in line with the word of the lord we appreciate all the Miracles the wisdom provision and protection of God we believe in it we like it it's this just trips me up when I read this when I I listen to it and I read it and I study it and I ponder it and furthermore we don't want to be without it it's just you know it's just that we want to King to lead us into battle now of course when we go out to battle it is still Our intention to have all the priests go ahead with Judah following and we will blow the trumpets and shout and sing We don't intend to stop any of that but we want to King who is one of us to lead us I say Lord have mercy brothers and sisters we don't want one of us to lead us the moment that happens we're doomed doomed it's got to be the Holy Ghost leadership over the congregation no matter where no matter when I just think it's sad to hear this the way he's he's he's he's written it you know we know that brother bradam said that in in uh trying to do God a service without it being his will he said that they had all the religious motion but still they were out of the will of God they never had it right because that Ark was supposed to be carried over the hearts of the Levites it was not supposed to be on a new cart but just trying to put our own spin on it hey trying to figure it out our own way make it sound good the devil's going to do that with us make it sound so reasonable and rational to our minds but the word of God is anything but rational and God said to Samuel see they haven't rejected you but they have rejected me from ruling over them be the same thing as a woman cutting her hair for her husband showing that she's just absolutely dishonoring her head she no longer wants his leadership how tragic that was little did they realize that when they were asking God to let them be like the rest of the the world they were rejecting him because God had ordained that his people act different from the world they are not of the world and they don't look like the world and they don't act like the world they are crucified unto the world and the world is crucified unto them 2 Corinthians 67 and 18 wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate it sayith the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you excuse me and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the Lord Almighty you see the one difference between Israel and the rest of the Nations was God put God to one side and Israel was like any other Nation right when Samson cut off his hair he was like any other man put the leadership of the Holy Ghost aside and the church is nothing but the world with God's name attached to it help us Lord the world and the church are all of the same lump just like Jacob and Esau were of the same parents but the spirit of God makes the difference you know one one of these days I bet they're going to take this book and they're going to say you're not allowed to actually talk about this you're not allowed to say these words I I can see it coming yeah to think that that really put the leadership of the Holy Ghost aside and the church is nothing but the word world with God's name attached to it the world and the church the the world and the church are all of the same lump goodness sakes it makes it pretty cut and dried just like Jacob and Esau were of the same parents but the spirit of God makes a difference and here brothers and sisters this is the Crux of it I think tonight this is probably not where I'm going to stop but if we had to say one thing to take away from this service this is it this paragraph it doesn't matter if you call yourself a Christian doesn't matter if you call yourself a message believer doesn't matter if you say that you've been around for decades it doesn't matter what you call yourself anyone can do that the point is whether you whether or not you have the spirit of God in you for without the spirit you are a reprobate you are none of his amen so this is where I think it gets really really Pinchy brothers and sisters even if we're in a message church if we don't have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we're the same as the lump of the world now I want to say for anyone who desires to get the Holy Ghost there's a purpose for that it's because you're one of his and you're not part of that lump children might not have the Holy Ghost but the parents better parents better not even be married without the Holy Ghost in their lives something's seriously wrong if that's the case but the parents are the Holy Ghost for the children until the age of accountability when God deals with those children sovereignly but there's no difference because we're in these walls here brothers and sisters just because we claim the message of the hour it doesn't matter but you take this word and put it on your lips and you're going to have those giants trembling he says not too long ago I asked a lady if she were a Christian she said can you imagine this she said to me I will have you to know sir that I burn a candle every night I love the way brother brandom says this what in the world has that got to do with it I'm a Methodist I'm a Baptist I'm a Pentecostal I'm going to say this I'm a message believer yeah that hasn't got a thing to do with it it's the holy ghost or perish that's all brothers and sisters it's the holy ghost or Parish well starting way back there in the first church the people got to thinking and reasoning how to improve on God how can you improve on God the Deeds of the nians began showing themselves then a group formed they drifted away from the pattern of the word all it takes is just one word changed and that little leaven then leavens the whole lump he that offends in one point of the law is guilty of all Eve just changed one word that will do it and when Satan when that Satan centered group was formed it began to hate and fight the true believers insisting that they the aliens were the Church of God now I want to say something here about the message of the hour when you see that behavior has anybody ever seen that behavior in the message of the hour need I say more notice how organization breeds hatred it destroys Fellowship it makes bitterness but yet we had a prophet who actually was the one that we all CL claim to believe who drew the circle bigger didn't he the testimony was is that you couldn't tell his friend from his enemy and remember there's uh I I talked about a little while ago but brother Bram says he talks about his church in the Tabernacle there's people talking about some of the people that left I think Junior Jackson might be one of them brother Parnell might be another one they left brother bram's church and started other churches and and some of the people in the church were calling them uh dead birds that's a direct quote quot to dead birds and brother Bram said uh uh uh uh uh that is not right you need to actually repent for that because they're not dead birds they are Brothers and Sisters in Christ if they're following Jesus Christ then you just leave them alone because it's up to God to deal with each one of us but yet somehow somewhere along the way what's crept into the message of the hour for people to think that they can be bitter about people that they can actually just be bitter and separate what is that we know what is we're reading all about it right here notice how organization breeds hatred it destroys Fellowship it makes bitterness that is what myr means this is what Smyrna was full of bitterness a root of bitterness defiles many so more and more defilement was coming in every age would feel its scars my doesn't time fly when you're having fun I better call the musicians the suan church had drifted far from the original it had become hybrid it had hybridized itself the way Eve did you know that a hybrid is what comes of two species mixing the result is no longer pure like the original it's Mongrel well when e Eve allowed the Beast to mingle his seed with hers she produced a creature called Cain that wasn't pure human here we go again he was of the wicked one notice how different he was from Abel notice how different he was from Seth he hated God and would not obey the word even when God came came to him and told him you know what if you would just do like your brother but if you don't then sin lith right at your door and he knew full well what would happen but he gave him the space to repent to prove who he was to demonstrate his character he had to have that opportunity to show who he was and that's what happens in our age brothers and sisters we're living at the end of the seventh Church age beyond the seventh Church age even in the bride age but the age in which we live in is actually it's it's the manifesting time isn't it this word will bring to life every single seed and there's no way that we can hide what's inside of us that's why when we have the opportunity to get into the Holy Ghost I think it's just the greatest thing but we know that he hated God and would not obey the word and persecuted and killed the righteous maybe stand with me as we close tonight when we see that when we see that happening around the churches brothers and sisters persecution of the righteous my goodness we can see the nature I just want to say God richly bless you and you know I'm going to go back to that paragraph 54 I'll close with this if there's one point to take away tonight it doesn't matter if you call yourself a Christian anyone can do that the point is whether or not you have the spirit of God in you for without the spirit you are reprobate you are none of his amen let's just bow in prayer Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight I believe we can all say Amen to this word that we've heard we're so thankful Lord that you gave us a prophet Lord not because we worship him but because you spoke to us through him you chose him father to minister your word to us and how do we know that it's true that it's your word because it points directly to your word he doesn't try to change your word he didn't try to do that he tried to encourage us to not do that to take your pure word and to allow your spirit to Quicken it to us Lord father we thank you for your quickening spirit Lord we thank you for the dynamic power of your Holy Ghost and tonight father I just pray that each and every one of us would have your quickening spirit living out through US Lord and father if we have ever Lord done something to diminish that Spirit father we pray that you would just show us help us oh Father lead us and guide us give us the opportunity to get that Spirit back to where we know that it should be in our lives father and if anybody doesn't have that spirit and desires for it Lord Jesus Oh Lord let tonight be the night father it doesn't have to be another night it doesn't have to be another day if we have that desire father we know that you are more than willing to give us of your spirit father a thousand times more willing than we are willing to accept it father help us to deal with this hybrid condition Lord Jesus and just get ourselves out of the way Lord to let that old nature die out father let that old man get buried and leave him there father Lord Jesus help us not to dig him back up again but to let them die father and just let you live father Lord we love you and we thank you tonight we pray that you would just be with each one father that you would just be that encouragement that we need when we go to bed tonight father Lord Jesus that encouragement that we need when we open our eyes tomorrow father maybe even before we open our eyes Lord let us think could today be that day oh Father where we step out of this Dimension into that other dimension into the theophany bodies that you already have ready for us Lord father we know that that day is close and we just pray that you would give us the strength we need father we know that you gave every single age strength father and Lord that every age went through persecutions and trials and we know that every single age Lord is going to look to us to say how did we overcome the combination of all Seven Ages and we'll say only by Your Grace it's only by your grace that we are saved through faith we love you
