[51:06] thank you musicians
[51:08] if you have your Bibles today
[51:11] I just would like to read another
[51:13] scripture another Direction
[51:16] [Music]
[51:17] as we go forwards towards the Easter
[51:20] season out of John chapter 11.
[51:26] John chapter 11.
[51:32] maybe a very
[51:35] familiar scripture for many
[51:38] John chapter 11.
[51:41] and then I'd like to turn over to
[51:42] Revelations chapter 1.
[51:50] John chapter 11.
[51:52] start reading with
[51:55] verse 23.
[52:01] Jesus saith unto her
[52:03] thy brother shall rise again
[52:07] Martha saith unto him I know that he
[52:10] shall rise again in the resurrection at
[52:12] the last day
[52:14] Jesus said unto her
[52:16] I am the resurrection and the life
[52:20] he that believeth in me though he were
[52:22] dead
[52:23] yet shall he live
[52:25] and whosoever liveth and believeth on me
[52:28] shall never die
[52:30] believe us thou is this
[52:33] if you could turn over to Revelation
[52:35] chapter 1
[52:39] . again familiar scripture
[52:43] Revelation chapter one
[52:47] just like to read from verse 12.
[52:55] Revelation chapter 1 verse 12 and it
[52:58] turned to see the voice that spake with
[53:00] me
[53:01] and being turned I saw seven golden
[53:04] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[53:06] seven candlesticks one like unto the son
[53:08] of man
[53:10] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[53:12] and Gert about the pops with the golden
[53:14] girdle
[53:15] his head
[53:17] and his hairs were white like wool and
[53:20] white as snow and his eyes were as a
[53:23] flame of fire
[53:25] and his feet like unto fine brass as if
[53:28] they burned in a furnace and his voice
[53:30] as the sound of many Waters
[53:33] and he had in his right hand Seven Stars
[53:35] and out of his mouth when a sharp
[53:36] two-edged sword and his countenance was
[53:39] as the sun shineth
[53:41] in his strength
[53:42] and when I saw him I fell at his feet as
[53:46] dead and he laid his right hand upon me
[53:48] saying unto me fear not
[53:51] I am the first and the last I am he that
[53:53] liveth and was dead and behold I Am
[53:57] Alive forevermore amen
[54:00] and have the keys of hell and death
[54:03] let's just bow one more time
[54:07] Heavenly Father we thank you for these
[54:09] words Lord that we've read this morning
[54:12] we know that it's identifying you
[54:16] and father we just pray that you would
[54:18] help us Lord Jesus as we walk along the
[54:21] way this morning that you would speak to
[54:23] us just like those two along the way to
[54:25] Emmaus Lord
[54:27] father we pray that we would not be slow
[54:29] in heart father to believe all that the
[54:31] prophets have said but that Lord Jesus
[54:33] you would just Quicken this word
[54:35] to our very Souls today
[54:38] we ask all these things now in Jesus
[54:40] Christ's name we pray amen God bless you
[54:42] this morning you may be seated
[54:47] story
[54:49] that I wanted to mention
[54:54] is The Story of Lazarus
[54:58] I want to talk about Lazarus this
[54:59] morning and really kind of the idea so
[55:02] you know where I'm going with it is
[55:04] the events kind of the highlights
[55:07] leading up to the crucifixion of Jesus
[55:09] going into the Easter season Jesus got
[55:13] pretty busy just before the crucifixion
[55:15] and we know the prophet said that many
[55:18] many scriptures were fulfilled many
[55:21] prophecies were fulfilled in the last
[55:23] few hours of his life
[55:26] but this one today in the story
[55:29] um
[55:31] he asked her
[55:33] believer style this
[55:34] that's pretty much the inspiration today
[55:36] believe us thou this if you type that in
[55:39] there's many different
[55:40] titles that brother Branham preached
[55:42] this one's from 1960 I believe
[55:46] is thou this
[55:48] but the people in their day they saw
[55:50] Jesus as a good friend but Branham says
[55:53] that uh
[55:55] Jesus
[55:57] he even lived with Lazarus and Mary and
[55:59] Martha for a while he stayed with them
[56:03] and it's an interesting story the way
[56:05] brother Brown brings it he says that he
[56:08] knew what was going on because even
[56:10] though he was Jesus in the flesh
[56:13] he wasn't Jesus in the soul he wasn't
[56:16] Jesus in the spirit he was God all God
[56:21] and to make him anything else means that
[56:23] we're all lost we're lost as lost could
[56:26] be that's it in a nutshell some people
[56:28] want to see a Holy Trinity they want to
[56:31] see the father and they want to see the
[56:33] son and they want to see the Holy Spirit
[56:35] as individuals and and different
[56:38] personalities and we go and make it
[56:40] idolatry at that point and we're not
[56:42] interested in that at all because we
[56:45] recognize that God is the father and God
[56:48] is the Son and God is the Holy Ghost the
[56:53] three are one it's not it's not
[56:55] different personalities different
[56:57] persons of the Trinity it can't be
[57:00] it's got to be just one person God
[57:03] himself
[57:04] and this is who is standing in their
[57:06] midst this is who is living with them in
[57:09] their house this is who
[57:12] Mary washed his feet this is the one the
[57:17] one that we just read in Revelations
[57:19] chapter one because if you read it the
[57:21] very first verse the second verse of
[57:24] Revelations chapter one The revelation
[57:26] of Jesus Christ
[57:28] not the revelation of the Holy Spirit
[57:29] not the revelation of God the Father not
[57:33] a title the revelation of Jesus Christ
[57:35] the one who had the hair white as wool
[57:38] the one who had eyes as the flame of
[57:41] fire that's the one that was standing in
[57:43] their midst that day
[57:45] in Lazarus day
[57:47] personally I think it's amazing because
[57:49] that's the same one that's come to Earth
[57:51] today in the form of his word and the
[57:55] whole entire world is looking for this
[57:57] one to come according to a traditional
[57:59] teaching a maybe a a denominational
[58:02] Theory maybe something from a a a Bible
[58:06] College somewhere a teaching that that
[58:08] Jesus is going to come a certain way and
[58:10] this is the way we believe it but you
[58:12] know God has always spoken to his people
[58:14] a certain way and it's not been through
[58:15] a bible college and it's not been
[58:18] through the Pharisees or the Sadducees
[58:20] we know that the most religious people
[58:21] of his day are the ones that actually
[58:24] crucified him they are the ones of his
[58:27] day that took up Stones when he said I
[58:30] and my father are one those notable
[58:32] words and he said wherefore do you want
[58:34] to persecute why do you want to kill me
[58:35] what's going on why do you want to do
[58:37] that
[58:39] and they said not because of the mighty
[58:41] good works that you do you're a really
[58:42] nice guy we really like you
[58:45] we like the works that you do we love
[58:47] that people get healed we love that you
[58:49] draw great crowds and we can actually
[58:51] get tremendous some sums of money from
[58:53] the amount of people that you draw It's
[58:55] a Wonderful campaign that you have
[58:57] but my goodness when you go make
[58:59] yourself one with God then that's
[59:00] getting to be a little bit too much
[59:02] then you're going a little bit too far
[59:04] and that's where we're going to have to
[59:05] draw the line and you know brothers and
[59:07] sisters that's the same thing for us
[59:09] today it's no different as soon as we
[59:11] start saying I and my father are one as
[59:13] soon as this word is inside of me
[59:16] you know we can't sing that song and not
[59:19] see it any other way the word is working
[59:21] mightily in me what's happening when the
[59:23] word is working mightily and me are we
[59:25] just singing a song and clapping our
[59:26] hands and and getting into the the
[59:28] spirit of the service the word is
[59:29] working mightily and me it's a wonderful
[59:31] time and then I'm just gonna go home or
[59:33] are we eating the book and the word is
[59:35] actually working mightily in me when I
[59:38] go to work when I go to school when I go
[59:40] home my family sees that this word is
[59:42] working mightily in me
[59:44] because that's really what that song is
[59:46] about brothers and sisters it's not
[59:48] about getting in the spirit of the
[59:49] service it's wonderful to get in the
[59:51] spirit of the service brother Branham
[59:53] says it you've got to get into the
[59:55] spirit of things if you want to get into
[59:57] it you've got to get into the spirit of
[59:59] it and the only way you're going to do
[1:00:02] that is by Revelation to recognize God's
[1:00:04] presence that he's here in our midst and
[1:00:08] when we come to church we come to church
[1:00:10] to meet with God that's why we come to
[1:00:12] church
[1:00:14] I just think the the story here today
[1:00:16] out of John chapter 11 is is a fantastic
[1:00:20] story
[1:00:22] and you know
[1:00:24] we know the story very well
[1:00:27] I'm just going to start with a quote
[1:00:28] here the Patmos Vision brother Bradham
[1:00:30] and the church age book he says is his
[1:00:32] eyes were as fire he says think of it
[1:00:34] those eyes that were once dimmed with
[1:00:37] tears of sorrow and pity those eyes that
[1:00:40] wept with compassion at the grave of
[1:00:42] Lazarus those eyes that saw not the evil
[1:00:46] of the murderers who hanged him on a
[1:00:49] cross but in sorrow cried father forgive
[1:00:53] them
[1:00:54] now those eyes are a flame of fire
[1:00:58] the eyes
[1:00:59] of the judge who will recompense those
[1:01:02] who rejected him
[1:01:04] of all the human emotions he manifested
[1:01:06] the most when he appeared as the son of
[1:01:10] man was this one
[1:01:11] he wept often
[1:01:14] I think it's amazing to see this he wept
[1:01:16] often and you know brother Branham he
[1:01:19] talks about it in this in this message
[1:01:20] the uh believer style this in 1960 at
[1:01:23] the end of it how the woman challenged
[1:01:25] him what we'll probably if we have time
[1:01:26] we'll read the quote near the end of it
[1:01:28] but she challenged him and said how
[1:01:30] could he weep at the grave of Lazarus if
[1:01:32] he was divine if he was God how could he
[1:01:34] do that I'll and she was arguing she was
[1:01:36] challenging him saying that he wasn't
[1:01:38] Divine it wasn't it wasn't God he was
[1:01:39] just a great prophet brother Bradham
[1:01:41] says that's that story is about as as
[1:01:43] strong as the broth that was made from
[1:01:46] the shadow of a chicken that starved to
[1:01:48] death
[1:01:49] how could you say that God himself
[1:01:51] couldn't weep
[1:01:53] how could he not weep he was a man
[1:01:56] but he was God he was all that but he
[1:01:58] was all God
[1:02:00] brother Adam says he wept often
[1:02:02] yet behind that weeping and that sorrow
[1:02:05] there was still God
[1:02:07] those same eyes
[1:02:09] saw Visions they look deep within the
[1:02:12] hearts of men and read their very
[1:02:14] thoughts
[1:02:15] I knew all their various ways
[1:02:19] blazing out of mortal Eyes Of God who
[1:02:22] cried to those who knew him not for what
[1:02:25] he was
[1:02:26] if ye believe not that I am he you shall
[1:02:30] die in your sins John 8 24. if I do not
[1:02:33] the works of my father believe me not
[1:02:35] but if I do the works of my father
[1:02:36] though you believe me not believe the
[1:02:38] works John 10 37 38.
[1:02:42] like Jeremiah of old he was the weeping
[1:02:44] prophet
[1:02:45] for men receive not the word of God
[1:02:48] and thrust aside the revelation
[1:02:51] and that's kind of where we want to go
[1:02:53] today brothers and sisters we don't want
[1:02:54] to thrust aside the revelation we want
[1:02:57] to recognize God in our presence this is
[1:03:01] God when we talk about Jesus Christ
[1:03:02] we're talking about God himself when we
[1:03:04] talk about the Holy Ghost we're talking
[1:03:06] about God himself you can't separate
[1:03:09] them
[1:03:11] Holy Ghost is the spirit of God
[1:03:13] in Jesus Christ
[1:03:16] the father is a father
[1:03:18] the father is a father he could be
[1:03:20] anybody's father how many fathers are
[1:03:21] there in this room even in this world
[1:03:23] let alone how many sons are there
[1:03:26] and how many Holy Spirits are there
[1:03:29] we could we could just say that they're
[1:03:31] titles they're not actually names but we
[1:03:34] know the word of God says to baptize the
[1:03:36] name of the Father the name of the son
[1:03:37] the name of the Holy Ghost we can take
[1:03:39] that literally and just run forward with
[1:03:40] it is what happened with many
[1:03:42] denominationals but if we just step back
[1:03:44] and think about it for a second what is
[1:03:46] the name of the father what is the name
[1:03:48] of the son what is the name of the Holy
[1:03:50] Ghost The Book of Revelation here says
[1:03:52] that it's the revelation of
[1:03:53] the Father the Son or the Holy Ghost no
[1:03:56] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:04:02] if I do not the works of my father
[1:04:03] believe me not but if I do the works of
[1:04:05] my father believe ye
[1:04:07] though he believe me not believe the
[1:04:09] works
[1:04:12] brother Brown goes on to say those fiery
[1:04:14] flaming eyes of the judge are even now
[1:04:17] recording the lives of All Flesh
[1:04:21] this is where it gets interesting
[1:04:24] he's here in this room right now
[1:04:26] brothers and sisters
[1:04:27] maybe in your living rooms in your cars
[1:04:30] wherever you might be he's there with
[1:04:31] you right now recording the thoughts in
[1:04:34] your hearts I remember hearing about
[1:04:36] this man who is a manifestation of the
[1:04:38] word of God in our day William Miriam
[1:04:41] Branham and hearing that there was this
[1:04:43] man that could discern the hearts of men
[1:04:44] it was one of the gifts that he was
[1:04:46] given as a sign to capture the attention
[1:04:49] of the people so that the word could be
[1:04:51] open to them so that they would have
[1:04:52] their attention focused on this man to
[1:04:54] see what was going on with him but he
[1:04:56] could discern the very thoughts in the
[1:04:58] hearts of a man and I I remember
[1:04:59] thinking that's a man that I'm never
[1:05:01] going to meet because I know that I'm a
[1:05:03] skunk and if the world if people knew
[1:05:05] the thoughts that were inside of my
[1:05:06] heart oh my
[1:05:08] it would be terrible
[1:05:09] but you know brothers and sisters many
[1:05:11] times those thoughts aren't even ours
[1:05:13] but Satan will say they are he'll tell
[1:05:15] us they're our thoughts but they're not
[1:05:17] our thoughts I know brother Bradham says
[1:05:19] it in places that we don't even have a
[1:05:20] thought coming we've got either Thoughts
[1:05:22] From God or we've got thoughts from the
[1:05:23] devil I remember as a kid we had TV in
[1:05:26] our home and one of the cartoons would
[1:05:28] always show a little devil on one
[1:05:30] shoulder and an angel on the other
[1:05:32] shoulder and one was influencing one way
[1:05:34] and one was influencing the other way
[1:05:36] and it seemed like a joke like it's just
[1:05:38] a cartoon but it's I think probably a
[1:05:40] whole lot more real than we actually
[1:05:42] give it credit not not to say that a
[1:05:44] cartoon is a good thing I don't want to
[1:05:46] do that but I want to say that you know
[1:05:48] what we're influenced one way or the
[1:05:50] other and and whoever we give the credit
[1:05:52] is what's going to happen in our lives
[1:05:55] but the random talked about the the the
[1:05:58] First Nations chief
[1:06:01] remember that story and he says how you
[1:06:04] doing Chief and he says wow it depends
[1:06:06] on the day you know and and he says what
[1:06:08] do you mean chief and he says well some
[1:06:10] days good some days bad and how do you
[1:06:13] know the difference well some days one
[1:06:15] one I have two dogs the story of the two
[1:06:17] dogs fighting right the the light one
[1:06:19] and the dark one the white one the black
[1:06:21] one and how one one wins and the other
[1:06:24] loses and some days it's the other way
[1:06:25] around and he says how do you know the
[1:06:27] difference and he says it's the one that
[1:06:28] I feed the most
[1:06:32] it's beautiful when we talk about this
[1:06:34] because really it's it's all about who
[1:06:36] we feed who are we feeding on what are
[1:06:39] we feeding on in our lives that's what's
[1:06:42] going to do it for us and you know
[1:06:44] brothers and sisters I say Lord help me
[1:06:45] I want to make sure that I'm feeding in
[1:06:47] the right sources I want to be doing the
[1:06:49] right thing I'm a man I'm susceptible to
[1:06:51] the pressures of this life but there's
[1:06:53] only one thing that makes me different
[1:06:54] from everyone else and not any different
[1:06:56] than a Believer but it's the word of God
[1:06:58] and just just just just believing
[1:07:00] without this just saying that I believe
[1:07:02] the word of God and I accept it for me
[1:07:05] in my day that's the only thing that we
[1:07:06] can do
[1:07:07] we can't say that we have any good works
[1:07:10] that we could bring you know we sang
[1:07:11] that song years I spent in vanity and
[1:07:14] pride oh my not knowing that my my my my
[1:07:17] Lord was crucified and why was he
[1:07:20] crucified it wasn't for everyone else in
[1:07:22] this world it was for me
[1:07:24] was just for me and that's another song
[1:07:27] that we sing I can go keep going on but
[1:07:29] songs I don't really mean to do that but
[1:07:30] it's just a wonderful thing to recognize
[1:07:32] it's got to be our own experience it's
[1:07:35] got to be our own savior he has to die
[1:07:38] for me for this guy when we can
[1:07:40] recognize that brothers and sisters then
[1:07:42] those flaming eyes of judgment turn to
[1:07:45] Eyes Of Love because we can recognize
[1:07:47] that though all these other people in
[1:07:49] the world haven't been chosen to be
[1:07:51] given the position in him he chose you
[1:07:54] he chose me to have ears to hear what
[1:07:56] the spirit saith unto the church to be
[1:07:58] able to say Amen to the word and you
[1:08:01] know some people will be able to go all
[1:08:03] the way to Calvary and accept that Jesus
[1:08:05] Christ died for their sins and and rose
[1:08:07] again on the third day
[1:08:09] and they will rise with him as well in
[1:08:11] the resurrection there's no question
[1:08:13] about that and we're not here to put
[1:08:15] anybody in or put anybody out we're just
[1:08:18] here to promote Jesus Christ the same
[1:08:20] yesterday today and forever not not to
[1:08:22] say that he is just Jesus Christ back
[1:08:23] there at Calvary 2000 years ago no he
[1:08:26] has to be alive and well today two
[1:08:29] thousand years later it's got to be the
[1:08:30] Lord Jesus Christ for me my own personal
[1:08:33] experience
[1:08:35] those fiery flaming eyes brother Adam
[1:08:37] says of the judge or even now recording
[1:08:40] the lives of All Flesh running to and
[1:08:42] fro throughout the Earth there was
[1:08:43] nothing he does not know
[1:08:46] I love that there's nothing that he does
[1:08:48] not know so when we have stuff in our
[1:08:50] lives that we're not willing to deal
[1:08:52] with there's doors that that we get so
[1:08:55] close up to and then we freak out and
[1:08:57] run away because we're just about there
[1:08:59] to open that door and he wants to open
[1:09:01] that door he wants to get into that door
[1:09:03] in the door but then we just can't deal
[1:09:05] with it there's nothing that he doesn't
[1:09:06] know
[1:09:07] it's that we don't know
[1:09:09] we just need to open that door and allow
[1:09:11] him in and he'll deal with the stuff
[1:09:15] and he's just waiting
[1:09:17] remember the story The the picture of
[1:09:19] Jesus on the outside knocking to get in
[1:09:22] this is the only church age that he was
[1:09:24] put out
[1:09:26] by the church and he's on the outside
[1:09:28] knocking to get in and remember brother
[1:09:31] Adam he said that story there was one
[1:09:33] problem with that picture the guy the
[1:09:34] artist never put the handle the door
[1:09:36] handle on the door and he said no no
[1:09:38] that was intentional and the reason for
[1:09:40] that is because the door handle is only
[1:09:41] on one side the door handles on the
[1:09:43] inside of the building and and he can't
[1:09:45] open the door he's not going to open the
[1:09:47] door and force his way in he's going to
[1:09:48] knock like a gentleman because he is a
[1:09:50] gentleman he's going to say hey can I
[1:09:51] come in are you going to welcome me are
[1:09:53] you going to wash my feet are you going
[1:09:54] to appreciate me and anoint me with oil
[1:09:56] are you going to wash me with your hair
[1:09:58] are you going to take care of me and
[1:10:00] acknowledge me or are you just going to
[1:10:01] invite me and leave me knocking on the
[1:10:03] outside and say welcome Jesus we want
[1:10:05] you to come Jesus welcome welcome
[1:10:07] welcome
[1:10:08] but we're just going to leave you on the
[1:10:09] outside
[1:10:11] that door handle is on the inside for us
[1:10:13] to open and and brother around him
[1:10:14] preached that message doors indoor he
[1:10:16] doesn't want to have any door left left
[1:10:18] closed there's no door on the secret
[1:10:20] chamber underneath the stairs hidden
[1:10:22] room that we just have stuff hidden in
[1:10:24] we want it to be all open for him to be
[1:10:27] able to have free access because there's
[1:10:29] things in our lives brothers and sisters
[1:10:31] that we cannot deal with on our own
[1:10:34] there's things that we don't have the
[1:10:36] power over there's things that that you
[1:10:38] know what could be from Generations
[1:10:40] before us
[1:10:41] from our fathers from our grandfathers
[1:10:43] from our great-grandfathers
[1:10:46] you know the word says that he will
[1:10:47] visit the iniquity
[1:10:49] upon the children
[1:10:51] to the third and the fourth generation
[1:10:54] who knows what could happen
[1:10:56] I've been taking a look recently at the
[1:10:58] uh
[1:11:00] the coronation the whole thought the
[1:11:01] theory of the royal monarchy I've never
[1:11:04] really paid that much attention to it I
[1:11:06] I always thought you know it's nice and
[1:11:09] there's so much attention to the Royal
[1:11:10] monarchy and you know when you when you
[1:11:13] look at the the documentation of the
[1:11:17] lives of the royal monarchy it goes back
[1:11:19] a long long ways and there is actually a
[1:11:23] a royal I don't know what you call it a
[1:11:25] lineage maybe website on on the Royal
[1:11:28] website whichever you call it I can't
[1:11:30] remember what you call it but it and it
[1:11:32] actually explains all of the different
[1:11:34] lives all of the different sovereigns
[1:11:36] all the different Kings and the ruling
[1:11:38] peoples and parties that from from the
[1:11:41] monarchy all the way back to the very
[1:11:43] beginning and you could read for a long
[1:11:45] long time but you don't want to spend
[1:11:47] too much time with it you know but I
[1:11:49] just think it's fascinating to think
[1:11:50] that there's that much documentation but
[1:11:52] to see all of that brothers and sisters
[1:11:55] if if man can do that how much more of a
[1:11:58] recording is there in heaven where the
[1:12:00] sins of the fathers are being visited
[1:12:03] upon the sins of this
[1:12:05] third and fourth generation of the
[1:12:07] children it's astounding when you think
[1:12:08] about it if men can record that well
[1:12:10] what does happen in heaven what's God
[1:12:13] doing there but you know as for
[1:12:15] believers when we accept the word for
[1:12:17] our day when anybody in any age accepted
[1:12:19] the word for their day
[1:12:21] those flaming eyes of judgment turn to
[1:12:25] Eyes Of Love
[1:12:27] they're no longer eyes of judgment
[1:12:29] that's where we can say hey you know
[1:12:31] what if you want to put me on the stake
[1:12:33] and you want to burn me on the stake you
[1:12:35] don't have to bind my hands just put me
[1:12:37] on on the stake and and just light it up
[1:12:39] just go for it just light it up and what
[1:12:42] happens the the supernatural takes over
[1:12:45] and we know the stories we've heard them
[1:12:47] many times people cannot die the Flames
[1:12:50] will lick up around the people and
[1:12:52] they'll still be alive and and the
[1:12:54] people will be like why aren't they
[1:12:55] dying what's wrong with them take a
[1:12:57] spear and actually stab them and they'll
[1:12:59] stab them with a spear and water will
[1:13:01] pour out of their body and put out the
[1:13:03] flames
[1:13:04] this is real documented stuff by the way
[1:13:06] this is history that's recorded as well
[1:13:09] it can happen but you know we're not
[1:13:13] interested in the signs or wonders
[1:13:14] necessarily we're interested in finding
[1:13:16] out that those flaming eyes of judgment
[1:13:19] recording our very lives right now
[1:13:23] that they're not eyes of judgment
[1:13:25] there's Our Eyes Of Love
[1:13:27] and their eyes of forgiveness
[1:13:29] their eyes of Grace
[1:13:31] those eyes that brother Bradham said
[1:13:33] when he he saw that vision of Jesus and
[1:13:36] and and he saw the vision of him in the
[1:13:38] in the field in the sagebrush field and
[1:13:41] this man was there and he gives a very
[1:13:43] graphic description of what he saw and
[1:13:45] he was just kind of looking away he
[1:13:47] wasn't really looking directly at
[1:13:48] brother Bradham but but he tried to
[1:13:51] clear his throat to get his attention
[1:13:52] and he tried a few different methods to
[1:13:54] get his attention but then he finally
[1:13:56] said his name and when he said his name
[1:13:58] he said that face that looked at him he
[1:14:00] had the power to stop everything to turn
[1:14:03] the world upside down that power in
[1:14:07] those eyes those flaming eyes of
[1:14:10] judgment
[1:14:11] look at him says those fiery flaming
[1:14:13] eyes of the judge are even now recording
[1:14:15] the lives of All Flesh running to and
[1:14:16] fro throughout the Earth there is
[1:14:19] nothing he does not know he knows the
[1:14:21] desires of the heart and what each one
[1:14:24] intends to do
[1:14:26] there is nothing hidden that shall not
[1:14:28] be revealed for all things are naked
[1:14:30] before him with whom we have to do think
[1:14:33] of it he knows even now what you are
[1:14:36] thinking
[1:14:38] yes he stands as judge with flaming eyes
[1:14:42] to meet out judgment
[1:14:44] the day of Mercy is over
[1:14:46] oh that man might repent and seek his
[1:14:49] face in righteousness while there is yet
[1:14:51] time
[1:14:52] that they might make his bosom their
[1:14:54] pillow Heir the world dissolves in fire
[1:14:59] just wanted to to bring that quote just
[1:15:01] to
[1:15:02] maybe set a little bit of a background
[1:15:04] that you know this one who is at the
[1:15:07] tomb of Lazarus this one that was living
[1:15:09] with Mary and Martha this one that was a
[1:15:12] a good bosom friend of Lazarus
[1:15:15] this one was God himself this was the
[1:15:18] creator the one that spoke and said let
[1:15:21] there be light
[1:15:23] this is the one that created man this is
[1:15:25] the one that pulled Eve outside of man
[1:15:27] that performed the very first surgery
[1:15:30] this is the one that said Thou shalt eat
[1:15:32] of every single tree in the garden
[1:15:34] except for that one don't you dare touch
[1:15:36] that one tree because the moment you do
[1:15:38] you shall die that day you shall die
[1:15:41] that was the one who was with them there
[1:15:45] and you know it's a it's an interesting
[1:15:48] thing because brother Brady talks about
[1:15:50] the story and how Mary and Martha they
[1:15:54] they had different ways about them one
[1:15:57] was very concerned about the Earthly
[1:15:59] matters and and getting things done and
[1:16:01] the other one was interested about
[1:16:03] hearing every single word of the master
[1:16:05] hanging on every single word and and she
[1:16:08] was judged for that for hanging on every
[1:16:11] single word and we could be judged that
[1:16:13] way too brothers and sisters in our day
[1:16:15] even though we have responsibilities
[1:16:17] there's something that constrains us to
[1:16:19] the word of God in our day I think it's
[1:16:22] just such a beautiful thought to to
[1:16:24] think about verse 26 and whosoever
[1:16:26] liveth and believeth in me shall never
[1:16:29] die
[1:16:30] believe us thou this
[1:16:32] I think that's such a beautiful
[1:16:34] scripture because you know the the word
[1:16:35] of God talks about there being ten
[1:16:38] virgins right there's five wise virgins
[1:16:41] and there's five unwise virgins and and
[1:16:45] we know in our our time where we live
[1:16:47] it's been very clearly said that the
[1:16:49] wise virgins they had oil it's what the
[1:16:51] Bible says and The unwise Virgins they
[1:16:54] had oil but they didn't have enough
[1:16:56] they were just lacking their oil
[1:16:59] and when the bridegroom came the shout
[1:17:01] came forth the five wise were able to
[1:17:05] rise up and trim their lamps the shout
[1:17:07] went forth
[1:17:08] rise and trim your lamps and and they
[1:17:11] did that but the other five they
[1:17:13] couldn't trim them right because they
[1:17:15] didn't have enough oil they started to
[1:17:16] sputter and carbon and and burn Smoky
[1:17:19] and and they said to the wise give us of
[1:17:21] your oil and they said no not so we
[1:17:23] don't have enough for us and you you got
[1:17:24] to go buy your own you got to go and and
[1:17:26] get your own and we know the word says
[1:17:28] that well they went to get some because
[1:17:30] they desired it they really wanted it
[1:17:31] they were sincere well they went to get
[1:17:33] their oil
[1:17:35] the door was shut
[1:17:37] the door was closed
[1:17:39] and the word says they came back they
[1:17:41] must have found it somewhere
[1:17:42] they came back and when they came back
[1:17:45] they were knocking on the door they were
[1:17:47] now on the outside knocking on the door
[1:17:49] and what did he say hey I never even
[1:17:51] knew you and we know that the word says
[1:17:55] brother Branham said
[1:17:57] I'm sorry that uh those will go through
[1:17:59] the tribulation
[1:18:01] those unwise virgins will actually be
[1:18:03] the ones that go through their
[1:18:04] tribulation we don't put anybody in or
[1:18:07] or take anybody out that's not up to us
[1:18:09] to do it it's the word that does the
[1:18:11] dividing it's the word that does the
[1:18:13] Sorting it's Jesus Christ the same
[1:18:15] yesterday today and forever
[1:18:17] speaking about our our story this
[1:18:20] morning though
[1:18:21] Mary and Martha and and the story of
[1:18:24] Jesus
[1:18:27] we know that Jesus was living with them
[1:18:30] and
[1:18:32] what happened was because he wasn't just
[1:18:34] a man
[1:18:36] waiting for the anointing of a spirit to
[1:18:38] come to him
[1:18:39] to show him the things that must come he
[1:18:41] was God In the Flesh he knew what was
[1:18:43] going to happen and brother Branham says
[1:18:45] what Jesus did was he left town
[1:18:48] just before this was going to happen he
[1:18:49] said you know what I gotta go
[1:18:51] and he left them fully knowing that
[1:18:54] Lazarus was going to get sick he was
[1:18:56] going to contract maybe something some
[1:18:58] kind of a virus some kind of a plague he
[1:19:00] was going to get something that was
[1:19:01] going to put him in the grave Jesus knew
[1:19:03] that
[1:19:04] and and what did he do he left anyways
[1:19:06] took his disciples with them and we know
[1:19:08] that the disciples
[1:19:10] they they didn't understand what was
[1:19:12] going on they just were following Jesus
[1:19:14] again they were following the master he
[1:19:16] he's on a campaign he's got a another
[1:19:18] special service to have over here we're
[1:19:20] just going to go and support and and do
[1:19:21] everything we can to give him the
[1:19:23] encouragement that he needs to make sure
[1:19:25] that nobody gets in his way we're just
[1:19:27] gonna go and play along and see what
[1:19:28] will happen
[1:19:30] and we know that while he went
[1:19:32] Lazarus got sick his friend his bosom
[1:19:36] friend got sick and real sick to the
[1:19:39] point where he died
[1:19:40] and it's interesting there's so much in
[1:19:42] this story but I just want to stick to
[1:19:44] the part that brother Branham talks
[1:19:46] about and and that's out of verse 26
[1:19:47] believeth thou this do we do we believe
[1:19:50] that whoso that whoso liveth and
[1:19:53] believeth in me shall never die
[1:19:56] believeth thou this
[1:19:58] Jesus wasn't fussed at all
[1:20:01] he left town he took some disciples with
[1:20:04] him Lazarus got sick and when Lazarus
[1:20:06] got sick
[1:20:08] he died
[1:20:10] and they sent to Jesus and said you know
[1:20:12] your your best friend is sick he's
[1:20:14] really sick you need to come you need to
[1:20:16] come because we know if you come you
[1:20:18] could heal him you you could actually
[1:20:19] speak that sickness away and he'll be
[1:20:21] just fine and and nothing will be be
[1:20:24] wrong they knew that he was the master
[1:20:26] but what happened when they told Jesus I
[1:20:29] just think it's such an interesting
[1:20:31] thought what happened was he he didn't
[1:20:33] Flinch at all he just said yeah you know
[1:20:35] okay
[1:20:36] maybe we'll just pray about it
[1:20:39] and we'll just see what happens we're
[1:20:41] not going to get too fussed here we're
[1:20:43] not going to get too upset we're not
[1:20:44] going to get in a flap we're just going
[1:20:45] to see what happens here
[1:20:49] and what happened
[1:20:51] Jesus
[1:20:52] seemingly let him die
[1:20:54] just allowed his friend to die
[1:20:57] and and the people that day they they
[1:20:58] couldn't understand it they couldn't
[1:21:00] realize what on Earth was going through
[1:21:04] his friend's mind this was the master
[1:21:06] this was the Messiah in their mind but
[1:21:09] yet he he didn't have the care or
[1:21:11] concern to come and deal with his friend
[1:21:14] to prevent his friend from going into
[1:21:16] the grave how could this be how could he
[1:21:18] be the master how could he be the friend
[1:21:20] I'm sure they were questioning
[1:21:22] everything they thought they knew about
[1:21:25] this man Jesus at this point and we know
[1:21:28] that he was scorned heavy by the most
[1:21:30] religious people oh he he just let his
[1:21:32] friend die you know there's there's
[1:21:33] nothing good in him anyways we knew that
[1:21:36] he was from Nazareth and nothing good
[1:21:38] can come out of Nazareth
[1:21:40] you know
[1:21:41] talking about how this actually applies
[1:21:44] to us today this is really where we need
[1:21:47] to go with this and and it's what
[1:21:49] brother Branham does as well and I think
[1:21:50] it's just so beautiful the way that he
[1:21:51] does it and I just I just love taking
[1:21:53] the lesson from it but you know he says
[1:21:55] that the church still has power
[1:21:58] and many times in our lives it can seem
[1:22:00] like we don't and and how we need to
[1:22:04] recognize that we have to have the right
[1:22:07] kind of power we have said it before I'm
[1:22:09] sure everyone has heard it said before
[1:22:10] that power without character is satanic
[1:22:13] that's what brother Branham teaches and
[1:22:15] and the power that we're talking about
[1:22:16] is the power of the one with the eyes
[1:22:19] that is the as the flame of fire with
[1:22:21] the white wig on the one supreme deity
[1:22:24] the Lord Jesus Christ in eternity that's
[1:22:27] the power we're talking about we're not
[1:22:29] talking about having power on our own to
[1:22:31] be able to just wave our wand and and
[1:22:33] see the Holy Spirit move
[1:22:35] and and just call on the name of Jesus
[1:22:37] and then suddenly something magical is
[1:22:39] going to happen
[1:22:40] nope that's not the way it works we we
[1:22:43] have to live a consecrated life unto the
[1:22:45] Lord and trust him and trust that his
[1:22:48] judgment is correct every single time
[1:22:50] especially when he doesn't answer our
[1:22:53] prayers the way we think that he should
[1:22:56] but he says the church still has power
[1:22:58] and and he talks about that epileptic
[1:23:01] child that the disciples couldn't heal
[1:23:04] in this message believeth now this in
[1:23:07] 1960 the epileptic child you know Jesus
[1:23:10] he sent the disciples out two by two and
[1:23:12] he gave them power over over illness he
[1:23:15] gave him the power over Devils he gave
[1:23:17] him power and what happened was they
[1:23:20] encountered one one child with an
[1:23:23] epileptic spirit that they couldn't heal
[1:23:25] and and they brought that one to Jesus
[1:23:27] the man came and said look there's
[1:23:29] something wrong with the disciples
[1:23:31] experience here and the disciples were
[1:23:34] perplexed by it too and they even said
[1:23:35] Master why why is it that we could cast
[1:23:37] out every other devil we could race
[1:23:38] people from the dead but this one we
[1:23:40] couldn't do anything with why is that
[1:23:43] and he said because of your belief
[1:23:44] because of your unbelief because you
[1:23:48] still don't recognize Who You Are
[1:23:51] and and brother I'm talking here when
[1:23:53] that epileptic when it come up before
[1:23:56] the Lord Jesus the boy had the hardest
[1:23:58] fit he ever had perhaps fell on the
[1:24:01] ground like he was dead but he realized
[1:24:03] that he met someone who had Faith far
[1:24:07] above these apostles
[1:24:09] that Spirit recognized what was going to
[1:24:12] happen
[1:24:12] that Spirit knew what he was in for
[1:24:15] brother Adam says now I'd like for
[1:24:17] someone that didn't believe in Divine
[1:24:19] Healing to watch this Jesus had given
[1:24:21] them power to cast Spirits out and they
[1:24:23] had failed not the power had failed but
[1:24:27] they had failed Jesus told them why
[1:24:29] could we not cast him out because of
[1:24:31] your unbelief the church still has a
[1:24:34] power God has never taken his power from
[1:24:37] the church
[1:24:38] I think it's amazing to think about he
[1:24:40] gave the church power there and never
[1:24:42] took it back
[1:24:44] brother Branham says that you know the
[1:24:46] scholars in his day were saying you're
[1:24:48] trying to preach a an Apostolic message
[1:24:50] you're trying to to preach something
[1:24:53] that's that's Divine Healing that's just
[1:24:55] not right anymore and brother Branham
[1:24:57] says you know I can tell you where it
[1:24:58] started in the Bible and you show me
[1:25:00] where it ended in the Bible and then
[1:25:02] we'll have something to talk about and
[1:25:03] it's never ended brothers and sisters
[1:25:05] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:25:06] forever
[1:25:08] he said because of your unbelief the
[1:25:10] church still has power God has never
[1:25:11] taken his power from the church but the
[1:25:13] church don't have faith enough to act
[1:25:16] upon it that's all it's just that simple
[1:25:21] brothers and sisters I want to try and
[1:25:22] encourage us every time I come up here
[1:25:24] to remind us who we are that's the
[1:25:27] purpose of these gatherings to remember
[1:25:28] who we are to maybe learn who we are to
[1:25:31] discover who we are who we truly are
[1:25:33] we're not just this Flesh and Blood
[1:25:36] people that are living in our lives and
[1:25:38] have been raised by these parents and
[1:25:40] have done these different things in our
[1:25:42] lives you are the sinless Spotless
[1:25:43] virtuous bride of Jesus Christ that he
[1:25:45] took from himself from his side before
[1:25:48] the foundation of the world and
[1:25:50] positionally placed to be here today to
[1:25:53] be able to receive this word because he
[1:25:56] will always have a representation on
[1:25:58] Earth always
[1:26:00] until the time he doesn't
[1:26:02] it's coming a time where he will pull
[1:26:04] his representation
[1:26:06] and we know that when that happens when
[1:26:07] the bride goes up Satan's cast down but
[1:26:10] even in that time there's still people
[1:26:11] that will still believe
[1:26:14] they just wouldn't have had oil
[1:26:16] and it's going to be terrible there's
[1:26:18] people that will have to give their
[1:26:20] lives
[1:26:21] but they still will believe they won't
[1:26:23] accept the mark of the beast
[1:26:25] brother Adam says because of your
[1:26:27] unbelief is what Jesus said the church
[1:26:29] still has power God has never taken his
[1:26:30] power from the church but the church
[1:26:32] don't have faith enough to act upon it
[1:26:33] that's all it's just that simple
[1:26:36] I just love the way he says this
[1:26:38] brothers and sisters we try to make it
[1:26:40] so complicated sometimes but the more
[1:26:43] simple you make the gospel the more
[1:26:45] reality you will have
[1:26:48] when you just get real simple with it
[1:26:50] God said so that settles it and that's
[1:26:53] all and just believe it go ahead
[1:26:56] brothers and sisters believe us thou
[1:26:58] this
[1:26:59] when we hear words like this this isn't
[1:27:01] just a man this isn't just some man who
[1:27:04] is Prophet prophetic man speaking words
[1:27:07] this is God Almighty speaking through a
[1:27:10] man to try and tell us who we are to try
[1:27:12] and give us encouragement to come up a
[1:27:15] little higher we know the Book of
[1:27:16] Revelation chapter 4 John was shown an
[1:27:19] Open Door in heaven and he was given the
[1:27:21] invitation come up a little higher I
[1:27:23] can't help but think that that was that
[1:27:25] door in heaven wasn't just a door like
[1:27:27] we see with hinges on it maybe like at
[1:27:29] the back or up here with a push latch a
[1:27:31] panic bar maybe with an automatic door
[1:27:33] closer and a frame it wasn't just a door
[1:27:35] it was a cloud just like we saw above
[1:27:38] sunset Mountain there's a revelation for
[1:27:40] you John a type of the Bride just come a
[1:27:43] little higher and take a look at the
[1:27:45] things which must come to pass shortly
[1:27:48] Hereafter we tried to make it so
[1:27:51] complicated sometimes but the more
[1:27:52] simple you make the gospel the more
[1:27:54] reality you'll have when you just get
[1:27:57] real simple with it God said so that's
[1:27:59] battles it and that's all just go
[1:28:01] believe it go ahead he says and it's
[1:28:04] interesting because in Jesus day
[1:28:06] standing at the tomb of Lazarus the
[1:28:08] whole entire world was taking Jesus and
[1:28:10] just making him simple he was just
[1:28:12] simple how could he you know what are we
[1:28:13] doing here this this this man is coming
[1:28:15] to the tomb of Lazarus why didn't you
[1:28:17] come you're just simple but you know
[1:28:18] what the pendulum has swung the other
[1:28:20] way now we've got the Mysteries open and
[1:28:22] people have taken this gospel and made
[1:28:24] it so mysterious and complicated people
[1:28:26] can't even get to Christ
[1:28:28] brothers and sisters we still need the
[1:28:31] blood of Jesus Christ and I'd say this
[1:28:34] outside of the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:28:35] we'll never know what the mysteries of
[1:28:37] the message of the hour are we'll never
[1:28:39] understand what those unknown Thunders
[1:28:41] contained in the seals truly were for
[1:28:46] try to make it so complicated sometimes
[1:28:48] just need to keep it simple
[1:28:51] just allow the word to do the washing in
[1:28:53] our lives just say be it unto me
[1:28:55] according to Thy word Lord just allow
[1:28:57] that angel messenger just like Gabriel
[1:29:00] came to Mary and and created that
[1:29:03] Supernatural life inside of her that was
[1:29:06] neither the Egg of Mary or the seed of
[1:29:09] of her husband Joseph it wasn't part god
[1:29:12] part man it was all God
[1:29:15] if it wasn't all God brothers and
[1:29:17] sisters like we said we're lost we're
[1:29:19] lost as lost can be
[1:29:22] because man is corrupt
[1:29:25] and it goes back to the original sin in
[1:29:27] the garden and I don't know if we want
[1:29:29] to get into that today but brothers and
[1:29:30] sisters what really happened in the
[1:29:33] garden
[1:29:33] did eating fruit truly cause the full
[1:29:37] complete fall of mankind from the grace
[1:29:40] of God to be kicked out of the garden
[1:29:43] consuming a fruit
[1:29:45] I mean
[1:29:46] you can just
[1:29:48] you can just say it to anyone in the
[1:29:49] world what was the original sin what's
[1:29:52] Original Sin
[1:29:54] and you get a very similar answer from
[1:29:57] almost every single person you speak to
[1:30:00] it but we try to make it so complicated
[1:30:02] we try to make it some kind of a theory
[1:30:04] that we we we learn somewhere along the
[1:30:07] way but once we can see it it just
[1:30:10] becomes crystal clear and and we can't
[1:30:12] unsee it you can't get away from it
[1:30:15] brother Branham says if thou can'tst
[1:30:16] believe in this message
[1:30:19] believeth thou this
[1:30:21] when Jesus said no man Edith from thee
[1:30:26] why the leaves were just as pretty and
[1:30:28] bright as they ever was the bark looked
[1:30:30] the same but way down beneath the ground
[1:30:33] in those roots
[1:30:35] the life began to dwindle away
[1:30:37] you might be saying brother Barry you
[1:30:39] just jumped ahead of yourself and indeed
[1:30:40] I did and I'm glad you're with me it's
[1:30:43] interesting because we're talking about
[1:30:44] that fig tree that was right around the
[1:30:46] same time and Jesus was all man brother
[1:30:50] Branham says it here he was all man and
[1:30:52] he was hungry the word says that he
[1:30:54] hungered and he wanted a fig off that
[1:30:56] tree and that tree had no fruit remember
[1:30:59] we've heard it so many times I am the
[1:31:01] vine and ye are the branches
[1:31:03] and all the branches that don't have
[1:31:05] fruit what happens
[1:31:06] they get pruned they get pruned and they
[1:31:09] get tossed Into the Fire they're not
[1:31:11] good for anything but boy the branches
[1:31:13] that bear forth fruit they're the ones
[1:31:15] that get purged he pours his life from
[1:31:17] the vine into those branches and causes
[1:31:20] them to continually put forth fruit
[1:31:22] I say Lord help me to bear fruit unto
[1:31:26] you
[1:31:28] but here we have brother Brown I'm
[1:31:30] telling this story that Jesus passing by
[1:31:32] here he he he sees this tree and it
[1:31:34] doesn't have fruit and he's hungry and
[1:31:35] he's like you're no good to me you know
[1:31:36] I came by once the one time that I come
[1:31:39] past you you don't have anything for me
[1:31:41] you're no good there's nobody going to
[1:31:43] eat from you ever again brother Branham
[1:31:45] he says in this quote here no no man
[1:31:47] eateth from thee why the leaves were
[1:31:49] just as pretty and bright as they ever
[1:31:51] was even though he spoke the words
[1:31:53] everything looked normal on the outside
[1:31:55] didn't they
[1:31:57] the bark looked the same but way down
[1:31:59] beneath the ground in those roots
[1:32:01] the life began to dwindle away
[1:32:05] so it is upon a cancer
[1:32:07] upon any kind of disease that you might
[1:32:11] want to think
[1:32:12] when you can accept God's word way down
[1:32:16] deep in the roots the cancer may be
[1:32:18] there
[1:32:20] your hand may be just as stiff that
[1:32:23] don't have nothing to do with Divine
[1:32:25] Healing it's if thou can't believe see
[1:32:28] way down somewhere it's already gone to
[1:32:31] work
[1:32:32] and I think it's so fantastic for us to
[1:32:34] hear these words brothers and sisters
[1:32:36] because many times when we speak words
[1:32:38] under inspiration even when we speak
[1:32:41] words we don't see anything happen
[1:32:44] right we don't see any change at all
[1:32:47] I don't know if anybody has ever had a
[1:32:49] prayer or ever spoken under inspiration
[1:32:51] and and seen it come to pass exactly the
[1:32:54] way that you've said it
[1:32:56] but it doesn't happen necessarily
[1:32:57] instantly
[1:33:00] but have you ever experienced it
[1:33:01] brothers and sisters
[1:33:02] where you see it come to pass years
[1:33:05] later
[1:33:06] and you're like wow God brings it back
[1:33:08] to your memory and says remember those
[1:33:10] words that you said yes
[1:33:11] and Satan will say oh now you're just
[1:33:13] getting super spiritual you're getting a
[1:33:15] little bit outside of your realm he'll
[1:33:16] be right there to try and discount all
[1:33:18] of it brothers and sisters but don't
[1:33:20] discount it just remember we're living
[1:33:22] in the third poll age we're living under
[1:33:24] the anointing of the third Paul not the
[1:33:26] first poll or the second poll I would go
[1:33:28] so far as to say it that even when you
[1:33:30] think something he'll discern that
[1:33:33] thought and bring it to pass according
[1:33:35] to the way you thought it
[1:33:37] and the reason that happens brothers and
[1:33:39] sisters this is the beautiful part is
[1:33:40] because it's not even your thought it's
[1:33:42] him thinking through you you're thinking
[1:33:44] his thoughts because he said let the
[1:33:46] mind that was in Christ Jesus be also in
[1:33:49] you and when we're there brothers and
[1:33:51] sisters then we don't even have to say
[1:33:53] it but once in a while we just feel like
[1:33:55] it you know what I and my father are one
[1:33:57] and when we say those words every single
[1:33:59] cell in our body hears it every single
[1:34:01] devil in hell hears it every single
[1:34:04] person in heaven hears it and you can
[1:34:06] bet that in heaven they're cheering us
[1:34:08] on screaming amen keep pressing on don't
[1:34:11] give up this ain't no time to be given
[1:34:13] up this is a time to press hard brothers
[1:34:15] and sisters to keep saying it and the
[1:34:17] more you don't feel like it say it more
[1:34:21] say it more
[1:34:24] so it is upon a cancer upon any kind of
[1:34:27] a disease that you might want to think
[1:34:28] when you can accept God's word way down
[1:34:31] deep in the roots the cancer may be
[1:34:33] there
[1:34:35] I don't have anything to do with it
[1:34:37] there's nothing to do with it it's if
[1:34:39] you can believe
[1:34:41] if we can believe all things are
[1:34:43] possible
[1:34:45] Jesus said if you say to this mountain
[1:34:47] be moved and don't doubt in your heart
[1:34:48] but believe that what you said will come
[1:34:51] to pass
[1:34:53] you can have what you've said amen
[1:34:56] amen you know the Book of James says
[1:34:58] that many times
[1:35:00] we ask but we ask a miss
[1:35:03] and why do we ask amiss
[1:35:05] because we're asking to consume it upon
[1:35:07] the lusts of our flesh
[1:35:09] maybe I'm hungry maybe I've got bills
[1:35:12] maybe I've got a desire for something
[1:35:14] else it'd be sure nice to see something
[1:35:16] else but you know what Hattie Wright was
[1:35:18] faced with that too wasn't she
[1:35:21] she said you know what
[1:35:22] I have one desire in my heart and she
[1:35:25] had to explore it it took a few minutes
[1:35:27] and we know that God speaking through
[1:35:29] the prophet he said ask what you want
[1:35:32] and you got it
[1:35:33] and he even said do you want a million
[1:35:35] dollars she was broke she was poor
[1:35:39] your sister we've prayed for her many
[1:35:41] times in the wheelchair and she's never
[1:35:43] been healed do you say the word right
[1:35:44] now and she'll be healed she'll get out
[1:35:46] of that wheelchair thus saith the Lord
[1:35:48] had he right
[1:35:51] but she said you know what there's only
[1:35:52] one thing of Eternal value and this is
[1:35:54] where brothers and sisters this wasn't
[1:35:56] had he writes speaking I have to say
[1:35:58] this was the Lord Jesus Christ the one
[1:36:00] with the eyes is the flame of fire the
[1:36:02] white hair the white wigged one was
[1:36:04] there with her in that room saying ask
[1:36:06] what you want it wasn't a man saying ask
[1:36:09] what you want it wasn't just a separate
[1:36:11] Spirit saying ask what you want it
[1:36:13] wasn't the father saying what you want
[1:36:15] it wasn't just the son saying what you
[1:36:17] want it was God himself saying ask what
[1:36:20] you want thus saith the Lord through the
[1:36:22] prophets
[1:36:23] and she said there's only one thing
[1:36:25] that's of Eternal value it was the word
[1:36:27] to the word again just like out of it is
[1:36:30] the rising of the Sun that word that was
[1:36:32] inside of her that seed Gene of God Said
[1:36:35] Amen to the word when it came from the
[1:36:37] prophet thus saith the Lord ask what you
[1:36:39] want you want a million bucks you got it
[1:36:40] she knew the million bucks would
[1:36:42] probably corrupt or no I don't want that
[1:36:43] I want to see the life of my sons I want
[1:36:46] them to be there with me under that tree
[1:36:49] in heaven eating of the fruit of the
[1:36:51] Vine with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:36:54] Jesus said if you say to this mountain
[1:36:57] be moved and don't doubt in your heart
[1:36:59] but believe that what you said will come
[1:37:01] to pass you can have what you said
[1:37:04] he says isn't that lovely
[1:37:06] oh my
[1:37:08] who who'd that come from he says
[1:37:11] would that come from
[1:37:12] the Son of God whose words Heaven and
[1:37:15] Earth will pass away oh but his words
[1:37:18] won't
[1:37:19] think about that brothers and sisters
[1:37:21] heavens and earth will pass away
[1:37:22] everything that we see tangible in our
[1:37:25] lives right now will pass away we we we
[1:37:28] don't even won't even see our sons and
[1:37:30] our daughters and our brothers and our
[1:37:32] sisters and our husbands and our wives
[1:37:33] you can't see the real each other the
[1:37:37] only thing that's going to make it is
[1:37:38] his word his word in US is the only
[1:37:41] thing that's going to make it
[1:37:44] the random says now the only way that
[1:37:46] you can do that you've got to have the
[1:37:48] right objective and the right motive
[1:37:51] and how can you do that if you don't
[1:37:53] have the mind of Christ in you
[1:37:55] can you do that if we don't have the
[1:37:57] right right right person living inside
[1:37:59] of us how can that ever happen now the
[1:38:02] only way that you can do that you got to
[1:38:03] have the right motive and objective now
[1:38:06] if I went out here and said I'll show
[1:38:07] you I can move this mountain be moved
[1:38:10] Mountain
[1:38:11] it would never move certainly not no
[1:38:13] matter what I had if it's got to be
[1:38:15] first you got to find the will of God
[1:38:20] I just think it's a beautiful thing
[1:38:23] amazing to think that if you say to this
[1:38:26] mountain
[1:38:27] be thou removed
[1:38:29] and don't doubt that you'll have it
[1:38:32] you'll have it in your in your life
[1:38:34] you'll see it
[1:38:39] what happens in our lives though
[1:38:41] brothers and sisters as we encounter
[1:38:42] problems
[1:38:45] will go from a tremendous service and
[1:38:47] and maybe a tremendous sign and wonder
[1:38:49] in our lives to a great trial
[1:38:52] and and will wonder just like those with
[1:38:56] with Mary and Martha didn't didn't he
[1:38:58] get the memo didn't he hear that we
[1:39:01] actually prayed in that prayer meeting
[1:39:03] that he would come and heal his best
[1:39:05] friend Lazarus he didn't hear those
[1:39:07] words I thought he was the master I
[1:39:09] thought he was the Messiah the devil
[1:39:10] will come around and say was he was he
[1:39:12] truly
[1:39:13] and we'll start wondering boy I don't
[1:39:16] know remember brother Branham said when
[1:39:18] his wife and his daughter died what was
[1:39:20] the words that came to him Satan came
[1:39:21] and said you can heal all these other
[1:39:22] people look at your great campaign but
[1:39:24] you can't save your wife or your
[1:39:25] daughter oh my that's the god you serve
[1:39:28] eh that's the one you worship
[1:39:30] and we know that he had to be exactly
[1:39:33] like Jesus get thee behind me Satan
[1:39:34] you're an offense to me Thou shalt not
[1:39:37] tempt the Lord thy God
[1:39:41] but brother Branham in this message says
[1:39:43] that he tries his church he says God I
[1:39:45] believe today before he puts his church
[1:39:48] in power
[1:39:49] he tries his church to see what it'll do
[1:39:53] he puts us through trials brothers and
[1:39:54] sisters he puts us through tribulations
[1:39:57] he gives us problems and circumstances
[1:40:01] and what happens is it expresses who we
[1:40:04] are because you know when we come to
[1:40:05] church this is something we've talked
[1:40:07] about with the young people when we come
[1:40:08] to church we're polished we put on our
[1:40:11] best and and our cars are clean usually
[1:40:13] and and maybe we smell good and and
[1:40:16] we've got everything is in order there's
[1:40:18] no issues in our lives right everything
[1:40:20] is fine we shake hands and say God bless
[1:40:21] you that was a great service and we go
[1:40:23] home
[1:40:24] without recognizing that each one of us
[1:40:27] have major problems
[1:40:29] each one of us have major trials in our
[1:40:31] lives
[1:40:32] each one of us are continually being
[1:40:35] tried and what that's doing is
[1:40:37] expressing who we are it's easy to
[1:40:39] express a good happy Christian in the
[1:40:41] monks of Believers especially when we're
[1:40:43] under the anointing of the word
[1:40:45] it's it's pretty easy when we go home to
[1:40:48] do that as well
[1:40:49] but you know brothers and sisters when
[1:40:51] the pressure comes in our lives
[1:40:53] that shows Who We Are
[1:40:55] [Music]
[1:40:57] this doesn't show Who We Are
[1:40:59] when the pressure comes in our lives
[1:41:01] when we get really angry when when we
[1:41:03] get really sad when we get really
[1:41:05] frightened all of the different ranges
[1:41:07] of emotions that happen in our life that
[1:41:09] expresses Who We Are
[1:41:12] I say Lord help me I'm not exempt from
[1:41:15] this trial I get trials
[1:41:17] but I just think it's beautiful to
[1:41:19] recognize that God has never taken away
[1:41:21] his power but before he actually gives
[1:41:23] us the ability to recognize the power in
[1:41:25] our own lives he tries us
[1:41:28] so when we look around and we see
[1:41:30] everyone highly polished and everything
[1:41:31] is great in their lives brothers and
[1:41:33] sisters young people old people whoever
[1:41:35] people it's because we're going through
[1:41:37] trials it's because we're we're we're
[1:41:39] we're we're we're scarred people we've
[1:41:42] actually fought some battles and we
[1:41:44] recognize the the more that we surrender
[1:41:46] the more he takes control and the more
[1:41:49] he takes control the more success we're
[1:41:51] going to have in our lives
[1:41:54] but as long as we're doing it on our own
[1:41:56] boy oh boy we get in the way
[1:42:00] now let's get into our story
[1:42:03] Mary and Martha
[1:42:07] brother Adam says Jesus had a great
[1:42:08] Fellowship especially with Lazarus when
[1:42:10] we read into the book that where he did
[1:42:13] come to their home and Martha was a
[1:42:15] little dilatory about listening to his
[1:42:17] words but she had to get the dinner
[1:42:18] ready and set the table but Mary set at
[1:42:21] his feet and Jesus said that Mary had
[1:42:24] chosen the better things we know in that
[1:42:26] story there that Martha got upset and
[1:42:28] said why am I the one that's always
[1:42:29] laboring why am I the one that's always
[1:42:31] doing the work around here why isn't she
[1:42:33] helping why is it me
[1:42:35] we know that Jesus he said to her you
[1:42:38] know what she chooses right the food is
[1:42:41] temporal the food our hunger is temporal
[1:42:43] all the cares of this life they're
[1:42:44] temporal why don't we just sit down and
[1:42:46] reason around the word and just allow
[1:42:48] the word to wash us
[1:42:50] so we know that we talked about this but
[1:42:52] just you know brother Branham in this
[1:42:54] message he says so to make this this
[1:42:56] really the right story The Father God
[1:42:58] must have spoken to his son Jesus and
[1:43:01] said your friend Lazarus is going to die
[1:43:04] but it's going to be for the good
[1:43:07] so you leave the home go away because
[1:43:10] it'll be asked of you to pray for him or
[1:43:12] make him well and I don't want you to do
[1:43:15] that
[1:43:16] if you'll watch the story as we go along
[1:43:18] you'll see it heaps up to that very
[1:43:20] truth of that so Jesus without any
[1:43:22] warning or anything walked away from the
[1:43:24] house and went somewhere else didn't
[1:43:26] return that night and he went to some
[1:43:28] other cities and as soon as Jesus left
[1:43:30] the home
[1:43:31] then trouble set in
[1:43:34] you know brothers and sisters last week
[1:43:35] we talked about welcoming Jesus into our
[1:43:38] midst and and welcoming here knowing
[1:43:40] that he's here but then when he's here
[1:43:43] and he wants to speak to our heart when
[1:43:45] he wants to
[1:43:46] Express himself to us in our lives maybe
[1:43:49] when he wants to express worship through
[1:43:51] our lives maybe when he wants to do
[1:43:53] something for us in the midst of his
[1:43:56] welcome and we reject it
[1:43:58] then we're not accepting him we're not
[1:44:01] welcoming him we're actually what
[1:44:03] happens is we wind up making a mockery
[1:44:05] of him is what we talked about last week
[1:44:06] I don't want to go too far with that but
[1:44:08] you know here we have Jesus now he
[1:44:11] leaves the situation and brother Bradham
[1:44:13] says in this story that as soon as Jesus
[1:44:15] leaves the home then the trouble sets in
[1:44:17] but then he goes on to explain it a
[1:44:19] little further and I think it's so
[1:44:21] beautiful because it's it's vital for us
[1:44:23] in our day brothers and sisters we have
[1:44:25] to see how we can connect the dots how
[1:44:27] does this apply to us today how does it
[1:44:29] change my life today brother Barry well
[1:44:31] this is how it is he says and when Jesus
[1:44:33] leaves your home
[1:44:34] trouble is on its Road
[1:44:37] just remember when he leaves your home
[1:44:39] Trouble Is On The Way
[1:44:41] when you get social societies and
[1:44:43] everything operating in your church so
[1:44:46] perfectly like some great big 16
[1:44:48] cylinder Rickenbacker and you leave
[1:44:51] Jesus out of it when Jesus goes from
[1:44:54] your church troubles on the road
[1:44:57] and I just think that's such a beautiful
[1:44:59] thought because we can do that brothers
[1:45:01] and sisters we can get such a tight grip
[1:45:03] of control on our house on our family on
[1:45:07] everything that we do we've got such
[1:45:09] control we don't give the Lord Jesus
[1:45:12] Christ the room that he wants to move in
[1:45:14] our lives to move in our homes to move
[1:45:17] in our families
[1:45:19] of course we have to be diligent with
[1:45:21] our lives and our families
[1:45:23] but we have to put him first
[1:45:26] if we put him first
[1:45:28] then he doesn't leave but if we get so
[1:45:30] busy trying to manage everything and
[1:45:32] then we just find a little space for him
[1:45:33] at the back we wind up doing exactly
[1:45:35] what the the Pharisee did we'll find
[1:45:37] Jesus over in the corner we welcomed him
[1:45:39] to our house but we're just going to set
[1:45:40] him over there because we're so busy
[1:45:41] with everything else over here
[1:45:43] speaking from experience if we do that
[1:45:45] brothers and sisters troubles on the
[1:45:47] road it's coming
[1:45:48] and we can do the same thing in the
[1:45:50] church we can operate our church like a
[1:45:52] fine fine running machine like a 16
[1:45:55] sealer reckon boxer engine brother
[1:45:57] Bradham says we can get it so fine-tuned
[1:45:59] everything in Balance everybody knows
[1:46:01] their position everyone's got a uh uh uh
[1:46:04] direct list of everything that needs to
[1:46:05] happen we can operate the church exactly
[1:46:07] the way we operate a business and what
[1:46:09] happens we push Jesus out
[1:46:12] there's no room for dynamic power to
[1:46:14] happen and that's when trouble's on the
[1:46:16] road
[1:46:18] he says yes sir when Jesus leaves a
[1:46:20] denomination
[1:46:22] that they lay him aside and say well now
[1:46:24] we just don't believe that these things
[1:46:27] could be just exactly right and you
[1:46:29] adopt something else troubles on its
[1:46:32] Road just remember that and you know we
[1:46:34] said it earlier that just like that fig
[1:46:37] tree
[1:46:38] the word was spoken but the leaves they
[1:46:40] look just fine
[1:46:42] the bark looked the same
[1:46:44] nothing changed
[1:46:46] and that's how it is that's how subtle
[1:46:48] it is when things change in our lives
[1:46:51] it's a subtle thing it's not necessarily
[1:46:52] A cataclysmic impact but you know what
[1:46:56] that word will always take effect
[1:46:58] according to the word of God
[1:47:00] and if we just give Jesus second place
[1:47:03] if we just give him a back seat and say
[1:47:05] that I've got all these other things
[1:47:06] that I want to do all these other things
[1:47:08] that I want to look at and I know they
[1:47:10] could be questionable you know what Paul
[1:47:12] said to the church he said that all
[1:47:13] things are lawful but not expedient
[1:47:17] and you know we can look at it and say
[1:47:19] hey if you really want to get
[1:47:21] um
[1:47:22] literal about it we could say that pot's
[1:47:24] legal now
[1:47:26] that came through in our day I remember
[1:47:28] as a delinquent
[1:47:31] that pot was contraband
[1:47:33] but it was something that people did
[1:47:35] they they did everything they could to
[1:47:37] keep it undercover to not get busted
[1:47:39] with with pot with with marijuana
[1:47:43] but now in my lifetime I saw it go from
[1:47:45] being Contraband where people would be
[1:47:47] charged and thrown in prison for it and
[1:47:50] find heavily really judged for it now
[1:47:53] it's just fine it's legal go ahead you
[1:47:55] can get some
[1:47:56] in other people's lives they would have
[1:47:58] witnessed that with alcohol
[1:48:00] there was not there was a time where
[1:48:01] alcohol was prohibited prohibition you
[1:48:05] couldn't have alcohol and it was always
[1:48:07] underground and secretive but yet there
[1:48:10] was always seemed to always be some of
[1:48:12] the influence around
[1:48:14] but you know because it's legal it
[1:48:15] doesn't mean there's something that
[1:48:16] we're going to go out and do is it
[1:48:18] just because we can do that all the
[1:48:21] different drugs they're talking about
[1:48:22] implementing and saying that they're
[1:48:24] going to be legal think about this world
[1:48:25] and how it's falling apart it's amazing
[1:48:28] to look at I just shake my head and and
[1:48:30] say wow even so come Lord Jesus
[1:48:35] but as soon as we want to try and and
[1:48:37] and make it all our way that's when
[1:48:41] Trouble Comes
[1:48:43] whether Brad I'm a church age book he
[1:48:44] says that uh you know sometimes we'll
[1:48:47] have a a great experience and and a
[1:48:50] tremendous outpouring of the spirit and
[1:48:53] and that's where we'll say quick we need
[1:48:55] to gather around it now and we need to
[1:48:57] protect it and as soon as we do that
[1:48:59] that's where we put a period behind the
[1:49:01] word and the spirit leaves
[1:49:02] but we'll still have great services and
[1:49:05] signs and wonders remember brother
[1:49:06] Bradham he says he gets asked the
[1:49:08] question what will they preach after the
[1:49:09] Rapture
[1:49:11] what will they preach after the Rapture
[1:49:12] and he says they'll preach the same
[1:49:14] thing
[1:49:15] they'll go on baptizing
[1:49:18] they'll go on screaming shouting
[1:49:20] maybe even speaking in tongues
[1:49:24] but they won't have the spirit
[1:49:27] we don't want to actually see the spirit
[1:49:30] leave us we don't want to see Jesus
[1:49:32] leave because as soon as Jesus leaves
[1:49:34] that's when trouble sets in and that's
[1:49:36] what the story is here Jesus left he
[1:49:38] understood the instruction he never did
[1:49:40] anything unless the father first showed
[1:49:41] him we know that and the father was God
[1:49:44] and and the father showed him hey you
[1:49:46] know what you're going to have to leave
[1:49:47] because I'm going to express myself
[1:49:49] through you in this situation but how
[1:49:51] did he do it first a man had to die
[1:49:54] isn't it amazing to think about there's
[1:49:56] nothing too great or too bad for God in
[1:49:59] this world there's nothing too tragic
[1:50:01] there's nothing too shocking or alarming
[1:50:05] for him nothing surprises him is what my
[1:50:07] dad has said so many times there's
[1:50:08] nothing that surprises God and you know
[1:50:11] brothers and sisters that's such an
[1:50:12] amazing thought to take and maybe put in
[1:50:14] our pocket and just say you know when we
[1:50:16] fall down tomorrow when we trip up and
[1:50:18] make a mistake next week when there's
[1:50:20] something that happens in our lives
[1:50:21] we're going to surprise ourselves so
[1:50:24] many times I've shocked myself to think
[1:50:26] that that's exactly how I was
[1:50:29] but yet didn't surprise God
[1:50:32] doesn't surprise the Lord
[1:50:35] he knew what was going to happen here
[1:50:39] but the random talks about how Jesus
[1:50:41] when he left how his parents one time
[1:50:44] they left they left Jerusalem and they
[1:50:46] were on their way they had all the kin
[1:50:47] folk and everyone with them and they
[1:50:49] were sure that Jesus was with them but
[1:50:51] they just took it for granted they
[1:50:53] didn't go and check
[1:50:54] that Jesus was with them and what
[1:50:57] happened because of that they were
[1:50:58] actually a total I would say of about
[1:51:01] nine days behind schedule
[1:51:03] because they went out three days
[1:51:05] then they had to go back three days and
[1:51:08] just to get back to where they were it
[1:51:09] was another three days
[1:51:11] how far back does it put us when we
[1:51:13] leave Jesus behind brothers and sisters
[1:51:16] God's program will always come to pass
[1:51:18] in our lives but we can put ourselves
[1:51:19] quite a ways behind if we're not
[1:51:21] diligently checking to make sure that
[1:51:23] Jesus is with us Jesus has got to be
[1:51:27] with us
[1:51:28] we can't take it for granted that he is
[1:51:30] with us brothers and sisters we need to
[1:51:32] ensure that he is with us every single
[1:51:35] day checking that he is with us and I
[1:51:38] just can't help but think you know as
[1:51:40] Paul said I just die out daily I just
[1:51:42] check and make sure that Jesus is with
[1:51:44] us I check and make sure that I'm dying
[1:51:46] so that he's living I must decrease so
[1:51:50] that he can increase every single day
[1:51:52] we've got to take inventory and make
[1:51:54] sure as soon as we don't do it brothers
[1:51:56] and sisters we set ourselves back
[1:51:57] spiritually
[1:52:00] but how do we get back to him brother
[1:52:01] Adam says we can't do it through
[1:52:02] denominations we can't do it under
[1:52:04] psychology
[1:52:06] we can't do it under arithmetic
[1:52:08] or we can't do it with education
[1:52:11] we separate ourselves divide ourselves
[1:52:14] we're not divided
[1:52:15] We Are One
[1:52:18] person indeed in Christ Jesus we are all
[1:52:21] one in Christ and our denominations will
[1:52:24] never do it as good as they are they
[1:52:26] won't do it our education is the
[1:52:29] greatest hindrance the gospel has ever
[1:52:31] had is education
[1:52:34] what we need is not education
[1:52:37] we need the power and demonstration of
[1:52:39] the Holy Ghost back in the church to
[1:52:42] demonstrate the power
[1:52:45] and I'm not saying this
[1:52:47] I I this is Barry speaking I'm not
[1:52:49] saying this to say that we need to speak
[1:52:50] in tongues we need to see Mighty signs
[1:52:53] and wonders in our midst brothers and
[1:52:54] sisters all of that will happen don't be
[1:52:56] alarmed if you see someone speak in
[1:52:58] tongues don't be alarmed if you see
[1:53:00] someone dance in the spirit don't be
[1:53:01] alarmed if you see someone start
[1:53:03] shouting or running when the Holy Spirit
[1:53:05] strikes a person when Jesus manifests in
[1:53:08] a human being you cannot stand still
[1:53:10] brother Branham says it you set a man on
[1:53:12] fire and see what happens to him in the
[1:53:15] in the upper room experience when they
[1:53:17] came out of the upper room they were
[1:53:19] acting around like they were drunk
[1:53:21] brothers and sisters how could we come
[1:53:23] to a service have the Holy Spirit strike
[1:53:25] us and just be quiet
[1:53:28] make any noise got to be quiet because
[1:53:30] we might upset Jesus if that's what's
[1:53:33] going on brothers and sisters I don't
[1:53:35] know if we have the right Jesus
[1:53:37] remember brother Adam says it too
[1:53:38] there's a lot of Jesus in the world even
[1:53:41] today there's a lot of Jesus in the
[1:53:43] world but there's only one Lord Jesus
[1:53:45] only one Lord Jesus and when he comes on
[1:53:48] the scene things change
[1:53:51] what we need
[1:53:52] we need the power and demonstration of
[1:53:54] the Holy Ghost back in the church to
[1:53:56] demonstrate the power Jesus never said
[1:53:57] go into all the world and teach
[1:54:00] he never said go into all the world and
[1:54:03] do he said go into all the world and
[1:54:05] preach the gospel
[1:54:07] and the gospel is to demonstrate the
[1:54:11] power of the Holy Ghost the resurrection
[1:54:14] I think that's such a beautiful thought
[1:54:16] because he doesn't say it's quotes he
[1:54:18] didn't say it's understanding all the
[1:54:20] scripture he didn't say it's a
[1:54:22] conception mentally it's not an
[1:54:24] understanding that we have through
[1:54:25] theological study it's not about that at
[1:54:28] all it's the demonstration of the power
[1:54:31] of the Holy Ghost living out through our
[1:54:32] lives where your friends and family meet
[1:54:34] you and say who are you and what have
[1:54:36] you done with my brother or sister
[1:54:37] because the way you're acting is crazy
[1:54:44] he says we're still a million miles
[1:54:46] short than where we should be let us
[1:54:49] move forward let's get back to where we
[1:54:51] left him at the Feast of Pentecost wow
[1:54:53] that's a long ways back and I know
[1:54:55] brothers and sisters I would say this
[1:54:57] today we're not that far
[1:54:59] it's not that far here he was in 1960
[1:55:02] crying out to the denominations but I
[1:55:04] would say here he is in 2013 crying out
[1:55:06] to his bride just get back to the word
[1:55:08] just let the word be your solid Focus
[1:55:11] just make sure that you take inventory
[1:55:13] every single day and that you've got me
[1:55:14] with you if you've got Jesus in your
[1:55:17] boat brothers and sisters it don't
[1:55:18] matter what kind of storm comes your way
[1:55:20] and remember that if you are a son and
[1:55:22] daughter of God he's got storms coming
[1:55:24] your way there's storms coming for us
[1:55:27] but they're not going to be able to
[1:55:28] drown us even though there will be a
[1:55:30] thousand hundred thousand devils in that
[1:55:31] water trying to flip the waves up on our
[1:55:33] boat we can be asleep resting peacefully
[1:55:36] in the back because we know who's in our
[1:55:37] boat
[1:55:40] John chapter 15 brother Brown talks
[1:55:42] about it in this message
[1:55:43] I am the vine and ye are the branches
[1:55:45] and he says that some are grafted in but
[1:55:47] if the vine ever puts forth another
[1:55:49] Branch we know the story if the vine
[1:55:51] ever puts forth another Branch they'll
[1:55:53] write a book of Acts behind it brothers
[1:55:54] and sisters and that's what we're
[1:55:56] talking about this morning the book of
[1:55:57] Acts that's that's really it's not the
[1:56:00] acts of of the Apostles which is what so
[1:56:04] many people will say it's the act of the
[1:56:05] Holy Ghost in the apostles and that's
[1:56:07] how they were preaching the gospel it
[1:56:09] was the acts of the Holy Ghost in in the
[1:56:12] apostles
[1:56:14] but if that vine ever puts forth another
[1:56:16] branch
[1:56:17] just go and preach it through the
[1:56:19] demonstration of your lives and then
[1:56:20] every once in a while you'll have to
[1:56:21] speak people will say what is it about
[1:56:23] you man you're so different you're
[1:56:25] you're I always just feel good when I'm
[1:56:28] around you something energizes when you
[1:56:31] come into the room you'll have people
[1:56:33] apologizing for swearing around you
[1:56:35] they'll just say oh I'm sorry and you'll
[1:56:37] scratch your head and say why'd you say
[1:56:39] that where did that come from how did
[1:56:41] why would you even apologize I never
[1:56:43] said anything to you it's because the
[1:56:45] spirit that's in them recognizes the
[1:56:47] spirit that's in you amen it's the life
[1:56:49] that we live brothers and sisters it's
[1:56:51] the essence of Who We Are
[1:56:54] I just love how brother Bradham says
[1:56:55] this in this message here and I just
[1:56:57] wish that I could shout it but I'm not
[1:56:59] gonna I'm just gonna say it and and he
[1:57:02] says we don't need a new denomination we
[1:57:04] don't need a new church building
[1:57:06] I love that we don't need a new church
[1:57:08] building brothers and sisters I want to
[1:57:10] say this we don't need a new church
[1:57:11] building even though maybe we're
[1:57:13] bursting at the seams let's burst at the
[1:57:14] seams let's let's blow the lid off of
[1:57:16] this place we don't need a new church
[1:57:18] building we don't need a new
[1:57:19] denomination what we need today is an
[1:57:21] old-time Backwoods sky blue sin killing
[1:57:25] Pentecostal Revival
[1:57:27] that was born at Pentecost and is back
[1:57:29] in the church again the power of the
[1:57:32] Holy Ghost to bring Jesus on the scene
[1:57:34] you know not not not a a a a quiet
[1:57:38] Canadian I'm Canadian I need to be quiet
[1:57:41] I have a Canadian culture about me and
[1:57:44] and I just can't do it you know what
[1:57:46] there's no culture in the Holy Ghost
[1:57:48] we don't want to say we got an African
[1:57:50] culture we don't have a Philippine
[1:57:52] culture we've got the culture of the
[1:57:54] Holy Ghost living in our lives and when
[1:57:56] he comes on the scene we act the same
[1:57:59] I don't know maybe I'm wrong about this
[1:58:01] I was thinking about it a while ago
[1:58:02] brothers and sisters but personally I
[1:58:04] don't think there's going to be skin
[1:58:05] color on the other side we're all going
[1:58:08] to be brothers and sisters of like
[1:58:09] Precious faith not that we're not right
[1:58:12] now but we don't have to worry about
[1:58:14] cultures if we've got cultures mixing in
[1:58:17] with what we do in church we're missing
[1:58:19] the point brothers and sisters we've got
[1:58:21] a hybrid religion and we better bury it
[1:58:24] brother Branham said if it's got no life
[1:58:26] in it because the spirit has life
[1:58:31] brother Branham says we need today we
[1:58:34] need to see a backwoods sky blue sin
[1:58:37] killing Pentecostal Revival I want to
[1:58:39] say this as I read this quote as I read
[1:58:42] this quote the inspiration behind this
[1:58:44] quote for me brothers and sisters was on
[1:58:46] a day like no other day that I've ever
[1:58:49] experienced in my life I I went out with
[1:58:51] our pastor and we went for a day where
[1:58:54] we were just gonna have a day of of of
[1:58:56] playing around with quad motorbikes and
[1:58:59] what happened was my pastor died that
[1:59:01] day I watched him die and and you might
[1:59:05] say you're crazy oh you know it couldn't
[1:59:07] have been that bad because he lived well
[1:59:09] you weren't there you didn't see it I
[1:59:11] saw it with my own two eyes I bear
[1:59:13] witness record of it and what happened
[1:59:16] brothers and sisters in that moment was
[1:59:18] I just went down to my knees and what
[1:59:20] did I do I I said to brother Wayne who
[1:59:22] was there I said we need to pray right
[1:59:23] now we both said at the same time and he
[1:59:26] reached over and he leaned and he just
[1:59:29] touched brother Ken and and I just went
[1:59:31] to my knees and I just looked up and I
[1:59:33] saw a blue sky The Bluest sky that I've
[1:59:35] ever seen and you know what we prayed
[1:59:38] Lord your servant needs a touch and not
[1:59:41] a brother Wayne's mouth your servant two
[1:59:44] words into it boom the power of God
[1:59:46] strikes the man and he jumps to his feet
[1:59:48] and we say no you've got to sit down
[1:59:51] just relax
[1:59:53] and brothers and sisters that's the acts
[1:59:56] of the Holy Ghost living out through the
[1:59:58] church and you know what I would say I
[2:00:00] don't think it was me I don't I can't
[2:00:02] say it was me I I would have to say it's
[2:00:04] all brother Wayne because he's been
[2:00:06] serving God longer and and he's probably
[2:00:08] a better Christian than me and he can
[2:00:10] preach better than me and he knows more
[2:00:11] quotes than me and he's probably got a
[2:00:13] better relationship with Jesus than me
[2:00:15] but you know what the word of God says
[2:00:16] he's the son of God just like you're a
[2:00:18] Son of God there's no difference if you
[2:00:21] believe you say to this mountain be thou
[2:00:25] removed and cast into the sea
[2:00:28] it's not what some other person says if
[2:00:31] we make it that way then there's no hope
[2:00:33] for us brothers and sisters
[2:00:35] that's where we get denominational
[2:00:39] I don't say that to put myself anywhere
[2:00:41] other than hey you know what when we
[2:00:44] need to see the power of God in our
[2:00:45] lives we're going to see the power of
[2:00:47] God in our lives if you can believe us
[2:00:49] now this
[2:00:52] we're not talking about cunningly
[2:00:54] devised fables as brother Emmanuel
[2:00:56] mentioned when he preached on Wednesday
[2:00:57] this isn't a story of of of Santa Claus
[2:01:01] of someone that's like an Easter Bunny
[2:01:03] we're gonna hand out chocolates this is
[2:01:06] the power and resurrection of God
[2:01:08] Almighty living out through his church
[2:01:10] we don't need another denomination we
[2:01:13] don't need a new church building what we
[2:01:15] need today is an old-time backwards sky
[2:01:17] blue sin killing Pentecostal Revival and
[2:01:21] I'll tell you brothers and sisters
[2:01:22] that's my heart's desire for the Easter
[2:01:25] meetings here in Calgary Living Word is
[2:01:28] to see the Holy Ghost move in our church
[2:01:30] we don't want to stay in the same
[2:01:32] position that we were maybe some people
[2:01:34] wish that we would just be back where we
[2:01:36] were but that's not the way it works he
[2:01:39] wants us to grow he wants us to move
[2:01:40] we're marching on to Zion
[2:01:44] we're not standing still if we're
[2:01:47] standing still we're gonna get left
[2:01:48] behind
[2:01:52] and today brothers and sisters I'd say
[2:01:54] this he's raising people up man oh my
[2:01:57] and we find out brother Branham says
[2:01:59] when Jesus left death set in when Jesus
[2:02:02] leaves our church the power of the Holy
[2:02:05] Spirit leaves our church
[2:02:07] it begins to dwindle and die and after a
[2:02:10] while there's nothing more to it now
[2:02:12] when Jesus left death set in Oh What a
[2:02:15] Sad time it was and notice they wandered
[2:02:18] a boat and they sent for Jesus and he
[2:02:20] didn't come they sent for him again and
[2:02:22] he didn't come but he knowed that it was
[2:02:24] his going to do he know what he was
[2:02:26] going to do he knows tonight what he's
[2:02:28] going to do he's not lost with him he
[2:02:31] knows exactly what he's fixing to do and
[2:02:34] I would say this brothers and sisters he
[2:02:36] knows exactly what he's fixing to do
[2:02:38] right now in this service if you can
[2:02:41] believe us now this
[2:02:43] he's going to raise a people up just as
[2:02:46] certain as I'm standing in this Pulpit
[2:02:48] right here I'll say it just as certain
[2:02:50] as I'm standing in this puppet he will
[2:02:52] raise people for his namesake out of the
[2:02:55] Gentile generation he will do it
[2:02:58] he has to do it there has to be people
[2:03:01] to represent him here on Earth there has
[2:03:04] to be people that will go in a general
[2:03:07] Resurrection
[2:03:09] and a rapture there has to be people
[2:03:12] that will bear his name
[2:03:17] brother Adam he goes on to say now I can
[2:03:18] imagine that the little home was really
[2:03:20] broken up this is the home of Mary and
[2:03:23] Martha and
[2:03:24] Lazarus it was really broken up the
[2:03:27] breadwinner gone sadness
[2:03:28] oh it's wonderful when you got a sad
[2:03:30] home or a sad heart
[2:03:32] and then Jesus appears all at once isn't
[2:03:35] it
[2:03:36] Oh my he says I can imagine seeing
[2:03:39] Martha a beautiful little woman with a
[2:03:41] black veil over her face and and little
[2:03:43] Mary and them holding one another saying
[2:03:46] what do we do Papa and Mama's Gone and
[2:03:49] our precious brother now we have left
[2:03:52] the church and we're excommunicated from
[2:03:54] them and come out to follow Jesus of
[2:03:57] Nazareth and he's pulled away somewhere
[2:04:00] and left us
[2:04:03] can you imagine that story
[2:04:05] he says I can hear a Critic come by and
[2:04:07] say Hey where's that Divine healer that
[2:04:10] prophet of Galilee where is he at now
[2:04:13] see
[2:04:14] when it really comes to the time for him
[2:04:16] to do something he's gone
[2:04:21] he says there it is see
[2:04:23] God just loves to do that
[2:04:27] so if God feels gone brothers and
[2:04:29] sisters
[2:04:30] God just loves to do it
[2:04:32] he just loves to get us to the place
[2:04:34] where we've got nowhere to go but up
[2:04:37] but we're so far down the only thing
[2:04:40] that we can do is look up that's where
[2:04:42] he wants us to be brothers and sisters
[2:04:45] if we find ourselves in that
[2:04:46] circumstance you're right on track I
[2:04:49] want to tell you just to share as I'm
[2:04:50] standing here in this Pulpit you're
[2:04:52] right on track brothers and sisters
[2:04:54] we're not lost we're not far off no way
[2:04:57] this is what the prophet said oh my
[2:05:00] where is he now see when it really comes
[2:05:04] the time for him to do something he's
[2:05:06] gone there it is see God just loves to
[2:05:08] do that just let the people just let
[2:05:10] them show what they are yeah
[2:05:13] [Laughter]
[2:05:15] when it gets down to the Brass tax just
[2:05:17] let the people show what they are
[2:05:19] the Believers will show who are the
[2:05:21] Believers and the make-believers will
[2:05:24] show who are the make-believers and the
[2:05:27] unbelievers they'll just show it anyway
[2:05:28] but you know what all that can be shaken
[2:05:31] brothers and sisters will be shaken
[2:05:32] that's what the scripture says he says
[2:05:35] he's gone there it is see God just loves
[2:05:37] to do that just let the people just let
[2:05:38] the people show what they are yeah just
[2:05:41] trying them to see what they really are
[2:05:47] he gives them a blessing
[2:05:49] he appears shows himself introduces
[2:05:52] himself to the people just to see what
[2:05:54] kind of a reaction they'll take just to
[2:05:57] see what they'll do about it
[2:06:00] I just think it's amazing the way he
[2:06:01] brings it out in this message
[2:06:05] goes on to say I I said
[2:06:08] he went to the Grave weeping talking
[2:06:10] about who this Jesus really was
[2:06:13] he went to the Grave weeping as a man
[2:06:16] he went to the Grave weeping that's true
[2:06:19] enough
[2:06:20] but this is where I just it just does
[2:06:22] something to me when I read this when I
[2:06:24] think about it
[2:06:26] he was a man weeping for his friend
[2:06:30] and and to think about the compassion in
[2:06:32] Jesus
[2:06:34] because he still has that same
[2:06:35] compassion
[2:06:37] otherwise it's not Jesus Christ the same
[2:06:39] yesterday today and forever
[2:06:42] the Keystone of the Bible
[2:06:45] he says he he went to the Grave weeping
[2:06:48] that's true enough
[2:06:49] but when he's treating his little self
[2:06:51] up the Bible said there wasn't much to
[2:06:53] look upon him no beauty that we should
[2:06:55] desire him
[2:06:56] my but when he thrown them little
[2:06:59] shoulders back
[2:07:00] and said Lazarus come forth
[2:07:06] he says in a man that had been dead four
[2:07:09] days and rotten in the grave came forth
[2:07:13] that was more than a man
[2:07:16] show me the man that can do it what was
[2:07:19] it
[2:07:20] corruption knew its master
[2:07:25] and I can't help but think about that
[2:07:27] brothers and sisters when we hear this
[2:07:29] gospel
[2:07:31] preach to us when we hear the message of
[2:07:34] the hour that God sent a prophet
[2:07:36] corruption in your body knows its master
[2:07:42] you cannot stay the same person that you
[2:07:45] were
[2:07:46] corruption in your body knows its master
[2:07:50] there was more than a man show me a man
[2:07:52] that can do it what was it corruption
[2:07:54] knew its Master life knew its creator
[2:07:57] something had to happen he spoke and a
[2:08:01] man that was dead in the grave for four
[2:08:04] days raised his head and stood on his
[2:08:06] feet
[2:08:07] and he lived Hallelujah
[2:08:10] he said that was God in his son yes sir
[2:08:12] that was God making himself known
[2:08:14] through him son that was God speaking
[2:08:18] not a man
[2:08:21] my goodness pardon me
[2:08:32] you love him this morning
[2:08:34] that was more than a man
[2:08:38] the end of this message brother Branham
[2:08:40] he just goes on a little bit I'll call
[2:08:42] the musicians as we can wrap up a bit
[2:08:45] here
[2:08:48] he says that was more than a man
[2:08:51] and he says it over and over again at
[2:08:52] the end of this message
[2:08:54] he was more than a man
[2:08:57] when he looked around on that tree that
[2:08:58] one day for something to eat
[2:09:02] that was a man
[2:09:06] the Branham says but then when he took
[2:09:08] five biscuits and two fish
[2:09:10] and fed five thousand
[2:09:12] that was more than a man
[2:09:16] and when he laid in the back of that
[2:09:18] little boat that night
[2:09:20] and the Seas roaring and bouncing like a
[2:09:22] little bottle stopper out there on the
[2:09:24] Mighty Sea
[2:09:26] ten thousand Devils of the sea swore
[2:09:28] they would drown him that night
[2:09:30] he was a man
[2:09:32] weak and tired from praying for the sick
[2:09:34] laying back there and the wind didn't
[2:09:37] even disturb him
[2:09:38] he was a man when he was asleep oh my
[2:09:41] but when he woke up and he put his foot
[2:09:44] up on the Braille of the boat
[2:09:46] he looked up and said peace be still
[2:09:50] that was all God
[2:09:52] that was more than a man
[2:09:54] that was God in man making himself known
[2:09:57] that's right
[2:09:59] maybe stand with me this morning as we
[2:10:01] close
[2:10:02] he was a man at the cross when he cried
[2:10:06] for Mercy yes amen
[2:10:09] amen when he cried and said I thirst
[2:10:13] that was a man
[2:10:16] when he died he was a man
[2:10:20] but on Easter morning
[2:10:22] when he broke the seals of death hell
[2:10:24] and the grave
[2:10:26] and he rose again
[2:10:28] it was more than a man
[2:10:31] that was God made manifest
[2:10:35] brothers and sisters I want to say today
[2:10:39] that has to be something that we
[2:10:41] experience for ourselves
[2:10:44] that God has to manifest that way to us
[2:10:46] amen that we recognize that he died but
[2:10:49] he rose again
[2:10:52] and where is he today brothers and
[2:10:54] sisters
[2:10:55] take inventory
[2:10:57] I want to encourage us to take inventory
[2:10:59] every day
[2:11:01] to make sure that we haven't gone three
[2:11:03] days the wrong direction without him
[2:11:05] just assuming that he's in our boat
[2:11:08] because the moment that we leave without
[2:11:10] him
[2:11:11] we're in trouble
[2:11:13] the moment that he leaves we're in
[2:11:16] trouble
[2:11:18] and I just can't help but think brothers
[2:11:20] and sisters you know we had the examples
[2:11:22] brother Branham gave I want to give a
[2:11:23] couple that brother Branham
[2:11:25] actually experienced he said
[2:11:29] to the church I no longer call you
[2:11:32] Church
[2:11:33] I call you bride
[2:11:35] so that you'll understand what's going
[2:11:37] on
[2:11:38] and I want to say this that wasn't just
[2:11:40] a man that was speaking
[2:11:42] that was God
[2:11:43] that was God speaking through a man I'm
[2:11:46] not saying brother Branham was gone
[2:11:47] don't get me wrong
[2:11:49] I'm saying he was a prophet of God and a
[2:11:52] prophet of God is a mouthpiece of God
[2:11:55] he's the one that speaks on behalf of
[2:11:57] God
[2:11:59] and he's the one that said you are the
[2:12:01] sinless Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus
[2:12:04] Christ
[2:12:06] how can that ever be in my flesh it
[2:12:10] never can be we talked about it a long
[2:12:12] time ago brothers and sisters

[2:12:19] womb he's looking for a virgin of his
[2:12:22] word
[2:12:23] one that will only take his word that
[2:12:25] will only accept his word there's only
[2:12:28] one thing that will take into my very
[2:12:30] soul and that's his word and he says it
[2:12:32] in the message of the hour that he's
[2:12:34] looking for a virgin of his word
[2:12:36] that's the only one that's the only way
[2:12:38] that we can be that sinless spotless
[2:12:40] bride of Jesus Christ if you say to this
[2:12:43] mountain and do not doubt in your heart
